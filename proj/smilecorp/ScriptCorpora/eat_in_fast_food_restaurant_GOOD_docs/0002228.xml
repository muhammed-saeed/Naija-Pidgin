15&gt;Typical science student thinks the Energizer Bunny disproves

14&gt;They think&quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;is a grunge band.

13&gt;Hilarious&quot;Top 5&quot;list by purported high school graduate

11&gt;And the number 3 sign that American Students Are Lacking

10&gt;Ranks of chemists thinned by constant mistaking of H2SO4

9&gt;Hey, it&apos;s tough counting the number of beers in a six pack.

8&gt;If they can&apos;t find a Number 2 pencil for a test, they

&gt;&gt;&gt;Double Bad Luck - Falling From the Sky
Source: Reuter
BOGOTA, Colombia (11-25) -- It was enough bad luck when the helicopter
that Louis Eduardo Iglesias was piloting crashed into the mountains of
Southwest Colombia. Iglesias was rescued by an army helicopter.
His bad luck continued when he fell out of the rescue helicopter, and
landed onto the mountainside covered in dense vegetation.
Despite intense efforts by the rescuers, Iglesias was not located and
is presumed dead.


&gt;&gt;&gt;Snoring on the Job
Source: LA Times
HUNGTINGTON BEACH, California (11-27) -- Juan Tamalatxe, 38, broke
into a woman&apos;s apartment and apparently took refuge under the bed
when he heard someone coming.
The tenants, Mora Kai Lane and her son, returned home and watched
television for two hours before the woman heard a noise coming from the
bedroom. The woman called police.
&quot;We arrived a few minutes later,&quot;Lt. Dan Johnson said,&quot;and found
(Tamalatxe) sound asleep under the bed.&quot;
The suspect was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail.


Subject: Answers to 5 of the toughest questions women ask men

The Big Five:

 -&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; -&quot;Do you love me?&quot; -&quot;Do I look fat?&quot; -&quot;Do you think she is prettier than me?&quot; -&quot;What would you do if I died?&quot; 


What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to
explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not
answer properly, which is to say dishonestly.

For example:

1 -&quot;What are you thinking?&quot;

The proper answer to this question, of course is,&quot;I&apos;m sorry if
I&apos;ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm,
wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are
and what a lucky guy I am to have met you.&quot;Obviously, this statement
bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at
the time, which was most likely one of five things:

a - Baseball
b - Football
c - How fat you are
d - How much prettier she is than you
e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died


The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of
&apos; Married With Children&apos; , who was asked it by his wife, Peg.
&quot;If I wanted you to know,&quot;Al said,&quot;I&apos;d be talking instead of thinking.&quot;


The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong
answers:

2 -&quot;Do you love me?&quot;

The correct answer to this question is,&quot;Yes.&quot;For those guys who
feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer,&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;Wrong
answers include:

a - I suppose so.
b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes?
c - That depends on what you mean by&quot;love&quot;.
d - Does it matter?
e - Who, me?


3 -&quot;Do I look fat?&quot;

The correct male response to this question is to confidently and
emphatically state,&quot;No, of course not&quot;and then quickly leave the
room. Wrong answers include:

a - I wouldn&apos;t call you fat, but I wouldn&apos;t call you thin either.
b - Compared to what?
c - A little extra weight looks good on you.
d - I&apos;ve seen fatter.
e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance
policy.


4 -&quot;Do you think she&apos;s prettier than me?&quot;

The&quot;she&quot;in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by
you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident
or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct
response is,&quot;No, you are much prettier.&quot;Wrong answers include:

a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.
b - I don&apos;t know how one goes about rating such things.
c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.
d - Only in the sense that she&apos;s younger and thinner.
e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance
policy.


5 -&quot;What would you do if I died?&quot;

Correct answer:&quot;Dearest love, in the event of your untimely
demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce
hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino&apos;s Pizza truck
that came my way.&quot;This might be the stupidest question of the lot,
as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange:

&quot;Dear, what would you do if I died?&quot;

&quot;Why, dear, I would be extremely upset. Why do you ask such a question?&quot;

&quot;Would you remarry?&quot;

&quot;No, of course not, dear.&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t you like being married?&quot;

&quot;Of course I do, dear.&quot;

&quot;Then why wouldn&apos;t you remarry?&quot;

&quot;Alright, I&apos;d remarry.&quot;

&quot;You would?&quot;(Woman looks vaguely hurt at this point.)

&quot;Yes&quot;

&quot;Would you sleep with her in our bed?&quot;

&quot;Well yes, I suppose I would.&quot;

(Indignintly)&quot;I see. And would you let her wear my old clothes?&quot;

&quot;I suppose, if she wanted to.&quot;

&quot;Really. And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them
with pictures of her?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.&quot;

&quot;Is that so? And I suppose you&apos;d let her play with my golf clubs,
too?!!?&quot;

&quot;Of course not, dear. She&apos;s left-handed.&quot;

Subject: One Families Traditional Christmas Gift

This beats the stories of the same fruitcake(s) being given back and
forth for years...

Roy Collette and his brother-in-law have been exchanging the same pair
of pants as a Christmas present for 11 years - and each time the package
gets harder to open. This year the pants came wrapped in a car mashed
into a 3-foot cube.

The trousers are in the glove compartment of a 1974 Gremlin. Now
Collette&apos;s plotting his revenge--if he can get them out.

It all started when Collette received a pair of moleskin trousers from
his brother-in-law, Larry Kunkel of Bensenville, Ill. Kunkel&apos;s mother had
given her son the britches when he was a college student.

He wore them a few times, but they froze stiff in cold weather and he
didn&apos;t like them. So he gave them to Collette.

Collette, who called the moleskins&quot;miserable&quot;, wore them three times,
then wrapped them up and gave them back to Kunkel for Christmas the next
year.

The friendly exchange continued routinely until Collette twisted the
pants tightly, stuffed them into a 3-foot-long, 1-inch wide tube and
gave them back to Kunkel.

The next Christmas, Kunkel compressed the pants into a 7-inch square,
wrapped them with wire and gave the&quot;bale&quot;to Collette.

Not to be outdone, the next year Collette put the pants into a
2-foot-square crate filled with stones, nailed it shut, banded it with
steel and gave the trusty trousers back to Kunkel.

The brothers agreed to end the caper if the trousers were damaged. But
they were as careful as they were clever.

Kunkel had the pants mounted inside an insulated window that had a
20-year guarantee and shipped them off to Collette.

Collette broke the glass, recovered the trousers, stuffed them into a
5-inch coffee can and soldered it shut. The can was put in a 5-gallon
container filled with concrete and reinforcing rods and given to Kunkel
the following Christmas.

Two years ago, Kunkel installed the pants in a 225-pound homemade steel
ashtray made from 8-inch steel casings and etched Collette&apos;s name on the
side. Collette had trouble retrieving the treasured trousers, but
succeeded without burning them with a cutting torch.

Last Christmas, Collette found a 600-pound safe and hauled it to Viracon
Inc. in Owatonna, where the shipping department decorated it with red
and green stripes, put the pants inside and welded the safe shut. The
safe
was then shipped to Kunkel, who is the plant manager for Viracon&apos;s
outlet in
Bensenville.

Last week, the pants were trucked to Owatonna, 55 miles south of
Minneapolis, in a drab green, 3-foot cube that once was a car with
95,000 miles on it. A note attached to the 2,000-pound scrunched car
advised Collette that the pants were inside the glove compartment.

&quot;This will take some planning,&quot;Collette said.&quot;I will definitely get
them out. I&apos;m confident.&quot;But he&apos;s waiting until January to think about
how
to recover the bothersome britches.


Subject: Travel tips

Here&apos;s something they leave out of the travel brochures. It seems the
state
of Wisconsin has a program where one of their employees will monitor your
vehicular
velocity/time ratio and inform you of any discrepencies. One of the
state&apos;s
representatives informed my brother the other evening that in fact his
truck *can* do 77 in a
65 on US41. He thanked the officer for the info, which the officer had
meticulously documented
for him, and went on his way. And all that for only a measly $141.50 :(

 

Subject: Looking for the gravy ladle


In France, the young assistant pastors do not live in the main rectory.
That is reserved for the Pastor and his housekeeper. One day the pastor
invited his new young assistant pastor to have dinner at the rectory.
While being served, the young pastor noticed how shapely and lovely the
housekeeper was and down deep in his heart he wondered if there was
more between the pastor and the housekeeper.

After the meal was over, the middle-aged pastor assured the young
priest that everything was purely professional...that she was the
housekeeper and cook and that was that. About a week later the
housekeeper came to
the pastor and said,&quot;Father, ever since the new assistant came for
dinner
I have not been able to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don&apos;t
suppose he took it, do you?&quot;The Pastor said,&quot;Well, I doubt it but
I&apos;ll write him a letter.&quot;So he sat down and wrote,&quot;Dear Father, I&apos;m
not
saying you did take the gravy ladle and I&apos;m not saying you did not take
the gravy ladle. But the fact remains that it has been missing since
you were
here for dinner.&quot;

The young assistant received the letter and he answered it as follows:
&quot;Dear Father Pastor, I&apos;m not saying that you do sleep with the
housekeeper and I&apos;m not saying that you do not sleep with the
housekeeper. But I do know for sure that if you slept in your own bed
you would find
the gravy ladle.&quot;

ALLAN FUNT, PRIVATE EYE: Armored car guard Perry Hollie, 26, reported to
police that as he was getting out of his van at a Michigan National
Bank branch in Dearborn, a man pointed a gun at his partner, Matthew
Girardin, 29, and fired. Hollie said he escaped to a nearby
restaurant for help; when he returned to the van, Girardin was dead
and more than $1 million in cash was gone.&quot;He told us at the
beginning what appeared to be a credible story of an ambush,&quot;a
police spokesman said. But they discovered that a security camera
installed in the bank&apos;s automatic teller machine tells a different
story: it allegedly shows Hollie committing the crime and an
accomplice helping to unload the money. Hollie is being held without
bail on murder and weapons charges, and police are searching for the
money and accomplice. (AP)


TWO THUMBS DOWN: Seven hundred Chinese college students in Hefei, Anhui
province, who paid to see a&quot;sex education film for newlyweds&quot;
destroyed the theater where it was shown because the film&apos;s&quot;wedding
night footage&quot;was not as&quot;stimulating&quot;as advertised. Meanwhile, the
first official university-level course in sex education in China is
being offered to 100 students at the Beijing Capital Normal
University. Surveys have shown that many Chinese youths are sexually
active, but a significant percentage of them do not even understand
that it can lead to pregnancy. (Reuter, AP)


HAMBURGLAR: Chanda O&apos;Neal, the manager of a McDonald&apos;s fast food
restaurant in Kansas City, Mo., testified that the man who robbed the
restaurant while holding a 12-inch knife to her throat was wearing a
disguise. However, she said, she recognized the robber&apos;s build,
voice, and, especially, his&quot;pungent combination&quot;of cigarette smoke
and cheap cologne -- the robber, she said, was one of her employees,
Larry McCrary.&quot;This case smells,&quot;complained McCrary&apos;s lawyer to the
jury in closing arguments, but they found McCrary guilty of robbery
and&quot;armed criminal action&quot;. He faces 10 years in prison for the $100
heist. (UPI)


CASTAWAY: Raymond Keyes was fishing two miles off the coast of New York
City when he spotted Robert Slutsky bobbing in the waves. Keyes
couldn&apos;t lift the 300-pound Slutsky out of the water, so he called
for help from the Coast Guard. Upon rescue,&quot;they asked him how he
got out there, and he had no idea,&quot;a Coast Guard spokesman said.
Slutsky&apos;s weight probably saved him, the Coast Guard added, by
providing buoyancy and insulation.&quot;In water that cold, most people
would have suffered from severe hypothermia,&quot;the spokesman said.&quot;He
wasn&apos;t wearing a floatation device, and there was no sign of a boat.&quot;
(UPI)


WEAPONS &apos;R&apos; US: A 60-year-old man in Kosianka Trojanowka, Poland, was
very afraid of burglars. Police say he was killed by a booby trap he
installed in his garage as a security device. A demolition squad
dispatched to the house found eight other hidden, deadly traps.&quot;The
police explosives experts said later they felt as if they were
crossing a minefield,&quot;a police spokesman said. Meanwhile, U.N.
police in Sarajevo say that a Serb couple having an argument got a
bit carried away. When the woman ran out of the house to a
neighbor&apos;s,&quot;the husband followed her with a bazooka,&quot;a U.N.
spokesman reports.&quot;He then tried to fire the bazooka at his wife,
missed, and hit his house, causing damage.&quot;The man was arrested by
Serbian police on charges of disturbing the peace and possession of
an illegal firearm. (Reuter, 2)

&quot;World&apos;s Dumbest Mugger Apologizes to Crime Boss&quot;

NEW YORK -- A man who snatched a wallet from the mother of reputed
Genovese crime boss Vincent Gigante was hoping everybody would
forgive and forget on Monday.

Willie King, 37, was sentenced to 1-1/2 to three years in prison
for grabbing the wallet of 94-year-old Yolanda Gigante as she
walked with another son, the Rev. Louis Gigante, last month.

&quot;My client wishes to express great remorse,&quot;King&apos;s lawyer Steven
Wershaw said.

&quot;He&apos;s admitted his guilt at the earliest opportunity because he
wants to put this incident behind him, and he hopes the Gigante
family will, too,&quot;Wershaw said.

King grabbed the wallet from the woman&apos;s house coat as she walked on
a street in Greenwich Village. He was caught a few blocks away, and
the city&apos;s tabloids quickly dubbed him&quot;The World&apos;s Dumbest Mugger.&quot;

 
 


BALITMORE, Maryland, Oct 9, 1996 (Reuters) -- Two TV cops had a
chance to make a real-life bust when a shoplifter bolted onto a
scene of&quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot;in Baltimore.

The thief, who had taken about $100 worth of film from a drug store,
thought he had stumbled into real cops when he saw actors holding
prop guns and standing over a&quot;murder victim.&quot;He muttered,&quot;Oh,
no,&quot;and figured he&apos;d been caught.

One of the actors&apos; bodyguards grabbed the thief until real cops
working security around the scene arrived.

&quot;The Screen Actors Guild bylaws say I don&apos;t have to arrest anyone,&quot;
joked Richard Belzer, who plays Detective Munch.

&quot;If he&apos;s convicted,&quot;said Clark Johnson, the show&apos;s &apos;Detective
Lewis,&apos;&quot;the judge should drop the theft charge and send him away
for being stupid.&quot;
 
 

LAKEWOOD, Colo., Oct. 16 (UPI) -- Two officers shot and killed a
suspected robber who doused them with chemical spray as he fled a
King Soopers market with a bag of money, police said Wednesday.

Moments earlier the suspect sprayed two employees and bound them
with plastic flexi-cuffs before grabbing an undisclosed amount of
cash and running to an emergency exit, said Lyn Kimbrough,
spokeswoman for police in the Denver suburb of Lakewood.

&quot;He came face-to-face with a police officer,&quot;said Kimbrough.&quot;What
the officer saw was the suspect&apos;s hand coming up, then (he felt) a
pain in his face. He thought he&apos;d been shot. He fired two shots from
his handgun.&quot;

Inside another officer saw the suspect&apos;s hand raise and heard shots,
which made him think his partner had been shot, so he fired one
round from his shotgun, she said.

The suspect, an unidentified man in his thirties, died just outside
the exit, she said.

The officers, a sergeant with 11 years and a 23-year veteran
patrolman, are on administrative leave.
 
 


A Pisgat Ze&apos;ev (a northern neighborhood of Jerusalem) resident
discovered one morning last week that his car had been stolen.

He immediately called his car&apos;s cellular phone. The person who
answered told him he would trade the car for NIS 4000 [about $1300].
The man agreed and arranged a time and place for the exchange.

The Jerusalemite went directly to the police who sent a detective to
the exchange. He arrested the three men in the car.
 
 

Excerpted from the Guardian Newspaper (London), sometime in 1995

A gang decided to rob a security van, and they planned it down to
the minutest detail. They knew that it picked up a large amount
cash at a shop at a certain time every week. They planned that one
of them was to threaten the security staff with a shotgun whilst the
others swooped.

To give the shooter the element of surprise they dressed him as a
woman pushing a buggy complete with doll with the shotgun under the
blankets.

Unfortunately the shooter&apos;s approach to the van took him past a
building site. The builders spying this tall willowy woman with
eye-popping bosom and long blonde hair started wolf-whistling and
cat-calling.

The shooter was so incensed by this slur on his manhood that he
started pulling out the shotgun to silence them. On seeing this, the
rest of the gang tried to restrain him, and there ensued a fight for
possession of the gun -- in full view of the scattering builders.

The security guards promptly fled in their van. With the cash, of
course.
 
 

In Tampa, FL, a man ordered a pizza from Domino&apos;s to his house. When
the pizza arrived, he robbed the delivery guy.

When police arrived later, the man was sitting in his living room
eating the pizza.
 
 

This lovely young future leader is actually responsible enough to
get a real job, at Burger King.

On the way home from work one day, he stops off to sell some
marijuana.

To undercover police officers.

While still wearing his uniform. Complete with name tag.
 
 


I no longer have the news clipping, but one character that I dealt
with got drunk, and held up a bar. I forget why he returned, but the
patrons this time noticed that his Uzi was a plastic toy.

The police arrived in time to rescue him, but he had been stabbed
about 20 times.
 
 

A friend of mine was a teller supervisor at an S&amp;L;in San Diego. One
day they were robbed by a not particularly bright character, wearing
a 49ers jacket. His getaway involved a beeline to the nearest mall,
where he cleverly bought new clothing so that he wouldn&apos;t be noticed
-- a 49ers T-shirt, over which he again wore the jacket.

Content in his disguise, he went to the pizza place in the mall,
where he was happily gorging himself when the police arrived.
Realizing that they were there for him, he quickly told them,&quot;Your
money is in this pocket. The money in the other pocket is mine.&quot;

Having apprehended him, the police brought the teller to the scene
for identification. Before anyone could say anything, Bright Boy
announced,&quot;Yep, she&apos;s the one I robbed.&quot;
 
 

Another attorney related a tale to me of having represented a couple
of geniuses (geniui?) in federal court in San Diego. As the two left
the building, they drove around for several blocks, and found a
likely place to light up and celebrate. It was the back entrance to
the courthouse....


Subject: where is my&quot;numbers report&quot;

This once was a true story.

A user (we&apos;ll call him Sam) called up very irate one day, demanding to
know where a missing report was. Sam had been calling around all day
trying to get an answer before being referred to technical support.

SAM: Where is my *numbers* report!?

TS: Im sorry sir, what report is that?

SAM: My numbers report that I get every Monday. Ive been getting this
report every Monday for the last three months, and now I haven&apos;t gotten
one for two weeks in a row!

TS: OK. Is there a report number? A report title? Can you tell me what
information is on the report to help me identify it?

SAM: Gosh, let me find it, hold on. Oh, here it is. It says MVS Abend
Dump - Abend code SOC7 at address 00CE07F2.

TS: (incredulous) And you&apos;ve been getting this report every week for at
least three months.

SAM: Yes, until last Monday.

TS: And what is it you do with this report over there?

SAM: I dunno, I just file the reports in the library.

TS: (putting him on) Do you know who ordered the report sir? I&apos;m having
trouble locating it in our report distribution database.

SAM: Well there you go! Maybe that&apos;s the problem! You don&apos;t even have
it in your computer? No wonder we don&apos;t get it anymore.

TS: (pushing it) Maybe if you could tell me who authorized the report in
the first place, I can track manually through the records to find out what
happened.

SAM: (sheepishly) No, we don&apos;t keep track of that anywhere. Users order
reports through their own departments. Reports just show up here and we
file them until somebody comes and asks for one.

TS: OK sir. I&apos;ll do what I can to track down this report for you, and get
back to you ASAP. Thank you, have a nice day.

SAM: OK, thanks, bye.


Yes, Its sad but true. Not only did an actual weekly production report
job start abending for three months before someone noticed and fixed it,
but the distribution department dutifully boxed up the 30,000 line core
dump listing and FedExed it to the customer every week, and the customer
was filing the report in their report library without even knowing what it
was or who used it. To make matters worse, the supposed user of the real
report did not even notice that this weekly report was missing for three
months before he contacted Sam (the librarian) who called in to get the
real report reprinted for the missing three months. Sam never called back
to find out what happened to the missing report. We were ready to tell
him that the user had cancelled.

Subject: wife 1.0

Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend3.1 to GirlFriendPlus1.0
(marketing name: Fiancee1.0). Recently he upgraded Fiancee1.0
to Wife1.0 and it&apos;s a memory hogger, it has taken all his space;
and Wife1.0 must be running before he can do anything. Although he
did not ask for it, Wife1.0 came with Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw and
BrotherInLaw.
Some features I&apos;d like to see in the Upcomming GirlFriend4.0...
- A&quot;Don&apos;t remind me again&quot;button
- Minimize button
- Shutdown feature
- An install shield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely
uninstalled if so desired (so you don&apos;t lose cache and other objects)
-&quot;Abort&quot;button (O.K. that one&apos;s pretty bad - but had to say it)

I tried running girlfriend 2.0 with girlfriend 1.0 still installed,

they tried using the same i/o port and conflicted. Then I
tried to unistall girlfriend 1.0 but it didn&apos;t have an uninstall
program.

I tried to unstall it by hand, but it put files in my system directory.
Another thing that sucks in all versions of girlfriend that I&apos;ve
used is that it is totally&quot;object orientated&quot;and only supported
hardware with gold plated contacts.

***** BUG WARNING ********

Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1
before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files
before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to
install, claiming insufficient resources.

Patrick Tracy.
Lewis admitted to police that he hit her in the face three or four
times and that she fell out of the truck. He did not immediately

stuff where he found it, but instead ran out of the house.
Little Joey followed the man.&quot;When he tried to climb a fence, I
grabbed his leg and he fell back. He tried to climb over again, and I
grabbed his leg again. Then he dropped the stuff and jumped over the
fence and ran away. So I jumped over the fence, gave the stuff to my
friend Anthony, and kept chasing him,&quot;Joey testified at a preliminary
hearing.

Subject: Children and church

This is a&quot;cute&quot;little story my mother once told me. It has continued to
be a favorite source of amusement in our family over the years:

While pregnant with you, I decided that it was time to introduce your
brothers to church. One Sunday, we all dressed in our &apos;Sunday Best&apos; and
headed off to (Catholic) church.

Everything was going well, in fact I was surprised at how well-behaved my
two boys were. A sense of pride ran through me as I smiled at each of
them listening to the priest speak.

I thought we were home free until it came time to take communion. (The
priest always eats his communion wafer and drinks the wine from the goblet
before offering communion to the congregation.) As the priest lifted the
goblet to his mouth to drink, your brother, Jimmy, blurted out,&quot;What&apos;s
that man drinking, beer?&quot;

I was so mortified because everyone heard. I swore to myself that I would
never, again, bring him to church.

Subject: Casket Humor

(from the Cincinnati Enquirer, 12/12/96
excerpt from article by Mark Curnutte)

Ever wish you could say just one more thing to a deceased loved one? The
YORK EXPRESSIONS casket will let you, sort of.

New, from the Houston-based York Group, and now available nationally, the
EXPRESSIONS casket has a smooth, pearlescent finish that allows friends
and families to write on it. The casket is shipped with a complete set of
permanent markers and a memorial guide.

&quot;For years we have received requests for caskets that could be written on,
from both funeral directors and family and friends who believed this was
the most effective and appropriate expression of their grief.&quot;saya
George Foley Jr., executive vice president of the York Group.

HERE&apos;S SOME IDEAS ON WHAT TO WRITE:

On a mob informant&apos;s casket -
&quot;We told you we&apos;d get you, you dirty rat!&quot;

Housewife&apos;s casket:
&quot;We&apos;re gonna miss you! The sink&apos;s already full and the laundry is
piling up.&quot;

Boss&apos;s casket:
&quot;Man, will you be missed! Now there&apos;s nobody to spy on us and
make sure that we don&apos;t sneak out of work early.&quot;

Ex-Wife&apos; s casket:
&quot;Boy, I&apos;m sure gonna miss making those alimony payments. Hope you
don&apos;t need that fur coat where you&apos;re going.&quot;

Ex-Husband&apos;s casket:
&quot;You lousy chisler! I wasn&apos;t finished making you miserable yet!&quot;

Bomb victim&apos;s casket:
&quot;I still can&apos;t believe it! One minute you&apos;re there, the next
minute you&apos;re gone!&quot;

Pilot&apos;s casket:
&quot;If God had wanted men to fly He would have given them wings.&quot;

Sky Diver&apos;s casket:
&quot;You were so young, but you really made an impression!&quot;


***************************************************************************************************

OTHER CASKET CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS FOR CELEBRITIES:

Tim Allen&apos;s casket - Chrome handles and pin striping

Many Senators&amp;Congressmen - An ornate shoe-box for burial and
instructions on giving the body an enema before putting

David Copperfield&apos;s casket - Mysteriously disappears, thus eliminating the

Ralph Nader&apos;s casket - Has shoulder harness, lap belt and air bag.

Martha Stewart&apos;s casket - Tastefully covered with wreaths, pine cones, and

Clerk hurls Spam, foils robber with panties on head

DENISON, Texas - It must have been quite a scene. A bandit trying to
disguise himself by wearing a pair of women&apos;s panties over his head was
foiled in his attempt to rob a convenience by a Spam-slinging clerk.
Police said the bandit tried to rob the EZ Mart store early Wednesday. He
struck the woman clerk over the head with something while she had her
back to the bandit. The woman got back up and began throwing cans of
Spam at the bandit, who fled without any loot. Police said the clerk was
not seriously hurt, but she had a knot on the back of her head and was
sent home early because she was&quot;pretty shaken up&quot;by the incident.
Officers said the man was wearing black sweat pants, tennis shoes, no
shirt and the women&apos;s panties when he fled from the store.&quot;I&apos;ve never
heard of a robber using women&apos;s panties to disguise himself,&quot;said Mike
Eppler, community relations officer for the Denison Police Department.
&quot;There have been no reports of a robber using panties in a robbery
attempt in Denison. This is a new one.&quot;

Subject: Why God can&apos;t get tenure

Why God Never Received Tenure at Any University:


 He had only one major publication. It was in Hebrew. It had no references. It wasn&apos;t published in a refereed journal. Some even doubt He wrote it Himself. It may be true that He created the world, but what has He done since 


then?

 His cooperative efforts have been quite limited. The scientific community has had a hard time replicating His results. He never applied to the Ethics Board for permission to use human su 


bjects.

10. When one experiment went awry He tried to cover it up by drowning the
subjects.

11. When subjects didn&apos;t behave as predicted, He deleted them from the
sample.

 He rarely came to class, just told students to read the Book. Some say He had His Son teach the class. He expelled His first two students for learning the wrong subject. Although there were only ten requirements, most students failed His 


tests.

God Comes to Washington DC


God created heaven and the earth. Quickly He was faced with a class
action suit for failure to file an environmental impact statement.
He was granted a temporary permit for the project, but was stymied with
the cease and desist order for the earthly part.

Appearing at the hearing, God was asked why He began His earthly
project in the first place. He replied that He just liked to be
creative.

Then God said,&quot;Let there be light&quot;, and immediately the officials
demanded to know how the light would be made. Would there be strip
mining? What about thermal pollution? God explained that the light
would come from a huge ball of fire. God was granted provisional
permission to make light, assuming that no smoke would result from
the ball of fire: that He would obtain a building permit; and to
conserve energy, would have the light out half the time. God agreed
and said He would call the light&quot;Day&quot;and the darkness&quot;Night&quot;.
Officials replied that they were not interested in semantics.

God said,&quot;Let the earth bring forth green herb and such as many
seed&quot;. The EPA agreed so long as native seed was used. Then God
said,&quot;Let waters bring forth creeping creatures having life; and the fowl
that may fly over the earth&quot;. Officials pointed out this would
require approval from the Department of Game coordinated with the
Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the Audubongelic Society.

Everything was O.K. until God said He wanted to complete the project
in six days. Officials said it would take at least 200 days to
review the application and impact statement. After that there would be a
public hearing. Then there would be 10-12 months before...

At this point God created Hell.

 

Subject: Is there a Santa Claus? Distributed Santa

A follow up to the scientific/engineering analysis...

P.S. For those chilled by the grim fate of Santa in this analysis, the
entire calculation assumes only one Santa. If there is more than one
jolly
individual performing the annual ritual of cherubic philanthropy, then
things change as we shall see. This is conceptually equivalent to a
parallel processing procedure, and I must provide credit for this insight
to
an electrical engineering friend of mine.

If there are 2 santas operating in parallel, then we can divide the
work load evenly. However, the calculations will still produce forces and
aerodynamic heating which no man or beast can survive.

If there are 10, the calculations are different, but the results are
the same.

If there are 1000 santas, or what we shall call a kilosanta, then our
calculations show that each santa has 1 visit per second, travels 75,500
miles on Christmas Eve to complete his mission, pulls 321 tons in his
sleigh, and travels at roughly 2435 miles per hour, which is 3 times the
speed of sound, or roughly as fast as the SR-71 Blackbird, the US Air
Force&apos;s (until recently) premier high altitude spy aircraft. Even with
the
reductions in speed and subsequently reductions in drag, aerodynamic
heating
is still unreasonable and the kilosanta still dies.

If we run the calculations for 1,000,000 santas operating in
parallel,
or a Megasanta, then the results are more encouraging. For instance, each
santa travels at 2 miles per hour between stops, has about 20 minutes at
each house, and travels a total of 75 miles. Furthermore, each santa has
a
load of only 182 lbs. for his 91 stops. Even if each santa is a load (as
we
can safely assume from the stories surrounding our corpulent culprit!), we
are dealing with a total of approximately 532 lbs.

Our alternate conclusion then? Santa is not dead, he&apos;s distributed.

 


Subject: Diversity Training and Jesus

And Joseph went up from Galilee to Bethlehem with Mary, his espoused
wife, who was great with child. And she brought forth a son and wrapped
him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no
room for them in the inn. And the angel of the Lord spoke to the shepherds
and said,&quot;I bring you tidings of great joy. Unto you is born a Savior,
which is Christ the Lord.&quot;
&quot;There&apos;s a problem with the angel,&quot;said a Pharisee who happened to be
strolling by. As he explained to Joseph, angels are widely regarded as
religious symbols, and the stable was on public property where such symbols
were not allowed to land or even hover.
&quot;And I have to tell you, this whole thing looks to me very much like a
Nativity scene,&quot;he said sadly.&quot;That&apos;s a no-no, too.&quot;Joseph had a
bright
idea.&quot;What if I put a couple of reindeer over there near the ox and ass?&quot;
he said, eager to avoid sectarian strife.
&quot;That would definitely help,&quot;said the Pharisee, who knew as well as
anyone that whenever a savior appeared, judges usually liked to be on the
safe side and surround it with deer or woodland creatures of some sort.
&quot;Just to clinch it, throw in a candy cane and a couple of elves and
snowmen,
too,&quot;he said.&quot;No court can resist that.&quot;
Mary asked,&quot;What does my son&apos;s birth have to do with snowmen?&quot;
&quot;Snowpersons,&quot;cried a young woman, changing the subject before it veered
dangerously toward religion. Off to the side of the crowd, a Philistine
was
painting the Nativity scene. Mary complained that she and Joseph looked
too
tattered and worn in the picture.&quot;Artistic license,&quot;he said.&quot;I&apos;ve got
to show the plight of the haggard homeless in a greedy, uncaring society in
winter,&quot;he quipped.&quot;We&apos;re not haggard or homeless. The inn was just
full,&quot;said Mary.&quot;Whatever,&quot;said the painter.

Two women began to argue fiercely. One said she objected to Jesus&apos;
birth&quot;because it privileged motherhood.&quot;The other scoffed at virgin
births, but said that if they encouraged more attention to diversity in
family forms and the rights of single mothers, well, then, she was all
for them.&quot;I&apos;m not a single mother,&quot;Mary started to say, but she was
cut off by a third woman who insisted that swaddling clothes are a form
of child abuse, since they restrict the natural movement of babies.

With the arrival of 10 child advocates, all trained to spot infant
abuse and manger rash, Mary and Joseph were pushed to the edge of the
crowd, where arguments were breaking out over how many reindeer (or
what mix of reindeer and seasonal sprites) had to be installed to
compensate for the infant&apos;s unfortunate religious character.

An older man bustled up, bowling over two merchants, who had been busy
debating whether an elf is the same as a fairy and whether the
elf/fairy should be shaking hands with Jesus in the crib or merely
standing to the side, jumping around like a sports mascot.

&quot;I&apos;d hold off on the reindeer,&quot;the man said, explaining that the use
of asses and oxen as picturesque backdrops for Nativity scenes carries
the subliminal message of human dominance. He passed out two leaflets,
one denouncing manger births as invasions of animal space, the other
arguing that stables are&quot;penned environments&quot;where animals are
incarcerated against their will. He had no opinion about elves or candy
canes.

Signs declaring&quot;Free the Bethlehem 2&quot;began to appear, referring to
the obviously exploited ass and ox. Someone said the halo on Jesus&apos;
head was elitist. Mary was exasperated.&quot;And what about you, old
mother?&quot;she said sharply to an elderly woman.&quot;Are you here to attack
the shepherds as prison guards for excluded species, maybe to complain
that singing in Latin identifies us with our Roman oppressors, or just
to say that I should have skipped patriarchal religiosity and joined
some dumb new-age goddess religion?&quot;

&quot;None of the above,&quot;said the woman,&quot;I just wanted to tell you that the
Magi are here.&quot;Sure enough, the three wise men rode up. The crowd
gasped,&quot;They&apos;re all male!&quot;And&quot;Not very multicultural!&quot;&quot;Balthasar
here is black,&quot;said one of the Magi.&quot;Yes, but how many of you are gay
or disabled?&quot;someone shouted. A committee was quickly formed to find
an impoverished lesbian wise-person among the halt and lame of
Bethlehem.

A calm voice said,&quot;Be of good cheer, Mary, you have done well and your
son will change the world.&quot;At last, a sane person, Mary thought. She
turned to see a radiant and confident female face. The woman spoke
again:&quot;There is one thing, though. Religious holidays are important,
but can&apos;t we learn to celebrate them in ways that unite, not divide? For
instance, instead of all this business about &apos;Gloria in excelsis Deo,&apos;
why not just &apos;Season&apos;s Greetings&apos;?&quot;

Mary said,&quot;You mean my son has entered human history to deliver the
message, &apos;Hello, it&apos;s winter&apos;?&quot;&quot;That&apos;s harsh, Mary,&quot;said the woman.
&quot;Remember, your son could make it big in midwinter festivals, if he
doesn&apos;t push the religion thing too far. Centuries from now, in
nations yet unborn, people will give each other pricey gifts and have
big office parties on his birthday. That&apos;s not chopped liver.&quot;

&quot;Let me get back to you,&quot;Mary said.


Subject: More &apos;Deep Thoughts..........&apos;

If they ever come up with a swashbuckling School, I think one of
the courses should be&quot;Laughing, Then Jumping Off Something&quot;.

When you&apos;re riding in a time machine way far into the future,
don&apos;t stick your elbow out the window, or it&apos;ll turn into a fossil.

It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at
that man.

A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite.
Then you call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone.
&quot;Hear that?&quot;you say.&quot;That&apos;s dynamite, baby.&quot;


Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let&apos;s say
you&apos;re an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner
has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the
moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast
off. He might call you on the radio and say he&apos;s not Dracula, but
you just say,&quot;Think again, bat man.&quot;

Too bad you can&apos;t buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the
earth spin real fast and freak everybody out.

I wish I had a Kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both
Dracula AND Superman away.

Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess
is why several of us died of tuberculosis.

I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king,
they don&apos;t just go by size, because I bet there are some
Chihuahuas with some good ideas.

I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all
skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that
said,&quot;I helped skin Bob.&quot;

I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane
crash is they don&apos;t want anybody walking in and lying down in the
crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just
woke up and go,&quot;What was THAT?!&quot;

The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of
the face.

Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap
can bite and bite, but it won&apos;t bother the frog because it only
has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen
and it could be like ambition.

If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of
conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I
don&apos;t think it would be a good idea to say,&quot;I swallowed it. So
sue me.&quot;

If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of
danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes,
Mr. Brave man, I guess I&apos;m a coward.

I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in
every culture, is the story of Popeye.

When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask
is if they ever press charges.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there&apos;s no music, no
choreography, and the dancers hit each other.

To me, clowns aren&apos;t funny. In fact, they&apos;re kind of scary. I&apos;ve
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time
I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.

If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good
reason.

Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks
his head out when you&apos;re coming home his face might burn up.

Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick
to calm myself down. I&apos;ll go over to the persons house and ring
the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I&apos;m gone, but
you know what I&apos;ve left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a
knife stuck in the side of it&apos;s head with a note that says&quot;You.&quot;
After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done.

If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because
maybe you&apos;ll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you
because, hey, free dummy.

Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto
someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I
have to laugh, because what is that thing.

If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to
tell him is&quot;God is crying.&quot;And if he asks why God is crying,
another cute thing to tell him is&quot;Probably because of something
you did.&quot;

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going
to take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him
to an old burned-out warehouse.&quot;Oh, no,&quot;I said,&quot;DisneyLand
burned down.&quot;He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he
thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the
real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late.

I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he
came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too
bad.

If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn&apos;t open, and you
friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be
to pretend you were swimming.

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After
school we&apos;d all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he
would eat one of us. It wasn&apos;t until later that I found out that
Uncle Caveman was a bear.

Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell
him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky
feeling.

The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw.

When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular
heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but
if it&apos;s not, mmmmmmm, boy.

I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate
revolver. and since he is so busy, you&apos;d probably have to run up
to him real quick and give it to him.

If you&apos;re robbing a bank and you&apos;re pants fall down, I think
it&apos;s okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because,
come on, life is funny.

If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror,
because I bet that will really throw you into a panic.

Sometimes I think I&apos;d be better off dead. No, wait, not me. You.

I can&apos;t stand cheap people. It makes me real mad when someone
says something like,&quot;Hey, when are you going to pay me that $100
you owe me?&quot;or&quot;Do you have that $50 you borrowed?&quot;Man, quit
being so cheap!

I wish outer space guys would conquer the Earth and make people
their pets, because I&apos;d like to have one of those little beds
with my name on it.

If you&apos;re in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the
enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it&apos;ll make
everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking,
you can throw a real grenade at them.

I think a good product would be&quot;Baby Duck Hat&quot;. It&apos;s a fake baby
duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming
underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you
join them. Then, all of a sudden, you stand up out of the water
and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks really take off! Also,
Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.

I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I&apos;d save up my
money for about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick.
Then I&apos;d go out West and start digging for gold. When someone
came up and asked what I was doing, I&apos;d say,&quot;Looking for gold,
ya durn fool.&quot;He&apos;d say,&quot;Your pick is gold,&quot;and I&apos;d say,&quot;Well,
that was easy.&quot;Good joke, huh?

I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew
what was coming.&quot;You don&apos;t have to tell me,&quot;I said.&quot;I&apos;m off
the team, aren&apos;t I?&quot;&quot;Well,&quot;said Coach,&quot;you never were really
ON the team. You made that uniform you&apos;re wearing out of rags and
towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at
practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to
get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times.&quot;
It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something
is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in
me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that&apos;s when I
felt the handcuffs go on.

Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a
mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted
to tell someone about the treasure. I said,&quot;Okay, as long as
it&apos;s not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you
know.&quot;He stared telling hes story, about the treasure and his
life and all, and I thought:&quot;This story isn&apos;t too long.&quot;But
then, he kept going, and I started thinking,&quot;Uh-oh, this story
is getting long.&quot;But then the story was over, and I said to
myself:&quot;You know, that story wasn&apos;t too long after all.&quot;I
forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on
the plane. It was a little long, though.

AESTHETIC EMESIS: A Museum of Modern Art of New York spokesman said that
when a museum guest vomited on a painting,&quot;it was an unfortunate
incident, a fluke.&quot;But Jubal Brown, 22, of Ontario College of Art
and Design, said no, it was a protest. He says he is on a quest to
publicly puke on three masterpiece paintings, each in a primary
color. For the MoMA&apos;s&quot;Composition in Red, White and Blue&quot;by Piet
Mondrian, he loaded up on blue gelatin. In May, he ralphed red on
Raoul Dufy&apos;s&quot;Harbour at le Havre&quot;at the Art Gallery of Ontario. His
next technicolor yawn will be in yellow, he says, but he won&apos;t say
where. Brown said it was easy to heave on the Mondrian.&quot;I found its
lifelessness threatening and it made me sick,&quot;he said. Both museums

action. (AP)

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT: Marcelo Adrian Mendoza, 33, serving

WON&apos;T PLAY IN PEORIA: Illinois prison officials have put a stop to an
exhibit of&quot;Death Row Art&quot;at a Chicago art gallery, where inmate-
created works would have been sold to the public. The Illinois
Corrections Department said they didn&apos;t know about the planned
exhibit until a local newspaper called for comment. Officials said no
one had given the prisoners permission to make money from art created
behind bars. A spokesman for the Capital Resource Foundation, a group
run by employees of the Illinois Appellate Defenders&apos; Chicago office,
said the exhibit was just a way&quot;to show that condemned killers are
human beings&quot;. He said that&quot;people who are on death row have a very
difficult time. These kinds of things give people hope.&quot;(UPI)

Subject: Bipartisan Christmas Tale

&apos;Twas the night before Christmas and throughout the White House,
Al Gore was eyeing Hillary, peering into her blouse.
The Secret Service were guarding the premises with care,
For a whole host of Democrats were vacationing there.

Chelsea was nestled all snug in her bed,
Dirty thoughts swam around Mr. Kennedy&apos;s head.
And Bill in his sportcoat; a heavy gray tweed,
Had just fried his brain with some Mexican weed.

When out in the garden came a plethora of noise,
All drunken and rowdy: &apos;twas Newt and the boys!
Bill jumped to the window, and tore open the sash,
&quot;It&apos;s a raid boys!&quot;he cried,&quot;Quick, go hide my stash!&quot;

The pot in his blood and the moon on the snow,
Gave a psychedelic haze to the objects below.
When what to Bill&apos;s frantic eyes should appear,
But a slew of Republicans and a keg of ice beer.

With a big House leader, all lively and fat:
He knew it was Newt, the proponent of GATT!
As viscous as vipers, the Republicans came,
And Bill recognized them and called them by name.

&quot;Hey Helms, Hey Thurmond! Hey Packwood and Hatch!
Hey Dole and Pataki, it&apos;s time for a bash!&quot;
A collective cheer rose our from the crowd,
&quot;Let&apos;s listen to Nugent, and turn it up loud!&quot;

Together Dems and Republicans danced and sang out in cheer
&quot;Screw health care and Haiti, it&apos;s time to drink beer!&quot;
When from the chimney, came a big black cloud of soot,
As Limbaugh danced from the fireplace in a red Santa suit.

He moved through the crowd, then held up his hand,
And when all was silent, he did a keg stand.
And the crowd raised their cups, as Newt bowed down in prayer,
And champagne flowed freely, just like welfare.

As Kennedy and Reno romped in the Green Room,
The rest of the crooks outlined their plan of doom.
&quot;We&apos;ll pray in the schools, shove it down their throats!&quot;
&quot;More welfare, more taxes, we&apos;ll still get the votes!&quot;

And they drank, hugged and danced, they crossed party lines.
They cheered,&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter, we&apos;re all bastard swines!&quot;
So they threw out allegiance and partisan crap,
And they took turns sitting on the President&apos;s lap.

And Gephardt and Dole passed out on the lawn,
And awoke in the morning without their pants on.
And Packwood gave Tipper a pat on the rear.
While Judge Thomas and Miss Hill went out for more beer.

Then the party-ers discovered a sight so touching and cute,
President Clinton fast asleep, snuggled up next to Newt.
Santa Limbaugh smiled and threw up on his boots,
&quot;A merry Clinton to all, and to all a good Newt!&quot;

Superior Health Insurance
ATTN: Claims Review
1423 W. 90th St.
New York, NY 05016

Dear Sir:

This letter is in response to your recent letter requesting a more
detailed explanation concerning my recent internment at Methodist Hospital.
Specifically, you asked for an expansion in reference to Block 21(a)(3)
of the claim form (reason for hospital visit). On the original form, I
put ``Stupidity&apos;&apos;. I realize now that this answer was somewhat vague
and so I will attempt to more fully explain the circumstances leading
up to my hospitalization.
I had needed to use the restroom and had just finished a quick bite
to eat at the local burger joint. I entered the bathroom, took care of my
business, and just prior to the moment in which I had planned to raise my
trousers, the locked case that prevents theft of the toilet paper in such
places came undone and, feeling it striking my knee, unthinkingly, I
immediately, and with
unneccesary force, returned the lid back to its normal position.
Unfortunately, as I did this I also turned and certain parts of my
body, which were still exposed, were trapped between the device&apos;s lid and
its
main body. Feeling such intense and immediate pain caused me to jump back.
It quickly came to my attention that, when one&apos;s privates are firmly
attached
to an unmoveable object, it is not a good idea to jump in the opposite
direction.
Upon recovering some of my senses, I attempted to reopen the lid.
However, my slamming of it had been sufficent to allow the locking
mechanism
to engage. I then proceeded to get a hold on my pants and subsequently
removed my
keys from them. I intended to try to force the lock of the device open
with one of my keys;
thus extrcating myself.
Unfortunately, when I attempted this, my key broke in the lock.
Embarassment of
someone seeing me in this unique position became a minor concern, and I
began to call
for help in as much of a calm and rational manner as I could. An employee
from the
resturaunt quickly arrived and decided that this was a problem requiring
the attention of
the store manager.
Betty, the manager, came quickly. She attempted to unlock the
device
with her keys. Since I had broken my key off in the device, she could not
get her key in. Seeing no other solution, she called the EMS (as indicated
on your form in block 21(b)(1)).
After approximately 15 minutes, the EMS arrived, along with two
police
officers, a fire-rescue squad, and the channel 4 ``On-the-Spot&apos;&apos; news
team.
The guys from the fire department quickly took charge as this was
obviously a
rescue operation. The senior member of the team discovered that the
device
was attached with bolts to the cement wall that could only be reached once
the device was unlocked. (His discovery was by means of tearing apart the
device located in the stall next to the one that I was in. (Since the
value of
the property destroyed in his examination was less than $50 (my deductable)
I did not include it in my claim.) His partner, who seemed like an
intelligent fellow at
the time, came up with the idea of cutting the device from the wall with
the propane
torch that was in the rescue truck.
The fireman went to his truck, retrieved the torch, and commenced
to
attempt to cut the device from the wall. Had I been in a state to think of
such things, I might have realized that in cutting the device from the wall
several things would also inevitably happen. First, the air inside of the
device would quickly heat up, causing items inside the device to suffer
the
same effects that are normally achieved by placing things in an oven.
Second,
the metal in the device is a good conductor of heat causing items that
are in
contact with the device to react as if thrown into a hot skillet. And,
third,
molten metal would shower the inside of the device as the torch cut
through.
The one bright note of the propane torch was that it did manage to
cut, in the brief time that I allowed them to use it, a hole big enough
for a
small pry bar to be placed inside of the device. The EMS team then loaded
me,
along with the device, into the waiting ambulance as stated on your form.
Due the small area of your block 21(a)(3), I was unable to give a
full explanation of these events, and thus used the word which I thought
best described my actions that led to my hospitalization.

Sincerely,
S. Anderson

A 7-year-old and his 4-year-old brother are upstairs in their bedroom. The
7-year-old is explaining that it is high time that the two of them begin
swearing.
When his little brother responds enthusiastically, the 7-year-old says,
&quot;When we go downstairs for breakfast this morning, I&apos;ll say &apos;hell&apos; andand
you say &apos;ass&apos;.&quot;
The 4-year-old happily agrees.

As the two boys are seating themselves at the breakfast table, their mother
walks in and asks her older son what he would like to eat for breakfast.

The 7-year-old replies,&quot;Aw hell, mom, I&apos;ll just have some Cheerios.&quot;

WHACK! The surprised mother reacts quickly. The boy runs upstairs,
crying
his eyes out and rubbing his behind.

With a sterner note in her voice, the mother then turns to the younger
son.
&quot;And what would YOU like for breakfast?!!?&quot;she asks him.

&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot;the 4-year-old replies,&quot;but you can bet your sweet $#@ !
it&apos;s not gonna be Cheerios!&quot;


Subject: How to Argue and Win Every Time

(Note from Gare: This sounds like a Dave Barry article to me.)


I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an
argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this and
steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great
respect, they don&apos;t even invite me. You too can win arguments. Simply
follow these rules:

*Drink liquor.

Suppose you are at a party and some hotshot intellectual is expounding
on the economy of Peru, a subject you know nothing about. If you&apos;re
drinking some health-fanatic drink like grapefruit juice, you&apos;ll hang
back, afraid to display your ignorance, while the hotshot enthralls
your date. But if you drink several large martinis, you&apos;ll discover
you have STRONG VIEWS about the Peruvian economy. You&apos;ll be a WEALTH
of information. You&apos;ll argue forcefully, offering searing insights
and possibly upsetting furniture. People will be impressed. Some may
leave the room.

*Make things up.

Suppose, in the Peruvian economy argument, you are trying to prove
that Peruvians are underpaid, a position you base solely on the fact
that YOU are underpaid, and you&apos;ll be damned if you&apos;re going to let a
bunch of Peruvians be better off. DON&apos;T say:&quot;I think Peruvians are
underpaid.&quot;Say instead:&quot;The average Peruvian&apos;s salary in 1981
dollars adjusted for the revised tax base is $1,452.81 per annum,
which is $836.07 before the mean gross poverty level.&quot;

NOTE: Always make up exact figures.

If an opponent asks you where you got your information, make THAT up
too. Say:&quot;This information comes from Dr. Hovel T. Moon&apos;s study for
the Buford Commission published on May 9, 1982. Didn&apos;t you read it?&quot;
Say this in the same tone of voice you would use to say,&quot;You left
your soiled underwear in my bathroom.&quot;

*Use meaningless but weighty-sounding words and phrases.

Memorize this list:

Let me put it this way

In terms of

Vis-a-vis

Per se

As it were

Qua

So to speak

You should also memorize some Latin abbreviations such as&quot;Q.E.D.&quot;,
&quot;e.g.&quot;, and&quot;i.e.&quot;These are all short for&quot;I speak Latin, and you don&apos;t.&quot;

Here&apos;s how to use these words and phrases. Suppose you want to say,
&quot;Peruvians would like to order appetizers more often, but they don&apos;t
have enough money.&quot;

You never win arguments talking like that. But you WILL win if you
say,&quot;Let me put it this way. In terms of appetizers vis-a-vis
Peruvians qua Peruvians, they would like to order them more often, so
to speak, but they do not have enough money per se, as it were. Q.E.D.&quot;

Only a fool would challenge that statement.

*Use snappy and irrelevant comebacks.

You need an arsenal of all-purpose irrelevant phrases to fire back at
your opponents when they make valid points. The best are:

You&apos;re begging the question.

You&apos;re being defensive.

Don&apos;t compare apples to oranges.

What are your parameters?

This last one is especially valuable. Nobody (other than engineers
and policy wonks) has the vaguest idea what&quot;parameters&quot;means.

Here&apos;s how to use your comebacks:

You say: As Abraham Lincoln said in 1873...

Your opponent says: Lincoln died in 1865.

You say: You&apos;re begging the question.

You say: Liberians, like most Asians...

Your opponent says: Liberia is in Africa.

You say: You&apos;re being defensive.

*Compare your opponent to Adolf Hitler.

This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously
right and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring Hitler up subtly. Say,
&quot;That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say,&quot;or
&quot;You certainly do remind me of Adolf Hitler.&quot;

So that&apos;s it. You now know how to out-argue anybody. Do not try to
pull any of this on people who generally carry weapons.

Subject: Politically Correct Santa

&apos;Twas the night before Christmas and Santa&apos;s a wreck...
How to live in a world that&apos;s politically correct?
His workers no longer would answer to&quot;Elves&quot;,
&quot;Vertically Challenged&quot;they were calling themselves.
And labor conditions at the north pole
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.
Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.
And equal employment had made it quite clear
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.
So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,
Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!
The runners had been removed from his sleigh;
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.
And people had started to call for the cops
When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.
Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.
His fur trimmed red suit was called&quot;Unenlightened.&quot;
And to show you the strangeness of life&apos;s ebbs and flows,
Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose
And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,
Demanding millions in over-due compensation.
So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,
Who suddenly said she&apos;d enough of this life,
Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.
And as for the gifts, why, he&apos;d ne&apos;er had a notion
That making a choice could cause so much commotion.
Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.
Nothing that might be construed to pollute.
Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.
Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.
Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.
Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.
Nothing that&apos;s warlike or non-pacific.
No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.
And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,
Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.
For they raised the hackles of those psychological
Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.
No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.
Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;
And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.
So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;
He just could not figure out what to do next.
He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,
But you&apos;ve got to be careful with that word today.
His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;
Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.
Something special was needed, a gift that he might
Give to all without angering the left or the right.
A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,
Each group of people, every religion;
Every ethnicity, every hue,
Everyone, everywhere...even you.
So here is that gift, it&apos;s price beyond worth...
&quot;May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth.&quot;


Subject: If Lawyers wrote Christmas Tidings...

FOR READERS IN THEIR 23RD
YEAR OF SCHOOLING
AND BEYOND

&apos;Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual
yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic
activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential,
including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus. Hosiery
was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood-burning
caloric
apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent
visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric
appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically
through their cerebra. My conjugal partner and I, attired
in our nocturnal cranial coverings, were about to take slumbrous
advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior
portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that
I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the
purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing the
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without,
reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline
aqueous precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian
itself -- thus permitting my incredulous optical sensor to peruse a
miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by an octet of
diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged
chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me
that he was indeed our anticipated caller. With his ungulate
motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous
velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled
breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the
octet by his or her respective cognomen...
&quot;Now Dasher, now Dancer...&quot;et al. -- guiding them to the uppermost
exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could
readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal
extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was
performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved --
with utmost celerity and via a downward leap -- entry by way of the smoke
passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebon residue
from the oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the
walls
thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the
plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cl
oth
receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his
submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging
amiability. The capillaries of his molar regions and nasal aptenance were
engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former
approximating the coloration of Albion&apos;s floral emblem, the latter that
of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials
resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute
facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of
frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smokingpiece whose gray fumes,
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a
decorative
seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was high, and
when
he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the
manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container.

Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the
aforementioned hosiery with articles of merchandise extracted from his
aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon
completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a
single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ,
inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith
affected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He
then
propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a
musical
expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered
quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto
observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But
I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his
vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility:

&quot;Ecstatic yuletides to the planetary constituence, and to that
self-same assemblage my sincerest wishes for a salubriously
beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.&quot;

Surely bulges and excess weight shall
Follow me all the days of my life,
And I will be FAT FOREVER.

Not a creature was stirring,

and tore him apart-
Ate his mousey intestines
And chewed up his heart.

Kitty thought he heard sleighbells,
which made him take pause-
He stopped daintily licking
the blood from his claws.

&quot;Must be Santa,&quot;thought kitty
(that quite clever cat)
&quot;Cuz nobody else climbs down

Indeed it was ol&apos; Santa,

With a huge load of presents

Then he coughed up a hairball
And shed some more fur.

Subject: Wheeling Gaunt

Ohio widows get yearly allotment of flour, courtesy of freed slave.

(Note from Gare - this isn&apos;t necessarily a funny story, but it&apos;s a good
one.)


YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (Dec 12, 1996 3:48 p.m. EST) -- For years, Yellow
Springs has been keeping a list and checking it twice. But it&apos;s the widows,
not the kids, who get the Christmas gift.

Every year this season, every widow in town gets a free 10 pounds of flour
and 10 pounds of sugar, part of a century-old bequest from a former slave..

&quot;The first time I got it I didn&apos;t know whether to laugh or cry,&quot;said Pat
Hubbard, whose husband died nine years ago.&quot;So I did both.&quot;

The widows&apos; benefactor, Wheeling Gaunt, bought his freedom from a Kentucky
slaveholder for $900, moved to Yellow Springs -- a stop on the Underground
Railroad -- in the 1860s, and made his fortune as a teamster, carpenter and
farmer.

At his death in 1894, he donated nine acres of farmland to the community on
the condition it distribute 25 pounds of flour to its&quot;poor worthy widows&quot;
every Christmas

The village, population 4,000, hasn&apos;t missed a Christmas since, though it&apos;s
made some changes. From the first, the flour was given to all widows,
apparently in the belief that that&apos;s what Gaunt would have wanted.

In the early 1950s, the village cut the amount of flour and added sugar
because, it reasoned, women were not baking as much bread anymore and might
have use for sugar.

There are now 110 widows on the distribution list, updated by a village
administrative assistant who pores over the obituaries in the newspaper.

Occasionally, a widow will decline the offer, usually because she doesn&apos;t
bake or is allergic to flour or sugar. But that&apos;s rare.

&quot;A lot of times the widows will have the doors open and are looking out the
window waiting for me to show up,&quot;said Kelley Fox, one of the city workers
who deliver the goods.

Some of the widows even invite the workers to come back and pick up some of
the goodies they&apos;ve baked.&quot;One lady will make zucchini bread and give to
us,&quot;Fox said.&quot;And around Christmastime a batch of cookies are likely to
show up at random. It makes you feel good.&quot;

Lottie Phillips, 73, said she uses the flour and sugar to make cornbread,
cakes, sugar cookies and fudge:&quot;My family loves it.&quot;

Maxine Grubb, 76, said she is especially glad to get the flour and sugar in
the winter, because it saves her from having to go the grocery store. She
said she uses the sugar to attract hummingbirds to her yard in the summer.

Gaunt intended that the rent from the land pay for his gift, which cost
about $900 this year. The land is now a park, with a swimming pool,
baseball
diamonds and soccer fields, and the pool admission fees pay for the flour
and sugar, which the village buys from a grocery store.

No one knows why Gaunt chose this particular legacy, but local historian
Phyllis Jackson noted that most women did not hold jobs then and were often
left penniless when their husbands died.&quot;Bread is the staff of life. If
you had bread, you could survive for a while,&quot;she said.

There is hardly a widow in Yellow Springs -- a village that is two-thirds
white -- who doesn&apos;t know Gaunt&apos;s name.

&quot;This Wheeling Gaunt was a man who had been a slave. I don&apos;t know how well
he was treated or how poorly he was treated, but he didn&apos;t have any
freedom,&quot;Ms. Hubbard said.&quot;But he still found it in his heart to give to
others.&quot;

Ms. Hubbard hopes the tradition never dies.

&quot;I guess it&apos;s one of the sweetest things in life,&quot;she said.


Subject: Small world!

Andy and Pete were having an awfully slow round of golf, because the two
attractive ladies in front of them managed to get into every sand trap,
lake, and rough on the course, and they didn&apos;t bother to wave the men on
through, which is proper golf etiquette.

After two hours of waiting and waiting, Andy said:&quot;I think I&apos;ll walk up
there and ask those gals to let us play through.&quot;

He walked up the fairway, got halfway to the ladies, stopped, turned
around,
and came back, explaining:&quot;I can&apos;t do it. One of those women is my wife
and
the other is my mistress. Maybe you&apos;d better go talk to them.&quot;

So Pete took off toward the ladies, got halfway there and, just as Andy had
done, stopped, turned around, and walked back. In reply to Andy&apos;s quizzical
look he said only:&quot;Small world.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Escape Attempt Returned To Sender
POINT OF THE MOUNTAIN, Utah (12-19) -- It&apos;s always a good
idea to mail your packages early during the holiday season.
That&apos;s exactly what 48-year-old David A. Neel did. Instead of
mailing gifts to his family, Neel placed himself inside a large
cardboard box in an attempt to break out of prison.
The box was found just outside the jail and it was on its way
to a United Parcel Service (UPS) station. A prison guard was
not fooled by the suspicious package.
&quot;The guard went through kicking the boxes, like he normally
does. For some reason, he thought this one didn&apos;t seem quite
right,&quot;spokesman Jack Ford said.
Neel was serving a life sentence for molesting a child.
Prison authorities are searching for accomplices who sealed
Neel inside the box.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Greedy Cops Conned by Thieves
LIMA, Peru (12-17) -- Peruvian police officers were bought off
with forged banknotes by some clever thieves.
Responding to a robbery in progress, the police officers caught
the robbers after a car chase through a remote Andean village.
The thieves escaped arrest after giving the officers a&quot;thick wad&quot;
of cash, according to witnesses.
When counting the money the next morning, the policemen
found out they have been conned. The robbers have used forged
money, El Comercio newspaper reported.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Faking Blindness to Enter College
CAIRO (12-20) -- Some Egyptian students found a way to enter
college despite poor grades - they faked blindness.
The youngsters took advantage of a government program
which guaranteed a better chance to blind and handicapped
students to enter college.
At Ain Shams university, for example, out of 90 students who
claimed to be blind, 25 were frauds.
&quot;Precise visual devices proved they were pretending. The centers
from which they came will be investigated,&quot;said Abdelwahhab
Abdelhafez, president of Ain Shams university.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Man Hides in Refrigerator
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. (12-18) -- Federal agents searched a

Two of the beers were open.

who denied Smith&apos;s bail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Husband Turns Out to Be Woman
ALEXSANDRIA, Virginia (12-19) -- Margaret Anne Hunter filed a
lawsuit against her spouse after she found out that her husband
was actually a ...woman.
Holly Anne Groves, 26, posed as Thorne Wesley Jameson
Groves and pretended to be dying of AIDS in order to avoid sex.
The $575,000 lawsuit claims that Groves&apos; breasts were covered
with bandages which she explained as injuries suffered during
an automobile accident.
Hunter, 24, became aware of the scam when Groves&apos; parents
called and asked to speak to&quot;Holly.&quot;
&quot;Holly had such credible and detailed explanations, excuses and
personal history... There was nothing that gave my client or other
people pause,&quot;attorney Seth Guggenheim said.
Hunter met Groves over the Internet in the fall of 1995. The two
agreed to get married a few months later. The lawsuit states that
Ms. Hunter agreed to the marriage&quot;out of compassion and love.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kangaroo Saves Farmer&apos;s Life
MELBOURNE (12-19) -- A kangaroo used his tail to knock on
a farmer&apos;s bedroom door in an attempt to wake him up and alert
him of a fire that broke out in the house.
&quot;If the wallaby hadn&apos;t woken me up I would have been dead,&quot;
said farmer Nigel Etherington.
Etherington rescued the animal the night before the fire, after it
was hit by a vehicle. He took the small marsupial inside his home,
nursed it, and let it sleep in the bathroom. A few hours later, the
wallaby returned the favor by alerting Etherington of the fire.
Etherington plans to adopt the wallaby who was named Skippy
based on a 1970s TV series starring a heroic kangaroo.

MAKING A LIST, CHECKING IT TWICE: Many wealthy families have personal
shoppers. Police in St. Paul, Minn., say the Dick family had a
personal shoplifter. Dentist Gregory Dick, his wife Judy, son James,
and Daughter Stacy Zehran have been charged with receiving stolen
property after allegedly hiring a man to steal more than $250,000 in
goods, such as Armani suits and Baccarat crystal, for the family&apos;s
use. Police said the Dicks gave Gregory Thomas, 37, detailed shopping
lists of items to steal, and paid to bail him out of jail whenever he
was caught stealing for them.

NAUGHTY, NOT NICE: Roy Keiser, 65, has played Santa Claus in Plaistow,
N.H., for more than 20 years. But he wasn&apos;t ready for a 7-year-old
Cub Scout who tested his authenticity a bit too fervently. Witnesses
say the Cub pulled Keiser&apos;s beard so hard it ripped off his face,
taking some skin with it. Keiser allegedly came unglued and slapped
the boy, leading to assault charges which could result in a $1,000
fine. Keiser&apos;s wife says the community supports him.&quot;People who
don&apos;t even know him are offering to pay his fine,&quot;she said.

THE GIFT THAT KEEPS GIVING:&quot;It was truly the perfect gift,&quot;says Mary
Ann McGrath. Her husband had a bathroom constructed near the 10th
hole at the golf course where they play. Bill McGrath thought of the
present after hearing his wife complain about the lack of facilities
on the back nine. Others benefit too: both men&apos;s and women&apos;s latrines
are included.&quot;I told her it was something she could share with
family and friends, and something she could open and reopen,&quot;Bill
said. Mary Ann couldn&apos;t be happier.&quot;Gifts from spouses have to be

and Community Development Association performed free vasectomies on
&quot;hundreds&quot;of Thai men.&quot;Thais love to do good things to honor the
king,&quot;said Dr. Apichart Nirapathpongporn of the Association.&quot;A part
of the reason I got the vasectomy is that it&apos;s the king&apos;s birthday,&quot;
agreed Somdej Vanikabutra.&quot;It&apos;s a thing to be proud of when you

WOULD YOU LIKE FRIES WITH THAT? The new McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Minsk,
Belarus, is so popular, they had to beat the customers off with a
stick. Really. Police used night sticks to beat back about 4,000
people who descended on the new store after hearing rumors they would
be given free food. Meanwhile, Wendy&apos;s founder Dave Thomas is in
stable condition after a quadruple heart bypass. A spokesman for the
number-four burger chain says Thomas&apos; heart problems do not
constitute a problem for the company&apos;s image. Relating Thomas&apos;

HO HO HOLD ON!! Santa Claus flew in to see children in Lantana, Fla.,

Subject: The Conductor

There once was this guy who worked for the Railroad as a conductor named
Joe. Well, Joe was walking through the train, en route, collecting
tickets from the passengers. He comes to car 12, booth 3. In it was a man.

So, he asked him for his ticket:&quot;Excuse me sir, do have your ticket?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I am soooo sorry, I dropped it out the window by accident,&quot;he
replied.

&quot;Sorry sir, can&apos;t have any passengers without tickets.&quot;He grabbed him by
the
scruff of the neck and threw him out of the train. Well, he landed on the
tracks
and was run over by the train. Naturally, the conductor was arrested and
thrown
in jail. He was convicted of murder before a jury of his peers, and
sentenced to
death by electrocution.

The day of his execution came up, and he was asked what he would like for
his
last meal. He asks for a banana. They gave it to him, he ate it, received
his
last rites, and was escorted to the chair. The executioner strapped him in,
hooked everything up. Last, he threw the big switch once, and nothing
happened.
So, he did it again, and nothing happened. Well, by law the conductor was
legally dead, so they had to release him.

Oddly enough, the guy got a job on another railroad, as a conductor! One
day,
he was gathering tickets, and came to a booth with a little boy.&quot;Young
man,
do you have your ticket?&quot;, asked the conductor.

&quot;A-a-a, I&apos;m sorry, I ate it by mistake..&quot;, said the little boy.

And.. the same thing happened-- the boy was thrown off the train and
killed.
The guy was arrested, sentenced to death by electrocution. It came to his
last
day. The death row guard asked him what he would like for his meal. He
asked
for banana again. He ate it, and a priest gave him last rites.

He was escorted to the death chamber. This time, though, they were smart.
They
washed his hands to get rid of any banana slime, they washed up the chair.
Next, they placed him the chair, and hooked him up. The switch-puller
pulled
the switch once, and nothing happened. He then pulled it twice, and
nothing
happened, not even a single hair raising on the guy&apos;s chest.

Well, as the law says, they had to let him go...

Even more amazingly, he got a job on yet another railroad.

This time it was a rabbi. Same old stuff. Rabbi had no ticket (he forgot to
buy it). Guy threw him off the train, rabbi died. Guy was arrested,
convicted,
sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the guard asked him what he would like for a last meal, he asked for a
banana. He ate it, received last rites, and was escorted to the chamber.
However, this time the officials where going to get it right! They scrubbed
his body with a brillo pad. They scrubbed the chair with steel wool. They
tried the chair on a few other prisoners...

Okay, they strapped him in, and threw the switch once, nothing happened.
Threw the switch a second time, nothing happened. At this point the guy was
legally dead, etc, etc.

But, before the guy could leave, the executioner, extremely frustrated
(he&apos;d
seen this same guy three times already). asked,&quot;What is it with the
banana?!&quot;

The guy replied,&quot;I just like bananas.&quot;

So, the executioner screamed,&quot;THEN HOW COME YOU DON&apos;T DIE!!!!!&quot;

&quot;I dunno,&quot;replied the guy,&quot;I guess I&apos;m just not a very good conductor.&quot;

Subject: Good Times virus, Version 2.0

Virus Alert!!!

GoodTimes Virus, 2.0!!!


There&apos;s a new virus that will re-write your hard drive.
Not only that, but it will scramble any disks that are even
close to your computer. It will recalibrate your refrigerator&apos;s
coolness setting so all your ice cream goes melty. It will
demagnetize the strips on all your credit cards, screw up the
tracking on your television and use subspace field harmonics to
scratch any CD&apos;s you try to play.

It will give your ex-girl or boyfriend your new phone
number. It will mix Kool-aid into your fishtank. It will drink all
your wine and leave its socks out on the coffee table when there&apos;s
company coming over. It will put a dead squirrel in the back pocket of
your good pants and hide your car keys when you are late for work.

Goodtimes 2.0 will make you fall in love with a penguin. It
will give you nightmares about circus midgets. It will pour
sugar in your gas tank and shave off both your eyebrows while
dating your girl or boyfriend behind your back and billing the
dinner and hotel room to your Discover card.

It will seduce your grandmother. It does not matter if
she is dead; such is the power of Goodtimes 2.0. It reaches out
beyond the grave to sully those things we hold most dear.

It moves your car randomly around parking lots so you
can&apos;t find it. It will kick your dog. It will leave libidinous
messages on your boss&apos;s voice mail in your voice! It is insidious and
subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to behold. It is also a rather
interesting shade of mauve.

Goodtimes 2.0 will give you Dutch Elm disease. It will
leave the toilet seat up. It will make a batch of Methamphe-
tamine in your bathtub and then leave bacon cooking on
the stove while it goes out to chase gradeschoolers with
your new snowblower.

Goodtimes 2.0 will prompt your mother to call on Friday and
Saturday nights for two months after you make a new
girlfriend/boyfriend. It will place your wallet and keys on an
obscure shelf in the basement. It will emulate your face and stare
into the neighbor&apos;s bathroom window.

Goodtimes 2.0 has been linked to cancer in laboratory mice. 9 out
of 10 dentists recommend Goodtimes.

Goodtimes 2.0 will make your bloomers shrink two sizes, and it

Subject: Todays Top Stories, part XVII - Beavis and Butthead Make Millions

North Wilkesboro, North Carolina:

The toilet isn&apos;t always the end of the line, as an unfortunate drug suspect
learned when he allegedly tried to flush the evidence away, police said.

Officers heard the flush while searching a house for crack cocaine on
Saturday.

After learning that the house was not connected to the city&apos;s sewer system,
they opened the septic tank and found a plastic bag with 11 rocks of crack
cocaine, according to a police report.

With the smelly evidence in hand - or glove, anyway - police charged Glenn
Scott Anthony, 26, with possession of cocaine with intent to sell and
deliver.

The plan to get rid of the drugs would have worked with the right plumbing
- a sewer connection, Detective Ralph Pittman said.

&quot;It would have been gone,&quot;he said.

 
 

San Diego, California:

Moments before Iraqi soldiers captured Guy Hunter Jr. during the Persian
Gulf War, the Marine buried his wallet in the Kuwaiti desert so his family
would not be targeted by terrorists.

Six years later, the mud-soaked billfold appeared in Hunter&apos;s mailbox with
all its contents - three credit cards, his military identification, three
family photos and $47 in cash. A laborer had found it and sent it to the
Marines, who forwarded it to Hunter, now 52 and retired.

&quot;It was so strange,&quot;the former prisoner of war told The San Diego
Union-Tribune on Thursday from his home in Jacksonville, North Carolina&quot;It
seemed like a voice from the past suddenly spoke to you.&quot;

The package, dated October 19, contained a letter in broken English from
G.A.S. Santha, a laborer from Sri Lanka who works in Kuwait.

The Hunters received the wallet from Marine headquarters on December 13 and
sent Santha a reply the next day, offering thanks and extending an
invitation to him to visit the United States.

&quot;It came in a yellow envelope,&quot;said Hunter&apos;s wife, Mary.&quot;We opened it and
I said ... &apos;Honey, this is like finding a bottle with a message, only 10
times better!&apos; It was a funny thing; it was like `I Dream of Jeannie.&apos;&quot;

How cold is it in Europe now? So cold, that even the penguins are freezing.

A Dutch zoo is putting young blackfoot penguins, native to coastal South

The penguins can handle temperatures as low as 23 degrees, she said. But
temperatures in Amsterdam have hovered around 14 degrees for the last few

LOCKED DOOR MYSTERY: Chicago mystery writer Eugene Izzi was discovered
hanging by the neck outside the window of his 14th floor downtown
office. Izzi, who does research by going undercover to infiltrate
groups such as militias, was found with copies of death threats in
his pockets. He was wearing a bulletproof vest and was armed with a
gun, brass knuckles, and chemical spray. Friends say he was so afraid
for his safety that he had moved his family out of his house.&quot;He let
me listen to the voice mail&quot;of one of the threats, said one friend,
a former homicide detective.&quot;A woman said he&apos;d been found guilty ...
and he&apos;d be dead by hanging by the end of the year.&quot;But police said
the door to Izzy&apos;s office was locked from the inside, and are thus
calling his death a suicide.&quot;There&apos;s nothing to lead us to believe
it&apos;s a homicide,&quot;a Chicago police spokesman explained.

TRY, TRY AGAIN: A judge in Sardinia, Italy, has issued an injunction
against Francesco Brundu, 84, from marrying his fiancee, Luisa
Carneglias, 19. Brundu is actually fairly grateful -- in the hearing,
it came out that his young wife-to-be had a conviction for theft on
her record.&quot;That girl told me a pack of lies,&quot;he groused.&quot;Now I

NIGHT DEPOSIT: Doris Willis, 87, was checking her safe deposit box at
the Washington Mutual Bank in Tacoma, Wash., when the lights in the
vault went out and the door slammed shut.&quot;There I sat and I said,
&apos;Is the bank closed?&apos;,&quot;she remembers. Police went to the bank that
night in response to a silent alarm apparently triggered by her
unsuccessful search for the light switch, but left when all doors
were found to be secure. Fifteen hours later,&quot;when we opened [the
vault] we looked inside and we had a customer that was sitting on the
chair,&quot;a bank spokesman said. He added the bank&quot;plans to do
something nice for her.&quot;

DOWNLOAD: Margaret Anne Hunter of Alexandria, Virginia, said she met
Thorne Wesley Jameson Groves online, and the relationship fast
blossomed into romance. She said Groves claimed he had AIDS, and thus
couldn&apos;t consummate the relationship, but wanted to be happily
married before he died. The two indeed married, but Hunter quickly
became suspicious -- not only did none of Groves&apos; relatives come to
the wedding, but he never removed the bandages covering his chest --
for broken ribs suffered in a car accident, he said -- and he never
needed to visit the doctor or pay medical bills. When the truth came
out, that Groves is really Holly Anne Groves, a 26-year-old Texas
woman, Hunter did what Americans do best: she sued, asking for
$575,000 in damages for fraud and misrepresentation. The figure
includes the cost of the wedding, food, rent and cable TV. And her
online services bill.

FALSE IDENTITY II: Richard Minsky, 52, was arrested at a Boston, Mass.,
pay phone, police said, after he spent 90 minutes calling women in
the phone book at random to tell them he was holding loved ones at
gunpoint, and that the ransom was to have sex with him. In one case,
&quot;the guy told her, `We&apos;re holding a gun to your boyfriend&apos;s head, and
we&apos;re going to shoot him if you don&apos;t do as we tell you&apos;,&quot;a police
spokesman said. Minsky, who has been convicted of sex crimes in
several states, told her to meet him at a hotel wearing her
&quot;slinkiest outfit&quot;. She did as she was told, but called police from
her car on the way. Minsky&apos;s calls were traced to one of three pay
phones at the hotel. Detectives stepped up to the other two and
listened and watched as Minsky made more calls. He has been charged
with three counts of attempted extortion and assault, but Minsky&apos;s
attorney said the case is&quot;weak&quot;. Thomas Henneberry said his client
&quot;was arrested with change in his pocket. He also could have been
running to catch a train.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Worst &apos;96 Public Relations Gaffes
Source: PR Newswire
Following is a list of the year&apos;s worst public relations gaffes as
reported by Fineman Associates Public Relations.

1) America West Airlines: One of its flights was turned back in mid
air to pick up the California Angels baseball team whose flight has
been grounded. The passengers didn&apos;t seem to mind the delay and looked
forward to sharing their plane with the Angels. That is until they were
kicked off the plane to make room for the team.

2) R.J. Reynolds chairman Charles Harper: The chairman was asked
about children and second-hand smoke. He responded that children
don&apos;t like smoky rooms and they leave. When told that infants can&apos;t
leave, Harper said,&quot;At some point, they will learn to crawl.&quot;This
statement brought outrage from the public.

3) WPYX-FM, Latham, N.Y.: The radio station was sued for $300,000
for airing the name and place of employment of the woman who won the
&quot;Ugliest Bride&quot;contest organized by the station.

4) Southwest Elementary School, Lexington, N.C.: School officials
charged a first-grade boy with sexual harassment for kissing a girl
classmate.

5) Joe Klein, Newsweek, CBS reporter, anonymous author: Klein lied
to fellow journalists and the world when he denied being the author of
the book&quot;Primary Colors.&quot;Later, he admitted being the author and as
a result got fired.

6) Marge Schott, Cincinnati Reds baseball team owner: During the
team&apos;s opener one of the empires collapsed and died of a heart attack
in the first inning. Schott was quoted as saying:&quot;Why are they calling
the game? Why can&apos;t they play with just two umpires?!&quot;

7) Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America: The Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission sued Mitsubishi for repeated violations of
sexual harassment practices. Mitsubishi gave its employees a choice:
picket (with pay) the EEOC office or spend the day in a sexual
harassment workshop. More than 2,000 employees opted to join the
parade. Their strategy backfired in the eyes of the public.

8) American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP):
ASCAP sent out a letter to all Girl and Boy Scouts summer camps
requesting that a fee be paid for the use of ASCAP&apos;s song. Some Scouts
camps refused to pay and stopped all their campfire singing. Thanks to
national media exposure, ASCAP retracted their original intention.

9) Nationwide Mutual Insurance, Columbus, Ohio: David Mears won
the grand prize by submitting the best slogan in a contest sponsored by
Nationwide. The prize: two Mercedes and a trip around the world.
However, Nationwide refused to hand Mears the prize, claiming it was
all a joke. Mears sued the company and is now enjoying his around the
world voyage.

Subject: HMO&apos;s For Dummies

Q. What does HMO stand for?
A. This is actually a variation of the phrase,&quot;Hey, Moe!&quot;Its roots go
back to a concept pioneered by Doctor Moe Howard, who discovered
that a patient could be made to forget about the pain in his foot if he
was
poked hard enough in the eyes. Modern practice replaces the physical
finger poke with hi-tech equivalents such as voice mail and referral
slips, but the result remains the same.

Q. Do all diagnostic procedures require pre-certification?
A. No. Only those you need.

Q. I just joined a new HMO. How difficult will it be to choose the doctor
I want?
A. Just slightly more difficult than choosing your parents. Your
insurer will provide you with a book listing all the doctors who were
participating in the plan at the time the information was gathered.
These doctors basically fall into two categories -- those who are no
longer accepting new patients, and those who will see you but are no
longer part of the plan. But don&apos;t worry -- the remaining doctor who
is still in the plan and accepting new patients has an office just a
half day&apos;s drive away!

Q. What are pre-existing conditions?
A. This is a phrase used by the grammatically challenged when they
want to talk about existing conditions. Unfortunately, we appear to
be pre-stuck with it.

Q. Well, can I get coverage for my pre-existing conditions?
A. Certainly, as long as they don&apos;t require any treatment.

Q. What happens if I want to try alternative forms of medicine?
A. You&apos;ll need to find alternative forms of payment.

Q. My pharmacy plan only covers generic drugs, but I need the name
brand. I tried the generic medication, but it gave me a stomach
ache. What should I do?
A. Poke yourself in the eye.

Q. I have an 80/20 plan with a $200 deductible and a $2,000 yearly
cap. My insurer reimbursed the doctor for my out-patient surgery,
but I&apos;d already paid my bill. What should I do?
A. You have two choices. Your doctor can sign the reimbursement
check over to you, or you can ask him to invest the money for you in
one of those great offers that only doctors and dentists hear about,
like windmill farms or frog hatcheries.

Q. What should I do if I get sick while traveling?
A. Try sitting in a different part of the bus.

Q. No, I mean what if I&apos;m away from home and I get sick?
A. You really shouldn&apos;t do that. You&apos;ll have a hard time seeing
your primary care physician. It&apos;s best to wait until you return, and
then get sick.

Q. I think I need to see a specialist, but my doctor insists he can
handle my problem. Can a general practitioner really perform a
heart transplant right in his office?
A. Hard to say, but considering that all you&apos;re risking is the $10
co-payment, there&apos;s no harm giving him a shot at it.

Q. What accounts for the largest portion of health care costs?
A. Doctors trying to recoup their investment losses.

Q. Will health care be any different in the next century?
A. No, but if you call right now, you might get an appointment by then.
