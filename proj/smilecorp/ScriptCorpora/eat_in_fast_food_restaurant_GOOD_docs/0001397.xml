Manchester City have confirmed plans for a victory parade and party for fans to celebrate their FA Cup win.

Roberto Mancini and his team will parade the cup from an open-top bus before a fans&apos;event at the City of Manchester Stadium, on 23 May.

They are expected to address about 10,000 fans outside Manchester Town Hall at 1800 BST, before fans cheer them along on the parade to Eastlands.

A free, ticketed event will then be held at the stadium for fans.

It will include appearances from former players and special guests, and will end in a firework display.

The event is being organised by Manchester City Council, the club and Greater Manchester Police.
 &apos;Memorable evening&apos; 
Police are expecting about 100,000 fans to attend and will have about 400 officers, including mounted patrols, on duty.

Tram services will be affected and there will be extensive road closures in the city centre.

Assistant Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, of Greater Manchester Police, said:&quot;GMP wholeheartedly support the parade and have been working very closely with the city council and the club to make sure we can put on an enjoyable event.

&quot;We are treating it as a celebration not only of the club&apos;s success but also how it reflects on the wider success this brings to Manchester as a city and region.

&quot;The message is we want people to come and enjoy themselves and have a memorable evening but behave sensibly and do not let the club, themselves or the city down.&quot;

Man City&apos;s 1-0 victory over Stoke City in the FA Cup final, on Saturday, ended a 35-year trophy drought for the club, which is now the world&apos;s richest.

A second victory parade will be held on Monday 30 May for City&apos;s rivals Manchester United.
