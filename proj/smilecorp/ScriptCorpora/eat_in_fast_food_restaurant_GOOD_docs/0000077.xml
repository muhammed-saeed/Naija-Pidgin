 Woman&apos;s body found in south-side wash 

A woman was found dead Monday in a wash near South Palo Verde
Road and Interstate 10.

Deputies went to the area at 2:30 p.m. after receiving a 911
call from someone at a pay telephone at a nearby fast-food
restaurant, said Deputy Dawn Barkman, a Pima County Sheriff&apos;s
Department spokeswoman.

Detectives termed the death &quot;suspicious,&quot; Barkman said.

The woman&apos;s identity is unknown, and an autopsy is scheduled
today at the county Medical Examiner&apos;s Office, Barkman said.

 3 men arrested in robbery, carjack spree 

Police arrested three men in connection with a string of Sunday
robberies.

Axel Jaimez, 26, Robert Cota, 18, and Olivaz Cruz, 21, were
arrested Sunday on felony charges related to robbery and auto
theft, said Sgt. Maria Hawke, a Tucson police spokeswoman.

Hawke gave this account in a news release:

The first incident happened shortly after 4:30 a.m. near East
Adams Street and North Bentley Avenue when three men stole a white
2004 Chrysler Sebring convertible from a group of four women
leaving a Halloween party.

The men flashed handguns at the women and demanded the car keys
as well as purses and cellphones.

About 7:15 p.m., two men robbed the owner of El Kora hot dog
stand, near South Sixth Avenue and West Bilby Road, at gunpoint.
The owner said they drove up in a Chrysler convertible.

Then, police received a carjacking call at 8:50 p.m. near South
12th Avenue and West 39th Street. In that incident, two men, one of
whom flashed a handgun, drove up in a Chrysler convertible,
confronting two men at their vehicle. The robbers demanded car
keys, wallets and cellphones. One drove away in the victims&apos; gray
2005 Nissan Altima, which was later abandoned near South 12th
Avenue and West Ajo Way.

Police saw the Chrysler convertible near East Irvington Road and
South Sixth Avenue about 9:30 p.m., and briefly chased the car
until the driver crashed. Police caught two men, and a third, who
ran away, was soon found and arrested. The three were booked into
the Pima County jail.

 Worker accused of indecent exposure 

A man was arrested Sunday on suspicion of exposing himself to a
child at an east-side restaurant.

Elias Guerrero, 24, an employee of Wing Factory at 6330 E. Golf
Links Road, lifted up his shirt, exposing himself to a 9-year-old
girl, said Sgt. Maria Hawke, a Tucson Police Department
spokeswoman, in a news release. The girl was at the restaurant with
her family but had gone to the counter alone to ask for sauce.

Guerrero was booked into the Pima County jail. He has a history
of exposing himself and is registered as a Level 3 sex offender in
California, police said.

 Deputies seek woman who robbed bank 

Pima County sheriff&apos;s deputies are looking for a woman suspected
of robbing the Compass Bank branch inside Albertson&apos;s at 5085 N. La
Cañada Drive at 4 p.m. Thursday.

The woman is described as black, 40 to 45 years old, and
5-feet-4-inches tall, with black hair, said Deputy Erin Gibson, a
spokeswoman, in a news release.

A witness saw a woman of that description get into a sport
utility vehicle that drove north on La Cañada Drive. Investigators
ask that anyone with information call 911 or 88-CRIME.
