Coronado Restaurants
for the Whole Family

Coronado restaurants abound! Orange Avenue is the main street in this quaint island community where you can find anything from fast food to local pizzerias to fine dining. The following Coronado restaurants have met the following criteria:

1. The food has to be good.
2. The location and ambiance has to be nice, scenic, or convenient.
3. The meal can&apos;t break the bank.

So drumroll please...here are our favorite Coronado restaurants to eat for the family:

 Il Fornaio - Whenever someone comes here from out of town, we take them to Il Fornaio. The view from the restaurant is magnificent whether you eat inside or outside on the patio. With a head-on view of downtown San Diego, this restaurant&apos;s location can&apos;t be beat. Add to that the beautiful design of the restaurant&apos;s interior and the delicious Italian food and you&apos;ve got a winner!








 
The bread served before your meal is so good...try the olive loaf, mmm! Fill up on bread and take the rest of your entree home or split it with your spouse. The kid&apos;s menu is good. Our kids&apos; favorite is macaroni and cheese. Look, even daddy wants some!

Il Fornaio is located next to Ferry Landing at:
1333 First Street
Coronado, CA 92118
619-437-4911





 
 Miguel&apos;s Cocina Mexican Food - Owned by the same company as the Brigantine Restaurant, Miguel&apos;s is a charming place to eat outdoors. You&apos;ll wonder where the restaurant is as you follow a path to a courtyard. But then you will see the line for Miguel&apos;s! The atmosphere is casual and fun, perfect for kids. The chips and salsa are delicious and the menu has lots of good items like carne asada, fish tacos, shrimp fajitas, and burritos.

If it&apos;s too crowded, just ask someone to point you to Miguel&apos;s little brother, Miguelito&apos;s. After Miguel&apos;s huge success, they opened this restaurant in the same quaint shopping center. You won&apos;t have to wait which is the best reason to try Miguelito&apos;s. But there are many other good reasons to try: a delicious and reasonably priced menu, friendly staff, and a one-of-a-kind dining room that&apos;s alos a boutique and gallery.









 



Miguel&apos;s Cocina is located at:
1351 Orange Avenue
Coronado, CA 92118
619-437-4237

Miguelito&apos;s is located at:
1142 Adella Avenue
Coronado, CA 92118
619-437-8578



 
 Alexander&apos;s Pizza - This local pizzeria has been voted Coronado&apos;s Best Pizza by the readers of Coronado Lifestyle Magazine. This local Coronado restaurant prepares their dough and toppings fresh daily. In addition to pizzas like King Alexander, Hawaiian and the Herbivore Pizza, they have Hot&apos;N Spicy or Honey Barbeque Wings, oven-baked subs, calzones, lasagna, salads and chocolate chip cookies.





 Click here to see Alexander&apos;s delicious pizzas and prices. 

Alexander&apos;s has indoor and patio-dining, and free parking in the rear of the restaurant. It&apos;s conveniently located across the street from Von&apos;s, the island&apos;s largest grocery store.

Alexander&apos;s Pizza is located at:
849 Orange Avenue
Coronado, CA 92118
619-435-5747


 
 Panera Bread - The downside to Panera Bread is that it is a chain, so don&apos;t come here if you have a Panera Bread near your home. But if you&apos;ve never been, it&apos;s worth a try.

The food is delicious and the service is pretty fast. It&apos;s like going to an upscale fast food restaurant. You order your food from the plentiful menu and get a number. Then find a seat in the spacious and well-designed dining area and your food will be brought out to you. Now that they don&apos;t do that at McDonalds!

Your kids will definitely like their Grilled Cheese, PB&amp;J;, or Kid&apos;s Deli Sandwich, served on whole grain bread, and sides like squeezable yogurt, chips or an apple.

My favorite is the Frontega Chicken Panini: smoked white meat chicken, mozzarella, tomatoes, red onions, chopped basil and chipolte mayo, grilled hot on Focaccia bread.

The bakery items will make your mouth water. There&apos;s also specialty soups, hand-tossed salads, and drinks like the Caramel Frozen Drink or the Low-Fat Strawberry Smoothie.

Panera Bread is located at:
980 Orange Avenue
Coronado, CA 92118
619-437-4288






 

 
 Ferry Landing Marketplace -
Your family will love Ferry Landing, whether you arrive by Coronado by ferry, or just watch the ferry come in.

Ferry Landing is located at
1201 First St. at &quot;B&quot; Ave
Coronado, CA 92118

 Click here for ferry prices. 

Ferry Landing has a fun collection of shops, art galleries, sit-down restaurants and fast eateries. Your kids will love running around, playing in the sand, and biking.



 Check out this funny bike for your family that you can rent at Bikes&amp;Beyond, 619-435-7180. It&apos;s more work than it looks like when you hit a hill.

Our favorite places for eats and treats in Ferry Landing:

 Spiro Gyros - Greek and Mediterranean food
619-435-1225

 Bay Beach Cafe - Casual dining indoors or on the sundeck, American food
619-435-4900

 Cold Stone Creamery - Ice cream with mix-ins
619-437-6920








 
 Tartine - Just across the street from Ferry Landing, you&apos;ll find Tartine, a sublime place for dessert. If you think chocolate mousse, nutty banana torte, or pavlova (chewy meringue filled with whipped cream and topped with seasonal fruit) sounds good, you&apos;ll think me for this tip. After I met a weight loss goal, I headed straight for Tartine&apos;s to enjoy their chocolate mousse...now that&apos;s the way to celebrate!

Tartine&apos;s also serves delicious sandwiches with a side of mixed greens for about $7. Created by three local women who wanted to bring a taste of Europe to the Coronado community, Tartine will be a highlight for your tastebuds! Coronado Restaurants: Click here to read Tartine&apos;s menu.
