 Tom’s Original Hot Dogs 

 leave a comment» 
 
 

 Heugasse (corner of Hauptstraße 154) 69117 Heidelberg 

Quintessential American food – apple pie, meatloaf, fried chicken, macaroni&amp;cheese, Philly cheese steak, and hamburgers and fries.  Oh, and don’t forget the hot dogs!  Despite being surrounded by hundreds of different types of German sausages and delicious breads, you would be hard pressed to find this classic American fare in Germany.  The closest thing to an American hot dog might possibly be Bratwurst or Würstchen mit Brötchen, but of course you don’t get all of the nifty condiments as you would on a hot dog.

Tom’s Original Hot Dogs will satiate your cravings for this ultimate all-American snack.  Forget the fancy decorations and elegant seating arrangements.  The focus in this fast food restaurant is solely placed on the hot dog.  There is a tiny service counter – essentially a hot dog cart–where the worker places the bun onto a wrapper and the wiener inside the bun.  As the hot dogs are pre-boiled and held warm in water until service, the process is simple and quick.

 

7 containers, full of condiments, line a brick wall.  Sweet green relish, original relish, sweet yellow corn relish, and red pepper relish make up the relish varieties.  Jalapeño rings, as well as red pepper rings, can be added onto your hot dog.  Toasted onions are highly recommended – they are crunchy and sweet.  Naturally, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise bottles are available on the table.  Seating is limited to two bar stools.  A wooden book shelf functions as a counter table.  There is also an oil drum that can be used as a table.

 

The hot dog itself tastes great.  Though it is a bit small, it has a good casing and the inside of the dog has a nice texture.  It is nothing like the abomination found in ‘American style’ hot dogs sold at the local German supermarkets.  The buns are also different than the standard plain hot dog bun.  Cornmeal is dusted on top of the buns here at Tom’s, adding even more taste and flavor.  The bun is warmed up and has a nice, delicate texture that complements the juicy hot dog extremely well.

 

If you think 1,99 € is expensive for a hot dog, consider this: 6 ‘American style’ hot dogs, sold in a jar in brine, cost around 2,79 € at a German supermarket.  A package of 4 plain hot dog buns can be bought for 0,99 €.  Tack on the cost of condiments and you will already be around 1 euro per dog.  Now, taking into account the fact that these poor imitations you find at the supermarkets don’t even come close to the hot dogs at Tom’s Original Hot Dogs, 1,99 isn’t so bad after all.

 

Besides hot dogs, there are also bags of chips available for purchase.  Habanero chili chips, manufactured by the local Chili Food Company in Bad Dürkheim, boast being produced without flavor enhancers or other artificial additives.  The chips are also labeled as ‘extrem scharf’ (‘extremely spicy’) with a ‘Schärfe Grad: 8‘ (a heat level of 8).  Personally, the chips aren’t terribly spicy – they merely leave a tingling sensation afterwards.  In fact, they start to grow on you after eating just a few.  They taste like kettle chips with its distinctive crisp texture.  Considering that there aren’t any added ingredients – only potatoes, sunflower oil, a blend of spices, and habanero chilis – these chips are well worth a try.

 

Moreover, the list of drinks is quite unique here.  Unless you have connections to the U.S. army, in which case you can obtain them at the local commissary, finding popular American soft drinks like A&amp;W root beer, Mountain Dew, and Dr. Pepper is as difficult as locating a good Mexican restaurant here in Germany – it’s almost close to impossible.  In addition to varieties of these beverages, you can also find Big Red soda and NOS energy drinks.  The cost of these drinks is fairly reasonable – a can costs about 2 €.

Of course, there is still room for improvement.  The selection of potato chips could use some work.  Maybe importing in some Lay’s potato chips will solve this problem.  Also, the choice of condiments is somewhat lacking.  If they added some fresh lettuce and tomatoes, pickles, chopped onions, bacon, or even chili and cheese sauce, it would be much appreciated and would attract an even larger crowd.  Heck, visiting this hot dog joint had me yearning for corn dogs.  Selling fries could be a good idea.  Fries with toasted onions and jalapeños would make an excellent combination.  The list of possibilities just goes on and on.

 

But as is, Tom’s Original Hot Dogs is quite possibly the only place in town where you can find hot dogs, living up to their slogan ‘The Hottest Dogs in Town.’  Tom’s Original Hot Dogs is a great place to pop in for a quick, inexpensive hot dog or two and a cool, refreshing American soda.  Just look for the American themed store off of the Hauptstraße!

 . 

 Summary :

Situated just off of the Heidelberg Hauptstraße, Tom’s Original Hot Dogs is a very small fast food restaurant focusing exclusively on one traditional American favorite – hot dogs.  A good selection of typical hot dog condiments is provided.  Hard to find American soft drink beverages, including A&amp;W Root Beer, Mountain Dew, and Dr. Pepper, imported from the United States, can also be found.  There are also habanero chips as well as insanely spicy hot sauces sold in bottles.  1 hot dog costs 1,99 €.

Overall – 4.5 stars

 McDonald’s 

 with one comment 
 
 

 Willy-Brandt-Platz 4 69115 Heidelberg 

‘Ich liebe es’ – ‘I’m loving it’ in German.  If you’re a big fan of McDonald’s, you will certainly be saying this catch phrase in whatever language while you’re here.  After all, the food at a German McDonald’s tastes quite similar to its equivalent in the United States.  Sure, some of the items have different names and there are a few discrepancies in terms of service and restaurant layout.  But the most important aspect – the food – is markedly similar in sight, aroma, and taste.

Starting off with the appearance of the restaurant, the exterior looks exactly like any McDonald’s would in America.  Of course, there aren’t any drive-thru windows or a huge children’s playground due to the size of the building and given the location near the main train station in Heidelberg.  Step inside through the doors and the place is remarkable in the eyes of an American.  Clean, modern, stylish, and posh.  The walls are artsy and a sight to see.  There are different styles of tables and chairs.  The bar stools aren’t your typical type – they are artistic and unique.  The main color scheme in the restaurant is the traditional McDonald’s yellow and red, but also a touch of brown reflecting the McCafé influence.  Surprisingly, there are two counters at this Heidelberg McDonald’s location – one for the McCafé and another for the actual McDonald’s fast food.  Two different menus, two separate cashier areas.  McCafé is itself a café, serving up coffee and hot drinks, along with scrumptious cakes and cookies.  It’s as if there are two eateries in one.

 

 

As stated above, there aren’t any surprises when it comes to the food.  Well, maybe a couple, but the American menu has, for the most part, made it to Germany.  German McDonald’s restaurants have value menus called ‘McMenus,’ in which you can choose from a number of items to make up your meal.  As an example, you could get a Big Mac, a Filet-O-Fish, a McRib, 9 pieces of Chicken Nuggets, or a Hamburger Royal TS (similar to a quarter pounder with cheese), an order of fries or a side garden salad, and a soft drink.  The large portion costs 5,59 Euros, which is a tad expensive.  Even the concept of the dollar menu has traveled over the Atlantic, albeit it is of course termed the Euro menu.  On this inexpensive menu, you can find cheeseburgers, hamburgers, chicken burgers, a garden salad, McSundaes (with chocolate or caramel), a small soft drink, small cappuccino, or an apple turnover.  Notable items missing from the German menu are the Angus burgers and Chicken Selects chicken strips.  For breakfast, biscuits are nowhere to be found.  Some unique items found here in Germany are curry chicken sandwiches, a burger called the Big Rosti (Rosti being a large hash brown patty), and curry dipping sauces.

 

The McRib features a pork patty, slathered in a thick, delicious BBQ sauce, topped with white onions and a couple of pickles, and sandwiched between two sandwich rolls.  Although it’s easy to tell that it has been previously frozen, the McRib sandwich tastes pretty good.  Again, it’s what you would find in America.  The French Fries at McDonald’s are also characteristic.  Unfortunately, though, you are only given one condiment packet (usually ketchup or mayonnaise with fries) – each extra one costs money.  Although the packet is larger than American ones, it’s still not enough.

 

The Chicken Nuggets taste slightly different than those found in the United States.  Maybe it’s due to the chicken or the breading, but there is a minor difference in taste and texture.  Regardless, the breading is crisp and the chicken is juicy inside.  Again, you are only given one dipping sauce with your nuggets, which can be problematic for those heavy dippers.  Even the BBQ sauce, with its sweet and tangy flavor, tastes American.  A six pack of nuggets will set you back 3,29 euros, so it’s nothing to laugh about.

 

A new item on the German menu is the Veggie Burger.  Priced at 1,10 euros, it’s a great value for vegetarians or health conscious individuals.  The patty appears to be made up of potatoes and carrots, bound together by egg.  There are also some corn kernels inside as well.  By itself, the veggie patty has an unusual taste.  However, topped with a slice of cheese, shredded lettuce, and a good amount of mayo, the veggie burger is good overall.  Not spectacular, but decent for the price.

 

Unexpectedly, the apple turnover (Apfeltasche) is ten times better than the American McDonald’s apple pie.  The German version has a crisp, flaky crust and is freshly baked with a warm apple filling.  Think Kentucky Fried Chicken apple turnovers, but larger.  Clearly, it tastes a lot better than the cardboard abomination of an apple pie found at an American McDonald’s.

If you’re looking for American tasting fast food in Germany, McDonald’s is the place to go.  Essentially all of the menu items taste more or less like the American counterpart.  While you may have to pay more than you normally would for a McDonald’s meal, it is enough to satisfy that one month long craving.  ‘I’m loving it!’  Or better yet – ‘Ich liebe es!’

 . 

 Summary :

McDonald’s is an internationally recognizable American fast food chain serving up burgers, fries, salads, chicken products, and desserts.  McCafé coffee and sweets also served inside, with a separate cashier and counter.  Stylish, modern dining area.  A bit expensive in comparison to American McDonald’s restaurant chains, but tastes similar (with a few exceptions).  Free drink refills at this location.

Overall – 4.5 stars

 McRib – 4.5/5 Chicken Nuggets – 4.5/5 Veggie Burger – 4/5 French Fries – 4/5 Apple Pie (Apfeltasche) – 5/5 Service – 5/5

 Kentucky Fried Chicken 

 leave a comment» 
 
 

 Möhlstraße 3 68165 Mannheim 

What’s KFC’s motto here in Germany?  No, not ‘finger lickin’ good.’  It’s not ‘We do chicken right.’  But rather, ‘Republic of Fresh.’  An odd name, indeed, but KFC does live up to this name – the chicken is definitely served fresh, warm, and crisp!

My monthly excursion to American fast food joints in Germany continues to the city of Mannheim, where the nearest KFC can be found.  Located near the Mannheim planetarium, this branch is quite large, equipped with a drive thru and a poor looking, but decent, kids area outside.  The long journey out to the sole Kentucky Fried Chicken in the area is, however, definitely worth it!

 

Inside, the KFC in Mannheim is surprisingly modern (as is the case with many other American fast food restaurant chains in Germany!).  The atmosphere and environment is on par with casual restaurants in the States.  There’s even a flat screen television hanging on the wall, playing classic American popular music videos.  Of course, being a fast food restaurant, there is an ordering counter with a large menu board, albeit the menu is extremely difficult to read due to the small printing.  Even people with glasses might have a tough time reading off the board.  Who thought it was a good idea to use such tiny letters, anyways?

 

In Germany, it appears that the chicken sandwiches and wraps are a fairly new phenomenon as many of them are featured and advertised on the board.  Aside from those items, you have your selection of chicken (original recipe or spicy), hot wings, chicken strips, salads, and sides.  There are no honey BBQ wings here – only regular hot wings.  The list of sauces doesn’t even include BBQ, just ketchup, mayonnaise, gravy, and salad dressing.

 

Unfortunately, the assortment of side dishes is especially limited.  Looking for macaroni and cheese?  Baked beans?  If so, you will be deeply disappointed.  German KFC restaurants only have mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, corn on the cob, and French fries (also chili cheese fries).  That’s it.  Oh and there are no biscuits too!  It’s like half of the items you would typically find at an American Kentucky Fried Chicken didn’t make it across the Atlantic.  For dessert, they don’t offer chocolate chip cakes, strawberry shortcake parfaits, or apple turnovers.  No.  Surprisingly, the KFC chains in Germany have donuts and muffins.  More about this later!  One bright spot about KFC, though, is the availability of free refills for drinks – something missing at other fast food chains, like McDonald’s, here in Germany.

 

Compared to the chicken at KFC in the United States, the buckets can get quite expensive.  Fortunately, if you plan correctly, you can find coupons on the company website and print them out beforehand.  The chicken here is quite similar in taste and texture to that in America.  The secret original recipe seasonings penetrate the skin and meat extremely well.  Of course, the skin is crisp and mouthwatering.  Definitely brings back memories of home.  The hot wings are also crunchy on the outside, juicy and tasty on the inside.  There is also a slight hint of spiciness in each wing, exactly the way it should be.  Sadly, the mashed potatoes aren’t on the same level as the stuff people are accustomed to back home.  They are creamier and puréed, but just taste different.  The potatoes are yellow instead of the white spuds often used in the States.  Gravy is just gravy.

 

For dessert, a donut or a muffin costs a whopping 1,50 Euros.  Although the chocolate muffin is sweet and delectable (cake like texture, with a peanut butter filling in the middle), the cost is difficult to swallow.

Overall, the most important item on the menu at KFC – the chicken – is done very well and is comparable in quality, taste, and texture to what an American is looking for.  However, the limited selection of side orders and the costs are two factors that are difficult to ignore.  While there are some surprises (the donuts and muffins being the main ones), it’s hard to make up for the lack of items.

 . 

 Summary :

Kentucky Fried Chicken is an American fast food restaurant chain primarily selling chicken and southern style side dishes.  A tad on the expensive side.

Overall – 4 stars

 Dunkin’ Donuts 

 leave a comment» 
 
 

 Konrad Adenauer Platz 14 40210 Düsseldorf (im Hauptbahnhof) 

The holiday season has come and gone, with many people overfilling on sweets during the time spent with family and friends.  Cakes, cookies, and candies – typical holiday treats.  This isn’t just limited to the United States: in Germany, for example, traditional German spiced cakes and cookies (Spekulatius), fruitcakes (Stollen), and various confections and chocolates turn up only during the winter holidays.  But why stick to tradition?  A year-round deep-fried delight that fulfills the duty of sweet treats should be equally associated with holiday cheer.  The sugary, colorful glaze on top and the scent of a freshly fried donut is oftentimes enough to bring a smile to anyone’s face (especially Homer Simpson!).

 

Although the location is towards the back of the main train station in Düsseldorf (near platforms 16/17), the bright orange and pink lights of the Dunkin’ Donuts stand will easily catch your attention from a distance.  A simple glance at the vivid, artistic doughy creations is enough to attract interest and curiosity.  Moreover, some the names associated with these fried fritters – Blue Sky, Lemon Spirit, and Apple Lifting – are quite creative.

 

The Blue Sky donut has a bright calming blue hue on top of the lightly glazed doughnut.  Enough to make you sing Irving Berlin’s “Blue Skies”?  Fat chance.   The frosting makes you think it tastes like blueberries, or something fresh and sunny, but it’s just eye candy – sweet frosting with added color.  For winter, Dunkin’ Donuts sells a red glazed donut called Balthasar.  The frosting tastes sort of like cherries – definitely tastier and a sweeter than the Blue Sky donut.  A single donut costs 1,30 €.

 

Like most donut stores, Dunkin’ Donuts sells doughnut holes – small doughnuts in the shape of spheres.  Rather than the generic name “doughnut holes”, they are given the cute name “Munchkins” at Dunkin’ Donuts.  At this location, they have a variety of Munchkins to choose from – glazed, chocolate glazed, sugared with a chocolate and peanut butter filling, powdered with Bavarian crème inside, among others.  The glazed Munchkin is like a normal glazed doughnut, not too sweet as you might expect.  The sugared one, with the chocolate and peanut butter mixture, is a bit gooey – reminds me of a dog eating peanut butter.  Personal favorites are the powdered ones and the glazed chocolate – both are delicious.  The custard glaze within the powdered Munchkin is a tad sweet, but complements the dough extremely well.  Each one has a good amount of filling.  The glazed chocolate is sort of like a mini chocolate muffin – with the glaze, it has the sweetness of a brownie.  A truly yummy dessert.  And, at1,99 € for a bag of six Munchkins, it’s not too bad for a quick snack.

Grab a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate with your doughnuts and you are set for breakfast.  Or lunch.  Or dessert.  Or a quick snack in between meals.  You can never go wrong with donuts, especially Dunkin’ Donuts!

 . 

 Summary :

An American donut chain with various locations in Germany, Dunkin’ Donuts offers delectable donuts and hot and cold drinks that will certainly satisfy your sweet tooth!  A must stop for travelers and residents alike yearning for something American.

Overall – 4.5 stars

 Pizza Hut 

 leave a comment» 
 
 

 Hauptstraße 111 69117 Heidelberg 

Pizza Hut.  Arguably one of the most popular fast food restaurant chains in the United States.  But how does the tomato sauce compare in another country?  Does the pizza taste better as you get closer to Italy – the birthplace of pizza?  What about the preparation of chicken wings in Germany?  Anything unusual about Pizza Hut in Deutschland?

 

Walk inside this Pizza Hut for the first time and you might feel a bit lost.  There are no cash registers to walk up to, no service counters to wait in line for.  It might take a moment for you to realize that Pizza Hut here is not your quintessential fast food joint like in the States, but rather an actual sit-down and order restaurant.  One glance inside and you will surely be amazed at how elegant the restaurant looks.  The dining area is so upscale and trendy – almost enough to qualify as fine-dining.  There are plenty of tables–dark brown polished wooden tables–here, enough to accommodate large parties and families.  Silverware awaits you at your table.  There is even an open service counter window through which diners can see the kitchen staff at work.  This alone definitely makes dining here an exciting experience.

The menu at this Pizza Hut is, unexpectedly, rather extensive.  There are a large number of appetizers, including country potatoes, crispy mushrooms, quesadillas, chicken sticks, and chicken wings.  In addition to your typical types of pasta, lasagna and gratins are also offered.  What makes Pizza Hut here unique is the variety of desserts listed on the menu.  Not only can you order hot pancakes and Belgian waffles here, but also donuts, Panna Cotta, and ice cream.  Wine and beer are also served up.

 

Order the 2,90 € chicken wings and you get 6 hot pieces – 3 drummettes and 3 wings – a choice of dipping sauce (Sour Cream, Barbecue, Guacamole, Ketchup, or Mayo), and a towelette.  Forget to mention your desired dip and you will get BBQ – which is a bit smoky and sweet.  Nothing spectacular about the presentation of the dish, but that’s expected.  The chicken wings are seasoned well and taste perfectly fine without any sauce.  Think miniature rotisserie chicken wings.  Of course, add on the sauce and the flavor changes drastically.  Unfortunately, Pizza Hut in Germany does not offer Buffalo styled wings so you will surely be disappointed if you want something spicy.

The pizzas at a German Pizza Hut are similar to the pies back home.  Naturally, a wide variety of toppings are available, in addition to a select number of crusts (pan pizza, New York style, and stuffed crust).

 

Ask for a Margherita pan pizza and you will essentially get a cheese pizza.  The mozzarella cheese is bubbly, gooey, and delicious; the pizza is cooked fresh and served steaming hot in a pizza tray.  The texture of the dough is nice and fluffy–delicate and delectable.  Crust is crisp.  Surprisingly, the tomato sauce in Germany has the same taste as in the US.  A normal sized pizza is approximately 23 cm, a bit larger than a personal pan pizza.  At 4,50 € it is a reasonably priced pie that can easily be shared by two people.

Pizza Hut will easily satisfy your cravings for something simple, familiar, and delicious.  Stop by for the food and sit down for an amazingly pleasant dining experience.

 . 

 Summary :

Pizza Hut is an American pizza restaurant chain serving a large variety of pizzas, along with an assortment of side dishes including pasta, salad, chicken wings, garlic bread, and desserts.  Great value for the price.
 Hours: Monday – Thursday 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM Friday, Saturday 11:00 AM – 1:00 AM Sunday 12:00 PM – 11:00 PM

You may be wondering why I ate at a Subway in Germany.  After all, there are so many varieties of food to choose from here.  Well, simply put, I just wanted to observe the differences (if any) between Subways in America and in Deutschland.

After stopping by the Subway on the Hauptstraße late this afternoon, I can confirm that there aren’t many differences.  The sandwiches are made fresh, right before your eyes.  When you order your sub, the employee asks which type of bread you want, questions whether you want it toasted, if you want all the vegetables (green bell peppers, pickles, sliced cucumbers, red onions, chopped green lettuce, sliced tomatoes, black olives, and jalapeños) in it, and finally asks which type of sauce you desire.  Sauce?  Well, this last part was the only slight variation that I noticed (more explained below!).

They also sell a variety of potato chips here.  Walkers, owned by Frito-Lay, is the main brand sold here with typical flavors such as salt&amp;vinegar and barbeque.  However, there are other brands of chips too.  Of course, Subways here also sell cookies.

 

I ordered the turkey and ham sandwich.  A typical 6 inch turkey and ham costs 3,48 EUR, but luckily there are valuable coupons available on their website.  Hence, with a buy one, get one free coupon, I was able to get a whole foot long turkey and ham sub for 3,48 euros!  It was still more expensive than the $5 subs in the states, but it was nonetheless a good deal.  I also grabbed a bag of roast chicken flavored Walkers potato crisps – a 34.5 gram bag – that cost 0,99 EUR.

The toasted Italian bread was exactly like back home.  Inside, there were 4 slices of turkey and 4 slices of ham.  There was also Swiss cheese triangles sandwiched between the meat and vegetables.  Of course, I asked for all the vegetables in my sub to complete the meal.  I noticed that they didn’t automatically add mayonnaise, mustard, oil, vinegar, or black pepper here.  Instead, the employee asked what type of sauce I wanted.  She mentioned a scharf (spicy) or suß (sweet) dressing that can be added.  Looking for an adventure, I opted for the spicy sauce.  It turned out to be just like the spicy sauce from the kebab restaurant – orange and only a minute jolt of fire on my tongue.  Apparently, it was the southwest sauce available at USA chain stores.  Nevertheless, it was something I never tried before and it added a lot of delicious flavor to the sandwich.

 

The sandwich as a whole was definitely tasty and flavorsome – enhanced by the addition of the sauce.  The amount of ingredients was perfect and definitely a healthy meal.  The roast chicken flavored chips tasted more like the thin slices of chicken breast you would find in the ham section of a supermarket – good, but not spectacular.

I was quite surprised by the open space in the fast food place.  There were plenty of tables and everything was spotless.  Even the restrooms looked modern and well maintained.

Overall, I cannot complain about anything.  The sandwich was spot-on in terms of what I was looking for and the addition of the sauce was definitely a new, exciting experience.  It was an appetizing reminder of American sandwiches back home.

 Dunkin’ Donuts

 Konrad Adenauer Platz 14 40210 Düsseldorf 

When I noticed that there was a Dunkin’ Donuts in the Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof, I was totally excited.  I grew up in Southern California, where there are only a few Dunkin’ Donuts around town and I never had the opportunity to visit one.  Before I left Düsseldorf this time, I knew that I had to try one of their donuts!

 

This Dunkin’ Donuts stand is pretty small, although they have several varieties of donuts to choose from.  Most of the ones in the glass are decorated with mouth watering frosting that will definitely push your caloric intake for the day.  Behind the counter, they have their Munchkin donut holes.  A cute name indeed!

All giddy with excitement, I had trouble choosing which donut to try.  I ended up selecting a Frühlings Donut (a springtime donut) with the name “Erdbeer Traum” (strawberry dream”).  I also ordered a small hot chocolate with whipping cream on top.

 

The donut was absolutely wonderful.  There was some strawberry filling in the middle of the dough, which finely complemented the sweet frosting on top.  The donut itself was delicate and a bit sweet.  Overall, it was a great American treat.  The hot chocolate, on the other hand, was miserable.  Even though it looked great, the whipping cream was completely worthless.  In fact, it made the hot chocolate even worse!  I was expecting something sweet to warm my soul on this cold, windy day, but the drink tasted absolutely atrocious.

Overall, the donut and the small drink cost 2,09 EUR.  Not bad at all!  Next time I’m at the main train station, I will definitely be dining on Dunkin’ Donuts in Düsseldorf, Deutschland!



 Summary :

An American donut chain toward the back end of the Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof, Dunkin’ Donuts offers delectable donuts that will certainly satisfy your sweet tooth!  A must try for travelers yearning for something American.

Overall – 4 stars
