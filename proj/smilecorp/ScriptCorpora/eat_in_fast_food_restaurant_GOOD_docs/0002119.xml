 Healthy Meals at Fast Food Restaurants 
 Mar 31, 2011 | By Eliza Martinez Photo Credit fast food image by FotoWorx from Fotolia.com 
Fast-food restaurants are notorious for serving meals that are high in fat, calories and salt. However, according to the Cleveland Clinic, most people are going to eat them from time to time because they are quick, convenient and seemingly inexpensive. Cooking at home with wholesome ingredients is optimal, but when life requires that you grab a meal on the go, choosing the right fast-food meal is important because a poor diet puts a person at risk for obesity and heart disease. Understanding the options at fast-food restaurants makes it simpler to choose a healthy meal.
 
Single Patty Hamburgers

According to the Cleveland Clinic, the hamburger itself isn&apos;t usually a problem, but it becomes one when a double or triple burger is ordered, especially if it is served with cheese and bacon. Huge burgers are several portions--the government describes a single serving of hamburger as about 2 to 3 ounces, which is the size of a deck of cards--and are very high in saturated fat and calories without the toppings. A single-patty burger without mayonnaise, cheese, bacon or signature sauces is a healthier choice. Pairing it with water and a side salad with low-fat dressing makes it a healthy fast-food restaurant meal. Good choices include Burger King&apos;s Whopper Jr. and McDonald&apos;s plain hamburger.
 
Salads

Most fast-food restaurants offer a variety of salads. However, diners are cautioned to choose those that contain grilled chicken and lots of vegetables over those that have bacon, cheese, fried chicken and huge amounts of salad dressing, reports HelpGuide.org. By ordering the dressing on the side, a person can control how much he puts on his meal, drastically reducing calorie and fat intake. The Cleveland Clinic recommends Wendy&apos;s Mandarin Chicken salad with Oriental dressing and McDonald&apos;s Southwest Grilled Chicken salad.
 
Sandwiches

Deli sandwiches can be a healthy fast-food meal if piled with the right ingredients. Choosing lean cold cuts, lots of vegetables and low-fat cheese over globs of mayonnaise and fatty cuts of meat is the right way to go. Roasted turkey, ham or roast beef are options that are low in fat and calories, whereas meatballs, cheesesteak and tuna swimming in mayonnaise are ones to avoid. Requesting vinegar or other low-calorie sauces like mustard give a sandwich flavor while preserving healthiness. According to the Cleveland Clinic, Subway&apos;s turkey breast sub and Arby&apos;s Market Fresh Roast Chicken Ranch fit the bill. They can be eaten with a salad or bag of baked chips to round out the meal.
 
Burritos

The Cleveland Clinic reports that Taco Bell&apos;s bean burrito and steak burrito are both low in fat and calories and make a good fast-food meal. Choosing ones that don&apos;t contain huge amounts of cheese and sour cream is better for health. Additionally, burritos that have been fried or grilled to make them crispy often contain added fat and calories from the oil. Guacamole and fresh salsa make good toppings for a fast-food burrito because the vegetables used to make them are high in nutrients that are important for good health. Whole pinto beans and black beans are generally a better choice than their refried counterparts, which may have added fat and salt.
