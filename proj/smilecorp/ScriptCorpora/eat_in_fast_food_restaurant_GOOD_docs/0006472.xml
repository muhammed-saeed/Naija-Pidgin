It was great. Highest quality. Seating is comfortable, Great place for breakfast and dining. Their food is delicious and fresh, service is attentive, and you will feel relaxed and pampered in their cozy dining room. Delicious food, fast services, best management, clean place, warm welcome, acceptable price are some of their specifications.

It&apos;s obvious when you take a bite out of something eaten here that this place isn&apos;t your typical fast food restaurant. The prices are a little steepe, but if you don&apos;t consider this place a fast food restaurant, you&apos;ll be satisfied. For a restaurant that looks like a fast food restaurant, the menu is large and there is a lot to choose from. Even more, the burgers they make are incredibly tasty...
