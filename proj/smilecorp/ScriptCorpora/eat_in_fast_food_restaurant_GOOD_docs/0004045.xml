 I paid a bill in April via the local branch of a well known bank. The payment was not received by the company that was supposed to get it. I have misplaced the receipt and the bank claims they have no record of it. What can I do to solve this?
 Additional Details 
Paid in cash, cannot find the receipt.                 Reason for Reporting
 No Spam 
 Adult 
 Gambling 
 Unfinished 
 Deception 
 Plagiarism 
 Not English

 Do you have a record of the transaction on your statement?

I&apos;d say that was the best starting point, as that should show where the money was actually sent.

 Kick up a stink at the bank, mioght work. Not sure if you have lost the receipt. 
 
 Countess 
 You must have given the bank something to pay the bill with,like part of the invoice,they then transfer the money into the said account.
Go back to the bank,you must have an old bill with details on,the bank can find anything several yrs back,they have to.That money you paid in would have gone into their account and then transfered later.Get them told.

 Keep your receipts next time.

Not being able to lay your hand on a receipts is like&quot;using&quot;your safety belt - by leaving it laying on the seat. 
 
 Michael G 
 If you paid by check, go to your bank and file a&quot;Check Tracer&quot;. (your bank may refer to it as something else)

If you paid by Debit or Credit it should have been an instant payment and show up within 1-2 days. If you can give the bank the amount, or the date, or the company name they should be able to find it. If they have no record of it then the transaction never went through.

You can verify this against your total amount written in your checkbook records versus what the bank says you have.

 Go back to the bank, they must have a record of all transactions, if not contact their head office and complain 
 
 Steph 
 You can ask for a bank statement, if the money came out of your account it would be on the statement, if it didn&apos;t come out then your money should still be in the bank. 
 
 Nile Girl 
 not much if you have no reciept and the bank has no record of it, you need some proof that you paid it. 
 
 jamand 
 Nothing - no receipt to show the transaction - no proof.
