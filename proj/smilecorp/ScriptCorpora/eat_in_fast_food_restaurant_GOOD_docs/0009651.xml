Whether you need a bite before work or a weekend brunch adventure that includes your two feet and the train, here are some spots to get breakfast near MARTA.

 Corner Bakery - N7 Buckhead
For breakfast sandwiches, egg dishes, oatmeal and more, the Corner Bakery is a quick stop where you order at the counter. The Buckhead location is literally right next to the N7 Buckhead station. Take the first set of stairs out of the station to street level and turn left.
  Thumbs Up Diner - E6 Decatur
Now open on the square in downtown Decatur, Thumbs Up Diner has a large menu, including vegetarian options. Bring cash and take the Swanton Way exit out of the Decatur station and walk straight ahead past the bus bay. Immediately to the right will be a service street with four yellow posts. Turn right on this street and walk between the buildings to reach E. Ponce de Leon Avenue. Turn left onto E. Ponce and the diner is a couple doors down.
  Dania&apos;s Gourmet - Five Points
Right in the middle of downtown and a block off the Five Points station is the family-owned Dania&apos;s Gourmet. You can grab a quick and tasty breakfast from their breakfast bar - choosing two or three items for a meal under $5. Awesome oatmeal. Take the Peachtree Street exit out of the station and turn left. Dania&apos;s will be at the intersection of Peachtree and Marietta Street.
  Highland Bakery - N5 Arts Center
Now with a new midtown location, the Highland Bakery can share more of its stone-ground grits and freshly baked and prepared breakfast items. Take the West Peachtree Street exit out of the station and turn left on West Peachtree Street and left again onto 15th Street. Walk up the hill and turn right onto Peachtree Street and walk about a block to the 1180 building at the intersection of Peachtree and 14th Street. 

 Flying Biscuit - N4 Midtown
A city favorite, the Flying Biscuit has several locations, but the one in midtown is easiest to get to from a MARTA station and offers street-view seating. Take the main exit off the train platform (not the narrow stairwell leading to the Federal Reserve) and at street level follow the signs to the 10th Street exit. Turn right on 10th Street and walk slightly less than three blocks. Flying Biscuit is on the corner of 10th and Piedmont Avenue.

Also Sun in My Belly is right next to the East Lake Station, and there is a J.Christopher next to both the Midtown and Decatur Stations, and Sweet Melissa&apos;s in Decatur as well.

Great additional suggestions! Sun in My Belly is a little further away, but the others are nearby. I can make a note to update.
