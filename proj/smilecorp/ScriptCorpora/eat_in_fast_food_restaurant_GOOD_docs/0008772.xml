 Cheap Food 
 can never go wrong with mcds right? or subways&apos; sub of the day! haha SAL&apos;S KEBAB HOUSE IN brrrrruuup ST MARY&apos;S!!! lush kebabs n sals the big bloke-top geezer Ali Burger at Montefiore House in Wessex Lane. Open till 3 in the morn&apos;, and tastes v.good. Not keen on fast food but I love proper pub grub so Goblets, The Old Fat Cat and Avondale do good, cheap food. The last two have the advantage of being able to play pool while you wait. All big portions which you can stuff yourself silly with, have a couple of drinks and still only spend a tenner each. Aug 05 Andys fish n chips! bitterne triangle! lovely food! St Marys Street for Chippys&amp;Cafes Linda Maderia on Bedford Place does great Portugese and Italian, reasonably priced. Kachina Chinese restaurant on Shirley High Street for eat-all-you-can buffet... But THE restaurant is The Boozy Rouge. It&apos;s underground down an alley next to Bargate... Excellent! La Cantina on Bedford Place - Southampton&apos;s only Mexican restaurant, very nice food. Joe Daflo&apos;s is fab - really cool, stylish and pretty good prices. The Cowherds on the Avenue is a very nice, large pub that serves good food.
Subway La Margarita&apos;s is actually run by greeks! So definately not very Italian if you ask me! Has to La Regatta opposite the Red Funnel - great fun for parties! If not your cup of tea then Manzils Curry House in Bedford Place! Bloomin amazing value! The Toad at Above Bar is a classy new pub which serves cheap modern tucker, wraps, pittas etc and has Sky too. 
Subway in Above Bar and East Street rule. KFC has improved with a bigger corner premises at the lights. no vegan or veggie resturants but there are places nearby and there is the solent veggies and vegans and uni veggie groups which organise socials and trips for veggie resturants The Avenue is a take-away but is also licensed for booze til late.
Taste of India, Favourite Pizza and Seven Seas on Burgess Road, mmm...yummy Some good places to find good food.
Try La Margherita [near the Red Funnel Ferry] for Italian, and a good Greek Mousaka will be served at Nick&apos;s in East Street. Venture out the city towards Romsey for some nice Chinese food from the Mandarin Chef - try the Nine Season Prawns! For those of you with extensive bank accounts - Chewton Glen. Or, if you like Steak, go to the Parisienne in Romsey, nice steaks, nice atmosphere. Theo&apos;s on Onslow road for take aways, Pizza Express in Oxford street (near ocean village) for a resturant subway... also handy if your cold and wet you can sit in there for hours with just 49p REFILLABLE teas.. refil coffee costs 99p If you go up to the top level of West Quays theres eery food venue you can imagine! Macdonalds KFC Coffee vars American Diners posh restaurants Ice Cream Parlours its all there! Whats the name of that takeaway along canute road? (near the traffice lights by ocean village). Their small, medium and large kebabs all seem to be the same size but ridiculously expensive. The chilli kebabs (with chilli sauce) are murder if you like that sort of stuff. Langleys on Bedford Place Have you been to the newest Indian in Town ( Southampton) at No 1 Queensway(opposite NewYork newYork nightclub.It is called POSH and it is as good as Kuti&apos;s but only cheaper! It is worth a vist and including in knowhere for those of us who fancy champagne but only have beer money. but Apollo restaurant, Bedford Place. Basically a truck stop restaurant, but cheap food, and quite good it is too. kutis does a good curry, but is expensive and not really the place to go after the pub Absolutely has to tbe JEWEL OF INDIA in Townhill Park, the BEST indian in town. JEWEL IN THE CROWN in Shirley is run by the same guy - excellent food. Take Aways after a beery night out - go to Metropolis down by Ocean Village - I tihnk it&apos;s open till about 3am - doner kebabs, burgers, ahhh I love the smellof onions in the morning..... Famously bad....Mustang Sally&apos;s on Carlton Terr was &apos;OK&apos;.
Food in Lizard Lounge isn&apos;t too bad. Ted&apos;s Fish&amp;Chips on Bedford Place is cheap and edible. Burger King Rodeo burgers 99p mmmmmmmmmmm......Theres 2 in town but the one by the bargate is better as the other has been renivated and now looks tacky, the staff are also much nicer and funny at the bargate 1!! SUBWAY - it&apos;s nice! Buon Gusto(on corner nr Mayflower)-good itlaian, not too expensive The Olive Tree, located on Oxford Street, makes you feel very sophisticated (trendy art decor) but not uncomfortable. The food is very reasonably priced as well (especially at Lunchtime) and very tasty. Mostly French, but something for everyone. SUBWAY is the best fast food restaurant in the world, if you don&apos;t allready know, they make you big fucking roll baguette things with everything you want, and you get refillable drinks. Subway in town does very filling American sandwiches. Kuti&apos;s is Southampton&apos;s best (and most expensive) Indian restaurant. You can find it across the road from Stanley&apos;s Casino and O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Oirish&quot; pub on Oxford Street. Picolo Mondo&apos;s off of Civic Centre Road (tucked round near the back entrance to the Marlands Shopping Centre) offers great cheap italian food and pizzas. Goblets in Above Bar Street (opposite the Cenotaph) also offers bargain tasty food. La Marguerita on Commercial Road...a must for anyone who loves Italian cooking made and served by feisty Italians Southampton has recently had a SUBWAY sandwich shop open opposite Tyrell and Greens at the top of the high street. You can get massive amounts of food there for not too much money. Lots of fast food shops like McDonalds and Burger King, as well as Pizza Hut, Pizzaland and the odd kebab shop/chinese takeaway Several expensive resteraunts near the Mayflower Theatre.
