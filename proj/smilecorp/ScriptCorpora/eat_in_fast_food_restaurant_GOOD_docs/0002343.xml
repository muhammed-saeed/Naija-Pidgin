Best Teen Jobs Advice From Bill Gates 2 comments

Whether you love or hate Bill Gates…he sure hit the nail on the head when he recently gave a speech at a high school graduation.

Here Are 11 Job Advice Rules Your Teens Are NOT Learning in School:

Rule 1: Life is not fair–get used to it!

Life is especially not fair at work. Some work harder than others for less pay…some work less for more pay.

Rule 2: The world doesn’t care about your self-esteem.

Neither does your boss. He wants the job to get done–and done well.

Rule 3: You will NOT make $60,000 a year right out of high school. Or become a vice president out of college.

If you don’t believe me, just ask any recent graduate.

Rule 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.

Or obnoxious co-workers you’re stuck working with 8 hours a day. 

Rule 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your Grandparents had a different word for burger flipping; they called it opportunity.

I think every teen should be required to work at a fast food restaurant. They’ll learn the meaning of hard work and be motivated to further their education!

Rule 6: If you mess up, it’s not your parents’fault. So don’t whine about your mistakes, learn from them.

The best thing you can do for your kids is let them make their own mistakes. And not make excuses for them.

Rule 7: Before you were born, your parents weren’t as boring as they are now.

They got that way from paying your bills, doing your laundry, and listening to you talk about how cool you are.

Rule 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life HAS NOT.

In some schools, they have abolished failing grades and they’ll give you as MANY TIMES as you want to get the right answer. This doesn’t bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.

There’s no extra credit at work if you screw something up. And if you don’t do your job–you’ll be fired.

Rule 9: Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and
few employers are interested in helping you FIND YOURSELF. Do that on your own time.

There’s no spring break either. You’ll be lucky if you get 2 weeks of paid vacation.

Rule 10: Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and to to jobs.

And you won’t be able to surf the internet or listen to your iPod either.

Rule 11: Be nice to nerds. Chances are you’ll end up working for one.

Your boss doesn’t care if you were popular in high school. No one does.

If you agree with these rules…pass it on. If you can read these rules…THANK a teacher!

Do your kids think money grows on trees? Here’s a step-by-step guide for teaching your kids the value of a buck…[http://www.millionaire-kids.com/millionairekidsebook.html]Millionaire Kids Broke Kids so your kids don’t fall into the trap of spend now…pay later…and be flat broke living paycheck to paycheck by the age of 30!

In most cases, it&apos;s usually pretty difficult to make good money as high school teens, unless you get lucky somehow and find a cool teen job. But there are a few great job ideas that can pay you quite decent pocket change or even incredibly well into the thousands of dollars if you have the right computer skills, the motivation, or don&apos;t mind doing small physical labor.

Yes, it is somewhat difficult to make good money as a Teen unless you are completely done with school and can get into a low entry job like the oilfield for example. But yes, there are money opportunities out there as long as you work hard and build your skills
