 How to make it 

 In stock pot or pasta cooker, cook pasta according to directions on box. Drain the pasta and put into large salad bowl in the fridge to cool. Peel the cucumbers and cut into bite-sized pieces. Cut the tomatoes into bite-size pieces. Chop the onion fine. When pasta is cool, add all the other ingredients, adding the dressing to taste. I use about 3/4 of the small bottle. Sprinkle with Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese. **This salad keeps well in the fridge for almost a week - But it never lasts that long!**
