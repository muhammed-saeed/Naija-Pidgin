 2 Hailstone Sequences [12 marks] A hailstone sequence is a sequence of integers found by applying the following rule: Hailstone Iteration: For an integer n in a hailstone sequence, the next item in the sequence is 3n + 1 if n is odd, or n / 2 if n is even. For example, the hailstone sequence starting at 6 is 6 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1. The sequence ends when 1 is reached. The name&quot;hailstone sequence&quot;stems from the way the values in the sequence go up and down, as a hailstone does in the clouds before it falls to earth. Collatz (1937) conjectured that for any starting... A man age 55 is a member of his employer s occupational pension scheme. He has been a member of the scheme since he joined the employer at age 35, and he expects to retire at age 65. However, at any time before age 65 he could: (a) die; (b) leave the employer and hence have to leave the pension scheme; or (c) be forced to retire early because of ill health. His salary is 40,000 per annum, and this is not expected to change in future. It is assumed to be paid continuously. The pension scheme s actuary uses the following Markov model to represent the man s life history before age 65. - Z Z Z Z Z Z Z ZZ~... Write a Temperature class that represents temperatures in degrees in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Use a floating-point number for the temperature and a character (type char) for the scale: &apos;C&apos; for Celsius, &apos;F&apos; for Fahrenheit and &apos;K&apos; for Kelvin. The class should have a) Four constructors: one for the degrees, one for the scale, one for both the degrees and scale, and a no-argument constructor. For each of these constructors, assume zero degrees if no value is specified and Celsius if no scale is given. b) Three accessor methods: one to return the temperature in degrees Celsius, one to return the temperature in degrees... An electric dipole with dipole moment p is oriented along the y-axis. A:Find an expression for the electric potential on the y-axis at a point where y is much larger than the charge spacing s. Write your expression in terms of the dipole moment p. Express your answer in terms of p, y and appropriate constants. B:The dipole moment of a water molecule is 6.2 \times 10^{ - 30}\;{\rm C} {\rm m} . What is the electric potential 1.0 nm from a water molecule along the axis of the dipole? Express your answer numerically, in Volts, to 3 significant figures. I have to write 2 vocabulary stories using the following words: coalesce, coda, codify, cognizant, collage, commensurate, compendium, complacent, complaisant, complement, compliant, compunction, concave, conciliatory, concoct, concomitant, condone, confound, congenial, and conjugal *Project 4 - Due March 15. MadLibs continues to be a game that amuses small children. It works like this - * a paragraph or two is written with some key words missing. In their place is * an indication of the type of word (proper name, adjective, adverb, verb, etc.) * that should be placed there. Then one person gets to ask every other person * in turn to provide that kind of word and the blanks are filled in. * When complete, the text is read back, generally to great hilarity. * In this project, we are going to take a stab at implementing such a game in Java. * Consider the following paragraph:...
