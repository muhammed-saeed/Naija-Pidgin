 Study finds that employees will steal, given certain circumstances 
November 28, 2002, Columbus, Ohio
An experimental study of employees at a large corporation found that they were almost all likely to steal small amounts of money after they were underpaid for participating in an after-hours project. This occurred less frequently in the offices that had an employee ethics program, or if they thought the money came from their own managers rather than from the company. This study demonstrates that ethics programs might help prevent employee theft. However, it is also a sad commentary that adults need such training.

 Falwell apologizes . . . again 
October 14, 2002
Once again Jerry Falwell has apologized for making insulting statements. This time it was for his recent allegation that the prophet Muhammed was a terrorist. He justified his apology, however, claiming that his comments were made in response to a &quot;loaded question.&quot; In September, 2001 he blamed the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on &quot;the pagans, the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians.&quot; He later apologized, but claimed his remarks were taken out of context.

 Air rage sensors? 
July 27, 2002, UK
A British company has invented a thin filmy cover for airplane seats, which contains sensors that measure stress and anxiety levels of passengers. Most passengers who exhibit unruly behavior are agitated before the behavior occurs. The seat covers will be able to detect this agitation (as well as anxiety and possible medical conditions), so that the crew can monitor specific passengers more closely, and posssibly prevent an outburst. This may not be such a good idea -- imagine the lawsuits that could arise: &quot;My seat cushion signalled to you that I was angry, but you didn&apos;t prevent me from smacking the flight attendant. So it&apos;s YOUR fault, not mine!&quot;

 Another baseball strike? 
July 8, 2002
Baseball season is in full swing (pun intended) and major league players and owners in the U.S. are already anticipating contract renewals this fall. There is talk of another strike. The negotiations focus, of course, on money. One of the terms implies putting a cap on players&apos; salaries. With current average salaries of $2.38 million, it&apos;s hard to sympathize. Next, many of the players don&apos;t want to be subject to drug testing. It&apos;s apparent that they feel entitled to obscene salaries and to not having to be accountable. Team owners aren&apos;t exempt from brattiness either. They get cities to build stadiums at taxpayers&apos; expense, then charge an arm and a leg for admission, not to mention food and drink. They claim that these high prices are necessary because they have to pay players&apos; salaries. Players and owners each blame the other for being greedy, but neither side is willing to give up any dollars. After all. . . . in their own eyes, theyve EARNED it!
