U.S. exports of high value food products and seafood to Hong Kong are expected to reach a record level at over US$2 billion in 2010.
 Presentation View View full screen HTML View THIS REPORT CONTAINS ASSESSMENTS OF COMMODITY AND TRADE ISSUES MADE BY USDA STAFF AND NOT NECESSARILY STATEMENTS OF OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY Required Report - public distribution Date: 9/1/2010 GAIN Report Number: HK0012 Hong Kong Food Service - Hotel Restaurant Institutional HRI Food Service Sector Approved By: Erich Kuss Prepared By: Chris Li Report Highlights: U.S. exports of high value food products and seafood to Hong Kong are expected to reach a record level at over US$2 billion in 2010, making it our 4th largest market for these products after Canada, Mexico and Japan. The global financial crisis did not have a significant impact on Hong Kong?s food&amp;beverage imports and spending on food. Economic growth in Hong Kong is expected to be around 5% in 2010, benefitting from the continued economic growth in Mainland China. In addition, it is expected that Hong Kong will remain as one of the top 5 markets for U.S. consumer ready food products in 2011, continuing to be a major buying center and transshipment point for China and Southeast Asia. However, rents and wages are on the rise in Hong Kong and inflation may limit Hong Kong?s future economic growth. In addition, Mainland China is expected to take austerity measures to cool down its economy in late 2010 and 2011 and these measures could also impact Hong Kong?s economic growth. Even with lower economic growth, post expects that U.S. products will continue to fair well due to competitive prices and consumer confidence in the quality and safety of U.S. products. In addition, the Hong Kong dollar link to the U.S. dollar provides much needed foreign exchange stability among food importers. Post: Hong Kong Page 1 of 30 SECTION I. HONG KONG MARKET PROFILE HRI Food Service Sector 1. Restaurants Despite the global financial crisis, Hong Kong restaurant industry?s purchases of over US$3.5 billion in foods and beverages generated sales of over US$10.2 billion in 2009. This represented an increase of 0.6% and a drop of only 2.8% respectively over 2008. Table 1. Hong Kong: Restaurant Receipts and Purchases, in US$ Million Growth 2008 2009 2010 est. 2010 vs 2009 Restaurant Receipts 10,178 10,239 10,750 5.0% Restaurant Purchases 3,647 3,546 3,700 4.3% (Source: Quarterly Restaurant Receipts and Purchases, Hong Kong Census&amp;Statistics Department) Hong Kong economy experiences continued growth and it is expected that restaurant purchases and receipts will grow by 4.3% and 5.0%, reaching US$3.7 billion and US$10.75 billion respectively in 2010. As Asia?s most cosmopolitan city, Hong Kong boasts around 11,540 restaurants serving a wide range of world cuisines. These restaurants are comprised of 53% Chinese, 36% non-Chinese restaurants, and 11% fast food outlets. In addition, there are over 1,000 bars, pubs and other eating and drinking establishments. Chinese restaurants: Chinese restaurants are popular among local citizens and tourists. There are a variety of Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong serving different regional cuisines: Canton, Shanghai, Beijing, Sichuan?etc. A typical lunch at a nice Chinese restaurant costs around HK$100-300 (US$12.82-38.46)per person and a typical dinner costs around HK$150-400 (US$19.23-51.28) per person. Non-Chinese restaurants: Many Hong Kong consumers enjoy western food, as do the nearly 30 million tourists (in 2009). 5-Star and other high-end western restaurants are as likely to be patronized by locals as tourists/visitors. Japanese food, fast food chains, coffee houses and casual dining establishments are also increasing their presence. A typical lunch at a western restaurant costs around HK$100-300 per person and a typical dinner costs around HK$200-500 (US$25.64-64.10) per person. Fast food outlets: Fast food outlets are popular among Hong Kong consumers. The most popular fast food chains in Hong Kong are McDonald?s, KFC and Pizza Hut. There are also some large local fast food chains such as CaféDe Coral, Maxim?s and Fairwood that serve both Chinese and western foods. Competition among fast food chains is intense, as they Page 2 of 30 each try to keep meal prices competitive. The average cost is around HK$25 (US$3.21) for breakfast, HK$30 (US$3.85) for lunch, HK$20 (US$2.56) for afternoon tea and HK$50 (US$6.41) for dinner. To further meet competition, many fast food operators have renovated their outlets to make them look more modern, spacious and attractive. To meet the demand of a growing number of health-conscious customers, fast food chains have also introduced more new ingredients and developed healthy-food options such as salads, fruits, and fresh juices. Coffee Shops: The coffee shop market continues to grow in Hong Kong?s commercial areas. The two largest coffee house outlets are Starbucks ? operating 109 outlets and Pacific Coffee 53 outlets. Most shops also offer basic menus consisting of muffins, pastries, cakes, sandwiches, and bottled beverages (juices and water). McDonalds has also vigorously expanded its McCafe in order to gain share in this growing market. Of its 154 outlets, 64 include a McCafe inside their shops. Growing Trend ? Healthy Eating: Hong Kong?s food culture is ?fresh?. Consumer preference for fresh and live products is due to tradition, as well as concern about food safety. Hong Kong consumers are increasingly health conscious. Hong Kong has over 50 small to medium size health food stores. The two leading supermarket chains (Wellcome and ParknShop) and drug store chains (Manning?s and Watson?s) also sell natural/organic products at their outlets. The growth of ?Mix? ? a juice bar that also serves food is a good example of a successful ?healthy? restaurant chain. Organic foods are also gaining popularity as evidenced by the growth of specialized retail outlets for organic foods. There is increasing opportunity for U.S. products and ingredients in this sector. 2. Hotels The number of hotels and available rooms in Hong Kong is growing. Table 2. Hong Kong: Growth in Number of Hotels/Guesthouses (2008-2009) 2008 2009 Growth Number of hotels/guesthouses 695 758 +9% Number of rooms 60,273 65,386 +8% Room occupancy rate 85% 77% - (Source: Hong Kong Census&amp;Statistics Department) According to Hong Kong Tourism Board statistics, tourists spent more than US$1.37 billion on food and beverages in 2009. Many five-star hotels serve U.S. beef, chicken, turkey, pork, eggs, fish and seafood products, fruits and vegetables, processed products and beverages. Page 3 of 30 The Hong Kong Government (HKG) provides a searchable list of licensed Hotels&amp;Guest Houses at: http://www.hadla.gov.hk/en/hotels/search_h.html http://www.hadla.gov.hk/en/hotels/search_g.html A list of Hong Kong hotels are available at: http://www.hkha.com.hk/doc/mem_eng.pdf http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/jsp/hotel/search-index.jsp 3. Institutions Institutions like schools, hospitals, and airlines are serviced by a small number of large catering groups who are generally affiliated with the restaurant sector. These caterers mainly source their ingredients from China where supplies are cheaper and more abundant. They also use ingredients from other countries such as the U.S. when they cannot find the same quality products in China. Schools: As school regulators prohibit primary and lower secondary students from eating their lunch out, students must pack their lunch boxes or subscribe to a school lunch box program. For the academic year 2009/2010, there were 582 primary schools and 523 secondary schools, having a total of 344,748 primary students and 238,026 lower secondary students. About 70% of students join a school lunch program. A typical lunch box consists of some kind of meat, rice and some cooked vegetables. The annual cost of Hong Kong?s school lunch program is estimated at US$250 million. Healthy eating programs are underway to encourage a change in eating trends for school children. Caterers must register with the Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) before they are eligible to bid tenders provided by individual schools. ATO Hong Kong can provide U.S. exporters with the list of registered caterers for school lunch boxes. Hospitals: The Hospital Authority operates 40 hospitals with a total of 27,117 beds and staff size of 55,911. The catering services for hospitals are outsourced on a tender basis; many of which also operate restaurants, fast food chains or school lunch catering services. Airlines: There are three aircraft catering franchisees at the Hong Kong International Airport, each with a 15-year term. The aircraft caterers provide a comprehensive range of flight catering services. These services include the preparation and assembly of flight meals, loading and unloading of food and other catering loads onto aircraft, and the storage of catering equipment and supplies. Table 3.

GDP and per capita GDP dropped by only 2.5% and 2.8% respectively in 2009. Hong Kong?s economy quickly recovered and continued to improve in 2010, particularly with the continued influx of investment from Mainland China. It is expected that GDP and per capita GDP will grow by 5.3% and 5% and reach US$220 billion and US$31,400 respectively in 2010. Table 4. Hong Kong: Gross Domestic Product and GDP per capita Growth Growth 2008 2009 09 vs 08 2010* 10 vs 09 GDP US$215 billion US$209 billion -2.5% US$220 billion* +5.3%* GDP per capita US$30,779 US$29,902 -2.8% US$31,400* +5%* (* Estimate based on government forecast, analysis of the economy and market trends) Demographics Hong Kong?s population was 7 million at the end of 2009. 1.74 million, or 47% of the total labor force, are women. The large number of employed women is an important influence on the demand in the restaurant business. Table 5. Hong Kong: Labor Force Participation 2008 % of Total 2009 % of Total Labor Force-Men 1.95 million 53% 1.96 million 53% Labor Force-Women 1.7 million 47% 1.74 million 47% Total 3.65 million 100% 3.7 million 100% (Source: Hong Kong Census&amp;Statistics Department) A typical Hong Kong household spends around US$2,500 each month to meet its basic living needs, 27% of which was spent on food and beverages (Source: Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department). Imported Foods vs. Domestic Products Due to limited land resources and having a population of 7 million, Hong Kong relies on imports for over 95% of it food supply. In 2009, the local agricultural industry produced US$72 million worth of products. It is comprised of US$30 million in crop production Page 5 of 30 (mainly vegetables), US$19 million in livestock production, and US$23 million in poultry production. Local production accounted for 2.4 percent of fresh vegetables, 53.7 percent of live poultry and 6.2 percent of live pigs consumed in the territory (Source: Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department). Due to its central location, free port status and position as a regional purchasing and distribution center, a significant amount of Hong Kong imports are re-exported. Table 6.

Re-exports out of Hong Kong) The HRI sector is continually seeking quality fish and seafood supplies. U.S. products are highly respected for their quality and safety. Growing concerns over the safety of Chinese fish and seafood from polluted sources increases opportunities for high quality fish and seafood. Thanks to the fast-recovering economy and consumer affluence, retained imports of consumer-oriented agricultural products (COAP) and Seafood products in Hong Kong are expected to grow by 16% in 2010. The U.S. is Hong Kong?s second largest supplier of COAP and Seafood products following China. Retained imports of products from China and the U.S. in 2010 are expected to reach US$2.26 billion and US$1.46 billion, representing market shares of 22% and 14% respectively. Hong Kong?s status as a gateway for trade with China and Macau are increasingly opening up greater avenues for U.S. high value food products. In 2010, Hong Kong is expected to import over US$14.5 billion COAP and Seafood from the world and re-exported 28% of these products. Around 53% of all these re-exports went to China and 10% went to Macau. (Source: Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department) Outlook in 2010/2011 Economic growth in Hong Kong is expected to be around 5% in 2010. However, rents and wages are on the rise in Hong Kong and inflation may limit Hong Kong?s future economic growth. In addition, Mainland China is expected to take austerity measures to cool down its economy in late 2010 and these measures are expected to slow down Hong Kong?s economic growth in 2011. However, post expects that U.S. products will continue to fair better than its competitors due to competitive U.S. prices and consumer confidence in the quality and safety of U.S. products. In addition, the Hong Kong dollar link to the U.S. dollar provides much needed foreign exchange stability among food importers. It is expected that Hong Kong will remain one of the top 5 markets for U.S. consumer ready food products in 2011, as it continues to be a major buying center and transshipment point for China and Southeast Asia. Page 7 of 30 Import Regulations 1. Import Duties&amp;Import Certificates With the exception of spirits, all food and beverage products can be imported to Hong Kong duty free. Technical requirements for imports vary significantly according to the product. Products which require import permits/health certificates include meat, milk and frozen confections. The Hong Kong Government (HKG) also plans to implement a health certification requirement for eggs and seafood products. Currently, the HKG accepts import applications from Hong Kong importers. In other words, local importers and not U.S. exporters are required to apply for import permits. U.S. exporters need to supply their agents/importers with necessary documentation such as health certificates from the U.S. government. For details on Hong Kong?s general import regulations for food products, please refer to GAIN Report #9018. 2. New Nutritional Labeling Law Hong Kong?s Legislative Council on May 28, 2008 passed a nutrition labeling regulation, which took effect July 1, 2010. Hong Kong?s nutrition labeling regulation requires all prepackaged food sold in Hong Kong have to label the contents energy plus seven nutrients namely; protein, carbohydrate, fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium and sugars. Products selling less than 30,000 units a year can apply for small volume exemption provided that the products do not carry any nutritional claims. Traders applying for exemption have to pay HK$345 (US$44) per product variety for the first year and HK$335 (US$43) for annual renewal. Hong Kong?s nutrition labeling regulation is unique; as all imported foods making nutrition claims from all sources will have to be re-labeled for the Hong Kong market. Despite the U.S. requiring the labeling of 15 energy/nutrients, U.S. products still cannot meet the Hong Kong nutrition labeling requirements due to different nutrient definitions, rounding practices, and recommendations for daily consumption. Virtually all U.S. products carrying claims will require labeling changes and/or nutrient testing. Details of the regulation are contained in the Technical Guidance Notes on Nutrition Labeling and Nutrition Claims, which is available at: http://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/food_leg/food_leg_nl_guidance.html Further supplementary information will be provided in the form of FAQ on the Hong Kong government?s Center for Food Safety website: http://www.cfs.gov.hk/eindex.html Page 8 of 30 For more information on the impact of Hong Kong?s nutrition labeling regulation, please see reports HK8017&amp;HK7011. (These reports are available at: http://www.fas.usda.gov/scriptsw/AttacheRep/legacy.asp) 3. Preservatives Regulations Hong Kong amended its Preservatives Regulation, which became effective July 1, 2008. A two-year transitional period for compliance ended on June 30, 2010. Compared to the original regulation, the new regulation no longer allows for the use of propyl para- hydroxybenzoate, but additionally allows the use of the following preservatives: Guaiac resin Isopropyl citrates Stannous chloride Tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) Thiodipropionic acid Dimethyl dicarbonate Ferrous gluconate Formic acid Hexamethylene tetramine Lysozyme Pimaricin Another change brought about by the amendment to the regulation is the adoption of a food category system based on Codex?s General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) and the incorporation of those preservatives and antioxidants, as well as their permitted levels of use, in GSFA. To help trade better understand the amended regulation, the HKG issued a ?User Guideline?, which provides the definition of each food category of the newly adopted food category system. Also, the Guidelines include some questions and answers pertaining to the amended regulations. The full Guidelines are available at the following website: http://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/whatsnew_fstr/files/User_Guideline_e.pdf Hong Kong?s Preservatives Regulation adopts the principle of a positive list. In other words, Hong Kong does not allow any preservatives or antioxidants in foods if they are not expressly permitted by the Preservatives Regulation. The list of permitted preservatives and their maximum permitted levels may be retrieved from the following website: http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr07-08/english/subleg/negative/ln085-08-e.pdf More information on the amended Preservatives Regulation, pleases see gain reports Page 9 of 30 HK#8021&amp;HK#7018. (These reports are available at: http://www.fas.usda.gov/scriptsw/AttacheRep/legacy.asp) 4. Biotech Food Related Regulations The HKG does not have any specific biotechnology regulations with regard to the labeling of biotech food products. The HKG makes no distinction between conventional and biotech foods. All are subject to the same food safety regulation. The HKG, after evaluating the impact of its voluntary labeling scheme for biotech food products, released its conclusions to the Legislative Council on July 8, 2008, suggesting there is no need for a mandatory labeling law in Hong Kong. The HKG noted difficulty in carryout a law that currently does not have an international standard to back it up. As a result of its evaluation, the HKG plans to continue to promote voluntary labeling of GMO products as a viable alternative for the trade. The HKG released a set of guidelines on voluntary labeling for biotech foods in 2006. The guidelines on labeling for biotech foods are advisory in nature and do not have any legal effect. Adoption is entirely voluntary and is not binding. The guidelines apply to prepackaged food and are based on the following four principles: ? The labeling of biotech food will comply with the existing food legislation. ? The threshold level applied in the guideline for labeling purpose is 5 percent, in respect of individual food ingredient. ? Additional declaration on the food label is recommended when significant modifications of the food, e.g. composition, nutrition value, level of anti- nutritional factors, natural toxicant, presence of allergen, intended use, introduction of an animal gene, etc, have taken place. ? Negative labeling is not recommended. As the guideline is voluntary, U.S. food exports should not be affected if they choose not to have any biotech labeling. However, it should be noted that the HKG does not encourage negative labeling particularly for the use of the following terms: ? GMO free ? Free from GM ingredients, etc For products with such definite negative labeling, the HKG may take the initiative to test Page 10 of 30 the products against GM ingredients and zero tolerance will be adopted for testing purposes. If products are found to have misleading labeling, a retailer may be subject to prosecution under Section 61 ? False Labeling and Advertisement of Food or Drugs of Chapter 132 Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance. (Available at http://www.legislation.gov.hk/eng/home.htm) If the trade chooses to apply negative labeling, the government advises to use less definite terms such as ?sourced from non-GM sources? (which contains less than 5 percent of GM content) and to have documentation to substantiate such declaration. For more details on the voluntary labeling guidelines and biotechnology in Hong Kong, please refer to Gain Report HK#8019&amp;HK#6016 respectively. (These reports are available at: http://www.fas.usda.gov/scriptsw/AttacheRep/legacy.asp) Hong Kong passed a Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance in March 2010. With the expected commencement of the Ordinance in late 2010 or early 2011, there will be documentation requirements for shipments containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs in the Ordinance are referred to as LMOs or living modified organisms. According to the announced information, shipments containing GMOs will need to be accompanied by documentation containing the following information: ? If the identity of the GMO is known, the shipment contains such a GMO; if the identity of the GMO is not known, the shipment may contain such a GMO; ? The GMO is not intended for release into the environment; ? The common name, scientific name and, where available, commercial name of the GMO; ? The transformation event code of the GMO or, where available, its unique identifier code; and, ? The details of the importer or exporter (such as name, address and contact information) for further information. There is no specific requirement regarding the form of documentation accompanying GMO shipments. The use of a commercial invoice or other documents required by existing documentation systems would be sufficient. Table 7.

There is a wide variety of U.S. products available While Hong Kong has one of the busiest to Hong Kong consumers (over 30,000 different container terminals in the world, it also has the items). The link between the Hong Kong Dollar most expensive port handling charges. (HKD) to the U.S. Dollar help insulate the HKD from currency fluctuations. Most trans-shipments to Macau are purchased, Hong Kong?s top supermarkets are a duopoly consolidated and shipped via Hong Kong. that often request slotting fees. In general, HKG in its implementation and application of regulations is transparent and open. Hong Kong exporters choose to work with Hong Kong importers and distributers to get their products to China because of Hong Kong?s dependable legal system, contracts and rule of law. Hong Kong concerns over food safety have made U.S. food products as a top choice for quality and safety. Hong Kong?s modern and efficient port terminal and free port status make it an attractive destination and for re-exports. Hong Kong is a ?quality? driven market so price is not always the most important factor for food and Page 12 of 30 beverage purchases. Hong Kong is a dynamic market with a sophisticated international community where new high quality products are readily accepted. Products containing biotech ingredients are not controversial in Hong Kong in general. Lack of local production means virtually no protectionist pressures for food and agricultural products. Hong Kong is in an economically vibrant region and its economy is expected to continue its growth in 2011. Hong Kong?s duopolistic supermarkets have a wide distribution network. Cold chain and distribution channels for food products are generally efficient and dependable, as is the customs clearance process. SECTION II. ROAD MAP FOR MARKET ENTRY Exporting and Selling Since very few hotels, restaurants or institutions import directly from exporters, most suppliers sell to importers for further distribution to the HRI sector in this market. Establishing a Business in Hong Kong If U.S. restaurant chains or caterers want to establish a stronger foothold in Hong Kong, they are allowed to incorporate freely. However, there are two market entry channels that U.S. companies may consider in their attempt to establish a presence in Hong Kong?s HRI sector. 1. Franchising The concept of franchising has been growing in Hong Kong for the past decade. Nearly 80 % of the franchise operations in Hong Kong are of U.S. origin. Home-grown franchises have also developed, especially in catering. Page 13 of 30 2. Joint Ventures Joint ventures or strategic alliances can be very helpful in entering the market, and are particularly important in competing for major catering projects. In order to attract foreign investment, the HKG set up a special department called ?Invest Hong Kong? to help overseas companies establish a presence in Hong Kong by providing all the support needed to establish and expand their operations (www.investhk.gov.hk). Entering the Hong Kong market with products suitable for the HRI trade can be handled in a number of ways. Certainly the end customer, the hotel, restaurant, institution or caterer has an influence on the selection of products or ingredients but the choice is all very much guided by a network of reliable and trusted suppliers. 3. Setting up a Representative Office One of the most effective but costly means that U.S. companies can use to sell their products to this market is to set up a representative office in Hong Kong. Information on how to set up a new business in Hong Kong can be found at: https://www.success.tid.gov.hk/tid/eng/blics/index.jsp# 4. Appointing Agents U.S. exporters may consider hiring a local agent. A key consideration is whether the prospective agent has a good marketing record and widespread distribution network. The advantage of having an agent is that it can help with marketing and distribution. Some companies may secure a very competitive price package with TV/magazine/radio for advertisements. In addition, well-established companies have extensive distribution networks not limited to the HRI sector but also to retail outlets. Importers and distributors tend to focus on specific categories of products and end markets. Research should be carried out to ensure the importer/distributor selected is appropriate for your products. Marketing Strategies Identify key players for the products - ATO Hong Kong can provide lists of importers, distributors, commodity cooperators and regional business groups. Test marketing maybe required prior to establishing a presence in the market. Page 14 of 30 Communicate product benefits to end-users - although distributors maintain the relationships with their customers, end users assert influence over the buying decisions. It is important to directly educate all stakeholders as to the features and benefits of your products. Participate in or visit trade shows ? Hong Kong has an excellent reputation of hosting international trade shows. In cooperation with cooperators and regional groups, the shows will demonstrate the versatility and safety of U.S. food products. Some major shows include: Table 8. Hong Kong: Trade Shows Featuring Food Products 3rd Hong Kong Int?l Wine&amp;Spirits Fair http://hkwinefair.hktdc.com Nov 4-6, 2010 HOFEX 2011 http://www.hofex.com May 11-14, 2011 Natural Products Expo Asia http://www.naturalproductsasia.com Aug 2011 Restaurant and Bar http://www.restaurantandbarhk.com Sep 2011 Asian Seafood Exposition http://www.asianseafoodexpo.com Sep 2011 Asia Fruit Logistica http://www.asiafruitlogistica.com Sep 2011 Stage menu promotions with major restaurant chains - Menu promotion dollars will be maximized if spent on promotion events held with the major restaurant chains. With the restaurant chains? announced intention to have an image overhaul, this provides for an opportunity to introduce new U.S. foods. Invite restaurant owners/chefs to seminars and/or to the U.S. - ATO Hong Kong/ cooperators organize seminars and trade missions to the U.S. with an intention to introduce U.S. products, meet U.S. exporters, and share with them food service operations in the U.S. MAP Program Small to medium sized U.S. food companies wishing to export their products can get funding assistance from the USDA Market Access Program (MAP). The reimbursement rates for branded promotions are equal to the percentage of U.S. origin content of the promoted agricultural commodity or a rate of 50 percent, whichever is the lesser. If you are a producer or exporter and want to participate in the MAP, please contact a trade association that represents your specific product. If no trade association is applicable, please contact one of the four State regional trade groups: Food Export USA - Northeast (FEUSA), Food Export Association of the Midwest USA (FEA), Southern US Trade Association (SUSTA), and Western US Agricultural Trade Association (WUSATA). For details of the MAP program and a list of trade associations, please contact our office or visit the website: http://www.fas.usda.gov/mos/programs/maptoc.html Page 15 of 30 Market Structure U.S. Exporter Importer / Distributor / Wholesaler Wet Markets Hong Kong HRI Trade The market structure for Hong Kong typically involves a dedicated importer/distributor who deals with the U.S. exporter and maintains relationships with local resellers. Some special items are imported directly by large hotels, restaurant chains and institutions but most tend to outsource the import burden. Hong Kong is a mature trading port and as such has developed an effective network of importers, distributors and wholesalers that support the HRI trade. Most major importers/distributors service multiple reseller sectors including HRI/food service, retail and wet markets. ATO Hong Kong has a resourceful database of Hong Kong importers servicing the HRI trade. For information regarding specific category suppliers, the ATO Hong Kong can provide additional information.

Since Hong Kong?s domestic production is nominal the market size in the following table is equal to retained imports without taking into account local production. U.S. exports to Hong Kong are also based on imports minus exports. 2 Import tariff rates for all food and beverage products in the tables are zero except for spirits with an alcohol content greater than 30%, which is 100%. 3 Products listed below are either enjoying a large market import value or a significant growth rate for the last 5 years (2005-2009).
