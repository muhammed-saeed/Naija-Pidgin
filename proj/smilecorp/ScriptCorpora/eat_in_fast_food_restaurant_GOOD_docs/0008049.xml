Housemates let meat thaw on the counter. This seems unsafe to me. Should meat be thawed in the fridge instead?
 Trying not to offend, what can be done? This can make me sick since we all share in chores, what is the proper response?

 Don&apos;t listen to the ppl. who say it is safe to thaw frozen meat out on the counter, I bet they wouldn&apos;t eat at a restaurant that did that.
My stomach/system is very sensitive to improper handling of meat and various foods. I get sick when other ppl. don&apos;t (if I eat food improperly handled). My brother and I can buy a hamburger with everything on it and cut it in half. I&apos;ll eat my half and he&apos;ll eat his half of the same hamburger; I&apos;ll get sick and he won&apos;t.

Cold water thawing - The meat should be submerged in cold tap water, changing the water every 30 minutes so it continues to thaw. Small packages of meat or poultry – about a pound – may defrost in an hour or less. A 3- to 4-pound package may take 2 to 3 hours. For whole turkeys, estimate about 30 minutes per pound. If thawed completely, the food must be cooked immediately.

Foods thawed by the cold water method should be cooked before refreezing.

 go to the local health dept and get a brochure how to thaw meat.

hang it on the fridge. if they still don&apos;t tell them point blank that there is only one way - thaw it in the fridge or trash it.

 totally safe as long as you don&apos;t leave it out well after it is thawed, if no spoilage occurs there is absolutely no difference between the fridge and counter, other than you could potentially drop juice inside the fridge from the meat that will get you sick later if it gets on other food

i&apos;ve done this for years and never got a bit sick as long as the meat is COOKED. the only time I got sick from food was when a certain fast food restaurant didn&apos;t cook the chicken sandwhich fully I ordered at 11:00 am. I was food poisoned for 3 days from that.

 what makes you sick is not properly cooking it or cleaning up after it. if you cook it all the way through your fine. if you clean and disinfect where it was defrosted you will be fine. now don&apos;t leave it out all day and forget about it. throw that away. but a couple hours to defrost and it&apos;ll be ok.

 Really should be thawed in refrigerator for best safety but if the meat was cooked well done I&apos;d eat it.

 red meat can be thawed on the counter as long as it&apos;s refrigerated or cooked (and cooked properly) as soon as it&apos;s thawed

Poultry and pork should always be thawed in the refrigerator.

 It is best to thaw in the fridge, and then brought up to room temperature before cooking.

Much depends on the temperature and the time it takes to thaw. It will thaw faster at room temperature which is good if it hasn&apos;t been taken out early enough.

As long as it is covered you have little to worry about getting sick, as long as it is cooked. You are being a little paranoid.

Look in the butchers shop and deli-bars, and you will see meats left out uncovered for hours, think of it that way, so ignore those who say it is unsafe, or that you have 2 hours, they are even more paranoid.

 Beef is a very hardy meat; you can do just about anything with it, and if you stew it for hours the chances of you getting sick are infinitesimal. If you are going to grill it or fry it, however, especially if you want it rare or medium inside, you&apos;ve got to be a little more careful. But counter-top thawing for a few hours is absolutely no problem.

Other meats, especially chicken (and of course ANY seafood), is much more delicate. Chicken etc. should be kept refrigerated as much as possible. And NEVER thaw out chicken and re-freeze it: guaranteed food poisoning, believe me. Once chicken or seafood is thawed, cook it straight away.

The best quality control is your nose. Meats that are not contaminated have virtually no smell. (Fresh beef has a metallic sort of smell, fresh fish a fishy smell, fresh goat/venison/wild boar a slightly gamey smell, but none are very strong). If the meat smells funny, chuck it.
