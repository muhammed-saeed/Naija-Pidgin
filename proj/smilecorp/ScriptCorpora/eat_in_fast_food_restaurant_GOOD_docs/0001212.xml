Best Gluten-Free Restaurants
 17 Mar 
Although I’ve already done a post on gluten-free restaurants (check it out over here!) , I read something yesterday that I wanted to share with you. Triumph Dining took a poll to determine the BEST gluten-free restaurants.  You can read their blog over here to see the results or read the information that I copied below:

(While I haven’t tried the brownie at Outback yet, I have heard that it’s FABULOUS!!  Also, I so wish that there was a P.F. Chang’s closeby.  I am determined to get there when I travel some this summer!)

 

 

Thank you again to the 5,800+ people who voted. Your votes counted, and here they are.

I was just out at OSU for an accepted students restaurant, and my brother and I went to P.F. Changs to celebrate for my birthday! I had the lettuce wraps and then a chocolate dome“cake”for dessert. The meal was heavenly! What an awesome birthday treat…you never would have known it was all gluten free
