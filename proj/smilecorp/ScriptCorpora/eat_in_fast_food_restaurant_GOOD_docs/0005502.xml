A customer receipt printer can be used for both restaurant and retail point of sale register systems—whether you need to print credit card, check or cash receipts.
Part of creating an efficient point of sale system is choosing the correct receipt printers for your needs. In the case of a busy restaurant or retail store, a thermal receipt printer would be a good choice for its speed and silent printing. For a restaurant point of sale system, you may also choose a dot matrix printer to use as a remote printer for the kitchen or bar. When an order is created using your point of sale register, the contents of the order can be sent to the kitchen.

Whatever type of establishment you have, a customer receipt is no problem—whether you need cash receipts, check receipts, or credit card receipts.
