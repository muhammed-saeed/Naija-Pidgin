 Healthiest Fast Food Meal for Kids 
 Sep 8, 2011 | By Julie Boehlke Photo Credit Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images 
Fast food is something that many parents use when money is tight and time short. A major issue with indulging in fast food is it can be high in calories and fat grams. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says kids should limit their total fat intake to 30 percent to 35 percent of their total calories. Learn to make healthy choices when you have to eat a fast food meal.
 
Salads

One benefit of eating a fast food meal is that there are many vegetable options at most big chains, including Wendy’s. Select a salad as a healthy fast food meal for kids but steer clear of those laden with fat and calories. Choose boneless, skinless chicken or no chicken at all, if you choose to limit sodium. Some salads, such as Wendy’s Berry Almond Chicken Salad, include up to 11 types of greens along with fresh fruits such as strawberries and blueberries. These salads are an excellent source of vitamins A and C while having only 12 grams of total fat and 270 calories. You can make the salad healthier if you eliminate the chicken, Asiago cheese and dressing.
 
Fruits

Fast food restaurants do not make their main selling point offering fresh fruits to customers–especially kids. But many restaurants are carrying more items that contain fruits in their meal options. Fruits are important because they contain potassium, fiber and folate. Fruit and yogurt parfaits, including the McDonald&apos;s brand, offer a healthy serving of fresh fruit mixed into low-fat dairy yogurt. McDonald&apos;s also offers fresh fruit smoothies that are made with real fruit and have only 180 calories and 0 grams of fat per serving. Apple slices and fruit and walnut salads also are healthy meal options for kids.
 
Sandwiches

Snack wraps are becoming a popular fast food alternative to a greasy cheeseburger. Most wraps are made with a low-fat flour tortilla that is not fried. Tortillas easily hold tasty, low-fat fillings that many child enjoy. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts along with a low-calorie dressing make a healthy meal for lunch or dinner. Request to have the wrap made without cheese and any extra condiments, if desired. Sandwich subs, such as the Subway Fresh Fit Black Forrest Ham, are 6 grams of fat and under 375 calories. Order a low-calorie milk or bottled water for the beverage.
 
French Fries

French fries often are considered one of the most unhealthy meal items at a fast food restaurant, but they can be healthy if prepared right. Sonic brand restaurants offer french fries that are lower in fat and calories than those of competitors. A small french fry order at Sonic is 200 calories and only 8 grams of fat. If french fries are not an option, go with apple slices or a baked potato and skip condiments such as bacon bits, sour cream, cheese and butter.
