 June 25, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by grkcake ( 3 reviews ) Been back a few times to give them a chance but the food isn&apos;t very good. A shame because I like the atmosphere and I would rather support the local place instead of a chain. They should cut the menu and focus on getting it right. Chicken...dry ribs...dry , pork...dry. Was it even cooked today? May 6, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Disappointed by Frank Papini ( 1 review ) I was recently asked by the owner to vacate the restaurant over a dispute I had over a year ago. He claims I walked out on an order that never arrived at my table after a 27 minute wait. One year later I am asked to leave and not to come back. If we had been previously served in a timely manner this could have been avolded April 8, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Mickey WV ( 16 reviews ) Good Riddance!!!!!! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful +1 more review from Mickey WV March 20, 2010 Mobile review HORRIBLE!!! It&apos;s always best to ask what they are out of before ordering as they ALWAYS are out of half the menu items! February 14, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Very dissapointed by emacnpa ( 15 reviews ) We had been here once before and it was a ok experience. It was busy so any negatives were written off to that. This time however......very different. 2 other diners and 2 bar patrons who were veyr loud. Filthy tables, used dishes still on tables, the floor was littered with food and trash, dishes that had been cleared were stacked at the end of the tables out in the dining room. The menu was limited because some equiptment was not working and we were left to figure out what they could cook on our own. Two female servers spent most of their time standing at the bar and being loud. Food came out and I am pretty sure it was pre-made food that got warmed up. Neither of us ate more than a few bites. Will not be going back. April 26, 2011 Likes it Yummy! by Braden Parker ( 11 reviews ) Great seats, large booths for couples with kids. I big PLUS! Had a very friendly, helpful, and attentive waitress who went out of her way to make our experience a memorable one. The stuffed banana pepper appetizer is to die for good. Man, I&apos;ll definitely get those again. My wife had the mild hot wings and they were really, really good! My son had the kid&apos;s serving of spaghetti and meatballs. All very good, with an even better homemade sauce. We&apos;ll definitely be back for more! November 6, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Brandi Lynn ( 2 reviews ) Horrible service...mediocre food when it finally arrived. The waiter appeared to be on some serious drugs...it was sad and frustrating. It took 20 minutes to get a table even though they weren&apos;t that busy. 20 additional minutes to get our waiter to come take our drink order. The salads and drinks arrived scattered and one member of out party had to ask for his. The food arrived after a long wait and half the meals were not to par. Medium steak was black and overcooked to the point where it wad almost inedible. They were out of a side dish and didn&apos;t bother telling us until after that dinner was served. The crab cake had a hair and had to be sent back. We asked to speak to the manager about the service and he was extremely ride and combative. The 6 members of our dinner party swype we would never go back. It was the worst experience at a restaurant any of us have ever had. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful May 21, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by CMM ( 2 reviews ) Delicious food, well priced, private and relaxed atmosphere.. The only reason they would be out of items is because everything is homemade. If you want frozen food ordered in bulk, go to a fast food place.
