特點:
-一般茶餐廳的枱都會是四人方枱或者是六人至八人的圓枱或長枱。也有些是二人枱。
-一些茶餐廳會在枱面上放上透明玻璃。玻璃下會有餐牌。
-座位一般都有椅背。主流的茶餐廳座位一般都是無椅背圓櫈。
-部分茶餐廳會有卡位，由於坐卡位會有較多的私人空間，所以甚受顧客歡迎。
-絕大多數茶餐廳也需要「搭枱」，尤其是在午市最繁忙的時候。「搭枱」就是幾個不相識的人同坐一枱
-2007年前，絕大多數茶餐廳都不禁止客人吸煙。甚至有茶餐廳侍應會在值勤時吸煙。但由2007年1月1日起，香港法律已禁止任何人在室內食肆吸煙。
-侍應替客人寫菜單時，通常他會使用一些速記符號
-茶餐廳內使用的許多桌面器皿都是由飲料廠商提供的
-大部分茶餐廳使用的碗碟都是相同的圖案

優點:

食物種類:

-茶餐廳供應了中式及西式的食品，茶餐廳供應了中式及西式的食品，更有不少香港獨有的飲食。

價格:

-傳統食肆售賣的食品價錢通常比較貴。不過由於現時通貨膨脹，食品的價格已跟大集團的快餐店相差無幾。
 2008-01-01 21:07:37 補充 
經營模式:

-侍應替客人寫菜單時，通常他會使用一些速記符號，這是因為過去擔任茶餐廳侍應的人，文化水平比較低。亦因為茶餐廳的步伐一般相當急促，侍應並沒有太多時間每一個字寫 到單上交到廚房去。

-絕大多數茶餐廳也需要「搭枱」，尤其是在午市最繁忙的時候。「搭枱」就是幾個不相識的人同坐一枱。通常茶餐廳侍應會安排客人坐位。

-離開的時候，拿著結算單到櫃檯付款。
