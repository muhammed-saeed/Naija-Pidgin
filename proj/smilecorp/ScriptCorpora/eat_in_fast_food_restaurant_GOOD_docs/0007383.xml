An after-hours burger run to Burger King on Tuesday morning left a Sacramento man with a bad taste in his mouth, when the receipt for his value meal included a nasty note.

Francisco Perez was looking for a late night combo meal “his way” but when he ordered the double whopper with cheese, onion rings and small drink the BK staff had ideas of their own and handed him his receipt complete with a &quot;F**k You&quot; message on it.

The receipt given to Perez had the F-bomb directive not once, but twice clearly listed, plain as day.

Also clearly listed were the Burger King staff that served Perez in the drive-thru at 1:41 am. A host, Mariela and cashier Armand will have some explaining to do.

After returning to the fast-food restaurant, Perez said he was not offered an apology and the store employees laughed it off. This may be the last $9.22 that the home of the Whopper will get from Perez who stated he “didn’t think it was funny at all”.

The Arden Way location’s supervisor would not comment on the consequence involved and only stated he, “would have to talk to the store manager.” He did remark that would usually be where the customer order number or customer name would be.
