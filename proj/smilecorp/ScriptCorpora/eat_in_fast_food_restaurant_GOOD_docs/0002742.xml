With so many negative reviews regarding this McDonald&apos;s change in building spaces, I thought I&apos;d offer some perspective.

Yes, this McDonald&apos;s moved from a very large space to a much smaller building and, as a result, this McDonald&apos;s no longer has a play place, automatic piano player, or ample indoor seating space. However, the move has resulted in a lot of great additions. For example, this McDonald&apos;s can now accept Arch Cards, charge lower prices, and participate in nation-wide promotions. And you no longer have to pay a fee to use a credit card. Simon Malls charges so much for building space that it just wasn&apos;t feasible for the old McDonald&apos;s to exist in such a large lot.

The new McDonald&apos;s location is very nice. There is only enough indoor seating for about 12 people, but there are a ton of tables outside in the nice California sun. The employees at this McDonald&apos;s are all extremely professional and friendly. The men wear suits and ties and the women wear nice shirts and scarves. The kitchen is impeccably clean, as is the store as a whole. There is a flat screen TV playing CNBC in the store.

This McDonald&apos;s also reserves five parking spaces for its customers, located right in the front of the parking garage across the street.

Overall, this is a great McDonald&apos;s that provides exceptional food and service at standard McDonald&apos;s prices. I&apos;ll give up the nice moon man playing an automatic piano for the reinstated dollar menu, $1 soft drink promotion, and lower prices altogether.

Clean is about all this McDonald&apos;s has going for it. It&apos;s cramped, very loud even with only a couple people in it, and they messed up my order. In all the years I&apos;ve been killing myself with cheeseburgers from McDonald&apos;s, never once has my order gone this wrong.

So I go to this McDonald&apos;s, hearing it was the &quot;nice&quot; one. As I&apos;m ordering, I feel like I&apos;m screaming across the counter over several different beeps, bumps, and clangs coming from the kitchen. I&apos;m asked to repeat my order more than once, as though he&apos;s taking down my order as a waiter instead of entering it into the computer in real time.
&quot;CHEESEBURGER, PICKLES ONLY&quot;
&quot;So you don&apos;t want pickles?&quot;
&quot;I WANT pickles.&quot;
&quot;But nothing else?&quot;
&quot;Only pickles. I want a cheeseburger with pickles.&quot;
&quot;Cheese burger, pickle only.&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;

And what do I get? A limp, cheeseless hamburger with two pickle slices smaller than a quarter on it. Thanks &quot;nice&quot; McDonalds. It&apos;s not like I went here because I was starving or anything.

I am revising my review to say that this is a VERY CHEAP McDonald&apos;s when it comes to handing out sauce for the Chicken McNuggets. This is the first one I recall (at least in a long time) that will deny you a second sauce for a six-piece order. Other locations don&apos;t gave problems giving out another one when asked. I found myself having to conserve in the sauce dipping just because of that and the chicken didn&apos;t taste as good as a result.

I was planning to downgrade by one star but cone to think of it that&apos;s too generous compared to their cheapness (especially for being in a supposedly rich city like Palo Alto). Therefore a one-star rating they&apos;ve earned themselves.

Wow, this McDonald&apos;s definitely has the Stanford Shopping Center look about it but once I stepped inside: Beyond Ghetto!

Just a few small tables to sit at inside.
Crazy a$$ chaotic line. If you can even call the scattered hoard of people a line.
Very small ordering counter.
Under staffed.
Employees running around like chicken with their heads cut off.

No thank you McDonald&apos;s you &quot;can have it your way&quot;...woops that&apos;s Burger King&apos;s slogan. Whatever!

How is there a McDonald&apos;s at Stanford Shopping Mall? haha, my hunger headache was too heavy to wait in line at any of the other eateries so McDonald&apos;s was my savior. It was around 12:30 and a line was unavoidable anywhere but at least here versus some of the other places in the mall, the line moved fast and service was not judgmental or snobby :)

It was dreadful waiting for my order to come out though, since the AC was broken/ not on/ non-existent? Couldn&apos;t bear stay there and eat my chicken mcnuggets and all the surrounding patio tables and outside benches were occupied so I had to trek all the way to a bench near Bloomingdale&apos;s.

Paid a little less than $8 for a meal I couldn&apos;t finish and wondered when McDonald&apos;s got so pricey. McDonald&apos;s is supposed to be food for the poor... I&apos;m not exactly poor but even for me, $8 is a little bit pricey for a fast food lunch!

Newer isn&apos;t always better! Personally i think when they had their old location open they gave better service! Their newly relocated store is super small and crowded! It&apos;s not very efficient and leaves many people confused because the lines are chaotic and disorganized. But the thing that bugs me more is after you pick up your food and try to ask for something they forgot to pack, like sauce, they totally ignore you! I understand their busy but it seems pretty rude to just ignore a customer that&apos;s been standing their for awhile just to get sauce that takes less than a sec to grab from under your counter. :\ But food is food and I&apos;m in a rush so I guess it does that job right.

Some McDonald&apos;s just don&apos;t make the cut, if that&apos;s possible since it&apos;s all processed, standardized food. There are not many good places to eat at Stanford Mall, the longest line was in front of the bakery which serves sandwiches, across the way from Tiffany&apos;s.

We were in a rush and Hubby&apos;s such a fan of McD&apos;s that he should be on their board of directors, so we went in for a fast-food lunch.  They have a lge room for diners which is full of little kids and parents.  I hated my fish burger which just didn&apos;t taste right at this place.  The bun tasted like an inexpensive Safeway bakery brand and I didn&apos;t like the taste of the fries either.

As much as I like McD&apos;s fish burgers in the past, this one made me regret not getting the chic nuggets like the toddlers.  Want McD&apos;s?  Go to the one on Stanyan or Stonestown in SF.

i hate this mcdonalds.
don&apos;t come here.

the cashier has hearing problems.
i ordered big mac with a small soda and she gave me filet o fish with the largest soda cup they can find.
the cashier even threw in 10 pieces of chicken nuggets and i didn&apos;t order it.

when i looked at my receipt, i saw that there was a mistake and i went back to the cashier. she didn&apos;t give me the chance to talk....  she gave me another cup of soda and then she went to the bathroom.

i just gave up with her and i left with the wrong order...

terrible service and the restaurant was very messy.

I&apos;m not coming back here again.
there&apos;s a pizza restaurant in the standford shopping mall, go there instead.

On my Black Friday shopping trip to Stanford Shopping Center, after shopping at Bloomingdale&apos;s and the Gap, I was hungry and my perfect meal is usually a quick trip to my all-time favorite McDonald&apos;s, the McDonald&apos;s at Stanford.

Because I am currently on my Atkins Diet, I am off potatoes, bread and pasta for 30 days hard core, then I will back off a little because I just have to eat that stuff or I will be miserable. So I asked the staff if they could make me an Atkins burger or a burger made with lettuce wrapped around the burger instead of bread. It is really, really good, you should all try it. You can really taste the delicious flavor of the individual meat patties; all of the broiled-ness and salty-ness and dripping juice that you would miss if the bread was there to mask it all. It&apos;s just more pure, I guess that is the best description I could give you to help you understand without trying it for yourself.

After much confusion and discussion, they turned their heads back to me and said &quot;OK.&quot; See why I love these guys so much. Now that this first stage of negotiation was over, I boldly moved to the next level by asking if could, in fact, get 4 of them. &quot;Sure,&quot; they replied. And after paying, four beautiful, wonderful, healthy burgers got transferred from their hands onto my tray.

They were so fresh, hot and delicious that I wolfed them down in literally four minutes; one minute per burger. And they hit the spot, while all the while I was being treated to a wonderful piano selection by the moon-faced McDonald&apos;s mannequin and a bunch of screaming, happy kids playing in the small, but fun, play area. To top it off, I went back and got a delicious small cup of McD&apos;s de-caff coffee to help me stave off the cold that was facing me outside.

All in all, a great dining experience. I love McDonald&apos;s.

If I had to pick a McDonald&apos;s to go to, this would definitely be the one. But not because the lines are short (they are long!) or the restaurant is super clean (it&apos;s about average but not above). As cheesy as it sounds, I&apos;d go for the memories...

I &quot;grew up&quot; at this McDonald&apos;s. When I was a little kid, my parents would bring my brother and me here on our shopping excursions and all of us would enjoy the greasy McDonald&apos;s grub together (I was almost always a chicken-mcnugget-happy-meal kinda girl). When our dog who had been home when I was born passed away, my parents took me to McDonald&apos;s to settle my tears...

Then, I started shopping trips with friends and we still often &quot;Were Lovin&apos; It.&quot; As I grew up, this McDonald&apos;s also took on many new looks over the years. The &quot;real&quot; trees disappeared and the plasticy kids play structure appeared after I was too big to use it...

I also remember the Monopoly game, special happy meal toys, and those yummy french fries!

Mcdonalds.

There are always kids swarming the inside, the line is incredibly long, it&apos;s always hotter inside than out, and the dining area is kept messy (maybe to encourage eating outside?).

It reminds me of airport fast food places, with parts of the menu omitted.  It&apos;s Stanford and they know they can get away with not offering certain values.

Still, it&apos;s convenient to work and if you say &quot;I need to be at work in 2 minutes&quot; they&apos;ll give you what you need without having to wait in line.  I come here almost daily for a dollar parfait and a glass of water.

Oh, they charge like 75 cents for using a debit card (I didn&apos;t ask about credit cards, and I couldn&apos;t exactly understand the man&apos;s accent so I&apos;m not sure if he said 75 or 50 cents).

Wow, who would have thought Stanford shopping center would have a Mcdonalds?  Anyways, yea, out of all the places to eat here, my best friend picks Mcdonalds.

This place has a freaking sliding door for an entrance. We came in and ordered and the guy who was helping us seemed to be super stressed out.  We paid and we waited for our food.  He was yelling out an order that seemed to be like ours but it was missing a couple of things so my best friend went up to check if it was ours. She decided to take it back to our table and check if it was ours and then all of a sudden, the guy starts yelling at us!  He started telling us off and saying that we didn&apos;t order here and that this order wasn&apos;t ours.  My best friend was so shocked because it seemed like the whole restaurant just stopped what they were doing and were watching us instead. LOL, but it did turn out to be our order but he forgot to charge us for some of the items.  He admitted that it was his fault and gave us free fries.  WOW, craziness at Mcdonalds.

I don&apos;t eat McDonalds on a daily basis and really wanted a soft-serve to help with the 100+ degree weather. However, I came away with medium frys and 6-piece chicken mcnuggets instead. Don&apos;t ask me why.

Place was crowded with kids and expected moms trying to wear out their little ones. Nice that this location has a jungle gym for the little ones.

I still don&apos;t understand why the moon guy (I forget his name) takes up valuable real estate as tinkles away on the pearly whites (piano). They must make that much money to not change a thing since I was little.

This is the best MC DONALDS here in the bay area or even the STATE!
I had my share of Mc Donalds from Virginia to California!
All my food was HOT ! My FRIES were soft yet perfectly textured crunchy! Not  over salted, just perfect. The Chicken Nuggets was excellent in texture and it was crispy yet soft inside! The Big MAC was extremely light in taste yet saturated perfectly with the secret sauce! Perfecto deliverance all around! Even their ice cream is DA BOMB! Blow up delicious!!!

BTW, I ate here about 10 times and every time...i felt this way. Every time!

Oakland, CA

Once I graduated college, I started avoiding McDonald&apos;s (I&apos;ve been to McDonald&apos;s fewer times than the total sum of my digits). So me giving this one 4 stars actually means something, though the rating is purely contextual and don&apos;t expect it for other McDonald&apos;s locations.

1-it&apos;s a great location. This McDonald&apos;s is in the Stanford Shopping Center, and believe you and me, once you actually shop at that mall, you&apos;ll only have enough money to feed yourself at McDonald&apos;s. Compared to all the other eating establishments in the mall, this one is by far the cheapest. Which makes it a great place to go if you&apos;re a broke grad student or someone hauling several hungry kids around. It also has a sizeable sitting area, so if you just want to plop down and rest for a second or two, it&apos;s spacious enough to accommodate this. Many of the other places around the mall either don&apos;t have lots of space or if they do, they are sit down and eat restaurants.

2-it&apos;s got cool accessories. So if you have kids, the indoor Playland is just the thing to get them to run off some extra energy (better there than running across Banana Republic while you&apos;re trying to shop). And it has this crazy piano being played by a life-sized man with a crescent men and sunglasses for a head. This is a throw back to an ad campaign McDonald&apos;s did back in the mid-eighties (definitely hit me up if you remember this). It&apos;s so kitschy that it&apos;s cool. But I guess if you close your eyes and ignore the smell of fried, you could actually imagine yourself in a nicer establishment where a real human being was playing the lilting piano music you hear.

3-the food isn&apos;t that bad. So I guess McDonald&apos;s has jumped onto the whole health bandwagon and started offering healthier selections. I had chicken nuggets (I just can&apos;t resist those crispy fried pieces of supposedly chicken breast) and their fruit and walnut salad. The salad was fresh and delicious, consisting of apple slices, grapes, walnut pieces and yogurt.

4-hey, it&apos;s cheap. Okay, so this is a no-brainer as most fast food is cheap, but considering again that you&apos;ve shelled out $100 for a plain white cotton t-shirt that has some designer&apos;s logo on it, this helps bring your budget back into balance.

We all know what McDonald&apos;s is, so this review is in comparison with other golden arches. in that light, our first experience revealed the following:

- High traffic. This is good because the food is fresh and hot. And you KNOW that McD&apos;s fries are best when they&apos;re fresh. Once they cool down, the potato center vanishes for some reason. Probably cuz they&apos;re just starch fries. The bad thing about traffic? LONG LINES. we waited almost 15 minutes from entry to eating.

- High prices. This McDs is outfitted with a playground, sliding glass doors, and a freakin&apos; mannequin with a moon for a head, playing a grand piano. And yes, the piano is actually playing. Down side? Prices for this McDs are higher than the california average, which itself is higher than elsewhere.

- Yelling. The manager absolutely yells too much. If you want to berate your employee about ringing up orders wrong, do it behind closed doors. Seems unprofessional to chew someone out loudly at the counter. And, if you want to shout for us to form three lines, please do not emulate the TSA. Airport security is not a good model of customer service.

Came here yesterday while on our excursion to the mall.  It was around 2 pm, still pretty busy.  Hardest part was finding a table to sit outside, since we had the dogs.  Most people took up one chair, and weren&apos;t even eating their food.  Understandably it is a public place&amp;I am sure it was the malls and not McDonald&apos;s.  Since it was wood&amp;no Arch on the back.  After poaching for a few mins, we were able to get a table.  The food was good, fresh, and yummy.  Everyone ate all their food.

Over all:  Good experience.  Good seating, views, food,&amp;had the dogs with us.  Worked out good.

Only in Stanford Shopping Mall would a Micky-D&apos;s have a player baby grand piano playing.  I guess.  I mean, Vegas didn&apos;t even have trendy little fast food joints like this.  Although I do try and limit the Trans fat intake to once in a blue moon, there was something relaxing about eating my Dbl quarter pounder while listening to smaltzy piano renditions of &quot;Unforgettable&quot; and &quot;From a distance&quot;.  Even the children, normally noisy and disruptive, seemed transfixed.

I work at the Stanford mall and went to McDonald&apos;s for quick lunch. After waiting in line and ordering, the person at register ask to see a photo ID since I&apos;m paying with card. I didn&apos;t have one on me because when I go to lunch I don&apos;t bring my whole purse with me, just my card. The guy than said that they can&apos;t serve me the food without my photo ID. I was very annoyed for this since they have no note in front stating that and they waisted 15 minutes of my 30 minutes lunch break. I had to go somewhere else for lunch and had no time to eat it. The next morning as I looked at my bank account, I was surprised to see a charge pending from McDonald&apos;s. I waited another day, and sure enough the charge was posted. They didn&apos;t need my Photo ID to charge me, just to give me a hamburger...
The Manager wouldn&apos;t refund me until I came over with my bank statement. Manager was OK, but I expected more from a store at Stanford Shopping Center, even if it&apos;s just a McDonald&apos;s!!!
Bad customer service.

McDonald&apos;s is the only fast food restaurant in the mall. I work at this mall and being the only place cheap enough for my stingy budget, it has to do.

They&apos;re always cleaning so I&apos;m glad that they care about cleanliness.

And I guess the piano man goes off during the weekend? At first, it was cool...but now it just takes up space. :(

I will always have a place in my heart for their mini meals, french fries and iced coffee. Thanks, McDonald&apos;s!

I would give McDonalds 4 stars but it loses a star because it&apos;s not good for your health. I really like McDonalds. Granted it&apos;s not on the same level as In-N-Out but as fast food goes, it&apos;s good. McDonalds is McDonalds. The food is very consistent (it IS fast food) so you will always be getting the same food no matter where you go. I haven&apos;t had the problem with bad food at any McDonalds that I have been at.

If I  had a choice, I&apos;d go to In-N-Out first, then Jack in the Box then McDonanlds. If you have an option, go with In-N-Out.

my favs: Quarter pounder (double, if you can handle it, and single) w cheese, double cheeseburger, chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, fries, sweet tea (you have to get the sweet tea), Angus mushroom and swiss burger, the wraps

Is it possible to rate it zero stars? Not only were the ordering lines chaotic, the employees are terrible. You probably don&apos;t have a choice since this is cheap eats at Stanford Shopping Ctr, but look at the other reviews and decide if your life/patience is worth saving.

I never thought I would review a McDonalds. It has it&apos;s place in the world and I like it for what it is. Good quick lunch once in a while, drink, snack, or treat. At this mall it used to be just that.  Then it recently moved locations and is horrible! It moved into the location that used to be a restaurant and I thought it would be bigger than the previous (good) spot. It is so incredibly small. I went on a weekday and there was absolutely no room to even wait in line. Just a handful of tables inside. It was soooo smushed and I even heard other people commenting about it. I can&apos;t even imagine this place in the summer with a line out the door.  It made me so annoyed that I just had to complain about it. I don&apos;t know what people were thinking. It should really be opened up into the spot next to it. Now I don&apos;t have a good place to get a quick drink or snack at the mall.  I guess Starbucks for an iced tea...I&apos;m personally not a fan of La Baguette.

I like McDonalds . I was surprised to see a McDonalds at Stanford Shopping Center because it seemed kinda high-end . This is just like any other McDonalds except unlike others , this one is very clean . The play structure was very clean as well which is a good thing for kids . This has got to be the cleanest McDonalds I&apos;ve been to in the bay area !

McDonald&apos;s will always have a special place in my stomach. I remember when McDonald&apos;s Hamburgers used to be 29 cents each and Big Macs were 99 cents in a special promotion. Those were the days, but then again, that was almost thirty years ago. My first job at 16 years old was at a McDonald&apos;s in San Jose at the corner of Blossom Hill and Kooser. There, I learned where I didn&apos;t want to be for the rest of my life.

Usually, as a last resort, I&apos;ll go to McDonald&apos;s inside the Stanford Shopping Mall to eat something quick before my part time job starts in the evening. Their evening rush is always busy with lines that go out the door with hungry patrons. Just recently, they started accepting major credit cards without a fee, but still charge a $5 fee for using debit cards. That&apos;s a major accomplishment.

I went to McDonald&apos;s last night and to my surprise I didn&apos;t have to wait in any lines at 4:40pm. I ordered a Quarter Pounder Cheese no onions meal and it included a Medium French Fries and Medium Sweet Tea. Total came to $5.99 plus tax totaling $6.54. As soon as I finished paying, my meal was bagged and ready for consumption. The efficiency was astounding and I&apos;ve never received service that fast before. One drawback was that the cashier didn&apos;t ask me if I was eating in or taking out, but that was very minor. The good thing is not getting one of their plastic trays that they wipe down and not properly sanitize. I got two cups of ketchup and proceeded to the back dining room. When I took hold of my big burger, it was hot and cheese was still melting. French fries were still oily and crispy, and that was a good sign. If you break open a McDonald&apos;s French fry and see a hole or air pockets, then that is an indication of an old fry. I know because I used to work there. I should&apos;ve asked for less ice in my drink because there was hardly any liquid inside; six sips and I was completely out.

Overall, I was content. Affordable food, super fast service, and tasty always counts in my book for future recurring visits. I was able to go to work with a full belly knowing the work I do will burn the calories fast. McDonald&apos;s is always a good alternative if you&apos;re short on time plus they carry a good selection of $1 menu items.

Long line, long wait, no value menu.  For it to be situated in such a nice place, &apos;nuff said.

Chicken Selects meal is an excellent mid-shopping snack. Quick service and reasonably priced. Eat outside, or indoors in the company of the vintage piano-playing &quot;Mac Tonite&quot; mannequin. Easily the cream of the Stanford Shopping Center fast food crop.

Obesity.
Heart attacks.
High Fructose Corn Syrup.
These are the first words that come to my head when I think about McDonald&apos;s. Although I would usually give such an establishment 1 star, this McDonald&apos;s at least has a nice play structure and a &quot;magical&quot; grand piano :) but still... I wouldn&apos;t eat here....

One would expect the food to be fresh, since it is usually busy.  However, the fries were way too salty and the bun on my cheeseburger was not even fresh: It was hard!  I&apos;d recommend eating outside, because the dining area smells funky! . . . That&apos;s what happens when you allow dogs at the Stanford Shopping Center!

This is my go-to place for the ice cream sundaes when shopping at Stanford Shopping Center in the summer.  The air conditioning at the McDonald&apos;s wasn&apos;t too great on the really hot days, but I guess that&apos;s why I went in for the chocolate fudge ice cream sundae.  Outdoor seating is available if desired.  Don&apos;t hold your breath, because it&apos;s just another McDonald&apos;s.

I wish I could give them NO star at all. I can not believe there is such a place exist which does not take there coupons.  I have a online printable coupons for buy one get one for free, however when I got there to get a drink, they told me that they did not take online coupons. Not a good feeling at all. Even there is not many place in the mall, I will not suggest to go to this place.

This McDonald&apos;s totally tries to lure you in with it&apos;s automatic sliding doors. I try not walk past it, but that can be difficult. Fortunately, I have been able to resist going in and ordering a bag of fries. But then again it could be that I just ate something equally fattening at one of the many eateries that Stanford Shopping Center has to offer.

You couldn&apos;t imagine another store/restaurant that&apos;s more out of place in Stanford Shopping Center than this one. Like all McDonald&apos;, the food is almost as depressing as the decor except perhaps for the $1 sundaes.
