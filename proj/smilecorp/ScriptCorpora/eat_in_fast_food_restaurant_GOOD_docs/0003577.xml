 (Newser) –
 In-N-Out Burger’s“secret menu”(veggie burgers, etc.) has gotten way too famous to really be considered a secret anymore—but Coupon Sherpa rounds up little-known items at other fast-food joints:
 Chili’s : Though it’s not on the menu anymore, you can in fact still order the restaurant’s namesake dish. Long John Silvers : Ask for a side of crumbs and you’ll get—for free—a box of fried batter parts that fell off the fish or chicken. 



 Jamba Juice : This secret menu is still pretty secret, but it includes a drink with the title“Pink Starburst.” Chipotle : They’ll make an item with any combination of ingredients they have—a quesorito is a quesadilla with burrito fillings, rolled up and baked. McDonald&apos;s : If you can bring yourself to order a McGangBang, you’ll get a double cheeseburger with a chicken patty sandwiched in between the beef patties. Starbucks : A Cake Batter Frappucino is a vanilla frappucino with almond and vanilla bean flavoring.
