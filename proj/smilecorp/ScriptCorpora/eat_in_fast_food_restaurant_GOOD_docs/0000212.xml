 Reviews Of The Week 
 
 At MenuPages, our legions of users submit reviews regularly for their favorite (and often least favorite) restaurants. Some make it onto the website, others don&apos;t. Here, we&apos;ll go over the week&apos;s best and worst reviews. 

We got a few great ones this week. And by great, we mean that they made us laugh; nine times out of ten, reviews that make us laugh don&apos;t make it onto the site, because they generally make us laugh for the wrong reasons. Here&apos;s a great example, for Jeff&apos;s Beach House&amp;Grill under the title &quot;marthas vineyard and nantucket is here&quot;: love the food and the atmosphere loved the staff very family friendly from the minute you enter the parking and the hostess to the owners are handson.That is a rare commodity in todays world . must go enjoy We&apos;ve got some serious grammar issues here. And seriously, is all that relevant that the owners are &quot;handson?&quot; We&apos;ll move onto the next one, for Vinnie&apos;s : As we walked in to a room of empty tables, we were seated at a high top table. We asked for a normal table and were told that the table next to restrooms were available...

What is up with this place? Racist? Stupid?

All Residents of Broward stay away... Here&apos;s a good rule of thumb: jump to conclusions about a restaurant&apos;s management being racist, and we&apos;re not going to validate your comment.

And now, for this week&apos;s winner, from JD who wrote about Dogma Grill : I think the hot dogs are good gourmet hot dogs. The buns are not just plain hotdog buns you get in any supermarket. The sausages were good. I&apos;m not sure if this location is better than the other locations. But, either way, I really enjoy eating my Cali dog - it&apos;s the one with avocado and bacon. Their garlic fries are good too.

As for prices, hot dogs are cheap, but while these are a little bit more expensive than most hot dogs, they&apos;re still cheap! Cheap enough for me to keep going back!

There&apos;s also Chicago hotdogs and that&apos;s not too easy to find in New York&apos;s sixth borough!

This location in particular only has sheltered outdoor seating, but with a hip vibe. Pretty informative, gives us an idea of what to order, and lets us know that there&apos;s only sheltered outdoor seating, so you might want to think twice on especially hot or rainy days.

 Now Open: Jason&apos;s At The Harrison 
 
Remember 8 1/2? You might not. It was a blink-and-you-miss-it place that got good reviews but just didn&apos;t make it. Well, the chef from 8 1/2, Jason McClain, now has his own place called Jason&apos;s at the Harrison on Miami Beach.

We just got the menu up today; it&apos;s certainly eclectic. There&apos;s tamarind braised oxtail with pickled papaya and yuca chips, beef carpaccio with ratatouille vegetable salad and Florida day boat grouper (which, given recent news, may either a) not be around for long or b) skyrocket in price). McClain also seems to be making an effort to use local ingredients, Homestead tomatoes for example.

 A Gorgeous Rose Petal Martini 
 
 Oh man, we want one of these. We fear it might taste a bit too perfumey, as can sometimes be the case when working with flowers in the kitchen, but just look at that thing. It is so pretty. We&apos;re thinking that might be just right for Valentine&apos;s Day.

And now, we promise no more photos from Andú. At least not until it actually opens.

 Review Digest: Super Bowl Dips Galore 
 
•As expected, there are tons of Super Bowl recipes in today&apos;s food sections. They&apos;re not reviews, and they&apos;re not terribly exciting (at least not to us...), but you know, they&apos;re there. If you need some help with the food for that game day party, check out any of the three major dailies.

•There&apos;s excellent Italian food to be had at Cantina 27 for half the price of the stuff you get on Ocean Drive. [ Miami Beach ]

• Lemon Fizz Cafe &apos;s wraps are a hit. Did you know that the other locations of the restaurant chain are in Damascus, Syria? Also, they have free wireless internet! [ Miami Herald ]

•Another Italian review, this time for Il Gabbiano . The food there, according to Lee Klein, should silence the New Yorkers who whine on and on about the lack of quality Italian food here. (Although we have to say, it doesn&apos;t help that the owners spent 26 years in New York City.) [ Miami New Times ]

•Unlike most other local crepe places, the new Crepe Lounge on Key Biscayne might actually stick around. [ Miami New Times ]

• Mozart Cafe is kosher, but open on Saturdays. The owners are Israeli, the chef is Caribbean-American, and the menu skips over the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East. Intriguing mix, and it apparently makes for some great dishes. [ Miami Herald ]

•Christine&apos;s just might be the perfect place to take your sweetheart on Valentine&apos;s Day. [ Broward-Palm Beach New Times ]

•Charles Passy checks out The Counter , a burger chain from California and describes it &quot;comfort fare with flair -- and heart.&quot; Sounds good to us! [ Palm Beach Post ]

 One More Note On The Gag Grouper Issue 
 
As we know, fishermen aren&apos;t happy about the proposed gag grouper fishing restrictions . We just thought we&apos;d add a few more quotes from an article we found today : Madeira Beach, Florida - The commercial fishing boat Martiza is just back after 10 days in the Gulf. The crew caught 5,000 pounds of fish, mostly brown grouper.

&quot;That will go to the restaurants, the local restaurants,&quot; said Dean Pruitt who owns the Martiza.

Pruitt also owns three other commercial fishing boats. He&apos;s against federal regulators proposals to reduce gag grouper fishing in the Gulf by 45 percent, which would shut down the grouper fleet the last three months of the year.

&quot;It&apos;s going to be a big impact on the restaurants, the people that work in the restaurants, the commercial fishery, the fish house, just anybody that want to eat the grouper,&quot; said Pruitt. Again, can&apos;t we just learn to live with a little less grouper on the table, at least for a few years? We&apos;re no experts on the issue, but if there are limits on supply, wouldn&apos;t that drive prices up (so fishermen can stay in business) and people just adjust to eating less grouper because of the increased cost?

 Opening Soon: Andu Restaurant 
 
 
Check out these interior photos of the soon-to-open Andú Restaurant&amp;Lounge. If the food is as sleek as the decor, this place is going to be quite a hit. We kind of like those big white designs on the walls. They remind us of bubbles.

We just learned that Andú will be opening its doors on Monday, February 11, which is well after &quot;late December&quot; as we were told earlier , but you know how these things go. The sample menu items we&apos;ve seen are the same ones we posted about last time, so we won&apos;t bore you by repeating them, but we will repeat that we are incredibly excited about a mac &apos;n&apos; cheese with a manchego crust. YUM.

Also, we should note that the restaurant is hiring servers, so if you&apos;re in need of a job, check out the ad .

 Burger King Branded Salty Snacks Coming To A Store Near You! 
 
At least that&apos;s what we think this article says. It&apos;s all restaurant-industry business speak. But we think there will be BK-branded chips in vending machines and BK restaurants: The Inventure Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:SNAK) today reported that vending channel test marketing results for Burger King brand salted snacks exceeded managements&apos; expectations in the fourth quarter of 2007. Based on these results, Inventure intends to pursue a national rollout of the brand into the vending channel. Inventure expects this national channel expansion to improve capacity utilization at its Bluffton, Indiana manufacturing facility, where all Burger King snacks are produced.

Test marketing in convenience store, drug store, and grocery store channels beginning in the first quarter of 2008 have generated significant retailer interest. Mass merchandiser and club store tests are expected to commence in the first half of 2008. Burger restaurants are scheduled to test the Ketchup&amp;Fries snack product throughout the first quarter of 2008 in certain markets in Ohio and Florida.

Inventure is developing additional new items for the Burger King snack brand for potential test marketing in the second half of the year to complement the Ketchup&amp;Fries and Flame Broiled items. Um, ketchup-and-fries-flavored chips? We&apos;re confused. That doesn&apos;t sound appetizing at all.

 Opening: The Smoking Rabbit 
 
Miami Beach has a gastropub: The Smoking Rabbit, which occupies the former space of departed seafood restaurant 510 Ocean. It hasn&apos;t been open for long, but already it&apos;s got two reviews on Yelp . Here&apos;s one of them: Daily Candy called this an English inspired &quot;gastropub,&quot; but I saw no sign of pub-ish-ness in the place. First of all, no English brew whatsoever. We were told that it was just the soft opening and they planned to have some English beer soon, but there is no tap behind the bar, so I&apos;m not sure that it will make much of a difference.

We were just having drinks, but we took a look at the menu for future reference. A few things sounded interesting, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d spend the money.

The owner was there, strutting around the place, looking proud of himself. A handful of the beautiful people were eating; I got the impression they were friends of employees. The rest of the patrons consisted of some very confused looking middle aged tourists.

The music was basically what would happen if you put my entire iTunes playlist on random. It went straight from Billie Holiday to Billy Joel. I am not making this up. The other review glows about the mac &apos;n&apos; cheese, burger and pumpkin salad. For us, the mac &apos;n&apos; cheese is key; a good one is so incredibly satisfying, but a bad one is such a letdown.

We haven&apos;t received a menu yet, but we hear it changes daily. Also, you should know that the phone number we&apos;ve seen listed everywhere appears to be a cell phone number, so unless you want to leave the owner a voicemail message, you might want to try the restaurant number instead (305-531-2100).

 And The Grouper Saga Continues 
 
 Florida grouper prices are on the rise, as everyone knows, for a number of reasons, one of which is the dwindling supply of the fish in the Gulf. Studies show that gag grouper (also called black grouper on some menus) are being fished at unsustainable levels, so the feds are stepping in to curb that : Federal regulators took preliminary steps Tuesday to reduce gag grouper fishing in the Gulf of Mexico by 45 percent, a severe cutback that could cripple commercial fisherman and the charter boat industry.

The proposed restrictions would close down recreational grouper fishing for three months in the winter, just when tourists arrive.

Commercial fisherman would face a quota on gag for the first time, with limits tight enough to shut down the entire grouper fleet every year by October or so -- forcing restaurants and consumers to rely on imports.

The cuts would spill over to other grouper species as well, because grouper swim together, and it&apos;s impossible to protect one species without inadvertently cracking down on others.

&quot;This will cost the state of Florida $300-million in direct expenditures,&apos;&quot; said Dennis O&apos;Hern, director of a recreational advocacy group called the Fishermen&apos;s Rights Alliance.

With a bag limit of only one gag and only nine months to fish for any kind of grouper, anglers will not sink $20,000 or $30,000 into offshore boats and spend hundreds of dollars in fuel to go bottom fishing, O&apos;Hern said. Tourists will not spend $1,000 to hire a charter boat.

&quot;This is going to kill us,&quot; said Tarpon Springs charter boat captain Ed Walker. Migratory fish like king mackerel, cobia and tarpon hang out in warmer southern waters during the winter, he said. Red snapper, another popular offshore bottom fish, is already under tight restriction because of dwindling stocks.

&quot;Essentially they have left us nothing to fish for during the peak tourist season,&quot; Walker said. Fishing regulations are always so tricky. On the one hand, we don&apos;t want fishermen to go out of business; on the other hand, if something isn&apos;t done, they&apos;re all going to be out of business anyway when there are no grouper left to fish at all. It makes sense to impose restrictions for a few years to allow the fish population to regroup.

Here are the nuts-and-bolts of the proposals: Recreational anglers could not bottom fish for grouper from Jan. 15 through April 15, which spans the peaks of both the red and gag grouper spawning seasons.

During other months, recreational anglers would be limited to three grouper per person, per trip, down from the current &quot;bag limit&quot; of five. Only one of those grouper could be a gag.

Commercial fisherman would face a new gag quota of 1.2-million pounds in 2008, which would rise slightly in subsequent years as the stock rebuilds. According to the article, that new quota is a 45 percent cut. Which is a lot. Biologists estimate that the quota will force fishermen to stop fishing for gag grouper in October. We know that this puts a kink in winter tourists&apos; fishing plans, but we&apos;ll set that issue aside. What we don&apos;t understand is the problem of restaurants having to resort to imports or fake grouper. We all accept the fact that we can&apos;t get fresh stone crab claws year-round; why not adopt a similar attitude towards grouper? Given the dwindling fish supply, we might have to start thinking of fish in terms of seasons, so as to allow them time to reproduce.

 A Different Type Of Menu 
 
 
Ochopee is just a wee bit out of our coverage area, but we enjoy a little snark on a chalkboard in a restaurant as much as the next gal. This chalkboard comes from Joanie&apos;s Blue Crab Cafe on Tamiami Trail in Ochopee, just down the street from the smallest post office in the nation. We&apos;ve driven by this place countless times en route to Sanibel (where our godparents live), but we&apos;ve never stopped to eat there. Specialties of the house are blue crabs, of course, gator nuggets and strawberry milkshakes. Yum!

 Dogma Grill Opens Catering Business 
 
 
 Dogma Grill owners Jeffrey and Lisa Akin, who are described as &quot;hot dog hipsters&quot; in the press release, whatever that means, are launching a catering division. Need 50 hot dogs for junior&apos;s 10th birthday party? Or a lot more than that for a company picnic? You can get anything from the Dogma Grill menu; they&apos;ll set up a miniature grill on site to cook the dogs.

It&apos;s pretty crazy how quickly they seem to have become the hot dog authority in the area. According to the release, they&apos;ve only been around since 2002, and while there are just three locations (although in under five years, three locations isn&apos;t shabby), they seem to always be in the news somehow. We, sadly, have not yet tried the hot dogs at Dogma, but we&apos;d love to hear what you guys think about them.

 It&apos;s Primary Day! 
 
We should be more invested in the political process than we actually are, for a number of reasons, but ... we&apos;re not. That doesn&apos;t mean we don&apos;t do our civic duty on election day. But anyway, today is primary day in Florida, even if a) tons of people have already voted via absentee ballots and b) the Democratic primary doesn&apos;t count. Still, Floridians are flocking to polls ; we imagine that&apos;s because of the property tax issue that&apos;s on the ballot.

So, go vote. And check out the citrusy recipes posted by Leila over at MP: Boston , who is properly excited about the primary season.

 Mom&apos;s Experiment With Canistel 
 
 
We got our parents a CSA trial share for Christmas, and they have loved it so much that they&apos;re continuing for the rest of the season (well, splitting with our aunt and uncle). Our mom&apos;s really enjoyed scouring the internet for ways to use the new fruits and vegetables that appear in her CSA inbox. This week, canistel (or &quot;eggfruit&quot;) was a bit of a challenge, as she&apos;d never seen it before, but after a little research, she learned that it&apos;s related to mamey and would work well in a milkshake. I&apos;ll let her take it from here: In the process of making the shake I discovered that if I left it very creamy, pudding like, and served it in a small dessert dish, it is like eating a light yogurt. This definitely can be made into ice cream. I poured them into dessert dishes and placed in the refrigerator to get cooler and will serve them after dinner today. Very, very yummy! Sounds tasty, no? It is. We&apos;ve got her full recipe after the jump...

Canistel &quot;Pudding&quot;

•about 2 c of canistel pulp from two very, very ripe canistels
•2 tsp vanilla extract
•1/3 c demerara sugar
•1 tsp nutmeg
•lowfat milk
•cinnamon, to taste

Place all of the ingredients into the blender. Add as much milk as necessary to get a pudding-like consistency. Mix until rich and creamy. Pour into dessert cups. Place in refrigerator until cool. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon when ready to serve.

 Closed: The Pier Coffee Shop 
 
The Pier Coffee Shop, which has sat on Anglin&apos;s Fishing Pier in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea for 46 years, closed its doors yesterday after a whole lot of drama between the restaurant&apos;s manager and the landlords. Nancy Pisarzewski, 62, the diner&apos;s longtime manager, had been battling with the building&apos;s owners over extending its hours past 3 p.m. and other issues. The last straw was their dispute over who had to pay a $3,515.25 water bill in December.

&apos;&apos;I thought, that&apos;s it -- I&apos;m not going to take it anymore,&apos;&apos; Pisarzewski said.

Its closing will end a long chapter in the pier&apos;s history at the end of Commercial Boulevard.

Once known as Tony Calderone&apos;s Pier Coffee Shop, it brought in snowbirds as well as regular locals. Calderone, the original owner, died in 2001, leaving the business to his son.

During high season, snowbirds migrated to the five outdoor booths or took a seat at one of the 10 bar stools or three booths inside.

&apos;&apos;How good is life when you can sit on a pier, stare at the ocean and eat a wonderful breakfast?&apos;&apos; said Judy Swaggerty, executive director of the Lauderdale-by-the-Sea Chamber of Commerce. &apos;Everybody now is like, `What are we going to do?&apos; &apos;&apos; Well, they&apos;re likely going to eat at the same place, once the landlords, brothers Spiro and Louis Marchelos renovate and re-open it. It looks like it got pretty ugly in the few weeks before the closing. Here&apos;s the story from the brothers&apos; side: Pisarzewski said her decision to close comes after three tense years with the landlords, who recently added $1,000 to her $3,000-a-month rent.

Brothers Spiro and Louis Marchelos, the diner&apos;s landlords who also own the nearby Athena-by-the-Sea restaurant, said Pisarzewski went three years without a rent increase and that they have done their best to accommodate her.

They wanted her to extend the diner&apos;s hours past 3 p.m., to see the place use its potential.

The Marchelos brothers were passing out fliers outside the restaurant on Thursday, giving their side of the story.

&apos;&apos;Rather than accept the increase or even discuss it, the Pier Coffee Shop has, with great drama and angst, and with the spreading of much misinformation, elected to leave the pier,&apos;&apos; the flier read. ``We regret their leaving but we cannot be held hostage by their failure to adapt to changing time and to take advantage of new opportunities.&apos;&apos; The comments after the story, which are usually awful, are pretty interesting this time around, in that very few express sympathy for Pisarzewski and the diner. Instead, they cite maintenance issues and subpar food, and most seem to look forward to what the brothers will bring to the pier.

 Good Luck Finding Five-Star Service In Miami 
 
Well, five-star service according to Mobil, which released its annual hotel and restaurant rankings today . The only five-star hotel is the Ritz-Carlton in Palm Beach , and no restaurants received the highest rating. According to Mobil inspectors, while a lot of restaurants and hotels have the facilities to provide a five-star experience, the service isn&apos;t quite up to par. Which isn&apos;t exactly news around here. The good news is that there are a few four-star restaurants in the area: Blue Door , Wish , Azul and Palme D&apos;Or .

 Opening: Bonefish Grill in Boynton Beach 
 
 We&apos;d been keeping an eye on
 Bonefish Grill , which has been expanding at a breakneck pace. The newest location, in Boynton Beach, was supposed to open last fall, but you know how these things go. We have yet to see a restaurant open anytime near its scheduled date. But we did just learn that the Boynton location will be open for business at 1880 N Congress Avenue on February 11.

 Stone Crab Picnic At Coral Gable Farmers Market 
 
Busy weekend for foodies! Not only is there the International Chocolate Festival , but there&apos;s also a stone crab picnic on Saturday at the Coral Gables Farmers Market hosted by Slow Food Miami . Here&apos;s what Paula, of mango&amp;lime;, wrote about the even in the SunPost: The picnic starts at noon, but you may want to arrive early to watch Chef Roberto Ferrer, of Cohiba Brasserie in Coral Gables, demonstrate how to prepare a stone crab and avocado dish, from 10 to 11 a.m. And while you await your stone crabs, you can check out booths with organic produce, local honey, French pastries, spices and fragrant tea blends.

At the picnic, you pay for what you eat. Stone crabs will be sold for $10 per pound and provided by Judy the “stone crab lady,” who has been bringing seafood from Everglades City to the market for several years. Pick up some healthy sides from Whisk Gourmet Food&amp;Catering at an adjacent booth. Then head over to the picnic tables and join your neighbors for seafood and wine. Reno recommends a Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, but it’s up to you. Oh, and don’t forget your crab tools. The stone crabs will be cracked, but you’ll need some utensils to eat the yummy crustaceans. Also, remember that the picnic is BYO, so pack a bottle of wine.

 Elsewhere In The Menuniverse: Marshmallows! 
 
• MP: Philadelphia tells us about a marshmallow cookbook . Yep, a whole cookbook about marshmallows, which include honey and cardamom marshmallows, champagne marshmallow wedding cake, and blood orange, rosemary and zinfandel fluff. Seriously. We&apos;re kind of excited.

• MP: San Francisco is a little surprised by a proposed alcohol ban in a nightlife-heavy district of San Francisco.

•Colony Collapse Disorder distresses us. We like honey, and when bees get disoriented, they don&apos;t produce honey. MP: Boston is also concerned, and she provided us with a trailer of an upcoming documentary of CCD .

• These lemons provided by MP: Chicago look so damn tasty.

 Video Evidence That Le Tub Burgers Are Enormous 
 
 
Hey! That&apos;s our waiter! We recently went to Le Tub , and we were happy to see the same man who brought us our cheeseburgers and fries in this Plum video. Those burgers are huge. We tried valiantly to finish, but couldn&apos;t. About two-thirds of the way through, we dumped the bun and focused just on the ground sirloin, but even then, we couldn&apos;t finish those last few bites. Next time, we might share. But, we definitely agree that it was tasty.

 Things We Never Knew: Sangria Is Illegal In Virginia 
 
It&apos;s taken the Virginia legislature 74 years to come to its senses. That&apos;s how long it&apos;s been illegal to mix wine or beer with spirits . So ... no sangria. Since 1934, the state has prohibited mixing wine or beer with spirits. Frances McDonald, vice president of La Tasca Spanish Tapas Bar and Restaurants, found that out the hard way when his Alexandria location was cited for violating the sangria ban in 2006 and fined $2,000.

McDonald and managing partner Shana McKillop appealed their case to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board on Thursday before going to the Capitol to urge legislators to pass a bill legalizing the red wine, liqueur and fruit concoction.

McDonald said his business received no warning about the ban. He said he was unaware of the prohibition and had he known about it would not have located any of his five restaurants in Virginia. &quot;It&apos;s like not being able to serve tequila in a Mexican restaurant,&quot; he said.

The Alcoholic Beverage Control Department agent who cited La Tasca even ordered restaurant employees to pour its sangria - about 40 liters - down the drain, said Shana McKillop, managing partner at the Alexandria restaurant.

A ruling on the La Tasca&apos;s appeal should take two to four weeks, said Kristy Marshall, a spokeswoman for the ABC Department. In the meantime, the restaurant has taken to modifying its sangria recipe. The brandy has been eliminated and the triple sec replaced with a nonalcoholic orange liqueur.

&quot;It&apos;s still sangria but not as authentic as we&apos;d like to offer our guests,&quot; McKillop said. Perhaps the &quot;no mixing wine or beer with spirits&quot; rule should be replaced with a rule that makes pouring sangria down the drain illegal.

 Reviews Of The Week 
 
 At MenuPages, our legions of users submit reviews regularly for their favorite (and often least favorite) restaurants. Some make it onto the website, others don&apos;t. Here, we&apos;ll go over the week&apos;s best and worst reviews. 

This week&apos;s reviews were about 50/50, in the sense that about half got validated and went online. We&apos;ll start with a few of the ones that didn&apos;t quite make it onto the site, like this one for Marios Latin Cafe : THE BEST CHURRASCO Move the fingers away from the Caps Lock key, guys. Also, perhaps a few more details about the restaurant would be nice. On to the next &quot;winner,&quot; for Caffe Portofino My husband and I have been going to this restaurant since it opened. Mauricio, the owner greets his guest with a caring smile on his face. He wants to make sure everyone has an excellent experience. My favorites, the Sea Bass! All fish dishes are cooked to perfection and accompanied with fresh vegetables and mashed potatoes. We have yet to try something we have not been 100[%] satisfied with. The portions are perfect. You&apos;ll even have room for dessert and at Cafe Portofino, that is a must. Mauricio came up with what I call the specialty of the house, a &quot;Warm Guava&amp;Cheese Pastry with Ice Cream&quot;. Everything on the menu is outstanding, not to mention thier nightly specials.
If I had to mention one negative thing about Portofino, it would be that the best kept secret is getting out. The last couple of months that we have been there, we have ran into celebrities, top South Florida utives, and even very successful Food&amp;Beverage business owners who enjoy eating at Cafe Portofino.
I highly recommend it. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do. Dear shills out there: We kind of like it when you make it so easy to identify your handiwork, but here&apos;s a little tip. When you say something along the lines of &quot;the only negative thing is that the secret is getting out!&quot; it&apos;s a pretty obvious clue that this is coming from someone closely connected to the restaurant.

The good ones this week weren&apos;t so great, but we&apos;ve got a winner regardless. This one is for Yard House : We have eaten at the Yard House on numerous occassions. The food is always excellent. The service can vary from good to fantastic depending on the time and the waiter/waitress. The atmosphere is very relaxed. Great place to take the family. Great outdoor seating as well!

 Too Much Tekka Maki May Be Hazardous To Your Health 
 
We all know that tuna has lots of mercury, but wow, these reports that recently emerged list some scary-high levels of the stuff in tuna. The New York Times wrote about it recently , comparing the mercury levels of tuna in a number of Manhattan restaurants. Today, the Miami Herald lists the levels for a few restaurants in our neck of the woods: At Su-Shin Izakaya in Coral Gables, the level of mercury in a piece of tuna sashimi was 1.2 parts per million. At 1.0 parts per million, the FDA can take action to remove the fish from the market.

A sample taken from a Publix in Coral Gables registered mercury levels at .93 parts per million, just under the FDA limit. A Publix in St. Petersburg had the highest levels of all grocery store samples -- 1.8 parts mercury per million.

Samples from Publix stores registered seven of the 10 highest mercury levels in the grocery store group.

Publix spokeswoman Maria Brous said the company needed to review the study with its suppliers before determining what action it might take.

&apos;&apos;We work with our suppliers to ensure the quality of our fish,&apos;&apos; Brous said. ``We have very high standards for the freshness and quality of our products throughout our store.&apos;&apos;

Kazuhime Abe, whose family owns Su-Shin Izakaya, found the study results ``very disappointing and upsetting.&apos;&apos;

&apos;&apos;We&apos;ll definitely press our purveyors to check their sources and see if there is a better way,&apos;&apos; Abe said.

Though tuna is one of the restaurant&apos;s top sellers, Abe says she already tries to persuade regular customers to try other fish.

&apos;&apos;This is a call to consumers to open up their palates and try different things,&apos;&apos; said Abe, whose family also owns Lan Pan Asian Cafe in South Miami and Yuga Restaurant in Coral Gables.

Oceana&apos;s findings reinforce other studies that show more expensive tuna usually contains higher levels of mercury because it comes from bigger fish, which accumulate mercury from the smaller fish they eat. Pretty frightening stuff, and there&apos;s no easy, quick fix. We&apos;re big tuna fans, and we used to eat a lot more of it, but we&apos;ve cut back in recent years. After seeing these numbers, we&apos;re thinking we should cut back even more.

 We&apos;re Freezing Just Thinking About -50 Degrees 
 
We just finished reading this article , about winter in the coldest city on earth: Yakutsk, in Siberia, where the temperature can, and often does, fall to -50 degrees Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit). We read the whole article, and we&apos;re still trying to imagine exactly what -50 feels like. We can&apos;t, even with the help of the author&apos;s description: In Moscow, which has been my home town for four years, it&apos;s only hit minus 30C once, in early 2006, and the mercury rarely gets lower than anything a good, solid winter coat won&apos;t protect you from. So, before venturing outdoors in Yakutsk for the first time, I have decided to don a suitcase&apos;s worth of clothes to protect me against the cold.

Starting from the feet and working up, I&apos;m wearing: a pair of cotton socks, with a pair of thermal socks over them; a pair of ankle-high Gore-Tex boots; a set of thermal long-johns; a pair of jeans; a thermal undershirt (a present from a worried family member); a long-sleeved T-shirt; a tight-fitting cashmere jumper; a fleece; a padded winter coat with hood; a thin pair of woollen gloves (so that when I take the outer pair off to take photographs I won&apos;t expose naked flesh); a pair of gloves made of wool and Thinsulate; a wool scarf; and a woolly football hat.

Lumbering from my hotel room like the Michelin Man, and already breaking into a sweat due to the hotel&apos;s industrial heating system, I decide that I&apos;m ready to face everything Yakutsk has to throw at me. I stride purposefully out of the hotel door and... well... it really isn&apos;t that bad. The small oblong of my face that is naked to the elements definitely registers the cold air, but on the whole, it feels fine; pleasant, even. As long as you&apos;re dressed right, I think, this isn&apos;t too bad.

Within a few minutes, however, the icy weather begins to assert itself forcefully. The first place to suffer is the exposed skin on my face, which begins to sting, and then experience shooting pains, before going numb, which is apparently dangerous, because it means blood flow to the skin has stopped. Then the cold penetrates the double layer of gloves and sets to work on chilling my fingers.

The woolly hat and padded hood are no match for minus 43C either, and my ears begin to sting. Next to succumb are the legs. Finally, I find myself with severe pain all across my body and have to return indoors. I look at my watch. I have been outside for 13 minutes. It&apos;s a good read, if only to make you feel even more grateful that in Miami today, the mercury will likely hit 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, check out the Yakutsk version of sushi: semi-frozen slices of raw river fish. How long do you think it takes for fish to thaw when it&apos;s been sitting outside at -50 C for a few hours?

 Only One Contestant From South Florida In Next Season&apos;s Top Chef 
 
Top Chef doesn&apos;t premiere until March 12, but Bravo&apos;s giving us a chance to get to know the cheftestants early. This time around, there&apos;s only one with a South Florida connection: Andrew , who&apos;s from Fort Lauderdale and is a graduate of Johnson&amp;Wales in North Miami. He lives in New York City now, where he&apos;s a sous chef at an unnamed restaurant. But here&apos;s the info on him from the press release: AGE: 30
HOMETOWN: Fort Lauderdale, Fla. – currently resides in New York City
PROFESSION: Sous Chef in NYC
CULINARY EDUCATION: A.S. Culinary Arts, Johnson&amp;Wales, North Miami
FAVORITE SIMPLE SUMMER RECIPE: Diced strawberries, mango, tomato, cucumber, and jicama. Thai dressing (sugar, lime juice, fish sauce and siracha). Thai basil and mint chiffonade.

For the past two years, Andrew has studied everything from the French cuisine of Raymond Blanc to the molecular gastronomy of Ferran Adria. With food influences that range from African, Spanish, French and Thai to Vietnamese, Japanese, Latino and Indian, Andrew prides himself on being diverse in the kitchen. When Andrew isn’t working, you can find him researching cuisines at a bookstore or shopping for spices that are uncommon and of multicultural influences to adapt to his cuisine. He believes in translating the flavors and techniques from different cultures into innovative interpretations that do not stray far from their origins. His goal is to leave a legacy like the chefs before his time, which shaped him and his fellow chefs minds and refined their techniques. He says he doesn’t make food for mere sustenance, but to create an experience that impacts the soul. We totally LOVE that simple summer recipe (or at least we&apos;re almost certain we would love it), so we&apos;re already partial to this guy.

 We Need A Break From The Steakhouse Beat 
 
 
Our counterpart in Chicago steered us toward this site , which says that Miami may be seeing yet another steakhouse within the next year. Which is exactly what we need. According to the site, Gibson&apos;s Steakhouse plans to open a South Beach location in fall 2008 or early 2009. Of course, this could just be a rumor, but given the current steakhouse trend, we wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it were true. While we&apos;re sure that Gibson&apos;s is an excellent steakhouse, we&apos;re just up to our ears in large slabs of read meat down here, and quite frankly, we&apos;re bored by it.

 Sunrise Bars Forced To Close By Midnight 
 
The party will be shutting down early in Sunrise from now on. In order to keep alcohol-related violence in check, the city has decided to require that bars shut down by midnight , effective immediately. But businesses will have six months to apply for permits that would allow them to stay open a few hours more: SUNRISE - Hoping to curb alcohol-related violence, the city&apos;s bars and nightclubs are now required to shut by midnight unless they receive a special city permit to close later, according to new rules.

Sunrise Commissioners on Tuesday Jan. 22 gave final approval to an ordinance that will require businesses serving alcohol to close by 12 a.m.

Businesses wishing to stay open later may apply for a special exception from the city to close at 2 a.m. Monday through Thursday and 3 a.m. on weekends-the last calls permitted prior to the new rules.

...

Among the factors city officials will consider in granting special exception permits are how often police responded to emergency calls at a given business.

Bars and nightclubs where police have responded three times in a given year will be required to hire off-duty police detail to patrol their property.

&quot;It gives the city the leverage to offer the special exception,&quot; said Commissioner Joseph Scuotto. &quot;If we do have someone that had a lot of police calls responding to fighting and violence, now we have the ability to pull their special exception license.

 Heart-Shaped Peanuts, Just In Time For Valentine&apos;s Day 
 
 
We present to you a heart-shaped peanut, which we happen to think is adorable. Supposedly a farmer in China figured out a way to grow these things, although the general sentiment in the blogosphere is that this is likely an anomaly in a field of regular-shaped peanuts. Still, adorable.

 SPAMMOBILE Coming To A Fair Near You 
 
 Oh my goodness, there&apos;s a SPAMMOBILE at the South Florida Fair in West Palm Beach. It&apos;s the brainchild of one woman who is making it her mission to re-convert people to Spam, all from a big blue RV: [Sharen] Walker can tell you how SPAM holds a special place in the hearts of Hawaiians (they make sushi with it) and how it helped inspire a Broadway show (the Monty Python musical Spamalot).

Then again, what else do you expect from the woman who steers the SPAMMOBILE, a bright blue RV in the shape of - what else? - a SPAM can? Walker and her curiously decked-out vehicle, with the &quot;SPAMMY&quot; license plate were parked at the South Florida Fair this weekend (and will return next weekend), just one of many stops on the 40,000-mile annual trail of spreading the name of America&apos;s best-known canned meat.

&quot;What I have found out is that 98 percent of the population are closet SPAM fans,&quot; Walker said Monday during a quick breather from her fair duties.

And the other 2 percent? Walker won&apos;t talk much about them, except to note that SPAM may have been a victim of its own post-World War II popularity. As a generation raised on SPAM grew into adulthood, they decided they had had their fill. Now, Walker&apos;s job is to reintroduce them to it, plus welcome a new generation of SPAM lovers to the fold.

She does that by passing out samples - &quot;SPAMwiches,&quot; she calls them - from her vehicle-turned-makeshift commercial kitchen, replete with slicing and grilling stations staffed by five temporary employees.

As of late Monday afternoon, Walker, whose marketing company is contracted by SPAM manufacturer Hormel, had given out nearly 7,000 SPAMwiches, not to mention some prepacked SPAM Singles and the occasional SPAM magnet. We&apos;ve had Spam before, and while we found it OK, it didn&apos;t quite inspire the same kind of fervor in us. But we get a kick out of Walker&apos;s enthusiasm for it, and we&apos;d totally stop by for a free Spam sandwich sample.

 Check Please! Might Go Online Too 
 
We&apos;re sure you&apos;re all excited about Check Please! South Florida , so we thought we&apos;d share the news we learned today about the possible internet expansion : Once those checks are endorsed, their plan is to fund a new Web site found at www.check please.tv and expand to additional markets.

&quot;Check, Please!,&quot; which debuted in Chicago in 2001, will premiere its third edition in South Florida on Monday -- hosted by South Florida celebrity chef Michelle Bernstein -- after first expanding to San Francisco in 2004.

Check, Please! company founder and CEO David Manilow believes the format of the show, which invites three &quot;everyday&quot; people to critique suggested eateries ranging from the exotic and ultra-expensive to the Superdawg Drive-In, is well-suited for the Internet.

&quot;We always knew the idea of people watching shortened video clips of the show in segment form made sense,&quot; said Manilow, 48, a lifelong Chicagoan. &quot;But the bandwidth [for video] was not there when we started the show.&quot; The site is very Chicago-heavy right now, although there is some San Francisco content (those are the only two locations that currently have Check Please!), and we imagine there will be some South Florida content up once the show airs.

 Pollo Campero Is A Big Hit In Boynton Beach 
 
 Pollo Campero seems to have made a big splash in Boynton Beach, where Central American immigrants are flocking to get chicken from the popular chain. We thought Boynton Beach was an interesting choice for the first location in Florida, but it doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;ll be the only one for long; the company is planning to open four more sites in Miami-Dade later this year. The Pollo Campero on Congress Avenue, in the new Boynton Town Center shopping development, was packed on Friday as community leaders, residents and company officials from the United States and Guatemala celebrated the chain&apos;s Florida debut.
...

Pollo Campero, the largest Latin American chicken restaurant chain, is on the cusp of a global explosion.

The family-owned fast-food franchise has more than 260 restaurants with 10,000 employees in 11 countries, including 37 locations in the United States.

Its goal is to reach 2,000 stores worldwide by 2013, including 500 in the United States, said Chief Executive Officer Juan Jose Gutierrez, whose father, Dionisio, founded the company in 1971.

It&apos;s an ambitious plan, Gutierrez said, but he&apos;s confident in the recipe his father concocted in the family&apos;s kitchen years ago.

It is still the chain&apos;s mainstay today.

&quot;He didn&apos;t visualize what he really created,&quot; Gutierrez said of his father, who died in 1974. &quot;In the next five years, we&apos;re going to have a lot of work to do.&quot;

The company hit $380 million in sales last year, with 2008 projections of $435 million, he said.
 Get this: There are also Pollo Camperos in Spain, Indonesia and China, and the company is eyeing the South Pacific, the Middle East and South America. Soon, there will be Pollo Camperos everywhere!

We have yet to try the chicken. Has anyone gone? What did you think of it?

 Miami&apos;s CocoWalk Duplicated In Istanbul 
 
 We&apos;re a little hazy on the details, due to the language barrier, but we do know that some company is going to try to replicated CocoWalk in the Bahçeşehir neighborhood of Istanbul, which is on the European side of the city and is home to a university . Here&apos;s some more info from the Turkish Daily News : The Akiş, creator of the Akmerkez as one of the most successful shopping center projects of Turkey, now rolls up sleeves for the Akkoza Shopping Center in the district of Bahçeşehir, together with two other companies, Corio and Garanti Koza.The famous street of restaurants in Miami, USA, the Cocowalk will be replicated in Bahçeşehir to meet the demand.Three companies participate in the Akkoza project for the construction the Akkoza Houses consisting of 5.500 apartment flats. Located on the country limits of Esenyurt and Bahçeşehir, Akkoza Houses will have a fitness center, a festival park, and 11.000 square meters green field in addition to a business hotel, a private school and a private hospital.The shopping center here is to serve locals of the region as well as people coming from different parts of Istanbul. The project is expected to cost $900 million, and we think that includes the residential buildings also. It seems like a large sum of money to pay for ... CocoWalk. It&apos;s pleasant and all, but is it really that innovative or interesting?

Here&apos;s what blogger Blind Mind had to say about it in his review of the restaurant : Ok, so I stopped by Origin last night for dinner just like I said. It was incredibly good and I was reminded that I need to go back more often. Being that I was in Loserville, aka &quot;dining alone&quot; haha, I decided to sit inside rather than take up an outside table. It was kind of a bummer because one of my favorite things about eating outside there is that you get to see all the guys coming and going from &quot;Booby Trap&quot; next door...sinners haha. The inside is really nice and I think they repainted because I thought the paint used to be purple and its now a nice sage green. I could be mistaken though. There was one decoration that really stood out as an eyesore though. They have a staircase that leads upstairs to where the bathrooms are located and it is lined with 3 HUGE Alex Rodriguez autographed jerseys, one for each team he has financially sunk into the ground with his ridiculous contract before choking in the playoffs. I was thinking that either the owner is a huge fan or somehow A-Rod is involved with the restaurant, which would explain the eyesore jerseys since he has a huge ego to feed. Sure enough, 2 minutes later A-Rod comes walking down the stairs to have dinner with his wife who was surprisingly not that attractive at all. Now I understand the rumors that he cheated on her haha. We&apos;ll refrain from comments about Mrs. Rodriguez, but we are curious if A-Rod is an investor or owner. Maybe he&apos;s just such a huge fan of the place that he&apos;s donated three autographed jerseys? Unlikely. Anyway, Blind Mind continues with a description of the food, yadda yadda yadda, before returning to A-Rod: Overall it was another great trip to this South Miami restaurant and I can understand why they would consider opening another one in Key Biscayne. My bill came to $31 and I added $6 for tip. Not bad for 2 high quality apps, a huge sushi roll, and a beer. I definitely recommend that any Asian food fans check this place out. On my way out, I looked at A-Rod and he gave me one of those, &quot;Yeah, I know you know who I am, please dont bother me&quot; head nods. I can respect that, so I simply said, &quot;Go Sox&quot; as I walked past and he gave me the &quot;Thats funny...asshole&quot; smile haha. Heh. Nice going.

 Elsewhere In The Menuniverse: Democracy Does Wonders For The Appetite 
 
•Leila at MP: Boston was a political science major, just like us, but we can&apos;t seem to get into the primaries like she does . We commend her enthusiasm for the American electoral process, and we love her primary-themed posts.

• &quot;Ironbeer o no beber!&quot; over at MP: Chicago .

•We had never heard of Indian pizza prior to MP: Philadelphia &apos;s mention of it. We&apos;re kind of pizza purists, but we must say, we&apos;re intrigued by the idea of masala on pizza.

• MP: San Francisco introduces us to canned Bud Light and Clamato , which does not sound appetizing. At all.

 Free Key Lime Cupcakes! 
 
 
When we first read that the Conch Tour Train in Key West was giving out free key lime cupcakes to celebrate its 50th anniversary , we thought it was free cupcakes for everyone. Then we read more closely (this is what happens when you monitor dozens of sites each day -- you scan and misinterpret things easily) and learned that the cupcakes are only for the passengers. So if you want that cupcake, you&apos;re going to have to pay for the $25 tour, which will take you to all of the usual touristy spots (aquarium, shipwreck museum, Hemingway house, Sloppy Joe&apos;s , Truman&apos;s Little White House, etc.) in an adorable choo-choo train tram thing. You probably won&apos;t, but we just wanted an excuse to post the photo of that tasty key lime cupcake. That can&apos;t be too hard to make, right? We might give it a try.

 An Inside Look At The New Texas de Brazil 
 
 
In case you were wondering what the new Texas de Brazil on South Beach looks like inside, here&apos;s a photo for you. We learned that the menu is much like that of the other Texas De Brazil in Dolphin Mall, but the new one has a sushi bar. Is there a law on the city&apos;s books that states that every restaurant on the beach must serve sushi?

 Review Of The Week: And The Winner Is The Restaurant With The Longest Name 
 
 At MenuPages, our legions of users submit reviews regularly for their favorite (and often least favorite) restaurants. Some make it onto the website, others don&apos;t. Here, we&apos;ll go over the week&apos;s best and worst reviews. 

So, it&apos;s our favorite Thursday post, when we go over the user reviews of the past week and pick out the best and the worst. As usual, we&apos;ll start with those unfortunate reviews that never made it onto the site. First, a review for Papa Piccolo Pizzeria : After driving by the restaurant for so many years I finally decided to try the food. To my surprise the food was absolutely delicious! The food is homemade and served with a smile. The restaurant is hidden in the Kings Creek Village shopping center but has excellent parking and is open til 11 PM. For good Italian at an unbelievable price, Papa Piccolos is a must. You will be hooked. We smell a shill. Anyway, on to the next one, for Piazza de Franco : good food you are crazyy ... We always get a few of these. You know, it couldn&apos;t hurt to elaborate just a bit. It&apos;s the same deal with this one, for Boonies Restaurant&amp;Lounge : i think they had the worst food and service i have ever had We&apos;re definitely not going to validate it if that&apos;s all you write. Perhaps if you explained why the food and service were so bad, we might consider it.

There weren&apos;t too many that actually made it onto the site this week; it was a week of one-liners and excessive exclamation points. But, we did have a winner: &quot;Satisfied Customer&quot; who reviewed Dolores, but you can call me Lolita : Decent place and I&apos;d go there again. But here&apos;s some detail...

Had to wait over an hour, even with a reservation (anyone see that episode of Seinfeld? - what&apos;s the reservation for?!) I think they just like to milk the drinks while you wait.

Anyway, once inside, the food was pretty good. Our orders were correct (6 of us) and the meal cost included an appetizer per person. Meals were either $18 or $23.

They DO charge for refills on soda which is odd. Desserts were only $2.50, but also not so great (4 choices in total skip the mango stuff - in fact, skip dessert altogether).

Service was good. We had a nice waiter who spoke enough English.

Parking... $10 for valet and $10 for nearby parking. We found $1.25/hr on the street within 100 yards.

Lots of places to go so I wouldn&apos;t rush there. But it was worth one trip and we cannot say anything bad about it in general. Congratulations Satisfied Customer! You win ... the distinction of having the winning review of the week. Sorry, but there&apos;s no material prize associated with this. Only honor and glory. Well, maybe not even much of that...

 Decision 2008 In Fort Lauderdale 
 
No, we don&apos;t mean the presidential election. We mean the decisions entrusted to you regarding the menu items at Hi-Life Cafe . Chef Carlos Fernandez (yes, the guy from Top Chef Season 2) has come up with a new menu and is asking diners to vote on which dishes should stay and which should go. They can use comment cards or head to the website and vote there (although there doesn&apos;t seem to be any page devoted specifically to that). Let&apos;s hear from Fernandez himself (via press release): “Hi-Life Café’s new menu will be tailored to its diners,” Fernandez notes. “With each New Year come new challenges and, in 2008, Hi-Life wants to demonstrate true democracy. Customers will cast their vote to decide which new dishes remain on our menu and which ones should be retired.” We should note that the new menu isn&apos;t available yet, but will be ready in a week or two. After that, the voting begins!

 A Guide To The Area&apos;s Moveable Restaurants 
 
There are some restaurants that won&apos;t ever be featured on MenuPages, unfortunately. Romeo&apos;s Cafe for instance. Despite the fact that everyone we know who&apos;s been there has raved about it, the restaurant doesn&apos;t have any sort of menu, which is a problem for a menu directory site. Moveable restaurants, which in addition to having no fixed location also rarely have set menus, fall into that group as well. But the folks over at the Miami Herald have launched a new version of Miami.com, and in it we found a useful guide to food trucks in the area. We&apos;ve already written about Orale! , but we were happy to learn of trucks that sell Haitian roasted nuts and smoked ribs.
