Myself Credit score ~790 About 160K in avail credit card lines from churn and AORs, Owe 104K (at 4.75% on house worth about 130K and about 14K in student loan debt at 1.5% rate (will be paid off in about 7 more years), No other debt, just normal bills. Will earn about 65K this year.
Fiance: Just discovered last week credit score about 560, Owes 16K on a car loan at 8.99% for 72 m, 4 years remaining, Owes 37K in student loans for her grad degree (Some were not subsidized, and all will be out of deferment by July 2012 and acruing at 6.8%.) She only has about $500 in credit cards that will be paid off in about 2 weeks. She&apos;ll earn around 45K this year.I discovered the issue last week when she was declined for 2 cc apps I had her do for bonuses.
We pulled a report and her credit is not bad, she just has little of it. She basically has like 3 ccs worth about 2K total in lines, but the one she owes on was recently over 500 due to a late fee and its limit is $500 so thats a ding. Looks like she often pays that one a smidge over 30 days normally, but she pays so a slight ding.
She prob got 2 dings for the 2 apps I encouraged her to do.
I am MAD that she did a new car loan 2 years ago at 8.99% for 72m and that is just eating me up inside.
Her student loans should be cut in half soon as she should qualify for a big paydown due to the place shes worked for several years now meeting that requirement.
One thing on her student loans, is on her credit report, 2 of them report like she is &quot;over the limit&quot; because they have been unsubsidized and acruing interest for 2 years. So they report sort of like an over the limit card. She has already been paying on those for the last 6 months consstently.She really doesn&apos;t have bad credit, its just the little she has allows a couple small things to make a big ding.She&apos;ll be moving into my house in a bit over 2 months.I&apos;m not sure what to attack first. Apparently there is no big student loan consolidation program like I had to reduce the rate.
I&apos;d have her immediately refi the car to a 4 year penfed at 1.99% but based on her score she wont be approved.
She prob lost 30 pts on her score for the two apps I convinced her to do.I would even consider just putting the car in my name to &quot;refi&quot; or buy it, but I dunno how that works as far as insurance and taxes now being in my name, etc.
My current card is paid for as of 3 years ago, but I&apos;m considering buying a another car in the next 6 months and looking for less than 2% to 0% interest at that time.Not sure whether to say, once shes out of her apt lease, that we start throwing $1000 per month at her student loans first, or put an extra 100 towards the car to cut it from 4 years to 3.1 or refi the car to my name and still pay the same extra total and cut it to 2.9 years and save 2K in interest on it.If I took on the car, I&apos;m responsible and I know its my obligation to ensure its paid and I will do so.
I just love FWF and I like to squeeze every dime out I can and It eats me up that shes gotta deal with 8.99% on the car, and 6.8% on the student loans.Thoughts? (Note, if you&apos;re feeling inclined to be negative or critical, then please post in another thraad.)

However, in some instances, it has its benefits (as mentioned in some college financing threads, it helps to keep from getting run through the wringer).Since I am not well versed in WLI, I would like to start discussing it here, as I am sure I am not the only one.I understand the premise, that I will pay more for this insurance and that at maturity I will get a payout, even if I survive. However, is the maturity date something that is flexible? For instance, if I am 31 now, and I want to reach maturity when I am 42, can that be worked out?Also, how does one determine if they are getting a good WLI rate or not? Since this is very different from term life insurance (TLI)? Also, since it is also an investment vehicle, where can folks look to find the best returns on these vehicles?Thanks, and let&apos;s please keep it a flame free zone. If you disagree about it being a viable option, perhaps you can ask questions of folks that utilize them and find out when it is a good option. Thanks again!

Classic Tobacco Sunburst Finish &quot;INFORMATION FROM WMS (the seller) as posted on SD:&quot;(disclosure: I work for WMS) For clarification purposes I am posting the following:1) these are the Light version. The difference between the pro and pro light is only in the body weight / thickness, and also that the light version is a close out. Washburns reason was there was too many models in the line and they are thinning it down. standards, standard light, deluxe, pro, pro light, win14, etc... then the same thing in WI, WMI, and WIM was just too many models. Speaking on the phone with the Washburn Rep today, I made absolutely sure I was 100% accurate... The Pro Light and the Pro are 100% identical except the Pro has a thicker body and is a bit heavier. I said to him... you know people will ask how thick, and what is the measurment difference. He said there is no spec on that because you could measure the thickness in countless places and get countless different measurments, but the difference he said was not that big a deal, and thus why they are thinnig down the line. 2) We wanted to use that factory image even though it was not a light version, but we put this up after washburn closed and did not want to post an image if there was a possibility of there being any form of difference. The sales manager finally called us back this morning and said that using that image is fine because you are only looking at the front. the images on our site were taken quick to get on the site as quick as possible. You are correct, the image on our site does not doit justice. We have a really nice camera that decided to stop working a couple days ago. Jason &quot;&quot;(I work for WMS.) Please allow me to correct. The pic is not wrong. There is a WIN model [4 knobs] and then there is a WMI model [2 knobs which is another model] this has 4 knobs and is a WIN PRO LIGHT. The PRO has a thick body and the PRO LIGHT is not as thick. See why it is a close out? Too many guitars that are too similar to each other, so they are thinning down their model offering.Jason &quot;THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE A CASE.
