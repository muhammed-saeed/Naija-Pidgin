Ganley running for seat in House

 Car dealer drops out of Senate race. Hopefuls file for May 4 primary

Car dealer Tom Ganley shifted political gears Thursday, dropping out of the U.S. Senate race to run for the U.S. House instead.

The last-minute change by the well-funded Republican sets up a possible high-profile matchup this fall with Democratic incumbent Rep. Betty Sutton, who gained national attention last year for her &apos;&apos;Cash for Clunkers&apos;&apos; program.

More than 20 people filed Thursday—the deadline for party candidates in the May 4 primary—to run for the four Akron-area congressional seats.

Ganley and Sutton will face competition in the primary.

Steven LaTourette, R-Bainbridge Township, and John Boccieri, D-Alliance, whose seat has been identified as a major target by the Republican Party, don&apos;t have primary challengers.

The candidates include people who have never run for office before and prominent business leaders, such as Ganley and former Wadsworth Mayor
Jim Renacci. They are hoping to cash in on unrest over the economy and government spending.

&apos;&apos;There is always a close relationship to the state of the economy and the incumbent party and how it is doing,&apos;&apos; said Steve Brooks, associate director of the University of Akron&apos;s Bliss Institute of Applied Politics.

&apos;&apos;That&apos;s part of what will evolve in the next two months. If the economy is still bad, that may not spell good news for the Democrats.&apos;&apos;

William Cunion, chair of the political science department at Mount Union College, agreed that Democrats could face a backlash at the polls if the economy remains poor or gets worse.

&apos;&apos;There&apos;s definitely a fear by Democrats,&apos;&apos; he said. &apos;&apos;It&apos;s not a good year to have a &apos;D&apos; near your name.&apos;&apos;

13th District

While Sutton and Ganley are the big names, the 13th District is packed with congressional hopefuls. In all, seven Republicans and two Democrats are running.

In addition to Ganley, a Brecksville resident, the Republicans are: James Brihan of Avon Lake, a certified financial planner and retired Cuyahoga County worker; Frank Chestney of Brunswick, a fast-food restaurant owner; Bill Haney of Brunswick, an account executive for a plastics packaging company; James Hrubik of Norton, a real estate appraiser; Jason Meade of New Franklin, a plant scheduler; and C. Todd Sharkey of Akron, an information technology worker.

In the Democratic primary, Sutton will face Justin Wooden of Green, a manager with a telecommunications company.

Ganley, who had planned to run for retiring U.S. Sen. George Voinovich&apos;s spot, turned in his petitions at the Summit County Board of Elections with little fanfare about 1 p.m. Thursday. He was accompanied by his son, Robert, who had considered running for the 13th District seat.

Ganley, who has 32 car dealerships in Ohio, including three in Summit and one in Medina County, represents serious competition for Sutton, a Copley Township resident. He had $1.6 million in his campaign coffers as of the end of last year, compared to Sutton&apos;s $210,380.

His decision also eliminates serious competition in the Senate race for former U.S. Rep. Rob Portman.

In an e-mail to his supporters, Ganley said he entered the race because the challenges facing Northeast Ohio residents &apos;&apos;are too many and too important to leave for future generations.&apos;&apos;

His campaign manager, Jeff Longstreth, said Ganley&apos;s goal is to take his business experience to Washington, D.C., to make changes. He said Ganley and his supporters decided running in the 13th District was &apos;&apos;the best way to do that.&apos;&apos;

&apos;&apos;Our polling information is through the roof,&apos;&apos; Longstreth said. &apos;&apos;We&apos;re pumped. He&apos;s going to win the race.&apos;&apos;

After filing his petitions, Ganley immediately traveled to Washington to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference&apos;s annual meeting, a trip he already had planned.

Sutton&apos;s campaign issued a statement downplaying the car dealer&apos;s decision to run.

&apos;&apos;Rep. Sutton has had opponents in the past and she&apos;ll have opponents in the future,&apos;&apos; said Nichole Francis Reynolds, Sutton&apos;s chief of staff. &apos;&apos;Regardless of who runs against her, she&apos;ll continue to focus on the job at hand . . . Since her first day in office, she has been effectively fighting to foster jobs and economic opportunity for the people of the 13th Congressional District.&apos;&apos;

Many of the Republican candidates said they aren&apos;t bothered by the crowded field.

&apos;&apos;Nobody is the same as far as their views,&apos;&apos; Meade said. &apos;&apos;Everybody has their different ideas and different takes and it gives people a choice of who they want to represent them.&apos;&apos;

The district covers portions of Summit, Medina, Lorain and Cuyahoga counties.

14th District

The race for the 14th District looks exactly like it did two years ago.

Dale Blanchard of Solon, an accountant; John Greene Jr. of Pierpont, a rubber worker; and Bill O&apos;Neill of Chagrin Falls, a retired judge and nurse, are facing off in the Democratic primary, just like they did in 2008, when O&apos;Neill won.

LaTourette, R-Bainbridge, who has held the seat since 1995, again has no primary competition.

John Jelenic of Willoughby filed to run as a Libertarian.

The district covers all of Ashtabula, Geauga and Lake counties and parts of Summit, Portage, Cuyahoga and Trumbull counties.

16th District

The race features some familiar and unfamiliar names.

The Republican contenders include former Ashland County Commissioner Matt Miller and radio personality and lobbyist Paul Schiffer—who&apos;ve tried for the seat before—and Renacci and retired accountant H. Doyle Smith, who are entering the congressional fray for the first time.

Kevin Kapel of Munson Township, the fifth GOP candidate, could not be reached Thursday.

Jeffrey Blevins of Wadsworth, a Libertarian, will be unopposed in the primary.

Boccieri, who faced Democratic opposition two years ago, also has the advantage of no opponent this time. This allows him to focus his funds on the November race. He had about $715,000 on hand as of the end of last year.

&apos;&apos;I&apos;m fighting for the people of this district—to make sure they get their fair share of federal resources and that we get the economy back on track and people back to work,&apos;&apos; said Boccieri, who lives in Alliance.

Renacci appears to be the GOP frontrunner, with the backing of the party and nearly $356,000 on hand as of the end of last year. This compares to Miller, who had $20,360 and Blevins with $109.

Renacci, who formerly co-owned the arena football team Columbus Destroyers, owns a nursing home, car dealership and medical supply company. He said more members of Congress with a business background are needed.

&apos;&apos;I&apos;m the only candidate who can say I created a job,&apos;&apos; he said. &apos;&apos;I&apos;m the only candidate who can say I&apos;ve balanced business budgets. I&apos;ve started numerous businesses. When it comes to life experience, that&apos;s the difference between myself and the rest.&apos;&apos;

Miller, of Ashland, a business administrator with the Salvation Army, doesn&apos;t think he should be counted out. He said he connected with people from the district in his two previous campaigns.

&apos;&apos;In this race, I am convinced I have the name recognition across the district,&apos;&apos; he said.

The district covers Stark and Wayne counties and parts of Ashland and Medina counties.

17th District

The biggest news in the 17th District wasn&apos;t who is running, but who isn&apos;t.

Former Congressman James Traficant, who was released from federal prison last year, decided not to enter the race.

Still, there&apos;s plenty of people who want to take out the incumbent.

Tim Ryan, of Niles, who was first elected in 2002, will face two Democratic challengers in the primary: Robert Crow of Youngstown and Daniel Moadus of Girard, a former Girard council member and owner of an auto body shop.

The Republican primary also features three candidates: Damian DeGenova of Poland, a lawyer; Jim Graham of Cortland, a pharmacist; and M.E. Henderson of Tallmadge, a physician.

&apos;&apos;It has been up to this point a strong Democratic-leaning district, but the kind of representation over the last eight years now has been leaning farther and farther to the left,&apos;&apos; Henderson said.

The district covers parts of Mahoning, Portage, Summit and Trumbull counties.
