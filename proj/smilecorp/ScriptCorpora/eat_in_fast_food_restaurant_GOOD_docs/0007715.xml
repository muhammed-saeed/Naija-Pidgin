 What to Expect When Your Relative Has Celiac Disease 
 Posted on July 12, 2012 by Chelsi 
My mom has Celiac Disease. It’s been an adjustment for the entire family. I don’t live by most of my family, so I get to have my mom come visit. That provides even greater opportunities for adjustments. There are some things I’ve learned and come to expect. For any just starting on this journey, I’ll share some of what I’ve learned.
 Don’t be offended if your family member/friend brings their own food. Think of it this way: If you were hosting an intergalactic guest, you wouldn’t be offended if they brought their own air. You wouldn’t say,“What?! My air isn’t good enough for you?”To them, your air is poison. For someone with Celiac Disease, your food is poison. You probably don’t want to poison them, so be understanding of their need to pack their own food. Someone with Celiac Disease may not trust your food preparation. For many celiac sufferers, cross-contamination is a big concern. Even gluten-free foods can become a problem if they come in contact with gluten, be it from a food or just a food preparation surface. That’s why food packaging lists if the food was prepared in a plant that also processes wheat. They need to know if there’s even a chance something could have gotten in there. Don’t feel bad if they’re nervous about what your counters might hold. They’re just trying to protect their health. Rinsing dishes and silverware at your house is not an indication that they find your dishwashing insufficient. My mom rinses everything she uses at my house. I rinse everything when I’m cooking for her and I rinse the dishes she’ll be using to eat. I use wheat flour in my kitchen. That dust probably settles on everything. We all feel safer when things are rinsed as a precautionary measure. They may tire easily. My mom has been diagnosed for almost two years. She has been diligent about her diet and treating her celiac appropriately. She still has to be careful not to overdo it. Be understanding when they just can’t do all that they used to. Hope that, as they take care of themselves, they will return to what they could previously do. Understand that it may be a long road. If you find a treat they previously enjoyed that is in a gluten-free form, surprise them with it! Making such extreme dietary changes and giving up foods they love is tough. Finding new gluten-free treats is a happy thing, especially if they’re also working to gain back weight they lost while their body wasn’t absorbing nutrients. 
There are more things to add, I’m sure. In fact, if you have other things you’d like to share, please do. I’d love to hear other tips and bits of wisdom. I’m the type that likes to know what to expect.

 Don’t Wave Your Waffle Over the Nutella 
 Posted on June 18, 2012 by Chelsi 
My mom came to visit this past weekend, which I always love. I do stress a bit more, knowing that I need to be careful with the food and cross-contamination. I never want to be the cause of pain for my mother, so I try hard to keep things separated and safe for her.

Sunday morning, I made Belgian waffles per my husband’s request, for Father’s day. I figured that the waffle irons would be contaminated with gluten, so my mom couldn’t have a waffle. Her breakfast would have to be French toast (apparently it was international day at our house). I try to keep gluten-free bread on hand for her visits, so I was set. I even had a brand-new jar of Nutella that was gluten-free! It was going to be a good breakfast.

As the family sat down for breakfast, I gave strict instructions on how to keep things gluten free.“Use the spoons to get the Nutella out of the jar, don’t set the spoons on the table, and don’t wave your waffle around over the Nutella.”Every understood and agreed. Breakfast was a go!

I continued to cook waffles while the family ate. My mom cooked her French toast and sat down to eat. When one of the waffles finished cooking, I took it to the table (in my bare hands) looking for a plate on which to set it. Turns out, that waffle was hot! And, like usual, I started bouncing it around in my hands…Right over the Nutella! All of my careful warnings, and I was the culprit!

My mom decided that it was probably okay, and she went ahead and still ate some. Fortunately, I hadn’t contaminated the Nutella, and she was alright. Crisis averted! But, I was reminded of how conscious I need to be about my actions when it comes to her food. Constant diligence! So, remember, when it comes to preparing food for celiac,“Don’t wave your waffle over the Nutella!”

 Sharing Experiences 
 Posted on April 14, 2012 by Chelsi 
We have a guest post today from a fellow Celiac Community member, Kim. I appreciate her sharing her story with us, especially since she has the experience of dealing with Celiac Disease with her child and herself.

“I have a daughter who has suffered with eating wheat ever since she could talk. We just never really realized what it was until noticing after she was done eating she would need to go put her knees up and just said her belly was hurting. It has been about 5 years ago that I found out through keeping up with her pediatricion and having a blood test done for Celiac. I have been blessed I guess to have only seen symptons these past 5 or so years and the only thing I noticed was rashes on my knees and elbows, for wich I would just go to the Dermatologist and he would perscribe a cream that would only help for a little while and then the rash would come back. I didn’t know that it was internal and that it was my Celiac coming out in my skin. I also have a brother that has Celiac as well and come to find that this Autoimmune Disease is coming in families. At first it was hard to really comprehend that it was no more wheat for us, but with positive attitudes and our family’s support, we deal with it quite well. Thankfully we have so many neat recipes and substitutes for gluten now days. And many stores and restaurants are starting to take care of us with Celiac. I think one of the hardest things for me is traveling and not having the convenience that people that can have wheat have, especially for my 9 year old daughter, because everything on the kids menu has wheat in it. So I learn to bake before we go and bring our gluten free snacks with us on our trips. I am very thankful for all of the new ways to learn to substitute for wheat and this website and other resources to help with this disease!”-Kim

Thank you for sharing your experiences, Kim. It’s so nice to have the opportunity to learn from and support each other.

 Celiac Got You Down? 
 Posted on April 13, 2012 by Chelsi 
Turns out, if you’re feeling a little blue, it could be linked to Celiac Disease. In 2007, Swedish researchers studied almost 14,000 people with Celiac Disease and compared them to the rest of the population. They documented a higher risk of depression among those with Celiac Disease. In fact, 37% of women tracked in another study met the clinical threshold for depression. It is a common issue, especially for women.

The reason for this link is not completely understood, but it could be related to the lack of absorption of nutrients that support a healthy nervous system, like vitamin B6 and folate. Another is the amino acid tryptophan. Our bodies convert tryptophan into seratonin, a chemical that helps regulate our mood. Lacking any of these could affect a person’s mood.

Research has show that adhering to a strict gluten-free diet can decrease the occurrence of depression. If you have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease, this is extra motivation to stick to go 100% gluten free. If you have a family member who has been diagnosed, and you haven’t been screened but suffer from depression, it’s another reason to get a screening. There could be a reason behind it all.

 Cooking and Baking Gluten Free 
 Posted on April 3, 2012 by gkidd 
Adjusting to cooking gluten-free can seem daunting, but it will quickly become routine. I searched websites and gleaned information from whomever I could and these are some of the things I do to try to remain healthy.

I have a friend who is allergic to poultry, who says she just stopped eating anything prepared at anyone else’s house; the possibility of cross-contamination is just too great to take the chance. I agree. With only a couple of exceptions, even though the food would be considered gluten free under normal circumstances, e.g salad, it just isn’t worth the risk. I don’t know the conditions under which it was prepared and there are so many ways in which it could have been cross contaminated.

Unless you are going to have a completely gluten-free kitchen, don’t eat food or use utensils that have touched the counter top. When cooking or baking, I get out a small plate on which to set measuring cups, spoons, etc. Baking ingredients, such as sugar and baking powder, can be contaminated by a measuring cup or spoon, so, even if you are baking for someone else, never put a utensil into them that has touched the countertop. If I am baking for someone else using wheat flour, I measure all the other ingredients and then cover them and put them away before I open the flour. It can take 24 hours for flour dust to settle, so I cover anything that I don’t want to be contaminated during that period. I have a separate set of gluten free cutting boards and a gluten free knife for cutting vegetables, chicken, etc. And be careful about sharing a hand towel with anyone eating foods containing gluten. I am sure I sound like a fanatic when I say that I try not to touch my food with my hands when I eat it, but I have suffered too many times from cross-contamination.

Metal pans that have been washed in the dishwasher are safe to use, but I love to bake in stoneware. I am hoping to someday have a complete set of gluten-free stoneware, but in the meantime, I cover all my pans and baking stones with parchment or wax paper. And until my children bought me my own stoneware muffin pan, I used cupcake papers to bake the muffins and biscuits that have been a staple of my diet for the past year or so.

READ EVERY LABEL!! I can’t stress this enough. And be sure to follow up on any asterisks. Look for disclaimers that say that the food was processed in a plant or on machinery that also processes wheat, rye or barley products.

There are a couple of things that I learned from the owner of a great little store here in Salt Lake City:
The word “malt”, when standing alone, indicates a substance made from barley and needs to be avoided. When used in a longer word, such as “maltodextrin,” it indicates something else entirely, and is safe.
Any vinegar is safe to use. You don’t have to look for “distilled.”

From my research, “autolyzed yeast” can be made from either baking yeast, which is safe, or from brewer’s yeast, which is not. You have to call the company to find out which they use in their products. Someone posted on a website that they had called Swanson and the autolyzed yeast in their chicken broth was safe. I have not worked up the courage to try it, yet. Pain has made me wary…or cowardly.

One of the most important things you need to do is to think about all the things you CAN eat and not dwell on what you can’t eat. And find ways to enjoy the same flavors you enjoyed before, but in gluten free form. For her birthday cake this year, my seventeen-year-old granddaughter requested the chocolate cheesecake I created because I LOVE chocolate cheesecake and wasn’t willing to live without it. Be positive, be creative, and please share with the rest of us.

 Gluten Free Snack Time 
 Posted on April 3, 2012 by Chelsi As I mentioned in my post A Week In Someone Else’s Shoes , when I did my gluten free experiment, I struggled most with snack time. So many go-to snacks are gluten laden. I want to share a few gluten-free snacks that I know and ask that others will add their favorite gluten-free snacks, as well.

I get the munchies, so I enjoy a good crunch from my snacks. A couple of my favorite gluten-free snacks are rice crackers and multi-grain gluten-free crackers from Crunchmaster. They give me that good crunch I desire, they’re low in fat and calories, and they’re yummy! I have eaten some that weren’t as good, so you have to find what works for you. But, I’m sure there are some gluten-free crackers out there that will meet your taste needs.

Another go-to, that is always gluten-free, is fresh fruit or veggies! There are some with Celiac Disease that have to be careful about these until their intestines have healed a bit more (see this post Help On A Lonely Road ). But, once your body can handle it, what a great source of healthy snacks that are naturally gluten free. As always, be careful of cross-contamination. 
Popcorn! I love popcorn! And, it’s gluten free. Also, if you avoid the buttery kind, it’s healthy—whole grain and full of fiber. What a great snack choice for anyone.

Need a sweet treat? My mom makes these delicious Peanut Butter Banana Bites that seem quite decadent. They are easy to make and would be a great treat, anytime. I’ll be posting the recipe, soon.

We’d love to hear your favorite gluten-free snacks and treats! Feel free to share!

 Healing From Celiac Disease Takes Time 
 Posted on March 28, 2012 by Chelsi For people diagnosed with celiac disease, as an adult, recovery may take longer than they hoped. I watched my mom deal with a long road to recovery. Following a gluten-free diet extremely decreased her attacks, but she still isn’t back to her full strength. And, she has to be really careful how hard she works. When she gets too tired or run down, she can have an attack. We found this really confusing, but I recently read about a study that could explain this, a bit.

In February of 2010, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases published some research that showed that for a lot of adults with celiac disease, damage to their intestines can persist after 5 years of following a gluten-free diet. Joseph A. Murray, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, MN, found that after 5 years on a gluten-free diet, one in three adults with celiac disease still showed intestinal damage. The research findings were reported in the February 9, 2010, advance online issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology .

This wasn’t the case with all of the adults studied, but it was for over half the adults. So, if you feel like your healing isn’t going as quickly as you’d like, you’re not alone. Be careful and give your body time. Because healing takes time.

 The G Free Diet—A Book Review 
 Posted on March 26, 2012 by Chelsi 
 
 I just read a book review of Elizabeth Hasselbeck’s new book, The G Free Diet. It was an eye opener. Elizabeth Hasselbeck is definitely one of the most public figures known to have Celiac Disease. She is very open about it and is trying to spread awareness of Celiac and eating gluten free.

Unfortunately, from this review, it sounds like she isn’t spreading completely accurate information. She pushes the Celiac diet as a weight-loss plan and as a treatment for Autism. She talks about her self-diagnosis, after her stint on Survivor. She writes about bingeing on Oreo cookies in the early days of her gluten free diet. There are many that feel her book trivializes the seriousness of Celiac Disease and the need for a lifelong commitment to eat gluten free.

Spreading better understanding of Celiac Disease is a good thing. Whether Hasselbeck is doing that is yet to be seen. Reading her book may be enjoyable for those who enjoy the perspective of a celebrity, but it doesn’t sound like a great source of new information or recipes. Has anyone read it? I’d love to hear the perspective of someone who has!

 Affording A Gluten-Free Diet 
 Posted on March 22, 2012 by Chelsi Does it seem, sometimes, like the world is overflowing with gluten? It’s in so many things, in places you’d never suspect. Fortunately, more and more gluten free options are appearing every day. As more people need these products, manufacturers are answering the call and providing them…at a cost. Eating gluten free is not cheap.

So, how does a regular person afford those extra-pricey foods? I certainly don’t have all the answers, but I recently found a very helpful tip. According to the Celiac Disease Foundation you can deduct the cost of a gluten free diet on your itemized tax return. There are some guidelines to follow and some math to do, but it could add up.

Claiming a gluten free diet as a medical expense requires, first of all, an official diagnosis from a doctor. It can’t just be for personal health reasons—it has to be medically required. So, get a note from your doctor (sound a little like you’re back in school?).

Secondly, you can’t claim the full expense of all gluten free foods, only that which is in excess of regular foods. Take bread, for example. If a normal loaf of bread costs $2.50 and a loaf of gluten free bread costs $5.00, you can claim the $2.50 difference. If you buy special items that are not required in regular diets, like xanthan gum, the entire cost can be deducted. This requires some serious receipt tracking and math, but it adds up.

If you make a trip to a specialty store to buy gluten free products, you can deduct the cost of transportation. Once again, great record keeping is key, but it could really be worth it.

As with all tax-related items, you should definitely talk to your tax preparer about it. And, if you’d like to, check out the article on the CDF Website. They have some great links to IRS documentation. Your accountant might appreciate that.

Following a gluten free diet can put a dent in the food budget, but this might alleviate some of that. Every little bit counts, right?
