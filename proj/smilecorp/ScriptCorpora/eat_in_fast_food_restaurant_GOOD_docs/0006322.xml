 Hot Dog On A Stick An icon since 1946, Hot Dog on a Stick™ is 100% owned and operated by its employees. What began as an entrepreneurial dream on the beaches of Southern California has flourished into an organization where everyone has a stake in the outcome. Our first store opened at Muscle Beach, Santa Monica, California in 1946. Our founder, Dave Barham, was a charismatic and enlightened personality who understood the value of treating people to an experience as opposed to a service. In short, he built his business around the concepts of putting people first, and giving them a show. His approach was extremely successful. By 1990 Hot Dog on a Stick™ had become an icon in our primary venue, shopping malls, with 60 stores operating in 12 states. After Dave passed away in 1991, we became an employee owned corporation (ESOP) led by a management team he had mentored over the years. This team has successfully overseen the company&apos;s expansion to 103 stores in 17 states. In addition, they undertook an international franchising program and designed and in 1998 launched a new concept called Muscle Beach Lemonade&amp;Hot Dogs™.
