Shawn Michaels turning heel for Triple H vs Undertaker program leading to WrestleMania 28?

We know we&apos;re going to get a match between Triple H and Undertaker at WrestleMania 28 on April 1 in Miami, Florida. This was established on last Monday night&apos;s (Feb. 20) episode of WWE Raw, where it was also revealed the two would have a Hell in a Cell match.

But there are still five episodes of Raw until then. Which means, quite obviously, they&apos;re going to have to figure out a way to fill the time between now and &apos;Mania.

Enter Shawn Michaels.

Triple H and Undertaker are both scheduled to appear at each show from here on out but &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; is also going to be involved in some capacity. It was originally reported by the Wrestling Observer that Michaels was all but a lock to be the special guest referee in the match, and that&apos;s still a possibility. But beyond that we only know the angle they&apos;ve been using so far, which is the fact that &quot;The Deadman&quot; got &quot;The Game&quot; to accept the match simply by bringing up the fact that he knows he&apos;s not as good as &quot;your buddy Shawn.&quot;

WWE decided to further the angle by posting a kayfabe phone interview on its website in which they ask Michaels about the situation and ask him if Triple H will, in fact, be better than he is if he&apos;s able to end the streak. The response was decidedly irate, as the article title suggests, and somewhat teases a heel turn.

Here&apos;s a snip from the interview after Michaels lost his cool over said question (and he was awesome during the entire thing):

 
 
 &quot;At the end of the day, you know what, my career is going to stand on its own. Where I stand in the eyes of everybody is the absolute best in-ring performer that has ever lived. Okay, so get that through your thick skull and try to understand this is about Undertaker and Triple H. And again, no matter how much I show up, do your absolute best -- me, I&apos;ve got no choice, see? I&apos;ve got no choice. I just show up and the spotlight goes on me. I can&apos;t help it. It&apos;s a curse. But I want you to, at the very least, try to do your best to keep your eye on the prize and that is the streak, Triple H and whether he beats that streak. When WrestleMania is said and done you can make your assessment. But until then, I suggest you shut your pie hole and leave me alone to live my retired life. Got it?&quot; 
 
When listening to it, Michaels went heel for a minute there. Sign of things to come?

There&apos;s still a large segment of the fanbase who don&apos;t enjoy the fact that a match between Triple H and Undertaker has so much to do with Michaels but this is really the best way to get HBK involved and if he is the special guest referee, tease the fact that we simply won&apos;t know which way he&apos;ll go with it. It would add an entirely new layer to the proceedings that simply won&apos;t be there otherwise.

And, really, they have to come up with some way to make us believe in some form or another that &apos;Taker&apos;s streak will be broken. At this point, it&apos;s still widely accepted that he won&apos;t lose at WrestleMania and if that&apos;s the case than the match is already somewhat of a failure because the outcome always needs to be in doubt. That&apos;s part of how they&apos;ve backed themselves into a corner with this entire mess with Triple H not wanting to hurt the business by defeating him (which also makes his intentions without the match somewhat cloudy, right?), but the involvement of Michaels could smooth out a few of the rough edges.

Not to mention make marks like myself really happy to see the best who ever did it back in some capacity.

Anyone think we&apos;re headed for something special at WrestleMania? Or is there a better way they could be doing this thing? If one of you Cagesiders has a better idea, let&apos;s hear it.

HBK getting involved can only help the match. I think it is a great idea.

The only thing better than HBK as ref would be some sort of surprise HBK interference. That might be really hard to pull it off as a surprise if HBk is showing up at a bunch of Raws between now and then. But you never know, maybe he will be that extra camera man inside the cell who takes off his uniform/wig late in the match and superkicks the hell out of one or both of these guys.

Well anyway, regardless of how they do it, I want HBK involved at Mania. He has a ton of history with both guys. It makes sense for him to be involved.

 Man, this whole thing is going to suck. 
 
Triple H being ABOUT to end The Streak when HBK ruins it for him out of jealousy would make Taker look like a chump and put the spotlight back on HHH and Michaels. Who cares? Who really cares? The last time these two were at each others’throats, they turned in a HIAC match so bad that it defies belief. If not for the Kennel in the Cell and the five minute HIAC on RAW back in’99, it would be the worst HIAC match ever.

I cannot care less about this match. I’ll probably be in an extreme minority, but the top four matches at WM are all shitty and I could not find a way to care less about any of them. The worst of those four matches, however, has got to be this HHH/Undertaker match. Awful, awful, awful.

 Are you trying to sell me on HHH/HBK at Badd Blood in 2004, 
 
A match that got damn near 5 stars from every wrestling writer worth his salt, is/was one of the worst HIAC matches? It may not be your cup of tea and many people just simply hate anything involving HHH because it’s what smart fans are trained to do but for me I’ll pay 50 cash to watch HHH/HBK in HIAC for another 50 minute match before I’d buy any mania with Cena or Punk headlining.

As far as the streak goes, the streak is a gimmick. Its fake. That doesn’t mean it is meaningless either. But one aspect smart fans are missing here is that Taker will choose how to end his career. He has earned that right and Vince isn’t going to make Taker lose to anyone that Taker doesn’t want to put over. If this is Taker’s last match and Taker has chosen HHH to close the curtain with then dammit he has every freaking right to do so and that is more important and more valuable and more than the streak.

If this is Takers last match, I’d say for him Mania is not about the streak, it is about how he wants to leave.

What? No it didn’t! It’s pretty much got a (more than fair) rep as an incredibly boring match that went on fifteen minutes too long. I know I’m not alone on that one.

Personally, I hate most things involving HHH because he sucks, but whatever makes you feel better about liking a second-rate mashup of Harley Race and Ric Flair, man.

Also, thanks for letting me know that the streak is fake. I thought wrestling was real!

Get out of here with that silliness.

 Harley and Flair are great guys to pattern yourself as. I never said they weren&apos;t. 
 
I just said that HHH is shitty at being even a tenth as good as either one of them. HHH can wear suits all he wants, but he’ll never be nearly as cool as Flair was. HHH can growl into the mic all he wants, but he’ll never be nearly mean or terrifying as Harley yelling“SOMEBODY TAKE THE DAMN MONEY!”He’s just not that talented.

The Daniel Bryan talking point you added is just weird and clearly you are flailing here. I’ll let you try to process what I actually said and then maybe you can add a coherent response that isn’t, well, stupid.

 Please don&apos;t lecture me on attitude. 
 
KenWO was a rude bastard. He gets rude bastard right back.

I also think your viewpoints tend to be absurd, but I try to just avoid commenting on your absurdity.

In any case, I can make more than a compelling case for my viewpoint. Whether anyone would want to read it is another story. However, you and guys like KenWO have an issue with any viewpoint that doesn’t match yours. In fact, you called out a separate issue (the protection of the streak as a draw) because you’re so upset that I don’t hold Triple H in the same regard you do. Find a way to monitor your own ability to address an issue without breaking down into, yes, stupidity before you lecture me.

 Dude you post like a know-it-all with no facts 
 
You have yet to provide facts that HHH and HBK are out to devalue the streak. Now lets actually value the streak for what it actually is, a gimmick made for the Undertaker so that WWE could give him marquee billing without putting him in the main event!!!!!

Wrestlemania will sell with or without the streak gimmick.

 Major, your post up above is what we call &quot;hypocrisy.&quot; 
 
You post like King Shit. You’re not.

And again, you cannot fucking read and comprehend, apparently. I did NOT say that HHH and HBK are explicitly trying to devalue the streak for their own ends. I did say that adding an HHH/HBK jealousy issue, which from THE VERY KAYFABED CALL THIS ARTICLE LINKS TO is obviously the road they are going down, would only hurt the mystique of The Streak and pit two guys against one another who really don’t have good matches.

I don’t actually think you are that stupid. I think you are setting up the strawman that I’m whining about POLITIKZ because you really just want to be a dick and argue without actually addressing the topic.

I’m also going to disagree with you about WM selling forever with or without The Streak. It’s a MAJOR main event draw every year at this point.

 I am King Shit, I take a really good one everyday 
 
If your opinion is based on this one phone interview done on WWE.com NOT WWE TV but WWE.com then hey have at it bro.

As far the streak being a draw for Mania, I’ll tell you for maybe 14 of those 19 years it hasn’t been a MAJOR draw at all. Or maybe I’m devaluing those matches with Kane and Mark Henry. WWE stumbled on the streak and when they actually became aware of it they really didn’t start pumping it until 4 or 5 years ago. I’ve had ppl tell me Mania would lose buys for not having a MITB match last year and that didn’t happen.

If there is no Streak match next year and the main event is something strong like Punk/Austin, no one will give a shit about a fucking streak.

 No, you&apos;re a dipshit, is more like it. 
 
Sorry if the truth is too crass for you.

First: Your illogical reasoning that because The Streak meant nothing in 2002, it doesn’t mean anything now is ridiculous. Nice appeal to tradition, though.

Second, MITB is its own fucking PPV, or was at the time. Of course people aren’t going to miss it at WM. When The Streak gets its own PPV, let me know.

Three, did your buddy Wade Keller tell you that no one will care about The Streak if it gets booked into oblivion? Sure, let’s use this logic with everything! If The Rock beats Cena in a five-minute squash, who cares if they booked their top babyface into oblivion? No one will give a shit if Punk/Austin is on next year’s WM!

How long can we string this sort of logical thought out? Hey, who cares if they book everyone non-sensically for the next year, a strong main event for next year’s WM will make that all mean nothing!

Was Takers win streak promoted heavily at anytime before say Mania 23? The reason the streak matches took more prominence is because THEY BOOKED NO NEW STARS AND AUSTIN AND ROCK WERE GONE!

Sure the streak means a ton now but guess what it is going to end either this year or next year and then what?

The MITB PPV came after Mania and no one outside of the smart fans even knew there would be a MITB PPV. Way to promote facts again. Dipshit!- Hey I like that word!

In your final illogical statement you suggest that no one will care a bout a CM Punk/Austin match as a Mania main event. LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL

Ok I’m done I actually have to take a dip shit.

 I doubt you are done. 
 
You’ll be back to throw up strawmen soon enough.

I never said no one would care about Punk/Austin. You’re just a dumbass.

You mentioned that last year, people tho ought that no MITB = bad news for WM. Last year is 2011. The first year of the MITB PPV is 2010. You are still a dumbass.

The Streak means a ton. Therefore, it should be continually booked to mean a ton until the WWE can afford to end it or until they can end it by transferring that heat onto a young star. Will they do that? Not if they go down this road, in my opinion.

You are so stupid that I find it amazing that you can breathe and type at the same time. And remember, dumbass, I’m just being a dick because that’s the only way you seem to understand the concept of communication.

I don’t really look forward to you coming back and being a dumbass all over this thread, but good luck with being“done.”Let’s hope you keep your promise.

If The Rock beats Cena in a five-minute squash, who cares if they booked their top babyface into oblivion? No one will give a shit if Punk/Austin is on next year’s WM! 
Read that again. Let me try to help you:

I said that your stance is that no matter how poorly the WWE books things, you think it won’t matter as long as Punk/Austin is on next year’s card. That is LITERALLY what that says.“Who cares if Cena is booked into oblivion? NO ONE WILL GIVE A SHIT ABOUT CENA if Punk/Austin is on the card!”

So, not only are you wrong–booking does matter and no fantasy matchup you can come up with can change that–but you didn’t even understand what the post said! Congratulations! You’re an idiot!

You took the quote out of context, but I don’t think it was malicious. I think you’re just aggressively stupid–just stupid enough not to realize how stupid you are. But come on, I can’t really have a discussion with you if you can’t even understand what you read, dude.

I notice that you did not address how wrong you were about the MITB PPV, by the way. I’ll assume that your silence is a tacit admission that you were, as usual, wrong, you dipshit.

 HMMM Where did I say booking doesn&apos;t matter? 
 
Even if the MITB PPV was in 2010, the masses didn’t know there would be a MITB PPV BEFORE Mania like you state so no matter the year you are still wrong.

Clearly my stupidity is entertaining your stupidity because a higher intelligence would have left the conversation long ago.

Right stupid?

 Bless your heart. 
 
I’m just amused until I head out tonight. You are pretty entertaining. Pretty stupid, too.

You said that the booking of the streak didn’t matter, but now you’re confused about what you just posted.

You think that the masses, after having seen WWE debut a whole new PPV in 2010 called Money in the Bank, would not expect there to be a Money in the Bank for 2011.

You are so upset that someone thinks that this angle is heading down an improper path, and you’re sure that it isn’t because Undertaker is on it! and your boy Wade Keller told you so.

I can’t be mad at you. You can’t follow an argument. You make up strawmen and misread half of what I post. Maybe you are just bored–after all, didn’t you say that you were out of here a few posts back? I get it, you lost. You dug yourself into a hole, and now you need to save e-face. I get it, it’s okay. Just move on, son. :(

 New word e-face! You&apos;re good 
 
1. No where did I say booking doesn’t matter. You assume I mean that because I don’t agree with you. I simply state that HHH/Taker will not be an overbooked clusterfuck designed for some HHH/HBK spin off feud. NO WHERE DO I SAY BOOKING DOESN&quot;T MATTER. I repeatedly have said Taker has earned the right to decide his fate and book his way out if he so chooses.

2. You said MITB had no effect on Mania buys because ppl knew it would have it’s own PPV. Well I ot the year wrong but either way in March 2010 no one knew that MITB would be it’s own show. But whatever.

3. I’m glad I entertained you because you entertained me as well

I successfully transferred your anger from HHH to my buddy Wade Keller. I turned Keller heel!

For someone that says a person can’t follow an argument, you call names and spew garbage like a true socially challenged person.

Love that sad face btw. Did you come up with that yourself?

 And since Orton, it has been positioned as at worst the semi-main event of each card. 
 
It is a big part of WM’s draw at this point. It needs to be protected until Taker is truly done or until someone snaps the streak.

 Let me actually expand on this while I am here. 
 
If you look at HHH as a heel, you see that he tries to emulate two guys, Harley and Flair. Let’s take something that is core to both of those guys as heels: The babyface comeback.

If you watch any Flair match where he’s heel, say his matches with Sting or Steamboat, you will note that he eats offense REALLY well, especially when the babyface fires up for the stretch run. However, Flair also knows how to let a guy get over on him at the beginning, and in the middle of a match when he cedes control to a babyface before cutting off the comeback, he let’s the babyface go on enough of a run on offense that it gets the crowd up and back down when he takes control again.

You take something like Flair/Steamboat at Chi-Town Rumble, for example, and you see especially in the middle of each fall that Flair knows how to stooge, how to sell that Steamboat is firing up. His facials show extreme worry/fear in a great way, and he physically sells in a wonderful way for Steamboat’s chops, etc.

Harley Race has more of a tough-guy character, but even he would give so much to faces on comebacks. Watch Flair or Funk go after him on a comeback; you’ll see that Race has like the best fucking facials ever. He plays the big bully who has just run into his match and now reveals himself as a coward by backing away and eating offense nicely.

OK, so let’s look at HHH in his big heel runs in‘00 and’03. You look at his stuff against a guy like RVD, and it’s clear that he’s the big bully that should be taking RVD’s offense at the beginning and at the end for the big stretch run like it’s killing him. But he doesn’t sell fear well AT ALL. He did do this well against Foley in‘00, which Mick mentions all the time, but after that he treated babyface comebacks completely nonchalantly. It takes you out of the drama of the match. You will also note, if you watch his heel stuff, that he is RUTHLESS about cutting babyface comebacks short. It’s really terrible. I am trying to remember specific matche because I sat down to watch his’03 stuff in order to reassess him two or three years back, but I seem to recall his work against RVD and babyface Orton being prime examples of this.

I am in the minority, but I think HHH is a FAR superior worker as a face. He’s not a great worker in any case, but he has a much better idea of how to work effectively in that role, especially in stuff where he’s playing the Vet Babyface Takes On The Odds role that he did last year against‘Taker. I don’t like that match all too much because I’m overloaded on WWE Epic Main Event style, but that role works for him.

Anyway, that’s just one way in which I would critique HHH’s work. That was also short and only had a few examples. I could write a book about this, but no one wants to read it.

 Lets temper your natural sarcasm with actual facts. 
 
Wade Keller PWTORCH.com
 STAR RATING: ****1/4—A very appropriate match given the build-up. Exhausting and believable, if not necessarily exciting most of the time. Very good, but short of a classic as the finish didn’t have the adrenaline rush, by design, of many other great matches with more energy in the final minutes. This match couldn’t have that energy at the end and still communicate the intended point, which is that this was the final chapter of this feud. Whether it actually is in the long-run isn’t known, but for now that’s what it was 
designed to communicate–and it did. 

That is just one I don’t have time to go through Observer reviews from 8 years ago but you get the gist of the match from Keller. There is a Slam Wrestling review that I recall wasn’t high on the match so maybe you’re not all that off except that Slam is a Canadian site and we all know Canadians love HHH and HBK. No bias there at all.

Calling HHH and HBK second rate to Race and Flair is so off and terrible I can’t even begin. I’ll just say that Flair himself, has said that HBK is better than he ever was and called HBK the greatest ever. Race has said the same about HHH. So I’ll leave it at that.

Your whole rant was based on HHH and HBK sullying the streak with their antics. If you know it is fake then act like it. My point and bottom line is that if this is Takers last match, then Taker chose HHH and nothing is going to happen in that match unless Taker approves it. So all the bluster about HHH and HBK is meaningless.

 Wade Keller is your &quot;proof&quot; of a respected journalist? No one respects that clown. 
 
You didn’t have time to go through the Observer reviews because you have nothing, dude. In any case, generally speaking people think the match is overlong and dull. For example, the general mood at Wrestling Forum and DVDVR, both places that are generally better at judging anything having to do with wrestling than Wade fucking Keller, is that the match is plodding. Here’s ONE example, though of course you’ll say that these guys aren’t as“respected”as Wade Keller. Wade effing Keller, for the love of it all: http://www.wrestlingforum.com/general-wwe/559393-hbk-vs-hhh-hell-cell.html 

HBK isn’t second rate to Race or Flair–he’s not even like those guys–so you clearly didn’t comprehend what I wrote before you got indignant and made your little post. I also don’t care what two old timers that are always working whenever they open their mouths say about how good workers are, and I appreciate that Flair and Race are passing it forward like any good wrestler who is leaving the business should do. I’ll leave it at that.

Finally, my whole opinion on this match is based on HHH and HBK taking something that is really important in the wrestling world, that has more cache than either World Title, in fact, and making it about themselves while having Taker look like his record might as well be 20-0*, thus killing any future business that they MIGHT come back to no matter what Taker is thinking about how many matches he has left right at this moment. It’s also based on the fact that HHH hasn’t delivered anything epic in the ring since about 2001.

And I know it’s fake, so act like it? Yeah, because that makes wrestling fun. Listen, your rambling might impress other people, but what you just did was reacted poorly because I let you know how overrated your hero Triple H is. Now you’re butthurt because I’m interested in seeing the one thing that the WWE has actually built up well over the years be treated well so that people will care about it.

So, I guess my point and bottom line is that the only facts I can discern from your whining is that Wade Keller is out of step with most wrestling fans on the internet (something we already knew) and you need to stop acting like someone disliking your darling HHH is unthinkable.

I can’t believe I spent so many paragraphs on an ill-thought-out post that is essentially WAAAAH U DON’T LYK HHH WAAAAAH, but there you go.

 Sigh... 
 
I’m going to ignore your sharp wit and biting sarcasm because it is unoriginal and overdone. It is clear to me that you do LOTS of posting all over the net and are a sarcasm over facts veteran. Good on you! You got you some with that post above! Did you copy and past it and mass text it to your boys? Never mind…

On to some of the unthinkably absurd statements you made…
 “You didn’t have time to go through the Observer reviews because you have nothing, dude. In any case, generally speaking people think the match is overlong and dull. For example, the general mood at Wrestling Forum and DVDVR, both places that are generally better at judging anything having to do with wrestling than Wade fucking Keller, is that the match is plodding.

So I should toss Wade Keller’s opinion aside for an open forum website known for stealing other wrestling site copy. The answer to that is no I won’t.
 HBK isn’t second rate to Race or Flair – he’s not even like those guys – so you clearly didn’t comprehend what I wrote before you got indignant and made your little post 
I’ll give you that it does appear that you are only speaking of HHH being second rate to Race and Flair. Although that is debatable.
 I also don’t care what two old timers that are always working whenever they open their mouths say about how good workers are, and I appreciate that Flair and Race are passing it forward like any good wrestler who is leaving the business should do. I’ll leave it at that. 
You respect their work enough to rate them highly but disrespect their opinions about their own comrades and coworkers? It is things like this that is wrong with the wrestling business today. When CM Punk or Arn Anderson or Ric Flair or Kurt Angle or HHH says that someone can work, then hell man they can work! It doesn’t matter one bit if you think they can or not. I’ve seen someone say that Mark Canterbury is a horrible wrestler and yet I’ve seen HHH, HBK, Jim Ross, Jim Cornette and others call him talented. I’ll confer with wrestlingforum to settle the issue.
 Finally, my whole opinion on this match is based on HHH and HBK taking something that is really important in the wrestling world, that has more cache than either World Title, in fact, and making it about themselves while having Taker look like his record might as well be 20-0*, thus killing any future business that they MIGHT come back to no matter what Taker is thinking about how many matches he has left right at this moment. It’s also based on the fact that HHH hasn’t delivered anything epic in the ring since about 2001 
This is absurd simply because no one is going to book a clusterfuck into a Taker mania match. It just is NOT gonna happen which makes your point moot and drab and pointless which is what I said many posts ago. Nothing and I repeat, nothing is going to happen in that match that Taker is not 100% cool with. HHH or HBK or Vince will not even attempt to try anything with Taker in terms of heat stealing or screwing up the streak. Most seem to believe this is Takers last go round at Mania. If that holds true then Taker is the one in the drivers seat and calling the shots.

Now onto my theoretically hurt butt. I don’t like HHH. I think he’s screwed and held down plenty of talent and has to take the blame for Batista and John Cena being the only legit main event stars made in a decade. If you ever paid attention you’d know this is no place that is in full support of HHH. That being said, to state that he sucks or he hasn’t had a great match since 2001 is beyond laughable.

If we are talking about what HHH has done for the business, then by all means kill HHH. But claiming he’s some joke, terrible wrestler that is only a second rate Ric Flair is just NOT the truth. Let me ask you this; Do you think Scott Steiner is a better in ring worker than HHH? I think I already know what you’re answer is.

 Yeah, because a &quot;journalist&quot; like Keller has an opinion far superior to anyone else who has watched a match. 
 
This is ridiculous. Look, despite your one example, most people are down on that HHH/HBK HIAC match. Get over it.
 You respect their work enough to rate them highly but disrespect their opinions about their own comrades and coworkers? It is things like this that is wrong with the wrestling business today. When CM Punk or Arn Anderson or Ric Flair or Kurt Angle or HHH says that someone can work, then hell man they can work! 
Workers are always working. ALWAYS. Flair doesn’t like Bret Hart, so Bret can’t work even when tons of other guys said he was great. Bret says Flair can’t work and is a“routine man”even though a bunch of other guys say Flair can. Savage couldn’t work either, according to Flair. Foley is a stuntman in Flair’s eyes, but Terry Funk thinks Foley is a great worker. Is Hogan a terrible worker or completely underrated? Depending on which wrestler you ask, both are true!

If you buy ANYTHING a wrestler says and swallow it right down, you are extremely naive.
 This is absurd simply because no one is going to book a clusterfuck into a Taker mania match. It just is NOT gonna happen which makes your point moot and drab and pointless which is what I said many posts ago. 
Yep, extremely naive. I’m sure that we can trust the WWE’s booking. It’s been hot for an extended period, after all, hasn’t it?

HHH or HBK or Vince will not even attempt to try anything with Taker in terms of heat stealing or screwing up the streak. Most seem to believe this is Takers last go round at Mania. If that holds true then Taker is the one in the drivers seat and calling the shots. 
Who told you this? Your buddy Wade Keller? The only thing that’s“drab”is your righteously indignant gimmick where you spew bullshit like you are the end-all and be-all of wrestling knowledge.
 Now onto my theoretically hurt butt. I don’t like HHH… 
Here we go. This is the major problem that I have with people who can’t disconnect HHH the politician from HHH the wrestler. Who gives a fuck about HHH“holding people down”in 2012? Good for him, he’s a great“worker”in the sense that he knows how to play the political game.

What I’m talking about is HHH’s work on the mic and in the ring. He is not good. He’s probably about average, maybe a bit above average if I’m generous. There is never any defense against this except“WELL WWE SAYS HE IS GOOD SO HE IS GOOD.”However, I will be glad to let you know exactly all the things HHH isn’t good at (and the few things that he is good at) if you want. Just don’t compel me to write a bunch of stuff you’re not going to read or that you’re not going to even bother considering because the WWE told you HHH is great so he is, dammit!
 Let me ask you this; Do you think Scott Steiner is a better in ring worker than HHH?&lt;/blockquote

Pre Big Bad Booty Daddy, it’s not a contest. Steiner was worlds better than HHH has ever been or hoped to be. Nowadays? I’d put them on the same level or so.

Now, I’ll say this again, if we want to talk in detail about why HHH hasn’t had a great match in ten years or why HHH sucked as a heel because his facials were terrible and he didn’t know how to stooge for his babyface opponents, we can have that conversation. You may not agree, but if you are open-minded, you can at least see that the argument has more than enough merit behind it.

On the other hand, if you’re going to play Mr. Indignant, don’t even bother with a response. I think I already know what your response will be.

 Guys like Meltzer and Keller that have watched damn near every match 
 
since the 70’s should have an idea if a match is good or not. And most people will respect that level of knowledge over someone watching matches for a few years. Call me crazy or call it stupidity like you have already, but I think that might be a factor for some.

In the past 5 years undertaker has booked his own wrestlemania storyline in concert with his opponent without the help of the office. Why all of a sudden would that change? Because of an interview with HBK on WWE.com? Ok sure thing if your logic believes that.

Now we can have any debate on HHH that you’d like and I’ll be open-minded. BTW, WWE told me as a kid that Bret Hart is the Best there is, Best there was and Best there ever will be! I don’t give a fuck that they did and I know he isn’t.

So get into HHH’s facials and stuff that makes him suck or just average.

 Dude, do you know how many people have watched hours and hours of wrestling? 
 
I’ve watched enough wrestling to put my opinion up against DA MELTZ any fucking day. Half the internet has immediate access to Japan, Mexico, the UK, fancams of ECW matches from Podunk, NY. It’s not hard to see enough wrestling to get a feel for all the different things that make a wrestler great.
 In the past 5 years undertaker has booked his own wrestlemania storyline in concert with his opponent without the help of the office. Why all of a sudden would that change? Because of an interview with HBK on WWE.com? Ok sure thing if your logic believes that. 
Who told you that? Wade Keller?

The great thing about this quote, by the way, is that HHH is the fucking office at this point.

Anyway, my point is that this fucking thing is being booked INCORRECTLY if they go down this route where they are injecting HBK into it. It’s not just the WWE.COM interview, which is part of this angle whether you like it or not. It’s the continued comparisons between HBK and HHH about who is better and all that bullshit that have happened the last two weeks in the HBK/HHH and Taker/HHH segments. If you are too stupid to get when these guys are setting up a“Who is really better between HHH and HBK”angle with Undertaker as the measuring stick, it sucks for you.

Anyway, I answered hfl who asked me what I didn’t like without being an asshole, something that you might take notice of, and I gave him a response that is as detailed as I can get without making a series of FanPosts to explain my position on this that, again, no one wants to read anyway. If you want to have this discussion and you can do so without throwing out“THERES NO WAY HHH ISNT GREAT”type talking points like the WWE has trained you to do, I welcome it because I enjoy discussing these things.

 If you know more than Meltzer and Keller then why don&apos;t you 
 
write your own shit and stop shitting on them because others respect them?

Story lines have undertones and aspects to them that give the story depth. There are many involved in this match with Taker/HHH and the question can HHH do what HBK couldn’t is an undertone to the story added to give depth. Why does it have to be more than that?

Oh but you’re right HHH is the office and I am a WWE zombie with a WWE Universe logo on my chest so perhaps my depth perception is off. It’s not your hate of one HHH that is screwing with your perception at all. You sir are smart to it.

You seem to have this idea that most people think HHH is clearly better than Scott Steiner. You are WAY out there on that opinion–well, except for amongst those who are ONLY in the WWE Universe.

Well Rick Steiner wrestled in NWA with Scott in his corner then in 89 they started teaming with Missy Hyatt as their second. Scott didn’t get a real singles push until‘91 and it was short lived because the brothers dipped to WWF and stayed there until 94. They went back to WCW and wrestled as a team until what’98 or’99. So what singles pushes and 5 star matches for Scott Steiner are you talking about in the 80’s?

I mean, Triple H and Shawn Michaels had a“Match of the Year”candidate on a Raw in Dec. 2003 that I’ll never forget. One of the best matches I’ve ever seen. They work well together. Me thinks your hatred for Triple H clouds the issue, and I can certainly understand that. My love for HBK has the opposite effect.

 They were hit and miss 
 
HHH and HBK had a decent LMS match a few years ago and their SummerSlam’02 match is pretty good, largely because of how electric the crowd is.

On the other hand, they had a bad Three Stages of Hell match and the Cell match is dire. Let’s modify this to say that they had little chemistry together, way less than I would think two guys who are that close would have.

 If not for the Kennel in the Cell and the five minute HIAC on RAW back in ’99, it would be the worst HIAC match ever. 
It’s not even in the top 10 worst HiaC matches of all time, I’d call it one of the better ones.
 I cannot care less about this match. I’ll probably be in an extreme minority, but the top four matches at WM are all shitty and I could not find a way to care less about any of them. The worst of those four matches, however, has got to be this HHH/Undertaker match. Awful, awful, awful. 
You believe this largely because your opinions are awful, I’d put more effort into critiquing this, but I’m having much more fun listening to The Basement Tapes for the hundredth time.

I just hope, as Razztopia mentioned above, that this doesn’t mean The Heartbreak Kid will save the Taker for the win. I mean, let’s be honest, it is well within reason to believe that HHH could manipulate the storyline in such a fashion that continues the feud for at least another year. I really hope that is not the case, but we will see very shortly.

 that reminds me of a (maybe fake) story 
 
apparently Ricky Steamboat was tired of being a perma-face and wanted to give a heel run a try. the promoter told him that he wouldn’t be able to turn heel if he took a chainsaw to Hulk Hogan’s legs in the middle of the ring.
Now obviously HBK is no Steamboat, but with every average WWE fan looking through rose colored glasses at his career these last few years, turning Micheals heel just would not go over with anyone very well
