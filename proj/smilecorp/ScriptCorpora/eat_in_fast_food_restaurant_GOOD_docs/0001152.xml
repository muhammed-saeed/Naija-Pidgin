When you&apos;re/they&apos;re called, get their attention right after you/they leave the seat and say, &quot;My imaginary friend thinks you have serious mental problems.&quot; Then get up for whatever reason you&apos;re there/water drink/magazine ect. (basically, find an excuse to get away from them.)

16: Blast music (iPOd, MP3 player, ect.) as loud as it can go, and at a really good part, jump up from your seat to do air guitar solo, air-drum solo, singing, ect.

15: Tap some chick on the shoulder as you&apos;re passing them, wait until they look at you, then say &quot;Ma&apos;am. I&apos;m sorry to tell you this, but you look like a constipated llama.&quot; Then walk away. (Sorry, I was gonna do something else, but then I typed that up, so the next one is what this was supposed to be.)

14: Same as 15, but instead say, &quot;Ma&apos;am, I&apos;m sorry to tell you, but me and my police force are trying to find a loose-cannon pickle serial-killer. He&apos;s a dill pickle. Have you seen away dill pickles around here?&quot; or something else with arresting some kind of food. Wait for answer, nod and say, &quot;Thank you for your time, Ma&apos;am.&quot; Then walk to your seat.

13: Act nervous, glance around every, like, 2 seconds or so, twindle your thumbs, brethe heavily, and twitch until you have everyone&apos;s/almost everyone&apos;s attention. Once you do, look around at everyone, then scream, &quot;MICHEAL JACKSON ####### RAPED ME, OKAY?!!&quot; Then run into the bathroom crying.

12: Have the following conversation with the peson sitting next to you, &quot;Hi. My name&apos;s [insert name here]. What&apos;s yours? [answer]. Oh, [insert person&apos;s name here]. That&apos;s a pretty name. My name is [your name]. That&apos;s not as pretty as your name. What IS your name, anyway? [answer]. Huh. You already told me? That&apos;s a weird name. My name isn&apos;t that weird. It&apos;s [your name]. Isn&apos;t that a nice name? What&apos;s yours?&quot; Until you/they are called. Then say, &quot;Well, it was nice chatting with you, [insert other person&apos;s name]. Though it WAS kind of boring. You kept saying your name over and over and over again. You should say more than your name. It kind of gets annoying. Oh, by the way, what&apos;s your name?&quot;

11: Pretend you&apos;re all PO&apos;ed about something. LIke, mutter under your breath, slam your fist agianst the arm rest, stomp your feet, ect. When someone asks you what&apos;s wrong, go into this 3,000 hour-long explanation about how your bf/gf broke up with you, and how much you hated them, and didn&apos;t miss them , but wished they&apos;d call, then end up balling your eyes out. When they start apologizng for making you cry, lift your head up, and be all confused, and say, &quot;What for? You don&apos;t make the world go round. Gravity does that.&quot; And go on like you never takled to them.

10: Run around in circles making growling noises and sounding very much like a dog, until someone asks you what the heck you&apos;re doing. Stare at them for a minute like they&apos;re an idiot, then say, &quot;I&apos;m chasing my tail; Why, don&apos;t you have one?&quot; Then continue running in circles.

9: Ask if you can turn the TV on, then change the channel every second after, &quot;Oohh&apos;s&quot; and &quot;Ew! I HATE that show!&quot; Then turn it up the whole way up, then put it down to, like, 10, and be annoying in that asspect.

8: Sing small kids&apos; TV show themes the whole time. Ex: Blue&apos;s Clues, Barney, Dora the Explorer, Jojo&apos;s Circus, Sp9ongeBob SquarePants, ect.

7: Bring an adult&apos;s, then read it out loud the whole time, then pretend you&apos;re having trouble pronouncing the words (ex: Co-omp-lee-kay-teed. What the hell? What kind of a word is co-omp-lee-kay-teed? I mean, it looks like complicated, but, like, what the frickin&apos; hell ???) Key word: LOUD.

6: Have your friend call you on your cell (if u have one), then have a heated convo with a sweqar word every 2 freaking seconds, and at the end, forgive&amp;forget and have a cutsey-wootsie (me: ew) convo.

5: Read a gossip magazine, then be all: &quot;No. Way. No freaking WAY!!!! Jennifer did that ??!!! Like, Oh, my, GAWD!&quot; Ect.

4: Go on a &quot;treasure hunt&quot;. Crawl around on the floor, lifting people&apos;s stuff and all, then shaking your head, and continuing on your search. If someone&apos;s asks you what you&apos;re doing, say, &quot;My life left me a ransom note. It said if I could find a brain, it would come back. But I can&apos;t buy the brain on eBay.&quot;

3: Go up to people and be all, &quot;Oh. Em. Gee. [insert celebrity&apos;s name here]? OMG, it IS you!!! You&apos;re my IDOL!!!! Will you sign [item or body part to sign]?!&quot; If they asy no or that they aren&apos;t the celebrity, start crying your eyes out.

2: Get there REEEEEAAALLLLLLLLYYYYYYY early, then be the waiting room&apos;s personal &apos;BOUNCER&apos;. Hold a notebook (empty) and don&apos;t let anyone in, cause they &quot;aren&apos;t on the list&quot;.

1: Act like some insane character like a movie (Ex: Golem from Lord Of The Rings) and act like them the whole time. If someone guesses who you are, swich to a different crazy character from a different movie (ex: Lucy from the Epic Movie). :)
