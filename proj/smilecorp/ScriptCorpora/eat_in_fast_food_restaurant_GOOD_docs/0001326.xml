 2 Hailstone Sequences [12 marks] A hailstone sequence is a sequence of integers found by applying the following rule: Hailstone Iteration: For an integer n in a hailstone sequence, the next item in the sequence is 3n + 1 if n is odd, or n / 2 if n is even. For example, the hailstone sequence starting at 6 is 6 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1. The sequence ends when 1 is reached. The name&quot;hailstone sequence&quot;stems from the way the values in the sequence go up and down, as a hailstone does in the clouds before it falls to earth. Collatz (1937) conjectured that for any starting... invests $200 each quarter in a fixed-interest mutual fund paying annual interest of 6% compounded quarterly. How much will her account have in it at the end of 11 years? Draw a segment TR 25mm long. construct SV congruent to TR Consider the same galvanic cell at 25 C. Pt | Cr2+ (0.44 M), Cr3+ (1.5 M) || Co2+ (0.35 M) | Co Calculate the cell potential after the reaction has operated long enough for the [Cr2+] to have changed by 0.30 M. Consider transferring an enormous file of L bytes from Host A to Host B. Assume an MSS of 536 bytes. A. What is the maximum value of L such that TCP sequence numbers are not exhausted? Recall that the TCP sequence number field has 4 bytes. B. For the L you obtain in (a), find how long it takes to transmit the file. Assume that a total of 66 bytes of transport, network and data-link header are added to each segment before the resulting packet is sent out over a 155 Mbps link. Ignore flow control and congestion control so A can pump out the segments back to back and continuously. A 0.50 kg ball that is tied to the end of a 1.3 m light cord is revolved in a horizontal plane with the cord making a 30 angle, with the vertical (See Fig. P7.52.)

 The boom OA carries a load P and is supported by two cables as shown. Knowing that the tension is 510 N in cable AB and 765 N in cable AC, determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant of the forces exerted at A by the two cables. H2 + Cl2 = 2HCl. Describe the energy change as bonds are formed and broken into this reaction. We need to analyze how Palm, Inc., has been doing in terms of its performance, how it stacks up against its goals. And we need to do this at at three levels: the overall org level, the groups level, and the individual level. The Congruence Model really explains this very well. If you are not up to speed on this model by now, you need to get there. The execs want to know how congruent the outputs across the three levels. So given your analysis of performance at each of the three levels, are the interactions of these outputs congruent - highly, somewhat, or ver little? I need you to make this determination and support it with a... The boom OA carries a load P and is supported by two cables as shown.
