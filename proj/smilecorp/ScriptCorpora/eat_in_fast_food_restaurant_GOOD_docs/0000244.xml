 Plus...where do they get off charging more for a salad than a sandwich? They know people are trying to eat healthier so they rack up the price of the cheapest thing on the menu. Shame on all the food chains for doing the same thing.

 I used to think Subway was such a good choice, but I gave up deli meats back in February. It may be real meat, but the chemicals they put into it to hold it together and preserve it don&apos;t make it healthy. I cook chicken or turkey myself now and make my own sandwiches.

 Everytime I eat Subway I feel sick for two or three days afterwards. Regardless of what the nutritional values are, that shouts at me that there&apos;s some ingredient in there that humans aren&apos;t supposed to ingest.

If I ever eat Subway again, it will be too soon.

 Now this looks like something I would be willing to work into my daily numbers. Since I eat my sandwiches dry, I don&apos;t have the empty calories of the sauces and I also have them load up on ALL the veggies on my turkey sandwich.

 My hubby and I LOVE Subway. I actually worked at Subway for 2 years and I lost tons of weight (even eating Subway everyday I never got sick of them.) I love that they have apples, yogurt etc. I am shocked that someone said their veggies were on the brink of rot. Not at the Subway I used to work at... 0_o even we employees took pride in the fact our veggies where fresh. If anything was off we wouldn&apos;t sell it.

If you want to cut sodium cut things like pickles, olives etc. I always get the roast chicken or the veggie which has under 700mg of sodium. I have that and plenty of water plus some apples and the gym. Sharing a house with other + going to the gym often means hubby and I wouldn&apos;t eat until after 10pm if we didn&apos;t do Subway sometimes. I really think it has made me be able to make healthier choices. We eat a lot less sodium most of the week. I love Mrs Dash :P

 The only &quot;fast food&quot; restaurant in my town is Subway. We have a Dunkin Donuts too, but I don&apos;t really eat their food. My favorite sandwich at Subway is one I made up (I&apos;m sure the calorie count isn&apos;t as low as the ones listed here). I call it the cordon bleu: Ham, Chicken and Swiss Cheese with Lettuce&amp;Black Olives&amp;Honey Mustard. I think next time I go I&apos;ll try the salad option instead. Cutting out the bread will cut back on many carbs and calories.

 I get a veggie wrap all the veggies and ask for lots of spinach - no dressing - you will be surprised how much you don&apos;t need it - I get some olives and the tomatoes and so forth make it not dry. The sodium in all fast food is very hard on me and yet it IS possible to make do if you really must.

 I love Subway. The one thing I do to cut back a little on the sodium and carbs on the subs is to either only eat 1/2 of the bun or pull out the inside of the bread (kind of scoop it out like a bowl). This cuts back on some of the calories, sodium and carbs. I really like their salads with double chicken breast. Don&apos;t even need the dressing if you add pickles.

 I&apos;d like to see the counts on all of their subs since I rarely get just a single meat. The tuna is my favorite and I expect its loaded with fat. The salt levels appear to be high, but since I sweat sooooooooo much, they don&apos;t taste salty to me. Thanks for the info!

 Subway is great for me personally. I only eat the veggie delight because of the high sodium in the meats they use. Heres a tip. When I order I get wheat bread and to save on calories and carbs I will ask that they skip the cheese and scoop out the bread in the middle, then I will ask that they just stuff it with as many veggies as will fit. For my dressing mustard or honey mustard will do the trick. it gives the sandwich a good flavor. If I have to eat out this is my go to place and meal. The veggie delight is good for you, helps you meet the veggie requirement for the day, not to many calories and is definitely a diet friendly healthy alternative to a burger or other fast food.

 I used to eat at Subway until I found out that their bread contains high fructose corn syrup and really isn&apos;t whole wheat. Their meat and cheese contain lots of additives as well as all of their condiments. Yes, they may be lower in calories than some places and if you don&apos;t have the option of eating fresh food at home, then go for it. Just don&apos;t make it a regular habit.

 If I have to eat fast food, Subway 9 grain wheat with veggies - including spinach and no other things except veggies....vinager if they have it, is great! I think the meat is very high sodium....and I&apos;m a vegetarian anyway. If I want I can have olives...but they do increase sodium. I leave out the cheese - the veggies fill me up and since I don&apos;t normally eat bread I&apos;m already cheating. donna

 I have to agree with the minority that does not choose Subway has a healthy option, unfortunately. The bread can be squashed down to the size of a fist and is so full of sugar. No way can that fill me up. I lived on veggie delite for so long before I realized I was still starving afterwards. Nope. Not for me.

 I hate Subway. All of the healthy option sandwiches are just disgusting. I used to love Subway until I realized how low quality it is. Their meat just comes out of a package and the veggies are all on the brink of rot. And really, it isn&apos;t that great on calories...even when you get it with light mayo and no cheese. Two words: HEALTH HALO.
