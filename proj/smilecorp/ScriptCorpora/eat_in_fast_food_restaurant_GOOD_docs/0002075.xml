13 Reviews El Zarape Mexican Restaurant 
 1700 Live Oak Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;My husband is a Marine stationed at Cherry Point, NC. We frequently eat here, and love it! The prices are reasonable for the beach, and the food is delicious!...&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
7 Reviews Finz Grill&amp;Bar 
 330 Front Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;I live 6 hours away and have made it a tradition every year. If I could only drive down, eat, head back home I&apos;d be happy....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
6 Reviews The Dock House Restaurant&amp;Bar 
 500 Front Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;A down-home bar/eatery with the best location (waterfront) and people-watching in Beaufort, it is always on our list of places to go while visiting Eastern NC.
Staff are very pleasant, and the kitchen puts out some yummy but not fancyschmancy meals and snacks. Usually a good band on the dockside deck in the evenings. We saw local favs Infectious Blues Blues and the whole waterfront was jumping. The Dockhouse IS Beaufort....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
4 Reviews Roland&apos;s Barbecue 
 1507 Live Oak Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;We love Rolands. My favorite are the ribs in the vinegar sauce....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
4 Reviews Ribeyes Steakhouse 
 509 Front Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;Ribeyes is the name of the restaurant so what else would you think that they would serve there?I think that they have the best steaks around here. They are better than anyone else could ever offer. Also the salad bar is really great! What more choices could you ask for? If you have a child maybe you should take them to a fast food restaurant or somewhere like that instead of a nice restaurant like Ribeyes? Why take a 10 year old child to a restaurant like that anyways when you know that they wou...&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
3 Reviews Dairy Queen 
 201 Campen Road, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;The building is gone to make way for a lux resort w/ prices starting at½a million. This area is starting to look like Mytle Beach!...&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
3 Reviews The Sandbar Restaurant&amp;Tiki Bar 
 232 W Beaufort Road, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;Made reservations for party of 16 for birthday celebration. Called to let them know we&apos;d be 10 minutes late. They failed to mention that AC was not working, in August. While we were there we were told that AC was being worked on and should be on soon. BIG lie. It was so hot that one member of our party became ill. Manager did not care and was very rude. The second time I tried this place the bartender didn&apos;t know the difference between a mango margartia and a melon martini. Not sure my food wasn...&apos;&apos;

 437 Front Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
 
 
3 Reviews Blue Moon Bistro 
 119 Queen Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;The food here is the best in Beaufort. You do need a reservation during the busy season, but that&apos;s the case anywhere in Beaufort....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
3 Reviews The Spouter Inn Restaurant 
 218 Front Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;We have been visiting a few times a year for a few years now and it has always been just great. We always eat inside. big crowd or small.

2 Reviews Aqua Restaurant 
 114 Middle Lane, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;We come to the coast for a week every March and usually have our favorite places that we eat at. This year we decided to try new places and came across Aqua. So glad we did. The food was fabulous. The service was great and everyone was so friendly. I highly recommend that you try this place when in Beaufort....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
2 Reviews Cubbie&apos;s 
 1507 Live Oak Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;I&apos;ve been to the one in Morehead City, and the food is not bad, but the prices are too high for what you get. The French fries are not even included in your meal - you have to pay for everything separately. The portion sizes are very small....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
2 Reviews The Fudge Factory 
 400 Front Street, Beaufort, NC 28557
 
&apos;&apos;We live in the area! This is a wonderful place. If you visit at just the right time, the kids (or you!) can watch the staff make HOMEMADE fudge! It is very neat. They offer a variety of flavors. My favorite is the Chocolate Peanut Butter. Go visit!...&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
2 Reviews The Net House Restaurant&amp;Oyster Bar

2 Reviews Royal James Cafe

&apos;&apos;Best burgers in Beaufort, excellant clam chowder and steamed shrimp, old and classic atmosphere. Best bang for the buck. Take the family and leave with money in your pocket....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
2 Reviews Front Street Grill at Stillwater 
 300 Front Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;If you came to Beaufort looking for a great restaurant on the water, this is the place. The food is fantastic and the view is even better.

The owners are less than friendly, but it&apos;s still a wonderful place for dinner....&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
2 Reviews Beaufort Grocery Co. 
 117 Queen Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;Beaufort has some great restaurants these days but Beaufort Grocery was the original &apos;&apos;nice&apos;&apos; restaurant in town. Creative menu, great food!...&apos;&apos;
 
 
 
1 Review Cool Fish Bar&amp;Grill 
 1644 Live Oak Street, Beaufort, NC 28516
 
&apos;&apos;My husband and I are residents of Carteret County, and it is actually difficult to get good seafood on the coast these days. We were thrilled when we tried Cool Fish. The restaurant is reminescent of the oyster bars of yesterday, but the menu (and the food) is definitely modern fare. The seafood is fresh (Cool Fish is owned by Roses Seafood next door), the wait staff (mostly family) are well-mannered and upbeat. Weekends boast karaoke and bands. Please don&apos;t come to the Crystal Coast without try...&apos;&apos;

&apos;&apos;My girlfriend and I ate at Sharpies on Saturday March 18 2006 and I would like to say to the owners and the chef that the Crabcakes were awesome!!!!!
The ambiance of the place was wonderful and we met some awesome people especially Al. We will definitely be going back as we are from Hampstead NC....&apos;&apos;
