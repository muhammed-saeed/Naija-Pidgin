AUGUSTA, Maine—A real-life Hamburglar has struck at a Maine McDonald&apos;s.

Police say a young man, seemingly inspired by the pattie purloining character once featured in McDonald&apos;s advertising campaigns, ran between a car and the takeout window at the Augusta restaurant Sunday night as an employee handed a bag of food to a driver.

A witness flagged down an officer leaving a nearby convenience store.

Lt. Christopher Massey, acting on a description of the hungry thief, found him in the parking lot of a rival fast food restaurant diving into a McDonald&apos;s bag.

Massey tells the Kennebec Journal () the suspect swore and ran into the woods. He was never caught. http://bit.ly/GQzgak 

Massey says the three young men who had their food stolen didn&apos;t know the burger thief.

McDonald&apos;s replaced the stolen food, worth about $20.
