Davy Crockett &apos;Truck Stop&apos; Has New Name, Facilities

What formerly was the Davy Crockett Travel Center in Baileyton is now Davy Crockett TA Greeneville. The expanded and remodeled business has become a part of Travel Centers of America (TA), as shown above.
 Originally published: Last modified: 2009-04-01 12:10:13   


 Tuesday, June 26, marked a new beginning for an old &quot;truck stop&quot; in Baileyton that now is named Davy Crockett TA Greeneville.

Business owners Richard and Jason Brandon held a ribbon as Jason&apos;s wife, Susan, ceremonially cut it, opening the renovated facility.

For 31 years, the &quot;truck stop&quot; off Interstate 81 on exit 36 operated as Davy Crockett Travel Center and Restaurant and was owned by Carl Brandon.

Last year, Carl Brandon retired and sold the travel center to his sons, Richard and Jason.
With the new owners came a new look. Crockett Enterprises, the Brandon brothers&apos; company, is now a part of Travel Centers of America (TA), the largest chain of travel centers in America. The truck stop was upgraded to meet TA&apos;s specifications.

The entire travel store to the right of the restaurant has been renovated and has added a new 12-door walk-in cooler and a new game room.

Dave Raco, director of franchising for TA, said that surveys show a high priority for most people are clean, attractive restrooms.
Therefore, he said, one of the most important projects was remodeling the restrooms, which are modeled after the restrooms in quality hotels.

The Travel Center&apos;s showers for truck drivers will be the next to be remodeled, Jason Brandon said.

Restaurant Changes

The restaurant also went through some changes. It is now called Country Pride Restaurant and has a new menu with a few items added.

Plans are to update the restaurant by adding more seating and possibly adding a fast food restaurant in later years.

Joanne Lamb, the center&apos;s assistant general manager, is requesting a Popeyes Chicken&amp;Biscuits restaurant to be added.

The front of the Travel Center has been completely changed to incorporate the TA logo with a giant arch over the front door.

The four gasoline pumps have been given a facelift, and the eight diesel pumps have been upgraded with satellite fueling, which gives a person the ability to fill each fuel tank on both sides of a truck at the same time.

Truck Service Center

The biggest addition is the new Truck Service Center. Crockett Enterprises Inc. used to rent out the old repair shop to mechanics who were separate from the travel center, but now the repair shop is a part of the Travel Centers of America enterprises.

Truck drivers can get warranties when they get repairs on their trucks. If the truck breaks down in Wisconsin, then the truck does not have to come back to Tennessee. The driver just finds a nearby TA center for repairs.

Upgrading is still being done on the repair shop.

Davy Crockett TA Greeneville has added 20 employees since last fall, bringing the total from 48 to almost 70 personnel.

The travel center is open 24 hours, seven days a week. At least 20 employees are working there at all times, including after midnight.

To finance the project, the center received a $4.045 million loan from the Bank of Greeneville, now known as American Patriot Bank.

The loan is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development.
Jason Brandon said he and his brother plan on doing many more renovations to the Travel Center in the next few years to make the place a safe and friendly environment for everyone, both travelers and local residents.   For more information and stories, see The Greeneville Sun .
