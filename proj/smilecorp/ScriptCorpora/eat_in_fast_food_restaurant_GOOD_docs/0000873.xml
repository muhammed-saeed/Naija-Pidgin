The food at a Chinese restaurant can be tempting, delicious and, if you look at it right, healthy. You don&apos;t have to skip a trip to a Chinese restaurant just because you are on a diet.

When you are ordering Chinese food , either for take-out or at a restaurant, remember these healthy tips:

1. Request brown rice or steamed white rice with your meal.

White rice has the bran removed while brown rice still has it intact. A cup of brown rice has 3.5 grams of healthy fiber and white rice has less than 1 gram. Never get fried rice which has 14 grams of fat in an 8-ounce serving. Most restaurants will offer both white and brown rice.
 
2. Reduce the amount of meat in your Chinese food meal or order a vegetarian meal.

Red meat, pork, and chicken contain cholesterol and saturated fat. In small doses meat is a healthy food but it should never be overdone. A serving size is 2 to 3 ounces but often a meal of Chinese food includes a lot more.

3. Portion control from the beginning

Chinese food is often served in large portions which can lead to unhealthy overeating. Put a healthy diet-size portion of your meal on your plate and ask for a to-go box when the food is served. Put away the food that you don&apos;t need to eat and get it out of your sight.

4. Stick to Cantonese cuisine if possible

Cantonese cuisine, such as stir fried vegetables, steamed shrimp, and wonton soup, tends to be lighter, healthier and made with fresher ingredients than other Chinese foods.

5. When eating a Chinese meal, cut down on sodium elsewhere

Chinese food typically has high sodium content. On the day you eat Chinese food cut out soda and any other source of sodium that day. People need 250 to 500 mg of sodium a day. One serving of fried rice has 710 mg.

Making healthy decisions at a Chinese food restaurant can save fat, calories, and stomachaches! So now that you know the healthy Chinese food tips, here are meals you can still order if you are on a low-calorie or low-fat diet. Many of the following items also have vegetables that offer important vitamins. Below are healthy Chinese food meals and their nutritional information:

Steamed Rice 380 calories, 2.5 grams of fat per 8 oz. serving
Vegetable Spring Roll 80 calories, 3.5 grams of fat per 1.7 oz. serving
Garlic Shrimp 150 calories, 5 grams of fat per 5.5 oz. serving
Mushroom Chicken 130 calories, 6 grams of fat per 5.5 oz. serving
Broccoli and Beef 150 calories, 7 grams of fat per 5.5 oz. serving
Chicken and Green Beams 160 calories, 8 grams of fat per 5.5 oz. serving
Mandarin Chicken 250 calories, 10 grams of fat per 5.5 oz. serving

Enjoy your healthy Chinese food!
