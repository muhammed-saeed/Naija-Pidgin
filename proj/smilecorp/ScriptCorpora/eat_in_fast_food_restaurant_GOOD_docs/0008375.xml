 The Desert - Special Zones 

 
 Article Index The Desert Map Markers Special Zones Expeditions All Pages 
 Page 3 of 4 
Sometimes you will come upon a Special Zone. These zones are usually guarded by more zombies than usual and are displayed . You can visit the zone only once. Your regular search is not affected by visiting the special zones and you can visit it even if the zone is controlled by zombies. Sometimes these zones will be covered in 4 to 20 and you have to use AP (1AP removes 1 ) or (1 removes 2 or 3 and doesn&apos;t require AP) to clean it. You won&apos;t know what is hidden until you clear the zone.

The list is not quite accurate, so if you have more info about what you can find searching the Special zones, please, e-mail me.
