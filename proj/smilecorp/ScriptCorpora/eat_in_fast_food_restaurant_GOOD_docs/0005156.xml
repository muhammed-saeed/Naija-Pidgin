 Santa Ana Police Dog Bites Robbery Suspect 
 | Share 
Santa Ana, Orange County - A Santa Ana Police dog chased down and caught a man who allegedly robbed a woman of her bicycle.

Leopoldo Mondragon, 25, who police suspect is a gang member, was arrested for robbery after he ran from officers, and the suspect was taken to the hospital for dog bites, according to the Santa Ana Police Department.

Police were called a little before 8 p.m. Thursday by a woman who said she was robbed while she was walking her bicycle along First Street near Flower Street, according to Santa Ana Police.

Santa Ana Police say there was a struggle between the victim and suspect, and then at one point the suspect lifted his shirt and displayed his handgun , which afterwards the woman gave her bike over.

 Theft crimes are taken seriously, but out of all those crimes robbery gets special attention, because robbery is a crime involves direct contact with the victim, and often the contact is done in a fearful matter using a weapon, explains Santa Ana criminal attorney Michael L. Guisti.

Adding on to the special attention robbery receives is that the crime of robbery is always charged as a felony, as oppose to other theft crimes like shoplifting or burglary, which are &quot;wobblers&quot; and can be charged either as a misdemeanor or felony , says Guisti.

The suspect in this Santa Ana robbery case is also going to likely face firearm charges , says Guisti.

Now simply possessing a firearm that isn&apos;t properly licensed and registered to you is a felony and can result up to three years in prison, stresses Guisti.

Possessing an assault weapon is a felony and can result in several years in prison, says Guisti.

Now had the suspect used the firearm on the victim the suspect could have faced assault with a deadly weapon charge, but if the suspect used the gun itself to hit the suspect on the head, for example, then the suspect would still face assault with a deadly weapons charge, explains Guisti.

Depending what was said during the incident if the suspect threatened the victim or to harm her he could face criminal threat charges, explains Guisti.

It&apos;s important to point out and show how if you intended to commit just one criminal act it can, often unknown to the suspect, result in several criminal charges, says Guisti.

Most of the time the district attorney will attempt to charge you with the various crimes, but a good criminal defense attorney will work to quickly dismiss these charges, says Guisti.

If you&apos;ve been arrested for robbery it&apos;s very important to contact the Orange County theft crimes attorney experts at the Law Offices of Michael L. Guisti right away.

 Anaheim Couple Pleads Guilty to Robbery and Credit Card Fraud 
 | Share 
Westminster, Orange County - An Anaheim couple accused of snatching a woman&apos;s purse from her 7-year-old son in front of the Stanton Post Office were each sentenced to two years in state prison Tuesday at the West Justice Center in Westminster.

Jose Guillermo Bermudez, 30, and Christina Amber Bailey, 21, both pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery and a misdemeanor count of credit card fraud .

According to the Orange County Sheriff&apos;s Department Bermudez took the purse from the 7-year-old boy while his mother was returning to the car, which Bermudez threw the purse to Bailey, who was waiting in a nearby car, and Bermudez got into the car and both took off.

It&apos;s important to understand that unlike other theft crimes robbery is always charged as a felony , and what makes the difference in the prison sentence is if it was first or second-degree robbery, says Westminster criminal attorney Michael L. Guisti.

Many people think and believe robbery is the same as shoplifting and other theft crimes , but, Guisti stresses, robbery is when you take property that didn&apos;t belong to you from that owner&apos;s personal possession or immediate presence against that person&apos;s will using some kind of force or threat.

Since robbery involves direct contact with somebody it&apos;s taken a little more seriously, says Guisti.

The main difference between first-degree robbery and second-degree robbery is, first-degree robbery involves robbing people at their homes, robbing a store or bank,, robbing people who just used an ATM, and robbing a Brinks &quot;money trucks,&quot; and second-degree robbery is typically mugging, which is basically what happened in this case in Stanton, explains Guisti.

Now credit card fraud isn&apos;t a crime in and of itself, but it&apos;s covered under California&apos;s theft crime laws, says Guisti.

So if you used the credit card and the total came to $950 or less you would be charged with petty theft , but if the credit card charges totaled over $950 you would be charged with grand theft , explains Guisti.

Sometimes in credit card fraud cases you can be charged with forgery if you signed a credit card receipt using the person&apos;s name, stresses Guisti.

A lot of people dismiss charges of forgery as nothing serious, but if convicted of felony forgery you could get up to three years in a state prison, Guisti explains.

If you&apos;ve been arrested for robbery, burglary, shoplifting, forgery, or any theft crime it&apos;s very important to contact our Orange County theft crime attorney experts at the Law Offices of Michael L. Guisti right away.

 Four Arrested After Breaking into Santa Ana Medical Marijuana Dispensary 
 | Share 
Santa Ana, Orange County - One man and three teenagers have been arrested after allegedly trying to break into a medical marijuana dispensary in Santa Ana early Wednesday morning after being spotted by an Orange County Sheriffs&apos; helicopter.

Santa Ana Police responded to a report of a burglary in progress after the business owner saw the suspects allegedly take marijuana on a live video security feed, according to police.

The Sheriffs&apos; helicopter was nearby and when they flew over the scene their &quot;night-vision&quot; saw four suspects climbing out of the roof of the business, and one of the teenage suspects became stuck and had to be freed by Santa Ana officers, according to investigators.

The suspects were arrested for burglary and may face possible drug charges .

Meanwhile media reports say the medical marijuana dispensary allegedly doesn&apos;t have up-to-date permits and the owner could face possible charges.

This is an interesting case in many ways, because if the suspects had marijuana on their person at the time of the arrest the district attorney could make an argument for marijuana drug charges, says Santa Ana drug crimes attorney Michael L. Guisti.

First off there is the crime of burglary, and in this case it would be second-degree burglary, which is commercial burglary, and burglary is the intent to commit a felony or petty theft once inside the building, explains Guisti.

How much marijuana and other items the suspects allegedly took from the store will determine if they&apos;ll be charged with petty theft or grand theft , says Guisti.

In California the threshold between petty theft and grand theft is $950.

What is going to be interesting to watch, says Guisti, is if the DA decides to charge the suspects with various marijuana drug charges .

Possible charges the four suspects could face are, marijuana possession for personal use , sale or transportation of marijuana , and possible drug paraphernalia charges, says Guisti.

What the suspects tell investigators could invite the more serious drug sales charge , says Guisti.

As for the business owner being in possible trouble they&apos;re a variety of possible charges the owner could face, explains Guisti, which could simply be a fine for having an expired permit, to major drug charges, and possibly even federal marijuana charges .

In a situation where a business permit expires, which is something a lot of businesses face, in a typical case it would be mostly a fine and/or closure until the permit is up-to-date, but since marijuana laws are still hazy the city attorney, district attorney or even federal government could take this opportunity to seize property and file various drug charges, says Guisti.

If you&apos;ve been arrested for a theft crime, drug crime, or your medical marijuana dispensary is facing problems with the federal government, it&apos;s very important to contact our expert Orange County theft crimes attorney , Orange County drug crimes attorney , or our Orange County medical marijuana attorney at the Law Offices of Michael L.

 Man Allegedly Steals TV from Orange Best Buy 
 | Share 
City of Orange, Orange County - A man who was apparently with a company to help renovate a Best Buy store is wanted in connection with a theft crime after allegedly taking a large television during the overnight renovation.

Police say an outside renovation company was brought in to help redesign elements of the store last month, and during the overnight job the suspect allegedly took a large television for his own keeping.

It will be interesting to to see how the District Attorney files this one, explains Santa Ana criminal attorney Michael L. Guisti.

Was this theft crime basically an impulse shoplifting matter, or if it was planned the suspect could be charged with burglary , says Guisti.

There hasn&apos;t been any report of how much this television costs, and that will be very important in figuring out just what kind of charges the suspect will be facing, says Guisti.

It&apos;s very important to understand it&apos;s the cost of an item, or items, that determines if you&apos;ll face petty theft or grand theft charges, explains Guisti.

In California the threshold between petty and grand theft is $950, and a new, large television can easily be worth over $1,000, and as such you would face grand theft charges, says Guisti.

It&apos;s important to point out, Guisti goes on to say, in other cases if you allegedly shoplifted thousands of items, but the value only comes to, say $400, you&apos;ll only face petty theft charges.

The point being, says Guisti, it never matters how much or how little you allegedly shoplifted, only how much those items cost to determine the seriousness of the charge.

A lot of the time police like to tag on burglary charges to shoplifting cases, but that can be difficult to prove, because if you acted on impulse to shoplift once inside the store that isn&apos;t burglary, explains Guisti.

It&apos;s only considered to be a burglary crime if you thought about shoplifting before entering the store, says Guisti.

In this case the question is, was it burglary and did the suspect &quot;think&quot; about doing this before entering the store, well, says Guisti, this is where a good defense attorney can come in and work to get their defendent the best possible deal and outcome.

If you&apos;ve been arrested for a theft crime it&apos;s very important to contact our Orange County theft crime attorney experts at the Law Offices of Michael L. Guisti right away.

 Police Search for Anaheim Home Invasion Robbery Suspect 
 | Share 
Anaheim, Orange County - Authorities are searching for a man wanting for a home-invasion robbery Thursday morning in Anaheim.

The Orange County Sheriff&apos;s Department says the homeowner confronted a man who was attempted to steal birds from the homeowner&apos;s backyard, and that is when the suspect pulled out a firearm and invaded the man&apos;s home.

At one point the suspect put the gun to the man&apos;s head and the man pleaded for his life, at which point the suspect took a computer and cell phone, along with the family&apos;s dog, according to the sheriffs&apos;.

They&apos;re a lot of serious charges here and the suspect could face up to several years in prison, says Santa Ana criminal attorney Michael L. Guisti.

The suspect will likely face charges of burglary , robbery, firearms charges , assault with a deadly weapon and assault , explains Guisti.

Many people think burglary and robbery are of the same charge and same crime, but they&apos;re very different crimes with different punishments, and should you ever find yourself involved in a theft crime it&apos;s important to know the difference, explains Guisti.

Now robbery under California law, according to Guisti, is when you take property that didn&apos;t belong to you from the owner&apos;s personal possession or immediate presence against that person&apos;s will using some kind of force or threat. Basically, robbery involves taking something directly from a person.

Now burglary is when you enter a structure with the intent to commit a felony or petty theft once inside, says Guisti.

When a person enters another&apos;s person&apos;s home to rob them it&apos;s burglary since there was the intent to commit theft and/or other crime, according to Guisti.

Now since a suspect illegally entered a residence it&apos;s assumed that he/she is going to commit a felony, but, Guisti goes on to say, in shoplifting cases police tend to add on the charge of commercial burglary, but it&apos;s not always clear-cut if the suspect intended on committing the crime before entering the store.

Many shoplifting cases are on impulse, meaning a suspect enters a store with no intention of shoplifting, but perhaps an opportunity presents itself and the suspect acts on it, but gets caught, explains Guisti.

Now, Guisti goes on to say, police may ask if the suspect thought about doing this before coming to the store today, and the suspect, unaware of these laws, may just answer &quot;yes&quot; even though he/she had no intent to shoplift before entering the store, but by answering &quot;yes&quot; the suspect now invites robbery charges.

If you&apos;ve been involved in a theft crime it&apos;s important to contact our Orange County theft crimes attorney experts at the Law Offices of Michael L. Guisti who can see to it you&apos;re not overcharged.

 Seal Beach Home-Invasion Robbery Suspect Arrested 
 | Share 
Seal Beach, Orange County - A suspect has been arrested in a home-invasion robbery of a 90-year-old woman in Seal Beach, according to the Orange County Sheriff&apos;s Department.

On Wednesday morning the elderly woman walked out of her home to get her newspaper, and that is when two men confronted the woman with one of them holding a handgun against the woman&apos;s neck, according to sheriffs&apos;.

The woman was tied to a chair and her head was covered with a towel while the men searched the home for valuables, according to sheriff investigators.

Anytime there is a home robbery it is always charged as a felony first-degree robbery , says Westminster criminal attorney Michael L. Guisti.

The crime of robbery, explains Guisti, is taking property that didn&apos;t belong to you from that owner&apos;s personal possession or immediate presence against that person&apos;s will using some kind of force or threat.

First degree robbery is when a suspects robs a bank, robs a house, robs somebody using an ATM or robs a business, and second-degree robbery is basically something like mugging, according to Guisti.

A conviction of first-degree robbery that was done with another suspect carries a sentence between three-to-nine years in a state prison.

The suspect also faces the serious charge of burglary and, according to Guisti, will likely face the felony charge of first-degree burglary.

Burglary, says Guisti, is when a suspect planned to commit a felony or petty theft before entering a store or house.

First-degree burglary is always charged as a felony , says Guisti.

Second-degree burglary is typical found in shoplifting cases and other commercial burglary cases, but, explains Guisti, unlike first-degree burglary there is a very good defense on whether or not you really thought about committing a crime before going inside the commercial building, or if you just took advantage of what you thought was a perfect opportunity to stuff an item in your pants.

If the suspects are convicted of first-degree burglary they could face between two-to-six years in prison, according to Guisti.

Burglary and robbery are very serious crimes with severe punishments if convicted, and that is why if you or somebody you know are facing these charges you need to call the Orange County theft crimes attorney experts at the Law Offices of Michael L. Guisti at 888-478-8999.

 Two Men Allegedly Steal an ATM from Anaheim Wienerschnitzel 
 | Share 
Anaheim, Orange County - Anaheim Police are looking for two men wanted for burglary in connection with an ATM heist at a Wienerschnitzel last week.

The two suspects broke into the fast food restaurant past 2 a.m. breaking open and going through the drive-thru window and once inside that is when the suspects allegedly used a pallet jack to take the ATM, which contained thousands of dollars, according to Anaheim Police.

During the burglary the suspects apparently tried to cover the surveillance cameras with napkins, but one of the napkins fell off and the security camera was able to fully capture one of the suspect&apos;s faces as he attempted to put the napkin back on, and the suspects left behind the pallet jack, according to detectives.

 Fullerton criminal attorney Michael L. Guisti explains that the crime of burglary is when you plan to commit a theft crime before entering a home or business. In a lot of shoplifting cases it&apos;s not always clear if the intent to commit a burglary was there as many shoplifters commit the act on impulse once inside the store, but in this case it&apos;s appears the suspects allegedly broke into a business, which would invite the burglary charge, says Guisti.

The next charge the suspects will face for likely be grand theft charges, says Guisti, since police claim there was thousands of dollars in the ATM.

The line between petty theft and grand theft is $950 and grand theft invites more serious charges, says Guisti.

In burglary cases what your intent was makes all the difference in whether or not you&apos;ll face burglary charges, and the way the district attorney typical views these cases is your intent is generally made clear if you&apos;re caught with a crow bar, screwdriver and other items associated as being burglary tools, in which case you can also be charged with misdemeanor &quot;burglary tools,&quot; says Guisti

Residential burglary is typically first-degree-burglary and is always charged as a felony while most commercial burglary is considered second-degree-burglary and can be charged either as a felony or misdemeanor , according to Guisti.

These are serious charges that can result in many years in a state prison, and this is why it&apos;s very important to contact the Orange County theft crimes attorney experts at the Law Offices of Michael L. Guisti at 888-478-8999.

Even though law enforcement may say what you&apos;re doing is clear-cut understand it&apos;s not clear-cut and you have many burglary defense options, and some of which can include having charges reduced or dismissed.

Our track record shows we have successfully defended our clients against charges of burglary in the courts of Orange County, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego.

 Suspect Arrested Following Irvine Marketplace Robbery 
 | Share 
Irvine, Orange County - A suspect was arrested Thursday afternoon after allegedly robbing a phone store in Irvine.

Police say the suspect entered the T-Mobile store at the Irvine Marketplace threatening he had a weapon and took an unknown number of items.

Police spotted the suspect car a short time later on the freeway and followed it for a short time before pulling over the car and arresting the suspect on robbery charges.

 Irvine criminal attorney Michael L. Guisti explains that many people understandably think that robbery, shoplifting and burglary are one of the same charges, but they&apos;re vastly different charges with very different punishments if convicted.

The crime of robbery, Guisti explains, is taking property that didn&apos;t belong to you from that owner&apos;s personal possession or immediate presence against that person&apos;s will using some kind of force or threat.

In this case claiming you had a weapon and taking items from a store would meet those requirements, says Guisti.

The difference between robbery and the crime of shoplifting is shoplifting you&apos;re not taking the possessions of another using force or fear, and had this suspect in Irvine gone into the T-Mobile store and stuffed items onto his person and walked out the door he would&apos;ve face only shoplifting charges and not the more serious robbery charge, according to Guisti.

What does matter to both a robbery and shoplifting suspect are the value of the items allegedly taken, because if the value of the items are under $950 a shoplifting or robbery suspect will face addition charges of petty theft , and if the value was $950 or more the suspect will face an additional charge of grand theft, according to Guisti.

Now burglary charges, Guisti goes on to say, is basically when you planned to commit a theft crime or felony before entering the store, so it&apos;s very likely the Irvine robbery suspect will face this charge of burglary.

A lot of times shoplifting suspects well be charged with burglary, because many times police will seemingly ask a passing question like, &quot;did it cross your mind to do this before going into the store?,&quot; and many times a suspect will say &quot;yes,&quot; which is then enough to suffice a burglary charge, says Guisti.

If you entered a store and shoplifted on impulsed, because maybe the opportunity presented itself, then you cannot be guilty of burglary, because you thought to commit a theft crime once inside the store, according to Guisti.

If you&apos;re facing charges of robbery, burglary or shoplifting you must contact our Orange County theft crimes attorney experts right away at 888-478-8999.

People often use robbery and burglary interchangeably, but those are two different crimes, according to Guisti.

If convicted the suspects could face several years in prison, says Guisti.
