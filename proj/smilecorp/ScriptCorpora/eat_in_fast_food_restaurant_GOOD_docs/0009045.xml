Kungfu Fast Food in China (http://madaboutshanghai.blogs.com/mad_about_shanghai/2006/03/kungfu_fast_foo.html)

Most of you probably don&apos;t know, but I actually worked for McDonald&apos;s Australia for 15 years in many different capacities from store operations to new business development.

As such, I still have a soft spot for QSRs (Quick Service Restaurants - or fast food joints if you prefer) and whenever I see or go into one I am judging the operation in terms of QSC (quality, service and cleanliness) and in terms of the business itself. I must admit that I also get excited when I discover a new brand.

Today was one of those days when I had my first encounter with Kungfu.

They are a modern QSR serving Chinese food, their point of differentiation was the fact that the food was healthy (steamed meats, soups and quick boiled vegetables), and they have Bruce Lee on everything!

Sabrina and I had lunch at the store in Hong Kong Plaza on Huahai Lu (its inside behind KFC). So here is my critique:

Service
The service was very quick and attentive, however it was very haphazard. We ordered and the cashier was very friendly and helped us with the menu, but when we ordered at one cash register he walked back to the middle of the counter and punched in the order. Then over the top of all the customers he yelled over to Sabrina the amount that was due. She then had to fight her way through the lining up customers to get to the register to pay. Not a nice experience.

The other problem was with the disclosure of what was in certain dishes (this is a common China problem). Sabrina doesn&apos;t eat pork, so we ordered a beef and a chicken meal with an egg custard dish on the side. Once we got the egg custard dish, there was a funny grey meat in it. After quizzing the staff it turned out that it was pork. The food providers in this country need to get their act together and disclose the contents of some products. This is particularly crucial for the upcoming Olympics and World Expo 2010 as it will drive hundreds of thousands additional visits over the next 10 years, many of these people will be Jews, Muslims, Hindus etc with particular beliefs. It would be very easy to ruin someones experience in China with an innoculous egg custard.

On the positive side, the manager happily replaced the offending egg custard with another dish, so full points for service and customer care after the fact.

Food
The style of food would be described as modern casual Chinese. It consisted of steam rice with mushrooms, noodles, soup, beef with rice, soy milk etc. You can see more here.

The food quality was great. Everything was hot and fresh and tasted very good.

We had to wait for the beef noodle soup, but it was delivered quickly.

The boiled lettuce in strange brown sauce was ok - a bit more up Sabrina&apos;s alley than mine.

The food was all served in branded melamine bowls with lids - even the spoons were melamine and had the Bruce Lee image. This kept the food hot and made the eating experience more like that of a traditional restaurant (ie cutlery and crockery) although the chopsticks and cups were disposable.

The prices were reasonable, 16 RMB for a meal with some steamed chicken&amp;mushroom, rice and soy milk - and only 6RMB for a small bowl of beef noodle soup (and it wasn;t really that small).

Decor&amp;Cleaniness
The decor was great. The colours, furniture and lighting was very modern, acctractive and comfortable. The store was absolutely spotless. There was not an uncleared table in the store when we entered, not a mark on the floor or the windows. What I could see of the kitchen was clean and tidy as well.

Branding
They have certainly positioned the name and imagery to capture the youth market. Huge Bruce Lee pitures abound and his iconic image appears on everything from the signs, cups, bowls to the tray mats (I wonder about the licensing of his image!?).

The Bruce Lee images made me think of them running birthday parties with a martial arts host instead of a clown. Might catch on!

The quality of the branding and the image they portrayed overall shows that a great deal of money and developmenbt time has gone into these stores.

Overall I rate it a good experience, good value for money in a very clean and enjoyable decor. I hope to see more of them soon.

Kungfu is owned by Global Fast Food Chains and is based in Guangzhou. They operate a total of 106 stores in China, 46 of them being in Dongguan (only 3 in Shanghai at the moment). GeneChing 07-09-2009, 09:44 AM OK, someone here from NYC has GOT to go to the grand opening of this place!
Mysterious New Chinese Fast Food Franchise: Kung Fu Bing (http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/archives/2009/07/mysterious_new.php)

Despite appearances to the contrary, this soon-to-open fast food joint in Chinatown probably has nothing to do with the movie Kung Fu Panda. It calls itself KFB for short, a play for the easily confused KFC crowd. Kung Fu Bing seems to specialize in some sort of flaky bread, also called a Kung Fu Bing, which you can get plain, or wrapped around items like sausage, egg, and cheese. The menu also lists bubble tea and juices.

A lengthy Internet search for the restaurant and/or the food called Kung Fu Bing yielded nothing except this--anyone read Serbian? LQQM -- letters listed next to the name of the restaurant -- seem to be an Internet news provider out of Beijing. A call to the franchise hotline got no answer, shunted to a strangely generic voicemail box.

The guy inside the shop said KFB should be open in a few days, at which point the exact nature of a Kung Fu Bing will be revealed.

Kung Fu Bing
Southeast corner of Eldridge and Division streets Shaolinlueb 07-09-2009, 12:06 PM doug should go there and fill us in on it. GeneChing 08-26-2009, 09:42 AM I know the author&apos;s name is Gene, but when I use a nom de plume, it&apos;s much less obvious.

Kung Fu Tacos Serves Up Budget Fusion in the FiDi (http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2009/08/kung_fu_tacos.php)

&quot;East meets South...of the border,&quot;claims Kung Fu Tacos, a new lunchtime taco truck that couples Asian-inspired flavors with a Latin twist. Kung Fu Tacos offers a menu that features multiple variations, including a vegetarian option, all heaped in fresh-made La Palma tortillas. Kung Fu Tacos starts serving weekdays at around 11:15 a.m., from the corner of Sansome and Jackson in the Financial District. Follow them on Twitter for updates.

On a recent visit, we started with the Mu Shu Veggies taco ($2), which combined shiitake and cloud ear mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, cilantro, and onions. The flavor was great, like eating a miniature vegetable stir-fry. The shiitakes in particular give the taco a slightly sweet flavor and nicely chewy texture.

The Wu Shu Char Siu ($3) featured traditional glazed BBQ pork topped with mango salsa and onions. The pork was salty and sweet, as it should be, but the mango salsa overpowered the flavor of the pork a bit. A squeeze of lime helped neutralize the mango&apos;s sweetness.

The Nun Chuck Chicken ($2) brought grilled chicken marinated in garlic-ginger sauce, topped with onions, cilantro, carrots, and a spicy Asian salsa, apparently Sriracha mixed with ginger. Served in large chunks, the chicken was moist and flavorful. The spicy Asian salsa packs a lot of ginger, which -- depending on whether or not you like ginger - is either good or bad. We liked it, since it added an unexpected layer of flavor.

Last up was the Asian Asada ($2), grilled strips of thin steak, topped with cilantro, onions, and that spicy Asian salsa. The steak was fairly dry and bland. What flavor it did have came from the Sriracha-ginger salsa, which stood out clearly from the unremarkable steak.

Unfortunately, Kung Fu Tacos had sold out of the Roast Duck taco ($3) by the time we got there (just before 12:30 p.m.), and by only three people ahead of us in line. No wonder, since the idea of naturally fatty duck topped with mango salsa and hoisin sauce sounded great.

Overall, aside from the Asian asada, the tacos were quite flavorful, and different enough from each other to warrant future visits (especially to try the duck). The only other gripe is the long lines -- it took us about 30 minutes to order and get our tacos. But since Kung Fu Tacos has only been open a couple of weeks, we expect the lines to subside soon, once everyone has had a chance to check it out. Oso 08-28-2009, 07:07 PM Kung Fu Tacos sounds delish...and I don&apos;t normally go for asian chicks!

Tasty choices plentiful at Kung Fu kitchen (http://www.tulsaworld.com/Scene/article.aspx?subjectid=274&amp;articleid=20090910_274_ES8_Jdiadh360090)

Judy Lin said her husband, Xiadi, went to a cooking school in China and has worked in Asian restaurants in the United States much of the past 10 years with an eye toward owning his own place.

He realized that dream after the couple moved to Tulsa from the New York City area and recently opened Kung Fu Kitchen near 21st Street and Memorial Drive.

&quot;It was too cold in the winter and there were too many people up there,&quot;said Judy Lin, who said she came to the U.S. from China about eight years ago when her father took a job in the States.&quot;We also have a young son and thought this is a good place to raise a family.&quot;

Kung Fu Kitchen offers a cafeteria-style lunch option 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday-Friday. Diners may choose three items among 12 choices to go with soup and fried rice for $5.45.

The selections are bourbon chicken, chicken with broccoli, sesame chicken, vegetable lo mein, beef with pepper steak, sweet-and-sour chicken, cheese wonton, egg roll, chicken with mushrooms, kung pao chicken, vegetable fried rice and butter shrimp.

&quot;We get a lot of working people for the lunch special since they usually don&apos;t have a lot of time to eat,&quot;Lin said.&quot;The rest of the time most of our customers come from the neighborhood.&quot;

Diners also may choose from a 35-item lunch menu with prices ranging from $4.75 to $4.95.

We ordered two entrees off the vast dinner menu the Happy Family ($10.95) and shrimp lo mein ($7.45) and both were giant portions, enough for
a generous lunch the next day.

The Happy Family included a decidedly happy combination of shrimp, scallops, pork, chicken, beef, crab, mushrooms, green beans, water chestnuts, broccoli, green peppers and baby corn in a soy-based brown sauce.

The shrimp in the lo mein were much smaller than the jumbo-sized ones in the Happy Family, and they blended nicely with the long egg noodles and slightly garlicky sauce in this dish.

Both dishes came with a tasty fried rice that included bits of carrots, peas and onion. Steamed white rice also is available.

We also shared two standard veggie-filled egg rolls (99 cents each) and an order of cheese-and-crab wontons (six for $3.25). The wontons were huge and crispy with a good cheesy flavor.

A condiment table included soy sauce, spicy mustard, hot chili sauce and duck sauce for those who want to jazz up their dishes and fortune cookies for good luck.

The regular menu offers a wide range of appetizers, soups, fried rice, lo mein, mei fun, egg foo young, sweet-and-sour, chicken, beef, seafood, vegetable, combos, specials and family dinners more than 100 items in all. Lin said the single most popular dish probably has been bourbon chicken.

The menu also offers two kids&apos; meals, chicken nuggets and sweet-and-sour chicken or pork, both with fried rice for $3.25 each.

The faux-finished gold walls hold a couple of pictures of desert scenes with cactus, holdovers from the former tenant, Taco Tico. One wall has an oversized hand fan decorated with a painting of a panda bear. Lin said most of the remodeling is found in the open kitchen.

The dining room has wood-slat booths and laminate tables that seat about 50. Lin said Kung Fu Kitchen, which opened in late July, receives a lot of carryout and call-in orders.

The restaurant accepts all major credit cards except American Express. Hours are 10:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday-Thursday, 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Friday-Saturday and 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday.

This place is in Tulsa, OK, not NYC. Yung Apprentice 09-16-2009, 11:59 AM There is a Kung Fu restaurant in Las Vegas as well. I don&apos;t know if they are related to these as well. GeneChing 09-16-2009, 12:24 PM My bad. I could have sworn there was another in NYC but I couldn&apos;t get it to come up on a search. If I find it, I do the ol&apos; merge fu... Mr Punch 09-16-2009, 12:38 PM Jackie Chan used to have a ramen and gyouza shop in Shibuya, Tokyo. I was gutted when it closed down, but only cos I lost the chopsticks with the pic of him on I&apos;d nicked so I couldn&apos;t get any more. Maybe it closed down cos the food was crap and the chopsticks kept going missing... :rolleyes:

What&apos;s gyouza in Chinese? And what&apos;s ramen? Always wondered. Blacktiger 09-16-2009, 05:50 PM I went to the Bruce Lee eatery in 07 in Shanghai - great fun:) Andy Miles 09-16-2009, 07:52 PM most authentic: Qing Cheng Shan- Disciples of Qing Cheng martial arts have opened up a restaurant/inn with a kung fu hall. Food is based on chinese diet therepy. Have some daoist herbal wines with your shan yao chicken.

Xia food: There are several kung fu movie themed restaurants that look like the inside of crouching tiger hidden dragon. You sit on benches and swords are on the wall.

Bruce Lee&apos;s chicken: KFC style restaurant with many branches in Guangzhou. Fried Chicken just like Bruce Lee used to make.

Three Kingdom BBQ: Eat like a Ba Wang. Generous portions of meat and beer? everything that a warrior king needs.

Blogging: China Again by BSLG (http://foodbizdaily.com/articles/92676-blogging-china-again-by-bslg.aspx)

China, once seen as offering unlimited growth potential for US fast food brands, is experiencing one of its few challenges in the current economy. Elsewhere in the world, same store sales have stayed strong as consumers trade down from casual dining to QSR for price reasons. But Western fast-food meals are increasingly seen by the Chinese as too expensive and unhealthful. KFC in particular met with early success in China in part because consumers viewed it as cleaner and offering more-hygienic foods. Recent ads and promotional materials there have stressed good value, high quality and healthful lifestyles.

Overall, health issues are not yet as prominent among Chinese consumers (though 2 years of melamine catastrophes have pushed awareness along at the speed of light). It&apos;s the high relative cost of Western QSR dining that has run smack into the current economic downturn. In a recent survey by the marketing research firm Millward Brown found that 78% of Chinese consumers were feeling some effect from the global financial crisis. About half said they were likely to cut down on eating at Western fast-food restaurants. Yum Brands Inc., China&apos;s largest restaurant chain with nearly 2,500 KFCs and 416 Pizza Huts, said same-store sales in the country were up just 1% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with year-earlier growth of 17%.

In the U.S., Yums same-store sales rose 2% in the latest quarter. McDonalds doesn&apos;t report figures for China, where it has about 1,050 stores, but the head of their operations admitted things were soft at the end of last year. Joining other US retailers in China, including Wal-Mart, McDonalds has cut prices on its value meals to $2.42, a saving of up to 1/3 on a double cheeseburger, medium-size fries (or cup of corn) and a Coke. Despite the softening, McDonalds plans on opening 175 stores in the Chinese market, more than anywhere else. Other food and beverage retailers, including Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and Cold Stone Creamery, are planning expansion in China.

Eating out has been growing by double digits there in recent years. The China Cuisine Association estimates sales surged 24% last year to $225bn at the nation&apos;s 4 million eating and drinking establishments. KFC, which opened its first store in China in 1987 and has spread into the rural parts of China, and its restaurants there are usually full. Few other foreign retailers in China have yet to enter such smaller markets inland, tending to focus instead on young consumers and the middle class in China&apos;s urban centers. Such a strategy is being challenged by the alarming drop-off in overall growth in the coastal cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen as the countrys export juggernaut slows dramatically.

And the Chinese have been adept students of Western fast food success. Real Kungfu, a chain of 309 restaurants adorned with an image of Bruce Lee in its logo, has its own line extra value meals that includes rice, meat and vegetables, steamed egg, soybean milk and green-bean soup for about $2.58.

How long before Real Kungfu opens in the US? lianweizhi 09-21-2009, 01:12 PM What&apos;s gyouza in Chinese? And what&apos;s ramen? Always wondered.

I think Gyouza is either jiaozi (饺子) or guotie (锅贴). It&apos;s probably jiaozi but the way they make it in Japan is more similar to the latter (pan fried vs. steamed or boiled for jiaozi).

As for ramen, most of the time I see the characters拉面, or lamian, on packages of ramen, regardless of where it is from. However, lamian in Chinese refers to hand pulled noodles. The packaged flashdried stuff we call方便面(fangbian mian - convenient noodles), although I have heard other names for it as well. Hope that helps! lkfmdc 09-21-2009, 01:31 PM KFC

American Lorain Signs Contracts With Two Popular Chain Restaurants in China (http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-22-2009/0005098955&amp;EDATE=)

Under the cooperation agreement with KUNGFU, American Lorain will distribute beef products, mixed vegetables, and frozen chestnut kernels for a total sales value of up to RMB 14.4 million (approximately $2.1 million) to be delivered throughout 2010. The Company has already begun supplying CSC with frozen vegetables and chestnuts and is currently in negotiations with CSC headquarters to determine the distribution of more products. The Company estimates that the increased cooperation with CSC may add approximately RMB 60.0 million (approximately $8.8 million) in revenue for fiscal year 2010.

The Company continues to distribute products under the contract.

&quot;We are honored to cooperate with KUNGFU and CSC and believe we can provide these restaurant chains with a stable supply of high-quality food products and superior services, thus helping them eliminate food safety concerns and the need to establish stricter quality control standards,&quot;said Mr. Si Chen, Chief Executive Officer of American Lorain.&quot;In recent years, chain restaurants have grown in popularity in China for their convenience, consistent quality, and neatness. Cooperating with them should help us reach a broader consumer base domestically.&quot;

I thought it was like the one in China I was told about from Yee Chi Wai.

It was a restaurant but also had a performance.

The Waiters were skilled in martial arts and you could order a demonstration from an actual Menu that listed various Hand, weapon and partner forms.

I&apos;m not kidding.

Now if this was to open up here in the states then it would be pretty cool.

There was once a bar in NYC that was Martial Arts themed decorations andalways had some movie playing.

Once even the Palladium (showing my age ) had a Kung Fu Fighting Night complete with movies and demonstrations while the DJ had the dance floor packed. SPJ 10-02-2009, 07:55 AM my brothers and I have the ideas long ago.

kung fu pictures on the wall, tai chi 24 postures, shaolin hong fist, tan tui 12 roads, shuai jiao ba zi--- basic jian shu or dao shu, basic poles and spears postures

kung fu moves/styles names for the menu for the foods

but we give up, may be we just like to eat and not to think about kung fu anymore.

b/c we are not in a training hall anymore.

there are names for legends of water margins for the food names

such as wu song bao zi

lin chong (bao zi tou, leopard head) noodle

song jiang soup

-- tattooedmonk 10-02-2009, 07:57 AM I heard of a place like this where I live ,it is called Kung Fu&apos;od Chinese fast food!!!I havent seen it yet but am going to look. SPJ 10-02-2009, 08:03 AM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ65DM8c1I4

the most famous bao zi is gou bu li from Tian Jin

Gou zi was a boy abandoned by his father. He made good bao zi. it was so popular that many people came and waited in line. He was so busy that he ignored them. thus gou bu li.

Yuan Shi Kai was training new army officers for Qing at Tian Jin.

Yuan liked it much. He presented it to empress Ci Xi. She liked it, too. It became an imperial item.

--

nowadays, they imported flour from cananda and australia. and mixed them half and half to make the dough.

if you are really into money making, try start a chain in your country.

Social networking driving lunch trucks (http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7048355)
Monday, October 05, 2009 | 7:05 AM
By Kristen Sze

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- From the East Bay, to San Francisco, to the Peninsula, it seems everywhere you look - there&apos;s a sudden explosion in lunch trucks. But these are not your father&apos;s lunch trucks; they are serving up innovative cuisine and driving in profits, thanks to social networking.

Roast duck with mango salsa and grilled chicken with garlic ginger sauce, doesn&apos;t sound like your standard taco toppings. But then again, Kung Fu Tacos in San Francisco&apos;s Financial District, is not your standard food truck.

&quot;We took traditional Chinese flavors, married it with traditional Mexican tacos,&quot;said Jonathan Ward of Kung Fu Tacos.

But there&apos;s nothing traditional about Kung Fu Tacos&apos; business approach; its part of a new generation of lunch trucks in the Bay Area, serving high-end cuisine, in what used to be thought of as the lowest of culinary purveyors.

In San Francisco, there is Spencer on the Go, operated by French restaurant Chez Spencer; where you can nosh on escargot, sweetbreads or frog legs and curry. In Emeryville, there&apos;s Seoul on Wheels, cooking up tacos with Korean barbeque meat, garnished with daikon and cream.

&quot;It&apos;s so awesome food trucks showing up. Because they&apos;re so delicious, they seem like they&apos;re exploring new food territory,&quot;said customer Kelly Booth.

Bay Area foodies indulging their champagne tastes on a beer budget are gobbling up the entrees almost always priced under $10.

&quot;It&apos;s good in a recession. That&apos;s for sure,&quot;said customer Chris Kilkes.

The recession is one factor in the sudden explosion of food trucks. Many cooks with a dream can&apos;t afford to open a restaurant, but can buy a truck for under $20,000. And once they have that truck, they go straight into fast lane of the information super highway. This new wave of food truck operators is using tech to grow their business, using Twitter to spread the word on the promotions, locations and more.

It makes sense given the co-owners of Kung Fu Tacos and the operator of Seoul on Wheels has all worked in high-tech. They send out daily tweets, each has nearly 1,000 followers.

&quot;I might decide to do a special the night before or the day of, so it&apos;s a really good way for me to let people know, come to get this, it&apos;s really tasty,&quot;said Seoul on Wheels owner Julia Yoon.

&quot;When I do our night gigs, we tweet about that usually a couple days ahead of time, so people have time to plan,&quot;said Ward.

And if you ask customers, many say they&apos;re here because of what they read on Yelp, Facebook or Twitter.

&quot;My buddy put it up on Facebook. So I looked it up online and saw it was only five blocks away,&quot;said customer Jamie Abenojar.

These haute cuisine trucks are well aware social networking can also destroy them, if customers have a negative experience. They say that&apos;s why they work hard to keep their trucks clean, their food fresh and just as important, their Twitter accounts active.

Real Kung Fu, But Not Real Bruce Lee (http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2009/10/23/real-kung-fu-but-not-real-bruce-lee/)

Todays WSJ looks at efforts by Bruce Lees family to turn the martial arts star into a global brand on par with Elvis Presley and James Dean, more than 26 years after his death. Mr. Lees daughter, Shannon, has set up licensing and production companies and consulted with the estates of other celebrities for advice on how to keep a deceased icon alive.

But while Mr. Lees image has been officially licensed for use by a range of companies, from jeansmaker Lucky to Nokia (which used it to promote a mobile phone with this inventive commercial),there are plenty of unlicensed image floating around on T-shirts, posters and other memorabilia.

In China, a domestic fast-food chain known as Real Kung Fu (真功夫, zhen gongfu in Mandarin) may not use a literal image of Bruce Lee as part of its brand, but its hard not to associate the company with the legendary martial artist.

The chain, based in the south China city of Guangzhou, uses as its logo an image of dark haired man in a kung fu pose, wearing a yellow top that looks a lot like the famous yellow track suit worn by Mr. Lee in the posthumously-released Game of Death. Many of the chains 300-plus restaurants across China feature large, black and white murals of a man who bears a strong, albeit blurry, resemblance to Mr. Lee.

A spokeswoman for Zhen Gongfu said the company did not engage in discussions with Mr. Lees family before using the images and added that they are not meant to represent Bruce Lee.

In that case, it seems we have a shanzhai Bruce Lee on our hands, and just because its Real Kung-Fu doesnt mean its real Bruce Lee

The food is perhaps a bit more authentic (by fast food standards) with a Cantonese twist. On the menu: steamed chicken and mushrooms, egg custard with preserved pork and fish ball noodle soup.

In Which We Finally Try Kung Fu Bing (http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/archives/2009/11/in_which_we_fin.php)
By Sarah DiGregorio in DiGregorio, Featured

​When Fork in the Road first walked by the still-under-construction Kung Fu Bing, it aroused our curiosity. What&apos;s a bing? (It&apos;s the Mandarin word for&quot;pancake.&quot;) What&apos;s a kung fu bing? (A bing with so much MSG that you might completely tweak out after eating it.) And why the attack panda, brandishing chopsticks? We still don&apos;t know the answer to that.

After the place opened, Joe DiStefano went and checked it out for Serious Eats, and reported back that it was greasy, gave him an MSG hangover, and was just generally wrong. But he had chosen the sausage and cheese filling, and that, surely, was his mistake. The bing is a greasy, flaky flatbread, much like a paratha or a roti canai. Filling it with more grease is too much. So we went and blithely ordered a bing filled with an egg, plus the standard lettuce and tomato.

In front of the griddle is a large window that looks out onto the street. An old man pressed his nose up onto the glass and stared at the Kung Fu Bing counterwoman for a good 10 minutes, as though she were a zoo exhibit. It wasn&apos;t a terribly interesting show: The woman forked up a round of dough from a container, and put it on the the large griddle. She took an unmarked spice shaker and shook out a bunch of some sort of seasoning onto the bread. The she cracked an egg and dispensed a large amount of the seasoning onto that as well. After a while, the bread puffed up and became golden. She put the egg in the pancake, folded it up with lettuce and tomato, and added several more vigorous shakes of the seasoning.

The egg kung fu bing is not actually very substantial, and at $3 it borders on overpriced. Still, it was reasonably tasty--the bread stretchy, light, and oily, although there&apos;s no sign of the scallion that&apos;s reportedly supposed to be in there. The seasoning imparted a deep, meaty, hard-to-pin-down flavor that must have been pure MSG. Now, we love MSG. It makes things taste good. But ingesting about a tablespoon of pure MSG? That is not something you want to do. Heart racing, extremities tingling, we scurried back to the Voice offices.

Kung Fu Bing strikes again! And apparently, there are plans for the panda to spread around town. Eeek!

Hell&apos;s Kitchen Alum Joshua Wahler Now Executive Chef of Kung Fu Kitchen at Catalina (http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/shortorder/2009/11/hells_kitchen_alumn_josh_wahle.php)
By Jackie Sayet in Restaurant News

​Being shown the door by Gordon Ramsay is like facing the martial arts whoopass of Jackie Chan in Brett Ratner&apos;s Rush Hour series, only a bit more brutal.

Josh Wahler, a former contestant of Hell&apos;s Kitchen 3 (quite possibly its best season on record,) survived one such exit rather elegantly, and has now samboed his way from Doral&apos;s 5300 Chop House into the role of executive chef of Kung Fu Kitchen and Sushi at The Catalina Hotel and Beach Club. New breakfast, lunch and dinner menus will launch in three weeks.

&quot;I left my last employer at the end of August because I was looking for a new challenge leading up to the season,&quot;says Wahler.&quot;This amazing opportunity presented itself with open arms. There is a single unified vision for this restaurant between our ownership and management.

We are going to shake up the South Beach culinary community with our new and innovative menu, experienced front of house management and extraordinary atmosphere that will make Kung Fu a destination restaurant.&quot;

Sounds like strict corporate messaging to us, but hopefully Wahler will flex culinary creativity worthy of the restaurant&apos;s name. Stay tuned, folks.

Making a name in kungfu kitsch (http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2009-12/04/content_9118602.htm)
(China Daily)

Making a name in kungfu kitsch

Down a small, dusty side street next to a couple of convenience stores and several new highrise apartment buildings in Haidian district sits a bamboo shack that appears anachronistically out of place.

It is meant to look that way.

The shabby structure is home to Feng Bo Zhuang, a kungfu-themed eatery intended to take diners on a martial arts-infused food journey back to a half-fantasized Chinese past filled with evil monks, heroic swordsmen and fair-skinned maidens.

The restaurant&apos;s concept takes inspiration from famous martial arts author Louis Cha, known to his readers by his pen name Jin Yong. Virtually a literary movement, more genre than author, Cha&apos;s novels of chivalry and romance have captured the imagination of millions of Chinese for more than half a century.

Since Feng Bo Zhuang was established in Hefei province in 2000, the restaurant has expanded exponentially across China. There are now 500 locations, 10 of which are in Beijing. The first overseas branch opened in Singapore last year.

All have a similar ambience. Light wooden walls are lined with ample kungfu kitsch: various swords and fighting sticks mixed with calligraphic banners and warrior-filled paintings.

Guests are expected to bang on a large, red drum to announce their arrival after which the wait staff, decked out in appropriate marshal arts garb, greet clientele as&quot;swordsmen&quot;and&quot;swordswomen&quot;and guide them to modest tables surrounded by low, and not exactly comfortable, wooden benches.

From there, the experience slides back further into China&apos;s past. There are no menus. Instead, staff take it upon themselves to decide for the table what humble grub best suits the palates of kungfu masters who have entered from fighting modern-day battles on Beijing&apos;s busy streets.

Making a name in kungfu kitsch

For four people, a spread of six dishes served on replicated ancient warrior pottery from Anhui province is usually selected. Rice-covered chunks of meat and egg, also known as&quot;big power meatballs&quot;, are always included in the mix.

Other popular selections include fried prawns, bean curd with chicken soup and a spicy fish soup with peanuts and broiled greens. The average price of a dish is around 25 yuan. For those looking to splurge, a platter of roasted donkey meat is available for 75 yuan.

These can all be washed down with a silver flask filled with the restaurant&apos;s strong brew of homemade wine.

If any of the platters fail to suit the palates of guests, staff will eagerly replace them with another Chinese culinary creation at no extra charge (unwanted food is bizarrely disposed of in a trash can in front of guests).

Feng Bo Zhuang is frequented mostly by Chinese looking to relive at least a small piece of the kungfu fantasies that filled their childhood imaginations as well as recall a vast period of Chinese history that subtly floats underneath the country&apos;s rapidly modernizing reality today.

A few foreigners come as well. However, for them, the experience may not be as endearing as it is for those longing to taste memories that transcend lifetimes, generations and entire chapters in time that make up the cultural lifeblood of the country itself.

​There were no kicks fast as lightning, it wasn&apos;t frightening, and the staff showed expert timing when the Catalina Hotel&apos;s Kung Fu Kitchen and Sushi recently hosted South Florida&apos;s Chef&apos;s Club on their South Beach rooftop lounge.

Chef Josh Wahler, of Hell&apos;s Kitchen fame, and Nobu South Beach and Los Angeles pedigree, is the new chef in charge at the Kung Fu.

He says,&quot;Besides being a Jewish kid from northern Jersey, Asian food is what I do. I had a pair of chopsticks in my hand as soon as I could hold them.&quot;

Chef Wahler prepared a variety of party snacks for his guest including sushi rolls, a salmon tartare and fried gyoza take on chips and dip, and fried pork dumplings.

The Catalina Hotel is hosting a Spam Allstars New Year&apos;s Eve. A $95 all access pass gets you entry to three buildings, the Spam Allstars performing live, DJ&apos;s spinning, a&quot;lavish super buffet&quot;from 8 p.m. to midnight, open bar, champagne toast and breakfast buffet.

Kung Fu Saloon, Haiti fundraising that&apos;s fun (http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/01/25/daily10.html)
Austin Business Journal

West 6th Street entertainment venue Kung Fu Saloon will donate 25 cents to Haiti for every game played between Jan. 22 and Feb. 1, officials said recently.

The bar at 510 Rio Grande St. operates 19 vintage arcade games that cost a quarter per play. For the rest of the month, 100 percent of game proceeds will benefit the American Red Cross, which is leading several earthquake relief initiatives in Haiti.

This is the least we can do to help those that have been affected by this unimaginable tragedy in Haiti, Kung Fu co-owner Nick Adams said.

Kung Fu is also collecting new or used shoes that will be donated to Karavel Shoes and passed to Haiti earthquake survivors. David Jamieson 01-26-2010, 11:28 AM Kung Fu Kitchen and Sushi is a lot like Ninja Restaurant and Dim Sum...:rolleyes:
So if you&apos;re ever in Miami....

well to be fair ~G, even with your great publication, and numerous others and the consternation of many a martial artist, many north american people can still not recognize the difference between various asian cultural practices, language, arts etc.

It&apos;s all a hodge podge of asian people.

I&apos;ve been in kungfu schools that have japanese stuff everywhere! Look at SD for instance, if that isn&apos;t an asian dogs breakfast, then I don&apos;t know what is.

No offense SD-ers, just pointing it out and adding that you guys aren&apos;t the only ones who consistently make this gaff. There are plenty who mix and match as they see fit, make up characters and all sort of other outright falseness.

poor guy.

anyway, as a martial artist, but not a career martial artist, I pretty much avoid conversations about it in mixed company these days. If someone isn&apos;t already into kungfu, they&apos;re not gonna get much reference to it or find much about it on my facebook page or that sort of thing.

I was running out of the kind of sighs that you let out when the 9000th person asks&quot;kungfu? what&apos;s that?&quot;or&quot;seafood? that&apos;s a funny name for a teacher&quot;or better when they get all racist, squint and brandish their front teeth and make some comment about my brack bert while calling me charie chan #1 son! :rolleyes:

But I digress... pazman 02-21-2010, 05:47 AM Bumping this in support of hot meals at fair prices.

Actually, Real Kungfu is almost pricier than McDonalds. When you are living on China wages, these places are occasional treats. For tourists, however, I would really recommend Real Kungfu. Delicious hot Chinese food in a clean location. If you&apos;ve never been to China you&apos;ll understand when you arrive why this is such a breakthrough. AND it&apos;s cool eat with Bruce Lee images all around you.

Thankfully for me, there are a host of copycat places that have sprung up that do the same for cheaper. Ate at a place today that offered meals the same sort of cool bowls as Real Kungfu and was exceptionally clean: a main dish of mushroom and chicken, a side of vegetables, soup and rice all for 16 yuan.

I think Real Kungfu could be a hit in America, as long as the prices were comparable to McDonalds. GeneChing 03-02-2010, 10:54 AM Although this guy must have a restaurant somewhere in Toronto.
Tai chi master takes on the Dragons (http://www.chroniclejournal.com/stories_local.php?id=246732)
KAREN McKINLEY
03/01/2010

Local tai chi master Peng You doesnt wield a sword when faced with a den of dragons he flashes a business plan.

You appeared for a taping of CBCs Dragons Den in the hopes of getting a panel of business magnates to invest in his idea, The Tai Chi Chef.

Guests are invited to pitch business ideas to a group of five Canadian investors. If the panel likes their ideas, they invest money to get the ideas off the ground and into the market.

I had seen the show before, but wasnt sure if I wanted to take my idea to them, You said at his tai chi studio in Thunder Bay. Last year there was a lady at the Intercity mall that took my information and idea back to the CBC. I received a call two weeks later letting me know my idea had been selected for taping.

His was one of 300 chosen from thousands of sales pitches across Canada.

You, a tai chi practitioner and former restaurant owner, said he has always wanted to combine the two because combining food and exercise is only logical. His idea involves hosting parties at homes and offices where he teaches a few basic tai chi moves, then prepares a Chinese meal. It can be modified to suit all diets, levels of fitness and locations, he said.

The best part is theres nothing like it anywhere else in Canada, You said. Which is why the Dragons were interested in my idea. Its unique.

The episode was taped in Toronto and is to air on Wednesday.

You said the taping was stressful. Getting the Dragons to listen to his idea and having to make his pitch in front of the cameras was a lot of work, but he added that he was excited to show his plan. He even taught the Dragons some tai chi moves during his pitch.

He cannot divulge if he received funding due to contractual obligations.

You need to be really prepared when walking onto the set, I had to have everything for them to see. he said.

Before You left the studio, he invited the Dragons to Thunder Bay to film an episode here.

I told them we have so many great ideas in the city, they really should look into investing here, he said.

Like many excited businessmen, he has grander plans for his Tai Chi Chef idea. Eventually, he would like to have a combined restaurant and studio, where he could host banquets and parties. He also mused about having the Tai Chi Chef branded, to start franchises across the country.

Photos and details about his pitch to the Dragons are available at www.cbc.ca/dragonsden. GeneChing 03-10-2010, 10:34 AM A Precursor to Peking Duck Found in Las Vegas -- Authentic Chinese And Thai Restaurant Features Lessor Known Dishes (http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/Las_Vegas_Chinese_Food/prweb3703874.htm)

There are only small number of customers who venture away from the most commonly ordered Asian dishes at Kung Fu Plaza Restaurant in Las Vegas, and most of those patrons are visiting from Asia.

Las Vegas, NV (Vocus/PRWEB ) March 10, 2010 -- One such receipt that most Americans would consider off the beaten path is Kung Fu Plaza Roast Duck. While most citizens are already familiar with Peking Duck, a famous duck dish that originated in Beijing during the imperial era, there is another recipe served daily that has humbler and more ancient origins.

The Kung Fu Plaza Roast Duck recipe comes from a small valley in China, where the people still speak Teochew (Chaozhou hua in Mandarin), said Allen Wong, general manger of Las Vegas Chinese Food. Even some of their language retains archaic promotions that have been lost to modern dialects. The cuisine, Chiuchow or Teochew as it is called, relies much less on heavy seasoning and more on the quality of the ingredients, which is why we only purchase Maple Leaf Farm Premium duck.

According to Wong, while Teochew people later migrated from southern Fujian in China, they settled from areas that were geographically isolated and remote. Many of the Teochew ancestry can be traced back to the Taihang Mountain range of north-central china, he said.

Its significant because just like not all Asian people are the same, neither are all Chinese people, said Wong. The culture is as rich and diverse as the United States and the cuisine is a varied as you might expect traveling from Boston to Biloxi and Santa Fe to San Francisco.

Attempting to appeal to authentic preference of Asian visitors in Las Vegas, Kung Fu Plaza maintains a menu that includes almost 800 dishes, predominantly from China and Thailand. The menu selection, Wong says, represents one of the most expansive Chinese Food and Thai Food menus in the region.

To review a complete menu, visit http://www.kungfuplaza.com. Kung Fu Plaza delivers within a three-mile radius and is located at 3505 S. Valley View Boulevard, which is just east of the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip. For reservations, call 702-247-4120.

Founded in 1973, Kung Fu Plaza is the oldest and most authentic Chinese and Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. It is open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. The average entree is under $10 and most patrons order family style.

I&apos;m not going to compensate you for that, but you could wheedle a free meal from it. You&apos;d just have to hustle it with the manager, get some pics and deliver a decent restaurant review. Let me know what you&apos;re doing and I&apos;ll back you up if the manager runs a check on your authenticity. I&apos;m just putting that out there because I know some of you members could probably use a good meal. ;) GeneChing 05-07-2010, 09:42 AM More on Kung Fu Plaza (http://www.prweb.com/releases/Las-Vegas/Restaurant-Thai-food/prweb3966594.htm).

One Restaurant Owners Thoughts On Obamas Healthier Foods Campaign

Las Vegas, NV (Vocus/PRWEB ) May 7, 2010 -- Allen Wong, general manger of Kung Fu Plaza, a Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas, has taken a real interest in first lady Michelle Obamas national campaign to fight childhood obesity. While most of the campaign is geared toward mobilizing public- and private-sector resources to coordinate public information, Wong believes any healthy food campaign ought to occur in the public school system.

Student meals are often high in fat, additives, and preservatives
So far, the only defense various school districts have offered up is that brown bag lunches tend to be less healthy. I dont understand when less adequate became an acceptable replacement for less than adequate. Make better meals at school and kids wont pack brown bag lunches.
Thai food is the healthiest cuisine on the planet. The ingredients have numerous health benefits, including anti-oxidants and immune-system boosters
I became more aware of the Clark County School District lunch program after a friend of mine mentioned that his childs school rewards children with candy and other sweets
When I asked him what they had for lunch, he said the menu read like a fast food restaurant.

I dont understand when less adequate became an acceptable replacement for less than adequate. Make better meals at school and kids wont pack brown bag lunches.

As a point of comparison, Wong cites a Feb. 2008 article in Edutopia that compared school lunches in the United States, Russia, and Japan (http://www.edutopia.org/lunch-around-the-world). Americans are eating turkey dogs and tater tots. Russians are eating beef, beet soup, and rye bread. And Japanese students are eating wonton miso soup, spinach and Chinese cabbage, rice, and milk.

Thai food is the healthiest cuisine on the planet. The ingredients have numerous health benefits, including anti-oxidants and immune-system boosters, said Wong. Why arent more programs developing affordable menus that bring the best of the worlds foods into cafeterias instead of the worst?

Wong said that while he has an affinity for Thai food, the solution doesnt have to be Thai cuisine. The National Farm to School Network program is one step in the right direction, even if Wongs home state is one of only two states that has not made any progress to improve school lunches. The national program is committed to delivering farm fresh foods as opposed to relying on caterers. Forty-three states have operational programs and five more are committed to them.

I became more aware of the Clark County School District lunch program after a friend of mine mentioned that his childs school rewards children with candy and other sweets, said Wong. When I asked him what they had for lunch, he said the menu read like a fast food restaurant.

Wong says he made a joke about how his friends children ought to be eating Thai food. Rather than laugh it off, his friend said such a change would be welcomed, adding that Obamas national campaign to fight childhood obesity should begin by fixing what the government serves children for lunch.

Authentic Thai Restaurant Helps Educate Customers About The Cuisine

Las Vegas, NV (Vocus) July 15, 2010

When Americans visit Kung Fu Plaza, a Las Vegas Restaurants that has been serving the oldest and most authentic Chinese food and Thai food in the valley since 1974, it is not uncommon for them to browse some 800 dishes and ask if there is a difference between Thai food and Chinese food. The question always makes Allen Wong, general manger of Kung Fu Plaza, smile.

Everything is different between Thai food and Chinese food, Wong says. Many Thai dishes cannot even be cooked properly at home because they require temperatures of 400 degrees for the ingredients, vegetables, and meats to bond properly, which most conventional stovetop burners cannot reach. I know, Ive tried myself.

Wong should know. His parents immigrated to the United States from Thailand in the 1960s, opening one of the first Thai restaurants in the United States. The concept was so different then that his parents named the restaurant Kung Fu to help distinguish it from Chinese restaurants.

Most people assume the difference is the spice, but that is not really true, says Wong. Thai cooking was influenced by India, China, Persia, and other countries across Southeast Asia. That is the charm about our food; it blends all of these influences to make something very new and unique.

Like American cuisine, Thai cuisine is also divided into regional cooking, with the central region consisting of the most dishes familiar to Americans. Rice, fish, vegetables with garlic, black pepper, and fish sauce-nam pla are common. The introduction of fiery-hot chili peppers was not introduced until the 1500s, along with coriander, lime, and tomato imported from the West. All of these ingredients were used to create increasingly complex blends.

The most common staple is sweet jasmine rice, which is indigenous to Thailand. Most authentic Thai meals consist of rice khao with complementary dishes served concurrently. Gang pad and Gang juud refer to curried dishes and soups whereas Yum refers to Thai style salads.

Alongside traditional dishes such as Tom-Yum Koong, Pad Thai, Pa-nang and Laarb, Kung Food Plaza serves an abundance of Chinese dishes. Originally, they were incorporated at the request of customers looking for popular Chinese dishes in the 1970s. Since, Kung Fu Plaza has added dozens of lesser known recipes.

We use curries from several regions to create unique dishes, including Pa-nang and a spicy Thai Green curry, says Wong. We also serve Laarb, which is a rural classic, and have created our own Smoked Pork Salad.

A FORK ON THE ROAD
Life is a cabaret at Kung Fu&amp;Sushi (http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/15/1730049/life-is-a-cabaret-at-kung-fu-sushi.html)

Nathan Lieberman has gone from snow bird to Peking duck. The restaurateur who spent winters in South Florida as a kid now offers the classic duck dish at Kung Fu Kitchen&amp;Sushi on the beach. The menu combines Chinese favorites, maki rolls and a smattering of Southeast Asian dishes.

The eclectic space in the Catalina hotel lobby has an onyx sushi bar that lights up, magenta ceilings hung with black glass chandeliers and a mural of a samurai sporting headphones. A DJ spins most nights. On Saturday nights there&apos;s an interactive burlesque show based on Forbidden City, a &apos;30s club in San Francisco, creating a three-ring circus of fun, food and music.

Lieberman, 31, a native of Philadelphia, grew up in an eccentric Russian-Romanian-American family, and studied real estate finance and film at NYU while working in restaurants. After graduating, he moved to Miami, where his parents had ``retired&apos;&apos; and worked in construction and promoted club events.

Six years ago his dad, Alan Lieberman, bought the Catalina and renovated it himself. Dad designed and built the interior; Nathan hired several sushi chefs and Chef Oa to run the Chinese kitchen.

Starters include chunks of miso-glazed sea bass, octopus salad with avocado and kimchi, and Vietnamese rice papers rolled up in tofu, lettuce and bean sprouts with peanut dipping sauce. General Tsao chicken (stir-fried bits of bird, bell peppers and whole dried red chiles in a sweet spicy sauce) or pepper steak strips tossed with asparagus can be shared by two with shrimp crackers and cubes of fried tofu.

The deep-fried snapper looks whole, but it is filleted skin wrapped around bite-size bits of fish under a top hat of crispy potato ``noodles&apos;&apos; doused in ginger-honey sauce. Tangy pad Thai has shrimp, veggies, omelet strips and peanuts.

The signature roll is the Kung Fu crunch with cream cheese, crabstick and spicy tuna topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce. Scallop dynamite is a house special with chopped bivalves rolled up inside out with red tobiko and spicy mayo. There&apos;s also sushi rolled in cucumber instead of rice.

The sushi counter hops until the wee hours with combos from Iron Monkey to Godzilla served with sake bombs.

Vanilla ice cream with lychees makes for a cool ending in this funky-hip spot.

Kung Fu Bing Reveals Itself (http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/archives/2010/07/kung_fu_bing_re.php)
By Rebecca Marx, Fri., Jul. 16 2010 @ 10:42AM

Sometime over the past couple of days, Kung Fu Bing shed the window coverings that prevented curious passers-by from measuring its progress. If the nearly completed interior, with its school bus color scheme, is any indication, East Houston Street is going to get its greasy, flaky, MSG-laden Taiwanese flatbread sooner than later.

​It looks like Kung Fu Bing&apos;s efforts to spread the gospel of greasy, MSG-laden flatbread to the denizens of East Houston Street have failed: sometime last week, a sign appeared on the doorway advising would-be customers that the store was&quot;temporarily closed for restructuring.&quot;And then over the weekend, this&quot;store for sale&quot;sign went up. Given the juxtaposition of the signs and the fact that the phone has been disconnected, it would appear that, after less than three months of business,&quot;restructuring&quot;means&quot;screwed.&quot; bawang 10-19-2010, 09:23 AM hey gene ching wot style kung fu do u do brdether?

Kung Fu Plaza offers authentic dishes including some of the best pad Thai in town

JOHN LOCHER/LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL

Kung Fu Plaza faces Valley View Boulevard, sort of backing on China Town Plaza.

If you&apos;ve ever eaten in a restaurant in China Town Plaza, you know how much of the clientele is Asian natives. That&apos;s always kind of comforting, because it conveys a feeling of authenticity, a validation that the people who are running the place know what they&apos;re doing.

Kung Fu Plaza is in China Town Plaza (or at least adjacent to it, facing Valley View Boulevard), and on the evening of our visit, there were a lot of regulars, a whole lot of whom weren&apos;t Asian natives. But if that raises questions of quality, consider this: It opened, downtown, in 1973.

I can&apos;t even imagine a Thai restaurant in Las Vegas in 1973. Actually, I can&apos;t imagine a Thai restaurant in most parts of the country in 1973. Thai food didn&apos;t become familiar to most Americans until around the late &apos;80s, and even later in some areas (and still not, in some).

But that&apos;s when Kung Fu Plaza was opened, by Thai immigrants, which explains the large component of more-familiar Chinese dishes on its menu -- a component that was even larger in the &apos;70s, according to the restaurant&apos;s website. It also explains the name (remember the kung fu frenzy of the early &apos;70s?) and the clientele. A restaurant in business in Las Vegas for 37 years is practically a landmark, and it clearly built the loyalty of locals along the way.

These days, the owners seem to have pretty much returned to their roots, while keeping a lot of Chinese dishes for the loyal. And their pad Thai is among the best in town.

Pad Thai is often called the national dish of Thailand, and it&apos;s practically a requirement in Thai restaurants. A dish of stir-fried rice noodles, it has as many variations as there are Thai cooks, with some dry, others almost creamy. This pad Thai ($8.50 for beef, which we had, or $7.75 for chicken, and on up for various seafood versions) was crunchy. It had lots of slices of tender beef and the requisite sauce of eggs and fish sauce and garlic and chile, but mixed in with the noodles was an almost equal amount of bean sprouts, plus quite a few scallion batons. It added up to a nice bit of crunch, providing textural contrasts that were both appealing and unexpected.

Tom Kha Chicken ($9.25) was the classic soup, served in a battered aluminum hot pot with flames shooting out of the chimney, which as you can imagine kept the soup nice and bubbly hot. We had asked for it fairly mild, but it still had a good bit of kick. It also had a good bit of flavor, in large part because dark-meat chicken was used instead of the more commonly found chicken breast, and the flavor of galangal was clearly present.

On the Chinese side, we were intrigued by the Hon Sui Tofu ($9.25), which turned out to be much less successful than the Thai dishes. It sounded good -- fried tofu with barbecued pork and chicken -- and we could&apos;ve lived with the fact that the pork and chicken were finely minced, since the flavor of the pork, particularly, came through quite strongly. But the tofu cubes were soggy in the extreme and the&quot;sesame-oyster sauce&quot;was without much discernible flavor.

Service throughout was mostly fine, although things got a little crazy when the tour-bus group arrived, which always seems to be a hazard in China Town.

A lot has happened in Las Vegas since 1973, with the city growing exponentially and diversifying greatly. Echoes of the past are still present at Kung Fu Plaza, but it&apos;s to the restaurant&apos;s credit that it has changed with the times.

Kung Fu: Offbeat &apos; but a treat (http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-5582-kung-fu-offbeat-ufffd-but-a-treat.html)
Youll get a kick out of these Szechuan sensations
by Joe Torok

On one hand, theres pig blood curd, pork intestine, or stir fried kidney; on the other, General Tsos chicken, sweet and sour shrimp or beef with broccoli. While most Midwestern diners pull back curtain B, those who subscribe to the Anthony Bourdain school of adventurous eating would surely opt for the former.

The dichotomy is false, though, for both the exotic and familiar are dished up daily at The Kung Fu Szechuan Cuisine restaurant.

Owner Yan Wan Saunders, former coowner of Hong Kong restaurant on Homer Street, opened her own place last October in the Medawar Jewelers complex, across from Holiday Lanes, on the corner of Clippert Street and Saginaw Road. While the style of Chinese cuisine remains the same, the taste is all its own.

&quot;Just because its called Szechuan doesnt mean the food is the same as other Szechuan restaurants,&quot;Saunders says.&quot;The chef is different, so the taste is different.&quot;

The restaurant name does not refer to the martial arts style made famous by Bruce Lee. While the pronunciation is the same, the Chinese characters the restaurant uses for the words&quot;kung&quot;and&quot;fu&quot;are not the same. Saunders says her son, a lifelong fan of Bruce Lee, suggested the name, but the idiogram literate will notice the difference. At her restaurant,&quot;kung&quot;means health, Saunders says, writing out the character, and&quot;fu&quot;prosperity.

A weekday lunch buffet runs until 2 p.m., and the fare is familiar to the less adventurous among us: beef and broccoli, fried rice, General Tsos chicken. Its little touches, though, that set Kung Fu apart, according to waiter Jeff Cho.

&quot;The shrimp we use for sweet and sour shrimp are huge,&quot;Cho says.&quot;Some restaurants buy small to save money, but we decided we wanted good food.&quot;

That sweet and sour shrimp and the omnipresent General Tsos are hits at the lunch buffet, where nearby office workers belly up for a quick lunch. But food that challenges dietary taboos is what makes a trip to the Kung Fu memorable.

The spicy pork intestine ($11.95) is fantastically delectable. Fatty, delicious strips of intestine are battered and quick-fried. Rest assured, the presentation will not turn you off; the strips resemble deep fried strips of onion you might find at a steakhouse. Dried red peppers are diced and mixed with slices of celery, hunks of garlic and little squares of ginger. Part of the joy of this dish is mixing flavors bite by bite: savory garlic and pork with the first bite, the next crunchier and zestier, with ginger, celery and pork.

Cho says the most popular dish among international students is the fei teng Yu ($13.95), also known as the fatong fish or, for the logophobic, simply number 176. Its oily and spicy, characteristic of many dishes from the Sichuan province. A mouthful of fish falls apart with the slightest pressure, melting into the spice of the redorange broth. Long tendrils of yellowtipped bean sprouts mingle with ginger, garlic and cilantro. Black mushrooms deepen the flavor and broaden the texture, landing somewhere in between the tender chunks of fish and crunchy bits of napa cabbage.

The chicken in a hot wok ($10.95) is spicy, too, though with large pieces of bell pepper and onion, its more like a stew than a soup. Served above a Sterno, it continues to bubble throughout the meal.

While the intestines were delicious and the tripe (cow stomach) was good with beef, I drew the line at pig blood curd. I imagined using a straw, but Cho says its a lot like a block of tofu maybe next time, with hot bean sauce ($11.95).

Kung Fus dessert is unique: sweet potato is covered in a rice flour, flattened to the size of silver-dollar pancakes, sprinkled with sesame seeds and deep fried soft, warm and mildly sweet.

If you prefer something fruity for dessert, bubble tea ($3.75) is the way to go.

Bubble tea, for the uninitiated, is an iced, fruit-flavored drink with little pearls of tapioca on the bottom, served with a wide straw.

So whether its organ meat or egg rolls, Diet Coke or guava bubble tea, the Kung Fu knows what drives a successful restaurant.

&quot;When youre hungry,&quot;Cho says,&quot;we have to provide.&quot;

RALEIGH -- An 8-year-old North Raleigh girl learned Friday that her Wushu chicken tacos were worth a $25,000 deposit in her college fund.

Margalit Mermelstein, a student at the Montessori School of Raleigh, won Jif&apos;s Most Creative Peanut Butter Sandwich Contest after preparing those chicken, squash and asparagus tacos with a peanut butter sauce for a panel of judges.

&quot;I was really surprised. ... It&apos;s been really exciting,&quot;Margalit said by phone in New York on Friday afternoon a couple hours after the cook-off.

&quot;It&apos;s unreal,&quot;said her mother, Felice Bogus.&quot;I ran out of adjectives hours ago.&quot;

Upon hearing the news, Bogus said, her daughter didn&apos;t squeal or jump up and down. Rather, she smiled broadly and hugged the 10-year-old girl standing next to her who was among the four other finalists.&quot;That child is so self-possessed,&quot;the proud Bogus said.

Not only will Margalit win the college scholarship, she will appear on&quot;Today&quot;in April.

Margalit is no stranger to winning cooking contests. She was one of two children to win a blue ribbon at last year&apos;s N.C. State Fair cooking contests. That brought her total State Fair ribbons to 10.

She gets those prize-winning cooking skills from her parents. Her mother and father, Bob Mermelstein, have almost filled six shadowboxes with ribbons from the State Fair&apos;s cooking contests and won various prizes from several national cooking contests.

And they have prepared her well to follow their path: Margalit already has her own six-inch chef&apos;s knife. wenshu 03-21-2011, 10:55 AM You had me at:

Masala Twist Replaces Kung Fu Bing at 189 East Houston (http://www.boweryboogie.com/2011/04/masala-twist-replaces-kung-fu-bing-at-189-east-houston/)
6 hours ago

Kung Fu Bing. Lets talk about it. The kitchy mascot-driven eatery lived a relatively rough-and-tumble existence, from its earliest days on Division Street to the final dwelling at 189 East Houston. The Bing survived here for a record four months before closing for restructuring last October. That action was pretty much a ruse, though, since the operation went up for sale just a week later.

Now 189 East Houston is preparing for its latest culinary concept. Another entrant in the local fast food family an Indian joint called Masala Twist (Masala is a mixture of spices).

The interior utilizes the same furniture and kitchen setup as its predecessor, with the only difference being color scheme and branding. Signage is also on the storefront marquee. However, were not too sure its the smartest idea to include a neon advertisement announcing the cuisine as Indian Street Food.

Masala Twist opens tomorrow and will feature various types of meat and vegetables served on Indian flatbread, pita and bun. Also, sugar cane juice.

So, if youre keeping score at home, this marks the third fast-food joint at 189 East Houston in just over a year. GeneChing 06-15-2011, 09:39 AM Kungfu master&apos;s son to go into food business (http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20110610-283307.html)

Enter the Tequila: Voodoo Tiki Tequila Teams with Kung Fu Kitchen (http://www.theopenpress.com/index.php?a=press&amp;id=110240)

Customers at a McDonald&apos;s Corp outlet in Changzhou, Jiangsu province. The restaurant chain is adapting its strategy in China to accommodate changing conditions in the industry. Wang Qiming / for China Daily

SHANGHAI - McDonald&apos;s Corp, the world&apos;s biggest fast-food chain, is tweaking its strategy in China to take account of changing industry conditions.

The new efforts include loosening its ownership structure to expand the number of stores and renovating current stores to provide a better customer experience.

Last week, McDonald&apos;s expanded its trial franchise program to include Kunming North Star Enterprise Co. The move allows the local catering company to take over the 11 existing stores in Yunnan and open new ones throughout the province.

&quot;We are walking our way through this franchise program, we will continue looking for franchise partners in China,&quot;Kenneth Chan, chief executive officer of McDonald&apos;s (China) Co Ltd, said on Tuesday.

McDonald&apos;s relies heavily on franchises in developed markets including the United States, but in China almost all its stores are self-operated.

The trial program was launched in China six years ago. But before last week it had only three franchisees running six restaurants. Expanding the program is expected to help it accelerate a plan to expand its China network to more than 2,000 outlets by 2013.

Adding more stores will help the US-based company to put more resources into China, where competition in the fast-food market has intensified two decades after the golden arches first made an appearance.

At present, the top spot is held by rival Kentucky Fried Chicken, owned by Yum! Brands Inc, which has about 3,200 locations. McDonald&apos;s has about 1,300.

More players are coming in, giving consumers more choices and threatening to cut into McDonald&apos;s market share.

The Chinese fast-food chain Kungfu Catering Management Co Ltd has more than 300 Zhen Kungfu restaurants, while Taiwan&apos;s Ting Hsin Group operates more than 1,000 Dicos fried-chicken stores.

Other chains, including California Pizza Kitchen Inc and German upscale seafood chain Nordsee GmbH, also plan to enter the market.

To foster customer loyalty, McDonald&apos;s is renovating existing stores and remodeling its traditional yellow-and-red decor into a more relaxed and stylish bistro design.

By creating a better dining environment, McDonald&apos;s hopes costumers will visit more often, and not just for the food.

The latest renovated store reopened on Tuesday in the upscale CITIC Square in downtown Shanghai. The new store features free WiFi, cozier seats, selected music and outdoor seating.

By 2014, about 70 percent of McDonald&apos;s stores in China will have a similar look.

The renovation, said Chan, will help McDonald&apos;s stay&quot;one step ahead of the game&quot;and be&quot;different from other brands&quot;in China.

no need to change its image/brand or wearing kung fu or wushu outfit.

The apple cider sake bombs at Kung Fu Saloon (5317 Washington) are far more useful than Jonathon Cidersake, or whoever it was that invented them, could have reasonably anticipated.

Kung Fu Saloon
5317 Washington
Houston, TX 77007

Category: Bars/Clubs
Region: Heights

They can cure ugliness, known as the&quot;Apple Cider Sake Bomb Pretty, Pretty Princess Phenomenon.&quot;They can make you think you&apos;re exceptionally tough, as per the&quot;ACSB Law of Conservation of Getting Your Ass Kicked.&quot;Shoot, drink enough of them, and you might be able to experience the ultra-rare&quot;ACSB Wait, Wait, Wait, I Punched a Cow Last Night?!&quot;theory of relativity.

And they can also, as Cindy Segovia will tell you, help dull the pain of losing a world-class visionary you never officially met.

Segovia is a manager at an Apple store (computers, not fruit). For the past few weeks, she says, her customers have been telling her about Kung Fu Saloon, this sleek do-everything bar on Washington.

When Segovia heard about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs&apos;s death last Wednesday, she and her wife, also an Apple store employee, decided to check Kung Fu out.

&quot;We really like this place,&quot;says Segovia, glancing around. She is sitting inside the venue that same Wednesday evening. It&apos;s the middle of an otherwise uneventful week, but the 100 or so smiling people wandering in and out of Kung Fu&apos;s patio area seem to agree with her, at least in spirit.

&quot;Parking is a little steep [average $10 for the area], but at least it feels safe, so it&apos;s worth it,&quot;Segovia continues.&quot;Every drink is $5 and under. It&apos;s been a lot of fun.&quot;

Kung Fu Saloon was basically built up from a dead lot five months ago, assembled to mimic the bar&apos;s Austin location. If you&apos;ve been to the original, you will instantly recognize the new one.

The doors are watched by large, handsome men with nice hair who are obliquely intimidating. They&apos;ve garnered a reputation for not letting minorities, specifically Asians, enter without a hassle. Tonight, though, the crowd is generally young and professional, and appears to be a fair mix of races.

Kung Fu&apos;s interior is open, clean and attractive. High ceilings, polished concrete floors, real wood accents, and a bushel of HD TVs and video games work in unison to hold your attention. The games are mostly retro or almost-retro machines like Big Buck Hunter.

The saloon plays music, an impressive, mostly enjoyable blend of &apos;90s hip-hop and classic-rock dinosaurs, but the tunes are supplemental. It may look like a dance club from outside, but people don&apos;t come here to dance they come here to come here.

Kung Fu wants to be a good, big, nice neighborhood bar rather than a high-profile nightclub, according to a manager who asked not to be directly quoted. That&apos;s a big reason why it&apos;s easy to enjoy yourself here. The bar is as attractive as almost any venue on the strip the stand-alone king is still Hughes Hangar (2811 Washington) but it has replaced glitz with Blitz 2000.

The most obvious line to draw is to Midtown&apos;s Barcadia (2600 Travis #103), the only other true video-game bar in the city. But cathode-ray gameplay is the only likeness these two seem to share.

Barcadia serves food, and Kung Fu only serves drinks. Kung Fu is prettier than Barcadia. Barcadia offers free games; Kung Fu only does so on Sundays. Both have crafted their own, distinctly different atmospheres.

Whichever one you connect with is the one that&apos;s best. Like an Android and iPhone.

&quot;Tonight we came here to sort of get away from the sadness of Steve Jobs&apos;s death today,&quot;explains Segovia.&quot;You work for this company and get to know and love the product and you see all the positive ways the products affect the customers and you really start to feel a connection to the company.

&quot;It&apos;s like losing a friend.&quot;

LAST CALL

First, Blitz 2000 is just about the best, most underappreciated football video game of all time. Forget Madden 2012 or whatever, bro. Video games are supposed to be fun. If we wanted to run the Power I six times in a row for three-yard gains at a time, we&apos;d play real football. Give us a game where every play is for 60 yards and the players are 10 feet tall and allowed to break each other&apos;s legs after the whistle.

Second, Kung Fu serves that drink that mixes liquor and pickle juice. It ain&apos;t pretty but it&apos;s effective. Try it.

Third, it&apos;s a bummer that the games aren&apos;t always set to free play at Kung Fu, but they are in better condition for it. That seems like a fair enough trade-off, although no guy has ever looked cool approaching a female with a pocket full of quarters jangling around. Cool Hand Luke couldn&apos;t pull that **** off.

Owners of The Sesame Seed give back to the community by handing out sandwiches at The Crossing

Posted: 10/25/2011 04:12:51 AM MDT Updated: 10/26/2011 04:24:31 AM MDT Author: AStorvik

On Saturday, Oct.15, a brand new, family-owned food truck served low-income men, women and children before they celebrated their big grand opening. The Sesame Seed made traditional Chinese sandwiches to give away to families and individuals at The Crossing, the Denver Rescue Missions transitional living facility.

The Liu family from Austin, Texas is excited to bring its passion for cooking to Colorado. Prior to Mondays grand opening, The Sesame Seed wanted to offer their delicious food to those who may not be able to purchase it otherwise.

God has blessed us abundantly over the years and our hearts feel burdened to give back to the community, Grace Liu said. We are thrilled that we have the opportunity to partner with Denver Rescue Mission.

The Sesame Seed trucks mission is to provide customers with the most deliciously unique tasting lunch and dinner experience possible. The Lius have combined authentic Chinese cooking with the almighty American tradition of the sandwich. The Chinese sandwiches are named after the worlds top kung fu stars: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun-Fat, Sammo Hung and Jet Li.

Each sandwich uses fresh baked Chinese flat bread. In Chinese, the bread is called sao bing.The sao bings have a flaky exterior topped with black and white sesame seeds. The Sesame Seeds top chef, Mei, has taken lessons from sao bing specialists located in Taipei, Taiwan to ensure the authenticity and taste of each sandwich.

Taste Test: Kung Fu Bubble Tea (http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/2012/05/taste_test_kung.php)
By Clarissa Wei Wed., May 16 2012 at 9:03 AM

Fork in the Road headed to Kung Fu Tea in the East Village yesterday for a taste of their bubble milk tea ($3). Our verdict: compared to its East Village bubble tea counterparts, Kung Fu reigns superior.

The shop is owned by Taiwanese management and unlike neighboring Taiwanese joints T-Kettle and Saint&apos;s Alp Tea House, it is strictly a bubble tea shop. No snacks or any other food offerings -- just boba.

Though the drink was on the sweeter side, the milk tea was not watered down and the tapioca pearls were sufficiently chewy. The pearls also had a sweet aftertaste. And unlike T-Kettle, where the bubble tea is shaken by hand, Kung Fu has a automatic bubble tea shaker which gives the milk tea its consistent and creamy flavor.

Kung Fu also has one of the most extensive bubble tea menus in the city and provides traditional Taiwanese offerings like mung bean, red bean, white gourd, herbal jelly, and longan red date. But for those who aren&apos;t into the traditional, the shop also has more familiar options such as their chai latte, Italian mocha, caramel macchiato, and chocolate coffee.

Patrons can also customize their drinks to differing levels of sweetness.

Kung Fu is the go-to place for a bubble tea fix. T-Kettle&apos;s tea is plain and Saint&apos;s Alp is only good for their hot milk tea.

Although the quality at Kung Fu is admittedly not comparable to the bubble tea selections in Taiwan, it definitely is the best of its kind in the East Village.

Cash only.

Dojo Dog: Where martial arts meet street food truck (http://www.mercurynews.com/food-wine/ci_20674785/dojo-dog-where-martial-arts-meet-street-food)

Michael Koh, 19, left, a junior environmental economics major at the... ( D. ROSS CAMERON )

The saga of the hot dogs began late one night.

UC Berkeley junior Michael Koh and his friends had followed up their study session with a few beers and a quick jaunt to Berkeley&apos;s venerable Top Dog for some buns on the run. In fact, it was such a quick jaunt they rushed right past the condiments, completely forgetting that a frankfurter sans ketchup or mustard is a sadly naked dog. And being college students, they didn&apos;t have what you might call a well-stocked fridge.

&quot;We&apos;re all Asian,&quot;Koh says,&quot;so all we had was a bottle of teriyaki.&quot;

Turns out, a teriyaki-topped hot dog tastes pretty decent. The fusion experiments that followed -- katsu sauce, shredded nori, wasabi! -- tasted even better. And when Koh added some sly names to his creations, he had a hit on his hands.

These days, every Cal kid can get their hands on a Shaolin Monk hot dog, a Wushu frank or a Ninjitsu, topped with flash-grilled cabbage, shredded nori and, in an homage to the condiment that started it all, teriyaki sauce.

Other college students make ends meet by playing barista or washing dishes in the dining hall, but Koh, an environmental econ major, has gone entrepreneurial instead. His street food truck -- the bright blue Dojo Dog food cart -- opened shop just a few yards from Sproul Plaza in January.

As for those hot dog monikers, they are a nod to the martial arts combat techniques Koh admires, even if he can&apos;t actually do them.

&quot;They never worked out for me,&quot;he says.&quot;But we wrap (the hot dog) with the diet of a Shaolin Monk.&quot;

That would be the low-carb, seaweed-wrapped option. The other hot dogs come on hoagie-style rolls.

Koh may be the first undergrad to run his own food truck at Cal, but street food fever is taking over not only cities, but also college campuses from coast to coast. Schools in Southern California, Texas, Oregon and Washington have launched their own versions of Off the Grid street food fests, bringing fleets of food trucks on campus. A trio of students at Bowdoin College in Maine launched a food truck in February. And law students in Pennsylvania have begun holding workshops for anyone interested in starting a food truck business of their own.

There&apos;s no doubt that street food trucks are hot, says Matt Cohen, founder of Off the Grid, which hosts food truck gatherings in Berkeley, San Mateo and San Francisco. But most people who run trucks these days are line cooks or chefs who decided to go solo, or caterers looking to branch out. In other words, professionals.

&quot;(But) the original nouveau food trucks were run by foodies,&quot;Cohen says.&quot;They think, &apos;I&apos;m going to start a restaurant!&apos;&quot;

Koh was one of those. He had dreamed of opening a restaurant someday, he says,&quot;But because of the capital investment, I had to basically start off a little bit humble. I looked into street food.&quot;

Of course, it doesn&apos;t take a CPA to figure out that a food truck is significantly less expensive to launch than a bricks-and-mortar eatery. And if you take the secondhand food cart option, as Koh did, the costs drop even further, which makes it a viable option for an entrepreneurial foodie, especially one as intrepid as Koh.

Koh was just 16 when he decided he wanted to&quot;explore the world.&quot;And the fact that he didn&apos;t speak any English didn&apos;t stop him from packing up and moving from his parents&apos; home in Taiwan to San Mateo, where he set up housekeeping in an apartment his father keeps here, and enrolled in high school. Nothing, he says, gets in the way of a dream.

But even Cohen is impressed that an undergrad took the plunge and that Koh managed to score one of Berkeley&apos;s, much-coveted, four-year contracts -- Koh&apos;s runs through December 2015 -- and that he put the whole deal together, bureaucratic red tape and all, while studying for final exams.

&quot;That was a nightmare,&quot;Koh concedes.

Koh had filed for the permit last summer, but hadn&apos;t bought the cart, finessed the menu or begun the protracted business of getting city, county and health department approval until he got the formal OK from the university. Which meant he had five weeks to do everything -- while cramming for exams.

It probably helped, he says, that he didn&apos;t know what he was getting into, until he was up to his neck in it.

So, would he do it again?

&quot;That&apos;s debatable,&quot;he says.&quot;I&apos;m enjoying it a lot, but I&apos;d enjoy being a normal student, partying, going to Top Dog. There&apos;s definitely trade-offs, but it&apos;s made my life a lot more colorful.&quot;

Meanwhile, his parents have no clue that their globe-trotting son owns his own business now. They just think he&apos;s been really busy.

&quot;My dream is they&apos;re going to come visit me for my graduation,&quot;he says.&quot;I&apos;ll take them to the cart, and after they finish, I&apos;ll say, &apos;By the way, this is mine.&apos;&quot;

Inside A Dojo Dog

Asian fusion fare is hardly a novelty, but when the culinary areas being fused involve hot dogs, seaweed and martial arts combat techniques, it looks something like this:

Ninjitsu: A Dojo Dog dog topped with shredded nori, flash-grilled cabbage, teriyaki sauce and Japanese mayonnaise, in a hoagie-style bun.

Kendo: Bonito flakes, cabbage, soy paste and wasabi mayonnaise.

Wushu: Pork sung, cabbage, katsu sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.

Shaolin Monk: Lettuce, grilled cabbage and a miso glaze, wrapped in nori rather than a bun.

Find Dojo Dog online: at www.facebook.com/DojoDog, follow them on Twitter @BerkeleyDojoDog, and seek them out in the real world at the corner of Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley from 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays. Are the Shaolin monk dogs veg?

Owners of Kung Fu Hoagies Combine Their Two Passions: Martial Arts and Veggies (http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/158618395.html)

Seitan worshippers: Steve Renzi (left) and Paul Davis operate Kung Fu Hoagies, a vegetarian/vegan food cart that serves up Vietnamese favorites.

Yo, its the Wu-Tang hoagies! a black kid on a bike says to his buddy as they roll through West Phillys Clark Park on a recent Sunday morning. Off to the side is a distinctive orange-yellow food cart with a green smoke-breathing dragon painted on its side, big red umbrella and a pair of Chinese throwing knives dangling from either side of a specials board.

Paul Davis laughs as he stirs a pot of seitan chicken in sesame-peanut sauce. Next to him, partner Steve Renzi cuts and guts fresh hoagie rolls from Cacias Bakery in South Philly. Weve had a couple nicknames, says the soft-spoken Davis. Some people call us the Tofu Dragon.

The actual name of the cart is Kung Fu Hoagiesa vegetarian/vegan venture that longtime pals and South Philly residents Davis, 31, and Renzi, 30, launched in mid-March. On weekends, the duo sets up at Clark Park; during the week, theyre typically at Passyunk Avenue and ****inson Street for the lunch rush. They use daily Facebook and Twitter updates to let their followers know where theyre gonna be, and after just three months, theyve garnered steady lines of customers, glowing Yelp reviews and lots of buzz on the street about where to get a cheap, kickass vegetarian banh mi or noodle bowl.

And the kung fu thing isnt just a gimmick. Five nights a week, Davis and Renzi take classes at Seven Mountains Kung Fu in Center City, where teacher Phuoc Phan instructs them in That Son Vo Dao, a Vietnamese martial art that originated in China. Davis has been studying it for years; Renzi got into it a year ago.

Its changed me so much as a person, and I dont know if wed be doing [Kung Fu Hoagies] without it and without our teacher, says the gregarious Renzi, adding that Phan has advised the pair on everything from traditional Vietnamese recipes to the artwork that adorns the cart.

Davis, a talented visual artist, crafted the carts dragon and calligraphy. Hes pretty talented in the food department, too. A Pittsburgh native, Davis has worked in kitchens his entire adult life, including cooking here in Philly at Whole Foods and at Monks Cafe, as well as restaurants in Seattle and San Francisco. Meanwhile, West Chester native Renzi used to cook at Whole Foods and Downeys on South Street, then became a social studies and special ed teacher at Kensington High School for the Creative and Performing Arts for four years before resigning last year.

Last fall, the duoboth vegetarians hatched the Kung Fu Hoagies idea, choosing a cart over a food truck because of both the lower initial investment (less than $10,000) and the fact that they both wanted to be out on the street interacting with customers.

I guess a lot of people who know me kind of expected this, Davis says of the venture. Like, Oh, its another one of Pauls crazy ideas ... But because this brought together all the aspects of my life, I had confidence it would work.

Initially, the plan was to serve vegetarian hot dogs, but that quickly changed to Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine since that was what the pair were eating all the time.

Its nice to be putting out healthy, tasty food, says Davis. I guess Philly can use that, and there arent any other food trucks or carts doing quite what were doing, but were not trying to force people to change. People seem to like it, and good food is good food, I guess.

Davis and Renzi spent months perfecting recipesa couple of banh mi varieties, a coconut-lemongrass beef curry over noodles, an orange-BBQ beef hoagie, side dishes like spicy cucumber, jicama or noodle salads, and moreand going through the process of getting permits to operate their cart on city sidewalks.

Since March, 15-to-18-hour workdays, seven days a week, have become the norm. Theyre up before sunrise to get the rolls and head to a commissary in Upper Darby where they do much of the prep workpressing and marinating tofu, chopping vegetables, frying noodles, pickling daikon and carrots, making sauces. Then its back to the South Philly garage where they store the cart, loading it up with food and drinks, hauling it to the days location, and setting up. At the end of the day, its thorough cleaning, then off to kung fu class. More hours are spent doing touch-ups and other maintenance on the cart, filling propane tanks, running errands and thinking up more recipes and future ideas for the business.

Both guys average about four to five hours of sleep a night. Its a grind, but its worth it, says Renzi, acknowledging that the job doesnt leave room for relationships or even really hanging out with friendsunless their friends drop by to visit them at the cart. Davis and Renzi have talked about a food truck or even a storefront someday, but for now its all about the cart.

We chose this and we love everything about it, says Davis. Im one of the lucky ones to really make work my life and life my work.

FINE MIX:Singapore-based restaurants famed Asian and Western delights are now available here, in Paradigm Mall

Splashed with orange and red, KungFu Paradise is hard to miss.
http://www.nst.com.my/polopoly_fs/1.98617.1340730327!/image/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_454/image.JPG

LOOKING for Asian and Western delights under one roof? Head to the newly-opened KungFu Paradise restaurant to give your taste buds a kick.

Located on the second floor of Paradigm Mall in Kelana Jaya, KungFu Paradise offers an extensive selection of Asian and Western delights including toast, salads, dim sum, burgers, noodles and of course, its famous baked rice.

The restaurant first made a name for itself in its home country of Singapore, but Malaysians can now enjoy its famous The Duo Master -- chicken chop and fish fillet topped with mozzarella cheese, chicken chop baked rice as well as mushroom baked rice.

The restaurant also offers Hong Kong-style toast such as KungFu bun toast -- with salted butter and condensed milk -- and KungFu French toast -- with chicken floss and condensed milk.

For noodles, KungFu Paradise offers the dry and soup varieties accompanied by chicken chipolata, grilled Aussie sirloin or fish cutlet.

Another must-have dish is the KungFu&quot;bumger&quot;, a creation made of succulent grilled chicken thigh with a touch of kung pao sauce.

The open concept restaurant with splashes of orange and red is also perfect for coffee fans, who will perk up at the first sip of the KungFu Stylo coffee, made from a blend of arabica and robusta beans.

Paradise (F&amp;B) Malaysia Sdn Bhd, chief executive officer Elyna Tan said the restaurant, which can seat up to 170 at one time is a sweet place to chill out and relax with friends and family.

&quot;KungFu Paradise is a cafe with a kick, serving unique Hong Kong and Western-style dishes that excite the palate.

&quot;And all the delights are delivered with the speed of a skilled KungFu master so diners do not have to wait long for their meals.&quot;she said.

Tan said the opening of KungFu Paradise complemented KungFu Baked Rice, which was recently opened in KLCC and offers the baked rice signature dish.

&quot;Until Dec 30, we are having a promotion for CIMB card holders, who will get a 10 per cent discount on their total bill at KungFu Paradise.&quot;
sounds tasty, except for the word &apos;bumger&apos;. that name just isn&apos;t appealing. vBulletin®v3.8.7, Copyright©2000-2012, vBulletin Solutions, Inc.
