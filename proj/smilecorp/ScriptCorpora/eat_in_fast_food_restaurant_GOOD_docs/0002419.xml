I am attempting to review all the yummy Asian restaurants I grew up enjoying, because I don&apos;t live here anymore and all my family members have moved back to Taiwan.  Hopefully this will help me remember all the places I loved to eat at and perhaps will one day come back to frequent, family-style.

This place is great for large family-style dinners. Most delicious calamari I&apos;ve ever had in this preparation. Not much else I can say except really good seafood.  I&apos;ve also never had an allergic reaction here, which is more than I can say for 90% of Asian seafood restaurants (though this does not necessarily affect the deliciousness or my enjoyment of the food).

This is one of those &quot;Traditional&quot; family style Chinese restaurants. It&apos;s rated the BEST Chinese restaurant in San Gabriel.

The parking lot is truly terrible, and chaotic. Whenever I come with the family, I would just avoid the parking lot altogether and just park across the street (next to carls jr). The wait is also VERY long. Be prepared for it, unless you camp out before they open

The food here is pretty good. I&apos;m a huge fan of the House Special Lobster, and the Kung Pao Chicken.

Price wise. I think it&apos;s pretty reasonable for the area. It&apos;s about $5-$10 a plate (not counting the more exotic stuff). The food here is definitely ALOT cheaper during lunch.

The service here is great, especially for a Chinese restaurant. Everyone seems to always have a smile.

Overall, great restaurant, decent prices.

I&apos;ve been here twice. 3 months ago was my first time. We went around 3 so there was really no wait. We ordered things recommended by the fellow yelpsters. Pea Sprout, Lobster and all the others. It was a good meal. Had the Fischer Beer they recommended from France. Second time there was fathers day weekend- Saturday early dinner around 5:30pm, we waited about 30minutes (long enough for me to spot the &quot;C&quot; rating from the health dept. Killed my appetite. The line kept growing and there were about 50 people waiting outside when we were leaving. Is it worth it? Couple of tips: Beware the man who seats you, I want to say he is the owner? Half balding Chinese older man, he calls your number but it&apos;s a moment out of Seinfeld....&quot;Cartright fo 4&quot;. Make sure to listen for your number. The man supposedly called our number and our names got crossed off.  Good thing we checked.
Tip #2, Check the bill carefeully - they add things to your bill that you didn&apos;t order.
Go ahead, try it out...even with the &quot;c&quot; rating...just pray you don&apos;t sit near the kitchen, go when there is no wait...and judge it for yourself.

Newport Seafood has been a family favorite since I was a kid and we recently went back for my birthday.

// LOCATION // On Las Tunas in what use to be a Marie Calendars. So glad they moved from their old tiny cramped location to this new spacious and more modern store.

// SERVICE // The servers all seem to be men and they all work as though they love their jobs! Service is quick and everyone always has a joke or smile.

// FOOD // The must orders:

+ Bo luc lac (Vietnamese beef cubes): The beef is really tender
+ Sauteed water spinach or large pea sprouts
+ Sweet and sour catfish soup
+ Fried tofu: Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside
+ Sweet and sour pork ribs
+ Deep fried cat fish
+ Clams with basil
+ House special lobster
+ Honey walnut shrimp

*tip: Great for big groups! My family usually shows up here with 10-15 people.

Came by for dinner the other night. A &quot;10 minute&quot; wait for a table became 30. The interior of the restaurant was really nice.

The LA Department of Health does rate the restaurant as a &quot;C&quot;...

The &quot;Small&quot; House Special Lobster was &quot;4 ish pounds&quot; at $16/lb. We were charged for 5 lbs. The House Special Sauce was bland as it merely covered the lobster. The Lobster was either too big or overcooked...no good.

The Beef Loc Lac was also mediocre. The meat was slightly on the coarse side. The sauce was too salty.

The Fried Tofu was bland. At ~$10, it definitely wasn&apos;t worth it. Nothing special.

The large garlic pea sprouts were expensive at $16. Again, nothing special. The dish was oily...

Service was okay by the staff. The highlight of the meal was the huge plate of oranges for dessert.

...the restaurant was also really hot sitting by the window...

The most memorable part about my visit here was the end. After the meal was finished, bill was paid, we left the restaurant and notice they had a C rating strategically hidden behind the tree or plant they have in front. Talk about leaving a bad taste in your mouth huh?

As Mr.626 felt like I was way over due for not trying this place earlier. But I&apos;m glad I fought the urge and all this hype. You know what? It was all right. Wasn&apos;t bad, wasn&apos;t amazing either.

It&apos;s just like any other traditional restaurant in the SGV/626, except they got those GIANT crabs and lobsters. Not gonna lie, those things are HUGE!!! I think the chinese way of enjoying this type of seafood is kinda over done. You really CANNOT taste the freshness of the seafood. It&apos;s all masked by all the ginger and garlic they use in the stir frying process. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it is delicious!

But yeah, other than that, there is really nothing special about this place. One thing I gotta add though. The &quot;medium&quot; serving of lobster was like $90. Our entire meal was like $140. Party of 6 people. Wonder how much it would be if we got the large order. Just sayin&apos;

Lobster Lobster Lobster! Hands down for their lobster. One of the best lobster dishes I have ever eaten. The line is crazy during dinner time but the food come out really fast once you sat down and ordered. Their beef lo lac, kung pao chicken, and fried tofu are also really good :)
SO GOOD :P

Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant is a family favorite, so naturally we came here after Allys&apos;s graduation. They don&apos;t take reservations, but if you call in advance and let them know you&apos;re on the way to the restaurant, they will jot down your name and give you a number in line. Service here is one of the best for old school Asian dining. The servers speak Chinese, Vietnamese, and English. They&apos;re always helpful and good about switching out dirty dishes, refilling drinks, and getting food out quickly. Prices are extremely reasonable if you&apos;re not ordering lobster or Alaskan King Crab. They also have family meal sets - great for large parties and is an awesome value! Lunch prices here are ridiculously cheap and portions are large.

Favorite dishes from this weekend:
Catfish Hot&amp;Sour Soup (Better than my mama&apos;s shhh..)
Clam with Black Bean Sauce (Sydney&apos;s favorite)
Kung Pao Beef (My favorite lunch item)
Misc Veggie (Yummmms!)
Newport Special Lobster (Pricey, but very delicious with all the peppers and lobster roe)
Crispy Fried Sole Fish (Perfectly cooked and easy to eat without worrying you&apos;ll swallow a bone)
Fried Calamari (Allys&apos;s favorite)

Jimmy couldn&apos;t stop complimenting the food and service!

I came here with a few classmates to celebrate the last day of our quarter + finals. We have previously ventured out to this place before and loved it!

Beef luc lac: Definitely the BEST of all the placed that I&apos;ve had it before. So juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked! It comes with a side of lemon + salt&amp;pepper condiment for dipping, but the meat tastes BOMB on it&apos;s own.

Sauteed Pea Sprouts: I love this! It so refreshing and light to eat. I can eat it for daaaayyys.

Salt&amp;Pepper Shrimp: Soooooo good. Crunchy on the outside with the perfect touch of salt and pepper. Unfortunately, I can only eat a few at a time.

Combination Stirred Fried Flat Rice Noodles: I love noodles and I appreciate that it wasn&apos;t too greasy and had the perfect balance of noodles and meat!

At the end of the meal, they give you the sweeeetest oranges to eat.

The staff is always welcoming and so, so nice! My friend told me that the owners are Chinese, Cambodian,&amp;Vietnamese, which gives them an A+ in my book.

BEST Chinese restaurant in LA... I&apos;m even salivating while writing this review. That&apos;s how amazing it is ;D I hope to come back and try the crab!

I come here pretty often for family dinners. I think it&apos;s pretty expensive but worth it given the quality of the food. There&apos;s ALWAYS a wait. It&apos;s crazy how many people are always lining up here, even on weekdays. There&apos;s even a line before it opens. It used to be smaller and not as fancy farther down on Las Tunas. I really like the new location and has pretty nice decor.

All of the food here is pretty good. My favorites are the lobster, chilled elephant clam (FAVORITE), and the diced beef (I&apos;m not sure what the real name is).

Be prepared to spend money. You won&apos;t be disappointed though! I think they have lunch specials too.

45 minute wait on Friday evening...
No valet. Parking lot was full, so I had to park on the street...

BUT even if it&apos;s worse next time,
I&apos;ll be willing to wait an hour or longer and park blocks away.
Yes, it&apos;s totally worth it!

Simply hands down the best Chinese-style seafood restaurant I&apos;ve ever had.

5 stars to the foods, service, price and cleanness.
Two of us ordered small size of Newport Special Lobster, Walnut Shrimps, lightly sautéed vegetables (don&apos;t remember the name) and Fresh lemon sodas.
Every single menu was fantastic along with complimentary hot tea and oranges for dessert. Several take out boxes were necessary after working hard to fill up my stomach. Our server and other staff were very friendly and kind.

This is THE place I would dine in on a regular basis as well as for special occasions.
Keep being awesome!!!

This has been a old family favorite place so I dont know why I have not written a Yelp review. Maybe it was having it to celebrate my dad&apos;s milestone birthday but a review is a long time coming. I&apos;ll make it plain - THIS IS THE BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT IN LA. Period. Order whatever and it will be good. I know the reviews talk about the lobster but since the restaurant was located at a hole in the wall on Las Tunas and Mission my family has been getting the crab in black bean sauce. With a mound of white rice, its like crack.

Yeah parking is a pain and the wait is long but its worth it. Trust me.

Brought my dad here for Father&apos;s Day and he loved everything about this place.

What I ordered:

8lbs Newport Special Lobster- perfect! though I&apos;ll admit, it&apos;s pretty messy to eat.

Beef Loc Lac (French Style)- AHHH sooooo damn good! Really tender beef, super juicy, and perfectly flavored. I will come back just for this dish because it really can&apos;t be lob$$ter day every time... haha

Shrimp Fried Rice- really good and generous amounts of shrimp to make me happy. :)

Sauteed Pea Sprouts- a great vegetable side and cooked al dente. :)

Chinese Broccoli with Oyster sauce- what you would expect.

Overall this place was reasonably priced and officially my favorite lobster restaurant in LA. Service is kinda funky because we werent assigned a specific server, but overall worth every dollar I spent! I can&apos;t wait to go back for that beef though. haha

Had an early dinner here Saturday with friends to celebrate a birthday.... Well, trying to have an early dinner, at least. The line to eat at this restaurant was crazy. It was my first time there&amp;even seeing the place so I didn&apos;t know what to expect. But as soon as I pulled into the parking lot, I was like WHOA... There&apos;s a ton of people sitting/standing outside waiting to get in&amp;it wasn&apos;t even 7pm yet... We waited about an hour to be seated for our table of 9. All good. It was worth it... They even seated us at one of the semi-private rooms.

Our group opted for the 8 item $118 dinner which included: hot&amp;sour cat fish soup (good spicy&amp;sour tasting broth), salt&amp;pepper crab&amp;shrimp (very good), clams in a spicy sauce (just ok to me), french style beef (tender, good), kong pao chicken (very good, loved it), peking style pork chop (good taste), sauteed peasprout (not bad), steamed whole fish (2 tilapias in a very tasty brown broth)... We also added the house whole special lobster in garlic sauce. CRACK!... I rarely get to eat lobster so i was really looking forward to this. It was very good. Good sized lobster which all 9 of us had a crack at... YUM. We also had some pan fried chow mein with seafood&amp;veggies. Pretty standard. I was satisfied with it.

I liked this place... I&apos;d recommend it. Prepare for a very long wait at prime time dining hours. But to me it was worth it... I saw an Alaskan king crab for the first time. A damn BIG one... Straight of the fishing vessel Cornelia Marie from the show Deadliest Catch. HAHAHA. Awesome.. Felt like such a tourist but I had to snap a pic or two of it. The waiter told us it was $38 per lb and they averaged 8-12 lbs... DAMN. Obviously, we opted to go another direction for dinner. HAHA.... Next time, perhaps?

corkage fee: $15

OK!!  ROAD TRIP!!  ate a mediocre breakfast in the bay area, and drove on down south.  pulled into town, checked into the hotel..and it was time to address the very empty stomachs...yelp reviews look positive, so off we went to participate in some lobster&apos;s death.  (i think we ate at the old rundown restaurant before?)

we got to the restaurant fairly early, so we were seated right away.  we ordered the house special lobster, spicy..and some other dishes..  first thing i noticed were the sub par dinner forks.  cheap stamped steel forks..all the ones within reach were BENT!!  WTF?  when the nice, smiling man brought us our &quot;small&quot; lobster, it was quick to figure out what bends all the forks.  the cheap forks were the perfect go-to tool to dig out the succulent sweet, spicy, hot, briny, gingery, garlicky..lobster meat!!  i pretzeled my fork with some advance lobster freeing moves..man it was good!!  i wish i wasnt on the wagon, or i would have ordered some spicy hard alchohol drink...some scotch?  maybe some cognac?  daaaaaammmmnnnn!!  it woiuld have been great.

service was great.  they duck in and out like vest and white shirt wearing ninjas..changing out your lobster &quot;bone&quot; plate for a fresh plate.  i am no lobster expert, but this behemoth was not fished out of the waters of Maine..we got a small lobster, and this thing was a force to reckon with.  we also ordered a veggie chow mein platter that was dull in flavor next to the lobster..our salty, pork and shrimp lettuce wraps were a perfect pairing..the filling was hot and spicy, perfumed with lemon grass and basil..the cool lettuce vessel to deliver the package to your mouth was  welcome contrast.

sad, this place is so far from home..but good thing too..the food isnt cheap.  our lobster alone was $75...geesh.  (acceptable, for an occasional splurge, no doubt :D)

Yes, every raves about this place. I have been here around 10 times and have had poor service a few times. Last time I was here, we ordered their large crab (which was market price). We all agreed it was frozen and definitely not fresh. The price for just the crab was $97! Definitely will steer my friends away from here.

Ordered the lobster with ginger scallion, and requested a smaller sized lobster for a party of two.  The waiter tells us the smallest they have is 4-5 lbs.  Hard to believe, but went ahead with it.  The lobster turned out to be a 5.5 lb monster.  It was delicious, totally decadent with bits of lobster roe scattered about the plate.  Sauce is the key component - anything smothered in that sauce would taste good.  4 stars for that.

Also ordered the Pea Sprouts and the Walnut Shrimp.  Pea sprouts were light and tasty, but extremely fibrous.  I found myself chewing forever.  The Walnut Shrimp... I couldn&apos;t believe how bad it was.  It was totally smothered, killed in mayonnaise, and wrapped with the thickest batter - almost like a shrimp mayo donut.  I&apos;ve had better at the most ghetto take out joints in Brooklyn, the kind with bullet proof glass protecting the cashier.

We took most of the food home.  The lobster was still very delicious.  The shrimp walnut... after microwaving the thing, the batter congealed and took on a firm rubber like texture.

This is my favorite traditional Chinese restaurant. Every single one of my family members love this place. My family often order the lobster of pick-up when we have family potlucks and gatherings. But a couple things to be aware of..

1) Don&apos;t even bother entering the parking lot here if you come for dinner. You&apos;re better off less frustrated parking on the street across the street from the restaurant. AND don&apos;t even think about jaywalking. I&apos;ve seen many cops camp out around just waiting for those people.
2) Expect an hour wait at the least. They&apos;re really popular and though the restaurant is of pretty decent size, the wait is almost always guaranteed.
3) It&apos;s not that cheap. compared to other restaurants of like, this isn&apos;t the cheapest, but I do think it&apos;s the best in regards to taste.
4) Ask the owner if your party can sit in a big table is you have only 4 people or less. Often times, when you have a small party and they have only big tables, they still don&apos;t seat you. But, if you ask the owner and there are no big parties on the waiting list, she&apos;ll let you sit in the big tables.
5) The server speaks English. Lucky for you all, this is one of the few Chinese restaurants where the servers speak fluent English.

Hope this helps! And, happy eating. :)

Likes: giant lobster platter wow, beef luc lac, chicken, steamed fish, black bean clams, lime soda drink, pink lantern patterns, friendly service

Dislikes: they messed up our drink order and tried to give it to us a second time as if we wouldn&apos;t recognize the same color and stuff in the drink.  Long wait time for a table, but they&apos;re very efficient now by taking your order while you&apos;re waiting so by the time you get seated, your dishes come out like instantly

Fabulous Asian Seafood restaurant that is the best location out of it&apos;s various counterparts.  Started as a family run business in Santa Ana until they branched out and opened the original Las Tunas location.  They have since sold their interests in the original Santa Ana location even though it is still called Tan Cang Newport who even today on their web page denounces any fealty to Newport Tan Cang.  NTC has moved to their present location;  a large, clean. well appointed location that was at one time a Marie Callendars, although they do have another location in Rowland Heights called Newport Seafood Restaurant;  ok, got all of that?  This one is the best of the bunch -- its newer, bigger, cleaner, and the parking is better...

It&apos;s always better to come to a place like this with a group of people so that you can order several dishes and share family style.  With the four of us we chose to go with one of the family meal prix fixe menus for $48 to start with and augmented it with two more dishes to make seven dishes altogether including a soup course...

The $48 family meal menu included the following:

We chose to have the House Seafood soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_… .  It was a hearty soup that had shrimp, squid, and fish balls to go along with the napa, snow peas, and water chestnuts, along with some pork meat based broth;  definitely more Cantonese style and gentle in taste without any spicy heat...

Clam w/Spicy Hot Sauce had sliced green chiles for heat along with Thai basil and garlic for flavor with a stir fried dish of Manila Clams...
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 

Stir fried Kong Pao Chicken (or beef if we wanted) was pretty standard, it was good but otherwise unremarkable http://www.yelp.com/biz_… .  The red chiles supplied the heat while the peanuts provided salty crunch, and diced scallions rounded out the dish which had a thick sauce just enough to coat...

We could have had Sauteed Peasprouts, but chose to have Chinese Broccoli stir fried in garlic instead http://www.yelp.com/biz_… .  I liked the fact that we got a lot of the dark leafy parts instead of just a bunch of stalks for a change...

A relatively small Steamed Whole Fish, perhaps it was bass, I&apos;m not too sure, was prepared the classic way with ginger and scallions, steamed and then finished with hot oil and soy http://www.yelp.com/biz_… .  The flesh was sweet and succulent, this dish is a delicacy that I really enjoy...

To these five items we ordered two more of their more popular dishes a la carte:

French style Beef Loc Lac ($12.95) was tender cubed beef gently stir fried in a sweet sauce that coated the beef http://www.yelp.com/biz_… .  A very delicious and savory dish, this is almost a must order...

When you come to NCT, you have to order one of the house specials, either the crab or the lobster (seasonal price per lb.)  For one thing, they have some of the biggest catches that you will find in LA.  The King Crab that I saw swimming in the tank by the front door had a body that was the size of a catchers mitt with a leg span that could have been 30 inches across, it was amazing http://www.yelp.com/biz_… .  We had the Lobster w/Ginger and Green Onions, a 4-5 lb monster, and at market price it was more than the rest of our meal combined http://www.yelp.com/biz_… .  The real story behind the lobster though is that NCT really likes to push their lobster or crab;  we asked for a smaller lobster since we already had so much food already, only to have our jaws drop when they brought out a huge, nearly 5 lb. lobster.  When we asked the waiter about it, he explained politely that he told the chef that we wanted a smaller one for about 4 people, but that the chef just selected this one and rationalized that this was one of the smaller ones.  Judging by what was being served that evening on the floor ours was indeed one of the smaller ones but freakishly large by any other standard.  Just be prepared to pay upwards of around $80 like we did for it...

We rolled out of there with much of our meal brown bagged, I think we had enough food for 6 or 8.  The service was very good all evening, a pleasant departure from the typical service that you would expect from some Chinese restaurants...

If I were to have a special occasion, NCT would be near the top of my list, the only thing they don&apos;t have is Peking Duck...

I wasn&apos;t that impressed by this place but it&apos;s probably because I didn&apos;t order lobster. We went for lunch so they had the lunch specials which were such a deal! Only $6-7 for each dish. The sizes for the lunch specials are definitely smaller than what you would get during dinner though.

I was looking at their dinner menu and everything was really pricey. Overall the food was good, service was good, and the taste was pretty good. The restaurant also gave me comfort that it was clean.

The wait is too long though if you don&apos;t have a reservation (especially you have a large party). If I come back next time, I must try their lobster since that&apos;s what everyone talks about.

I. Die.

Came here to spend time with family, and plan the cousin&apos;s baby shower... and to EAT, of course. Boy, did I eat! Ate so much, I thought I would burst. Not good, I know, but I really couldn&apos;t help it, the food was so good!

There were 9 of us, in total. We got there right at opening (11:30) and were seated right away in one of the private rooms. My cousins are very familiar with with the menu and knew right away what they wanted to order, which we ate family style.

Service was fast, and extremely efficient. We came very hungry and left ridiculously satisfied.

Here&apos;s a breakdown of what we got:

Fish with Basil ~ my favorite dish. Loved it so much I&apos;m craving it again, just thinking about it. Seriously? I&apos;m thinking of going back just to order some for lunch!
Beef Luc Lac ~ another great dish! Beef was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned!
Kung Pao Chicken ~ pretty basic, but still yummy!
Shrimp With Walnut ~ the shrimp was so crispy and delicious sweet and savory!
Sauteed Peasprout ~ who can&apos;t use a little veg in their lives? Seriously though? They are tender garlic-y goodness.
Rice Noodles with Shrimp ~ Mmmmm...
Fried Tofu ~ I LOVE fried tofu!!!

On paper, it doesn&apos;t seem like enough food to feed 9 people, but it was... and we had enough for leftovers!

Naturally, once the food came, all talk of baby shower plans fell by the wayside. So we resumed talks after we finished our meal. An added +++ for the restaurant? The servers/managers didn&apos;t say boo about us taking up the table for an hour (after we had finished eating) while we discussed our plans. Even though it was their lunch rush! LOVE this place!!! Definitely coming back!

Efficient. Seating for 12, 25 minute wait. Just got back now.

Fast service. Got the set meal for 9-10people ($238).

Lobster and crab exquisite.
Fried and salted beef, chicken, shrimp excellent.
Kung pao pork spareribs good, but hard to eat given goopiness + bones
Fried rice great and overflowing with meat
Veggies (chinese brocoli and mushrooms) complements the meat dishes well
Steamed fish was great.

Haven&apos;t written a review in a long time, yet felt compelled to add to the 1000 others already here. That probably means something.

When I come back to LA, I will be back here.

We waited over an hour in line for two people and it was worth it. It&apos;s as clean and efficiently run a Chinese restaurant as you can get. We ordered the small pea shoots, beef luc lac, black bean clams, and honey walnut shrimp. Everything was reasonably priced and came in large portions. The beef luc lac was tender, black bean clams were fresh and sweet, and the honey walnut shrimp weren&apos;t coated in a thick shell of batter and mayo. Surprisingly, everything wasn&apos;t overly greasy or salty either.

Credit cards accepted, parking in front.

I made plans to meet a friend for dinner and I asked him to pick his favorite restaurant.

He picked Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant.  It was so delicious, I only wish we had more people at the table so we could have ordered more dishes to try.

The restaurant has a great ambiance and feel and service couldn&apos;t be any faster.  We had sweet and sour soup with shrimp, fish with basil and shrimp with walnut.  I recommend them all.  My favorite of the three:  the Fish with Basil.

We met there around 5:30 PM on a Saturday night and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, got lucky with a booth by the window.  By the time we left though, the waiting area was packed.

Even though I didn&apos;t have the lobster, most others did and it looked amazing.  I&apos;ll be back!

(Dined 6/24/12 SU @ 4:30pm): Based on the service alone, I vow to return again and again.

My family and I had just watched a friend in a dance performance of the beloved children&apos;s book, &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;, put on by the Vonder Haar Center for the Performing Arts, at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse, and we seriously needed someplace to eat. So, thanks to my handy-dandy Yelp app, Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant was among the top of the list and was barely a mile away.

I had my parents with me in my Brave Little Toaster, and my sister had my nieces with her, so we caravaned with me in the lead, and in about five minutes, we had arrived. I parked in the private lot and my sister on the street (which later proved to be a better decision; it was tremendously busy by the time we left, and a parking lot filled with driving Asians is never a good thing). Our party of six was immediately seated at a rotund table fit for ten towards the back near the dishes area.

As we sat down, a server placed what apparently was complimentary spicy hot soup for each of us. Then, another gentleman handed us a couple tabloid-sized printed menus and told us that we have five minutes to still order off the lunch menu before it switches to dinner. Initially, we were all confused because we figured it was already dinner time. The lunch menu ended at 4:45pm, at which time the dinner prices were considerably higher. Being Filipino, we couldn&apos;t pass up this opportunity to save some money, so in less than three minutes, we decided what to order (this had to be a record for anyone eating at a new place!): Beef Mongolian Style ($6.25), Pan Fried Pork Chop ($6.25), Shrimp with Chinese Broccoli ($6.75), Fillet Fish with Basil ($7.25), Deep Fried Whole Fish ($7.25), Rice Noodles with Beef ($7.25), and complimentary rice and tea.

Before we knew it, like a great magician, poof, all our food came out carried by three servers! What the fuck was going on here!? Did they happen to have all of these dishes already prepared!? Did we get pulled into some weird warp-speed plane where only we moved in regular motion!? Or was there some kind of ancient Chinese secret going on we&apos;ve never experienced before!? Whatever is was, we were all ravenous, and dove in as we spinned the lazy Susan nearly out of control. I looked over to Dad and he already had a full plate and was chomping away! Maybe because we were starving, but a general comment made by all: &quot;this food is REALLY good!!!&quot; No truer words have ever been said. Everything came out piping hot in bountiful portions, and it was obvious all ingredients were fresh. Several of the dishes were spicy...just the way I liked it! With the exception of the deep fried whole fish plate (and it was only the skeletal bones which remained), each plate looked like they were licked clean (okay, maybe merely scraped clean...that was me)! It was all THAT GOOD!

The service was excellent! The gentleman who told us about the lunch menu literally saved us a minimum of $25.00. As each plate was finished, it was picked up. As each bucket of rice and teapot was emptied, another filled one took their places. And as each water glass neared the bottom, a pitcher came by and quickly filled it right back up. At the end of our meal, we were brought out a plate full of large orange slices as a dessert/cleanser. We received the check promptly. Simply aces all around!

Parking was ample as they have a private lot. But, there are many to be found along Las Tunas Dr. and any surrounding side streets.

Overall, Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant blew all of us away, and whenever we are in the area, they will be our number one choice to grab a meal! I found absolute value as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was around $41.00 before tip, but they got a huge tip from us), and the food was good, too! The atmosphere was very spacious like a school lunchroom with round tables and booths all over the place. The décor is simple and functional. The attire is completely casual, so I expect to don a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops the next time I eat here (and there will be a next time). It pains me to do this, but I will have to knock half-a-star off. Although they accept credit cards, they don&apos;t take my credit card of choice...AMEX! (actual rating: 4  1/2 stars)

Yay, Randy the Rooster here and took a China doll here for a first date.

I ordered the house special lobster and steamed fish. Both were fantastic. The steamed rockcod actually had the best sauce I&apos;ve ever had, and I&apos;ve tried this same sweet soy-based sauce at many other Hong Kong style seafood places.

Knocked a star off for the ridiculous weighting of the seafood and the fact you pay for rice. I wanted a small rock cod and got one. Somehow it ended weighing 3.75 pounds. The lobster was also 3.75 pounds. Every time I&apos;ve been there the seafood weighs ed zachary x.75 pounds!?? (The waiter actually said, &quot;Yes, the seafood is ed zachary 3.75 pounds&quot;.)

I would also advise you to ask how much the vegetables are. The waiter tried hard to upsell yam leaves which were $15! The regular vegetables like chinese broccoli and pea leaves are $10.

I would say the place is overpriced and the nickel and diming with the upselling and charging for rice are things to watch out for.

Oh, if you want a hot Oriental gold digger, stick around this place. Never saw so much Gucci and Prada in my life!

FRESHEST SEAFOOD you&apos;ll get from any restaurant. I decided to try something new because Phoenix has changed since I&apos;ve last been there. The quality of their food SUCKS now.

So, with the 2 of us, we ordered 5lbs lobster in house special sauce, which was TO DIE FOR!!!!  Even thought it&apos;s oily, greasy, and bad for you like any other Chinese restaurant, the freshness, and sweetness of the lobster makes up for that. We also got their claim in spicy house sauce, which was THE BEST I ever had. The clam was plump, juicy, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Unlike some other restaurants, the clams are small, and sandy.... this one is not like that.

I know, I know, there&apos;s only 2 of us, but we also decided to order their salt and pepper fried calramari, which my bf decided to eat the whole plate by himself. So, I guess that speaks for itself on how good the calamari is. On to the last dish, we ordered on choy with garlic, which was fresh! The vegetables were green, and not brown like some restaurants.

Based on the review, you know you gotta try it because it&apos;s not just a hype, it&apos;s really that good!  I think I would a new must go restaurant in San Gabriel now..... when I feel like driving from Irvine to SG.

I have been coming to this place for years, even back at its old location! Parking can be a little difficult at times when the restaurant is packed. For large groups, the have private-like rooms on the side which is great for family gatherings. Their lobster is really good, along with their elephant clams (xiang ba bang), kung pao chicken, and clams. Although it is a little pricey, the good food makes it all worth it! They also have lunch specials Monday to Friday. They&apos;re normally pretty packed during the weekends so go early!

I am hugely disappointed by the 6lbs of lobster that we ordered for $90. All 7 of us agreed that the taste did not match the high price and we even had leftover. We were also very disappointed by the salt and pepper crab as well. I think that was pricey as well and barely anyone was touching it.

Standout dishes were beef loc lac, fried tofu, and fried pork. We ordered about 10+ dishes.  The basil clam dish was pretty good with clams being pretty big.

This place is good for groups.  Service was pretty good for a chinese place. If you don&apos;t order the lobster, I think the price is very reasonable here.  Probably won&apos;t be coming back here.  I think the lobster dish at Chinois in Main trumps this high priced lobster dish here.

One of the better upscale Chinese food places around.  The seafood special which you have to preorder is $75 but it is quite good.  Def a place to go with a group or you don&apos;t mind spending money.  Great ambiance, nice clean seating...and def a perfect place for family style eating.

Dang, it&apos;s hard to say something other than what others have already posted. All the positive reviews are absolutely true. In addition, I would like to add that their non-seafood dishes are very good as well. I would recommend:

Fried Tofu, Filet Mignon cubes, and garlic sauteed cai lan.

WHY write another review after over 1,000 are posted?  BECAUSE we &quot;yelpers&quot; are a community and each review helps all of us.  Newport REALLY is &quot;as good as it gets.&quot; Here&apos;s why:

1) From the moment the four of us walked in ... each employee who saw us smiled and said something nice.  We felt that they were actually pleased we were there.  Our waiter was outstanding.  His suggestions were excellent and he explained why he recommeded each dish.

2) Fortunately, we arrived early ... about 5:30 pm on a Sunday ... following a play in Hollywood.  This restaurant fills up early.  When we left at 6:30 pm, it was full ... and ... people, mostly families, were waiting inside and outside.

3)  The restaurant is famous for crab and lobster.  We choose other items because we didn&apos;t want to work hard at cracking to get to the &quot;good stuff.&quot;  We had hot and sour soup, a crispy shrimp with a white, slightly sweet sauce, Beef Loc Lac (French Style) made with fillet mignon (&quot;out of this world&quot; good,) fried rice, fish and wonderfully sweet orange slices for dessert.

4) Would I go back?  &quot;In a heart beat!!&quot;  The best Chinese food I&apos;ve had the world over, excepting one meal in China!
