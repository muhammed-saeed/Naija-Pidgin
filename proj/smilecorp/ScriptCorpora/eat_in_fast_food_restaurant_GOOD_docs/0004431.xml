When I was a teenager I use to love working the drive thru. The drive thru was busier and made time fly for me. Plus face to face contact was kept to a minimal. I think the cook&apos;s position would be the worst job because they have to stay in their smal work area while cooking.

Doing the dishes! You are shut away in a dish&quot;corner&quot;all day, and you just work your way through mounds and mounds of dirty dishes, and everytime it seems like you are almost done, someone comes and drops another pile off right next to you and says&quot;here ya go!&quot;as if you&apos;re happy to see them or something -_- I hate dishes.

I worked in fast food, and I wouldn&apos;t say that the drive-through was bad. The worst part, in my opinion, would have to be cleaning, whether it&apos;s cleaning up spills from messy customers or mopping grease off the floor. Every day I went home feeling dirty and smelling like fry grease. Thanks goodness I never had to clean restrooms. I don&apos;t envy the people with that job either.

The worst job would have to be the fry cook. Smelling like greasy food is not a pleasant smell. However, as long as it pays the bills, maybe this makes the job somewhat agreeable.

I never worked in a fast food center but I could say the cleaning of vessels is worst.
But it is depends on their own specialty. Some people will good in fast cooking at the same time some are in doing their vessels.
So we cannot finalize this is worst and this is best. Its always the way they do their things easier.

Many years ago I worked at a fastfood place and for me the worst job there was the drive-thru window. I worked the 10 pm to 6 am shift and around 3 am all the bars were closing down and the people wanted food. It seemed every car was full of intoxicated people that didn&apos;t know what they wanted.

Then after they got their orders, they were always unhappy. They would complain that they never ordered what they received. I honestly found it to be the most stressful job I have ever held.
