Good food and very profitable fast food…

Good food and very profitable fast food restaurant. So profitable, that in order to get more money, they have discontinued the free senior drink which amounted to a drink of your choice in a kidde cup. Not a very good move fellows. I&apos;ll put you in the ranks of the big banks that are nickel and dime their customers. I&apos;m not very motivated to patronize you again!
