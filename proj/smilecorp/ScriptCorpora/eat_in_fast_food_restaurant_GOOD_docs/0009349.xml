 McDonalds Wi-Fi &apos;@M&apos; Wi-Fi service should go national by Karl Bode Friday 12-Mar-2004 McDonald&apos;s plan for national Wi-Fi hotspots is expected to be announced as soon as this month, reports ZDNet . Perhaps it&apos;s the hordes of screaming kids or the ambiance created by bright orange plastic benches, but the Wi-Fi trial locations aren&apos;t drawing a lot of use. McDonald&apos;s has been tinkering with web-access for a while; though one such trial was discontinued when a toddler got porn with his happy-meal . Are fast-food outlets really the ideal place for Wi-Fi to begin with? Hotspots are working well for leisurely shopping experiences like Barnes and Noble where you want customers to linger, but is there an ideological clash in offering Wi-Fi in an environment built around speed of service? According to the report, McDonald&apos;s will be going forward regardless, marking Wi-Fi enabled restaurants with an &quot;@M&quot; logo.

 I can&apos;t remember the last time I ate in a fast food place.

If anything, I would try and find a place in the parking lot with a good signal and do stuff there.

They need to do a lot more then offer wifi
 I hope they&apos;ve done their homework, and know what kind of food and drinks people who use laptops and wifi enjoy. Starbucks did good with their service, because their typical clientele is the type that would normally carry around a laptop, pda, and cell phone. The urban warriors if you will.

Mcdonalds, on the other hand, doesn&apos;t seem like such a place to me, and the atmosphere in a mcdonalds is not warm and inviting like it is at Starbucks - which, to me, is going to prevent this service from being successful.

However, on the other hand, Mcdonalds, like Starbucks, is almost everywhere, and it would be nice to know there is another place I can get logged in when I&apos;m out of town - provided the price is right. The starbucks one proves to be too pricey for me, since I rarely use it. If I used it 5+ times a month, it would be worth the service fees for me, but I don&apos;t, so it&apos;s not worth the $29.99 a month or whatever they charge. permalink ·2004-03-12 14:13:57· Print · ·

Re: They need to do a lot more then offer wifi
 I eat plenty of McDonalds and would love a hotspot to download email during the lunch.

The problem is with the greasy keys or greasy pda. I need to copyright this idea here but there should be a browser that works as well as my cellphone for voice commands to go to your favorite websites.

 I think its a great idea.

The whole idea based around McDonalds is the idea of convenience. It would be great in cities where people are constantly rushing around and need to check their email, vpn into their work, etc. (Provided they don&apos;t have wireless service that does that already)

Students would probably make a big use of this as well.. It would definitely draw people in to spend more time in the McDonalds atmosphere, which is exactly what they want.

I can&apos;t see it being a big thing in rural areas, where everything is much more laid-back. From my experience the wi-fi computer/device user demographic becomes less and less common as you get to less densely populated areas.

Mobile, AL quote: The average people who go to McDonalds dont have a laptop... I don&apos;t know about the average McD&apos;s customer not having laptops as many have them now. A laptop isn&apos;t exotic technology as you would seem to believe and owning one doesn&apos;t put you into a higher plateau.

My problem with this is that who actually sits down at a McDonalds to eat? I&apos;ve only done that to eat breakfast prior to a trip. Any other time I eat there it&apos;s because it&apos;s fast and I&apos;m able to eat in my truck.

Who would want to sit down in a McD&apos;s to eat?

A place that should offer free wi-fi is something like Schlocksky&apos;s, Quizmo&apos;s, McAlisters, etc. permalink ·2004-03-15 17:22:22· Print · ·

&quot;Harmful if swallowed&quot;
 That warning should be on all McFood. Every time I see their ad I think &quot;Those McGriddles must taste awful. &quot;
Starbucks is uncomfortable enough when you&apos;re a cheap-ass, but McDonald&apos;s is even more uncomfortable if you&apos;re a vegetarian. Nothing can be safely consumed in that place, vegetarian or not.
As much as I love Wi-Fi, nothing will get me into a McDonalds ever again.
I ask you, who is this FOR?

 Why should they make their food healthier? It&apos;s a fast food restaurant. Only a doofus would expect the food to be healthy. Should Krispy Kreme start making &quot;healthy&quot; donuts because their donuts make people fat? Let&apos;s rip on bars and taverns because they haven&apos;t found a way to reduce beer guts and ugly people from hooking up after imbibing a bit too much. It&apos;s all about choices.

If the food sucks, the food sucks. But do you really expect fast-food restaurants to be held to a different standard than other business and restaurants just because the food grosses you out?

I predict McD&apos;s wireless stuff will fail. I also predict the reason for it failing will not be because their menu grosses out vegetarians.

 As a matter of fact krispy kreme is making a healthier doughnut(read: no flavor) it was just on the news last night. on a side note ever since mcdonalds went with the &apos;heathier oil&apos; their fries arent as tasty as they were before.

 Free Wi-Fi for Me?
 Hmmm. Hopefully they roll out the access in our town. We have one of the McDonald&apos;s Diners which I believe already has it, but none of the regular restaurants that I know of do. My younger brother works at one a mile from my house and my sister&apos;s boyfriend works at another about 1.5 miles away. Maybe since they&apos;re employees they&apos;ll be able to get free access and I can piggyback .

 Not a bad idea, putting hotspots at donut shops, you want to take your time with the coffee, and what better way than to surf the news pages in a hotspot. Starbucks needs to fix their hotspot in Albany, GA, unless they just don&apos;t have one.
