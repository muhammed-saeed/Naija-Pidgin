Bar Campione: Amazing Italian Cuisine, and Great Cocktails!
 Lagosian   1 reviews 2 more images 
Bar Campione is the newest and hottest restaurant in Victoria Island. Its signature Italian cuisine and great cocktails are already a massive hit (not to mention great value)

It&apos;s simply the best place to watch any sports with a huge number of flatscreens including a huge 200 inch HD screen on the first floor. There was a truly electric atmosphere here for the Champion&apos;s League Final 2012 - the place was packed

However, calling it a &quot;sports bar&quot; simply doesn&apos;t do it justice, as it is so much more, and without doubt the highest-quality restaurant in Nigeria, let alone Lagos.

In terms of simply food, many of the top Italian restaurants in London don&apos;t even compare to the consistently supreme quality of Bar Campione.

Keep up the good work guys!

 Favorite Dish: It&apos;s tough to choose a favourite from such an accomplished menu, but the truffle dishes - Penne Romana, Tartufi Pizza are great, as is the Jack Daniels Steak, which is an imported fillet steak, that isn&apos;t sold at the ludicrously high prices that most other restaurants in town seem to charge.

Also, the Mars Milkshakes are the perfect guilty pleasure...

They also deliver, so great if you are looking to eat in or order to your office. We order pizzas to our office from them every Friday.

Southern Sun Ikoyi: Hotel for lunch and dinner
 gordonilla   1404 reviews 3 more images 
The hotel was excellent - although they do run out of food sometimes - on our first night we (all 4 of us) ordered fillet steaks. Sadly they only had 3, so I was generous and ordered a peppered beef and chicken pie. It was reasonable but was a little creamy for my own tastes.


Hours of operation:

Monday to Friday - 06h30 to 10h30
Weekends and Public Holidays - 06h30 to 11h30

Lunch and Dinner
Monday to Sunday - 12h30 to 22h30

 Favorite Dish: I had an excellent sliced fillet steak salad with lemongrass and soy dressing with french fries.

The Lagoon: Dinner on VI (Victoria Island)
 gordonilla   1404 reviews 4 more images 
Victoria Island is a part of Lagos. It is fairly big and is a city within a city. It is not Lagos Island where the Central Business District is actually located but Victoria Island and to be more precise Lekki (Peninsula) is where all the newly rich of Lagos live. Being on the lagoon itself means that you get to see life on the water during the day and at night. sadly we visited after dark, it was calm and relaxing.

The Restaurant was suggested by local colleagues who also joined us for dinner. It was also paid for by them! So thanks twice over to them.

There are two menus - Indian&amp;Chinese and then International - they were quite extensive and all of them had a local touch too. We had a range of different things from pizzas to curries and then wraps.

sadly the service is poor, and staff seem very lax at times.

 Favorite Dish: I had a chicken byriani - it was more of the Indian style than the kind we eat in the UK - it did not come with a curry sauce. the large pizzas ordered by my local colleagues were good too!!

Flamingo Restaurant: Delicious Tandoori Prawns
 MikeOkiro   2 reviews 
They have Excellent Tandoori Barbecue dishes like Flamingo Pahadi Kebab and Flamingo Tandoori Jumbo Prawns! MMMnnn, Ambience is much better than the other Indian restaurants in the Market, and indoor parking space and nice and friendly staff. The speed of the service is a little slow but the quality of the food is worth the wait. If you like your beer and the curry this is the place to be.

 Favorite Dish: I love all the vegetarian dishes especially the Dum aloo Kashmiri, it&apos;s a potato filled with stuffing and covered with their tomato gravy, Yummy! Goes well with Chilli Garlic Naan if you like it spicy!

Jade Palace: Mama&apos;s own
 
 Helpfulness
 ychia76   7 reviews 
Okay, I will be bias because my mom owns this place with a few other Chinese. It is a very classy place and very spacious. You can definitely have a banquet in a white interior space. It has a clean feeling to it.

Food is catered to the Nigerian taste. If you want real Chinese food with unaltered ingredients you have to travel else where like Hong Kong. So for a Nigerian standard it is great, but for Chinese standard it is so so. This I am not going to be bias about cause I love food. I rather pay hefty to eat great food.

What I love is that it has a bar + cafe ... Volar ... love the name too ... on the bottom level of the building. So after you dine out why not hop to the bar and enjoy a drink and some music with live band playing and even dancing will do you good after eating.

Chopstick: Chinese Food in Ikeja
 
 Helpfulness
 ychia76   7 reviews 
My favorite topic is about food. There is a Chinese community in Nigeria. This is one of the restaurant that my dad goes to and he is a very picky person when it comes to food. He is a chef himself. If he says that it is good, I take his word for it.

It is very good Chinese food with a little of experimentation because of using local ingredients. They do import if you have any request, but it will cost you arms and legs.

 Favorite Dish: This dish is an experimental dish. It is similar to a tofu dish but it is not made from soy, but made from milk. It is has a tofu texture and it is deep fried. Crunchy on the outside and silky smooth inside.

Any chicken dish made from locally raised chicken that runs around the farm instead of caged in. The meat is very tender and chewy with real chicken flavor! After you taste a chicken from a 3rd world country ... those Foster Farm or caged chickens are just plain disgusting.

Footsteps: Western style fast food in the heart of Lagos
 bisous333   56 reviews 
This is a bit more western, but you can get things typical to Nigeria, rice, puff puff etc. The layourt reminds me of diners that you may get in the UK so that&apos;s probably what made me feel more &apos;at home&apos; here. Great thing it was well air-conditioned and had TV screens so that you can watch things like MTV crubs whilst tucking into your fried chicken! I know sounds funny but, I was really impressed with the low cost and high taste!

I will update this page once I have found the details of this restaurant, it&apos;s a chain of them so you should be able to find a few darted around Lagos Island. In the mean time go to the link below to see other restaurants that Lagos has to offer, eating out is a big thing and you will see that there are many different specialities in the city, not just African food - there is actually a huge Lebanese community!

 Favorite Dish: Meat pies and fried rice.

LA SCALA: A new change
 
 Helpfulness
 nahelb   1 reviews 
A fantastic ambiance, one of the few places in lagos where restaurant has a beautiful view on a garden with secure parking within the famed Muson Center.
Early this year a new chef was recruited, which has greatly improved quality and taste of the food now being served, with addition of the facelift given to the restaurant under the new management, makes LA SCALA second to none within the Lagos metropolis.Service is excellent and menu has a diversified choice of continental dishes.

 Favorite Dish: Dont miss the Sole Meuniere(Sole Fish in butter/lemon sauce),or the Kyle Locklash(Jumbo sized grilled prawns in garlic sauce).

Churrasco: Very good eats
 
 Helpfulness
 mpanizza   25 reviews 
In a town of VERY few decent eating options, this gem of a restaurant on the Lagoon is worth the $$. It&apos;s pretty much your typical Brazilian-themed restaurant where they serve you cuts of meat off the spit. Pretty good salad bar too.
