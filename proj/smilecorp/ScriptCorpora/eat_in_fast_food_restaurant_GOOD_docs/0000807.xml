Good question–Why don’t little half-and-half creamers for coffee need refrigeration?
 
by Marshall Brain | September 17, 2010   Tweet 
Scott writes in with this question:

“I’ve often wondered why half and half needs to be refrigerated, but the little containers of half and half found at many coffee shops and hotels state,“no refrigeration required.”I’ve looked closely at the labels and they claim to be real half and half. What do they put in these little containers that allow them to go forever without refrigeration?”

What you are seeing, in essence, is the miracle of canning . You could ask the same question about Mayonnaise–Why do you have to refrigerate a jar of Mayonnaise, but they can have little packets of mayonnaise sitting out on the counter at the fast food restaurant?

The idea behind canning is to put something in a sealed container and then heat it. By heating to a high enough temperature, it kills any bacteria inside the container. The bacteria are the thing cause spoilage, so without any bacteria, the food lasts a long time inside the can without spoiling.

So the cream in the little single-serving containers has been sealed abd heated to kill off the bacteria. If you were to open the container (letting in bacteria) but not use it immediately, you would have to then refrigerate it. But you do use it immediately, so no refrigeration is necessary. A larger container of half-and-half needs constant refrigeration because it has never been sealed and heated to completely kill all the bacteria (because that affects taste, and many people use the larger containers of half-and-half for cooking, where taste matters).

One other thing. If you look at the label of one of these creamers, it might have ingredients like this: Milk, cream, sodium citrate and disodium phosphate. According to this page ,“Sodium citrate is used in ice cream to keep the fat globules from sticking together.”It would serve the same purpose in half-and-half, which contains a lot of fat from the cream. This page indicates that disodium phosphate,“stops cream from separating in hot liquids”.
