Few attend discussion of execution methods

By TRAVIS LOLLER, Associated Press

NASHVILLE - Despite a sparse turnout at a public hearing Thursday, state
Department of Correction officials say they are on track to present revised
execution procedures by a May 2 deadline.

Only four people spoke at the hearing seeking ideas on topics like changing
the state&apos;s lethal injection drug formula and testing of the electric chair.
None addressed the topic at hand.

Two speakers questioned the morality of the death penalty while attorney
Michael Passino and assistant federal public defender Kelley Henry, both
defenders of death row inmates, questioned the possibility of developing
good protocols for lethal injection and electrocution by the deadline.

Gov. Phil Bredesen temporarily halted all executions in February after a
death-row inmate sued the state over its execution procedures in federal
court in Nashville, giving the department 90 days to develop new protocols
for both lethal injection and electrocution.

Henry told the commission charged with the task, &quot;The reality is that 90
days is an unrealistic timeframe to fix what was broken.&quot;

Passino said the process &quot;must include medical expertise, although I
understand the problems you bump into.&quot;

The American Medical Association&apos;s code of medical ethics does not allow its
members to participate in executions.

In Florida, a special commission studying lethal injection wrote in a final
report that its ability to gather information was limited because &quot;medical
personnel are prohibited from participating in executions and rendering
technical advice.&quot;

It is unknown if the Tennessee commission has had similar problems.
Correction Commissioner George Little, speaking after the hearing, would not
comment on whom the commission has spoken to.

He said the group would produce a &quot;product adequate to the task laid out.&quot;

An Associated Press review earlier this year of the state&apos;s 100-page &quot;Manual
of Execution&quot; revealed a cut-and-paste jumble of conflicting instructions
that mixes new lethal injection instructions with those for the old electric
chair.

Full exam of death penalty pushed

By Brian Lazenby, Chattanooga Times Free Press

As corrections authorities evaluate the procedures for taking a condemned
inmate&apos;s life in Tennessee, a Democratic state lawmaker is seeking a
top-to-bottom review of the death penalty.

State Sen. Doug Jackson&apos;s bill calling for a committee to review how and
when the death penalty should be applied is set for discussion Tuesday in
the Senate Judiciary Committee.

&quot;I&apos;m very much a supporter of the death penalty, but I don&apos;t support a death
penalty where innocent people are executed,&quot; the Dickson, Tenn., legislator
said. &quot;This bill attempts to do the responsible thing by making sure it is a
guilty person that is on death row and not someone who is innocent.&quot;

Hamilton County District Attorney Bill Cox said he supports both the
legislation and Gov. Phil Bredesen&apos;s 90-day moratorium on executions to
update protocols.

&quot;Death penalty cases generally and historically receive the greatest
scrutiny, and that&apos;s the way it should be,&quot; Mr. Cox said. &quot;Once the courts
have scrutinized these cases and have determined absolute guilt and
determined that the proper procedures were followed, there should be no more
lengthy delay.&quot;

Gov. Bredesen called for the moratorium and review of the state&apos;s methods of
imposing the death penalty after lawyers questioned procedures during the
appeal of Edward Jerome Harbison, who was convicted of first-degree murder
in 1983 in the bludgeoning death of St. Elmo resident Edith Russell.

Mr. Harbison was scheduled to be executed Feb. 22, but his attorneys contend
Tennessee&apos;s protocols for death by lethal injection are unconstitutionally
inhumane.

His lawyers said the state&apos;s death penalty protocol does not specify
training requirements for those who administer lethal injections and does
not state quantities of the drugs to be used.

An Associated Press review earlier this year of the state&apos;s &quot;Manual of
Execution&quot; revealed a cut-and-paste jumble of conflicting instructions that
mixes new lethal injection instructions with those for the no-longerused
electric chair.

Lydia Lenker, spokeswoman for Gov. Bredesen, said he asked Department of
Correction Commissioner George Little to update the execution protocols.

The department has until May 2 to complete its update of the 200-page
manual, Ms. Lenker said.

Department spokeswoman Dorinda Carter said she doesn&apos;t foresee any problems
meeting the deadline.

Philip Ray Workman, now on death row, is scheduled to be executed May 9 for
the 1981 murder of Memphis police Lt. Ronald Oliver.

Sen. Jackson said his bill attempts to ensure that the death penalty is
applied fairly.

According to the bill, new methods and technology, such as the use of DNA
testing, make it necessary to review the entire process.

Sen. Jackson said a bill went into effect in 2001 that allowed DNA testing
for death row inmates even though they may have exhausted all their appeals.

Sharon Curtis-Flair, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Robert E. Cooper
Jr., said DNA testing has been applied to several death penalty cases in
Tennessee, but it never has resulted in a reversal of guilt in such a case.

However, DNA testing in 2004 resulted in a Memphis man&apos;s being freed after
22 years in prison for a rape he did not commit.

Steve Kissinger of Federal Defender Services in Knoxville represents death
row inmate Paul House, who was convicted of raping and killing his neighbor,
Carolyn Muncey, more than 20 years ago.

Mr. Kissinger said testing showed that DNA used as evidence against Mr.
House at his trial was not the defendant&apos;s.

Mr. House remains on death row because prosecutors claim the new finding
doesn&apos;t prove that he is not responsible for Ms. Muncey&apos;s death.

&quot;They&apos;ve made it clear that DNA evidence doesn&apos;t open the door to relitigate
the case,&quot; Mr. Kissinger said.

Ms. Curtis-Flair said that, although death row inmates have the right to
petition to use DNA testing in their cases, it is up to the courts to
determine if it will be allowed.

REVIEW TIMELINE

Jan. 24 for Lawyers Edward Jerome Harbison question the execution methods
used in Tennessee.

Feb. 1 Bredesen Gov. issues a 90-day moratorium on executions and calls for
Corrections Commissioner George Little to review and update execution
protocol manual.

May 2 to Deadline have execution protocol manual updated.

TN: Judge delays Workman execution

Judge delays Workman execution
Defense says method still has a constitutional flaw

By TIM GHIANNI
Staff Writer

The state’s plans to execute convicted cop killer Philip Workman on
Wednesday stalled Friday when a federal judge agreed that the state’s
new execution guidelines could conflict with the constitutional ban
on cruel and unusual punishment.

In issuing a temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Todd J.
Campbell said more time is needed to examine the defense claims that
“the new execution protocol exposes (Workman) to a foreseeable and
likely unnecessary risk” of pain and suffering prohibited by the U.S.
Constitution.

Those were the arguments earlier in the day when Kelley Henry, a
federal public defender representing Workman, said the new execution
procedure was worse than the flawed older method.

The state will “review the judge’s opinion and then decide whether to
appeal,” said Sharon Curtis-Flair, spokeswoman for the Attorney
General’s Office.

The state’s options would be to ask the court to reconsider the order
or to appeal to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.

Barring those moves, the execution will be put off until at least May
14, when Campbell will hold an 8 a.m. hearing.

Workman, 53, was scheduled to be the first state inmate to die under
new state guidelines that use a three-drug combination for lethal
injection.

In an interview with The Tennessean this week on death row, Workman
said “You wouldn’t use (the drug combination) to kill a dog. You
can’t move if you’re in pain. You can’t bat your eyelashes.”

Workman admits his part in a 1981 hold-up at a Memphis fast-food
restaurant, but he denies firing the bullet that killed Memphis
police Lt. Ronald Oliver during a subsequent shootout.

He had been scheduled to be moved to death watch Sunday but will
remain on death row. The appeals court could vacate the judge’s
order, which would put the execution back on for Wednesday.

Tennessean reporter Sheila Burke and the Associated Press contributed

Workman Moved To Death Watch Status
Execution Set For Wednesday

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A little more than a week after revising its execution procedure manual, the state of Tennessee is scheduled to execute a Memphis man by injection.

Video: Philip Workman Says He&apos;s Ready For Execution

Philip Workman, convicted for the 1981 shooting death of a Memphis police officer, is scheduled to die Wednesday at 1 a.m. CDT. It would be only the state&apos;s third execution in 47 years.


Workman&apos;s execution was halted last week over concerns about the revised execution method, but a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted that temporary restraining order Monday.

In a 2-1 opinion, Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton wrote that Workman has never before challenged the state&apos;s three-drug lethal injection procedure.

Workman&apos;s lawyers claimed Tennessee&apos;s new death penalty guidelines unveiled last week could cause unconstitutional pain and suffering, but similar arguments have failed in the higher courts, Sutton wrote.

&quot;The Supreme Court has never invalidated a state&apos;s chosen method of execution. No court has invalidated the three-drug protocol used by Tennessee (and 28 other jurisdictions),&quot; Sutton wrote.

Workman&apos;s attorneys planned to appeal and ask for a hearing by the full court Tuesday. &quot;We will continue to fight,&quot; federal public defender Kelley Henry said.

Gov. Phil Bredesen imposed a 90-day moratorium on the death penalty ending May 2 to give the state time to fix the procedure manual. An Associated Press review found the manual was a jumble of conflicting instructions that mixed lethal injection instructions with those for the old electric chair.

Some legal experts say the new guidelines still need more scrutiny.

Richard Dieter, executive director at the Death Penalty Information Center, a group that researches the death penalty but does not take a position on it, says the revisions don&apos;t address concerns over lethal injection that other states are debating.

&quot;There&apos;s real concerns over the drugs, dosages, the presence of doctors during lethal injection,&quot; Dieter said. &quot;It seems what Tennessee did was fix their older protocols which hadn&apos;t been well-written or thought out ... but did not review the major questions like, are the anesthetics working? Are the drugs causing unnecessary pain? Should a doctor be there to monitor whether the person is under anesthetic?&quot;

Besides Tennessee, executions have been halted in 10 other states so procedures could be reevaluated: Florida, California, Missouri, New Jersey, Arkansas, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina and South Dakota and Ohio.

Tennessee executed Sedley Alley last June and Robert Glen Coe in 2000 -- both by lethal injection. The last previous execution was by electrocution in 1960.

Brad MacLean, a Nashville attorney representing another condemned Tennessee inmate, said the three-chemical injection sometimes fails to work and can cause the paralyzed inmates to suffocate and feel pain.

At least 30 states use the three-drug injection: thiopental, an anesthetic; pancuronium bromide, a nerve blocker and muscle paralyzer; and potassium chloride, a drug to stop the heart.

&quot;The fact that they&apos;re continuing to use a protocol, a three-chemical cocktail that&apos;s been criticized throughout the county, just illustrates the state is not willing to take a serious look at the problems,&quot; he said.

Workman, 53, was robbing a Wendy&apos;s restaurant and got into a gun battle with police. He wounded one officer and shot at a second, but he contends another officer&apos;s bullet accidentally killed police Lt. Ronald Oliver.

Last week a three-member 6th Circuit panel also denied Workman a stay of execution based on separate claims that he was convicted on perjured testimony and that the state withheld evidence that would have established Workman&apos;s innocence.

Workman told The Tennessean newspaper that the state&apos;s new execution procedures would do little to ensure his death is not painful and inhumane.

&quot;It didn&apos;t fix anything,&quot; Philip Workman said in an interview at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville. &quot;You can&apos;t move if you&apos;re in pain. You can&apos;t bat your eyelashes. You can&apos;t do anything.&quot;

Workman&apos;s execution has been delayed on five prior occasions -- twice by stays granted by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2000 and 2001, once by a stay granted by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 2001, once by executive reprieve in 2003 and once by the federal district court in 2004.

Terry Workman, Philip Workman&apos;s brother, said he believes the state is intent on putting his brother to death this time.

&quot;It would be kind of like standing in front of someone with a loaded weapon and you&apos;re wondering if they&apos;re going to shoot you,&quot; he said.

&quot;If the 6th Circuit doesn&apos;t help him this time, the state is going to execute him. They want to be done with him. It doesn&apos;t matter if we have all this evidence. The way the state looks at it is, it was a police officer who was killed and he (Workman) caused the situation to occur. They don&apos;t really care whose bullet it was.&quot;

1:40 a.m.: Anxious public awaits word of execution
Philip Workman was scheduled to die by lethal injection at 1 a.m.

BRAD SCHRADE, SHEILA WISSNER and SHEILA BURKE
Staff Writers

Witnesses were still inside the Death Row area at Riverbend Maximum
Security Institution as of 1:40 a.m., with no word about the outcome
of the scheduled execution of Philip Workman.

Prison rules held that witnesses, including a reporter from the
Tennessean, would not be allowed to take cell phones inside and would
not be allowed to communicate until after the execution was completed.

Tennessee&apos;s highest court denied a last-ditch appeal to derail the
execution of Philip Workman.

Two hours before his death sentence was to be carried out, Workman,
53, asked the state&apos;s highest court to delay his execution.

In a last ditch filing, Workman&apos;s lawyers argued that the inmate&apos;s
execution date, coming just over a week after the state issued new
death penalty protocols, denied the convicted cop killer sufficient
time to challenge the process.

&quot;There is a growing body of medical, scientific, and other evidence
which clearly shows that lethal injection using (the proscribed
combination of drugs) without monitoring of anesthetic depth risks
torture,&quot; his lawyers wrote.

But in an unsigned ruling issued just after 12:30 a.m., the state
Supreme Court found that &quot;Workman’s challenge to the revised protocol
has no likelihood of success on the merits.&quot;

&quot;At some point, the State has a right to impose a sentence not just
because the State’s interests in finality are compelling, but also
because there is a &quot;powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the
guilty...,&quot; the ruling states. &quot;After twenty-five years and countless
court proceedings, that time has come.&quot;

Workman&apos;s lawyers have worked furiously to delay his 1 a.m. execution
at Riverbend Maximum Security Insitution in Nashville.

Earlier in the day, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to grant Workman a
stay of execution. His lawyers turned to the nation’s highest court
after requests for a delay were rejected by the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.

U.S. District Judge Todd Campbell had issued a temporary restraining
order until he could hear testimony on the new lethal injection
protocol the state planned to use in Workman’s execution. But the
circuit court overturned that ruling Monday saying the method is used
successfully in other states.

Workman was condemned to die for the 1981 death of Memphis Police Lt.
Ronald Oliver during a robbery at a fast-food restaurant. Oliver was
hit during a shootout, but Workman has long contended that the shot
that felled the officer likely came from a fellow officer’s gun.

As the day wore on yesterday, Workman asked the U.S. District Court
in Nashville to release his body to his brother immediately after his
death and not allow an autopsy to be performed. Judge Campbell later
issued a temporary injunction ordering the state not to autopsy
Workman’s body at least until a hearing can be held on May 14.

Workman met with family, friends and a spiritual advisor yesterday,
said Dorinda Carter, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of
Correction.

The prisoner asked that a vegetarian pizza be purchased and donated
for his last meal, but prison officials refused.

“He instructed that it be given to a homeless person but we’re not
able to do that,&quot; Carter said.

Instead, Workman decided to skip dinner on the eve of his execution.

&quot;He could have had food from the cafeteria that the other inmates
were having tonight,&quot; she said.

Outside the prison, about 60 anti-death penalty protestors gathered
for a vigil. Some of the protestors said they were losing hope that
his life would be spared.

&quot;My spirit has hope but my worldly mind says there&apos;s not much hope,&quot;
said Alonzo Fortune, a Nashville man who opposes the death penalty.

The group was singing and holding hands in a circle while standing in
a fenced-off grass field. Inside the prison, Workman is on death
watch, just feet away from the death chamber where executioners are
scheduled to inject lethal chemicals into his body.

&quot;I wish our governor would wake up and realize that it just doesn&apos;t
work,&quot; said Jay Gilchrist, a lay minister in Nashville. &quot;The death
penalty doesn&apos;t deter crime. It doesn&apos;t save taxpayer money. That&apos;s
for sure. And it&apos;s not a civilized thing to do.&quot;

Workman joins Robert Glen Coe (executed in April 2000) and Sedley
Alley (executed in June 2006) as only the third person executed by
the state of Tennessee since 1960.

The state&apos;s last execution before that period was four decades
earlier in 1960.

Donors Fulfill Workman&apos;s Final Meal Request

News Channel 5

NASHVILLE, Tenn.- Philip Workman, who was executed Wednesday morning,
requested that a vegetarian pizza be donated to a homeless person.

Prison officials could not fulfill that request but anonymous donors ordered
pizzas for people at the Nashville Rescue Mission. The pizzas were delivered
Wednesday night at the nonprofit organization, which is located outside
downtown Nashville.

Workman died by lethal injection. He was pronounced dead at 1:38 a.m.

By death row protocol, an inmate can request a last meal within reason.

&quot;We are not in a position to do that, but if he chooses to have a meal
tonight, he can eat in the cafeteria with the other inmates,&quot; Tennessee
Department of Correction Spokeswoman Dorinda Carter said Tuesday.

Although most diners at the mission did not know about Workman&apos;s wish, those
who found out seemed surprised even inspired.

&quot;It says we can be forgiven,&quot; said one man in the kitchen, where there were
stacks of pizza boxes. &quot;Look at what he&apos;s doing for us.&quot;

Prison officials said they were focused on execution protocol Tuesday night
and Wednesday morning and so delivering a pizza was not a priority.

However, Riverbend Maximum Security Institution did receive several phone
calls Wednesday from people asking what they could do. The prison referred
them to the Nashville Rescue Mission.

Workman received the death sentence for killing Memphis Police Lt. Ronald
Oliver in 1981.

No redeeming value in Workman execution

The Tennessean, Editorial

This state did not accomplish much with the execution of convicted killer
Philip Workman Wednesday morning.

It would be nice to say that the execution at least served as a deterrent to
other killing. But it doesn&apos;t.

It would be nice to say that it solved some of the ills of society, like the
shootout with police Workman was involved in when he robbed a Wendy&apos;s
restaurant in 1981 in Memphis. But it&apos;s difficult to believe anyone truly
thinks this week&apos;s execution is a remedy for crime in Tennessee.

It would be especially nice to at least be able to say that Workman&apos;s death
brought closure to the family of Memphis police Lt. Ronald Oliver, who was
shot and killed that day. But a victims&apos; rights representative who spoke for
the family at the execution said, &quot;Though a sentence has finally been
carried out, nothing will happen that will ever provide them closure.&quot; The
state cannot even rationalize its action with claims that an execution
somehow settles a score.

So what exactly did the state accomplish, other than to appeal to those who
somehow see redeeming value in answering one death with another? The fact is
that, try though this state and others might, there is not likely to ever be
a death penalty that serves as a solution to murder.

In Workman&apos;s case, there was not even certainty that his gun actually killed
Oliver. It is agreed that Workman was certainly there, that he robbed and
engaged in battle with police. Speculation has been that &quot;friendly fire,&quot; a
bullet from another police officer, may have killed the officer. But for
some people thirsty for an execution, details about the event were deemed
irrelevant. A police officer was killed, Workman was involved; that was
enough, it seems.

But the state has broader reasons to doubt this renewed path of executions.
Although the state had gone since 1960 without executing a prisoner until
Robert Glen Coe was put to death in April 2000, followed by Sedley Alley,
who was executed in June last year, executions in Tennessee have now become
more common. And as each additional execution tends to diminish the enormity
of such state action, the serious questions seem to fade along with the
gravity of the act. Ironically, executions are becoming more routine, while
reasons not to conduct them grow.

Death-penalty proponents do not seem too concerned with scientific evidence
affecting capital cases in other ways. The world knows DNA evidence can
exonerate certain inmates of crimes for which they&apos;ve been convicted. That
alone shows government can sometimes get things wrong.

In Workman&apos;s case, as with several others throughout the country, serious
questions have emerged over lethal injection. The system uses a combination
of three drugs to put the inmate to death, in a way meant to be more humane
than some cruder methods used in the past.

Knowledgeable people have said the protocol only masks the suffering of the
inmate and that the inmate does suffer, despite appearances. Doesn&apos;t seem to
matter though. It looks better, therefore it must be all right, some
believe. Whom is the system kidding?

This state still rightly mourns the death of Lt. Ronald Oliver. That&apos;s ample
reason to compel the state to seek substantive, truly effective ways to see
that such awful events do not happen again. Sadly, the state has not found
that answer. Not with this act, not in this week, not with the concoction
that is only the latest flawed attempt that solves nothing.

Truth needed in execution questions
Court needs to allow method of discovery



Philip Workman didn&apos;t make it easy for the state to evaluate whether his execution by injection was painful or otherwise inhumane. Before he died, the convicted cop killer stipulated that his body not be autopsied because it would violate his religious beliefs.

Workman was the first Tennessean put to death under a new lethal injection process. By measuring the level of drugs in body fluids, it could be determined whether the condemned was unconscious while the execution was taking place and would be unable to feel pain.


In fact, Florida declared a moratorium on lethal injection executions after a medical examiner found in an autopsy that the injection needle had been stuck through the condemned man&apos;s vein. It took him twice as long to die as a result.

Meanwhile, Workman&apos;s body is sealed in a body bag at least until a federal court takes up the matter next week.

Although some people may say that a criminal sentenced to death for a heinous crime ought to die as slowly and as painfully as possible, the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits &quot;cruel and unusual punishments.&quot;

As it is, states such as Tennessee already have to face numerous legal battles to get a convicted person to the death chamber â€” Workman himself was on Death Row for a quarter century. They don&apos;t need the added burden of having their entire execution method declared unconstitutional.

As far as Workman&apos;s specific case is concerned, his wish for his body to not be defiled will be weighed against the state&apos;s interest in determining what his final moments of life were like. At the least, the courts should allow the extraction of blood and other bodily fluids in a minimally invasive procedure.

Tennessee Should Broaden Temporary Halt on Executions to Review Every Aspect
of Death Penalty System

Team of Tennessee Legal Experts Lists Many Problems in State Capital Crime
System


NASHVILLE - A team of Tennessee legal experts, working under the auspices of
the American Bar Association Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation
Project, today cited problems in the state&apos;s use of capital punishment that
range from excessive caseloads and inadequate standards for defense counsel
to racial disparities and inadequate review of death row inmates&apos; claims of
actual innocence.

The team concluded that Tennessee&apos;s death penalty system is so flawed that a
temporary halt in executions should be continued to permit a thorough review
of every aspect of capital punishment administration in the state. It urged
Gov. Phil Bredesen to continue past May 2 a stay he initially imposed on
Tennessee executions to examine protocols for administering lethal
injection, the execution method used in the state.

&quot;Gov. Bredesen clearly has given sober consideration to how executions are
carried out in Tennessee,&quot; said American Bar Association President Karen J.
Mathis. &quot;Now it is time for him, and for the state as a whole, to devote
even more thorough analysis to how the state reaches the decision to
sentence someone to death. The families and friends of capital crime
victims in Tennessee, the people accused of committing those crimes, and the
citizens who place their trust in their legal system deserve better justice
than they are now receiving,&quot; she said.

The ABA neither supports nor opposes either the death penalty or any
particular means of carrying out executions, but it does urge a moratorium
on executions in each jurisdiction until fairness and due process are
assured in death penalty cases. The Tennessee report has not been presented
to the ABA&apos;s policy-making arm, the House of Delegates, and so does not
constitute association policy.

The recommendation to continue a temporary halt in executions in Tennessee
is the product of a three-year study by a team of seven prominent state
lawyers. Evaluating state systems against ABA protocols for a fair and
accurate capital case system that complies with constitutional standards,
the team found Tennessee meets only seven of the standards, partially meets
31 of them, and fails to comply with 26 of them. The team was unable to
access adequate information to assess Tennessee&apos;s compliance with 29 of the
protocols.

The Tennessee Death Penalty Assessment Team included a former prosecutor, a
federal judge, defense lawyers and lawyers in private practice. Dwight L.
Aarons, chair, is an associate professor of law at the University of
Tennessee College of Law, teaching courses on criminal law, advanced
criminal law and the death penalty.

The team issued 14 specific recommendations, in addition to urging
continuation of the moratorium to broaden review of the state system. They
are:

- Create an independent commission to review claims of factual innocence,
with power to investigate, hold

- Create an independent statewide authority to appoint, train and monitor
defense, appellate and post-conviction lawyers in capital cases

- Require preservation and storage of all biological evidence in capital
cases as long as defendant remains incarcerated

- Develop statewide protocols to standardize decisions about which cases are
charged as capital crimes

- Increase qualification standards and monitoring procedures for defense,
appellate and post-conviction lawyers in capital cases

- Provide a right to post-conviction counsel before, not after, filing of
post conviction petitions

- Amend court rules to allow defendants to obtain expert and investigative
services at any time after being charged, providing an opportunity to
demonstrate why a capital charge may be inappropriate

- Include in proportionality review cases in which the death penalty could
have been sought but was not, and cases in which the penalty was sought but
not imposed

- Require judges presiding over trials resulting in first degree murder
convictions to file complete proportionality reports

- Assure each death row inmate an opportunity for a hearing before the Board
of Pardon and Parole

- Redraft capital jury instructions to prevent misunderstandings
Sponsor a state study to determine if there are disparities in capital
sentencing based on race, socio-economic status, geography or other factors

- Exclude from eligibility for execution people with serious mental
disorders

- Adopt a uniform state standard to determine defendants&apos; competency through
trial, appeals and post-conviction proceedings.

The full report and an executive summary, including charts that identify
specific recommendations and state compliance levels, are available on the
ABA&apos;s Web site at http://www.abavideonews.org/ABA340 . Additional information
about the Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project and the assessment
project is also posted there.

Tennessee is the sixth of eight states being assessed under the ABA project,
which developed the protocols in 2001. Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Arizona
and Indiana preceded Tennessee. Other assessments are being conducted in
Ohio and Pennsylvania. Neither the protocols nor the individual state
assessment reports have been adopted by the ABA House of Delegates.

With more than 413,000 members, the American Bar Association is the largest
voluntary professional membership organization in the world. As the
national voice of the legal profession, the ABA works to improve the
administration of justice, promotes programs that assist lawyers and judges
in their work, accredits law schools, provides continuing legal education,
and works to build public understanding around the world of the importance
of the rule of law in a democratic society.

Judge rules for paper seeking draft of execution procedures

NASHVILLE, Tenn. A judge in Nashville today ruled in favor of a
weekly newspaper suing the Bredesen administration for not handing
over draft copies and other documents used in revising the state&apos;s
procedure manual for executions.

The Nashville Scene asked for a draft of the manual, which Bredesen
ordered to be revised in February. But state officials declined to
turn it over because they said it wasn&apos;t completely rewritten and is
privileged information.

Davidson County Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman said the state did not
meet the burden of privileged information and the public interest to
know outweighed the state&apos;s interest not to disclose.

Running out of Time

The governor refuses to extend the moratorium on the death penalty, despite evidence suggesting the system is flawed. Meanwhile, the execution of Philip Workman approaches.

by Sarah Kelley

A 90-day ban on the death penalty in Tennessee expires one week before Philip Ray Workman is set to die by lethal injection, the first scheduled execution since the governor established a commission to overhaul the state’s capital punishment protocols. And although critics, including the American Bar Association, are skeptical any substantial changes can be made in a mere 90 days, the governor appears steadfast in moving ahead as scheduled.

Gov. Phil Bredesen stands by his May 2 deadline ending the ban, as well as Workman’s scheduled execution a week later: “The governor has received the report issued by the ABA, and while he has great respect for the organization, he has no plans to extend the moratorium,” Lydia Lenker, the governor’s spokeswoman, writes in an e-mail to the Scene.

After spending three years examining Tennessee’s death penalty, a team of legal experts organized by the ABA asked Bredesen Monday to extend the moratorium to allow for a more thorough review. The team, made up of prominent defense lawyers, prosecutors, a law professor and even a federal judge, concludes the state’s capital punishment system is riddled with flaws, including insufficient procedures for reviewing innocence claims, racial disparities, inadequate standards for defense counsel and excessive caseloads.

In pushing the governor to continue the moratorium, the group made clear the ABA has no stance on the death penalty and is interested solely in improving the state’s capital justice system. A state House subcommittee followed suit on Tuesday by unanimously proposing bipartisan legislation that would create a new commission to further study the death penalty system in Tennessee. Despite these concerns, the governor still plans instead to defer to a commission that spent three months—as opposed to three years—reviewing the state’s procedures for administering lethal injections and electrocutions.


Nashville defense lawyer Michael Passino says he’s troubled by the state’s resolve to meet a seemingly arbitrary deadline, and to execute Workman so soon after the moratorium ends. “It looks like it could be more of a rush to get things done without reference to how thoughtful the study was and how ably and comprehensive the remedies, if any, have been implemented,” adds Passino, who has represented defendants facing the death penalty for 17 years.

With what appears to be a firm deadline in place, Workman’s lawyers can do little to prepare for a potential court appeal, given that the commission’s work thus far has been withheld from the public.

“We are going to be in a position where we’re going to have to very, very quickly review these new protocols and make a determination whether there are any potential legal challenges,” says Kelley Henry, an assistant federal public defender representing Workman. Despite numerous attempts to obtain information about the process, Henry has been stonewalled repeatedly and has no idea what changes the commission might be considering.

With the exception of one poorly publicized and sparsely attended hearing, the commission’s work has been shrouded in secrecy. Consequently, this newspaper recently filed a petition seeking access to public records associated with the development of new execution protocols in Tennessee. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Wednesday before Davidson County Chancellor Claudia Bonnyman.

When Bredesen imposed the death penalty moratorium in February, the executions of four other prisoners scheduled to die during that 90-day period were postponed. Going ahead with Workman’s execution, which just happens to fall one week after the ban expires, is both arbitrary and unfair, according to Henry, who suggests the dates of the moratorium might even have been chosen with her client in mind.

“They obviously were aware of his execution date at the time this moratorium was set,” Henry says. “The governor elected to end his moratorium a week before Workman’s execution date. It really feels like he was singled out.”

But Tennessee Attorney General Robert Cooper argues in court papers filed last month that there’s nothing unjust about refusing to delay the execution of Workman, whom he points out has had six execution dates since 2000. Cooper goes on to say: “The expectation … is that a revised death penalty protocol that is both constitutional and appropriate will have been established by May 2, 2007. In other words, by May 9, 2007, when Workman’s death sentence is scheduled to be executed, it is expected that his sentence will be carried out pursuant to a constitutional and appropriate protocol.”

The Tennessee Supreme Court has since sided with the state on the matter and, without further explanation, denied Workman’s request to delay his execution.

“He has been on deathwatch three times, and now he is staring down his fourth trip down there,” says Henry, suggesting such treatment is cruel and unusual punishment.

If plans to execute Workman proceed as scheduled, he will for the fourth time wind up on “deathwatch,” the term given to the 72-hour period leading up to an inmate’s execution. While on deathwatch the prisoner is closely monitored by a team of guards standing outside an 8-by-10 concrete cell adjacent to the death chamber. A tiny window overlooking the prison’s exercise yard provides a limited and perhaps final glimpse of the outside world. Only a few items, such as legal documents and a Bible, are made available to the inmate.

On one occasion, Workman was receiving last communion when his execution was called off just 43 minutes before he was set to die by lethal injection. This time, Henry anticipates it might once again go down to the wire: “We probably won’t know if we have a stay until the last minute.”

Given the governor’s refusal to extend the moratorium or postpone Workman’s lethal injection, Henry is seeking a stay of execution in federal court. Workman’s legal team currently is awaiting the outcome of several appeals.

Workman was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for his role in the 1981 robbery of a Wendy’s restaurant during which Memphis Police Officer Ronald Oliver was shot and killed. Oliver and two other officers responded to a silent alarm tripped by an employee and found Workman exiting the restaurant with a bag of cash. A shootout ensued and Oliver was fatally wounded.

Although Workman—a junkie at the time who frequently stole for drug money—never denied the robbery, he maintains he did not shoot the officer. Years after his conviction and death sentence, an alleged witness who claimed to have seen Workman fire the fatal shot recanted his testimony and admitted he lied. Additional evidence has surfaced suggesting a fellow officer accidentally shot Oliver. (Astonishingly, Workman’s defense failed to pursue any ballistics testing prior to trial.) Then there’s the exculpatory evidence that Workman’s lawyers claim the prosecution intentionally withheld from the defense at trial.At the time of Workman’s conviction, state law would not have permitted a death sentence if he did not fire the fatal bullet.

 Tennessee death row inmate Workman appeals for stay of execution
May 1, 2007

By ROSE FRENCH
Associated Press Writer

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Attorneys for convicted death row inmate
Phillip Workman asked a federal appeals court on Tuesday to stay his
execution set for next Wednesday.

His defense team is also reviewing revised execution rules released
by the state on Monday to decide whether they should be challenged in
court, said Kelley Henry, a federal public defender representing
Workman.

Workman, 53, has two appeals pending before the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. His lawyers requested the stay of execution
claiming he was convicted on perjured testimony and that the state
withheld evidence that would have established Workman&apos;s innocence,
Henry said.

Workman, who was convicted for the 1981 shooting death of Memphis
Police Lt. Ronald Oliver, robbed a Wendy&apos;s restaurant and then got
into a gun battle with police. He wounded another officer and shot at
a third, but he contends friendly fire wounded Oliver.

Sharon Curtis-Flair, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general&apos;s
office, said the office was reviewing the request for a stay &quot;and
will respond in due course.&quot;

The only witness at Workman&apos;s trial to testify that he saw Workman
shoot the police officer was Harold Davis, who later recanted his
testimony. Davis said he didn&apos;t really see the shooting, and that he
had been coached on what to say and coerced into saying it by Memphis
police.

A retired Memphis police officer who was in jail for providing bogus
driving certificates to illegal immigrants claimed last year that
fellow officers covered up details proving that another officer did
fire the fatal bullet.

One of the appeals pending before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals questions whether the state withheld evidence that would
prove Workman did not kill Oliver.

The Tennessee Supreme Court set a May 9 execution date for Workman in
January, marking the third time the state has scheduled his lethal
injection.

But in February, Gov. Phil Bredesen issued a moratorium on executions
until May 2 to rework the state&apos;s outdated and ambiguous procedures
for lethal injection.

An Associated Press review found the state&apos;s most recent procedure
manual for executing prisoners had conflicting instructions that
mixed lethal injection instructions with those for the old electric
chair. Bredesen called the document a &quot;cut-and-paste job&quot; that needed
significant revision.

In March, the Tennessee Supreme Court rejected a motion from Workman
seeking to stop his lethal injection, set for one week after the
governor&apos;s moratorium was due to expire.

While four other death row inmates were given reprieves by the
governor, Workman argued that his execution remained because of the
&quot;fortuity of timing involved in the Governor&apos;s order.&quot;

The state argued that Workman&apos;s execution would still be
constitutionally appropriate under the new lethal injection
procedures and that the court could rule later if the changes
warranted a stay of execution.

On Monday, Tennessee released its revised rules for executions, which
lays out in greater detail the process of administering lethal
injection. The manual makes no changes to the way prisoners are
electrocuted.

Workman, who has no pending appeals at the state level, has seen
numerous stays and twice been within hours of execution when courts
stepped in to spare his life.

In a recent interview with WMC-TV in Memphis, Workman said the stress
of preparing to die has been worse than death.

&quot;It&apos;s an ever-looming feeling of &apos;Are they going to get you this
time?&quot;&apos; Workman told the television station. &quot;It seems like at times
it would be better off in the grave because I&apos;m tired.&quot;

In 2003, Bredesen issued a temporary reprieve to Workman because his
lawyers raised doubts about the testimony on the bullet that killed
the officer. The former Memphis medical examiner who testified the
fatal slug came from Workman&apos;s .45-caliber pistol later faced
criminal charges for lying in an unrelated case about being attacked
outside his office.

A later independent investigation by state medical examiner Bruce
Levy concluded that &quot;to a reasonable degree of medical certainty ...
Lt. Ronald Oliver was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest
fired by Philip Workman.&quot;

Workman&apos;s attorneys have contested that conclusion.

The latest delay came in September 2004, when a U.S. District Court
judge stayed Workman&apos;s execution pending resolution of a federal
appeals court review of another Tennessee murder case with similar
legal issues to his. When that motion was denied late last year, the
state asked the court to set a new execution date.

Judge stays convict&apos;s execution

By ERIC SNYDER
The Leaf-Chronicle

A stay of execution has been issued for William Glenn Rogers.

Rogers was convicted in January 2000 of kidnapping, raping and
murdering 9-year-old Jackie Beard.

The order was signed by Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge John
Gasaway Tuesday to give the courts more time to hear a petition for
post-conviction relief filed by Rogers.

The Tennessee Office of the Post-Conviction Defender&apos;s Office, which
had been appointed to handle Rogers&apos; petition, was recused in mid-
April because of a conflict of interest. Replacement counsel for
Rogers, who is now 45, has not been appointed.

Rogers, in Nashville&apos;s Riverbend Maximum Security Institution, was
set for execution May 23.

Inmate has a choice

Because Beard was murdered in 1996, before the state standardized
executions in 1999, Rogers will have the option of dying from
injection or electrocution.

Tennessee Department of Corrections spokeswoman Dorinda Carter said
Rogers has not made his selection.

Assistant District Attorney Dan Brollier said he was not surprised by
the stay.

&quot;This is not unusual,&quot; Brollier said. &quot;(Rogers is) now getting it
ready to move into the federal side of the appeal.&quot;

The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld Rogers&apos; conviction and sentence in
June 2006.

&quot;Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state,&quot;
wrote Justice Janice Holder, &quot;we conclude that the proof points the
finger of guilt unerringly at Rogers and Rogers alone.&quot;

I SAY: Priorities and fairness must be addressed at DA&apos;s office

By Michael R. Moser, Crossville Chronicle

Since the debacle that has swirled around the 13th Judicial District
Attorney&apos;s Office last fall, the chief prosecutor for seven Upper Cumberland
counties has been off the job with pay.

That is not to be begrudged. William &quot;Bill&quot; Gibson has served the district
and in better days served the district well. When first elected, he brought
about changes that made the prosecutor&apos;s office better than when he found
it.

With that said, Bill Gibson is the author of his own fate and really has no
one to blame but himself. What happened should have never happened and many
are like me, wondering, how could it?

Gibson has claimed blame. He has admitted his faults and shortcomings and he
has taken appropriate steps to make himself a better person. Despite that, I
believe he will never be able to function as District Attorney General.

I doubt seriously he is even electable as things stand.

We will never know what caused a man in Gibson&apos;s position to take up the
cause of a confessed killer Christopher Adams who brutally murdered an
elderly woman in a home invasion, just to steal a couple of bucks for drug
money.

So often I have wondered, &quot;If Bill Gibson was representing the best interest
of Christopher Adams, then who was representing us?&quot;

The letters Adams and Gibson exchanged have been published and rehashed
since they became publicly known. They speak for themselves.

Ethical questions abound concerning Gibson corresponding with a state prison
inmate whose case is still rolling around in the system without the
knowledge of the inmate&apos;s attorney. Giving the inmate advice counter of what
his own attorney was telling him is a cardinal sin and speaks to the frame
of mind Gibson was in when this took place.

Of greater concern to me was Gibson counseling Adams without the knowledge
of his own staff, telling the defendant not to plead guilty, when Gibson&apos;s
own assistant, David Patterson, was sending signals to the defense attorney
that if a plea agreement was not reached, he would consider seeking the
death penalty.

That, more than anything else, goes to the core of the problem. What kind of
credibility can assistant prosecutors have with the local bar if their boss
tells defendants to ignore what the assistants tell defense lawyers?

The Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility took the proper action
last fall when they suspended Gibson&apos;s license to practice law. That
resulted in Gibson being indefinitely removed from office.

Since that time the 13th Judicial Circuit has been one prosecuting attorney
short. We taxpayers are paying for a prosecutor who, not by his choice, is
not working. In a sense, we are being punished for Gibson&apos;s sins.

It is so unfair to the taxpayers of the Upper Cumberlands to pay the salary
of an office holder who betrayed our trust and confidence.

The BPR and Gibson should bring an end to this and end it as soon as
possible. Since the judicial system operates on a system of &quot;settling&quot; cases
rather than prosecuting them, and since the BPR shows no signs of taking any
affirmative action any time soon, a &quot;sentencing agreement&quot; is needed.

Perhaps it is time for someone to suggest that in exchange for Gibson&apos;s
resignation as District Attorney General, the BPR will recommend to the
Tennessee Supreme Court that Gibson serve out a specified suspension of his
law license and if all conditions are met, have his license reinstated.

Just not as District Attorney General.

Gibson has faced up, been honest and apologized. Embarrassing facts about
Gibson&apos;s personal life have been aired publicly. He should at some point and
time be allowed to return to the practice of law. That would be fair to him.

It would be fair to the citizens of Cumberland and the remaining six
counties that make up the district for Gibson to step down so his position
can be filled and the already overloaded justice system have another working
prosecutor on the payroll.

It would truly be a plea agreement that would serve the district well.

 Man shot after threatening officer Nashville police


Associated Press - June 11, 2007 12:35 PM ET

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Nashville police say an officer shot and wounded a suspect who police had stopped for speeding after the man threatened patrolmen.

Brian Anthony Maddox is in critical condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center today after the incident last night.

An officer pulled over Maddox&apos;s car, then found the man had failed to appear in court in a drug charge.

Police spokesman Don Aaron says when the officer told Maddox to get out of the car, Maddox pulled a telescoping metal baton and raised it.

Officer Bill Bolan was patrolling in the neighborhood when he saw the confrontation and stopped. Aaron says Maddox then came at Bolan, who fired three shots from his service pistol, striking Maddox.

The suspects stepson and stepdaughter were in his car, but were unhurt.

Studying death in Tennessee

TriCities.com, Editorial

A year-long study of Tennessee&apos;s death penalty will determine whether the
state applies the punishment without bias and whether it takes adequate
steps to safeguard the innocent.

The study is urgently needed - given a report by the American Bar
Association that found critical flaws in the state&apos;s death penalty process.
Meeting 7 of 93 benchmark standards isn&apos;t good enough when a life is at
stake.

Thus, the study received overwhelming legislative approval. The Senate
passed it unanimously. In the House, just 14 lawmakers voted no. It would be
difficult to find a measure with more support.

That&apos;s why the vote of Rep. Jason Mumpower, R-Bristol, makes no sense.
Mumpower, the House minority leader, voted against the study.

No other member of the region&apos;s legislative delegation opposed the study.
Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, R-Blountville, voted yes. So did Rep. Matthew Hill,
R-Jonesborough, Rep. Jon Lundberg, R-Bristol, Rep. Nathan Vaughn,
D-Kingsport, and Sen. Rusty Crowe, R-Johnson City.

What did Mumpower find xobjectionable about the study that didn&apos;t trouble his
regional colleagues?

The text of the bill offers no clues. Surely Mumpower agrees that the state
should &quot;exercise the utmost care in matters of life and death&quot; and that &quot;the
execution of an innocent person by the state of Tennessee would be a grave
and irreversible injustice&quot;? Or that the criminal just system must be
&quot;impartial, equitable, competent [and] accurate&quot; and meet the needs of
victims&apos; family members?

Is Mumpower trying to prove his conservative credentials - to be known as
the lawmaking equivalent of a hanging judge? Or does he fear the study might
be a prelude to dismantle the death penalty, since public support is waning?

The measure doesn&apos;t do away with the penalty; it doesn&apos;t even include a
moratorium. It creates a 16-member committee made up of lawmakers,
prosecutors, defense attorneys and advocates for crime victims and the
mentally ill. The committee has a year to do its work before reporting back
to the legislature and the governor.

That work will focus on four issues: the standards for capital case defense
lawyers, the risk of executing an innocent person, protections for mentally
ill or mentally retarded defendants and services provided for victims&apos;
families and the families of capital defendants.

These are important avenues of study; they address some of the issues raised
in the ABA report. However, the committee also must investigate allegations
that the death penalty is disproportionately applied to blacks, other
minorities and the poor.

Almost without exception, the 100 or so condemned prisoners on the state&apos;s
death row were indigent and represented by court-appointed lawyers. About 40
percent are black, and a significant number of those were sentenced to die
by all-white juries.

Of equal concern, a study by The (Nashville) Tennessean found that half of
all cases in which a death penalty was imposed were overturned on appeal for
procedural mistakes. Some argue this is a result of judicial advocacy and an
anti-death-penalty bent on the state&apos;s higher court benches. Perhaps. But it
might also be interpreted as a stunning indictment of the present system.

The study is not coupled to a moratorium, although there are compelling
arguments not to execute anyone while the state tries to fix its broken law.
The political reality is that a bill that included a moratorium wouldn&apos;t
have survived its trip through the legislature. We urge the governor to use
his power to stop any executions during the study period. It&apos;s the right
thing to do.

If the state is going to keep the death penalty, the system must be as fair
and equitable as possible. Every care must be taken to prevent the execution
of an innocent man or woman.

Tennessee cannot argue that it already takes all the necessary steps. The
study will provide the information needed to shore up the law.

Lawmakers Seek Pardon for Paul House

Nearly 30 state lawmakers are urging Gov. Phil Bredesen to pardon Paul

Nearly 30 state lawmakers are urging Gov. Phil Bredesen to pardon Paul
House, who remains on Tennessee&apos;s death row even after the U.S. Supreme
Court determined a year ago that no reasonable juror would convict him given
the evidence now available.

State Rep. Mike Turner, D-Old Hickory, first asked the governor to free
House in March, and then proposed a formal resolution asking for a full
pardon, but to no avail. Since then, however, he&apos;s garnered bipartisan
support for House, with 26 legislators from across the state recently
signing a letter on his behalf. On Thursday, Turner will accompany Paul
House&apos;s mother, Joyce House, at Legislative Plaza to present the letter to
Bredesen.

&quot;Governor Bredesen, we understand that the authority to grant pardons is one
of the most serious and awesome responsibilities of your office,&quot; the letter
states. &quot;However, in the case of Paul House, we believe that it is
warranted.&quot;

The governor&apos;s spokeswoman has previously told the Scene it&apos;s Bredesen&apos;s
policy to let such matters remain in the courts until all judicial remedies
are exhausted.

House has spent 22 years on death row for the rape and murder of Carolyn
Muncey in rural Union County. Although House has maintained his innocence
all along, it wasn&apos;t until more than a decade after his conviction that DNA
and other evidence surfaced pointing to the victim&apos;s husband as the likely
killer. And although the Supreme Court agrees House is probably innocent, he
still is on death row, dying from the degenerative disease multiple
sclerosis.

&quot;This letter is signed by a broad spectrum of Tennessee legislators, by
Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, abolitionists and
death penalty supporters,&quot; says Alex Wiesendanger, associate director of the
Tennessee Coalition to Abolish State Killing. &quot;They all believe that having
Paul House on death row is a mockery of justice. I hope the governor will
heed the call of the legislature and do the right thing.&quot;

Tennessee

Court denies appeal of inmate who says chosen method of death is
unconstitutional

By Lawrence Buser, The Commercial Appeal

A federal appeals court has turned down the appeal of a death row inmate who
has chosen electrocution over lethal injection but now argues that
electrocution is unconstitutional.

Gary Bradford Cone was convicted in 1982 of bludgeoning to death an elderly
Memphis couple -- Shipley and Cleopatra Todd -- while hiding out in their
home on Evergreen near Poplar after robbing a jewelry store.

The Sixth U.S. Court of Appeals has twice set aside Cone&apos;s death sentence,
once ruling that his trial lawyer was ineffective and then again after
finding that the jury instructions were unconstitutionally vague.

The U.S. Supreme Court reversed both of those decisions and reinstated
Cone&apos;s death sentence.

Cone&apos;s attorneys then renewed some arguments and raised additional issues to
the Sixth Circuit last November, including alleged withheld evidence, faulty
jury instructions and ineffective assistance of his attorney.

They also alleged that electrocution violates the Eighth Amendment banning
cruel and unusual punishment.

Since his crimes were committed before January of 1999, Cone was allowed to
choose his method of execution and chose death in the electric chair.

If an inmate refuses to choose, the default method of execution is lethal
injection.

&quot;Since Cone selected a method of execution different from the state&apos;s
default method, his xobjections to his chosen method of execution are waived
and we do not reach the merits of his claim,&quot; the three-judge appeals court
panel said in a 2-1 decision filed today in Cincinnati.

&quot;We note that even if Cone&apos;s claim could move forward, neither the Supreme
Court nor this circuit has concluded that electrocution offends &apos;the
evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.&apos;
&quot;

The panel upheld a previous ruling by U.S. Dist. Court Judge Jon McCalla.

No execution date has been set for Cone, now 58, who was a Vietnam veteran
and prelaw student from Arkansas. He blamed drug addiction, combat stress
and mental illness for his crime spree.

Tennessee Indigent Defense Attorneys Receive Less than Half the Dollars
Allocated to the Prosecution

PRNewswire

New report reveals that fairness and accuracy of the Tennessee criminal
justice system is jeopardized by funding disparity

NASHVILLE, Tenn -- A new report on prosecution and indigent defense funding
in Tennessee has uncovered disturbing evidence of a significant and unfair
imbalance of financial and other resources between the prosecution and
indigent defense functions. The report is the first comprehensive analysis
of indigent defense and prosecution resources in the state, and indicates
that Tennessee&apos;s indigent defense system is in dire need of reform. The
Spangenberg Group, one of the nation&apos;s leading experts on state criminal
justice systems, authored the new study.

The report, Resources of the Prosecution and Indigent Defense Functions
in Tennessee, can be accessed at: http://www.tnjusticeproject.org along
with a Summary Analysis prepared by The Tennessee Justice Project, who
commissioned the study.

The report finds that in fiscal year 2004-2005 (the most recent year
for which extensive funding information is available) the defense function
in indigent cases received only $56.4 million -- less than half of the $130
million to $139 million the prosecution received. This disparity affects
cases ranging from misdemeanors to death penalty cases.

Furthermore, when taking into account &quot;in-kind&quot; services provided to
the prosecution function from various federal, county, and municipal law
enforcement agencies and experts, prosecutors receive more than four times
as many resources than are provided to indigent defense counsel. While
these &quot;in- kind&quot; services cannot be quantified on a state-wide basis, they
account for millions of dollars worth of assistance provided annually to
prosecutors by local law enforcement agencies in 95 counties and hundreds
of towns and cities throughout the state, as well as by federal law
enforcement and forensic crime labs.

&quot;This imbalance of resources creates an uneven playing field which
ultimately leads to greater financial and human costs and reduced public
confidence in the criminal justice system,&quot; said Bill Redick, Director of
the Tennessee Justice Project. &quot;When even the most capable and hard-working
attorneys lack adequate resources to do their job, there is an increased
risk that innocent people will be incarcerated, guilty people may never be
prosecuted, and other defendants will receive unfairly excessive
sentences.&quot;

As a result of the under-funding of defense services, too frequently,
all that indigent defense counsel can do is &quot;meet and plead&quot; their clients
because they lack the time or resources to visit crime scenes, interview
witnesses, conduct necessary investigations and forensic testing, retain
experts, and perform other tasks required for effective defense.

&quot;To ensure a properly functioning criminal justice system, funding for
indigent defense attorneys must be raised to a level that corresponds
appropriately to the resources of the prosecution,&quot; said Bradley MacLean, a
Nashville defense attorney and Assistant Director of The Tennessee Justice
Project. &quot;We are not suggesting a decrease in resources for the prosecution
function. We are simply advocating for reasonable parity for indigent cases
between the defense and the prosecution so that the defense counsel is
included as an equal partner in the justice system.&quot;

In performing the study, the Spangenberg Group examined fiscal year
2004- 2005 funding information from a variety of sources, including the
Tennessee Administrative Office of the Courts; the District Attorney
Generals&apos; Conference; the Public Defenders&apos; Conference; the Indigent
Defense Fund; and other federal, state, county, and local governmental
funding sources involved in indigent criminal prosecution and defense.

The Spangenberg Group further examined the findings of the report by
utilizing two additional analyses:

-- A &quot;per unit&quot; comparison between prosecution and defense in indigent
cases, dividing the funds available for prosecution and defense
annually by the total numbers of attorneys in the district attorneys&apos;
and public defenders&apos; offices, respectively. According to this
comparison, district attorneys receive financial resources equal to
$379,000 per district attorney per year, and public defenders receive
financial resources equal to only $182,500 per public defender per
year, a ratio of more than two-to-one in favor of the
prosecution.(This
&quot;per unit&quot; comparison of resources does not account for the &quot;in-kind&quot;
services that further skew the balance.)

-- A report by the Tennessee Comptroller, FY2005-2006 Tennessee Weighted
Caseload Study Update, which found that in order for Tennessee to
meet
previously-determined caseload standards for prosecutors and public
defenders, the district attorneys need an additional 22 attorney
positions while public defenders need an additional 123 attorney
positions. (According to the Weighted Caseload Study, in fiscal year
2005-2006 there were 459 prosecutors and 309 public defenders in
Tennessee.)

&quot;In the course of over three decades conducting nationwide research on
the financial resources furnished to the prosecution and the defense in
indigent criminal cases, the findings in Tennessee are the most telling
examples of disparity we have found,&quot; said the author of the report, Robert
Spangenberg.

The Spangenberg Group is one of the nation&apos;s foremost research and
consulting firms that specializes in the evaluation of state criminal
justice systems. Robert Spangenberg has over 30 years experience in this
field, and during the past 20 years The Spangenberg Group has worked in all
50 states, conducting comprehensive statewide studies of criminal justice
systems in more than half of the states. The Spangenberg Group has
conducted several criminal justice system studies in Tennessee, including a
1999 Tennessee Public Defender Case Weighting Study for the Tennessee
Comptroller of the Treasury.

The report was commissioned by The Tennessee Justice Project, a
nonprofit organization committed to increasing the fairness and accuracy of
the Tennessee indigent criminal justice system, with a particular focus on
the administration of the death penalty. In pursuit of this mission, The
Tennessee Justice Project educates the public, media, and policymakers in
Tennessee about the problems facing the state&apos;s criminal justice system and
seeks necessary reforms.

Experts are also available to comment on the report, and interviews can
be arranged through Katie Andriulli at (202) 557-7579 or Laura Burstein at
(202) 557-7584.
