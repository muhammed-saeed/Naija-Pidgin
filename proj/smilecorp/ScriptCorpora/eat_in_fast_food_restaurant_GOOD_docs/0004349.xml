 &quot;El Cid&quot;seasoning 
 blends began in 1983 as a way to spice-up rice, poultry, beef, pork, fish, 
 beans, soups and vegetables. Over the years, these authentic 
 Mexican seasonings were slowly and carefully refined to their 
 current mix. All seasonings have NO MSG. By using our seasonings, 
 you will be truly Cooking The Authentic Mexican Way.  All 
 seasoning blends and products are MADE in the USA.
