Receipt printing processing method, receipt printing processing system, and printer 
 

 Abstract: When a customer places a special order that changes the content of a product, a receipt printing processing system also produces a special order seal when the sales receipt is printed. The receipt printing processing system has a receipt printer and a label printer that is in communication with the receipt printer. When the receipt printer receives transaction processing data generated by a POS register used to take orders, the receipt printer prints a receipt, determines if special order information is contained in the transaction processing data, and generates seal printing data for printing a special order seal, if the special order information is contained in the transaction processing data. The receipt printer also sends the seal printing data to the label printer for printing a special order seal. Because the receipt printer generates the seal printing data, special order seals can be printed without modifying the application program run by the POS register. ...
