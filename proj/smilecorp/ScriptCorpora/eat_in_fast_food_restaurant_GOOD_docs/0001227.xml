( More ) I&apos;ve been there three times.First visit: I got stares from all persons sitting in the cafe ( I assume they were regulars). I tried smiling at them but all they do is grunt. I was told to go look at the buffet and see if i would want that. I didn&apos;t because everything looked unhealthy, fried or greasy. If I wanted that kind of food I would go to a fast food restaurant... The only &apos;healthy&apos; item was the salad, which itself was only lettuce (which offers no nutritional value) some tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots and a limited selection of dressings.I decided to get a cheeseburger. It was alright, nothing fancy, and certainly nothing to remember. The service was alright, too.Second visit: Same as above, except they get my order wrong. I didn&apos;t want them to take it back and fix it, even though my family kept telling me to do so ( I have a fear of returning things to the kitchen on account of a movie called &apos;Waiting...&apos; Third Visit: Still unfriendly service, and the waitress looked trashy with tattoos all over her chest. I was there with my grandma, and I was apalled to see her flaunting her &apos;art&apos; . Very unprofessional. They got my order wrong again (surprise). I got so mad that I didn&apos;t want to eat anymore but my grandmother told the waitress to take it back. And as soon as she did, the waitress gave a fake smile and yelled at the kitchen staff, making sure I would hear that they got the order wrong. I thought to myself, &quot;Oh, no...They&apos;re going to spit in my food.&quot; The waitress came back and sort of shoved it in my face and smiled again. Sigh. I vowed to never go in there again and since haven&apos;t. The reason I went those three times was to please my grandmother. She liked that place for some reason. The last time I went with her she kept praising it, and at the end of it all she said she was sorry for ever saying it was a good place to eat. She said it wasn&apos;t so hot. That the meat was too dry and chewy, and that the waitress never came to refill our drinks, nor her hot tea. My boyfriend went with me those three times, too. And he hates it. I just think that if a whole family goes there and they all leave displeased then it isn&apos;t a good place to eat.  ( Hide ) Was this Review helpful to you?      Report Abuse    |    Business Owner Reply to Review 0.3
