Downtown Garland Texas Taco Bell
 
Manager, I just went through your drive-thru around 12:35 pm today. The speaker system for the customer to give the order does not seem adequate, as the clerk can hardly be heard. I gave my order of 2 bean burritos and 2 tacos, and 8 packages of hot sauce. When told of the total all I could hear was 0.78. I knew it must be something and 78 cents. I pulled forward to the pick up window and saw the digital sign reading $11.78. I asked the clerk, &quot;2 tacos and 2 burritos, right?&quot; I though perhaps an order in the drive-thru line up was mixed up. The clerk said &quot;no, 10.&quot; She then turned around with the package in her hand and said loud enough for me to hear &quot;he said he wanted 2.&quot; I could hear another employee say loudly, &quot;he needs to talk more clearly next time!&quot; It took a couple of minutes for them to make another order, rather than just taking out 2 tacos and 2 burritos out of the previously made order. I found in my bag: no receipt, only 4 sauces, and smashed tacos and burritos
