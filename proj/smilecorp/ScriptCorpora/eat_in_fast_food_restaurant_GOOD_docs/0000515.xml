Fast Food Restaurants Showing Vegetarian Love
 Feb 1, 2011 - by Meena 
It wasn’t always easy growing up as a vegetarian, especially since I was the only vegetarian amongst my friends and family. It was difficult to go out for dinners, order take-outs, or even suggest different restaurants. Nonetheless, I was still accepted, thankfully, but I had to roll with the punches, and that meant going to places such as KFC and The Keg. In the 90’s, and early millennium, being a vegetarian was like speaking a foreign language … nobody understood the word. Now things are different, and a healthier diet is promoted. For instance, up until 2008, KFC had nothing but coleslaw salad as a vegetarian option, and now even KFC has a veggie burger. Ah, sweet victory!

In the past few years there has been a noticeable shift amongst vegetarian options in restaurants, in particular with fast food places. They are catching on to the “healthy eating” market, and I love it! Here are six places to check out for some fast food action, without losing too much time or money.

1. Burger King
- In 2002 BK introduced the “grilled meatless” veggie burger. This sandwich comes with the usual toppings; lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles along with your preference for condiments. Unfortunately it is just as pricey as the other menu items, but that’s just what we have to pay for; “specialty” items. The veggie sandwich has less calories and fat compared to the full-scale Whopper, so if you are thinking about switching to a healthier diet make sure to give it a try.
o Price- less than $10
o Taste – 2.5

2. Panago Pizza
- Even vegetarians crave some comfort foods, and Panago certainly has taken pizza to a whole new dimension by introducing the “veggie peperoni.” Yes, there is such a thing as -veggie peperoni- and the taste is delicious! Again, the cost is still pretty much the same, if not more, compared to some of their regular menu pizza’s, but who wouldn&apos;t pay more for less carbs and fat? The veggie peperoni pizza is tasty, flavourful and healthy, especially if you order with the multi-grain dough. Take the dare and find out if you and your guests can notice the veggie pepperoni difference!
o Price – less than $20
o Taste – 4.5

3. Subway
- I know there&apos;s a lot of you out there who just can&apos;t stand the smell of subway. Understandable. But, you have to admit, it is healthy, affordable and fast. The sandwiches taste great compared to other fast food places. The Veggie sub is an excellent light sandwich that is full of fresh tasty veggies. Unfortunately, no real source of protein, but it will leave you feeling light and refreshed. This is an excellent suggestion for the &quot;I forgot my lunch&quot; moments, or even late night cravings after the bar. Subway has it covered when it comes to healthy meals at an affordable price.
o Price – less than $5
o Taste - 4

4. TacoTime
-Yes that’s right…taco time made the list. This place has an excellent healthy alternative, especially if you find yourself in a food court. They have fresh ingredients that your taste buds will notice right away, and if you ask for no/or little sour cream and/or guacamole your laughing. My personal favourite is their bean salad, and if you ask for refried beans, instead of a dressing, you will be amazed by all the flavours that pop in your mouth. This option is an excellent source of protein without the fat. However, if you’re not in the mood for a salad make sure to try the veggie bean burrito as a healthier option. Surprising, TacoTime is full of taste and leaves you feeling full.
Price – less than $5
Taste - 4

5. Hotdog Vendors
- I couldn’t leave these guys out!! Hotdog vendors know how to serve their customers. Majority, if not all, hotdog vendors in the downtown core have a “veggie hotdog” on their menu. They are delicious, filling and much, much healthier. Many of the vendors carry Yves hotdogs, so you know they are full of mouthwatering flavor and nutritional value that will have you asking for more. Unfortunately the veggie dogs are just as pricey as some of the other hotdogs, if not more. But again, if you’re trying a healthier diet this is a must~!
o Price – less than $5
o Taste – 5

6. KFC
- Many people still don’t know this, however, KFC now has the new veggie burger. Technically it is a “veggie chicken burger.” The taste is ok, a little too greasy for me. But, as a heads up ... KFC does fry their vegan patties in the same oil that they use to cook real chicken. I personally am not a huge fan of this method of cooking, nor the taste itself. However, if you are looking for a healthier option for your diet I recommend you try this “chicken” burger. It is higher in protein and much less in fat.
o Price-less than $10
o Taste – 1.5

These are just a few of the places I can go to when in need of something fast and quick. Let me know if your favourite fast food restaurant made the list, or if you would recommend one to add to the list.
