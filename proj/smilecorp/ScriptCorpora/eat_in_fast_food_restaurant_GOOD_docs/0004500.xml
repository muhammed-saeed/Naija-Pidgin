Snuck is an Americanism first introduced in the 19th century as a nonstandard regional variant of sneaked. Widespread use of snuck has become more common with every generation. It is now used by educated speakers in all regions. Formal written English is more conservative than other varieties, of course, and here snuck still meets with much resistance.

 Places to Visit 

 
 Santiago, Chile 
 
 Today, Santiago is a city that occupies the fertile central valley of Chile between the Andes and the coast, with the Mapocho River crossing the city from east to west. The most remarkable thing about Santiag o, with its five million inhabitants, is perhaps its diversity. It is a city with many faces, great and varied changes, and a social and political landscape that sometimes takes us back to the colonial city it once was. Almost 500 years after Pedro de Valdivia traced around the Plaza de Armas the 35 blocks that would compos e the city in 1541, Santiago is now an extensive urban environment with skyscra p e rs an d

 Vina del Mar, Chile 
 
 Topography and Coastline Like many oth er Chilean coastal towns and cities, Viña del Mar consists of two areas: one of winding streets and houses clinging precariously to the hills, while the other, lyi ng be tween the hills and the sea, is built along the strict formality of the colonial era grid plan. Viña, often called the tourism capital of Chile, has an area of 172 square kilometers and just over 300 thousand inhabitants. From Abarca Cove to Salinas , the resort stretches three and a half kilometers, and includes the beaches o f A capulco , Mirasol and Los Marineros , among others. As well, there are two…

 Easter Island / Rapa Nui / Isla Pascua D escription 


 
 Evidence suggests the first Polynesians arrived on Easter Is land (also known as Rapa Nui or Isla Pascua) around 800 AD. It w as first &quot;discovered&quot; by Europeans in 1722. The Dutch mariner Admiral Jacob Roggeveen landed on the island on Easter Day, thus naming it Easter Island.

Although the history of the island is the subject of some debate it is generally thought that as the islands population gre w , clans developed and eventually battled each other over the limited reso u rces of the island. There is evidence of stronger and weaker clans, suggesting one gro up controlled most of the resources. Estimates of the island&apos;s maximum population in the e arl y 1800s range from 4,000 to 20,000. The total area of the island is only 117sq.km/72.5sq...

 Safety in Chile 
 
The major cities of Santiago and Valparaiso are the areas to which the following suggestions are most applicable. In general, Chile is a very safe country for travel. You will find a police presence even in the most remote areas of the country. 

However, it is prudent to make simple precautions: 
- keep your documents in a locker in your hotel room or hotel safe - somewhere not easily accessible. - store your money in several locations; never put all of your money in one pocket, purse, etc. A good idea is to sew in several inside pockets, or to wear a money pouch below the waist (not outside your closes). Another good idea is to keep an elasticized support bandage above the elbow where you could store your money and checks. It is not a smart idea to wear your biggest diamonds on your fingers while traveling - or any other clearly expensive jewelry. In busy markets and streets keep your bag in front of you or under your arm; have a small lock for your backpack.

 Attractions and Destinations: 

 
 Jerusalem 



 
 What has not already been said about the holiest city in the world, the city that has been united, the eternal city first built thousands of years ago, whose history can be heard in the whispering of the wind along the walls, where every stone tells a wondrous story of a city that has drawn millions of faithful pilgrims for thousands of years. Such is Jerusalem , the capital of Israel , the only city in the world that has 70 names of love and yearning, the city that in old maps appears at the center of the world and is still adored like a young bride. 
 
 
 Jerusalem is a city of overwhelming emotions, a city that promises a religious and spiritual experience, excitement and pleasure, interesting tours and entertaining adventures.

 The Old City of Jerusalem 

 

 
 
 There is a magical quality about the Old City of Jerusalem that does not exist anywhere else in the world. Perhaps it is due to the glorious history of the towering stone walls and ancient buildings, or the sacred atmosphere that surrounds the holy sites of Jewish, Christian, and Moslem religions. The enchanting quality of Jerusalem may also come from the colorful markets and narrow alleyways, or from the city’s dynamic history - a history woven with war and peace, love and hate, destruction and resurrection. 

 

 

 The Old City was originally built by King David in 1004 B.C.E. and has always been considered the center of the world. Ancient maps show the three continents known at the time: Europe, Asia, and Africa, situated in a circle with Jerusalem at their center. Since then Jerusalem has been cherished and glorified by kings, rulers, and conquerors who attempted to storm its walls and adored by ordinary people who made it the loadstone of their faith. This was the place where the Jews built the Temple, where Jesus was crucified, and where Mohammed rose to Heaven. Pilgrims, beggars, merchants, students of great scholars, warriors and slaves have all walked its streets, and have praised and revered Jerusalem.

 Church of the Holy Sepulchre 
 

 
 Jerusalem ’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher bears little if any resemblance to the churches most visitors know from home. And that, it seems, is the best reason to visit it. 

 

 

 Here, where Orthodox and Catholic Christians mark the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, Christians of other denominations can explore the world of what scholars call the“historic churches.”Six denominations celebrate their rites in and around the cavernous house of worship. These communities are some of Christianity’s most ancient. Among the lesser known churches in the West, the Ethiopians, for example, trace their Christian origins back to Philip’s conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-34), and listening to the Syriac Orthodox praying in Aramaic might be the only chance you’ll ever have to hear the language Jesus used on a daily basis.

 The City of David 


 
 The City of David is the birthplace of the city of Jerusalem, the place where King David established his kingdom, and where the history of the People of Israel was written. It is within walking distance from the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall, and is one of the most exciting sites in Israel. Visitors come there from all over the world to see the place where the Holy City started and the strongest physical connection between the stories of the Bible and reality.

 In the year 1004 B. C. E. King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established his capital there. It was here where the People of Israel were united under King David’s rule, here where the Holy Ark was bought and here where the First Temple was built by King Solomon, King David’s son.

 The Jewish Quarter 
 



 
 Every step you take in the Jewish Quarter brings you closer to discovering tangible remains of dramatic chapter in Jewish history, especially of the period of its greatest grandeur: the time of the Second Temple .
This period is richly commemorated at the Burnt House and the Herodian Mansions .

 The Garden of Gethsemane 
 



 
 Visitors to of the Garden of Gethsemane are amazed when they learn that the gnarled olive trees they see could have been young saplings when Jesus came here with the disciples on that fateful night after the Last Supper (Matt. 26:36; Mark 14:32; John 18:1). Today the ancient trees rise from manicured flower beds; in Jesus’time this would have been an olive grove where an olive-oil press–gethsemane in Greek–was located.

 Mary’s Tomb 

 
 
 The Tomb of Mary, the mother of Jesus, is marked by one of Jerusalem’s most venerable churches, located in the Kidron Valley , which the at the foot of the Mount of Olives near the Garden of Gethsemane .

 Christians built the first house of prayer here 1,500 years ago over a stone crypt visitors can still see. By Crusader times the church had been destroyed, and only a small cupola remained over the tomb. But in 1130 a new church was built, its façade with pointed Gothic arches, and most of the interior has amazingly survived frequent flooding of the Kidron Stream.

 The present décor, with its flickering oil lamps and icons gives the church a feel of mystery and antiquity, and attests to its present congregation of Eastern Christian denominations.


 Next to the church is a cave which some believe suits the description of Gethsemane in Mark 14:32 and Matthew 26:36.
 
 Mount of Olives 
 



 
 Located east of Jerusalem ’s Old City and separating it from the Judean Desert , the Mount of Olives is one of the most prominent sites in the Jerusalem vicinity mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. It is first mentioned as King David’s escape route during the rebellion of his son Absalom, then later in the prophets; but it is most often referred to in the New Testament, being the route from Jerusalem to Bethany and a favorite location for Jesus&apos; teachings to his pupils and where he wept over Jerusalem . Here, the Dominus Flevit Church was built by the Franciscan order in 1954 to designs by A. Barluzzi in the shape of a tear atop remains of a Byzantine church.

 Nazareth 




 
 Nazareth, or Natsrat as its name is pronounced in Hebrew, is the cradle of Christianity, the city where, according to tradition, the angel Gabriel told Mary that she would conceive by the power of the Holy Spirit, and the place where Jesus spent his childhood and youth. Nazareth, in the lower Galilee, is located in the heart of a valley surrounded by mountains that embrace several of the most important Christian sites in the world. This is a city of religion and faith, of spirituality and holiness, but also a city with a rich history, fascinating archeology, modern culture and Middle Eastern charm. 
 



 
 Nazareth, which began as a small Jewish village about 2,000 years ago, became a stronghold of Christianity in the Byzantine period, just a few hundred years later. During that period the name of Nazareth spread far and wide, and the yearnings to see the place where the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ had lived turned the city into a popular pilgrimage site. These visits led to the building of the city’s first church - the Church of the Annunciation at the traditional site of Joseph and Mary’s home. Many more churches have been built throughout the city, and were destroyed and rebuilt with the changes in Muslim and Christian rule over the centuries. In the 19th century Nazareth attracted renewed interest and Christians returned to live in this city and rebuilt churches and monasteries. Today Nazareth is the largest Arab city in Israel and has about 30 churches and monasteries, as well as mosques and ancient synagogues.

 Western Wall and the Temple Mount 
 



 
 Visitors who stand at the Western Wall, looking up at the huge ancient stones–the last remnant of the Temple in Jerusalem –are almost always surrounded by people: some have come to celebrate a Bar Mitzvah, others to take pictures before a wedding, or to place a heartfelt prayer-note within the cracks between the stones. But they sense the presence not only of the here-and-now, but also of the untold numbers of people who for centuries streamed to this, the most sacred place in the world to the Jewish people. 
 



 
 The Western Wall was part of the most magnificent building Jerusalem had ever seen. It was one of four walls Herod the Great built to support the 1,555,000-square-foot plaza on which the Temple stood. It was almost 1,500 feet long–the rest can still be seen inside the Western Wall Tunnel . Originally it was some 90 feet high and reached some 60 feet into the ground.

 Temple Mount 

 
 
 When King Solomon constructed his first Temple in Jerusalem the hillside on which he did so became the most Important cultic site of the monotheistic world, and is still reverenced by Jews and Muslims today. Solomon (960 - 900BCE) built the temple that David was not allowed to, using Phoenician craftsmen from the neighbouring kingdom of Tyre (See the lengthy account of the process in 1 Kings). He also built a circular platform around the edge of the hill to hold the courtyards that encircled the cedarwood and bronze building, and the whole edifice was to have been the focus of Jewish worship for ever. However, after his reign the Northern Kingdom declared autonomy, after which time the Temple was used by the tribes of Judea and Benjamin only.

 In 586BCE the Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians as Israelites continued to be trapped between warlike Southern and Northern empires. The inhabitants of Judea were killed or taken into exile (excepting the farmers). It was only after fifty years and the auspicious intervention of Persia , the new inheritors of imperial power, that they had the opportunity to return and rebuild the Temple , the thought of returning having sustained many of them during their exile (See Ezra and Nehemiah).

 Galilee 
 
 
 The Galilee is not a large region. A mere 80 miles separate its northern border-the peak of Mount Hermon from its southernmost boundary along the Jezreel Plain, the site of biblical Armageddon . 

 Its eastern reaches, on the far edge of the Golan plateau, lie only 50 miles from the Mediterranean sea in the west, but these 5,000 square miles encompass amazingly beautiful and contrasting scenery: mountains and valleys, fertile plateaus and stark cliffs and glimmering seacoast. 

 

 

 
 

 The dirve just one hour from one end of the Galilee to the other, and it is also a short hop from major attractions all around Israel : a two hour drive to Tel Aviv,under three hours to Jerusalem or the Dead Sea .

 Dahab 
 Dahab, which means“gold”in Arabic, was named after its glimmering sandy beaches that resemble gold dust. It lies 85 km north of Sharm El Sheikh and was originally a Bedouin village called Assalah. However, in recent years it has grown to become one of the main Red Sea Riviera resorts. Visitors love to relax in its excellent restaurants and hotels or among the palm trees that surround its turquoise sea. 
 Among popular activities are diving, snorkelling and windsurfing. There are more than 40 dive clubs and most diving centres organise safaris to Abu Galum, the Nabq Protectorates and The Blue Hole (which is one of the best sites for experienced divers). Among the best spots for snorkelling are Lighthouse Reef, Eel Garden and the Canyon. 
 El Gouna 
 Positioned between the Sienna Mountains and the Red Sea, El Gouna owes it popularity to the vision of a businessman from Cairo, who chose the spot to build himself a house and a small jetty for his boat. Now, El Gouna has 13 hotels and a variety of residential villas, making it the Red Sea hotspot that it is today.The town is ideally situated along 10 kilometres of scenic beachfront, and is built by award-winning architects on islands surrounded by crystalline turquoise lagoons. 
 With many hotels to choose from–ranging from guesthouses to five-star beachfront resort hotels–El Gouna is a sophisticated yet informal holiday destination with year-round sunshine and an exciting array of sports and leisure activities. 
Its downtown area and marina are always buzzing with shopping arcades, bazaars, an art village, cafes, and a wide selection of restaurants, bars and pubs, as well as a casino and discos.
For many, El Gouna is the ultimate holiday destination for diving, water skiing, sailing, fishing, windsurfing and golf–it is home to an 18-hole USPGA championship golf course with panoramic views. 
 El Qusier 
 Once one of the major ports on the Red Sea coast, Quseir was where Queen Hatshepsut set off from on an expedition to the mystical African land of Punt. On top of that, it was also a major point for pilgrims leaving for Mecca, as well as a significant trade route for spices from India to Britain. Today, Quseir is better-known as a first-class diving destination. It is also home to a number of attractions, including Wadi Hammamat and Bir Umm Fawakhir, both of which can be reached within a day. 
 Wadi Hammamat has hundreds of rock inscriptions, some of which date back to 4000 BC. During antiquity, it was famous for production of the Bekheny Stone, a beautiful, green ornamental rock, whichwas considered sacred. The stone was actively quarried from Pharaonic until Roman times to make bowls, statues and sarcophagi, many of which have been found in the Pyramids, graves and temples of those periods. A little to the north of Wadi Hammamat, in the central part of the Eastern Desert, lies Bir Umm Fawakhir, a gold mining settlement from the fifth and sixth century. 
 Hurghada 
 Tucked into the lower end of the Gulf of Suez, Hurghada is one of Egypt’s liveliest and busiest resorts. And it manages to merge the old with the new to perfection in that its fine, modern buildings sit happily alongside El-Dahar, the old town, which is the centre of everyday Egyptian life. 
 Diving has long been the main attraction of Hurghada. The area is renowned for its extraordinary and unique reefs. And, for non-divers, Giftun Island is perfect for snorkelling, and as a spot for camping. Not far from Hurghada are the exceptional dive sites of Brothers Islands, Ras Mohammed and the Strait of Gubal, where Thistlegorm, the Red Sea’s most well known wreck, is found.
The town also has an exciting nightlife, with many clubs, bars and pubs; and is a good base for visiting the Monasteries of St Anthony and St Paul. 
 Makadi Bay 
 This new resort, 35 km south of Hurghada, is a beautiful natural bay, nestled between desert dunes and a superb mountain range. It offers translucent waters, white sandy beaches and exquisite marine life. Facilities include tennis, diving, watersports, an open-theatre, a health club, a children’s club, outdoor and indoor swimming pools, and horse and camel riding. At night, visitors can enjoy live music at a number of bars, restaurants and discos. 
 Monastery of St. Katherine 
 
 In 330 AD, the mother of Emperor Constantine, Empress Helena, ordered the construction of a small church near Moses’Burning Bush. It was called the Church of the Transfiguration. The fortified Monastery of St Katherine seen today was built around the church during the reign of Emperor Justinian (527-565 AD). In the 11th century, the monastery was dedicated to St Katherine of Alexandria, who died in 310 AD. Her remains, reportedly found by monks on a mountain peak next to Mount Sinai, are buried in the monastery’s Basilica. 
 Again, underwater activities are the main attraction in Nuweiba. Shallow reefs create interesting locations for snorkeling; and diving sites include Ras Burka, Big Ruta, Devil’s Head and Maagana to name but a few. Opportunities exist, too, for trekking, either by camel or jeep, into the astounding Sinai interior or through the coastline mountains. Highlights include St Katherine’s Monastery, Mount Sinai, the Coloured Canyon, or a visit to some of the oases in the area.

 MOUNT SINAI 
 Mount Sinai, just south of the Monastery of St Katherine, is of great religious importance to Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. According to the Old Testament, this is where Moses received the Ten Commandments. Throughout the centuries, the mountain has drawn thousands of pilgrims from all over the world. Visitors can ascend to the summit (7497 ft) either by climbing the‘ancient route’- some 4000 steps built by monks - or by following an easier but longer path. Both lead to an open area known as Elija’s Basin, where it is necessary to walk up the remaining 750 steps to the top. At the summit, is the Chapel of the Holy Trinity built in 1934 on the site of a much earlier chapel built in 363 AD. The climb takes about three hours but the view from the top is truly breathtaking, especially at sunrise. 
 National Parks in Sinai 
 RAS MOHAMED NATIONAL PARK 
 This 480-square kilometre protected area lies where the Gulf of Suez meets the Gulf of Aqaba at Sinai&apos;s southern extremity. The arid desert terrain - consisting of sand dunes, gravel plains, fossilised corals and granite mountains - is home to a number of rare species, including Dorcas gazelle, Nubian ibex and red fox. 
 Easier to spot, though, are its resident birds such as terns, herons, gulls and ospreys. Thousands of white storks pass through Ras Mohammed each year, heading south during September/October and back north during April/May. There are about 85 different types of flowers and plants in the park, including magnificent mangroves. In glaring contrast to the seemingly desolate landscape, the ecosystem underwater at Ras is a magnificent eruption of life: 200 types of coral (125 of which are soft corals), 1000 different fish, 40 starfish, 25 sea urchin, 100 mollusk, 150 species of crustacean, as well as the Green Turtle and the Hawksbill Turtle 
 NABQ PROTECTORATE 
 Spread across 600 sq km, Nabq contains a variety of ecosystems that provide for nature unique in the Sinai Peninsula. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) agreed to protect Nabq on the basis of its rich natural resource base. These include:* The most northerly mangrove trees in the Red Sea/Indian Ocean complex* One of the largest single of Arak Bushes in the Middle East, covering the higher dunes of the Wadi Kid*Some 134 plant species of which six are found only in Nabq* Gazelle, Nubian Ibex, Hyrax and many varied small mammals* Rich coral reefs 
 ABU GALUM PROTECTORATE 
 Characterised by its spectacular granite mountains ending abruptly on a narrow coastal plain fronted by rich coral reefs, Abu Galum (located between Dahab and Nuweiba) owes its protected status to its varied ecosystems, unique back reef communities and excellent coral. Recent surveys have identified 167 species of desert plants, many of which are not found in either Ras Mohamed or Nabq. As a result, Abu Galum is also home to the largest number of Nubian ibex, Hyrax, red fox and striped hyena. Ten different species of lizards and snakes have also been identified. 
 TABA PROTECTORATE 
 This covers a massive 2,800 sq km and is located between Nuweiba and Taba. Mainly, it contains an intricate system of valleys and rifts beautifully sculpted by the elements of nature across time. It engulfs the Ein Umm Ahmed and Ein Khudra oases and the Nawamis tombs, and has many plants. 
 ST KATHERINE&apos;S PROTECTORATE 
 This comprises the mountain network in South Sinai. Home to many plants - many of which are not found anywhere else in the world - it is also inhabited by some interesting mammals, reptiles, birds and insects. 
 Nuweiba 
 About 87 km north of Dahab lies Nuweiba,‘the pearl of the Gulf of Aqaba’. Rugged mountains and sandy beaches make this a particular heavenly spot, and the city itself offers a range of accommodation, a fascinating bazaar and a wide selection of bars and restaurants. North of the centre is Tarabin, a marina walk alongside peaceful Nuweiba Bay, which, with its bamboo beach huts, is a perfect place to sit and watch the sun rise or set. 
 Again, underwater activities are the main attraction in Nuweiba. Shallow reefs create interesting locations for snorkeling; and diving sites include Ras Burka, Big Ruta, Devil’s Head and Maagana to name but a few. Opportunities exist, too, for trekking, either by camel or jeep, into the astounding Sinai interior or through the coastline mountains. Highlights include St Katherine’s Monastery, Mount Sinai, the Coloured Canyon, or a visit to some of the oases in the area. 
 Safaga 
 Safaga is a favourite spot for sun bathers, and its water is known to have a high content of saline, which is said to be beneficial for the skin. Encircled by Makadi Bay, Soma Bay and Shahl Hashish - Safaga is also home to Tobia Arbaa and Tobia Hamra; these two chain reefs line the shore and make it an ideal spot for daily diving.The town is also popular for windsurfing and, in 1993, hosted the World Windsurfing Championships. 
 Most dive sites are still unspoilt and can be reached by boat, less than one hour to the inner reefs and between one-and-a-half to two hours to the outer reefs. There is something there to match all interests: manta rays at Sha’ab Saiman, the eel garden at Gamul Kabira, blue-spotted stingrays at Tobias, sharp drop-offs at Abu Kafan, the anemone city at Panorama Reef. And then there is the night dive at Sha’ab Sheer or confronting the huge Salem Express lying on its starboard side. Safaga is also famed for Mons Claudianus. 
 These fascinating ruins of a Roman settlement lie in the desert between the Red Sea and the Nile. For more than two centuries, from 68 AD to 282 AD, Mons Claudianus used the surrounding mountains to produce high quality columns and building blocks of grey granite known as granodiorite for the sole purpose of beautifying imperial Rome. 
 Sahl Hashish 
 Situated just 20 km south of Hurghada, on the Hurghada-Safaga Road, Sahl Hashish is made up of a variety of Pharaonic, Greco-Roman and Oriental-style buildings. Divers, watersport lovers and sun worshippers love its clear waters, pristine beaches and marvellous coral reefs. It is convenient for day trips to Luxor, Nile cruises, trekking in the Eastern Desert and visits to the Roman site of Mons Claudianus. 
 Sharm El Sheikh 
 Overlooking the Gulf of Aqaba, in Southern Sinai, lies one of the most outstanding marine environments in the world, with its varied coral reefs, and diverse aquatic life, in crystal clear waters. There are direct flights from Europe to Sharm El Sheikh airport, which is about 14 km from Sharm EL Maya and 8 km from Na’ama Bay. 
 The city of Sharm El Sheikh comprises three centres: Sharm El Maya, Om El Seed Hill and Na’ama Bay. 
 The resort offers the very best tourist facilities, including restaurants, varied entertainment and numerous activities such as underwater photography, horse and camel riding, quad-biking, snorkeling, desert safaris, windsurfing and sailing to mention just a few. One of the most popular activities is diving. Easy’sites include The Temple and Middle-to-Near Garden. Intermediate sites are White Knights, Tower and Paradise, while most experienced divers delight to find themselves among the amazing Jackson and Thomas Reefs off Tiran Island and the Shark and Yolanda reefs in the Ras Mohamed National Park. The richness of their fauna and flora and the beauty of their reefs is simply overwhelming.
