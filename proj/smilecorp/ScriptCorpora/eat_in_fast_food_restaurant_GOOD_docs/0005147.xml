abrogations.

impair or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions,
agreements, ordinances, rules or regulations previously adopted or in effect
pursuant to law. However, wherever this title imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this title shall govern. (Prior code§150-6)
 Section 17.04.080 Additional remedies. 
   In case any building or structure is constructed,
extended, altered, repaired, changed, converted or maintained, or any building,

to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to

   Within the zoning districts established by this
title or amendments hereafter adopted, there exist lots, structures, use
of land and/or structures which were lawful before this title was passed

 Article II Continuation of Nonconforming Structures and Uses 
 Section 17.16.070 Purpose. 
   Although there are uses which do not fit into the
desired pattern of a zoning district and become nonconforming, it is the
policy of the city of Salisbury to provide for the continuation of certain
nonconformities which do not endanger the public health, safety and welfare
and to recognize that certain uses, although nonconforming in their location,
are needed and useful to the area they serve without great detriment to
their surrounding neighbors. To provide for change, alteration or enlargement
of these uses, the following criteria are established, and approval by
the board of zoning appeals is required, after public notice and hearing.
(Prior code§150-297)
 Section 17.16.080 Criteria for approval--Conditions. 
   A. The board of zoning appeals may approve change,
alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming use or structure after consideration
of the following:
   1. The intensity of the existing use relative to
the district in which it is located, the scale of the change or enlargement
in relation to the intensity of the use and whether it will have serious
negative effects on the surrounding area, depreciating property values;
   2. Whether the change, alteration or enlargement
is of benefit to or in the best interest of the community or surrounding
area, such as providing additional employment or housing for the community
or services to a neighborhood;
   3. Existing or possible traffic and parking problems
and how they can be reduced or minimized;
   4. Screening, buffering or architectural improvements
which may make the use more compatible with the surrounding area;
   5. Whether the change, alteration or enlargement
will upgrade or improve the existing nonconforming use, such as change
to a less-intensive use, change in operation, structural changes or redesign
of the site relative to parking areas, entrances, exits, loading or unloading
and traffic flow.
   B. Upon approval of a change, alteration or enlargement
of a nonconforming use, the board of zoning appeals may impose such conditions
or restrictions on the proposal as deemed necessary to reduce or minimize
any effect upon other properties in the neighborhood and to secure compliance
with the intent of the criteria for approval of such change, alteration
or enlargement. (Prior code§150-298)

 Chapter 17.24 
 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD) 
 Sections: 
     17.24.010 Purpose. 
     17.24.020 Certificate of design
and site plan approval required. 
     17.24.030 Permitted uses. 
     17.24.040 Development standards. 
 Section 17.24.010 Purpose. 
   A. In 1732 the town of Salisbury was established
at the head of the Wicomico River. The CBD is located in this central area
of the city where the town began. For many years &quot;downtown&quot; was the center
of all trade and industrial activity for the region. It survived and was
rebuilt twice after being practically destroyed by fires in 1860 and 1866.
Through the years as the city grew and other business areas sprang up along
major highways and intersections, the downtown area evolved from the traditional
main street central shopping area into the center of governmental, professional,
institutional and law enforcement facilities while still retaining service
and retail activities. This was accomplished through the city&apos;s involvement
in adoption and implementation of plans, urban renewal and studies for
revitalization of the downtown area.
   B. In 1962 the central business district revitalization
plan was adopted. In the late 1960&apos;s and early 1970&apos;s an urban design study
was completed, two urban renewal projects were completed, and an urban
river plan was adopted, recognizing the Wicomico River as an important
natural asset to future development of the downtown area. In 1980 a R/UDAT
Study was completed, and in 1981 a downtown historic district was created.
During this time considerable public and private funds were expended implementing
these plans and studies.
   C. The purpose of the central business district
is to maintain and strengthen the role of the downtown area as the community
and regional center for a broad range of governmental, cultural, institutional,
professional, business, service and retail activities; to enhance the vitality
of the downtown by encouraging residential uses; to continue to carry out
and implement the recommendations contained in adopted plans and studies
for development of the CBD; and to assure that improvements made using
public funds are utilized to the greatest extent possible for the benefit
of the public in further development of the downtown area. To ensure that
the role of the CBD is maintained and land uses are compatible, general
functional categories of land use are described, and special standards
for development are set forth. To ensure that development within this district
is consistent with the recommendations of the adopted plans, the downtown
historic district and any other special development plans which may be
effective from time to time, a certificate of design and site plan approval
from the planning commission is required. The following uses, standards
and review procedures have been developed in accordance with this purpose,
which is in accord with the findings and recommendations contained in the
plans and studies mentioned herein and the metro core comprehensive plan.
(Ord. 1647§2, 1997; prior code§150-88)
 Section 17.24.020 Certificate of design and
site plan approval required. 
   Prior to development or redevelopment of any lot
or parcel of land within the CBD, a certificate of design and site plan
approval shall be obtained from the Salisbury planning commission. Repairs,
maintenance and minor additions or change of use not affecting the existing
site arrangement of buildings, parking, vehicular or pedestrian movement
or building height shall not require a certificate. (Ord. 1647§3,
1997; prior code§150-89)

   A. Uses permitted are those that fulfill the purpose
and intent of the district, encourage residential use, provide business,
professional or financial services, bring people together for cultural

activities.
   B. Permitted uses shall be as follows:

     17.28.060 Development standards. 
 Section 17.28.010 Purpose. 
   The purpose of the light business and institutional
district is to recognize that lands located along major limited access
highways running through Salisbury are exposed to large volumes of traffic
and high degrees of visibility and to provide for their development while
protecting adjoining residential areas. These lands are generally located
between the major highways and parallel streets which border adjoining
residential areas. Access to these lands is obtainable only from access
roads to the major highways and streets bordering the residential areas.
Because of their location and exposure to the highways, these lands are
unlikely to develop as residential and are subject to pressure for development
with uses that benefit from the high degree of visibility and volumes of
traffic. To provide for development of these lands and to afford some protection
to adjoining residential areas, the uses permitted in this district are
those which may benefit from this exposure but which primarily do not generate
continuous heavy volumes of traffic, noise, dust or odor, do not primarily
have late evening or weekend hours and do not have the detrimental effects
that intensive commercial development may have on the property values of
nearby residential neighborhoods. Those uses which may generate noise,
odor and have evening or weekend hours are encouraged to locate adjacent
to the major access highways at the intersection of access roads to be
as far from neighboring residential areas as possible. The following uses,
standards and area regulations have been developed based upon this purpose,
which is in accord with findings and recommendations of the city&apos;s adopted
land use element of the metro core comprehensive plan. (Prior code§150-59)

development, intensive strip development is discouraged and specific design
standards are required. Clustering of uses is permitted through the provision
of planned business centers and neighborhood shopping centers.

developments is not detrimental to existing areas and will not create an
adverse impact on adjoining development, a comprehensive site plan is required
to be approved by the planning commission prior to the issuance of a building
permit.
   D. Special design features are included in the district
in order to preserve the open, uncluttered appearance of the streets or
highways and intersections around which these districts are located. By
permitting only related uses and requiring specific standards, the district

   A. It shall be the duty of an historic district
commission to review any application to construct, alter, reconstruct,
move or demolish any structure within an historic district if any such
changes would affect its exterior appearance and to approve or reject such
application.
   B. Any person, individual, firm or corporation proposing
to construct, alter, reconstruct, move, demolish or repair any structure
within an historic district, if such changes would affect its exterior
appearance, shall file an application for the same with the historic district
commission at the office of the bureau of inspections of the city of Salisbury,
who shall forward the application, together with all maps, plans and all
other data to the historic district commission. Each application shall
include all necessary data required by the rules of the historic district
commission and shall be advertised in such manner as provided for in the
rules of the commission.
   C. In reviewing an application and plans, an historic
district commission shall give consideration to:
   1. The historic or architectural value or significance
of the structure and its relation to the historic value of the surrounding
area;
   2. The relationship of the exterior architectural
features of such structure to the rest of the structure and to the surrounding
area;
   3. The general compatibility of exterior design,
arrangement, texture and materials proposed;
   4. Special features in historic areas, such as their
architectural integrity and spatial relationships among buildings. Spatial
relationships include courtyards, street patterns, the scale of buildings
and open space;
   5. Any other factors, including aesthetic factors,
which the commission deems to be pertinent.
   D. An historic district commission shall pass only
on exterior features of a structure and shall not consider interior arrangement,
nor shall it disapprove applications except with regard to the considerations
set forth above.
   E. Intent.
   1. It is the intent of these regulations that the
commissions be strict in their judgment of plans for structures deemed
to be valuable according to studies performed for districts of historic
or architectural value.
   2. It is not the intent of these regulations to
limit new construction, alteration or repair to any one period of architectural
style or to the same style as the structure being changed or that of its
neighbors. It is also the intent of these regulations that an historic
district commission shall be lenient in its judgment of plans for new construction
except where such plans would seriously impair the historic or architectural
value of surrounding structures. If the proposed new construction materially
impairs the historic value of neighboring buildings, the commission can
reject the proposal.
   3. It is recognized that there are a number of structures
within historic districts that are neither architecturally nor historically
significant or valuable and that most changes to such structures, including
in many cases demolition thereof, would not be detrimental to an historic
district but indeed would represent improvement thereof which, itself,
is a principal purpose of these regulations. To this end the city council
directs that all applications relating to such structures shall be processed
expediously and without any needless delays.
   F. Special Consideration.
   1. In the case of an application for alterations
affecting the exterior appearance of a structure which a commission deems
of unusual importance to the city or unusual importance to the entire state
or nation, the commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an
economically feasible plan for the preservation of such structure.

 Section 17.60.010 Purpose. 
   At the request of the city of Salisbury and other
interested parties, the Regional Urban Design Assistance Team (R/UDAT)
of the American Institute of Architects completed a study of the downtown
area in May, 1980. Its report recommended a strong traditional Main Street
image, the reestablishment of the downtown area as the historical center,
the restoration and rehabilitation of older or architecturally significant
buildings and the encouragement of construction of new structures of architectural
quality or merit compatible with their neighbors but not necessarily of
the same style. The downtown historic district is established in keeping
with this recommendation and to stabilize and improve property values in
the downtown area, to strengthen the local economy, to foster civic pride,
to protect against the destruction and deterioration of the downtown and
to lead to its continuance of preservation.* (Prior code§150-121)

&quot;traditional main street&quot; concept enunciated in the R/UDAT report, dated
May, 1980, and the desirability of new buildings and diversity in architecture.
   D. The local members of the Chesapeake Bay Chapter
of the Maryland Society of Architects are authorized to serve as professional
advisors to the downtown historic district commission.
   E. The city council is aware that the tasteless
use of commercial paint colors under the guise of ordinary maintenance
may have a very detrimental effect on buildings in the district and, in
fact, do violence to the very intent of the district. Therefore, the commission
shall adopt a color chart with a large selection of suitable exterior colors
and, in adopting this color chart, employ and consolidate charts from various
paint stores, dealers and companies, which shall be kept available in the
office of the building inspector for consideration by property owners.
The commission shall informally consult with property owners upon request
as to possible colors and combinations thereof prior to actual filing of
an application by a property owner in order to minimize delay in approval.

the most part, residentially developed. To allow for gradual transition
from residential to hospital use, the uses permitted in this district include
residential as well as offices, hospital, medical and other related uses
so residents of the area may enjoy the use and value of their property
while the gradual transition is occurring. The following uses, standards

continuing eastward, and the industrial and commercially developed areas
across Eastern Shore Drive to the west. To protect the adjoining residential
areas to the east, special attention is given to setbacks, screening, landscaping,
signs and access. Uses are limited to offices, service uses and to limited
retail sales, which do not have late hours of operation, noise, odor and
large amounts of on-site traffic. The office and service highway district
No. I applies specifically to the land area along Eastern Shore Drive,
but the rationale contained in this purpose may be applied to other areas
where streets or highways are developed or become major collector thoroughfares
through or adjoining residential areas and the same circumstances occur.

 Section 17.96.010 Purpose. 
   The purpose of the office and service highway district
No. 3 is to provide for continued development and redevelopment of an area
originally developed as residential to nonresidential use. Construction
of Waverly Drive has exposed this area to large volumes of traffic entering
and leaving the central business district. With this exposure and the effect
of the adjoining strip highway commercial development to the east, the
area is no longer suitable for residential development. Redevelopment of
this area with limited retail sales and office and service uses provides
a transition area from the heavy commercial to the east and the residential
areas across Waverly Drive to the west. The following uses and standards
have been developed based upon this purpose, which is consistent with the
findings and recommendations of the city&apos;s adopted land use element of
the metro core comprehensive plan. (Prior code§150-49)

of boundaries. 
     17.100.040 Permitted and
accessory uses. 
     17.100.050 Development standards. 
 Section 17.100.010 Purpose. 
   The paleochannel is an ancient buried riverbed estimated
to store approximately seven billion (7,000,000,000) gallons of water,
which extends into the northerly portion of Wicomico County from Dorchester
County and which has been nominated by the city council and designated
as an area of critical state concern by the Maryland Department of State
Planning. The paleochannel extends into Salisbury along its northerly corporate
limits, has been mapped and studied in its known portion by the Maryland
Geological Survey, provides potable water for the city of Salisbury and
is a potentially unlimited source of water for both Salisbury and Wicomico
County. Because of its vast potential as a potable abundant water supply,
protective measures, in the form of use limitations and review procedures,
are necessary to ensure that it is protected from contamination while continual
study is done of the paleochannel&apos;s recharge areas and its capabilities
and limitations. The following district, uses and development standards
have been developed based upon this purpose, which is in accord with the
findings and recommendations for the paleochannel in the city&apos;s adopted
metro core comprehensive plan.* (Prior code§150-130)
 * Editor&apos;s Note: A map of the Salisbury paleochannel is
included at the end of this chapter. 
 Section 17.100.020 Establishment of boundaries. 
   The paleochannel district shall be shown on the
official zoning map as a district overlying the existing zoning and shall
include all that area within the Salisbury corporate limits shown on the
Maryland Geological Survey Map for the paleochannel set forth in Bulletin
31, Part II, by James W. Weigle, 1972, and may be changed from time to
time as the paleochannel is further defined without the necessity of showing
a mistake in the original boundaries or a change in the neighborhood. (Prior
code§150-131)
 Section 17.100.040 Permitted and accessory
uses. 
   Permitted uses and accessory uses shall be as follows:
   A. All uses permitted in the underlying zoning district(s),
with the following exceptions:
   1. Uses which discharge excessive amounts of water
or use, store or generate raw or waste materials which are ignitable, corrosive,
reactive or toxic, such as, but not limited to, manufacture of organic
and inorganic chemicals, paint and pigments, petroleum refining, steel,
metal products fabrication, electroplating and textile dyeing and finishing.
(Prior code§150-133)
 Section 17.100.050 Development standards. 
   In addition to the development standards for the
underlying zoning district(s), the following shall be required:
   A. All proposals for development of any lot or parcel
of land for any use shall require submission of a comprehensive site plan
to be reviewed by the planning commission.
   B. The planning commission shall review the proposal
relative to any existing or future possibility of contamination of the
paleochannel through storage and handling of raw and waste materials or
from the particular manufacturing or industrial process proposed. The commission
shall solicit any technical advice or information it deems necessary in
its review of the proposed use to assure that possible contamination will
not occur, including, but not limited to, the following:
   1. A copy of all necessary permits from the Maryland
Department of Water Resources and any other applicable state agency;
   2. An impact statement from an independent consultant,
at the developer&apos;s expense.
   C. If the commission is satisfied that the proposal
poses no unacceptable risk of contamination to the paleochannel, the comprehensive
site plan shall be approved.
   D. If the commission determines that there is any
possibility that the proposal may pose an unacceptable risk of contamination
to the paleochannel, then the request to construct or use and operate such
use at the proposed location shall be denied.
   E. A proposal which has been rejected by the commission
may be resubmitted for review if there has been a major change in the processing,
storage or handling of material which eliminates the potential risk of
contamination to the paleochannel.
   F. Appeal from the commission&apos;s final decision may
be made to the circuit court for Wicomico County within thirty (30) days
of the commission&apos;s final decision.
   G. Uses operating or described in Section 17.100.040(A)(I)
existing at the date of amendment of this chapter and located in the paleochannel
district shall submit a plan for management of materials which may pose
a risk of contamination to the paleochannel. Submission review and approval
of the plan shall follow the same procedure as required for new uses, except
that the required comprehensive site plan shall be at the discretion of
the planning director. (Ord. 1752A (part), 2000; prior code§150-134)

design and site plan approval required. 
     17.104.030 Permitted uses. 
     17.104.040 Development standards. 
 Section 17.104.010 Purpose. 
   A. The Wicomico River is an important and unique
resource necessary to the economic viability of the city of Salisbury and
Wicomico County. This district is intended to promote the development and
redevelopment of lands along the Wicomico River with a mixture of uses
and activities which are either dependent upon or appropriate to the waterfront.
Industries which require frontage on and access to the water and certain
waterfront-related commercial activities are to be given primary consideration
for lands adjoining the river. To complement and strengthen the function
of the waterfront area, certain recreation, shopping, business and residential
uses are also permitted.
   B. To ensure compatibility with riverfront development
in the adjoining central business and historic district, compatibility
or architecture, landscaping and site design for development within the
district and public access to the waterfront, with proper emphasis on pedestrian
movement and its separation from industrial traffic, all uses within this
district are subject to review and approval by the planning commission.
   C. Coordination of site plans, landscaping and pedestrian
and traffic movement is a necessary concern for review and approval of
uses to assure that waterfront development uses can function harmoniously
and compatibly with less intensive uses permitted to complement and strengthen
the waterfront area. The following uses, standards and review procedures
have been developed in accordance with this purpose, which is consistent
with the findings and recommendations of the metro core comprehensive plan
for development of the Wicomico River waterfront. (Ord. 1647§5,
1997; prior code§150-92)

wide range of housing accommodations and industrial development be encouraged
to meet the needs of the city and to accomplish sound physical and economic
planning. Planned development districts, (hereinafter &quot;PDD&quot;), encouraging
the best possible design of buildings and site planning under a comprehensive
plan of development, provide for more efficient use of land and the provision
of public services.
   B. Planned developments provide opportunities for
alternative densities, lot sizes and other bulk regulations and often necessitate
the special design and development of public streets and utilities. It
is in the best interest of the city, therefore, that these planned developments
be approved by the city council in accordance with specific plans to assure
that the community will benefit from the proposed development with a minimum
impact on existing development.
   C. The following planned development districts are
therefore set forth in the text of this chapter, with specific boundaries
to be established on the official zoning map* after approval by the city
council of a preliminary development plan. These districts are &quot;floating
districts&quot; and under Maryland case law are analogous to special exceptions.
Criteria for establishment of these districts are set forth in the purpose
for each district and shall be the basis for approval or denial by the
city council without the necessity of showing a mistake in the original
zoning or a change in the neighborhood. (Prior code§150-135)

 Section 17.112.010 Purpose. 
   A. A residential development planned and constructed
in accordance with a unified plan approved under stringent review procedures
operates in harmony with existing and future surrounding development and
aid in achieving the goals and recommendations of the housing element of
the comprehensive plan for the city.
   B. The purpose of the planned residential district
is to provide the maximum choice in type of living environment and living
accommodations available to the residents of the city. The district is
established to produce:
   1. An efficient use of land resulting in smaller
networks of utilities and streets, thereby encouraging a diversity of living
environments and a variety of housing styles;
   2. Open space and recreation areas which are essential
and major elements of the planned development and which are related to
and affect the long-term value of homes within the development and adjoining
or nearby development;
   3. A development which is based on design and intensity
of use and the relationship between land uses rather than on standardized
residential districts which are segregated from each other on the basis
of housing types and development standards;
   4. A pattern of development which preserves the
natural environment of the site, including trees, outstanding natural topography
and geologic features;
   5. Development flexibility to respond to market
demands.
   C. The following regulations have been developed
based upon these purposes which are consistent with the recommendations
of the land use element of the city&apos;s adopted plan. (Prior code§150-150)
 Section 17.112.020 Development plan required. 
   A development plan reviewed and approved in accordance
with Chapter 17.108, shall be required for all planned residential development.
(Prior code§150-151)
 Section 17.112.030 Establishment of boundaries. 
   Boundaries for a planned residential district shall
be approved by the city council and shown on the official zoning map after
approval of the preliminary development plan. (Prior code§150-152)
 Section 17.112.040 General standards and
requirements for approval. 
   A. Size of the Planned Residential Development Site.
   1. A planned residential development shall be on
a tract of land of at least five acres.
   2. A planned residential development may be permitted
for a tract of land of less than five acres if the planning commission
finds, upon a showing by the applicant, that the planned residential development
is in the public interest because one or more of the following conditions
exist:
   a. An unusual physical or topographic feature of
importance to the people of the area or the community as a whole exists
on the site or in the neighborhood which can be considered and still provide
an equivalent use of the land by the use of a planned residential development;
   b. The property or its neighborhood has an historical
character or feature of importance to the community that will be protected
by the use of a planned residential development;
   c. The property is adjacent to or across a street
from property which has been either approved for or developed or redeveloped
under a cluster or planned residential development and a planned residential
development will contribute to the maintenance of the amenities and values
of the neighborhood.
   B. Findings for Project Approval. The city council,
upon consideration of the recommendations of the planning commission, shall
approve a planned residential development when it finds that the proposed
development satisfies the purposes of Chapter 17.108, and the standards
of this chapter, including the following:
   1. The planned residential development is an effective
and unified treatment of the development possibilities on the site and
makes appropriate provisions for the preservation of natural features such
as streams and shorelines, wooded cover, marsh or wetlands;
   2. The planned residential development will be compatible
with the area surrounding the site and will not require substantially greater
demand on public facilities and services than other authorized uses for
the land;
   3. At its option, the city council may consider
if financing is available to the applicant sufficient to assure completion
of the proposed development. (Prior code§150-153)
 Section 17.112.050 Permitted uses. 
   Uses permitted shall be as follows:
   A. All uses permitted inherently as accessory uses
by ordinance permit and by special exception in the R-5A and R-8A districts;
provided, that all such uses shall be developed in accordance with the
standards for these uses as defined in this title unless specifically modified
by the city council upon approval of the district.
   B. If residential service uses are included as a
part of the district as permitted, these uses shall be integrated into
the total design of the planned residential development in such a manner
as to complement surrounding residential development either in design or
by limitation and regulation of activities.
   C. Commercial Uses.
   1. Commercial uses shall be limited to those uses
in Chapter 17.32, and subject to development standards of the neighborhood
business district.
   2. Intense commercial uses shall not be located
closer than one hundred fifty (150) feet to any adjacent residential districts.
   3. Such uses shall be primarily for the service
and convenience of the residents of the development and immediate neighborhood.
   4. Before approving any commercial uses, the planning
commission may require a market analysis, prepared by a market analyst,
demonstrating that the amount of commercial space provided is needed and
can be realistically supported. The market analysis shall as a minimum
contain the following determinations:
   a. The trade area of the proposed facilities;
   b. The trade areas and population, present and prospective;
   c. The effective buying power in the trade area;
   d. The net potential customer buying power for stores
in the proposed commercial facilities and the recommended kinds of stores
and floor space; and
   e. The residual amount of buying power in the trade
area and how it may be expected to expand by the addition of other kinds
of stores serving the trade area.
   5. Where commercial uses are proposed, at least
thirty (30) percent of the dwelling units in the planned residential development
shall have access to commercial areas by paved pedestrian walkways. Such
access shall not involve the crossing of any collector street or major
highway.
   6. After considering the information provided by
the developer in support of proposed commercial uses, the relationship
of commercial uses to the planned residential development and the surrounding
area, the impact of traffic on safety and adequacy of streets and the intensity
of such uses, the planning commission shall recommend to the city council
whether the commercial use is to be permitted and, if so, the kind of business
and floor area needed to serve residents of the trade area. (Prior code§150-154)
 Section 17.112.060 Project density. 
   A. Density for apartment and townhouse development
shall not exceed twelve (12) dwelling units per acre, except as follows.
   B. The planning commission may recommend an increase
in density for apartment development, up to a maximum of thirty (30) units
per acre, after consideration of:
   1. Existing and proposed streets and traffic patterns
relative to the amount of traffic to be generated by the density proposed
and whether it can be easily accommodated without being detrimental to
existing surrounding development;
   2. Design and topography of the site relative to
use of setbacks, arrangement of buildings, landscaping and open space to
achieve maximum results in integration of greater density and building
height without harsh contrast in relation to surrounding development.
   3. Provisions of recreational facilities in relation
to maximum density of people to be served.
   C. If the planning commission finds that any of
the following conditions would be created by an increase in density permitted
by this chapter, the commission shall recommend limits on any increase
in density by an amount sufficient to avoid creation of one or more of
the following conditions:
   1. Inconvenient or unsafe access to the planned
residential development;
   2. Traffic congestion in the streets adjoining the
planned residential development;
   3. An excessive burden on sewerage, water supply
or other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the planned
development.

the planning commission an opportunity to assess the proposed project while
in an early planning stage, prior to the developer incurring the expense
of preparing a detailed comprehensive development plan. An early review
of the concept of the development in preliminary form will enable both
the applicant and the planning commission to assess the proposed development
and make recommendations relating to existing land use in the area, future
plans for development in the area, the adequacy of on- and off-site facilities
to serve the proposed development and the functional, public safety and
aesthetic considerations relating to the development. Five copies, drawn
to scale, of a preliminary comprehensive development plan may be submitted,
at the option of the developer, and shall include the following.
   1. The existing general topographic character of
the land and existing natural features of the site;
   2. The proposed approximate location, as appropriate,
of all roads, vehicular and pedestrian accessways, buildings, the building
footprints, parking areas, including the type and size of all spaces, open
spaces, recreation facilities, natural features, drainageways, fire-fighting
facilities, existing zoning, abutting property owners, stormwater management
areas, setbacks for all property lines, landscaping areas and on-site loading
and unloading spaces. In addition, the proposed location of any on-site
refuse disposal or recycling areas and facilities, or both, as may be required

a review for final approval of the proposed development at the next regularly
scheduled meeting. (Prior code§150-268)
 Section 17.180.040 Review procedure. 
   The planning commission shall review the proposed
development and all comments received with respect to traffic and circulation
patterns, internal and external; relation to major thoroughfares; utilities;
drainage; community facilities, existing or future; historic site preservation;
provisions for open space and recreational facilities, landscaping and
screening; and in general with the objective of ensuring a durable, harmonious
and appropriate use of land in accord with the objective of the Salisbury
metro core plan. To these ends the commission shall consider the location
of buildings, parking areas and other features with respect to the topography
of the land and its existing natural features; the efficiency, adequacy
and safety of the proposed layout of internal streets, driveways and parking
areas; the adequacy and location of open space or green area provided,
bearing in mind the possible effects of irregularly shaped lots; and any
such other matter as the commission may find to have a material bearing
upon the stated standards for the type of development proposed. Upon consideration
of all these things, the commission may consider deviations from strict
compliance with the standards for the development proposed, if the commission
finds that an alternative arrangement or design of the site can more readily
accomplish a harmonious use of the land and the intent of the purpose for
which the standards are set forth. The commission may require changes or
modifications to the proposed development plans to assure that the requirements
of this section, the intent of the purpose for the required standards and
the intent of the purpose for the district in which the development is
located are met. (Prior code§150-269)

consideration at a formal public hearing. (Prior code§150-270)
 Section 17.180.060 Waiver. 
   The planning commission and/or the board of zoning
appeals may waive any or all of the statements or studies required as part
of the comprehensive development plan set forth in the definition in Section
17.04.120, after consideration of the extent and impact of the development
proposed, whether the requirement is necessary and in the best interest
of the city, and the hardship imposed by the requirement upon the applicant.

if any other use is similar in nature, and the parking provisions for such
a use shall prevail. Where the director of the department of building,
housing and zoning cannot make a determination of similar use, the planning
commission, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 17.04, Article
II, shall review the proposal and make a written determination of similar
use upon which the parking provisions for such use shall prevail.
   B. Encroachment. An off-street parking area shall
not be encroached upon by buildings, storage, loading or unloading or any
other use where such reduction or encroachment will reduce the area below
that required by this Article, nor shall the number of parking spaces be
reduced except upon the granting of a variance by the board of zoning appeals.
However, the placement of construction above such parking area shall not
be deemed an encroachment if it is part of a building on the site and at
least eight feet above the surface of the parking area.
   C. Prohibited Uses. No parking area shall be used
for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles or equipment
or for the storage of materials or supplies, excluding emergency service
and repair of vehicles.
   D. Location.
   1. All required parking spaces shall be located
on the same lot as the use they serve, except that:
   a. The owner of two or more abutting lots may locate
the use on one lot and the parking spaces required for the use on another
of his abutting lots; or
   b. Two or more abutting property owners may locate
the parking spaces required for their uses on any of their lots if:
   i. The lot(s) providing the parking space abuts
the lot(s) containing the use(s) it serves;
   ii. All of the affected lots are in the same zoning
district;
   iii. The total number of spaces provided is not
less than the sum of spaces required for all the uses;
   iv. Means of pedestrian access is provided from
the parking space to the uses so that pedestrians are not required to traverse
property owned by other than said property owners, except where public
sidewalks may provide the access;
   v. That a recorded lease, easement or other form
of agreement be executed among said property owners assuring perpetual
use of the required parking spaces until or unless the required parking
spaces are located on the same lot as the use they serve. In all cases
above, both lots shall be included in the application for a building permit
or certificate of occupancy.
   c. Where buildings existing on the date of enactment
of this chapter cover a lot or parcel of land to the extent that required
parking cannot be accommodated on the site, required parking may be provided
on another lot in the same or adjoining district by special exception of
the board of zoning appeals in accordance with Chapter 17.232.
   2. All parking spaces and lots open to the sky (i.e.,
not in garages or carports) shall be located no closer than three feet
from the interior property line or back of the sidewalk or eight feet from
the curbline where no sidewalk exists, except for abutting property lines
of two or more lots exercising the options for common parking stipulated
above.
   3. All covered parking spaces and lots, including
garages and carports, shall not be located within any yard setback area,
except when permitted as an accessory building.
   E. Existing Facilities. Parking spaces and lots
serving structures and uses in existence at the date of adoption of this
chapter shall not be subject to the requirements of this chapter as long
as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that any parking
facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in the future be
reduced below such requirements or, if already below such requirements,
be reduced further.
   F. Change in Requirements. Whenever there is an
alteration or extension of a use or structure which increases the parking
requirements according to subsection (H) of this section, the total additional
parking required for the alteration or extension shall be provided in accordance
with the requirements of that subsection.
   G. Construction. All required off-street parking
spaces and aisles shall be paved with an all-weather material. For spaces
and aisles which are not part of a parking lot as herein defined, this
may include gravel or other dust-free material to provide a surface resistant
to erosion. However, for parking lots, the paving material shall be limited
to asphalt, concrete or similar hard surface material with all parking
spaces designated with a four-inch white or yellow stripe painted the entire
length of each space in accordance with the dimensional requirements stipulated
in subsection (H) of this section. All parking areas shall be drained to
prevent flooding or damage on adjoining properties or city streets.
   H. Required Off-Street Parking Spaces.
   1. All uses and structures shall provide off-street
parking spaces in an amount equal to or greater than the number required
in Section 17.196.030, parking space requirements. The total number of
parking spaces necessary for two or more uses on the same lot shall be
the sum of that required for each use.

at the request of an applicant, may approve alternative parking space dimensions
of not less than nine feet wide and eighteen (18) feet in length, provided
that:
   (A) A comprehensive site plan is submitted to the
planning director showing alternative parking space dimensions;
   (B) No compact vehicle spaces shall be approved
to meet the minimum parking requirements of this chapter, but said spaces
may be used to provide parking above the required minimum.
   (C) These provisions shall not apply to parallel
parking.
   iii. When approving a comprehensive development
plan for a shopping center, the Planning Commission, at the request of
the applicant, may approve a parking space dimension of not less than nine
feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length, provided that no compact
vehicle spaces shall be approved to meet the minimum parking requirements
of this chapter. Compact spaces may be used to provide parking above the
required minimum parking.
   iv. Compact vehicle spaces required. No more than
fifty (50) percent of parking lots for ten or more vehicles shall be reserved
for compact vehicles. Parking spaces for compact vehicles shall be at least
eight feet in width by seventeen (17) feet in length. Such spaces shall
be designated by signs measuring at least ten by sixteen (16) inches, with
letters at least three inches high stating &quot;COMPACT VEHICLES ONLY.&quot; Where
spaces are grouped together, signs may be placed at each end of the group;
otherwise, spaces shall be individually signed.
   b. Number and Computation. In computing the required
number of spaces, all fractional numbers shall be increased to the next
highest integer. When computation is based on the number of employees,
the number employed during the largest work shift shall be used.
   2. Parking and loading requirements shall be determined
on the basis of the total amount of gross square feet of building area.
   I. Parking Lots. For the purpose of this title,
&quot;parking lots&quot; are defined as facilities providing off-street parking space
for five or more vehicles. All parking lots shall meet the design and maintenance
standards specified below. All applications for a building or occupancy
permit to use land, in whole or in part, as a parking lot as herein defined
shall be accompanied by a landscaping plan as stipulated in Chapter 17.220.
   1. Dimensions.
   a. All parking spaces shall comply with the dimensions
specified in subsection (H)(1)(a). The minimum dimensions of all aisles
providing access to parking lot spaces shall be as follows:

   b. No portion of any parking space shall intrude
into the required aisle width. For aisles providing access to parking spaces
set at angles other than those specified above, the required aisle width
shall be that of the nearest specified angle of parking. If equidistant
from specified angles, the greatest aisle width of the two nearest angles
shall apply.
   c. Handicapped spaces and dimensions shall be provided
in accordance with state law.
   2. Obstructions. Parking lots shall be designed
to permit each motor vehicle to proceed to and from all unoccupied parking
spaces without requiring the moving of any other parked vehicle.
   3. Ingress and Egress. Entrance and exit driveways
and aisles linking parking lots to public streets shall comply with the
requirements for motor vehicle access stipulated by the city department
of public works. Parking spaces, other than residential, shall be designed
to prevent motor vehicles from backing onto a public street in order to
leave the lot.
   4. Location and Yard Requirements.
   a. All parking lots shall meet the location requirements
stipulated in Section 17.196.020(D).
   b. All yards surrounding the parking lot, exclusive
of driveways providing ingress and egress to the lot, shall be bordered
by a curb six inches high along the sides of the yard area abutting the
parking lot, including spaces and aisles. Concrete curb or bumpers shall
be required in areas where, in the opinion of the director of the bureau
of inspections and the director of public works, a curb constructed of
asphalt or similar material would be vulnerable to vehicular damage. If
bumpers are provided at the end of each parking space, a curb is not required.
Setback areas shall be planted with grass or similar vegetative material
and may include shrubs, fences or walls, provided that they are not placed
closer than three feet from any parking space.
   5. Structures. Utility poles, light standards and
similar structures shall not be permitted within any aisle or parking space.
Any structure located elsewhere within a parking lot shall be surrounded
on all sides abutting the spaces or aisles by a curb six inches high, separated
from the structure by at least three feet, the distance to be measured
from the broadest point on each side, exclusive of any portion greater
than ten feet from the ground.
   6. Raised Islands. Raised islands shall be installed
at the ends of all parking bays abutting an aisle or driveway. The raised
island shall be bordered by an asphalt or concrete curb six inches high
wherever it abuts a space or aisle and shall each be an average of at least
eight feet wide and extend the length of the parking space and/or bay.
The islands shall be planted with trees, grass, shrubs and similar vegetative
materials (see Chapter 17.220) and may be combined with crushed stone.
Utility poles and light standards may be installed within the raised islands,
provided that they are separated from the spaces and aisles as required
in Subsection (I)(5) above.
   7. Maintenance. All parking lots shall be kept free
from litter and trash. Any vegetative material required herein which dies
shall be replaced as soon as recommended seasonal conditions occur for
the replacement of the species.
   8. Reduction of Paved Areas. The board of zoning
appeals may reduce the required number of paved parking spaces for a proposed
retail sales use, provided that the board determines the proposed paved
areas will adequately serve the proposed use and provided that land to
accommodate the required number of paved parking spaces is set aside and
maintained in grass area, and further provided that should the retail sales
use be changed, the required paved parking spaces shall be provided.
   9. Up to fifty (50) percent of the parking spaces
required for theaters, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, dance halls
and nightclubs, and up to one hundred (100) percent of the parking spaces
required for a church auditorium, may be provided and used jointly by banks,
offices, retail stores, repair shops, service establishments and similar
uses not normally open, used or operated during the same hours as those
uses listed above; provided, however, that such joint use is approved by
the board of zoning appeals and written agreement thereto is properly executed
and recorded in the land records of Wicomico County, except that such joint
use in a planned development district shall be approved by the city council
as part of the development plan. (Ord. 1599§5 (part), 1995; prior

 Section 17.216.010 Purpose. 
   There is a significant relationship between the
manner in which signs are displayed and public safety and the value and
economic stability of adjoining property. The reasonable display of signs
is necessary as a public service and necessary to the conduct of competitive
commerce and industry. The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum
standards for signs in direct relationship to the functional use of property
and to the intensity of development permitted within the zoning districts
provided by this title. The purpose of this chapter is to further traffic
safety as there is a significant relationship between outdoor advertising
structures and traffic safety. Further, the very nature and changing character
of outdoor advertising structures and the material displayed causes a hazard
to traffic, a risk to safety of travelers and a detriment to public welfare.
The purpose is to further the beautification of the city which, through
the acts of the city and through the voluntary acts of its citizens, has
been beautified, and the outdoor advertising structures currently existing
in the city of Salisbury are aesthetically displeasing and are such that
the number, height, size, etc., of these signs reduce the quality of life
in the city of Salisbury and affect the health and welfare of the citizens
of Salisbury. (Prior code§150-244)

 Section 17.232.010 Purpose--Application--Conditions and guaranties. 
   A. The development and execution of this title is
based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts
the uses of land and structures and the bulk and location of structures
in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however,
that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics,
cannot be properly classified in any particular location. The board, after
public notice and hearing, may authorize such uses in harmony with the
purpose and intent of this title, only in the specific instances set forth
where the board makes findings of fact in accordance with the standards
and criteria hereinafter prescribed and further finds that the use will
not be contrary to the public interest.
   B. Application for a Special Exception. An application
for a special exception shall be filed with the building inspector and
shall be accompanied by such plans and data as may be required by this
title or as may be required by the board and its reviewing staff to assure
the board adequate information upon which it may consider the requested
special exception. The building inspector shall forward such application
and all relevant data to the office of the board.
   C. Conditions and Guaranties. Prior to the granting
of any special exception, the board may impose such conditions and restrictions
upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation
thereof as deemed necessary to reduce or minimize any effect upon other
properties in the neighborhood and to secure compliance with the standards,
criteria or other specific requirements for a special exception. In cases
in which a special exception is granted, the board may require such evidence
and guaranties as it deems necessary as proof that the conditions imposed
in connection therewith shall be met and complied with. Failure to comply
with such conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of this
title. (Prior code§150-295)

approved or denied, the board of zoning appeals shall weigh its appropriateness
and desirability or public convenience or necessity to be served against
any adverse conditions that would result from authorizing the particular
development at the location proposed and, in approving such use, shall
consider the following criteria, except that the board, in making its decision,
may waive those criteria it finds to be not applicable. In the case of
a use existing prior to the effective date of this title classified as
a special exception, a change in the use or in lot area or an addition
to or enlargement of structure shall conform to the requirements for a
special exception.
   A. Criteria for Consideration of Approval.
   1. Decisions of the circuit court for Wicomico County
and appellate courts of Maryland;
   2. The nature of the proposed site, including its
size and shape and the proposed size, shape and arrangement of structures;
   3. The resulting traffic patterns and adequacy of
proposed off-street parking and loading areas;
   4. The nature of the surrounding area and the extent
to which the proposed use might impair its present and future development;
   5. The proximity of dwellings, churches, schools,
public structures and other places of public gathering;
   6. Accessibility of the premises for fire and police
protection;
   7. Accessibility of light and air to the premises
and to properties in the vicinity;
   8. The type and location of adequate utilities,
access roads, drainage and other necessary facilities that have been or
will be provided;

of an existing special exception, the board may impose, in addition to
those standards and requirements expressly specified for a special exception,
additional conditions which it finds necessary to avoid any possible detrimental
impact on adjoining properties and to otherwise protect the best interest
of the surrounding area or the community as a whole. These conditions may
include, but are not limited to, the following:
   a. Limiting the manner in which the use is conducted,
including restricting the time a certain activity may take place and restraints
to minimize such environmental effects as noise, vibration, air pollution,
glare and odor;
   b. Establishing a special yard or other open space
requirement or lot area or dimension;
   c. Limiting the height, size or location of a building
or other structure;

of vehicle access points;
   e. Increasing the amount of street dedication, roadway
width or improvement of a parking area or truck loading area;

installation and maintenance;
   j. Designating the size, height, location and materials
for a fence;
   k. Protecting and preserving existing trees, vegetation,
water resources, wildlife habitat or another significant natural resource;

by the board shall constitute a violation of this title. (Prior code§150-296)

 Section 17.236.010 Purpose--Application. 
   A. The board, after public notice and hearing, may
vary the regulations of this title, in harmony with the purpose and intent
of this title, only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth, where
the board makes findings of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter
prescribed and further finds that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations
of this title.
   B. Application for a Variance. An application for
a variance shall be filed with the building inspector in accordance with
Chapter 17.17, Article II and shall be accompanied by such plans and data
as may be required by the board and its reviewing staff to assure the board
adequate information upon which it may consider the requested variance.
The building inspector shall forward such application and all relevant
data to the board. (Prior code§150-293)
 Section 17.236.020 Standards--Conditions. 
   A. The board shall not vary the regulations of this
title, as authorized in Section 17.236.010, unless it shall make its decision
based upon the evidence presented to it consistent with the following;
except that the board, in making is decision, may waive those items it
finds to be not applicable:
   1. Because of the particular physical surroundings,
shape or topographical conditions of the specific structure or land involved,
a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to the owner would result,
as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
regulations were to be carried out;
   2. The conditions upon which an application for
a variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is
sought and are not applicable, generally, to the property within the same
zoning classification;
   3. The practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship
is caused by this title and has not been created by intentional action
of any person presently having an interest in the property;
   4. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental
to or endanger the public health, security, general welfare or morals;
   5. The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively
upon a desire to increase the value or income potential of the property;
   6. The variance will not be injurious to the use
and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity nor substantially
diminish and impair property values in the neighborhood;
   7. The granting of the variance will not impair
an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or overcrowd the
land or create an undue concentration of population or substantially increase
any congestion of the streets or create hazardous traffic conditions or
increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public safety;
   8. The variance will not adversely affect transportation
or unduly burden water, sewer, school, park or other public facilities;
   9. The granting of the variance will not adversely
affect the implementation of the comprehensive plan for the city of Salisbury
approved by the planning commission and the city council or any other plan
approved by the planning commission or city council for development of
the area in which the variance is requested;
   10. Within the intent and purposes of this title,
the variance, if granted, is the minimum variance necessary to afford relief.
(To this end, the board may permit a lesser variance than that applied
for.)
   B. The board may impose such conditions and restrictions
upon the premises benefitted by a variance as deemed necessary to comply
with the standards established above, to reduce or minimize the effect
of such variance upon other properties in the neighborhood and to better
carry out the intent and purposes of this title. Failure to comply with
such conditions or restrictions imposed shall constitute a violation of
this title. (Prior code§150-294)
