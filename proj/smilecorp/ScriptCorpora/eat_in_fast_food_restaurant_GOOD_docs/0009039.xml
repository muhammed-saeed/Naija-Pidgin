 Opinion 
Quality of food - consistently excellent.
Value for money - consistently excellent, especially special offers.
Cleanliness - generally very good.
Quality and speed of service - generally very good.
Because one taco is a very light snack and one burrito a fairly light snack, each member of a party can easily order sufficient number appropriate to their level of hunger. Alternatively, a party can make a combined order and share.
