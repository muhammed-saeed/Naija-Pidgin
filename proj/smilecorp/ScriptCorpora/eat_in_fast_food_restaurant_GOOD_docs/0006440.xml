 Statement from Talisker 
 
 
PARK CITY—Park City Mountain Resort filed a lawsuit Friday against the company that owns much of the land where the popular ski resort operates.


PCMR has used land owned by Talisker Land Holdings LLC since 1971. PCMR reported that its lease with Talisker was set to expire in April, and it intended to extend for an additional 20 years. PCMR said it informed Talisker of its intentions multiple times since 2009, and made improvements believing the extension would be granted.


In December, however, Talisker informed the resort that the agreement would end in April.
 We need to protect the future of the company and our more than 1,200 employees, who bear a tremendous burden of uncertainty in this matter. –Jenni Smith, Park City Mountain Resort 

“After extensive and, sadly, unsuccessful negotiations, we reluctantly took the initiative to file this lawsuit,”said Jenni Smith, president and general manager of Park City Mountain Resort.“We need to protect the future of the company and our more than 1,200 employees, who bear a tremendous burden of uncertainty in this matter, and the many local businesses and homeowners in the greater Park City area. We are seeking relief through the court, the only option left at our disposal.”


For more than 40 years, the resort has leased much of the land on which the resort operates, including the Town Lift, the base area and all of the lifts near the base. The resort&apos;s rent was due in April, which officials paid on time and in full, said Krista Parry, director of communications for the resort.


In doing so, resort officials believed the lease would be renewed until 2031.


Over the summer, PCMR officials spent about $7 million on capital improvements at the resort. It wasn&apos;t until Dec. 27, 2011, that Talisker sent a notice stating that the lease had expired and owners needed to negotiate a new lease agreement.


&quot;We could not come to an agreement,&quot; said Parry. &quot;So we had to ask a judge to help us settle this quickly and fairly so we can move forward.&quot;
