 Industry: Food&amp;Beverage 
 
 Press 
 Release Summary: Healthy, Natural and Organic Foods are in demand 
 by the consumer, but current offerings are sorely lacking and quite 
 limited. We are bringing healthy to the vernacular of the fast food 
 industry. Organic food and local produce is in demand. Our restaurant 
 will not only be organic but green. Planet friendly design including 
 hydroponics on the roof. All takeout containers, trays, and tableware 
 will be made of the latest degradable technology. Unlike other plastic, 
 once degradation is complete, all that remains is carbon dioxide, 
 water and biomass, all of which are part of the normal bio-cycle. 

 Press 
 Release Body: The concern and demand for safe food has never been 
 higher. Americans are just plain tired about having to worry about 
 the latest contamination, E Coli or tampering scandal of the week, 
 and they have the right to be. This year has been especially troubling, 
 with all of the outbreaks, contamination, cloning&amp;genetic 
 altering stories in the media. Where will it all end? Our menu will 
 feature the nutritional value and the origin of all of our foods 
 and ingredients. Say goodbye to the days of mystery meats, poultry 
 and/or fish. Consumers will know what they are being served and 
 from where it arrived, period. And it will be food grown, raised 
 and farmed by and for Americans.... We have done extensive research 
 on the food industry for the last several years and we believe we 
 have found the solution to the lack of health-conscious fast-food 
 locations throughout the U.S. 

 The 
 solution is Health Food Hut , the countries first 
 Organic and All-Natural Fast Food Restaurant featuring 
 all- wild Alaskan seafood, organic beef and chicken, organic salads 
 and wraps, and much, much more. By eliminating the distributor, 
 and buying direct, we will be able to be price our meals within 
 reach of the casual fast-food buyer. The organic industry is growing 
 fast, and we are ready to do our part and strike while the iron 
 is hot... Health Food Hut will be unique in the 
 industry. A fast-food establishment that offers healthy alternatives 
 via in-store, carryout and drive-through purchases, comprehensive 
 retail meat and produce offerings and even home delivery. 

 We 
 also will be launching Save the Planet Organics . 
 Fresh cut produce, salads, and wraps in degradable green containers. 
 This will enable schools, restaurants, business, convienience stores,and 
 hospitals to introduce organic food to their menu or offerings. Quickgreens which will be a healthy green 
 drink with no mess. For those on the go. 

 We 
 have teamed up with industry giants to make our concept a complete 
 success.Visit our website for more info.
