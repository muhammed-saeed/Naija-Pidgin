 KFC! 

 Advantages: the tastiest chicken ever
 Disadvantages: not the healthiest option


...KFC is most certainly my favourite fast food restaurant, I just love the original recipe chicken with its amazing secret spice mix coating. 

My favourite meal has to be the variety meal with its two or three pieces of chicken, two hot wings, fries and a drink. I do like the burgers especially the fillet burger but I am always drawn to the original recipe chicken. 

KFC does tend to be a little more expensive than its rival fast food outlets such as McDonalds and Burger King but at least you know you are getting whole pieces of chicken and not mechanically reformed meat as with most burgers brought elsewhere. The average meal now in KFC tends to be around the 5 mark but they do offer cheaper options such as the mini fillet burger and the snack box. 

The variety of food on the menu as increased so much over the last few years. It...

Review of KFC 
 
 Finger licking good (KFC) 

 Advantages: Cheap and extremely tasty
 Disadvantages: My experience with poorly manned restaurants and manhanded food


...~~~KFC~~~
Kentucky Fried Chicken for those of you that have not heard of it is an American fast food chain that primarily sells chicken.

Near to where I live we have two KFC&apos;s that I often visit however during the last year I have to admit I have not visited them as often as I used to, hear is my thoughts on KFC:


~Location:
The nearest KFC to me is about 6.5 miles away or if I travel in the opposite direction there is another which is about 7.2 miles away. Unfortunately for me (as Im lazy at times) KFC does not deliver so Its about a 15 minutes journey in the car for me to get there.


~Ordering your food:
My nearest KFC has a drive thru so I have always visited this one apart from on one occasion.

Normally I join the queue for the drive thru because it less hassle and generally you get served quite quickly however after visiting...

Review of KFC 
 
 KFC - Finger looking good, or is it? 

 Advantages: Good price, nice chicken.
 Disadvantages: Chips are normally nasty, long queues, dirty tables to sit on.


...the right blend without being too over-powering, it has this delicious taste to it that just makes me want to go back for more time and time again! 

The chips are a real disappointment though and are pretty similar to McDonalds chips in that they are either over-salted, cold or both! But then I am enjoying the chicken and the corn on the cob too much to care about some cold chips! 

Another speciality of KFC is the bargain bucket and this is normally around 10 for which you will receive 8 pieces of chicken (cuts may vary), 4 chips and normally two side orders. There are different variations of the bucket meals and you might also get boneless chicken, popcorn chicken, mini fillet burgers, bottles of drink or even desserts such as vienetta and ice cream etc.

You can sit down or take away your food to eat wherever you feel like it. In my...
