I graded this based on the atmosphere of the mcdonalds rather than the food- because as we know, the food isn&apos;t very different across most mcdonalds.

going on that, i would say that the interior design of this place was impressive for a fast food restaurant. it is unlike most mcdonalds because i can tell someone came in to design the place. It gives you almost a Starbucks feel with the mocha colors and unique seating arrangements.

of course the food is pretty decent considering its a major fast food chain, but I would recommend coming inside this particular location to be pleasantly surprised at the environment and set up here:)

This place gets 1 star due to one of the employee&apos;s bad attitude.

This incident didn&apos;t happen to me. One of the guys in front of me did not get a receipt after he ordered. When he realized it, he asked the cashier (young, thin girl with light brown hair) for a copy of the receipt to know when they call his order number. This order number is only printed on the receipt. Anywho, some how the worker misunderstood him and started going off on him in front of all the other customers. I guess she&apos;d ditch school often, because even I understood him. Maybe she has a hearing problem or was on her rag?

Whatever the case, this 1 employee made that entire mcdonald&apos;s look ghetto. The mcgridle was ok btw.

Pretty fast service.
Oatmeal sucked...and one of the staff actually walked across the drive thru to get to her car...I&apos;m a very careful driver and I almost hit here. They could use sum safety training here and a large dose of common sense.

How can a Mc Donalds get a five star rating?  Because they are so CONSISTENTLY good time after time.  I stop here Sunday morning on the way to work and at least once a week I stop by here to pick up dinner for me and my co-workers.

They have the BEST little sausage burritos of all the Mc Donalds I have ever been to.  And the hashbrowns are nice crunchy...not soggy and greasy like they are at most other locations.  The service is always quick and friendly.  The inside is always clean.  I just love this Mc Donalds!

I have has the occasional missed item in my bag or a missing sauce here and there but over all this is the best fast food place around!

I gave this place 3 stars simply for the fact that is McDonalds.  Not based on the service or the quality of the food.  As a matter of fact, this place has some of the fastest service and friendliest staff.  And the food is as good as McDonalds can get.  A will give McDonalds props for bringing back the beloved cherry pies and for the McCaffes.

I went in for an Iced Latte which was great by the way, but my review is for one of the chicks that was working there yesterday afternoon. Damn was she hot. Did I mention that the Iced Latte was great.

This location is always nice and clean.  But then again, McD&apos;s seems to do a good job of keeping there resturants clean.  It&apos;s smaller than others but there&apos;s always a place to sit.  The crew works quick and they have the system down.  I only find they can sometimes mess up a breakfast order so always check before you leave.
