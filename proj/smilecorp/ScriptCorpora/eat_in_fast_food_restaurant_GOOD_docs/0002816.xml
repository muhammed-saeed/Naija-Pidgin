 Donairo&apos;s 33357 South Fraser Way, Abbotsford I had to go to Abbotsford to get great Donair?? By golfboy of Port Moody (11 Reviews) Submitted Thursday, June 21, 2012 - 4:03pm [Dine in] 
Well, I was in Abbotsford and needed a quick bite to eat for lunch. Being from the Vancouver area, I wasn&apos;t expecting a whole lot out in the valley and very nearly stopped into a Subway when I spotted Donairo&apos;s as I was driving along South Fraser Way. I thought, &quot;What the hell, I could go for a Donair&quot; and stopped in.

First impressions weren&apos;t great to be honest. There was nobody at the front and the and I had to yell towards the back before someone acknowledged me. I looked up at the menu board and was impressed at the variety offered and the reasonable prices, but then again I was in Abbotsford where gas was 12 cents a litre cheaper than Vancouver. I was expecting a small sandwich, not very filling, but able to hit the spot. They offer the typical donair sandwiches, but also shawarma plates that you normally only find in Ontario where everything is called shawarma instead of donair.

I went with the combination sandwich which was a combo of lamb and chicken. They also had combos of chicken and falafel, beef and chicken, and beef and lamb.

Then I was floored. After taking my order, the lady behind the counter started cranking out balls of dough and flattening them out with a machine. She then took the flattened dough, stretched it by hand, and placed it on a wooden stick to place in the oven. This place scratch makes their pita!! After coming out of the oven (in about 2 minutes) the pita was perfectly browned and bubbled, had a crisp outer crust but was still pliable to fold up...and it was HUGE! I got the works (they even offer hummous on the sandwiches which not a lot of other places do) and literally loaded up the sandwich with meat. The price included a can of pop and after paying I happily sat down at one of the tables along the front and began to eat. Wow. Fresh toppings, tender meat which wasn&apos;t too salty, and the pita....man oh man, heaven...quite honestly the BEST donair I have had on the west coast. I just might have to make my way to Abottsford more often.

 Crossroads Restaurant 1821 Sumas Way, Abbotsford Yuck By ralla of Abbotsford (1 Review) Submitted Wednesday, May 23, 2012 - 9:37pm [Dine in] 
We went to check out this place for dinner and had a awful experience. My sister&apos;s &quot;baked potato&quot; was not cooked all the way through, my friends &quot;cordon blue&quot; was a frozen dinner from Costco and the service was very poor. The restaurant was not busy so, thats not why the food was funny.

 Duke of Dublin 33720 South Fraser Way, Abbotsford Good Food Good Service By Eat out often of Abbotsford BC (1 Review) Submitted Saturday, May 5, 2012 - 12:59am [Dine in] 
Brought in a daily deal coupon from groupon or hungrybuy com and had a great time. We had 50% off our bill, which was extra nice. The server was very sweet and knew the menu well. She recommended certain dish that she likes. The food came out hot and tasty. There weren&apos;t many people there on that Wednesday. Was there once for dinner before but prefer lunch cause it&apos;s not so crowded.
Will definitely come back and highly recommend this place.

 Blue Collar Restaurant 2866 Mt Lehman Rd, #102, Abbotsford Blue Collar By Blue Collar Restaurant of Abbotsford BC (1 Review) Submitted Wednesday, February 29, 2012 - 3:31pm [Dine in] 
I took my family to this small restaurant after arriving to the Abbotsford airport and thought it would be just like any other fast food restaurant.

Boy was i wrong, i ordered the Big blue burger which must have been the biggest burger i have ever seen and liked at the same time. My kids and wife ordered breakfast etc. The coffee was fresh, the service was excellent and the food speaks for itself.

Its nice to see that there are still people that care about food excellence regardless of how tough our economy is.

I give this place a great rating and i encourage you to try it. Dont forget, BIG BLUE BURGER aka (MONSTER)

 ABC Country Restaurant 32080 Marshall Rd, Abbotsford Plan on WAITING and then more WAITING By lforrest of Unknown (3 Reviews) Submitted Sunday, February 26, 2012 - 1:29pm [Dine in] 
We will never eat at this ABC Restaurant again. It was my Grandma&apos;s birthday and she chose the location. We had a reservation for 6pm for 8 people. We were on time and our table was waiting. Our server took way too long to take our order. Although, she seemed to be doing her best and was pleasant enough, she was on her own with a busy large section. We sat down at 6pm and our food started arriving at 7:15pm!! This was after my husband went and spoke to the gentleman, presumed to be the manager. Later, I went to speak to him at 7pm and asked if he was the manager, he was actually the owner. Four of the 8 meals were brought out at 7:15 and the remainder a few minutes later. Three of us had requested gravy on the side. Only one came with it on the side. My turkey dinner was smothered in gravy and was the only hot item on the plate. My son&apos;s pasta meal looked like it had sat under heat lamps for a while. Although, our server offered complimentary desserts for the looong wait, it still did not make up for the inefficient, unsatisfactory service! Only a couple of our party had a dessert. The ice cream, I was told, tasted more like ice. The line up at the till to pay for the cheque was at least 10 deep! The cashier asked how everything was and I said, very unenthusiastically, &apos;it was ok&apos;. She didn&apos;t probe for more information but instead asked me what my plans were for the rest of the weekend. The owner has some serious work to do here. I recommend first that he have more staff working the tables and the kitchen.

 Dragon Fort Restaurant 2421 Pauline Street, Abbotsford I will never dine here again By hippixie of Chilliwack (46 Reviews) Submitted Tuesday, February 21, 2012 - 8:35pm [Dine in] 
This was not a good choice for Chinese food. Okay the place looked neat and clean, but as for the food forget it. I was not impressed at all, on a 1-10 scale (10 being the best) I rate it 2.5 - 3.
We ordered Spring egg rolls, they were fine but the sauce was a rather odd yellowish colour and there was only a scant amount in the serving dish for 2 of us to share.
The Honey garlic chicken wings were the biggest wings I&apos;ve ever seen, really did they come from super-sized chickens or chickens on steroids? They were marginally passable, deep fried with some sort of bottled sauce poured over top.
The pan fried rice noodles with beef in black bean sauce was not at all to our liking, the noodles were over-cooked, cut into little pieces and were soggy. The beef was okay but not very flavourful.
Breaded boneless chicken with tangy lemon sauce, well the amount of chicken under the thick breading was miniscule, and I doubt any real lemons were invloved in the preparation of the bland sauce.
Cashew nut sauteed diced vegetables - okay the veggies&amp;the cashews were crispy but the sauce was tasteless and the mushrooms were too large to eat in 1 bite.
Pineapple sweet&amp;sour boneless pork: Tough meat, over cooked and the sauce was thin and vinegary, I did not like the taste at all. One of the worst sweet&amp;sour sauces I&apos;ve ever tasted.
When the server asked how we liked the food and we were honest, I could tell she was offended, but really!
Well, if you ask a question and are not prepared for the answer maybe customer service is not the best job for you. She quickly turned and walked away rudely, we stated the food was not to the standard of our usual/favourite place and she made a snide remark also. The other servers were not so rude, just one.

So this is not the place to go if you want good Chinese food in Abbotsford.

 Old Spaghetti Factory 2030 Sumas Way, Abbotsford My Favourite Restaurant By kittybay of Abbotsford BC (3 Reviews) Submitted Saturday, February 11, 2012 - 4:48pm [Dine in] 
I have always loved the Old Spaghetti Factory and the Abby location doesn&apos;t disappoint. It&apos;s a good deal for the money and it&apos;s always yummy. The people are polite and the other guests always seem to enjoy themselves. I even went on my birthday once and when the server found out, he asked first before just showing up to sing at me, I said, Please Don&apos;t, and they didn&apos;t. Always appreciated!

 Tracy Cakes 2636 Montrose Avenue, #101, Abbotsford Cheap on the cupcakes By kittybay of Abbotsford BC (3 Reviews) Submitted Saturday, February 11, 2012 - 4:41pm [Take-out] 
I am a big fan of another cupcakes place but heard this place was supposed to be great! Not so much. When I saw how big the regular sized cupcakes were compared to the &quot;babycakes&quot; I was shocked. It&apos;s so small! For $3.64 including tax! What a rip off. And then, I get home to a terrible tasting cupcake. Not impressed, never going back. I will stick with my original favourite cupcake place.

 Dragon Fort Restaurant 2421 Pauline Street, Abbotsford Don&apos;t dine here By Foodloverinabby of Abbotsford BC (1 Review) Submitted Sunday, January 15, 2012 - 10:59pm [Dine in] 
Ate dinner here with friends we were celebrating my friends Birthday and found that if you have special needs they are not very helpful or flexible especially at dinner time, I found that the manager does not care about any issues you might have with the food or service. The curly red haired waitress that works there has an attitude problem and was a very uncaring attitude.

 White Spot 36035 North Parallel Road, Abbotsford wow service and wow food By henner of mission bc (1 Review) Submitted Sunday, January 15, 2012 - 12:13pm [Dine in] 
Wow what an amazing dining experience!!! From our first impression, our hostess was cheerful and so friendly. To outstanding service, knowledgeable staff and hot fresh food! The management here really care about your dining experience, even stopping by our table to make sure everything is how we ordered it, to how our server is treating us. Then she asked if there was anything SHE could do for us!!!
Wow ,now that was outstanding!

 Little Caesars Pizza 2070 Sumas Way, Abbotsford They will over charge you, and then blame the tax By kittybay of Abbotsford BC (3 Reviews) Submitted Monday, January 9, 2012 - 10:18am [Take-out] 
I have been overcharged twice, both times I ordered the $10 combo but was charged the regular $11 cost. When I mentioned it was too much, I was told that it was the hated tax that made it so much.
I also ordered Crazy Bread but when I got home, it was that disgusting cheesy bread they pass off as being popular. Disgusting thing to bite into.
I have used their online complaint form, twice, with absolutely no response, but according to their website, their food is &quot;guaranteed.&quot;
I will start going to Domino&apos;s.

 Sumas Sushi Cafe 2070 Sumas Way, #108, Abbotsford Ripped me off- watch out. By princess123 of poco (97 Reviews) Submitted Thursday, December 22, 2011 - 10:59pm [Dine in] 
I have been to this place quite a few times on my way through Abbotsford. It&apos;s not the best sushi around but not the worst. The service is fairly fast if not robotic. The sushi is average if not a bit fishy. I went the other day and had lunch. I paid on my Visa and she pretended that she was having some type of trouble with the machine. I had two small cheap rolls and a soup. It still came to $14 with tax - I didn&apos;t check at the time but that seems high. I left a cash tip so I did not add a tip to the machine. When I check the charge that went though on my credit card it was put through at over $17 so they somehow helped themselves to a tip. Pretty low. Watch your bill - I won&apos;t have to as I&apos;ll never go back.

 Greek Islands 33244 South Fraser Way, Abbotsford One of my favourite Greek places By dajusta of Richmond , BC (15 Reviews) Submitted Friday, October 28, 2011 - 12:47am [Dine in] 
I&apos;m a fan of Greek food so here&apos;s my break down of the place:

Roast Lamb - amazing as always. Comes with a mint jelly that you must try.
Tarama Dip - Nice and thick, kind of salty, but that&apos;s fine
Saganaki - VERY nice with the flambe action - a must if it&apos;s a special occasion
Mousaka - nice portion - could have been hotter though

Service was great, the place was very cozy, and the prices are reasonable.

Can&apos;t go wrong with this place!

 Finnegan&apos;s Pub and Phoenix Lounge 33780 King Road, Abbotsford Best Sliders ever By think3minutes of langley bc (1 Review) Submitted Thursday, September 22, 2011 - 1:56pm [Dine in] 
When here just before a concert and had the choice of buffet or menu. Everyone had at least two drinks and dinner. I ordered the mini sliders. Wow real beef taste, juicy and the tomato was the best ever and the pickle was to die for. Friends did the buffet and raved likewise. A little slow with the bill but that was cleared up quickly. Would go back again just to get the sliders.

 Maurya Bistro 2607 Ware Street, Abbotsford Destined for Domination! By Edwardian of Abbotsford BC (1 Review) Submitted Thursday, September 1, 2011 - 2:03pm [Dine in] 
Having lived in Abbotsford just shy of a year, I am constantly amazed at the quality (and quantity) of local dining establishments in this city. Aug 26th, my wife and I had just come home from our latest exciting culinary discovery: Maurya Bistro. Nestled just south of South Fraser Way, it seems Maurya could very well be one of this town&apos;s best kept secrets.

We were greeted at the entrance by the beaming and gracious Adeep who promptly found room for us in the cozy yet sleek dining room. Before even tasting the food, I marvelled at how easily the chairs glided back from the table-simple luxuries for simple folk, I guess. As my wife struggled to deny her eyes their inevitable backward roll, I reluctantly plucked myself from the throes of my own idiocy.On to the real point of this review: the food. We started with the Vegetable Pakora served with both Mint and Tamarind accompaniments. Wow. I can honestly say I have never, and by that I mean NEVER had pakoras this good. In my life. Ever. The mint variation was so clear it cut above all of the other tastes and stood it&apos;s own ground. The pakoras themselves were light, crispy, plentiful and bursting with flavour.

Our main course included a Pea Pilau (a pea and cumin rice blend suggested by Adeep), Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Marsala with Garlic Naan. The rice was the perfect compliment to our perfectly rendered entrees. The Tikka Marsala was rich, gorgeously coloured and generously portioned. The Tandoori came out sizzling and each bite was an earthy explosion of &quot;charbroiled&quot; (tandoori chicken is often referred to as India&apos;s version of barbecued chicken) goodness.My only regret is not having room for a dessert of Galubjamins, but thankfully Maurya&apos;s does not appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. Thanks very much to Maurya Bistro and our compliments to the chef!

 White Spot 36035 North Parallel Road, Abbotsford Many many meals Breakfast Lunch Dinner By Kenny j of Abbotsford BC (1 Review) Submitted Thursday, August 18, 2011 - 5:41pm [Dine in] 
The best White spot in Abbotsford. All the food the wife an I have had here has always been great fast and with friendly service.
Once my wife ordered a meal she was not sure of, her mistake when staff saw she was not eating the meal they offered to bring her something else for no charge, even after she told them it was her own mistake.
We have had 60 to 70 meals here and not one was anything but EXCELLENT!!
Our favorite is the appy NOBASHI Prawns with thia sauce.

 Midori Japanese Restaurant 31940 South Fraser Way, #2, Abbotsford Solid Sushi Joint By munchingalong of Abby (20 Reviews) Submitted Friday, July 8, 2011 - 9:43pm [Dine in] 
I was surprised that I liked this place. The interior is a bit drab and not all that inviting. But the food makes up for it. I had the gomaae which is normally doused in overly sweet spot (Yummy Sushi, I mean YOU) but not here. They actually serve the sauce on the side - why don&apos;t more places do that? It was tasty too - not too sweet.

The sashimi was as expected, if not slightly better. Not frozen unlike some places and the texture was good. They used wild salmon instead of atlantic farmed. Decent sized sashimi for Abbotsford. I had a tuna tataki roll too which was pretty yummy. It had more tuna inside with green bean tempura, a nice crunch. My friend had a great look sunomono - never seen one that big with so much stuff in it for such a low price. He also had a bomb roll (I think?) that I didn&apos;t try but he looked happy eating.

Service was friendly and prompt. Prices are average for Abbotsford. I&apos;ll be back.
