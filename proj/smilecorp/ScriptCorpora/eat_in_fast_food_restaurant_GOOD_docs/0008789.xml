 How you can help 
 
. Ways To Help The Lakota Youth in
Eagle Butte, SD 

   Adopt a child by taking a“Letter to-Santa”. We are looking for individuals, families, groups, schools, businesses or churches.. Buy at least one item from his/her list or as many as you choose.

 

 We also collect extra items. Teens will often not write a letter but do have wishes. We collect extra goodies for teens such as backpacks, clock radios, cool watches, CD’s, CD players, MP3&apos;s, extra batteries, perfume, cologne, warm gloves, and school supplies. Dairy Queen (the only fast food restaurant they have available) gift certificates also make wonderful gifts. 

 We collect personal care items ( see suggested list). They are appreciated by all. 

 New book for their library or gently used books.     

Any learning toys (especially LeapPad books).

Gently used children’s coats. Coats must have all the buttons and zippers must work

Used current prom dresses. We can use any size. We don’t mean to be picky but dresses must be what our daughters would want to wear to their homecomings and proms. There is a“Passion for Fashion Night”at the youth center before prom. The girls have a sleep-over and pick their dresses and work on hair and make-up
.
Check out the &quot;Cheyenne River Youth Project Passion for Fashion 2010 on YouTube to see what a wonderful project this is. 

 Used beds. We can always find a home where they are needed. The best are space savers, such as day beds and bunk beds. As many as 8 children may live in a tiny house. We can also use mattresses, box springs and bed frames in good condition. 

 Monetary gifts. Any extra funds will be used to buy gifts for the children. 

We also need: wrapping paper, gift bags, tape, bows, name tags and boxes. Parents will come in and wrap all the gifts we send to the center. 

 We can always use Gift Cards to JC Penney, Wal-Mart, Lowe’s, K-Mart and DQ. 

 All gifts are taken by truck to the youth center in Eagle Butte, SD. Free of charge! We would really appreciate receiving all gifts by December 4 th . We will be packing everything before the truck comes. Please check the website for schedule times the collection site will be open for drop offs or contact us to make special arrangements. If you wish to have a tax receipt please bring a copy of your receipts for the items you are donating if they are new or a list of the used items so that we may attach them to the tax receipts.
