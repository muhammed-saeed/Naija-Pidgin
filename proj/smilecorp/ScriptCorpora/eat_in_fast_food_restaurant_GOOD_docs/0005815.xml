Very Bad
 
One the worst experience ever in shore, Rooneys is to expensive, and the food is very bad. The service out of touch the need to be train first.

A big disappointment
 
Rooney&apos;s was a great disappointment. Prices are rediculous. They have a fixe prix fixe menu which is not presented when seated. I only was told about it when I inquired about something on the outrageous regular menu. The second course was brought to the table before the first course was finished. The view is great but you have to peer through the many flies that cover the windows.

Quite disappointed
 
My husband and I went to Rooney&apos;s this evening to celebrate our 13th anniversary, and there&apos;s no denying that the view is beautiful, BUT........once you open the menu and look at the prices - yikes! We had been there years ago, and around the time of our marriage it was a favorite place of my parents to take visitors from outside of the country. But something has changed, and not for the better I&apos;m afraid. The food was really nothing special, and I was most disappointed in MY meal which was a seafood risoto that was described as having lobster, shrimp, and scallops over a lobster risoto. The lobster was three small half tails, and getting the meat out was a real chore! For the price of this dish, I worked way too hard, and it wasnt even that enjoyable. Not surprisingly, the waiter never even asked if we enjoyed our meals - I&apos;ll bet he could see how I was struggling with those tails! Shared appetizer, shared beet salad, 2 entrees,&amp;1 glass of wine for $150+ with the tip! Not worth it!

Big disappointment
 
Went with 3 others at the suggestion of a friend....what a disappointment. VERY pricey for not so great food. The service was awful. My order was wrong and I had to wait an additional 30 minutes for my meal (nothing offered for the inconvenience). The only good thing is the view. Also, the ladies&apos; room was a disgrace....very dirty! For these prices, you would expect they could afford to clean the bathrooms!!!
