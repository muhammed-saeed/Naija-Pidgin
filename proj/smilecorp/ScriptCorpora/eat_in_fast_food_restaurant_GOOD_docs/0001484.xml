 Breaking News 
 April - June 2007 
 
 Discover ringing new era 
 By Michael Sean Comerford 
 Daily Herald Suburban Chicago
June 30, 2007 

As Discover Financial Services Chief Executive 
 Officer David Nelms waited Friday morning to ring the opening bell 
 at the New York Stock Exchange, he reached for the ceremonial gavel.

I think they were afraid I was going to adjourn 
 (the day), Nelms joked after successfully pushing a button that 
 rings the opening bell.

From the opening bell on Monday, when Discover 
 begins trading publicly on the exchange, Nelms will learn how 
 different it is to run a public company with an estimated market 
 capitalization of $14 billion and one listed on the Standard&amp;Poors 500 index list.

The Riverwoods-based companys move to go public 
 means another Fortune 500 company for the Chicago area.

Discover was created by Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck 
 and Co. in 1986 with the innovative cash-back for purchases concept. 
 Dean Witter Discover broke away from Sears in 1993 and merged with 
 Morgan Stanley in 1997.

Some analysts say the difference between running a 
 unit of New York-based Morgan Stanley and running a public company 
 will be striking.

It wont be boring said Michael Kon, analyst at 
 Chicago-based Morningstar Inc., an equity research and financial 
 services firm. Im expecting lots of strategic moves from Discover 
 in the next two years.

In an interview with the Daily Herald, Nelms said he 
 expects the changeover to a public company will bring a renewed 
 focus to the business.

One possibility for the company is an increase in 
 alliances around the world, mainly in Europe. Discover already has 
 international alliances, such as with China Union Pay, enabling 
 Discover users to use Discover credit cards in China.

In the move to go public, Morgan Stanley 
 shareholders will get one Discover share for every two Morgan 
 Stanley shares. When-issued trading last week varied in value from 
 $28 a share to $32 a share. Such pre-trading often is an indicator 
 of the stocks price when issued.

I think it is pretty fairly valued now, said 
 Jeffrey Harte, a managing director of Sandler ONeill + Partners in 
 Chicago, when Discover when-issued trading dipped below $30.

Nevertheless, Discover has its critics.

Calyon Securities analyst Craig Maurer put a sell 
 rating on its shares.

Years of under-investment, poor strategic decisions 
 and poor portfolio performance left Discover in a weak competitive 
 position, he wrote in a position paper.

Analysts say Discover is a difficult company to 
 price because it is a credit card issuer that also has a payment 
 side and an ATM network, Pulse EFT.

Anything that helps one side helps the other, 
 Nelms said.

Analysts also note Discovers size and growth rate 
 as problematic issues.

Although the fourth largest credit card brand and 
 sixth largest issuer with $51 billion in credit-card loans, it is 
 less than half the size of Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase&amp;Co. and Citigroup.

Kon said Discover has had trouble gaining acceptance 
 with mid-sized and small retailers, who have to pay for access.

They arent in the restaurants and the barber shops 
 where people use their credit cards, Kon said.

Nelms said that may change thanks to Supreme Court 
 ruling earlier this year that allows Discover to bundle its services 
 with Visa and MasterCard.

Discover shares may also get a psychological boost 
 from last years initial public offering of MasterCard. The payments 
 processor went public at $39 a share and closed Friday at $165.87.

In the longer term, it is widely held belief that 
 Discover could become a takeover target in about two years, when 
 spin-off tax penalties wind down.

I wouldnt be surprised if someone buys Discover, 
 whether it be a private equity firm, a payment processor or a bank, 
 Harte said.

Nelms balks at that idea.

Were a sizable enough company to stay 
 independent, Nelms said. I dont see a need to be part of a bigger 
 institution.
 
 
 

 Sorting through top 100 
 By Sandra Guy Chicago 
 Sun-Times
June 29, 2007 

 Chicago&apos;s old-time retailers are still among 
 the biggest in the country, even under new owners and in 
 radically different formats. 

 Yet they face tougher competition than ever 
 and faster-growing rivals, according to experts who spoke prior 
 to today&apos;s release of the list of&quot;Top 100 Retailers&quot;by 
 revenue. 

 Sears, Walgreen, McDonald&apos;s and the 
 out-of-state owners of Macy&apos;s (formerly Marshall Field&apos;s), 
 Carson Pirie Scott&amp;Co., and Jewel and Dominick&apos;s grocery 
 stores earned spots on the list, which is being released today 
 by STORES, a retail trade magazine. 

 The list shows Sears is the largest retailer 
 headquartered in the Chicago area, though it dropped two spots 
 from last year to land at No. 6. During the 1990s, the Hoffman 
 Estates-based retailer, run by hedge fund billionaire Edward 
 Lampert, stood at No. 2 or No. 3 in the rankings, but with 
 smaller revenues. 

 Susan Reda, executive editor of STORES 
 magazine, said she believes Sears has&quot;big strides to make to 
 stay No. 6 on our list.&quot;She said she remains unsure about 
 Sears&apos; off-mall superstore format, and she questioned Sears&apos; 
 decision to put its valuable Craftsman and Kenmore brands in 
 Kmart stores. A Sears spokesman said the retailer has designed 
 its Sears Grand stores so shoppers will frequent the stores more 
 often, and its best brands are now accessible to more shoppers. 

 Next is Walgreen at No. 7, the Deerfield-based 
 drugstore giant whose stores seem to pop up on every corner. 

 Walgreen&apos;s rival, CVS, appears at No. 9. 

 Next, at No. 10, is Safeway, the 
 California-based owner of Dominick&apos;s grocery stores, which has 
 had surprising success with its Lifestyle store format, 
 featuring fresh produce displayed in baskets, a proprietary&quot;O&quot;organics brand, and upgraded deli, bakery and flower shops. 

 Supervalu, the Eden Prairie, Minn.-based owner 
 of Chicago market-leader Jewel grocery stores, appeared at No. 
 12, with $28 billion in sales. 

 Experts say traditional grocery stores, 
 despite their healthy numbers, will continue to lose market 
 share in the next five years to supercenters,&quot;fresh&quot;stores 
 such as Whole Foods and specialty stores such as Trader Joe&apos;s, 
 Aldi and Save-A-Lot, according to a report released this week by 
 the Food Institute and Barrington-based consulting firm Willard 
 Bishop. 

 Reda said consumers are growing tired of 
 supermarkets&apos;&quot;pile it high and let them buy&quot;strategy. 

 Other stores with local significance include 
 Macy&apos;s, owner of Macy&apos;s and Bloomingdale&apos;s, at No. 13, with $27 
 billion in revenues; McDonald&apos;s at No. 16 with $21.6 billion; 
 J.C. Penney at No. 17 with $19.9 billion; Kohl&apos;s at No. 23 with 
 $15.5 billion; Nordstrom at No. 39 with $8.6 billion, and 
 Carson&apos;s owner, Bon-Ton, at No. 86 with $3.45 billion in 
 revenues.

 TOP 10 U.S. RETAILERS 

 1. Wal-Mart, $348.7 bil.
2. Home Depot, $90.8 bil.
3. Kroger, $66.1 bil.
4. Costco, $60.1 bil.

 Price-Floor Ruling May Have Small Effect 
 Mark-Ups Are Most Likely For High-End 
 Products; 
 Antitrust Door Left Open
 By Gary McWilliams, Joseph 
 B. White and Jess Bravin Wall Street Journal
June 29, 2007 

 PRICING POWER 

 The News: In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court 
 ruled that manufacturers can set and enforce minimum prices for 
 their products.
 The Background: The ruling upends a nearly 100-year-old ban on 
 many price agreements.
 What It Means: Economists and many marketers say that most prices 
 will still be set by give-and-take between buyer and seller. Legal 
 experts say the government could still bring antitrust cases where 
 price agreements are shown to reduce competition.


Yesterday&apos;s Supreme Court decision allowing 
 manufacturers to set and enforce minimum prices for their products 
 upends a nearly 100-year-old ban on price agreements in American 
 retailing, but experts say it isn&apos;t likely to upset pricing 
 practices for autos, electronics, books or shampoos.

The decision, a 5-4 ruling that split conservatives 
 and liberals, lifts the threat of an automatic antitrust suit where 
 price agreements are found, but doesn&apos;t require such agreements nor 
 does it permit anticompetitive behaviors. Legal experts say the 
 Justice Department could still bring cases where agreements are 
 shown to reduce competition.

Jeremy Bulow, a former chief economist at the 
 Federal Trade Commission and now a professor of economics at 
 Stanford University&apos;s graduate school of business, said that&quot;as 
 much as I hate to go along with the conservatives on the court, I 
 think they got it right.&quot;A minimum price could give makers of 
 sophisticated new products a chance to fund training or other 
 services. Since the court left open the door to antitrust action if 
 the agreements protect or fuel a monopoly, consumers are still 
 protected, he said.

Historically, manufacturers and retailers have 
 danced between two court decisions that have guided product pricing 
 and the power of a manufacturer to control distribution. The 1911 
 Dr. Miles precedent, named after a seller of patent medicines, 
 decreed price restraint agreements illegal. Eight years later, the 
 Supreme Court said in its Colgate doctrine that manufacturers were 
 free to unilaterally set a price and choose to refuse sales to any 
 retailer that violated the set price -- so long as the two weren&apos;t 
 directly tied.

The rulings led to a tension between manufacturers 
 wanting to thwart discounters from setting the price of their 
 products, and retailers that saw volume efficiencies through low 
 prices as their way to increase their profits. The result is a long 
 history of advertisements listing discounts from the MSRP, or 
 manufacturer&apos;s suggested retail price, and online prices that hid 
 the discounted price behind a&quot;click now&quot;button.

Some critics, including the Supreme Court&apos;s 
 minority, said manufacturers may be able to raise prices across the 
 board in the wake of the ruling. They fear the ruling undermines 
 advances in logistics and low-cost operations that have allowed some 
 companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to deliver lower prices on 
 everyday goods to consumers. Now, they say a manufacturer could 
 negate such advantages by cutting a deal with a higher-cost retailer 
 in exchange for exclusivity or some other benefit to the 
 manufacturer. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to comment.

But economists and many sellers say that for most 
 sales, whether cars, big-screen TVs or everyday items, pricing will 
 still be set by the give-and-take between buyer and seller.&quot;If you 
 raise the price, you sacrifice volume,&quot;says Jeremy Anwyl, chief 
 executive of Edmunds.com, an automobile pricing service. Only in 
 certain cases, such as high-end goods, will an impact be felt, say 
 experts. In the case of exotic makers, such as Bentley or Mercedes, 
 these companies already control prices by limiting supplies, says 
 Mr. Anwyl.

Auto dealers could get around minimum price 
 requirements for vehicles where demand is weak and inventories high, 
 for instance, by paying more for a trade-in, he says.&quot;One way or 
 the other dealers will adjust pricing to the market or sales will 
 stall,&quot;he says.

Makers of books, toiletries and towels also could 
 find it difficult to flex their new pricing muscle with retailers 
 such as Wal-Mart or Target Corp., for fear of losing their business. 
 Just as Wal-Mart bargains hard for what it pays for merchandise, it 
 will be able to bargain with manufacturers to keep its discounts, 
 say retail experts.

Chet Flynn, president of Necessities Inc., a 
 Norwell, Mass., distributor of home-theater systems, says a lack of 
 price discipline by big-screen TV makers has already contributed to 
 a painful consolidation of consumer electronic retailers. He says 
 such consolidation has limited consumers&apos; retail choices more than 
 price agreements. Other companies, including high-end audio supplier 
 Bose Corp., already strictly enforce their pricing policies.&quot;Bose 
 knows better than dealers how much money they need to keep the doors 
 open,&quot;he says.

Mallory B. Duncan, general counsel of the National 
 Retail Federation, says the court&quot;put a light thumb on the scale&quot;to benefit some retailers and not others. But he argues that the 
 overall effect is slight. Manufacturers are still barred from 
 enforcing anticompetitive policies. In the past, any agreement was 
 automatically considered anticompetitive behavior, he said. The new&quot;ruling gives the other side a chance to show there might be a 
 competitive advantage to preventing retailers from selling products 
 at a lower price.&quot;

Not everyone agrees with his sentiment.&quot;Of all the 
 [recent] Supreme Court antitrust decisions, this is going to 
 significantly change business practices and make life a lot harder 
 for discounters,&quot;says Kevin Arquit, a partner with the law firm 
 Simpson Thacher&amp;Bartlett LLP and a former director of Federal 
 Trade Commission&apos;s Bureau of Competition. Auto makers, for instance, 
 may try to enforce minimum prices, in part because it&apos;s unlikely any 
 single player in the highly competitive auto industry could be said 
 to have&quot;market power&quot;to control pricing, says Mr. Arquit.


Constance E. Bagley, associate professor of Business 
 Administration at Harvard Business School, says,&quot;The real losers in 
 this are the consumers.&quot;She says retailers may be forced to sell 
 products at higher prices, or to strike a deal with one seller to 
 drop competitive products. Either way, it would hurt the consumer, 
 she says.

Justice Stephen Breyer, who often has sided with 
 business interests, dissented, along with Justices John Paul 
 Stevens, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Breyer argued 
 that there was nothing new in the economic literature to justify 
 overruling a century-old precedent that American manufacturers and 
 retailers had long understood.

&quot;The only safe predictions to make about today&apos;s 
 decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail 
 and that it will create considerable legal turbulence&quot;as lower 
 courts examine a plethora of various pricing agreements, he wrote.

But even those who believe the decision is 
 anticonsumer say the market will resist efforts to raise prices. 
 Patrick Byrne, CEO of discount Web retailer Overstock.com Inc., 
 calls the ruling&quot;a bad decision,&quot;but insists manufacturers won&apos;t 
 be able to impose a minimum price on sites such as Overstock.com.&quot;Manufacturers need a channel like ours to exist,&quot;he said.

 Machine age 

 Factory-built components playing a larger role in home construction 
 By Leslie Mann S pecial 
 to the Chicago Tribune
June 29, 2007 

 If the term&quot;prefabricated house&quot;conjures visions of double-wide trailer homes, think again. 

 Today&apos;s factory-built houses run the 
 gamut from log chalets as massive as their boulder fireplaces to 
 rambling, farmhouse-style residences that look like they&apos;ve been in 
 the family for generations. 

 Although houses built&quot;on site&quot;(also 
 called&quot;stick-built&quot;) still comprise the majority of today&apos;s new 
 houses, prefabs are gaining ground. About 30 percent of today&apos;s new 
 houses are at least partially built off-site, according to Building 
 Systems magazine. This is up from 10 percent a decade ago. 

 The prefab house isn&apos;t a new idea. 
 Catalogs, including those of Sears Roebuck and Co., sold thousands 
 of them prior to World War II. 

 Lustron Corp. made steel houses in 
 the 1940s that are architectural collector&apos;s items today. And 
 renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright dabbled in the prefab concept 
 in the 1950s. 

 But&quot;prefab&quot;and&quot;high-style&quot;didn&apos;t 
 find themselves in the same sentence until recently. 

 Now manufacturers offer factory-built 
 homes and components in a wide range of price points and 
 architectural styles, plus customization. 

 &quot;Prefab&quot;is an inclusive industry 
 term that refers to houses made completely or partially in 
 factories. 

 &quot;Modular&quot;houses are comprised of 
 box-like sections that are trucked to the job site, then hoisted 
 into place by cranes. 

 &quot;Kit&quot;houses are the modern-day 
 versions of the Sears houses; they arrive unassembled with 
 instruction books. 

 Prefab, modular and kit houses are 
 built according to local building codes that are enforced where they 
 will be erected. So in some cities, that may mean they are a no-no. 

 Mobile homes, on the other hand, have 
 been called&quot;manufactured houses&quot;since 1976, when the Department of 
 Housing and Urban Development building code that regulates them went 
 into effect. They are built entirely in a factory and hauled to the 
 site. 

 &quot;I call mine a &apos;poor man&apos;s Mies van 
 der Rohe,&apos;&quot;says artist Marian Anderson, describing her 
 1,400-square-foot kit building that serves as her studio in South 
 Haven, Mich. 

 Built in 2005 near her lakeside 
 house, she uses the kit house as a place to make sculptures. Clad in 
 glass, it echoes van der Rohe&apos;s revered minimalist houses. 

 Purchased from Perryville, Mo.-based 
 Rocio Romero LLC, Anderson&apos;s studio has a steel-post-and-beam frame. 

 Inside, she ditched bedroom walls in 
 favor of a large, sunlit space. She figures she spent about $120,000 
 on the project, including labor to construct it and to dig the crawl 
 space under it. 

 Rocio Romero, the company&apos;s 
 principal, says she&apos;s seeing prefab houses appear across the U.S., 
 after they were embraced in California years ago. 

 &quot;When I first started in 2003, there 
 was a huge learning curve,&quot;says Romero.&quot;Now buyers get it.&quot; 

 &quot;The industry has matured,&quot;reports 
 Tom Beers, vice president of the National Modular Housing Council in 
 Arlington, Va.&quot;It&apos;s been growing every year except in &apos;07, when new 
 housing has been down overall.&quot; 

 Prefab manufacturers don&apos;t compete 
 with traditional builders, Beers said. Rather, they supplement their 
 businesses because most prefab home buyers hire contractors to erect 
 their houses. 

 &quot;The builders tend to be small 
 builders who build on scattered sites, as opposed to large ones that 
 build big developments,&quot;added Beers. 

 The advantages of building prefab 
 benefit both the builder and the homeowner, says Beers. 

 &quot;Material cost is lower because the 
 manufacturer can buy in bulk and labor cost is lower because it 
 takes less time to erect the structure,&quot;he says. 

 Because the prefab house is built in 
 less time than its stick-built counterpart, the homeowner can avoid 
 additional costs such as carrying two mortgages or renting while 
 waiting for the new house to be completed. 

 &quot;The whole assembly took two weeks,&quot;says Julian Guerrero of the prefab house he and his wife Nancy had 
 built in north suburban Park City in 2003.&quot;We sat in lawn chairs 
 and watched.&quot; 

 The Guerreros&apos; 2,100-square-foot 
 ranch arrived via truck in three modules from Hi-Tech Housing in 
 Bristol, Ind., then was assembled by R.J. Construction from Twin 
 Lakes, Wis. Counting their full basement and labor, they estimate 
 they spent $200,000. That includes extras such as a skylight and 
 whirlpool tub. 

 &quot;The craftsmanship is awesome,&quot;says 
 Guerrero.&quot;It has 2-by-6 insulated exterior walls, so our gas bills 
 are lower than those of neighbors with stick-built houses.&quot; 

 Indeed, many prefab home 
 manufacturers tout the&quot;green,&quot;or Earth-saving, aspects of their 
 products. 

 Mifflinburg, Pa.-based Ritz-Craft 
 Corp., for example, makes all its homes Energy Star-compliant. 
 Modular manufacturers say their methods produce less waste for 
 landfills. And, it is in their best interests to minimize 
 transportation costs, which translates into less use of fossil 
 fuels. 

 Kit houses made by Enertia Building 
 Systems in Raleigh, N.C., employ envelopes of air between their 
 all-wood exterior and interior walls. The houses become their own 
 heat pumps, extracting warm air from underground. 

 Buyers of prefab log structures have 
 long recognized the green aspect of their homes. 

 &quot;The logs soak up the heat in the 
 summer, so we rarely use air conditioning. In the winter, the logs 
 hold the heat in and we use the furnace less,&quot;says Conrad Golonka 
 of the kit log house he bought from Expedition Log Homes in 
 Oostburg, Wis., in 2001. 

 &quot;This house is bigger than our old 
 house but our utility bills are lower,&quot;he said. 

 Built in St. John, Ind., the Golonka 
 house has 3,000 square feet. 

 Meanwhile, back at Chicago-area 
 cornfield subdivisions, many builders of stick-built houses are 
 using more factory-built components. 

 These include SIP (structural 
 insulated panels) walls, roofs and floors. SIPs are sandwiches of 
 OSB (oriented strand board) or plywood on the outside and foam on 
 the inside. They arrive with window and door openings already cut 
 out. They can hold in more heat or cooling than traditionally 
 insulated walls. 

 Other builders use walls, floors and 
 ceilings that are pre-cast of concrete. These are especially popular 
 in hurricane-prone areas. Like SIPs, they are joined together on the 
 job site. 

 &quot;Panelized&quot;houses are made of 
 factory-built walls, floors and roofs that are fastened at the job 
 site. The term&quot;panelized&quot;typically means the sections are made of 
 wooden studs. But steel frames also are made in factories and 
 shipped to job sites. The latter can span wider lengths because of 
 its greater strength. . 

 Thanks to computer-aided design, 
 prefab houses now can be tailored to fit rugged terrain, too, 
 thereby junking the notion that they are all flat boxes plunked down 
 on empty lots. 

 Mark and Peter Anderson&apos;s book,&quot;Prefab Prototypes: Site-Specific Design for Offsite Construction,&quot;shows prefabs that dangle from cliffs, hug hills and hide among 
 treetops. 

 &quot;You can&apos;t tell a prefab from a 
 stick-built one,&quot;says Guerrero.&quot;But I think you get a better-built 
 house for less money. I encourage other people to consider it.&quot;
 

 
 

 Wal-Mart 
 still retail&apos;s big kahuna; Sears slips 
 By Jennifer Waters, 
 MarketWatch
June 29, 2007 

 CHICAGO (MarketWatch) -- Sears 
 Holdings Corp., whose namesakes stores were once the most powerful 
 in the U.S., lost ground this year in the industry&apos;s annual tally of 
 the 100 top retail chains. 

 The parent (SHLDsears hldgs corp com 
 (SHLD ) of Sears Roebuck and Kmart stores fell to No. 6 on the 
 National Retail Federation&apos;s Stores magazine list released Friday, 
 losing two places to Costco Wholesale and Target Corp. 

 Those discount retailers took the 
 fourth and fifth spots, moving up a notch in the past year in the 
 list. Rankings are determined by total sales. 

 &quot;Sears is the one to watch,&quot;said 
 Stores&apos; Executive Editor Susan Rada.&quot;It didn&apos;t fall dramatically, 
 but I don&apos;t know what to expect from Sears anymore.&quot; 

 Sears Holdings catapulted to a top-10 
 spot two years ago when the two retailers were brought under one 
 corporate umbrella. But sales growth has been sluggish, while 
 competitors have seen their top lines expand at a faster clip. 

 In fiscal 2006, for example, Sears 
 Holdings sales climbed 7.9% to $53.01 billion while Target&apos;s jumped 
 13.1% to $59.49 billion and Costco&apos;s leapt over that with a 13.6% 
 increase to $60.15 billion. 

 Hefty as those revenues might be, 
 they still paled in comparison to the perennial top-of-the-heap 
 retailer, Wal-Mart Stores (WMTWal-Mart Stores, Inc
The parent of Wal-Mart and Sam&apos;s Club stores rang up $348.65 billion 
 in sales last year, eclipsing all other companies in the world, 
 according to Fortune&apos;s list of the top 500. 

 In the retail world, Wal-Mart&apos;s 
 revenues are so high that they exceed those of the next five largest 
 retailers combined.&quot;Aggregate revenues for the companies on the 
 Stores Top 100 list are just over $1.6 trillion,&quot;the magazine said.&quot;Wal-Mart accounts for nearly 22% of that total.&quot; 

 Holding on to the No. 2 and No. 3 
 places - spots they&apos;re not likely to lose anytime soon - were Home 
 Depot, the world&apos;s largest home-improvement retailer, and Kroger 
 Co., the nation&apos;s largest grocery-store business. 

 &quot;The same three at the top of the 
 list is a sign of resiliency in retail,&quot;Rada said.&quot;Even though 
 these three get beat up sometimes and have their share of problems 
 ... they still continue to innovate and still continue to address 
 customer needs.&quot; 

 Rounding out the top 10 in order were 
 Walgreen Co., Lowe&apos;s Cos., CVS Corp. and Safeway Inc. 

 Best Buy moved up to the 11th 
 position after its sales jumped 16.5% last year to $35.93 billion.
Supervalu took a big leap to 12th with a 163.4% surge in sales, 
 thanks to its acquisition of Albertsons. 

 Also losing ground this year was 
 Limited Brands and its 26.2% pop in sales to $10.71 billion at No. 
 32 and Jean Coutu Group, the Canadian-based drug-store chain whose 
 revenues more than doubled to $11.14 billion through its Rite Aid 
 acquisitions. 

 At least some of the movement on the 
 chart came from this year&apos;s addition of restaurants to the list. 
 Rada said restaurants such as McDonald&apos;s Corp. at No. 42, among 
 others, were counted in because of their striking importance in the 
 consumer-spending picture. 

 &quot;Restaurants are taking an increasing 
 portion of the consumer-spending dollar, and that is something we 
 need to consider,&quot;she said.&quot;Quick-service and casual restaurant 
 brands are on par with brand names we frequently refer to in 
 retail.&quot; 

 Moreover, the reigning trend in new 
 retail centers is lifestyle centers that mix big-name stores with 
 restaurants and other forms of entertainment on a more manageable 
 scale than most shopping centers and malls. 

 &quot;Lifestyle retailing is growing at 
 the expense of traditional malls because it&apos;s more in sync with the 
 way the customer shops today,&quot;she said.

 Chains try inside move 
 By Sandra M. Jones - staff 
 reporter Chicago Tribune
June 29, 2007 

 At 4 Kmarts scattered across the U.S., 
 Sears Holdings Corp. is allowing Sears &apos; dealer stores&apos;   to set up shop within 
 and sell goods not usually found at the discount retailer 

 In the past year, Sears Holdings 
 Corp. has been moving its best Sears brands into Kmart in an effort 
 to reach more shoppers and jump-start years of declining sales. 

 First Craftsman tools and DieHard car 
 batteries appeared on Kmart shelves. Then roughly one out of every 
 10 Kmarts began selling Kenmore appliances. 

 Now, in the boldest move yet, the 
 retailer is experimenting with putting free-standing Sears stores 
 inside of Kmart. 

 The discount chain is renting about 
 7,000 square feet inside existing Kmarts to Sears dealers in four 
 towns -- Claremont, N.H.; Freedom, Calif.; Pell City, Ala.; and 
 Zephyrhills, Fla. -- carving out a separate entrance and hanging a 
 Sears sign over the door. The dealers sell hardware, appliances, 
 lawn equipment and some consumer electronics. 

 The combination comes closer than any 
 effort to date in merging Sears and Kmart into one entity, a process 
 many investors were skeptical would happen after hedge-fund investor 
 Edward Lampert engineered Kmart Holding Corp.&apos;s acquisition of 
 Hoffman Estates-based Sears, Roebuck and Co. more than two years 
 ago. 

 &quot;We thought it was going to be more 
 of a land bank story than an operating story, but the operating 
 story has been surprisingly strong,&quot;said William Dreher Jr., a 
 Deutsche Bank Securities analyst in New York who rates the stock a&quot;buy&quot;and who owns Sears shares. 

 Sears has a network of 822 so-called 
 dealer stores, run by entrepreneurial-minded business owners. They 
 are well-versed in selling big-ticket items such as refrigerators 
 and lawn tractors, products foreign to Kmart. And they have 
 incentive to generate sales. 

 The dealers have invested their own 
 money into the Sears business. Although Sears owns the merchandise 
 and sets the prices, the dealers pay operating expenses and receive 
 sales commissions. 

 Inside of Kmart, the dealers continue 
 to operate as they always have, but rent payments go to Kmart 
 instead of the landlord, lowering the Kmart store&apos;s overhead costs 
 and in turn helping profits. And, if all goes as planned, the 
 higher-income customers that go into Sears to buy a lawn mower or 
 dishwasher will wander into Kmart and do some shopping. 

 Putting dealer stores inside of Kmart 
 also is a way to boost sales without investing a lot of money in the 
 stores, a textbook Lampert strategy. 

 Sears calls the move a test and plans 
 to expand it, CEO and President Aylwin Lewis told shareholders at 
 the company&apos;s annual meeting in May. 

 &quot;All indications are that it&apos;s 
 something we will take a look at,&quot;Steve Titus, vice president and 
 general manager of dealer stores for Sears, said in an interview 
 last week. 

 If successful, the experiment could 
 go a long way in helping Lampert&apos;s efforts to fix the two troubled 
 retailers. 

 When Lampert took control of Kmart in 
 bankruptcy court, he turned the retailer around by selling real 
 estate and cutting costs. As Sears&apos; chairman and its largest 
 shareholder, with a 43 percent stake, Lampert has not sold much 
 Sears real estate but has still managed to improve profits by 
 cutting overhead costs and trimming capital spending. 

 But without the asset sales, 
 Lampert&apos;s strategy is starting to reveal limitations. 

 Slipping sales eat 
 at profit 

 After holding steady for two years, 
 sales at Kmart stores open at least a year fell 4.4 percent in the 
 first quarter of fiscal 2007, as the company reported in May, 
 hurting overhead expenses and cutting into total profits. Same-store 
 sales at the Sears chain fell 3.4 percent, dragged down by a what 
 Sears called&quot;a notable decline&quot;in home appliance sales, which are 
 facing increased competition from Home Depot, Lowe&apos;s and Best Buy. 
 Home appliances accounted for about 15 percent of Sears Holdings&apos; 
 revenue in fiscal 2006, or about $8 billion. 

 &quot;Recent missteps have left investors 
 wondering if this is a temporary stumble or a sign that cost savings 
 are drying up,&quot;wrote Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Adrianne 
 Shapira, who rates the stock a&quot;neutral&quot;in a June 13 report. 
 Shapira predicts profit improvement will return but warns it&quot;could 
 be somewhat choppy given that success increasingly hinges on 
 top-line results.&quot; 

 Sears Holdings&apos; net income came 
 within its predicted range for the first quarter, but after removing 
 one-time gains and charges, Dreher estimates profits from continuing 
 operations fell slightly. 

 On Thursday, shares closed at 
 $168.53, up 46 cents, but that&apos;s a 12.6 percent decline from its 
 record close of $193 on April 17. Still, shares of the merged 
 company have increased 28.5 percent since closing at $131.11 on 
 March 28, 2005, the first day of trading as Sears Holdings. 

 A chance to 
 minimize rivalries 

 Sears established the dealer stores 
 in 1993 after shutting down its legendary Big Book catalog. The 
 stores, many of them former catalog outlets, gave Sears a way to 
 reach rural Americans who lived far from a traditional Sears store. 
 But since Kmart bought Sears in March 2005, scores of Sears dealers 
 compete directly with Kmart. Craftsman tools and DieHard batteries, 
 products once exclusive to Sears, now are available at the more than 
 1,300 Kmart stores. About 180 Kmarts sell Kenmore appliances, and 
 more stores are on the way. 

 &quot;You need to have a 3 to 4 percent 
 sales increase each year just to keep up with the overhead,&quot;said 
 Thomas A. Redington, a former Washington, Mo., Sears dealer.&quot;If 
 Kmart sells the same products where you had an exclusive, you lose 
 volume.&quot; 

 About 200 dealers banded together in 
 June 2005, shortly after the merger, and sued Sears for infringing 
 on their territory. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying in 
 essence that Sears had individual contracts with each dealer, not 
 the group as a whole. 

 By sharing customer traffic, both 
 stores could benefit. 

 &quot;If you want a tractor, Kmart walks 
 the customer over to the Sears dealer store,&quot;Titus said.&quot;If 
 someone wants a smaller microwave than the built-in microwaves the 
 dealer sells, the customer walks over to Kmart.&quot; 

 Sears undertook a similar strategy at 
 its department stores with Lands&apos; End. Sears bought the preppy 
 direct-mail business in 2002 with the hope that selling the upscale 
 clothing inside of Sears department stores would attract 
 higher-income consumers. 

 But the initial execution faltered. 
 Lands&apos; End, a higher-priced line that rarely went on sale, hung on 
 racks next to Sears&apos; promotional in-house brands. The presentation 
 confused the traditional Sears shopper and lacked cachet for Lands&apos; 
 End fans. 

 Lands&apos; End fared better after Sears 
 carved out a separate&quot;store&quot;for the brand. The company tested the 
 in-store shops in a handful of Sears stores before rolling them out 
 to 100 stores last year and plans to have Lands&apos; End shops in 200 
 stores this year. 

 &quot;It&apos;s like what they did with Lands&apos; 
 End to drive traffic into Sears,&quot;said Love Goel, chairman and CEO 
 of Growth Ventures Group, a Minnetonka, Minn.-based retail 
 investment firm.&quot;They&apos;re trying to use appliances to drive traffic 
 to Kmart.&quot;
 

 

 High Court Eases Ban 
 Minimum Prices 
 By Christopher S. Rugaber 
 Associated Press Forbes.com
June 28, 2007 

 Manufacturers will have greater 
 leeway to set prices at the retail level without violating antitrust 
 laws under a Thursday Supreme Court ruling that could hurt consumers 
 and small merchants. 

 By allowing minimum price agreements, 
 the court&apos;s 5-4 decision could lead to higher prices, dissenting 
 justices said, as it becomes more difficult for smaller stores and 
 Internet retailers to offer lower-priced goods. 

 The court said agreements on minimum 
 prices are legal if they promote competition, meaning accusations of 
 antitrust violations will be evaluated case by case. 

 In a 1991 decision, the Supreme Court 
 had declared that minimum pricing agreements always violate federal 
 antitrust law. But Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority 
 opinion that the principle that past decisions should be left alone&quot;does not compel our continued adherence&quot;in this instance. 

 Minimum price agreements can benefit 
 consumers, Kennedy wrote, by enabling retailers to invest in greater 
 customer service without fear of being undercut by discount rivals. 
 The agreements also could make it easier for new products to 
 compete, he added, because a retailer could recoup the costs of 
 marketing a new good by charging a higher price. 

 Dissenting from that view, Justice 
 Stephen Breyer wrote:&quot;The only safe predictions to make about 
 today&apos;s decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at 
 retail.&quot; 

 The Consumer Federation of America 
 said in court filings that the ban on minimum price agreements 
 allowed&quot;innovative retailers to continually enter the market, 
 offering new and lower priced alternatives to consumers.&quot; 

 But Roy Englert, an antitrust 
 attorney at Robbins Russell, said the court&apos;s decision does have 
 boundaries that will protect entrepreneurs. The ruling only allows 
 minimum price agreements between manufacturers of a single brand of 
 a product and retailers, Englert said, while other brands of the 
 same product can still compete on price. 

 Moreover, if only one brand is 
 available, retailers and consumers can still sue manufacturers for 
 anticompetitive conduct, Englert said. The courts will now evaluate 
 such suits on the merits, rather than automatically finding them 
 illegal. 

 Englert helped prepare a brief in 
 support of Leegin. 

 Some antitrust experts say consumers 
 shopping on the Internet will be hurt by abandoning the 96-year-old 
 rule. 

 Richard Brunell, director of legal 
 advocacy for the American Antitrust Institute, said price floors 
 pose little risk to large chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (nyse: 
 WMT - news - people ) because&quot;it is no longer the new kid on the 
 block&quot;and has sufficient clout to get whatever products it wants 
 without any price restrictions. 

 Today, incumbent retailers like 
 Wal-Mart actually might find price floors to be an effective tool 
 against Internet discounting, Brunell said. 

 In recent decades, the Supreme Court 
 has chipped away at what many economists traditionally regarded as 
 vital consumer protections against anticompetitive conduct. For 
 example, exclusive dealer territories and setting price ceilings are 
 no longer automatically unlawful. 

 The current case involves Leegin 
 Creative Leather Products Inc., based in City of Industry, Calif. 
 The company entered agreements with retailers setting minimum prices 
 for the Brighton brand of women&apos;s fashion accessories. 

 Leegin said that by maintaining price 
 consistency among niche retailers it sells to, businesses can offer 
 improved customer service. This enables smaller stores to compete 
 against rival brands sold by discounters, Leegin argues. 

 Several retailers in Dallas selling 
 Leegin&apos;s products lowered prices below the minimum. family operated 
 Kay&apos;s Kloset said it followed suit to stay competitive. Phil and Kay 
 Smith say that when they refused to raise prices back up, Leegin cut 
 off their supply. 

 Kay&apos;s Kloset sued and the Smiths won 
 a $3.6 million judgment following a trial that laid out details of 
 the price floor arrangement between Leegin and many of its 
 retailers. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower 
 court&apos;s finding. 

 Joining Kennedy in the majority were 
 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence 
 Thomas and Samuel Alito. With Breyer in dissent were Justices John 
 Paul Stevens, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 

 The case is Leegin v. PSKS, 06-480.
 

 

 
 Foolish Book Review:&quot;You Can Be a Stock Market Genius&quot; 
 By Jim Mueller 
 The Motley Fool.com
June 26, 2007 

 Investor and author Joel Greenblatt 
 sure comes up with some quirky ways to address investing. In his 
 2006 book, The Little Book That Beats the Market, he touted a magic 
 formula based on two strong value investing pillars. In his earlier 
 book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius, published in 1997, the title 
 alone is enough to throw people off. I can, huh? Pull the other one; 
 it&apos;s got bells on. 

 That title sounds absurd because 
 conventional wisdom says that individual investors cannot beat the 
 market or professional investors. In the opening chapters, though, 
 Greenblatt goes to some length to explain why the small investor -- 
 without portfolios totaling hundreds of millions or billions of 
 dollars --has an advantage over professional investors. One, we can 
 stay focused. We don&apos;t have to invest in our eightieth or hundredth 
 best idea, but we can stay within our best 10. Two, we can judge 
 ourselves on a much longer time scale than next quarter. Three, we 
 can afford to wait for that fat pitch, that situation that will have 
 an outsized impact on our portfolio. 

 The rest of the book highlights some 
 of the situations Greenblatt has found in his investing career that 
 can lead to outsized returns. He starts off with a relatively simple 
 area of investing, spinoffs. By looking at several case studies, he 
 shows why investing in this type of corporate restructuring can lead 
 to good things. 

 The spinoff 
 opportunity 

 One reason is that the value of the 
 underlying business becomes clearer after it sheds some of its 
 divisions. For instance, in 1992, Sears spun off its Dean Witter 
 (now a part of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS)) and Allstate (NYSE: ALL) 
 businesses. Based on the market prices of those two businesses and 
 the market price of Sears itself, one could calculate that the 
 retail business that Sears was back then was priced at only $5 per 
 share, for a business doing $79 per share in sales -- drastically 
 undervalued. It wasn&apos;t until the masking effects of Dean Witter and 
 Allstate were removed that the overall market was able see this. 
 Within the next several months, the price of Sears rose 50%. 

 In an interesting follow-up to the 
 above story, Morgan Stanley is now spinning off Discover (to be 
 listed as NYSE: DFS), obtained with its 1997 merger with Dean 
 Witter, as a separate company on June 30. Those who like 
 Greenblatt&apos;s chapter on spinoffs should take note. 

 Greenblatt then ranges a bit further 
 afield, discussing risk arbitrage and mergers, bankruptcies, 
 warrants and options, and other related areas. While most people 
 have witnessed a spinoff or even experienced one firsthand -- as 
 shareholders of Disney (NYSE: DIS) recently did -- the other areas 
 discussed in this book are a bit less common. This, Greenblatt 
 feels, is part of their charm; where fewer people play, the chance 
 of a mispriced opportunity is higher. 

 Not for everyone 

 Now whether or not the average 
 investor should use these more out-of-the-way types of investing is 
 a topic for debate. But the general lesson holds true -- for 
 potentially high returns, look in areas where others are not and 
 employ a margin of safety. 

 Despite its tease of a title, this 
 book is not for beginning investors. Not taking the time to learn 
 and understand the situation can lead to poor results. And even 
 then, bad things can happen, as Greenblatt himself admits. For 
 instance, when he discusses the risks inherent in risk arbitrage 
 investing, he writes: 

 When deals fall apart, it&apos;s always 
 unexpected. There&apos;s just no point in putting yourself, your money, 
 and your stomach through the hassle. If you still want to run around 
 the house with scissors, go ahead. But there are easier, and safer, 
 ways to make a buck. 

 You can make a lot of money sticking 
 to the tried and true method of investing long and holding good 
 companies for many years. However, if you are a more experienced 
 investor looking for other areas to invest part of your portfolio 
 in, this book will give you several new places to explore.
 

 

 Retiree Health Access 
 Posted by: HR Policy 
 Association
 June 23, 2007 

 HR Policy Association to offer a 
 first of its kind retiree health insurance offering for pre- and 
 post-65 retirees. 

 Beginning January 1, 2008, 
 participating companies in the Association will be able to offer 
 their retirees access to comprehensive, guarantee issue health 
 benefits through the Retiree Health Access (SM) program. 

 Finding guaranteed access to 
 affordable retiree medical health care coverage, especially for 
 pre-65 retirees who are not yet eligible for Medicare, presents a 
 vexing problem for large employers, their retirees, and their 
 families. Accounting rule changes in the early 1990s (FAS 106 
 obligations) required employers to begin to account for future 
 retiree medical obligations. This and skyrocketing health care costs 
 have made it fiscally impossible for many employers to continue 
 paying for retiree coverage at previous subsidy levels, and FAS 106 
 discourages others not currently offering coverage from doing so. 

 Against the backdrop of difficult 
 economic and social forces, Retiree Health Access offers a unique 
 solution by providing access to a fully-insured, pre- and post-65 
 retiree medical solution that will be available to retirees 
 regardless of their health status or their employer&apos;s level of 
 premium contribution. 

 Retiree Health Access was developed 
 for the Association by the Health Care Policy Roundtable, LLC. 
 Following a rigorous selection process, Aetna was chosen as the 
 carrier to provide this unique offering because of its willingness 
 to work creatively with the members of the Association. Jeffrey C. 
 McGuiness, President of HR Policy Association, said,&quot;With Retiree 
 Health Access, we tried a different approach to health care reform 
 -- help the marketplace understand what the consumer wants instead 
 of settling for what is currently on the shelf. We&apos;ve definitely had 
 a breakthrough by getting a guarantee from Aetna that all retirees 
 can get access to comprehensive insurance regardless of health 
 status. The key question now is if we can make this affordable for 
 retirees regardless of how much their employer subsidizes coverage.&quot; 

 Association Chairman and Senior Vice 
 President, Human Resources for IBM Corporation, J. Randall MacDonald 
 said,&quot;The past system of offering retirees medical benefits has 
 proven difficult to maintain and cost prohibitive for many 
 employers. This Association recognizes that new solutions are needed 
 if companies are to remain economically competitive, and it is 
 committed to developing ways to create affordable and accessible 
 retirement options for workers.&quot; 

 Retiree Health Access features 
 significant advantages for employers and their retirees: 

 -- Guaranteed-issue comprehensive 
 coverage: Employees considering retirement are primarily concerned 
 with securing coverage that protects their assets against 
 significant health care costs. Retiree Health Access guarantees 
 access to an array of comprehensive coverage options for individuals 
 who enroll at retirement are regardless of their health status. 

 -- Fully insured solutions: Aetna has 
 agreed to bear the risk of Retiree Health Access through a fully 
 insured arrangement. 

 -- Coverage for pre- and post-65 
 retirees: Employers need a retiree health insurance solution for all 
 their retirees -- early retirees (those younger than 65, the age of 
 Medicare eligibility) and Medicare eligible retirees -- and Retiree 
 Health Access is the first program of its kind to offer a 
 comprehensive, fully insured, guaranteed-issue coverage for both 
 categories of retirees. 

 -- Flexible employer contribution: 
 Retiree Health Access is available to retirees of participating 
 employers regardless of how much their employer contributes to their 
 premiums. 

 -- Comprehensive administrative 
 support: Retiree Health Access allows employers to take advantage of 
 comprehensive administrative support, minimizing resources that 
 employers would need to provide retiree benefits while giving 
 retirees all the support that they need. 

 -- Built in incentives for aggressive 
 disease management: Because Retiree Health Access is being offered 
 as a fully insured product, Aetna bears the insurance risk and has a 
 direct incentive to aggressively promote effective disease 
 management and healthy lifestyle decisions among enrolled retirees. 

 HR Policy Association, established in 
 1957, consists of chief human resource officers representing nearly 
 250 of the largest corporations in the United States. From nearly 
 every major industry sector, HR Policy members have a combined

 skyrocketing health care costs in the United States and deficiencies 
 in efficiency and quality, the Association has been working through 
 its public policy agenda and market reform initiatives to address 
 the problems that plague our nation&apos;s health care system.
 

 

 Atlanta 
 developer outlines plans for Sears site 
 By Kevin Duffy - Atlanta 
 Journal-Constitution
June 26, 2007 

 In 15th century Italy, the powerful 
 Medici family supported artists and scholars during a period of 
 great cultural flowering the Renaissance. 

 Now, developer Emory Morsberger is 
 thinking along the same lines with his huge City Hall East 
 redevelopment project in Midtown. 

 Morsberger wants to attract leaders 
 in science, academics and the arts to the mixed-use project he&apos;s 
 spearheading, Ponce Park. So he&apos;s proposing creating the&quot;Medici 
 Center&quot;at Ponce Park housing for thinkers. 

 &quot;We&apos;re going to superheat their 
 interaction to create new ideas,&quot;Morsberger said at a recent 
 meeting of the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit organization of 
 land use professionals and businesspeople.&quot;Maybe they&apos;ll think of a 
 different way to cure AIDS.&quot; 

 Medici Center residents would work at 
 the various universities in the metro area, at the Centers for 
 Disease Control and Prevention, and at arts organizations. 

 Morsberger, an Emory University 
 history graduate, said he foresees 300 to 500 teachers, scientists 
 and artists some retired living permanently, or for a short 
 time, at Medici Center. 

 They could rent, use it as a hotel or 
 own; some might pay below-market rates, he said. Details are still 
 being worked out. 

 Last year, Ponce Park LLC, a 
 consortium of developers, including the Morsberger Group, bought the 
 old Sears, Roebuck and Co. store and distribution center on Ponce de 
 Leon Avenue for $33 million. 

 Roughly 1,000 city employees are 
 still using the building, one of the Southeast&apos;s largest at nearly 2 
 million square feet. They are scheduled to move out in September 
 2008. 

 Most are police and fire employees 
 who will head to a new public safety building under construction on 
 Garnett Street downtown. The rest will go to other locations, 
 according to the city. 

 The developers plan to take control 
 of the property in October 2008. As early as 2010, the first units 
 could be for sale, Morsberger said. 

 Redevelopment of the Sears building 
 is the showiest portion of a much larger transformation of the area bounded by Ponce, Glen Iris Drive, Ralph 
 McGill Boulevard and the old Norfolk Southern rail line. 

 The bigger picture includes creating 
 a park of 20 to 40 acres with a small lake. Parcels for the park are 
 still being put together. 

 Across from the Sears site, Lane 
 Development and Investment LLC will build Ponce Park South on North 
 Avenue. That project will contain approximately 415 residential units and 12,500 square feet of retail. 

 South on Glen Iris, Wood Partners is 
 building more than 300 apartments and condos at the site of the old 
 National Linen Service building, which was razed. 

 At the Sears site, structures that 
 were added to the original 1926 monolith will be demolished, and six 
 new buildings are planned. One is slated to be 14 stories of living space on the proposed Beltline, the 
 historic 22-mile-long loop that someday may provide intown rail 
 service. 

 The main entrance to Ponce Park will 
 be a wide piazza on North Avenue, big enough for motorists and 
 pedestrians. Parking for 2,000 vehicles will be built, but only 
 about 100 parked vehicles will be visible from the street, said 
 David Laube, Morsberger Group vice president. 

 Ponce Park and Ponce Park South 
 together, close to a $500 million investment when all is done will 
 end up being home to approximately 3,000 new residents. Other nearby 
 projects could boost that figure to more than 5,000.&quot;We envision a 
 number of Nobel laureates living here,&quot;said Morsberger, utterly 
 serious.
 

 

 Keeping Early Retirees 
 Afloat 
 By Milt Freudenheim 
 New York Times
June 23, 2007 

 What with years of layoffs, employee 
 buyouts and sending jobs offshore, corporate America has helped 
 create a pool of about 800,000 early retirees who now find 
 themselves in a health care bind. 

 They are no longer eligible for 
 employer insurance programs, too young to qualify for Medicare and 
 unable to afford private insurance on their own. 

 But now corporate America, having 
 created the problem, is trying to help solve it. 

 A group of some of the nations 
 biggest companies plans to announce today a program meant to make 
 health insurance available to their former employees ages 55 to 64. 

 Not only would the insurance policies 
 be relatively affordable, but no one could be turned down for 
 coverage, regardless of medical condition. That is a crucial 
 provision, because high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer and 
 other medical afflictions of late middle age can make it hard for 
 early retirees to find an insurer willing to cover them at any 
 price. 

 The specifics will vary from employer 
 to employer, with some companies helping subsidize the coverage. 
 Other employers might simply create large pools of retirees, making 
 them eligible for discounted group rates. 

 Typically, the policies will carry a 
 moderately high annual deductible perhaps $500 to $1,100 or so in 
 out-of-pocket medical expenses before coverage kicks in. The 
 retirees monthly premiums will range from $400 to $1,200 or more, 
 depending on whether the employer defrays part of the cost. 

 That is significantly lower than what 
 people in this age range can expect to pay, if they can find 
 individual insurance at all. 

 If I have had a triple heart bypass, 
 theres not a snowballs chance of getting coverage in the 
 individual market, said Richard J. Lueders, who oversees benefits 
 at the big Michigan utility DTE Energy, a member of the employers 
 committee that created the program. 

 The sponsor, the HR Policy 
 Association, represents 250 large companies, including General 
 Electric, I.B.M., Sears, Starbucks and United Parcel Service. 
 Although the association says it does not know how many total early 
 retirees there are among its members, a few of the bigger companies 
 have tens of thousands, while some newer technology businesses have 
 none. 

 The HR Policy group acknowledges that 
 its effort can probably not help more than a small fraction of the 
 800,000 pre-Medicare retirees currently without insurance or 
 others among the nations more than four million people in the 
 55-t0-64 age group who are not working and may be at risk of losing 
 insurance if the costs continue to soar. 

 People in that precarious category 
 include Larry Little, a 58-year-old retiree in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. 
 Little spent 32 years as a tire factory worker but is having trouble 
 keeping up with the rising premiums of the insurance offered by his 
 former employer, Continental Tire North America. 

 I was just getting by on my 
 pension, said Mr. Little, whose monthly pretax income is $1,740. 
 Now with these costs an extra $500 a month Im using up my 
 savings. 

 Continental Tire North America is not 
 part of the HR Policy Association, so Mr. Little would not be helped 
 by that groups new program. 

 In fact, in 2008, during the HR 
 Policy programs first year, no more than about 20 of the member 
 companies are expected to offer the new health coverage. But many 
 others are considering joining for 2009, according to the groups 
 president, Jeffrey C. McGuiness, who said he was not yet free to 
 identify the participants until they told their own people about the 
 program. 

 United Parcel, however, has said it 
 is among those planning to participate. 

 Despite the programs limited reach 
 the HR Policy group hopes it can help shape and influence the 
 national debate on health care reform, said Ronald A. Williams, the 
 chief executive of Aetna, the big insurer that will administer the 
 coverage. 

 If the effort seems a change of heart 
 for corporate America, in some ways it is. 

 Since the early 1990s, when new 
 accounting rules forced companies to start reducing their profits to 
 reflect the future costs of retiree medical benefits, many have 
 simply stopped providing such coverage. Early retirees, who even in 
 the best of times were not widely eligible for health benefits, have 
 been especially hard hit. 

 These days, only 18 percent of large 
 employers still contribute to the cost of health benefits for 
 retirees younger than 65. That is down from 30 percent in 1993, 
 according to a 2006 survey by the Mercer Health and Benefits 
 consulting firm. But some companies now see the drawbacks of 
 treating older employees and retired employees primarily as a 
 financial liability if only because of the signal it sends to 
 workers still on the payroll in the prime of their careers. 

 This is a burning issue for 
 corporations, said J. Randall MacDonald, a senior vice president at 
 I.B.M., which has 30,000 early retirees. Employees have become 
 increasingly concerned. 

 With many companies now facing 
 shortages for certain types of skilled employees, many want to keep 
 or recruit experienced people by saying we can give you access to 
 coverage when you retire, said Helen Darling, the president of 
 the National Business Group on Health, another organization of large 
 employers. 

 And even among companies that may 
 still be eager to move older workers to retirement before age 65, 
 some employers see the virtue of not letting health benefits be a 
 reason for an employee to cling to his or her job long after losing 
 interest in the work itself. 

 Maybe of most significance, the new 
 HR Policy program, to be called Retiree Health Access, will in many 
 cases cost relatively little for employers. 

 Aetna has agreed to offer the 
 policies in part because the big employers are able to amass large 
 enough pools of early retirees to help spread the risks and costs of 
 insuring people of an age susceptible to major medical expenses. 

 The new program will help companies 
 stay in the retiree medical game, Mr. Lueders said. His company, 
 DTE Energy, has already been providing health coverage for about 
 3,000 early retirees, mainly from its Detroit Edison unit. 

 Preliminary versions of the program 
 have received an unpublicized two-year trial run at several big 
 employers, including United Parcel. 

 As the program proceeds beyond the 
 experimental stage, United Parcel plans to start offering about 
 6,000 nonunion early retirees and their spouses a range of options, 
 including a safety-net catastrophic coverage policy, said Al Rapp, 
 United Parcels corporate health manager. Such policies typically 
 cost less than fuller coverage because they pay only for major 
 illnesses and injuries. 

 Aetna, which already covers more than 
 1.5 million retirees in traditional employer health plans, hopes to 
 keep costs down for the new plans through medical management 
 programs that advise and monitor people with chronic problems like 
 diabetes and heart failure, said Mark T. Bertolini, an Aetna 
 executive vice president. 

 General Motors, an HR Policy 
 Association member that has been closing production lines and 
 pushing thousands of workers into early retirement, is studying the 
 program, said Bruce E. Bradley, G.M.s director of health care 
 strategy and public policy. 

 This could be important in improving 
 both the G.M. picture and the national picture, as a contribution on 
 the issue of the uninsured, he said. 

 G.M. has been staggered by its 
 current health benefit obligations to more than 430,000 retirees. 
 But nonunion employees hired at the company after 1993 a category 
 that happens to include Mr. Bradley were no longer promised 
 retiree health benefits. Instead, they received money through a 
 tax-deferred savings plan. 

 I can spend it on anything I like, 
 he said. But if General Motors adopts the new Retiree Health Access 
 program, Mr. Bradley, who is 62, could make that money go a lot 
 further by buying into it. 

 For me, Mr. Bradley said, it would 
 be a soft landing.
 

 

 Macy&apos;s Shares, Options Soar on Takeover Speculation 
 By Danny King and Allen Wan 
 Bloomberg.com
June 22, 2007 

 Shares of Macy&apos;s Inc., the second- 
 largest U.S. department-store chain, rose the most in more than a 
 year and stock-option volume soared on speculation the company may 
 be bought. 

 There is talk of a private-equity 
 buyout this weekend at $52 a share by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts&amp;Co. 
 and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said Marc Weinberger, head trader at 
 W. Quillen Securities in New York. At that price, the company would 
 be valued at $23.9 billion. 

 Macy&apos;s spokesman Jim Sluzewski said 
 the company doesn&apos;t comment on market speculation. David Lilly, a 
 spokesman for KKR, and Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally 
 declined to comment. 

 The former Federated Department 
 Stores Inc., based in Cincinnati, changed its name to Macy&apos;s this 
 month. 

 The shares rose $2.56, or 6.6 
 percent, to $41.43 at 4:06 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite 
 trading, the largest jump since November 2005. 

 Trading in call options to buy the 
 shares surged to a record 121,312, more than 35 times the 20-day 
 average. The price of the most actively traded contracts, July $42.5 
 calls, jumped 16-fold to $1.70 from 10 cents. 

 Each call option gives investors the 
 right, without the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a company at a 
 specified price by a given date. A put conveys the right to sell 100 
 shares. Put volume also reached a record 12,332, a ninefold rise. 

 Sears Holdings Corp. is the biggest 
 U.S. department store chain.
 

 

 At Wal-Mart, a 
 Back Door Into Banking 
 By Michael Barbaro and Eric 
 Dash New York Times
June 21, 2007 

 Wal-Mart failed to get approval for a 
 bank. But the giant discount chain is effectively building one 
 anyway. 

 Wal-Mart said yesterday that it would 
 rapidly expand the financial services offered in its vast network of 
 stores, extending the reach of its retailing empire into its 
 shoppers wallets and the traditional turf of the American banking 
 industry. 

 Over the next year, the company plans 
 to introduce a prepaid debit card, intended for low-income 
 consumers, and install money centers which currently offer check 
 cashing, bill paying and money order services into at least 1,000 
 stores, up from 225 now. 

 The moves are seen as a precursor to 
 even wider offerings, like mortgages and home equity loans, which 
 could turn Wal-Mart into a significant force in the banking world. 
 Jane J. Thompson, the president of Wal-Mart financial services, 
 called the prepaid cards and money center services foundational 
 products that the retailer would build upon. Our concept is to go 
 up the credit ladder of financial services, she said in an 
 interview. 

 The introduction of such services is 
 something of an end run around the federal government, which was 
 considering Wal-Marts application to open a bank last year when the 
 retailer withdrew its bid. The new products, like the prepaid debit 
 card, will be offered through third-party partners, allowing 
 Wal-Mart to sell banklike services without a government license. 

 Given Wal-Marts penchant for 
 squeezing costs out of every business it enters from changing oil 
 to dispensing prescription drugs the move is expected to jolt the 
 financial services industry. 

 With plans for 875 new money centers 
 by the end of 2008, Wal-Marts presence would be roughly equivalent 
 to Citibanks in the United States, and its daily foot traffic would 
 dwarf that of most credit unions, check-cashing outlets and 
 convenience stores. While it may not immediately threaten those 
 businesses, Wal-Marts pricing power and proximity may give it an 
 advantage in serving the tens of millions of consumers who do not 
 have a checking account or are unlikely to set foot in a bank. 

 At the same time, the moves could 
 help bolster the retailers sagging sales by giving low-income 
 customers, who represent much of its business, another reason to 
 shop at its stores. The logic behind a lot of these services is to 
 increase traffic and do it in a way that puts money in peoples 
 hands, said Andrew Dresner, a payments industry consultant at 
 Oliver Wyman Financial Services. You give them a couple hundred 
 dollars, when they cash their paycheck, and they will buy other 
 things. 

 But the services themselves will also 
 aid Wal-Marts bottom line. Ms. Thompson said that Wal-Marts 
 financial services products provide healthy margins, and that she 
 expects the overall business to grow 30 to 40 percent over the next 
 year. 

 Much of what Wal-Mart announced 
 yesterday will be directed at consumers who do not use banks. 
 Wal-Mart says, for example, that 20 percent of its customers about 
 27 million people do not have checking accounts. The so-called 
 Wal-Mart Money Card, to be issued with GE Money, a division of 
 General Electric, would allow customers to transfer their paychecks 
 directly onto their cards and make purchases at any retailer that 
 accepts Visa cards. It will also allow them to check their balances 
 online or on mobile phone, pay certain bills or withdraw cash from 
 A.T.M.s. 

 The prepaid card will initially cost 
 $8.95, and comes with a $4.95 monthly maintenance fee. Cash can be 
 loaded on the card free by cashing a payroll or government check at 
 Wal-Mart or having the money directly deposited; otherwise, 
 cardholders must pay $4.64 to reload it. 

 Those without a bank account can 
 finally take advantage of more mainstream financial services, Ms. 
 Thompson said. It also could position the retailer to offer new 
 services, like an interest-bearing savings feature that Ms. Thompson 
 said Wal-Mart was considering. 

 Analysts said there was ample 
 evidence that Wal-Mart would lower the costs of banking in the 
 United States. The chain has already cut the cost of cashing checks 
 by 50 percent, and its financial services saved customers $245 
 million last year, according to company executives. 

 Wal-Mart has never hidden its banking 
 ambitions, but it has arguably masked them from time to time. In 
 2005, Wal-Mart said it would seek permission to open a bank in Utah 
 that would process credit and debit card transactions for its 4,000 
 American stores. At the time, it vowed that it would never use the 
 bank to enter the consumer financial services business. 

 Nevertheless, opposition to its 
 plans, which required the approval of federal regulators, swelled. 
 Dozens of banking and corporate watchdog groups testified at 
 hearings outside Washington. 

 In mid-March, Wal-Mart abruptly 
 abandoned those plans. Instead, company executives said they would 
 begin aggressively rolling out new financial products through 
 third-party partners. Wal-Mart already offers a Discover credit card 
 (through a similar partnership with General Electric) and money 
 transfer services (through a partnership with MoneyGram.) Now, many 
 in the financial industry say that mortgages and other types of 
 consumer loans may be next. 

 Although Wal-Mart would still be 
 barred from collecting customer deposits, the new services would 
 effectively allow the retailer to offer its customers a small suite 
 of financial products just like a credit union or small local 
 bank. 

 Of course, opposition may well 
 re-emerge. Ronald K. Ence, vice president for Congressional 
 relations at the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade 
 group, said Wal-Marts intentions suggest that the company misled 
 the public when it said repeatedly that it did not plan to enter the 
 consumer banking business. 

 Clearly this was their intention all 
 along, he said. The proof is in the pudding.
 

 

 Wal-Mart Expands Financial Services, 
 Plans to Sell Debit Card From Visa 
 By Mike Barris Dow 
 Jones Newswire
June 20, 2007 


Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced a broader push into 
 financial services, saying it will open 1,000 Wal-Mart MoneyCenters 
 by the end of 2008, and begin selling a Visa debit card under its 
 own name.

Wal-Mart now operates MoneyCenters at 225 of its 
 4,000 U.S. stores. The centers offer customers low-cost money 
 services, including check cashing, money orders, bill payment and 
 money transfers. The number now will double to 450 by the end of 
 this year and then more than double again to 1,000 by the end of 
 2008, Wal-Mart said.

&quot;Many of our customers are paying too much, 
 traveling too far and not being well served,&quot;Wal-Mart Financial 
 Services President Jane Thompson said.&quot;But they still need to pay 
 their bills, cash their checks and transfer money. We&apos;re offering 
 them a safe place and a card to help them manage their money. We&apos;ve 
 seen firsthand what a difference that can make. It changes lives.&quot;

The focus on check cashing, bill payment and other 
 nonbanking services is key for the Bentonville, Ark., retailer as it 
 attempts to find ways to bolster its sales expansion amid a pullback 
 in its construction of new U.S. stores. State-and-federal regulators 
 have stymied Wal-Mart&apos;s attempts to get into banking. In March, 
 Wal-Mart dropped its pursuit of a charter to operate an 
 industrial-loan company, a form of bank, due to intense opposition 
 and a federal moratorium on reviewing such applications.

Wal-Mart then pledged to increase its sales by 
 further pursuing nonbanking services.

Currently, Wal-Mart conducts more than two million 
 money services transactions a week, it said. Last year, customers 
 who used Wal-Mart&apos;s services saved an average of $450 a year, or 
 nearly $40 per month, the company said. The opening of additional 
 Wal-Mart MoneyCenters will put more than $320 million back into 
 customers&apos; pockets, the retailer said.

Wal-Mart caters heavily to customers with little or 
 no access to banking services, often described as the&quot;unbanked&quot;or&quot;underbanked.&quot;Thompson has said roughly 20% of the U.S. population 
 fits that description, and that segment is well represented within 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s customer base. According to ACNielsen, 42% of Wal-Mart 
 shoppers have household incomes of less than $40,000.

That makes Wal-Mart a destination for check cashing, 
 bill payment and money transfers. Last year, it handled an average 
 of 1.5 million to two million such transactions each week. Among the 
 buyers are immigrants sending money to their families abroad.

The Wal-Mart MoneyCard will be rolled out to about 
 1,300 Wal-Mart stores by the end of June and to another 1,300 stores 
 by the end of July. The reloadable prepaid card will be available at 
 most Wal-Mart stores by year end, the retailer said.

Customers will be able to use the Wal-Mart MoneyCard 
 to shop online, buy gasoline, get cash from an ATM, and use it where 
 Visa cards are accepted.

Retailers including CVS Inc., RadioShack Corp., 
 RiteAid and Walgreen sell similar Visa debit cards. Wal-Mart will 
 use a subsidiary of General Electric Corp. for the card&apos;s services. 
 It has a long history with GE&apos;s consumer-finance group, launching a 
 Wal-Mart Discover Card issued by GE two years ago. Last year, GE and 
 Wal-Mart released a co-branded credit card in China.

 Lands&apos; End Seeks to 
 Resuscitate Sears 
 By George Anderson 
 RetailWire
June 18, 2007 

 It&apos;s been a continuing story at 
 Sears. One quarter follows another and sales just continue to drop. 
 The chain, which has been criticized for not doing enough to get its 
 business turned around, thinks it may have found at least one answer 
 to help it reverse its downward spiral. 

 Sears is banking on its Lands&apos; End 
 store-within-a-store concept (approx. 10,000-square-foot 
 departments) to help it attract shoppers like Jennifer Leonard of 
 Millstone, New Jersey to its stores to buy clothes even though 
 they&apos;ve never bought any apparel from the chain before. 

 Ms. Leonard told the Asbury Park 
 Press why she went clothes shopping at Sears for the very first 
 time.&quot;I came specifically for the Lands&apos; End brand,&quot;she said.&quot;I 
 knew it was good-quality stuff. I knew that bathing suits in 
 particular would be a good price and better than anything I can find 
 in Lord&amp;Taylor&apos;s and Macy&apos;s.&quot; 

 Lands&apos; End spokesperson Michele 
 Casper, said,&quot;We are actually able to attract new customers as well 
 as bring a higher level of customer service to a retail format. If 
 people are great Lands&apos; End shoppers, they can now experience that 
 great customer service and assortment within a store setting.&quot; 

 Eric Romero, a Sears&apos; store manager 
 in Freehold, New Jersey, told the Asbury P ark 
 Press, that the Lands&apos; End store-within-a-store&quot;has been a great 
 success.&quot; 

 Ms. Casper said that consumers that 
 see the Lands&apos; End department as a destination are discovering Sears 
 in the process.&quot;If they haven&apos;t been a Sears shopper... it is also 
 opening their eyes to the Sears retail floor as well,&quot;she said. 

 Discussion Questions: Will a 
 significant commitment to Lands&apos; End bring in a whole new group of 
 consumers to Sears? Will it introduce them to other aspects of Sears 
 in the process? 

 Changing Clothes - Asbury Park Press 

 How likely is Lands&apos; End to bring new customers into Sears to 
 shop for clothing? 

 Very likely
Somewhat likely
Somewhat unlikely
Very unlikely
Not sure/no opinion 

 I have to agree with the 
 store-within-a-store concept. Sears is already known for carrying a 
 wide array of products. Now, they are taking a stab at product 
 quality and differentiation. Lands&apos; End will hopefully draw in a 
 higher-end crowd, and that will hopefully draw attention to some of 
 the other upgrades they have been making in other product lines as 
 well. 

 Gregory M. Belkin, Product Marketing 
 Manager, SeaTab Software Inc. 

 I think Sears has done a fabulous job 
 with Lands&apos; End in my local Sears. The merchandising is very well 
 done and matches the overall Land&apos;s End brand. They make good use of 
 freestanding displays, the lighting is effective and the product 
 presentations are outstanding. I especially like the inclusion of a 
 monogramming kiosk right in the store, which allows immediate 
 follow-through on a key offering of Lands&apos; End. I think they&apos;ve hit 
 a home run with it. 

 Now, the big question is will it 
 attract new customers? I think the short answer is yes. While I 
 doubt they are really new Sears customers, more importantly they are 
 returning Sears customers who have left them for other retailers. 
 The real question is will they be able retain these customers and 
 increase their shopping frequency. The answer lies in their ability 
 to execute beyond setting up the store-in-a-store and keep the area 
 well stocked, well merchandised, and well staffed. I for one will 
 shop there but only if it is a good shopping experience. 

 Can Sears deliver that? The jury will 
 be out a while on that one.... 

 Doug Fleener, President and Managing 
 Partner, Dynamic Experiences Group 

 Yes, one of the reasons for the 
 department store comeback is that savvy department stores are 
 featuring a number of specialty stores-within-stores. The fact that 
 these stores-within-stores often have their own buyers, marketing, 
 advertising and sales and management personnel is what gives them 
 the ability to be closer to the market, and why they are more likely 
 to feature the products and items that consumers desire.
Lands&apos; End offers distinctive products, one of the keys to success. 

 Also, Sears has (finally) embarked on 
 serious multiple channel strategies, 
 another key. 

 I give this strategy a good chance of 
 success. Sears is coming back. 

 Roger Selbert, Editor&amp;Publisher, 
 Integrated Retailing 

 Lands&apos; End might be the best thing 
 Sears has going for it with regards to
retail, but they are small and insignificant compared to the overall 
 disaster.
Lands&apos; End is too little and too late for Sears. 

 David Livingston, Principal, DJL 
 Research 

 Let&apos;s see...Sears bought Lands&apos; End 
 in 2002. They have had five years (of almost
uninterrupted sales declines) to leverage this acquisition. What&apos;s 
 taking so long, and is it really working? 

 Sears&apos; original stab at Lands&apos; End 
 shops inside its stores looked like an afterthought, and out of sync 
 with their overall promotional strategy...so devoting more square 
 footage in otherwise underperforming apparel space is probably a 
 good idea. But is the customer drawn to the Lands&apos; End shops really 
 buying other softlines product at Sears before she leaves? 

 Sears has a few credible&quot;legacy&quot;brands in its portfolio, especially Kenmore and Craftsman. One of 
 their challenges is how to treat Lands&apos; End as one of their&quot;legacies&quot;without tainting the brand&apos;s own longstanding reputation. 
 This is just one of dozens of issues that the Sears team must be 
 wrestling with right now. 

 Richard Seesel, Principal , Retailing 
 In Focus LLC 

 The Lands&apos; End store-within-a-store 
 is a good idea and will draw in some new customers. But this will 
 not be the&quot;golden nugget&quot;for Sears. It will help but they need a 
 new makeover. Sears apparel merchandising has improved over the last 
 four years except no one knows about it. When someone goes apparel 
 shopping, the last place you think to go is Sears. 

 Image and branding is necessary to 
 improve numbers for Sears. In a poll of women concerning where they 
 shop for clothing, one lady answered&quot;Sears&quot;and everyone looked at 
 her in astonishment. Why? She said,&quot;they are the best kept secret; 
 they have good trendy clothing at great prices.&quot;Being the best kept 
 secret is not what a retailer strives to achieve! They need to 
 reposition themselves while not losing their positions in other 
 areas like tools and appliances. Sears needs to be more in touch 
 with the consumer and react faster. The market won&apos;t wait for them 
 to take years to decide what to do. Speaking of their strongholds, 
 who wants to buy an appliance at Sears and 
 wait a week to get it? Sears needs to get with the program; we are a&quot;want it now&quot;society.

 Sears&apos; issue, like Wal-Mart, is with 
 changing its past image and reason for being, to something relevant 
 to the targeted consumer. Research will define this area(s). And, 
 this image change isn&apos;t easy and/or secured quickly. 

 Yes, you target your current 
 shoppers. But, it is the one-timers and non shoppers that are 
 critical. Sears is known for tools, appliances, and whatever. But a 
 meaningful effort in an unknown market to Sears&apos; target 
 audience--even if Lands&apos; End is known--isn&apos;t a cake walk. 

 Service to the consumers who might go 
 to Sears for the new Lands&apos; End products
better be supported by very qualified sales associates, with 
 meaningful knowledge and administration skills. 

 One bad shopping experience, even 
 with a noted consumer centic brand like Lands&apos;
End will direct the consumers back to the catalog alternative. 

 Makes sense to this consumer who is 
 bypassing Sears for the catalog and web site
of Lands&apos; End! Hmmmmmmmmm 

 Stephan G. Kouzomis, Faculty and 
 Staff Member,
University of Louisville&apos;s
 College of Business 

 I am not sure the concept will really 
 work for the existing Lands&apos; End customer since the selection is so 
 limited. That is what I have observed at a local Sears store. I 
 would consider adding an in-store computer kiosk where customers 
 could order products directly from Lands&apos; End website in the event a 
 certain size or color was not available in store. Other retailers 
 like Coldwater Creek offer this ability and it adds significantly to 
 their customer service. Sears could also do more to advertise that 
 Lands&apos; End returns are handled at store level, thus saving consumers 
 the postage, while bringing them into their
stores. 

 But the store-within-a-store will 
 likely invite new customers who may not be familiar with the quality 
 and variety of Lands&apos; End merchandise. 

 Odonna Mathews, President, Odonna 
 Mathews Consulting 

 Sears has destroyed most of the value 
 of the Lands&apos; End brand. Yes, a shop within the store will stand out 
 and look good in relation to its surroundings but it is not&quot;the 
 answer&quot;for Sears since the brand no longer has meaning to its 
 original upscale, catalog, sailing clientle (how non-Sears can you 
 get?) and it is also not relevant to the value seeking mall/Sears 
 regular (if there is such a thing left) customers. We all know Sears 
 dropped the ball when it did not seek to emphasize the hard goods, 
 male product strength that was its roots. If it chose the right path 
 when it had the chance it could now be the Bass Pro, Cabela&apos;s of the 
 mall world instead of the floundering giant of soft goods that it 
 is. 

 Mike Tesler, President, Retail 
 Concepts 

 Sears needs a total revamp, not a 
 piecemeal approach. The feeling in the average Sears store is 
 similar to that of a store closing sale. Craftsman and Kenmore will 
 not carry Sears. 

 The staff I have met are indifferent 
 at best. I remember the enthusiasm and friendliness of Sears 
 employees when I was much younger. I remember well-stocked stores 
 with energy and life. 

 Good concepts dropped into an 
 unpleasant environment will not work. The Sears executives need to get out into their stores and see what the 
 store experience is. Then these executives need to visit 
 Anthropolgie, West Elm, Best Buy, Crate&amp;Barrel, Nordstrom, and 
 Target to see what is working in retail. I want them to take lots of 
 notes and set 3 to 6 month targets for change. 4 years from buying 
 Lands&apos; End to a store-within-a-store is American Automakers idea of 
 speed, and you can see the results in Sears and with the American 
 automotive business. 

 Sears used to be one of the most 
 shopped American stores; they are now an afterthought. Good luck. 

 Arthur Corbin, Owner / President, 
 Corbin&amp;Hendrix 

 I agree with most of the other 
 comments here that the store-within-a-store concept is a great idea 
 and can work. Sears is not the only retailer practicing this concept 
 today. JCPenney is a good example of another retailer putting this 
 into action with their partner, Sephora. I don&apos;t know if this will 
 be the golden nugget as stated before but to answer the original 
 question, will this bring new customers into the stores? I say YES! 
 For the first time, I shopped in Sears for apparel and went there 
 specifically for Lands&apos; End. They got me...they will get more. 

 &apos;BRetail &apos; 

 As far as I&apos;m concerned, Sears has 
 never met the mark when it comes to fashion apparel. I don&apos;t shop 
 there for the same reason I never shopped there as a teenager. They 
 simply don&apos;t sell fashion. As exciting as it might seem, having 
 Lands&apos; End come to the stores just isn&apos;t cutting it. Lands&apos; End is 
 not the quality it used to be, and what I saw in one of the stores 
 was sports related only. 

 There is a reason they say&quot;The 
 softer side of Sears.&quot;It&apos;s just that: SOFT. They need to figure out 
 who they are and more importantly, who the customer is. I say 
 abandon the clothing and focus on the hardlines. 

 &apos;3642245&apos; 

 It has always seemed to me that Sears 
 never quite understood that it was hard for women to see Sears as a 
 place for fashion when it is the same place you go to get your tools 
 and washing machines. 

 Like the Lands&apos; End brand a lot, but 
 don&apos;t think it solves this fundamental problem. 

 Dan Gilmore, Editor, 
 SupplyChainDigest 

 I have consistently contended that 
 Sears would take Lands&apos; End down if they held on to it
long enough, that Lands&apos; End shoppers would not accept a Sears 
 banner association with their beloved khaki pants and polo shirts. 
 But a new possibility has emerged. Perhaps the Sears brand has 
 finally become so irrelevant that the Lands&apos; End brand can now 
 surface unencumbered? Anything&apos;s possible, right? 

 Ben Ball, Senior Vice President, 
 Dechert-Hampe 

 Yes, it will bring them in. But will 
 it keep them coming back? Many of us seem to be in agreement that 
 this is the challenge. Sears has a lot of work to do and I applaud 
 this creative&quot;first step.&quot;But Arthur is right, the brand needs an 
 overhaul and their executives need to get out there and get a firm 
 grip on the competition--and the opportunity. They have a great shot 
 if they get smart and move quickly. Otherwise, I don&apos;t think their
few benchmark store brands will carry them into our 
 hyper-competitive, hyper-demanding retail future. 

 Laura Davis-Taylor, Founder and 
 Principal, Retail Media Consulting 
  

 At first glance I loved the 
 concept--then remembered that, as a bunch of folks have pointed out, 
 Sears should have done this years ago, and in a much bigger way. 

 I can&apos;t see exactly where Sears has 
 destroyed the Lands&apos; End brand. If, like me, you only encounter it 
 online and in the mail, it&apos;s pretty much the same as ever. 

 But if I had been Sears&apos; management 
 when they&apos;d acquired LE years ago, I&apos;d have immediately converted 
 all but the trendiest soft-goods departments to Lands&apos; End and 
 leveraged hell out of the brand when they could. The price points 
 have always been reasonable, and Dodgeville could have instantly 
 propelled Sears to the top of the game in the sort of basics that 
 everyone buys at both the top and middle of the market (news 
 flash--even the most upscale shopper needs a good $10 cotton tank 
 top/$20 polo).

 Nobody can accuse Sears-Kmart of 
 being a fast mover when it comes to its long-anticipated image 
 overhaul. And it certainly took its time getting to this 
 multi-channel
strategy for Lands&apos; End. But if the company has truly been attending 
 to its operational housekeeping, as Mr. Lampert keeps insisting, 
 then maybe it&apos;s time to capitalize on its&quot;house of brands&quot;legacy. 

 This topic stimulates the following a 
 fantasy scenario: 

 1) Sears Corporate continues to 
 strategically acquire brands on the softline side, by adding more 
 strong e-catalogs and rolling out in-store boutiques to make them 
 truly multi-channel. Why not an online jeweler, an online shoe site, 
 an online sporting goods site, an online cosmetics brand? How about 
 acquiring the remnants of CompUSA? 

 2) The company draws a clear line of 
 definition between the Sears and Kmart chains while also emphasizing 
 their connection. A name change for Kmart might help this (how about 
 S Mart?). Sears-only brands and S Mart-only categories get carefully 
 and clearly defined. A comprehensive store decor program updates the 
 present institutional feel of the Sears stores and makes them 
 fashionable. 

 3) Key brands with cross-platform 
 potential, like Craftsman, Kenmore, Martha Stewart, get merchandised 
 across both platforms. Crappy brands get thrown out. Web kiosks in 
 both stores offer full-line ordering and returns across both chains. 
 An Amazon-like shopping portal links all together on the Web, and 
 Sears credit is accepted for all purchases system-wide. 

 4) Both chains prominently feature 
 gift cards for each other, including brand-specific gift cards for 
 marquee own labels like Craftsman and Lands&apos; End. 

 5) Sears overhauls its services arm 
 and establishes a strong quality control and vigorous ad program to 
 keep its contractors on the straight and narrow. Think&quot;Geek Squad&quot;but for all sorts of installation and maintenance 
 professionals--Sears Certified Home Solutions has a nice ring to it. 
 Again, these services should be 
 prominently available in Sears stores, S Mart stores and online, 
 with a central clearinghouse to ride herd on it all. 

 6) Sears/S Mart launches an 
 industry-leading sustainability program that includes chainwide 
 energy conservation and solar rooftops on all structures within 10
years. It overhauls merchandise sourcing and adds&quot;carbon footprint&quot;descriptions to all products sold in its stores. It simultaneously 
 becomes the first national chain to add a line of home energy 
 management products, including solar panel systems, passive solar 
 pool heaters, windows, etc. 

 OK, maybe that&apos;s enough free 
 brainstorming for one post. If Mr. Lampert needs my
help with this, he can find me right here on the RetailWire....

 The other day I was in my local Sears 
 looking for a lawn mower and came across the Lands&apos; End department, 
 it was very sharp, spacious and polished. I was pleasantly 
 surprised. It reminded me of the soft shops at Field&apos;s. I liked the 
 navy and cream color scheme, very clean and elegant. Unfortunately 
 all it did was show up the rest of the store as being cluttered and&quot;discounty&quot;with clothing stacked all the way up to the ceilings and 
 hanging off of her square inch of the columns and clothes racks 
 spaced 10&apos; between each other. The Lands&apos; End department had a very 
 different aesthetic. Now if someone with vision can take that 
 aesthetic and transform it to the entire store, that would be
something! I wish Lands&apos; End and Sears the best of luck. Great job! 

 &apos;jameseastbay &apos; 

 The Lands&apos; End store within a store 
 concept is great. It&apos;s been in my local Sears for at least two years 
 now. I&apos;m not sure why it&apos;s taken Sears so long to exploit this with 
 promotions, as they seem totally distracted by the competitive 
 onslaught in appliances.
However, as the format is now, once you leave the Lands&apos; End 
 department, which
is nice enough, you enter into a retail nowhere land of 
 miscellaneous assortments and brands, before hitting the appliances 
 and tools in the back. 

 Sears needs to find a way to better 
 complement the rest of its apparel and accessories with Lands&apos; End. 
 What they have right now is not enough. 

 &apos;mikeb22 &apos; 

 I was in Sears last week to buy a 
 refrigerator, and while the actual errand went fine, the overall 
 experience wasn&apos;t very uplifting: the store seemed understaffed and 
 cluttered, and the exterior dirty...in short, while Sears&apos; problems 
 are extensive, they also seem traditional and easily fixed. Stop 
 cutting expenses and upgrade the stores.
 &apos;csundstrom&apos; 

 I consistently believe that consumers 
 need to be given a &apos;reason&apos; to enter a retailer. Why Sears acquired 
 Lands&apos; End was to do just that--wasn&apos;t it? 

 Basically, what they are asking for 
 is a &apos;do over&apos;. Lacking virtually any other reason, they are likely 
 not to get a &apos;do over&apos; on this one. It&apos;s simply just not going to 
 happen when the consumer can, if they really want it, buy the 
 products with a much better experience on the net or over the phone 
 via the catalog. 

 So, from my point of view, I still 
 don&apos;t have a &apos;reason&apos; to go there. I&apos;ve given them too many chances. 
 Yet, I do still thank them for the washer and dryer that I received 
 for free from them years ago. Alas, a story for another day.
 &apos;Scanner &apos; 

 Having been a Sears employee and a 
 loyal Lands&apos; End purchaser from their beginning on Elston Avenue in 
 Chicago, I think putting Lands&apos; End stores in Sears would only hurt 
 Lands&apos; End and not help Sears. The culture in the stores would chase 
 away the Lands&apos; End customer. A better idea would be to open 
 separate Lands&apos; End stores.
 &apos;clkarl &apos; 

 The experience at the Lands&apos; End 
 department is decidedly better than what consumers find in the rest 
 of Sears. That is not a good omen for Sears&apos; chances to convert 
 first-time shoppers who came to the store because of Lands&apos; End.
 &apos;retailveteran &apos; 

 You used to be able find anything in 
 a Sears store or Sears catalog - log cabin homes, appliances, 
 clothes, tools, even great gifts with a distinctive Sears wrapping 
 paper. My grandfather would spend his Saturday mornings perusing the 
 aisles, seeing if there was anything he didn&apos;t have or might want. 
 That was 50 years ago. 

 Today? Well, there&apos;s this little 
 thing called the Internet and if I need to find just about anything, 
 I either use the search box or go to Amazon. Let&apos;s face it - Sears 
 lost its relevance long before the softer side of Sears campaign. 

 Buying the company was a masterstroke 
 financially for Lampert and the guy is a genius when it comes to 
 analyzing and utilizing data. He has a goldmine in Lands&apos; End and a 
 portfolio of incredible brands - Kenmore, Diehard, Craftsman. 
 Timeless. Securitizing them was brilliant! He instantly created 
 value and if his retail strategy fails, he&apos;s got brands, real 
 estate, and a huge services business from which to gain value. 

 But let&apos;s face it - Lampert is not an 
 operator or a merchant. Amazingly, no one on his management team is 
 either. His CEO? Came from a franchise-based fast food business. His 
 CFO? His business partner at ESL Investments. His chief merchant? 
 Unknown at this point. His chief marketing officer? Came from IBM 
 and while she&apos;s well respected, she hasn&apos;t managed a transformation 
 at such a true multichannel operation. The chief customer officer? 
 Came from McKinsey. And the CIO? She spent 21 years at Kmart, a 
 failed and bankrupt operation before Lampert bought it. 

 Where are the first round draft 
 picks? Where&apos;s someone like Allen Questrom, a classic merchant who 
 can cut costs and create a differentiated brand and merchandising 
 roadmap? Data and analysis is one thing - creating customer centric 
 assortment and differentiated experiences is another. 

 And that&apos;s where Lands&apos; End comes 
 into play. It has a very core vision of the customer persona - 
 families who want timeless product and superior value. It&apos;s what 
 Sears should have leveraged long ago... I would argue the current 
 portfolio of proprietary brands have essentially run their course 
 (Covington? Structure?) and the company should have turned over its&quot;softer side&quot;to a viable brand like Lands&apos; End when they purchased 
 the company 5 years ago. The store within a store concept is heading 
 in the right direction, but it can&apos;t work on its own and needs 
 similar concepts to develop greater relevance for a younger, 
 family-oriented consumer.

 Street Smart: Face-Off: Sears Holdings
Can Lampert Save Sears? 
 By Dyan Machan - 
 SmartMoney
July 1, 2007 

 YES:&quot;Sears Chairman Edward Lampert 
 appears committed to a long-term perspective, and Sears will likely 
 be guided by that perspective.&quot; 

 -- William Dreher Jr., Deutsche Bank 
 Securities 

 YES : Sears Holdings is 
 offering what no other retailer can -- a chance to benefit from one 
 of the greatest investment minds of our time. You could compare 
 Sears Holdings with Berkshire Hathaway in its infancy. 

 YES : Sears is an improving 
 story. Profit margins have improved in each of the six quarters 
 since the merger with Kmart, and domestic store-to-store comparisons 
 have stopped bleeding, from high-single-digit declines to a 
 low-single-digit decline. The company has shown a laser-like focus 
 on cutting costs, driving these strong results. 

 YES : We see an additional $6 
 billion in value that could be unlocked by securitizing real estate 
 and intellectual property assets like Craftsman, Kenmore and the 
 Sears brand itself. Adding this to our price target of $238, we see 
 a price range of $250 to $290. 

 YES : At 7.1 times estimated 
 2007 cash flow, Sears is not expensive. Target is at a 
 price/cash-flow ratio of 7.7, and Wal-Mart, 7.4. We expect the 
 shares to benefit from impressive profit and cash-flow growth as 
 well as multiple expansion as the critics are answered. 

 --- 

 NO :&quot;Sears has been a good 
 performer, but game over. Sears Chairman Edward Lampert is not 
 investing in the future; he&apos;s milking it for cash.&quot; 

 -- Larry Haverty, Gabelli Asset 
 Management 

 NO : Lampert [whose hedge fund, 
 ESL Investments, owns 41 percent] has made a fortune on Sears. The 
 stock is up eight times over the past four years. Trees don&apos;t grow 
 to the sky. 

 NO : The capital-expense budget 
 -- money spent on store improvements -- is well under what it should 
 be as a percentage of sales. In other words, the stores and other 
 assets are getting older. You can&apos;t run a retailer and have it look 
 shabby. Plus, inventories are too high and growing more rapidly than 
 sales. 

 NO : The problem is that there 
 is no one to buy this real estate. The properties are in industrial 
 areas and not appropriate to turn into, say, rental developments. 
 When you securitize something, you are putting debt on the balance 
 sheet. And I&apos;m not sure there is significant value to atrophying 
 brands Kenmore and Craftsman. 

 NO : Both Sears and Kmart are 
 directed at low to middle-income 
 consumers. That shopper is under pressure. Cash flow is going to 
 deteriorate pretty quickly. Sears&apos;s stock is up, and its competitors 
 are down. Something doesn&apos;t smell good. It&apos;s a short. 

 SEARS HOLDINGS: SHLD, $180
Sales: $53 bil*
Net Income: $1.49 bil*
Earnings per Share: $9.57*

 Buyer finances Wards Catalog House deal 
 with $265-mil. loan 
 By Eddie Baeb Chicago Real Estate Daily
June 15, 2007 

 The buyer of the Montgomery Ward&amp;Co. Catalog House financed the acquisition with a $265-million loan, 
 almost 90% of the purchase price, from LaSalle Bank. 

 The fixed-rate, interest-only loan 
 for the office and retail portion of the historic complex at 600 W. 
 Chicago Ave. was arranged by Holliday Fenoglio Fowler L.P., the 
 brokerage firm says in a statement. 

 A New York investment group that 
 included investor David Werner and attorney Victor Gerstein bought 
 the landmark building for $300 million from Chicago developer 
 Centrum Properties Inc. and its New York-based partners Angelo 
 Gordon&amp;Co. and Taconic Investment Partners LLC, according to real 
 estate sources. The transaction closed in May. 

 Centrum and Angelo Gordon first 
 bought the sprawling, 2.2-million-square-foot former warehouse in 
 1999 and then converted a portion of the complex into condominiums 
 and later redeveloped about 1.5 million square feet into office and 
 retail. The mixed-used complex is now about 80% leased, according to 
 the statement by New York-based Holliday Fenoglio. 

 Senior managing director Mike Kavanau, 
 who is based in Holliday Fenoglios Chicago office, and New 
 York-based managing director Evan Pariser placed the loan for the 
 buyer.
 

 

 Mail-order 
 home experts hammer out a truce 
 By Adam Jadhav St. Louis 
 Post-Dispatch
June 14, 2007 

 The fighting apparently has ended 
 between two women who each claim almost obsessive expertise in a 
 small slice of American history the mail-order homes sold by 
 Sears, Roebuck&amp;Co. in the decades before World War II. 

 Both Laurie Flori of Carlinville, and 
 Rosemary Thornton, at the time a Godfrey resident, wrote books on 
 the homes that were usually built by the owners themselves and in 
 many ways symbolized arrival to the good life. 

 Apparently, their research 
 overlapped, and the resulting collision led to allegations of 
 plagiarism and defamation. 

 In February 2006, Flori sued for 
 defamation, claiming she and her book were trashed by Thornton. 
 Thornton countersued, alleging she was a victim of Flori&apos;s 
 plagiarism. 

 Now, more than a year later, both 
 parties have settled uneasily. A final dismissal order and 
 stipulation is expected to be entered Friday in U.S. District Court 
 in Springfield. 

 &quot;Pretty much any time someone 
 litigates an issue both sides in the end have lost something,&quot;said 
 Flori&apos;s attorney James Fahey.&quot;It&apos;s a passion among both of the 
 parties and both felt strongly they had been wronged.&quot; 

 Thornton published her first book,&quot;The Houses That Sears Built,&quot;in 2002. She followed that with three 
 other books on the kit homes. 

 Flori&apos;s&quot;Additionally Speaking&quot;was 
 published in 2005. It focused on the historic Standard Addition in 
 Carlinville, believed to be the largest collection of Sears homes in 
 the world. 

 Flori claimed victory in the matter 
 because Thornton agreed to apologize for alleging that she stole 
 work without attribution. 

 Flori had contended that her 
 reputation and public speaking career was ruined by Thornton, who 
 allegedly contacted various libraries and Oprah Winfrey&apos;s show to 
 claim she was a copycat. 

 Flori denied the allegation and said 
 she had researched the homes in the Standard Addition neighborhood 
 built in by Standard Oil in the early 20th century to support mine 
 workers since she and her husband bought a home there in 1983. 

 Though Thornton retracts her claims, 
 neither woman is paying any damages. 

 &quot;I just never dreamed that me writing 
 an advocacy book for Standard Addition would get me into a lawsuit,&quot;Flori said.&quot;What I will say is that she needs to do her thing and 
 I&apos;ll do mine and we&apos;ll stay away from each other.&quot; 

 Thornton, who has since left the 
 Godfrey area, could not be reached. Her St. Louis attorney, John 
 Pawloski, declined to comment and claimed the settlement was 
 confidential. 

 Companies like Standard Oil purchased 
 Sears homes for expanding operations. Future homeowners, accustomed 
 to ordering the staples of life from the Sears catalog, suddenly 
 found cheap homes made of quality materials. 

 Homes ran from several hundred to 
 several thousand dollars, sometimes 30 or 40 percent below market 
 rates for a home. Buyers provided the land, and the muscle.
 

 

 South lags in report card on health 
 care 
 By Julie Appleby, USA TODAY
June 13, 2007 

 Where you live may help determine how 
 long you live, with residents of the lowest-ranking five states 
 dying prematurely at a rate twice that of those in the top-ranked 
 five. 

 The rate of premature death in 
 Minnesota, Utah, Vermont, Wyoming and Alaska is half of that of the 
 lowest-performing states, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, 
 Louisiana and Mississippi. Premature death is defined as dying 
 before age 75 from conditions that could be delayed or prevented by 
 appropriate medical care. 

 That kind of tremendous variation 
 among states cuts across more than just premature death, says The 
 Commonwealth Fund in a report out today that details 32 measures of 
 cost, insurance coverage and medical quality, ranking states by how 
 well they perform on each of the measures. 

 &quot;Where you live matters for getting 
 care when you need it, getting the right care and the opportunity to 
 live a long and healthy life,&quot;says Cathy Schoen, a senior vice 
 president at the fund and one of the report&apos;s co-authors. The New 
 York-based Commonwealth Fund is a private foundation that studies 
 health issues. 

 The report,&quot;Aiming Higher: Results 
 from a State Scorecard on Health System Performance,&quot;is one of the 
 first to compile in one place a broad array of measures for each 
 state. It comes amid a growing focus on efforts to rate and report on medical quality, from hospital death and infection 
 rates tracked by Medicare to efforts by insurers to measure the 
 performance of doctors and hospitals. 

 Using data mainly gleaned from 
 government agencies, such as Medicare, the Census
Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
 report concludes that all states could do better. But even 
 lower-ranking states do some things right. 

 Across all measures, the 
 top-performing five states are Hawaii, Iowa, New Hampshire, Vermont 
 and Maine. The lowest-performing states were Kentucky, Louisiana, 
 Nevada, Arkansas, Texas, with Mississippi and Oklahoma tying for 
 last place. 

 Most of the findings have been 
 reported separately in other places, but Schoen says she hopes that 
 compiling the data into one report, which is available online at 
 www.commonwealthfund.org, will spur states to take action. The 
 Commonwealth Fund backs efforts to cover more residents with 
 insurance. 

 &quot;One purpose of the state scorecard 
 is to stimulate discussion and action,&quot;Schoen says. Part of that 
 discussion, she says, needs to revolve around expanding insurance.&quot;The country needs to take a big step forward on health insurance: 
 start insuring the entire population.&quot; 

 Possibly controversial but still 
 useful Efforts to measure and compare quality can be controversial. 
 Medical providers often question whether the data were adjusted 
 properly to account for variations in age or sickness or whether the 
 items measured are an accurate reflection of performance. 

 The Commonwealth Fund report will 
 likely garner the same kind of concern, but observers say that the 
 report will prove useful.&quot;It&apos;s part of the entire movement toward 
 measurement,&quot;says Hoangmai Pham, senior health researcher at the 
 Center for Studying Health System Change, a non-partisan think tank 
 in Washington.&quot;It&apos;s an important first step. What happens from here 
 on out is really hard work.&quot; 

 The highest-ranked states, the report 
 says, often have policies designed to improve access to health 
 insurance. Hawaii, for example, gets top marks due, in large part, 
 to a 1974 law requiring employers to offer health insurance to 
 employees who work more than 20 hours a week, the report concludes. 
 Eighty-seven percent of adults in the state are
insured, as are 94.7% of children, according to the report. 

 States that generally had more people 
 covered by health insurance also tended to score higher on quality 
 measures, the report says. 

 On the other end, Mississippi and 
 Oklahoma which tied for last place in the overall ranking of 50 
 states generally have high levels of uninsured and restrictive 
 limits on who is eligible for state-sponsored care through Medicaid, 
 the report says. 

 &quot;The report does provide an 
 opportunity for states to look at where they rank as compared to 
 others and take it as a challenge to improve,&quot;says Mike Crutcher, 
 Oklahoma&apos;s commissioner of health. Some things, he says, need a 
 national solution. 

 Pham says she is cautious about 
 drawing conclusions from the report about what causes the states to 
 vary so much. 

 &quot;It raises a lot of questions about 
 the underlying causes and those questions are not easy to answer,&quot;she says.&quot;It is difficult to draw any one conclusion about what one 
 state did that affected its performance.&quot; 

 Diane Rowland of the Kaiser Family 
 Foundation says that having insurance has clearly been demonstrated 
 as better than not having insurance. But she, too, says that it is 
 just one variable in overall health of residents. 

 &quot;We also know that quality of 
 people&apos;s health is dependent on the environment, whether they live 
 in an area with clean or dirty air, for example,&quot;Rowland says. 

 Many ways to assess performance 

 Insurance coverage rates are just one 
 measure of performance of a state, and the report includes many 
 others, such as how many Medicare patients are readmitted to a 
 hospital within 30 days of discharge, infant mortality rates, the 
 percentage of children who receive recommended vaccinations and how 
 much it costs to buy health insurance. 

 &quot;This does as good a job as any 
 report I&apos;ve seen in bringing in a range of both acute and 
 preventative measures in trying to assess the performance of the 
 health services system for the state,&quot;says Christopher Atchison, 
 associate dean of the College of Public Health at the University of 
 Iowa. 

 Iowa scored high, he suspects, for a 
 variety of reasons, including efforts by hospitals and doctors in 
 the state to work together to promote quality efforts. He also says 
 most residents are within 25 miles of a hospital and that the state 
 is fairly homogenous. It also has a high percentage of residents who 
 have health insurance coverage. 

 The Iowa health care Collaborative, a 
 partnership between the state&apos;s hospital association and the state&apos;s 
 physicians&apos; association, works together to promote quality 
 guidelines, improve safety and publish data on how well doctors and 
 hospitals are doing in meeting quality goals. 

 &quot;When we look at these numbers in the 
 Commonwealth report, we think it&apos;s great, but you ain&apos;t seen nothing 
 yet,&quot;says Tom Evans, president of the collaborative.&quot;We&apos;re proud 
 of where we are and excited about the future.&quot;
 
 CHART: Grades for each state alphabetically 



 States were evaluated on 32 measures, 
 then ranked into four equal parts or quartiles, represented by the 
 grades A, B, C and D and the numbers 1-4, with 4 being the lowest. 

 Access means percentage of population 
 insured, quality considers how often people received recommended 
 care, avoidable costs include re-admissions to hospitals, equity 
 compared state performance by income and race/ethnicity, while 
 healthy lives considered deaths before age 75 from certain 
 conditions. (Read story)

 CNBC&apos;s Faber: Lampert Plans to Raise Billions for ESL Fund 
 By David Faber CNBC.com
June 11, 2007 

Eddie Lampert, the billionaire hedge fund manger and 
 controlling shareholder of Sears Holdings, is embarking on an effort 
 to raise billions in new money for his widely successful hedge fund, 
 ESL, according to people familiar with the situation.


ESL is already a giant, with assets in excess of $18 
 billion. But Lampert has rarely raised new money. Almost all the 
 assets in the fund are the result of compounding, given his 19 year 
 old fund has delivered annual returns, net of fees, that approach 
 30%. And the fund&apos;s largest position, a 40% stake in Sears Holding, 
 is not exactly liquid.

Rather than raise money by pursuing his own 
 marketing strategy, Lampert has enlisted Goldman Sachs to raise him 
 what is expected to be between $3 and $5 billion. Goldman will 
 essentially be doing a private placement of limited partnership 
 units in ESL. The minimum investment is $25 million.

And the money will carry a five year lock up with 
 six months notice due to withdraw or else you&apos;re in for another five 
 years. Lampert has traditionally had long lock-ups given his style 
 of investing is to take large positions and hold them for many 
 years.


Goldman is expected to have some sort of modified 
 road show for the capital raising. While $3 to $5 billion in new 
 funds may be the target, given the unprecedented liquidity in the 
 market and the track record of ESL, it&apos;s possible the offering could 
 attract more than $5 billion.

Why is Lampert raising money now? A spokesman for 
 ESL declined comment, but the obvious answer would be because he 
 can. Of course, raising so much new money will allow Lampert to 
 either increase the size of some his current positions, including a 
 stake in Citigroup, or begin to take some new large stakes.
 
 
 

 Macy&apos;s Drops 
 &apos;Mock Homes&apos; for Martha Stewart 
 By Vanessa 
 OConnell Wall Street Journal
June 11, 2007 

 Last spring, Macy&apos;s Inc. Chief 
 Executive Terry Lundgren came up with an ambitious plan to display a 
 massive new line of home goods produced exclusively by Martha 
 Stewart: creating 3,000-square foot mock&quot;homes&quot;in key stores. Home 
 builder KB Home planned to build the huge showcases inside Macy&apos;s 
 stores in such cities as New York, Chicago and San Francisco. 

 But Macy&apos;s now has canceled the 
 mock-home plan, citing a sharp decline in the housing market. 

 In interviews Friday, Macy&apos;s 
 officials said the company won&apos;t scale back the launch of Martha 
 Stewart merchandise. Some items from the new collection -- a line of 
 roughly 1,500 home accessories such as stainless-steel cookware, 
 china and glassware, collapsible colanders and a wide array of 
 towels, linens and bedding -- will begin appearing in Macy&apos;s stores 
 next month, followed by the full collection in mid-September. That 
 launch will be accompanied by a massive nationwide media and 
 marketing campaign. 

 But Macy&apos;s furniture and home-goods 
 sales have been sliding in recent months.&quot;It&apos;s no secret that our 
 home store has been the softest part of our business over the past 
 few years,&quot;Mr. Lundgren said at Macy&apos;s annual meeting May 18. Just 
 last week, the retailer formerly known as Federated Department 
 Stores Inc. posted a larger-than-expected drop in May same-store 
 sales. Sales of big-ticket items such as furniture are taking the 
 biggest hit, a Macy&apos;s spokesman said Friday. He noted that a number 
 of retailers, including J.C. Penney Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and 
 Sears Holdings Corp., have recently said sales of home-related goods 
 were weak. 

 Macy&apos;s retreat highlights the 
 difficulties facing Mr. Lundgren as he continues to integrate the 
 former May Department Store Co. locations that had long operated 
 under names such as Hecht&apos;s, Foley&apos;s, Filene&apos;s and Marshall Field&apos;s 
 at a time of growing competition for middle-income shoppers. Rivals 
 such as Penney and Kohl&apos;s Corp. have gained market share by adding 
 brands and designer lines to their clothing and home departments. 

 Other elements of Mr. Lundgren&apos;s plan 
 to get shoppers excited about the national chain, which now numbers 
 about 825 stores, haven&apos;t panned out either. Late last month Macy&apos;s 
 replaced its marketing chief just 15 months after hiring her and 
 acknowledged that its shift away from promotional marketing to 
 brand-image advertising, such as a flashy TV ad campaign intended to 
 create a glamorous new image for Macy&apos;s, failed to boost sales in 
 some markets, especially where local shoppers were more accustomed 
 to being offered coupons and discounts.&quot;We probably moved too far 
 too fast,&quot;says Macy&apos;s spokesman Jim Sluzewski. 

 Macy&apos;s is now reemphasizing coupons 
 and savings to draw customers to the 400 stores it acquired from 
 May. Last week, Mr. Lundgren said in a prepared statement that he 
 expects sales trends to improve this month and next, due to the 
 increased promotional activity. Mr. Sluzewski says it will involve 
 more&quot;public&quot;promotions such as coupons published in newspapers. 
 Coupons and discounts tend to be especially critical to sales of 
 home goods. 

 Mr. Lundgren and Macy&apos;s still view 
 the Martha Stewart line as key to their plan to turn Macy&apos;s into the 
 only major national retailer of upscale home goods. At the 
 shareholder meeting last month, he said the line is expected to&quot;have a positive effect on sales in the fall.&quot;Sales of furniture 
 and home goods account for about 15% of Macy&apos;s annual sales, which 
 totaled nearly $27 billion last year. 

 &quot;It&apos;s about market share,&quot;says 
 Timothy M. Adams, CEO of Macy&apos;s home division.&quot;There&apos;s some 
 business being done and if we do [the Martha Stewart products] 
 right, we can still win, no matter how tough the business is.&quot;Macy&apos;s Merchandising Group CEO Janet Grove says Macy&apos;s&quot;never 
 launched anything of this magnitude before&quot;nationally in all 
 stores. The company typically tests a new brand in a small group of 
 50 to 100 stores before taking it chainwide. 

 The merchandise will include, among 
 other things, kitchen gadgets with unusual features -- such as a can 
 opener with built-in bottle opener and oversized spatulas for frying 
 pans -- and a mainly white bedding ensemble with lace trim in a 
 design based on Ms. Stewart&apos;s heirloom bedding. Other basics will 
 include towels in a variety of colors. There will also be seasonal 
 items such as ornaments and decorations that can be used to assemble 
 an entire Christmas tree. China and crystal intended for formal use 
 are scheduled to hit the stores in early 2008. 

 Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at 
 Citigroup with a&quot;hold&quot;rating on Macy&apos;s, says a range of samples 
 shown to analysts were&quot;attractive and of high quality.&quot; 

 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. 
 hopes the new line will capture about 10% of the $4 billion in sales 
 that Macy&apos;s generates from home goods and that it will help Macy&apos;s 
 build an even larger business, says Susan Lyne, president and CEO. 
 As for the mock home project,&quot;I think that as we got closer to 
 launch, we realized you can&apos;t do something like that in more than a 
 few locations and we were better served initially in putting 
 resources in some other form of marketing that works in 820 
 locations,&quot;Ms. Lyne says.&quot;It isn&apos;t a dead idea,&quot;she adds, noting 
 that the companies might attempt it in the future. 

 Kmart sells just under $1 billion in 
 Martha Stewart Everyday branded products and ready-to-assemble 
 furniture in an arrangement that is due to expire in 2010. The 
 Martha Stewart goods to be sold at Macy&apos;s generally have more 
 embellishments and higher prices than the mostly bargain-priced 
 basics sold at Kmart, a unit of Sears. The Macy&apos;s line is based on 
 designs and patterns in Ms. Stewart&apos;s homes and on items shown in 
 her magazines. 

 Macy&apos;s also carries Martha Stewart 
 furniture by Bernhardt. But it isn&apos;t part of the exclusive Martha 
 Stewart Collection. 

 KB Home spokeswoman Caroline Shaw 
 says the idea for KB Home to build a mock Martha Stewart Home inside 
 Macy&apos;s was sort of a&quot;daredevil discussion&quot;between former KB Chief 
 Executive Bruce Karatz and Macy&apos;s Mr. Lundgren. She says the 
 discussions were preliminary and the companies never hashed out 
 details, such as how much KB Home would be compensated for the 
 project or how much it would cost.&quot;It was one of those fun ideas 
 that they talked about,&quot;she says, adding that Mr. Lundgren reached 
 out to Mr. Karatz, who had a knack for building model homes to 
 attract attention. 

 Early in his career, Mr. Karatz built 
 a model house on top of an Au Printemps department store in France. 
 In 1997, KB Home launched&quot;The Simpsons House Giveaway&quot;contest, 
 building a replica of the home from the&quot;Simpsons&quot;television show 
 in Las Vegas. In 2003 the company built a model home on the ABC 
 studio lot in midtown Manhattan of&quot;LIVE with Regis and Kelly&quot;for 
 an on-air giveaway. 

 The &apos;Trousseau&apos; bedding ensemble 
 from the Martha Stewart Collection 
The mock homes at Macy&apos;s were supposed not only to promote the 
 Martha Stewart merchandise but also help promote the Los Angeles 
 builder&apos;s co-branded Martha Stewart homes. Ms. Shaw says KB Home 
 decided to back off the idea last fall because the housing market 
 had slowed and KB wanted to focus on building homes in the field 
 rather than in Macy&apos;s stores.&quot;Building a house inside a department 
 store takes an immense amount of logistics and resources that both 
 sides were not ready to allocate at that time,&quot;Ms. Shaw says. 

 The decision wasn&apos;t related to Mr. 
 Karatz&apos;s departure in November, after the company said an internal 
 investigation found he backdated stock-option grants, Ms. Shaw says. 
 The retailer and builder remain open to future marketing 
 initiatives, she says, adding that KB intends to showcase the Martha 
 Stewart Macy&apos;s products in its Martha Stewart communities. So far, 
 five of the 10 licensed subdivisions planned for this year have 
 opened, in communities including Fairburn, Ga.; Perris, Calif.; and 
 Katy, Texas. New communities are slated to open this year in 
 Raleigh, N.C.; Orlando, Fla.; and Denver. Overall the program is 
 likely to result in 2,300 homes, ranging in price from more than 
 $200,000 to more than $500,000.

 There&apos;s something about 
 Eddie 
 By David 
 Roeder Chicago Sun-Times
June 10, 2007 

 It all comes down to the Cult of Eddie. That&apos;s 
 the only way to explain the performance of Sears Holdings (SHLD), 
 a stock that, despite projected dips in quarterly earnings, 
 despite fall-offs in same-store sales for Kmart and Sears 
 stores, despite a pronounced lack of reinvestment in its stores, 
 has gone aloft on gossamer wings. 

 For the year, SHLD shares have risen 5.6 
 percent to Friday&apos;s close of $177.40. Since March 2005, when 
 SHLD was created by the union of Sears and Kmart, the shares are 
 up around 33 percent. 

 The performance is a sign of investor faith in 
 Edward Lampert, the hedge-fund whiz who serves as Sears&apos; 
 chairman, because his investment vehicle owns 42 percent of the 
 company. Lampert, a follower of renowned investor Warren Buffett, 
 has exhibited his own gift for making money over the last 20 
 years. At the top of an industry that fancies itself as a 
 capitalistic meritocracy, Lampert is believed to have collected 
 annual earnings of more than $1 billion from the outsized 
 returns in the accounts he manages. 

 So investors have every reason to follow his 
 moves. Some became enchanted with Sears when Lampert completed 
 his takeover in 2005, figuring he had a grand plan for a 
 turnaround. Among Lampert&apos;s moves lately is an aggressive 
 buyback of SHLD shares. Despite the stock&apos;s gains under Lampert, 
 it still trades at a lower price-earnings ratio than its peers. 
 The general thought is,&quot;Eddie sees value so we should, too.&quot; 

 Morningstar analyst Kimberly Picciola is in 
 that camp, although she can enumerate all the danger signs.&quot;They continue to lose market share. There is little investment 
 going back in the business,&quot;she said. 

 But she&apos;s got Morningstar&apos;s most bullish tag, 
 a 5-star rating, on SHLD. It&apos;s because she sees Lampert as a 
 genius at managing capital, really his overriding job as 
 chairman. She thinks he will engineer something--an acquisition, 
 a private buyout, maybe selling of real estate--that will send 
 the shares higher. 

 Lampert, however, has yet to prove his stuff 
 in operations. Many experts say the consolidation of Sears and 
 Kmart has been unconscionably slow. He&apos;s propped up profits by 
 cutting expenses, but the merchandising decisions have gone over 
 poorly and the company has acknowledged that it has to retool 
 Sears Grand, its off-mall concept.

 Wal-Mart to offer 
 prepaid payment cards 
 By Kathy Chu and 
 Jayne O&apos;Donnell,  - USA Today 
June 7, 2006 

 Wal-Mart plans to launch a prepaid 
 payment card to appeal to its large segment of customers who don&apos;t 
 have bank accounts. 

 Wal-Mart (WMT) wouldn&apos;t confirm 
 details about the card. But a website for the Wal-Mart MoneyCard, 
 www.walmartmoneycard.com, says it will be a Visa-branded card, 
 issued by GE Money (GE), that can be used almost anywhere that Visa 
 debit cards are accepted, including at ATMs. Three people with 
 direct knowledge of the plans confirmed that the card will be 
 offered. 

 About 28 million people -  9% of the 
 U.S. population - do not have bank accounts, according to the 
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. A survey by the Federal Reserve 
 shows that these&quot;unbanked&quot;consumers prefer not to deal with banks 
 or feel they don&apos;t write enough checks or have sufficient cash to 
 open an account. 

 For these people, prepaid payment 
 cards that can be used to pay bills or make purchases are becoming 
 increasingly popular. Consumers can add money to the cards at 
 participating stores, but the cards are not linked to a checking or 
 savings account. 

 A few retailers, including Safeway (SWY) 
 and Walgreens (WAG), already offer prepaid Visa cards that can be 
 used anywhere, but Wal-Mart, as the largest retailer in the USA, 
 would be able to reach a far greater number of consumers. 

 Prepaid cards have been around for 
 years. But the most common type, gift cards, often can&apos;t be reloaded 
 and sometimes can be used only at a specific retailer. 

 Purchases with a branded prepaid 
 card, such as with a Visa logo, are expected to increase from $14 
 billion in 2005 to $38 billion this year, says financial consulting 
 firm Aite Group. 

 &quot;There&apos;s a considerable opportunity 
 here,&quot;says David Robertson, publisher of Nilson Report, a payment 
 newsletter.&quot;The unbanked have historically had to buy money orders 
 and cashier&apos;s checks to pay their bills.&quot; 

 Bart Narter, senior analyst at 
 financial industry consultant Celent, says he expects any fees on 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s card to be less than for similar products on the market. 

 Wal-Mart has said it planned to 
 venture more into financial services after it withdrew its 
 application to operate a bank earlier this year. Wal-Mart already 
 offers check cashing and bill paying, making the prepaid cards a 
 natural extension of services. 

 &quot;Wal-Mart has long stood for low 
 prices and value, and this plan is another page out of that book,&quot;says John Champion, a retail strategist at global consulting firm 
 Kurt Salmon Associates.&quot;The only surprise is that it didn&apos;t occur 
 sooner.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart spokesman Alfredo Padilla 
 said the company won&apos;t comment on the card for a few weeks. 

 GE Money spokesman Michael Ettlemyer 
 said Wal-Mart and GE will announce a partnership in the next few 
 weeks. 

 The Financial Times first reported on 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s plans for the cards on Wednesday. 

 Prepaid payment cards surging 

 Purchases made with branded prepaid 
 cards have nearly doubled in the past year and are expected to top 
 $100 billion by 2010.

 Ackman may target Sears 
 By Sandra Guy - Chicago 
 Sun-Times
June 6, 2007 

Activist investor Bill Ackman, notorious for making 
 executives&apos; lives miserable with demands for change, may go after 
 fellow hedge-fund leader Edward S. Lampert and his Sears Holdings 
 Corp., an analyst speculated Tuesday.

Sears Holdings Corp. owns Sears and Kmart stores.

Ackman won a fight with Lampert last August, when 
 Ackman led dissident shareholders at Sears Canada in a revolt 
 against Lampert&apos;s efforts to push through Sears&apos; $899-million 
 takeover of its Canadian unit. Ackman argued that Sears Canada was 
 worth at least twice what Lampert offered.

Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research 
 firm Gimme Credit, wrote in a note to investors Tuesday that Sears 
 could be a&quot;dark horse&quot; target, possibly 
 so Ackman could lobby for a Sears Canada spinoff to boost 
 shareholder value.

Last week, analyst Sean Egan, managing director at 
 Egan-Jones Ratings Co., raised the speculation that Lampert might 
 buy the 58 percent of Sears Holdings Corp. he doesn&apos;t already own 
 and take it private, given its poor performance.

A spokesman for the Hoffman Estates-based retailer 
 said the company&apos;s policy is to decline comment on speculation.

Ackman reportedly is raising $2 billion through his 
 hedge fund, Pershing Square, to fight for greater shareholder value 
 at an&quot;iconic&quot;American company with a large market capitalization 
 and with undervalued and underperforming divisions.

Speculation on Tuesday centered on Anheuser-Busch, 
 brewer of Budweiser beer, as Ackman&apos;s target. Anheuser-Busch&apos;s stock 
 jumped to a 52-week high of $55.19 before 
 ending the day up nearly 1 percent, at $53.66.

Yet Ackman&apos;s most successful moves have been at 
 retailers and restaurants, Levenson noted.

&quot;And given this, we would nominate Sears as a 
 dark-horse candidate,&quot; Levenson wrote.

Ackman has pushed executives of companies in which 
 his hedge fund invests to enhance shareholder value, including 
 prompting McDonald&apos;s to shed some of its corporate-owned stores, and 
 pressuring Wendy&apos;s to spin off its Tim Hortons chain.
 

 

 

 Wal-Mart Pushes 
 Financial-Services Menu 
 By Kris Hudson - Wall 
 Street Journal
June 6, 2007 

 Acknowledging that it won&apos;t gain a 
 bank charter anytime soon, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is pushing ahead 
 with plans to carve out store space for its existing financial 
 services, such as check cashing and money transfers. 

 The world&apos;s largest retailer by sales 
 now operates MoneyCenters in 170 of its 4,000 U.S. stores, and it 
 plans to increase the number. The shift takes those services from 
 behind customer-service desks and offers them from a separate 
 MoneyCenter counter. 

 &quot;When we started this process, you 
 went to the customer-service desk and waited behind someone who 
 wanted to do an exchange and a refund before you could get your 
 money order,&quot;Wal-Mart Vice Chairman John Menzer told analysts after 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s annual shareholder meeting Friday.&quot;So we now have 
 started to put out our own Wal-Mart MoneyCenters. ... We&apos;ll also 
 have more [financial-services] products to come.&quot; 

 The focus on check cashing, bill 
 payment and other nonbanking services is key for the Bentonville, 
 Ark., retailer as it attempts to find ways to bolster its sales 
 expansion amid a pullback in its construction of new U.S. stores. State-and-federal regulators have stymied Wal-Mart&apos;s 
 attempts to get into banking. In March, Wal-Mart dropped its pursuit 
 of a charter to operate an industrial-loan company, a form of bank, 
 due to intense opposition and a federal moratorium on reviewing such 
 applications. 

 Wal-Mart then pledged to increase its 
 sales by further pursuing nonbanking services. The retailer has yet 
 to unveil its new offerings. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Lee Scott has 
 encouraged company executives&quot;to accelerate the development of 
 those things ... where we can add value in customers&apos; lives through 
 Wal-Mart financial services.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s approach seems far less 
 lucrative than banking. The more than 8,000 community bankers in the 
 U.S. generated income of $139 billion last year, according to the 
 Independent Community Bankers of America, an industry-advocacy 
 group. In comparison, Wal-Mart reported $348.7 million last year in&quot;other income,&quot;a category that includes its financial services. 
 Wal-Mart says its financial-services sales are increasing 30% 
 annually. Yet one of the services that Wal-Mart has quietly unveiled 
 this year -- a low-cost investing service from ShareBuilder Corp. -- 
 will produce little or no revenue for Wal-Mart due to restrictions 
 on revenue sharing with nonbrokerage entities. 

 Camden Fine, president of the 
 community-bankers group, said it is unlikely Wal-Mart can generate 
 the type of revenue increase it needs without adding some type of 
 regulated service, such as banking or mortgage lending, for which it 
 would need state or federal approval.&quot;I think they could do a lot 
 ... to bring more publicity to what they&apos;re already doing,&quot;said Mr. 
 Fine, whose group actively opposed Wal-Mart&apos;s bid to land an 
 industrial-bank charter.&quot;I think they&apos;re going to want to be more 
 robust in terms of commercial financial services.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart caters heavily to customers 
 with little or no access to banking services, often described as the&quot;unbanked&quot;or&quot;underbanked.&quot;Jane Thompson, Wal-Mart&apos;s president of 
 financial services, has said roughly 20% of the U.S. population fits that description, and that segment is well 
 represented within Wal-Mart&apos;s customer base. According to ACNielsen, 
 42% of Wal-Mart shoppers have household incomes of less than 
 $40,000. 

 That makes Wal-Mart a destination for 
 check cashing, bill payment and money transfers. Last year, it 
 handled an average of 1.5 million to two million such transactions 
 each week. Among the buyers are immigrants sending money to their 
 families abroad. 

 Wal-Mart is among many U.S. companies 
 serving the low-income and immigrant populations as big portions of 
 their customer bases. Others have ignited controversy, as was the 
 case with Bank of America Corp. this year for offering a credit card 
 in Southern California for which applicants weren&apos;t required to 
 provide a Social Security or federal tax-identification number. Bank of America says the card isn&apos;t specifically targeted at 
 undocumented workers, and that most of the cardholders have one of 
 the two identifying government numbers.
 
 

 

 Can 
 Lee Scott Overcome Retailer&apos;s Growing Pressures? 
 By Alan Murray - Wall 
 Street Journal
June 6, 2007 

 At Wal-mart&apos;s annual meeting last 
 week, Chief Executive Lee Scott confessed to the intimate group of 
 15,000 assembled in the University of Arkansas&apos; Bud Walton Arena 
 that friends have asked him:&quot;Lee, it seems like sometimes your job 
 must be a drag. How do you get through all that?&quot; 

 Good question. It&apos;s also worth 
 asking: How much longer will he do it? 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s stock has risen about $3 a 
 share since Friday&apos;s festival, which featured speeches by top 
 executives interspersed with jokes from comedian Sinbad and a 
 performance by&quot;American Idol&quot;winner Jordin Sparks. 

 Yet the stock&apos;s rally itself is a 
 sign of Mr. Scott&apos;s troubles. It happened because his critics forced 
 him to raise the white flag of surrender and scale back plans for 
 new-store construction in the U.S. by more than 25%. Instead of spending that money on new stores, the company now 
 plans to return $15 billion to shareholders through buybacks. 

 Other retailers have cut growth 
 plans, and other companies are turning to share buybacks. But for 
 the world&apos;s largest retailer, the latest retreat is an uncomfortable 
 acknowledgment that shareholders have better uses for that money 
 than Mr. Scott does.&quot;This hasn&apos;t been an easy year,&quot;Rob Walton, 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s chairman and son of company founder Sam Walton, told the 
 crowd. 

 The company made a big misstep by 
 trying to sell upscale products to its no-frills customers. 
 Meanwhile, Democratic politicians continue to use it as whipping boy 
 for alleged corporate callousness. Sen. Barack Obama said recently 
 that he wouldn&apos;t shop at a Wal-Mart store, while fellow presidential 
 candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton -- once a director of the company -- 
 called its success a&quot;mixed blessing.&quot; 

 Then there is Julie Roehm, the 
 advertising executive who won&apos;t go away. Wal-Mart says it fired Ms. Roehm because she had an affair with a 
 subordinate, Sean Womack, and took gifts from an advertising firm, 
 DraftFCB, that was angling for Wal-Mart&apos;s business. 

 Ms. Roehm is now defending her honor 
 by trying to trash Mr. Scott&apos;s. Her latest court filing accuses the 
 Wal-Mart CEO of buying&quot;yachts&quot;and&quot;a large pink diamond&quot;at&quot;preferential prices,&quot;and accepting private-plane rides from 
 entrepreneur Irwin Jacobs, whose companies 
 do business with Wal-Mart. She also 
 charged that Mr. Scott&apos;s son, Eric, created&quot;the appearance of a 
 conflict&quot;by going to work for Mr. Jacobs. 

 The courts will have to sort out the 
 truth in all of this. But a close reading of the documents shows Ms. 
 Roehm is far more spirited in attacking Mr. Scott&apos;s supposed 
 misdeeds than in defending her own. She denies the affair with Mr. 
 Womack, but has little to say about the email provided by Mr. 
 Womack&apos;s wife in which he writes to Ms. Roehm:&quot;I think about us 
 together all of the time. Little moments like watching your face 
 when you kiss me.&quot; 

 Likewise, Ms. Roehm denies that she 
 and Mr. Womack were angling for new jobs with DraftFCB. Yet she has 
 scant explanation for an email in which Mr. Womack told Tony Weisman of DraftFCB that he and Ms. Roehm 
 were&quot;both interested in having a [equity] stake in our next gig&quot;and that&quot;in the two of us you have a team that can help lead your 
 organization in a powerful way.&quot;The email, Ms. Roehm says, is&quot;out 
 of context.&quot; 

 Ms. Roehm deserves credit for 
 chutzpah. But she may have met her match in Irwin Jacobs. On Friday, 
 Mr. Jacobs filed a defamation suit against her, saying the 
 accusations involving him are simply untrue. In an interview 
 yesterday, Mr. Jacobs told me that Ms. Roehm and her lawyers&quot;will 
 wish to God they never heard my name, because I will not go 
 away....I will hang onto this thing until I get 100% satisfaction.&quot; 

 Mr. Jacobs says the&quot;yachts&quot;cited in 
 Ms. Roehm&apos;s filing are a couple of fishing boats made by a company 
 controlled by Mr. Scott and purchased at full price. He says he 
 doesn&apos;t own any private airplanes. And while Eric Scott used to work 
 for him, the younger Mr. Scott never did any business involving 
 Wal-Mart. As for the diamond, Mr. Jacobs says he knew nothing about 
 it until he read about it in the newspaper. 

 &quot;Lee never lets me pick up a check 
 for anything,&quot;says Mr. Jacobs.&quot;It&apos;s almost comical.&quot; 

 Still, the combination of sluggish 
 stock performance and persistent attacks must be taking their toll 
 on Mr. Scott. And they are clearly taking their toll on the company 
 he runs. 

 At Friday&apos;s meeting, Rob Walton, 
 whose family owns 40% of the company&apos;s stock, gave the CEO what 
 seemed to be a ringing endorsement.&quot;The board and the Walton family 
 have absolute confidence in your leadership, Lee. We appreciate you 
 and we thank you.&quot; 

 But when such public displays of 
 support become necessary, you have to wonder how long they will 
 last.
 

 

 Morgan 
 Stanley to spin off Discover in June 
 Investment bank to sell 
 capital-intensive credit card business,
to trade under new symbol 
 July 2 
 Reuters.com
June 1, 2007 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Morgan Stanley 
 plans to complete its spin-off of Discover Financial Services on 
 June 30, according to a regulatory filing Friday, letting the U.S. 
 investment bank cut its credit card ties for good. 

 Morgan Stanley (up $1.03 to $86.07), 
 which intends to focus on securities trading, investment banking and 
 money management, also said the Internal Revenue Service ruled the 
 distribution of Discover shares would not be subject to federal 
 income taxes. 

 The investment bank expects a limited&quot;when issued&quot;trading market for Discover common stock to begin on 
 or about the week of June 11. Regular trades, under the symbol&quot;DFS,&quot;would start July 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Morgan Stanley shares rose $1.00, or 
 1 percent, to $86.02 in afternoon trade. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment beyond the 
 filing. 

 Since it was launched as a unit of 
 retailer Sears Roebuck&amp;Co. in 1986, Discover has grown to become 
 one of the largest credit card companies in the world with $46.3 
 billion in outstanding loans as of Feb. 28. 

 Yet investors pushed Morgan Stanley 
 in recent years to shed the business, arguing that Discover slowed 
 the overall growth of the securities company, while focused Wall 
 Street firms like Goldman Sachs Group (down $0.36 to $230.46, 
 Charts, Fortune 500) generated record results. 

 Last December Morgan Stanley 
 announced it would issue 100 percent of Discover to shareholders in 
 a tax-free spin-off in its fiscal third quarter. The bank will issue one Discover share for every two Morgan 
 Stanley shares held to shareholders of record on June 18. 

 Analysts say Morgan Stanley&apos;s return 
 on equity will rise without Discover, a capital-intensive business. 

 Up until the past year or so, 
 Discover struggled to build up loan balances, offering a card many 
 view as downscale. Indeed, Discover touts more than 50 million card 
 holders, but only 18.4 million active accounts. 

 It also runs a mostly-U.S. payment 
 network with 4 million merchants, trailing much larger systems 
 operated by Visa, Mastercard (up $1.35 to $150.90, Charts) and 
 American Express (down $0.08 to $64.90, Charts, Fortune 500) that are accessible around the world. 

 Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover 
 earned $1.89 a share last year and 42 cents a share in the first 
 quarter. It reported $5.43 billion in stockholder equity at the end 
 of February, according to the filing. 

 The spin-off is intended to boost the 
 market value of both companies by letting Morgan Stanley focus on 
 the securities business and by giving Discover independence and a 
 currency it can use to expand its card and payment network 
 businesses. 

 &quot;Discover will be able to build on 
 its strong brand and significant scale to execute its growth 
 strategy,&quot;Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack said in a 
 statement Friday. Morgan Stanley executives and analysts expect 
 shares of Discover, as a pure-play card and payments company, to 
 fetch a higher multiple to earnings than Morgan Stanley, which 
 trades at about 10.4 times estimated 2007 earnings. 

 In April, Credit Suisse analysts 
 estimated Discover shares could trade at $10 to $14, based on a 
 multiple of 12 to 16.
 

 

 Wal-Mart Scales Back Expansion,
Approves $15 Billion Stock Buyback 
 By Gary McWilliams - 
 Dow Jones Newswires
June 1, 2007 

 FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart Stores 
 Inc., responding to criticism its U.S. business is maturing, said it would cut by more than a third its 
 planned additions of new U.S. supercenter stores, delay some 
 openings and sharply limit future U.S. store expansion. 

 The world&apos;s largest retailer had been 
 under pressure on Wall Street to slow its U.S. store expansion and 
 use the savings to prop up its flagging stock price. The move will 
 cut capital expenditures this year by $1.5 billion, to $15.5 billion, leaving the total about flat with last year. 

 Thomas Schoewe, Wal-Mart&apos;s chief 
 financial officer, told investors at its annual meeting here that 
 the company would repurchase up to $15 billion in shares through an 
 undefined period. It will fund the buybacks with new borrowings with 
 savings from the fewer store openings. 

 Investors had been urging the company 
 to slash spending on new stores and use the savings to boost 
 per-share earnings by buying back shares. Wal-Mart said its square 
 footage growth rate will be approximately 6% for this year and next. 
 It estimated U.S. square footage growth of about 4% to 5% during the 
 next two years. Wall Street had been pushing for the company to 
 halve its about 8% growth in square footage. 

 News of the capital-spending cutback 
 and share repurchase cheered investors, sending shares up nearly 
 4.4%, or $2.12, $49.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
 Exchange. 

 Wal-Mart this year will now open or 
 relocate 190 to 200 U.S. stores, down from the planned 265 to 270 
 new store openings. Last fall, the company had said it would trim 
 new store construction this year but then announced plans to add 
 about 265 to 270 stores this year, a slight reduction from the prior 
 year. 

 The Bentonville, Ark., retailer said 
 it will open about 170 new U.S. stores annually through 2010.&quot;While 
 we feel comfortable with these estimates, we will continue to review 
 and evaluate our expansion strategy on an annual basis,&quot;John Menzer, 
 the company&apos;s chief administrative officer said in a statement. 

 In addition to curbing new store 
 expansion, Wal-Mart said it will delay some of the planned new 
 stores. About 80 of the about 200,000-square-foot supercenters that 
 it originally expected to open next January won&apos;t be opened until 
 later in calendar 2008. It has about 4,000 stores in the U.S. today. It said store expansion for its Sam&apos;s Club wholesale 
 unit and its international operations would be unaffected by the 
 U.S. cutbacks. 

 H. Lee Scott Jr., Wal-Mart&apos;s chief 
 executive officer, praised the company&apos;s performance but added,&quot;Make no mistake about it: The macro economic environment is 
 difficult for our customers.&quot; 

 U.S. same-store sales, a measure of 
 the efficiency of existing stores, have been weak for much of the 
 last year. Its same-store sales in April tumbled 3.5%, a 
 larger-than-expected figure. 

 Separately, Wal-Mart Chairman Robson 
 Walton, whose family controls about 40% of the stock of the world&apos;s 
 largest retailer, strongly endorsed the company&apos;s chief executive at 
 its annual meeting here. 

 His remarks, amid the pomp of its 
 annual meeting extravaganza, came a week after a fired former 
 executive accused Mr. Scott and other executives of violating the 
 company&apos;s ethics code governing relationships with suppliers. The company has denied the allegations. 

 &quot;Few people are as passionate about 
 our mission and our people as the man who stands at the center of 
 that mission, Lee Scott,&quot;said Mr. Walton, a son of Wal-Mart founder 
 Sam Walton.&quot;I know it&apos;s not always easy. You should know our board 
 and the Walton family have absolute confidence in you, Lee. We appreciate you and we thank you.&quot;
 

 

 S upply 
 and C ommand: I nterview 
 with Gus Pagonis 
 By Mitch Mac Donald - The DC Velocity Q&amp;A
 June 1, 2007 

 He&apos;s moved ammo for the army, and 
 he&apos;s moved dishwashers for Sears. But Gus Pagonis says that no 
 matter what&apos;s in the trucks or on the ships, the same principles of 
 logistics management apply. 

 An old adage has it that generals 
 always do a great job of fighting the last war. But in the case of 
 one general - three-star lieutenant 
 general Gus Pagonis - t hat shot couldn&apos;t 
 be farther from the mark. When masterminding the military supply 
 chain in the first Gulf War, Pagonis didn&apos;t hesitate to use all that 
 modern technology had to offer, revolutionizing military logistics 
 in the process. Under his command, for example, the Army began using 
 GPS technology to track the movement of the food, water, gas and 
 ammo needed to feed and clothe battalions of GIs and keep them 
 equipped for battle - a management feat 
 that General Norman Schwarzkopf lauded as a gigantic accomplishment. 

 In the months following the Gulf War, 
 Pagonis wrote a book about his experiences. That book, Moving 
 Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics from the Gulf War, 
 caught the eye of Arthur Martinez, then chairman and CEO of Sears, 
 who hired Pagonis to run the giant retailer&apos;s supply chain. Pagonis 
 soon found himself applying the same management techniques he used 
 for moving nearly 500,000 soldiers and seven million tons of 
 supplies halfway around the world to the home delivery of 
 appliances. Although Pagonis retired from the retailer last year, 
 his legacy remains at Sears, where staffers still hold his trademark&quot;standup&quot;meetings (Pagonis famously banned chairs from staff 
 meetings to discourage non-essential discussions) and submit their 
 ideas in summaries that fit on a 3 by 5 index card. 

 Given Pagonis&apos;s military and business 
 accomplishments, it&apos;s hardly a surprise that he remains much in 
 demand today - as a consultant, as a 
 speaker at meetings and conferences, and as an advisor and board 
 member for some leading logistics companies. Pagonis currently 
 serves as chairman of the board at RailAmerica Inc., the world&apos;s 
 largest short line railroad. He is the vice chairman of the board 
 for Genco - a logistics service company 
 that specializes in reverse logistics. He also chairs the volunteer 
 Department of Defense Business Board, established by Secretary of 
 Defense Donald Rumsfeld to encourage the sharing of ideas among 
 private sector companies and the military. 

 Pagonis spoke recently with DC 
 VELOCITY Editorial Director Mitch Mac Donald, sharing his thoughts 
 on the similarities between military and private-sector logistics, 
 the importance of salesmanship to logistics success, and how he 
 would shake things up if he came to work at DC VELOCITY. 

 Q: During your career, you&apos;ve 
 masterminded the supply chain for both the military and in private industry. As you look back, what strikes you 
 most about your career? 

 A: I&apos;d say it&apos;s the way my work 
 experiences have mirrored the changes in the profession overall - including some big shifts in the terminology we use. When I started out 
 at Penn State as an undergraduate, the 
 discipline was called physical distribution and was
pretty much limited to transportation and warehousing. When I joined 
 the military back
in 1964, the term logistics was coming into wider use, though not 
 really in the private sector at that 
 point. As I migrated from the military world to the private sector, I saw the wider use of the term logistics and 
 an expansion of   what 
 that meant in terms of overall management of the process, well 
 beyond just transportation and 
 warehousing. Then the term supply chain management came along, which in essence, is just a deeper, more integrated 
 approach to improving logistics operations 
 and processes. 

 But I want to emphasize that this 
 isn&apos;t a case where we&apos;ve just kept doing the same things and found new, splashy 
 names for what we do. The whole approach to logistics and supply chain management has forced us to take a 
 closer look at what we do and how we get 
 things done. 

 We&apos;ve learned that it&apos;s better to be 
 fully integrated across a company, and we&apos;ve seen a lot of companies establish a track record of using 
 logistics and supply chain excellence as a 
 driver of business success. 

 Q: Why do logistics and supply chain 
 management have such a deep impact on a 
business&apos;s fortunes ? 

 A: It&apos;s the connection with the 
 customer. There are few, if any, other parts of   a company&apos;s operations 
 that have more steady or direct contact with the customer. In fact, my career in logistics didn&apos;t grow out of 
 an interest in the discipline. It really 
 evolved from my interest in the customer. I joined the military and I went into the infantry because that&apos;s where 
 the&quot;customer&quot; was. I feel that for 
 logisticians to be successful, they really need to understand
their customer, whether it is in the military or in the main sector. 

 Q: Do you think a typical logistics 
 professional understands the customer? 

 A: That a tough one to answer. Some 
 do. Some don&apos;t. Overall, though, I think more and more at least understand the relationship between logistics 
 and customer service. You have to remember 
 that although some of today&apos;s logistics leaders grew up in the
profession and have a strong tactical knowledge of logistics, an 
 awful lot of today&apos;s high-level logistics 
 executives didn&apos;t start out in that field. They were simply talented executives who migrated to leadership 
 positions in this discipline when a 
 logistics job opened up, as a way to advance their careers. 

 I think the executives who have 
 backgrounds in areas other than logistics might   
bring a bit more of a customer-service focus to their jobs, while 
 those executives who are career logistics 
 pros bring a deeper knowledge of the actual operations of logistics. Together, it can lead to good 
 things. If you can bring together that mix 
 of skills and backgrounds, you can achieve both logistics and customer service excellence. 

 That&apos;s where you start seeing some of 
 the basic principles of successful supply 
 chain management. When you bring together folks with different perspectives and areas of focus - like 
 sales, marketing and customer service - and place them all on a team that has wide-ranging and comprehensive responsibility to serve the customer, you have 
 a chance for a
real breakthrough in performance. 

 You have to keep in mind that this 
 whole supply chain thing is unique. There are
probably only a couple of people in the entire world who can 
 truthfully be said to manage a supply 
 chain from end to end. Most of them are facilitators or coordinators. They coordinate the various functions because 
 they don&apos;t own all of the process. 

 We see people with the title&quot;VP of 
 Supply Chain,&quot;but really, there are only 
 a few guys in the whole world who own the supply chain. After all, 
 the supply chain includes every step in 
 the process: bringing up the raw materials, processing them, transporting them, moving them to a plant, 
 manufacturing and converting those raw 
 materials into a product, delivering that product to a distribution center, delivering it to a retail store for sale to a consumer, and then recycling it after the 
 customer is done. 

 Q: From what you&apos;ve just described, 
 there&apos;s actually very little that happens 
 within a company that doesn&apos;t touch the supply chain. 

 A: Yes. That&apos;s why I maintain that 
 most of us, including myself at Sears, are 
 what I think of as&quot;supply chain coordinators.&quot;In other words, at 
 Sears, I commanded certain functions of 
 the supply chain, no question about it. I coordinated or facilitated the transportation, the warehousing, and 
 a lot of the other processes, right? 
 Here&apos;s the rub, though. I wasn&apos;t truly in charge of Sears&apos; entire supply chain because a truly integrated supply 
 chain extends
far beyond the borders of any single company. It&apos;s a sprawling 
 network that stretches from that company&apos;s 
 vendors and partners all the way to that company&apos;s customers. Some executives in the private sector find this 
 all terribly frustrating. Everyone wants 
 ownership and control of the complete process. It&apos;s simply not possible to have that and have a top-flight 
 supply chain process. It&apos;s interesting, in 
 the military, we use a lot more dotted lines to describe areas of responsibility and accountability and 
 process. I found in the civilian
sector people have a much harder time with that. 

 Q: Everybody wants one boss, and they 
 want it to be very clear whom they work 
 for. 

 A: Don&apos;t get me wrong. I&apos;m a great 
 believer in that. There should be a single 
 point of contact. There should be one person in charge, but you 
 absolutely can and will have dotted lines. 
 As a supply chain coordinator, you do not own the buying of the merchandise, but 
 you&apos;d better have a system in place for coordinating with the people who do because details like the way the merchandise is packaged or where the bar-code label is placed 
 on the boxes have a major effect on how 
 efficiently that box moves through the supply chain to the end customer. Again, the critical component of that is knowing 
 the customer. As I said, I went into the 
 infantry, then I migrated to transportation and
eventually I became a logistician. In each instance, my job was to 
 serve the customer. 

 Q: That&apos;s the second time you&apos;ve said 
 that. You said you selected the infantry 
because that&apos;s where the customer was. Can you expand on that a 
 little bit? 

 A: Yes. In the military, the guy 
 carrying the rifle is the customer. He&apos;s the one carrying out the core mission of the military: He has to 
 close in on and destroy the enemy. But he 
 can&apos;t do it alone. For every guy carrying a rifle, there are about 12 people in the Army to support him. 
 Everything the other 12 folks do is all 
 about helping that soldier, the customer, fulfill his or her mission. If it weren&apos;t for the guy carrying the rifle, no 
 other service
would be needed. 

 Q: There you are. And in the private 
 sector, if it weren&apos;t for the customer, there wouldn&apos;t be any need for all the activities we call logistics 
 and supply chain management, right? 

 A: None at all. 

 Q: On the subject of comparisons 
 between your experiences in military logistics
and your time in the private sector, have you come across any 
 situations in which
principles of military logistics simply didn&apos;t apply in the private 
 sector? 

 A: I&apos;ve got to tell you, I can&apos;t 
 think of anything. Everything logistical in the military has a direct application in the civilian sector. 
 The difference is the consequences aren&apos;t 
 so dire - i t&apos;s not a matter of life and 
 death. For example, if you don&apos;t get the 
 ammunition to the troops in a timely manner - or water or medical supplies, for 
 that matte r - lives can be lost. That&apos;s 
 why I had a lot of fun at Sears because 
 without that kind of stress, there&apos;s hardly anything you can&apos;t accomplish. 

 Q: It must have been a relief to be 
 able to practice your craft without the pressure of knowing someone&apos;s life depended on your actions. 

 A: There is no question about it. You 
 still have to have urgency. You still have 
 to be dynamic because you&apos;re competing against competitors and all 
 that, but it certainly helps you keep your 
 perspective. 

 Q: In your experience, what&apos;s the 
 single most important trait of a successful   supply chain manager? 

 A: Leadership. Supply chain 
 management is truly one discipline in the business
world for which you must possess leadership abilities if you hope to succeed. If   you&apos;re leading a 
 marketing or finance operation at a very high level, for example, you&apos;re working with and supported by college 
 graduates. They are themselves experts in 
 their fields. When you&apos;re working in the supply chain, by contrast, in many instances the person executing your 
 great new idea drives a truck or a 
 forklift. It&apos;s much more important, even critical, to get through a chain of command from the top to the bottom. That means 
 your rules have to be simple, 
 understandable and concise. They have to be translated into the
right language for the person executing the mission. 

 Q: You&apos;ve gained a certain amount of 
 fame for importing some leadership practices you used in the military to your management job in the 
 private sector. I&apos;m talking about your&quot;stand-up&quot;staff meetings, where you banned sitting in order to keep the discussions moving, and your insistence that staffers submit reports and proposals boiled down to fit 
 on index cards, not multi-page memos. What 
 reaction did you get when you brought these
principles to Sears? Did people embrace them or did they just roll 
 their eyes? 

 A: It takes some selling. For 
 example, if I were to come to work for your publishing company and wanted to implement stand-ups, the 
 first thing I would do is gather everybody 
 in a room and give them a class. I would sell them on the idea. I would list the benefits. I would demonstrate the 
 value of doing this. If you do it that way 
 and get a buy-in from everybody, people will embrace your management style, no matter what it is. 

 When I joined Sears, I went on a 
 campaign of sorts, selling these concepts. I spent the entire first month doing nothing but visiting all my 
 people at all my facilities. I presented 
 my leadership style. I explained my view on how we could most effectively communicate. I laid
out my vision for, essentially, how we were going to function. I got 
 a total buy-in. By the beginning of my 
 second month on the job, my ideas were being implemented everywhere. Many places in Sears now use 
 stand-ups and the index card reporting 
 format. I&apos;m gone, but the practices remain. 

 Q: Did you get a lot of push back 
 from people? 

 A: Not 
 really. I don&apos;t try to force my management techniques on anyone. If they&apos;re working directly for me, they have to either show me 
 a better way of doing it or use my 
 techniques. If other people within the organization who don&apos;t [report] to me want to use them, that&apos;s fine with me, 
 but I don&apos;t force it on them. I have found 
 through the years that people like to communicate. They like to keep it short and concise. They just need to have 
 some guidelines. 

 Q: Sure. It forces them to cut 
 through the fog of details and get to the point, right? 

 A: Yes. Just think about it. Our 
 society has changed dramatically with the use of information technology. We&apos;re inundated with information every minute of every day. There are still many 
 of us who are getting 300 e-mails a week. 
 Nobody has time to read them all. 

 Q: So you&apos;re saying that in addition 
 to strong leadership traits, a successful 
 leader in this field also needs to possess a certain amount of 
 salesmanship? 

 A: Salesmanship and an understanding 
 of how to put together a team. I once went
to a rodeo whose events included a race among teams of six horses, 
 with each team pulling a covered wagon. I 
 happened to meet the guy driving one of those teams after the event. He explained to me how the fastest 
 horse wasn&apos;t the lead horse because it 
 would kill the other five horses. The lead horse was a steady horse, one who was pretty fast. The fastest horse was 
 placed second. He urged them on. The same 
 thing goes with human beings. You have to work as a team. A team effort means the leader determines the capability of 
 all his subordinates and then he puts 
 together a team. In the military, teamwork is absolutely essential to everything you do. 
 There&apos;s absolutely no room for anybody who is not a team player. 

 Q: If you were talking to young folks 
 who were thinking about entering the logistics field, how would you advise them to proceed? 

 A: First of all, I&apos;d suggest that 
 they check into the wonderful programs of study in logistics and supply chain management offered by colleges 
 in the United States. In addition to 
 seeking out formal instruction, I would tell them that they&apos;ve got to have a strong understanding of the 
 capabilities technology can offer. 
 Information technology is the cement that holds everything together in the supply chain. It takes you into a high-speed world. It 
 allows you to do the analytical work 
 needed to determine where your problem areas are. The next thing I would tell these kids is if you have a chance to sign 
 up for electives, take an industrial 
 engineering course. It&apos;s a wonderful tool for analytically
laying out functions and that&apos;s what you do in the supply chain. 

 Q: How about advice for those already 
 in the profession - the people who face new
challenges every day in the form of rapidly changing technology, globalization and ever-more-demanding customers. Any thoughts 
 on things they should be doing to stay up 
 to date? 

 A: Yes. I personally think there are 
 wonderful conferences going on out there, 
 probably too many. Someone told me - though I don&apos;t know how accurate this figure is - that there are more than 5,000 
 supply chain/logistical conferences held each year. You need to pick the right ones for you and go out there 
 and get yourself educated by listening to 
 other people. You&apos;re never too old to learn. I like to seek out conferences that have very strong keynote 
 speakers. Keynote speakers are essential. 
 You go there. You listen to the keynote speaker. It gets you revitalized. It gives you new ideas. It is a wonderful way to 
 really get yourself up to speed.
 

 

 Private party for Sears? 
 By Sandra Guy - Chicago 
 Sun-Times
June 1, 2007 

 Could billionaire hedge-fund manager 
 Edward Lampert&apos;s next step be buying the 58 percent of Sears 
 Holdings Corp. he doesn&apos;t already own? 

 Or could he use the retailer&apos;s cash 
 hoard for big share buybacks? 

 Analyst Sean Egan, managing director 
 at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., raised the speculation Thursday after 
 Sears Holdings reported flat fiscal first-quarter profits, excluding 
 one-time gains, and continuing declines in same-store sales at Sears 
 and Kmart. 

 If the stock market fails to suitably 
 value Sears&apos; shares, Lampert could take the company private, 
 according to Egan&apos;s analysis. Thursday&apos;s market performance began to 
 set the stage as investors punished the stock, sending it down 
 $3.23, or 1.8 percent, to close at $180.02 and wiping out $497 
 million in market value. 

 Analysts clearly want Lampert to make 
 a move to turn around the flailing retailer. 

 Sears would be an attractive buyout 
 target by either Lampert himself or a private equity firm. Egan 
 based his analysis on Sears&apos; healthy cash flow and a share price of 
 about $180 -- attractively low compared with Sears&apos; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
 amortization, commonly called EBITDA, or earnings before the bad 
 stuff. EBITDA is a key measure of cash generated by a company, and 
 indicates a company&apos;s ability to pay its debts. 

 Sears&apos; cash flow and ability to pay 
 debts are very good indeed, totaling about $4 billion this year, 
 according to Egan&apos;s calculations. 

 A buyer could put up 30 percent of 
 his own money for Sears -- valued at $29.9 
 billion -- and borrow money for the remaining 70 percent, paying 
 12.5 percent interest on the debt. 

 Using Sears&apos; free cash flow, the 
 prospective buyer could pay interest on his debt, and still earn a 
 return of a stunning 92 percent on his equity investment, according 
 to the analysis. 

 But a Sears&apos; takeover by a 
 private-equity firm would have to be hostile because Lampert appears 
 firmly in control for the long term, the analysis concluded. 

 Analyst Richard Hastings of Bernard 
 Sands wrote in a note to investors Thursday that Sears has reached a 
 crossroads because the retailer&apos;s income from net property assets is 
 plunging. 

 Sears Holdings&apos; total income before 
 deductions of interest and taxes, called EBIT, grew 13.07 percent in 
 the quarter versus last fiscal year&apos;s&quot;stunning&quot; 47 percent increase, Hastings wrote. 

 Lampert must shutter weak stores and 
 spend to improve others, or risk a slowdown in his strategy of 
 building cash, Hastings said. 

 Sears CEO Aylwin Lewis conceded 
 Thursday that the retailer needs to do a better job appealing to 
 shoppers. 

 Sales at stores open at least a year 
 -- a telling sign of a retailer&apos;s health -- were down 3.4 percent at 
 Sears -- 1 percentage point worse than predicted -- and down 4.4 
 percent at Kmart. The combined drop was 3.9 percent year over year. 

 The only bright spot was Lands&apos; End 
 apparel at Sears, where sales increased by an unspecified amount. 

 Same-store sales for Sears and Kmart 
 combined have declined each year since Lampert engineered Kmart&apos;s 
 $12.3 billion takeover of Sears on March 24, 2005. 

 The last same-store sales increase 
 occurred during Christmas 2006, when Kmart&apos;s year-over-year sales 
 inched up 0.9 percent. It was the first increase at Kmart in four 
 years. 

 For the first quarter of 2007, 
 one-time gains boosted Sears Holdings&apos; profit 20 percent in what 
 would have otherwise been a flat quarter, the Hoffman Estates-based 
 retailer announced. 

 Total sales also dropped, down 2.5 
 percent, to $11.7 billion. 

 Sears blamed tough competition, bad 
 weather and pressures on its shoppers ranging from high gasoline 
 prices to a slowing housing market, for the poor results. 

 Lewis said,&quot;As an organization, we 
 need to overcome these factors by better controlling costs and 
 developing innovative solutions that better meet our customers&apos; 
 needs&quot;and generate more profit. 

 For the quarter, which ended May 5, 
 net income rose to $216 million, or $1.40 per share, from $180 
 million, or $1.14 cents per share, a year earlier. 

 Without the one-time items, profit 
 would have equalled $1.10 per share versus $1.11 a year ago. The 
 one-time items included a lawsuit settlement, insurance payments for 
 hurricane damage and a gain from freezing the pension benefits and 
 eliminating post-retirement medical, dental and life-insurance 
 benefits for future Sears Canada retirees. 

 Analysts had expected a quarterly 
 profit of $1.22 a share on revenue of
$11.6 billion. 

 As has been Lampert&apos;s strategy, Sears 
 benefitted from cost-cutting and fewer markdowns. 

 Return swaps, a risky kind of trading 
 in exotic derivatives that Lampert controls, hurt Sears in the first 
 quarter by reducing pre-tax income by $13 million, or 8 cents a 
 share. 

 Lampert outlined a variety of 
 turnaround initiatives at the retailer&apos;s May 4 shareholders&apos; 
 meeting, including taking another stab at celebrity fashions, 
 expanding its Lands&apos; End shops inside Sears stores and introducing 
 an advertising campaign that harkens to the glory days of the Sears 
 catalog. 

 Sears also has started a test in 
 which its in-home repair crews pitch sales of new appliances when a 
 broken appliance looks beyond repair.
 

 

 Sears reports 
 8th-straight sales decline 
Net income up 20%,
but profit falls short of Wall St. forecasts
 From Chicago Tribune news 
 services
June 1, 2007 

 Sears Holdings Corp. on Thursday said 
 first-quarter net income grew 20 percent thanks to one-time gains, 
 but excluding items the Hoffman Estates-based retailer&apos;s earnings 
 missed estimates and sales fell for the eighth-straight quarter. 

 Net income climbed to $216 million, 
 or $1.40 a share, from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. One-time items lifted profit by $44 
 million, or 30 cents a share. With one-time items stripped out, 
 Sears said it earned $1.10 a share, well below Wall Street forecasts 
 of $1.21 a share. 

 Revenue declined 2.5 percent, to 
 $11.7 billion. Sales at Kmart and Sears stores open at least a year 
 fell 3.9 percent, the eighth drop in a row since Chairman Edward 
 Lampert merged the two retailers in March 2005. Such sales, called 
 same-store sales, are considered the best indicator of a retailer&apos;s 
 health. 

 Same-store sales fell 3.4 percent at 
 the Sears division, more than the retailer had forecast on May 3. 
 Kmart&apos;s same-store sales declined 4.4 percent on lower sales of home 
 goods, health and beauty products and most other categories. 

 The company is beginning new 
 advertising campaigns for Sears and Kmart to win back sales lost to 
 J.C. Penney Co. and Kohl&apos;s Corp., which have added designer clothes 
 to appeal to more trend-conscious consumers. Lampert said last month 
 that fixing retail operations was&quot;a priority&quot;for Sears. 

 &quot;They have to take a page out of J.C. 
 Penney&apos;s playbook and revitalize the brands and improve sales,&quot;said 
 Arun Daniel at ING Investments LLC in New York. Sears is ceding 
 market share to rival department stores, he said. 

 Sears said shoppers trimmed purchases 
 of appliances and other home goods because of higher gasoline costs 
 and a slumping U.S. housing market. Gasoline prices rose 39 percent during the quarter, and house prices 
 in the first quarter increased at the slowest pace in a decade, 
 according to government data. 

 &quot;In part, our domestic operating 
 results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being 
 faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower 
 housing market,&quot;said Sears Holdings Chief Executive Aylwin Lewis. 

 But some analysts weren&apos;t buying such 
 comments. 

 &quot;In addition to the usual excuses of 
 weather, energy costs and the housing market, management also cited 
 &apos;competition,&apos; surely not a novel factor in retailing,&quot;Carol 
 Levenson of bond analysis firm Gimme Credit said in a report.&quot;Much 
 as management would like investors to ignore such trivia as 
 same-store sales, we can&apos;t help but think they would be the first to 
 point to these figures if they weren&apos;t so consistently lousy.&quot; 

 Sears had $3.4 billion in cash and 
 cash equivalents as of May 5. Lampert has said he&apos;ll use surplus 
 cash for investments. 

 &quot;The basic business is doing OK,&quot;said Scott Rothbort, president of Millburn, N.J.-based Lakeview 
 Asset Management, which counts Sears among its top holdings. 

 &quot;The real reason people invest in 
 Sears is because of the strong balance sheet and the future 
 potential which Eddie Lampert brings,&quot;he said. 

 Shares of Sears lost $3.23, to 
 $180.02, on the Nasdaq stock market.
 

 

 Preston Martin, vocal former Fed vice chairman and
S&amp;L regulator, dies at 83 
 By E. Scott Reckard - Los Angeles Times
June 1, 2007 

 Preston Martin, an economist and 
 financial regulator who served as the outspoken vice chairman of the 
 Federal Reserve in the mid-1980s and later took part in private 
 efforts to revive troubled savings and loans, has died.
He was 83. 

 Martin, a Los Angeles native, died 
 peacefully Wednesday at his home in San Francisco after a brief 
 battle with cancer, daughter-in-law Margaret Lowrie Robertson said 
 Thursday. 

 As the top S&amp;L regulator for 
 California and then the nation in the late 1960s and early 1970s, 
 Martin foresaw the looming problems that would later cripple the 
 thrifts, advocating adjustable-rate mortgages and a secondary market 
 for buying loans to diminish the risk of the business, said William 
 J. Popejoy, a banking executive ally. 

 Adjustable-rate mortgages didn&apos;t 
 become widely available until after the collapse of the S&amp;L industry 
 in the 1980s; earlier, Martin had overseen the creation in 1970 of 
 the Federal Home Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, which buys loans 
 and packages them into securities for sale to investors. 

 &quot;Freddie Mac was his baby,&quot;said 
 Popejoy, who joined Freddie Mac shortly after its founding and whom 
 Martin promoted to be its president and chief executive less than 
 two years later. 

 The affable Martin was&quot;irrepressible&quot;in arguing his positions, Popejoy added:&quot;Sometimes people would sort of get blown back by him, 
 because he was almost evangelical about the things he believed in.&quot; 

 As a teenager, Martin delivered 
 newspapers in the Hollywood Hills after his father died, then paid 
 his way through USC by grading papers and working the graveyard 
 shift at a Lockheed plant, said his wife, Genevieve Martin. After 
 Army service, he earned a doctorate in monetary economics at Indiana 
 University before returning to USC, where he taught finance and 
 economics to graduate students for 15 years. 

 But he was inclined to business as 
 well as academia, starting a mortgage company and a real-estate 
 development firm, and consulting for S&amp;Ls. Publicly berating the thrift industry for its stodginess in the 
 latter role, he caught the attention of then-California Gov. Ronald 
 Reagan, who appointed him commissioner of S&amp;Ls for the state in 
 1967. 

 Two years later, President Nixon 
 named Martin chairman of the national S&amp;L regulator, the Federal 
 Home Loan Bank Board, which under Martin liberalized the rules for 
 thrifts, allowing them to issue long-term certificates of deposit as 
 well as passbook accounts and to write consumer loans in addition to 
 mortgages. 

 He plunged back into private business 
 in 1972, founding PMI Mortgage Insurance, which he sold to Allstate 
 Insurance, then part of Sears, Roebuck&amp;Co. He stayed on to manage 
 PMI and later became head of Sears&apos; financial services group but 
 became frustrated with the corporate bureaucracy and eager to return 
 to public service, his wife said. 

 The opportunity came in 1982, when 
 Reagan, then president, named him Fed vice chairman. Violating 
 unwritten rules of deference at the central bank, Martin spoke 
 openly about his differences with then-Chairman Paul Volcker, 
 causing Fortune magazine to headline one story:&quot;The Man Who Would 
 Be Volcker.&quot; 

 When reporters read Martin&apos;s comments 
 on the international debt crisis to Volcker, the Fed chairman shot 
 back, calling them&quot;incomprehensible&quot;as reported. Martin resigned 
 from the Fed in 1986 at the end of his four-year term as vice 
 chairman amid reports that he had sought the chairmanship himself; 
 instead, Alan Greenspan would be appointed. 

 In the attempt to breathe life into 
 failing thrifts and banks, Martin joined a partnership headed by 
 former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, which took control of 
 failing institutions with the help of the federal government. The 
 group succeeded in turning around two Hawaii-based institutions but 
 was unsuccessful in saving several Southland S&amp;Ls, notably Western 
 Federal Savings&amp;Loan and Southern California Savings. 

 In recent years, Martin devoted time 
 to nonprofit work on inner-city housing and financial education 
 issues, wrote a book,&quot;The Complete Idiot&apos;s Guide to the Federal 
 Reserve,&quot;and was a frequent commentator on economic issues for 
 television and radio networks. 

 &quot;He was a bit of a ham, and he liked 
 being on TV,&quot;his wife said. 

 In addition to his wife and 
 daughter-in-law, Martin is survived by a son, Pier, of Las Vegas, 
 two granddaughters, Audrey and Emily; three stepdaughters; and five 
 step-grandchildren. 


 

 

 Sears 1Q 
 Net 20% Up On Items, Sales Fall 2.5% 
 Dow Jones Newswires
May 31, 2007 

 Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) said 
 fiscal first-quarter net income rose 20%, boosted by extraordinary 
 items including a legal-settlement gain and a gain from Sears 
 Canda&apos;s post-retirement benefit plans curtailment. 

 However, the Hoffman Estates, Ill., 
 broadline retailer&apos;s sales fell 2.5%, reflecting the weak retail and 
 housing markets. 

 &quot;In part, our domestic operating 
 results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being 
 faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower 
 housing market,&quot;said Chief Executive and President Aylwin Lewis. 
 Lewis added that the company needs to better control costs and 
 develop programs that meet customers&apos; needs. 

 Net income increased to $216 million, 
 or $1.40 a share, from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, a year 
 earlier. 

 Excluding items, earnings for the 
 quarter ended May 5 were $1.10 a share, down from $1.11 a share a 
 year ago. 

 On average, analysts polled by 
 Thomson Financial expected earnings of $1.22 a share. Earlier this 
 month, Sears said it expected first-quarter earnings of $1.30 to 
 $1.53 a share and net income between $200 million and $235 million. 

 Sears said revenue fell to $11.7 
 billion from $12 billion a year earlier. Analysts were looking for revenue of $11.55 billion. 

 Same-store sales, or sales at stores 
 open at least a year, fell 3.9%. Sears domestic same-store sales 
 fell 3.4%, while Kmart&apos;s same-store sales fell 4.4%. Sears said 
 same-store sales were hurt by rising energy costs, a slower housing 
 market and poor weather conditions in the latter part of the fiscal 
 first quarter. 

 Earlier this month, Chairman Edward 
 Lampert said Sears is considering acquisition and investment 
 opportunities after laying low for two years following the 
 acquisition of Sears by Kmart. 

 Sears shares fell 2.3% to $178.95 in 
 recent premarket trading.
 

 

 Clearance Sale at Sears 
 By Evelyn M. Rusli - Forbes.com
May 31, 2007 

 Billionaire Eddie Lampert managed to 
 squeeze out a bit more value out of Sears Holdings, even as sales at 
 its Kmart and flagship lines continued to stumble. First quarter 
 profits surged 20.0% on one-time charges, according to the company 
 on Thursday, but shares continued to fall as investors questioned 
 the retailers health. 

 The giant broadline retailer said 
 earnings jumped to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, versus $180 
 million, or $1.14 a share, from a year ago. 

 But on a continuing operations basis, 
 which excludes one-time items, such as a legal settlement and 
 retirement benefits, the company netted only $1.10 a share far 
 below analysts expectation of $1.22 a share. At $1.10 a share, the 
 company also fell from the year ago periods result of $1.11 a 
 share. Revenue also fell 2.6% to $11.7 
 billion, from $12 billion. 

 Now, investors are wondering whether 
 Lampert, whose hedge fund ESL Investments owns a 40% stake, can keep 
 the Searscash machine chugging. Since Lampert came on board in 
 November 2004, by merging Kmart with Sears, the stock has 
 skyrocketed over 71%. But after drastically cutting operating costs 
 and improving margins, Lampert, America&apos;s 67th richest person, seems 
 to be running out of tricks. 

 In the first quarter, Sears managed 
 to improve operating results at Sears Canada and minimize expenses 
 in U.S. Sears stores. But these gains were largely offset by poor 
 sales at Kmart, where same store sales dropped 4.4%. Same store sales data, which are sales at stores open at 
 least a year, is considered an important yardstick in gauging a 
 retailers health. Same store sales also slipped 3.4% at the 
 companys namesake line, where home appliance sales were notably 
 poor. 

 The company deflected blame on 
 Thursday, by pointing the finger at macro-economic trends.&quot;In part, 
 our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the 
 same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy 
 costs and a slower housing market,&quot;said Sears chief executive 
 officer Aylwin Lewis. 

 &quot;Although one quarter does not 
 justify hitting the panic button, the negative data points in retail 
 are starting to pile up,&quot;Adranne Shapira, a Goldman Sachs analyst, 
 said in a research note this month. 

 Analysts have long speculated that 
 Lampert primarily wants to use Sears to raise capital for outside 
 investments at the expense of the retailers. In the past, Lampert 
 has said he will consider investments beyond retail. To allay 
 shareholders&apos; concerns, Lampert has adamantly reiterated his 
 commitment to developing the beleaguered brand this year. 

 &quot;I want there to be no doubt about 
 one thing: It is certainly our intent to grow Sears Holdings, &apos;&apos; 
 Lampert said in a letter to shareholders in March. &quot;Some commentators have asserted that we want to shrink the 
 company, but that is simply not so.&apos;&apos; 

 Under Lampert&apos;s stewardship, Sears 
 has amassed a sizable cash reserve of $4 billion. He has used some 
 to make hedge-fund-like investments in derivatives called total 
 return swaps. The company reported that in 
 fiscal 2006 it made
$74 million in pretax income on the transactions. 

 It remains to be seen exactly what 
 Lampert has in mind for Sears, but he has some wiggle room before 
 investor confidence snaps. Although&quot;in Eddie we trust,&quot;remains the 
 mantra of the day, this buoyant optimism is increasingly tempered by 
 a growing suspicion that while Lampert knows how to raise profit 
 margins in the short term, he doesn&apos;t know how to sell Kmart and 
 Sears to the consumer.
 

 

 Sears&apos; Q1 Net 
 Income Climbs 20 Percent 
 By Ashley M. Heher - 
 Associated Press
May 31, 2007 

 Retailer Sears Holdings Corp. said 
 Thursday that its first-quarter earnings grew 20 percent on one-time 
 gains while U.S store sales dropped. 

 For the quarter ending May 5, net 
 income was $216 million, or $1.40 per share, compared with $180 
 million, or $1.14 cents per share, a year earlier. 

 Excluding one-time items, including a 
 legal settlement and retirement benefit, the company earned $1.10 
 per share compared with an adjusted figure of $1.11 per share during 
 the first-quarter in 2006. 

 Revenue fell to $11.7 billion, from 
 $12 billion during the year-ago period. 

 On average, analysts surveyed by 
 Thomson Financial forecast a quarterly profit $1.22 per share on 
 revenue of $11.6 billion. Analyst estimates typically exclude 
 one-time items. 

 The Hoffman Estates-based company 
 said its improved operating results at Sears Canada and lower 
 expenses at Sears stores in the U.S. were offset by declines at 
 Kmart. 

 Overall, the company said comparable 
 store sales, a retail industry metric of sales in stores open at 
 least one year, fell 3.9 percent. At Sears&apos; U.S.
stores, same-store sales dropped 3.4 percent while Kmart sales fell 
 4.4 percent. 

 The discount chain saw its revenue 
 fall $239 million, or 5.6 percent, because of lower sales volumes 
 for home goods, health and beauty products and food. 

 &quot;In part, our domestic operating 
 results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being 
 faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower 
 housing market,&quot;Aylwin Lewis, Sears Holdings chief executive 
 officer and president, said in a statement. 

 Sears said it had $3.4 billion in 
 cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter, up from the 
 $3.2 billion last year.
 

 

 Sears Profit Rises 20% on Insurance, Settlement Gains 
 By Lauren Coleman-Lochner 
 and Heather Burke - Bloomberg
May 31, 2007 

 Sears Holdings Corp., the largest 
 U.S. department-store chain, said first-quarter profit rose 20 
 percent, helped by insurance payments and a legal settlement. 

 Net income climbed to $216 million, 
 or $1.40 a share, from $180 million, or $1.14, a year earlier. Sales 
 fell 2.5 percent to $11.7 billion, Sears said today in a statement. 

 A dividend from an investment in 
 Mexico, insurance money from stores damaged by 2005 hurricanes, a 
 legal settlement and other one-time items boosted profit by $44 
 million, or 30 cents a share. Sales at locations open at least a 
 year fell 3.9 percent on less demand for home appliances at Sears 
 and slower sales of health and beauty products at Kmart. 

 &quot; They still 
 have to make a lot of investments in those stores,&apos;&apos; said Steven 
 Baumgarten, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, 
 which doesn&apos;t hold Sears stock. &quot; From a 
 retailing standpoint, Kmart-Sears has not done a good job.&apos;&apos; 

 Excluding the one-time items, the 
 company said it earned $1.10 a share. On that basis, analysts had 
 estimated the company would earn $1.21 a share, the average of seven 
 projections compiled by Bloomberg. 

 Shares of Sears, based in Hoffman 
 Estates, Illinois, fell $4.75 to $178.50 at 8:25 a.m. New York time, 
 before the regular open of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Before today, 
 they had gained 9.1 percent this year. 

 Same-Store Sales 

 Sales at stores open at least a year, 
 considered an important performance gauge because it measures 
 established locations, declined 4.4 percent at Kmart and 3.4 percent 
 at Sears. They have fallen every quarter since the companies 
 combined in March 2005. 

 Chairman Edward Lampert said at the 
 company&apos;s shareholder meeting earlier this month that fixing retail 
 operations was ``a priority.&apos;&apos; Sears may add exclusive brands, he 
 said, a strategy that has helped rivals such as J.C. Penney Co. and Kohl&apos;s Corp. prosper. 

 There&apos;s a ``newfound willingness on 
 Chairman Eddie Lampert&apos;s part to spend money to improve the 
 business,&apos;&apos; Gregory Melich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in 
 Purchase, N.Y., wrote in a May 8 report. The company will need to 
 invest more in stores and operations, Melich wrote. 

 The company lost $13 million, or 8 
 cents, on investments in total-return swaps. 

 Total-return swaps are agreements in 
 which one investor makes payments based on any coupons and capital 
 gains or losses of an asset and the other makes fixed or 
 floating-rate payments. 

 Earlier this month, the company began 
 a new advertising campaign with the slogan, ``Sears, where it 
 begins.&apos;&apos; At Kmart, it introduced Mr. Bluelight, an animated 
 character who will highlight bargains and unique items for sale. Kmart was known for ``Blue Light Special&apos;&apos; sales in the 1970s 
 and &apos;80s. 

 Lampert, 44, joined Sears with Kmart 
 in March 2005 in a $12.3 billion union that created a company with 
 3,800 stores in the U.S. and Canada.
 

 

 Sears&apos; net jumps on 
 one-time gains 
Falling market share, pinched sales mark core results
 By Jennifer 
 Waters, MarketWatch
May 31, 2007 

 CHICAGO (MarketWatch) -- Sears 
 Holdings Corp. posted a 20% jump in first-quarter profit Thursday, 
 thanks to gains not related to its core retail business, as the 
 parent of the Sears Roebuck and Kmart chains struggled with 
 declining sales of home appliances and lower transactions. 

 For the three months ended May 5, 
 Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears Holdings said net income rose to 
 $216 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $180 million, or $1.14 a 
 share, earned in the year-earlier first quarter. 

 The latest quarter&apos;s results were 
 boosted mostly by gains from a legal settlement, a post-retirement 
 benefit and a hurricane-related insurance claim.   Adjusted 
 to exclude items from both reporting periods, Sears Holdings&apos; profit disappointed Wall Street, declining to $1.10 a share 
 compared with $1.11 a share last year. 

 Deutsche Bank analyst Bill Dreher 
 called the results&quot;disappointing&quot;but said they weren&apos;t 
 disconcerting considering that they were reflective of what close 
 competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMTWal-Mart Stores, Inc 
 WMT ) saw in the quarter and account for a very small piece of Sears 
 Holdings&apos; total fiscal-year picture. 

 &quot;There were clearly elements missing 
 in this performance,&quot;Dreher said.&quot;The company has had some hiccups 
 in the past, and this is one of those weak quarters.&quot;Sears 
 Holdings&apos; performance is indicative of weak results for many of the 
 retailers during the first quarter,&quot;he said.&quot;In the context of 
 first quarter&apos;s contribution to Sears Holdings&apos; annual earnings, 
 it&apos;s only about 10%. 

 &quot;The changes that Sears Holdings is 
 making to the long-term fundamentals of the business are good and 
 continue to make progress,&quot;he said. Dreher has a buy rating on the 
 stock with a 12-month price target of $238. 

 In the latest quarter, Sears said the 
 legal settlement raised earnings per share by 12 cents, while a 
 change in post-retirement benefits at Sears Canada added 11 cents a 
 share. The recoveries from insurance claims tied to property damage 
 from hurricanes in 2005 accounted for another 6 cents a share and an 
 investment in Sears Mexico netted 8 cents a share. 

 Sears Holdings also had a gain of a 
 penny a share on sales of assets, though the company did not explain 
 what it sold. Partly offsetting these was 
 a loss of 8 cents a share, linked to the derivatives tool called 
 total return swap investments. And for the first quarter since Sears 
 Roebuck and Kmart were merged, the company did not record a 
 restructuring charge. 

 Sales fell 2.5% to $11.7 billion from 
 $12 billion. Sears has conceded that it has lost market share in 
 sales of big appliances such as its Kenmore washers and dryers due 
 to the weakening in housing, but showed gains in children&apos;s apparel 
 during the latest quarter. 

 Analysts, on average, had been 
 expecting the company to post a profit of $1.22 a share on revenue of $11.5 billion, according to Thomson 
 Financial. Shares of Sears Holdings sank 
 more than 2% in early trading. 

 Competition and 
 &apos;external factors&apos; 

 Same-store sales, the industry&apos;s 
 important measure of receipts rung up at stores open longer than a 
 year, were off 3.9% in the U.S., reflecting a 3.4% drop at the 
 company&apos;s Sears Roebuck stores and a 4.4% decline at its Kmart 
 properties. 

 &quot;We believe these declines reflect 
 both increased competition and the impact of external factors such 
 as rising energy costs, a slower housing market and poor weather 
 conditions during the latter part of the first quarter,&quot;the company 
 said in its earnings release. Sears Holdings does not hold 
 conference calls with analysts as do most of its rivals. 

 Ahead of this year&apos;s annual meeting, 
 Sears Holdings warned that earnings would miss original projections. 
 It forecast then earnings of $1.30 to $1.53 a share, and net income 
 from $200 million to $235 million. 

 Sears Holdings, flush with cash and 
 borrowing capacity, this month launched major marketing campaigns -- 
 the first since the two retail chains were merged under a single 
 owner. 

 The company said it ended the quarter 
 with $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, slightly higher than 
 the $3.2 billion of a year ago but off from $4 billion on Feb. 3. 
 The company said the decline from February is mostly because of 
 increases in inventory as the retailer shifted from the spring to 
 summer selling seasons. 

 At the annual meeting, Sears Chairman 
 Edward Lampert said he was adding $150 million to $200 million of 
 pharmacy products to inventories as he shifted from an outside 
 source to in-store, a move aimed at cutting costs to consumers. 

 Sears Holdings said it spent $113 
 million on capital expenditures and repaid about $47 million in 
 debt. 

 Also of note, the company didn&apos;t 
 repurchase shares during the quarter, leaving it with $604 million 
 in authorization under the existing stock-buyback plan. The company 
 said it did receive about 114,000 shares of common stock as part of 
 bankruptcy-related settlements.

 Sears deals with 
 fallout on cops story 
 By Marc Hanse - Columnist - 
 Des Moines Register
May 31, 2007 

 Please leave. You&apos;re scaring away the 
 criminals. 

 That&apos;s what a manager at the Merle 
 Hay Mall Sears store told the uniformed Des Moines cop this week. 

 Not in those words exactly, but 
 that&apos;s the way it came out. And it wasn&apos;t the first time. 

 About three weeks earlier, another 
 Des Moines police officer was ordered to leave the same store. 

 The police are upset about it. The 
 corporate office is embarrassed and apologetic. 

 With good reason. It&apos;s like telling 
 the fire department to leave because you&apos;re expecting an explosion. 

 What happened at the Merle Hay Sears 
 is a slap in the face to police in general and a public relations 
 blow to a once-great retail giant. 

 It isn&apos;t quite as bad as the incident 
 at Menards in 1995. Des Moines Police Officer Willie Smith was 
 responding to a shoplifting call then. As he was leaving, a store 
 security guard stopped him, told him to open the trunk of his car, 
 and conducted a search. Smith got a lawyer and walked away with a 
 settlement. 

 According to a Register report 
 published Wednesday, the police officers were asked to leave the 
 Sears store because they were making the shoplifters nervous. 

 In most places of business, this is a 
 good thing. You want the shoplifters to be nervous. What thief in 
 his right mind is going to swipe a lawn mower or a bench vise or a 
 car battery with an officer standing in full uniform nearby? 

 About three weeks ago, Sgt. David Coy 
 was working off-duty security at the mall. He was walking through 
 the store when he was told to beat it. 

 Apparently, the store was monitoring 
 suspicious characters, and he was a distraction. 

 Coy thought that was a little 
 strange. One might reasonably conclude that he was preventing thefts 
 as much as interfering. 

 Then on Monday, Officer Richard Glade 
 was told to get lost. He was on duty at the time but on a break. His 
 wife was picking out a dishwasher and she wanted him to check it 
 out. 

 Sears responded quickly. A spokesman 
 out of the home office apologized and called the problem a 
 misunderstanding and a mix-up. 

 Store management was&quot;attempting to 
 address an ongoing issue of excessive socialization between mall 
 security officers and store associates, which had been hampering 
 associates&apos; productivity.&quot; 

 It&apos;s important to address ongoing 
 issues. And it&apos;s good to see Sears has nothing against the police. 

 Most businesses like having the 
 police around. Off-duty officers work the ballpark and the State 
 Fair. You see them at weddings and at malls and grocery stores. 

 They pack more authority than the 
 average security guard. Not only can they arrest people, but they&apos;re 
 also obligated to take action if they see a crime going down. 

 Some make as much as $35 an hour. If 
 the spouse is home with the kids every day, the extra bucks come in 
 handy. 

 I&apos;m told off-duty police were in high 
 demand 20 or 30 years ago when the pay scale was much lower. Shops, 
 grocery stores and restaurants fed them for free to keep them coming 
 back. Police in uniform hopped on the city buses without having to 
 pay for the ride. These are probably ethics violations now. 

 The good news is that Sears is still 
 in business. At one time, the Chicago-based company dominated the 
 retail landscape. Every family had the catalog. Everyone bought the 
 apparel, the appliances, the tools. 

 Not anymore. Stores like Wal-Mart and 
 Home Depot passed Sears by years ago.
Profits were down, merchandising strategies were dumb. The stores 
 were located in all the wrong places. 

 The merger with Kmart two years ago 
 produced the nation&apos;s third-largest retailer, but the old attraction 
 hasn&apos;t returned. 

 By the way, Officer Glade&apos;s wife 
 didn&apos;t buy that dishwasher, but at least nobody walked off with it.
 

 

 Is Wal-Mart Too 
 Cheap for Its Own Good? 
 By Michael Barbaro - New 
 York Times
May 30, 2007 

 Low prices, it turns out, can be bad 
 for business. 

 A confidential report prepared for 
 senior executives at Wal-Mart Stores concludes, in stark terms, that 
 the chains traditional strengths - its 
 reputation for discounts, its all-in-one shopping format and its 
 enormous selection - &quot; work 
 against us &quot; as it tries to move upscale. 

 As a result, the report says, the 
 chain &quot; is not seen as a smart choice &quot; for clothing, home dcor, electronics, prescriptions and groceries, 
 categories the retailer has identified as priorities as it tries to 
 turn around its slipping store sales, a decline likely to be 
 emphasized Friday during Wal-Marts shareholder meeting. 

 &quot; The 
 Wal-Mart brand, &quot; the report says, &quot; was not built to inspire people while 
 they shop, hold their hand while they make a high-risk decision or 
 show them how to pull things together. &quot; 

 The document, prepared in October 
 2006 by the companys former advertising agency and based on 
 interviews with scores of consumers, offers a candid, wide-ranging 
 explanation for why Wal-Mart, the No. 1 seller of everything from 
 laundry detergent to underwear, has stumbled badly when it comes to 
 higher-end merchandise like silk camisoles and shag accent rugs. 

 The report contends, for example, 
 that &quot; our low prices actually suggest low 
 quality &quot; for products like high-definition 
 televisions. And it says that Target, with its designer-inspired 
 clothing and furniture, feels &quot; like the new and improved, &quot; while Wal-Mart 
 often feels like the &quot; old and outdated. &quot; 

 A copy of the 55-page report, written 
 by GSD&amp;M Advertising, was provided to The New York Times by 
 WakeUpWalMart.com, a union-financed group highly critical of the 
 retailer. The group said that a person outside of Wal-Mart gave it 
 the report. 

 GSD&amp;M, which has worked with Wal-Mart 
 since 1974, submitted the report as part of an elaborate campaign to 
 remain Wal-Marts ad agency after the retailer said that it might 
 choose a replacement last year. Ultimately, Wal-Mart chose other 
 firms. 

 Nick Agarwal, a spokesman for 
 Wal-Mart, said that the seven-month-old report was &quot; out of date and, in some areas, it is 
 just plain wrong. &quot; Sales in the chains 
 pharmacy, electronics and grocery departments, for instance, are 
 very strong, he said. GSD&amp;M, a division of the Omnicom Group based 
 in Austin, Tex., declined to comment. 

 Its report is at times prescient. As 
 Wal-Mart &apos; s clothing and home furnishing 
 businesses have struggled, sales at stores open for at least a year 
 fell to the lowest levels in decades over the last 12 months, well 
 below those of Target. The figures are not expected to improve much 
 over the next year, unsettling investors. 

 The GSD&amp;M document offers a rare 
 glimpse of the concerns that are buffeting Wal-Mart &apos; s 
 retailing empire, from its flagging corporate reputation to the 
 near catastrophic economic pressures faced by its working-class 
 consumers. 

 Wal-Mart attracts 138 million 
 shoppers a week, a staggering figure unmatched in American 
 retailing, but the portion of Americans who say the chain is their 
 No. 1 destination for discount shopping has fallen from about 75 
 percent two years ago to 67 percent today, according to the report. 

 No specific explanation for the 
 drop-off is provided, but Wal-Mart &apos; s ad 
 agency suggested a combination of factors, like stiff competition 
 and public relations troubles. Those troubles have included a sex 
 discrimination lawsuit filed on behalf of 1.6 million female current 
 and former employees and firings of top executives, like the former 
 vice chairman Thomas M.
Coughlin, for stealing company funds. 

 Wal-Mart &apos; s 
 rating as a company that consumers trust and respect &quot; steadily declined &quot; over the last two years, the report said, as labor groups and 
 elected leaders criticized its wages, benefits and practices. &quot; While corporate respect may not be a 
 highly rated driver of store choice, it said, &quot; this 
 intangible quality cannot be underestimated. &quot; 

 Wal-Mart has said that its own 
 analysis has found that just 0.04 percent of customers have stopped 
 shopping at Wal-Mart because of its reputation. 

 Chris Kofinis, director of 
 communications at WakeUpWalMart.com, said, &quot; Wal-Mart 
 needs to realize that improving its public image and its business 
 reputation demands they stop ignoring the fact that the American 
 people care about values, not just value. &quot; 

 The report by GSD&amp;M also says several 
 big-box rivals are meeting shoppers &apos; needs 
 better than Wal-Mart. Best Buy, for example, provides &quot; information and knowledge &quot; to help buy electronics, the report says. Kohl &apos; s 
 provides &quot; a wide selection of brand-name 
 apparel &quot; displayed &quot;i n 
 a stylish environment that inspires browsing, &quot; it says. And Bed, Bath&amp;Beyond has &quot; great 
 displays that provide ideas on how to pull looks together, &quot; it adds. 

 The economy is not helping matters, 
 the report says. After living through the &quot; decade 
 of affluence &quot; in the 1990s, Americans may 
 now be entering the &quot; decade of retreat &quot; as real wages remain flat, fuel prices spike and consumer debt 
 reaches all-time highs, it says, adding, &quot; We 
 have a crisis in the making for America &apos; s 
 working and middle classes. &quot; 

 A significant portion of the report 
 portrays Wal-Mart positively. In interviews, shoppers said the chain 
 saves them money, time and stress, which suggests that the 
 retailers low-price heritage is &quot; as 
 relevant today as it ever was. &quot; Asked by 
 GSD&amp;M to describe Wal-Mart as if it were a person, some consumers 
 compared it to a handyman, a grandmother and Uncle Sam. The report 
 also asserts that &quot; for most people and for 
 most shopping occasions, Wal-Mart is the smart choice. &quot; 

 The bulk of the report, however, 
 examines the challenges facing Wal-Mart as it tries to transform 
 itself from a chain focused on basic household items sold at low 
 prices into one known for style. 

 Wal-Mart &apos; s 
 200,000-square-foot stores, brightly lighted, minimally decorated 
 and teeming with signs for price rollbacks, have served the chain 
 well for much of the last 40 years. 

 But now, as Wal-Mart experiments with 
 contemporary clothing, flat-screen televisions and nine-layer 
 lasagna, that format has become a hindrance. To a shopper who wants 
 to purchase a single dress for an evening out or a DVD player to 
 watch a movie, &quot; Wal-Marts one-stop 
 shopping format becomes a time-consuming irrelevant obstacle, &quot; the report says. 

 That environment is conducive to &quot; zero-time &quot; shopping, 
 in which a customer spends just a few seconds thinking about a 
 product, like a new bottle of dishwashing soap. &quot; But 
 people dont buy electronics, home dcor and apparel in zero time, &quot; the report says. 

 &quot; They shop 
 for them, &quot; it continues. &quot; Those are slow-time shopping trips that 
 require, unique, slow-time environments that provide a level of 
 service, a sense of style and an array of ideas that inspires 
 shopping. &quot; 

 Wal-Mart &apos; s 
 advertising agency recommended a series of solutions, though the 
 company has so far not adopted most of them. For electronics, it 
 suggested creating a no-hassle, no-questions-asked returns policy 
 that would make people feel more comfortable buying expensive 
 televisions and stereo systems.
 
 

 

 Sears boots 2 
 policemen over uniforms 
 The Des Moines officers were told that their apparel 
 distracted security.
 By Tom Alex - Staff 
 Writer - Des Moines Register
May 30, 2007 

 Sears corporate officials Tuesday 
 apologized to two police officers who were told to leave the 
 retailer&apos;s store at Merle Hay Mall in Des Moines because their 
 uniforms were a distraction to store security personnel. 

 &quot;I was dumbfounded,&quot;Officer Richard 
 Glade said.&quot;I said, &apos;You&apos;ve got to be kidding me.&apos;&quot; 

 Kimberly Freely, a spokeswoman at the 
 Illinois headquarters of Sears&apos; corporate 
 parent, initially called the incident a&quot;mix-up.&quot;She did not 
 elaborate, but later, in a written statement, she described the 
 episode as a case of mistaken identity. 

 &quot;Our store management was attempting 
 to address an ongoing issue of excessive socialization between mall 
 security officers and store associates, which had been hampering 
 associates&apos; productivity,&quot;Freely&apos;s statement read. &quot;In no way was this an attempt to prevent on- or off-duty 
 officers from shopping at our store. Sears is issuing a formal 
 apology to the Des Moines Police Department through store 
 management, and we look forward to serving all members of the Des 
 Monies community.&quot; 

 The unidentified store manager in Des 
 Moines who booted Glade on Monday could not be reached for comment. 

 Police Sgt. David Coy said he, too, 
 was told to leave the same Sears store about three weeks ago. 

 &quot;I work for Merle Hay Mall security 
 when I&apos;m off duty,&quot;Coy said.&quot;I was walking through the store and 
 they kicked me out. They told me that while I was in the store, I&apos;d 
 probably interfere with thefts they were monitoring. I said, &apos;Well, 
 that&apos;s great.&apos; She said no, it&apos;s not, and that they paid people to 
 monitor that activity.&quot; 

 Coy said the Sears representative 
 told him he was welcome to come back when he was not in uniform.&quot;The mall is paying me, so I&apos;ll go wherever they tell me to go, and 
 I&apos;ll stay out of Sears if that&apos;s what they want,&quot;he said. 

 Glade said his wife, Irene, was at 
 the store to buy a dishwasher. She found one she liked and called 
 her on-duty husband on the telephone to come take a look. Glade 
 asked for permission to take his morning break and went to Sears. 

 &quot;I don&apos;t think I was in the store for 
 three minutes when I was asked to leave,&quot;he said. 

 &quot;The guy was grinning the whole time 
 he was asking me to leave,&quot;he added. &quot;He 
 said I was a deterrent to the store. Then he threw me out.&quot; 

 The Glades decided to buy the 
 dishwasher elsewhere. 

 Some other stores, such as Dahl&apos;s 
 Foods in Des Moines, hire officers part time at some locations and 
 welcome the uniformed presence. 

 &quot;We certainly wouldn&apos;t discourage 
 officers from coming in any time they wanted,&quot;Dahl&apos;s spokesman Mark 
 Brase said.
 

 

 Foolish Forecast: 
 Sears Set to Swing 
 By Rich Duprey - Motley 
 Fool
May 29, 2007 

 Venerable discount retailer Sears 
 Holdings (Nasdaq: SHLD) will report first-quarter 2007 financial 
 results on Thursday, May 31. 

 What analysts say: 

 Buy, sell, 
 or waffle? Of the seven analysts covering Sears, three 
 say buy, three say hold, and one says sell. 

 Revenues . 
 Only two analysts have ventured an estimate on revenue, which they 
 expect to fall 4% to $11.6 billion. 

 Earnings . 
 Profits, however, are expected to jump 11% to $1.22 per share. 

 What management 
 says: 

 If nothing else since K-Mart and 
 Sears came together, CEO Eddie Lampert has created a company worth 
 discussing again. Although he rebuts charges that he&apos;s purposefully 
 shrinking the chain --&quot;No great company would aspire to become 
 smaller, and we certainly do not. Our objective is disciplined 
 growth&quot;-- he has sold off large swaths of real estate in an effort 
 to&quot;right size&quot;its operations. It becomes a matter of whether the 
 business he is molding is one that can really challenge midlevel 
 retailers like J.C.
Penney (NYSE: JCP) and Kohl&apos;s (NYSE: KSS) on one side, and 
 discounters like Target (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) on the 
 other. Can the value-creation proposition he outlined in his last 
 chairman&apos;s letter still be realized with a company that continues to 
 find sales slipping away? 

 What management 
 does: 

 With retailers, it&apos;s often easy to 
 see how sales -- or their absence -- affect the bottom line. With 
 Sears, that&apos;s not always the case, since Lampert, who runs the hedge 
 fund ESL Investments, often operates Sears like a hedge fund, too. 
 Last quarter, a series of one-time items clouded results, including 
 transactions like a total return swap on which the company lost $27 million pre-tax. It also made $50 million on the sale of 
 assets, and the company&apos;s large cash horde -- between $3 billion and 
 $4 billion -- can be used at Lampert&apos;s discretion. With Sears 
 margins, what you see isn&apos;t necessarily what you get. 
 
 Margin 01/06 04/06 07/06 10/06 02/07 Gross 27.7% 28.0% 28.2% 28.3% 28.7% Operating 3.9% 3.9% 4.1% 4.3% 4.6% Net 1.7% 2.0% 2.2% 2.5% 2.8% 
 
 
All data courtesy of Capital IQ, a division of Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s. 
 Data reflects trailing-12-month performance for the quarters ended 
 in the named months. 

 One Fool says: 

 Sears has become a tricky business to 
 evaluate, confounding analysts time and again. Lampert has proven 
 himself to be, if not genius, certainly smart and adept at melding 
 two failing discount chains into one attention-getting story. Some 
 view him as the next Warren Buffett, and to date, his track record 
 has been impressive. Yet for all the value still locked up in Sears, 
 if he&apos;s sincere in his desire to make the retailer a merchandising 
 force again, customer traffic will ultimately be a crucial factor. 
 At least one critic doesn&apos;t think much of Sears&apos; start in this 
 regard, but the results of the ad campaign the company hopes will 
 woo back shoppers will have to wait until next quarter&apos;s report.
 

 

 Wal-Mart Sneezes, 
 China Catches Cold 
 Retailer&apos;s Clothing Slump Leaves Factories Scurrying To Find 
 New Customers
 By Gordon 
 Fairclough - Wall Street Journal
May 29, 2007 

 SHANGHAI -- Several months ago, 
 Chinese clothing executive Shao Zhuliang got bad news from his U.S. 
 agent: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., his biggest customer, wouldn&apos;t be 
 placing any orders for the spring 2008 season. 

 Now, Mr. Shao says, he is scrambling 
 to line up other buyers from Europe, Japan and South Korea to keep 
 production lines running this summer at Boshan Linar Garments Co. in 
 eastern China&apos;s Shandong province. 

 Wal-Mart&quot;said they had inventory 
 piled up over there,&quot;says Mr. Shao, who heads Boshan&apos;s sales 
 department.&quot;It&apos;s always hard to make money from Wal-Mart orders, 
 but without them, we are finished.&quot; 

 A softer U.S. economy, rising 
 gasoline prices and business miscues have left the world&apos;s largest 
 retailer with a growing amount of unsold goods in its stores, 
 including about $2 billion worth of clothes and home-dcor products. With about 10% of Wal-Mart&apos;s revenue coming from apparel, the 
 excess has several analysts trimming profit estimates for this year 
 by as much as five cents a share. 

 And as Wal-Mart struggles to pare 
 down stocks and get sales growth back on track at its 4,000 U.S. 
 stores, some of the company&apos;s suppliers in China are feeling the 
 pinch. 

 &quot;Wal-Mart is no different from any 
 other retailer going through a tough time,&quot;says Marc Compagnon, an 
 executive director at Li&amp;Fung Ltd., one of the world&apos;s largest 
 apparel-sourcing firms, which matches retailers with manufacturers.&quot;Anyone doing business with a retailer having trouble is going to 
 suffer the consequences.&quot; 

 Mr. Compagnon, who is based in Hong 
 Kong, says that about 16% to 19% of the world&apos;s garments are made in 
 China. Production of the remainder is scattered among countries in 
 Asia, Latin America and elsewhere. 

 It is difficult to tell how much of 
 the cutbacks at Boshan and some other Chinese companies that supply 
 Wal-Mart are related to the company&apos;s inventory pile-up and what 
 orders are simply being shifted to firms with lower production costs 
 or different capabilities. Wal-Mart did not respond to requests for 
 comment. 

 Boshan&apos;s challenges are a sign of the 
 risks to China&apos;s companies and its economy if U.S. consumer spending 
 slows sharply. About 20% of all Chinese exports go to the U.S., its 
 biggest overseas market. Wal-Mart imported $18 billion in goods from 
 China in 2004. 

 And Chinese economic growth remains 
 highly dependent on exports by labor-intensive manufacturing 
 industries. But government officials are working to stimulate 
 domestic demand to lessen reliance on sales abroad. 

 China is likely to weather all but 
 the most extreme of slowdowns, many economists say. But the fallout 
 from Wal-Mart&apos;s problems shows how difficulties at one end of the 
 global supply chain ripple through to the other with the potential 
 for significant economic disruptions, at least locally. 

 For Boshan, the warning signs started 
 the end of last year, when Wal-Mart scaled back its order for the 
 fall 2007 season, from 500,000 pieces to about 100,000, Mr. Shao 
 says. 

 Workers at Boshan&apos;s factory in Zibo, 
 a city of four million, are now sewing denim women&apos;s shirts, the 
 last of which will be delivered to Wal-Mart in September. And that&apos;s 
 it. 

 &quot;They used to buy so much we had to 
 devote nearly all of our capacity to them,&quot;says Mr. Shao. Last 
 year, Wal-Mart accounted for 80% of the company&apos;s business.&quot;It will 
 be impossible to find substitutes easily or quickly,&quot;Mr. Shao says. 

 So far, Mr. Shao says, he has 
 received orders from British retailer Tesco PLC and conglomerates 
 from South Korea and Japan. Boshan employs about 500 people in Zibo, 
 roughly 7,000 miles from Wal-Mart&apos;s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. 
 Many, Mr. Shao says, could lose their jobs or see their pay fall if 
 the company can&apos;t win enough other business. 

 Lu Keqin, a seamstress and workshop 
 supervisor, says seamstresses earn an average of $125 a month -- the 
 result of a piece-work rate of about 38 cents for each garment they 
 sew. 

 &quot;People want to work here because 
 it&apos;s a big company. There&apos;s not much work to do at the small 
 factories nearby,&quot;Ms. Lu says. Ms. Lu, whose daughter is due to 
 start university this year, says:&quot;I don&apos;t want my salary to be 
 affected.&quot; 

 Analysts have blamed much of the 
 slowdown in Wal-Mart&apos;s apparel sales on the failure so far of the 
 company&apos;s strategy to design and market more expensive and 
 fashionable clothing. Wal-Mart last year sharply cut the number of 
 U.S. stores carrying its Metro7 clothing 
 line and recently pulled its first designer line, George M.E. by 
 Mark Eisen, from several hundred stores that carried it, according 
 to a person close to the situation. 

 Susan Floyd, a Wal-Mart shopper in 
 Chandler, Ariz., says she noticed earlier this year George M.E. 
 wasn&apos;t selling, and&quot;I just waited until they went on sale.&quot;Recently, she grabbed a George M.E., gold-foil embossed leather 
 jacket originally priced at $70 for $30, and a pair of slacks for 
 just $3. 

 But evidence from Chinese 
 manufacturers suggests the chain&apos;s problems may not be confined to 
 higher-end clothing. One manufacturer of pajama pants, Zhejiang 
 Furun Co., says it was selling about $3 million in clothing a year 
 to Wal-Mart until this year, when orders ceased. 

 Chen Jiayong, a manager at Nanjing 
 Yongxin Fashion Co. in Jiangsu province north of Shanghai, says his 
 company is finishing up the last order in its pipeline for Wal-Mart 
 now -- 70,000 cotton coats that will sell for about $10. 

 That&apos;s less than 25% of last year&apos;s 
 order, and the company stands to lose about $780,000 in revenue this 
 year, Mr. Chen says. 

 Nanjing Yongxin is also feeling 
 pressure from the appreciation of the Chinese currency, the yuan, 
 whose value has risen by 8% since mid-2005.&quot;Not only Wal-Mart but 
 many other customers in Europe and America canceled orders this 
 year,&quot;Mr. Chen says. The lost orders totaled about $2.6 million. 

 Yan Erhao, manager of Weifang Zuo 
 Bang Garment Co. in Shandong province, says his 50-person company 
 lost its Wal-Mart business last year and is still struggling to find 
 other customers. Last summer the retailer canceled its orders for 
 the men&apos;s casual shirts that Weifang had been delivering for years. 

 &quot;The buyer said Wal-Mart had problems 
 selling them,&quot;says Mr. Yan.&quot;They said it was because of the market 
 in the U.S. They said it had nothing to do with us.&quot;In a stroke, 
 Weifang lost 60% of its revenue. 

 Since then, Weifang has tried to 
 build a knitwear business appealing to customers in Japan and South 
 Korea.&quot;We miss Wal-Mart,&quot;Mr. Yan says.&quot;We have to find 
 substitutes,&quot;he says, adding:&quot;I&apos;m still hopeful.&quot;
 

 


 Fired Wal-Mart Executive Roehm Claims 
 Ethics Rules 
 Were Violated 
 By Gary McWilliams 
 and James Covert - Dow Jones Newswiries
May 25, 2007 

 Fired Wal-Mart Stores Inc. marketing 
 executive Julie Roehm took aim at the retailer&apos;s chief executive and 
 other senior executives, claiming they skirted its ethics policy, 
 accepting travel, concert tickets and preferential prices on yachts 
 and jewelry. 

 Ms. Roehm contends that Chief 
 Executive H. Lee Scott Jr. and his family have close ties to 
 financier Irwin Jacobs, whose companies provide services and 
 products to Wal-Mart, according to her filing in U.S. District 
 Court, Detroit. She alleged their ties go&quot;beyond a business 
 relationship&quot;that Wal-Mart&apos;s ethics policies dictate. Mr. Jacobs, 
 reached today, denied any favoritism. 

 The court filing is the latest twist 
 in a war of words between the high-profile advertising executive and 
 the world&apos;s largest retailer. In March, Bentonville, Ark.-based 
 Wal-Mart described what it said were suggestive personal emails and 
 cited unnamed co-workers describing an admission of an affair 
 between Ms. Roehm and a subordinate, former Vice President Sean 
 Womack. 

 Ms. Roehm&apos;s salvo includes a fierce 
 defense of her short tenure and challenged the company&apos;s portrayals 
 of her in its counter-suit. She denied accepting gifts, insisted 
 suppliers were told to bill the company for any meals, and said 
 salacious descriptions of her relationship with Mr. Womack were 
 false. 

 She also cited an excerpt from an 
 affidavit by Mr. Womack&apos;s wife Shelley to dispute the company&apos;s 
 contention that she engaged in an affair. Ms. Womack testified that 
 one email Wal-Mart cited to support its claims of an affair didn&apos;t 
 include Ms. Roehm&apos;s name and Wal-Mart&apos;s general counsel believed it 
 wasn&apos;t incriminating. 

 A spokesman for Bentonville, 
 Ark.-based Wal-Mart declined immediate comment. 

 Ms. Roehm&apos;s casts Wal-Mart as 
 hypocritical for accusing her of violation ethical rules while 
 failing to enforce its policies when it comes to other senior 
 executives. She alleged Wal-Mart looked the other way when senior 
 executives conducted affairs with subordinates, permitted Mr. 
 Scott&apos;s son to work for a Jacobs&apos; company, and allowed executives 
 who owned retail stores to negotiate with subordinates on leases for 
 those properties. 

 &quot;Many Wal-Mart executives do not 
 abide by Wal-Mart&apos;s alleged &apos;firm&apos; policy forbidding conflicts of 
 interest,&quot;she said in a document filed with the court late 
 Thursday. Despite its policies against conflicts of interest and the 
 misuse of company assets,&quot;actions apparently speak louder than 
 words at Wal-Mart,&quot;she said. 

 Ms. Roehm and a male subordinate were 
 fired last December after the company accused them of violating its 
 policies against fraternization and later claimed they had carried 
 on an affair, improperly accepted gifts and sought jobs with 
 suppliers. Since then, she has been an advertising consultant. She 
 sued Wal-Mart, arguing there was no valid reason for her dismissal 
 and asking the court to award her unspecified damages and 
 compensation including lost pay, stock options, severance, and 
 bonus. 

 Turning the tables on Wal-Mart, her 
 filing alleges Mr. Scott personally benefited from his relationship 
 with Mr. Jacobs, the chairman of Genmar Holdings Inc. and owner of 
 several private businesses. Without identifying any specific 
 instances, Ms. Roehm said the CEO obtained&quot;a number of yachts&quot; and&quot;a large pink diamond&quot;at preferential prices due to the 
 relationship. 

 In a telephone interview today, Mr. 
 Jacobs called her allegations&quot;totally outrageous&quot;and without any 
 substance. He said he never provided Mr. Scott with any discounts or 
 travel. 

 He acknowledged a long friendship 
 with the Scott family that includes joint vacations.&quot;They pay their 
 way; we pay our way,&quot;he said.&quot;I&apos;ve frequently told Mr. Scott, it&apos;s 
 very difficult for me to go with him because he always picks up the 
 check I&apos;d like at some point to level up. He won&apos;t allow that to 
 happen.&quot; 

 Mr. Scott&apos;s son Eric had several 
 years ago worked for a boat-manufacturing unit of Genmar and now 
 runs a consulting company that shares office space with a private 
 company that Mr. Jacobs owns, Jacobs Trading. Eric Scott&apos;s 
 consulting business helps manufacturers develop retail merchandise 
 programs, providing advice on everything from package design to 
 product extensions. Wal-Mart&apos;s attorneys 
 reviewed and approved the son&apos;s business dealings with Jacobs 
 Trading, Mr. Jacobs said. 

 In an interview earlier this year, 
 Mr. Jacobs also insisted there never were any discussions between he 
 and Mr. Scott about hiring Eric Scott at Genmar&apos;s Wellcraft unit.&quot;I 
 swear to God Lee never called me about it,&quot;he said in that 
 interview. Mr. Jacobs said he saw an opportunity for&quot;putting Eric 
 to work,&quot;noting his past experience buying merchandise from 
 overseas manufacturers.
 
 

 

 Federated Names 
 New Division Presidents 
 Former Sears president Mark Cosby heads Macy&apos;s East
 Federated News Release
May 23, 2007 

 CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS 
 WIRE)--Federated Department Stores, Inc. today announced new 
 presidents for its New York-based Macys East division and 
 Miami-based Macys Florida division. 

 Mark S. Cosby, Federated &apos; s 
 senior vice president for property development, has been named 
 president and chief operating officer of Macy &apos; s 
 East, effective June 4, 2007. He replaces James E. Gray, who is 
 retiring after a distinguished 46-year career with the company. 
 Cosby will join Ron Klein, chairman and chief executive officer, as 
 the principal team at Macys East. 

 J. David Scheiner, previously vice 
 chairman and director of stores at Macy &apos; s 
 Florida, has been named president and chief operating officer of 
 that division. Along with Julie Greiner, chairman and chief 
 executive officer, Scheiner remains a principal of Macy &apos; s 
 Florida. He replaces Nirmal K. &quot; Trip &quot; Tripathy, former president of Macys Florida, who has left the 
 company to pursue another opportunity. 

 &quot; We 
 are fortunate that we have executives of the caliber of Mark Cosby 
 and David Scheiner to fill these key operating roles, &quot; said Federated Vice Chair Susan D. Kronick, who oversees Federated &apos; s 
 retail divisions, including Macys East and Macys Florida. Both 
 Mark and David are experienced leaders who have a track record of 
 success in managing the operations of complex organizations, as well 
 as a clear understanding of our customer and business priorities. 

 &quot; As 
 Jim Gray retires from Macy &apos; s East, we will 
 miss his broad experience and deep commitment to the company, &quot; Kronick said. &quot; Jim is a truly special 
 individual who has been president of three Federated divisions over 
 the past 22 years. He is a friend and 
 trusted colleague to everyone in our management organization. &quot; 

 Cosby, 48, joined Federated in July 
 2006 as senior vice president for property development, a position 
 in which he oversees a range of corporate-level functions, including 
 store design and construction, energy services, real estate and 
 licensed operations. 

 Previously, Cosby served as president 
 of full-line stores for Sears Roebuck&amp;Co., where his 
 responsibilities included merchandising, store operations and supply 
 chain management. Prior to joining Sears, he was chief operating 
 officer of KFC and chief development officer of Yum Brands, the 
 branded restaurants company spun off from PepsiCo. He began his 
 career as a financial analyst for General Foods Corporation. 

 A native of Madison, WI, Cosby holds 
 bachelor &apos; s and MBA degrees from the 
 University of Wisconsin. He currently lives in Cincinnati with his 
 wife, Kathy, and two children. 

 Scheiner, 57, first joined Burdines 
 (predecessor of Macy &apos; s Florida) in 1972 as 
 assistant buyer of men&apos;s slacks. He advanced to group senior vice 
 president and general merchandise manger, overseeing Burdines &apos; fashion office and womens apparel and center core categories. In 
 1988, Scheiner became president of Maas Brothers/Jordan Marsh until 
 the merger of the Burdines and Mass Brothers/Jordan Marsh in October 
 1991, when he became vice chairman and director of stores for the 
 combined organization. 

 A native of New York, Scheiner 
 graduated from the University of New Haven with a degree in 
 marketing and management. Scheiner and his wife, Joan, live in Coral 
 Gables, FL. 

 Gray, 68, has been president of Macy &apos; s 
 East since December 1994. Previously, he was president of Burdines 
 (now Macy &apos; s Florida) since June 1988. From 
 1985 to 1988, he was president of Los Angeles-based Bullocks (now 
 part of Macy &apos; s West) and was also chief executive officer from 1987 to 1988. 

 Gray joined Federated in 1961 as an

 $740 Mil. Sears Media to MPG
 MPG takes over Sears&apos; media from MindShare and MEC Interaction. 
 By Steve McClellan - 
 AdWeek
May 23, 2007 

 NEW YORK Sears Holdings has selected 
 Havas&apos; MPG to handle media duties after a review, the client has 
 confirmed. 

 The other contenders were: incumbents 
 MindShare and MEC Interaction, both units of WPP Group; Aegis 
 Group&apos;s Carat; and independent Horizon Media, per sources. 

 In early April, Sears confirmed 
 placing media planning and buying duties on its nearly $740 million 
 advertising account in play. The competition covered both the Sears 
 and Kmart retail chains. 

 MPG said the account would be managed 
 out of both its New York and Chicago offices. 

 &quot;As media planning and buying agency 
 of record we believe this arrangement with MPG aligns us with an 
 organization that can help us connect with and profitably service 
 our customers and achieve our goal of being a more efficient and 
 effective company,&quot;said Maureen McGuire, evp, CMO at Sears, in a 
 statement. MPG, she said,&quot;has a proven track record employing media 
 solutions grounded in insghts and facts that will integrate 
 traditional and emerging media strategies seamlessly with the Sears 
 Holdings creative and marketing process.&quot; 

 The client said the scope of work 
 includes media planning and buying for all television, radio, 
 magazines, out-of-home, online and emerging media across all target 
 customer audiences. 

 &quot;This is a milestone day for our 
 company,&quot;and Charlie Rutman, MPG&apos;s North American CEO.&quot;What is 
 most exciting to us is [that the client&apos;s] commitment to using media 
 to grow their business is second to none.&quot; 

 MindShare handled traditional media 
 and MEC Interaction worked on the interactive business. 

 The Hoffman Estates, Ill., company 
 consolidated traditional media chores at MindShare last June. The 
 shop had handled Sears&apos; media for several years, but added $200 
 million from Kmart at that time. 

 In a statement, MindShare said:&quot;Sears has been a valued MindShare client for more than 20 years and 
 we are, of course, disappointed to have lost the business. Sears is 
 an American icon, and our business partnership with the company has 
 always been a productive and rewarding experience for us. All of us 
 at MindShare are grateful to have had the opportunity to work with 
 such an important client. We wish everyone at Sears and Kmart 
 continued good fortune in all of their future endeavors.&quot; 

 One month ago, Kmart shifted its 
 creative to IPG&apos;s DraftFCB in Chicago without a review. WPP&apos;s Young&amp;Rubicam in Chicago handles creative on Sears. Those assignments 
 were not affected by the media review. 

 Sears Holdings was formed in March 
 2005 after Kmart Holding Corp. acquired Sears, Roebuck and Co. for 
 an estimated $12.3 billion. 

 The company spent nearly $740 million 
 on advertising last year, according to Nielsen Monitor-Plus, down 3 
 percent from the previous year. 

 Santa Monica, Calif.-based 
 consultancy Select Resources International managed the media review 
 process.
 

 

 J.C. Penney Raises Outlook 
 By Kevin Kingsbury and Art 
 Daniels - Dow Jones Newswires
May 17, 2007 

 J.C. Penney Co.&apos;s fiscal 
 first-quarter net income rose 13% on higher profit margins and the 
 company raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook. 

 For the quarter ended May 5, the 
 Plano, Texas, department-store chain posted net income of $238 
 million, or $1.04 a share, compared with $210 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. J.C. Penney last month 
 boosted its first-quarter earnings forecast to $1.02 a share from 99 
 cents. 

 The company said last week when it 
 released April sales data that first-quarter sales climbed 3.1% to 
 $4.35 billion, with comparable sales at its department stores rising 
 2.2%. The sales gains were led by women&apos;s apparel and accessories 
 and fine jewelry. Home categories saw continued weakness. 

 Gross margin, or sales minus the cost 
 of goods sold, rose 0.7 percentage point to 41.5%. 

 Chairman and Chief Executive Myron 
 Ullman III cited&quot;early benefits&quot;in inventory-flow changes that 
 helped to reduce clearance levels and the introduction of several 
 new product lines. 

 For the fiscal second quarter, J.C. 
 Penney sees earnings of 77 cents a share, which includes 3 cents in 
 debt-redemption costs, with comparable-store sales up by the low- to 
 mid-single digits on a percentage basis. The mean estimate of 
 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial was for earnings of 79 cents 
 a share. 

 The company also raised its 
 fiscal-year earnings outlook by five cents to $5.49. 

 The retailer in recent years has been 
 successful in attracting middle-market shoppers by introducing more 
 stylish private-label clothing to replace frumpy offerings. 
 High-margin private brands, such as Arizona Jeans, now comprise 
 about 45% of its business and helped to raise the company&apos;s profit 
 margin a full percentage point in 2006. Next year, it will unveil 
 its biggest private-brand launch, a new line of clothing and 
 furnishings called American Living, to be designed by a unit at Polo 
 Ralph Lauren Corp. 

 J.C. Penney has also improved its 
 distribution network to reduce inventory and increase efficiency, 
 and expanded its Internet business. 

 The company said last month that its 
 long-term outlook calls for a 16% compound annual growth rate in 
 per-share earnings for 2008 through 2011, with comparable-store 
 sales increasing by the low- to mid-single digits on a percentage 
 basis. J.C. Penney added it will open 250 stores in the next five 
 years, with most being standalone buildings not connected to 
 shopping malls.
 

 

 Sears: What&apos;s in store next 
 By Sandra Guy - Chicago 
 Sun-Times
May 17, 2007 

 Sears is experimenting with 
 encouraging its appliance-repair teams to make sales pitches, and is 
 featuring its repair technicians at workshops inside Sears stores, 
 as the retailer explores ways to exploit its service and repair 
 network. 

 A service technician who comes to a 
 customer&apos;s house to repair an appliance may offer to go online or 
 call Sears to help the customer buy a new appliance if the customer 
 decides a repair is too costly, said Tina Settecase, vice president 
 and general merchandise manager for home appliances at Sears 
 Holdings Corp. 

 The technician would bring along a 
 booklet of Sears&apos; best-selling appliances to show customers. If the 
 customer chooses a new appliance, the technician would either use 
 the customer&apos;s computer or call a dedicated phone line to make the 
 sale. The test of the process will start in mid- to late June in a 
 few markets. 

 &quot;We are testing a number of options,&quot;Settecase said.&quot;We are in the customers&apos; homes. Is there a way, 
 when the customer determines he or she believes a product is beyond 
 repair, that we can put her in touch with a Sears sales person at 
 that moment?&quot; 

 Sears also has featured a service 
 technician at home appliance&quot;health check&quot;events to answer 
 shoppers&apos; questions about their appliances and how they work. The 
 next one will take place on Aug. 25. 

 Sears is redefining its Kenmore brand 
 to emphasize innovations. The retailer introduced 25 new Kenmore 
 products at the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show in Las Vegas earlier 
 this month. The products include a washer and dryer that use steam 
 to remove stains and wrinkles. 

 Sears counts on its appliances, along 
 with its lucrative extended warranties, for its lead over rivals. 

 In September, Sears will introduce a 
 higher-end Kenmore Elite line of countertop appliances, including a 
 coffeemaker that brews a pot of coffee in less than six minutes, and 
 a toaster that toasts a slice of bread in 70 seconds versus the 
 conventional three minutes.
 

 

 Chief exec sees 
 turnaround in 3 years 
 By Sandra Guy - Chicago 
 Sun-Times
May 17, 2007 

 Billionaire whiz-kid Edward S. 
 Lampert, who engineered Kmart&apos;s $12.3 billion takeover of Sears, 
 Roebuck and Co. two years ago, might have met his Waterloo in the 
 quagmire that is mid-America retailing. 

 But the chairman of Sears Holdings 
 Corp. isn&apos;t giving up. 

 Lampert said he believes Sears will 
 require another three years to turn around. 

 &quot;I&apos;ve been here, it seems like 
 forever,&quot;Lampert, 44, said as he fought a cough and sniffles at 
 Sears&apos; annual shareholders&apos; meeting and during a question-and-answer 
 period with reporters earlier this month at Hoffman Estates 
 headquarters. 

 When asked whether he will stay 
 through a turnaround, he declared,&quot;As long as I think I can be of 
 value and be the right person in this position, I&apos;ll continue to do 
 so.&quot; 

 Investors initially believed Lampert 
 would sell off the company&apos;s most valuable real estate or make a big 
 acquisition. He has done neither, and appears in no hurry to do so. 

 Lampert, head of $15 billion hedge 
 fund ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Conn., continues to invest 
 in undervalued stocks of businesses with strong brands. ESL 
 disclosed this week that affiliate RBS Partners LP has built up a 
 $782.6 million stake in Citigroup, leading to speculation that 
 Lampert will push for changes at the largest U.S. bank, which owns 
 Sears&apos; credit-card business. 

 So how does Lampert turn around a 
 company whose latest sales reports show continued declines? 

 &quot;This is one of the hardest things 
 I&apos;ve ever done,&quot;he said as he offered a glimpse of his goals and 
 philosophies. Lampert earned $1.3 billion last year, the 
 third-highest pay among his peers, according to a survey by Alpha 
 magazine. 

 Lampert, who owns 42.5 percent of 
 Sears&apos; stock said Sears must prove to disaffected shoppers, many of 
 whom have lost faith in getting what they want and enjoying the trip 
 to a Sears store, that they will get a consistent, positive 
 experience. 

 &quot;We need to close the gap in 
 customers&apos; minds about what we stand for as a company,&quot;Lampert 
 said. 

 Blurring the&quot;soft&quot;and&quot;hard&quot;lines 
 by luring appliance shoppers into the clothing aisles is another key 
 goal, as well as training and retaining employees so Sears shoppers 
 understand the breadth of the retailer&apos;s products. 

 Lampert is eager to retain sales 
 people and other staffers who show evidence of being up-and-coming 
 corporate leaders. Sears must prove itself a great place to work, 
 and give young people opportunities to advance, he said. 

 &quot;It&apos;s important to have a pipeline of 
 young people,&quot;he said.&quot;We want to grow our leaders of the future 
 from the time they are in their 20s and 30s. We want to get to a point of having people who are really, 
 really good and really really desired&quot;in the marketplace, Lampert 
 said. 

 WHAT EDWARD S. 
 LAMPERT IS THINKING 

 At the annual meeting earlier this 
 month the 44-year-old chairman offered these insights into his 
 strategy: 
 
 
 He doesn&apos;t see&quot;The Great 
 Indoors&quot;home decor stores as being&quot;the future of Sears,&quot;leaving open the possibility they, too, could be converted to 
 Sears Grand megastores. 
 He spoke of his awareness that 
 Sears is responsible for people&apos;s lives and investments.&quot;I want 
 to make sure we&apos;re doing the right thing,&quot;he said, noting Sears 
 employs 350,000&quot;associates.&quot; 
 The last book he read, The 
 Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Talebas, about unexpected 
 events, and how breakthrough thinking is acknowledged only after 
 it becomes general knowledge. In explaining the need for such 
 improbable thinking, Lampert quoted his idol, billionaire 
 investor Warren Buffett:&quot;It doesn&apos;t count to predict rain. It 
 counts to build the ark.&quot; 
 &quot;We&apos;re going to make mistakes, a 
 lot of mistakes,&quot;Lampert said.&quot;There&apos;s no perfect answer to 
 leveraging the balance sheet. We need to be able to do things 
 proactively and structure ourselves to get through tough times.&quot;He noted that even lifelong retail merchants have failed to turn 
 around certain companies, and added,&quot;Success or failure often 
 is as much about their capabilities as the circumstances they 
 are put in.&quot; 
 He avoided going into detail 
 about acquisitions or future financial maneuvers, but said&quot;we 
 must be vigilant about controlling costs.&quot;Spending money wisely 
 means understanding the customer and targeting the right 
 marketing message to the right customer. 
 Lampert has puzzled analysts by 
 downplaying the importance of Sears&apos; same-store sales -- a key measure of sales growth for retailers. 
 He said same-store sales are not irrelevant, but they are not 
 the&quot;be all and end all&quot;that many retail experts believe.

 Federated Swings t o 1Q Net, But Lowers 
 Sales View 
 By James Covert Dow 
 Jones Newswires
May 16, 2007 

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Federated 
 Department Stores Inc. (FD) swung to a fiscal first-quarter profit from a year-ago loss, but the results 
 missed its forecast and the company 
 lowered its outlook for the current quarter. 

 The Cincinnati-based parent of Macy&apos;s 
 and Bloomingdale&apos;s maintained its full-year earnings view, but said it will rely on strength in the 
 second half, when it plans to introduce 
 new private brands including home-related goods from Martha Stewart. The company gave a cautious near-term 
 outlook, predicting lackluster results for 
 May on the heels of a weaker-than-expected April, and said it plans to step up TV advertising later this month 
 to boost
sagging customer traffic. 

 &quot;While April has given us some 
 concern about the consumer and the economic environment, we remain optimistic that our trends will 
 improve particularly in the back half of 
 the year as we reach the first anniversary of the Macy&apos;s brand conversion,&quot;Chairman and Chief Executive Terry J. 
 Lundgren said in a written statement 
 Wednesday. 

 Federated has been struggling with 
 disappointing results at more than 400 stores it acquired from former rival May Department Stores Co., 
 which it converted to Macy&apos;s in September. 
 Shoppers at some of those stores, which had operated under regional names like Filene&apos;s and Foley&apos;s, have 
 balked as Federated has eliminated coupons 
 and introduced pricier fashions. Many shoppers in Chicago have protested the conversion of the Marshall 
 Field&apos;s chain to Macy&apos;s, viewing it as a 
 step down. 

 Shoppers at former May stores have 
 been&quot;responding positively&quot;to Macy&apos;s private brands and exclusive fashions, Chief Financial Officer Karen 
 Hoguet said on a Wednesday conference 
 call.&quot;However, we do need to communicate more effectively,&quot;she said. In the meantime, the company continues 
 to gather data on former May customers, 
 and is stepping up TV advertising. 

 Federated, which plans to change its 
 corporate name to Macy&apos;s Inc. at a shareholder meeting on Friday, had net income of $36 million, or 8 
 cents a share, for the quarter ended May 
 5, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $52 million, or 9 cents a share. Year-earlier results were 
 weighed down by charges related to the 
 company&apos;s $11.5 billion acquisition of May in 2005. 

 The latest quarter&apos;s results include 
 a 3-cents-a-share loss from discontinued 
 operations and 5 cents a share in merger-integration expenses. 

 The mean estimate of analysts 
 surveyed by Thomson Financial was for earnings of 19 cents a share, while the company had projected a profit 
 of 15 cents to 20 cents a share. 

 Sales dipped 0.1% to $5.92 billion, 
 missing the company&apos;s forecast of $6 billion to $6.1 billion. While demand was strong for dresses, 
 handbags and shoes, weakness persisted in 
 home-related goods. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, increased 0.6%. 

 Federated said it now expects 
 second-quarter earnings excluding merger costs of 35 cents to 45 cents a share on revenue of $6 billion to 
 $6.1 billion. The company&apos;s prior forecast 
 was for earnings of 40 cents to 45 cents a share on revenue of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion. 

 However, the company reiterated its 
 fiscal-year earnings forecast of $2.45 to 
 $2.60 a share. That includes backing its forecast for second-half 
 sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion, and 
 same-store sales during that period increasing 2% to 3.5%. 

 &quot;We feel we will be able to perform 
 well even if the economy ends up softer than what we originally expected,&quot;Hoguet said. 

 Last week, Federated reported a 2.2% 
 decline in April same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, where analysts had expected an increase. The company warned that same-store sales in May 
 could decline as much as 2%. Federated now 
 expects second-quarter same-store sales to be flat or up as much as 2%, versus its earlier forecast for an 
 increase of 1.5% to 2.5%. 

 Federated operates a national chain 
 of some 800 stores under the Macy&apos;s name. 
 Some analysts say competitors J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl&apos;s Corp. (KSS) are stealing more price-conscious customers away from 
 Macy&apos;s.

 Allstate rolls out growth 
 plans 
New CEO seeking &apos;emerging businesses&apos;
 By Becky Yerak - staff 
 reporter - Chicago Tribune
May 16, 2007 

 If it has wheels on it, Thomas Wilson 
 wants to insure it. 

 In his first annual shareholder 
 meeting since replacing Edward Liddy as Allstate Corp.&apos;s chief 
 executive in January, Wilson laid out a growth strategy Tuesday that 
 included everything from boosting Internet sales to revving up 
 motorcycle coverage to becoming a bigger player north of the border. 

 The Northbrook-based company faces 
 the challenge of increasing revenue in its financial business and 
 its auto insurance line, while at the same time consciously moving 
 over the shorter term to shrink its profit-eating homeowner&apos;s 
 exposure in markets prone to natural disasters. 

 Last week, for example, Allstate, 
 which already has reduced exposure in such states as Florida and New 
 York, announced it would stop selling new homeowner&apos;s policies in 
 California to cut potential losses from earthquakes and wildfires. 

 &quot;At the beginning of this year, we 
 reorganized what we call &apos;emerging businesses,&apos; which are motor 
 clubs, boats, motorcycles, commercial business,&quot;Wilson told 
 reporters after the meeting. 

 Allstate&apos;s market share in those 
 business lines is smaller than its market share in automotive 
 insurance, so the company said there&apos;s plenty of room to grow. 

 &quot;We like to say, &apos;If it has wheels, 
 we ought to be able to write it,&apos; so we ought to be able to have as 
 large a share in motorcycles as we do cars,&quot; Wilson said. 

 Such emerging businesses should start 
 gaining traction at Allstate in 2008 or 2009, he said. 

 &quot;We&apos;ll continue to find ways to 
 create new products for specific groups of people,&quot;Wilson said. 

 Allstate continues to be committed to 
 expanding its financial arm, believing that if a consumer buys home 
 and auto insurance as well as life insurance and an annuity from 
 Allstate, they&apos;re customers for the long haul. 

 Wilson noted that&quot;Your Choice Auto,&quot;which offers options for motorists depending on whether they care 
 about cheap or comprehensive coverage, has been a hit, and plans are 
 in the works for Allstate&apos;s financial business to create a similar 
 retirement product. Allstate already offers a similar homeowner&apos;s 
 line in certain markets. 

 &quot;I don&apos;t know what that is yet,&quot;Wilson said of the Your Choice retirement product.&quot;We&apos;ve got people 
 working on it, but it seems there is some opportunity there to 
 create something that&apos;s easy for consumers to understand and they&apos;re 
 not forced to deal with the complexity of &apos;How much money do I put 
 in life insurance? How much in annuities?&apos;&quot; 

 Allstate Financial is expected to 
 launch some new products at the beginning of 2008. 

 Wilson said Allstate doesn&apos;t plan to 
 exit the homeowner&apos;s business despite pulling back in some markets, 
 fearful that warmer oceans will eventually result in stronger 
 hurricanes. 

 To be sure, Allstate&apos;s homeowner&apos;s 
 business will shrink over the next couple of years, but&quot;once it 
 gets the right geographic mix, things like Your Choice Homeowners 
 will help us grow,&quot;Wilson said. 

 The auto business should start to 
 grow&quot;a little faster this year and next year&quot;because of a new 
 product, called Allstate Blue, for higher-risk drivers. 

 Wilson also said that Allstate is 
 redoing its online presence. 

 &quot;We have a good information Web site, 
 but it&apos;s not as quick to close the sale,&quot;he said. 

 Asked whether he was eyeing any 
 potential acquisitions, Wilson said&quot;not really,&quot;but noted that 
 he&apos;d like to step up growth of its unit in Canada, where Allstate&apos;s 
 market share is small.
 


 

 Lampert buys into 
 Citigroup, Motorola 
 Stake in bank worth 
 about $800 million
 By Sandra Jones - staff 
 reporter - Chicago Tribune
May 16, 2007 

 Edward Lampert, the billionaire hedge 
 fund manager known for making large bets on a few companies, 
 including Hoffman Estates-based Sears Holdings Corp., has turned his 
 attention to Citigroup Inc., the nation&apos;s largest bank. 

 ESL Investments Inc., his 
 Connecticut-based hedge fund, acquired 15.2 million shares worth 
 $783 million as of March 31, according to a filing Tuesday with the 
 Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 The hedge fund also held 925,000 
 shares of Motorola Inc. worth $16.3 million and 881,000 shares of 
 Clear Channel Communications Inc. worth $30.1 million, both as of 
 March 31. 

 ESL has been building its stake in 
 Citigroup for at least a year but delayed disclosing the position 
 until Tuesday. 

 Lampert, a closely watched investor, 
 received special permission from the SEC to postpone disclosing the 
 details of some of his holdings. That&quot;confidential treatment&quot;expired May 15. 

 As with most hedge funds, ESL&apos;s 
 investments are difficult to track. The SEC filings list some of 
 Lampert&apos;s largest stock holdings, but they do not reveal if any of 
 those stock investments are hedged with other financial instruments. 

 &quot;It&apos;s intentionally hard to read the 
 real economic exposures from that type of filing,&quot;said Jerome A. 
 Castellini, president of CastleArk Management LLC Investment 
 Counsel, a Chicago-based investment firm.&quot;You can&apos;t make a distinct 
 conclusion. But he&apos;s been known for sniffing out these 
 restructurings, and Citigroup clearly is in the middle of theirs.&quot; 

 In April Citigroup announced a 
 massive restructuring that includes eliminating 17,000 jobs, 
 consolidating some corporate operations and shifting 9,500 posts to 
 lower-cost locations. 

 At Motorola Inc., billionaire 
 financier Carl Icahn has been agitating for a restructuring. He lost 
 his bid for a board seat at the Schaumburg-based cell phone-maker 
 earlier this month. San Antonio-based media giant Clear Channel is 
 in the midst of a private-equity buyout. 

 Investors have been expecting Lampert 
 to make an acquisition for the past two years. At one point or 
 another, Home Depot Inc., Gap Inc., Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Safeway 
 Inc. have been the subject of takeover speculation. None of those 
 companies&apos; shares show up in the SEC documents filed Tuesday. 

 Lampert, 44, ranked as the nation&apos;s 
 third-highest-paid hedge-fund manager, pocketing $1.3 billion last 
 year, according to Alpha Magazine&apos;s annual ranking released in 
 April. His fund holds a 43 percent stake in Sears Holdings Corp., 
 the Hoffman Estates-based company he created by combining Kmart and 
 Sears and where he serves as chairman. 

 Lampert also holds large stakes in 
 AutoZone Inc. and AutoNation Inc. 

 ESL spokesman Steve Lipin said 
 Lampert doesn&apos;t comment on his investments.
 

 

 Lampert sees the light 
 By Lewis Lazare 
 - Columnist - Chicago Sun-Times
May 15, 2007 

 When hedge fund guru Eddie 
 Lampert joined Sears and Kmart at the hip, and created a mega 
 retailing behemoth known as Sears Holdings Corp., Kmart was 
 viewed by many as the poorer stepsister. And with all the 
 attention focused for the past couple of years on what Lampert 
 would do to turn around Sears, Kmart has sort of muddled along 
 out of the spotlight. 

 Well, fresh on the heels of the 
 debut last week of what was billed as a&quot;new chapter&quot;in 
 marketing at Sears comes a similar effort at Kmart, though the 
 campaign debuts, perhaps tellingly, with no defining tag line. 
 If nothing else, Lampert seems to want to send out the message 
 he hasn&apos;t forgotten the role marketing must play in determining 
 the fates of the two retailing chains now under his control. 

 The new Kmart campaign from Grey 
 Worldwide/New York (which turns over the account and the new 
 creative concept to Draft FCB/Chicago later this summer) brings 
 back an image hugely familiar to longtime Kmart shoppers: The 
 blue light. But beware jumping to conclusions. A Kmart 
 spokeswoman said there is no plan to bring back the Kmart&quot;blue 
 light special,&quot;as it was known as long ago as 1965. 

 Now, however, there will be&quot;Bluelight 
 Finds&quot;to draw attention to limited-time-only merchandise and&quot;Best of Blue&quot;for goods unique to Kmart. 

 The new ad campaign centerpiece 
 is a walking, talking icon, Mr. Bluelight, who is positioned as 
 an expert on all things Kmart. In the debut commercial, Mr. 
 Bluelight is the host of a standard-issue runway fashion show 
 featuring Kmart&apos;s latest summer looks for women. Some effort has 
 been made to give the character a few mildly funny lines -- but 
 nothing too edgy. And certainly not memorable. 

 As was the case with Sears and 
 its&quot;book&quot;in the ad campaign unveiled last week, K- mart looks 
 to be reaching into its past to find a hook on which to hang its 
 forward-thinking advertising campaign. But it&apos;s safe to say Mr. Bluelight has a long way to go to endear himself to the 
 shopping public. 

 Whether Mr. Bluelight manages to 
 make a lasting mark -- to say nothing of the advertising itself 
 -- will largely depend on how well his character is established 
 over time and on how effectively he is incorporated in future 
 commercials that will play up the discount chain&apos;s range of 
 merchandise.

 Allstate CEO says company aims to grow in financial planning 
 By Lavonne 
 Kuykendall - Market Watch
May 15, 2007 

 CHICAGO (MarketWatch) -- Days after 
 Allstate Corp. (ALLThe Allstate Corporation ALL ) said it will stop 
 writing new homeowners insurance policies in California, President 
 and Chief Executive Thomas Wilson said his vision for the company 
 will see it continue to&quot;shrink&quot;in catastrophe-exposed areas. 

 Eventually, new products the company 
 is developing will help it make up the growth and attract new 
 customers for homeowners and other insurance products, he told 
 reporters following Allstate&apos;s annual shareholders meeting. 

 The goal is to&quot;reinvent protection 
 and retirement&quot;as a broader concept for new company products, he 
 said, to counter an insurance industry that&quot;sells products instead 
 of solutions.&quot; 

 Allstate, the second largest insurer 
 behind State Farm, launched its `Your Choice&apos; auto insurance widely 
 last year, and will use the same concept for its other products. 
 Your Choice products let customers choose various benefits for their 
 policies. The company has recently begun offering a homeowners 
 version in a few areas. 

 The company will expand further on 
 the Your Choice theme, enlarging it to retirement planning as well, 
 as the company works to broaden its image beyond insurance, said 
 Wilson, who took over as CEO Jan. 1, replacing Edward Liddy, who 
 remains Allstate&apos;s chairman. 

 While it pulls back from the coasts, 
 Allstate will seek to expand in Canada and possibly in Mexico, where 
 it currently does little business. Allstate is also making a big push into what Wilson called emerging 
 business, such as insuring boats, motor homes and motorcycles. 

 Wilson said the company&apos;s market 
 share for insuring those vehicles was far smaller than its auto 
 insurance market share.&quot;If it has wheels, we ought to insure it,&quot;Wilson said. Allstate Blue, or auto insurance for the supbrime 
 market, will also expand, Wilson said.
Rival auto insurer Progressive Corp. (PGRThe Progressive Corporation 
 PGR ) , the third largest auto insurer by market share, has seen its 
 special lines policies, which include such vehicles, grow rapidly 
 over the last several quarters. 

 Allstate carries a large market share 
 in several regions that are catastrophe-prone, and the market does 
 not allow it to charge rates sufficient to cover potential losses, 
 Wilson said. 

 He said that in states where it will 
 no longer offer homeowners, such as California, the company will 
 work to win customers for its other products. 

 From a public relations standpoint, 
 its limited offerings in those markets&quot;is certainly not an 
 advantage&quot;Wilson said.&quot;But it is an issue we can work around.&quot;   Shares of Allstate traded down 18 
 cents recently to $62.68.

 Sears ads just don&apos;t get &apos;it&apos; 
 By Lewis 
 Lazare - Chicago Sun-Times Columnist
May 9, 2007 

 For us the tag line almost always 
 says it all. Of course, some so-called experts in the advertising 
 industry will argue the familiar advertising tag is but another 
 outdated fixture in a rapidly evolving ad industry where&quot;hip&quot;is 
 always happening in some cutesy online video or in television 
 product placements, and all manner of unexpected guerrilla marketing 
 tactics. 

 It&apos;s not hard to understand why so 
 many creatives are eager to dispense with tags. 

 Doing away with tag lines 
 conveniently relieves companies and their agencies of the need to 
 come up with a concise, telling indicator of what brand positioning 
 is. Sears, Roebuck and Co., the retailing behemoth that hedge fund 
 guru Eddie Lampert insists he really wants to turn around, had been 
 without a tag line in its advertising for a while -- as Lampert and 
 his marketing execs huddled and tried to decide on a direction for 
 the company. 

 Next Sunday the retailer launches a 
 new brand campaign from Young&amp;Rubicam/Chicago that is all about 
 Sears&apos; new positioning -- what is being heralded as a&quot;new chapter&quot;for the company. 

 It&apos;s obvious to us Lampert and 
 company still haven&apos;t a clue where Sears is headed. Why do we say 
 this? Because the campaign&apos;s new tag line --&quot;Sears: Where It Begins&quot;-- is so hopelessly weak and non-specific. 
 It&apos;s a collection of words that say absolutely nothing, primarily 
 because the&quot;it&quot; meaninglessly hangs 
 there, leaving us feeling frustrated as we wonder what&quot;it&quot;all 
 means. 

 So we weren&apos;t at all surprised to 
 find the television commercials to which that flimsy tag line is 
 attached are also disappointing and hard to fathom. The launch 60-second commercial,&quot;Chapters,&quot;tries to convey 
 the feeling of thumbing through a Sears catalog while simultaneously 
 suggesting through the magic of digital manipulation how items from 
 the catalog can transform a home. 

 Sadly, the overall impression&quot;Chapters&quot;makes is about as thrilling and memorable as randomly 
 flipping through a catalog. Nothing stands out. Nothing sticks in the mind. Nothing about the spot makes you 
 care one whit for Sears or what the company appears to have on offer 
 in its book. 

 The debut spot has been dressed up 
 just a bit with some bland modern music that ambles along just like 
 the spot itself. Like so much modern music, the song doesn&apos;t command 
 attention. It just creates background noise. 

 So to bottom line it, Lampert and his 
 crew look to be trying to go forward by harkening back to the days 
 when Sears was as much about its catalog as it was about 
 brick-and-mortar stores. Odd, isn&apos;t it, how the forward-thinking 
 hipsters who populate the ad industry nowadays seem to be spending 
 so much of their time looking to the past?
 

 

 Sears Uses Image Of Its Historic Catalog In New Ad Campaign 
 Dow Jones 
 Newswires
May 7, 2007 

 NEW YORK (AP)--Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
 is hoping a new marketing approach that focuses on making an 
 emotional connection with shoppers will help turn around its 
 beleaguered business. 

 The campaign, whose details were 
 announced Monday, has the tag line:&quot;Sears.
Where it begins&quot;and evokes the company&apos;s heritage by using the 
 visual image of a catalog in its television ads, circulars, and 
 in-store signage and on the Sears.com Web site. 

 The TV ad campaign was launched 
 Sunday, while the Web site will bear the new message next Sunday. 
 The company&apos;s circulars won&apos;t be revamped until the winter holiday 
 season, though the circular&apos;s front page now has the feel of a 
 shopping book and is less cluttered, according to Gail Lavielle, a 
 company spokeswoman. 

 The company, a unit of Sears Holdings 
 Corp. (SHLD), decided to use the image of a catalog to recall Sears&apos; 
 heritage while creating a more story-like presentation, according to 
 Maureen McGuire, chief marketing officer of Sears Holdings Corp., 
 which operates Sears, Roebuck and Co. as a wholly owned subsidiary. 

 McGuire told reporters that retailers 
 have to not&quot;only think like merchants but also think like 
 customers.&quot;By focusing less on items and more on telling stories, 
 surrounding such themes as laundry time and family night, Sears is 
 hoping to get customers excited about buying that dryer or 
 flat-screen TV at its stores. 

 Sears is joining a number of 
 retailers like J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) that are focusing less on 
 pushing items and prices in ad campaigns and more on touting 
 experiences. But the stakes are higher for Sears, as it faces 
 mounting pressure from investors to turn around its declining sales 
 amid fierce competition. 

 Last week, Sears Holdings announced 
 that in its first quarter ended May 5, same-store sales were down at 
 both Kmart and Sears stores due to low volumes and impacts from the 
 slow U.S. housing market. Same-store sales are those at stores 
 opened at least a year and are considered the best gauge of a 
 consumer 

 Sears domestic same-store sales fell 
 2.4%, primarily due to low home appliances sales. The company 
 attributes a loss in this category to a slower U.S. housing market 
 and increased competition. 

 Kmart same-store sales decreased by 
 4.7%, due to low transaction volumes in a majority of stores, 
 according to the company. 

 Meanwhile the Kmart brand is getting 
 a new mascot: a talking light bulb called&quot;Mr. Blue Light.&quot; 

 McGuire acknowledged that it is going 
 to take a lot more than an ad campaign to bring back Sears; it 
 requires improved merchandising assortment and customer experiences. 
 But she said that Sears&apos; advantage is that it already has had a 
 long-lasting relationship with its customers. Sears just has to 
 reignite it, McGuire said.

 Sears shares 
 fall as meeting lacked details 
 By Mike Comerford - 
 Business Writer - Daily Herald - Suburban Chicago
May 5, 2007 

 Since orchestrating Kmarts takeover 
 of Sears two years ago, billionaire investor and Sears Holdings 
 Corp. Chairman Edward Lampert keeps specifics about his turnaround 
 formula as well-guarded as the secret recipe for Coke. 

 The 44-year-old Lampert spent two 
 hours Friday answering shareholder and analyst questions at Sears 
 annual shareholders meeting on its sprawling Hoffman Estates 
 headquarters campus. 

 However, detailed answers to 
 traditional questions on profitability, same-store sales, fall brand 
 strategies and $2 billion in cash reserves each remained elusive. 

 &quot; What 
 will shake out, especially this year, really is going to depend on 
 what the opportunity set is, &quot; said Lampert, 
 not ruling out acquisitions. 

 Sears was rumored last year to be a 
 potential bidder for everything from Home Depot Inc. to 
 Anheuser-Busch Cos., but no large investment surfaced.

 downtown Chicago store Friday as shareholders gathered for the 
 retailer&apos;s annual meeting in Hoffman Estates headquarters.

Asked if he anticipates layoffs at the Sears headquarters, Lampert 
 emphasized the need for top, young people at Sears in order to grow 
 in the new economy. 

 &quot; We 
 need a pipeline of new people coming in all the time &quot;, Lampert said, adding Sears carries a heavier pension load than 
 competitors and a seniority-based payroll. 

 Wall Street may have been expecting 
 more specifics. 

 The company forecast first-quarter 
 earnings below analysts estimates and said Thursday that sales at 
 older stores declined at both its Kmart and Sears stores. 

 Lampert said an unusually cold winter 
 and a slowdown in the housing market have been tough even on Sears 
 retail competitors. 

 Nonetheless, Sears shares on Friday 
 fell $8.56, or 4.6 percent, to $179.76, the most in more than five 
 months. 

 The company did, however, disclose 
 plans for its first big marketing campaign of Lamperts tenure, to 
 be rolled out Sunday. 

 The Kmart brand is getting a new 
 mascot - a talking light bulb called &quot; Mr. Blue Light &quot; . 
 The Sears brand will be promoted in commercials and ads under the 
 tag line: &quot; Sears: Where it begins. &quot; 

 Lampert joined Sears with Kmart in 
 March 2005 in a $12.3 billion combination that created a company 
 with 3,800 stores in the U.S. and Canada. 

 Sears profitability and stock price 
 have since risen but store sales have not met its own targets, Sears 
 officials said. 

 Some analysts said they are waiting 
 for a clearer picture of the firm or for same-store sales to rise. 

 &quot; Sears has 
 been donating market share, and J.C. Penney and Kohls have been the 
 beneficiaries &quot; , said Arun Daniel, a New 
 York-based analyst with ING Investments LLC, which manages $40 
 billion in assets including Sears shares.
 

 

 Sears to light up ad plan 
 By Sandra Guy - Chicago 
 Sun-Times
May 5, 2007 

 Sears is harkening back to its roots 
 as a catalog retailer by using the metaphor of a&quot;Sears Book&quot;in a 
 new ad campaign and starting specialty catalogs. 

 And Kmart, which took over Sears 
 Roebuck two years ago, is introducing&quot;Mr. Blue Light,&quot;a talking light bulb, in its own marketing campaign, 
 referencing the old Kmart sales gimmick, the&quot;Blue Light Special.&quot; 

 Sears also intends to use its 
 home-services unit to deliver more than washers and dryers, 
 including possibly furniture and other goods. 

 The strategies, unveiled at Sears 
 Holdings Corp.&apos;s shareholders&apos; meeting Friday, are among several 
 initiatives that company executives hope will win back shoppers 
 who&apos;ve defected to J.C. Penney, Kohl&apos;s, Wal-Mart and other rivals. 
 Sales at Sears and Kmart stores declined in the first quarter of 
 fiscal 2007 from a year earlier, Sears announced late Thursday. That 
 news sent shares down 4.6 percent, to $179.75, Friday. 

 Sears Chairman Edward S. Lampert, a 
 44-year-old billionaire hedge-fund manager, said turning around 
 Sears may take another three years. The process has been one of the 
 most difficult things he has done, Lampert said. 

 &quot;I&apos;ve been here, it seems like 
 forever,&quot;said Lampert, fighting a cough and sniffles, when asked 
 whether he will stay through a turnaround. 

 &quot;As long as I think I can be of value 
 and be the right person in this position, I&apos;ll continue to do so,&quot;Lampert said. 

 He said he has devoted more than half 
 his time to Sears Holdings Corp., following his engineering of 
 Kmart&apos;s $12.3 billion Sears takeover in March 2005. Lampert is 
 exiting as a director of Auto Nation and AutoZone to devote more 
 time to Sears and his hedge fund. 

 He and Aylwin Lewis, CEO of Sears 
 Holdings, revealed other initiatives: 

 Lampert said he&apos;s interested in 
 making acquisitions, whether it&apos;s buying a whole company or a piece 
 of one. 

 Sears intends to use well-known 
 fashion names to boost its apparel brands. 

 Shops of Lands&apos; End will expand to 
 200 Sears stores by year&apos;s end, from 100 today. 

 Craftsman tools will be in Kmart 
 stores nationwide. 

 Kmart stores doing poorly are likely 
 future sites for Sears Grand stores.
 

 

 Sears chief no longer hedges on strategy 
 Lampert details plan to 
 build brands; 
 new ad campaigns launch 
 By Sandra Jones - staff reporter - 
 Chicago Tribune
May 5, 2007 

 Since billionaire investor Edward 
 Lampert combined Sears and Kmart two years ago, the biggest question 
 on investors&apos; minds has been the most basic: Is he running a 
 retailer or a hedge fund? 

 On Friday, at the annual meeting of 
 Hoffman Estates-based Sears Holdings Corp., Lampert addressed the 
 question. He said he&apos;s serious about being a retailer and for the 
 first time outlined a marketing vision for his two store brands, a 
 basic step forward for any chain trying to remake itself. 

 &quot;A company without positioning is 
 like a ship without a rudder,&quot;Lampert said.&quot;We have aspirations 
 for both the Kmart and Sears brands to see them improve.&quot; 

 Lampert is a former Goldman Sachs 
 star who made his billions in financial instruments, not housewares. 
 And since his arrival at Sears nearly all of investors&apos; focus has 
 been on what he would do with Sears&apos; cash and real estate assets. A 
 main reason for the company&apos;s high stock price has been Lampert&apos;s 
 investment acumen rather than his merchandising skill. 

 Lampert has insisted from the 
 beginning that he wants to make Sears a viable retailer and not 
 strip its assets for cash. But until Friday he provided no specific 
 vision for the company. 

 Sears is aiming to be a one-stop shop 
 for the home, while Kmart is turning its discount stores into a&quot;marketplace of discoveries,&quot;Lampert&apos;s chief marketing officer, 
 Maureen McGuire, said as Lampert looked on. 

 Sears unveiled a new TV advertising 
 campaign called&quot;Sears. Where it Begins.&quot;that taps into the store&apos;s 
 legendary Big Book catalog heritage. In it, actors walk among the 
 pages of Sears catalogs, looking at larger-than-life images of 
 everything from diamond rings to dishwashers, set to sunny, upbeat 
 music. 

 Kmart&apos;s new ad campaign likewise 
 delves into its past. The discount chain has resurrected its&quot;blue 
 light special,&quot;turning the famous tagline into a talking blue light 
 bulb called&quot;Mr. Blue Light.&quot;The bulb advises shoppers to&quot;turn on&quot;to something new. 

 The campaigns, which debut for 
 Mother&apos;s Day, come after Lampert has spent two years cutting 
 advertising expenses. Before his arrival, Sears ranked among the 
 biggest advertising spenders in the nation. 

 &quot;We spent the last couple of years in 
 the weeds,&quot;he said, apparently addressing questions of why he 
 hasn&apos;t moved more quickly.&quot;You don&apos;t fix companies from the 
 treetops. You have to get in the weeds, identify their strengths and 
 weaknesses and aggressively recruit people to improve the company.&quot; 

 He acknowledged many times that Sears 
 and Kmart have a lot of catching up to do. 

 &quot;None of our stores are up to our 
 aspirations,&quot;Lampert said.&quot;We have very high aspirations.&quot; 

 The meeting turned into a forum for 
 investors to pepper Lampert with questions, a once-a-year 
 opportunity. Lampert shut down the investor relations department, 
 preferring instead to communicate through his annual shareholder 
 letter and annual meeting. 

 Lampert dodged questions about 
 financial maneuvers and what he has planned for Sears&apos; $3.3 billion 
 in cash, repeatedly turning back to retail. 

 At one point in the meeting, Lampert 
 said that while he doesn&apos;t have much experience in the business, he 
 knows someone who does, and he pointed to his mother, a former sales 
 clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue, seated in the audience. 

 Other news to come out of the meeting 
 and the press conference that followed: 

 -Sears plans to double the number of 
 Lands&apos; End stores within Sears this year to 200. Lands&apos; End made the 
 biggest profit in its history in 2006, the company said. 

 -Sears Grand, formerly Sears 
 Essentials, is still being tweaked. The free-standing stores, many 
 of them former Kmarts, carry both Sears and Kmart merchandise and 
 are designed to compete with Target and Wal-Mart. Lampert cut back 
 on the rollout of Sears Grand, once considered Sears&apos; primary growth 
 vehicle, but he hasn&apos;t given up on the format. 

 -Sears is considering jumping on the 
 designer brand bandwagon. Kohl&apos;s Corp., J.C. Penney Co., Macy&apos;s and 
 others have signed deals with designers in the past year to make 
 clothing and home goods exclusively for them. 

 -An acquisition is always a 
 possibility.&quot;We&apos;re looking for investment opportunities,&quot;Lampert 
 said at the press conference.&quot;We&apos;re always in that mode. It&apos;s not 
 easy to find the right thing and get a deal done.&quot;
 

 

 Sears&apos; Lampert 
 ready to put money to work 
 By Jennifer Waters, 
 MarketWatch
May 4, 2007 

 HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (MarketWatch) 
 -- Sears Holdings Corp. Chairman Edward Lampert told shareholders 
 Friday that after spending a lot of years&quot;in the weeds,&quot;the parent 
 of Sears Roebuck and Kmart stores is now in a cash-flush position to 
 put more meaningful investments in stores and operations, as well as 
 to target acquisitions. 

 With $3.6 billion in cash flow, a $2 
 billion cash trove and a huge capacity to borrow, Lampert said that 
 he is comfortable taking risks and deploying money to investments 
 that will pay off in a meaningful way. 

 In fact, he called himself a&quot;professional risk taker.&quot;However, he gave no indication that there 
 were any acquisitions in the offing. 

 &quot;The opportunities for us to allocate 
 capital are very significant, and we have a lot of choices,&quot;he 
 added.&quot;But we don&apos;t go into this with a predetermined mind-set.&quot; 

 Last year, Lampert&apos;s name popped up 
 as a potential takeover suitor for Home Depot Inc. (HDHome Depot, 
 Inc GPS ) , as well as other businesses, as Wall Street tried to 
 guess what he would do with so much money. 

 &quot;We are always looking for investment 
 opportunities,&quot;Lampert commented. &quot;We&apos;re 
 always in that mode, but it&apos;s not always easy to find the right 
 thing and actually execute and get that deal done.&quot; 

 The executive, who fielded 
 shareholder questions for more than three hours, said that the 
 company has identified and prioritized a number of initiatives, 
 ranging from marketing and technology to maintaining parking lots, 
 but is willing to shift gears if economics or better deals come 
 along. 

 Like its rivals, Sears Holdings has 
 been polling customers and consumer surveys to determine who its 
 customers are, what they&apos;re looking for and how Sears and Kmart 
 stores can differentiate their store experience. 

 Kmart stores will hark back to their 
 heritage, bringing back the venerable blue-light icon with a Mr. 
 Blue Light character in advertising and in-store promotions. 

 More Kmart stores also will be 
 carrying the Craftsman tools by the end of the year, and the 
 retailer will continue to expand its store-within-a-store program. 

 Branding at Sears outlets will be 
 farther reaching, as the retailer attempts to get more customers to 
 cross the aisles. Lampert said that he wants to be sure that 
 customers who buy Kenmore appliances also look at Lands&apos; End 
 clothing and use Sears Auto shops. Services such as the company&apos;s 
 in-home installation and repair or home-cleaning businesses will 
 take on a greater role in the company&apos;s growth strategy. 

 In a commercial shown to the more 
 than 100 shareholders at the meeting, Sears stores were depicted as 
 a one-stop shop for every want and need of a growing family. Every 
 item shown, ranging from lawn mowers and wide-screen TVs to baby 
 clothes, was available at a Sears store. 

 &quot;That commercial was brilliant,&quot;said 
 Deutsche Bank analyst Bill Dreher after the meeting.&quot;It was a 
 contemporary and compelling product overview focusing on the wide 
 variety of products at Sears for all the stages of life.&quot; 

 Lampert wants to be sure that 
 customers who buy Kenmore appliances also look at Lands&apos; End 
 clothing and use Sears Auto shops. 

 When asked about a stock split, 
 Lampert said only that the board&quot;can and will consider [it] over 
 different periods of time.&quot; 

 &quot;We are trying to create an 
 environment where we have a long-term shareholder base and a base of 
 shareholders who are rewarded based upon their views of the 
 company,&quot;he added. Lampert also noted that Sears Holdings and its 
 lofty $179.76 share price (as of Friday&apos;s close) has company with 
 other high-priced stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Google 
 Inc. and the Washington Post Co.

 Sears unveils brand strategy; Kmart&apos;s talking Mr. Blue Light 
 By Sandra Jones - staff 
 reporter - Chicago Tribune Online
May 4, 2007 

 For years, shoppers and investors 
 alike have been trying to figure out what Sears stands for. 

 At the retailer&apos;s annual meeting 
 today, Sears answered the longstanding question by unveiling its 
 first brand positioning strategy since billionaire investor Edward 
 Lampert took over Sears two years ago. 

 Sears is aiming to be a one-stop shop 
 for the home, while Kmart is turning its discount stores into a&quot;marketplace of discoveries.&quot; 

 Sears also unveiled a new TV 
 advertising campaign-called&quot;Sears. Where it Begins.&quot;that taps into 
 the store&apos;s legendary Big Book catalog heritage. 

 In one spot, a father and daughter 
 walk among the pages of the catalog, looking at larger than life 
 images of jewelry and other gifts for mom.. In another, a family 
 walks among the pages of an appliance catalog. 

 Kmart likewise delves into its past, 
 tapping its famous&quot;blue light special&quot; to 
 come up with a talking light bulb called&quot;Mr. Blue Light&quot;that tells 
 TV viewers to&quot;turn on&quot;to something new. 

 The ad campaign, which debuts on May 
 13, comes after Lampert has spent two years cutting advertising 
 expenses at Sears, a company that before his arrival was among the 
 biggest ad spenders in the nation. 

 &quot;A company without positioning is 
 like a ship without a rudder,&quot;said Lampert at the annual meeting in 
 Hoffman Estates.&quot;We have aspirations for both the Kmart and Sears 
 brands to see them improve.&quot; 

 Lampert also disclosed at the meeting 
 plans to double the number of Lands&apos; End 
 stores within Sears this year to 200 .
 

 

 Sears eyes possible acquisitions, 
 rolling out marketing campaign 
 By Dave Carpenter - AP 
 Business Writer
May 4, 2007 

 Sears Holdings Corp. Chairman Edward 
 Lampert told shareholders Friday the retail giant is eyeing numerous 
 possibilities for acquisitions or investments after two years since 
 the parent of Sears and Kmart stores was created. 

 But the billionaire investor and 
 hedge-fund manager gave no indication at the company&apos;s annual 
 meeting that the move Wall Street has been eagerly awaiting, based 
 on Sears Holdings&apos; large stash of cash and Lampert&apos;s stated 
 interests, is imminent. 

 Responding to a shareholder question 
 about his plans for the company&apos;s more than $2 billion in cash, 
 Lampert said there are&quot;a variety of options to deploy that.&quot; 

 &quot;What will shake out, especially this 
 year, really is going to depend on what the opportunity set is,&quot;he 
 said. 

 Sears was rumored last year to be a 
 potential bidder for everything from Home Depot to Anheuser-Busch, 
 but no large investment has yet surfaced. 

 While Lampert wouldn&apos;t tip his hand 
 on what companies could be targeted, the company disclosed plans for 
 its first big marketing campaign in his tenure, to be rolled out 
 beginning Sunday. 

 The Kmart brand is getting a new 
 mascot - a talking light bulb called&quot;Mr. Blue Light.&quot;The Sears brand will be promoted in commercials and ads 
 under the tag line:&quot;Sears: Where it begins.&quot; 

 CEO Aylwin Lewis said the company is 
 intent on doing a better job in promoting its leading brands in 
 appliances, tools, and lawn and garden. 

 The&quot;brand positioning&quot;or ad 
 campaign&quot;won&apos;t solve all the issues we face, but ... it&apos;ll go a 
 long way toward telling the public what do we stand for, what do we 
 want to be famous for,&quot;Lewis said.&quot;We think it&apos;ll be a real 
 turning point in continuing to build a great company.&quot; 

 Same-store sales of Kmart and Sears, 
 widely seen as a key barometer of retail performance, declined from 
 a year ago in the first quarter, according to data the company 
 released Thursday. But Lampert said the measure is overrated. 

 &quot;They don&apos;t matter as much as people 
 have said,&quot;he said during two hours of answering shareholders&apos; 
 questions.&quot;It&apos;s not the be-all and end-all.&quot; 

 Despite weak sales, Sears&apos; financial 
 performance has been improving impressively thanks to cost controls 
 and improved margins. The company&apos;s net income jumped 74 percent to 
 $1.49 billion last year and its revenue rose 8 percent to $53 
 billion. 

 The company said Thursday that its 
 first-quarter income is expected to be $200 million to $235 million, 
 up from $180 million a year earlier, as a result of one-time items 
 including a gain from a legal settlement and a dividend from its 
 stake in Sears Mexico. 

 The outlook was below analysts&apos; 
 expectations, however, and Sears shares fell $8.57, or 4.6 percent, 
 to $179.75 on Friday. That&apos;s still up 24 percent from a year ago and 
 up 37 percent since Sears Holdings&apos; stock began trading on March 28, 
 2005. 

 The meeting represented the sole 
 annual chance for investors and shareholders to directly question 
 Lampert, who dispenses with the usual conference calls, meetings and 
 media interviews. Numerous analysts were in the crowd of 200-plus at 
 Sears headquarters to quiz him, receiving lengthy, philosophical and 
 occasionally humorous answers from the man who has been compared to 
 Warren Buffett for his investing savvy. 

 An expansive Lampert quoted Buffett 
 (&quot;It doesn&apos;t count to predict rain; what counts is building the 
 ark.&quot;), invoked basketball and baseball metaphors to explain his 
 thinking on separate business issues and held a long 
 question-and-answer session with reporters afterward. 

 He also made clear that the company 
 plans to plow more money into Sears and Kmart. 

 &quot;Investing in the core retail 
 business to the extent that it provides decent returns - I would say 
 that&apos;s a priority,&quot;he told a shareholder. 

 He and Lewis said the company is: 

 - Installing Lands&apos; End shops in 200 
 Sears stores by year&apos;s end, up from 100 in 2006. 

 - Continuing to invest in Sears Grand 
 despite having pulled back on the ambitious original plans for it;&quot;It&apos;s a very important part of our future,&quot;
Lewis said. 

 - Expanding the Sears Craftsman 
 brand&apos;s presence inside Kmart stores.
 

 

 Same 
 Same-Store Sales Story at Sears and Kmart 
 By George Anderson - 
 Retailwire
May 4, 2007 

 While Edward Lampert and Sears 
 Holdings haven&apos;t shown any real talent for retailing, investors in 
 the company have been able to take solace in the strong performance 
 of the company&apos;s stock. That may have made yesterday&apos;s share price 
 drop of $9.76 (-5.2 percent) in after-hours trading a bit more 
 jolting. 

 The drop took place after both Sears 
 and Kmart once again reported declines in same-store sales, this 
 time for the first 12 weeks of its fiscal 2007 first quarter. Sears 
 was off 2.4 percent for stores open at least a year while Kmart was 
 down 4.7 percent. 

 Sears said it was hurt by slower than 
 expected home appliance sales. The company said the soft housing 
 market and increased competition in the category played roles in its 
 home appliance category performance. 

 While sales at the two chains 
 continue what may be an inexorable path downward, Sears Holdings 
 remains flush with cash ($3 billion in cash and cash equivalents) to 
 either invest in the retail businesses (when pigs fly) or to 
 purchase another entity. Companies including RadioShack, Home Depot, 
 BJ&apos;s Wholesale Club, Safeway and Gap Inc. have all been rumored at 
 one point or another as potential acquisition targets. Mr. Lampert 
 has attempted to purchase the remaining shares of Sears Canada not 
 already owned by Sears Holdings but that bid has been unsuccessful 
 to date. 

 Discussion Questions: 
What do you make of the latest numbers from Sears and Kmart?
What do you expect Sears Holdings to do with all its cash? 

 What are your thoughts on this 
 subject? 

 How much longer can Sears Holdings 
 maintain its high stock price with disappointing same-store sales 
 numbers? 

 Much longer
A little longer
No longer
Not sure/No opinion 

 I worked at Sears in the late 90s and 
 the writing was on the wall back then--declining hard good sales, 
 brand equity that rarely resonated with a younger consumer and the 
 end of the&quot;softer side&quot;success story. Sadly, in 10 years the 
 company has failed to address the issues that got it there and 
 continues to fade from consciousness for most Americans. When I was 
 there Sears had strong equity and loyalty with their Hispanic market 
 segment--great equity to build and leverage but unfortunately I 
 don&apos;t think they knew how to take a customer centric approach to 
 benefit from the good will. Lampert has never been interested in 
 running a retail company. He wants to buy out Sears Canada so he can 
 sell the Sears brand name outright in NA to someone who wants the 
 asset. The rest of the value in the assets is in the real estate. 
 What will he do with all that cash? I don&apos;t know but I suspect it 
 will have very little, if anything, to do with retail.
 Lisa Bradner, senior analyst, Forrester Research 

 Does it really matter? It&apos;s a holding 
 company of real estate, and poor retailing. Bad market positioning, 
 whether against Wal-Mart or the great Target-type operations. And 
 then you will have Kroger with its Fred Meyer&apos;s mass merchandising 
 operations rolling out. 

 Sears Holdings&apos; operation is in a 
 good position, to _ _ _ _ ! 

 Stephan G. Kouzomis, Faculty 
 and Staff Member, University of Louisville&apos;s College of Business 

 Since the merger with Sears, Kmart 
 the retailer seemed to be indeed much more of a&quot;holding&quot;company 
 than a full scale retailer, however, I have noticed some signs 
 lately that Kmart might be interested in doing&quot;retail&quot; business again with suppliers. In my twenty-five plus years 
 in the business I have learned to view Kmart as sort of an enigma 
 that has gone through more ups and downs, and more cycles and 
 trends, and more changes than the weather in Troy, MI., or, hmm, 
 make that Hoffman Estates, IL. Kmart has been everything from a 
 totally aggressive and dominant hostile market leader, to a homeless 
 group of panhandlers looking for friends and supporters, to a cash 
 rich holding company that seems disinterested in their retail 
 business, to lots of other&quot;things&quot;at any given time throughout the 
 years. Therefore, at my age for as long as I have been wrapped up in 
 this industry, I view Kmart, uhh, make that Sears Holding Company, 
 as just today&apos;s crossword puzzle.
 David Biernbaum, Senior Marketing and Business Development 
 Consultant,
David Biernbaum Associates 

 I think they have learned by now that 
 there is no sense in reinvesting in the Sears and Kmart format. 
 Sears/Kmart appear to be retail zombies at this point. The lights 
 are on but no customers in the stores. It&apos;s beyond me how they can 
 even stay open with such low sales per square foot results and many 
 of their stores. It&apos;s anybody&apos;s guess how the cash will be invested. 
 One thing I am glad for is that Sears/Kmart has stopped coming up 
 with the next new retail concept every six months and then pulling 
 the plug after six months. I did go into a Super Kmart recently and 
 some college kid tried to sell me a washer. He looked pretty lonely.
 David Livingston, Principal, DJL Research 

 The hiring of a Chief Customer 
 Officer from Best Buy signals that Sears isn&apos;t ready to throw in the 
 towel just yet. It still has enough market share (in some 
 businesses), retail locations and brand equity to be able to regain 
 its relevance. However, they should pull the plug on Kmart as soon 
 as possible, convert whichever locations are worth saving as 
 small-format Sears stores at a much faster pace (to keep up with 
 J.C. Penney and Kohl&apos;s) and salvage the few brands at Kmart with 
 credibility, such as Martha Stewart. 

 Otherwise, Sears Holdings is wasting 
 energy on a&quot;lost cause&quot;(Kmart) instead of focusing its efforts on 
 the parent brand. This is hardly the first time that a RetailWire 
 commentator has made this suggestion; the surprise is how long it&apos;s 
 taking Sears to execute a logical strategy.
 Richard Seesel, Principal , Retailing In Focus LLC 

 The recent numbers further confirm 
 what many have believed for a long time, i.e., that Ed Lampert is a 
 very good business man but not a retailer. From his business 
 perspective, he understands that the ROI from internal operations is 
 no match for the profits that can be earned from outside his retail 
 business. So, he&apos;s doing what makes sense: disinvesting in retailing 
 and investing in businesses where the returns are better. This is a 
 great example of the power of&quot;creative destruction.&quot;
 Bill Bishop, Chairman, Willard Bishop 

 There actually are some signs that 
 Sears Holdings will put the cash into retailing. The company scaled 
 back some multi-channel initiatives while consolidating its merger 
 with Kmart, but the company is looking to make up for lost time, and 
 one of the most significant efforts will be its 
 buy-online-and-pickup-in-store program. 

 They are consolidating the Sears and 
 Kmart web sites, looking to build a better overall e-commerce 
 foundation, and seeking to create a better multi-channel synergy 
 with its 3800 stores. 

 Sears has also opened a prototypte 
 3-dimensional showroom on the virtual reality web site Second Life. 
 Called the Sears Virtual Home, the store allows consumers to 
 experiment with options in virtual kitchens, bedrooms, living rooms, 
 garages, etc. Sears will also be opening an e-commerce development 
 center in its flagship store in Chicago, a testing and user 
 experience laboratory that will conduct design, function and 
 application testing. 

 Sears may have lost some relevance 
 over time, but the company has set out in a new direction to regain 
 some of the great market share it used to command. The store has a long retail history. They are now recognizing 
 the new multi-channel competitive environment, taking a new 
 approach, and reinvigorating a brand that so many people still 
 trust. 

 As a wise stock investor has been 
 known to say, buy on the dips. I&apos;m putting Sears Holdings into my&quot;recommended buy&quot;category.
 Roger Selbert, Editor&amp;Publisher, Integrated Retailing 

 
Reading this article and the comments caused me to reflect on how 
 far Sears has actually fallen. When I was young, Sears was THE place 
 to buy tools and appliances. They had quality, price and service 
 along with a fabulous warranty. It was a no-brainer to buy washers 
 and dryers and refrigerators from Sears. And Craftsman tools with a 
 life time warranty and less expensive than companies like Snap-On 
 made it easy to just go Sears for anything in this area. Wards and 
 Penney&apos;s were OK but didn&apos;t measure up to Sears. We lived in a small 
 town in Iowa and the Sears catalog was a big deal!
Especially the Christmas catalog was such a thrill when it came out 
 every year. It was the&quot;dream book&quot;as a kid and you would make your 
 list for Santa from it. 

 Fast forward...there is no Sears 
 catalog. We don&apos;t even consider Sears for appliances anymore. 
 Craftsman tools are still a choice but not an automatic one like 
 they used to be. Home Depot, Lowe&apos;s and Menards are now the first 
 place one thinks of when looking for tools. And I have to drive past 
 2 Lowe&apos;s, 2 Menards and 1 Home Depot to even get to Sears. 

 I feel sorry for all the many fine 
 employees of Sears from the years of excellence to have to see this 
 once fine company go through the ugly death spiral that I believe it 
 is in. Unless a miracle happens, the only question seems to be when 
 will the lights go out for the last time?
 Art Williams, Retail Marketing Consultant/Analyst, Independent 

 
Sears expects first quarter net income to rise from $180 million 
 last year to between $200 million and $235 million this year. Comp 
 sales decreases disappoint some investors. Other investors realize 
 that Sears Holdings is measuring its success using a new paradigm: 
 profits, not sales. Getting great comp sales increases by giving 
 away loss leaders isn&apos;t the strategy most investors appreciate. Many 
 RetailWire comments demean Edward Lampert&apos;s retailing skills. Is the 
 goal of a retailer to increase comp sales? Or is the goal to 
 increase profits? Sometimes these goals are in alignment. But 
 sometimes, it isn&apos;t worthwhile to sacrifice one for the other? 

 Many people criticize executives who 
 sacrifice long run gains for short term improvements. Ed Lampert of 
 Sears and Terry Lundgren of Macy&apos;s are both taking extremely 
 unpopular short-term positions with long-term goals in mind. Sears 
 Holdings doesn&apos;t want profitless sales and Macy&apos;s doesn&apos;t want the 
 unnecessary overhead of redundant brands. These executives aren&apos;t&quot;customer driven.&quot;They&apos;re&quot;investor driven.&quot;Is that bad retailing?
 Mark Lilien, Consultant, Retail Technology Group
 

 Don&apos;t bet against Eddie Lambert. He 
 has proved us ALL WRONG! His brain chip is processing at 3x Pentium 
 speed that the rest of our brains are!
 Mark H. Goldstein, ceo, Loyalty Lab 

 
Seems to be a lot of hmmmmmmm going around on this topic. And it&apos;s 
 no wonder why. Sears has been flailing along losing brand equity by 
 the bushels full. Although Mr. Lambert may be using his cash for non-retail related 
 ventures, I have recently seen some interest in the company to 
 actually try getting on the up-swing. As one of the old fogies who 
 still thinks of Sears as a quality brand to some degree, I&apos;ll take 
 the optimistic road and hope they will try to return to being 
 competitive in the market with some fresh, new ideas. Oh, wait. Pass 
 me another beer.
 Michael L. Howatt, VP, Strategic Consulting and Analysis, 
 Synovate 

 
Oh ye of little faith. Does anyone remember J.C. Penney&apos;s rise from 
 the
(alleged) ashes and transformation from middle American retail 
 antiquity to teen destination and web power house? 

 As Target, Kohl&apos;s and even Wal-Mart 
 push upward, Kmart is uniquely poised to become the one true blue 
 (light) discounter. Kmart&apos;s apparel and home private labels, direct 
 sourcing prowess, Manhattan fashion hub (others followed suit), etc. 
 bode well for the future. 

 As for Sears, its brand equity may 
 have faded a bit; however, it is far from&quot;out of mind.&quot;Mr. Lampert 
 has placed some talented individuals in key positions (Lisa Schultz 
 in apparel comes to mind)...don&apos;t count &apos;em out.
 Carol Spieckerman, President, newmarketbuilders 

 
With its same-stores customer base declining, how long can 
 Sears/Kmart remain vital retailers? Not forever. One thing we do 
 know is that Eddie Lampert knows money, and how money works, 
 particularly for his and his group&apos;s interests. How long would Mr. 
 Lampert lament if there was no more Kenmore or if Martha Stewart&apos;s 
 goodies added allure to some other retailers space? Is he a caring 
 Craftsman in that regard? 

 Perhaps Eddie Lampert will tired of 
 milking his style of retailing, do a reverse stock split until he 
 has all the Sears Holdings stock, then sell the real estate, 
 inventories, any remaining trash and pocket the cash for some other&quot;dash.&quot;Whoever said,&quot;Don&apos;t go into retaining. There&apos;s no big money 
 in it!&quot;We doubt if it was Mr. Eddie.
Gene Hoffman, President, Corporate Strategies International


All I can see right now is fence sitting and maybe a bit of hubris. I think we all know that Eddie&apos;s first and primary focus with 
 Sears/Kmart is in the company&apos;s real estate value, but it seems he 
 can&apos;t resist the challenge of turning around the company and the 
 cache that would come with such a success. Yet as we all know the 
 most important key to retail happiness is customer satisfaction, 
 Eddie believes in customer service just as long as it does not 
 affect profits. Finally start taking a serious look at Sears Canada 
 especially when it comes to the catalogue business, you may be 
 surprised to find this company expanding its operations into the 
 U.S. There is a reason why Mr. Lampert has 
 not been able to buy those outstanding shares.
 Bernie Johnson, Owner, A Bit of Everything 

 I&apos;m hard pressed to describe 
 coherently the Lambert/Sears/Kmart strategy, let alone comment 
 intelligently on it...and judging from the disparate comments here, 
 that can be said of most people. 

 It is, however, amusing/disturbing to 
 see the large number of&gt;Stock price increasing because Lambert&apos;s a 
 genius; - Lambert&apos;s a genius because the price is increasing;&gt;circular arguments put forth.
&apos; csundstrom&apos; 

 
Comp sales, or same store sales is a retailing specific metric which 
 would be categorically derided in any other vertical. Consider the 
 reaction of P&amp;G if they were required to report on the gain or loss 
 in revenue of existing brands...and that was the bellwether metric, 
 not total revenue, total market share or any of the other 
 performance measures looked at. If Coke was judged on the market 
 share performance of existing brands...if The Jones Apparel Group 
 was evaluated based on&quot;sales from brands in operation a year 
 ago&quot;.... 

 Comp sales have become the lazy 
 analyst&apos;s&quot;do everything&quot;metric. Mr. Lampert is proving that this is not so. In almost any other 
 industry, Sears Holdings would be considered a high performer in a 
 turnaround situation. Many companies in 
 many industries have intentionally allowed volume to decline while 
 improving net profits. 

 Yes, for long term success, there is 
 a point where the top line erosion needs to turn around and grow. So 
 what if that top line growth is accomplished via acquisition? Since 
 when has that been a&quot;bad&quot;thing to do? If 
 synergies exist within the acquisition (as has obviously been the 
 case with Sears-Kmart)then the overall bottom line will show 
 improvement as well as top line growth. 

 As an industry, let&apos;s stop being so 
 hidebound. Same store sales are not the sole arbiter of health in a 
 retail business.

 Sears in online research 
 push 
 By Jonathan Birchall in New 
 York - Financial Times MSNBC.com
May 4, 2007 

 Sears Holdings, the third largest US 
 retailer, has launched an ambitious online customer research effort, 
 backed up by a $5,000 monthly sweepstake prize, in an effort to 
 support the development of its $55bn business. 

 The move is part of what the company 
 has called&quot;a major ecommerce initiative&quot;that has become one of the 
 main areas for new investment by the company created by the 2005 
 merger of Sears and Kmart. 

 The retailer is inviting online 
 customers to sign up for membership of the&quot;My SHC Community&quot;, and 
 to participate in forums with senior company executives about&quot;what 
 is working in the retail industry and what is in need of desperate 
 repair&quot;. 

 Sears also requires members to intall 
 an application on their computers that will provide detailed 
 information on all internet usage, ranging from normal web browsing, 
 to behaviour during secure e-commerce sessions, and&quot;the pace and 
 style of internet behaviour&quot;. 

 In return, it says, it will offer 
 incentives including a monthly sweepstake with a top prize of 
 $5,000, as well as offers and promotions, and&quot;free planning and 
 budgeting tools&quot;. 

 The Sears approach recalls similar 
 online tactics developed by consumer goods companies such as Procter&amp;Gamble and Kimberly Clark. But its open approach goes beyond 
 previous efforts by US retailers, who have largely focused on 
 building up small and less publicised online panels of regular users 
 to assist with research into customer behaviour and attitudes. 

 A new related website acknowleges the 
 extent to which members will offer the retailer an extremely 
 intimate look at their online behaviour. Sears says it makes&quot;commercially viable efforts&quot;to filter out confidential information 
 such as UserIDs, passwords, credit card numbers, and account 
 numbers.&quot; 

 Edward Lampert, the investor who is 
 Sears Holding&apos;s chief executive, has stressed the potential of the 
 online presence of both Sears and Kmart, in contrast to his efforts 
 to cut back on spending on the stores themselves over the past two 
 years. 

 In December Sears announced it would 
 open a new e-commerce development centre in downtown Chicago that is 
 currently recruiting web developers and analysts. 

 Sears does not publish online sales 
 figures, but the Sears and Kmart websites are believed to have sales 
 of well over $2bn. However, traffic to both sites currently lags 
 behind their main rivals, according to data from comScore Media 
 Metrix, with 8.6 million unique visitors to Sears.com in March, 
 against over 12 million for JC Penney and over 25 million for 
 Wal-Mart and Target. 

 Sears saw its shares fall on Friday, 
 after it issued a forecast for first quarter revenues that was below 
 analysts&apos; expectations, and published figures which showed a further 
 drop in same-store sales at Kmart. The shares were down almost five 
 per cent at $179.06 in late trading on Friday.
 

 

 Sears&apos; Chairman Is Cautious On Retail Outlook, Economy 
 By Gary 
 McWilliams - Dow Jones Newswires
May 4, 2007 

 HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill -- Sears 
 Holdings Corp. Chairman Edward S. Lampert sounded a cautious note 
 for U.S. retailers a day after the company warned of unexpected 
 weakness during the first quarter. 

 Comments by the hedge-fund 
 billionaire turned retailer added to the generally downbeat outlooks 
 for the first quarter issued earlier by Target Corp. and Wal-Mart 
 Stores Inc. Most retailers are expected to report first-quarter 
 sales next week. 

 Sears and Kmart Thursday warned that 
 results for its fiscal first-quarter ending tomorrow would fall 
 below Wall Street expectations. It cited lower sales at Kmart and 
 weaker demand for home appliances at U.S. Sears stores. 

 &quot;I&apos;m sort of cautious about the 
 economy,&quot;said Mr. Lampert, citing weakness in home sales and rising 
 consumer interest rates. He said as home buying drops, demand for 
 home appliances, lawn mowers and remodeling can fall with it. Mr. 
 Lampert wouldn&apos;t rule out future acquisitions for the retailer, but added:&quot;We need to be very vigilant about controlling costs.&quot; 

 Mr. Lampert said the economic picture 
 isn&apos;t altogether glum, citing pockets of strength around the nation.&quot;I don&apos;t want to extrapolate beyond a short period of time,&quot;he 
 added. He also said April sales generally were hurt by unseasonably 
 cold weather and an earlier Easter holiday. 

 &quot;The trajectory is still upward in 
 this organization. [But] it&apos;s not going to be straight line,&quot;said 
 Sears Chief Executive Officer Aylwin B. Lewis. &quot;Not withstanding April [sales], we have a bright future.&quot;The company is launching a new Sears advertising campaign around the 
 slogan&quot;Where it begins.&quot;Kmart is also rolling out a branding 
 campaign this month that plays off its&quot;blue light special&quot;history, 
 using an animated spokesman. 

 Mr. Lampert, who acquired Kmart then 
 merged it with Sears in March 2005, downplayed the company&apos;s use of 
 equity derivatives to boost income last year, saying the use of&quot;total return swaps&quot;played a minor role in profits. Last year, it earned about $100 million from total return 
 swaps while Sears overall produced $3.6 billion of earnings before 
 interest and taxes, depreciation and amortization.&quot;When it got the 
 level of attention it did, we were surprised,&quot;he said of the swaps. 

 The company forecast first-quarter 
 net of between $1.30 and $1.53 a share, including a 27-cent-a-share 
 gain from a legal settlement and other items. Wall Street had been expecting a profit of $1.46 a share 
 excluding items. 

 Sales at Kmart stores open at least a 
 year are expected to be 4.7% lower and 2.4% lower at U.S. Sears 
 stores. The company said the home-appliance business has been weak 
 in the first quarter. The weakness at Kmart was unexpected. It had 
 been faring relatively better, turning in a same-store sales decline 
 of just 0.6% in the last fiscal year.
 

 

 Schultz 
 realistic about retail fashion battle 
 By Sandra Guy - Chicago 
 Sun-Times
May 4, 2007 

 Don&apos;t tell Lisa Schultz, the fashion 
 guru for Kmart and Sears, that the mainstream retailers are headed 
 for the trash heap. 

 Schultz, an industry veteran who has 
 worked at Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Gap, heads a 200-person 
 design team based in Manhattan&apos;s SoHo district that&apos;s dedicated to 
 upgrading Sears&apos; and Kmart&apos;s clothes. 

 &quot;The opportunity to have our own 
 in-house design team has really changed the picture for the 
 company,&quot;said Schultz, 53, of parent company Sears Holdings, 
 headquartered in northwest suburban Hoffman Estates. 

 Schultz said she is focused on 
 improving the quality, fit, positioning and heritage of Sears&apos; and 
 Kmart&apos;s in-house brands such as Apostrophe, Covington and Classic 
 Elements at Sears, and Jaclyn Smith, Route 66 and Attention -- the 
 last one a new label -- at Kmart. 

 Gone are Sears&apos; once-ballyhooed 
 labels such as BCBG Max Azria and Latina Life, as well as an 
 alliance with French Connection U.K. Sears, like other retailers, 
 makes a higher profit margin from its own clothes than it does on 
 apparel from outside suppliers. 

 Schultz has increased the visibility 
 of Metaphor, a dressy missy line, and re-introduced prom dresses at 
 Sears. She also brought back the Bold Spirit label in women&apos;s 
 activewear, hoping to attract shoppers who buy fitness equipment at 
 Sears. 

 She wants to build the children&apos;s 
 clothing business at Sears, focusing on popular brands such as the 
 retailer&apos;s exclusive Cheetah Girls brand from Disney. 

 Her goal is to make each label 
 distinct, and to reduce the clutter in the apparel aisles -- 
 strategies that her predecessors tried to do without much success. 
 Schultz has no role in Sears&apos; Lands&apos; End brand, whose design team is 
 headquartered in Dodgeville, Wis. 

 &quot;The first time I walked through a 
 Sears store, there were so many brands I couldn&apos;t figure out what 
 was what,&quot;said Schultz, who started working for Kmart four years 
 ago and took over Sears&apos; apparel a year ago. 

 Schultz has no illusions about the 
 fierce competition Sears and Kmart face, but she is confident that 
 Sears Chairman Edward S. Lampert believes in the retailers&apos; core 
 apparel businesses. 

 Rival stores such as Kohl&apos;s and JC 
 Penney have introduced their own exclusives, such as Gloria 
 Vanderbilt and apt. 9 at Kohl&apos;s, and nicole by nicole miller and Liz&amp;Co. by Liz Claiborne at Penney&apos;s. 

 Schultz is making headway in a 
 company that analysts both exhort and excoriate for ignoring 
 merchandising in favor of cost-cutting and cash-hoarding. She was 
 cited in the last two earnings reports for overseeing&quot;pronounced&quot;sales increases at Sears&apos; beleaguered women&apos;s clothing division. 

 Schultz called women&apos;s apparel at 
 Sears stores&quot;a work in progress&quot;that has a ways to go. 

 &quot;I would hope shoppers can start to 
 see a very big difference in the focus and execution of the 
 company,&quot;she said. 

 SALES OFF TO SLOW 
 START 

 Sales at Sears and Kmart stores 
 continued to drop in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, but one-time 
 gains boosted net income, parent company Sears Holdings Corp. said 
 Thursday on the eve of its yearly shareholders&apos; meeting. Earnings per share should be between $1.30 and $1.53, with 
 net income forecast at $235 million. --Sandra Guy
 

 

 Special items 
 offset same-store declines 
 By Sandra Jones - staff 
 reporter - Chicago Tribune
May 4, 2007 

 Thursday, on the eve of its annual 
 meeting, Sears Holdings Corp. said it expects profit to rise in the 
 fiscal first quarter with the help of one-time gains, even as sales 
 at Kmart and Sears stores open at least a year decline. 

 The Hoffman Estates-based retailer&apos;s 
 annual meeting draws the attention of Wall Street because it is the 
 primary forum in which investors have access to billionaire hedge 
 fund manager Edward Lampert, Sears&apos; chairman and biggest 
 shareholder. 

 Sales at Kmart stores open at least a 
 year, a measure of a retailer&apos;s health, fell 4.7 percent, its 
 biggest quarterly decline in at least a year. The decline reflected lower transaction volumes across most 
 businesses. Sears same-store sales fell 
 2.4 percent, a smaller decline than in previous quarters, primarily 
 reflecting a drop in home appliance sales offset by an improvement 
 in children&apos;s apparel sales. 

 Sears forecast that net income for 
 the quarter ending Friday will be between $200 million and $235 
 million, or $1.30 to $1.53 a share, up from $180 million, or $1.14, 
 in the year-ago quarter. The quarter got a boost from special items 
 totaling $42 million, 27 cents a share, the company said. 

 The one-time items include a dividend 
 from the company&apos;s stake in Sears Mexico and gains from a legal 
 settlement and a change in Sears Canada benefit plans and insurance 
 recoveries. Those gains were partially offset by losses on total 
 return swap investments, a derivative popular with hedge funds that 
 allows investors to make highly leveraged bets on financial 
 instruments such as stocks. 

 &quot;There&apos;s a lot going on there, but it 
 appears the unusual items account for most of the earnings 
 improvement for the quarter,&quot;said Philip Zahn, a credit analyst at 
 Fitch Ratings in Chicago.&quot;We&apos;ll have to wait for the meeting to get 
 more color.&quot; 

 The first quarter of fiscal 2006 
 included one-time gains totaling $6 million, or 3 cents a share. 

 Lampert shut down Sears&apos; investor 
 relations department shortly after engineering Kmart Holding Corp.&apos;s 
 takeover of the company two years ago. At the time Lampert stated in 
 a letter to shareholders that he expected that annual reports, press 
 releases, and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
 would be&quot;the primary way we communicate with shareholders&quot;and that&quot;substantial amounts of time spent on investor relations activities 
 such as roadshows and investor conferences distract and detract from 
 accomplishing our fundamental objective of creating value for all 
 our owners.&quot;He surprised investors last year, though, when he 
 answered questions for almost two hours at the company&apos;s annual 
 meeting, his first presiding as Sears&apos; chairman.
 


 

 Shops, 
 housing planned for Kmart site in Troy 
Mixed-use project to cost $300 million
 Detroit Free Press
April 30, 2007 

 Developers unveiled plans today for 
 the Pavilions of Troy, a $300-million mixed-use project to replace 
 the former Kmart Corp. headquarters in Troy. 

 Architectural renderings depicted a 
 multipart retail and residential development clustered around a long 
 open courtyard. Most of the buildings, which would rise from two to 
 about five stories, would have retails shops on the first floor and 
 residential units above. 

 The central courtyard is designed as 
 a town square, around which recreation such as a skating rink and 
 concerts would cluster. 

 The project is headed by BlackRock, a 
 New York-based real estate investment company. The lead developer is 
 Richardson Development Group of Reston, Va. Boorn Partners, a development firm with experience in 
 mixed-use developments, is also a partner in the project. 

 &quot;We are excited to bring this 
 world-class mixed use project to Troy,&quot;Chris Carbone, a director at 
 BlackRock, said in a prepared statement.&quot;The vibrancy of the 
 experiential retail beneath distinctive residential units 
 surrounding the pavilions in the village green will make The 
 Pavilions of Troy a unique regional draw.&quot; 

 The Kmart building that occupies the 
 site opened in 1972 and was vacated in 2006 as Kmart merged with Sears Roebuck&amp;Co. and moved its 
 headquarters to Hoffman Estates, Ill. 

 &quot;We are excited to bring this

 BlackRock, said in a prepared statement.&quot;The vibrancy of the retail

 the village green will make the Pavilions of Troy a unique regional 
 draw.&quot; 

 The Kmart building that occupies the 
 site opened in 1972 and was vacated in 2006 as Kmart merged with Sears Roebuck&amp;Co. and moved its 
 headquarters to Hoffman Estates, Ill. 

 In proposing a walkable, 
 outdoor-oriented mix of shopping, offices, residences and 
 entertainment, the developers are bidding to create a downtown in 
 the heart of suburbia. 

 The project needs the approval of the 
 City of Troy, where many officials greeted the proposal with 
 enthusiasm. Mayor Louise Schilling called it the beginning of our 
 renaissance in Troy. &quot; 

 Richardson said developers would file 
 their formal application with the city within a week. He hoped for 
 approval by the end of this year, with construction to begin in 2008 
 and the first phase ready for opening in 2010. 

 The first phase would include: 

 290,000 square feet of shops and 
 restaurants. 

 200,000 square feet of anchor tenants 
 including a health club, grocery, theaters and bookstore. 

 About 50,000 square feet of office 
 space. 

 About 200 units of residences, with 
 condos selling in the $300,000 to $400,000 range. 

 Possibly a hotel with up to 250 
 rooms. 

 Eventually, the project might include 
 up to 750 residences, including some senior housing, and 300,000 
 square feet of office space. 

 &quot; What 
 you want is as much activity &quot; within a 
 five-minute walk of the center of the project, Richardson said. You 
 want people living there, working there, in order to make it active 
 even at times when its not historically active. &quot; 

 Other phases might follow if the 
 first one succeeds. &quot; Its a balancing act 
 as to how you create these things, &quot; he 
 said. &quot; Its got to feel complete so that 
 theres never a gap in your experience. &quot; 

 Richardson acknowledged that an 
 outdoor-oriented development faces challenges in Michigan, which 
 typically experiences three or four months a year of wintry weather. 
 He said his team believed that high winds and rain were a bigger 
 problem than snow, and that his planners were taking that into 
 account as they designed the Pavilions. 

 Oakland County Executive L. Brooks 
 Patterson voiced enthusiasm. &quot; I think this 
 is great news for Troy, great news for Oakland County, and for that 
 matter, great news for southeast Michigan. &quot; 

 The project, if successful, could 
 rejuvenate the Big Beaver corridor, which in the past year, has 
 experienced two big hits the departure of Kmart and the 
 abandonment, at least for now, of the highly touted Monarch project, 
 a proposed high-rise condominium development scrapped because of 
 lack of market demand. 

 Patterson said the Pavilions shows 
 that Big Beaver remains key. 

 &quot; I 
 think Big Beaver will be Oakland Countys main street, theres no 
 question about that, &quot; he said. Big Beaver 
 will continue to be the main corridor for development in this city, 
 and this city will continue to be the crown jewel in Oakland County, 
 as far as economic development. &quot;
 
 

 

 Kmart getting ready to vacate headquarters building 
Only a few employees left at Big Beaver and Coolidge location. 
 By Lara Mossa - 
 Journal Register News Service
Royal Oak Michigan Daily Tribune
April 30, 2007 

 TROY -- Kmart is getting ready for a 
 move by clearing out its former headquarters building. The company started a public sale of office equipment this 
 week. 

 &quot;We&apos;re going to stay there until at 
 least December and until we find new office space,&quot;said Chris 
 Brathwaite, a Sears Holdings spokesman.&quot;Our plan is to find 
 something as soon as possible.&quot; 

 Kmart acquired Sears, Roebuck&amp;Co. 
 last year and established the company&apos;s headquarters in Hoffman 
 Estates, Ill. 

 Just a few hundred employees work in 
 the 1-million-square-foot building at the corner of Big Beaver Road 
 and Coolidge Highway. Sears will not disclose the exact number. 
 Thousands of employees used to work in the building before Kmart 
 went through its downsizing and acquisition. 

 Items offered for sale included 
 hundreds of chairs, tables, office supplies, commercial kitchen 
 equipment and apparel, The Associated Press reported. 

 The company made the sale available 
 to employees last week. 

 Sears sold the building and 40 acres 
 to Madison Marquette, a Washington D.C.-based real estate company, 
 in December. The agreement provides Sears a 12-month lease on the 
 building with option rights to extend the time frame. 

 &quot;They have a skeleton group there,&quot;said Ken Dalto, management consultant with Kenneth J. Dalto&amp;Associates in Farmington Hills.&quot;They&apos;re raising money to try to get 
 every asset sold.&quot; 

 Holding a public sale of office 
 equipment is unusual, he said. Usually, companies do it silently 
 through an auctioneer. The sale might be a public relations stunt, 
 he added, to show people the company is conservatively managing 
 their assets. 

 &quot;It&apos;s demeaning,&quot;he said.&quot;It&apos;s like 
 a garage sale to do it publicly rather than quietly.&quot; 

 While Sears has said it will keep a 
 significant presence in Troy, analysts do not expect many corporate 
 employees to remain here.
 



 

 OUTER LIMITS 

 As Funds Leverage Up, Fears of Reckoning Rise Fed and SEC Question 
 Wall Street on Policies; &apos;A Mockery&apos; of Margin 
 By Randall Smith 
 and Susan Pulliam - Wall Street Journal
April 30, 2007 

 RISK FACTOR 

 The 
 Situation: Regulators have grown worried about rising 
 leverage in the U.S. financial system. 

 The Players: Hedge funds and the Wall Street firms that provide them 
 with financing are among the biggest contributors to the rise.

 The Bottom Line: No one is sure 
 what will happen with this complex web of borrowing and derivatives 
 in the event of a serious market downturn. 

 Hedge-fund manager John Paulson made 
 $1 billion using a complex financial instrument to pump up a bet 
 that the subprime-mortgage market would crater. The parent company of retail giant Sears made $74 million 
 using a similar device to boost its wager that a basket of stocks 
 would rise in value. 

 Both were playing with leverage -- 
 the magical power that allows investors to make big investments 
 without putting big money on the table. These days, they have lots 
 of company. Thanks to advances in financial engineering, investors 
 have never had so many different ways to make commitments that 
 exceed their bankrolls. And never before has leverage wormed its way 
 into so many nooks of the financial world. 

 We&apos;re living on planet leverage, and 
 regulators and market gurus are growing nervous. 

 How did this happen? For starters, 
 hedge funds and leveraged-buyout funds have proliferated. They&apos;re 
 pioneers in boosting returns using borrowed money, the most 
 traditional form of leverage. Also, investment banks are pumping out 
 newfangled leveraging tools such as derivatives, complex securities 
 that allow hedge funds and other investors to add leverage without 
 borrowing money. 

 Finally, mainstream America has 
 gotten into the act. Once-conservative institutions are copying 
 hedge-fund tactics. The Pennsylvania State Employees&apos; Retirement 
 System has begun dabbling in derivatives. Mutual-fund companies such 
 as Easton Vance Corp. and Federated Investors Inc. have launched 
 funds that rely heavily on derivatives. Garden-products maker Scotts 
 Miracle-Gro Co. and other public companies have loaded up on debt to 
 improve returns. 

 This leveraging binge has regulators 
 and others worried. In the first place, no one knows how much 
 leverage there is. Much of it is hidden, because investors aren&apos;t 
 just juicing returns with borrowed money, but with derivatives, 
 which are harder for regulators to track. 

 No one is sure what will happen to 
 this complex brew in the event of a serious market downturn. When 
 markets turn bad, leverage can create a snowball effect. Lenders and 
 derivatives dealers demand that investors provide them with more 
 collateral -- the stocks, cash or other assets they pledge to cover 
 potential losses. Sometimes, investors dump stocks and bonds to 
 raise cash. Prices drop more, losses accelerate, and more selling 
 ensues. Some Wall Street analysts have 
 taken to referring to a nightmare version of this scenario as&quot;The 
 Great Unwind.&quot; 

 The Fed, the Securities and Exchange 
 Commission and European regulators have spent months trying to gauge 
 the risk by gathering information from hedge funds and Wall Street 
 firms. They&apos;ve asked the brokerage firms, among other things, how 
 much collateral they&apos;re demanding from hedge funds when they provide 
 financing. 

 Regulators concluded that Wall Street 
 firms aren&apos;t always getting enough information from hedge funds to 
 assess risk, and that they sometimes aren&apos;t asking for enough 
 collateral, according to one person familiar with the matter. 
 Regulators also found that some hedge funds, which are lightly 
 regulated, are receiving credit with terms similar to those received 
 by the biggest brokerage firms and banks, which are heavily 
 regulated, this person said. 

 On March 27, regulators held a 
 conference call with bankers from nine Wall Street firms to brief 
 them on their findings, people familiar with the matter say. The 
 regulators told them there was room for improvement on collateral 
 requirements and on their systems for predicting how financial 
 losses arising from the collapse of a big hedge fund or some other 
 market disruption would ripple through the financial system, one of 
 these people says. The regulators said they planned to dig deeper 
 into those areas over the next two months before deciding what steps 
 to take, if any, this person says. 

 Mr. Geithner, who has been deeply 
 involved in the effort, said in the interview that regulators want 
 to make sure that major U.S. banks and brokerage firms&quot;can 
 comfortably manage&quot;a shock to the system, such as a big hedge-fund 
 failure. 

 The 1998 collapse of highly leveraged 
 hedge-fund giant Long-Term Capital Management threatened to unleash 
 something like a Great Unwind, but a consortium of Wall Street 
 firms, prodded by the Fed, stepped in to prevent such a selloff. 
 Last year, when the leveraged energy bets of Amaranth LLC went awry, 
 the big hedge fund had losses of $6 billion within days, albeit 
 without rattling the overall market. 

 &quot;It&apos;s easy to put on leverage, but 
 not as easy to take it off,&quot;says billionaire Omaha, Neb., investor 
 Warren Buffett, who has warned that widespread use of derivatives is 
 endangering the financial system. 

 America has been a nation of debtors 
 for years. Prior to the 1929 stock-market crash, brokers allowed 
 customers to buy stocks with as much as 90% borrowed money -- called 
 margin debt. When the market began sliding, investors had to dump 
 shares to keep their debt levels below 90%, igniting market panic. 
 Nowadays, the SEC limits margin borrowing by most investors to 50% 
 of a stock&apos;s purchase price. (Read more about investing on margin3.) 

 But those limits don&apos;t apply to all 
 of the derivatives and other financial instruments that now pack the 
 portfolios of hedge funds and other big investors. Estimates by 
 analysts of leverage at major securities firms, borrowing by hedge 
 funds and margin loans to individuals added up to $4.9 trillion in 
 2006, compared with $1.8 trillion in 2002. Hedge-fund borrowing and 
 other financing tools were valued at $1.46 trillion last year, up 
 from
$177 billion in 2002, according to estimates by Bridgewater 
 Associates Inc., a Westport, Conn., hedge-fund company. 

 Private-equity firms, investment 
 funds that often buy entire companies, also are contributing to the 
 leverage buildup. Loans to companies bought by private-equity firms 
 rose to $317.3 billion in 2006 from $51.5 billion in 2002, according 
 to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. That&apos;s partly a function of more and 
 bigger deals. But borrowing has also risen relative to cash 
 generated by companies the funds buy. 

 Individual investors have been moving 
 in the same direction. Their margin debt -- the amount they borrowed 
 from brokerage firms to buy stocks -- totaled $293.2 billion in 
 March, the third straight month it exceeded the record set during 
 the high-tech bubble in 2000, according to the New York Stock 
 Exchange. That&apos;s up from $134.58 billion in 2002. 

 &quot;There&apos;s leverage everywhere -- 
 whether at corporations or broker dealers or hedge funds or 
 private-equity funds,&quot;says senior credit analyst Tanya Azarchs, who 
 follows U.S. banks and brokers at Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s Corp.&quot;It sort 
 of feels like something&apos;s got to give.&quot; 

 Some Wall Street executives say 
 rising leverage levels aren&apos;t alarming, in part because the value of 
 all securities outstanding has also been climbing.
In 2006, the Federal Reserve estimated there was $20.6 trillion 
 worth of corporate stock outstanding, up 73% from 2002. 

 Hedge funds, private investment pools 
 for institutions and wealthy individuals, have been coming up with 
 clever ways around margin limits for years. In the 1990s, for 
 example, some of them bought shares in affiliates of securities 
 firms and set up&quot;joint back office&quot;arrangements. That gave them 
 access to higher borrowing levels, because regulators allow 
 securities firms to take on more debt than other investors. 
 Regulatory changes have since given hedge funds more leeway on 
 margin and have made other leveraging options involving derivatives 
 more attractive. 

 These days, hedge funds are using 
 derivatives to mimic the effect of purchasing stocks and bonds -- 
 for a lot less money up front. On Wall Street, dealers offer 
 derivatives in dizzying variety. The values of some are tied to 
 single stocks, others to baskets of stocks or market indexes, still 
 others to bonds, oil prices, even the weather. 

 How do they allow investors to 
 leverage up? Consider a derivative contract known as a swap. In one 
 simple form of a swap, a derivatives dealer, often an investment 
 bank, agrees to pay a counterparty, say a hedge fund, the change in 
 the market price of a stipulated security. In return, the dealer 
 receives payments tied to something else, often a benchmark interest 
 rate. 

 Suppose a hedge fund wants to bet 
 that IBM stock will rise. Under the SEC rule governing margin 
 lending, the fund couldn&apos;t borrow more than $50 for every $100 of 
 IBM stock it buys. A&quot;total-return swap&quot;on $100 of IBM shares would 
 cost $5 or less for many hedge funds, at least initially. If IBM 
 shares were to rise, the return per invested dollar would be better 
 than if the hedge fund bought the IBM shares outright using a margin 
 loan. If IBM shares were to fall, however, the derivative leverage 
 would work in reverse: The hedge fund 
 would have to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the decline in 
 share value -- plus the agreed-upon fee. 

 Mr. Buffett contends that the 
 proliferation of such swaps is dangerous. &quot;Total-return swaps make a mockery of margin requirements,&quot;he says. 
 The widespread use of swaps, he maintains, makes the leverage that 
 preceded the 1929 crash&quot;look like a 
 Sunday-school picnic.&quot; 

 Hedge funds are under no obligation 
 to publicly disclose derivatives transactions or borrowing levels. 
 But Citadel Investment Group, a $13.5 billion Chicago hedge fund run 
 by Kenneth Griffin, had to do so when it sold bonds last year. A 
 bond offering document said the fund&apos;s leverage ratio -- the value 
 of its assets compared to its capital from investors -- stood at 13.5 to 1, due in part to its use of derivatives. That raised 
 eyebrows in an industry where 5-to-1 leverage is considered 
 aggressive. Citadel&apos;s filing noted that once certain other financial 
 agreements were taken into account, the leverage ratio was about 7.8 
 to 1. 

 What kind of leverage maneuvers was 
 Citadel using? Its filing provided one example: It used a total-return swap on a $400 million basket of 
 securities&quot;to provide leverage&quot;to the fund. That swap, negotiated 
 last October, entitled the fund to collect payments equal to what it 
 would have gained if it actually owned all those securities. Citadel 
 paid a negotiated fee to the swap&apos;s counterparty, HSBC Corp. 

 Mr. Paulson, who runs New York&apos;s 
 Paulson&amp;Co., used a different form of swap to play his hunch that 
 trouble was coming for companies that lend aggressively to home 
 buyers with sketchy credit. Figuring that bonds backed by subprime 
 mortgages would fall in value, he invested $1 billion in 
 credit-default swaps. In essence, he bought insurance against losses 
 on about $10 billion worth of bonds held by other investors. When 
 those bonds decline in value, Mr. Paulson collects from his 
 counterparties an amount equal to those declines. The subprime 
 market unraveled earlier this year, and Mr. Paulson&apos;s fund notched 
 about $1 billion in paper profits, as of early March. 

 When swap wagers go bad, however, 
 investors sometimes have to make the big payments to derivatives 
 dealers. The danger is that they&apos;ll suffer big losses unloading 
 hard-to-sell securities. Citadel offsets that risk by carrying a 
 pool of easy-to-sell securities, such as U.S. government bonds. A 
 Citadel spokesman says the fund uses leverage carefully, hewing to 
 internal risk and liquidity targets. 

 Until recently, public companies, 
 mutual funds and pension funds generally steered clear of such 
 risks. But the lines between risk takers and mainstream investors 
 are blurring. In part, that&apos;s because stock-market returns aren&apos;t 
 what they were a few years back. Between 2000 and 2006, the average 
 annual return on the S&amp;P 500 stock index was 2.5, down from 28.7% 
 between 1995 and 1999. Using derivatives and borrowed money is one 
 way to try to boost returns. 

 Pennsylvania State Employees&apos; 
 Retirement System, which manages about $32 billion, has long 
 allocated more than half of its assets to U.S. and overseas stocks. 
 Several years ago, in pursuit of higher and more consistent returns, 
 it began shifting some of that money into hedge funds, while buying 
 swaps to replicate the stock-market exposure it gave up. Currently, 
 the system has $8.1 billion in hedge funds and has arranged swaps 
 contracts for a like amount. 

 The strategy has boosted the fund&apos;s 
 returns. Chief Investment Officer Peter Gilbert acknowledges the 
 swaps could require the fund to make cash payments in a down market 
 -- unlike the paper losses generated by the traditional stock 
 holdings. But the goal is for the hedge funds to generate positive 
 returns at such times, he says, at least partially offsetting the 
 losses. &quot;This is economic leverage, not 
 financial leverage,&quot;says Mr. Gilbert, who adds that the program 
 doesn&apos;t increase risk&quot;materially.&quot; 

 Last year, Sears Holding Corp., the 
 department-store chain controlled by Greenwich, Conn., hedge-fund 
 manager Edward Lampert, entered into a total-return swap on a basket 
 of stocks with a market value of $387 million -- the swap&apos;s so-called notional value. The swap produced $74 
 million in income last year. Sears reported that the swap involves&quot;substantial risks,&quot; and that the company 
 posted collateral worth 25% of the swap&apos;s notional amount. 

 Wall Street sells the fuel for this 
 kind of speculation. Credit Suisse Group, for example, offers 
 total-return swaps through its&quot;Delta One&quot;prime brokerage program. 
 J.P. Morgan Chase&amp;Co. offers a total-return swap through its&quot;Master Swap&quot;program. 

 Philip Vasan, who runs a Credit 
 Suisse unit that provides financing to hedge funds, says the unit 
 monitors its clients, keeping&quot;a close eye on not only the overall 
 portfolio exposures and scenario analysis of those portfolios, but 
 also the individual securities and their relative concentrations.&quot; 

 But some regulators worry that 
 competition between derivatives dealers could lead dealers to loosen 
 collateral requirements too much. Hedge funds routinely shop around 
 Wall Street to find the derivatives deals that require them to post 
 the smallest amount of collateral. In a speech to bankers last year, 
 Annette Nazareth, an SEC commissioner, said that regulators want to 
 stave off&quot;an environment that encourages a competitive &apos;race to the 
 bottom&apos; concerning margin.&quot; 

 Dealers such as Credit Suisse and 
 J.P. Morgan don&apos;t disclose the amount of total-return swaps on their 
 books. That&apos;s&quot;trouble in the making,&quot;argues Janet Tavakoli, a 
 Chicago consultant specializing in derivatives. The collateral 
 provided by hedge funds to secure swaps could be difficult to trade, 
 she says. In a market downturn, attempts to unwind such positions 
 could lead to a vicious cycle of selling that would feed on itself, 
 she says. Representatives of Credit Suisse and J.P. Morgan declined 
 to comment. 

 Wall Street itself is one of the 
 biggest users of leverage. Last year, the nation&apos;s four largest 
 securities firms financed $3.3 trillion of assets with $129.4 billion of shareholders&apos; equity, a leverage ratio of 
 25.5 to 1, according to research firm Sanford C. Bernstein&amp;Co. In 
 2002, those same firms financed $1.59 trillion of assets with $72.7 
 billion of equity, a ratio of 21.9 to 1, it said. 

 Among the big firms, Goldman Sachs 
 Group Inc. pumped up leverage by the largest degree in recent years. 
 Goldman says it was just trying to catch up to the levels of its 
 competitors after it shifted from a partnership to a public 
 corporation. Its ratio of assets to shareholders&apos; equity, one common 
 measure of borrowing, climbed to 25.2 to 1 in 2006, from 17.7 to 1 
 in 2002, according to analyst Brad Hintz of Sanford C. Bernstein. 
 (Goldman says it has a pool of easy-to-sell securities valued at 
 more than $50 billion that it could tap if market conditions require 
 it to raise cash.) Goldman&apos;s 2006 profit of $9.54 billion was tops 
 on the Street. Mr. Hintz estimates the increased leverage accounted 
 for 20% of the additional pretax profits. 

 One way Goldman ratcheted it up is 
 through a joint venture with Bank of New York Co. involving 
 repurchase, or&quot;repo,&quot;agreements. Goldman uses stock from the 
 accounts of its own traders and its hedge-fund clients, selling the 
 stock temporarily and agreeing to buy it back later. In effect, the 
 cash it receives is a temporary loan. Under the program, Goldman has 
 effectively jacked up debt secured by stocks held for customers and 
 its traders from 90% of the value of those shares to as high as 95% 
 to 98%, people familiar with the program say. More than $50 billion 
 of stocks is involved. 

 Rating agencies keep an eye on debt 
 levels on Wall Street, and the credit ratings they assign can affect 
 investment banks&apos; cost of borrowing. Several years ago, Goldman said 
 it planned to lend more money to hedge funds, a move that would 
 increase its leverage. It previewed its plan to credit analyst Peter 
 Nerby of Moody&apos;s Investors Service. 

 In a meeting with Mr. Nerby in 
 February 2004, Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar and 
 Treasurer Elizabeth Beshel argued that the expected leverage 
 increase didn&apos;t warrant a credit-rating downgrade. The 
 prime-brokerage lending business, they told him,&quot;provides a stable 
 recurring revenue stream with limited risk,&quot;according to Mr. Nerby. 

 Mr. Nerby says he left Goldman&apos;s 
 rating unchanged.
 

 

 J.C. Penney Gets t he Net 
Its quiet mastery of e-biz has helped turn the department store 
 around
 By Robert Berner - BUSINESS 
 WEEK 
May 7 , 2007 

 Which brick-and-mortar retailer 
 attracts the most shoppers to its Internet store? The answer may 
 surprise you: J.C. Penney Corp. (JCP ), the century-old, 
 moderate-priced department store chain so troubled six years ago 
 that many were predicting its imminent demise. 

 In recent years, Penney&apos;s has 
 consistently ranked among the top five Web sites in terms of the 
 number of paying customers it attracts, according to 
 Nielsen//NetRatings (NTRT). In the first quarter, jcp.com drew 
 926,000 such shoppers, which put it in the company of eBay (EBAY ), 
 Amazon.com (AMZN ), Ticketmaster, and Bertelsmann&apos;s online music 
 business. The achievement has gone largely unnoticed, with most of 
 the talk about Penney&apos;s turnaround centering on the revitalization 
 of its merchandise.&quot;The perception out there is that we are an old 
 store doing well,&quot;says CEO Myron&quot;Mike&quot;Ullman III.&quot;Most don&apos;t 
 think of Penney and the Internet in the same sentence.&quot; 

 Penney&apos;s online success reflects a 
 broader trend among traditional retailers: 
 using the Net not only as a place to make a sale but also as a tool 
 to lure shoppers to stores. Penney led the way, though, in 
 encouraging cooperation between its Web site and its stores.&quot;Most 
 retailers fought territorial battles as the Internet started to eat 
 into store sales,&quot;says Jim Okamura, senior partner at J.C. Williams 
 Group.&quot;Penney embraced the Internet from the outset.&quot; 

 Necessity can foster innovation. 
 Penney&apos;s catalog revenues peaked at about $4 billion in the late 1990s and have fallen every year since, 
 though at a slower rate recently. Last year they were $1.7 billion. 
 Online sales, meanwhile, totaled $1.3 billion in 2006. 

 When Penney launched its Web site in 
 1994, it sold one product: Power Rangers. It was a modest start, but 
 the companylong comfortable selling directly to consumers through 
 its cataloghad the right mind-set to make a smooth transition to 
 the Internet. 

 LOCAL PICKUP 

 Since then, Penney&apos;s Internet, store, 
 and catalog businesses have become far more intertwined. Like Sears 
 Holdings Corp. (SHLD ), it sells a wider variety of goods on the 
 Internet: nearly three times the number of products available in its 
 1,000 stores. That has proved to be a cost-effective way to sell 
 slow-moving items, says Bernie Feiwus, senior vice-president of 
 Penney Direct, who has experience in the dot-com world as well as at 
 Neiman Marcus. Shoppers have responded. 
 Candy Washington, a Cochranville (Pa.) nurse, says she often shops 
 at jcp.com with her 9-year-old daughter because it has more items in 
 the larger size her child wears. 

 Feiwus says that mailing specialty 
 catalogs, such as for baby furniture, spurs sales online as well. In 
 August, Penney became one of the few retailers to make Internet 
 access available at its 35,000 checkout registers. And it was one of 
 the first to allow online shoppers to pick up and return orders at 
 stores. Now they can check which clothes are in stock at local 
 stores, too, a feature no other major apparel retailer offers. 

 As a result, Penney has one of the 
 most productive Web sites among mainstream retailers, says Heather 
 Dougherty, a Nielsen analyst. Internet sales accounted for 6% of 
 Penney&apos;s $20 billion in total sales in 2006. That compares with 4% 
 at Sears and less than 1% at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT ), according 
 to Internet Retailer. Even more promising for Penney: The average 
 age of its online shoppers is 25 to 35, considerably younger than 
 those in its stores.
 
 


 

 Sears 
 Tower&apos;s biggest tenant begins mulling options 
 By Thomas A. Corfman 
 - Chicagobusiness.com
April 25, 2007 

 Sears Tower &apos; s 
 largest tenant, Ernst&amp;Young LLP, which accounts for almost a fifth 
 of the skyscraper &apos; s annual revenue, is 
 taking the first step toward a possible departure when its lease 
 expires in five years. 

 E&amp;Y last week interviewed executives 
 from four real estate firms, one of which would be selected to 
 advise E&amp;Y on its alternatives in the downtown Chicago office 
 market, sources familiar with the search say. 

 The four firms, which already work 
 for E&amp;Y on a nationwide basis, are: El Segundo, Calif.-based CB 
 Richard Ellis Inc., New York-based Cushman&amp;Wakefield Inc., 
 Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. and Dallas-based Staubach Co. 
 A choice is expected in about 30 days. 

 &quot; We are in 
 the early stages of thinking about what our options might be, &quot; an E&amp;Y spokeswoman confirms, declining to comment further. 

 If E&amp;Y decided to leave the 110-story 
 Sears Tower, the accounting giant would immediately become a 
 candidate to anchor a new office tower, like Big Four rivals 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Deloitte&amp;Touche LLP, which have 
 moved to new buildings in recent years. 

 Jeffrey Barron, a senior 
 vice-president with U.S. Equities Realty LLC, which took over 
 management of Sears Tower on April 1, says in a statement that the 
 Chicago-based firm and the buildings ownership &quot; are 
 taking a responsive and competitive approach to keeping Ernst&amp;Young at Sears Tower many years into the future. &quot; 

 The ownership group of the 
 3.81-million-square-foot Sears Tower includes New York investors 
 Joseph Chetrit and Joseph Moinian and Skokie-based American Landmark 
 Properties Ltd. 

 &quot; We had an 
 excellent meeting with Ernst&amp;Young just last week to discuss their 
 long-term real estate needs,&quot;John Huston, a principal and executive 
 vice-president with American Landmark, says in a statement. The 
 accounting firm recently expanded its space by about 35,000 square 
 feet in a &quot; friendly negotiation, &quot; he says. 

 The possible departure of E&amp;Y is just 
 the latest challenge for Sears Tower, where in recent months several 
 high-profile tenants have made plans to exit, including Citigroup 
 Inc. 

 The loss of E&amp;Y would be a 
 particularly hard blow. The firm accounts for 19% of Sears Towers 
 annual base revenue of about $65.1 million, according to a filing 
 last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing is 
 part of an effort to market to investors in commercial 
 mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) a portion of the $780-million loan 
 that UBS A.G. issued earlier this year. 

 In late 2005, E&amp;Y held extensive 
 talks with Sears Towers owners about a long-term renewal of the 
 firms lease, but the negotiations ultimately broke down, sources 
 say. 

 A spokesman for Sears Tower says E&amp;Y 
 wasn &apos; t ready to make a decision at that 
 time. 

 E&amp;Y may occupy about 230,000 square 
 feet, and is said to be looking for roughly 275,000 square feet. Its 
 current lease expires in May 2012. 

 Not including the recent expansion, 
 E&amp;Y leases more than 352,400 square feet in the building, but 
 subleases about 150,000 square feet to other tenants, according to 
 the CMBS document filed April 18. 

 The firm currently pays net rent of 
 $35.16 a square foot, under a lease signed in 1991 that offered 
 generous tenant concessions in the beginning, but above-market rent 
 in the final years of the deal. 

 Yet the strengthening downtown office 
 market may work to the advantage of Sears Towers ownership group, 
 some observers say. 

 &quot; While 
 (Sears Tower) faces major challenges, at the end of the day 
 businesses look very hard at the economics of their office leases, &quot; says tenant rep Robert Chodos, a principal in Rosemont-based 
 real estate firm Colliers Bennett&amp;Kahnweiler Inc. &quot; While some people have concerns about 
 Sears Tower in the context of the world of today, we have seen by 
 direct experience that firms are willing to go into that building, 
 and take advantage of the quality infrastructure, its location, 
 unbelievable views, and what are very compelling economics. &quot; 

 The possible departure of E&amp;Y is just 
 one of the challenges facing Sears Tower, which already faces the 
 formidible task of replacing Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose lease 
 for 243,400 square feet expires in 2011. (The investment house has 
 already moved out, and has subleased about 93,100 square feet of its 
 space.) 

 In 2008-09, Bank of America has an 
 option to terminate its lease for nearly 181,300 square feet, which 
 would otherwise run until 2015. The bank pays net rent of $13.31 a 
 square foot, not including taxes and operating expenses. In 2009, law firm Schiff Hardin LLP can terminate its lease 
 for about 218,400 square feet upon payment of an unspecified fee.
To prepare for possible defections, Sears Towers owners have 
 created a $30-million fund, which would grow to $45 million by the 
 time Goldmans lease expires. The money would be used for tenant 
 improvements, such as office construction, and other expenses 
 necessary to renew the existing tenants or find new ones. The Sears Tower spokesman says the building has &quot; ample reserves. &quot; 

 Meanwhile, Citigroup Inc. and the 
 other tenants that have recently decided to move out of Sears Tower 
 currently have about 185,000 square feet of space. 

 But in what Sears Towers owners see 
 as a hopeful sign, the building has completed 228,400 square feet of 
 leases since September, including the renewal of an existing tenant, 
 software company Oracle Corp., for 51,400 square feet. 

 In the largest new tenant since Sept. 
 11, 2001, Chicago law firm Segal Cambridge, Singer&amp;Mahoney is 
 taking 68,200 square feet, moving from the former IBM Plaza, 330 N. 
 Wabash St. 

 Among E&amp;Ys rivals, 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers moved to 1 N. Wacker Drive in 2002, while 
 Deloitte moved to 111 S. Wacker Drive in 2005. 

 KPMG LLPs local office is at 303 E. 
 Wacker Drive, where it has about 254,000 square feet under a lease 
 that runs until 2012.
 

 

 Dowdy Craft Business Gets Martha Stewart Makeover a s Media Outlook Cools, 
She Tries Scrapbooks; Wooing &apos;Elite&apos; Dealers 
 By Brooks Barnes - Wall Street Journal
April 25, 2007 

 On a recent episode of her daytime 
 television show, Martha Stewart set out to make a decorative 
 songbird out of wool and felt. It didn&apos;t go smoothly. She struggled to wind the wool into a head and strained to 
 insert wire legs. &quot;This is a tough little 
 bird,&quot;she told viewers, frowning. 

 Now Ms. Stewart hopes a high-stakes 
 crafts project for her company will be less exasperating. On May 1, 
 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. will roll out a line of more 
 than 650 products aimed at the legions of hobbyists who assemble 
 elaborate scrapbooks. It&apos;s the company&apos;s biggest merchandising 
 initiative since it teamed up with Kmart stores in 1997, and it 
 represents a strategic shift toward licensing its brand and selling 
 via the Internet. 

 What does the domestic-arts maven see 
 in a dowdy industry where merchandise is sold in cluttered stores 
 stacked floor to ceiling with pipe cleaners, Styrofoam balls, glue 
 sticks, beads and fake flowers? 

 &quot;Paper crafts may sound like a quaint 
 pursuit,&quot;says Chief Executive Officer Susan Lyne.&quot;But it&apos;s 
 actually a rapidly growing business.&quot;Preserving photographs and 
 memorabilia in decorated albums -- enthusiasts call it scrapbooking 
 -- has grown into a nearly $3 billion industry, according to the 
 Craft&amp;Hobby Association. Martha Stewart Living hopes to ring up 
 enough sales of $1.69 colored markers, $4.99 bottles of glitter and 
 other merchandise to generate $100 million of annual sales within 
 three years. 

 The rollout of Martha Stewart Crafts 
 is part one of a planned merchandising blitz that the company hopes 
 will return it to profitability and deliver long-term growth. 
 Although Martha Stewart Living posted revenue of $288 million in 
 2006, up 36% from a year earlier, it had a loss of $17 million. It hasn&apos;t turned a profit since 2002, the year Ms. Stewart 
 became entangled in a securities-fraud investigation that resulted 
 in her five-month imprisonment on an obstruction-of-justice charge. 

 Ms. Stewart&apos;s high-profile media 
 businesses have traditionally been the company&apos;s engine. But both 
 magazines and television face serious long-term challenges, 
 including the migration of advertisers to the Internet and a 
 declining audience for daytime television. 

 Ms. Lyne&apos;s strategy: steer Martha 
 Stewart Living into low-cost, high-margin licensing deals. Ms. Lyne 
 hired Robin Marino, former president of Kate Spade Inc. and a 
 veteran of Burberry Group PLC and Federated Department Stores Inc., 
 as the company&apos;s first president of merchandising. Ms. Marino 
 already has lined up deals to sell Martha Stewart dinnerware and 
 furniture at Macy&apos;s, premium Martha Stewart house paint at Lowe&apos;s 
 and even Martha Stewart-branded homes. 

 But it&apos;s Ms. Stewart&apos;s bet on crafts 
 that investors and competitors are watching most closely. The 
 company sees the sector as a promising new revenue stream, one 
 perfectly suited for the Internet. Its entire scrapbooking line will 
 be offered for sale on the newly redesigned MarthaStewart.com, the 
 company&apos;s first major retailing attempt via its own Web site. 

 To succeed, Ms. Stewart will have to 
 connect with a far-flung world of customers, including legions of 
 Middle Americans who may never have used her tips on home decor or 
 holiday cooking. She put her designers to work coming up with new 
 twists on such mundane products as scrapbooks, ribbon, and cardboard 
 boxes. Her executives went looking for a retail partner whose stores 
 didn&apos;t look like a mess. And Ms. Stewart herself hit the road to try 
 to woo some hard-core crafters. 

 Martha Stewart Living has always 
 stood out as a rare business built around a single person&apos;s taste 
 and sensibility. The partnership that put its products into Kmart 
 stores has been rocky, with sales lower than expected. That 
 convinced the company of the importance of tightly controlling 
 product design, marketing and even store layouts. Otherwise, the 
 brand will suffer, it concluded. 

 Eccentric Business 

 The crafts business, in some ways, is 
 eccentric. Even outlets operated by big craft chains often resemble 
 Main Street hardware stores from a bygone era, with oddball items 
 stacked inefficiently in a dusty jumble. Suppliers are a hodgepodge, 
 ranging from the office supply giant 3M Co. to a two-person company 
 that sells a single item, Baby Tooth Album Inc. 

 Scrapbooking draws a diverse crowd, 
 crossing age groups and ethnicity, and is particularly popular in 
 smaller communities. It&apos;s possible that crafts and scrapbooking 
 enthusiasts will view Ms. Stewart&apos;s glitzy Manhattan media company, 
 along with her exacting recommendations for doing things, with a 
 measure of suspicion. 

 &quot;I&apos;m not sure people want to bring a 
 brand into their scrapbook,&quot;says Shelly Izen, the owner of 
 Scrapbook Fever, a crafts store in Salem, Ore. &quot;Martha&apos;s stuff looks pretty, but crafters are strong-willed 
 and don&apos;t want to be told what to do. Martha&apos;s stuff seems very &apos;do 
 it this way or no way.&apos;&quot; 

 The U.S. craft and hobby industry 
 recorded $29.5 billion dollars in sales in 2006. 

 Ms. Stewart, in an interview, 
 predicted crafters will ultimately embrace the line.&quot;We have some 
 high-quality, wonderful products that I&apos;m sure people are going to 
 love,&quot;she said. 

 Scrapbooking dates back to the 1800s. 
 Mark Twain helped popularize the practice by patenting, in 1872, a&quot;self-pasting&quot;book that had thin strips of glue on each page. It 
 wasn&apos;t until the late 1970s, when interest in genealogy spiked 
 following Alex Haley&apos;s&quot;Roots&quot;book and TV miniseries, that a 
 cottage industry sprouted to cater to scrapbook fans, who often fill 
 their books with pieces of family history. 

 Between 1998 and 2006, scrapbooking 
 grew from a $350 million hobby fueled by mom-and-pop stores to a 
 $2.6 billion business, according to the Craft&amp;Hobby Association. 
 Big retailers began stocking items for enthusiasts, such as 
 specialty scissors, stickers and sparkling paper. Wal-Mart Stores 
 Inc. in February said it would stop selling fabric by the yard in 
 certain stores and begin offering crafts supplies. 

 &quot;It&apos;s not a very sexy business,&quot;says 
 David Abelman, senior vice president of marketing for Michael&apos;s 
 Stores Inc., a big operator of arts-and-crafts outlets in the U.S. 
 and Canada.&quot;But a lot of people have realized it&apos;s a good one.&quot; 

 Ms. Lyne hopes he&apos;s right. Worries 
 about the future of Martha Stewart Living&apos;s media holdings have 
 contributed to a 21% drop in the company&apos;s stock since Dec. 20. The 
 CEO is eager for licensing deals to kick in.&quot;The year ahead is an 
 important one for us,&quot;she told investors in a conference call in 
 February. 

 Martha Stewart Living&apos;s stable of 
 magazines -- Living, Everyday Food, Body&amp;Soul, and the newly 
 launched Blueprint -- are growing, Ms. Lyne notes. Ad pages for its 
 flagship magazine, Martha Stewart Living, totaled 1,287 in 2006, 
 according to the Publishers Information Bureau, up 95% from 2004, 
 when advertisers fled following Ms. Stewart&apos;s conviction. 

 Slow Gains 

 But the magazine has yet to regain 
 its 2002 peak of 1,887 pages, and the gains are slowing. That 
 troubles some investors and analysts. In this year&apos;s first quarter, 
 ad pages in Living increased 11%, compared with an 80% increase in 
 the same period last year. By comparison, Time Warner Inc.&apos;s Real 
 Simple magazine, which gobbled up market share during Ms. Stewart&apos;s 
 legal troubles, saw ad pages rise by 32% in the first quarter. 

 Ms. Stewart&apos;s chief financial 
 officer, Howard Hochhauser, says the company expects advertising 
 revenue to grow by about 25% in 2007, due largely to a recent price 
 increase. He says the company views publishing as a&quot;vibrant&quot;
business. 

 Ms. Stewart&apos;s syndicated television 
 program,&quot;Martha: The Martha Stewart Show,&quot;has won awards and 
 attracted strong advertiser interest, but hasn&apos;t met ratings 
 expectations. The program attracts about 1.5 million viewers each 
 day, according to Nielsen Media Research, about 40% fewer than 
 stations anticipated when it launched at the beginning of the 
 2005-06 season. 

 Shows with similar ratings typically 
 face cancellation. But General Electric Co.&apos;s NBC Universal, which 
 distributes the program, has agreed to give&quot;Martha&quot;another year 
 before deciding its fate. Ms. Stewart recently fired the show&apos;s 
 executive producer as part of an overhaul effort.&quot;We are bringing 
 back more of what Martha is known for, teaching and how-to 
 inspiration,&quot;says Ms. Lyne, who notes that much of daytime 
 television has been struggling. The company cautioned investors in 
 February that it expects TV revenue to drop in 2007 because of a 
 failed DVD effort. 

 The merchandising relationship with 
 Kmart, a unit of Sears Holdings Co., has also been disappointing. In 
 recent years, sales have been lower than anticipated, partly because 
 higher-end consumers interested in Martha Stewart products were 
 unenthusiastic about her Kmart line, retail analysts say. To make 
 matters worse, Kmart has shuttered dozens of stores. A Kmart 
 spokesman declined to comment. Ms. Lyne says the company plans to&quot;refresh&quot; its Kmart product assortment 
 later this year. The current agreement between Ms. Stewart and Kmart 
 is set to expire in 2010. 

 Despite the Kmart problems, the 
 company believes that merchandising and licensing deals can deliver 
 growth opportunities and high profit margins, while requiring little 
 upfront investment. 

 Ms. Lyne says the crafts push will 
 lend itself to Internet promotion and merchandising. Scrapbooks are 
 often assembled communally, with aficionados hosting&quot;cropping 
 parties.&quot;MarthaStewart.com aims to both sell scrapbook supplies and 
 serve as an online forum for crafters. Users will be able to post 
 videos and photos of their projects, view craft-related video clips 
 from Ms. Stewart&apos;s show, and download instructions. The company says 
 crafts is already the second most visited section of the site, after 
 food and cooking. 

 Exclusive 
 Partnership 

 To protect its brand, Ms. Marino 
 sought an exclusive partnership with a specialty retailer. The 
 company decided that two national chains -- Jo-Ann Stores Inc. and 
 Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. -- were too downscale, according to two 
 executives involved in the matter. Representatives of those 
 companies didn&apos;t return calls seeking comment. 

 Martha Stewart Living executives 
 opened negotiations with Michael&apos;s Stores, which has 920 stores in 
 the U.S. and Canada. The typical Michael&apos;s store stocks 44,000 
 different items, says Harvey Kanter, the chain&apos;s executive vice 
 president and chief merchant. In exchange for a commitment from 
 Michael&apos;s to reduce clutter by reorganizing its shelves, Martha 
 Stewart Living named the retailer the exclusive bricks-and-mortar 
 outlet for its merchandise, at least until the fall. 

 Mr. Kanter say the changes were 
 helpful but not extensive.&quot;We just needed to think a little bit 
 harder about our customer&apos;s needs,&quot;he says. 

 For their product line, Ms. Stewart 
 and Hannah Milman, editorial director of crafts for Martha Stewart 
 Living, tried to come up with new twists on old products. Ms. Milman 
 says innovations include adhesive-backed ribbon and&quot;collector 
 boxes&quot;in which crafters, instead of pasting keepsakes into 
 scrapbooks, can create displays for wall-mounted dioramas. 

 Senior licensing manager Alex 
 Perruzzi says the design flourishes will allow the company to market 
 and price the merchandise, which also includes some paper products 
 unrelated to scrapbooks, as premium and&quot;aspirational.&quot;A white 
 cardboard box for holding cupcakes -- think school bake sales or 
 housewarming presents -- is based on one from Ms. Stewart&apos;s favorite 
 bakery in Paris. Sheets of colored paper aren&apos;t described as brown, 
 but as&quot;Norwegian chocolate.&quot; 

 In January, the company dispatched 
 Ms. Stewart and a dozen executives to Anaheim, Calif., to give a 
 group of&quot;elite&quot;private craft dealers a sneak preview of the line. 

 As the invited dealers sipped wine 
 and munched on gourmet Asian appetizers, Ms. Stewart and her team 
 talked up products ranging from stickers of daisies
($4.99 a sheet) to an ergonomically designed paper punch ($9.99). 
 When Ms.
Stewart held up one of the blank scrapbooks from the line, the crowd 
 responded with a chorus of oohs and aahs. 

 The dealers, who had started lining 
 up for Ms. Stewart&apos;s demonstration two hours in advance, reacted 
 positively to most of the products. But some references to Ms. 
 Stewart&apos;s deluxe lifestyle didn&apos;t play as well. When Ms.
Stewart described how she converted an entire floor of her&quot;winter 
 house,&quot;
located on her Bedford, N.Y., compound, into a craft-making studio, 
 several dealers rolled their eyes. 

 &quot;This is just a little preview, but 
 we are devoted crafters, as I hope you can tell, and this is just 
 the beginning,&quot;Ms. Stewart said.
 
 

 

 Wal-Mart expanding health facilities
In-store clinics to help bring &apos;much-needed price transparency&apos; 
 By Ruth Mantell&amp;Kristen 
 Gerencher, MarketWatch
April 24, 2007 

 SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- 
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to open up to 400 in-store health clinics 
 over the next two to three years, building on a pilot program begun 
 in 2005, in an aim to implement customer solutions to America&apos;s 
 health-care crisis, the company&apos;s chief executive said Tuesday. The clinics, which will lease space in Wal-Mart stores, will 
 be managed by local or regional hospitals or other third-party 
 organizations. They will also post prices for services and 
 procedures, helping to bring&quot;much-needed price transparency&quot;to the American health care system, according 
 to the company. 

 &quot;We know that customers like and want 
 these clinics. At existing clinics in our stores, about 90% of 
 patients report being satisfied or very satisfied. They appreciate the fast, easy and convenient experience,&quot;said Lee Scott, president and chief executive, in a speech Tuesday 
 at the World Health Care Congress in Washington. 

 Currently, there are 76 clinics 
 operating inside Wal-Marts in 12 states. The company, which has 
 faced criticism on its own employee health coverage, said up to 
 2,000 clinics could be in stores over the next five to seven years 
 if current market forces continue. 

 &quot;We think the clinics will be a great 
 opportunity for our business. But most importantly, they are going 
 to provide something our customers and communities desperately need 
 -- affordable access at the local level to quality health care,&quot;Scott said.&quot;We believe we can deliver effective and efficient 
 health care at the local level.&quot; 

 Also at the congress, Scott said 
 people don&apos;t have the tools and the information they need to make 
 the best possible health-care decisions, preventing them from being 
 good health-care consumers. He added that the answer to improving 
 health care is to lower costs for the whole system, and that 
 information technology&quot;is perhaps the single largest opportunity&quot;to drive out costs. 

 &quot;The private sector can make a 
 difference,&quot;he said.&quot;I believe American businesses can lead and we 
 should.&quot;Wal-Mart&apos;s move with the clinics comes at a time when 
 consumers are being asked to take more responsibility for their care 
 and its costs, and is part of a broader trend Forrester Research 
 calls the&quot;retail-ization&quot;of health care. Another harbinger came 
 last summer when CVS acquired MinuteClinic and went on to purchase 
 pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark. MinuteClinic began in the early 
 2000s in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. 

 Another in-store health clinic called 
 RediClinic, of which Steve Case&apos;s Revolution Health Group is the 
 principal investor, is rapidly expanding in partner stores such as 
 Wal-Mart and Walgreens. RediClinic is in about 50 locations today. 
 Revolution Health hopes to double that quantity by the end of 2007 
 and grow to 500 by the end of 2009, spokesman Brad Burns said. 

 The clinics are a bet that 
 time-pressed, price-sensitive consumers will seek care for simpler 
 conditions such as ear infections, pink eye, strep throat and 
 seasonal allergies just steps away from where they buy milk and 
 household items. Some retailers also see an advantage in managing 
 health-care expenses for their own employees with this model, 
 according to a
2006 report on retail clinics from the California Healthcare 
 Foundation. 

 Firing up critics 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s expansion of in-store 
 clinics enrages critics of the world&apos;s largest retailer, who say the 
 company has done little to alleviate the plight of its own uninsured 
 and underinsured workers. 

 &quot;This is another attempt by Wal-Mart 
 to avoid the responsibility of providing health care to its workers 
 and lessening the burden on taxpayers,&quot; said Chris Kofinis, spokesman for WakeUpWalMart.com, a grass-roots 
 advocacy group in Washington.&quot;This is part of a pattern. They talk 
 about addressing health care, but they don&apos;t address their own 
 health-care crisis.&quot; 

 Kofinis said the company&quot;seems much 
 more concerned with cynically addressing its faltering public image&quot;than providing affordable health care to its uninsured workers, and 
 called for Wal-Mart to provide universal coverage. He added that 
 775,000 Wal-Mart employees and their families had no company health 
 care last year, a number Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Fogleman disputes. 

 Fogleman says 90% of the company&apos;s 
 1.3 million U.S. workers have some kind of health coverage. More 
 than 47% have medical insurance through Wal-Mart, with others 
 receiving benefits through spouses, school plans or other sources. 
 Medicaid and other state programs account for 3% of workers&apos; coverage, while 9.6% of employees are uninsured. 

 &quot;By creating jobs and opportunities 
 for people, we&apos;re providing a gateway for them to employer-sponsored 
 health care -- in many cases for the first time,&quot;Fogleman said. 

 In a move widely believed to be aimed 
 at Wal-Mart, Maryland lawmakers tried to require companies with more 
 than 10,000 workers to spend at least 8% of their payroll on medical 
 benefits or pay that money into the state&apos;s health program for 
 low-income people. A federal judge overturned the law last summer. 

 Clinics target 
 uninsured 

 Surveys indicate that more than half 
 of those who visited a clinic in a Wal-Mart said they were 
 uninsured, and almost 15% of customers said they would have gone to 
 a hospital emergency room for their care if they could not have gone 
 to one of the clinics, according to the prepared remarks. 

 Providers running the clinics, which 
 will be staffed by certified nurse practitioners or physicians, will 
 determine what services to offer, and will include preventive and 
 routine care for conditions such as allergies and sinus infections, 
 as well as services such as cholesterol screenings, according to the 
 company. 

 Scott also said that Wal-Mart 
 customers have saved about $290 million on selected generic 
 prescription drugs since September 2006, when the company began 
 selling prescriptions for $4 each in Tampa, Fla. The $4 
 prescriptions have been available nationwide since November, and now 
 account for more than 35% of all prescriptions filled at Wal-Mart, 
 and almost 30% of the $4 prescriptions are filled without insurance, 
 according to the company. 

 &quot;Within days of announcing our $4 
 program, countless other discounters, drug stores and supermarkets 
 dropped their prices on generic prescriptions,&quot;
Scott said.&quot;That has surely saved our health-care system millions 
 of more dollars. So let there be no doubt that the private sector 
 can lead.&quot;

 Retailing giant nominates Penney&apos;s ex-CEO to board 
 Bloomberg News - Chicago 
 Tribune
April 21, 2007 

 BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Shares of 
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world&apos;s largest retailer, rose the most in 
 two months Friday after the company nominated former J.C. Penney Co. 
 Chief Executive Allen Questrom to its board. 

 The stock climbed $1.42, or 2.9 
 percent, to $49.76, on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest gain 
 since Feb. 20. 

 Questrom will join Wal-Mart&apos;s board 
 as the company seeks to rebound from last year&apos;s 2.1 percent gain in 
 same-store sales, the slowest in at least 27 years. 

 &quot;Questrom will be an invaluable 
 addition to the board of Wal-Mart,&quot;said Arun Daniel, an analyst 
 with ING Investments LLC in New York.&quot;His positive contribution to 
 J.C. Penney&apos;s turnaround will be viewed favorably by investors.&quot; 

 J.C. Penney&apos;s stock tripled during 
 Questrom&apos;s tenure as CEO from 2000 to 2004 
 as he sold the struggling Eckerd drugstore chain, remodeled stores 
 and brought in more fashionable merchandise. Questrom has also 
 served as chief of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Barneys New 
 York Inc. 

 Thomas H. Lee, who left the 
 private-equity firm he founded after 32 years, hired Questrom last 
 year for his new venture, Lee Equity Partners LLC. 

 &quot;For an embattled company and 
 management, I would think this would be seen as a bit of a coup,&quot;said Patricia Edwards, a Seattle-based money manager at Wentworth, 
 Hauser&amp;Violich. 

 Questrom, 67, will stand for election 
 at Wal-Mart&apos;s annual shareholders&apos; meeting 
 June 1 and is the only new nominee to the board, Wal-Mart said.
 



 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s Midlife Crisis
Declining growth, increasing competition, 
 and not an easy fix in sight 
 By Anthony Bianco - 
 Business Week 
C over Story April 30, 2007 

 John E. Fleming, Wal-Mart&apos;s newly 
 appointed chief merchandising officer, is staring hard at a display 
 of $14 women&apos;s T-shirts in a Supercenter a few miles from the 
 retailer&apos;s Bentonville (Ark.) headquarters. The bright-hued stretch 
 T&apos;s carry Wal-Mart&apos;s own George label and are of a quality and 
 stylishness not commonly associated with America&apos;s ber-discounter. 
 What vexes Fleming is that numerous sizes are out of stock in about 
 half of the 12 colors, including frozen 
 kiwi and black soot. 

 Fleming may be America&apos;s most 
 powerful merchant, but a timely solution is beyond him even so. 
 Wal-Mart failed to order enough of these China-made T-shirts last 
 year, and so they and other George-brand basics will remain in short 
 supply in most of its 3,443 U.S. stores until 2007&apos;s second half, 
 depriving the retailer of tens of millions of dollars a week it 
 sorely needs.&quot;The issue with apparel is long lead times,&quot;says the 
 quietly intense Fleming, who spent 20 years at Target Corp. (TGT ) 
 before joining Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT )&quot;We will get it fixed.&quot; 

 For nearly five decades, Wal-Mart&apos;s 
 signature&quot;everyday low prices&quot;and their enablerlow costsdefined 
 not only its business model but also the distinctive personality of 
 this proud, insular company that emerged from the Ozarks backwoods 
 to dominate retailing. Over the past year and a half, though, 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s growth formula has stopped working. In 2006 its U.S.
division eked out a 1.9% gain in same-store salesits worst 
 performance everand this year has begun no better. By this key 
 measure, such competitors as Target, Costco (COST ), Kroger (KR ), 
 Safeway (SWY ), Walgreen&apos;s (WAG ), CVS, and Best Buy (BBY ) now are 
 all growing two to five times faster than Wal-Mart. 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s botched entry into 
 cheap-chic apparel is emblematic of the quandary it faces. Is its 
 alarming loss of momentum the temporary result of disruptions caused 
 by transitory errors like the T-shirt screwup and by overdue 
 improvements such as the store remodeling program launched last 
 year? Or is Wal-Mart doing lasting damage to its low-budget 
 franchise by trying to compete with much hipper, nimbler rivals for 
 the middle-income dollar? Should the retailer redouble its efforts 
 to out-Target Target, or would it be better off going back to 
 basics? 

 If Wal-Mart seems short of answers at 
 the moment, it might well be because there aren&apos;t any good ones. 
 Increasingly, it appears that America&apos;s largest corporation has 
 steered itself into a slow-growth cul de sac from which there is no 
 escape.&quot;There are a lot of issues here, but what they add up to is 
 the end of the age of Wal-Mart,&quot;contends Richard Hastings, a senior 
 analyst for the retail rating agency Bernard Sands.&quot;The glory days 
 are over.&quot; 

 Simple mathematics suggest that a 
 45-year-old company in an industry growing no faster than the 
 economy as a whole will struggle to sustain the speedy growth rates 
 of its youth. In Wal-Mart&apos;s case, this difficulty is exacerbated by 
 its great size and extreme dominance of large swaths of the U.S. 
 retail market. Wal-Mart already controls 20% of dry grocery, 29% of 
 nonfood grocery, 30% of health and beauty aids, and 45% of general 
 merchandise sales, according to ACNielsen. 

 However, the expansion impulse is as 
 deeply embedded in Wal-Mart&apos;s DNA as its allegiance to cut-rate 
 pricing. Wal-Mart was able to boost total U.S. revenues by 7.2% last year by opening new stores at the 
 prodigious rate of nearly one a day. According to Wal-Mart CEO H. 
 Lee Scott Jr., the company plans to sustain this pace for at least 
 the next five years. In fact, he is on record saying that room 
 remains in the U.S. for Wal-Mart to add 4,000 Supercentersthe 
 largest of its store formats by farto the 2,000 it now operates. 

 Does Scott, 58, recognize any limits 
 whatsoever to Wal-Mart&apos;s growth potential in the U.S., which 
 accounted for 78% of its $345 billion in sales last year?&quot;Actually, 
 and I know it&apos;s going to sound naive to you, I don&apos;t,&quot; he replies.&quot;The real issue is, are [we] going to be good 
 enough to take advantage of the opportunities that exist?&quot; 

 TOO CLOSE FOR 
 COMFORT 

 Wall Street does not share Scott&apos;s 
 bullishness, to put it mildly. Wal-Mart shares are trading well 
 below their 2004 high and have dropped 30% in total since Scott was 
 named CEO in 2000, even as the Morgan Stanley (MS ) retail index has 
 risen 180%.&quot;The stock has been dead money for a long time,&quot;says 
 Charles Grom, a JPMorgan Chase&amp;Co. (SPM ) analyst. 

 Even money managers who own 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s shares tend to see the retailer as a beaten-down value 
 play, not a growth company.&quot;I&apos;d be surprised if true 
 growth-oriented investors were involved at this point,&quot;says Walter 
 T. McCormick, manager of the $1.2 billion 
 Evergreen Fundamental Large Cap Fund, which began buying the stock a 
 year ago.&quot;The issue the Street has is market saturation: We may be in the seventh inning of a nine-inning 
 game.&quot; 

 One can argue that the deceleration 
 of Wal-Mart&apos;s organic growth is a function of the aging of its 
 outlets, given that same-store sales rates slow as stores mature. 
 Outlets five years or older accounted for 17% of all U.S. Supercenters in 2000 and 44% in 2006, and will top 60% in 
 2010, according to HSBC (HBC ) analyst Mark Husson.&quot;There&apos;s an 
 inevitability of bad middle age,&quot;he says. 

 Meanwhile, the underlying economics 
 of expansion have turned against Wal-Mart, even as it relies 
 increasingly on store-building to compensate for sagging same-store 
 sales. On balance, the new Supercenters are just not pulling in 
 enough sales to offset fully the sharply escalating costs of 
 building them. Part of the problem is that many new stores are 
 located so close to existing ones that Wal-Mart ends up competing 
 with itself. All in all, the retailer&apos;s pretax return on fixed 
 assets, which includes things such as computers and trucks as well 
 as stores, has plunged 40% since 2000. 

 Even many analysts with a buy on 
 Wal-Mart want it to follow the lead of McDonald&apos;s Corp. (MCD ) and 
 cut way back on new-store building to concentrate instead on 
 extracting more value from existing stores, which vary wildly in 
 their performance. Wal-Mart disclosed a year and a half ago that 
 same-store sales were rising 10 times, or 1,000%, faster at the 800 
 best-managed outlets than at the 800 worst-run ones. Equally 
 shocking was its admission that 25% of its stores failed to meet 
 minimum expectations of cleanliness, product availability, checkout 
 times, and so on. 

 Scott is acutely aware of the 
 Street&apos;s discontent.&quot;We have to find a way to give our shareholders 
 back the returns that they need through some mechanism,&quot;he 
 acknowledges. In March, Wal-Mart boosted its dividend 31%. Apparently, the board also is considering spinning off Sam&apos;s 
 Club, the warehouse club division that is a perennial also-ran to 
 Costco. 

 Wal-Mart announced late last year 
 that it would trim its customary 8% annual addition to U.S. square 
 footage to 7% in 2007. At the moment, though, slamming on the brakes 
 is out of the question. Says Scott:&quot;If you stop the growth at 
 Wal-Mart, you&apos;d be silly to think that [alone] means you&apos;re going to 
 have better stores.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s&quot;home office&quot;has taken a 
 series of steps to improve the performance of its far-flung store 
 network. Last year it implemented a whole new supervisory structure 
 that required many of its 27 regional administrators to move out of 
 Bentonville and live in the districts they manage. In April, Scott 
 removed the executive in charge of U.S. store operations and put her 
 in charge of corporate personnel instead. 

 The number of stores falling below 
 the threshold of minimum customer expectations has declined but 
 remains&quot;more than would be acceptable,&quot;says Scott, who is 
 surprisingly philosophical about the persistence of mediocrity. 
 Asked why it has been so difficult to fix bad stores, HE
replies:&quot;That&apos;s a very good question. It&apos;s a question I ask all the 
 time.&quot; 

 The polite, self-deprecating Scott is 
 no Robert L. Nardelli, whose ouster as Home Depot Inc.&apos;s (HD ) chief 
 had as much to do with his abrasive personality as the chain&apos;s 
 business problems. That said, Wal-Mart&apos;s stock has performed worse 
 under Scott than Home Depot&apos;s did under Nardelli.&quot;The Street is 
 going to look to the back half of 2007 for evidence of improvement,&quot;says an adviser to a large, longtime Wal-Mart shareholder.&quot;If that 
 doesn&apos;t happen, you&apos;re going to see a tremendous amount of 
 pressure.&quot; 

 Scott&amp;Co. already are struggling to 
 cope with mounting sociopolitical backlash to Wal-Mart&apos;s size and 
 aggressive business practices. Over the past decade, dozens of 
 lawsuits were brought by employees claiming to be overworked and 
 underpaid, including the mother of all sex discrimination class 
 actions. Organized labor set up two Washington-based organizations 
 to oppose the antiunion employer at every turn (see 
 BusinessWeek.com, 4/9/07,&quot;Stop the Bullying, Wal-Mart&quot;). And 
 hundreds of municipalities across the country erected legal 
 obstacles of one kind or another. 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s initial reaction to the 
 gathering storm of opposition was to ignore it and maintain the 
 defiant insularity that is a legacy of its Ozarks origins.&quot;The best 
 thing we ever did was hide back there in the hills,&quot;Sam Walton, the 
 company&apos;s legendary founder, declared shortly before his death in 
 1992. 

 In the past few years, Scott has 
 reluctantly brought Wal-Mart out from behind its Bentonville 
 barricades. Virtually from scratch, this famously conservative 
 company has built a large public and government relations apparatus 
 headed by Leslie A. Dach, a veteran Washington political operative 
 of pronounced liberal bent. Few CEOs have embraced environmental 
 sustainability as avidly as has Scott, who also broke with the 
 Republican orthodoxy of his predecessors by advocating a hike in the 
 federal minimum wage. 

 It&apos;s not just rhetoric: Wal-Mart has 
 indeed made substantive reforms in some areas. It has struck up 
 effective working relationships with many of the very environmental 
 groups it once disdained. No less dramatically, the company has 
 added three women (one is Hispanic) and two African American 
 directors to its board and also tied all executive bonuses to 
 diversity goals. 

 It turns out, though, that there is a 
 dark, paranoid underside to Wal-Mart&apos;s visible campaign of outreach. 
 What began as an attempt by Wal-Mart&apos;s Threat Research and 
 Assessment Group to detect theft and pro-union sympathies among 
 store workers grew into surveillance of certain outside critics, 
 consultants, stockholders, and even Wal-Mart&apos;s board. Bruce Gabbard, 
 a security technician fired for allegedly unauthorized wiretapping 
 of a New York Times reporter, has described himself as&quot;the guy 
 listening to the board of directors when Lee Scott is excused from 
 the room.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s spreading Spygate scandal 
 is perhaps the most damaging in a long sequence of PR disasters, 
 including last year&apos;s conviction of former No. 2 executive Thomas M. 
 Coughlin on fraud and tax evasion charges stemming from embezzlement 
 of company funds. Coughlin, a Walton protg who had been Scott&apos;s 
 leading rival for the CEO post, is serving a sentence of 27 months 
 of house arrest. 

 There is no way of measuring how much 
 business Wal-Mart is losing to competitors with more benign 
 reputations. According to a recent survey conducted by Wal-Mart 
 itself, though, 14% of Americans living within range of one of its 
 stores - which takes in 90% of the 
 population - are so skeptical of the 
 company as to qualify as&quot;conscientious objectors.&quot; 

 But the Arkansas giant&apos;s fundamental 
 business problem is that selling for less no longer confers the 
 overwhelming business advantage it once did. Low prices still define 
 the chain&apos;s appeal to its best customers, the 45 million mostly 
 low-income Americans who shop its stores frequently and broadly. But 
 the collective purchasing power of these&quot;loyalists,&quot;as Wal-Mart 
 calls them, has shriveled in recent years as hourly wages have 
 stagnated and the cost of housing and energy have soared. 

 More affluent shoppers also walk 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s aisles in great numbers, but they tend to buy sparingly, 
 loading up on toothpaste, detergent, and other&quot;consumables&quot;priced 
 barely above cost while shunning higher-margin items such as clothes 
 and furniture. To the selective middle-income shopper, quality, 
 style, service, and even store aesthetics increasingly matter as 
 much as price alone.&quot;Here&apos;s the big thought Wal-Mart missed: Price 
 is not enough anymore,&quot;says Todd S. Slater, an analyst at Lazard 
 Capital Markets. 

 BACKWOODS KNOWHOW 

 At first, Wal-Mart management blamed 
 its loss of momentum mostly on rising gasoline pricesa theory 
 undercut when same-store sales kept falling even as the cost of gas 
 receded during the latter half of 2006. Today, Wal-Mart executives 
 are more willing to acknowledge the X factor of intensified 
 competition. Says Fleming:&quot;We&apos;re now up against world-class 
 competitors that are each taking a slice of our business.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart not only was slow to 
 recognize this threat but also responded haphazardly once it did. 
 The nub of the problem was that the discounter had relied for so 
 long on selling for less that it did not know any other way to sell. 
 Wal-Mart did not begin to build a marketing department worthy of the 
 name until Fleming was named to the new position of chief marketing 
 officer in spring, 2005, an appointment Scott hailed as&quot;an 
 extraordinary move for us.&quot; 

 Founded in 1962, Wal-Mart rose to 
 dominance on the strength of its mastery of retailing&apos;s&quot;back-end&quot;mechanics. Forced by the isolation of the Ozarks to do for itself 
 what most retailers relied on others to do for them, Wal-Mart built 
 a cutting-edge distribution system capable of moving goods from 
 factory loading dock to store cash register faster and cheaper by 
 far than any competitor. It added to its cost advantage by refusing 
 to acquiesce to routine increases in wholesale prices, continually 
 pressing suppliers to charge less. 

 Walton, who was both a gifted 
 merchant and a born tightwad, also pinched pennies in every other 
 facet of business, from wages and perks (there were none) to fixtures and furnishings. Aesthetics counted for so 
 little that when the retailer finally put down carpet in its stores 
 it took care to choose a color that matched the sludgy gray-brown 
 produced by mixing dirt, motor oil, and the other contaminants most 
 commonly tracked across its floors. To Wal-Mart, the beauty of its 
 hideous carpet was that it rarely needed cleaning. 

 Low costs begat low prices. Instead 
 of relying on promotional gimmickry, Wal-Mart sold at a perpetual 
 discount calculated to make up for in volume what it lost in margin. 
 Walton&apos;s philosophy was price it low, pile it high, and watch it 
 fly. His belief in everyday low prices made him a populist hero even 
 as he built America&apos;s largest fortune. (His descendants still own 
 40% of Wal-Mart&apos;s shares, a stake worth $80 billion.) Regulators 
 forced&quot;Mr.
Sam&quot;to modify his slogan of&quot;Always the lowest price&quot;to the hedged&quot;Always low prices!&quot;But hundreds of retailers went broke trying to 
 compete with Wal-Mart on price just the same. 

 In many ways, Wal-Mart has remained 
 reflexively tight-fisted under Scott, a 28-year company veteran who 
 trained at Walton&apos;s knee and rose to the top through trucking and 
 logistics. Last year, Wal-Mart began remodeling the apparel, home, 
 and electronics sections in 1,800 stores, replacing miles of that 
 stain-colored carpeting with vinyl that looks like wood. To Fleming, 
 the new&quot;simulated wood&quot;floor is all about aesthetic improvement. 
 His boss takes the classical Wal-Mart view.&quot;The truth is that vinyl 
 costs less,&quot; Scott says.&quot;And the 
 maintenance on the vinyl costs less than the maintenance on the 
 carpet.&quot; 

 Yet Wal-Mart is neither as low-cost 
 nor as low-price a retailer as it was in Walton&apos;s day, or even when 
 Scott moved up to CEO. Most dramatically, overhead costs jumped 
 14.8% in 2006 alone and now amount to 18.6% of sales, compared with 
 16.4% in Scott&apos;s first year - a momentous 
 rise in a business that counts profit in pennies on the dollar. 

 The imperatives of reputational 
 damage control have prompted Bentonville to add hundreds of staff 
 jobs in public relations, corporate affairs, and other areas that 
 the company happily ignored when it was shielded by the force field 
 of Walton&apos;s folksy charisma. And as the nation&apos;s largest electricity 
 consumer and owner of its second-largest private truck fleet, 
 Wal-Mart was hit doubly hard by the explosion of energy costs. 

 Wal-Mart also has purposefully, if 
 not entirely voluntarily, inflated its cost base in expanding far 
 beyond its original rural Southern stronghold. It is far more 
 expensive to buy land and to build, staff, and operate stores in the 
 large cities that are the final frontier of Wal-Mart&apos;s expansion 
 than in the farm towns where it began. Then, too, the company is 
 encountering mounting resistance as it pushes deeper into the 
 Northeast, Upper Midwest, and West Coast, requiring it to retain 
 legions of lawyers and lobbyists to fight its way into town. 

 NARROWING THE GAP 

 Under Scott, Wal-Mart even blunted 
 its seminal edge in distribution by letting billions of dollars in 
 excess inventories accumulate at mismanaged stores. A dubious 
 milestone was reached in 2005 as inventories rose even faster than 
 sales.&quot;You&apos;d see these big storage containers behind stores, but 
 what was more amazing was that [local] managers were going outside 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s distribution network to subcontract their own warehouse 
 space,&quot;
says Bill Dreher, a U.S. retailing analyst for Deutsche Bank (DB ). 

 Over the past decade, top competitors 
 in most every retailing specialty have succeeded in narrowing their 
 cost gap with Wal-Mart by restructuring their operations. They 
 eliminated jobs, remodeled stores, and replaced warehouses, 
 investing heavily in new technology to tie it all together. 
 Unionized supermarkets even managed to chip away at Wal-Mart&apos;s 
 nonunion-labor cost advantage, signaling their resolve by taking a 
 long strike in Southern California in 2003-04. The end result: Rival 
 chains gradually were able to bring their prices down closer to 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s and again make good money. 

 Consider the return to form of Kroger 
 Co., the largest and oldest U.S. supermarket chain. Cincinnati-based Kroger competes against more 
 Wal-Mart Supercenters - 1,000 at last 
 count - than any other grocer. Which is 
 why until recently the only real interest Wall Street took in the 
 old-line giant was measuring it for a coffin. Today, though, a 
 rejuvenated Kroger is gaining share faster in the 32 markets where 
 it competes with Wal-Mart than in the
12 where it does not. 

 A recent Bank of America (BAC ) 
 survey of three such marketsAtlanta, Houston, and Nashvillefound 
 that Kroger&apos;s prices were 7.5% higher on average than Wal-Mart&apos;s, 
 compared with 20% to 25% five years ago. This margin is thin enough 
 to allow Kroger to again bring to bear such&quot;core competencies&quot;as 
 service, quality, and convenience, says BofA&apos;s Scott A. Mushkin, who recently switched his Kroger rating to buy from 
 sell.&quot;We&apos;re saying the game has changed, and it looks like it has 
 changed substantially in Kroger&apos;s favor,&quot;he says. 

 While Wal-Mart vies with a plethora 
 of born-again rivals for the trade of middle-income Americans, it 
 also must contend on the low end of the income spectrum with 
 convenience and dollar-store chains and with such&quot;hard discounters&quot;as Germany&apos;s Aldi Group. These no-frills rivals are challenging 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s hold over budget-minded shoppers by underpricing it on 
 many staples. 

 To right Wal-Mart&apos;s listing U.S. 
 flagship division, Scott installed Eduardo Castro-Wright as its 
 president and CEO in fall, 2005. The Ecuador-born, U.S.-educated 
 Castro-Wright, now 51, worked for RJR Nabisco and Honeywell 
 International Inc. (HON ) before joining Wal-Mart in 2001. In 
 Castro-Wright&apos;s three years as CEO of Wal-Mart Mexico, revenues 
 soared 50%, powered by sparkling same-store sales growth of 10% a 
 year. 

 To date, Castro-Wright has fallen so 
 far short of replicating the miracle of Mexico that in January he 
 had to publicly deny rumors that he was about to be transferred back 
 to international. Instead, Scott shifted the vice-chairman over 
 Castro-Wright to new duties. That the U.S. chief now reports 
 directly to Scott both solidifies Castro-Wright&apos;s status and ups the 
 pressure on him to show results. 

 Castro-Wright can point to progress 
 on the cost side of the ledger. By tightening controls over the 
 stores, headquarters has halved the growth rate of inventories to 
 5.6% from 11.5% two years ago. Wal-Mart also has squeezed more 
 productivity out of its 1.3 million store employees for eight 
 consecutive quarters. This was done by capping wages for most hourly 
 positions, converting full-time jobs to part-time ones, and 
 installing a sophisticated scheduling system to adjust staffing 
 levels to fluctuations in customer traffic. 

 Wal-Mart has found other new ways to 
 economize, notably by cutting out middlemen to do more contract 
 manufacturing overseas. The company&apos;s much publicized green 
 initiatives have tempered criticism from some left-leaning opponents 
 but are perhaps best understood as a politically fashionable 
 manifestation of its traditional cost-control imperative. 

 By any conventional measure, Wal-Mart 
 remains a solidly profitable company. Rising overhead costs have cut into net income, which in 2006 rose a 
 middling 6.7%, a far cry from the double-digit increases of the 
 1990s. Return on equity continues to top 
 20%, however, and U.S. operating margins actually have widened a bit 
 under Castro-Wright, as costs have risen a bit slower than 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s average selling price. 

 Evidently, though, it is going to 
 take a lot more than Castro-Wright&apos;s workmanlike adjustments to 
 revive Wal-Mart&apos;s moribund stock. In the end, Scott&apos;s aversion to a 
 McDonald&apos;s-style strategic about-face leaves Wal-Mart no alternative 
 but to try to grow its way back into Wall Street&apos;s good graces. But 
 if opening a new Wal-Mart or Sam&apos;s Club almost every day can&apos;t move 
 the dial, what will? 

 Foreign markets present an intriguing 
 mix of potential and peril for Wal-Mart, which first ventured abroad 
 in 1992. Although the company now owns stores in 13 countries, the 
 lion&apos;s share of those revenues comes from Mexico, Canada, and 
 Britain. In 2006 international revenues rose 30%, to $77 billion. At 
 the same time, though, Wal-Mart&apos;s long-standing struggles to adapt 
 its quintessentially American low-cost, low-price business model to 
 foreign cultures was underscored by the $863 million loss it took in 
 exiting Germany. 

 Wal-Mart is the rare U.S. company 
 that is more politically constrained at home than abroad in angling 
 for outsize growth opportunities. In March it withdrew its 
 application for a Utah bank charter just before a congressional 
 committee was set to convene hearings. The retreat marks an apparent 
 end to its decade-long campaign to diversify into consumer banking. 

 Although Wal-Mart regularly makes 
 sizable acquisitions abroad, it is in no position to respond in kind 
 to such domestic dagger thrusts as CVS&apos;s $26.5 billion acquisition 
 of pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx.&quot;That deal is a real 
 threat, but Wal-Mart would have huge antitrust problems if it made 
 an acquisition of any size,&quot;says a top mergers-and-acquisitions 
 banker.&quot;They are kind of stuck.&quot; 

 In the end, Wal-Mart seems unlikely 
 to regain its stride unless it can solve what might be the diciest 
 conundrum in retailing today. That is, can it seduce tens of 
 millions of middle-income shoppers into stepping up their purchases 
 in a major way without alienating its low-income legions in the 
 process? 

 Largely because of the pressing need 
 to differentiate itself from Wal-Mart, Target began grappling with 
 this very puzzle more than a decade ago and gradually solved it with 
 the cheap-chic panache that transformed it into&quot;Tar-zhay.&quot;Says the 
 president of a leading apparel maker:&quot;Target has an awareness of 
 what&apos;s happening in fashion equal to a luxury player, maybe greater. 
 They have set the bar very high.&quot; 

 Scott acknowledged as much in making 
 former Target exec Fleming chief marketing officer, reporting to 
 Castro-Wright. Fleming, who had been CEO of Wal-Mart.com, went 
 outside to fill every key slot in building a 40-person marketing 
 group from scratch. He supported Wal-Mart&apos;s move into higher-priced, 
 more fashionable apparel and home furnishings with the splashiest 
 marketing the retailer had ever done, buying ad spreads in Vogue and 
 sponsoring an open-air fashion show in Times Square. 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s top management all the way 
 up to and including Scott presumed that Wal-Mart could run like 
 Tar-zhay before it had learned to walk.&quot;What Wal-Mart tried to do 
 smacks of a kind of arrogant attitude toward fashionthat you can 
 just order it, put it down, and people will buy it,&quot; says Eric Beder, a specialty retailing analyst at Brean Murray, 
 Carret&amp;Co. 

 CRASH COURSE 

 Wal-Mart did everything at once and 
 precipitously, introducing ads even as it was flooding stores with 
 new merchandise and before it could complete its store remodeling 
 program. Bentonville was learning marketing on the fly and did not 
 even attempt to adopt the sort of formal, centralized merchandise 
 planning at which Target and many big department-store chains excel. Instead, Wal-Mart relied on dozens of individual buyers to 
 make critical decisions as it pushed hard into unfamiliar product 
 areas. 

 How else to explain why a retailer 
 whose typical female customer is thought to be a size 14 loaded up 
 on skinny-leg jeans? Or why Wal-Mart&apos;s cheap-chic Metro7 line got off to a flying start in 350 stores only to 
 crash and burn as it was rolled out to 1,150 more? Or why Wal-Mart 
 not only severely misread demand for George-brand basics but also is 
 unable to replenish its stocks for months on end while&quot;fast-fashion&quot;chains such as H&amp;M easily turn over entire 
 collections every six weeks? 

 Scott loved Wal-Mart&apos;s bold new 
 direction until he hated it, his enthusiasm diminishing in sync with 
 same-store sales throughout much of 2006.&quot;We are going to sell for 
 less,&quot;Scott says now, emphasizing a return to Wal-Mart&apos;s first 
 principles.&quot;I believe that long after we are gone, the person who 
 sells for less will do more business than the person who doesn&apos;t.&quot; 

 Yet Scott also signaled his 
 continuing commitment to the pursuit of the middle-income shopper by 
 promoting Fleming to yet another new post, chief merchandising 
 officer, as part of a January shakeup of the senior ranks. Although Wal-Mart no doubt has sponsored its last glitzy 
 runway show, Fleming insists that the company is sticking with its 
 underlying strategy of&quot;customer relevance&quot; - that is, of moving beyond a monolithic focus on price to try 
 to boost sales by targeting particular customers in new ways.&quot;We&apos;re 
 not going to back off,&quot;he vows.&quot;We&apos;ve learned certain lessons. 
 Some things we&apos;ll build on, some things we won&apos;t.&quot; 

 While the look of its stores is 
 primarily a function of how much Wal-Mart chooses to spend on them, 
 the retailer is unlikely ever to come up with an ambience conducive 
 to separating the affluent from their money without changing its 
 whole approach to labor. The chain&apos;s dismal scores on customer 
 satisfaction surveys imply that it is understaffing stores to the 
 point where many of them struggle merely to meet the demands of its 
 self-service format. 

 It is entirely possible even so that 
 Wal-Mart in time will figure out how to sell vast quantities of 
 dress-for-success blazers, 400-thread-count sheets, laptop 
 computers, and even prepackaged sushi. But as Wal-Mart closes in on 
 $400 billion in annual revenues, it is going to have to overachieve 
 just to get same-store sales rising again at 3% to 5% a year. 

 The odds are that Scott, or his 
 successor, will have to choose between continuing to disappoint Wall 
 Street or milking the U.S. operation for profits better reinvested 
 overseas. Only by hitting the business development equivalent of the 
 lottery in countries like China, India, or Brazil can the world&apos;s 
 largest retailer hope to restore the robust growth that once seemed 
 like a birthright.
 

 

 

 How Wal-Mart Should 
 Right Itself 
 By Gary McWilliams and Ann 
 Zimmerman
Heard on the Street - Wall Street Journal
April 20, 2007 

 In an attempt to reverse a lengthy 
 decline in its stock price, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last fall carried 
 out a highly secretive and extensive analysis code-named Project 
 Red. 

 Project Red became public after the 
 retailer filed suit two weeks ago against a former security worker, 
 accusing him of stealing and leaking details of the project. 
 Wal-Mart still won&apos;t talk about what the review concluded, but 
 investors say a fresh look at Wal-Mart&apos;s operations and business 
 portfolio is long overdue. 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s share price this decade is 
 off 30% compared with a gain of 24.4% in the Dow Jones Wilshire 
 Retail Index. The stock, which trades on the New York Stock 
 Exchange, rose 37 cents yesterday to $48.34. The shares currently 
 trade at 15 times projected per-share earnings for 2007, cheaper 
 than rivals Target Corp., which has a price/earnings ratio of 16.7, 
 and Sears Holdings Corp.&apos;s ratio of 18. 

 Although Wal-Mart declined to comment 
 for this article, retail executives and major investors say 
 Wal-Mart, which has a market value of just under $200 billion, needs 
 to take some significant steps to regain its status as a growth 
 stock. Here is their road map for rekindling the shares. 

 Try the Golden Arches recipe. 
 McDonald&apos;s Corp. reversed a prolonged stock decline earlier this 
 decade by drastically slowing U.S. store expansion, closing 
 unprofitable outlets and improving customer service. Between 2003 
 and 2005, its shares doubled in price. The key was McDonald&apos;s 
 accepting that its U.S. business had matured, and that it would be 
 better off focusing more on overseas growth markets, such as Latin 
 America, Russia and China. 

 Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio 
 manager at Huntington Asset Advisors, which has $9 billion under 
 management and owns 2.3 million Wal-Mart shares, says it is time for 
 a pullback in the U.S. for the retailer. Wal-Mart has been&quot;too 
 focused on growth in units and not enough on the core business,&quot; Mr. Sorrentino says.&quot;They lost their way.&quot; 

 Despite hefty spending by Wal-Mart to 
 spruce up existing stores, sales at stores open for at least a year 
 were up just 2% in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31. That tepid growth 
 was partly because of increased competition from its own expansion, 
 where new stores cannibalize sales at older outlets. Wal-Mart forecasts a decline of as much as 2% in same-store 
 sales for this month, after small gains earlier this year. 

 Should Wal-Mart sharply curb its 
 planned expansion of 320 new U.S. stores this year, the financial 
 impact could be immediate. Wal-Mart&apos;s chief executive, H.&lt;TH&gt;Lee 
 Scott Jr., plans to increase capital spending by 8.5% this year, to 
 $17 billion. Paring spending to just 3% growth would free up about 
 $850 million. Add in higher earnings from existing outlets, and the 
 company would have about $2.5 billion in cash for staff training, 
 share buybacks or new stores in emerging markets, investors say. 

 Say sayonara to Japan. Seiyu Ltd., 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s struggling Japanese supermarket and department-store 
 unit, lost about $465 million last year and hasn&apos;t been profitable 
 in six years. 

 Craig R. Johnson, president of retail 
 consultants Customer Growth Partners, says Wal-Mart hasn&apos;t grasped 
 the market&apos;s cultural nuances. One example, he says, is Seiyu&apos;s 
 decision to sell lower-price gift fruits at Japanese holidays. It 
 failed because customers felt spending less would insult the 
 recipient, he says.&quot;The low-price proposition doesn&apos;t work with all 
 customers,&quot;Mr. Johnson says. 

 There are signs that Wal-Mart may be 
 close to making a decision on Seiyu. More 
 analysts have begun calling for the company to divest itself of its 
 53% stake in the unit. And a former Seiyu executive was included on 
 the Project Red executive team. Former Seiyu Chief Financial Officer 
 and current board member Greg B. Penner, according to a memo 
 reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, was on the list of those 
 participating in the analysis. Mr. Penner, a general partner at 
 Madrone Capital Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., firm that manages 
 money for members of the founding Walton family, didn&apos;t return calls 
 seeking comment. 

 Finding a buyer for Seiyu, currently 
 valued at about $1.16 billion, won&apos;t be easy, for the same reason a 
 turnaround has been difficult.&quot;Japan in general is over-retailed 
 and overstored,&quot;says Shigeki Makino, chief investment officer at 
 Putnam Investments&apos; Putnam Global Equity Fund. 

 Spin off Sam&apos;s Club, Wal-Mart&apos;s 
 small-business retail outlet. People familiar with the matter 
 confirmed that Project Red rejected the idea of spinning off Sam&apos;s 
 Club, the $41 billion-in-annual-revenue warehouse-club unit named 
 for Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. That could be a mistake: There is 
 plenty of money for such a move, thanks to a world awash in 
 private-equity funds and a healthy market for initial public 
 offerings, as shown by McDonald&apos;s 2006 divestment of its Chipotle 
 Mexican Grill restaurants. 

 One of the key reasons for 
 establishing Sam&apos;s Club -- improving economies of scale to benefit 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s discount stores -- is no longer valid as the U.S. 
 discount stores now have plenty of their own buying clout with 
 annual revenue of $226 billion. Moreover, Sam&apos;s Club has its own 
 distribution centers and logistics network. Hiving off the business 
 wouldn&apos;t require a lot of structural change, nor would it hurt 
 Wal-Mart-branded stores. An analyst at one big investor says Sam&apos;s 
 is a management distraction and perennial also-ran to Costco 
 Wholesale Corp., which has fewer stores but higher revenue. 

 Find the next Wal-Mart de Mexico. 
 With the savings from slower U.S. expansion and the proceeds from a Seiyu sale, Wal-Mart would have 
 the capital to accelerate its investment in emerging markets, where 
 its everyday-low-prices approach has more resonance. 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s growth&quot;has got to come 
 less in the U.S. and more internationally,&quot;says Adrianne Shapira, a 
 retail analyst and managing director at Goldman Sachs&amp;Co. Wal-Mart 
 became cautious about overseas expansion after executives were 
 burned by bad investments in large, slow-growth markets such as 
 Germany, she says. Ms. Shapira has a&quot;neutral&quot;
rating on Wal-Mart stock. Goldman has provided investment-banking 
 services to Wal-Mart. 

 The model for emerging-markets 
 investments is just across the southern U.S. border. Earnings at subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico rose 26% 
 last year on a revenue increase of about 16%. More important to 
 investors: Shares in the publicly traded unit returned 57.8% during 
 the past 12 months. 

 Eastern Europe, Brazil and China are 
 small retail markets today but have rapid economic growth similar to 
 Mexico&apos;s. While Wal-Mart hasn&apos;t ignored these areas, its investments 
 have been more tentative. 

 A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to 
 discuss any of these arguments. Executives 
 have maintained that a restructuring isn&apos;t in the offing. Feb. 27, Thomas M. Schoewe, Wal-Mart&apos;s chief financial officer, 
 dismissed breaking up the company at a Bear Stearns&amp;Co. 
 conference. That, Mr. Schoewe said, is&quot;just not necessary.&quot;

 Ex-Sears executive 
 was world traveler 
 By Joan Giangrasse Kates - 
 Special to the Chicago Tribune
April 19, 2007 

 In the 1980s, David V. Dootson joined 
 a group of American business executives, traveling to cities 
 throughout Europe and the Far East, and seeking to strengthen 
 communications among the United States and other countries. 

 On a trip to England the group 
 visited Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and on another they met 
 with Russian President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, soon after he initiated 
 a policy of restructuring and a climate of openness within the 
 former communist regime. 

 &quot;He traveled all over the globe, 
 meeting businessmen from everywhere and talking with leaders of many 
 countries,&quot;said his son, David P.&quot;When he came home there were 
 always stories to tell.&quot; 

 Mr. Dootson, 70, of Oak Brook, 
 previously of Chicago and Lake Forest, a longtime employee of Sears, 
 Roebuck&amp;Co. and former president of the Sears Investment 
 Management Co., died after a long battle with Alzheimer&apos;s disease, 
 Monday, April 16, in ManorCare nursing facility in Westmont. 

 Born in Chicago, Mr. Dootson grew up 
 in Libertyville and graduated from Libertyville High School. In 
 1959, he received a bachelor&apos;s degree in business administration 
 from Lake Forest College, where he was in the theater program. 

 After college, Mr. Dootson worked for 
 two years in the trust department at Continental Bank in Chicago. 

 &quot;Finance and working with numbers 
 were always his strengths, something he was very good at,&quot;his son 
 said. 

 Mr. Dootson began his career with 
 Sears, Roebuck&amp;Co. in the early 1960s, when he went to work in the 
 investment department of Allstate Insurance Co., which at the time 
 was owned by Sears. He headed Allstate&apos;s investment group division 
 before becoming executive director of investments for Sears. 

 In the early 1970s, Mr. Dootson was 
 appointed president of the Sears Investment Management Company, 
 where he remained until retiring in 1993. 

 &quot;Dave was a wonderful guy and a lot 
 of fun to work with,&quot;said David Williams, a former vice president 
 with SIMCO. 

 During the late 1980s and early 
 1990s, Mr. Dootson also served as a trustee at Lake Forest College, 
 where he received a distinguished service award for his 
 contributions, family members said. 

 Other survivors include his wife, 
 Dorothy Brooke Raleigh; five daughters, Deidre Roberts, Susan, 
 Elizabeth Vaidya; Mary Scheidegger and Kathy; two stepdaughters, 
 Pamela Naber and Debbie Porcelli and 11 grandchildren. 

 Visitation will be held from 9 a.m.

 Sears Vet Is at Heart 
 of ABN Talks 
 By Carrick 
 Mollenkamp - Wall Street Journal Online
April 18, 2007 

 The takeover of ABN Amro Holding NV 
 is shaping up to be a battle of Europe&apos;s most powerful bank chiefs 
 -- and one unlikely American: Arthur C. Martinez. 

 The former head of Sears, Roebuck&amp;Co. is chairman of ABN&apos;s supervisory board, the Dutch equivalent of 
 the board of directors. In coming days, Mr. Martinez will evaluate a 
 likely offer to sell the 183-year-old Dutch bank to Britain&apos;s 
 Barclays PLC and weigh competing interest from a consortium of 
 European banks Fortis NV, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and Banco 
 Santander Central Hispano SA. Any potential deal would have a value 
 of at least $80 billion. 

 A deal may come over the next few 
 days, though Barclays could, of course, still walk away. Yesterday, 
 the two banks said they had extended what they call their period of 
 exclusive talks, which were set to end today, to Friday. They also 
 cautioned that there was no certainty a transaction or the form it 
 would take. Separately, ABN said it would also meet next week with 
 RBS, Santander and Fortis. Other consortiums or bidders could 
 emerge. 

 ABN shares have climbed 33% in 
 Amsterdam since the company said it was in talks with Barclays on 
 March 19. The stock yesterday rose 82 European cents, or 2.3%, to 
 36.40 ($49.30), above the 35 level considered Barclays&apos;s top 
 price. Mr. Martinez, who became chairman last year, and his board 
 now may have to weigh a Barclays bid below ABN&apos;s current price. 
 Barclays yesterday fell 8 pence, or 1.1% to 748 pence ($14.89) in 
 London. 

 Tens of bank employees and advisers 
 are working around the clock on the combination of Barclays and ABN. 
 The supervisory board is receiving reports on topics such as legal 
 and cost cutting. 

 London financier and Barclays 
 Chairman Marcus Agius and Mr. Martinez have formed a good 
 relationship in their one-on-one talks, according to people familiar 
 with the situation. 

 Mr. Martinez, through an ABN 
 spokesman, declined to comment. 

 The 67-year-old has been a quiet 
 change agent within ABN. He joined ABN&apos;s supervisory board in 2002, 
 bringing to the board credibility because he had served as chairman 
 of the Federal Reserve Bank board of directors in Chicago. In 2004, 
 while he was head of ABN&apos;s audit committee, he hired an outside law 
 firm to conduct an independent investigation into money-laundering 
 improprieties at the bank. That year, ABN was fined $80 million by 
 U.S. federal and state regulators for its actions. A U.S. Justice 
 Department probe is continuing. 

 In recent months, though, as 
 shareholders have pressured the bank to consider moves such as 
 breaking up to boost its share price, they have drawn out Mr. 
 Martinez. 

 London hedge fund The Children&apos;s 
 Investment Fund Management LLP wrote Mr. Martinez and ABN CEO 
 Rijkman Groeninka a letter Feb. 20 asking him&quot;to actively pursue 
 the potential break up, spin-off, sale or merger of its various 
 business (or as a whole) in much the same way you successfully 
 managed and executed when you were the CEO at Sears.&quot; 

 Mr. Martinez made his name at Sears, 
 where he initially had success turning around the company but then 
 later left amid signs that the turnaround was stalling. He joined 
 the company in 1992 after being persuaded by Sears director Donald 
 Rumsfeld, the former U.S. defense secretary, according to his 
 autobiography,&quot;The Hard Road to the Softer Side: Lessons from the 
 Transformation of Sears.&quot; 

 Mr. Rumsfeld&quot;said the nation needed 
 Sears. Sears was crucial to the economy, crucial to the country. 
 Sears was an American institution,&quot;Mr. Martinez wrote. 

 Initially, Mr. Martinez reshuffled 
 leadership and hired a retired three-star army general as logistics 
 czar.&quot;He was one of the people who really changed the course of 
 Sears...and brought it into the 21st century,&quot;says Walter Loeb of 
 retail consulting firm Loeb Associates in New York. By 1999, the 
 turnaround was stalling amid increasing souring loans from the 
 company&apos;s credit-card accounts. In 2000, Sears began looking for a 
 replacement under a search supported by Mr. Martinez, who had told 
 the board he wanted to retire. In September 2000, Sears tapped Sears 
 executive Alan Lacy to succeed Mr. Martinez. 

 Mr. Martinez has been in difficult 
 boardrooms before. In 2003, he served as a director of Martha 
 Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. and took over as lead director when 
 Ms. Stewart was indicted on five criminal counts, including 
 securities fraud.

 DraftFCB gets Kmart ad 
 account 
Business fills void after Wal-Mart cut ties amid scandal
 By Sandra 
 Jones - staff reporter - Chicago Tribune
April 18, 2007 

 In what some in the advertising 
 industry are saying is an unusual bit of redemption in the 
 unforgiving world of advertising, the Kmart division of Sears 
 Holdings Corp. awarded its advertising business to Chicago&apos;s 
 DraftFCB, stepping into a void created in December when rival 
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
abruptly pulled its account in the wake of a controversy. 

 DraftFCB, an agency known more for 
 its ability to measure results than develop edgy, creative 
 campaigns, becomes Kmart&apos;s agency of record starting May 1, 
 replacing Grey Worldwide, a New York firm that has been the discount 
 chain&apos;s agency of record since 2003. 

 The change happened without a formal 
 agency review, an unusual occurrence in the ad world. And it gives 
 Kmart a chance to pick up where Wal-Mart left off, diving into vast 
 quantities of consumer data to target specific shoppers and 
 measuring the returns. 

 &quot;The best marketing you can do is 
 marketing down to a very specific individual level,&quot;said Dan 
 Howard, chair of the marketing department at Southern Methodist 
 University in Dallas.&quot;Kmart needs to do it. Their competition is 
 already doing it and unless they get very good at it, they&apos;re going 
 to lose out.&quot; 

 Kmart and DraftFCB executives began 
 talking informally in January about putting DraftFCB&apos;s 
 metric-intense model to work for Kmart. DraftFCB&apos;s plan for Wal-Mart 
 centered on breaking down the mass-market message into smaller 
 segments aimed at slices of America. The technique, called 
 micro-marketing, allows retailers to localize ads and target 
 specific demographic groups. 

 Maureen McGuire, Sears&apos; chief 
 marketing officer, declined to discuss DraftFCB&apos;s marketing plans 
 for the company, but said she liked the level of detail the agency 
 took to look at Kmart&apos;s marketing segments. 

 &quot;We believe we&apos;re on the point of a 
 new positioning for Kmart and we would like to be able to use the 
 dollars effectively as possible,&quot;said McGuire. &quot;You only have to look at what&apos;s going on in the world to 
 know the media landscape is changing.&quot; 

 DraftFCB&apos;s efforts to measure return 
 on investment, a constant challenge in advertising, won over 
 cost-conscious Wal-Mart. No doubt it also sat well with Edward 
 Lampert, Sears&apos; chairman and biggest shareholder, renowned for his 
 bottom-line approach to retail. Lampert trimmed ad spending at Sears 
 since taking over the company in 2005, and is reluctant to put money 
 into new projects without some assurance of a return on the 
 investment. 

 &quot;We&apos;re going to be thinking very 
 carefully about how we use our marketing dollars,&quot;said McGuire, who 
 joined Sears in 2005 after a 30-year career at IBM Corp. 

 McGuire declined to disclose Kmart&apos;s 
 ad budget. But Kmart&apos;s advertising account had been $270 million a 
 year in 2003 when Grey took it on. It is believed to be today less 
 than half the size of the $580 million account Wal-Mart canceled. 

 Whatever the amount, Kmart&apos;s arrival 
 is a vindication of sorts for DraftFCB. It 
 gives the newly formed agency a major retail client, amid a roster 
 of fast-food restaurants and consumer product-makers. And it allows 
 DraftFCB a chance to put the Wal-Mart episode behind it. 

 DraftFCB found itself in the middle 
 of a scandal when Wal-Mart fired its top advertising executive, 
 Julie Roehm, for violating company ethics. The retailer alleged she 
 had an inappropriate relationship with an employee who worked for 
 her and accepted gifts from the agencies vying for Wal-Mart&apos;s 
 business. Roehm has denied the allegations in a lawsuit against the 
 retailer. 

 Wal-Mart dismissed DraftFCB a few 
 days later with no public explanation. Draft later issued a memo to employees saying that it had not 
 violated its own company policies. 

 In a staff memo announcing the new 
 account Tuesday, DraftFCB Chairman and CEO Howard Draft and other 
 top executives stated outright,&quot;You&apos;re probably surprised. After 
 all, the account wasn&apos;t even in review.&quot; 

 The memo went on to describe,&quot;What 
 started as quiet conversations at the highest levels of our 
 respective organizations soon led to an invitation to pitch the 
 Kmart account. We assembled a core team of talented people spanning 
 our offices in Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Seattle to put 
 together a highly confidential and truly compelling presentation.&quot; 

 The memo said the agency was first 
 contacted by Kmart in October. But, since the agency was in final 
 days of the Wal-Mart pitch,&quot;we had to decline.&quot; 

 DraftFCB executives were unavailable 
 for comment, and McGuire declined to discuss the specifics of the 
 pitch. 

 DraftFCB&apos;s scope of work will include 
 television, magazine and radio advertising, customer analysis and 
 strategy, data analysis, customer relationship marketing and 
 branding. New York-based Interpublic Group created DraftFCB in June 
 by combining Draft with Foote Cone&amp;Belding. 

 The Kmart agreement doesn&apos;t affect 
 the Sears division. Sears cut ties with Ogilvy&amp;Mather Worldwide in 
 2005, after 43 years, consolidating what was then a $600 million 
 account at Young&amp;Rubicam, which remains the Sears division&apos;s 
 agency of record. 

 The media buying business at the 
 combined company is up for review, and Sears is also searching for a 
 chief marketing officer for the Sears division. A decision on both 
 issues is expected in the second quarter, McGuire said.
 

 

 DraftFCB Rebounds With 
 Kmart Win 
Shop Returns to Retail, Appears Back on Track After Wal-Mart Sting
 By Suzanne Vranica - 
 Wall Street Journal
April 18, 2007 

 Goodbye, Wal-Mart. Hello, Kmart. 

 That was the news yesterday for 
 DraftFCB. Four months after being abruptly fired from Wal-Mart 
 Stores&apos; $580 million ad account in the midst of a marketing scandal, 
 the Interpublic Group agency jumped back into the retail sector by 
 winning Kmart&apos;s $224.6 million ad account. 

 Coming just a day after DraftFCB won 
 Kraft Foods&apos; Lunchables brand, the Kmart-account win could signal 
 that the firm is getting back on track after the Wal-Mart debacle. 

 &quot;I think it&apos;s a positive statement 
 for them,&quot;says Dick Roth, who heads New York&apos;s Roth Associates, a 
 consulting firm for marketers.&quot;It&apos;s an endorsement from two 
 significant advertisers at a time when an endorsement can be helpful 
 and is welcome.&quot; 

 Being fired by Wal-Mart was a black 
 eye for DraftFCB, which had been formed just a few months earlier by 
 the merger of an Interpublic direct-marketing shop with a creative 
 agency. The new firm had won the Wal-Mart account in late October, 
 after a highly competitive selection process. The win was seen as 
 validating the rationale behind the new firm, calming critics who 
 worried that Interpublic had in the past failed at many of its 
 internal mergers. 

 But those positive sentiments went 
 out the window in December. Before its new contract with Wal-Mart 
 was even signed, the agency was fired. The firing came just a couple 
 of days after Wal-Mart had terminated two of its marketing 
 executives amid allegations that the selection process that led to 
 DraftFCB&apos;s hiring was unfair. In court documents filed last month, 
 Wal-Mart claimed that DraftFCB not only gave gifts to one of the 
 executives, Julie Roehm -- breaching Wal-Mart policy -- but also 
 even discussed future employment opportunities for the two marketing 
 executives. 

 The controversy put the spotlight on 
 some of Madison Avenue&apos;s business practices. It also raised 
 questions about whether DraftFCB, run by outspoken Chief Executive 
 Howard Draft, could regain momentum. Wal-Mart wasn&apos;t the only 
 account loss the new firm suffered. Since its formation, DraftFCB 
 has also lost ad duties for Diet Coke and, more recently, Applebee&apos;s 
 International and Qwest Communications International, although it 
 has also had some smaller business wins, such as Atari. 

 The Kmart win is likely to put some 
 of those questions to rest. Kmart, a unit of Sears Holdings, chose 
 the Interpublic Group agency because of the shop&apos;s skills in&quot;analytics&quot;and&quot;customer insights,&quot;says Maureen McGuire, chief 
 marketing officer of Sears Holdings, who awarded the business 
 without a review. DraftFCB picks up ad duties from WPP Group&apos;s Grey 
 Worldwide, which has worked for the brand since 2003. 

 &quot;Our decision was based solely on the 
 capabilities of DraftFCB and the support we think they can provide 
 Kmart,&quot;says Bill Stewart, Kmart&apos;s chief marketing officer, who had 
 worked with FCB during his tenure at Levi Strauss. Among the 
 strengths DraftFCB emphasized was a department that does detailed 
 research on competitors, Mr. Stewart says. 

 The Wal-Mart incident&quot;wasn&apos;t 
 important,&quot;Ms. McGuire says. 

 Kmart executives said DraftFCB wasted 
 little time after the Wal-Mart episode in seeking a new retail 
 client. In early January, while the Wal-Mart drama was still 
 reverberating through the media, Dominic Whittles, president of 
 DraftFCB&apos;s West Coast operations, called Mr. Stewart to seek some of 
 the department store&apos;s business. The two companies already knew each 
 other:
DraftFCB was one of several direct-marketing firms Kmart approached 
 last year about an assignment, although DraftFCB had to pass because 
 it was already pitching the Wal-Mart work. 

 DraftFCB&apos;s first assignment at Kmart: 
 developing its all-important back-to-school campaign for the summer. 

 The selection of DraftFCB comes 
 several weeks after Sears put into review the $740 million 
 media-buying account for both Sears stores and Kmart. That review is 
 still under way. Sears says it has no plans to put the Sears 
 creative account up for grabs; that work is currently handled by WPP 
 Group&apos;s Young&amp;Rubicam. Y&amp;R is working on&quot;some interesting 
 campaigns,&quot;Ms. McGuire says.
 

 

 Kmart 
 Hires Agency That Lost Wal-Mart Account 
 By Stuart Elliotot - New 
 York Times
April 18, 2007 

 Kmart is changing its creative 
 advertising agency after four years, hiring the agency that recently 
 won - then lost - the creative account of its major competitor, Wal-Mart Stores. 

 Kmart, part of the Sears Holdings 
 Corporation, said today that it would hire Draft FCB in Chicago, 
 part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, in 90 days. Draft FCB 
 will create campaigns for television, radio and magazines and handle 
 tasks like producing ads aimed at regular Kmart shoppers, known as 
 customer relationship marketing. &quot; At 
 Kmart, were all about building long-term relationships with our 
 customers, &quot; Bill Stewart, chief marketing 
 officer at Kmart in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said in a telephone 
 interview. 

 &quot; Draft 
 FCB brings a 360-degree approach to marketing and building 
 relationships &quot; , he added, referring to the 
 work the agency performs in analyzing data about who shoppers are 
 and what they buy. 

 Kmart spends about $200 million a 
 year on advertising in major media, compared with about $580 million 
 a year spent by Wal-Mart. 

 In hiring Draft FCB, Kmart is 
 dismissing Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group 
 unit of the WPP Group. Kmart hired Grey as its creative agency in 
 August 2003. 

 The timing is the dismissal is 
 unusual because Grey is finishing its work on a major brand-image 
 campaign for Kmart that is scheduled to begin appearing next month. 

 &quot; We 
 think the campaign works well, &quot; said 
 Maureen McGuire, chief marketing officer at Sears Holdings, who 
 joined Mr. Stewart for the interview, but the agency shift &quot; is not about the creative. &quot; 

 &quot; It &apos; s 
 about all the capabilities Draft FCB brings, &quot; she added. 

 Trade publications had speculated 
 that senior managers of Kmart and Howard Draft, the chief executive 
 of Draft FCB, had been discussing ways to work together as Mr. Draft 
 sought to move on after the stinging, and highly publicized, loss of 
 the Wal-Mart creative assignment. 

 &quot; Of course 
 we knew that, &quot; Ms. McGuire said of what 
 took place between Wal-Mart and Draft FCB, &quot; but 
 we made this decision totally on the capabilities Draft FCB can 
 bring to Kmart as we build a better brand. &quot; 

 Wal-Mart hired Draft FCB last 
 October, then told the agency never mind two months later, citing 
 what Wal-Mart described as improper conduct by two of its executives 
 who were involved in the search for a new creative agency that 
 concluded with the selection of Draft FCB. 

 Wal-Mart fired the executives, Julie 
 Roehm and Sean Womack, charging them with favoring Draft FCB and Mr. 
 Draft in the review process through behavior like accepting gifts 
 and meals. Ms. Roehm and Mr. Womack have denied any wrongdoing. 

 When Wal-Mart conducted the review a 
 second time, Draft FCB was specifically excluded from the process, 
 which further wounded the agency and Mr. Draft. The second review ended with the choice of another 
 Interpublic agency, the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., to handle 
 the Wal-Mart creative assignment. 

 Ms. Roehm is suing Wal-Mart for 
 severance pay and listed Mr. Draft as a potential witness on her 
 behalf. Wal-Mart is countersuing her. 

 The decision to shift the creative 
 assignment to Draft FCB from Grey came without a review. By 
 comparison, earlier this month Sears Holdings announced a review to 
 find a new agency to handle the media planning and buying duties for 
 both Kmart and Sears, Roebuck. 

 The media assignment is now divided 
 between two WPP agencies: MindShare, for traditional media, and MEC 
 Interaction, for interactive ads. Both are taking part in the media 
 review.
 
 


 

 AARP deals 
 could double its HMO membership 
 By Julie Appleby and 
 Richard Wolf, USA Today 
April 17, 2007 

WASHINGTON - AARP, the 
 advocacy group for seniors, said Monday that it has signed 
 seven-year agreements with major insurers Aetna and Unitedhealth 
 care that could double the number of people in its branded health 
 insurance offerings. The deals could help 
 shape the growing movement toward paying incentives to insurers who 
 meet certain quality-of-care benchmarks.

 Under the agreements: 

 Aetna (AET) will begin selling health 
 insurance policies for AARP members ages 50 to 64 by Jan. 1, 2008. 
 Initially, they will be available in about half of the states.

 Unitedhealth (UNH) care will begin offering a 
 Medicare HMO plan to those over age 65. The plan will have no 
 monthly premium; subscribers will pay co-payments for doctor visits 
 and drugs. It will initially be available in about half of the 
 states, also starting next year. The policies will come with a 
 promise that United will stay in the market for at least two years.

Both insurers will have to meet quality benchmarks, 
 such as boosting the percentage of diabetics who get all recommended 
 treatments. If they don&apos;t hit those marks, they risk losing 
 incentive pay.

&quot;By tying carrier compensation to the health of our 
 members - we are on the leading edge of 
 health care reform,&quot;Dawn Sweeney, CEO of AARP Services, said in a 
 written statement.

Sweeney told reporters that AARP receives an average 
 of $185 million a year in royalty and revenue payments from health 
 insurance products it now offers. It currently has about 7 million 
 policyholders in a variety of programs, all offered by United. They 
 include Medicare prescription drug plans and supplemental insurance 
 that pays for some of the co-payments and deductibles that Medicare 
 does not cover.

AARP expects to double the number of people in its 
 branded products over the seven years and estimates it will garner 
 an additional $1.5 billion in royalty payments as a result.

The organization says it will spend the money on 
 ongoing lobbying efforts for health care reform and for measures to 
 improve seniors&apos; long-term financial security, and will spend $500 
 million on a new program to help people navigate the health care 
 system.

The move is a boost for United, which already is the 
 largest insurer offering Medicare prescription drug policies. It is 
 also a coup for Aetna, which gains access to the 18 million AARP 
 members who are ages 50 to 64.

&quot;By getting the younger members, they position 
 themselves for the future, because there&apos;s a good chance they will 
 stay with Aetna when they move into Medicare,&quot;says Dan Mendelson, 
 president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm in Washington.

Aetna may also gain some United customers. That&apos;s 
 because United currently offers an AARP-branded insurance policy to 
 about 28,000 people ages 50 to 64 in 24 states.

Those members will be offered a choice to switch to 
 an Aetna plan or stay with United, AARP said.
 
 












 

 AARP Says It Will Become Major Medicare Insurer While Remaining a 
 Consumer Lobby 
 By Robert Pear - New York Times
April 17, 2007 

 WASHINGTON, April 16 AARP, the 
 lobby for older Americans, announced Monday that it would become a 
 major participant in the nations health insurance market, offering 
 a health maintenance organization to Medicare recipients and several 
 other products to people 50 to 64 years old. 

 The products for people under 65 
 include a managed care plan, known as a preferred provider 
 organization, and a high-deductible insurance policy that could be 
 used with a health savings account. 

 When the new coverage becomes 
 available next year, AARP will be the largest provider of private 
 insurance to Medicare recipients. In addition to the new H.M.O., 
 AARP will continue providing prescription drug coverage and policies 
 to supplement Medicare, known as Medigap coverage. 

 William D. Novelli, the chief 
 executive of AARP, said, &quot; In launching 
 these initiatives, we are driven by our mission to create a 
 healthier America. &quot; 

 The group also said it would use its 
 leverage to reshape the health insurance market. The organization 
 has 38 million members, and Mr. Novelli said it hoped to have 50 
 million by 2011. 

 The new Medicare product will be 
 marketed with UnitedHealth Group. Policies for people under 65 will 
 carry the AARP name and will be marketed with Aetna. 

 Revenues and royalties from the sale 
 of goods and services have, for many years, accounted for a 
 substantial part of AARPs income. AARP officials insisted that its 
 financial interests do not affect the positions it takes on 
 Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and dozens of other issues on 
 which it lobbies and litigates. 

 Representative Pete Stark, Democrat 
 of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee 
 on health, welcomed AARP executives to the Medicare managed care 
 market. &quot; If they provide quality care at a 
 fair price, &quot; Mr. Stark said in an 
 interview, &quot; they could be a wonderful 
 addition. &quot; 

 But Judith A. Stein, director of the 
 Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group that counsels people 
 on Medicare, said, &quot;The new arrangements 
 with insurance companies create a tremendous number of potential 
 conflicts for AARP, which is a powerhouse, perceived as the most 
 important voice for older people. &quot; 

 The role of private insurers in 
 Medicare is one of the most hotly debated issues in American health 
 policy. In general, Republicans want to expand the role of private 
 insurers like UnitedHealth and Aetna, while Democrats want to limit 
 the role of private entities. 

 Ms. Stein and her organization work 
 closely with AARP. 

 &quot; AARP will 
 not be perceived as a truly independent advocate on Medicare if its 
 making hefty profits by selling insurance products that provide 
 Medicare coverage, &quot; Ms. Stein said. &quot; AARPs role in this market could give a 
 big boost to the privatization of Medicare. &quot; 

 AARP has opposed efforts to privatize 
 Medicare or Social Security. 

 Dawn M. Sweeney, president of AARP 
 Services Inc., the tax-paying business unit of AARP, said, &quot; We will use our collective market power 
 to negotiate &quot; competitive prices for the 
 new health insurance products. 

 AARP also said it would use $500 
 million of insurance sales revenue over the next decade to help 
 people navigate the health care system, with a new counseling 
 service. 

 Payments to UnitedHealth and Aetna 
 will be linked to their performance in improving the health of 
 subscribers, including members of minorities, Mr. Novelli said. The new plans will coordinate care for people 
 with chronic conditions and will develop special programs to treat 
 people with depression. AARP will measure how frequently the 
 companies deliver recommended treatments to people with diabetes, 
 hip fractures and other conditions. 

 Insurers typically sign one-year 
 contracts with Medicare. Ms. Sweeney said AARP &apos; s 
 H.M.O. was &quot; guaranteed to be in the 
 Medicare marketplace for two years, &quot; though premiums and co-payments could change after the first year. 

 People ages 50 to 64 often find that 
 health insurance is unavailable or unaffordable when they try to buy 
 it on their own. AARP said its underwriting practices would be less 
 stringent than those of many commercial insurers, but it reserved 
 the right to deny coverage to some sick people ages 50 to 64. 

 To guarantee issuance of a policy to 
 every applicant in that age group is &quot; just 
 not economically feasible, &quot; Ms. Sweeney 
 said. 

 About seven million people currently 
 have health insurance of various types, mainly drug coverage or 
 Medigap policies, carrying the AARP brand name. With the new 
 products, Ms. Sweeney estimated, the number will double to 14 
 million by 2014.
 

 

 AARP to 
 Offer Health Coverage To Wider Group 
 By Vanessa 
 Fuhrmans - Wall Street Journal
April 17, 2007 

 The powerful senior lobby AARP 
 announced an ambitious expansion in the health-care products it 
 markets to older Americans, targeting in particular the roughly 7 
 million who are still under the age of 65 and have no coverage. 

 As part of the expansion, the 38 
 million-member organization renewed and expanded a longstanding 
 contract with UnitedHealth Group Inc. to continue to sell 
 AARP-branded indemnity health plans, Medicare supplement policies 
 and drug benefit plans. It will also market private, comprehensive 
 Medicare plans, known as Medicare Advantage, under the AARP name. 
 The group also struck a new partnership with Aetna Inc. to design, 
 underwrite and administer a range of health plans for the under-65 
 set. 

 AARP says its move is an effort to 
 improve the health and to bring more affordable and stable health 
 care coverage to a population that increasingly finds it out of 
 reach. Unless they&apos;re covered by an employer, many Americans between 
 the ages of 50 and 64 find individual insurance either too expensive 
 or simply unavailable from health insurers eager to avoid customers 
 in declining health. 

 The deals also illustrate how 
 providing health care for older Americans has become a big business, 
 even as AARP tries to remain a consumer health advocate for its 
 members. 

 The deals are a coup for both 
 insurers, though Medicare still represents the much larger share of 
 the business. UnitedHealth&apos;s existing partnership with AARP has 
 already helped make it the largest seller of Medicare products, and 
 generates roughly $5 billion in annual revenue just from selling 
 Medicare supplement plans. For the first time, though, the insurers&apos; 
 income will also be tied to whether they improve the health care of 
 plan members, provide easy-to-read policy materials and reach 
 certain benchmarks in corporate governance, responsibility and 
 diversity, AARP said. 

 AARP executives say the deals will 
 help them reach their target of providing health insurance products 
 to roughly 14 million people by 2014, up from 7 million today. 
 Through its new and expanded partnerships with Aetna and 
 UnitedHealth, AARP expects to generate some $4.4 billion in health 
 care-related royalties over the next seven years, $1.5 billion more 
 than its previous projections. AARP&apos;s CEO, Bill Novelli, said much 
 of the money would be ploughed back into other health care access 
 and affordability initiatives. 

 AARP&apos;s scale would help keep a lid on 
 the new plans&apos; costs, executives said. 

 Although Aetna would still 
 underwrite, or price premiums individually based on a customer&apos;s 
 health and demographics, it would be required to take a more 
 flexible approach than many commercial insurers currently do. 
 Members who bought the plans also would have access to disease 
 management programs and other tools designed to monitor and improve 
 chronic conditions such as diabetes - and 
 which are typically only available through an employer group plan. 

 Likewise in the Medicare realm, 
 UnitedHealth will be required to commit to providing AARP-branded 
 Medicare Advantage plans in a given market for at least two years. 
 Federal law requires insurers to stick to providing the plans a 
 minimum one year. 

 AARP said the plans would become 
 available at the beginning of 2008.

 Wal-Mart regains 
 &apos;Fortune&apos; top spot 
 By Mindy Fetterman, USA 
 TODAY
April 16, 2007 

 The Fortune 500 ranking of the 
 biggest U.S. companies is out Monday. But the story this year isn&apos;t 
 the size of companies, which is based on revenue. It&apos;s the size of their profits. 

 Fortune magazine, which has been 
 tracking corporate revenue and profit for 53 years, says that U.S. companies are enjoying&quot;the most 
 sumptuously profitable period&quot;in the history of its list. 

 Profits for the Fortune 500 jumped 
 29% in 2006 to $785 billion, far above the previous peak of $444 
 billion at the height of the dot-com boom in 2000. 

 &quot;That&apos;s an awesome number,&quot;managing 
 editor Andy Serwer says.&quot;It&apos;s really been the most incredibly 
 benign business environment imaginable.&quot;Total revenue for the 500 
 was $9.9 trillion, up 8.9% 

 Corporate profits in 2006 were the 
 result of a&quot;harmonious convergence, a perfect economic calm,&quot;the 
 magazine said. 

 Labor costs were low; the dollar was 
 falling (which made products sold overseas more profitable for 
 U.S.-based companies); and productivity was soaring. The good times 
 were part of a trend: For the years 2000 to 2006, the number of 
 workers employed by Fortune 500 companies rose 3.6%, but 
 productivity led profits to rise almost 80%. 

 Wal-Mart (WMT) again became the 
 largest corporation, based on revenue. It beat out its big-company 
 rival, oil giant ExxonMobil. Wal-Mart had been No. 1 on the list since 2002, but ExxonMobil was first last year. 

 Wal-Mart had 2006 revenue of $351.1 
 billion, up 11.2%. ExxonMobil had 2006 revenue of $347.3 billion. 
 Exxon still remains the most profitable U.S. company. 

 Rapid profit growth is&quot;probably not 
 sustainable,&quot;says Serwer, because interest rates may rise and there 
 will be pressure for wages to rise, too. Wages have grown only as fast as inflation for years, he says.&quot;Employees have an absolute right now to say, &apos;Hey, what about us?&apos;&quot; 

 Also on the list: 

 Oil companies held three of the top 
 five spots as ConocoPhillips (COP) bumped Ford Motor (F) out of No. 
 5. 

 US Airways (LCC) was the biggest 
 gainer on the list, up 208 spots to No. 216. Avis (CAR) fell the most, down 291 spots to No. 405. 

 Of 74 industry groups in the list, 
 only two - automotive retailing and motor 
 vehicles and parts - lost money in 2006. 

 The fastest-growing industries by 
 revenue growth were securities, oil and gas equipment, and Internet 
 services and retailing. 

 The most-profitable companies were 
 ExxonMobil (XOM), United Airlines parent UAL (UAUA), Citigroup (C), 
 Bank of America (BAC) and General Electric (GE). 

 There were 24 female and 10 
 African-American CEOs.
 

 

 Macy&apos;s to invest $100M to build online store operation 
 The Business Journal of Milwaukee
April 16, 2007 

 Federated Department Stores, the 
 Cincinnati-based parent to Macy&apos;s and Bloomingdale&apos;s, will invest 
 $100 million in its online operations with a goal of $1 billion in 
 online sales next year. 

 Macys.com is headquartered in San 
 Francisco, the technical hub, and New York, the merchandising 
 center, with the division&apos;s 350 employees split between them. 
 Macys.com CEO Kent Anderson is based in San Francisco. 

 Most of the $100 million will be 
 spent on a 600,000-square-foot distribution center in Goodyear, 
 Ariz., that will be the main West Coast shipping point for 
 Macys.com. Construction will begin this spring and take a year. 

 Some will be spent in San Francisco 
 to support technical upgrades and infrastructure improvements. It is 
 on top of $130 million being invested in such improvements in 
 2006-2007, including a 600,000-square-foot distribution center 
 opening this month in Portland, Tenn. 

 &quot;Research has certainly demonstrated 
 that a customer who shops both online and in stores is a much larger 
 customer,&quot;said Jim Sluzewski, a Federated spokesman. He said a goal 
 for the company now is to encourage in-store shoppers to begin 
 research online at home and online shoppers to come in and browse 
 before clicking and buying. 

 Macys.com is not alone in choosing 
 the Bay Area, with its deep technical talent, for its web 
 operations. Wal-Mart put Arkansas on the retail map, but Walmart.com 
 is in Brisbane. 

 Federated&apos;s online sales were $620 
 million last year, up from $450 million in 2005. Those include sales 
 from Bloomingdale&apos;s.com and Bloomingdale&apos;s by Mail, but the bulk of 
 the direct business comes from Macys.com. Federated declined to 
 break out specific figures for Macys.com, but said the site 
 attracted up to 280 million visitors last year. 

 Macys.com is a separate operation 
 from Macy&apos;s West, based in San Francisco and headed by Robert 
 Mettler. Macy&apos;s West includes 190 stores. Macy&apos;s has one 
 Milwaukee-area store at Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa.
 

 

 Wal-Mart&apos;s Firing Of a Security Aide Bites the Firm Back 
 By Ann Zimmerman and 
 Gary McWilliams Wall Street Journal
April 9, 2007 

 He Knew of &apos;Project Red,&apos;
Secret Plan Mulling Ideas Like a Sam&apos;s Club Spinoff 

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is embroiled in 
 a messy fight with a security engineer whom it fired last month -- 
 but who it now fears left with information about a secret plan to 
 boost the giant retailer&apos;s lagging stock price. 

 The program, called&quot;Project Red,&quot;included a consideration of, among other ideas, a possible spinoff 
 of Wal-Mart&apos;s Sam&apos;s Club warehouse-store unit. 

 So secret was Project Red that its 
 reports were encrypted, and consultants who worked on it last fall 
 toiled in a locked office that was swept for electronic bugs. But 
 this weekend, it turned out that computer hard drives Wal-Mart 
 believes contain Project Red information were in the car of the wife 
 of Bruce Gabbard, a security engineer Wal-Mart had once entrusted 
 with guarding its secrets. The company fired him early last month 
 for taping calls between a Wal-Mart executive and a New York Times 
 reporter. 

 On Saturday, Mr. Gabbard&apos;s attorneys 
 were eventually able to reach the security engineer&apos;s wife and the 
 hard drives were delivered to the Benton County, Ark., prosecutor&apos;s 
 office. As of yesterday, Bentonville-based Wal-Mart had not yet 
 retrieved them.
 

 On Friday, Wal-Mart sued Mr. Gabbard, 
 accusing him of leaking trade secrets in articles published in The 
 Wall Street Journal. The suit in Benton County circuit court said 
 Mr. Gabbard possessed&quot;highly confidential information about 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s strategic planning,&quot;an apparent reference to Project 
 Red. A judge granted a temporary restraining order barring Mr. 
 Gabbard from disclosing confidential information. 

 Wal-Mart wouldn&apos;t comment on any 
 specifics of Project Red. In a statement, it said:&quot;Our senior 
 management, our board and their advisors regularly conduct thorough, 
 strategic reviews of all aspects of our business. That&apos;s just good 
 governance. We look at a full range of alternatives, many of which 
 are considered and rejected, and we will not comment specifically on 
 any of them.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart, long widely admired as a 
 smooth-running retail machine, lately has been on the defensive over 
 its labor policies, health benefits and stock price. Its shares are 
 off 20% over the past five years, versus a 75% gain for rival Target 
 Corp. Though Wal-Mart remains robustly profitable -- earning $11.28 
 billion last year -- some investors are clamoring for it to take 
 radical steps to become even more so. 

 Some episodes at the company have had 
 the flavor of a corporate soap opera. A former vice chairman pleaded 
 guilty last year to fraud and tax evasion related to using company 
 funds for custom-made alligator boots and a dog kennel, among other 
 things. He had said he was reimbursing himself for payments he made 
 to help keep unions out of Wal-Mart. In December, Wal-Mart fired a 
 senior marketing executive, saying she had had a personal 
 relationship with a subordinate and accepted gifts such as pricy 
 vodka from a vendor. When she sued, Wal-Mart filed in court what it 
 said were suggestive emails. 

 Mr. Gabbard, a 44-year-old Marine 
 Corps veteran and former reserve deputy sheriff, spent 19 years at 
 Wal-Mart, the last few in the Threat Research and Assessment Group. 
 The team hunted computer hackers outside the company and regularly 
 searched emails and monitored phones looking for misbehavior or 
 leaks. It worked in a highly secure area nicknamed the Bat Cave. 

 Mr. Gabbard says he was tasked with 
 the electronic monitoring of directors&apos; meetings, in a hunt for 
 anyone who might be spying on them. This gave him unusual access to 
 information. He says that two years ago, while manning a 
 countersurveillance desk during a board meeting in Puerto Rico, he 
 listened as directors debated a multibillion-dollar settlement offer 
 in a big lawsuit alleging sex bias in pay and promotions. The board 
 voted to reject it for several reasons, including the bad publicity 
 it would generate, Mr. Gabbard said in an interview in late March. 
 Wal-Mart declined to comment. 

 Mr. Gabbard was part of the security 
 team for Project Red. Wal-Mart hired two teams of McKinsey&amp;Co. 
 consultants, so neither could have a full grasp of the project. 
 Cameras inside a room recorded their activities, according to Mr. 
 Gabbard. The security team was responsible for encrypting data and 
 reports and for creating passwords to keep the work under electronic 
 lock and key. The project, involving heads of domestic and overseas 
 units, finance, legal, procurement and a firm that manages money for 
 the founding Walton family, finished late last year, an internal 
 document shows. McKinsey declined to comment, citing client 
 confidentiality. 

 In January, an outside attorney for 
 Wal-Mart questioned Mr. Gabbard and some colleagues about 
 unauthorized taping of phone calls between a Times reporter and Mona 
 Williams, Wal-Mart vice president of corporate communications. Mr. 
 Gabbard says he was asked what gave him the right to eavesdrop on a 
 vice president&apos;s conversation. He says he replied:&quot;I&apos;m the guy 
 listening to the board of directors when Lee Scott is excused from 
 the room,&quot;referring to the Wal-Mart chief executive. He says the 
 lawyer dropped the topic. 

 But Wal-Mart put Mr. Gabbard on paid 
 leave as an outside forensics team investigated his group&apos;s 
 activities. The team came across a project -- which Mr. Gabbard 
 maintains was authorized -- in which he intercepted workers&apos; pager 
 messages containing sensitive information. Because the pager 
 frequency isn&apos;t secure, he also intercepted outsiders&apos; calls. 

 Mr. Gabbard returned to work in 
 mid-February and got a written rebuke for using bad judgment in 
 taping a reporter&apos;s calls without authorization. No contention was 
 made that the taping was illegal. About two weeks later, Wal-Mart 
 fired him and said the U.S. attorney for the Western District of 
 Arkansas was investigating possible violations of law. U.S. Attorney 
 Bob Balfe yesterday said he was reviewing the latest allegations and 
 declined further comment. 

 Mr. Gabbard admits he wasn&apos;t 
 authorized to record calls with a reporter. He says he felt 
 pressured to find the source of leaks that painted Wal-Mart in an 
 unflattering light, and felt betrayed by his public dismissal.&quot;When 
 Wal-Mart fired me and went public with it, I felt it was character 
 assassination. They were trying to make me look like I was a whack 
 job and they were taking the moral high ground,&quot;Mr. Gabbard says. 

 In a Journal story on Wednesday, Mr. 
 Gabbard outlined the breadth of his group&apos;s activities. The article 
 said his group&apos;s activities included sending an undercover operative 
 wearing a microphone to spy on a protest group that planned to 
 attend the 2006 annual meeting. 

 In a recent email, Mr. Gabbard said 
 he was&quot;going underground&quot;as a result of the furor created by that 
 article. An attorney for him, W.H. Taylor, yesterday said a 
 three-hour meeting he had with Wal-Mart on Saturday was&quot;very 
 congenial.&quot;Declining to give specifics, the lawyer added,&quot;I&apos;m 
 hopeful I can negotiate an end to it.&quot; 

 It isn&apos;t clear why Mr. Gabbard was 
 willing to talk to reporters about Project Red. But he recently said 
 that rather than splitting itself up to increase the stock price, in 
 his view Wal-Mart should return to founder Sam Walton&apos;s values of&quot;customer service and respect for the individual.&quot; 

 Wal-Mart initially suspected Mr. 
 Gabbard knew more about Project Red than he should when he turned 
 his laptop in after he was fired. It contained references to the 
 project. Mr. Gabbard&apos;s job was to make sure the information was 
 secure, but not to look at it. 

 But Wal-Mart took no action until 
 this weekend, after the Journal started asking questions about 
 Project Red. Wal-Mart outside counsel Marshall Ney met Saturday with 
 Mr. Gabbard&apos;s attorney and learned that the former employee had two 
 disk-drives containing Wal-Mart material -- which had been double 
 and triple encrypted to prevent access.
 

 

 Quietly, Retail Executives Move Into Top Paydays 
 By Michael Barbaro and Eric Dash - 
 New York Times
April 8, 2007 

 THE richest paydays are supposed to 
 be reserved for Wall Street titans, oil barons and banking moguls. 
 So what is a handbag maker doing atop the list? 

 Lew Frankfort, 
 61, the chief executive of Coach, earned $44.4 million last year, 
 putting him in the same league as the chiefs at much bigger 
 companies, like Goldman Sachs and Occidental Petroleum. In fact, his 
 pay was about twice as much as the head of Citigroup, the financial 
 giant. 

 Mr. Frankfort, a raspy-voiced, 
 straight-talking former New York mayoral aide, may be the highest 
 paid C.E.O. off Wall Street, edging out top executives at AT&amp;T, Walt 
 Disney and United Airlines. 

 Heres the unusual part: almost 
 nobody objects. Over the last five years, under Mr. Frankforts 
 leadership, Coachs earnings rose to $494 million from $64 million and its stock price jumped to $51 from $6. Coach 
 also developed a cult-like following among fans of cushy items like 
 leather iPod covers and key fobs. 

 Given a soaring stock price and an 
 enviable line of products, Mr. Frankfort is unapologetic about 
 hauling in tens of millions of dollars. &quot; I 
 believe that my role as the visionary and the leader is worth &quot; the pay, he said in an interview. &quot; Absolutely - I do not feel uncomfortable with it. &quot; 

 The retail industry - teeming with deep-discount pitches and 
 minimum-wage-earning sales clerks - is not 
 known for sky-high pay. But perhaps it should be. 

 Last year, Paul S. Pressler, the 
 ousted chief executive of Gap, was paid $15.4 million. Ralph Lauren, chief executive of Polo Ralph Lauren, 
 took home $22.7 million. Alan J. Lacy, 
 then the chief executive of Sears Holdings, received $23.2 million. 
 And Robert L. Nardelli, the ex-chief executive of Home Depot, 
 pocketed $36.5 million - a figure that, 
 albeit lower than Mr. Frankfort &apos; s 
 pay, helped usher Mr. Nardelli out the door. Perhaps only the former 
 Gap chief Millard S. Drexler, who now runs J. Crew, earned more than 
 Mr. Frankfort - an estimated $300 million 
 over the last four years. But that compensation was granted when 
 private equity firms owned J. Crew. 

 For years, these pay packages have 
 largely flown below the radar - and 
 surveys of the top-paid chief executives - because of a calendar quirk. Most retail and fashion companies file 
 data about their chief &apos; s pay in April and 
 May, a month later than most other companies do, so they can 
 incorporate results from the holiday selling season, when they do 
 the bulk of their business. 

 But an analysis prepared for Sunday 
 Business by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm, shows 
 that the paychecks sent to chief executives of several retail and 
 fashion companies are among the richest in American business. And 
 few are fatter than Mr. Frankforts. 

 His $44.4 million compensation in 
 fiscal 2006 equaled 9 percent of Coachs income a figure that 
 dwarfs those at the companys peers, inside and outside of the 
 retail industry. H. Lee Scott Jr., the chief executive of Wal-Mart, 
 was paid $15.7 million, or 0.1 percent of the company &apos; s 
 income, while E. Stanley ONeal, the chief executive of Merrill 
 Lynch, received $35.5 million, or 0.7 
 percent of the fir m&apos; s income. 

 But neither chief executive can match 
 Mr. Frankforts track record. Since 1995, when he became C.E.O., he 
 has transformed Coach, once a niche player, into an international 
 megabrand peddling luxury leather purses, flip-flops and backpacks. 
 He also pioneered an entirely new retailing category, known as 
 affordable luxury. 

 It was Coach, after all, that made it 
 permissible, if not compulsory, for women to own not just one $250 
 handbag but several. &quot; We created a lane 
 between moderate and luxury brands and that lane has become a super 
 highway, &quot; Mr. Frankfort said. 

 Since October 2000, when Coach, once 
 a division of the Sara Lee Corporation, went public, Mr. Frankfort 
 has added $18 billion to the companys market capitalization. 
 Indeed, $10,000 invested in Coach stock in 2000 is worth $255,000 
 today. 

 Coachs board rewarded Mr. Frankfort 
 with stock options, which comprise the vast majority of his 
 compensation. Last year, his base salary was just $972,000, his 
 bonus $1.9 million. But he got stock options valued at $40.3 
 million. 

 One reason his pay was so high: Mr. 
 Frankfort is still benefiting from so-called &quot; reload 
 options, &quot; which the company automatically 
 grants to replace cashed-out options. Coach stopped granting new 
 options that reload several years ago, but he still receives extra 
 shares from older options that have this feature. 

 Mr. Frankfort said that the 
 arrangement, tying more than 90 percent of his pay to the stocks 
 performance, has rewarded investors handsomely. If the stock price 
 did not go up, I would be in the bottom quartile of chief executive 
 pay, he pointed out. 

 Patricia Edwards, an executive at 
 Wentworth, Hauser&amp;Violich, an investment firm that owns Coach 
 shares, and a vocal critic of Mr. Nardelli &apos; s 
 pay at Home Depot, has no qualms about Mr. Frankfort &apos; s 
 pay. &quot; Coach stock was through the roof 
 last year, &quot; she said, &quot; Shouldn &apos; t 
 he be rewarded for that? &quot;. 

 As his pay has escalated, and he has 
 watched peers pilloried for lavish compensation, Mr. Frankfort has 
 repeatedly asked his staff if investors have complained. The answer: 
 nope. &quot; I am actually enraged when people 
 get rewarded and they do not deserve it, &quot; he said. 

 He does not put himself in that 
 category. &quot; I got a standing ovation from 
 our shareholders, &quot; at last years annual 
 meeting, he said, &quot; They have been quite 
 well rewarded. &quot;
 
  

 

 New Urgency in 
 Debating Health Care 
 By Milt Freudenheim 
 - New York Times
April 6, 2007 

 Since Hillary Rodham Clinton &apos; s 
 effort to overhaul the nations medical system was rejected in 1994, 
 most big employers have stayed out of the debate on health care 
 reform. 

 But with their medical costs 
 ballooning, top executives of large companies are starting to speak 
 up again and many are calling for a national approach to fixing 
 health care. Few advocate a wholesale shift to government-directed 
 medicine, but most are seeking broad changes in the 
 employer-subsidized health system, which they regard as 
 unsustainable in its current form. 

 Business executives are motivated in 
 large part by health insurance premiums that are rising much faster 
 than inflation, adding to their costs at a time when many are facing 
 more intense competition from abroad, where companies rely on 
 government-supported health care systems largely financed by taxes. A 2006 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt 
 Associates found that premiums in the United States had risen about 
 87 percent since 2000. 

 &quot; Five 
 years from now this problem will have to be cured, or the 
 competitiveness of the United States will be dramatically affected, &quot; said J. Randall MacDonald, senior vice 
 president for human resources at I.B.M. 

 But companies are by no means 
 speaking with one voice. Everybody &apos; s 
 problem - the growing cost of health 
 coverage can be felt differently depending on the size of a 
 company and whether it has promised health benefits to retirees. 

 Older companies, for example, are 
 more likely to welcome government help on coverage for workers who 
 leave before they are eligible for Medicare and may find they cannot 
 afford insurance. But Silicon Valley technology companies that do 
 not have or need retiree coverage are wary of new taxpayer-financed 
 subsidies. 

 The health care debate is heating up 
 as candidates polish their positions for next years presidential 
 primaries, and as Democrats in Congress assert their newfound power. 

 In general, employers &quot; are more interested in reform today than 
 at any time since the Clinton effort &quot; in 
 the early 1990s, said Robert S. Galvin, global health care and 
 policy director at General Electric, which provides health benefits 
 for 460,000 employees and dependents and 240,000 retirees and 
 dependents. 

 The surge of interest, Mr. Galvin 
 said, &quot; is driven by compounding health cost 
 increases at three times the general inflation rate, plus the 
 entrance of Wal-Mart and other retailers &quot; that are beginning to feel the pain of out-of-control increases in 
 costs. 

 Wal-Mart Stores introduced lower-cost 
 coverage for its huge work force last year, after state officials 
 and editorial writers criticized the numbers of Wal-Mart employees 
 on state Medicaid rolls. 

 Many retailers, with large staffs of 
 low-paid, temporary and part-time workers, would welcome a larger 
 government role. 

 &quot; The 
 way it &apos; s going, there will be 75 million 
 uninsured in another 10 years, &quot; said James D. Sinegal, chief executive of Costco Wholesale, which 
 subsidizes health care for 81,000 of its 100,000 workers in the 
 United States. &quot; The federal government has 
 to lend some assistance. &quot; 

 Mr. Sinegal said he had agreed to 
 support an unlikely coalition of businesses and labor unions that 
 recently called for &quot; achieving a new American health care 
 system by 2012. &quot; The group, the Better Health Care Together campaign, includes 
 Wal-Mart, AT&amp;T, Intel and Kelly Services, the temporary-staffing 
 company, as well as the Service Employees International Union and 
 the Communications Workers of America. 

 &quot; The 
 system is going to break, &quot; warned Carl T. Camden, president and chief executive of Kelly 
 Services. &quot; You can only put so many 
 uninsured people through the emergency rooms before employers stop 
 offering coverage. &quot; 

 Indeed, a bill proposed by Senator 
 Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would scale back the role of 
 employers while requiring individuals and companies to share in the 
 costs. President Bushs proposal would treat high-cost health care 
 plans paid by employers as wages subject to income tax, and would 
 also offer a new tax deduction to people who buy insurance on their 
 own. 

 Economists say that employers would 
 raise wages if they did not have to pay for employee health care. 
 The Treasury would stand to gain $140 billion a year in personal 
 income taxes if the benefits were treated as wages, said Len Burman, 
 director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. There would be about $70 billion more in additional payroll taxes 
 due on those wages, he said. 

 But taxes would have to go up to keep 
 the health care system functioning. 

 Leslie Dach, executive vice president 
 for corporate affairs and government relations at Wal-Mart, said 
 that the company &apos; s &quot; message to elected officials is: &quot; The time to act is now. &quot; Mr. Dach, a public relations specialist based in Washington and a 
 frequent adviser to Democratic presidential candidates, joined 
 Wal-Mart last year. 

 While employers generally agree that 
 steps must be taken to control health care costs, they are divided 
 over whether or not the solutions should come from the government. 

 &quot; That 
 is the elephant in the room, &quot; said Mr. Galvin of General Electric. 

 Craig R. Barrett, the chairman of 
 Intel, another participant in the Better Health Care Together 
 campaign, is skeptical about a new government role. He said the 
 private sector could do the best job at improving efficiency in the 
 system. 

 Corporate purchasers could use their 
 buying power, he said, to insist on technological aids like 
 electronic prescriptions, remote monitoring of patients with chronic 
 illnesses and electronic health records for Americans. 

 Companies like General Motors argue 
 that government agencies, which spend about half of the $2 trillion 
 in annual health spending, should join with employers in pushing for 
 changes to lower costs. 

 &quot; Working 
 with the government as a fellow purchaser can accomplish a great 
 deal to help improve our health care system, &quot; said Bruce E. Bradley, director of health care strategy and public 
 policy at G.M., which provides health care for 1.1 million people, 
 including more than 500,000 retirees and their spouses. 

 Michael J. Critelli, chairman of 
 Pitney Bowes, the business services company, says he backs changes 
 that emphasize preventive medicine. &quot; Any 
 health plan, whether employer, government or private insurance needs 
 to invest its most significant dollars in incentives for people to 
 take good care of themselves, &quot; he said. 

 He added: &quot; The 
 spiraling cost of health care is a result of an explosive growth in 
 chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and 
 asthma. The health care debate needs to be focused on the core 
 issue: making Americans healthier. &quot; 

 By providing clinics, exercise and 
 other wellness programs as well as low-cost or free drugs for 
 certain types of patients, he said, annual cost increases for Pitney 
 Bowes employees have fallen into the low single digits over the last 
 15 years. That is well below the double-digit percentage increases 
 that many companies have experienced. 

 Neither G.M. nor Wal-Mart favors a 
 government-based central payer system. But 
 older companies and their unions are very interested in 
 Congressional measures that would allow early retirees under age 65 
 to qualify for Medicare or to buy into the Medicare program, with 
 help from their former employers, said Alan Reuther, legislative 
 director of the United Automobile Workers. 

 General Motors has far different 
 concerns, of course, than Wal-Mart, a retailer that covers more than 
 one million employees and dependents in the United States but does 
 not provide a retiree health benefit. 

 Another set of issues divides large 
 companies from small businesses, which employ 50 percent of working 
 Americans. Their owners worry that in some states they may be forced 
 to spend for coverage of young workers with little interest in 
 health coverage. 

 &quot; The 
 premium keeps going up and, even worse, the insurance companies keep 
 decreasing the benefits, &quot; said Steve Caughran, who owns three small companies in Fresno, 
 Calif. One, a Quiznos fast-food restaurant, has 14 uninsured high 
 school and college students who work part time. 

 Requiring employers to cover workers 
 who lack health insurance will hardly correct the forces pushing up 
 costs, like expensive new drugs, insurance fraud and inefficient 
 state programs, Mr. Caughran argues. 

 Mr. Camden of Kelly Services notes 
 that the majority of the 45 million Americans who do not have health 
 insurance have jobs. He argues that many of these workers are 
 essential to keeping the United States economy competitive. 

 &quot; In the 
 next decade or two, manufacturing is going to steadily decline, &quot; he said. &quot; Employment will come from the 
 entrepreneurial, scientific parts of the economy, &quot; including many who work as independent contractors and temporary 
 employees. 

 Part of the solution should be to &quot; separate health care from employer sponsorship, &quot; Mr. Camden said. &quot; The employer-provided 
 health care system is just dead, although some people haven &apos; t 
 recognized it as dead yet. &quot; 

 Similarly, Andrew L. Stern, president 
 of the Service Employees International Union, criticizes the current 
 employer-sponsored system as &quot; a relic of 
 the industrial economy. &quot; 

 Mr. Camden listed possible remedies 
 as an &quot; employment-based &quot; withholding tax, matched by employers as in Social Security, with 
 Medicare and Medicaid expanded to cover the unemployed. 

 But most big companies are not ready 
 to give up on their health care obligations. &quot; Regardless 
 of who takes the lead, we collectively as a national society have to 
 consolidate around three or four different ideas, &quot; Mr. MacDonald of I.B.M. said. 

 He called for a national debate on 
 such topics as maintaining existing employer-subsidized health care, 
 with &quot; some level of umbrella coverage over 
 that, some level of a single payer system. &quot; 

 &quot; A 
 lot of positioning is going on now, &quot; he said. &quot; The reality is that changes are 
 inevitable, I think sooner rather than later. &quot;
 

 

 The New Alchemy At Sears 
 By Robert Berner - Finance 
 - Business Week
April 16, 2007 issue 

 It has quietly created $1.8 billion 
 in securities based on Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard 

 Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD ) Chairman 
 Edward S. Lampert talks lovingly of his plans to reinvent Sears and 
 Kmart Corp. (SHLD ) He makes great theater out of his surprise 
 visits to stores to check out the displays of power tools and the 
 length of the checkout lines. The stock analysts who cover the 
 Hoffman Estates (Ill.) giant follow his lead in counting foot 
 traffic and poring over profit margin data. 

 But much of the real action at Sears 
 is taking place far from the retail front lines, on a theoretical 
 plane where few have traveled before. Sears is on the cutting edge 
 of a financial innovation so important that it could unlock 
 trillions of dollars in capital across Corporate America and change 
 the way managers of a wide range of businesses think about their 
 balance sheets. 

 BusinessWeek has learned that Sears 
 has created $1.8 billion worth of securities based on the brand 
 names Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard. In essence, it has 
 transferred ownership of the brands to another entity, which it then 
 pays for the right to use the brands. The deal, carried off last 
 May, was the biggest&quot;securitization&quot;of intellectual property in 
 history, according to Eric Hedman, an analyst at Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s 
 (MHP ), which, like BusinessWeek, is a unit of The McGraw-Hill 
 Companies. (MHP ) The story hasn&apos;t gotten out until now because the 
 bonds haven&apos;t actually changed hands Sears is holding them in its Bermuda-based insurance subsidiary - and because Sears has never disclosed them, nor has it had to 
 do so. But that could change if Sears were to decide to sell them to 
 outside investors and collect the cash. 

 Such daring shouldn&apos;t come as a 
 surprise at a Lampert-run shop. When he looks at a company, he sees 
 value hidden from plain view value that 
 traditional accounting methods often miss. That keen eye is what 
 prompted him to buy up a majority of Kmart&apos;s bonds at a deep 
 discount after it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002. He saw 
 that Kmart&apos;s real estate was deeply undervalued by creditors, and 
 figured that would protect his investment. He was right. 

 Now, Sears could be on the cusp of 
 turning a much squishier asset, intellectual property, into actual 
 cash. Don Davis, managing director and general counsel at Commercial 
 Strategy, a Boston intellectual property consulting firm, says the 
 potential for a market in bonds backed by intangible assets could be 
 even bigger than the market for junk bonds, given that 70% to 80% of 
 the total value of the stock market rests on intangibles such as 
 intellectual property.&quot;The scale is astounding,&quot;he says. 

 But if Sears opens the floodgates for 
 a new market, things could get messy.
Junk bonds caused plenty of upheaval when the debt market turned 
 ugly in the late 1980s. Sears&apos; brand bonds are worrisome in one 
 sense, say securitization lawyers and accountants: The company has 
 put the ownership of its three core brands out of the reach of 
 existing bondholders if the retailer ever ends up in bankruptcy.&quot;Lampert has mortgaged Sears&apos; crown jewels,&quot;says Thomas Lys, an 
 accounting professor at Northwestern University. Sears, through a 
 spokesman, says the bonds&apos; only purpose is to provide liquidity in 
 the coffers of its insurance subsidiary to offset any potential 
 losses there. It also says Lampert had nothing to do with the 
 transaction but was briefed on it. And it says Sears&apos; outstanding 
 debt is small relative to the company&apos;s total value and is less than 
 the cash it has on hand. Lampert declined to comment. 

 FROM WHOLE CLOTH 

 The journey to figure out what&apos;s 
 going on inside Sears&apos; inner sanctum starts with some footnotes 
 buried deep in financial filings. Sears has disclosed that it has 
 created a&quot;separate, wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary&quot; essentially a company within a company. Called KCD IP (for 
 Kenmore Craftsman DieHard intellectual property), the entity has 
 issued $1.8 billion worth of bonds backed by the intellectual 
 property of Sears&apos; three biggest brands, according to filings with 
 the Patent&amp;Trademark Office. 

 Sears has, in essence, created 
 licensing income from whole cloth. First it transferred ownership of 
 the brand names into KCD. Now, KCD charges Sears royalty fees to 
 license those brands and uses the royalties to pay the interest on 
 the bonds. It has sold the bonds to the insurance subsidiary, where, 
 like any other security on an insurer&apos;s books, it serves as 
 protection against future loss. The insurer, meanwhile, protects 
 Sears from financial trouble and because 
 it&apos;s a subsidiary, it does so at a lower cost than Sears could get 
 from an outside party. 

 If you&apos;re confused, that&apos;s because 
 it&apos;s all circular: The payments net out to zero because Sears owns 
 every piece. But that would change if Sears were to sell the bonds 
 to outsiders. Then voil, Sears would be 
 holding up to $1.8 billion in cash, and 
 investors would be holding the bonds. 

 Intellectual property bonds got their 
 start with an unlikely financier: David 
 Bowie. The rock star floated $55 million worth in 1997, backed by 
 300 song titles, with the interest covered by royalty payments from 
 the songs. Since then, some 30 other deals 
 have been struck. Film studios have issued bonds backed by future 
 revenue streams. Designers such as Bill Blass (NEXC ) and retailers 
 such BCBG Max Azria Group Inc. have issued bonds backed by outside 
 licensing fees. And restaurant chains such as Arby&apos;s Restaurant 
 Group (TRY ) have issued bonds against outside franchising fees. 

 Sears&apos; KCD deal is different in one 
 important way: It didn&apos;t involve preexisting royalty payments. The 
 company created the payments in order to issue the bonds. Richard D. 
 Rudder, a New York lawyer who specializes in securitization of 
 intellectual property and consulted on the KCD deal, says it&apos;s the 
 first deal he has seen that hasn&apos;t involved cash coming in from the 
 outside. In filings, Sears has suggested it could potentially 
 license the trademarks to other parties - for example, to another company to make a new line of Craftsman 
 products - although it hasn&apos;t done so yet. Sears declined to comment 
 beyond what it has said in those filings. 

 The KCD bonds have a higher credit 
 rating than Sears&apos; regular bonds. Moody&apos;s Investors Service (MCO ) 
 has given KCD an investment-grade rating of Baa2, four rungs better 
 than Sears&apos; junk rating of Ba1. How so? If Sears were to go 
 bankrupt, regular bondholders wouldn&apos;t be able to get their hands on 
 the Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard trademarks, the company&apos;s crown 
 jewels. They would go instead to the insurer. Sears says there is 
 nothing unusual about securitizing assets; many companies, including 
 most of the largest retailers, evaluate alternatives to create value 
 from their brands, real estate, and other assets. 

 Getting details on the bond offering 
 isn&apos;t easy. Moody&apos;s issued a detailed report dated May 18, 2006, and 
 a press release with few specifics dated May 19. The detailed report 
 was listed on Alacra.com, a seller of financial research, as 
 recently as Feb. 8, at a cost of $700. When BusinessWeek tried to 
 obtain the report from Moody&apos;s, the rating agency said it didn&apos;t 
 exist. &quot;No additional information is 
 available,&quot;says Moody&apos;s spokesman Michael N. Adler. Alacra no longer shows the report on its site.&quot;It was 
 pulled,&quot;says Carol Ann Thomas, head of marketing at Alacra.&quot;It is 
 very, very unusual. I only know that from our management.&quot; 

 SETTING A 
 PRECEDENT 

 Most companies that&quot;securitize&quot;assets sell the bonds immediately to get the proceeds. Sears says it 
 created the brand bonds for its Bermuda insurance company to hold in 
 its coffers as protection should the insurer suddenly face trouble. 
 In fact, it says the majority of the insurer&apos;s assets are made up of 
 bonds issued by Sears&apos; own subsidiaries. But insurers typically hold 
 investment-grade securities unrelated to their company or their 
 parent. To use the bonds of its own company to meet Bermudan 
 regulatory standards, Sears would have to get special permission 
 from the Bermuda Monetary Authority, says Shelby Weldon, the BMA&apos;s 
 director of insurance compliance. As to whether the BMA has ever 
 allowed an insurer to hold a majority of such bonds,&quot;I have never 
 seen it,&quot;says Richard J. Irwin, a partner 
 and insurance expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers&apos; Bermuda office. Nor 
 has Andy McComb, president of Bermuda&apos;s Allegro Insurance&amp;Risk 
 Management Ltd. The BMA declined comment on Sears. Sears says only 
 that it has obtained all necessary regulatory approvals. 

 In theory, there are plenty of things 
 Sears could do with its fresh source of capital besides using it to 
 strengthen its insurance subsidiary. Obviously, it could sell them and use the proceeds to pay down debt 
 or buy a company. It could even trade them for the debt of another 
 company say the revolving credit line of 
 another retailer.&quot;Gap Inc. (GPS ) could wake up one morning and 
 have Eddie Lampert as its lender,&quot;says Commercial Strategy&apos;s Davis. 
 A takeover could follow. Sears declined to comment on any other 
 potential uses for the capital. 

 Another possibility is that Sears is 
 holding the bonds because it thinks they will grow in value. Davis 
 calls the process&quot;seasoning&quot;: The bonds will probably increase in 
 value over time if Sears demonstrates steady royalty and lease 
 payments. Sears declined to comment. 

 &apos;INTEREST IS 
 EXPLODING&apos; 

 Whatever Sears&apos; plans may be, there&apos;s 
 no doubt it&apos;s blazing a path for other private investors. Eric 
 Hedman, a director in S&amp;P&apos;s Structural Finance Group, says&quot;interest 
 [in intellectual property deals] is exploding.&quot; Rudder, the attorney, expects much of the rise to be driven 
 by private equity firms seeking cheaper financing for acquisitions. 
 Carlyle Group and its other private equity partners in the Dunkin&apos; 
 Donuts acquisition last year used the method on a $1.7 billion issue 
 backed by the chain&apos;s brands and actual franchise fees.&quot;What has 
 been done so far is only scratching the surface,&quot;says Rudder. Ellen 
 Welsher, S&amp;P&apos;s managing director of new assets, agrees that any 
 company with intellectual property could unlock value this way. Adds 
 Ronald S. Borod, a Boston lawyer specializing in intellectual 
 property securitization:&quot;It could become the modern day equivalent 
 of junk bonds.&quot; 

 Robert W. D&apos;Loren, CEO of NexCen 
 Brands Inc. (NEXC ), is building a whole business model around the 
 securitization of intellectual property. Since August, using debt 
 and proceeds from a public offering, NexCen acquired the Athlete&apos;s 
 Foot chain, Bill Blass apparel brand, and the Maggie Moo&apos;s and 
 Marble Slab Creamery ice-cream stores. D&apos;Loren has already created 
 an entity to hold the brands and issue bonds backed by franchising 
 fees from the sneaker and ice-cream chains, and from Bill Blass 
 licensing fees. The diversity of those fees will enable NexCen to 
 issue lower-cost bonds to pay off earlier debts and fund further 
 acquisitions.&quot;We have created a platform to become a consistent 
 issuer of intellectual-property-backed bonds,&quot; D&apos;Loren says. 

 So too, it seems, has Sears. There&apos;s 
 no sign of what the endgame may be. But one thing is certain: With 
 the news of the brand bond out, you can bet others will watch 
 closely and read the financial footnotes - to see what Sears might be up to next.
 

 

 Sears wants J. Crew co-founder to fill board vacancy 
 By Sandra Jo h ns 
 - Inside Retailing - Chicago Tribune
April 7, 2007 

 Ever since billionaire investor 
 Edward Lampert engineered the combination of Sears and Kmart two 
 years ago, the company&apos;s board has lacked traditional retail 
 expertise. 

 That is about to change. 

 Sears Holdings Corp., the Hoffman 
 Estates-based retail chain made up of Sears and Kmart, nominated to 
 its board former J. Crew Group Inc. chairman and co-founder Emily 
 Scott, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
 Commission. 

 Scott, 45, who has more than two 
 decades of retailing experience, will join Sears&apos; board in May. 

 Sears CEO Aylwin Lewis, a board 
 member, is relatively new to general merchandising. Lewis ran the 
 operations at fast-food restaurant company Yum Brands before Lampert 
 recruited him to run his retail empire. 

 Scott will fill the vacancy created 
 by the resignation this month of Donald J. Carty, a holdover from 
 the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. board. Carty, who once ran American 
 Airlines, was named vice chairman and CFO of Dell Inc. in January. 

 Scott joins a board of seven, most 
 who have either worked for Lampert&apos;s hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, 
 invested money with him, or spent time at Goldman Sachs, where 
 Lampert got his start. She enters the scene as Lampert tries to 
 revitalize Lands&apos; End, the preppy catalog retailer that competes 
 with J. Crew. 

 Scott, then known as Emily Woods, 
 founded J. Crew with her father, Arthur Cinader, in 1983. The pair 
 sold a majority stake in the company to Texas Pacific Group in 1997 
 for $560 million. Scott resigned from J. Crew&apos;s board in December, 
 not long after owner Texas Pacific Group took the company public. 
 She still owned a 9 percent stake as of October, according to SEC 
 filings. 

 Scott and her husband, Tom Scott, 
 co-founder of Nantucket Nectars, own Plum TV LLC, a New York-based 
 television station network that operates in a handful of seaside and 
 ski resort towns including Aspen and the Hamptons.
 
 

 

 Wal-Mart Shuffles Management, 
 Creates Two New Executive Posts 
 By Gary McWilliams - 
 Wall Street Journal Online
April 6, 2007 

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. named two senior 
 executives to new positions in its U.S. stores operation, a 
 reshuffling that reflects the pressure on management to improve the 
 lagging performance of its domestic unit. 

 It named a new operations chief for 
 the Wal-Mart Stores division, which accounts for two-thirds of its 
 $345 billion in annual revenue. William S. Simon, 48 years old, who oversaw the company&apos;s pharmacy, vision and 
 mini-clinic businesses, was named chief operating officer of U.S. 
 stores. 

 Patricia A. Curran, 43, who had been 
 executive vice president of U.S. store operations, becomes the 
 division&apos;s executive vice president of people, a human resources 
 post. Last year, Ms. Curran kicked off big changes in staffing and 
 store design to improve service and sales at its 3,400 locations. 

 In the third-year of a three-year 
 turnaround effort, results haven&apos;t showed expected improvements and 
 economic cross-winds have increased. The latest changes come a week 
 after the head of U.S. stores, Eduardo Castro-Wright, became a 
 direct report of Wal-Mart Chief Executive H. Lee Scott Jr. He 
 previously had reported to a vice-chairman. 

 U.S. comparable store sales, a key 
 measure of revenue gains, rose just 0.9% in February compared with 
 3.5% in the year-earlier month. Wal-Mart&apos;s domestic sales have been 
 struggling for the past year with higher energy prices and rising 
 consumer interest rates. 

 Wal-Mart typically makes major 
 executive changes at the end of its January fiscal year end. But a 
 company spokesman said the job reshuffling isn&apos;t a reflection of 
 impatience with the division or recent results. 

 Mr. Simon, who oversaw the company&apos;s 
 launch of $4 generic drugs, is a former executive with restaurant 
 chain Brinker International.&quot;Bill has proven he can drive 
 innovation, growth and profitability,&quot;Mr. Castro-Wright said in a 
 statement. 

 Ms. Curran, who began at Wal-Mart as 
 an hourly worker, will oversee the division&apos;s efforts to boost 
 employee involvement.&quot;We greatly expanded our human resources 
 support in the field last year and now want to bring that even 
 closer to the business,&quot;Mr. Castro-Wright said of her duties.
 
 

 

 Sears 
 securitizes its brand names: BusinessWeek 
 Washington Post Online
April 5, 2007 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears Holdings 
 Corp. (SHLD.O: Quote, Profile, Research) has created $1.8 billion 
 worth of securities based on its most famous brand names: Kenmore, Craftsman and Die Hard, BusinessWeek magazine 
 said in its latest issue on Thursday. 

 Sears had transferred ownership of 
 the brands to an insurance subsidiary of the retailer last May, 
 protecting them from any bankruptcy proceeding, BusinessWeek said, 
 citing documents and sources familiar with the securitization. 

 The deal represents the biggest 
 securitization of intellectual property in history, said the 
 magazine, citing an analyst at Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s, which, like 
 BusinessWeek, is a unit of McGraw-Hill Companies (MHP.N: Quote, 
 Profile, Research). 

 Intellectual property bonds have been 
 around since 1997, but generally rely on a stream of income to make 
 interest payments, such as royalty payments from songs. Sears 
 brand-name bonds do not involve pre-existing royalty payments, 
 BusinessWeek said. 

 The magazine suggested that Sears 
 could license the brand names to other companies. Sears has not 
 commented on what it plans to do, BusinessWeek said.
 

 

 At Wal-Mart, Lessons in 
 Self-Help 
 By Michael Barbaro - 
 New York Times
April 5, 2007 

 Employees at a Wal-Mart near 
 Saratoga, Fla., have started an aerobics class twice a week in their 
 break room. Wal-Mart workers in Denver are reimbursed for taking 
 public transportation to and from work. And the staff at a Sams 
 Club in Indianapolis now takes a daily walk around the perimeter of 
 the store. 

 The chain that promises &quot; always low prices &quot; seems to be adding the mantra of nonstop self-improvement. 

 In the last year, Wal-Mart has 
 quietly introduced an ambitious program in the United States in 
 equal parts self-help class, corporate retreat and tent revival 
 that tries to turn its 1.3 million workers into a model for its 200 
 million customers on issues ranging from personal health to the 
 environment. 

 The program, to be announced today, 
 tests the assumption, if not conventional wisdom, that 
 environmentalism and fitness are luxuries of the well-off, 
 inaccessible to a vast number of the nations working class because 
 of hectic schedules, stretched budgets and bad habits. 

 At the same time, it thrusts 
 Wal-Mart, the nations largest employer, far deeper into workers 
 personal lives than the company and perhaps any retailer has 
 ever reached before. 

 In extensive workshops held 
 nationwide, the company is teaching its employees the benefits of 
 carpooling to work with three colleagues (for a savings of $400 a 
 year on gas), quitting cigarette smoking ($1,500 a year) and turning 
 off a television ($40 a year in electricity, plus more time to spend 
 with family). 

 The program, called the personal 
 sustainability project, is voluntary, but it is proving popular, 
 with roughly 50 percent of employees in a dozen states signing up so 
 far. The company may eventually extend the program to its workers 
 around the world. 

 For Wal-Mart, the payoff could be 
 significant: if it succeeds, the initiative could improve employee 
 morale, and therefore productivity; reduce health care spending on a 
 work force with higher rates of heart disease and diabetes than the 
 general public; and improve Wal-Marts reputation with the 
 image-conscious consumers it is courting with costlier merchandise. 

 Over the next two years, Wal-Mart 
 will ask all employees to adopt a pledge to improve their bodies, 
 their families or their planet. And behind that seemingly New Age 
 aspiration is an estimated $30 million commitment, making the 
 program one of the most expensive of its kind. 

 White-collar companies, like I.B.M. 
 and Microsoft, have long sponsored fitness and lifestyle improvement 
 programs, which are considered a simple perk by their largely 
 middle-class employees. But companies with workers who are more 
 likely to live paycheck to paycheck have generally scoffed at the 
 cost, which makes Wal-Marts investment so striking. 

 Wal-Mart, which is known for its 
 rigid rules, is also giving the program an unusually democratic 
 structure. The company is training and paying hundreds of 
 employees to recruit their colleagues, holding off-site retreats for 
 participants (a rarity for hourly workers) and tracking workers 
 progress in written reports that measure participation rates. 

 During a workshop in Houston several 
 weeks ago, Wal-Mart managers and hourly workers spent five hours at 
 the zoo learning about environmental sustainability, a lesson that 
 included tips on reducing carbon emissions and consuming healthier, 
 more environmentally friendly food. By the end of the day, each 
 employee had written down a pledge or, in the programs parlance, 
 a personal sustainability practice. 

 &quot; I 
 want to start recycling around my home, &quot; said Curtis Tipton, a manager.  &quot;Im prove 
 my physical health with food and exercise, &quot; said Ferne Oyster, who works in a grocery department. &quot; Spend more quality time with my family, &quot; said Miriam Crosby, who runs a Wal-Mart in the area. 

 This is a far cry from the mandatory, 
 at times robotic Wal-Mart cheer (Give me a W, give me an A, 
 and so on) uttered every morning at the chains 4,000 United States 
 stores and that, organizers say, is the point. 

 To succeed, the program must be 
 personal, with each of Wal-Marts employees tailoring it to his or 
 her own life. Wal-Mart has left the initiative purposely vague, the 
 better to encourage workers to decide how to improve themselves. 

 The challenges for Wal-Mart are 
 significant. Its workers earn, on average, less than $20,000 a year, 
 which means that fitness and ecology are, by necessity, relatively 
 low priorities. Wal-Mart attracts a transient work force, with 
 frequent turnover making it difficult to train people over time. And a disproportionate number of its employees suffer from 
 chronic diseases that stem in part from poor eating habits. 

 &quot; We need a 
 Subway in there instead of a McDonalds, &quot; said Cheryl Victorian, a 39-year-old package receiver at a Wal-Mart 
 near Houston who, pressed for time, frequently eats breakfast and 
 lunch at the McDonalds in her store. Now 
 248 pounds, she said her goal is to get down to 195. 

 In an interview, Wal-Marts chief 
 executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said he was in talks with McDonalds 
 about granting employees discounts on healthy menu items, like 
 salads. 

 About half of the Wal-Mart employees 
 introduced to the personal sustainability project have agreed to 
 participate, a figure much higher than the company had expected. 
 Among the pledges the workers have made are to stop eating fast 
 food, switch to nontoxic cleaning supplies, prepare two organic 
 meals a week and stretch five mornings a week. 

 Kim Nicholson, a 40-year-old employee 
 at Sams Club in Indianapolis, has lost 35 pounds since the program 
 began and has organized a regular walk around her store (inside and 
 outside). 

 &quot; The name 
 of the game in retail is that we are juggling odd hours, raising 
 families and the stress of the job, &quot; Ms. 
 Nicholson said. &quot; It contributes to a lot 
 of bad habits. &quot; She estimates, for 
 example, that 40 out of the 110 employees at her store smoke 
 cigarettes. 

 But Ms. Nicholson, herself a smoker 
 who weighs just under 200 pounds, said the personal sustainability 
 project &quot;b inds us all in a common cause. &quot; 

 She added, &quot; When 
 you get a lot of people thinking about their health and the 
 environment, its powerful. &quot; 

 The self-improvement that Wal-Mart is 
 evangelizing can be traced back to its broad environmental 
 sustainability initiative. In the fall of 2005, Mr. Scott, the chief executive, vowed to reduce energy use in 
 Wal-Marts stores, improve the fuel efficiency of its trucks, 
 minimize its use of packaging and pressure thousands of suppliers to 
 follow its lead. 

 But the company has wrestled with how 
 to integrate its workers into the program. A year ago, executives 
 enlisted the help of Adam Werbach, a prominent environmentalist and 
 former president of the Sierra Club, who runs a consulting firm 
 called Act Now Productions. 

 At first, Mr. Werbach rebuffed 
 Wal-Mart, assuming the project was a public relations stunt. But Mr. 
 Werbach who, in the late 1990s, chastised environmentalists in 
 speeches and essays for failing to reach average Americans said he 
 realized that by ignoring Wal-Mart, &quot; would 
 be saying no to the one company that spoke to basically every 
 American. &quot; 

 Wal-Mart, Mr. Werbach said, has the 
 capacity to become &quot; the nations largest 
 environmental group. &quot; He and the staff of 
 Act Now Productions developed the personal sustainability project 
 with Wal-Mart &quot; to make environmentalism 
 relevant to a broad audience. &quot; 

 Linda Dillman, the executive vice 
 president for benefits and sustainability at Wal-Mart, said that the 
 program harks back to what we did much better when we were a 
 smaller company, which was give our associates information and let 
 them solve problems. &quot; 

 Leslie Laney, a 33-year-old employee 
 at Sams Club in Brandon, Fla., decided to solve the trash problem 
 in her store. After the personal sustainability project was 
 introduced, Ms. Laney created a &quot; zero 
 waste &quot; break room where workers use mugs 
 instead of Styrofoam cups and set up bins to recycle aluminum cans 
 and plastic bottles. 

 Then she recruited co-workers to help 
 clean up a wetland area behind a nearby elementary school, removing 
 a tangle of overgrown vines. Their next plan is to turn the wetland 
 into a classroom, with boardwalks that let students walk around and 
 study the ecosystem. 

 &quot; This 
 is not about becoming a tree-hugger, &quot; Ms. 
 Laney said. &quot; Its about making one little 
 change. It does not matter how big or small, but just doing one 
 thing that makes a difference. &quot;
 
 

 

 Sears offers 
 warning on Craftsman saws 
 Business Week Online
April 5, 2007 

 Sears Holding Corp., operator of 
 Sears and Kmart stores, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday announced a hazard 
 warning for Craftsman Circular Saws. 

 The&quot;Craftsman&quot;logo on the upper 
 blade guard of the saws, which are made by Positec Power Tools Co. 
 Ltd. of Charlotte, N.C., could become detached and interfere with 
 the saw&apos;s operations. 

 Sears has received two reports of 
 this happening; one case resulted in an injury requiring 12 
 stitches. 

 The saws were sold at Sears, Kmart 
 and Orchard Supply Hardware stores and their Web sites between 
 November 2004 and February 2007. 

 Consumers should remove the Craftsman 
 label from the upper blade guard. 

 Sears shares rose 46 cents to $184.18 
 during morning trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 

 

 Sears CEO paid $4.8 million
Lewis got far less than predecessor 
 From Chicago Tribune 
 news services
April 5, 2007 

 Sears Holdings Corp. paid Chief 
 Executive Aylwin Lewis $4.8 million in his first full year in the 
 position, but the man he replaced, Alan Lacy, received almost four 
 times that amount. 

 Lewis&apos; compensation for the fiscal 
 year ended in February included a salary of $1.01 million, stock 
 awards of $1.33 million and option awards of $1.38 million, the 
 company said Wednesday in a regulatory filing. 

 Lewis&apos; pay also included $889,000 
 from an incentive plan and $182,519 the firm spent for moving him 
 closer to company headquarters in Hoffman Estates. 

 In September 2005, Sears ousted Lacy 
 as CEO and promoted Lewis after sales fell at the Sears and Kmart 
 chains. He served as head of Kmart Holding Corp. before becoming CEO. 

 The company&apos;s revenue climbed 7.9 
 percent for the year ended in February, though same-store sales 
 declined. 3.7 percent. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at 
 least a year, are considered the best indicator of a retailer&apos;s 
 health. 

 Lacy received $15.6 million in 
 compensation last year. He resigned in July as vice chairman of 
 Sears and chairman of Sears Canada. 

 Sears said his pay package included 
 stock awards valued at $3.81 million, option awards valued at $3.64 
 million, a $499,417 salary and&quot;all other compensation&quot;of $7.63 
 million. The company said the&quot;all other&quot;figure included a one-time 
 severance payment of $7.5 million. 

 Chairman Edward Lampert was the only 
 director to not receive compensation for work on the board in 2006. 
 The board has given Lampert the authority to directly invest Sears&apos; 
 extra cash, the company said in the SEC filing. Lampert, a hedge fund manager, has said he&apos;ll use the surplus 
 cash for investments and possible acquisitions outside of the retail 
 industry. 

 Lampert and his Greenwich, 
 Conn.-based ESL Investments Inc. own 65.4 million shares, or 42.5 
 percent of the company, according to the filing. That makes his 
 stake worth about $12 billion. 

 Sears has a hefty war chest of $3.97 
 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its March 28 
 annual report. The parent of Sears department stores and Kmart 
 discount outlets increased net income by 74 percent in 2006, to 
 $1.49 billion, on an 8 percent increase in revenue, to $53 billion. 

 Year-over-year compensation 
 comparisons are complicated by a new Securities and Exchange 
 Commission rule that spreads the value of stock-option grants over 
 several years instead of reporting the full value in the year they 
 are awarded.
 
 

 

 Sears/Kmart distribution center opens in Illinois 
 By Bob Okon - Staff Writer 
 - Joliet Il Herald News
April 5, 2007 

 ROMEOVILLE -- A glimpse of the future 
 of Sears and Kmart can be seen at the retailer&apos;s newly opened 
 distribution center in Romeoville. 

 The 814,000-square-foot Direct 
 Delivery Center is a key part of Sears Holding Corp&apos;s plan to 
 maintain its hold on major market share of the nation&apos;s appliance 
 business. 

 The Romeoville facility is the first 
 of five such distribution centers that Sears plans to open by the 
 end of 2008. 

 &quot;We&apos;re building for the future,&quot;said 
 Anthony Dattilo, division vice president for Direct Delivery 
 Centers.&quot;We&apos;re looking ahead at what we need to do to support the 
 appliance business.&quot; 

 The idea behind the Direct Delivery 
 Centers is that Sears will be able to get refrigerators, lawn 
 tractors and other heavy-duty items to customers&apos; homes faster. 

 &quot;You&apos;ve got a bigger assortment 
 that&apos;s closer to the customers,&quot;Dattilo said. 

 The new Direct Delivery Center, 
 located at 1701 Normantown Road, is about 300,000-square-feet larger 
 than Sears previous Romeoville distribution center and holds three 
 times the amount of merchandise. 

 Fully stocked, the center will hold 
 120,000 items -- all appliances. The center serves more than 300 
 Sears and Kmart stores in the Midwest. 

 The distribution center gets computer 
 messages from stores when customers buy the appliances and 
 immediately prepares to ship the product, said Jim Ridle, director 
 of operations for Direct Delivery Centers. 

 &quot;It&apos;s all done through point of 
 sale,&quot;Ridle said.&quot;You order today, and I deliver tomorrow.&quot; 

 Ridle was general manager when Sears 
 Holding&apos;s first Romeoville distribution center opened in 2000. That 
 facility was located along Schmidt Road. 

 When Sears decided to move to the new 
 building, located along Interstate 55 at a very visible site, south 
 of the Weber Road interchange, village officials asked that the 
 company post its household name on the building. A large sign, 
 visible from I-55, is slated to go up next week. 

 Romeoville Mayor Fred Dewald, 
 speaking at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the facility Wednesday,

 people in the village didn&apos;t realize Sears was already in town.

 Sears&apos; CEO got $2.1 million in compensation in 2006 
 Crain&apos;s Chicago Business 
 Online
April 4, 2007 

 (AP) Sears Holdings Corp. CEO Aly win Lewis got compensation valued at 
 $2.1 million in 2006 during a year when the retailer&apos;s same-store 
 sales continued to sag but profits rose strongly, according to an 
 analysis of a regulatory filing Wednesday. 

 Lewis, who took the post in September 
 2005, received a salary of $1,010,898, non-equity incentives of 
 $889,000 and other compensation of $197,487. That amount included 
 $182,519 the company spent for moving him closer to company 
 headquarters in Hoffman Estates. 

 The Associated Press calculations of 
 total pay include executives&apos; salary, bonus, incentives, perks, 
 above-market returns on deferred compensation and the estimated 
 value of stock options and awards granted during the year. The 
 calculations don&apos;t include changes in the present value of pension 
 benefits and sometimes differ from the totals that companies 
 release. 

 Lewis, 52, was named to replace Alan 
 Lacy as chief executive by Chairman Edward Lampert, the billionaire 
 hedge-fund operator who retains an active role in the company&apos;s 
 day-to-day management. 

 Lampert, 44, and his Greenwich, 
 Conn.-based ESL Investments Inc. own 65.4 million shares, or 42.5% 
 of the company, according to the filing. That makes his stake worth 
 about $12 billion. 

 Sears itself also has a hefty war 
 chest of $3.97 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to 
 its March 28 annual report. The company said in the proxy filing 
 that its board has delegated the authority to Lampert to directly 
 invest the surplus cash as he sees fit, amid continuing speculation 
 that the company is preparing to acquire another large retailer. 

 Sears, the parent of Sears department 
 stores and Kmart discount outlets, increased net income by 74% to 
 $1.49 billion in 2006 on $53 billion in revenue, which was up 8% 
 despite weaker sales at established stores. Its stock price jumped 
 45% last year. 

 Sears shares are up about 9% in 2007.
 

 

 Sears&apos; CEO Lewis awarded $4.81 million 
 in &apos;06 compensation 
 From Tribune news 
 services - Chicago Tribune Online
April 4, 2007 

 Sears Holdings Corp. paid Chief 
 Executive Aylwin Lewis $4.81 million in his first full year in the 
 position, but the man he replaced, Alan Lacy, received almost four 
 times that amount. 

 Lewis&apos; compensation for the fiscal 
 year ended in February included a salary of $1.01 million, stock 
 awards of $1.33 million and option awards of $1.38 million, the 
 company said Wednesday in a regulatory filing. 

 Lewis&apos; pay also included $889,000 
 from an incentive plan and $182,519 the firm spent for moving him 
 closer to company headquarters in Hoffman Estates. 

 In September 2005, Sears ousted Lacy 
 as CEO and promoted Lewis after sales fell at the Sears and Kmart 
 chains. He served as head of Kmart Holding Corp. before becoming CEO. 

 The company&apos;s revenue climbed 7.9 
 percent for the year ended in February, though same-store sales 
 declined. 3.7 percent. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at 
 least a year, are considered the best indicator of a retailer&apos;s 
 health. 

 Lacy received $15.6 million in 
 compensation last year. He resigned in July as vice chairman of 
 Sears and chairman of Sears Canada. 

 Sears said the pay package included 
 stock awards valued at $3.81 million, option awards valued at $3.64 
 million, a $499,417 salary and&quot;all other compensation&quot;of $7.63 
 million. The company said the&quot;all other&quot;figure included a one-time 
 severance payment of $7.5 million. 

 Chairman Edward Lampert was the only 
 director to not receive compensation for work on the board in 2006. 
 The board has given Lampert the authority to directly invest Sears&apos;s 
 extra cash, the company said in the SEC filing. Lampert, a hedge fund manager, has said he&apos;ll use the surplus 
 cash for investments and possible acquisitions outside of the retail 
 industry. 

 Lampert and his Greenwich, 
 Conn.-based ESL Investments Inc. own 65.4 million shares, or 42.5 
 percent of the company, according to the filing. That makes his 
 stake worth about $12 billion. 

 Sears has a hefty war chest of $3.97 
 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its March 28 
 annual report. The parent of Sears department stores and Kmart 
 discount outlets increased net income by 74 percent in 2006, to 
 $1.49 billion, on an 8 percent increase in revenue, to $53 billion. 

 Year-over-year compensation 
 comparisons are complicated by a new Securities and Exchange 
 Commission rule that spreads the value of stock-option grants over 
 several years instead of reporting the full value in the year 
 they&apos;re awarded. 

 Sears also said it will hold its 
 annual shareholders&apos; meeting May 4.

 Darden Agrees to Improve Disclosures of Gift Card Terms 
 By Christopher Conkey - 
 Wall Street Journal
April 4, 2007 

 WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators 
 reached a settlement with a major owner of restaurant chains to 
 improve disclosures of terms and fees associated with its gift 
 cards. 

 Orlando, Fla.-based Darden 
 Restaurants Inc., which owns Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Smokey Bones 
 and Bahama Breeze, agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges 
 that it engaged in deceptive practices in marketing and selling its 
 gift cards. 

 At issue in the case were so-called&quot;dormancy&quot;fees, charges that are subtracted from a card&apos;s balance 
 if the card isn&apos;t used by a certain time. The FTC alleged that dormancy fees associated with Darden cards, 
 which amounted to $1.50 per month of inactivity once a card went 
 unused for two years, weren&apos;t properly disclosed to consumers. 

 Gift cards have become a popular 
 choice for birthday and holiday presents, but many consumers don&apos;t 
 realize they often come with hidden fees and expiration dates. 

 The FTC&apos;s settlement was the second 
 such action in two months aimed at companies that failed to 
 adequately disclose gift card fees to consumers. Kmart, a unit of Sears Holding Corp., settled similar charges 
 with the FTC last month. Both Kmart and Darden say they have ceased 
 charging dormancy fees. 

 Under terms of the settlement with 
 Darden, holders of its gift cards may visit its restaurants to get the amount they were charged in dormancy 
 fees restored.
 
 

 

 Inside 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s &apos;Threat Research&apos; Operation 
 By Ann Zimmerman and 
 Gary McWilliams - Wall Street Journal
April 4, 2007 

 The Wal-Mart Stores Inc. worker fired 
 last month for intercepting a reporter&apos;s phone calls says he was 
 part of a larger, sophisticated surveillance operation that included 
 snooping not only on employees, but also on critics, stockholders 
 and the consulting firm McKinsey&amp;Co. 

 As part of the surveillance, the 
 retailer last year had a long-haired employee infiltrate an 
 anti-Wal-Mart group to determine if it planned protests at the 
 company&apos;s annual meeting, according to Bruce Gabbard, the fired 
 security worker, who worked in Wal-Mart&apos;s Threat Research and 
 Analysis Group. The company also deployed cutting-edge monitoring 
 systems made by a supplier to the Defense Department that allowed it 
 to capture and record the actions of anyone connected to its global 
 computer network. The systems&apos;
high-tech wizardry could detect the degree of flesh-tone on a viewed 
 Internet image, and alerted monitors that a vendor sharing Wal-Mart 
 networks was viewing pornography. 

 Wal-Mart has since disconnected some 
 systems amid an internal investigation of the group&apos;s activities 
 earlier this year, according to an executive in the 
 security-information industry. 

 The revelations by Mr. Gabbard, many 
 of which were confirmed by other former Wal-Mart employees and 
 security-industry professionals, provide a rare window into the 
 retail giant&apos;s internal operations and mindset. The company fired 
 Mr. Gabbard, a 19-year employee, last month for unauthorized 
 recording of calls to and from a New York Times reporter and for 
 intercepting pager messages. Wal-Mart conducted an internal 
 investigation of Mr. Gabbard and his group&apos;s activities, fired his 
 supervisor and demoted a vice president over the group as well. 

 Mr. Gabbard says he recorded the 
 calls on his own because he felt pressured to stop embarrassing 
 leaks. But he says most of his spying activities were sanctioned by 
 superiors.&quot;I used to joke that Wal-Mart paid me to be paranoid and 
 they got their money&apos;s worth,&quot;Mr. Gabbard says. 

 Wal-Mart says it permitted recording 
 employee calls&quot;only in compelling circumstances and with written 
 permission from the legal department.&quot;But because pager messages 
 were sent over a frequency that was not secure, Mr. Gabbard inadvertently intercepted pages from non-Wal-Mart 
 employees as well. A U.S. attorney is 
 investigating whether any laws were violated as a result of the 
 phone and pager intercepts.

Wal-Mart Tapings Spark Probe2
3/6/2007 

 Aside from that possible infraction, 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s surveillance activity appears to be legal. U.S. courts 
 have long held that companies can read employee emails, and Wal-Mart 
 employees are informed they have&quot;no expectation of privacy&quot;when 
 using company-supplied computers or phones. The surveillance of 
 people in public places is also legal. 

 Wal-Mart has always placed tight 
 limits on what its employees can do while at work. For instance, it 
 bars store employees from using personal cellphones on the job. 
 Managers receive a list of email addresses and phone numbers their 
 employees have communicated with, and a list of Web sites visited, 
 according to current and former employees. And the company limits 
 Internet access, blocking social-networking and video sites. 

 But Wal-Mart appeared to go beyond 
 most companies in its sleuthing. It didn&apos;t just scan emails written 
 on the corporate email system. Technology it was helping develop 
 allowed it to view emails that employees sent to or received from 
 private accounts such as Hotmail or Gmail whenever the employees 
 were hooked into the Wal-Mart computer network, according to Mr. Gabbard and others with knowledge of the system. 

 The security operation and its 
 surveillance technology&quot;seems Orwellian,&quot; says Robert K. West, founder and chief executive of Echelon One, a 
 security research and consulting firm composed largely of former 
 corporate chief information officers. Other activities, like 
 infiltrating critics&apos; groups, went&quot;beyond the scope of the typical 
 information security organization,&quot;he says. 

 Wal-Mart declined to give details 
 about its surveillance activities. A company spokeswoman, Sarah Clark, characterized its security 
 operations as normal:&quot;Like most major 
 corporations, it is our corporate responsibility to have systems in 
 place, including software systems, to monitor threats to our network 
 and our intellectual property so we can protect our sensitive 
 business information,&quot;she said.&quot;It is also standard practice to 
 provide physical and information security for our corporate events 
 and for our board of directors and senior executives.&quot; 

 According to several former Wal-Mart 
 employees, the company&apos;s roughly 20-person Threat Research and 
 Analysis Group hunts computer hackers through cyberspace, trolls 
 colleagues&apos; emails looking for misbehavior or proprietary-data theft 
 and tries to plug damaging information leaks. Members work on the 
 third floor of the Wal-Mart&apos;s Bentonville, Ark., technology offices. 
 They enter a separate glass-enclosed structure by holding the palm 
 of their hand to a biometric reader that grants them access to a 
 dimly lit work area. Colleagues call it the&quot;Bat Cave.&quot; 

 The group&quot;is no longer operating in 
 the same manner that it did prior to the discovery of the 
 unauthorized recording of telephone conversations,&quot; said Wal-Mart&apos;s Ms. Clark.&quot;...We have strengthened our 
 practices and protocols.&quot; 

 According to Mr. Gabbard, Wal-Mart 
 began beefing up its electronic call surveillance after the Sept. 
 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in response to government requests to 
 employers in general to help find terrorist cells. Mr. Gabbard says he was directed by two former FBI agents 
 working for Wal-Mart to set up a system that could track any calls 
 to and from Syria, Yemen and Iran, among other countries. The search 
 was unsuccessful, only flagging an apparent call from Iran that 
 turned out instead to be from an Indian jeweler, according to Mr. 
 Gabbard. 

 Later, he says, he used the same 
 equipment to intercept and record calls from the New York Times. 

 The electronic surveillance 
 accelerated in October 2005 when confidential company memos began 
 appearing on the Web site of a union-backed anti-Wal-Mart group, 
 Wal-Mart Watch, according to Mr. Gabbard. One such memo suggested 
 that because of rising costs and criticisms of its worker health 
 insurance, the retailer should revise its policies by hiring 
 healthier workers and requiring all jobs to perform physical 
 activity, such as retrieving shopping carts. 

 Concerned about the leaks, Wal-Mart 
 began working with Oakley Networks Inc., a developer of&quot;insider 
 threat management&quot;gear to track employee and suppliers computer 
 usage over its network, according to Mr. Gabbard and an industry 
 source. One Oakley system is able to record an employee&apos;s computer 
 keystrokes and deliver a TiVo-like replay of his or her computer 
 activities, according to Tom Bennett, Oakley&apos;s vice president of 
 marketing. 

 Oakley Networks confirmed the 
 advanced capabilities of the system but says it doesn&apos;t identify 
 customers apart from the U.S. Defense Department. The system goes 
 beyond keystroke capture products and email filtering packages by&quot;providing a view of content moving over your network,&quot;says 
 Oakley&apos;s Mr. Bennett. 

 
Protesters blasting Wal-Mart&apos;s health-care policies during the 
 company&apos;s annual meeting last year. Suspecting that the leaks of confidential memos might have come from 
 McKinsey employees who had been working on a health-care project at 
 Wal-Mart&apos;s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters at the time of the leaked 
 memo, Wal-Mart&apos;s security experts used an Oakley device to monitor 
 the McKinsey Internet activities, according to Mr. Gabbard and 
 others. 

 Wal-Mart ultimately took no action.&quot;We continue to work closely with McKinsey, and we have no evidence 
 that anyone there ever inappropriately shared confidential 
 information,&quot;Wal-Mart&apos;s Ms. Clark said Monday. McKinsey declined to 
 comment. 

 Wal-Mart also used an Oakley product 
 to monitor suppliers&apos; use of the Wal-Mart network. Mr. Gabbard says 
 that using the program that can monitor flesh tones on a computer 
 screen, his team found a vendor downloading pornography and reported 
 it to Wal-Mart and the vendor&apos;s executives. He doesn&apos;t know the 
 outcome. Wal-Mart declined to comment on the incident. 

 Mr. Gabbard says he also used his 
 computer skills to find information on Wal-Mart critics. In March 
 2006, he searched a South Carolina Democratic Party Web site for 
 information on Nu Wexler, the spokesman for the anti-Wal-Mart group 
 Wal-Mart Watch. Wal-Mart knew that Mr. Wexler planned to be in 
 Northwest Arkansas during an annual company conference. Mr. Gabbard 
 said he found personal photos of Mr. Wexler stored on a publicly 
 available folder on the party&apos;s computer, which allowed Wal-Mart 
 security to identify Mr. Wexler. 

 &quot;Wal-Mart has far bigger concerns 
 than my vacation photos,&quot;said Mr. Wexler, after being informed of 
 the surveillance.&quot;Someone would have had to dig for quite a while 
 to find that link.&quot; 

 In late spring 2006, Wal-Mart learned 
 that several anti-Wal-Mart groups might protest at the annual 
 shareholders meeting in June. Company executives were concerned the 
 civil-rights group Acorn (the Association of Community Organizations 
 for Reform Now) and local Up Against the Wal members would disrupt 
 its meeting. Wal-Mart sent a long-haired employee wearing a wireless 
 microphone to Up Against the Wal&apos;s Fayetteville, Ark., gathering, 
 and eavesdropped from nearby, says Mr. Gabbard.&quot;We followed around 
 the perimeter with a surveillance van,&quot;he says. 

 &quot;It is not the company&apos;s policy to 
 infiltrate organizations or events, and we would not condone any 
 associate engaging in such activity,&quot;said Wal-Mart&apos;s Ms. Clark. 

 Wal-Mart also directed its 
 surveillance operations at critical shareholders. According to a January 2007 memo reviewed by The Wall Street 
 Journal, security units were asked to&quot;do some preliminary 
 background work on the potential threat assessment&quot;of those 
 submitting proposals to its June shareholder meeting, particularly 
 those whose resolutions the company was trying to block. The list 
 included proposals from a Boerne, Texas, religious group; the New 
 York City Controller&apos;s office; and Sydney Kay, an 85-year-old, 
 retired science teacher who submitted a resolution requiring that 
 board nominees own at least $5 million in Wal-Mart stock, and his 
 93-year-old sister Hilda Kaplis. 

 &quot;It is standard business practice to 
 do an overall assessment for potential disruptions at a major event 
 like our shareholders&apos; meeting involving 20,000-plus people,&quot;said 
 Ms. Clark. 

 Reached at his Dallas home, Mr. Kay 
 scoffed at the notion he posed a threat to Wal-Mart&apos;s annual 
 meeting.&quot;I am a nobody,&quot;he said.

 Allstate outlines CEO pay package $24 
 million in 2006 for ex-CEO Liddy 
 By Becky Yerak - 
 staff reporter - Chicago Tribune
April 3, 2007 

 In his last year as Allstate Corp. 
 chief executive, Edward Liddy received a $24 million pay package in 2006, the Northbrook-based insurer 
 disclosed in a regulatory filing Monday. 

 Liddy, who remains chairman, turned 
 over the CEO job last January to President Thomas Wilson, 49, who 
 received a $7.8 million pay package from the home-and-auto insurer. 

 Liddy&apos;s compensation included a $1.2 
 million salary, nearly $5 million in stock awards, including 
 restricted stock, and $7.2 million in stock options. 

 According to a proxy filed with the 
 Securities and Exchange Commission, Liddy, 61, also received a cash 
 bonus of $5.3 million and $108,000 in miscellaneous compensation, 
 which consisted mostly of $79,500 for the personal use of an 
 aircraft and $14,000 for the personal use of Allstate drivers and 
 cars. 

 The package also reflects a $5.1 
 million change in the value of his pension and pay called 
 non-qualified deferred compensation earnings. 

 The value of $100 invested in 
 Allstate stock on Dec. 31, 2005, would have been worth $123 at the 
 end of 2006, compared with $113 for a peer group and $116 for the Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s 500 index. 

 Allstate stock closed Monday at 
 $59.58, down 48 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
