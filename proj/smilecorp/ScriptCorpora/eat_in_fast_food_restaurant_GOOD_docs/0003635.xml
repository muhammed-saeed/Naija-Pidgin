 Magic Food 
 Posted in Uncategorized on November 12, 2011 by beentheredonethateatthis 
A long time ago and far far away, I always wanted to start a story that way!

Well maybe not so far away and somewhere around 40 years ago, we heard the double note horn and jumped up from whatever we were doing and ran to look out the window of the house on Capistrano. The small yellow sign with the Big Blue H sitting in the window had done its job, signaling to the driver of the yellow Helms Bakery truck to stop.  We ran to the truck well ahead of my Mother with my shorts&amp;skinned knees, my sisters ponytails bounced. We arrived just as the driver was opening the back doors of his delivery truck.  A large number of small doors with little brass knobs filled the back of the truck like a large roll top desk. Which one would he open? And when he did, the long drawer was filled with confectionery delights, glazed donuts, fruit filled pastry, fresh-baked bread and of course the cream puffs. They must have been the size of a softball and filled with cream then dusted with powdered sugar, pure heaven. Mom would chat and point to what she wanted and the driver would snap up sheets of white wax paper to grab the selection and place into a small white bag. We clung to the side of one of the long drawers bouncing up and down pleading with Mom to get the cream puffs and/or the glazed donuts.

MAGIC FOOD

Food can often remind you of a fond memory as it did with me.  My sisters, Mom, the Helms Bakery truck and of course cream puffs. Magic food can also be foods that have a profound change during cooking. Like rice sticks in hot oil, puff pastry, Pate a choux, soufflé.  You may even have a favorite.

Here’s a recipe for one of mine, a simple recipe with dramatic results and is quite tasty too.

POPOVERS

6 large Popovers

 

 

Heat  popover pan in 450° oven

Beat two eggs and 1 cup warm (110 degree) milk together

Add 1 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  careful not to over mix.

brush the heated popover pan liberally with Canola Oil

Fill each cup half full

Top with your favorite cheese. I like Gruyere, Asiago or Parmesan

Place the popover pan on the lower rack note: be sure there’s plenty of room above the pan as the popovers will rise 3 to 4 inches above the pan.

After 20 minutes, turn the pan around and decrease the temperature to 350 bake for another 25  min.

until golden brown.

Immediately remove popovers from pan and serve piping hot with butter.

I like raspberry butter

 

RASPBERRY BUTTER

One stick of unsalted butter at room temperature blended together with 2 tablespoons of raspberry jam.

 One Hot Chile…… 
 Posted in Uncategorized on September 20, 2011 by beentheredonethateatthis 
The other day one of the employees at the Company where my kitchen is located brought me about a poundof small orange Chiles which he had picked from a neighbors Garden, however he didn’t know what variety they were. I tried to identify them with photos from the web, 1 inch long or smaller and very bright orange. I however was unable to identify them so we dubbed the Chiles“Devils Teeth”. They looked like teeth from some B movie horror flick with a creature from the deep about to bite some poor stupid sap that wandered into the swamp that night armed with nothing but an old flashlight and his ditzy girlfriend for no apparent reason. Who does that anyway?  The point I’m trying to make is that these Chiles have bite and look like teeth, Devils teeth. There are literally hundreds of varieties of Chiles, all a member of the Nightshade Family and breeders are always developing hotter and hotter Chiles trying to claim the throne of the hottest Chile in the world. Habanero, a very popular Chile was crowned the King for a while and became readily available in supermarkets with a myriad of bottled sauces but has been topped by the Sonoran Habanero, the ghost Chile and the Trinidad Scorpion. There is even cult like following with clubs and cookoffs all over the world. Chiles are commonly measured for hotness with the Scoville scale created by Wilbur Scoville.  See Wikipedia’s definition for Scoville scale. To give you an idea on how hot Chiles can be, a Jalapeno on the Scoville scale is rated anywhere between 2,500 to 3,000, the Habanero anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 and now the Trinidad Scorpion comes in at over 1 million. Ouch! Besides the heat, Chiles can range from a fruity sweet flavor to chocolaty.  Discarding the ribs and seeds where most of the heat is stored will help unmask the true flavor of this wonderful fruit (unless you just want the heat). The following recipe can be adapted to any Chile. Just know the hotter the Chile the hotter the sauce. I used the unidentified Chiles, Devils Teeth and it was super hot and full of flavor.

 Toast in a sauce pan about 1 pound of chiles ( Your choice) with the stems removed.

 

add 1 large chopped onion and 1 tablespoon of canola oil saute untill onion is just soft.

 

add 2 cups tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 6 garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon cumin&amp;1 cup of water

simmer for 45 minutes let cool and puree in blender Salsa is ready to use or can be keep in frig or Canned, Pour into Mason Jars, set into water in sauce pan with water and bring to a boil for 15 minutes, let cool to room temp. The salsa will keep for up to 3 months at room temp.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_ 

Scoville Organoleptic Test

In Scoville’s
method, an alcohol extract of the capsaicin oil from a measured amount of dried pepper is added incrementally to a solution of sugar in water until the“heat”is just detectable by a panel of (usually five) tasters; the degree of dilution gives its measure on the Scoville scale. Thus a sweet pepper or a bell pepper, containing no capsaicin at all, has a Scoville rating of zero, meaning no heat detectable. The hottest chilis, such as Habaneros and Nagas , have a rating of 200,000 or more, indicating that their extract must be diluted over 200,000 times before the capsaicin presence is undetectable. The greatest weakness of the Scoville Organoleptic Test is its imprecision, because it relies on human subjectivity. Tasters taste only one sample per session.

The following is from World of Chillies 

It is said that chillis can help fight off winter colds and eating them certainly releases endorphins that helps lift the spirits.
Chillies are packed with vitamins, containing more Vitamin C than oranges, more Vitamin A than carrots and such high levels of Vitamin D that some athletes eat them prior to exercising to reduce the risk of injury. The active ingredient in chillies, capsacin has been known to reduce the amount of insulin the body needs to lower blood sugar levels after a meal by up to about 60% which could be of benefit to diabetics and the overweight. Chillies are natural anti-oxidents and can help to prevent cancer. It has long been noted that cultures that regularly consume chillies have lower than average rates of cancer. Recent tests on rats with prostrate cancer showed that large doses of capsacin caused the death of 80% of cancer cells making it a possible part of a future cure.

 Cactus Pears and Cowboys 
 Posted in Uncategorized on September 13, 2011 by beentheredonethateatthis 
During the dog days of summer when
it’s so hot the sun seems to sear the ground and heat waves play tricks on your
eyes with mirages, I wonder what it must have been like to be a Marauder in the
old West, traveling the desert, hanging low in the saddle and praying the
precious canteen of water and his horse will last until the next town. He may
have chewed on buffalo jerky and a piece of jackrabbit leftover from the day
before and an Indian Fig or Prickly Pear. The nights were just as ominous with
a thick blanket of stars, without the city lights to muddle the show like
crystals on black velvet tossed by the hand of God with a flick of his wrist
just for fun. Amber light flashed and waned on the face of our weary cowboy
from the Yucca Tree campfire roasting something he was lucky enough to catch
accompanied by the Prickly Pear which provided some moisture.

 

Opuntia Fruit are found on the
Nopalea Cactus, also known as Prickly Pear or Indian Fig from the Paddle Cactus
which grows wild in the desert regions of the West. The Prickly Pear can be
consumed orange, yellow or green but my favorite is the magenta color that the
following recipes utilize. Living in Santa Clarita California
at the edge of the Mojave Desert is prime condition for the Nopalea Cactus and it was easy to find a large stock of
Prickly Pears. I harvested a dozen large red ripe fruit and decided to make
cactus marmalade and cactus tea. The Prickly Pear can be made into jam, jelly,
margaritas, Cactus hooch, salad dressing, candies and lemonade. It also has
been reported good for hangovers, nausea, dry mouth and loss of appetite and
having some of the properties of Aloe Vera can be used as an anointment for
minor scrapes and burns.

 CACTUS PEAR MARMALADE 

2 cups Cactus pear pulp

1 cup water

2 large oranges zest from 1 orange
and all the juice and pulp

2 lemons zest from 1 lemon and all
the juice

1 ½ cup sugar

2 teaspoon pectin powder

1)Look for large plump red fruit to harvest, use tongs and
gloves to prevent you from getting stuck up by the cactus needles. The fruit
itself also has very fine thorns you’ll want to avoid. Grip the fruit with
tongs and with a sharp knife cut from the Cactus.

2)Still using the tongs and gloves cut the top and the
bottom off the fruit and gently peel off skin. Be careful with the juice as it
will stain wood cutting boards and clothing.

 

3)Mash the cactus fruit into a saucepan with 1 cup of water
and bring to a boil, simmer for 30 min.

 

4)Strain juice and pulp through a sieve to remove the seeds
and course pulp.

5)The juice can then be used to make cactus tea add desired
amount of water and sugar and garnish with a squeeze of lemon and mint.

 

6)For the marmalade, use the zest from one orange and one
lemon finely julienned and the juice and pulp of two oranges and the juice of
two lemons. Return 2 cups of the cactus juice to the saucepan with the orange
and lemon mixture and simmer until the citrus rinds are tender and the liquid
reduced by one third.

7)Combine the sugar and the Pectin powder and add to
simmering marmalade, simmer for an additional 5 min.

 

8)Place hot mixture into 8 ounce Mason jars and seal. Let
cool on countertop for two hours and then can be placed into refrigerator or
pantry.

 

 

9)Serve on toast, tortillas or Navajo Fry bread.

If you don’t want to go through the
trouble of harvesting and prepping the Prickly Pears, you can buy Prickly Pear
products on line at http://www.desertusa.com/magoct97/oct_pear.html

 Inventor / Chef 
 Posted in Uncategorized on September 5, 2011 by beentheredonethateatthis 


An inventor is somebody who’s looking for or inspired by and trying to nail two things together that has never been nailed together before, successfully and of course hopefully profitably. A chef is somebody who cooks for somebody else for a living. A chef is in a way an inventor, looking for or inspired by ingredients never combined before to create something palatable and hopefully profitable. Take Wolfgang Puck for example who in an inspired Eureka moment put duck sausage on a pizza and started an empire, an avalanche of creativity throughout America. I believe sometimes when an inventor/s comes up with an idea it’s spontaneous. I’m not talking about copycats but rather a kind of cosmic event when a particular idea becomes a widespreadEurekamoment, perhaps a natural progression of a particular product or idea. Of course there are the copycats and the people who expand on an idea to make it better. My wife just said to me yesterday “when are they going to come up with a phone that you can Skype (video calls) with?” She came up with that idea on her own but I’m sure it’s probably already in the works.  So for this week’s blog I’m going to share two of my favorite food history stories both accidental and significant culinary inventions, Puff Pastry and the Caesar Salad.

CAESAR SALAD

The salad’s creation is generally attributed to restaurateur Caesar Cardini , an Italian immigrant who operated restaurants inMexico and theUnited States. Cardini was living inSan Diego but also working inTijuana where he avoided the restrictions of Prohibition. His daughterRosa (1928–2003) recounted that her father invented the dish when a Fourth of July 1924 rush depleted the kitchen’s supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of the table-side tossing“by the Chef.”

PUFF PASTRY

 Pate Feuilletee, or puff pastry is attributed to being first created around 1645 by Claudius Gele. Claudius an apprentice in a rural French patisserie, who in an effort to create a bread for his ailing father as prescribed by a doctor whom wanted the elder Gele on a diet rich in flour and butter, invented puff pastry by folding in layers of butter into an already butter rich dough. Claudius brought his creation first to Paris at the Rosabau Patisserie and then toFlorence at the Mosca Pastry Shop where it became famous.

 Cowboy Spoon Bread, Route 66&amp;Corn Chowder 
 Posted in Uncategorized on August 30, 2011 by beentheredonethateatthis 
During my road trip cross-country I traveled a great many miles on Route 66, also known as the Mother Road, which goes from Chicago Illinois through Springfield to St. Louis Missouri down to Oklahoma City then Albuquerque and Santa Fe New Mexico to Flagstaff Arizona and then finally on to Santa Monica to Los Angeles…over 2300 miles.

 Route 66“Salsa Brava”Flagstaff Arizona 
 Posted in Uncategorized on August 21, 2011 by beentheredonethateatthis 
 Well were back or I’m back rather, 3 1/2 months recovering from heart surgery and 22 days on a cross-country road trip vacation, first vacation in 14 years I might add. And back to work last Monday full-time Yahoo! So I took last week off from blogging to get back into the swing of things at work. So here I am really no closer to being caught up than I was two weeks ago, but that seems to be how the restaurant business goes. Always something to do and work is never done. But I digress this blog is not about my Café but about somebody else’s. Chef John Conley’s “Salsa Brava”. Okay now I need to back up a  bit to set up the blog. One of my blog fans hearing about my road trip in July and knowing that I would be doing some reviews on cafés and restaurants along the way. Suggested I do something like diners drive-ins and dives with Guy Fieri and that’s just what I did, in fact one of the restaurants I dined at was covered by Guy Fieri “Salsa Brava” cocina in Flagstaff Arizona. Here is the link to that episode. www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t6JR9F62f0 

As I sit down in the red leather booth a thunderstorm brewing outside which I understand is very common for Flagstaff Arizona I wanted to try something that Guy  had on his show so the waitress informed me that there was two items that he featured the Navajo tacos and the Sopaipillas. I ordered the tacos with Carne Asada. Navajo tacos are made with Navajo fry bread and  more like a tostada than a taco. The Navajo fry bread was still warm and crispy topped with refried beans Carne Asada, shredded lettuce, famers cheese and sour cream and was simply delicious and way too much to eat for one meal. I also explored the salsa bar which featured an array of different kinds of salsas. roasted pineapple habanero, blackened tomato and jalapeno, roasted tomatillo chipotle, salsa Verde, salsa chile de arbol etc. the decor was a lot like something you would find at Rosarito Beach, bright primary colors red blue yellow terra-cotta pots, and tin geckos hanging on the walls. Beer flags you’d might find at a beach volleyball tournament during spring break. The music was reggae. Chef John Conley also produced a very nice cookbook called Salsa Brava Cocina smokin’ salsa and other chile inspired recipes by John Conley. A very nice softbound well put together fabulously photographed cookbook with his personal story about himself and his family and why he does what he does and a number of really nice recipes. If you should ever be in Flagstaff Arizona I recommend you try Salsa Brava at 2220 E. Route 66 Flagstaff Arizona 86004.

 A Walk in Kansas 
 Posted in Uncategorized on August 6, 2011 by beentheredonethateatthis 
California Burger&amp;Chicago Dog
 
Here I am in Junction City Kansas also considered middle America literally middle America it’s just as high North is it is South, West as it is East right in the middle of our great nation. I decided to go for a walk early in the morning because the weather report said that it would reach at least 100+with 60% humidity way more than I wanted to battle during a walk. There was a gentle Westward leaning breeze pushing me toward home as I walked up the road and into the old Kansas neighborhood of Quant little homes in ill repair weathered by years of harsh summers and winters the sidewalks were cracked and uneven some  overgrown with grass and weeds, trees were old Majestic and gnarled and the breeze brushing against the leaves made the sound of running water, still pushing me home. I walked over a train track glancing briefly North and South as it wound out of sight with the trees along the river. I walked through the park with a memorial to our brave. Flags adorn many of the homes. The path was peppered  with spent shells of independence celebration. I walked on and back towards the river to a cornfield malnourished from lack of water then back to the rail which I walked along like a scene from “stand by me”  tossing pebbles and small rocks into the air trying to strike the  rail making the twang that flew up the steel like a rocket. I looked for spikes that had been worked out by years of vibration from the huge monstrous machines that passed over the rails over the years, maybe a souvenir, I spied one bent and half buried in the dirt and rocks, However I left it.  Maybe it was meant to stay with the rail. I walked the track over the ties, rocks and Tar an occasional unfortunate animal who’s carcass had been reduced by whether to just leathered skin stretched on bones.

Still the warm Kansas breeze pushed me home to you.

What does this have to do with Food….. Nothing. But I did eat at a very popular Local fast food restaurant called “Freddie’s frozen Custard&amp;Steak Burgers” in Junction City, Kansas. Middle America,  just a few miles west of Fort Riley an active Army base. The town was steeped in Army history and Steak Burgers Sounded like dinner to me. I ordered a California burger, I was bit home sick and a Cal, Burger was bound to make me feel better. What I did revive was not a steak or a burger I,ve ever seen inCalifornia. It was in fact ground beef smashed on the flat grill until almost paper thin and topped with American cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, a very thick slice of onion. I guess what made it Cali was the avocado. Non the less it was good and I was hungry. I also had a Chicago Dog, But don’t get me started……

Happy Eat,n
