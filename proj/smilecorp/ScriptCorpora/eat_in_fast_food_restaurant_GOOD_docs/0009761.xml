 McDonalds Brings Back McRib, Introducing Chicken Flatbreads

 McDonald&apos;s is trying something old and something new this fall at its U.S. locations. But it has nothing to do with the McWeddings they&apos;re throwing in Hong Kong (see yesterday&apos;s post ).

The fast-food chain is bringing back its much lauded (by some) McRib sandwich on November 2 for a six-week run at its stores across the U.S. -- the first time in 16 years the sandwich will be available nationwide, the Wall Street Journal reported. &quot;It doesn&apos;t sell well all year long because people get tired of it,&quot; McDonald&apos;s USA President Jan Fields told the Journal . Weary customers, you&apos;ve had your break, and now your ribs are back.

McDonald&apos;s franchises in Nebraska, Maryland and New Mexico will also be testing the company&apos;s new chicken flatbreads this fall, Nation&apos;s Restaurant News reported. 
The flatbreads--grilled chicken wrapped in a grilled flatbread--come in four varieties, each with less than 300 calories and costing $1.89 in most markets, NRN reported.
 
 Tuscan Tomato Basil, with basil pesto, tomato and garlic aioli Four Cheese, with garlic aioli and a blend of cheddar, Monterey Jack, mozzarella and fontina cheese Southwest, with guacamole and pico de gallo BBQ Bacon Ranch, with bacon, barbecue ranch sauce and the four-cheese blend. 

The McRib, meanwhile, has been around since 1981, and is sporadically found at different restaurants around the country.
And, believe it or not, it has developed a bit of a cult following.
 
McRib enthusiast Alan Klein, who has loved the pork sandwich since his days growing up on a hog farm in South Dakota, launched a &quot; McRib Locator &quot; to help others find the sandwich after returning home from Minnesota and finding it on the menu, the Journal reported.

&quot;It rekindled my love of McRibs and made me start thinking it would be nice to know where they were,&quot; he told the paper.

The locator gets 300 to 400 hits weekly and recently posted McRib sightings in the Chicago and Detroit areas, although site user Tom Russomano, from Morristown, N.J., said he&apos;s also received &quot;false positives&quot; from the tool. He trekked to New York City after the locator said it was being sold there, only to find himself emptyhanded, the Journal reported.

&quot;The only reason I would ever set foot in a McDonald&apos;s is for the McRib,&quot; Russomano said. We just hope that as long as he was in Manhattan during his failed mission, he at least headed over to Blue Smoke restaurant, where barbecue ribs are never in short supply.

Honestly, I had to look on the little card they send with each meal to see what kind of meat it was, but once I tasted it I realized it was a McRib without the sauce. It was pretty good!

 10-14-2010 @ 4:47PM Irish Mist said... At Sam&apos;s Club I have bought a like sandwich to the McRib. I can&apos;t recall the brand name but there are (I think) 6 to the box and only have a touch of sauce on them. One can always dress them up as you want once they are heated up.
Here in Hawaii we have the apple pies as well as other varieties of pie as well. Right now they have the fried Blueberry pies on sale. Havae yet to see an old fav of mine..fried cherry pie. I am lookoing forwarad to the McRib and do hope that we get it next month as well.

 10-14-2010 @ 5:12PM Jo said... McRib is great but years ago McDonalds also had a steak sandwich that was even better. Haven&apos;t seen it since the &apos;70s but always hoping they would bring it around again. My friends and I would drive several miles to the nearest town with a McDonalds just to get one. Also, I think they ruined the apple and cherry pies when they went to the baked crust instead of the crispy fried crust they used to have. Maybe more calories, but who cares if you only have it once in a while for a treat!

 10-14-2010 @ 5:31PM E. Martinez said... While those other places may have something &quot;similar&quot; to the McRib, to me, a McRib ISN&apos;T a McRib WITHOUT the Mickey D&apos;s sauce!!! Whenever they&apos;re out, I always get them which isn&apos;t good for my bod but sure is good for my taste buds, lol. However, sometimes they come a little dry, even if you ask for extra sauce, trust me, I ask for it everytime and when I go to use their BBQ sauce for their nuggets or the BBQ sauce in my frig (I&apos;ve used different brands to boot), the McRib&apos;s just don&apos;t taste the same!! :( I would love to know what type of sauce they use so I could have a McRib whenever I wanted one. To bad I don&apos;t know anyone who works at a Mickey D&apos;s. If I did, I&apos;d be having one right now. LOL

So happy about this news. Marking the date now!! Enjoy your McRib&apos;s peeps. You know I&apos;m gonna...... :D

 10-14-2010 @ 6:49PM Ris said... I&apos;m so glad they&apos;re bringing McRib back. I don&apos;t understand why they wouldn&apos;t keep it on the menu forever. &quot;It doesn&apos;t sell because people get tired of it?&quot; Come on, people get tired of Big Macs too. I wish they had those burgers with melted cheese on rye all the time too. I love those. I don&apos;t go to McDonald&apos;s much anymore. Too many calories. But hey, I don&apos;t care about the McRib calories at this juncture!
