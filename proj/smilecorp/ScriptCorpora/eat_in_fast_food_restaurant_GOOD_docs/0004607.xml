 Funny fast food customers

 Funny fast food customers I&apos;ve worked primarily fast food since I was 16, so I&apos;ve had a lot of experiences with sucky customers. Over time I&apos;ve grown to find them more amusing than anything, and certainly not anything to get worked up about!

The following are funny stories that stand out from the rest in my experience as a fast food employee:

Senior coffees are SERIOUS BUSINESS :|

An old lady comes in and orders a cheeseburger, small fry, and senior coffee, which I ring up. I see that this costs four cents more than the all american meal, and proceed to change the order around thusly without saying anything. The all american meal can only be rung up with a drink costing 99 cents or more, and the 49 cent senior coffee can&apos;t be rung up with it. Either way, she is saving four cents. She comes up the the register after about ten minutes, her face red as a tomato and waving the reciept in front of her as if I could read it from across the lobby.
Old lady: I ASKED FOR A SENIOR COFFEE!!
Me: I know, but if I had rung you up for the senior coffee, it would have costs four cents more.
Old lady: SO A SENIOR COFFEE COSTS *MORE* THAN A REGULAR COFFEE????
Me: *shrinks back from spittle a bit* No Ma&apos;am, it just would have cost more to ring up the sandwich, fries, and drink separately...
Old lady: *color drains from face* Oh. *Waddles away*

I&apos;ve grown to love that type of reaction. It gives me heartjoy.

-------


But my kid is sick!

A woman comes through drive thru and orders a McNugget happy meal, I was on back booth at the time, taking orders and money. About 8 minutes later she comes through again, demanding to speak to a manager. Being a manager, I asked her what her complaint was. Apparently somebody had forgotten to drop the nuggets into the happy meal carton, so all she had was a small fry and a toy. She starts raving about a sick child with leukemia being disappointed because she couldn&apos;t have the comfort of a happy meal with nuggets, and it was a good thing that she happened to look inside the box before she got home. She demanded several free meals for having to wait in the drive thru line again, and the whole trouble in the first place. Management is only supposed to replace things, so I told her I could offer her a free happy meal on her next visit. She demanded to speak to my supervisor, who told her the same thing. We took her name and she skidded off with her nuggets. She probably told her kid how evil McDonald&apos;s is as soon as she got home, but she saved the day by &apos;putting us in our place&apos;.

-------

One Moment, PLEASE!

I was on back booth again, ordertaking and taking money. The person who had pulled up to the window to pay wanted to change their order at the window, so I was busy assisting them when a car pulled up to the speaker.
Me: *cheerful* Welcome to McDonald&apos;s, I&apos;ll be with you in a moment!
Customer: Yeah, can I get a... uh... number 2 with a...
Me: I&apos;m sorry Ma&apos;am, one moment please!
Customer: ...with a diet coke.... no, a sprite. Do y&apos;all have diet sprite?
Me: ONE. MOMENT. PLEASE.
Customer: And can I get a number 11 with a coke *drives off*

When she got up to the window, I had to ask her to repeat her order, since I had been occupied while she stated her order before. She holds out a check card without looking at me. I had to say very loudly&quot;MA&apos;AM, CAN YOU REPEAT YOUR ORDER?&quot;She looked at me and it turns out she was on a cell phone the entire time. She didn&apos;t even remember what she had ordered, and had to ask the person on the phone to tell her. CELL PHONES. BAH!


Which leads me to another thing that amuses/irks me.&quot;Can I get&quot;if you think about it, the customer is literally asking if they can retrieve or assemble the item themselves. I find I&apos;m extra helpful/cheerful to people who ask&quot;May I please have&quot;or even&quot;I want a&quot;, because those openings are at least not grammatically attrocious.

--------

FALSE ADVERTISING! I&apos;LL SUE!

So once again, working back booth. A woman comes through and asks for an extra large soda, I tell her we only have large, not extra large, which she accepts, then she drives up to the window. She then demands that I give her free things because we use false advertising.
Customer: But there are commercials on TV that say you have extra large sodas for a dollar!
Me: Our restaurant is not equipped to dispense 42 ounce drinks, Ma&apos;am, the cups are too big.
Customer: But it says on TV! Your store didn&apos;t have the one dollar six piece either, why is that? You guys are false advertisers! I want to talk to the store manager! I&apos;m going to sue!
Me: *very confused* The commercials say &apos;participating locations only&apos;.. we aren&apos;t misleading you Ma&apos;am.
Customer: I want something free to make up for this! I&apos;ll sue!
At this point she was hysterical and I went and got the store manager, he talked to her for five minutes and she drove off with nothing but the soda she ordered.

--------

False advertising part 2

A lady comes in and orders a small french fry, which I ring up. Then she hands me a Monopoly coupon, which would be well and fine, as we were still accepting them at the time, but her gamepiece was from 2004.
Me: Ma&apos;am, this coupon expired three years ago...
Customer: But you&apos;re running Monopoly right now, aren&apos;t you?
Me: Yes, but this coupon is from 2004, it was only good for a short time.
Customer: But I just saw you take a monopoly piece from that guy! *points at some random customer in the lobby*
Me: His gamepiece was current. *I hold up a cup with the current gamepieces on it to illustrate how different they look, hers are black, ours are green, and then I point again to the expiration date.*
Customer: But the signs on the windows say Monopoly is going right now! How can it not be current?? This is false advertising!

Eventually after talking to her for several minutes, and explaining how messed up the game would be if people could collect the properties over many years and still win prizes, she finally understood WHY the pieces expired, and eventually paid the dollar for the french fries.

-------

Chicken Fingers

This story goes back to my first job at Arby&apos;s, I was working drive thru about an hour before close, when a car comes through, rattling and booming music. They turned their music down when they got to the speaker, but it was still very loud.
Customer: Can I get forty chicken fingers?
Me: Are you sure you want that many? They&apos;re pretty big.
Customer: Yeah, the ten piece is only a dollar now ain&apos;t it?
Me: We don&apos;t have a ten piece, we&apos;ve got a four piece, and individual strips for $1.12 each.
Customer: That can&apos;t be right, the TV said they was a dollar.
After arguing back and forth about pricing, we rung her up for the 40 chicken fingers and it came to about $70. She kept on going on about false advertising and how management would be hearing about this tomorrow. She drove off without purchasing any of them, and we were stuck with forty chicken fingers still frying in the vats after she left. We all got to take chicken home that night.

We had suggested to the woman that she had the wrong restaurant, and that she most likely was thinking about McDonald&apos;s, the only restaurant we knew of that had a ten piece ANYTHING. She was awfully stubborn. When she talked to management the next day, she apparently felt very stupid. The managers laughed about it for weeks.

------

CUTE.

This isn&apos;t really a sucky customer story, but I thought it was hilariously adorable.

In the past, sometimes I find the way parents ask their children what they want in their happy meals annoying, you know &apos;do you want FRIES or APPLES&apos; and they&apos;ll draw it out and say it in a baby voice, to which the child does not really respond with what they think would taste better, but whichever word they think sounds cooler at the moment. We were all children once, we all did this. Usually &apos;apples&apos; is the more fun word to say. Anyways, a woman comes in with her daughter, and asks for a happy meal, and she asks her daughter &apos;do you want NUGGETS or a KRABBY PATTY?&apos; to which the daughter responded &apos;krabby patty!!&apos;

it was ADORABLE.

------

On the topic of happy meals, there are innumerable amounts of customers that come in and order them, but there is trouble when the toy comes up. This happens one of three ways:

Type 1:
Customer: Can I have a happy meal for a boy and a (insert several non-happy meal related items)
Me: What kind of happy meal did you want?
Customer: *suddenly realizes there are choices and takes a moment to decide*

because the gender of their child should always take precidence before what the child eats :|

type 2:
Customer: Can I have a Cheeseburger happy meal?
Me: Is that for a boy or girl?
Customer: *takes a minute or so to respond* uh.. boy?

it&apos;s a simple question. basically&quot;Please identify the gender of your child!&quot;

type 3: (thank goodness this is the rarest type)
Customer: Can I have a Cheeseburger happy meal, and I want a beanie baby toy. I know you have them in the back.
Me: I&apos;m pretty sure we ran out of those a year ago, but I can see what toys we do have back there, I think some polly pockets and lego are back there...
Customer: *completely ignores possibility that beanie babies aren&apos;t back there* Yes. Go check.
After returning with the selection of leftover toys in the back, none of which are beanie babies, I show them to the woman, who cancels her entire order, the food for which has been up for the entire time, and must be thrown out because it was all specially made with big mac sauce added to everything, and nobody else will order it the same way before it goes stale. She leaves in a huff, claiming that you are holding out on her and she will try a different store.

-------

Before I wrap this post up, I&apos;ll include a story from my brief employment at the local pet store. They sold puppies and kittens as well as some pet supplies.

A man comes in and buys an expensive Persian kitten, pays $1,200.00 for it. He is buying it for his girlfriend, who came in with him two days ago and wanted it. He fills out all the paperwork, loves on the kitten, is confused about the things regarding vet checks, but signs the papers anyway. He calls back not an hour after leaving the store demanding that he be able to return it because it is &apos;crazy&apos;
After several minutes of emphasizing our no returns policy, we get to talk to the girlfriend, whose piteous whining reveals the real reason for the trouble.

ITS EYES AREN&apos;T BLUE.

------

Updates:

So a guy came through drive-thru and ordered four double cheeseburgers without pickle, extra onion. He comes storming up to me and demands the sandwiches be remade, since we didn&apos;t do them right. He explained that he had asked for extra onions and we hadn&apos;t given him any. I told him we could either get him a side cup full of extra onions for him to add at his leisure, or they could remake the sandwiches. He demanded they be made fresh and he also wanted new fries since they&apos;d become cold since he picked up his order. No big deal, whatever. I chucked the order and called back the sandwiches, they guy wanted his fries without salt also, so we had to wait on fresh ones. The sandwiches came up, I&apos;d watched them make the sandwiches, so I was fairly confident he&apos;d be satisfied with these sandwiches. He opens one of the sandwiches and says we didn&apos;t put extra onions on again, that this is the same amount that was on there before.
I looked in the sandwich, there was easily three or four times the normal portion of onions on there, and I told him so. He demanded his money back since we couldn&apos;t give him his food the way he wanted it. I told him then that we could take the sandwiches back and put MORE onions on it, which he agreed to. The kitchen staff was confused, they knew there were already extra onions on there, I had to tell them EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA *EXTRA* onions. The man was satisfied with the sandwiches, finally, but then complained that there weren&apos;t enough fries in the fry boxes. That might have had something to do with him yanking the sandwiches out from under the fries and spilling them inside the bag, but I offered to top them off, provided he didn&apos;t mind that the fries I&apos;d top them off with had salt on them. At which point he stopped listening and started some tirade about how hard it was to get good service and get what you want, and how fast food kitchen employees can&apos;t understand english well enough to make the sandwiches correctly... I had to interrupt him to ask again, is it alright if the fries have salt on them. To his credit, he did not demand a new batch of saltless fries just to top these ones off.

To close off, before he left he said &apos;And I&apos;m really not a jerk. These are for my wife, she&apos;s pregnant.&apos; YEAH. RIGHT. Even if she was that horribly picky about her food, he had no right to go off on me about that, OR insult my kitchen staff. Your spouse&apos;s (who didn&apos;t even come to the store with you) phyiscal condition is no excuse for poor behavior, and should not give you such a sense of entitlement. I just kind of glowered at him as he left, and then we all laughed about it.

-------

Ridiculous kitten story - No SCs involved:

A man comes in with a load of kittens, all from the same litter. Two of them have point markings, you know the faded darker coloring around the nose, paws, and tail, like a siamese? Despite the former owner&apos;s lack of claiming that any of them were anything resembling purebred or even consciously bred, the petstore owner priced the two kittens with point coloring for two hundred more apiece, and put on the kennel they were in that they were &apos;half siamese&apos;, and therefore worth more. That still doesn&apos;t make any sense to me to this day. The kittens were certainly adorable, but I don&apos;t see how being HALF anything would make them worth more. just wrong on so many levels!

-------

It has CHEESE on it?

Today a woman came in and her son ordered &apos;a number 3, only ketchup and pickles&apos;, so I rang it up, she also ordered a number 3, without cheese. After her sandwiches were given to her, she came up looking like I had just kicked her puppy or something.
Customer: I wanted a Big n&apos; Tasty, and he wanted a Quarter Pounder with ONLY pickles and ketchup! (she then begins ranting about how we never get her order right)
I inspect the sandwiches, the Quarter pounder DOES only have ketchup and pickles on it.
Me: Ma&apos;am, this Quarter Pounder does only have ketchup and pickles on it
Customer: But it has CHEESE! He said ONLY ketchup and ONLY pickles, why does it have CHEESE? He didn&apos;t SAY he wanted CHEESE!
Me: ...The sandwich is called a Quarter Pounder WITH CHEESE, ordering a Quarter Pounder with cheese sandwich with only pickles and ketchup would have cheese on it, just like a cheeseburger with only ketchup and pickle would have cheese on it.
Customer: So you&apos;re telling me, that no matter what, I can&apos;t get what I want? What other sandwich has a big patty like that and doesn&apos;t come with cheese?
I won&apos;t bother with the rest of the dialogue, she looked like she was going to cry or something. Our store has removed the Quarter Pounder Hamburger from the menu, if that helps to explain, so all we have is the Quarter Pounder with cheese. At any rate, after she calmed down, and armed with the correct sandwiches, she was happy. She came up later and thanked me for being so helpful C: I wasn&apos;t short with her at any time during the entire exchange, nor was I annoyed afterwards, merely bewildered. She knows better now XD





And that&apos;s all for now. I&apos;ll add some more amusing stories as they occur, enjoy and be amused! Last edited by Elandora; 01-31-2008 at 08:02 AM .

 Of all those stories, this makes me want to beat those two with my desk. What a miserable, selfish, idiotic reason to upend the life of a small animal who can&apos;t fend for itself. I think I&apos;ll go do horrible things to my stress ball. __________________

 Poor kitten! I can only imagine their reaction to my cats (three legs and literally mentally retarded due to head trauma). I&apos;ve said it before, pets are not accessories. Ugh. Those people need to be barred from obtaining any animal, they&apos;re not going to treat it with the love it needs.

I always love the&quot;IT&apos;S FALSE ADVERTISING BECAUSE I DIDN&apos;T BOTHER READING THE WHOLE ADVERTISEMENT!&quot;people. They&apos;re classic. __________________

 While I love blue-eyed cats (Love me Siamese kitties an awful lot) to want to return a cat for something so petty is well beyond clueless.

(My current kitty has beautiful golden eyes.)

 OK, seriously, who the crap pay $1,200 for a KITTEN? You can get one for a lot cheaper at the SPCA. __________________

 I worked at McDs for several years, including as a crew trainer, so the whole time I was reading this I found myself nodding my head and going&quot;Yup, hated that, remember that...&quot;and so on. But Happy Meal related insanity was way high up on the list of things I disliked, right down to thoughtless jerks insisting I go search stock for discontinued or mega-popular happy meal toys. __________________

Thanks, and apologies for the Idiot thing. I thought it was supposed to be something from Real Life in BabyTalk.
