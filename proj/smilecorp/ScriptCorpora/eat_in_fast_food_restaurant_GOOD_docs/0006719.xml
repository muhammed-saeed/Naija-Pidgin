 Purchase Order Policy: 
 
 A net payment term is offered to qualified corporations.  To apply for a 
net payment term with us you must complete our credit 
application or use your own credit reference document. A net 30 is approved and no credit reference is required if the corporation is a Government, Public School, College, or University. All PO form(s) must include the following: 
 Letterhead PO number PO date of issue Billing address Shipping address Shipping method Net term of payment List of product code(s) and descriptions along with quantities Unit price of each product Shipping charge Total amount 
 Prices on website or negotiated prices must match prices on PO. If the preceding is not met, corrections are needed. Hand written corrections are acceptable with customer&apos;s initials. If a quote was given to the customer with discounted prices, the PO should indicate the quote number. If no quote number is indicated on the PO, the Account Manager should contact the customer to have PO revised. A revised PO with correct Shipping charges is needed if the Shipping charge is not indicated or incorrect on the PO form. There may be exceptions such as: 
 Website states &quot;Salesman will contact you with shipping charges&quot; Freight Prepaid noted on the PO Email confirmation of Shipping charge Customer&apos;s initial with hand written corrected Shipping charge UPS account number noted on PO Third party freight company noted on PO 
 If any blanket POs with multiple post-dates, the Account Manager must approve for making a proper arrangement. The PO will be on hold until payment on any past-due invoices are confirmed by our accounting department.
