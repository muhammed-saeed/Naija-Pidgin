I know some open too many restaurants too quickly (e.g., the still-barely-hanging-on Boston Market) while others lose control of their quality after they either get too big or get bought out by a larger company. There are also those that have great initial success but are eventually overwhelmed by changes in the very field they pioneered (e.g., Shakey&apos;s Pizza). Then, there are special cases like Wimpy&apos;s where, when the founder died, all locations in the U.S. where closed pursuant to his will. jsgoddess 12-08-2006, 01:54 PM Near where I live there is a Church&apos;s, an Arthur Treacher (great chips), a Rax, and there&apos;s a Godfather&apos;s Pizza in the Columbus airport.

There was a doughnut chain that made great crullers: Jolly Roger, that became Jolly Pirate, and now is, I think gone.

And another local chain was Sister&apos;s Chicken and Biscuits. I think they were completely gone for a while, but they have been recently resurrected by Massey&apos;s Pizza (though without the biscuits). But Massey&apos;s doesn&apos;t have that amazing rice. Sarahfeena 12-08-2006, 01:56 PM What a great Thread! OK, I&apos;ve scanned all of the replies and don&apos;t think I have seen:

JoJo&apos;s
Magic Pan
Chicken Unlimited

I currently work in a restaurant that used to be a JoJo&apos;s (complete with the circular windows). Magic Pan was that god-awful crepe place. My parents loved it! Chicken Unlimited existed in Chicago in the late 60&apos;s-early 70&apos;s. Competitor of Kentucky Fried Chicken

I noticed there are a few Illinoisans out here. Anyone remember a restaurant that used to exist called&quot;Grouper&apos;s?&quot;It was in Arlington Heights and they had awesome soup (served in a crock!). I don&apos;t think it was a chain, but I loved the place nonetheless and was wondering exactly where it was located.

This thread is so much fun and I am walking down memory lane! Dang...I grew up in AH&amp;Palatine, and I don&apos;t remember Grouper&apos;s at all! Where was it?

I heard that Magic Pan is coming back, by the way! UncleRojelio 12-08-2006, 02:07 PM Whataburger is, I would have to say, thriving. Locations (http://www.whataburger.com/one_near_you.php) are concentrated in the south, and Texas in general. Their page tells me that there are 6 within a 5 mile radius of my zipcode.I must be lucky. I have seven near my location. CalMeacham 12-08-2006, 02:17 PM And another local chain was Sister&apos;s Chicken and Biscuits.

Not that local -- there was one in Salt Lake City when I lived there. But I&apos;ve never seen another one. jsgoddess 12-08-2006, 02:25 PM Not that local -- there was one in Salt Lake City when I lived there. But I&apos;ve never seen another one.

Did you ever have the rice? It was great. CalMeacham 12-08-2006, 02:29 PM Did you ever have the rice? It was great.


Yep.


Sounds like the same place. RogueRacer 12-08-2006, 02:47 PM I recently read a quote in The Worst Places in America that Syracuse, New York is where rastaurant chains go to die. From what Central New Yorkers tell me, it&apos;s true or the most part; that chains like Ground Round, Lums, and others lived on in Syracuse long after the majority of other locations in the US closed.That&apos;s funny. Speaking of Ground Round specifically, we had a brand new one (new building and everything) open around here (western Cheesehead-land) about two to three years ago. I haven&apos;t bothered to go. The thing is, I was also going to mention that I knew there was one in Syracuse, NY too. People have also wondered about Friendly&apos;s. Those were around Syracuse too.

Maybe my area is also a last refuge for old chains. The town where I went to high school still has an old school A&amp;W drive up restaurant. It&apos;s been in business for at least 30 years that I remember. A new one was attempted in a nearby, larger town, but failed after two to three years.

Our Chi-Chi&apos;s was replaced by a chain called Carlos O&apos;Kelly&apos;s. I haven&apos;t went there. It seems to me that someone is confusing some ethnicity there or something. ;)

Regarding the Ponderosa/Bonanza thing, we had both in the 80&apos;s, operating at the same time. They seemed to be in competition. I remember it used to be great fun to take the whole pineapple (salad bar decoration) back to our table and start carving. fiddlesticks 12-08-2006, 04:22 PM There was a doughnut chain that made great crullers: Jolly Roger, that became Jolly Pirate, and now is, I think gone.

That reminded me of a donut shop from my old town, Mister Donut (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Donut). Interesting that it has mostly disappeared from North America but still can be found in Japan and El Salvador, of all places. They were okay (they specialized in the airy cream-filled varieties), but the best donut shop in town was a little bakery on the main downtown street that didn&apos;t survive the death of its owner. I can still remember its mouth-watering smell... BrainGlutton 12-08-2006, 04:36 PM Our Chi-Chi&apos;s was replaced by a chain called Carlos O&apos;Kelly&apos;s. I haven&apos;t went there.

What? You never had a corned beef and cabbage enchilada? MMMM! :) Spectre of Pithecanthropus 12-08-2006, 04:38 PM Wasn&apos;t there a Popeye&apos;s chicken once? I seem to recall going to several in the Los Angeles area a few decades ago for their popcorn shrimp.

And two other chains, perhaps small, in the LA area: Pioneer Chicken (bigger portions than KFC) and All-American Burger (burgers of the plump persuasion). One of each of those stores was on Sunset Blvd in Hollywood between Highland and La Brea, IIRC.

IIRC Popeye is still here, but all of the former All American Burger locations have now become Coffee Bean and Tree Leaf locations.

They were very nice, but said they had no plans to expand outside Florida. Can I open the same style restaurant, and use their concept (but with a slightly differnet name)?

I would say that you should make all the extraneous elements of your restaurant as different as possible. Choose the name of your restaurant to be as different as possible. Make the layout and the color scheme of your restaurant as different as possible. Make the names of the food items on your menu as different as possible, and make the ordering of the items on the menu as different as possible. The only points of similarity should be the choice and the quality of the food items, and even there you should try for some differences. You generally can&apos;t trademark a style of cooking unless it&apos;s utterly different from anything else in the world. dwc1970 12-09-2006, 01:27 PM I like a small franchise chain I saw in Florida-I called them up, and asked about opening a franchise in my state.

Sure, but if you do, be sure to use golden arcs-- not arches-- for your logo, call your signature product the&quot;Big Mick&quot;, and don&apos;t use sesame seed buns on it. Sarahfeena 12-09-2006, 02:10 PM My husband just reminded me of a chain that is all but dead...a hamburger and ice cream place here in the Chicago area called Cock Robin. There used to be a bunch of them, but 2 that were near us recently closed, and I think there is only one restaurant left, in Brookfield, IL.

I liked it when I was a kid because the ice cream scoops were square! Dr_Paprika 12-10-2006, 01:10 AM I came in to this thread to mourn the loss of Ontario&apos;s Mother&apos;s Pizza, Red Barn, Godfather&apos;s Pizza... but have been beaten to the punch.

Some chains I thought were dead are not -- Suisha Gardens, Ponderosa, Kenny Roger&apos;s Roasters...

Some defunct restaurants seemed like chains but might not be -- Pizzapax, Great Scott Pizza... devilsknew 12-10-2006, 06:06 AM I think there was a Burger Chain called Top Hat that is now defunct. I&apos;m not sure, but I used to see them, never been in one.

There was also a Kewpee&apos;s Hamburger franchise with locations in Ohio and Michigan that I think has gone the way of the dodo. Great, basic, burgers.

I&apos;m trying to think of the name of a Steakhouse franchise from a few years back that I believe tried to take on Outback and lost. I think they no longer exist. They had great rib-in Prime Rib, skin-on&quot;smashed&quot;potatoes, even lambchops. It was a modern steakhouse ala Outback but I believe they had a&quot;Yukon&quot;or&quot;Great White North&quot;theme. A bit more pricey than Outback but they had better food. Anyone remember it? Papermache Prince 12-10-2006, 06:17 AM If the steakhouse you&apos;re thinking of is Bugaboo Creek Steakhouse (http://www.bugaboocreeksteakhouse.com/locations/main.asp), they still have locations in several Eastern states.

Nope, that was definitely not the name. For some reason, I want to say that it was named after somebody, I think it had a Proper noun in there. I&apos;m gonna go nuts if I can&apos;t think of the name! :smack: Asgardking 12-10-2006, 06:42 AM Were Daly drive in local to Detroit. There may be 1 left. IHOP is disappearing here. Taco Bell used to be big, Oh wait that was too soon. If they are blamed for killing a few they will be in trouble. Jack in The Box was done in by wiping out a few customers.

There&apos;s at least one in Livonia, although it&apos;s not a drive up anymore. Livonia law prohibits eating in parked cars. As far as I&apos;m concerned, Daly has the best salad bar in existance.

How about Bill Knapps? There used to be a few around here but no more. They&apos;re big gimmick was that on your birthday you got a percentage off your meal equal to your age. So of course older people liked it better. All I really remember about the place was it served tiny portions. I always left hungry. Asgardking 12-10-2006, 06:45 AM And another local chain was Sister&apos;s Chicken and Biscuits. I think they were completely gone for a while, but they have been recently resurrected by Massey&apos;s Pizza (though without the biscuits). But Massey&apos;s doesn&apos;t have that amazing rice.

They had Sister&apos;s in the Detroit area as well. When I was young and my dad and brother would go off to scout camp, my mom and I would always go to Sisters. I agree the rice was fantastic and also the spicy chicken.

In fact, the place where it used to be has gone through several other restaurants over the years. I always think of Sisters when I drive by. devilsknew 12-10-2006, 06:52 AM .

Ah, I was wrong. They are still around (http://www.kewpee.com/history.php). Yay!

A classic burger, you can taste the history in these burgers.

Prince,
Thanks for reminding me of this place. I thought this was among the least appealing name for an overpriced, run-of-the-mill family steakhouse. Among the last thing I want associated with my food is bugs! I&apos;d like to see how THAT name got through the focus groups.

I also must have repressed that memory, because I thought I&apos;d visited the apparently non-existent LaCrosse, Wisconsin location. I never would have eaten there on my own but I was traveling on business. And curious if complimentary Deep Woods Off wipes came with the meal. devilsknew 12-10-2006, 06:56 AM All together the Kewpee has been in operation for over 70 years. It is part of a small franchise. It is one of the oldest franchises in the country and had over 200 restaurants east of the Mississippi before WWII. That&apos;s 25-30 years before the first McDonald&apos;s opened it&apos;s doors. Most of those Kewpee&apos;s closed during the war when ground meat was so hard to get. There are only six Kewpee&apos;s left now. The headquarters is located in Lima, Ohio which is the site of three Kewpee&apos;s. The other two Kewpee&apos;s are in Lansing, Michigan.

Cool. Ohio is the keeper of the classic burger. Khadaji 12-10-2006, 09:26 AM I seem to remember a steakhouse, not unlike Hoss&apos;, called BOSS. Beer Onions Steak and Salad. All you could drink if I recall. Did I dream this or did it actually exist? devilsknew 12-10-2006, 10:00 AM I figured out the name of the The Steakhouse! It&apos;s Mountain Jack&apos;s.

Boss had a few places in New York City (I recall their TV ad circa 1980 featuring characters who were supposed to be Daddy Warbucks (from Annie), Darcula, and Sherlock Holmes (from Crucifer of Blood, because this was after the Royal Shakespeare Company&apos;s Sherlock Holmes had departed) from their respective Broadway shows discussing popping into a nearby BOSS for a bite after the show.) I never heard of any outside the city, though. scotandrsn 12-10-2006, 09:15 PM There was a small chain of diners around the Boston area called Bergson&apos;s. The one in my town made some of the best burgers I ever tasted, and we always used to get their ice cream.

At some point they opened a separate, higher class establishment in Westboro called Bergson&apos;s 1790 House (http://1790restaurant.com/index.php) and that&apos;s the only trace left that the chain ever existed. An Arky 12-11-2006, 07:10 AM The Mr. Donut in the town where I grew up is still a donut shop, and still makes the same donuts. It&apos;s now called Spunky Dunkers, and it is the best!

Burger Chef took McDonalds on whem McDs was running roughshod over the competition. Bad timing kills restaurants. Growing too fast will kill them too.
While Taco Bell is alive and well ,they may be getting into a rough spot. Killing a few customers is frowned on. Jack in the Box is a case in point.
In Dearborn area Burger King is losing out. A cpuple have closed . One mear my house,I contend was killed by the employees. They ended dining room eating very early and relied on drive in windpws. The orders were always screwed up. My dad ate there a lot and finally gave up on them. Nothing pisses customers off more than driving home ,opening the bag and the food is wrong. devilsknew 12-11-2006, 11:21 AM I love Steak &apos;n&apos; Shake and White Castle, but I can&apos;t get them around here. I have to grab what I can on my trips back to the midwest.

Ah, White Castle Butter Burgers! Yes, they are still around in my neck of the woods.

Does anyone know why they call them Butter Burgers? I asked my Mom, and she thinks it was because they buttered and toasted their buns on the grill. (The hedonist in me is hoping the real reason is because they fry them in butter.)

Would any burger joint have the balls to do that, nowadays... I wonder? Hell, that could be the basis for a new Burger joint/franchise in backlash to the new trend in laws restricting unhealthy fat consumption. Big quarter pound burgers fried in a quarter pound of butter. Of course it&apos;s not kosher, but I say embrace your selling point-- On the marquis:&quot;DK&apos;s Butterburgers- We&apos;re not Kosher.

Anyway, White Tower has delicious Hamburgers. I have some fond memories of riding downtown with my Mom and Grandma at 2 or 3 in the morning when I was younger and getting Butterburgers from White Tower and then cruising the Hookers, Pimps, and Streetwalkers. Good times, Good Times.
(We would just cruise around the backstreets and watch the nightlife, not actually pick up prostitutes. It was educational and entertaining in the way that the big city educates and entertains. Scary sometimes, too.) Missy2U 12-11-2006, 11:36 AM devilsknew, Culver&apos;s calls them ButterBurgers (it&apos;s a registered trademark) because they lightly butter and toast the crown of the bun.

The only times I&apos;ve ever eaten at Ground Round were in Syracuse (but the last time was some time in the early 90&apos;s.) My mom and I were amazed when we saw a storefront for one in the Albany area last year, but there were absolutely no cars in the lot so we assumed it had closed even though all the signs were up and it still looked well-kept: may have just closed recently (or maybe still open?)

My bad. I am talking about White Tower not White Castle. Although our town got it&apos;s first White Castle a couple years back. The sliders are good but the Butterburger is a better burger. AskNott 12-11-2006, 02:14 PM There are some big companies that own a handful of eatery chains (General Foods, IIRC.) Sometimes, you&apos;ll see a restaurant close, only to reopen with a new name, format, and decor, but it didn&apos;t change hands at all.

If you&apos;re interested in the saga of Ray Kroc and McDonald&apos;s, you&apos;ll find Mark Knopfler&apos;s song Boom, Like That, based on the story, entertaining.

Brain Glutton, one big reason for chains disappearing is that other chains buy them. Burger Chef, where I had my first job, was bought by Hardee&apos;s, and most of them became Hardee&apos;s places.

Here in Anderson, the Mister Donut shops dropped the franchise. They&apos;re now Nick&apos;s Donuts, which also sells pizza! Two of the three KFCs are closed. One was razed, and a McD&apos;s stands there now. The other just opened as a Mexican joint. ChiChi&apos;s is gone, and the building is now a Legion hall. Popeye&apos;s closed, and is still empty. We had two Ponderosas once. One is divided into a liquor store and a rent-to-own place. The other is now a Mexican restaurante, La Charreada.

Haven&apos;t seen a white tower in years, so maybe they are gone now?

Damn, I hate it when they (the franchises) just kind of die a slow death and then poof, they&apos;re gone. It&apos;s unsettling. Wendell Wagner 12-11-2006, 08:17 PM devilsknew writes:

When I was growing up in Hancock County, Ohio, we all thought that the hamburgers at Wilson&apos;s Sandwich Shop in Findlay were great. I have no idea whether I&apos;d think they&apos;re great today. I haven&apos;t had one for umpty-ump years. I didn&apos;t even know whether the sandwich shop was still open now or even remember the name exactly until five minutes ago when I did a search on hamburgers and Findlay.

In Northeast Florida, those who have traveled up and down US 1 might remember
a bunch of signs near St. Augustine touting a certain&quot;David Johnson&apos;s&quot;restaurant
(and tourist trap). The design was similar enough to that of HoJo&apos;s that that, and the

been close to a decade ago) but the business had long since closed. Asgardking 12-11-2006, 10:21 PM Yea. :smack:
My bad. I am talking about White Tower not White Castle. Although our town got it&apos;s first White Castle a couple years back. The sliders are good but the Butterburger is a better burger.


The concept of sliders being good completely eludes me. When forced to go to White Castle, I stick with the chicken rings. ExTank 12-11-2006, 11:08 PM We had a Lum&apos;s in Cahokia, IL, of all places. It went under in the late 70&apos;s though; it couldn&apos;t compete with the Bonanza next door.

CalMeacham: as myskepticsight says, Houlihan&apos;s is still around. There&apos;s at least three more in the St. Louis area: Chesterfield Mall, Olive (just west of 270), and west Watson Rd (again, in the mall).

I can make a meal just out of their &apos;shrooms. Never had a bad meal there, but their menu seems to be going a tad artsy in the last few years.

Dooku: wasn&apos;t there a Naugles (or something like) at 40 and Grand back in the mid/late 80s?


This thread has been a great read whilst I was stuck on a conference call, but my Og: where&apos;s the love for Olga&apos;s Kitchen (http://www.olgaskitchen.com/)?

The love for Olga&apos;s is alive and well in Fairview Heights, IL, my friend. It&apos;s been a family fave since it opened is St. Clair Square shopping mall in &apos;77 or &apos;78. My only complaint is that they stopped serving alcohol (beer and wine only). bdgr 12-12-2006, 12:50 AM Big Boy restaurants still exists, some under the Bob&apos;s franchise, some under the various other franchises that existed at one time or another. Around these parts, it was Frisch&apos;s; not sure if they still have that name attached or not. Elias Bros. was the franchisee in Michigan; they bought the Big Boy umbrells company from Mariott&apos;s in 1987, but went bankrupt in 2000. Robert Ligget bought the umbrella company, now called Bob&apos;s Big Boy International. Shoney&apos;s still operates numerous Big Boy&apos;s in the south.
Around here it used to be kips.

Nevermind, nothing is worth a trip to Barstow.

There are Big Boy restaurants all around, only with different names attached to them- the Ohio-Indiana area is Frisch&apos;s Big Boy. Been a favorite of mine since I was a wee friar. elmwood 12-12-2006, 11:54 AM The one old farts in Buffalo seem to look back on in fond reverence was Deco, a chain of eat-in short-order diners which had about 50 locations in the city limits. The chain&apos;s heydays were during the 1940s and 1950s, and the last one closed in 1979. The chain&apos;s disappearance was blamed on location; a disproportionately large number of Deco locations were in blue-collar neighborhoods and industrial districts that were hit hard by Buffalo&apos;s post-WWII economic decline, and the chain never expanded to the growing suburbs.

Another chain that was common in the early 1970s was Henry&apos;s Hamburgers. My grandmother always took me there. It was a step up from McDonalds because it had indoor seating; all stools permanently attached to the floor. Quasimodem 12-12-2006, 12:27 PM If Shakey&apos;s Pizza has already been mentioned, please excuse the post, but I used to love that place.

They are not really&quot;defunct&quot;, but the restaurants are spaced so far apart, they may as well be. (They&apos;re a big hit in Thailand!)

About a mil will get you a franchise.

The Dixieland jazz, and the picnic table atmosphere coupled with the delicious pizza and beer-cooked hot dogs made it one of my favorite places.

There&apos;s one in Georgia, but it&apos;s about a 300 mile drive from where I live.

Thanks

Ponderosa is pretty much thriving here, but the suspicion is that will only be until we get a Golden Corrall.

I&apos;d heard of but never seen a Bonanza restaurant. Something I liked about the
old Ponderosa theme was it being modeled after a ranch food hall, with pseudo-rough wooden tables and benches, and your meat served still sizzling in these metal-in-wooden-trays. I really miss those.

&gt;Ohio is the keeper of the classic burger.

When I was growing up in Hancock County, Ohio, we all thought that the hamburgers at Wilson&apos;s Sandwich Shop in Findlay were great. I have no idea whether I&apos;d think they&apos;re great today. I haven&apos;t had one for umpty-ump years. I didn&apos;t even know whether the sandwich shop was still open now or even remember the name exactly until five minutes ago when I did a search on hamburgers and Findlay. I discovered the strangest thing:

http://local.yahoo.com/details?id=11069963

It&apos;s a review of a restaurant in the West Village in Manhattan in which someone compares the hamburgers there to Wilson&apos;s in Findlay.

I can vouche that Wilson&apos;s Burgers have withstood the test of time. I first had them a few years ago, and they are definitely a great burger to my adult tastebuds. As good as when you were a kid? I couldn&apos;t say... nothing&apos;s quite as good as a memory.

The taste of memories, that&apos;s what this thread is really about. Most of the actual quality and taste of these franchises from our childhood or from years back is relative to the memories. The time, the place, the taste, the experience. I mean, how great can a Hamburger or Hot Dog really be? At one time and place, it was the best Hamburger or Hot Dog you had ever had and will ever have. It&apos;d be great to relive it, but I doubt it will ever be the same. ((**Indian Tear** (70&apos;s reference.))

I have a friend that&apos;s from Findlay and she&apos;s made some great memories for me of a little Dairy Queen that is run by some relatives of the Wilson&apos;s Sandwich Shop clan, I can&apos;t think of the name of the place off hand (Dietsch&apos;s maybe, or Jolly Dipper?), but they have Hamburgers almost identical to Wilson&apos;s. Delicious--- sooo good! But I think what made them great was the person I was with and the memories I&apos;ll always have of that time, smell, conversation, taste, place, and influence. Swoon...

Ever had Jac and Do&apos;s pizza, Wendell? Good stuff. Sarahfeena 12-13-2006, 01:33 PM Bimbo&apos;s is gone. I remember it too! There is a small strip shopping center there (with a Starbuck&apos;s). It is somewhat adjacent to the Home Depot. Of course, there had to be a Starbuck&apos;s, right? Too bad about Bimbos...that was some good Italian food.

In the strip mall down the street (on the other side of Dundee), there used to be a pizza place called Geppeto&apos;s. They had good pizza, and their gimmick was that they showed old movies&amp;cartoons (like The 3 Stooges&amp;old Road Runner cartoons) in the dining area. They also had a bunch of pinball machines (no video games in those days!) We LOVED that place when we were kids.

Slight hijack because it wasn&apos;t a chain, but some of the best places we used to eat in are gone. :( Acsenray 12-13-2006, 01:55 PM They had good pizza, and their gimmick was that they showed old movies&amp;cartoons (like The 3 Stooges&amp;old Road Runner cartoons) in the dining area.

Yea, they did. There was a huge Little Ceasars that I went to as a kid back in the 80&apos;s. I mean, it was the size of a wedding hall, really big, nothing like the tiny shopfronts that Little Ceasers dispenses from today. They had movie nights on Friday or Saturday nights and showed old Abbott and Costello Movies, and Old Serials, and Cartoons on a big screen projector TV. It was Great! But even better than that, they had an early Electronic version skeet shooting game. They had a freestanding console with a pair of modified&quot;shotguns&quot;holstered on each side. A little projected light disk representing the clay pigeon would swoop across a big white screen on the wall across from the console. And you would take your shots and watch the light turn into a comics POW disintegration. The game would get progressively harder with more clay pigeons at faster and faster rates.

I also used to love The Ground Round (free popcorn and peanuts!) but Wikipedia says there&apos;s still a few dozen of them around, so they (barely) don&apos;t qualify.

And I am sure many more. It seems our suburban sprawl is just the right incubator for these types of chains. We have a large enough market to do media, a car culture that makes roadside food a must, and a lifestyle that gets us out of the house. DSYoungEsq 12-20-2006, 02:44 PM White Castle hails from Columbus, as well as Wendy&apos;s. I am not aware of any other major chain that operates from there. Actually, Southern California should be called the franchise restaurant capital of the world. Chains originating here:

McDonald&apos;s
Taco Bell
Del Taco
IHOP
In-N-Out
Farmer Boys

There is? I looked it up in my phone book and don&apos;t see it. Can you tell me where? I&apos;m always looking for new places to eat.

I remember seeing Lums in Pburgh all the time but my grandpa never took us there. I&apos;ll have to see if he&apos;ll take me on my next visit.

The only restaurant I miss is Chuck&apos;s Steakhouse.
Someone told me once that it was a chain but I&apos;ve never seen another. It used to reside in the Auburn Mall (Mass). They had an excellent buffet, the first buffet I ever went to actually. My mom used to work there when I was a wee lass and we lived in Auburn. We were dirt poor so she choose to work there for the free meals. She would take us because there was a massive price reduction for young children. They had the best steak fries ever. Oooooo, the huge buttered rolls - dipped in thick mushroom gravy, YUM!

I think I&apos;m gonna cry now.

I still remember being a little kid (living in Worcester) and spending my Saturday&apos;s with my mom. Before we could afford a car, we&apos;d take the bus to Auburn. We&apos;d go to the library, play at the playground at the high school, walk to the flea market (gone now), and walk back to the mall for dinner at Chucks. Sometimes if we had extra money, we&apos;d get a small Orange Julius and share it. My sisters never wanted to go with us so it was our own special time. When we got a car, we&apos;d hit all the yard sales between our house and the mall, then hit the library, playground and the flea market. We&apos;d always end up at Chucks.

Once, when I was in my late teens, my mom and I spend a Saturday the way we had when I was a kid. We hadn&apos;t taken a bus together in years and we hadn&apos;t even been to the mall without my stepdad since I was 13. On that day, we did all the things we used to do, including walking our now fat selves to the flea market and back. When we got to the mall, we realized that Chucks was gone. We both got quite teary-eyed at the realization that our tradition was just a fond memory. I think my mom was depressed at the passage of time and how it changes our lives. I was depressed at the loss of such a huge part of my childhood.

I will never forget those days. Even now, when I&apos;m almost 27 and am living 50 miles away, I still drive to Worcester at least once a month. I pick up my mom and take her to any place she desires. One year, I took a Saturday off from work so we could spend the day yardsaling. Sometimes we drive an hour to get to a faraway mall, sometimes we just stay in Worcester. We still finish up by eating dinner together. The restaurants change with almost every visit and none seem to taste as good as Chucks. But, it&apos;s a way to carry on the tradition and I&apos;m happy with it.

There is a chain called Chuck&apos;s Steakhouse and there&apos;s even one in Southwick. But, the one in Auburn changed it&apos;s name to just Chuck&apos;s before closing for good, so I don&apos;t think they&apos;re the same. alphawulf 12-21-2006, 12:21 AM We had a few Taco Tico s on the north central Gulf of Mexico coast until Katrina--lots of Taco Bells remain. Crystal was like White Castle and may have been local--had better burgers--Down here we also had Frostop which is still around in a few places but they don&apos;t have their signature frozen mugs of root beer anymore. Mahaloth 12-21-2006, 08:17 AM Little Caesars mainly seems to operate inside Kmarts now.




Really? It&apos;s a Michigan chain originally and they are everywhere here. The owner/founder of Little Caesars owns the Detroit Tigers and Red Wings.

Zombie thread! I&apos;m sure it&apos;s been stated already is this thread, but the last existing Sambo&apos;s is here in Santa Barbara where it all started. It&apos;s run by the son of one of the founders and actually has a sort of upscale menu that is well regarded locally. The kid also ran a hipster restaurant called Chad&apos;s where they had catatonia inducing martinis and a happy hour full of hot hot women.

Back in the early 70s, I was one of about 7 kids in my Dallas elementary school that were picked to sing the jingle for a Herfy&apos;s Hamburgers commercial, even though the chain was in Houston. If I remember correctly, our music teacher, Mrs. Johnson, was recommended to the commercial company by the school district, and she had two seventh graders, two sixth graders, two fifth graders, two fourth graders, and myself from the third grade called into her classroom to audition for the guys. The song she had me sing to audition (she didn&apos;t know that I had the single at home and knew the song by heart) was Bobby Sherman&apos;s&quot;Seattle.&quot;

We were all selected, and here&apos;s the jingle...

&quot;It&apos;s the magic at Herfy&apos;s. Herfy&apos;s Magic Meal. It&apos;s a hamburger, french fries, and Coca-Cola and it comes with a magic surpri-ise!&quot;

I wonder if that&apos;s still on tape somewhere out there.

Last time I was home in Ft Worth, TX, there was still Church&apos;s Fried Chicken. chcrawfish 10-08-2009, 11:35 AM Taco Tico--Crystal hamburgers--Jim Dandy Fried Chicken--I miss Crystal and the corn fritters at Jim Dandy

That was the first chain that I remember being able to get regular or spicey fried chicken. runner pat 10-08-2009, 11:38 AM There was a chain that catered to zombies.

I worked at Steak&amp;Ale in Dallas and in San Antonio. Back then it was one of the chains run by the Brinker family of Dallas. S&amp;A Corp also ran Bennigan&apos;s and took over Chili&apos;s early on. Many of the menu items were the same at Steak&amp;Ale and Bennigan&apos;s, so the wait staffs and cooks could cover for each other&apos;s Christmas parties. chcrawfish 10-08-2009, 11:42 AM Arthur Treacher&apos;s Fish and Chips- are they still around? Used to like their hot dog in the fried fish batter when I was small.

The Red Barn- my sister worked their in high school and we got all the Popeye (I think) glasses!

There&apos;s an Arthur Treacher&apos;s in Franklin Mills Mall in Filthadelphia. It is AWFUL! chcrawfish 10-08-2009, 11:49 AM Also there was Shakey&apos;s Pizza (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakey&apos;s_Pizza) but apparently there are still some of those around. That was another place for family night&apos;s out.

Shakey&apos;s Pizza on Northwest Highway in Dallas was my absolute favorite place as a kid. A trip there was my reward for a great report card. Haven&apos;t seen them since the mid-70s, although Wiki says there are still about 68 in the US (almost all in California). chcrawfish 10-08-2009, 11:53 AM the Houlihan&apos;s have pretty much disappeared, too.



Houlihans is still going strong in this area (northern suburbs of Filthadelphia). A new one opened up about 2.5 years ago in Warrington, PA, and that parking lot is quite full every night.

Please note that, until you re-awakened this thread, the last prior post was over a year ago (Sept 2008), so don&apos;t be surprised if some of the people posting don&apos;t respond -- they may no longer be posting here, they may not be reading the thread, etc.

Anyhow, there are lots of other interesting threads and discussions as well, so we hope you&apos;ll explore around a bit and make yourself at home.

SmellMyWort: I&apos;m not quite sure what to make of your comment, it&apos;s not exactly a nice way to welcome a newcomer to the boards, is it? This is a long thread, and it&apos;s not surprising that a new poster would make multiple posts. It&apos;s neither a sin nor a rules violation. :) chcrawfish 10-08-2009, 01:26 PM Before Long John Silver&apos;s and Cap&apos;n D&apos;s, there was a fish and chips chain called H. Salt, Ltd. . Anyone remember that?

That&apos;s where I fell in love with Malt Vinegar. They were better than Long John&apos;s. chcrawfish 10-08-2009, 01:28 PM CK,
I found this thread through a Google search for Herfy&apos;s hamburgers. A co-worker had pulled up a website with commercials from the 70s and 80s, and it just got me thinkin... typoink 10-08-2009, 03:55 PM There&apos;s a Bob&apos;s Big Boy about 4 miles from here. Still have that red relish on the Big Boy Burger, too.

I wish Made-Rite still had locations in SoCal. Memories of childhood...

Wow, they just opened a Maid-Rite less than a block from my office (Chicago suburbs). Tasty, odd sandwiches -- I didn&apos;t realize they were actually old. I figured they were faux-retro.

I definitely miss Chi-Chi&apos;s. It was the only Mexican I got as a kid, and I miss their particular brand of inauthenticity. :) The sombrero-shaped menus really made it feel genuine when I was 7. SmellMyWort 10-08-2009, 04:47 PM Sorry about that, I had no ill intent and didn&apos;t notice that chcrawfish is a new poster.

My comment was meant to be along the lines of&quot;Chug, chug, chug... or go, go go...&quot;in a sense rooting for a poster who seemed quite excited about the topic. I probably should have punctuated with :D to clarify my meaning.

And welcome to the SDMB, chcrawfish! Yummmm, crawfish... ralph124c 10-08-2009, 07:21 PM This chain vanished 6 years ago (in the Boston, MA, area).

You are evil.




There was a very small MIchigan chain that I think has disappeared: Hot N Now (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_&apos;n_Now). how awesome of a name is that?

Their prices were awesome. Drive thru service that has never been beaten by any of the big three ( Mc Donald&apos;s/ BK or Wendy&apos;s) and the food was really good. Wolverine 10-08-2009, 09:47 PM I came to mention Chi-Chi&apos;s (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Chi&apos;s) which closed all its U.S. stores in 2004. Apparently they lasted longer than I knew (the one&apos;s in the Detroit area closed in the mid-1990&apos;s). There are still a few opened overseas though.

Never mind. I only clicked on the main page, not realizing it was 8 pages long. I did a quick search and didn&apos;t see anything posted without reading the entire thing.

Man, that is too bad-the Velvet Turtle had an awesome Steak diane! What a shame.:( jed67 07-10-2010, 02:56 AM OMG, I&apos;ve been reading this thread and have just been amazed at all the chains I remember; I&apos;ve been to way too many of them, but Pewter Pot really caught my eye. They had the absolute BEST muffins in the entire world!

I went to college in Rhode Island (URI) and went up to MA one day for some long-forgotten reason, I ended up stopping at the Pewter Pot in Braintree. I loved the muffins so much I subsequently made trips there specifically to buy muffins! Long way to go for muffins, but well worth it :D

I remember Pewter Pot; my mother would take me there when she was shopping, either Weymouth or Braintree, MA.

Does anyone remember York Steak House? or maybe Rustler Steak House? jed67 07-10-2010, 03:00 AM I&apos;d remembered the name&quot;Victoria Station&quot;but no details. There&apos;s a book - Prime Rib&amp;Box Cars: Whatever Happened to Victoria Station? (http://www.vicsta.com/toc.html)

I remember Victoria Station, there was one on the North Shore in MA.

Does anyone remember Pebbles in FL? jed67 07-10-2010, 03:05 AM Lum&apos;s is alive and well in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We used to lunch there a few years back: flat soda but decent stick to your ribs grub.

I particularly miss Bojangles, which was thriving down here when I was a kid. It was a chicken and biscuits chain with amazing sausage biscuits! And there was Wuv&apos;s, a burger and fries chain that&apos;s long extinct. And how come I can&apos;t find a Steak n&apos; Shake east of Sawgrass? I love SnS.

Bojangle&apos;s just opened a new store in Altamonte Springs, FL and we use to have a Lum&apos;s in Hingham, MA jed67 07-10-2010, 03:12 AM I remember Bonanza. As I recall, they got bought out by Ponderosa Steakhouse (or at least all the ones in my area did.)

Come to think of it, I haven&apos;t seen a Ponderosa in a month of Sundays, either.

Bonanza&apos;s still exist, Google their website. jed67 07-10-2010, 03:14 AM No, they&apos;re gone. There is a chain in PA/NJ using the Horn and Hardart name, but they&apos;re not automats and merely bought the name when the company went under.

Other NYC chains that are no more include Needick&apos;s (great hamburgers and orange drink) and Chock Full &apos;O Nuts Coffee Shop (though the coffee is still around, and they let you sell it in independent stores).

When I tried them, it was clear that Wetson&apos;s had the worst fries in the history of the universe. They were not only bad, but they were the worst of all possible fries. Think of undercooked potatoes fried in motor oil and served with a side of axle grease and you begin to get the flavor. :eek:

&quot;come on down to Hardee&apos;s, where the burgers are charcoal-broiled!&quot; jed67 07-10-2010, 03:16 AM When I lived there, there was Maryland Fried Chicken (http://www.agilitynut.com/05/1/mdfried.jpg), with outlets that looked like they haven&apos;t been touched since they were built in 1963.

I stopped at a Maryland&apos;s cause it always smells so good; I left when I saw how nasty it was inside!! jed67 07-10-2010, 03:18 AM You live in Casselberry?
I used to live there.

does anyone remember Chun King in Casselberry, FL? jed67 07-10-2010, 03:20 AM Ponderosa still has a few locations under the&quot;Bonanza&quot;name. Actually, I could never tell the difference between the two. Were they ever really two distinct places?

yes, they both still exist; there is a Ponderosa on I-drive in Orlando. jed67 07-10-2010, 03:21 AM Out in Salt Lake there used to be a chain of Big Barn or Red Barn or something lik that. For all I know they still exist someplace, but they&apos;re gone from SLC. Some of their signs showed up at an independent burger joint (with the trademark names, like&quot;Big Barny&quot;, crossed out). One Chinese restaurant I liked was made out of an old Big Barn. I didn&apos;t realize this until I stood way back from it one day and noticed that the new facade covered the front of a barn-shaped building.






One chain tat seems to have disappeared is York Steak House, which used to be in the Northeast. Quick and inexpensive steaks, with nice salads and desserts. I kinda miss them.

Yes!! there was one in Hanover, MA jed67 07-10-2010, 03:24 AM Does anyone remember Village Inn restaurants? I remember one in the Tampa area. jed67 07-10-2010, 03:28 AM Taco Tico--Crystal hamburgers--Jim Dandy Fried Chicken--I miss Crystal and the corn fritters at Jim Dandy

do you mean Krystal&apos;s Burgers? they still exist. jed67 07-10-2010, 03:34 AM Does anyone remember Red Coach Grille? even sven 07-10-2010, 03:39 AM Another chain that hasn&apos;t quite gone away, but that is the process is Shakey&apos;s Pizza. We had one in my town as a kid with a player piano. I had my birthday there once.

Shakey&apos;s is HUGE in the Philippines. You can also go to Tower Records there and feel like you are in retro-Sacramento paradise. Acsenray 07-10-2010, 08:14 AM Duff&apos;s Smorgasbord? Siam Sam 07-10-2010, 09:44 AM If Shakey&apos;s Pizza has already been mentioned, please excuse the post, but I used to love that place.

They are not really&quot;defunct&quot;, but the restaurants are spaced so far apart, they may as well be. (They&apos;re a big hit in Thailand!)

Alas! I believe they have exited the kingdom. Actually, the only one I knew of was in Siam Square, and I believe it closed down even before you made that post some years ago.

But back to the OP: I have fond memories of Burger Chef from when I was a child. I would love to try it again. Jamodu Green 07-10-2010, 10:53 AM In Australia, Chilis no longer operates.

Sam - The Shakey&apos;s I go to occasionally is still alive, if barely kicking. Ought to stop by for the lunch buffet sometime soon, just to see if it&apos;s still as bad as it once was. Siam Sam 07-10-2010, 11:02 AM We had Shakey&apos;s in West Texas too, and I thought it not bad pizza, although it seemed to garner a lot of disrespect.

As for Starbucks mentioned earlier, there are more than 100 in Thailand, and they are going strong. In Winnipeg 07-10-2010, 11:58 AM I remember when I was growing up in Vancouver in the early 70s, there was this chain of drive-ins called&quot;The Texan&quot;.

Where I live, Spokane, a new Shakey&apos;s just opened thereby marking their return to the area after nearly 25 years. I haven&apos;t been there yet but the radio ads Shakey&apos;s has been running seem to emphasize their lunch buffet over their pizza.

One thing that seemed to hurt Shakey&apos;s was the fact that, unlike their competitors, they didn&apos;t deliver. I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ve changed their no-delivery policy in the last 20 years.

There are also several Village Inns. silenus 07-14-2010, 06:34 PM All sorts of Maries around SoCal. KimmyT 09-02-2010, 09:52 PM Does anyone remember a restaurant from 70&apos;s called Jacks R Better? There was one by Crestwood plaza in St. Louis County,Mo. It was kinda like Ground Round. Also in the same area was a Flaming Pit steak House. I believe it shut down in the early 80&apos;s.

I believe it shut down in the early 80&apos;s.I remember Flaming Pit -- several outlets around St. Louis IIRC, and one of my favorite upper-class establishments when I was there. Can&apos;t remember Jacks, tho. california jobcase 09-02-2010, 10:23 PM The following may be Indiana chains.

Penguin Point - had good double cheeseburgers
Mister Fifteen, later Burger Man (later Mac&apos;s? I remember that&apos;s what some of them became)
Frendly Fosters- a White Castle clone

I know Taco Tico was mentioned a few years ago in this thread. I liked it better than Taco Bell because you could order mild, hot, or extra hot, and they had chili and tamales.

I miss restaurants. I can&apos;t eat out much because of heart troubles and a low-sodium diet. ThisSpaceForRent 09-02-2010, 11:05 PM Does anyone remember Red Coach Grille?

The only&quot;Red Coach&quot;I knew of was&quot;Wayne&apos;s Red Coach&quot;in Springfield IL...It was not a chain though. I worked there...

Any one remember Heritage House Smorgasbord? Worked there too!

tsfr elmwood 09-02-2010, 11:33 PM Swiss Chalet closed all their locations in Buffalo, and thus all their outlets in the United States, not too long ago. Montana&apos;s Steakhouse, another Canadian chain, closed all of their Buffalo locations a couple of years ago. The lone 241 Pizza in the US, on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo, is now a locally-owned calzone joint. Kelsey&apos;s Buffalo locations are also all closed.

The American chains mostly steer clear of Buffalo, and the Canadian chains, with the exception of Tim Horton&apos;s and Jack Astor&apos;s, have all pulled out of the area.

Darth Nader 09-03-2010, 01:12 AM Okay, not a chain (there was one other in Longmont, maybe.)

Boulder: Back around Q*Bert time ,or maybe it was Tempest O&apos;Clock, and the freakin&apos; coolest place to eat ever. Tucked back in a strip mall that had both waterbeds and telescopes for sale.

Inside? The regular booths and tables on on side, set at many levels, with mirrors and plants and stairs that were never close to code to confuse things. Past the giant baseball mitt next to the Crystal Castles machine-- a multi level bar, with free cocktail munchies, and more.

While I&apos;m getting all nostalgic-- If the Dark Horse ever closes, I&apos;ll pee in the wrong room for a week.

KimmyT 09-03-2010, 07:28 PM Jacks R Better was on Watson road across the street from the Old savings and loan, right before the first mall entrance to the parking lot at Stixx Buer and Fuller (Dillards). It was kinda like Ground Round with the peanuts and shells every where. The sign had a jack off a playing card and playing cards The R was reversed. No wonder they went out of Business, everyone I ask thinks Im crazy but of course my brother and parents remember. Beware of Doug 09-03-2010, 08:54 PM Recovered memory of Lums here. I lived in Buffalo as a toddler in 1969-&apos;70, and Lums hot dogs were a real treat. Had mom and dad known that the puppies were cooked in beer, they might have saved me from a lifetime of alcohol abuse. :D Pepper1152 10-05-2010, 08:05 AM Does anyone remember a hot roast beef chain back in the &apos;60s called Gentleman Jim&apos;s? I am 99% sure that was the name of it but I can&apos;t find anything on the web. Gilliver 10-05-2010, 10:02 AM I was going to ask if anyone else remembered&quot;Round the Corner&quot;, a small chain in Colorado back in the 80&apos;s... After a quick google, I found this: Benjaman Kyle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjaman_Kyle). Holy shit.

That guy sure looks familiar. Maybe he just has one of those faces.... Darryl Lict 10-06-2010, 04:50 PM I remember a chain in Wisconsin (and elsewhere, maybe), in the 70s, that sold pies. And coffee.

Although mention has been made of Poppin&apos; Fresh/Bakers Square, there was also a chain called House of Pies.
I loved House of Pies when I was a kid. Banana cream pie! It looks like one still exists in L.A., but apparently, they can&apos;t pull together a real website (http://houseofpiesrestaurant.com/).

I think I may have to wander down to Sambo&apos;s for old times sake. Qadgop the Mercotan 10-06-2010, 04:57 PM Anybody here remember Laughner&apos;s Cafeterias in Indiana? I believe they&apos;re all gone now.

I hope I didn&apos;t ask this earlier in this thread&apos;s childhood.... ladeda 10-06-2010, 05:14 PM We used to go to Rustler&apos;s Steakhouse when I was a kid. I don&apos;t think they are around anymore.

Also, as several people mentioned, Gino&apos;s no longer exists. But that&apos;s where Kentucky Fried Chicken started from I think. Could be wrong. Wendell Wagner 10-06-2010, 06:04 PM No, Kentucky Fried Chicken did not start from Gino&apos;s. The company that owned Gino&apos;s also owned the franchise for KFC in one area, but they did not in any sense start KFC:

There was one by Crestwood plaza in St. Louis County,Mo. It was kinda like Ground Round. Also in the same area was a Flaming Pit steak House. I believe it shut down in the early 80&apos;s.

I remember Jacks or Better. There was one on Watson road in Crestwood (the building is still there, it&apos;s medical offices and a Ryder truck rental now) and there was another one on Manchester Road in the Rock Hill area. What I remember most vividly about the place was it was the first restaurant I ever saw of the &apos;throw the peanut shells on the floor&apos; variety.

Flaming Pit was all over the St. Louis area. They were one of my parents&apos; favorites. I can recall two other locations (one on Manchester in Des Peres and one on Chippewa near Hampton) and there were surely more. What I recall most about them is the &apos;treasure chest&apos; kids could pick a toy from at the end of the meal. Cool stuff when you&apos;re ten. :-) Little Nemo 10-06-2010, 10:35 PM A 2010 update in case anyone was planning a roadtrip: the Lums in Elmira and Plattsburgh have closed since I originally posted in this thread in 2006. Chefguy 10-07-2010, 09:10 AM I was fairly certain that Arctic Circle drive-ins were long defunct, but apparently they are alive and well. Sort of.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino&apos;s_Hamburgers

I used to work for Gino&apos;s HQ in King of Prussia. They also owned the Rustler Steakhouse chain. Gino&apos;s was different than many of the chains in that the corporation owned all of the outlets instead of franchising the stores to individual owners. We did a massive weekly payroll on punched cards. The KFC franchise was in a limited area. They seem to be restarting now as a franchised operation, adding the tagline &apos;Burgers and Chicken&apos; to the name Gino&apos;s. Adopting the name Gino&apos;s in 1957 makes them one of the oldest of the chains in the modern fast food category. Tangent 10-07-2010, 04:13 PM How about Tippin&apos;s Restaurant and Pies? I&apos;m not sure if I ever actually ate at the restaurant, but a Tippin&apos;s pie was a special treat at my house when we were growing up. The local one closed down many years ago. ladeda 10-07-2010, 04:29 PM No, Kentucky Fried Chicken did not start from Gino&apos;s.

Ah thanks for the correction. I just remember Colonel Sanders on the Gino&apos;s menu in Delaware. krisalyx 06-30-2011, 12:05 PM gods here in va i can remember most of these chains like lums, burger chef,sambo&apos;s (unfortunally) bob&apos;s big boy, kenny rogers

(and yes strangly enough kr&apos;s are still around but mostly in &apos;NOVA) (that&apos;s northern va ya&apos;ll)

and churches fried chicken they&apos;re still around here in va and the same for popeye&apos;s here (through here in va they&apos;ve gone bankrupt and still came back as well)

gods i can remember ferrels ice cream (giggle) very old timey but still a good place to spend a sunday afternoon,

and we also had &apos;po folks as well but now they&apos;re only in florida and &apos;bama only,

oh and shakeys pizza as well, yep and stuckeys and RAX are still around, i&apos;d stoped at two stuckeys in north and south carolina last summer not the same as the originals but they STILL had the same stuff.

oh and about DUFF&apos;s i saw one a few years back in (blush) pidgon forge tennessee yep it might be the only one left but who knows,

and about ferrels they&apos;re also still around mostlly on the west coast i think in la or portland i think.

and the only green burito location in the south is co-branded with a hardee&apos;s just outside of myrtle beach sc.

here in va we used to have what-a-burger, i&apos;d seen a photo of a newer one built in south carolina but bugger all if i can remember i seem to think it was in clemson but i could be wrong.

oh and about what-a-burger there&apos;s two different companys using the names what-a-burger has locations in va and the carolinas but whataburger is a west coast chain not conected to the east coast branch (confusing yep just wikied it and it&apos;s a bit of a mess to untangle through) Mahaloth 06-30-2011, 12:10 PM Did they serve zombie meat or any capital letters? Cartooniverse 06-30-2011, 12:30 PM White Castle? Sure. It&apos;s at 21-01 Broadway, Astoria, New York. --gag-- Universally regarded as the edible solution for the irksome personal problem of severe constipation, this chain keeps gamely slugging along. To the last, every experience with White Castle&apos;s trademarked steamed burgers has been a....uh.... liberating experience. :eek:

Gino&apos;s Burgers and Chicken (http://www.zagat.com/buzz/ginos-burgers-chicken-rises-from-the-dead), famous from Maryland to Pennsylvania, has returned. Wonder how it fared. I grew up in Philly, and there was a Gino&apos;s on Cheltenham Avenue. I think it turned into a Colonel Sander&apos;s Kentucky Fried Chicken. Decades ago, of course.

On Preview: TriPolar covered some of this. :) chaoticbear 06-30-2011, 02:56 PM I looked online and there&apos;s still one open in my state: Fazoli&apos;s. Looks like they are doing OK nationally, but I can name ::counts:: 5 locations that have gone belly-up, 3 of which are within about 40 miles of me. I never found the story, but I guess it was an owner/operator who went broke. :(

There&apos;s nine of those still open up and down the Front Range. Push You Down 06-30-2011, 06:25 PM Was it not called a suicide everywhere? I was born just south of Fort Worth and always called it that. That was back in the days when different places felt different, before the internet and tv made everything uniform over the last 10 years.

We called them Graveyards growing up. Voyager 06-30-2011, 07:08 PM Marie Callendars seems to be on its way out. They&apos;ve close pretty much all of them near me. One they closed with people still in the restaurant, and shooed a birthday celebration out the door. Without paying, I trust, but that wasn&apos;t mentioned in the article. mmucpu 07-06-2011, 09:35 PM I&apos;ve seen Arthur Treecher&apos;s and Church&apos;s Fried Chickens in NYC.


I used to work for a small chain called Chi-Chi&apos;s. I think they have all followed my advice and gone to hell.

Chi-Chi&apos;s was pretty big. It was started by a retired Green Bay Packer of fame and served&quot;Mexican&quot;food...

Some of them, at first, were not bad... but that didn&apos;t last and my wife and I both spent one of the sickest nights of our life after our final dinner at one, both having had the exact same meal.

I have no sense of loss... mmucpu 07-06-2011, 09:37 PM Little Caesars mainly seems to operate inside Kmarts now.


Pittsburgh Dopers will remember this one-Isaly&apos;s (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaly%27s). Inventors of the Klondike Bar, they also popularized chip-chopped ham. When I was little, there was one just down the street from where we lived and my mom used to take me in to get ice cream sometimes-and we ALWAYS had chipped ham for sandwiches.



(And my great-uncle Joe&apos;s first wife was Mr. Isaly&apos;s secretary, back in the 1960s).

Little Caesar&apos;s originated in the Detroit Area and are thriving here (for debatable reasons)... I have travelled extensively but have never seen one in a Kmart that would be worth a giggle Ponch8 07-06-2011, 10:02 PM Does anyone remember Red Coach Grille?

Only from the early rap song&quot;The Breaks&quot;by Kurtis Blow. The verse concerns a seemingly wonderful boyfriend who turns out to be a real sleazebag.&quot;He took you out to the Red Coach Grille, but he forgot the cash and you paid the bill....He told you the story about his life, but he forgot the part about his wife.&quot;I first heard this song about 5 years ago and loved it immediately, which is very rare for me. (I usually have to listen to a song a few times before I decide I like it.) OttoDaFe 07-06-2011, 10:45 PM Little Caesars mainly seems to operate inside Kmarts now.

They&apos;ve since graduated to storefronts and seem to be doing quite well. FordTaurusSHO94 07-07-2011, 12:06 AM There&apos;s a Little Caesar&apos;s about every 15 miles around here. A Hot&apos;n&apos;Ready isn&apos;t the best pizza, but for $5 and it being instantly ready, it&apos;s hard to beat. srvfan 02-12-2012, 11:34 PM Does anyone remember a restaurant from 70&apos;s called Jacks R Better? There was one by Crestwood plaza in St. Louis County,Mo. It was kinda like Ground Round. Also in the same area was a Flaming Pit steak House. I believe it shut down in the early 80&apos;s.
We built a house off Big Bend Road in Ballwin around 1972. I remember just before moving in 1975, my mom going here with some of her friends and then we went too as a family. I remember the peanuts on the floor and a great Reuben sandwich. It seems like it was a pub-type atmosphere with lots of dark wood, but then again, I was only about 6-7 years old. I remember the whole area was new. Lots of homes going up. I went to Hanna Woods School and it had only been open for a couple of years then. This is not a restaurant, however, I was wondering if anyone remembers a drug store or variety store on Manchester Road named Katz or something like that. I remember they had one or two cats on their sign. I remember going in there and playing with this tube tester machine. BTW, I would almost kill for a Mr. Steak Continental!!! Been trying to have my wife make this for over 23 years! vBulletin®v3.7.3, Copyright©2000-2012, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.
