 Paid Traffic in Solo Ads for your MLM Business 
 Published by Antonio in Paid Traffic on July 11th, 2012 | No Comments» 
 If you spend any amount of time in your MLM business, right now STOP reading and ask yourself what do you do on a daily basis that actually brings people to your business to sign up. If you said I tell a few people at work, or I get in conversations while I’m out and about, that is good; it is good because it is something. I do not want you to get confused that buying business cards was actually doing business.

It’s not.

One of the things that really ends entrepreneurs business hopes and this is not just for home business owners (like me) or traditional business owners; but they do have a constant daily operation that they perform. Going out and talking to people while you’re out and about will cause you to be out and about every day in order to prospect…and that is if you actually open your mouth.

Well, if you want to get something consistent, blogging is the definite way to go. Just blog about your company and the products on a consistent basis and that will give you a lot of leverage. However, you also want to get into the paid traffic methods (and don’t you go running out the room). When I use to think of paid traffic, all I could think of was Google and their home-business-shut-down-operation. The thing is that there are plenty more websites and paid media methods that can turn around nice profits for you.

One of the methods I use and have seen plenty of industry “heavyweights” use is something called SOLO-ADS . Solo ads is an advertisement sent to a newsletter email list or to an ezine with your ad on it for your offer. It’s pretty simple when you think about it. You write and email and give it to a guy or guy who has a loyal targeted list of potential customers; and they send it to their list on your behalf.

It is third party verification on steroids. You have credibility because you paid him to talk to his people on your behalf. These things usually cost around $100 and can go up to $500 dollars or more. The bigger or more responsive the list you are renting, the higher it may cost. You simply gotta shop around for good deals and avoid landmine or sharks. The best part about paid traffic in solo ads is that it is not a lot of work. The most laborist part is shopping for a good list that is available to run solo ads on.

Once you begin to grow your own list, you can now begin to do ad swaps so that you do not necessarily have to paid, you can just barter. This will build you a list and help you venture with other ezine or newsletter list holders.

You can learn more on this topic and more by signing up for my free newsletter where I hope webinars for my subscribers teaching all kinds of great marketing stuff. My partners and I have a wide range of things you can be sure to benefit from; so sign up today and watch a free video on how to create Instant MLM Cash for your business.

 Making Your Business Appealing 
 Published by Antonio in MLM Training on June 19th, 2012 | No Comments» 
 Lot’s of people that get into MLM, Network Marketing, direct sales, or a home business do one thing that you see at Catholic or private schools… they all dress the same .

It’s getting to be like corporate America,“you need to wear this tie, dark suit, etc., etc.–there is no originality. Then every once in a while, a guy comes into the game with baggy shorts, wristband on his forearm, got his own brand shoes, taking the basketball appeal to another level.

So this is what you must do with your business. Make it look good . Customers want to buy for someone and companies that look good. Face it we’re all a bit superficial, guys are going to check out the girl that looks good; they don’t go for the average girl–even if she is a great fit for the guy, guys almost always go for the model first.

So the same principle goes now for your business. Make it sexy; dress it up a bit, make your business more appealing to attract more people to it.  So just dress it up a bit; make your home business more appealing to your prospects and customers. To do this best, you have to exhibit your personality more into your MLM business .

Don’t be like the other stiffs, be yourself–the you that you like to shelter only for your friends and family.

 Use of the Internet for MLM Business 
 Published by Antonio in Internet Marketing , Prospecting , Traffic Generation on May 18th, 2012 | No Comments» 
Get Involved
 
Why do you need the Internet for a massively successful MLM business? The answers to that question can fill 12 volumes of books. Learning how to properly use the internet as a skill set is a MUST. The state of the internet is at an all time high and it is only going to get bigger. Your future business partners and customers are online waiting to run into you, but you have to be in position to take advantage. In this article, we’ll talk about why this needs to be a skill set you master for your Network Marketing business

 

The first reason is because of the reach. Scottie Pippen is a Hall of Fame Basketball player and a six-time NBA champion of the Chicago Bulls. Before all of his greatness, he was known as the skinny kid with the long arms. His reach was helpful to him because he could get steals and rebounds based on those long arms. The internet becomes your Scottie Pippen . You will be able to reach more of your potential customers and prospects by being properly positioned online. Even if you were able to get your entire city into your business, you’d max out. The internet is sort of an infinite reach of cities.

 

Which leads to the next reason you need to master the internet; you can literally go and promote directly in the city you want. You do not have to live in Detroit to grow a solid team there thanks to the internet. And with some of the methods we’ll discuss in a bit, it will make growing a team in a different area a total cinch.

 

Measurability is also very important for the internet as a skill set. You are able to track, measure, and analyze metrics far better than any other form of marketing. This is one reason why growing a business online is so simple; it is because you can measure things to remove what does not work and intensify things that are working. With tools like Google Analytics, we are able to measure tons of metrics that go on, on our websites.

 

The last reason why you need to learn the internet as a skill set is because the internet is the best possible employee in the world. The internet works twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. It works 24-7 around the clock. I sit back some evenings or wake up the following morning to find I have ‘X’ amount of leads or made ‘such-and-such’ amount of money. Can you imagine going to sleep with $5793.23 cents in your bank account and waking up with $8549.55 cents? That would be $2756.32 dollars you made over night while you were dreaming .

 

So what are the specific skills you need to learn online? The first skill I’d heavily invest in is in copy writing . As I mentioned previously, if you command the ability to become a salesman in print online, it is like printing your own money . You will be able to sale on demand and that is important. Once you have a website that you know is cleverly and expertly copy-written, now you can send good traffic to the website and that will help it convert very well. Traffic sources include, article writing , blogging, newsletter advertising, paid traffic , paid media, and search marketing (PPC, PPM).

 

Getting and keeping your internet marketing efforts in good shape allows you to become the expert you need to be. This will translate into good money, a growing business, and a hefty residual income for your MLM business.

 The Use of the Phone for MLM 
 Published by Antonio in MLM Training , Prospecting on May 9th, 2012 | No Comments» 
Say it with me...the Phone is My Friend
 
If you’re in a MLM program business opportunity , then the use of the phone is still critical for your success in business. With the advent and massive use of the internet, many people believe they can sit back and hide behind the internet and ‘poof’ people will join their business day in and day out. The truth of the matter is that this does and can happen, but the percentages are so much lower than integrating a full marketing program and full use of all the tools necessary to really win in MLM.

When you think of phone use in MLM, it is not just for calling and dialing leads. There are four main functions of the phone that make it vital for you to get over fears of it, and get used to dealing with it. It is necessary for the success of your MLM Business.

 The first and main use of the phone for MLM business is for outbound calls. The name of the MLM game is exposure. How effective are you in getting your business in front of people. One of the chief ways to do this is to purchase leads constantly and call them. You are not trying to recruit them into your business (no, no). Instead you want to simply have a conversation with them. Find out what they want, and if you have what they want take them to the next step.

If you do not have what they want begin to create it so as you speak with more people, you can have it ready. Ultimately, dialing leads, prospecting, whatever you want to call it is basically data collection. You should really be surveying people and leading them to the presentation of your business opportunity or products and services.

You’ll also need to learn how to handle inbound calls . People will want to call you and speak with you for various reasons. You need to learn how to take calls professionally and learn to also use these as data collection and opportunities to close people into your business or onto your service.

Many times people will call you just to see if you’re a real person. Taking their calls is a great way to get them on the phone, and as you know, no one walks on a car lot that is not looking to buy a car. Practicing and learning the skills necessary for inbound calls is an important aspect of the use of the phone for your MLM business .

You’ll also need to know how to use the phone to conduct customer service. You will have customers and although they can contact your supplier, you also want to have them contact you for certain types of issues. It may be something you can help them with about your company’s product or service or about your training program. As you develop a customer service line, you’ll pick up a frequently asked questions list for your product or service and for your business opportunity. Use this on your website once you’ve received a lot of feedback. However, this is a definite reason why you must get comfortable on the phone for your business.

The last reason for the use of a phone for MLM or home business is for team trainings . You will ultimately want and need to set up a team training system to continue the success of your business. These will take place over the phone or via the web through webinars. However, you have to be comfortable on the phone to have successful team training and conferences.
 
Learning this skill set will help the development of a team
 
The use of the phone for MLM business is crucial. The phone and business are related and no one can get away from it. You can dodge for a while, but a six-figure business is going to take you learning how to handle the phone. This is a skill-set you must grasp in order to take your business to another level. Once you have mastered it, it is time to train not only your down-line, but a virtual assistant who will handle your calls as your business begins to really grow. This is when you outsource it and only deal with five percent of all the calls needed to be made and received. This is the first and most important skill-set to develop.

 Learning a Skill Set for Your MLM Business 
 Published by Antonio in Leadership , MLM Training on May 2nd, 2012 | No Comments» 
Learning Skill Sets to Play
 
As you mature in MLM you should get far away from ‘pipe-dreams’ and making money over night . While bumping into the right person or the luck of utilizing a system will help bring all the success in the world to you rather quickly; the numbers don’t lie in how often that will happen. Mature professional network marketers do not live on recruiting friends and family, and they do not turn into fulltime coaches once they have recruited their three to five business partners. Professionals in MLM have done what all professionals have done or do; they go to school to learn and develop skill-sets in order to be the best professional they can be.

 

Once they have these skills, they actually implement them and from this they set a salary for themselves that can have limits beyond the moon you see in the sky. If you are going to school to be a Doctor, depending on which focus you target there are certain courses and proficiencies you would have to master in order to pass. We would not allow a surgeon who has not mastered his craft to work on us. A divorce attorney is not the attorney to select for a murder trial. For a murder trial you need an attorney that has the skill set to defend you. In MLM people want to partner with men and women who know what they are doing because such a leader has learned and used methods to large success.

 

Here are the three major things you certainly need to learn very well to operate a successful home based business. You MUST learn how to handle to phone . Even if you are 1000% sure you do not want to call leads, you still must learn how. The reason is simple; first when you develop a great amount of leads online, you may have to take a few inbound calls of people being sure you are who your website says you are. Major prospects may call you to get a few final questions answered about your business. You have to be good with the phone to do this. Second, if you outsource this, you’d better know what you’re doing or have your system together to have to someone else take and make your calls. This will take you having experience on the phone to train others.

 

The second major skill you MUST adopt is the ability to handle the internet . Online business is huge! You’re going to need to know how to put a website together and utilize all the tools that go with making it a good website. You will need to learn all the marketing techniques out there and tools to get quality traffic to your site so you can take full advantage of the internet. The internet will become 85% of your business if you systemize it correctly. Learning the internet so well is what allowed me to start my very own Local Marketing Company .

 

The final skill set is mastering salesmanship in print. They call this copywriting (different than a copyright). Copywriting is a skill using psychological triggers to help an interested prospect become extremely interested in order for them to buy your product, service, or opportunity. Special words, structure of your presentation and so on make this a definite skill to adopt. This is an extremely vital skill, in fact, if you learn this very skill well; you will not have a difficult time at all being successful in business period.

 

In all when you have these skill sets mastered, you will be super successful with your MLM business. Take quality courses and implement them as you learn them. It is literally like watching a baby learn to walk; they wobble and fall to begin but soon they have it down to a tee. Online MLM training , the telephone, and copywriting are your keys to wealth in MLM. Leadership along with those three skill sets is your ticket to a successful home based business. Of course there are details to learn within these three areas, so learn them and begin to implement them.

 2 Ways to Increase Ability to Tolerate Things 
 Published by Antonio in Leadership on April 18th, 2012 | 1 Comment» 
Learn to Tolerate
 
We are not born with the capability to do all things. We’re not born perfect. The way I learned this was through the Hall of Fame basketball legend of Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan was incomparable on the hardwood, but on other fields things were very challenging for him. What he achieved on the basketball court was awesome, nevertheless when he tried it in baseball a superhero-type man was reduced to training wheels. Michael is the current owner and head operational man for the Charlotte Bobcats, who boast a record worst season in 2012. From this mere example, you can see or will see why it is important to increase your tolerance levels.

 

There are two primary focuses that will help you make the changes of more tolerance in your life and business. The first is that intolerance is a type of a lack of knowledge. Before one can find lasting success they first must master intolerance. Intolerance is the chief element for discrepancy, struggles, and even the deadly of them all, war. You will create enemies at your job and in your MLM business because of intolerance; and it will get worse for you because it has done so for organized society. Intolerance pushes all reason aside and this leads to mayhem and ruin.

 

The second focus is that narrow-mindedness is the major collapsing force the organized entities of religion, business, and government fall for. These entities are set up to bring order and justice. However, with intolerance they are full of contempt and fight. Hindrance of progress on world and national levels will encumber your success at the individual level. This is why this subject affects you, even in your MLM business and it is vital to increase your ability to tolerate things.

 

In order for this to make more sense, let me give you constructive ways for you to learn how to tolerate things better. Implementing is always harder than talking, so here is the best way to go about it. In the Michael Jordan example, Michael was a very dominant basketball player. He played with guys who were not as good as he and had to learn to tolerate their limitations. You may have to do this with your business. And this is how; you have to place yourself in the shoes or situation of other people before you will truly understand and learn to have tolerance for them. It is imperative to know what other people are working with.

 

Full cooperation is the second order of interests and implementation. When we have the evil desire to take advantage of people at their expense, we tend to stir up incongruities and resentment. This is similar to recruiting people into your business for the sole purpose of overriding their efforts without you helping to provide assistance for them. If you ditch all efforts to be supportive and to lead them, this is selfish and will not be tolerated at length by your team. Instead, you should devise a plan for new recruits to become successful for your business and theirs, make them accountable as well as yourself to gain full cooperation.

It is not the author’s intention to convey you allow yourself to be taken advantage of for the sake of being tolerant. However, in order to have enduring success with your MLM business and in life, it is imperative you broaden your open-mindedness levels. Don’t live in ignorance and yield to the failing force behind world conflicts by being intolerant. Put into practice fortitude with others and with business associates and customers, by placing yourself in their shoes, seeing things from their angle. This will allow you to be a very victorious leader with business and in life.

 Curb Your Enthusiasm 
 Published by Antonio in Leadership on March 20th, 2012 | No Comments» 
 
Have a Ball with Enthusiasm
 Hi, I’m Antonio Dannes operator of Online MLM Training .  I want to let you know how EXCITED I am to share with you an article I published today on StreetArticles.com .  You are probably familiar with the hit TV series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, starring Larry David.  Well, it is true; we all must curb our enthusiasm in certain situations.  However, it is not the case when it comes to your network marketing business.

 

Here at online MLM training, we definitely know that a good amount of excitement is instrumental in having a thriving business.  Excitement and enthusiasm is what helps people thrive, pick up momentum, and feel more energized.  In basketball games, when an opposing team scores a couple of points in a row, the coach usually calls a timeout to not only get his team regrouped, but to slow the momentum and enthusiasm of the crowd.

 

This is how important having enthusiasm is to have and maintain.  If you learn to use it when you are talking about your MLM business, it will help you get more people excited about what you have to offer.  Visit street articles and view my recent article titled; Do Not Curb Your Enthusiasm .  Thanks for visiting today; see you next time.

 The Habit of Saving Money 
 Published by Antonio in Leadership on January 20th, 2012 | No Comments» 
New Post...just for you
 
Hi readers,

 

Today I wrote a great article today on the great habit of saving money for your MLM business as a attribute that will help you excel in business.  I believe this is a golden habit to pick up because you will get some much out of it.  Discipline, order, money saved, and the ability to have stored funds to do what must be done.  Sure it will take a while to start up, but it can and will grow at a great weight once it gets, moving and remains consistent.

 

 I need you to do me a great favor once you go check the article out at my favorite article directory, Street Articles dot com. Share it , tweet it, plus one it , and leave comments as usual.  Love you all and keep attacking your goals with reckless abandon.  Make 2012 the year you slap every difficulty in the face and attain what you want.

 

I promise we’re going to move into more tactical stuff in the coming days; but the ground work of leadership, initiative, and mental attitude is just as important.  Take care

 The Use of Imagination and Creativity 
 Published by Antonio in Leadership , MLM Training on January 13th, 2012 | No Comments» 
Imagination and Creativity
 
The use of your own imagination can help you very intuitively in the world we live in, in many ways.  Many of us face a reality of bills, illness, lack of money, and the hardships that face us daily.  With your imagination and creativity, you can change all of this in your own mind.  Have you ever walked down the street and seen someone totally in their own world?  Insane asylums are loaded with people who live in a completely different world mentally.  I am not suggesting you go crazy.  I am however suggesting you use your creativity and imagination in a control version of the people in insane asylums (J).

 

For example, in your MLM business you first use your imagination to create in your mind what you want your business to be.  This includes how much money you make, how many hours you work, the style of business you conduct, the type of people you recruit, the way you find customers, the way you handle your customers, and the list goes on.  The more detailed you make it, the better.  You want absolutely no limits to your imagination in this area.  As you do this, commit it to paper adding to it as your imagination leads you and then you read it every day and every evening before retiring for the night.

 

The imagination and the consistent reading over it will allow your brain to take form of what you want.  It is like driving a black Dodge Challenger SRT8, after you’ve made the purchase all-of-the-sudden, you notice a lot more Dodge Challengers on the road.  The brain has taken subconscious note of what you’re paying attention to and consciously made you aware of it at a higher intensity.

 

This will help you run into answers to what your business looks like.  For instance, you say, “I work my business in my home office on my laptop and I use Google Adwords to drive traffic to my website.”  You may have never used or studied Google Adwords prior to and certainly do not know the ropes of how to use it as an advertising medium.

 

However, when you use your imagination pointing out Google Adwords as one of the means of your business; you will sooner or later run into a newsletter or website that teaches you how to use this medium affectively.  Further, you may collide with a friend or pal or acquaintance online that is proficient in it and you can pay them to implement it for you.  This is how the use of your imagination works.  All you need is the idea, the thought of what you want, of how you imagine things to go and your brain will begin to gravitate it to you.  It will take constantly reviewing it and emotionally imagining these things for it to come sooner.

 

For my MLM business, I wanted a website that would express all of my companies products, and another website that would address major health issues that certain products can and will address (this company is a wellness company).  I imagined I would get traffic by writing on these subjects and topics, use banner advertising, and pay per click, FaceBook, twitter, video marketing, article marketing, and more.  I imagined myself working 3 hours a day, with a team of outsourcers focusing on some of the other things mentioned above.  I also imagined myself making 25 phone calls a day and receiving 15 to 25 calls of eager customers and/or business associates asking for products or to join me in my endeavor.

 

I imagined a bookkeeper helping me with my money management, and a virtual assistant to help me with customer service and any other thing that came up in the business.  I imagined, initially, earning $25k per month and that I am at the top position in the MLM company.  I currently have most of these things going on as you read and I am certainly gravitating the rest, but all of it began in my mind.  Most of which, I did not know exactly how to do it, or how I would pull it off.  I did not stress myself about it because I knew that simply getting the image in my mind would get the wheels turning.

 

The next part once the wheels begin to turn is to get real creative with it.  When I use to work downtown on my J-O-B, I noticed after getting off the train the same “homeless” people nearly stationed at the same location every day.  Previously I’d imagine my flyers going all across town, but I did not have the money to pay a street team to do it.  So my creativity kicked in and I thought, let me hire the homeless guy to do the work.  I put aside 20 bucks, ten up front and ten once I got off work, for him to hand these flyers out to as many people as he could.

 

This turn a profit for me and it also helped me help the homeless.  A double win-win in my book, but it all started with imagination and creativity.  These two things will carry your mlm-business into higher levels you may not be able to see right now.

 

The action step of the day… simply use your imagination !

 Initiative and Leadership 
 Published by Antonio in Leadership on January 3rd, 2012 | No Comments» 
The Beginning of Leadership
 
All of the great men and women in history have done one thing that the average persons do not do.  That is to take initiative .  Many people can only function today if they are taking orders or are told what to do.  It is a sad state, but some people only respond to what they are told to do and how.  They lack the creativity, the daring personality, the courage to step up to the plate and do on their own accord.  This is why so often we see a great deal of people follow someone who simply had the courage and insight to take the initiative and go.

 

There is a famous scene from the movie Glory , when Matthew Broderick the commander of the 55 th Regiment was shot down dead.  Denzel Washington, who played a role as one of the army officers, then took initiative by running up grabbing the American flag and charging his cohorts to charge forward in battle.  What did he do?  He took the initiative.  If you have found yourself in a MLM or home business organization you either got sold into it, or you took the initiative to get out of the rat-race of a job to earn residual income from a home business for yourself.  I applaud you.

 

The irony in a home business is the fact that once in you have (joined a network marketing program) you all over again have to take initiative and become a leader .  The reason why is because of what was written in the putting together a team in MLM.  Multi-level marketing programs (MLM) work best when you design a team around you who will learn from you and design their own teams around them.  To do this, if you are not a leader or a person who can take initiative, it is most likely not going to happen for you.

 

How do you begin to take initiative with you business?  You attend all types of trainings regarding the business.  In house company training, outside trainings such as this course you are reading and compare, use your creative mind to establish a method in which you can operate consistently .  With wise counsel you can embark new marketing, advertising, and leadership trainings.  You are sure to be involved in the “doing” of everything you set out to teach or share.  When the team is stagnate, even if you are, you do not show it and you quickly come up with ways to get yourself and the team back going.  Most importantly, you never ever give up.

 

To pick up this habit if you have never done so before, a good thing you can do is to start with your job (if you are currently an employee).  I use to be scared to voice my opinion or give input to the team at my job, not because I was shy or did not want to feel dumb for making a suggestion.  Instead, I knew I had great ideas and I did not want them to take my credit and give me nothing.  So I held my best to myself.  Well, I wish I could do it all over again because this is your wisdom in the eyes of your peers and employers.  If they see you consistently giving good input, doing extra, doing more than you are paid; they will soon elevate you.

 

They will begin to see they cannot operate correctly without you.  They will promote you and if they don’t, they will not want to dispose of you because they will fear you will be of harm to them if you join their competitors.  What this will do for you is set in motion the habit of doing more; being relied on by your current or future customers in your MLM programs.  Taking initiative sets you apart from the next person because the average person does not do this.  The average person has been deeply programmed to be an order taker and not a order giver.  The average person joins the trend and rarely if ever sets them.

 

Look for things that will enhance your life and take the initiative and do them.  Do them for yourself and do them for the sake of your team, your future, your family.  You can do it for the simple reason is that others before you have done so. Take charge!
