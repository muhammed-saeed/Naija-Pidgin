Water Street Seafood Company owner wants to open fast-food restaurant on Southside

Brad Lomax is renovating a former McDonald&apos;s location on Holly Road near Everhart Road into Tailfins

 CORPUS CHRISTI —
Brad Lomax has wanted to open a Southside restaurant for 28 years. He will in April.

The owner of several downtown businesses, Lomax is renovating a former McDonald&apos;s location on Holly Road near Everhart Road into Tailfins, a seafood eatery that will offer reasonably priced food options and a drive-thru.

A restaurant on the Southside, and one that caters to fast-food lovers are both firsts for Lomax, the owner of several businesses downtown, including four restaurants.

Lomax wanted to open his first restaurant along South Padre Island Drive in 1983, but had a hard time getting property owners to take a chance on a then-28-year-old, inexperienced entrepreneur, he said. So he took his vision downtown.

Now he wants to cater to the consumer who is watching his or her budget and not wanting to spend $15 on a meal.

&quot;I want to work on recipes that bring our average cost down to reach a different market,&quot; said Lomax, who started building renovations earlier this month. &quot;With the economy, people are looking at value plus savings. We&apos;re looking to put the value on the plate, not necessarily the ambiance. The place will be nice, but we&apos;re not winning awards for design.&quot;

That doesn&apos;t mean fans of his restaurant Water Street Seafood Company will go without. Lomax plans to keep staples such as his caldo xochitl, gumbo and walnut dressing.

His fish will be fresh, never frozen, he said. The menu, which still is still being put together, will contain a good mix of grilled and fried dishes such as fried shrimp baskets and grilled chicken or shrimp salads, he said.

Breaking from his business model, which has served him well, is not a big gamble, said Dee Haven, owner of Haven and Associates, a restaurant consulting firm.

&quot;He&apos;s not giving up what&apos;s working for him well downtown,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s expanding into another part of town and modifying slightly what has been proven to work in Corpus Christi. I would guess most of his regular customers downtown live on the Southside. If he adheres to his reputation for quality, tasty food, he&apos;ll be just as successful.&quot;

He owns Water St. Oyster Bar, Water St. Seafood Company, the Surf Club, and I believe the coffee shop below company offices. I worked for Mr. Lomax in San Antonio and in Corpus, and he was definitely the best restaurant owner and operator I&apos;ve ever worked with, or for. Good Luck, Brad!!

That is a hard location to get in to. I have seen two accidents caused by people trying to turn in to that location. Plus traffic backed up cause they have no middle lane in front of the building, their is a left turning lane to get on to Everhart. So they stop in the left lane.

I don&apos;t think Water Street is horrible, but I think it is overrated. I like the Surf Club quite a bit though. It is a place I like to take visitors from out of town to experience something that is unique to Corpus Christi. It is telling that a southside business has to be cheap, fried fast food with a drivethrough to make it. This town has too many fatties in SUVs as it is.

Will be nice to finally have fresh seafood on the southside considering our city&apos;s proximity to the water. Enjoy the Surf Club menu and based on Brad&apos;s past business successes, I&apos;m sure this venture will be a welcomed culinary addition to the southside. Somebody pass the tartar sauce!

I don&apos;t know about anyone else, but I&apos;m glad I will have a new place to try their seafood. I was getting tired of Long John Silver. Their food started out okay, but lately the food taste like it been sitting there for a while. It doesn&apos;t taste fresh anymore.

Sounds like this place will be a step up from Boat &apos;n Net with the grilled seafood options! Glad to hear that because eating healthy is a top priority for me and if I can do that at an affordble price (similar to Subway) then I support Brad. (Sorry to hear that his San Antonio ventures dissolved because I really enjoyed eating at the (I-10 West location.)

That&apos;s because ppl in Corpus don&apos;t know how to drive safely and considerately. Drivers should not try to access this restaurant heading east on holly, but you know that they will. Dummies.

Everyone has different opinions, but Niko&apos;s?! I&apos;ve eaten there 3 or 4 times and the service and food has been horrible each time. The wait staff stood around and talked more than they did anything else.

I do like Water Street, but only a few dishes. It would be nice if the south side had more medium to upscale choices. There are already plenty of fast food places in my mind.

Shockley Market has been a great addition. Small, intimate place with a variety of items on the menu. The food and service has always been great.

I&apos;m excited about this restaurant opening. There is not a good place for seafood on the southside. I don&apos;t know why people are raving about Niko&apos;s. I&apos;ve been there several times and although it wasn&apos;t terrible, it wasn&apos;t anything spectacular. By the way kudos is not spelled cuddos.

This just made my day! I just had Waterstreet sushi for dinner yesterday and it was fantastic! I don&apos;t understand some of the comments about the service being poor or the food bad. My waitress was fantastic and so were the guys behind the sushi bar. I always have a great experience at any of Lomax&apos;s restaurants. Kudos to him for the new fast food endeavor!! Granted, it would be nice if Tailfins was downtown too so that I could walk there as well lol, but that&apos;s just me being selfish.

I wholeheartedly agree with you about having grilled items on the menu. Corpus used to have Pelican&apos;s Wharf in the 70s and 80s. All the seafood was grilled over mesquite. It had beautiful nautical decor and was not brightly lit up, like so many restaurants are today (there were even candles on the tables). The restaurant had a wonderful ambiance. One could have a delicious and relaxing meal there.

Great Idea and if the food is as good as it sounds he will likely get a lot of people hooked. If I had to choose between $5 to$8 for a burger or some awesome seafood... well that&apos;s a no brainer.

I think what will make it successful is if its just as filling as any other fast food chain out there. Most seafood joints don&apos;t fill up the belly compared to what a burger can do.

Pelican&apos;s Wharf was located in Commerce I or II on SPID where Green Papaya Asian Grill is now prior to that it was called Mandarin Garden---and also another post was made about Ship Ahoy--that was nice it was on IH37&amp;Water St and had a location where County Line BBQ was on Ocean Dr.

But, hey - if this concept can&apos;t beat the superb quality of Boat &apos;N Net, just turn it into a foolproof taqueria!!!

Sorry, this is a bit off topic. Talk of favorite area restaurants has me wishing for a recipe book of mostly long gone favorites. The salad dressing at Ship Ahoy was to die for, as were the charcoal broiled burgers at Tri-Drive. The old Chicken Shake on Leopard had the tastiest chicken around, and then there was the drive to King&apos;s Inn for bombay salad, and their unique tartar sauce. It is still there, but can no longer hold a candle to the food and service of the past.

We have eaten at Laguna Reef about 3 times,and each time the service was TERRIBLE, and the food not much better. The only reason we went back more than once was because we were meeting relatives who had been out fishing.
