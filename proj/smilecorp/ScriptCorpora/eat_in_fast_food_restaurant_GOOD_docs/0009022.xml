 One-Night Stands: The Video Can Keep You Out of Prison! 
 
Always remember:  Knowledge is power!

Throughout my years as a practicing attorney, there were thousands of cases and situations I encountered where I thought (privately) to myself: If this person had only known the right things to do prior to the incident or event, they would not have gotten themselves into (or avoided altogether) the mess they were in.

Often times the solutions were very simple. However, the person lacked the necessary knowledge on how to react properly and how to keep themselves safe and avoid trouble…i.e., To avoid the severe storm that was coming their way!

Simply stated: You can’t get out of the way of an oncoming freight train if you don’t know how to move out of the way or if you don’t see it coming.

During my years in practice, I had the very good fortune to work with several incredibly good Private Investigators who assisted me in investigating criminal defense cases and divorce / child custody cases.

Recently, I got the idea to put together a series of articles for my readers. The idea was to help my readers, their friends and family members protect themselves from unwanted or unanticipated events. So, I contacted my Private Investigators and asked if they would be interested in developing articles for my readers about suggestions they would give men in order to keep them safe from harm and avoid getting blind-sided by unexpected events. The question I asked them was:  What suggestion(s) would you like to give my readers, in order to help keep them safe and avoid problems?

The first of these articles is written with Private Investigator, David (“Dave”) Winden, who has been a Private Investigator for over 25 years and has worked (as an investigator) with me on divorce, custody and criminal cases during the past 20 years. In my opinion,“Dave”is incredibly good at“stealth”and superb at discreetly obtaining critical information (legally)!

For this article, keep in mind the following (Take these seriously):

1)  At ALL TIMES, Dave and I recommend that you NEVER have unprotected sex, unless you want children and you are in an exclusive / monogamous relationship!

2)  At ALL TIMES, Dave and I recommend that you use condoms when you are having sex, unless you want children (now)!

3)  At ALL TIMES, Dave and I recommend that you avoid“One-Night Stands”and avoid having sex with complete strangers!

4)  NEVER have sex with a married or attached woman (living with someone or in a committed relationship with someone else), unless she is married or attached to you!

Reality Check:

1)  Dave and I are aware that many men will ignore recommendations 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Therefore, the suggestions below are for situations where you have foolishly decided to ignore recommendations 1, 2, 3,and 4 above,…and you have decided to“think with your hormones”(do the“Mattress Mambo”) with a stranger or an attached woman (possibly a“cougar”).

An Observation:  I have seen too many situations where an honest man has been falsely accused of rape or some other sex crime (by a woman he was having consensual sex with), after the woman went home to her husband or live-in boyfriend and she was either caught or accused of cheating.

Here’s the usual scenario:  After having sex with someone else, the woman arrives at her home very late, usually between 3:00 am and 5:00 am. Her husband or live-in boyfriend has been up all night worrying (freaking out) about where she has been! When she walks in the door, the accusations begin to fly and she has 2 choices: Either admit that she having sex with someone else or tell a lie about where she was and what she was doing. All too often, this“lie”takes the form of a making a FALSE accusation that she was raped or she was forced to engage in some form of non-consensual sexual conduct. Once this lie is told to her husband or live-in boyfriend, it becomes an unending and hideous legal nightmare for the man she was having sex with!

“After the Wonderful Time.”

AFTER having sex with a stranger, an attached“Cougar”or a woman who you know is attached (married, living with someone or supposed to be in a committed relationship), ALWAYS take the woman out for coffee, a beverage or something to munch on.

You must do this at a fast food restaurant (McDonald’s, Burger King), a convenience store (possibly a 7/11), or when possible, a restaurant or diner (Denny’s or some other major chain / restaurant / diner).

The key is to take her to an establishment where there are video cameras. Invite her to have something to eat or drink, or ask her to help you pick-out something to drink or eat (donuts, chips, etc). Keep in mind, the woman who is out cheating on her husband or boyfriend is not going to want to be seen in public with you. But, by asking her to help you with the hot coffee(s), beverages and/or a quick donut will get her out of the car and into the spotlight (the establishment) where she will be on camera.

The reason for all of this is so there is a video record (a video recorded by a neutral third party), that will be available if you are later wrongfully accused of rape or some other form of non-consensual and/or illegal sexually related conduct.

The Rule:  As discussed in detail in“How To Avoid‘Getting Screwed’When Getting Laid,”as a man, you NEVER want to find yourself in a situation where you find yourself being falsely accused of rape or some other type of sexual misconduct! For a man, this is one of the worst possible situations that can happen to you!

Here are the Rules:  While at the location (convenience store, fast food location or restaurant / diner) of your choice, ALWAYS do the following:

1)  DO NOT hold her hand or touch her in any way.

The reason:  You do not want to give the appearance that you are trying to control her behavior or her actions. You want the world to see that she is free to do as she pleases at all times. Sex is not“rape’if the woman chooses to have sex with you!…. And you want the world to see, if needed, that she was in control of her behavior at all times.

2)  Come across as being gentle to everyone.

The reason:  Remember you are on camera! If you need to subpoena the video tape as evidence, your demeanor is very important! A gentleman will be viewed (by the District Attorney or a jury) as someone who acts appropriately and conducts himself in a responsible manner.

3)  Smile at her.

The reason:  Same as above…and…You want the entire world to know that you are a positive and happy person.

4)  Smile at the clerk, waitress or waiter.

The reason:  Same as above!

5)  Compliment the clerk, waitress or waiter (shirt, blouse, shoes, hair).

The reason:  Same as above…And, you are trying to make a good impression and you want to be remembered as a good person.

6)  If the clerk (or waiter) is a man, tell him he looks just like your brother. If the clerk (or waitress) is a female, tell her she looks like your sister. Just get that clerk to remember you in a positive way.

The reason:  You are trying to establish a good memory in the other person, in case you need that person as a witness in the future.

7)  Pay with a debit or credit card.

The reason:  You want to have a record of the transaction / event! You want to show exactly WHERE you have been with her. Most debit / credit card receipts also have the date and time in which the transaction took place. It is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that a woman who has been raped or been forced to engage in sexual conduct, would then go out to coffee or breakfast with the same man a short time later! Also, if a woman falsely contends that you forced her to have sex with you…. she is going to have a very difficult time explaining why she went out to coffee or breakfast at 3:00 am in the morning!

Two Very Important Points:

1)  Many women who have been cheating or who just had sex with a stranger feel as though they have the phrase“I just had sex”written across their forehead.  They may also think their husband or boyfriend knows them well enough to be able to read this on their face and they are not able to hide it from him.

2)  If a woman does make a false allegation that you forced her to engage in non-consensual sex, you will probably be arrested.  This portion is very important:  After you have been arrested, you must  immediately tell your attorney about the time and location where you were on video, so your attorney can subpoena the video recording and preserve the evidence!  Remember:  The video recording isn’t going to be available forever.  Many establishments keep their security video recordings for only a short period of time!

Remember:  There are hundreds of excellent and practical suggestions on how to protect yourself in the book:“How To Avoid‘Getting Screwed’When Getting Laid!”Just go to http://www.protectionformen.com

Thank you for taking the time to put this together. It’s all stuff I should have known, but didn’t think about. And not saying that all women are bad people, it seems in my experience that not all women tell the truth. Thank you again!

I wish I could have found this book BEFORE I started into the dating scene . After a few events in my life I thought about writing a book like this, thank God somebody else had the same idea.
