View Full Version : Why is Iced Tea generally the only drink you&apos;re guaranteed free refills of? 
 Chairman Pow 05-09-2005, 09:36 PM Didn&apos;t know if this should go here or in CS, but here goes:

Nearly every restaurant I&apos;ve been to, even ones that don&apos;t offer free refills, offer free refills of iced tea. I wonder why this is.

Of course, you generally get free water too, but iced tea is the only one I notice that you pay for yet still get free refills of.*

*At least I&apos;ve never been to a place where you don&apos;t. Reeder 05-09-2005, 09:41 PM It&apos;s cheap. Even more cheap than soda.

And soda is very cheap. Padeye 05-09-2005, 09:43 PM Tea is a very inexpensive beverage so they aren&apos;t being so magnanimous. Of course I am used to free refills of soda at most sit-down restaurants as fountain soda is Padeye 05-09-2005, 09:45 PM ...cheap too. kushiel 05-09-2005, 10:01 PM In Canada, there are a few places that charge more for Iced Tea than regular soft drinks. I&apos;m not overly sure why. Most places don&apos;t anymore (include it with pop now), but over the last few years, I&apos;ve seen it. I can&apos;t believe that&apos;s butter! 05-09-2005, 10:40 PM I&apos;ve read that, for all of its inherant evils, Carl&apos;s Jr. pioneered the concept of having the drink machine in the lobby and allowing free refills from it.

There&apos;s a local buffet at which they have drink service exclusively by waitstaff; when the glass is half-full, they immediately come by and ask if you would like a refill, and then become scarce by the time the glass is empty.

I recall that in 1995 Atlanta, refill service was nowhere to be had. When asking of a server for a refill, more often than not they interpreted this as a personal request and often said something like&quot;I&apos;ll see if I can get you one&quot;. Does this still go on there?

Then there were the few restaurants that met the customer one-quarter of the way and offered one free refill. Thankfully, these dark ages seem to have passed. rfgdxm 05-09-2005, 10:46 PM I&apos;ve read that, for all of its inherant evils, Carl&apos;s Jr. pioneered the concept of having the drink machine in the lobby and allowing free refills from it.

The McDonald&apos;s by me allows free refills from the lobby drink machine. I can&apos;t believe that&apos;s butter! 05-09-2005, 10:49 PM The McDonald&apos;s by me allows free refills from the lobby drink machine.

Right. We&apos;ve Carl&apos;s Jr. to thank for that, apparently. Xema 05-09-2005, 10:54 PM . Why is Iced Tea generally the only drink you&apos;re guaranteed free refills of?
Free refills on coffee are still quite common. phouka 05-09-2005, 10:56 PM Coffee and tea are dirt cheap for restaurants. From what I remember of my high school McDonald&apos;s days, the first cup sold paid the cost for the whole brew. Therefore, giving out free refills was an easy, cheap way to make customers happy. Hilarity N. Suze 05-09-2005, 11:03 PM I regularly patronize a restaurant that offers free refills of everything, including iced tea and lemonade.

But charges for refills of Arnold Palmers. (A mixture of iced tea and lemonade.)

Go figure--is it because of the wages involved because someone has to mix it? Meeko 05-09-2005, 11:48 PM AFAIK, the MCdonalds recently changed the fountains to be lobby accessible.


On campus, we had a Krystal, that had free refills (With lobby accesible fountains)
Recently, they went back to what the rest of the cafe does, with Half price for Refills.

I don&apos;t see where they get off on this.

I guess Sudexho has college students by the balls. pasunejen 05-10-2005, 09:40 AM Sometimes iced tea is the only drink you don&apos;t get free refills on (well, along with juice and alcoholic stuff). Can anyone explain why a restaurant would do that? Gary&quot;Wombat&quot;Robson 05-10-2005, 09:59 AM I&apos;ve never been to a restaurant that didn&apos;t have free refills on hot tea, and almost all of them offer free refills on coffee. Around here, at least half of the restaurants have free refills on soda pop, too. Hey, It&apos;s That Guy! 05-10-2005, 10:15 AM I&apos;m thinking of some restaurants that make a big deal about their iced tea, that it&apos;s&quot;fancy&quot;or&quot;gourmet&quot;or fruit juice-sweetened, not your typical Lipton stuff. Those places might not offer the free iced tea refills that they give for soda, and the iced tea may cost more than soda in the first place. Balthisar 05-10-2005, 10:21 AM Wow. I can&apos;t think of any restaurant that doesn&apos;t give free refills on soft drinks (inluding tea, coffee, lemonade). Granted, I don&apos;t go to a lot of fast food restaurants, and guess ones without lobby dispensers would have the biggest problem with it. And now that I think of it, I usually avoid restaurants entirely that don&apos;t have beer, meaning I only drink beer (which doesn&apos;t have free refills, regretably), so, maybe I&apos;m just out of touch with the common, non-beer-drinking people. :) Which restaurants don&apos;t give refills? Crandolph 05-10-2005, 10:45 AM The overwhelming majority of places in my area won&apos;t give you refills on anything, save perhaps coffee. I usually associate refills with fast food places (there are fewer chain fast food places around than in the country at large to my understanding) and coffee refills at diners. My friends and I frequently go for one beverage and refills on water. DeVena 05-10-2005, 11:06 AM I asked my mom, who owned a restaurant in the wee small years of the 70s. With coffee, if you don&apos;t use a pot relatively quickly it will just sit there slowly becoming tar. So you give it to customers rather than pouring it down the drain and making a new pot when someone complains. Same goes for tea. Although iced tea won&apos;t get undrinkable within a couple hours like coffee, it will go sour pretty quickly in a hot, humid, southern-restaurant kitchen. Better to give it away than throw it out. Cheap, easy to make, and keeps customers happy. DrDeth 05-10-2005, 11:07 AM There is a local non-chain Pizza place. They serve unique and tasty pizza. Unfortunately, they have moderately pricey&amp;small soft drinks- and no free refills. I like lots of soda to wash my pizza down, so I no longer eat there. I wonder if they know how much business they are losing because of this? I have called a couple of times to ask if they have&quot;changed their re-fill policy&apos; but they don&apos;t seem to get the hint.... :( Flipshod 05-10-2005, 11:09 AM Plus, tea has a short shelf life, especially when kept in that unrefridgerated (sp?) cannister/dispenser you typically see.

They throw out what they don&apos;t use at the end of the day. Gary&quot;Wombat&quot;Robson 05-10-2005, 12:05 PM The overwhelming majority of places in my area won&apos;t give you refills on anything, save perhaps coffee.
I&apos;ve been to Philly (although it&apos;s been a while), and I don&apos;t remember ever encountering a restaurant that won&apos;t give free refills on hot tea. Are you absolutely sure about this? Bosda Di&apos;Chi of Tricor 05-10-2005, 12:33 PM I just went to Waffle House,&amp;got free refills on Coke. Crandolph 05-10-2005, 12:36 PM I&apos;ve been to Philly (although it&apos;s been a while), and I don&apos;t remember ever encountering a restaurant that won&apos;t give free refills on hot tea. Are you absolutely sure about this?

Well, since I live here I have most of my hot tea at home, as a morning thing. I rarely have breakfast out. Certainly coffee refills are free at diners. I certainly have been charged at least once for a second cup of tea, which surprised me. But iced tea, in a real glass at a non-fast food restaurant, usually entails an additional charge. This too amazes me considering the presumed cost/benefit of a cheap beverage and happy customers.

I&apos;m equally amazed when I go to any bar other than where I&apos;m a regular&amp;I can order 3 beers&amp;a Coke for someone who isn&apos;t drinking, and not only get charged for the soda, but more for it than a beer sometimes! Where I am a regular, soda is free as a courtesy. Gary&quot;Wombat&quot;Robson 05-10-2005, 12:58 PM Where I am a regular, soda is free as a courtesy.
Here, too. At least the fountain soda is. If you get it in a can or a bottle, they&apos;ll always charge. Shoeless 05-10-2005, 02:38 PM On campus, we had a Krystal, that had free refills (With lobby accesible fountains)

I don&apos;t see where they get off on this.

I&apos;ve seen restaurants that do this too, and it doesn&apos;t make sense. If they want to control how many refills you get, they should have the fountain behind the counter. And personally, I&apos;ve never been stopped by anyone when I go back for more than one refill. I can&apos;t imagine they have someone who&apos;s job it is to count how many refills someone gets, and I&apos;m sure they don&apos;t want their employees to get into a shouting match with a customer.&quot;That&apos;s your second refill!&quot;&quot;No it&apos;s not!&quot;etc. I guess they figure they can make a little extra cash off the suckers who will actually go up to the cash register and pay for their second refill. vBulletin®v3.7.3, Copyright©2000-2012, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.
