Buffalo Wild Wings Tips
 We were told 20 minutes before they closed that they wouldn&apos;t seat us, and they couldn&apos;t guarantee that they could get us wings to go before they closed, either. Fast food restaurants are better.
 
Michelle R. Terrible service. Second time I&apos;ve come and they completely screw up my order. Listen to your customers and stop running your mouth...
 
Morgan S. Service has not stepped up for homecoming weekend. Disappointing.
 
Tony B. Nope...service is still bad.
 
Chris L. Service may have improved since other comments. A bit slow but nothing unexpected of a bdubs. Tuesday and Thursday deals. Some booths have their own tvs which seems oddly antisocial.
