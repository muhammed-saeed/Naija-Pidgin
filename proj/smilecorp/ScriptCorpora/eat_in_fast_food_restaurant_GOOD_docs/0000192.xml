Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas cheats:
Glitches

 Note: Button presses are described in PlayStation2 version
format. Use the equivalent key on the PC keyboard or button on
the Xbox controller when playing that version. 
 Bone County: Go underground in Area 69:
 Do the underworld glitch (at the Vinewood safehouse
head north from Madd Dogg&apos;s) and fly to Area 69. Find the underground
complex. Find the area where you get the Black Project, and you
should see an empty long hollow room next to it. It should have
red boxes at the top of the&quot;silo&quot;. Fly underneath the
empty silo then fly to the top of the silo. You should see a&quot;cage&quot;where the room is of the red boxes. Try to take off your Jetpack.
When you do, you should land in the Black Project area or the
rooms around there. Note: To do the underworld glitch, find the
safe house pool. Fly the Jetpack into the corner of the safe house.
Then, fly to Area 69. Also, bring weapons and armor because the
SAPD officers spawn down there.
 J1chaser . 
 Bone County: Walk through ground:
 Go to your airport in the Verdant Meadows area. Find
the southern hangar with the Shamal in it. Let the door open,
then stand in between the two doors that close. They will begin
to close on you. If done correctly, you should appear under the
ground, with half of your body aboveground and half below ground.
To get out, tap Square .
 Blaine Gergley . 
 Bone County: Underworld:
 Get a parachute and go to your safe house in Fort Carson.
Save the game here to avoid having to get a parachute and traveling
Fort Carson all over again if a mistake is made. Leave your safe
house and go northeast to Bone County. Go to the Lil&apos; Probe Inn
bar. The Lil&apos; Probe Inn is just north of the train tracks and
directly across the road from a small mobile home trailer park.
Lil&apos; Probe Inn will display on the map area notification when
you enter its area. Go inside the Lil&apos; Probe Inn building. Look
at the light hanging from the ceiling that is just behind the
pool player. Jump towards the light as if you were going to climb
it like a wall. It may take multiple attempts but eventually you
will jump above the Lil&apos; Probe Inn and be looking down at it.
You will also notice a pitch black void surrounding it. Jump off
the north side of the Lil&apos; Probe Inn into the black void and immediately
deploy the parachute. Press CJ&apos;s weight back so that he descends
at the slowest rate. When you land you will be in the&quot;Underworld&quot;.
You will only see Bone County country-styled characters because
the&quot;Underworld&quot;is considered as being inside the Lil&apos;
Probe Inn. To move around in the&quot;Underworld&quot;, enable
the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code. You can now fly to Los Santos,
San Fierro, and Las Venturas with some difficulty, as obstacles
from the normal world will still be there but you will not be
able to see them. You must wiggle about a lot to find your way.
In the cities, only a very small portion of them will be available.
Using the Jetpack will make it easy to find the available areas.
The&quot;Underworld&quot;has invisible jumps and falls, making
the Jetpack necessary to navigate. The only way out of the&quot;Underworld&quot;can be found by going to Los Santos, where the small part of the
city is available in the area called Commerce. Look for the building
called Atrium that has two outdoor escalators and a top section
with outdoor seating with umbrellas over tables. Once you enter
Atrium you can then go outside be back in the normal world of
San Andreas. It is probably a good idea to reset the PlayStation2
after visiting the Underworld and not save the game.
 ZA. 
 Flint County: Fall through ground:
 Go to Flint County. There should be a road to follow.
Drive on it and you will find a wall that leads off to the side.
If you drive up and down that wall, you should fall through the
ground. You may have to do it a few times. You must hug the wall
for this glitch to occur.
 jonny fartesja . 
Go to your safe house in Prickle Pine. Enable the&quot;CJ jumps
higher&quot;code. Enter the safe house. Turn towards the entrance
and jump up. You should go over the wall and fall into blackness
until you land in a field of grey. In front of you should be an
incomplete version of the are where you saved Denise. Buildings
will be missing, but you can physically touch them. You should
also see white letters that read&quot;Ganton&quot;,&quot;North
Rock&quot;, and&quot;Downtown&quot;. Stand in front of it and
mark the Four Dragons Casino. Then, enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code and fly it toward the casino. You should eventually see an
armor pickup, a uzi pickup, a pistol pickup, and a money pickup
that contains $15,000 at most. You should also see four white
doors, but they have the wall physics around them.
 Cloud264 . 
 Flint County: Jump outside safe house:
 At your safe house in Prickle Pine, climb on top of
the garage. You can jump thorough the window and walk around on
top of the garage.
 kimandjervb . 
When in your safe house in Prickle Pine, enable the&quot;CJ
jumps higher&quot;code. Jump over the door, and you will be teleported
outside your house.
 GTA Crazy . 
 Flint County: Walk or drive underwater:
 Go to the bottom of the water at the end of the island
in Flint county. Enable the&quot;Maximum lung capacity&quot;code, then swim down to where you see two rocks and a large starfish.
Swim behind the biggest rock. Sooner or later, you will be able
to walk on the bottom of the ocean. You can spawn vehicles and
fire weapons. Note: Do not get out of the water or try to fly
a plane or you will have to do this all over. Note: If you go
too close to shore or out too far, you will respawn on the nearest
island. This glitch may take a lot of time to do and requires
patience.
 Motoglide127 . 
Go to Flint County by the water. Go between the letters&quot;N&quot;and&quot;T&quot;on the word&quot;County&quot;on the map that
was included with the game. Jump in the water, go all the way
down to the bottom, and swim around close to where you jumped
in. When you are in the correct location, you will fall to the
bottom of the sea. When this happens you can walk underwater anywhere
desired. You also fly or drive underwater.
 Tim George and Kyle Morton . 
 Las Venturas: Wrong casino name:
 Check the map that was included with the game. Look
in Las Venturas near the casino entitled&quot;The Clown&apos;s Pocket.&quot;This casino cannot be found, because it is named&quot;The Ringmaster&quot;on this map. However, in the game it is called&quot;The Clown&apos;s
Pocket.&quot;
 Taylor Faw . 
 Las Venturas: Fall through ground:
 Enable the&quot;CJ jumps higher&quot;code. Buy the
house in near the country club. Get on the second or third stair
facing the door. Note: You must not have a parachute or you will
die on entry, but must have maximum health and armor. Jump while
moving forward, and you will fall for about twenty seconds. When
you arrive, there will be a hill with houses, no cars, no pedestrians,
and you cannot use any codes to spawn a vehicle. You can however
walk in some areas of darkness. You must reset the game to exit
this glitch.
 Ian . 
There is a rectangular building just north of the Camel&apos;s Toe
with a Pay n&apos; Spray that is not located on the map. You can see
yourself being resprayed, and if you get out and stand in the
cement slab separating the garage from the outside, you will fall
through the ground for a few seconds then return safely back on
your feet a few feet from where you fell.
 Matt Just . 
There is a Pay N&apos; Spray to the east of a parking complex next
to the Camel&apos;s Toe pyramid that is not on the map. If you walk
into it slowly, you will fall into the ground and land on the
sidewalk but will not be killed. If you walk into it with a Jetpack
and start flying after you are underground, you can fly anywhere
under Las Venturas. To get above ground again, just keep going
down until you appear above ground again.
 Swerve353 . 
 Las Venturas: Jump through window:
 Near the safehouse where your girlfriend Millie lives
(directly east from the Abandoned AC Tower; costs $50,000) are
windows that you can jump through. Climb the wall beside the house
and jump on the roof. You can go through the windows. You can
see your garage, shoot people through the window, and if you get
a wanted level of 2 or more, can get policemen trapped in your
garage. Be careful; when you jump through the window and want
to get out you must step back from the window and jump until you
can cling onto it, then climb back up.
 Dylan Jerman . 
 Las Venturas: Police helicopter repeatedly
explodes:
 Go to the airport. Get inside the fenced perimeter
where the runway, planes, etc., are located. Once inside, blow
up a few planes to get a wanted level that is high enough for
the police helicopter to start chasing you (three stars or more).
Then, go the hangar where the AT-400 is located. Wait for the
door to open. Then, go inside, but stick to the walls inside the
hangar. The police helicopter should follow you into the hangar.
When it does, shoot at it until it is about to explode. It should
begin smoking, but still be flying. Remember to stay near or against
the walls on either side of the AT-400 while doing this. Next,
walk into the middle of the hangar. The police helicopter will
try to fly away, but cannot because of the hangar roof. It will
become trapped. Go back to near the wall and finish it off. The
helicopter will explode repeatedly (usually a dozen or more times)
while still trying to fly away. It will only come crashing down
when you walk directly beneath it. To repeat this, go back near
the wall and walk alongside it towards the hangar door. Another
police helicopter should appear and will fly into the hangar.
 ornerydude420 . 
 Las Venturas: Stand in police garage:
 Bring a police car or any vehicle into the garage.
Drive it far enough so that it closes. Then, drive to it until
it opens. Next, back up and jump out. It should finish opening,
then begin to close. Get under it before that happens. The door
then should move back up. If it does, wait until it hits the top,
then run or jump inside. You will now be able to walk above the
garage and under the streets. You can fire a weapon and watch
as pedestrians run scared and cops try to kill you. To exit, run
past an outer wall. You will land in front of the main entrance.
You will have three stars on your wanted meter from being spotted
in the garage, so have armor ready. If it does not open, jump
to the outside to get out, or kill yourself.
 maxxam312 . 
 Los Santos: Large insane stunt bonus:
 Get a BMX and ride it to the most northern safe house
in the Mulholland area near the Vinewood sign. Note: If you are
interested in buying it, the cost is $120,000. Notice that the
building is in a&quot;L&quot;shape. Go to the inner corner of
the&quot;L&quot;, next to the pool. Ride into the walls and you
will fall through one of them. You will go into a glitched area.
Perform lots of rotations before you land back near the safe house
to get an insane stunt bonus.
 Elliott Briggs . 
 Los Santos: Invisible spray paint:
 When in CJ&apos;s home, get the spray paint can from his
bedroom. Go to his lobby and spray in front off his mirror at
a certain distance. You will not see the spray in the mirror when
spraying.
 Thomas Pardoen . 
 Los Santos: Missing gun:
 Have a gun capable of doing drive-bys and go on a date
with Denise riding in a motorcycle. If she asks if you want some&quot;coffee&quot;, say&quot;Yes&quot;. When you are done and
get back on your bike, you will not have the gun out. This will
fix itself when you get off the bike.
 Austin Cobb 
 Los Santos: Wrong dialogue:
 During the Reuniting The Families mission, the police
helicopter announces that they are the&quot;Los Angeles Police
Department&quot;instead of the&quot;Los Santos Police Department&quot;.
 Christhedog2 . 
 Los Santos: When Roadtrains attacks:
 Get in a Tractor, which can be found in Blueberry,
and find a Roadtrain. Roadtrains are huge semi-tractor trailers.
They can also be found in Blueberry. Back up into the Roadtrain
with the tractor and begin to tow it. Try to go has straight as
possible, until you get up to top speed. When the Roadtrain starts
to twitch like it wants to turn left or right, make a sharp right
or left turn in the Tractor. The Roadtrain will turn very fast
and flip out, throwing the tractor.
 Dominick Tino . 
 Los Santos: Move without moving:
 Enable the&quot;Spawn Quadbike&quot;code and drive
it to where the Just Business mission for Big Smoke is done. There
should be some escalators. Drive up them using the quadbike, then
press Square to stop. You will then drive up automatically.
The same thing can be done while going down.
 mainly crazy . 
 Los Santos: Late death:
 Go to the police station (where there is a toll gate
with a policeman standing next to it). Hijack any police vehicle.
Note: If you hijack a car or do a crime in that area, this will
not work. Then, go in front of the gate and wait for him to open
it. Once he does, go inside and go straight. Stay in your vehicle.
Park next to the garage door then get out of your vehicle. Once
out, go next to the building and your will see another booth next
to the building. Go inside and kill the guard. Then, kill the
booth man next to the gate. Once this is done, go in the garage
through the fire exit. Then, go next to a policeman so that he
points his gun at you. He should say that he needs backup into
his radio. Kill him with a gun. If done correctly, he should be
dead, but still standing. Once he gets off the radio, he should
fall down and die.
 Robin Cohen . 
 Los Santos: C.J. dies dancing:
 Enable the&quot;Pedestrians riot&quot;and&quot;Pedestrians
have weapons&quot;codes. Enter the dance club and start the dance
challenge. During the dance, a pedestrian may have a rocket launcher
and start shooting. More people will come in and watch you dance.
If the pedestrians are too close, then you will be inflicted with
damage from the rocket launcher. If your damage has passed the
point of making you wasted, when the dance is over the message
will appear stating that you can dance to a harder track. After
the message disappears, C.J. will drop to the floor dead.
 vire, t Luffydude9 . 
 Los Santos: Underwater Ballas:
 After you complete the End Of The Line mission and
start taking territory. go to the pier with the Ferris-wheel in
Ballas territory. Start a war at the end of the pier down near

wall and continue falling until you reappear back on the ground.
You can use the Jetpack to fly around in blue hell.
 Blaine Gergley . 
Go to the building where the mission&quot;End Of The Line&quot;took place, where you killed Big Smoke. Note: This will not work
after you complete the mission -- you should be playing a new
file to do this. Get a car and ram the wall in the front. You
should either break the wall and go through or break the wall
and get pushed back from the impact. Then, drive in and you will
fall through the ground and end up back on the street. Sometimes
your car will disappear when you get put back on the street. If
you walk in, you will fall but when you are put back on the street
you will not lose any health.

for the outside wall. Press L3 to jump and fly over the
fence and through the ground into pitch blackness. Keep driving
down until you hit ground then drive until you see a part of San
Fierro where CJ&apos;s garage in the Doherty area is located. There

them and you can explore.

now fly up and around the interior of the game.
 Cameron Garza . 
 Los Santos: Invisible city:
 Go to the Pig Pen Strip Club in East Los Santos. You
will see a woman bartender standing near a rectangular counter
in front and behind her, with heart symbols in the background.
Jump on top of the rectangular counter behind the bartender woman
and to the right of it. You will be able to see a tall drink cabinet
that is near to the ceiling. Jump on top of this drink cabinet
in a certain way and you will be forced to stand on top of the
Pig Pen building. Simply make your way towards&quot;brown hell&quot;to turn the entire area invisible. Note: Do not be fooled by the
altitude when you are standing on top of the Pig Pen; you are
nowhere near ground level. Spawn a Jetpack or a parachute before
attempting this glitch.
 Seymour Butts .

 Enter the Ganton Gym and spawn the Jetpack. Go over
the arrow, out but do not go out. Fly up through a blank tile.

a tornadom and other things. Do not lose height or you will have
to kill yourself when you land.
 mark newman II . 
 Los Santos: Player one stuck in player
two:
 Start a two player free roam. This glitch is best done
with a car. Get a car and drive over to the house that is above
Madd Dogg&apos;s that you can fall through. Drive the car up to the
wall and slowly drive through the wall. Drive slowly so that the
car will flip while falling. After a few seconds you should get
a black box that reads&quot;Loading...&quot;, which indicates
the trick was done correctly. You will respawn on the road just
before Madd Dogg&apos;s driveway, floating just above the ground stuck
in each other. The only way to get out of this is to have player
two jump.
 Kevin Warner . 
 Los Santos: Buy hotdogs from dead vendor:

the&quot;Weapons&quot;code and obtain a rocket launcher. Find
the hot dog stand at the far end. Shoot it with a rocket launcher.

floating in the water. You can still buy hotdogs, even the vendor
is dead.
 candyeatfast . 
 Los Santos: Police radio mystery:
 Go to the Transfenders and Pay N&apos; Spray in the Vinewood/Mulholland
areas. Stay around the Transfenders and kill a few people until
you get a wanted level. You will hear the police dispatcher on
a radio bulletin reporting your crime. Listen carefully to hear
the dispatcher say&quot;respond to a 10-75 in northeast Sunnyside&quot;.
This area is not shown in the map. However, in several maps the
Los Santos Transfenders is in an area called Sunrise (not Sunnyside).
 Cupcakekid9284 . 
 Los Santos: Ghost driver:
 Drive north on&quot;Playa dell Seville&quot;road
(the freeway on the far right on the map). Drive past the stadium
and do a U-turn at the last street on the left. Drive on the correct
side of the road, in the far right lane. When you pass the stadium,
there will be some houses, and a car will begin to drive out of
a driveway. It will stop just before the road, and when you look
closely there will be no one in it.
 Rian Prestwich . 
 Los Santos: Bike on building:
 Go to the skyscraper that you can enter. Ride a bike
into the yellow marker. You will transferred to the top of the
building, and still be on the bike.
 A Cercek . 
 Los Santos: Uncover entire map and get
pilot license early:
 You can receive a pilot license and uncover the entire
map with this trick. Get any car that has a top, such as a cab.
Drive to Los Santos International Airport. If you are coming off
the freeway, you should see the big parking lot. When approaching
from that direction, ride down the one way street which borders
that huge fence. Keep riding until you see a bridge and the fence
turns around. Get off that street and ride across the grass. At
where the fence turns around, in that small portion of the fence
which borders the grass, park a car directly on the fence. Get
out of your car and jump on the hood. Jump onto the fence. If
your cannot reach the fence rim, then ride around the block where
the fence continues, near the pilot&apos;s entrance/ Once you are in
the fenced area with the planes, walk until you get to another
fence, which is a regular wire fence. Hop over it. You should
see a red Dodo plane or the back of plane hubs. Walk onto the
runway north. You should see a white plane which looks like a
jet. Get in it. Back up onto the runway. Make sure you back up
enough so that you have room to get in air. Once you are in the
air, fly east of Los Santos, over the ocean. Do not go to the
left over San Fierro, Once you reach the ocean, keep flying. After
about ten minutes, you should see a message stating,&quot;Keep
On Practicing And You Will Receive A Pilots License&quot;. Keep
flying. Remember to keep straight. Do not try to go to another
city (Las Venturas or San Fierro). If you do, you will receive
a four star wanted level and missiles will shoot you down. After
about fifteen minutes of flying over nothing but water, look at
your map. You should see that every part of the map is uncovered.
If not, fly slightly north, but stay as is so you will not run
into Las Venturas. Check again in five minutes. Your map should
be fully uncovered. After your map is uncovered, fly another fifteen
to twenty minutes. When you fly about forty minutes total, you
should see a message stating,&quot;You Received Your Pilots Licenses!&quot;.
If not, keep flying until that happens. You can turn back around
a fly towards Los Santos. Make sure you do not go into any other
city while doing this. Land your plane on the runway. Only go
towards the ones in Los Santos. When you land, you now can see
the whole map and have your pilots licenses. With the licenses,
you will be able to enter any airport&apos;s pilots entrance and fly
any of the planes.
 Kynnith Francis-Vaughan . 
 Los Santos: Misspelling:
 In Downtown Los Santos, there is an Atrium. (you fight
inside it in Big Smoke&apos;s mission, Just Business). There are two
entrances; a front and a side. When you enter the front door,
the corner display correctly shows&quot;Atrium&quot;. However,
if you enter the side door, the corner display shows that you
entered the&quot;Attrium&quot;.
 Rob Mitros . 
 Red County: Walk through wall:
 When you are by your house on the hills directly behind
the&quot;Vinewood&quot;sign, go behind the house where the pool
is located. Walk over to the wall and go straight, where another
wall meets that wall. You will be able to walk through the wall,
and if you walk in the correcl location, you will fall and the&quot;Loading&quot;message will appear. The game will place you
on a road below the&quot;Vinewood&quot;sign.
 Kody morse . 
 Red County: Walk underwater:
 Go to the top right corner of the first region and
you should be at Hanky Panky Point. With the pointer on your map,
follow the interstate left slowly until you just get into Red
Country. As soon as the pointer hits Red Country, stop. Place
a target there and go to that location on the interstate. Once
you are there, find the cluster of seven trees that are very close
together and go to them. Then go directly in the water from where
you are at. Once you are in the water go off shore about 10 to
15 feet then turn around and face the shore. Then, start swimming
towards the shore again. Look along the bottom of the land where
it meets the water. Look for an orange starfish. Swim towards
it and it and when you hit it you should be able to walk under
the water.
 Playa4lifePH . 
 Red County: Fall through map:
 Get a police bike, and go to the section of the tracks
that leads to Red County if you keep driving. Keep moving your
bike against the right side so that it sparks severely, but does
not crash. After about 30 seconds, you should fall through the
map. The bike will fall and disappear, and CJ will appear somewhere
on the map randomly.

 San Fierro: Hospital underworld gateway:
 Go to San Fierro&apos;s hospital. There are two different
buildings that are connected by a walkway that is over the road.
Go towards the western building (hospital) were the cane is located.
(where you get dropped off when you visit the hospital). To your
left should be an ambulance. Go towards the ambulance, and face
the east building&quot;across the road&quot;. As you look across
the road, you will see doors and a part of the building (hospital)
that sticks out. [Screenshot] Fly between the doors and the part of the building that is sticking
out to reach the gateway to get in the hospital underworld. To
get back to the real world, sink down to the endless pit. CJ will
respawn at the closest street. You can also fly though the opening
of the hospital where you first entered the underworld.

 San Fierro: Fall through ground:
 Go to where you can get in Mavericks. Make sure you
are riding a motorcycle and keep hitting the pillars. Iif you
hit the correct one (near the third one) hard enough, you should
fall. Everything should turn gray and you will not see CJ any
more. You will reappear directly next to the pillar you fell through.

 San Fierro: Fly under city:
 There is be a construction site behind the safehouse.
Go across the construction site to the building behind it, at
the two player icon location. Enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code and fly up. There is a domed-shaped part of the roof that
sticks out. Fly up until CJ&apos;s head touches the roof. Then, fly
against the wall. If you are at the correct location, you will
go inside the building. Once inside, sink down until you are under
the city. If you go down too far you will appear at a random location
in the city.

 San Fierro: Ghost edge:
 Go to the garage that you own. Go to the back of the
building and try to jump on the back of it. You cannot because
the edge is raised. You must get a running start down the hill
behind the building to get on it, and once you are on it, you
can tell where it starts.

 San Fierro: Helicopter in garage:
 Occasionally at the helipad that is guarded with a
police garage not far from it, if you go into the garage when
the helicopter is present, you will find another helicopter at
the bottom floor of the garage.

 San Fierro: Lose custom paint job at mod
garage:
 There is a problem with the mod garage by the Ocean
Flats area (not the mod garage by your garage and Wang Cars).
If you have a modified car with a custom paint job stored in one
of your garages and do not use it for awhile, the car will actually
lose the fancy paint job and suddenly have a coat of a plain color.

In Zero&apos;s shop, there are many boxes on shelves of trains, cars,

a picture of a Turismo on it. There is only one car exactly like
the one on the box in the shop, and the actual name is Turismo
not Tourismo.

 San Fierro: Hidden island:
 Go out very far to the left from San Fierro. You can
find a secret island. Note: It was found during the Pier 69 mission
while chasing Ryder in his boat. You can knock his boat onto land,
so he cannot move. Note: The island is difficult to find.
 Dan Fergo . 
 San Fierro: CJ always walks backwards and
through doors:
 Go to the Cobra&quot;Marital&quot;Arts gym and learn
the moves from your&quot;master&quot;. Then, request to spar
with him. As soon as the sparring match begins, hold R1 to lock on to your opponent. Do not release R1 until the
fight is completely over. Once you have locked on, approach him
and press Circle to punch him repeatedly until he goes
outside of the ring. The moment that he exits the ring, do not
throw another punch, but instead press the Left Analog-stick
Back until the game blacks out of the fight. If done correctly
(and this may require some practice), CJ will begin walking backwards
without you using the controller. Depending on how you moved the Left Analog-stick at the end of the sparring match, CJ
will either sidestep slightly or fully back-up. He will stop doing
this if you attempt to attack, jump, crouch, enter a vehicle,
or pause game play. Do not worry if you deactivate this effect,
as it can be turned on again at any time. You can exit the door
but, depending on how you do it, one of three thing may happen.
First, CJ will stop walking backwards and return to normal. Second,
CJ will walk around backwards outside of the gym. Third, CJ will
forever walk in and out of the door until you deactivate the glitch
(for example, by jumping or if you find some way to move forward
before CJ goes back through the door). You can run or walk forward
while CJ walks backwards, and the result is a somewhat of a sliding
movement that sends CJ moving at an angle. You may enter or exit
doors at will, but some of the time CJ may either get caught in
the eternal door stance or end up walking like normal again.

 San Fierro: walk on water in two player
mode:
 Go to the police dock in two player mode. Get close
to the boat that is outside of the dock. It should have a roof
on it (on the right, if you look at the dock entrance). Go close
enough to it to get a five star wanted level. Then, stay under
the boat so that a helicopter can shoot at it and blow it up.
Go inside the boat, under the lid, with both players. Then, make
player one kiss player two. While you are kissing, player two
will disappear. If you press Select controller two, you
will notice that he is walking on water. You shoot and walk around
with no lung capacity limit.

 San Fierro: Floating parking valets:
 Go to the valet parking hotel without your uniform
on. Stand next to the valets when a car drives up. When the person
gets out of their car, quickly run and jack it. The parking valet
will begin to chase you down. Do not take off. Instead, back the
car up far from the valet. Then, hit the gas run over parking
valet. You will hear a crack when you hit him, which indicates
that you killed him. Back away slowly and you will see that the
parking valet floating dead in the air, with his back and head
arched back. This can also be done with the other parking valets.

 San Fierro: Rain stopped by missing roof:
 There is a building in the Garcia area, Big Smoke&apos;s
meth lab, that no longer has a roof, due to the fact that you
blew it up in a mission. When it rains you can stand inside the
building and it does not rain.

 Whetstone: CJ spontaneously combusts:
 Go to the level area of ground at the peak of Mt. Chiliad,
where the mountain bike race is located. Take out a rocket launcher.
Aim at the Mountain Bike. The green reticule will home in on the
bike. Fire at the bike and blow it up. Then, aim at the bike again,
manually. Note: The second time around, the reticule will not
automatically aim on the&quot;wreckage&quot;of the bike. When
you fire a second missile at the bike, CJ will catch fire. You
can be 30 feet away and still catch fire. Also, the same effect
has occurs when firing a missile at the bike to&quot;blow it
up&quot;, then shooting it with a sniper rifle. However when using
the rifle it will usually require two or three rounds before CJ
catches on fire.
 konfuzion13 . 
 Whetsone: Flying hovercraft:
 Get up to the top of Mount Chiliad where the flag and
mountain bike are located. Enable the&quot;Spawn Vortex&quot;code to get the hovercraft. Look for the little slope-like jump
thing next to the flag near the fence. This is where you will
jump off. Get the Vortex lined up with this ramp and jump off
it. While you are in the air, control the Vortex so that it flies
to get a flying hovercraft.
 Paul McDonald . 
 Whetstone: Never fall off your bike:
 Go to the top of Mount Chiliad. Get the parachute and
get on the mountain bike at the correct time for the bicycle race
challenge. Make sure that the parachute is your current weapon
before the race starts. When the race begins, do not go through
the checkpoints. There will be a ramp on the left side with a
flag beside it. Cycle there and jump off the mountain with your
bike as soon a s the race starts. When CJ is in the air with the
mountain bike, press Triangle to jump off the bike. Then
while in the air, press Circle to open your parachute.
You must do this quickly before CJ is put to the race track again.
However, once you open the parachute in the air, CJ will be put
on the race track again, with him riding a bike. However, this
time you will have a parachute opened while riding your BMX, and
CJ will not be holding the bike&apos;s handlebars. He will instead
be holding the parachute. You can now go downhill at any angle
and at any speed without falling off the bike. Note: You must
end the race to take your bike elsewhere. If you try to jump off
the cliff again while you have the parachute, you will appear
on the track without any parachute. Once you finish the race with
your parachute on you, you can go anywhere with it. You can enable
the&quot;Massive bunny hops&quot;code and jump as high as desired
and land at any angle without falling. Note: Make sure you do
this before you get on the bike. Getting off your bike will release
the parachute; if you try to do any awkward stunts you might fall.
You will not fall unless you release the parachute. Get off the
bike to release the parachute.
 Rishi Vasandani . 
 Whetstone: Die on bike:
 When you have enough biking skill, go to Mt. Chiliad

 555 WE TIP mission:
 Before completing the mission, enable the&quot;City
in Chaos&quot;or&quot;Pedestrians riot&quot;codes. When you
call the cops, instead of arresting the D.A. they will beat him
to death. Note: The mission will never finish the intermission
sequence. Instead the cops will walk away and nothing will happen.
Save your game before trying this.
 IMxHISxEMILYx3 . 
 Emmet mission: Emmet attacks:
 At the start of the game, there is a mission named&quot;Emmet&quot;. You will start at Big Smoke&apos;s house. He says
that there is a person who has&quot;all the pieces you need&quot;.
You and Big Smoke will go to a small warehouse. Emmet says&quot;I&apos;m
sorry &apos;bout Beverly,&quot;your mother. Emmet gives you and Big
Smoke a gun. You must shoot the bottles stacked on crates. Instead
of shooting the bottles, shoot Emmet. After approximately twenty
shots, he will begin to attack you. He ignores your shots when
you hit him. You can still shoot the bottles. When you finish
shooting all the bottles, he will stop. If Emmet is fighting you,
you can shoot Big Smoke. After five shots, he will drop dead.
A message will appear stating&quot;Mission Failed! Big Smoke
is history!&quot;will appear. Emmet will vanish. You can do this
anytime.
 nelandquinten . 
 High Noon mission: Helpless Pulaski:
 Run in front of Officer Pulaski&apos;s car as soon as the
mission starts, before he can get in it. Start firing at the windshield
once he gets in. The car will stop and he will get out and put
his hands up, followed by an extended period of time where he
just stands idly by doing nothing. This gives you about thirty
seconds to attack him as much as desired before he starts firing
back. He also will not get back in his car once he is out. This
makes the mission much easier.
 Bking09 . 
 High Noon mission: Regenerating car:
 Destroy Pulaski&apos;s car with any heavy weapon such as
the minigun. The car will get destroyed, but Pulaski is now leaning
against a fully intact version of his car in the intermission
sequence immediately afterwards. When the intermission sequence
is over, the car is now available for you to drive.
 Neil Sen . 
 High Stakes, Low-Rider mission:
 You will notice in the VMA that CJ&apos;s sister is sitting
in the chair with Cesar. However, when Cesar ask you to follow
him, CJ&apos;s stister is replaced with a different black girl, normally
the ones who are walking around CJ&apos;s block with a blue jersey
and a white hat. She will still shout out in CJ&apos;s sisters voice.
 Druppy46 I Love you . 
 Madd Dogg mission:
 In the mission where you save Madd Dogg from jumping
off a building , there is glitch that causes him to jump in about
two seconds, making it impossible to save him and progress further
in the game. This glitch happens when you use any of the&quot;Pedestrian&quot;codes, such as&quot;Pedestrians riot&quot;or&quot;pedestrians
are Elvis&quot;. Also, do not use the&quot;Pedestrian riot&quot;code for races as it will ruin the game and you will not be able
to complete it. Note: The glitch only occurs if you activate a&quot;Pedestrian&quot;code and save the game. Even if you deactivate
the code before saving, your game will still be affected. As long
as you do not save your game after activating it you should be
fine.

 Mike Toreno mission: Strange T-Bone behavior:
 In the mission, when instructed to get into the car
and doing so, you can choose any car desired. Get out and choose
a faster vehicle with T-Bone following you. T-Bone&apos;s following
actions for entering and exiting vehicles are scripted strangely.
For example, if you crash and get thrown off a motorcycle with
T-Bone on it with you, he will get up and walk to any nearby vehicle
door, and then follow you.
 Kevin O&apos;Die . 
 Misappropriation mission: Helicopter:
 When you need to get the dossier from the target, shoot
him in the head through the windshield, as soon as he gets in.

 Saint Mark&apos;s Bistro mission: Fall through
ground
 Enable the&quot;Unlimited health&quot;,&quot;Maximum
lung capacity&quot;, and&quot;Super jump&quot;codes. Then, do
what is necessary to get to Saint Marks and Bistro in the mission.
Go through the compound, and there is a part that is outside.
Jump over the tall wall without killing every single person. After
that, you should be in Liberty City and can walk around a short
distance before you fall back to San Andreas.
 chris kednar . 
After reaching Saint Mark&apos;s Bistro and killing a few bodyguards,
you can go outside. However, it is just a small enclosed parking
lot. Enable the&quot;Super jump&quot;code. You will be able
to hop the wall. However, if you try to go onto the road or farther,
you will fall until you land in water. The only way to exit is
to drown or commit suicide.

 Tagging Up Turf mission: Sweet drives from
passenger seat:
 When Sweet tells you to hit up the Ballas place in
East Las Santos, go there. When you get out and he tells you that
he is going to hit another hood, enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code. Follow him while using the Jetpack to walk fast. Look at
Sweet to see that he is in the passenger seat, driving. His hands
look like he is holding a steering wheel.

 Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission: Floating
guns:
 There are four Latino gang members on top of the train
that you have must catch and kill. They have guns that they will
shoot you with. Fail the mission intentionally, then find the
train that they where on. Instead of gang members, you will see
instead see floating guns that move and fire at you. Note: They
are invincible.
 WaddyTog . 
 Enter any area that is normally blocked
off:
 Early in the game, if you decide to explore town, roads,
and highways, you will find that certain areas are blocked off
(for example, as roadblocks on a bridge linking the town north
of the area that you start in). Normally, you cannot access areas
until later in the game as you meet certain requirements.. Follow
these steps, and you can get anywhere on the map. When you start,
either look for an aircraft to pilot, or enter a code to spawn
a flying vehicle or items (for example, the Hunter, Hydra, Jetpack,
or Stunt Plane. If you are a beginner at this game or not skilled
at flying a helicopter or any of the airplanes, the Jetpack is
recommended. It is easier to learn to use than some of the other
flying vehicles, and you will not have to worry about crashing
or ejecting by accident. A boat would also work. It is also recommended
that you enable a code to get extra weapons as well as making
sure that you have full health. Get in the flying vehicle. Make
sure there are no cops neary by, as they will think that you are
stealing a vehicle in front of them and will try to arrest you
if they see you get into it. Fly to the blocked off area. You
will know that an area is blocked off by the debris or roadblocks
on the roads. If done correctly, you will go into the area that
is normally blocked off and whatever desired. Your wanted level
will jump to about four stars. The cops will start attacking you
as soon as you arrive. Because of this, be prepared to get into
a big battle with the cops (they will even send helicopters after
you as well). If you are flying a helicopter or one of the fighter
planes, you can shoot down the helicopters and the cops are no
longer a big threat while you are in the air. If they kill or
bust you, you will be sent back to the area that you started at.
 Ryan Jones . 
 All locked shops open:
 During the opening sequence, wait until you get to
the part where Officer Tenpenny says&quot;So how you been Carl,
how&apos;s your wonderful family?&quot;. During this scene, enable
the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code. When it gets to the part where
they toss you out of the car, nothing will happen. You will see
a Jetpack with no one in it, and the&quot;Wasted&quot;message
will appear. When you re-appear at the hospital, it takes a while,
but you eventually regain control of your character. Go back to
Grove Street and find the Binco or the Gym in Ganton. You will
notice that they are open, along with every locked shop in town.
This is a useful trick for buying all the items you desire early.
 Seph Deathstorm . 
 Change song on radio:
 When in any vehicle except for anything involving the
law (police, army or ambulance), set it on a radio station to
your liking. Then, enable the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code.
If done correctly, the last song that was playing on that radio
station should be different. CJ&apos;s is also wearing a Jetpack inside
a car, and his legs are going through the bottom.

 Decapitated police officer driver:
 Get at least a one star wanted level. Make a police
car chase you on foot. Run away from it until you do not see the
officer sitting in the driver&apos;s seat then shoot in the area where
the officer&apos;s head would be. When the police car pulls up to you,
the officer&apos;s head will be blown off and the car will still chase
you. However, the officer will never get out.

the roads always suck you down. This may require numerous attempts.
Once you are over the fence, fly straight into the ground. You
will fall into a black pit for about thirty seconds. You will
hit a gray platform. You can still drive, but invisible walls
will block your car. If you manage a way out, you will be thrown
into an invisible lake. You will sink into water. You can still
hear people cheering. When your health runs out, a message will
appear stating&quot;You have been disqualified for destroying
your vehicle.&quot;You will appear outside. You will suddenly
drop dead, but your lung capacity will keep rising.

two-wheel bonus.
 Relyt_123 . 
 Sinking Dinghy:
 When piloting the Dinghy through the Boat School slalom
course, it is possible to capsize the boat. Sometimes when this
happens, CJ will die instantly, as if the boat had crushed him,
instead of continuing to drive the boat and having his Lung Capacity
Meter appear as would normally happen.
 Kotetsu369 . 
 Sinking Leviathan:
 The Leviathan helicopter is normally unsinkable. However
if you land it upside down in the water, it will begin to slowly
sink tail first. Once fully submerged, it will slowly rotate into
an upright position and become stuck, floating in a vertical position
underwater.

bumper is touching the it and accelerate. You should see the front
end of the monster move down, then pop up.
 Kevin Warner . 
 Dancing Packer:
 Find a Packer. Move the Right Analog-stick Down so that the railing moves up. Then, get out and walk up the ramp.
You will either do one of two things. You will stop but remain
walking (if this happens, jump); or you will walk straight. As
soon as you get under the top ramp, the packer will do some crazy
things, such as tilt so that only one side of tires is touching
the ground.
 Kevin Warner . 
 Backflipping Packer:
 Get a Monster truck and drive down by the docks in
Los Santos until you see a Packer. Line up the Monster with the
back end of the Packer and drive up the ramp. This should send
the Packer up in the air and do backflips.

 Enable the&quot;Cars fly away&quot;code. Steal a
train then go very fast until it goes off the tracks. If done
correctly one of the rear train cars will come forward and hit
the train engine. You will float away and will never be able to
escape.
 Huskic and Harris Inc. . 
Before the train arrives enable the&quot;Cars fly away&quot;code. Wait for the passenger or freight train. Get the train to
top speed. When it gets derailed it will start is descend. If
you remain inside it will take you upwards with it.
 johnny doyle . 
 Somersaulting Rhino:
 Go to Los Santos International Airport, and use the&quot;Spawn Jetpack&quot;code to reach the top of the communications
tower. Once on the top, there is a small circular platform with
a thin platform around it, with just enough room to stand on.
Stand on it, and make sure it is the border around the very top
platform. Enable the&quot;Spawn Rhino tank&quot;code. If done
correctly, the tank will spawn and immediately ricochet off the
top and do multiple spins and somersaults in the air before finally
hitting the ground below. This can be very funny if done correctly.
 Cody Murphy . 
 Flying Tanker:
 Steal a Tractor, and grab onto a Tanker (tractor-trailer
truck/18 wheeler). Back up to the front of the Tanker and latch
on to it. Drive forward, then turn sharply into circles. The Tanker
should go flying through the air. This may require several attempts.
 Leviazen . 
 Backflip with Tanker:
 Enable the&quot;Spawn Tanker&quot;code and&quot;Flying
Cars&quot;code. Get in the tanker and try to fly it. The tanker
will fly about one yard, but the tanker&apos;s trailer will then push
it back because it is not a vehicle and is not affected by the&quot;Flying Cars&quot;code, which will make the tanker do a
backflip. Note: The tanker may fall on its back most of the time,
in places that are hard to get out such as alleyways, buildings,
cars, etc.
 Luiz Pries . 
 Flying Rhino tank:
 Enable the&quot;Fast motion&quot;and&quot;Vehicle
of death&quot;codes. Hold R2 and drive forward. Shoot
as fast as possible and eventually the tank will start spinning
so fast that it will shoot up into the sky. [Screenshot] 
 stoner420 and Proscott52 . 
 Flying car:
 Spawn a monster truck and drive at medium speed. Drive
near a car and lightly hit it on one of its corners, or drive
the monster truck into the rear part of the car. If done correctly,
the car will fly straight up into the air and crash down. This
works best on a taxi and low riders.
 Jason Mercado . 
 Missing helicopter pilots:
 Get a three star wanted level and go to any high point
(for example, the tallest building in Downtown Los Santos, the
Big Pointy Building in San Fierro, or one of the towers on the
Garver or Gant bridges). Wait until a police helicopter comes
after you. When on your high point, the chopper will stay at about
the same altitude as you are. You can look inside the chopper
and see that there is no one inside.
 Cupcakekid9284 . 
Get a wanted level high enough to have helicopters chase you.
Get the Jetpack and fly up to the helicopters. You will notice
that there are no pilots in them.
 Peabodysface . 
 Police helicopter does not get destroyed:
 Get into an army aircraft (Hunter or Hydra). Get a
three star wanted level to get a police chopper after you. If
you are in an Hydra, go into hover mode. Get high up into the
air, and the police chopper will go after you. Shoot the chopper
down with your bullets or rockets. When the chopper is smoking
and spiraling towards the ground, quickly enable the&quot;Lower
wanted level&quot;code. Your wanted level will be lifted, and
the police chopper will stop spiraling towards the ground and
just fly away like normal. The chopper will still be smoking and
emitting explosions. The chopper is indestructible -- you cannot
bring down the smoking chopper afterwards.
 Cupcakekid9284 . 
 Make a policeman steal someone else&apos;s car:
 Enable the&quot;Cars fly away&quot;code. Enable the&quot;Spawn Quadbike&quot;code and ride it. Then, find a police
car. Hit the police car with the Quadbike very lightly. Get off
the Quadbike and quickly get in the car. It will not open the
first time. The policeman will fall out of his car, then start
running around in circles. When the police car is high enough,
he will enter someone else&apos;s car.
 [GoD]Daffy . 
 Drive around with parachute:
 Go to the top of Mount Chilliad with a parachute. If
you cannot find one, there is one on top of the mountain near
a Camper and a Journey. Equip your parachute and jump on the mountain
bike. You should trigger the downhill race. Then, jump off the
edge with the bike, but before you go over jump off and deploy
your parachute. You should spawn back on top with the bike, but
with your parachute still deployed.
 Kevin Warner . 
 Hovering cars:
 Enable the&quot;Flying cars&quot;,&quot;Drive on
water&quot;, and&quot;All cars have nitrous&quot;codes. Fly
up into the air and activate the nitrous. Fly directly at the
water and you should go under. Keep enabling the&quot;Armor,
health, and money&quot;code to avoid dying. Once you get to the
bottom, you should go underground. You will soon reappear on land
like a hovercar. Note: Use a fast car such as a Cheetah, XR 360,
etc.

bottom the plane will go into the rock. You will then appear on
land somewhere.
 Drew Fiertl . 
With a small hovercraft, drive for about thirty seconds out to
deep sea. Sink the hovercraft and stay inside. The hovercraft
will sink to the bottom of the sea and go through the floor. The

 Unlock importing and exporting. Buy a car from imports
and use the crane to get the car off the ship. When the car is
hovering over level ground, hold X so that the car goes
down as far as possible. Exit the crane and enter the car. The
crane will still have a hold on your vehicle. When it reaches
the end of the line, it rises from the ground and swings back.
 Richard Fox . 
 Dancing car:
 Enable the&quot;Cars fly away&quot;code. Get in the
floating car. Hold the Left Analog-stick in any direction
and the car will&quot;dance&quot;. Note: If you hold the Left

 Tro1995 . 
 Invincible car:
 Steal a car, drive it to a safe location, and get out
of it. Attach a remote bomb to the hood. Get back into the car
and any car you hit with the one you are driving will explode.
Your car will not sustain any damage and you will not lose any
health.
 Anthony Johnson and Brian Caswell . 
 Invincible flaming car:
 Enable the&quot;Vehicle of death&quot;code. Get in
a car then get out and have a few vehicles hit it. The car should
start smoking and erupt into flames. Get in the car and it will
remain flaming, but will not explode.
 LaZeR . 
 Invincible car:
 Enable the&quot;Vehicle of death&quot;code and get
into a car. This trick only works for one car at a time, so make
it something special. Then, deactivate the code while in the car.
This will return all the other cars in the game back to normal,
except for the one that you are in. The car you are in is indestructible,
even if you step outside of it and try to blow it up; only now
it cannot blow up the other cars on the road. Using a Pay N&apos; Spray
or any mod shop negates this effect. Note: Oddly enough, when
the cheat is active and you use a mod shop, the car is again destructible,
but can still blow up other cars. The next part makes the glitch
even more odd. Take your new, indestructible, yet less deadly,
car and put it into a garage. Save the game, and restart. The
car that you have in your garage is now bullet-proof, sort of.
Bullet can pop its tires and break its windows, but will not affect
any other part of the car. The gas tank can be shot repeatedly,
with no effect. The downside is that everything else about the
car is normal; hitting walls does damage and setting it on fire
or flipping it over can blow it up. You can shoot rockets at it
or satchel explosives, or grenades, to an extent. The fire from
the explosives eventually destroys the car, though being rocket-proof
would be useful while driving. Using mod shops and the Pay N&apos;
Spray does not affect your car&apos;s bulletproof exterior; you can
fix any crash problems and still remain bulletproof. Enabling
the code again turns everything back to normal, as though you
had put the code in for the first time.
 Tobydied . 
 Fiery car:
 Put any car in you garage. Shoot the car until it catches
on fire and is about to explode. Quickly walk away from the door
so that it will close. If done correctly, you will hear an explosion.
Walk up to the garage so it will open. The car that was blown
up should still be there, with fire around it as if it had actually
exploded.
 Zinraidragon . 
 Car blows up twice:
 This can be difficult to do. Stand on the side of the
car. Throw a grenade, making sure it hits the car, then run away.
If done correctly, the car should explode, catch on fire a few
seconds later, and blow up again.
 Matthew Garcia . 
 Save people from car explosion:
 Stand on the side of the car. Make sure it has a driver.
It helps if the car is stopped. Throw a grenade, making sure it
hits the car. Then, immediately after you press Circle ,
press Triangle to force the driver out. While C.J. is doing
it, flick the Left Analog-stick to prevent him from entering
the car. While C.J. is pulling the driver out, the car should
explode. The animation and the explosion will make C.J. appear
as if he is saving a life.
 Matthew Garcia . 
 Haunted boat:
 Get any Dighy boat (there is one by the dam). Enable
the&quot;Flying boats&quot;code. Get in it and drive it for
a short while (about two to five seconds). Exit the boat, but
do not jump in the water. Look at the engines they will still
be running. If you jump out, it will still be running but the
boat will drive away from you. If you chase it, it will go faster
and try to stay away from you. Note: If you start to drive it
again it will no longer be&quot;haunted&quot;. You can repeat
this as many times as desired.
 LilAnt72 . 
 Unlimited nitrous:
 Activate the nitrous in a car and put it inside your
garage. While the nitrous is still activated, shoot the car until
it explodes, then allow the garage door to close. When the door
opens again, the nitrous will always remain activated in that

 Disappearing satchels:
 There are many parts of the Julius Thruway East median
that satchel charges can go through one side and fall into the
median. This is usually best seen where the median begins to get
vertical. They will still take effect anyway when you use them.
Also, the bombs will rarely teleport to other sections of the
median when you load the inside of it with satchels.

one player on the edge of the building and the other player directly
behind him. Have the player on the edge jump off, and immediately
afterwards have the other in the same spot jump off. As soon as
one player lands, the second one will follow and land on him.
You will now notice that the second player will have almost full
health, using the first player as a cushion.

inside your house. However, they will not actually be there. You
can still talk to them, disassemble the gang, recruit them again,
and shoot at them. Your weapon skill will go up, but they will
not die.
 Dylan Jerman . 
 Invincible zombie:
 Find a cab driving around with a passenger. Note: This
may also work with other cars and your gang members. Take the
car and drive it into water (best done at the Glen Park area in
Los Santos). Get out of the car as it is driving into the water
and go ashore, so you can see the passenger trying to swim. After
a short while he or she will be dead, still are trying to swim.
Aim at the person and the target will appear black, indicating
that the person is dead. Fire at the car&apos;s gas tank to make it
explode and send the person flying ashore. They will now run around
for awhile, then act like a normal person. However, they will
be invincible and will still be targeted black.
 Jo Jaster . 
 Zombie homies:
 Wield a knife (tier 2 weapon), and walk up behind one
of your fellow gang members. Target him and press Up to
recruit him into your posse. Before he can turn around, press Triangle and cut his throat. Note that after you do so,
he will fall to the ground quite differently than the other members
of the population. As soon as he hits the ground, he will rise
back up&quot;from the dead&quot;.
 Fletcher . 
 Fire while out of ammunition:
 If you fire a gun out of a car in two player mode with
no ammunition, it will still fire but no bullets will actually
be shot out.
 Gypsy_070 . 
 Unlimited ammunition:
 This trick will effect the combat shotgun and the SMG.
Go to a shooting range in an Ammu-Nation. Quit the challenge after
it starts. You will notice that your combat shotgun and SMG have
doubled the amount of ammunition you had before you went in. Keep
entering and exiting the challenge and you will notice the ammunition
indicator has disappeared below the picture of those two weapons.
When this has happened, you will have unlimited ammunition for
the combat shotgun and SMG.
 Neil . 
 Make the moon bigger and smaller:
 Using the sniper rifle, shoot the moon at night. It
will begin to shrink. After it gets to a certain size, it will
begin to grow again.
 Goodolrockytop04 . 
 Spinning moon:
 Get into a plane. Change the view to first person.
Once the moon appears, start spinning and the moon will also spin
as you do. This can also work in a car with the&quot;Flying cars&quot;code enabled. As long as you are looking out from the windshield,
and have the moon in sight, the moon will spin as you spin.
 Devon Hewitt . 
 Fast pool ball:
 Go to any bar with a sniper rifle in hand. Play pool
but do not shoot. Exit the pool table and shoot a ball with the
sniper rifle. It will go so fast that it almost cannot be seen.
To get the full effect, play a game to where one to three balls
are remaining, then repeat the process.
 Ian . 
 Floating pool balls:
 Go into a bar and start shooting the balls on the pool
table with a sniper rifle. They will sometimes fly off of the
table but not fall to the ground. Instead, they will float in
mid-air as if there was still a table under them.
 jerry7134 . 
 Keep burglar mask:
 Start a burglary mission. During the mission, go into
a barber shop and walk to the red circle but do not change your
haircut yet. Stay in the seat until the end of the mission. After
the mission, change your haircut but do not buy it. Instead, press Triangle to cancel the haircut and press Triangle again to get up from the seat. If done correctly, the barber will
shave the burglar mask on your face (walking changes into sneaking).
Note: If you die you will lose the mask.
 mie.sakkinen . 
 Moving fire:
 Notice that when you use your flamethrower and are
aimed at the floor, you create a small flame or a few that expire
in awhile. When they begin to arise, the fire truck arrives and
extinguishes the fire. To do this glitch, eat something beforehand
to prevent hunger. This may take some time. Do a fire line with
your flamethrower of at least four flames horizontally with no
cops nearby (or they begin to chase you). Keep watching the fire,
centering by using the R3 camera view, trying not to move
CJ only if necessary. If the fire truck arrives to extinguish
the fire, repeat this until you get a whirlwind of fire of a decent
size. When you get it, it cannot be extinguished. If you keep
it centered with the R3 camera view and watch, after awhile
the fire truck leaves the fire alone. The fire physics are strange,
but if you move the Right Analog-stick slowly and walk
just a little bit, you can aim the fire. Keep doing this and you
can move it in a certain direction. Do not worry if the flames
are close to you, they do not cause damage until you move CJ to
the flames. If there are pedestrians walking to the flames ,they
will not suffer any damage, even though they do not runaway .However,
vehicles can take damage. To make them explode they must be stopped
for a certain period of time. Try it on traffic lights or when
another vehicle is blocking the path. This is particularly useful
on highways where cars travel at high speed. There are multiple
wrecks and you can wait to watch them all explode . You will not
get a wanted level for doing this.
 Marriozsuxs . 
 Set fire to a car with no fire appearing
from flamethrower:
 Wait for the traffic lights to turn red and the cars
to stop. Stand about three meters away from the car in front with
a flamethrower. Tap Circle and you will hear the sound
of the flamethrower, but see no flame. The car will catch fire.
 steven alex . 
 Drive forever on fire:
 Enable the&quot;Vehicle of death&quot;code. Get in
a car and disable the code while inside. Get out and set yourself
on fire (completing the firefighter missions first recommended).
Then, quickly get in your vehicle. Your vehicle will be on fire,
as if it were going to explode. However, it will not, and you
can drive around like this for as long as desired. To stop this
effect, go to a Pay N&apos; Spray, garage, or mod garage.
 Phantasma25 . 
 No remote explosion:
 Set a remote explosive then get in a car and drive
about three blocks away from it. Return, and you will not see
it anywhere. When you use the remote to detonate it, nothing will
happen. Enable the&quot;Unlimited ammunition&quot;code, set
an explosive, then detonate it. Even after you detonate it, you
will notice that you will still have the remote. You can press
it, nothing will happen, and you will always have it.

 SQRL1141 . 
 Floating bodies:
 Get a person to die on top of a car. Note: You cannot
kill them by hitting them with the car. Then, get in the car they
died on top of. The car will move, but the body will remain in
its position, off the ground.
 A Cercek . 
 Flying fish:
 Get a rocket or grenade launcher and go near a river
or beach with fish. Shoot the fish with a rocket or grenade. The
fish will fly out of the water and swim around in mid air.
 Kody Morse . 
Go to any beach area. Swim a little bit underwater to find a school
of fish, dolphin, or turtle in the shallow parts. Get back to
the beach where you are neck deep in the water, but still able
to use a weapon. Aim the rocket launcher in the part of water
where you last saw the aforementioned aquatic life. Fire off a
few rockets. If all goes well, you should see a splash on the
surface of the water and whatever you shot will come out and start
flying around in the air.
 peezie . 
 Falling pedestrians:
 Enable the&quot;Recruit anyone into your gang&quot;code. Recruit three pedestrians, then get into an ambulance. Enable

of the ambulance. Note: You can also do this with your girlfriend
in the ambulance. After she bails out, the heart icon will still
appear on the map, indicating that she is still alive and available
for dating.
 AngeGarga . 
 Invincible pedestrians:
 Do the following next to or near a Pay N&apos; Spray. Steal
a car that has one person driving and one person in the passenger
side. Steal it from the driver&apos;s side. Once you are driving, make

Spray. Once it is done repainting the car, the pedestrian will
get out. He or she will be invincible and cannot be killed.
 Geralds Mod . 
Get a bike or something easy to climb into. Go close to a Pay
N&apos; Spray and find a person to hit. If they chase you, get on the

is in there with you. When you come out, try killing the person.
They will not die.
 Jonae Lowe . 
 Dead girlfriend datable:
 When on a date with your girlfriend, enable the&quot;Super

edge. Before they jump, drive a little bit farther until both
of you are over the edge. Then he will pull you out of the car
and you will fall into the water. You can now walk underwater.
 joshua kennedy . 
 Drive underwater:
 Enable the&quot;Cars drive on water&quot;and&quot;Cars
fly&quot;codes. Spawn a Tanker and drive on the water. You will
do a back-flip. If you go fast enough, you will dive to the bottom
and be able to drive underwater. You can also shoot out of vehicle
while underwater. If you leave the water, while surfacing the
tanker will jump very high then land back on dry ground.
 Gabriel Delacorte . 
Enable the&quot;Maximum lung capacity&quot;code and get any
desired car. Drive into the water, and you can now drive underwater.

the land on the start screen is very tiny. Then, turn around and
try to go back. You should be stuck in an infinite loop in the
water. Note: When you enable the boat or vehicle codes it may
seem difficult to get into them.
 Brandon Baskerville . 
 Stupid boat drivers:
 To do this glitch, you must find a boat which is being
driven by someone. Get near the boat and press Square to
climb on it. The boat driver will stop driving the boat, and will
try to get of it. However he will walk into the water and drown.
You can also do this glitch with police boats, but you will need
to get a high wanted level.
 eriks matulis . 
 No water:
 To do this glitch you must get a Sea Sparrow. You can
get one at Bayside Marina (where the boat school is found) at
a helipad. The Sea Sparrow sometimes will spawn there. When you
get it, land on water and exit the helicopter, which will leave
the door open. Swim to it and look through the glass. You will
see land where the water was suppose to be at but it is not there.

 To get under the map from anywhere, enable the&quot;Flying
cars&quot;code. Get a car and fly very far out to sea, almost
off of map. Then, make sure you have a lot of lung capacity and
dive straight into the water. Let your car float to the bottom
and it will go though the floor. Your screen will get darker and
darker. Note: This will take away CJ&apos;s muscle and fat. Also, if
you go under too far, you will be spawned close to the shore.

and the basketball will bounce by itself as if you were bouncing
it, but you actually are not. If you try to fly forward you will,
but you will go slightly side to side. As you fly/strafe in mid
air, the basketball will continue to bounce by itself. To get
rid of the jetpack you must first get rid of the basketball. To
