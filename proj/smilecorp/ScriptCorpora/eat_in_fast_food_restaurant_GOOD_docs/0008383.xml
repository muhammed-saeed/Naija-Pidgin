 Proximity to airport and prompt shuttle service.

 Very convenient, clean&amp;spacious rooms. Breakfast next door was far too limited--we ended up buying breakfast just so we could have fruit&amp;cereal. 

“Convenient, clean,&amp;good value if a bit noisy.”

 Cheap price, free hot breakfast at adjacent diner, near airport, near car rental hertz. Very busy location however with revenue intaking they are not maintaining the motel. Also not picking up the phone in a timely manner. 

“Extremely badly maintained. I am surprised Quality Inn is allowing this owner to keep franchise. Very busy for a Sunday, hotel looked like full, however, very limited staff. Exit areas out of motel area looked unsafe. Carpet in hallways and other areas were extremely bad. Television sets are not working properly. Cable TV, freezes up on cable channels. I thought that was weird. Pillows were not good enough for sleep. I am really surprised even with a full motel they are looking like they are raping the Quality in franchise and the Quality Inn franchise is letting this owner get away with this.”

 Location to the airport. The hotel clerks are slow and speak poor English. 

“The airport shuttle was terrible you waited to be picked up and dropped off. I could have walked to the terminal faster crossing I-70 and gotten there safer and faster. Summary: avoid staying at the Quality Inn Airport at due to poor service/no service across the board.”

 Excellent location, good size room. Non caring staff. 

“1. The hotel had an unpleasant smell in the hallways as we arrived from lack of air circulation. 2. The room did not have a functioning air unit. 3. Requested wake up call for 3:45 AM to catch our air flight did not get that call. 4. Requested shuttle be waiting downstairs as we were behind and needed to get to the airport immediately, shuttle not available for 45 minutes. No coffee. No courtesy.”

 Beds were comfortable. Bathroom had bold! The bathroom in general is unpleasant. 

“The clerk was nice but she had several unsightly tattoos on arms and hands. The room had a nice appearance but when we looked at the details of the bathroom, it was run down. There was mold on the walls around the tub, and door. The coating on the tub was peeling off. Also the air conditioner was loud and did not cool the room.”

 Very little. Service, pool water was dark green, poor all around. 

“We were to check in at 3, but they told us they were cleaning rooms, come back in 45 minutes or so. After driving 4-5 hours, last thing I wanted to do was to drive around more. So we went to the pool thinking we could relax. The pool water was a dark green and looks like hadnt been used/cleaned in years. Hotel room, once we got in, had trash sacks from fast food restaurant with half eaten food. The smoke detector was hanging from the ceiling. We needed towels the 2nd day (they didnt replace them) and when we called the front desk they said they were out and that we could come down to the desk and get another room key and go to that room and get the towels from there. Horrible experience.”

 Location. Rude employees, no hot water, room not cleaned first 2 days, very dirty, heater didn&apos;t worked. 

“We are in our 50s and travel regularly. This is the absolute worst hotel and service we have ever seen! Our room was very dusty and dirty. I had a mini asthma attack the first night because of this. Three lamps were either burned out or had no bulb. There was no hot water. We did not receive any housekeeping services until our 3rd day there. We complained the first day and were switched to another room. We found dirty towels in the shower. Still no hot water. Also, still no housekeeping. Employees were rude. However, we will never stay in this hotel again even though we regularly visit family in St. Louis. It was just horrible! (We have written to the manager of the hotel).”

“We had a delayed flight by about two hours. We were very late getting into St. Louis. The staff of the hotel was very courteous and waited for our arrival before closing down the front desk. They also provided us with shuttle service and let us park the vehicle before we left for our trip even though we were not staying there until our return home.”

 It wasn&apos;t anything special. I can&apos;t think of anything that I liked. The maids don&apos;t do a very good job of cleaning. 

“Overall the hotel served its purpose, but our stay could have been better. When we checked in they were having trouble with some locks on the doors not working. Our room wasn&apos;t the cleanest. There was some trash in a corner that was in plain site that hadn&apos;t been picked up. We wanted to use the pool our second night there and the pool was so cloudy I couldn&apos;t see the steps into the pool. Then we didn&apos;t have any wash clothes our second night. I asked twice for wash clothes and never got any. I think they were having other problems that night as well. Also I think I overheard one employee say that there were students living in the hotel. So that seems kind of weird.”

 Location. Location was the only thing I was happy with. This place is a PIT. 

“The carpets in the halls and on the steps are filthy (surely I&apos;m not the only one who saw that vomit). The carpet in our room had not been vacuumed for a long time. There was peanut skins, paper, a pill and God only knows what else on the floor at the edge of the bed frame. I asked for the carpet to be cleaned on Sat. as my 2 year old Grandchild was going to be visiting. The bathroom tile was broken and the tub leaked, lots of soap scum.

 There was nothing good about this hotel to tell! It was dirty, hot, smelled, and we ended up going through Travelocity to book a much better hotel for the same price. 

“The hotel was out of the way and not close to anything. It was damp and hot, and there were cracks in the walls. There were crickets in the walls all around us and our room was in the very back, so it was noisy. The bathroom was dirty and the beds were awful. Don&apos;t stay here!”

 The staff, free parking, computer for use. Room service comes a bit early. 

“I was moving to the area and my apartment didn&apos;t work out (it was in a bad part of downtown). I drove eight hours to get here and needed a place to stay until I could find an apartment. The staff was so understanding and wonderful! They let me park my U-Haul in their lot and gave me tips on where to look for an apartment. The hotel was clean and they had computers with high speed internet, which helped a lot in my apartment search. They even gave me a discount on my room since I was considered &quot;in distress.&quot; I&apos;ve never been treated so well by a hotel in my life. My only gripe was that room service came a bit too early for my taste. However, I told the front desk and they changed our room cleaning time, which was great.”

 I had the check-out time incorrect and wasn&apos;t charged for my mistake. The website said there were refrigerators and microwaves in the rooms and that was not true for my room. 

“The Airport hotel has a friendly staff and it was pretty clean. I did find a dirty flip-flop in my room which told me that they probably didn&apos;t do that great of a cleaning job. The pool was pretty clean (except for a nice amount of bugs) though. I did ask the attendant about the fridge/microwave and was told there weren&apos;t any in the rooms. I saw a microwave in someone else&apos;s room the next day.”

 Beds were okay. No remote for TV, halls were dirty. 

“Hallways were filthy, rooms were fairly clean but furniture old and worn. Cracks in walls. Would not recommend it.”

 This hotel was convenient and had a 24 hour airport shuttle. There was no continental breakfast or even anything to purchase. 

“Nice basic hotel for the value. This hotel is conveniently located very close to the airport. There is a 24 hour airport shuttle that was very helpful to us.”
