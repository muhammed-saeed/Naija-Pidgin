Description:

 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

 [0001] Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to waste
 management. Particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to
 improved methods and apparatus for handling waste products. More
 particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to trash
 compactors.

 BACKGROUND 

 [0002] Many fast food restaurants and cafeterias typically provide a refuse
 or waste container near the establishment exit and at other convenient
 locations where, at the conclusion of a meal, the patron&apos;s tray
 containing napkins, paper cups, food wrappers, placemats, etc. can be
 dumped into the waste receptacle by the patron rather than by restaurant
 staff. However, it is up to the restaurant staff to periodically empty
 these trash receptacles by bagging the waste materials and then
 depositing the bagged waste in a dumpster for pick-up by a refuse removal
 service.

 [0003] Since the waste material falls by gravity in the conventional waste
 receptacles currently used, the waste material is not packed particularly
 dense and frequent emptying of the waste receptacles by staff personnel
 is required to prevent overflow. The need to frequently empty the refuse
 receptacles can be a significant cost item for restaurant operation.
 Moreover, since refuse haulers generally charge by volume and not by
 weight, loosely-compacted bagged refuse takes up an inordinate amount of
 space in a dumpster adding to the cost of refuse disposal.

 [0004] A compactor is a machine or mechanism used to reduce the size of
 waste material through compaction. Normally powered by hydraulics,
 compactors take many shapes and sizes. In landfill sites for example, a
 large bulldozer with spiked wheels is used to drive over waste deposited
 by waste collection vehicles (WCVs). WCVs themselves incorporate a
 compacting mechanism which is used to increase the payload of the vehicle
 and reduce the number of times it has to empty. This usually takes the
 form of hydraulically-powered sliding plates which sweep out the
 collection hopper and compress the material into what has already been
 loaded.

 [0005] Different compactors are used in scrap metal processing, the most
 familiar being the car crusher. Such devices can either be of the
 &quot;pancake&quot; type, where a scrap automobile is flattened by a huge
 descending hydraulically-powered plate. The other type is the baling
 press, where the automobile is compressed from several directions until
 it resembles a large cube.

 [0006] In construction, there are three main types of compactor; the plate
 compactor, the &quot;jumping jack&quot; and the road roller. The roller type
 compactors are used for compacting crushed rock as the base layer
 underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate compactor
 has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade,
 while the jumping jack compactor has a smaller foot. The jumping jack
 type is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water
 or gas supply pipes etc. Road rollers may also have vibrating rollers.

 [0007] Many retail and service businesses, such as fast food, restaurants,
 and hotels, use compactors to reduce the volume of non-recyclable waste
 as well as curb nuisances such as rodents and smell. In the hospitality
 industry tolerance for such nuisances is particularly low. These
 compactors typically come in electric and hydraulic operation, with quite
 a few loading configurations. Most popular loading configurations fall
 under the following: (1) Ground-Access; (2) Walk-On; and (3) Secured
 Indoor Chute.

 [0008] These compactors are almost exclusively of welded steel construction
 for two reasons: durability under pressure and exposure to the elements,
 as compactors are installed either completely outdoors or sometimes under
 a covered loading dock.

 [0009] There are also trash compactors designed for residential use which,
 likewise, reduces the volume, smell, and rodent problems of garbage. This
 can be especially valuable for households which regularly dispose of
 items such as disposable-diaper boxes or the non-edible portions of
 vegetables from a large garden. Related to this, there are frequently
 limits to the number of trash bags/receptacles left outside for
 residential pickup, which further renders such compactors beneficial to
 such households.

 [0010] A need, therefore, exists for a refuse compactor capable of
 compressing fast food restaurant trash so emptying is infrequently
 required and a greater mass of waste material can be contained in a
 smaller volume. Embodiments of the present invention provide a unique
 solution to this problem.

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

 [0011] In some embodiments, a refuse compactor for a restaurant facility
 may include one or more of the following features: (a) a unitized frame
 coupled to a base plate having a first side panel and a second side

 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT 

 [0022] The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in
 the art to make and use the present teachings. Various modifications to
 the illustrated embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in
 the art, and the generic principles herein may be applied to other
 embodiments and applications without departing from the present
 teachings. Thus, the present teachings are not intended to be limited to
 embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent
 with the principles and features disclosed herein. The following detailed
 description is to be read with reference to the figures, in which like
 elements in different figures have like reference numerals. The figures,
 which are not necessarily to scale, depict selected embodiments and are
 not intended to limit the scope of the present teachings. Skilled
 artisans will recognize the examples provided herein have many useful
 alternatives and fall within the scope of the present teachings. While
 embodiments of the present invention are directed towards trash
 compactors for use in fast food restaurants, it is fully contemplated
 embodiments of the present invention could be utilized anywhere, such as
 schools, workplaces, government buildings, etc, in any fashion without
 departing from the spirit of the invention.

 [0023] Shown in FIG. 1 is an isometric view of a trash compactor designed
 for use in fast food restaurants. It is indicated generally by number 10.
 In this figure, frame 11 forms an enclosure having a pair of sidewalls 8
 and a rear wall 7. A door 13 forms a front of compactor 10 having an
 upper portion 13&apos; and lower portion 13&apos;&apos; with handle 3. It has an opening
 15 through which restaurant waste or the like can be deposited. The waste
 is adapted to fall into a polyethylene refuse bag 9 used to line box 156
 of a removable cart assembly 17 when door 13&apos;&apos; is closed and locked. A
 removable plastic top panel 19 has upwardly projecting ribs 21 adjacent
 the side and rear perimeters of top panel 19. The space between ribs 21
 provides a convenient place for serving trays to be stacked once the
 waste has been deposited into cart 17 through opening 15.

 [0024] Frame 11 can be made of two pieces 5 and 6 of sheet metal which are
 shaped to provide a front portion 4, a side wall 8, and half the rear
 wall 7 of frame 11. The construction of frame 11 is discussed in more
 detail in a co-pending patent application titled &quot;Trash Compactor
 Cabinet&quot;, Ser. No. ______, filed on ______, the contents of which are
 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Front 4 of frame 11 has
 a small front facing surface for attaching door 13 for access to
 compactor 10. Rear 7 has a V-shaped indentation for allowing a passage
 between rear 7 and shelving in compactor 10 and to give rear 7 added
 strength. Rear 7 also has a V-shaped overlap portion which connects two
 pieces 5 and 6 of frame 11 and adds strength to compactor 10. Shelves can
 be attached to the walls in frame 11 which provide strength for frame 11
 and support the mechanisms for compacting trash.

 [0025] During use, door 13 will be closed and locked. Door 13&apos;&apos; can be
 opened to remove cart 17 once it is filled with compacted waste material.
 A motor-operated hinged panel 23 normally blocks opening 15, but swings
 to an open position when a proximity sensor (FIG. 5) detects the approach
 of a patron and an audio message is played. The manner in which this is
 accomplished will be explained in considerably more detail as the
 description of embodiments continues.

 [0026] Referring then to FIG. 2, there is shown a front isometric view of a
 waste compactor constructed in accordance with embodiments of the present
 invention. It is indicated generally by numeral 10, while frame 11 is
 shown in a hidden manner to display interior components of compactor 10.
 Frame 11 can be coupled to a flat, generally rectangular steel base 12
 mounted on four caster wheels, as at 14, to facilitate moving and
 positioning of compactor 10. Welded to upper surface 16 of base 12 at the
 rear of its opposed sides can be frame 11.

 [0027] As can be seen in FIG. 3, there is welded to rear 7 and side walls 8
 proximate the upper end thereof a steel tray on which is supported an
 electronic control board assembly 28. Electrical power is delivered to
 compactor 10 by way of a power cord 30 adapted to plug into a connector
 32 on the rear of tray 26.

 [0028] Disposed below tray 26 and also welded to rear 7 and side walls 8 is
 a support plate 34 on which is mounted an electric motor 36 coupled in
 driving relation to a hydraulic pump 38.

 [0029] Referring to the isometric view of the frame assembly shown in FIG.
 4, also welded to side walls 8 at a location proximate the upper ends
 thereof is a steel tray 40. It has a vertical rear wall 42 affixed to
 tray 26. The rear and front walls are connected by a horizontal,
 forwardly projecting floor plate 46. To add additional rigidity to steel
 tray 40, a steel plate 48 located approximately midway across the width
 dimension of steel tray 40 is welded to rear plate 42, front plate 44,
 and floor plate 46.

 [0030] Welded to rear plate 42 and to side wall 8 at its upper end a steel
 arm 50 passes through a notch 52 formed in front wall 44. Secured to arm
 50 is a door hinge pin 54, as shown in FIG. 2. A further door hinge pin
 56 is affixed to the front edge of base 12 by a forwardly projecting ear
 58. Hinge pins 54 and 56 are vertically aligned with one another,
 allowing door 13 to be suspended thereon. Door 13 as well as coverings 11
 are preferably fabricated from fiberglass.

 [0031] Frame structure 8 shown in FIG. 4 also includes a box-like housing
 62 in which a door lock assembly is to be contained.

 [0032] Referring momentarily to the exploded view of FIG. 5 and the view of
 FIG. 6, there is indicated generally by numeral 64 a compaction plate
 assembly. It includes a cast aluminum plate or platen 66 pivotally
 mounted to channel support members side panels. The pivot connection
 includes a pair of compactor plate bearings 70, disposed along the
 side-rear edges of compaction plate 66, through which a cylindrical pin
 72 extends to allow rotation of the platen 66 about an axis 71. A metal
 brace 204 provides support along the rear 7 to prevent buckling of rear 7
 and side walls 8 during the compaction cycle.

 [0033] With continued reference to compaction plate assembly 64 of FIG. 5,
 affixed to channel support member 68 is a hydraulic ram 76. Ram 76
 attaches to rear 7 with pin assembly 74 and is oriented where pressurized
 hydraulic fluid from pump 38 causes compaction plate 66 to execute a
 compaction stroke whereby trash deposited in the cart 17 is crushed and
 compressed against backside 78 of cart 17. Pin assembly 74 is bolted to
 metal plate 206 extending across rear 7 to provide support for rear 7
 during the compaction cycle. Compaction plate assembly 64 is less
 expensive than prior compaction devices. Fewer materials are required for
 the construction of compaction plate assembly 64. Guide rails typically
 required for compaction devices are eliminated due to ram 76 being
 connected to platen 66 at one end and rear 7 at the other end. Thus ram
 76 moves through its range of motion without guide rails. Further, only
 one hydraulic cylinder is necessary, substantially reducing the cost from
 prior compactors requiring two or more hydraulic cylinders. In addition,
 platen 66 is not fully supported by ram 76. Instead, platen 66 is
 supported by ram 76 and side walls 8 and rear 7 thus reducing the amount
 of lifting ram 76 must perform.

 [0034] Platen 66 performs a semicircular path from uncompressed state A to
 compressed state B when ram 76 is hydraulically energized causing ram 76
 to press downward. Ram 76 is pivotally mounted to platen 66 at bracket 90
 and held in place with pin 92. Bracket 90 is located off center and close
 to support member 68. This causes platen 66 to travel in a semicircular
 path as ram 66 extends outward rotating about axis 71 and thus all waste
 material is pushed and compacted toward rear 78 of cart 17. Further, cart
 17 can have an incline 200 from front to rear to assure no trash
 accumulates on platen 66 when it is brought back into the upward position
 &quot;A&quot;.

 [0035] To avoid having trash deposited on the top surface of the compaction
 plate 66, compaction plate 66 can be inclined as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3
 as waste is being deposited through door opening 15. However, in order to
 effect compaction, plate 66 must assume a declined disposition during its
 semicircular compaction stroke and return to its inclined disposition at
 the end of the compaction stroke.

 [0036] Returning again to the exploded view of FIG. 5, waste entry door 23
 is pivotally mounted to a pair of door hinge arms 108 and 110 which
 fasten by screws to floor plate 46 (FIG. 4) of the steel tray 40.
 Fastened to the inside surface of hinge panel 23 is a door motion arm 112
 having an arcuate cam profile 114 formed therein along its length
 dimension. Also mounted on floor plate 46 of the tray 40 is a door
 actuating motor 116 which is coupled through a gear box 118 to one end of
 an arm 120 supporting a cam follower roller 122 on the free end thereof.
 Arm 120 is joined to an output shaft of gear box 118, as is a further cam
 (not shown). This further cam cooperates with MicroswitchesÂ® 124 and 1
 26 which are connected in circuit with motor 116 to cause arm 120 to be
 rotated 180Â° upon each actuation of motor 116.

 [0037] Roller 122 is positioned to cooperate with arcuate surface 114 on
 arm 112 so as arm 112 moves through 180Â°, waste entry door 23
 swings open to the position shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, allowing waste to be
 dumped into cart 17. Because the platform of the compaction plate
 assembly is inclined, it does not interfere with the opening of hinged
 panel waste entry door 23.

 [0038] The actuation of motor 116 is controlled by a commercially available
 motion sensor 128 mounted to a bracket 130 on an upper rear surface of
 main entry door 13. Thus, when door 13 is closed and locked, as a patron
 approaches the waste compactor 10, the motion is detected and a signal is
 sent to motor 116 to initiate a 180Â° swing of arm 120 to first
 open waste entry door 23. As the patron moves away after depositing
 refuse into compactor 10, the action is again sensed and motor 116 is
 triggered to rotate arm 120 an additional 180Â°, allowing waste
 entry door 23 to reclose. To prevent door 23 from bouncing upon closure
 thereof, a permanent magnet 129 is mounted on tray 46 (FIG. 4) attracting
 a ferrous metal disk 131 suspended by a threaded rod from an appendage on
 arm 112 as shown in FIG. 7.

 [0039] A programmable logic array comprising electronic circuit 28 is
 configured to initiate a compaction cycle after a predetermined number of
 openings of waste entry door 23. For example, and without limitation,
 electronic circuit 28 may be programmed for patrons approaching and
 depositing refuse into cart 17 and initiate a compaction cycle whereby
 refuse is compressed against the rear wall of cart 17.

 [0040] To prevent waste entry door 23 from opening during the compaction
 cycle an interlock is provided to block waste entry door 23 from opening
 during a compaction cycle. Specifically, a solenoid 132 is mounted on a
 rear surface of rear end plate 42 of steel tray 40 with solenoid plunger
 134 extending through a hole drilled in the plate. When the solenoid is
 energized, plunger 134 extends in a forward direction to overlay and
 interfere with a stop bracket 136 affixed to swing arm 112 to which the
 waste entry door 23 attaches. The pin on the solenoid thus blocks waste
 entry door 23 from being swung open so long as solenoid 132 is energized.
 At the completion of the compaction stroke and return of the compaction
 plate to its elevated and tilted disposition, the solenoid is
 deenergized, retracting pin 134, thus allowing swinging movement of waste
 entry door 23 under control of motor assembly 116.

 [0041] The door lock for securing door 13 can have a socket head bolt 138
 designed to pass through a sleeve 140 mounted in door 13. Bolt 138 is
 sufficiently long to project through the thickness dimension of door 13
 and into a threaded block 142. Block 142 is urged forward within the
 confines of the box-like housing 62 by a helical spring 144. Using an
 Allen wrench, bolt 138 may be rotated to draw door 13 against vertical
 edge 146 of inner wall 148 disposed in the frame and preventing door 13
 from being opened by persons not having an appropriate Allen wrench.

 [0042] To prevent actuation of the compaction plate assembly if door 13 is
 open, a magnetic proximity switch of a well-known type has its switch
 contact member 147 fastened to front wall 44 of steel tray 40 at a
 position where it will be actuated when a magnet 150 is affixed to the
 inside surface of main door panel 13 when brought into close proximity to
 it. Thus, only when door 13 is closed will the switch contacts of
 magnetic switch 148 be closed to permit motor 36 to drive the hydraulic
 pump to run.

 [0043] Cart 17 includes a base tray 152 mounted on wheels 154 and supported
 on the base tray as a separable trash-receiving chamber 156. Chamber 156
 has four sidewalls and an open top. For convenience, a polyethylene bag 9
 may be inserted into chamber 1 56 for ultimately containing the trash
 once compacted. A pull handle 158 is pivotally attached to base 152 to
 facilitate removing a filled and compacted mass of waste material through
 open door 13 and to a temporary storage site. Once at the storage site,
 tube-defining chamber 156 can be lifted free of tray 152, leaving a
 compacted trash-filled bag for ultimate disposal by a trash hauling
 company.

 [0044] With reference to FIG. 8, a process diagram showing a method of
 compacting restaurant waste in an embodiment of the present invention is
 shown. In operation, door 23 opens when motion sensor 128 detects a
 patron moving close to compactor 10 at state 102. After the patron has
 deposited their waste into cart 17, door 23 closes at state 104.
 Compactor 10 then determines how many times door 23 has opened to
 determine if compactor 10 needs to initiate compaction at state 106. If
 door 23 has opened a predetermined amount of times (e.g., between 5-10),
 then compactor 10 proceeds to state 108 to initiate compaction. If door
 23 has not opened the predetermined amount of times, then compactor 10
 returns to state 106. When compaction has been completed, compactor 10
 returns to state 106 to begin counting door openings once again.

 [0045] It has also been found desirable to mount an audible speaker 160 to
 front wall 44 of steel tray 40 where the speaker is coupled by wires to a
 voice chip integrated circuit on electronics panel 28. As in many
 telephone answering machines, these voice chips may be used to store
 several short audio messages played each time a patron causes waste entry
 door 23 to swing open as a marketing tool. The messages may thank the
 patron for visiting the restaurant or for dumping his/her trash, etc.

 [0046] Thus, embodiments of the COMPACTOR WITH PIVOTING COMPACTION PLATE
 are disclosed. One skilled in the art will appreciate the present
 teachings can be practiced with embodiments other than those disclosed.
 The disclosed embodiments are presented for purposes of illustration and
 not limitation, and the present teachings are limited only by the
 following claims.
