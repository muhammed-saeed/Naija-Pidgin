		Outer Banks Vacation Tips - Dining and Entertainment 
 
 


Dining Out


Obtain coupon and discount books and magazines when you first arrive.  You will find many specials to save you time and money in your dining experiences.

For &quot;All-You-Can-Eat&quot; dining our big tip is to arrive early for dinner.  By arriving early you do not have to wait in line, you ensure your group a table, you get fresh food, and you leave yourself plenty of time to walk-off the calories afterwards!

Network with others on vacation.  Find out their thoughts and preferences for dining out in the Outer Banks.  Your neighbors on the beach are a great asset for information.  Don&apos;t be shy!  Introduce yourself and ask for suggestions.  After a couple years, you could be the one giving out the advice!





 
Fast Food


Sometimes it&apos;s fast food that you need or your kids are craving.  Just a heads up tip on fast food - some places on your Outer Banks vacation trip serve fast food very slowly.  Some franchises are doing just fine with their service, but be forewarned, there are some fast food places that are just downright slow!  I was at a very popular kids fast food restaurant several years ago that had the slowest service I have ever seen in my life!  There was no multi-tasking going on, there was no planning going on, and there was definitely no process management happening!  If you ordered 10 items with your meal, it took them 12 trips to bring it to your tray!  You&apos;ve been warned.
 
 Dining In 

If someone on your Outer Banks vacation trip loves to cook  than they will be right at home at most rentals on the Banks.  You&apos;ll find great food prices to go along with the fresh produce, meats and seafood that abound up and down the coastal strip.  Most rental properties come with kitchens stocked full of everything you would need to prepare a great meal.  From normal pots, pans and utensils to extras such as seafood steamers and woks, many rental kitchens will make you feel right at home in their kitchens.

Head to the nearest Outer Banks grocery store for most of your needs.  A big tip on grocery stores is to join their savings clubs on your first trip to their store.  This will get you in on their weekly discounts and save some money.

For specialty food and drink items, check out the smaller markets for fresh, &quot;off-the-boat&quot; seafood, meats and poultry, and fine wines.

If you are a hardcore barbecue griller then make sure your rental comes with an outside grill.  Bring along some of your favorite grilling recipes and go-to-town in the Outer Banks outdoors.
 

Night Life


For those of you who prefer the bar scene every now on then, the Outer Banks does not disappoint!  Every town and village along highway 12 has multiple pubs, and bistros to wet your whistle and entertain you.  One gotcha to watch for - speed traps at night, especially in the north Outer Banks areas.  Always use a designated driver or take a cab.  Dont drink and drive and spoil a great vacation.
