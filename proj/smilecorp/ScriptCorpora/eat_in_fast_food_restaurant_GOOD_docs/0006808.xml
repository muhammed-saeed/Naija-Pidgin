 ATTENTION:
 RESTAURANT AND CAFE OWNERS AND
 MANAGERS
 

 At
 Last... A Comprehensive Set Of
 Restaurant Training Manuals To Train Your
 Staff From Good To GREAT In As Little As 60
 Minutes.. 
 Revealed in
 these   restaurant training
 manuals  is
 the step by step processes to take your staff
 from good to great without costing an arm or a
 leg starting as early as
 today... From:
 Mr. Andreas Breitfuss CEO 
 Restaurant Management
 Center 
 Dear
 Friend, 

 How do to take
 your staff from just being OK or good to being
 GREAT?

The answer... training of course.

The problem these days is that there is so much
 rubbish out there regarding training your
 restaurant or cafe staff, and the information
 that is out there is sometimes just too
 expensive. Training your staff is an essential
 requirement to effectively increase
 productivity, decrease wasted staff hours and
 to assist in the increase of your restaurant
 sales. Training is one part of your
 restaurant you just can&apos;t afford not to
 develop... 
 

 Here&apos;s
 Why? 

 

 
 
 
 Training your
 staff can be time consuming
 however the rewards will
 outstrip the time investment as
 it will provide better, more
 motivated
 staff... 

   
 
 
 
 How do you
 get your restaurant or cafe
 performing better so you can ride
 out this economic storm and not
 sacrifice your savings to keep
 it afloat or borrow more money
 from the failing
 banks... 

   
   
   
 
 In
 troubled or bad economic
 times it is the restaurant
 industry that gets hit the
 hardest so training will
 be one of the most important
 steps to undertake to ensure
 your restaurant is in a strong
 position...   

   
   
   
 
 Fact:
 your profit is linked to
 your staff performance,
 get your staff performing
 better and see your
 bottom line profit
 increase. 

   
 
 
 
 You can
 have the best marketing
 and sales strategies in
 place BUT... if your
 staff don&apos;t perform then
 you are just letting
 money walk out the
 door. 

   
 
   
 
 Training
 does not need to be
 a &quot;chore&quot; if you have the
 best training guides and
 support materials, your staff will get
 it the first
 time. 

 
 
 
 
 Restaurant
 or cafe operators are
 more likely to keep
 existing staff by up to
 87% then those
 operators who don&apos;t
 have formal training
 programs in
 place. 

 
 
 
 
 It&apos;s a
 fact... your staff will
 become more motivated to
 work with you rather than
 working against you, it&apos;s
 like driving a car both of
 you  will
 be driving in the same
 direction. 

   
 
 
 
 Training
 will assist any owner or
 manager in setting up
 better procedures as all
 your staff will be
 trained the same
 way... 
 

 
Don&apos;t You Wish You Could Learn
 How 
 To Consistently
 Train Your Staff To The 
 Same Standards Of
 A 5 Star Venue 
 Without The High
 Cost? 
 
 Well now you can... 

 Hi there... my
 name is Andreas Breitfuss the CEO for the
 Restaurant Management Center. I am a 39 year
 old hospitality professional, I have owned and
 managed some of the country&apos;s most successful
 cafes, restaurants and hotels and I have been
 involved in the hospitality industry for over
 21 years. I currently own and operate the
 Restaurant Management Center and I provide help
 to other business owners in the hospitality
 industry to grow their
 businesses. 

 I
 have worked with clients that have had
 businesses from a small corner cafe up to
 a major hotel
 chain.   I
 t rained at one of
 the World’s finest Hotel Management
 Schools where I have acquired Swiss,
 Australian and United States of
 America Hotel and Restaurant
 Management
 qualifications . 
 
 
 
 I have won over
 11   regional,
 state and national hospitality
 awards    in the past
 15 years. These awards include winning
 one of the country&apos;s most sought after
 awards    &quot;The best
 marketed hotel&quot;  2 years running
 and business of the Year in my
 State. 
 
 
 
 I have been in control
 of over 21 food and beverage
 establishments over the last 15 years and
 have project managed over 12 major
 food and beverage re-developments and
 hotel openings. Over this time the
 revenues I have generated is well in
 excess of $75 million
 dollars.  

 I have
 managed to operate and grow some of the most
 profitable hospitality businesses in the
 country and have been the CEO for a major
 Hospitality Functions and Events business in
 2007 and 2008. I also spend time as one
 of the country&apos;s leading Hospitality marketing
 speakers, delivering presentations at National
 hospitality exhibitions and trade shows and I
 have recently released my book &quot;Marketing
 Manuevers&quot; for the hospitality industry in
 January 2008. Now... I don&apos;t want to blow my
 own trumpet but you only need to &apos;Google&apos; my
 name and you will see all the stuff I have
 done. 
 

 
 The Best,
 Concise, Value For Money Set Of Restaurant
 Training Manuals Ever
 Produced ? 

 The Restaurant Training Manuals is a
 full package of the latest training
 techniques to train your staff with. It
 includes all of the essential training
 techniques to empower your staff to be better
 with guests, sell more food and beverages and
 operate more efficiently. 

 I have
 been able to put together some of the
 best training manuals which will benefit
 any restaurant owner, manager or
 supervisor.
 
 The manuals take you through
 all the necessary areas to effectively train
 your staff without the hassle of designing the
 manuals your self.
 
 What a great
 number of restaurant and cafe owners don&apos;t
 recognise is that growing your business is not
 just about producing sales, although sales and
 marketing is one of the most important factors
 to grow your business. Without the best
 training for your staff it is like building a
 skyscraper with no
 foundations. 
 
 &quot;Restaurant
 Training Manuals&quot; 

 A Straight
 Forward, Yet Comprehensive Set Of Training
 Manuals That Builds Your Restaurant
 Staff From Good To
 GREAT! 
 
 
 
 
 Let&apos;s get more specific...
 Here&apos;s an overview of what you&apos;re going to get
 in the training manuals, this is what is
 included in the &quot;Restaurant Training Manuals&quot;
 package...


 

 
 
 
 Manual #1
 - Master Plan
 Document 
 Manual 1 is
 the master planning document,
 this document provides you the
 structure and timing to conduct
 all of your training. Once
 completed all you need to do is
 post it up for all your staff
 to see. 

   
 
 
 
 Manual #
 2 - Table
 Service 
 The ground
 work for any restaurant or cafe
 has to be your staff being able
 to carry and clear plates and
 to know the preparation and
 service cycle including silver
 service techniques. The clear
 images will show in details how
 you can achieve proper table
 service to your
 guests. 

   
 
 
 
 Manual  # 3 -
 Wine Service 1&amp;2 
 Wine service
 is one of the best way to
 increase sales... if your staff
 are trained correctly. This
 manual provides clear pictures
 of how to competently serve
 wine as well as provide your
 guests with greater knowledge
 of wine types, food and wine
 matching and wine growing
 regions of the
 world. 

 
 
 
 
 Manual # 4 -
 Guest
 Service 
 Keeping
 your guests happy is one
 of the most important
 issues you will face in
 your business. Having
 formal guest service
 training for your staff
 will allow them to manage
 complaints and set
 higher service
 standards. 

 
 
 
 
 Manual  #5
 - Supervisors and Managers 1&amp;2 
 Your supervisors and managers
 are your leaders, if they can&apos;t
 lead effectively  then
 your whole team will not
 perform to their peak
 performance. The supervisors
 manual looks at leadership
 training, development and
 delegation techniques for the
 leaders of your
 business. 

 
 
 
 
 Manual  #

 yet informative training manual
 will show all of the relevant
 areas for proper espresso
 training for coffee barista&apos;s
 and staff. 

 
 
 
 
 Manual # 7 - Bar
 Operations 
 Having a well run bar area will
 not only save you in running
 costs but will also aid in the
 increase of sales. This
 manual takes you over bar
 setup, storage procedures,
 opening and closing and
 background information on beer,
 wine and
 spirits. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Here is an example from
 the wine service manual 1,
providing clear step by step
 instructions...
 
 

Here is the part of the plate carrying
 manual:

 &quot;How Much Will It Set
 Me
 Back..?&quot; 

 Well, the real question
 you should be asking is how much is it
 worth to you to have a set of
 pre-made training manuals which would
 have taken you 100&apos;s of hours
 to
 produce?? 

 It&apos;s a
 simple answer.. &quot;Priceless&quot; 

 Not only so, but if you
 were to hire me for a personal one-on-one
 consultation, you&apos;d end up paying $350
 for one hour of my time over the
 phone. 

 Listen, I battled with
 this decision for weeks. Originally I
 &apos;toyed&apos; with the idea that $197 would be
 a fair price to ask. After all I am
 giving away the exact training
 manuals that allowed my clients to
 build their businesses from good to
 great. 

 So
 here&apos;s what I
 decided... 

 I would virtually give
 away a very limited number of copies...
 and after that revert the price back to
 what I originally decided. In other words
 $197. 

 So to make sure that
 you get your hands on this information,
 no matter what your situation, I am
 practically committing &quot;consulting
 suicide&quot; by handing you the whole package
 for just a one time payment of
 $97.00. 

 Look, don&apos;t be deceived
 by the price... 

 ...With the hours of
 time you will save in developing these
 training manuals I think you will agree
 it&apos;s a value for money
 deal. 
 
 Now Here Is The Bad
 News... 
 
 This is a very limited
 opportunity; one that CANNOT exist for long to
 preserve the value for our
 members... 

 See, even though we are
 releasing this for an amount of $97.00, we are
 only giving away an undisclosed number
 of training packages at this
 price. 

 If you return to the page in
 a couple of hours... or maybe even minutes, the
 chances are the limit will have been reached
 and the price will be have been
 raised. 

 In other words, if you want
 in, you&apos;ll need to make your move
 now.

 Just to
 confirm... 

 If you&apos;re reading this now,
