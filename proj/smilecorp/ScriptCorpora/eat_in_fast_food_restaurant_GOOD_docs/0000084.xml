 My Blog 
 
 A couple months back I did an article for Orient-Express magazine that gave me the chance to visit and photograph some of the high-end Thai restaurants in Bangkok. The food at these places was amazing, and the chefs really enthusiastic and friendly, although many of them admitted that the food at their restaurants is really not much better than the hole-in-the-wall places one can find all over Bangkok; such is the nature of Thai food. In any event, here are some of the pics I took for the piece.

On the left here is ho mok a steamed &quot;cake&quot; of fresh herbs pounded up with fish and thick coconut milk. This at the ultra-cool Lan Na Thai, and the chef told me that the recipe is roughly based around a northern Thai recipe. I really like ho mok and buy a grilled version every week at my neighborhood&apos;s talaat nat , weekend market.



 On the right here is a green curry from Bussaracum, a well-known &quot;royal&quot; Thai cuisine restaurant. The chef told me that they make their own khreuang kaeng , curry paste,
as well as making their own coconut milk from scratch!





 To the left is the Fried Rice with Crab Roe and Chili Paste at the Hyatt Erawan&apos;s recently remodeled Tea Room. The Tea Room&apos;s Chef de Cuisine, Siriluck Lekkwan, is the nicest lady in the world and we spent a pleasant hour chatting about Thai food.













 This is the famous Malay dish sate at the Blue Elephant. There are three kinds of meat here, including buffalo, if I remember correctly. After taking pics I had lunch here and the food is amazing--definately not Tourist Thai. During lunch I was introduced to the owner of the entire chain of restaurants, and her daughter who teaches at the cooking school in the same building.










 This is the clever Som Tam Pork Chop at the beautiful MahaNaga restaurant. Som Tam is, of course, the pounded papaya salad, very much a Thai dish, and is served here with a Western style pork chop, a pairing that I thought worked well and tasted great.












 Tom Yam at the Sukhothai Hotel&apos;s acclaimed Celadon. Didn&apos;t actually get to taste this one, but could see that the chef was wise enough to include whole shrimp so that the delicious fat inside the heads would flavor the broth. Mmmm...head fat.












 Yam Som Oh , pomelo salad, at Ban Khanita. Sour, sweet and spicy. Good shit.

click on the image This post is a direct response to this thread at the Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorn Tree forum. In it I make the argument that the world&apos;s greatest sandwich is not available in some New York deli, Po Boy shack in Louisiana, or some panini joint in Rome, but rather in the metropolis of Vientiane, Laos. At this Vietnamese restaurant just north of nam phu , the fountain, one can purchase the wonder seen above. Known as khao jii , the sandwich takes a crispy, freshly grilled French-style baguette, and stuffs it fill of homemade liver pate, barbequed pork, muu yor (a Vietnamese-style pork sausage), cucumber, cilantro, pickled radish and carrots, and for the willing, chili paste. Consumed with a frostly Beer Lao (the best beer in SE Asia) there is no more profound level of sandwichness. I just wish there was a way to prove this scientifically...

click on the image Geez... My first post, where do I start? Reckon I should introduce myself: Hi, I&apos;m Austin. I&apos;m a 28 year-old American freelance photographer based in Bangkok (whew!). I&apos;ve lived in and worked in Bangkok for nearly eight years now and I can speak, read and write Thai fluently. I&apos;m really interested in the food in this part of the world, and just between you and me, it&apos;s probably the only thing that&apos;s kept me in this lovely, quaint, clean, charming village known as Bangkok all these years (I&apos;m assuming you&apos;re familiar with sarcasm?). So, anyway, the food: This site will be a place for me to discuss the food of Thailand, and SE Asia, employing a variety of techniques ranging from vivid adjective-strewn prose, to cutting-edge visual aids (also known as &quot;photographs&quot;). A particular emphasis is on &quot;real&quot; Thai food, which, despite the inherent ambiguity of the term, I think you all know what I mean. I plan to visit restaurants and foodstalls in town, diligently risking life and limb to reveal to you all the truth about Thai food. I will occasionally include info about the various elements/ingredients of Thai food, and will try to include recipes as well. Much of the inspiration for this site is due to noodlepie , Graham Holliday&apos;s hilarious and informative view on eats in Saigon.

Okay, the Food: I was in Baang Saeng, an hour east of Bangkok, on Sunday. This place is your typical Thai beach resort: banana boats, screaming kids, pushy vendors, alarmingly underdressed Germans, and most of all, seafood. Actually, forget all the other stuff about Germans, Bang Saen is all about the food. Only in Thailand would people leave the safety and comfort of their air-conditioned homes to drive an hour to sit under an umbrella and eat crabs from Styrofoam dishes. Baang Saen is approximately four kilometers of beachline that has been converted into what is probably the world&apos;s largest seafood restaurant. You sit at a sling chair under an umbrella, and vendors selling food come right to you. You don&apos;t even have to get up! The majority is steamed seafood, such as crabs
 
cockles, mmm...cockles...
 
and grilled prawns.
 
This is my friend A after he found out he had to pay for lunch. Poor guy.
 
This last one is my personal favorite, yam khai maengdaa thale , horseshoe crab egg yam .
 
And no, in case you&apos;re wondering, horseshoe crab is not a cute crustaceon but rather this loveable creature . Isn&apos;t it just the most adorable thing? Don&apos;t you just want to hug it? I tried to take one home as a pet but the vendor said something about the grilling process killing it. Anyway, I&apos;m glad that Thais took the initiative to eat this, as I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any other society on earth that has the balls to do it.

For those of you not familiar with yam , it is basically a kind of sour/spicy Thai &quot;salad&quot;. A yam is usually based around some sort of protein, such as squid, beef, or the eggs above, a bunch of chilies, and a dressing, typically a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice and sugar. The yam above has unripe mango, which is somewhat unusual and adds a sour taste. More commonly, yam are made with kheun chai , also known as Chinese parsley, for which celery tops are a good substitute. Many of the recipes for yam I&apos;ve seen in English include garlic, which is not the norm in Thailand. I&apos;ll bring in a more complete yam recipe next time I make it for dinner.

click on the image Last month I happened to be in southern Thailand taking photos for a guidebook. I&apos;m also in the early stages of collecting info and photos for a book on southern Thai food, so I made a point of taking lots of food pics. Thought I&apos;d share some of those here as the food in southern Thailand is quite interesting and quite different than that of other parts of the country.

These wacky green pods below are known in Thai as sator . I&apos;ve heard them called &quot;stinky bean&quot; in English. They are an essential element of southern Thai cooking and are probably the most recognizeable ingredient associated with this part of the country. Open them up and you&apos;ll get a bunch of lima bean-like pods. They can be eaten raw with nam phrik (chili paste), or fried, and have a very pungent odor. One fun side affect of eating sator is that the next day your urine will smell very strongly of sator. For more on the captivating but neglected topic of urine and food please visit noodlepie .
 

















Another important ingredient in southern Thai food is khamin, turmeric, seen here below. It is this stuff that makes so many of the curries in southern Thailand yellow and orange. It is also used with seafood dishes to counter the undesireable &quot;fishy&quot; smell they sometimes have. And it&apos;s also used in soaps and lotions and is thought to lighten the skin.
 

















Below is khanom jeen, fermented rice noodles, with naam yaa pak tai, a southern-style coconut curry with pureed fish. Sounds nasty but is excellent, and really freaking spicy. When you order this dish you also get a tray of fresh &quot;cooling&quot; vegetables to counter the spiciness, including cucumber, bai bua bok (pennywort) and young cashew tree leaves. 


















The pics below are all of raan khaao kaeng , southern-style curry shops. You order a curry or two, served over rice, and are also given a small bowl of a very spicy chili paste called nam phrik and a tray of fresh veggies. 















The two curry shops below are in Satun, a province in the deep south of Thailand. The people here are predominately Muslim, and their food is halaal , meaning it follows Muslim dietary rules and doesn&apos;t have pork or alcohol or blood
 

















 











Fried chicken is also a big deal in the south and is usually made by Muslims as well. The women making this were using their bare hands to dip the chicken into the boiling oil, although I think they were doing it just to show off. Fried chicken vendors can be like that sometimes. 


















Because of the long coastline, seafood is an important staple of the people of southern Thailand, regardless of religion. The pic directly below was taken at the tiny market in Satun, and the grilled squid pic was taken in Nakhorn Sri Thammarat, a great city for food.
 

















 

















And for dessert, sweet sticky rice with sangkhayaa, a type of egg custard. This stuff is available all over Thailand, but is an essential dish at the numerous Chinese-style raan kopii, or coffee shops in southern Thailand.

click on the image The bulk of RealThai will, of course, concern food, but taking advantage of the vague nature of the title of the blog, as well as the fact that I&apos;m a photographer, I&apos;d also like to showcase some of my photographs.

A few months ago I was inspired by the amazing photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson to get off my fat ass and take more photos in my free time. Rather than my usual shooting trips, which involve lugging a large bag and four heavy lenses, I decided to emulate this master of modern photojournalism and use the equivalent of just one 50mm &quot;normal&quot; lens. Monsieur Cartier-Bresson popularized this style of &quot;street photography&quot;, using a normal lens, being &quot;...quick, quick, quick, quick,... Like an animal and a prey...&quot; and choosing not to crop his photographs. And, as many of you might also be aware, he was always on the lookout to capture the &quot;decisive moment&quot;, and I figured all of these factors put together would help me improve my skills as a photographer. As you&apos;ll see below, I&apos;m certainly no Cartier-Bresson, but I hope that in the course of doing this my skills will improve.

My first walk was in the Silom area of Bangkok. The couple below are at a McDonald&apos;s off of Silom. Warning: This can really happen to your head if you eat McDonald&apos;s too much.

click on the image For today&apos;s lunch I went to a restaurant near my home in Bangkok that specializes in southern Thai-style khanom jeen . Khanom jeen are fresh noodles made from fermented rice, and are usually served with some sort of a curry/sauce and a fat tray of fresh veggies as illustrated below: 


















 Khanom jeen are available all over the country, but are probably most associated with southern Thai cooking. Today I had khanom jeen with kaeng tai plaa , &quot;fish kidney curry&quot;. It&apos;s a southern dish that is made from highly salted, preserved fish kidneys, an ingredient I&apos;m sure that, after having made its debut here at RealThai, will be very much in demand this coming year. As far as I can tell, the fish kidneys only impart an extremely salty taste; unfortunately there seems to be little of that desireable fish gut flavor that everybody&apos;s been raving about lately. The curry is probably one of the spiciest in Thailand, and is topped up with grilled fish torn into pieces. In southern Thailand the curry usually consists simply of the sauce and fish, while in Bangkok, pickled bamboo, green beans, &quot;wing beans&quot;, Thai eggplants and pumpkin are often added. My favorite variant includes jackfruit seeds or cashews. Here is the artfully garnished dish before I crammed it into my greedy gob:

click on the image In my first post I mentioned yam a kind of spicy/sour Thai salad, so I wanted to follow up and give a recipe and description here. Yam are very common in Thailand, and probably the easiest of all Thai dishes to make. A yam , along with some sort of fried dish, and a soup or curry, is one part of a &quot;complete&quot; Thai meal. Y am are also wonderful on their own as kap klaem , drinking accompaniments. As mentioned before, all you really need to make yam is some sort of protein, this can range from seafood ( yam thale is a mix of parboiled shrimp, squid or any other other seafood handy), to grilled meat, or for vegetarians, tofu. You then add some veggies, typically kheun chai , or Chinese parsley, for which celery tops are an excellent substitute, thinly sliced shallots or onions, slices of tomato and smashed up chilies. The final and most important ingredient is the dressing. Yam dressing is a simple yet powerful combination of lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar.

For today&apos;s yam my protein will be tao hoo plaa , &quot;fish tofu&quot;, a disturbing-sounding but tasty mixture of fish and tofu in user-friendly cubes. As you&apos;ll see below, I&apos;m not real specific about the amounts of the ingredients for the dressing because Thais are not specific about them either. It&apos;s all done to taste. You&apos;ll want a favorable mixture of spicy (from the chilies), sour (from the lime), sweet (sugar) and salty (from the fish sauce). When I say favorable that means you make it the way you like it. Personally, I don&apos;t like sweet, so I use very little or no sugar, and tend to boost the sour and spicy. In Thailand, this dish is made using the small, very spicy chilies called phrik khii nuu (&quot;mouse shit chilies). Here&apos;s a photo of all the ingredients in the early stages of the operation:
 
Ingredients:
protein
1 bunch kheun chai (Chinese parsely, or celery tops)
1 or 2 tomatoes
4 shallots (or half a small onion)
chilies to taste
fish sauce
2 limes
sugar

Prepare your protein as necessary. This can mean par-boiling your seafood for about a minute, or grilling a steak and slicing it up. As I&apos;m using tao hoo plaa it&apos;s necessary to fry it and halve it first. Set aside. Roughly chop up your kheun chai . Removing the seeds first, slice your tomatoes. Thinly slice the shallots. Put all of this in a large plastic or glass bowl that you will later use to mix and taste the yam before serving it.
 
Roughly chop your chilis, and then using the side of a wide knife, smash and grind them, and chop a bit more, or, as seen below, use a mortar and pestle:
 
Now it&apos;s dressing time. Halve the limes and squeeze the juice of one about one lime into a bowl. Follow this up with a splash of fish sauce, and a pinch of sugar. Mix well, and taste:
 
Is it not sour enough? Add more lime. Is it too salty? You screwed up and there&apos;s no hope for you now nor never you pathetic loser. Or, you could just add more sugar to cover up the saltiness. And so on. When the taste is right, mix the dressing with the ingredients,
 
and dump the whole mess onto a serving dish and you&apos;re done.
 
I&apos;m so proud of you.

click on the image Not exactly on the topic of Thai food, but I had a lovely lunch today with Sophie, keeper of this blog, author of many, many cookbooks , and a lady with enough connections to get us a free multi-course meal at D&apos;Sens ! (Actually, I&apos;m exaggerating Sophie&apos;s powers here. I had already made an apointment with the hotel&apos;s PR rep. for an article I&apos;m writing. But Sophie does know the chef at D&apos;Sens and at the last minute was able to wrangle herself a free meal as well, which, you have to admit, is pretty cool too.) In addition to all this, Sophie had a camera (I...uh, didn&apos;t...) and took some photos of our lunch including this below, which, if I remember correctly, was something to do with sea urchin:
 












Sophie was also kind enough to take me to a previously unknown French butcher shop off of Soi Convent, where I bought some extremely tasty pate for tonight&apos;s dinner. Good job Sophie! We like Sophie here at RealThai. Someday we might even consider making her one of Us.

This is my friend, Kaeng Hang Lay. He is a northern Thai style curry that probably came to Thailand via Burma ( hin means curry in Burmese). The curry uses a cut of pork that Thais call moo saam chan , &quot;three-level pork&quot;, as it has meat, fat and skin. The pork is fried in really simple Burmese-style curry paste (chilies, ginger, shallots, garlic and thua nao khep , soybeans that have been dried and flattened into disks), which being Burmese, also includes dried spices (a &quot;hang lay&quot; mixture of dried spices is available in northern Thailand). The curry is commonly eaten as a communal dish at festivals in northern Thailand, especially among the Shan ethnic group. The flavour of the curry is savory and sour (from the addition of tamarind), and is actually quite similar to an extremely rich American barbeque sauce. I&apos;ll be eating kaeng hang leh really soon as I&apos;m heading up to Mae Hong Son province in northern Thailand on Monday! So I won&apos;t be blogging next week, but I will, of course, come back with lots of pics and info on northern Thai food to share with everybody.

click on the image Today for lunch I had a fat bowl of the unpronounceable Thai-Chinese noodles mentioned above. I used to be anti-noodles, but lately I&apos;ve been trying some of the noodles I&apos;ve avoided in the past and am actually liking them. (I&apos;m still convinced, however, that Thailand&apos;s noodle dishes are the weakest in Asia! I&apos;d much rather have a good Burmese mohinga , a Lao pho , or virtually any noodle dish in China--especially those of Yunnanese or Szechuan origin.) Kwaytiao Khae is a simple noodle dish, but is somewhat hard to find here. It&apos;s basically a bland, clear broth served with rice noodles and a variety of southern Chinese-style pork, shrimp and fish balls:
 

















The shop is really close to my house, and the owners are nice people who look more Chinese than Thai! The soft noodles are dipped in the boiling broth before being added to the soup:
 

















There are a great variety of noodle dishes in Thailand, but the majority are eaten with the same repertoire of condiments: dried chilies, fresh chilies in vinegar, sugar, fish sauce and ground white pepper:
 

















Norng Paeng is eating the extremely-popular-in-Bangkok dish, yen taa fo . It&apos;s pretty much the same as kwaytiao khae except that the broth is red from the addition of a kind of soy bean product, and it is served with parboiled morning glory, an acquatic vegetable popular in central Thailand:

click on the image Fish sauce, that essential SE Asian condiment, has been getting some bad press at eGullet lately. In an effort to put an end to this vicious rumor-mongering and reveal the truth behind fish sauce that the Man doesn&apos;t want you to know, I thought I would describe what goes into making the stuff. I wrote a piece about fish sauce for a magazine here in Bangkok a while back and was able to visit a fish sauce factory in Chonburi and see first hand how it is made. The pics and info are taken from that piece, which will be printed in the Bangkok Post supplement themagazine early next year. And no, even after doing this, I can&apos;t deny that fish sauce stinks, but it is a pure product with an interesting history.

Fish sauce begins with freshly-caught anchovy-like fish from the Gulf of Thailand:
 

















Virtually as soon as they are brought to land, the fish are then sucked up into a giant machine that grinds them up with equal parts salt. This muck is then transferred to deep cement vats:
 

















where they are left for about a year. During this time, the salt draws moisture from the fish, which rises to the top and is essentially fish sauce in its raw form:
 

















After a year the liquid is transferred to large holding tanks:
 

















Depending on the brand, a small amount of sugar might also be added at this point (Thai people prefer a slightly sweet, caramel-colored fish sauce), then the fish sauce is filtered three times and bottled:
 











Interestingly, at no point is the fish sauce pasteurized or subjected to preservatives; the stuff is so salty that bacteria or other nasties can&apos;t survive in it. This product is now known as nam plaa thae , Grade A fish sauce:
 

















Lesser quality, nam plaa prasom , or &quot;mixed&quot; fish sauces are made by adding water to the solids left in the vats aftet the production of Grade A fish sauce. This fish sauce contains less protein, and is sometimes full of artificial colorings, MSG, and preservatives to make up for the lack of natural flavor. Oddly enough, it is this stuff that one finds most often in Asian food stores in the US, at least in my experience. This might be the reason that people in the US find fish sauce so revolting?

So now that you know what goes into it, what do you do with it? Well if you&apos;re not already aware, fish sauce is used in pretty much the same way that salt is used in the West. One of the most delicious and simple dishes to make with fish sauce is nam plaa phrik , the Thai equivalent of a salt shaker. Take three or four tablespoons of Grade A fish sauce and add two or three (or more if you like) very thinly-sliced Thai chilies, a clove of thinly-sliced garlic, and a squeeze of lime. Put all this in a small shallow dish and sprinkle over bland tasting food.

click on the image The photo below is a response to this thread at eGullet concerning Thai bread. Bread is not, of course, a staple food for Thai people, but it is very popular nonetheless. Normally the Thais are brilliant at taking foods from other cultures and integrating them into their own cuisine in delicious ways, but with bread, something went wrong. Very wrong. This wrong (WARNING. The following contains graphic images of disgusting bread!):
 











The bread above was labelled as Deluxe Floss (heh heh) and was purchased at the brand new Siam Paragon branch of Bread Talk (heh heh). Floss refers to the topping of sweet, golden fluffy strands of pork (heh heh), and is a very popular topping for Thai baked goods. I&apos;m not sure where they got this idea. One imagines they should probably abandon it. The bread, as with the majority of its genre , is so soft it makes Wonder Bread look like a pain poilane and it is painfully sweet with a disturbing oily sheen.

I think Deluxe Floss is a good place to our journey through the Magical World of Thai Baked Goods, and in future installments I will touch on the use of cheap hot dogs, sweetened condensed milk, and mayonaise.

I will, however, come back with heaps of pics on northern Thai food, including the famous noodle dish khao soi and hopefully a scoop on the delicious and virtually unknown food of the Shan ethic group.

click on the image I spent last week in Mae Hong Son province, by far my favorite place in Thailand. Mae Hong Son borders Myanmar (Burma) in the far northwest of the country, and is extremely mountainous and remote. The province is home many Shan or Thai Yai, a group of people who are today mostly found in Myanmar, but who are actually of the same ethno-linguistic group as the Thai. The Thai Yai have had a large influence on the cuisine of Mae Hong Son, which is a combination of Shan and northern Thai cooking. Mae Hong Son is certainly not a culinary destination, but the food is unlike anywhere else in Thailand, and Mae Hong Son is probably my favorite province to eat in. The staple food of most northern Thais is khao niaow , sticky rice, which in Mae Hong Son is dished up &quot;to go&quot; in bai tong tueng , the leaf of a type of teak tree:
 





















One of the most famous northern Thai dishes is a curry-and-noodle dish called khao soi . The true origin of the dish is unknown, but it is thought to be a Shan dish brought to northern Thailand from Myanmar by Muslim traders, and is today available in virtually every town in Mae Hong Son:
 














Shan food is similar to Burmese in that it relies on thick, oily curries and some dried spices, in particular turmeric. An important Shan staple is tomatoes, especially the tiny, sour ones known as makhuea som :
 














These tomatoes are used in a northern style chili paste of Shan origin known as nam phrik ong. The chili paste is served with veggies and deep-fried pork crackling, and resembles a thick spaghetti sauce : 
 





















Another staple of Mae Hong Son is thua nao , disks of dried and compressed soybeans, used much the same way as shrimp paste is in the rest of Thailand :
 





















Northern Thai food relies on a great deal of vegetables, probably more than with other Thai regional cuisines. A very common vegetable is phak kaat jor , often used in stews:
 





















The northern Thai love for veggies extends to some unusual ingredients, such as the flowers below, called dok khaan , and seen in the evening market in Pai:
 





















and which were evident in the yam below:
 





















Veggies are so important to northern Thai cooking that at fresh markets they are sold pre-cut and portioned for use in curries, such as the ingredients for kaeng om :
 





















and the ingredients for kaeng khanun , a curry of young jackfruit:
 





















Simply buy or make the appropriate curry paste, some meat, and add these and the veggies to boiling water, and you have a curry!
Northern people also like grilled foods, such as aep , curry paste and meat, wrapped in banana leaves and grilled:
 





















And finally, a pic of the evening market in front of the Burmese-style temple of the city of Mae Hong Son:
 

This is just an appetizer. In the coming days I&apos;ll share the deliciousness by making a few Mae Hong Son/northern Thai dishes.

click on the image Today&apos;s lunch was taken at the venerable Or Tor Kor Market, Bangkok&apos;s finest. In a bout of indecision I decided to order phat thai. Despite the mad popularity of this stuff in the US, it doesn&apos;t really seem to be all that popular in Bangkok, and I rarely eat it.

I do like it though, but have only made it myself once or twice. Phat thai is not a difficult dish to make, but it does require a certain amount of skill (otherwise the noodles tend to ball up into a sticky mess!), and is easiest done in a large flat skillet, as shown below, although some people do prefer to use a deep wok. The phat thai below is called phat thai hor khai , &quot;phat thai wrapped in an egg&quot;, and is my favorite type. To illustrate how it&apos;s done I tried to capture each &quot;step&quot; below.

The first step involves frying bits of firm tofu, chopped shallots, dried shrimp and dried preserved radish:
 
Next involves taking the rice noodles, which have been pre-softened in a sauce that usually consists of fish sauce, tamarind and sugar, and frying them with the other ingredients:
 
After this some bean sprouts and a kind of crisp green onion are added:
 
The mixture is then pushed to the side of the pan and a couple beaten eggs are added:
 
The egg is spread thin and when it has solidified a bit the noodle mixture is heaped on top:
 
The egg is then wrapped around the noodle mixture to form a &quot;package&quot; of sorts:
 
And we&apos;re done:
 
Phat thai is always served with additional sprouts, green onions, as well as a slice of lime and banana flower. The phat thai above was a special deal fried with oysters and mussels. Not bad, but in this case, very, very oily!

click on the image Yeah, that&apos;s right: khao soi. Those of you not prepared to go one-on-one with the deliciousliest Thai dish of all should probably leave. OK. Now we&apos;re alone, and I can let you in on a secret: khao soi is not even Thai. This famous northern speciality is probably an amalgam of Burmese/Shan and Chinese-Muslim cooking styles. The word khao soi, which doesn&apos;t really mean anything in Thai, probably comes from the Burmese khauk-hswe , which means simply &quot;noodles&quot;. Unlike most Thai noodle dishes, the broth is made with coconut milk, very similar to a dish still eaten today in Shan State Burma called ohn no khauk-hswe . It seems likely that Chinese-Muslim traders brought ohn no khauk-hswe to Thailand, and added the spices they were so fond of.

OK, enough freaking history. Now it&apos;s time to face the khao soi:
 
Don&apos;t try to deny its power, look at it, stare at it, let it take you in:
 
Khao soi uses flat egg noodles, some of which are deep-fried and used as a topping. To cut through the general oiliness of the dish, khao soi is accompanied by a dish of acidic condiments such as sliced shallots, slices of lime, and pickled cabbage, as seen below:
 
This is Noel in a bout of khao soi-induced madness trying to intimidate the noodles:
 
Unfortunately this photo doesn&apos;t show the fear in his eyes.

The bowl above was consumed at Khao Soi Lam Duan in Chiang Mai, probably the best and most famous khao soi place in Thailand. The owner claims that her mother actually invented the dish, but this seems very unlikely. Unlike most Thai dishes, khao soi is usually only served with chicken or beef, which also seems to verify its Muslim origins.

click on the image Today we&apos;re going to continue our education in bizarre Siamese baked treats by touching on another cornerstone of the oeuvre: hot dogs. Somehow Thai &quot;bakers&quot; have found a way to make these missiles of reject meat even less attractive than they already are. Take this example, titled Jumbo Sausage Roll (heheh) and purchased at the local Tesco/Lotus:
 
Like most of this genre, the hot dog is displayed prominently on top of the bread. I think this is a bragging point, with the roll suggesting &quot;Hey there! Look at me, I&apos;m no regular, run-of-the-mill roll! I have a hot dog!&quot; As far as I can approximate, attempts were made to make the Jumbo Sausage Roll resemble a pizza; the red streaks are some sort of ketchup-related product, the mucuous-like liquid generously slathered over the hot dog is supposed to approximate cheese, and the whole thing is sprinkled with dried oregano.

I gave the whole thing to our neighborhood dog, who just sort of stared at it. After a few minutes, when I went back outside to get my camera, he still hadn&apos;t touched it. I think that says something.

click on the image My thread on Thai noodles at eGullet has generated a considerable amount of interest in, uh…Thai noodles, especially khao soi. Worked up by all of this, culinary bad-ass, Onigiri has been doing a lot of behind the scenes trash talking saying that there’s no way a white guy can make good khao soi, even if he does live in Thailand. I say there’s no way anybody in Iowa, even if she is Thai, can make a good one. So before this verbal war escalates any further we’ve decided to have a Battle of the Khao Soi. I’m going to buy the ingredients Saturday, make the khao soi on Sunday, and post the results here afterwards. She’s going to do the same and post her results as well. Obviously as there’s no way to judge this, it&apos;s only fair that I declare myself winner in advance. As consolation I plan to send Onigiri a Jumbo Sausage Roll.

click on the image Kuay jap yuan is acually a Vietnamese dish that was introduced to NE Thailand via Laos. Kuay jap is Chinese for a kind of thick noodle dish, and yuan is a semi-derogatory word for people or things of Vietnamese origin. Not sure what it&apos;s called in Vietnamese, perhaps Graham at noodlepie can tell us? In any event, it&apos;s a very simple dish to make, and equally delicious.

Two ingredients are essential for this dish: moo yor , a kind of Vietnamese sausage described below, and the fat round sticky-rice noodles particular to this dish. They&apos;re sold dried in Thai supermarkets and labelled as &quot;Vietnamese Noodles&quot;. The noodles are coated with a layer of flour and are made by being boiled directly in the broth (rather than in separate boiling water, as in most noodle dishes). The flour mixes with the broth and results in a somewhat thick broth. Do NOT use the flat rice noodles, they will not provide this texture.

Again, as with most of my recipes, I&apos;m not big on measurements.

The night before I had made chicken stock and reserved some of boiled chicken meat. I pulled about two litres of the stock out and brought it to a boil, and in the meantime made hom jiaow , crispy fried shallots. This is done by frying about half a cup of thinly-slice shallots in lots of oil over medium-high heat until brown and crispy:
 
When finished set the hom jiaow on paper towels to absorb oil. Set aside.

Next prepare the remainder of the soup ingredients. Thinly slice half an onion, chop up some green onions, and add them to the boiling broth along with some fish sauce to taste:
 
Possibly the most important ingredient of kuay jap yuan is a Vietnamese pork sausage called moo yor ( moo is Thai for pork, and yor is the Thai pronunciation of the Vietnamese gio ). Moo yor is steamed in banana leaves. Unwrap the moo yor:
 
slice it, and add it, along with the chicken, to the boiling broth:
 
Let this boil for a few minutes, and in the meantime wash and prepare a platter of fresh herbs: green onion, cilantro, mint, as well as slices of lime and chilis:
 
These will be served along with the finished noodles.

When the meat is heated through, add the dried noodles:
 
When the soup reaches a boil again, reduce the heat and let simmer until the noodles are done, about 5-7 minutes. Taste the noodles to see if they&apos;re done, and taste the flavor of the broth again:
 
Serve in bowls sprinkled with the hom jiaow, add the fresh herbs of your choice, mix:
 
And eat:

click on the image Battle of the Khao Soi has spilled over into eGullet, which somehow raised concern that the whole thing is being done simply to promote my and Onigiri&apos;s respective blogs. This is false for two reasons: 1. You mean, people actually read this stuff? 2. My only goal since birth has been to crush Onigiri and prove once and for all that I possess supreme confidence in my khao soi skills and that she is nothing but a pathetic Thai wannabe wallowing in unrealistic expectations of her culinary ability in a foreign wasteland.

Khao soi is not necessarily difficult to make, but it is time consuming, as it incorporates making a curry (which involves make a curry paste), preparing a great deal of condiments, as well as noodles. Set aside an entire morning for making it (khao soi, for some reason, is never eaten at dinner in Thailand). The recipe below will make enough khao soi for two hungry people.

The khreuang kaeng, or curry paste, is the most important part of a curry. Below are the raw ingredients that will make up my khao soi curry paste:
 
And a list:
Cha ko (a kind of spice), shelled 1
Coriander (cilantro) seeds 2 Tbsp
Big dried chilies 4-6
Chopped ginger 1 heaping Tbsp
Chopped turmeric 1 heaping Tbsp
Shallots 9
Salt 1 Tbsp
Curry powder 2 tsp

Take each of the curry paste ingredients except for the salt and curry powder, and dry-roast individually until fragrant and browned:
 
Using a mortar and pestle, combine all of the curry paste ingredients until they result in a fine, thick paste:
 
This is a long, boring process that will inevitably send pieces of smashed chili flying directly into your eyes. The result is your curry paste. Set it aside.

Now prepare the condiments. First, the chilies in oil: take about 30 or so small dried chilies and dry-roast in the same wok until dark and fragrant but not black and burnt. Grind these up quite finely using a clean dry mortar and pestle. Using the same wok, add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, heat until just about to smoke, then add the ground chilies and stir until fragrant, but not burnt, about one to two minutes:
 
Remove to a clean dry heatproof bowl and set aside to cool.

Wash, dry, and coarsely chop cilantro and green onions. Peel and chop about 10 shallots. Drain and coarsely chop the pickled mustard greens. Slice a few limes. Arrange all of these on a dish. These are your condiments:
 
Now it’s time for the soup. Take about a 3/4 of a cup of thick coconut milk and heat it in a saucepan over medium heat until it starts to bubble and simmer. Add the curry paste ingredients:
 
Continue stirring until the liquid is reduced considerably, and a film of oil has begun to form:
 
This may take as long as 10 to 15 minutes. Be patient! This is a very important step and ensures that the oils of the various ingredients will be released, making a more fragrant curry.

When a fair amount of oil has pooled, add your meat, in this case four to six small chicken thighs, and fry in the oily paste for about five minutes:
 
Take another half cup of thick coconut milk and dilute with about three cups of water. Add this to the saucepan:
 
Bring to a light boil, turn the heat down as low as possible, and simmer. After about 10 minutes or so, taste the soup and add salt or see ew khao, a kind of soy sauce, or sugar, if necessary.

While the broth is simmering, it’s time to do the noodles. Khao soi noodles, a flat squiggly egg noodle, are notoriously hard to find, even in Thailand. A good substitute is the fresh egg noodles called ba mee. Bring a large pot full of water to a boil, separate the fresh noodles, plunge into the boiling water and boil for about five minutes:
 
Drain well and set aside in colander (the noodles can be made in advance and quickly re-boiled at eating time, if necessary).

Put a generous serving of the noodles in a bowl, top with one chicken thigh and lotsa broth, and you’re done! How diners choose to flavor their khao soi with condiments is up to them. Personally, I like lots of lime and lots of chili:
 
So whaddaya got, Onigiri?

click on the image Battle of the Khao Soi was a certified success, grossing me hundreds of thousands of dollars in endorsements, critical acclaim in a number of multi-national glossy magazines, and generating literally millions of hits to RealThai. There is talk of a made-for-TV movie, and this morning I was identified in the street four times. However most important is the fact that I continue to maintain my place as the King of Khao Soi. Onigiri and I have reached a truce of sorts and hope to conduct another competition in the near future.

I&apos;ll be heading down to southern Thailand, then on to Laos, and will probably not be blogging too much this month as a result. When I do get back however I&apos;ll post some juicy pics of southern Thai food.

click on the image Just got back from Krabi, Phang-nga, and Phuket, three southern provinces. Am not a real big fan of beaches, and as a result never tended to visit the south very much dispite having lived here so many years. I&apos;ve been going there a lot lately though, first for a guidebook I&apos;m contributing photos and text to, and most recently to take photos for a cookbook I&apos;ve agreed to do that will be called Flavours of the Street: Southern Thailand . Honestly, I&apos;m still not too big on the beaches, but I&apos;m beginning to love ahaan pak tai , southern Thai food, more and more.

I would start out my days in the south with a light breakfast. One of my favorite aspects of southern culture are the ubiquitous coffee and tea shops. Along with the caffeine are a variety of traditional Thai sweets, as seen below:
 

Another popular breakfast food is khao yam , a &quot;salad&quot; of rice mixed with finely-sliced fresh herbs and veggies:
 

After breakfast I would typically wander around to take photos at the local markets for my book. The pic below is from Krabi&apos;s huge new market:
 
Normally indoor markets are dark and smelly and nearly impossible to take photos in, but this is obviously an exception and I hope more markets are being built this way!

Generally I prefer markets that are more outdoors and on the streets, such as in Phuket&apos;s morning market:
 

Living so close to the coast, fish is not surprisingly a staple food of southern Thais. There is a huge variety, ranging from fish, to shellfish, to crabs to squid, as seen at Phuket&apos;s morning market:
 
Fish are prepared a number of ways, including my personal favorite, grilled whole, as seen in Phan Nga&apos;s evening market:
 

After a few hours of taking photos, it was time for lunch. Phuket, having previously been a SE Asian melting pot of sorts, has a variety of cuisines, such as Hokkien fried noodles:
 

As well as the Malay speciality, sate:
 
served, as always, with the famous Malaysian peanut-based dipping sauce (which many people in the US and Europe mistakenly identify as Thai), and cukes and shallots in vinegar.

I, however, almost always went for the curries. The people in the south seem to love any soupy dish poured over rice, unlike people in Bangkok, who would probably rather eat noodles or a fried dish, and they do curries very, very well. Curry, kaeng , in Thai, is a general term, and can describe anything from a thick coconut milk curry to a thin, watery broth. Here is a typical raan khao kaeng , rice and curry shop, at Krabi&apos;s night market:
 

Take a closer look:
 
The yellow color of many of the dishes come from the use of turmeric. Some of the curries are already prepacked in to-go bags. Some of the more remarkable curries I had on my trip were a kaeng khua , a thick coconut-milk curry with pineapple and cockles in Phang-nga, and an excellent kaeng som , a thin very spicy and sour curry with fish and papaya, again in Phang-nga.

I love discovering new places, and found the tiny picturesque town of Phang Nga a great place for southern Thai food. There seem to be more cafes here than any other town of any size in Thailand, all offering delicious snacks. On the other hand, I found Phuket City to be vastly overrated in terms of its food. There are few restaurants in the town center (at least compared to other Thai towns), and the choices weren&apos;t so great. Krabi&apos;s night market was excellent, a mostly Muslim affair, but not as tasty or exciting as Satun&apos;s much smaller night market. In general, I still think the best overall town for food in the south is still Trang. It has everything; old-school Chinese cafes, excellent southern Thai restaurants, Muslim food, Chinese food, a really fun morning market, and the best night market I&apos;ve ever been to.

click on the image Kaeng som is probably the most well known southern dish within Thailand. Kaeng som is actually the name of a similar central Thai dish, so central Thais tend to refer to the southern version as kaeng lueang, or “yellow curry”, because of its color. This is not to be confused with the yellow curry that most foreigners are familiar with, which is a coconut-milk based curry of Indian origin called kaeng karii “curry curry” by Thais. Confused? Good, now we can begin.

Kaeng som (which I will continue to call it here) actually translates as “sour curry”, but the predominate taste is usually that of spicy. Very spicy. I consider this to be probably the spiciest curry in the country (which says a lot in a country of spicy curries!). The curry paste consists of a few simple ingredients, and the soup consists of fish (or other seafood) and typically one kind of vegetable (or fruit). That’s it.

Here are the curry paste ingredients:
 
Small fresh “bird shit” chilies 25
Small dried chilies 15
Garlic, chopped 6-8 cloves
Fresh turmeric, chopped 1 Tbsp
Salt 1 tsp
Shrimp paste 1 Tbsp

Using a mortar and pestle, smash all of these together very, very finely (it is important to do this well so you won’t happen upon any large bits of chili in your soup!).
 
The finished curry paste.

Put the curry paste aside and prepare the soup ingredients. Thinly slice sour, slightly unripe pineapple, about 1 cup. Clean and cut some fish into bite-size pieces until you have about 1-1 1/2 cups. I’m using a kind of fish known as plaa kraphong (sorry, can’t recall English name), which is the most common fish used in this dish. I reckon any white-fleshed sea fish will do. Set both of these aside. For your mise en place you’ll need a bottle of fish sauce, 3-4 sliced limes ready for squeezing, and some sugar.

Bring about 3-4 cups of water to the boil, add about half of the curry paste and stir and simmer until the broth is fragrant. Add more curry paste if necessary, but don&apos;t add it all at once as it may be too much!
 

Add the pineapple.
 
Simmer until it begins to soften, 3-4 minutes, and taste the curry. The pineapple should add a slightly sweet flavor to the broth. If you prefer more of this, add a bit of sugar.

Squeeze a few limes’ worth of lime juice into the broth until you reach a tolerable state of sourness.
 
Remember, it is called “sour” curry, so there should be a definite sour taste, followed by spicy, salty and sweet. Add some fish sauce if it isn’t salty enough.

Now add your fish.
 

Simmer until the fish is just done, 2-3 minutes, remove from heat, and you’re done!
 
Serve with rice.

I like using pineapple in this dish as it adds a wonderful sweet flavor, but a variety of other veggies can be used, including pickled bamboo (very common and extremely sour) or slices of unripe papaya.

click on the image Spent a pleasant couple hours yesterday with Pim, of chez pim fame. She took me to the Tha Phra Chan area, a wonderfully congested part of Old Bangkok that is positively reeking of good eats. Among the things we feasted on were khao chae , a bizarre combination of jasmine-scented rice in ice water and savory tidbits:
 

Here&apos;s another vendor just up the road selling the same thing:
 
Khao chae is something I didn&apos;t care for too much the first time I tried it, but the mixture of sweet and savory is actually quite good, and you can expect to hear more from me about this unique dish in the near future.

Also espied were a right handsome basket of Chinese rose apples:
 

Some technicolor Thai treats:
 

And some equally colorful juices:
 

And this veg, called phak waan :
 
The fact that I knew the Thai name for this semi-obscure vegetable really freaked the vendor out, and I think she thought I was Thai and Pim was a foreigner!

Came across these:
 
A kind of crispy roti , a snack I&apos;d never seen before.

And finally, keeping with my Thai Baked Goods theme, an appallingly disgusting-looking baked treat labelled simply as &quot;Thai Pizza&quot;:
 
Don&apos;t you always ask for lengthwise-sliced hotdogs, mayonaise, and peas on your Thai pizza?

And for those of you who are wondering what the real Pim looks like (she chooses to hide behind the false safety of a gigantic tea cup at her blog) I&apos;m offering images of Pim in in her home environment for $20 a pop. Contact me for delivery details.

Here&apos;s a closeup of the bacon:
 
I must admit, I&apos;ve got mixed feelings about this one. I mean, everybody likes bacon, right? But does everybody really like bacon artfully twisted in flaky pastry dough and baked until cripsy? Well, now that I mention it... Honestly though, I think bacon, and the world, are probably not ready for this. I&apos;ll probably get tons of hate mail from people accusing me of being a bacon conservative, but I have to go with my gut instinct here and give Tesco/Lotus&apos;s Bacon Pastry a thumbs down. The dog liked it though.

click on the image Today&apos;s lesson revolves around two southern Thai dishes, specifically those using khamin , turmeric. This bright orange root, as I&apos;ve said about 64 times already, is an incredibly popular ingredient in southern Thai cooking, and it is what tends to give these dishes orange/yellow hue. Today&apos;s recipes use the stuff both in dried form and fresh; essentially two completely different ingredients. The first, plaa thot khamin , fish fried with tumeric, uses powdered turmeric largely to counter any unpleasant &quot;fishy&quot; smells, and to give the dish an attractive yellow/orange color. The second recipe, plaa krabok tom khamin , mullet in a turmeric broth, uses a generous amount of the fresh stuff to provide a wonderfully acidic/fragrant/sweet flavor to the broth.

For the turmeric fried fish I&apos;m using plaa saay daeng , this fish:
 
but plaa insee , Spanish mackerel fillets are also common, and very good.

Take about 1/4 cup of garlic (preferably small cloves with a thin peel--don&apos;t worry about removing every last bit of peel--you&apos;ll soon see why) and smash it up real violent like using a mortar and pestle:
 

Next, take about an 1/8 cup of rice flour, an 1/8 cup of all-purpose flour, a teaspoon of turmeric power and a teaspoon of salt and mix this up with the garlic in a bowl.

Coat the scaled and gutted fish with this mixture and set aside for 10 minutes:
 

After the 10 minutes, shake off the excess garlic/flour mixture, reserving all of it (there should be a lot), and fry the fish on both sides in plenty of oil over a medium-high flame:
 

When the fish is cooked, crispy and yellow, remove and allow to drain. Now put all of the reserved garlic/flour mixture in the same oil and cook until crispy. Ladle this cripy gold over the fish, and serve:
 

Now, for the mullet (heheh...) in turmeric broth, take a couple small cleaned and gutted mullets:
 
and chop their heads off. You could even chop the bodies into long-ish bits (as I did) if you prefer.

Bring about three cups of water to a boil. In meantime prepare your broth flavoring ingredients, a couple stalks of lemongrass, some peeled shallots, peeled turmeric and chilies:
 

Using a pestle or the head of a your nearest loved one, generously bruise two stalks of lemongrass
 
the shallots and chilies (this helps the flavors to release more easily), and throw all of this into the broth and simmer until the broth is yellow and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes:
 

Add your mullet (hehehe...) and bring to a gentle boil. Add a few torn kaffir lime leaves . Flavor to taste with fish sauce and lime:
 

You is done:

click on the image Talaat nat were defined by my university Thai textbook as &quot;occasional markets&quot;. This doesn&apos;t help much, so let me explain: Every Saturday afternoon in my neighborhood, a market springs up out of nowhere. There are prepared foods and ingredients, as well as lesser-important non food related frivolities. It&apos;s a big deal and EVERYBODY comes out, the old, the young, beggars, construction workers from the nearby housing project... It&apos;s a lot of fun, and virtually only a few steps from my door.

 
These beautiful rose apples are for sale every week.

 
Stopping by to pick up the essentials; limes and dried fish (?).

 
This is where to get your garlic and shallot fix. She&apos;s mobile.

 
Southern Thai-style curries. I think there must be several people of southern Thai origin in my neighborhood, as there are about three or four stalls selling this type of food.

 
This khao mok kai is sold by a Muslim family.

 
In addition to southern food, there are also a couple people selling northern Thai food. The sausages above are a northern speciality called sai ua and consist of fatty pork and fresh herbs such as lemongrass, lime leaf and galangale. Very, very good.

 
Continuing on the sausage theme, these northeastern-style sausages are filled with rice, glass noodles, and a kind of sour, fermented pork, and are also grilled.

 
Another popular northeastern dish is grilled freshwater fish, especially catfish, as seen at the top of the pic. The other fish are coated in salt before being grilled.

 
These are nam phrik , various &quot;salsas&quot; or dips that you have over rice or with vegetables.

 
And for dessert, try a pumpkin filled with custard and steamed, or

 
colored sugar twisted into birds and other shapes.

click on the image Haha.. Just kidding. You don&apos;t think I&apos;d go and do that, do you? However, if things go well I&apos;m going to be regularly contributing food features and restaurant reviews to the Thursday food section of ThaiDay, the paper bundled with the International Herald Tribune. My first assignment looks to be a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred expose of Rotiboy , Bangkok&apos;s latest and strangest food craze. For the two or three of you who don&apos;t know, Rotiboy is a Malaysian chain that sells nondescript coffee-flavored buns. Actually I shouldn&apos;t say buns, as the Bangkok Rotiboy sells exactly ONE kind of bun. And against all logic this bun has become madly popular here. There are two hour waits. There are limits on the number of buns you can buy. It&apos;s total freaking madness over a simple pastry. Here&apos;s a line people waiting to buy Rotiboy buns on Silom:
 
Anyway, hopefully more on Rotiboy later, because as most of my reviews and articles for ThaiDay will concern food in Thailand, I&apos;m thinking of asking the editor if it would be OK to cross-post them all here.

click on the image Due to the request of one of the many millions of RealThai readers, today&apos;s reportage will be the first in a series to focus on bamii , Chinese-egg noodles that are very popular in Thailand. Normally served with barbecued pork or crab meat, these noodles can also be had with kiaow , wontons, and are a favorite late-night snack.

I&apos;m going to start with something close to home, my neighborhood&apos;s mobile kiaow vendor. This guy cycles around my neighborhood during lunchtime selling bamii and kiaow. We know he&apos;s coming because he strikes a hollow piece of wook making a tok-tok-tok sound.

I was at the computer working, heard the sound, ran downstairs, and saw him just down the street:
 

I called him over (isn&apos;t mobile food wonderful?):
 

And orderd a fat bowl of kiaow naam , wonton with broth (many people like to order bamii and kiaow haeng , meaning, without broth). This is him at work:
 
(I supplied my own bowl.)

His stuff is pretty MOR, nothing that&apos;s going to make the front cover of Bamee Magazine, but good in a pinch. Here&apos;s the result:
 
I do like the fact that he puts bits of khaeb moo , deep-fried pork crackling (pork rinds for all you Americans) in with it. Other than this though, I find his bamii/kiaow too meaty for me. I prefer the kind with crab meat and lots of phak kwaang tung , a green leafy vegetable that is hiding somewhere under all that flesh in this picture. There is also a place near my house that serves bamii pet , bamii with duck. More on that soon.

click on the image This fried noodle dish is something I enjoyed when I first moved to Thailand, and I even made it at home a couple times. For some reason though I somehow lost track of phat sii ew and hadn&apos;t eaten it for about four years.

Just recently I was stranded on a street near my house and &quot;discovered&quot; an excellent phat sii ew shop. The name of the shop is Laad Naa Yod Phak Nay Lao , (&quot;Mr Yao&apos;s Laad Naa with Tender Vegetables&quot;, laad naa is another dish made there), a well-known shop downtown that has a branch near my neighborhood. Eating here made me realize what I had been missing all these years. For those who don&apos;t know, phat see ew is made by frying wide rice noodles with eggs, pork, and phak khanaa (Chinese broccoli), with a soy sauce-based sauce. This place makes truly amazing phat sii ew. It&apos;s done in a huge freaking wok over a very strong flame:
 

First the eggs are fried, then the noodles and veggies are added. The noodles are pre-soaked in the sauce, which the cook (below) told me is a mixture of soy sauce (sii ew) and oyster sauce.
 

And the best thing is that from order to eat takes honestly no more than two minutes!

Here&apos;s my dish:
 
Because of the way they&apos;re flash-fried, the whole dish has a wonderfully smoky taste. I&apos;m not a big meat eater, so I always order mine minus pork and extra veggies, that&apos;s why it looks particularly green.

Here&apos;s an action shot of the eating process:

click on the image Today&apos;s lesson in bizarre Thai pastries is an extra super double blowout edition, featuring two very unusual baked treats from the local Yamazaki, a Japanese bakery.

First we begin with a pastry called, and I&apos;m not joking here, the Weiner Kids Donut:
 
Yes, Kids, it&apos;s the snack you&apos;ve been waiting for: part savory, part cripy sweet, this is essentially a hot dog (the aforementioned &quot;Weiner&quot;) encased in dough, rolled in bread crumbs, deep-fried, and generously topped with a dollop of sweet ketchup. The thing was so oily that if you stuck a wick in it you could probably use it to read by for a couple weeks.

The next example is the ambitiously-titled Crab Pizza Danish:
 
OK, there are obviously a lot of faults with this one, but my main objection to the Crab Pizza Danish is why try to do so much with one pastry? I can (sort of) conceive of a Crab Danish, or even a Pizza Danish, or even more so a Crab Pizza, but why on earth would somebody try to combine all there of these disparate elements? And what&apos;s with those toppings:
 
It&apos;s a bit hard to see here, but you&apos;ve got imitation crab, pineapple, &quot;cheese&quot; and ketchup, all mingling on the same platform. I almost chose its neighbor, the Corn Pizza Danish, but felt that imitation crab was something I couldn&apos;t pass up.

click on the image Continuing on the bamii theme, today I went to the local bamii pet , duck with egg noodles, shop. This kind of bamii is a bit more hard to find than the usual that has pork or crab, but is quite good, if not better.

The noodles they use here are really good, similar in quality to egg noodles I&apos;ve had in China. Here is the guy parboiling the noodles before adding them to the bowl:
 

If you&apos;re not into noodles, you can also order something called kao lao , which is basically the dish without the addition of noodles, and which includes a ladlefull of &quot;gravy&quot; made from fermented soybeans and duck broth, giving the dish a deep, savory flavor.

The shop uses entire Chinese-style roasted ducks. Here&apos;s the guy who chops them up:
 

And here&apos;s my bowl:
 

I ordered bamii pet naam , egg noodles with duck and broth. There&apos;s also some phak kwaang tung , a green leafy vegetable hiding under there.

click on the image Spent the last few days in Penang, Malaysia. An interesting place, if it&apos;s your first time, but I&apos;ve been there three times already, and wasn&apos;t exactly looking forward to it. Luckily though, there&apos;s the food. Georgetown (Penang is actually the name of the entire island) is essentially a Chinese town, but there are lots of Indians, and some malaysians, which makes for an interesting culinary mix. Although I&apos;ve been before, most of my culinary experiences were quite random, and I owe a lot to Robyn of EatingAsia for her helpful information. All in all, I&apos;d have to say that Georgetown is probably the single best city for eating authentic asian food anywhere in Asia--at least of all the places I&apos;ve been.

Georgetown is especially known for its hawker food, which means there are lots of people selling food from carts like this:
 

And since the food is on the street, you also eat on the street, like this:
 
or this:
 

Here&apos;s a guy selling Chinese-style herbal drinks on the street:
 

And the street-food mirth doesn&apos;t stop at night:
 

But actually, the thing I liked the most are the numerous old-school cafes, where several different vendors congregate and a variety of food and drink is available. Most of these are Chinese, and serve a variety of largely noodle-based dishes. Here&apos;s an example:
 

That handsome looking dish in the foreground was char kway teow. Here it is being made:
 

In all honesty, virtually everything Chinese in Georgetown seemed to revolve around noodles. They were good, but dishes often seemed quite similar to each other and usually made every effort to distance themselves from vegetables.

My personal favorite was the Indian places. They are almost exclusively southern Indian in origin, which means you&apos;re getting great banana-leaf veggie meals and treats such as thosai and idli. This stuff is somewhat expensive and hard to find here in Bangkok, so I had about four thosai every day to make up for lost time! Here are some thosai (&quot;pancakes&quot; of fermented rice flour) being made:
 
These deliciously sour and cripy treats are fried on one side (as shown) and served up on a banana leaf with dal (lentil curry) and a coconut-garlic and a tomato-based sauce.

Virtually all eats in Penang, regardless of origin, are washed down with a sweet teh tarik (literally, &quot;pulled tea&quot;, so named to describe how the tea is poured from a great distance to create a frothy head):
 

On my last night I visited an outdoor hawker center at the end of Gurney Drive and experienced my best meal (thanks Robyn!). I started with rojak, a &quot;salad&quot; of assorted fruit with a shrimp paste/sugar/tamarind dressing:
 
This is a dish of Indonesian/Malay origin, and can also be found in Singapore.

I followed this assam laksa (also known as Penang laksa), a noodle dish (of course) with a slightly sour fish-based broth:
 
This was good, a lot like Thai khanom jeen except with udon noodles! The broth had some fresh herbs and pineapple, which I thought was nice.

But the best I had that night was chicken claypot, a ceramic urn holding rice cooked in chicken broth, a few pieces of chicken, a huge slabba ginger, chinese sausage and topped with an egg (why don&apos;t people combine chicken and egg more often?):
 
Damn, this was good. The rice was crispy and fragrant, and the claypot was served with a black pepper-inudated broth that could (I imagine) be poured over the rice, or taken seperately.

 Vive le Soi! (ThaiDay, 02/03/06)
 Live the vie en rose in Bangkok&apos;s French Quarter. 

For authentic regional food, Bangkok’s ethnic enclaves are an obvious destination. What better place to go for hummus and tabouli than the Nana area? Thinking of dhal and chapatti? Think of Phahurat, Bangkok’s Little India. And Yaowarat, Bangkok’s Chinatown, is the obvious choice for all foods Chinese. These neighborhoods and their cuisines are well established, however in recent years a new ethnic district has begun to emerge in Bangkok. Home to a bakery, an ambitious butcher shop, a restaurant popular among French expats, a wine shop, and numerous cafés, Soi Convent, “Bangkok’s Champs Elysées”, has all the attributes of a Parisian arrondisement. The following is a rundown of the French food establishments found in Bangkok’s newest ethnic enclave.

La Boulange
2-2/1 Convent Road
02 631 0355

For many, the first image that comes to mind when most people think of French food is bread, and it is thus fitting that the first French business to become established on Soi Convent was a bakery. La Boulange was started up seven years ago, and was probably Bangkok’s first high-quality independent bakery. In the beginning the small café/bakery sold a small selection of high-quality pastries and sourdough breads baked on the premises in an imposing wood-burning oven. However, other than a cup of coffee or a simple sandwich, La Boulange was largely a take-home affair, and never progressed past this.

 
Tempting pastries at La Boulange.

After less than a year in business, La Boulange was taken over by Bangkok-based French hotelier, Robert Molinary. The wood-burning oven was removed, and under the guidance of an experienced French chef, a greater emphasis was put on bistro-type meals and wines. “This business is more competitive now,” explains acting GM and self-proclaimed “food engineer” Patrick Parthonnaud, about the decision to revamp the restaurant. Today, La Boulange’s breads are baked in factories in Bangkok and Pattaya, however, for those concerned, Parthonnaud assures me that “The bread is still exactly the same.” There are now as many as 20 varieties of pain sold at La Boulange, including the hearty country-style loaf, pain de campagne, a sourdough-rye bread, and such Parisian staples as baguette and batard. The bakery is still producing pastries, and La Boulange’s marble-topped street front tables are probably the most pleasant place in Bangkok to take a café au lait.

Gargantua
10/2 Soi 6 Convent Road
02 630 4577

Tucked into the end of an unremarkable side street, Gargantua is the unusual name behind a recently opened French-style butcher shop. Part owner, Arnaud Carré, is a fifth-generation butcher from Brittany who has been involved with meat since childhood. “I used to work in my

father’s butcher shop as a child,” explains Carré between endless cigarettes and coffee. After running his father’s business for several years, Carré spent 10 years in the US working for a chain of steakhouses, and eventually opened a French-style boucherie in Manhattan. When asked why he decided to relocate to Bangkok, he replies confidently, “I am a man of challenge.”

Challenges aside, Gargantua is one of the few domestic producers of elusive French products such as terrine de lapin, rabbit terrine; merguez, Algerian-style spicy lamb sausages; and saucisse aux herbes, fresh herb sausages; as well as choice cuts of beef and veal. All of the meat products, except for lamb, are Thai, and when asked about the quality of Thai beef, Carré is quick to reply, “The quality of meat here is fantastic. High quality Thai beef is close to

 

American beef, if prepared right.” After less than a year in business, Carré already has plans to open another branch of Gargantua “somewhere in Bangkok”, and will soon be expanding his range of merchandise to include a greater variety of fresh sausages and other products.

Wine Connection
Unit 5 Ground Floor, Sivadon Building
1 Convent Road
02 234 0388

You’ve bought yourself a baguette and a few slices of pâté, now what do you drink? The obvious choice would be wine, and since 2002, Wine Connection on Soi Convent has proven itself to be one of the best places in the city to buy a bottle. Wine Connection’s CEO and founder, Michael Trocherie, hails from the south of France and previously worked in Vietnam

 

exporting French wine to other parts of Asia. After seven years of this, he decided to move to Bangkok and import instead. “I wanted to be on the other side of the business,” explains Trocherie. Wine Connection began as an online business, and opened its first shop on Sukhumvit 32 in 2000. Since then the store has expanded to various locations in Bangkok and Thailand, as well as Singapore.

 
The search for that perfect bottle is not difficult at Wine Connection.

Part of the reason for Wine Connection’s success is its shops; they are attractively designed and well organized, just like a good wine shop in Europe or the US. And there is also volume; the Soi Convent branch of Wine Connection alone sells more than 250 kinds of wine, with a large proportion of these being, not surprisingly, French. Thankfully for the consumer, Wine Connection emphasizes mid-range wines, and several excellent bottles can be found for 600 baht or less. I ask Michael for a recommendation and he suggests a Domaine de la Begou, a red from southern France. “It won a gold medal in France, but it’s not a famous name,” he explains. “It’s a very good wine, but not expensive, exactly the kind of thing we like to sell.”

 

Cafés
Any self-respecting French street wouldn’t be caught dead without its cafés, and Soi Convent is no exception. Starting at the Silom end of Soi Convent is a branch of the ubiquitous Starbucks (1/3 Convent Road), equipped with Wi-Fi for those who prefer to read Le Monde online with their coffee. On the same side of the street is the Café Swiss (3 Convent Road, www.swisslodge.com). More a restaurant than a café, the location offers a pleasant outdoor dining area and a European-style breakfast buffet. The Tung Who Coffee Shop (13/1 Convent) across the street serves “Original Thai Coffee” and a number of Chinese/Thai dishes. Goûte House is a small bakery (French only in name) selling a variety of pastries including palmiers, a sweet of French origin. And finally, near Sathorn, are the Café de Convent, a small café-cum-florist, and Goodwill, an attractive café with a Thai menu

 


(Boxed restaurant review)
Indigo
6 Convent Road
02 235 3268
indigobangkok@yahoo.com

Located in an attractive former schoolhouse and boasting one of the loveliest outdoor dining areas in town, Indigo has been a popular meeting place for French expats since opening five years ago. I had never visited the restaurant until a friend of mine, a French cookbook author, urged me to go, expressing repeatedly that it was “very French”. I wasn’t sure what she meant by this, and not once did she mention the restaurant’s food, but I trust her judgment and decided to drop by.

Arriving at 4:45 to an empty restaurant and a confused waitress, my companion and I were seated and promptly given lunch menus. We requested the dinner menu, and I began with one of the specials, rocket salad (190 baht) and my companion with warm goat cheese salad (320 baht). The rocket salad reminded me of rocket salads I’ve made at home (which is a good thing,

 

but not particularly exciting when eating out), but the warm goat cheese salad was more interesting; a bed of mixed greens supporting two toasts topped with fresh thyme and melted rounds of local goat cheese. My salad was followed by blanquette de veau à l’ancienne (390), a notoriously difficult to make “stew” of veal. I should by know not to order any dish employing the word “traditional”, and the blanquette was flat, the cream and egg yolk-based sauce heavy and lacking the zest and spice that more current interpretations of the dish often allow. And as if to rub my nose in my lackluster choice, my companion purred over her bar à la provençale (390 baht), fillets of sea bass pan-fried with olives capers, tomatoes, lemon and basil. We’ve all seen this dish (and this fish) before, but again, she had made the wiser selection, and the result was satisfyingly crispy, savory and tart. Our food was taken with the house white wine (120 baht), a predictable Chardonnay, and we ended our meal by sharing a tarte fine aux pommes et glace vanille (170 baht), a freshly-baked apple tart with vanilla ice cream. Tasty, but I always get a little sad when the warm tart melts all of my ice cream.

 
The old world charm of Indigo&apos;s whitewashed interior.

Up to this point our food had been underwhelming and overpriced, and the setting perfect, and I was wondering if this was what my friend meant by “very French”. However, my understanding came later, when the owner of Indigo, initially wary of my picture snapping and wandering around his restaurant, caught on that I was a food critic, invited himself to sit down at our table and began to gush about his restaurant, bringing us wheels of French cheese and frightfully large loaves of bread to look at. Cynics would say he was doing this to promote his restaurant, and they would undoubtedly be correct, but I found this unabashed love of food touching and very French. If only this affection would carry over to the restaurant’s kitchen.

In what is apparently a misguided effort to do something &quot;new&quot;, the good people at BreadTalk, Siam Paragon, have somehow got in in their heads that the combination of an Indian bread and a Thai soup is what people want. And when I say combination, I don&apos;t mean a bowl of tom yam soup served with a piece of naan bread. That would be normal. Rather, BreadTalk has created what must be the world&apos;s first soup-flavored bread. Or perhaps the world&apos;s first bread-flavored soup. Thus, behold the Tom Yam Naan:
 
Seen from the outside, the Tom Yam Naan looks innocent, even harmless. However, upon closer inspection:
 
we are able to break the Tom Yam Naan into it&apos;s constituent parts: 1) The naan, consisting of naan bread. 2) The &quot;tom yam&quot; filling, consisting of chicken, slime, chilis, and cilantro (coriander). Not sure what this has to do with tom yam. Where&apos;s the galangale? I certainly don&apos;t see any lemongrass. And tom yam doesn&apos;t have slime. Oh yes, and let&apos;s not forget that tom yam is a freaking soup. Inspired by the Tom Yam Naan, I&apos;m thinking of writing BreadTalk a letter with some of my own ideas: Som Tam Donut: a deep-fried crispy roll with a tender papaya salad filling. Phat Thai Bagels: a sassy &quot;bagel&quot; of fried rice noodles with a zesty tamarind-based topping. Green Curry Baguette: a bright green baguette with hidden bites of eggplant, Thai basil, chilis and chicken. Mmm....

Again, the dish consists of mostly fish-related balls served with noodles in a clear broth. This particular example was not amazing, but rather the restaurant&apos;s setting in a really cool old shophouse was what drew me in:
 
It&apos;s hard to see in this pic, but the shop has the old wooden booths that can be found in many of Bangkok&apos;s older restaurants. The place is located steps away from Chang Pier, near Wat Phra Kaew and all the other touristy stuff. A cool glimpse of Olde Bangkok, and fun place to eat, but in terms of noodles I think I prefer my local joint .

The most interesting aspect of my experience at Rotiboy didn’t actually involve eating, but rather, waiting in line. For those of you who don’t know, Rotiboy is a Malaysian bread chain that recently opened two outlets in Bangkok to enormous acclaim. I’m not sure how word spreads here, and didn’t realize that bread was so popular among Thais, but Rotiboy somehow became an instant hit, and initially, waits of 1-2 hours for the chain’s famous coffee-flavored buns were not uncommon.

Rotiboy (“one is never enough… buns to die for!”) began in 1998 as a neighborhood bakery in Penang, Malaysia. Sales of it’s curiously named Mexican bun (now even more curiously branded as the Rotiboy) quickly soared, and after opening its first domestic outlet in 2002, Rotiboy can now be found Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and as of December 2005, Bangkok. The Bangkok branch sells exactly one product, the aforementioned Rotiboy (25 baht), a largish, rather unattractive, coffee flavored bun, and sells it very well (a recent call to Rotiboy
 
Bangkok to inquire about many buns were sold each day elicited a cold “I’m sorry we cannot reveal this information” from the store’s manager). With excellent international chains such as Le Notre, and up-and-coming domestic bakers such as Visage now making pastries of a very high level available in Bangkok, I find it strange that a largely obscure establishment selling a single product at a relatively high price could generate so much attention. And so, in the interests of investigative journalism, I decided to brave the buzz (and the lines) and taste the bun.

To truly take part in the Rotiboy experience, I decided that I needed to visit the Silom branch of the franchise during its busiest peak, the afternoon rush hour, and do what everybody else buying Rotiboy buns must do: wait. Arriving at 4:38 on a Monday afternoon I was disappointed to learn that things have apparently slowed down a bit in recent weeks. Although an hour’s wait is still the norm, and supplies are still being rationed (a sign behind the counter
reads: “Each customer may purchase no more than 10 buns. We apologize for any inconvenience.”), the only indication that things might possibly get out of control were a few traffic cones to direct the crowds. I stepped into the tail end of a very long and civil line (why can’t people queue like this at ATMs or hospitals?) and began my wait.

After several minutes of waiting, I turned to the woman behind me and asked, “Is the line like this every day?”
“Wow, you can speak Thai,” was her reply, ignoring my question.
“So, don’t you think this is a rather long line?” I attempted again.
“Where did you learn Thai?” she replied. Apparently waiting an hour in line to buy buns was not a particularly unusual experience for this woman, and there were more interesting things to talk about. We continued to inch forward at a tedious rate, which was made somewhat more pleasant (or unbearable?) by the rich scent of coffee wafting out of the bakery. Although I was
 
initially skeptical about Rotiboy, waiting in line for 20 minutes had actually sharpened my desire to get that bun, and I was already reconsidering how many I wanted to buy. Making customers wait suddenly seemed like a extremely shrewd marketing technique.

Upon finally reaching the counter (time: 5:18) I purchased my solitary Rotiboy (employee: “Only one?”), ran under the BTS escalator, and immediately tore into it. The verdict? Well, it was quite good, actually. Despite my normally high journalistic morals, I was prepared to dislike Rotiboy from the start, seeing it as yet another hyped-up product, but was pleasantly surprised. Less bun-like than it appears, the Rotiboy is actually very similar in taste and texture to an American-style buttermilk pancake. The shell was satisfyingly crispy, and the soft interior was laced with a generous aroma (rather than taste) of coffee and a layer of melted butter. I wolfed down my prize, looked back on the line that had now grown even longer, and reflected on my Rotiboy experience. Was it really worth the wait? Honestly, I would love to write more on this, but unfortunately I need to get in line for my next bun. Sorry.

For those interested in trying the bun, but not willing to brave the lines, there are now several Rotiboy alternatives available in Bangkok. Most of these revolve around Siam Square, home to a popular branch of Rotiboy, and a virtual epicenter of Bangkok&apos;s coffee-flavored bun craze. 
Crystal Jade My Bread (Basement, Siam Paragon, 02 610 7581) My Bread&apos;s Mexico Coffee Bun (25 baht) is the least coffee-like but the most buttery of its genre. I bought a bun to go, and the staff recommended that I heat it up before eating. In retrospect this was good advice, as the generous butter filling was solid and overwhelmingly rich. 
BreadTalk (Basement, Siam Paragon, 02 610 7588-9) The Coffi-0 (22 baht) is this Singaporean bread chain&apos;s answer to the Rotiboy. Featuring a sweet, green pandanus-flavored filling, in terms of taste, concept, and name, it doesn&apos;t get much weirder than this. 
Papa Roti (Siam Square, next to Dr. Maarten&apos;s, near the stage) Papa Roti resembles its popular predecessor in every way, even down to the shop&apos;s yellow decor and nearly identical smiling chef logo. The buns (25 baht) are served hot (&quot;always fresh always tasty&quot;) and have the proper balance of coffee and butter that one would expect from such an eerily &quot;similar&quot; competitor.

Veeraphong Suwannasin is clearly a man excited about his work. As I wander around Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat, a graceful century-old structure on the grounds of Wat Benchamabophit, he is more than happy to describe the stories depicted in the structure’s vast murals, and is
 
eager to provide information about the building. However, Suwannasin’s job, and the structure we are in are anything but typical. Suwannasin is a member of the Department of Fine Arts’ mural restoration team, and Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat is the former ordination hall of King Chulalongkorn, Rama V.

Established 30 years ago, the Department of Fine Arts’ mural restoration team has been responsible for the restoration, upkeep and renovation of an estimated 1,000 sites in Thailand. These restorations can range in subject from Buddha statues to stucco wall designs, but the team is particularly experienced at restoring and protecting the painted murals that often line the inside walls of Buddhist temples in Thailand. They are the only team of its kind in the
 
country, and are thus responsible for the restoration and upkeep of some of the most important Buddhist art in Thailand. The team’s current restoration efforts at Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat involves murals, and is, in the words of Suwannasin, a particularly “special” job. “It will take us longer than usual, and many influential people expect to see good work,” he explains.

Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat is one of four structures that were originally located in the Grand Palace as part of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. The buildings served as the ordination hall of Prince Chulalongkorn during his time as a monk, and when he later became king, he
 
ordered the structures to be relocated to the grounds of his newly commissioned temple, Wat Benjamabophit. After being moved, they were joined together and served as the residence of the temple’s first abbot. Not much later, a series of 20 murals depicting the life and reign of King Rama V were painted on the inside walls of one of the structures.

As with most murals in Thailand, the murals at Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat have suffered a great deal of wear and tear over the years. This includes water damage that erased an entire wall of paintings, and cracks that were the result of previous structural repairs. Large chunks
 
of the murals have come loose, and a number of hollow spots in the plaster have formed. The structure was previously renovated by the team in 1985, but ongoing water damage at the base of the paintings, a common problem with temple murals, necessitated a new renovation.

Despite the difficulties involved and the high profile of the structure, this type of job is nothing new to the team, explains Somsak Taengphan, administrative head of the group. “We have to train our workers and teach them the rules [of restoration],” explains Taengphan. “All members of the team have art backgrounds, but painting and restoration are not the same.”
 
The team has 14 permanent members, but also employs the help of other artists for particularly big jobs. Taengphan explains how restoration work on Wat Suthat, a well-known Ratanakosin-era temple in Bangkok, required the help of more than100 artists, and took more than three years.

The ongoing work at Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat involves six full-time workers, and while there, I am given a crash course in mural restoration by Taengphan and other members of the team. They explain that the first step in restoring murals involves removing the surface dust and grime that has accumulated over the years. This is typically done by applying a sheet of mulberry paper to the surface of paintings and painting over this with a wet brush. “The paper absorbs the dirt and can be removed without damaging the murals,” explains Suwannasin. The
 
use of mulberry paper may seem like a quaint throwback, but according to Virachai Suksawadi, a veteran member of the team, “The most important thing is to use the original materials.” Despite the advances of modern technology, the team strives to use the original methods and materials whenever possible. This leads them to employing such obscure products as buffalo skin, sugarcane juice and tamarind seeds, typically gathering and preparing these materials themselves.

After removing dust and grime, the second step involves securing the plaster base that supports the murals. Over the years, cracks have developed, pockets of air have formed, and water has caused the plaster to separate from the foundation. Virasuksawadi demonstrates how pockets of air are found simply by knocking on the plaster and listening for a hollow
 
sound, and describes how holes and cracks are filled with epoxy using a large syringe. After injecting the epoxy, loose pieces of plaster are then gently pushed back against the foundation using a cloth-coated pad held over a layer of mulberry paper. For larger structural cracks, occasionally holes are drilled to the foundation, which are then filled with a mixture of glue, plaster and fine sand.

The final step involves painting. This normally involves touching up faded drawings rather than repainting missing or damaged art, which is, for the most part, frowned upon. “We want to make our work look as authentic as possible, but if we have to repaint something, then we have to make it clear that that our work isn’t the original,” explains Virasuksawadi. This is done by discretely outlining or bordering the areas that have been restored or redrawn.

In certain situations where large portions of work are missing, repainting can be an option. “It depends on the work,” replies Virasuksawadi. “If too much is missing, we don’t know what used to be there and we can’t paint.” In the case of Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat the team was asked by Wat Benjamabophit to repaint an entire section of murals that was previously destroyed by water. There were no photographs of the paintings that used to exist, and the team was left to rely on no more than a few written descriptions, the stylistic precedence of
 
remaining paintings and other similar murals as a model. “Normally this is not done,” explains Suwanasin, “But this is a special job, lots of important people will see it, and the temple asked us to do it.” For large areas that need to be repainted, a base made partially from a gum that comes from tamarind seeds is applied to the wall. Then the drawings are then outlined in pencil and painted in using tempera, as opposed to modern watercolors.

The work on Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat, which began in late November is expected to continue until May, and is, in the words of Taengphan, “a perfect job”. “It’s a good size, it’s fun work, and our results will be here a long time.” Without the efforts of Somsak Taengphan and his team, it is almost certain that the murals at Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat, as well as other precious elements of Thailand’s artistic heritage, would undoubtedly fall into obscurity.

Halls of History (Boxed text)
The murals of Phra Thi Nang Song Phanut are unusual in that, rather than illustrate the various life stories of the Buddha as with most temple paintings, they depict events during the life of King Rama V. Painted by unknown artists during the reign of King Rama V, the 20 panels depict the life of the King in chronological order, beginning with his top knot cutting
 
ceremony at the age of 13, and continuing with his ordination, coronation, and travels within Thailand and to foreign countries. One panel in particular describes the story of a man-eating crocodile in Chachoengsao that King Chulalongkorn was involved in exterminating. Yet another panel even depicts the relocation of Phra Thi Nang Song Phanuat from the Grand Palace to its current location at Wat Benjamabophit. The murals are valued for their accurate
depictions of real people, including depictions of King Rama V’s father, King Mongkut, Rama IV, and for the insight they provide into various aspects of royal life in Ratanakosin during the reigns of Rama IV and Rama V, including King Rama IV’s interest in astronomy, and details of his funeral ceremony.

Many claim that it is overpriced and overrated, but if you want to find the best fruit and seafood in town, there&apos;s really no other choice. The market is located across the street from the famous Chatujak Weekend Market, and steps away from the Kampheng Phet MRT station.

Aw Taw Kaw (an abbreviation that stands for the Farmer&apos;s Marketing Organization) is especially known for its fruit. This includes young tamarind:

click on the image Nam phrik are a virtually endless varity of Thai spicy &quot;salsas&quot;. They are typically eaten with rice and raw or par-boiled vegetables, and tend to be based around chillies. Nam phrik kapi, a &quot;dip&quot; based on shrimp paste is one of the easiest Thai recipes of all to make. These are old pics I&apos;ve dug up to contribute to this thread at eGullet , so I don&apos;t have the step-by-step pics you would normally expect to see here.

Nam Phrik Kapi with Fresh and Fried Vegetables
Nam Phrik Kapi is probably the most well known nam phrik in Thailand. As the name suggests, it is made with kapi, a salted and fermented paste of fine shrimp known as khoei, and is always served with fresh and/or parboiled vegetables, as well as egg-battered deep-fried vegetables, as described below. The amount of ingredients listed below for the nam phrik are largely for reference; a Thai chef would virtually never use measuring instruments to cook, and a dish is usually made to taste, keeping in mind a desired balance of the four tastes: sour, spicy, salty and sweet.

3+ phrik khii nuu (very small Thai chillies)
1 tablespoon garlic
1 tablespoon sugar
1 squeezed lime (about 1 tablespoon of juice)
1/4 cup Kapi (Thai shrimp paste)
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons makheua phuang (pea-sized Thai eggplant)

4 eggs
1 Chinese or Japanese eggplant, sliced into 1 cm thick rounds and put in a bowl of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of vinegar to prevent browning
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 bunch of cha om (a pungent vegetable sometimes available frozen in Thai grocery stores)

An assortment of fresh Thai vegetables, such as eggplant, cabbage, carrot, wing bean, long bean, all cut into long bite-size pieces

Using a mortar and pestle, grind the phrik khii nuu with the garlic until a rough paste is formed. Add the sugar and the lime juice and grind together. Add the shrimp paste and continue grinding until a paste forms. Add water. If the mixture is still too thick, add additional water, a teaspoonful at a time (nam phrik kapi should have the consistency of a slightly watery paste). Taste and add more chilies, lime or sugar, to taste. Add the makheua phuang, breaking slightly, but not grinding, with the pestle. Put nam phrik kapi in a serving bowl.
 

Beat eggs with a few drops of fish sauce or a pinch of salt, divide into two bowls and set aside. Drain eggplant and mix thoroughly with one of the bowls of egg. Heat cooking oil in a wok and taking two or three slices at a time, fry the eggplant in oil on both sides until crispy. Set on paper towels to drain. Remove the tender cha om leaves and blend with the eggs. Fry mixture in hot oil as a thick omelet or frittata, turning over to cook on both sides. Drain on a paper towel until cool then slice into bite-sized squares.

Arrange the fresh and fried vegetables on a plate and serve with rice and bowl of nam phrik kapi.

As much as you all love rotten fish, it&apos;s unfortunately not what I&apos;m going to be making for this lesson.

Vinegar, 1 1/2 Tbsp
Water, 1/4 cup

Onion, 1/2 sliced
Ginger, one medium root, chopped

Using a mortar and pestle (or food processor) grind the chili paste ingredients up finely. Set aside.
 

Chop your ginger and onion.
 

Combine the sugar/vinegar/water mixture. Set aside.

Taking your mackerel steak, rub a bit of salt into it (this helps to prevent it from sticking to the pan), and fry it in a generous amount of oil until crispy and somewhat golden.
 

Remove fish and let drain. Remove all but about 1-2 tablespoons of the oil, and add the curry paste ingredients. Fry until blended and fragrant.
 

Add onion and ginger, and fry until onions begin to soften.
 

Add sugar mixture and fry, stirring constantly, over medium heat until slightly reduced. Add more water if the sauce becomes too dry, and continue cooking until sauce is reduced somewhat.

Put fish on plate and cover with the onion/sauce mixture.
 
Done.

The most typical vegetables to be cooked this way are phak boong (&quot;morning glory&quot;--not the flower), phak khanaa (&quot;Chinese broccoli&quot;), and a Thai vegetable known as phak krachet . I make this dish almost every week; it&apos;s easy, nutritious and delicious.

An important element of this dish is the sauce. Here&apos;s what I use:
 

On the left is Heinz brand oyster sauce, and on the right, tao jiaow , a sauce of whole fermented soybeans. Some people will also use a touch of fish sauce or sii ew (Thai soy sauce), but I really like the simple combination of these two ingredients. It&apos;s essential to have your mise en place , the sauces and a bit of water, ready and easy to reach. This whole dish will take no more than about 1 1/2 minutes to make, so timing is essential.

Today I&apos;m using young phak khanaa. I&apos;ve taken the leaves and chopped them into largish pieces, and have halved the harder stalks (sorry, forgot to photograph this!). I usually soak them in cool water to crispen them up before frying.

In a mortar and pestle, grind up a healthy (or my case very healthy) amount of phrik khii noo (tiny Thai chilies) and a few cloves of garlic. Grind them together just enough to break them--you&apos;re not making a paste here. (Sometimes I like to throw a few peppercorns in at this step. This is a personal preference, definately not a Thai thing, but tastes good.) Set aside.

Heat a generous (4 Tbsps?) amount of cooking oil, and fry the smashed garlic and chilies over med-high heat for about 20 seconds, just long enough to make them &quot;wilt&quot;:
 

Then turn your heat up as high as possible, add about 1 Tbsp of the tao jiaow (be careful, it&apos;s very salty), give a quick stir, add the veg, top with some oyster sauce, and a couple tablespoons of water. Now the fun starts: stir the mess up while tilting the pan to one side. If you&apos;ve used enough oil it will ignite in a big fat beautiful flame:
 

Continue to do this several times during the cooking process to ensure that wonderful smoked flavor. Again, this should not take more than 1 minute, and you want the veggies to be just cooked, preferably still crispy and ever-so-slightly undercooked:
 

Done.

Discovering the delights of Thai cuisine need not be a spicy, complicated experience. 

Since the Thai food craze of the1990’s, Thai food has remained popular in the west, but much of this fame has been relegated to restaurants. For many home chefs in the US and Canada, Thai cuisine still carries an intimidating air of the exotic, and most people would rather not make something that can simply be bought at the Thai takeaway around the corner. Additionally, many of the ingredients essential to Thai cooking are misunderstood, or simply not available abroad, as well as the fact that Thai food has the reputation for being extremely spicy—something that intimidates many westerners. In short, there still is a lot to be done to promote Thai cooking internationally, and in an effort to do this, a food journalists’ tour of Bangkok was recently organized by Epicurean International, a US-based company that sells Thai cooking ingredients. During a week in Bangkok, myself and 11 other food writers and editors from North America took part in a Thai cooking school, visited various factories, and tasted Thai food at some of Bangkok’s best Thai restaurants. For many of the participants, this was their first experience with authentic Thai food, and was an introduction to the cuisine’s cooking and flavors. For me, the experience allowed me to see Thai cuisine for the first time once again, and also highlighted some of the trials of introducing an authentic Asian cuisine to North America.
 
Our crash course in Thai cuisine began with two days at the new Epicurean Kitchen Cooking School. As an introduction, we were given an explanation of the various Thai ingredients by the host of a Thai cooking show in the US. As we learned about the various uses of galingale, lemongrass, chilies and coriander, the actual herbs were passed around the table for each of us to touch, smell and taste. When kaffir lime leaf was brought up, Fraya Berg, a food editor at Parents magazine, mentioned the current trend of using the Thai word makrut to describe the leaf, as kaffir is a derogatory term in some countries. Others had questions about the use of frozen or dried herbs as opposed to fresh, as well as questions about the acceptable substitutes for the more obscure Thai ingredients. I felt that many of these concerns were good examples of the issues that Thai food has never been faced with domestically, and that it will have to overcome in order to become popular abroad.

During our two days at the cooking school, we learned to prepared more than 10 dishes, and most were surprised to learn that the actual cooking processes involved in making Thai food are often quite simple. “I enjoyed learning that the blending of Thai flavors is fairly straightforward and based upon a group of basic flavors: galangal, lemongrass, chilies, coconut milk and fish sauce,” explained Julie Miltenberger, a food editor at Family Circle Magazine. When asked what she sees as potential roadblocks to making Thai commonplace in the west, Miltenberger suggested that, “The greatest obstacle I foresee […] is the lack of fresh Thai ingredients in the marketplace. If ingredients are readily available, the food is very easy to assemble.” Gwynneth Galvin, a frequent contributor of food-related articles to Woman’s World magazine, thought that nomenclature might be a potential problem. “I’ll take these recipes back to the US, but I’ll have to rename them, as most people in the US aren’t familiar with the Thai names,” she explained.
 
Despite the fact that Thai ingredients are as simple as the cooking processes used to cook them, many suffer from the misconception that they are unhealthy (coconut milk) or just plain odd (fish sauce, shrimp paste). A visit to two factories where both of these staples are produced helped to clarify some of the misunderstandings surrounding Thai food. At Rungroj Fish Sauce Factory in Rayong, we learned that fish sauce is a pure product, comprised only of anchovies and salt, and that the highest quality fish sauce is the result of the first “pressing”, as one writer referred to it. At Merit Food Products in Cholburi, we saw that coconut milk is not the sweet juice that is found in young coconuts, but rather the liquid that is extracted from mature coconut meat. After visiting these factories, I felt that if people in the west were aware of the processes that go into making these ingredients, they would be more apt to use them.

Another factor that has slowed the progression of Thai food abroad is its reputation for being spicy. However, based on the comments of the journalists, this impression may not always be true. “I thought [Thai food] would be too hot for me, but I don&apos;t think I had one unmanageable dish,” commented Susan Katzman, a freelance food and travel writer, after several Thai meals. “The heat in all we tried enhanced flavor—not overpowered it.” Janice Cole, a food editor at Cooking Pleasures magazine added, “Thai food has developed a reputation for being very spicy in [the US]. While that appeals to many people, it also deters many people. What I found out on the trip is that Thai food can easily be made in a variety of heat levels and people can season their own food to their taste with chili sauce on the side.”
 
Along with Thai food, the popularity of Thai beer is also growing abroad, and I was able to learn more about this facet of Thai cuisine when I visited the Boon Rawd brewery with well-known Canadian beer writer, Stephen Beaumont. Normally the factory is not open to the public, but through a previous arrangement we were given a private tour by the brewery’s German-educated brewmaster, Tavesak Sujjayan. After our tour we were able to sit down and taste some of the brewery’s beers, including Thai, Leo, Kloster, Asahi, and Singha. After tasting the beers and discussing the flavors, Beaumont concluded that, “…variety is not the greatest strength of Thailand&apos;s breweries. Most every beer brewed in the country is a variation on the pale lager theme, with flavors ranging from borderline non-existent to sweetish and straw-like…” Beaumont described Singha as his favorite among the beers, which he described as “well developed and moderately full-bodied.” Although after seeing the factory I did gain a new appreciation for Singha, it’s clear that domestic Thai beer still has a long way to go before it will be well regarded outside of Thailand.
 
At the end of a week, Thai food appeared to win over this food-savvy crowd in a number of ways. Susan Katzman suggested that, “Thai cooking would translate well here in America for those on ‘health’ quests, being low calorie, high color, low fat, [and] full of flavor…” Janice Cole added, “I think one area Americans know little about are Thai salads and I think Americans will be very receptive to learning more about [them].” As an afterthought, Katzman added, “I came home totally addicted to sugar. Who would have thought I could crave those strange looking desserts, but yes, give me mango and sticky rice, or gnocchi-type dumpling in coconut milk over chocolate cake and I&apos;ll be happy.” Each of us took something different away from this experience, but hopefully it will lead to a greater understanding of this exotic cuisine, encourage people in the west to cook Thai food, and hopefully, add a bit of spice—but not too much—to the western palate.

 One outstanding restaurant is Thai Food 101 for those looking for an overview of the cuisine. 

I hadn’t eaten at Hualamphong Food Station for years, and had been meaning to include the restaurant in an article I was writing. Somewhat grudgingly (the restaurant was never easy to find the best of times) I set off to relocate it in the maze that is Sukhumvit Soi 34, but after 40 minutes of searching, came up empty-handed. After trying unsuccessfully to call the restaurant for directions, I went back another day, only to meet the same fate. It wasn’t until long after I had given up hope in ever having another meal at Hualamphong Food Station that I noticed that the restaurant had relocated virtually across the street from my house. And when I say relocated, I really mean it; the various wooden structures that previously formed the restaurant had been taken apart, moved across town, and reassembled at their present location alongside the Kaset-Nawamin Road.

I’m certainly not the only one who has had a hard time located Hualamphong Food Station. Over the years, many a visiting foodie and even a significant number of long-term Bangkok residents have undoubtedly had the pleasure of getting lost on the way to the restaurant. The leafy, rambling assortment of wooden buildings was one of Bangkok’s best-kept “secrets”, and although it was always more popular among foreigners, was recognized for its authentic and delicious Thai food. Hualamphong’s new location is a virtual carbon copy of the original Sukhumvit restaurant, but is located in area that is frequented almost exclusively by middle and upper class Thais; people who conceivably know their how mok nor mai from their nam phrik num, and I was curious to see if this somehow had an effect on the food.
 
Sitting down at Hualamphong’s wooden tables, the emphasis on good food is immediately evident; how many other Thai restaurants serve a complimentary amuse bouche? In this case it’s a long wooden tray with three kinds of chili dips and an attractive array of fresh vegetables, including such obscure regional herbs such as phak khayaeng and ton or. Hualamphong is best known for its takes on regional Thai cuisine, and the menu is a virtual culinary map of the country, including dishes such as the northern style sausage known as sai ua, an obscure jackfruit salad from the northeast, and budu song khrueang, a chili dip from the south. Although I commend the restaurant’s efforts to feature unusual dishes, I wonder how many diners actually order dishes such as fried ducks’ beaks, ants’ eggs, or the northern specialty, fried bamboo worms (although I’ll admit, the worms, 80 baht, are actually quite good).

Despite featuring dishes from every corner of Thailand, Hualamphong seems to be most confident in its execution of isaan food, and the best dish of our visit was the preserved pork salad mixed with crispy seasoned rice (80 baht), a dish of Vietnamese origin that Thais know as naem khluk. I’ve had this dish elsewhere numerous times, yet am almost always disappointed. This is a pity because the idea behind the dish is wonderful: a spicy/sour mixture of crispy deep-fried rice with fresh herbs, peanuts, and fermented pork. However, more often than not, the rice tends to be a gray, mushy pulp laced with alarming bits of pork skin. At Hualamphong there are still alarming bits of pork skin (it’s unfortunately a prerequisite in this dish), but the rice is crispy, tart and flavorful; the best version of this dish I’ve tasted yet. Another winner in the same genre is steamed mushrooms served with chili sauce (70 baht), a simple but delicious dish that features a variety of mushrooms steamed over a broth containing lemongrass, shallots, galingale and basil, and served with a piquant dipping sauce.
 
Slightly less successful are the restaurant’s attempts at southern Thai cuisine. Fried beef with southern-style chili topping (100 baht) employs stringy strips of beef that resembled isaan-style nuea daet diaow, and sadly lacked the requisite savory “dryness” of the original. Another dish with southern roots, spicy fried sataw (a pungent southern-Thai vegetable) with river prawn (150) was a disappointingly mild effort at a dish that is normally very intense. Indeed, much of the food at Hualamphong is somewhat toned town, but when it concerns Thai regional cooking this can be to the diner’s benefit, as it allows one to truly experience the flavors of the often unfamiliar herbs, fish and vegetables.

Another plus about Hualamphong Food Station is the restaurant’s excellent service staff. The waiters are friendly and helpful and appear to be confident about what they do. After several months in its new location, Hualamphong Food Station continues to be a restaurant that celebrates good food, and is one of the few places in town that recognizes the treasure that is Thailand’s regional cooking. And best of all, it’s actually possible to find.

There have been some interesting questions at eGullet lately regarding the different chilies used in Thai cooking. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the chilies used in Thailand, but the five below are by far the most commonly used. I&apos;ve tried to describe what they look like, how they&apos;re used, and their spiciness.

The most commonly used chilies in Thailand are undoubtedly phrik khii noo , literally, &quot;mouse dropping chilies&quot;:
 
These are generally also the hottest chilies in Thailand, and can range from tiny in size (as pictured above), to almost 2-3 time the length shown above. They are used in almost every conceivable way: ground up in curry pastes, smashed up and added to stir fries, smashed up and added to soups or salads, or used in nam phrik , Thai-style &quot;dips&quot;. Dried phrik khii noo are used in curry pastes to add a spicy taste.

Another common kind of chili are phrik chii faa , literally, &quot;pointing at the sky chilies&quot;, apparently for the way they grow:
 
Phrik chii faa generally range from mild to slightly spicy, and come in three colors: green, red, and orange. They are most commonly used as a garnish. They can be sliced into rings and preserved in vinegar as a condiment for noodle dishes, or sliced or julienned and used to garnish curries such as kaeng phanaeng . Sometimes they are used fresh in curry pastes, but this is generally to add color or body, rather than spiciness.

Phrik chii faa are also dried:
 
Dried phrik chii faa are an essential ingredient in most curry pastes, and provide red color and body, although, as mentioned above, not a lot of spice.

Another chile that is most commonly used as a garnish are phrik yuak :
 
These are usually mild, and are almost always the pale green color shown above. Sliced, they can garnish a variety of dishes, and are especially popular in Thai Muslim cuisine, where they are somtimes stuffed with fish and steamed or boiled.

 Phrik karieng: 
 
can at times be the spiciest Thai chilies of all. They are recognized by their yellow and orange colors (although they are normally somewhat shorter than the ones shown above). They are eaten fresh in some northern and northeastern Thai dishes, but are more commonly dried:
 
and ground up to be taken as a conidment with noodle dishes.

 Phrik num: 
 
are almost exclusively associated with the northern Thai dish, nam phrik num . This dish sees the chilies grilled along with shallots, garlic and tomatoes, and then pounded together into a spicy &quot;dip&quot;. The chilies are typically longer than phrik chii faa, and can range in spice from hot to very hot. In northern Thailand, they are often a darker shade of green than shown above.

And finally we have bell peppers, or phrik yak (&quot;giant chilies&quot;):
 
These are virtually only used in stir-fried dishes of chinese origin, and are very mild.

As far as I can tell--and I actually tasted this one--Banana Ham Bun&apos;s only connection to banana is its shape. The inside is filled with a slice of luncheon meat ham, and the top coated with a generous layer of &quot;cheese&quot;, as this close up reveals:
 

However, the thing that shocked me most about the Banana Ham Bun (other than the appalingly bad concept and lack of any banana flavour) was its greasiness. I normally try to handle these breads as little as possible, but in the course of actually consuming a small bit of this one, I actually had to touch it, and my fingers were almost instantly coated with gratuitous Banana Bun grease...

I&apos;m doing a piece on this for ThaiDay and have been fortunate enough to taste the food of, and meet a few of these guys: Jacques and Lourent Pourcel, Gerald Passedat, Pierre Gagnaire, and David Thompson. This being RealThai, the most interesting of these for me was obviously meeting David Thompson, chef of Nahm, the only Michelin-starred Thai restaurant in existence, and the author of the big, fat book Thai Food . Mr Thompson was lovely, as well as extremely knowledgable about Thai food, and we spent a pleasant hour mostly talking about regional Thai dishes. Mr. Thompson also offered some invaluable advice for those of you trying your best to make your name known in the restaurant world and earn that elusive Michelin star: sleep with the reviewer.

 Explore the largley unknown landscape of Burmese cuisine. 

Although the two countries share a long border, a similar religion, and a great deal of history, the relationship between Thailand and Myanmar (Burma) would not be described as amicable. Much of the two countries’ mutual history is one of conflict rather than cooperation, and though some elements of Burmese culture have entered Thailand, the country’s culinary traditions are not one of them. Ask an average Thai what a Burmese eats and you will undoubtedly get a blank stare. Actually, ask just about anybody outside of Myanmar what the Burmese eat, and you will probably get a blank stare. Myanmar’s cuisine, like many other aspects of this secluded country, is largely a mystery to the outside world.

Myanmar cooking, like Thai and the majority of cuisines in the region, is a rice-based cuisine. Rice is seen as the centerpiece of a meal, and other dishes, most commonly curries and soups, are regarded as accompaniments to the rice. Due to the country’s location between Thailand and Bangladesh, Myanmar cuisine is a mixture of South and Southeast Asian cooking styles and ingredients, integrating the dried spices and lentil soups of the subcontinent, and the fish-and-fresh-herbs cuisines of its neighbors to the east. In theory this would seem to imply a vibrant, exotic cuisine, but factors such as poverty, international isolation, and conflict have not allowed the Myanmar food to progress, as has been the case in India or Thailand. Nowadays, food in Myanmar is often more about subsistence than indulgence.

 
A coconut milk-based noodle dish similar to the thai dish &apos;khao soi&apos;.

This doesn’t mean that Burmese food is bad though. At its best Myanmar cooking is hearty, savory and comforting, the same attributes one would attribute to say, Portuguese cuisine. At the opposite extreme, the food can be salty, heavy, and most of all, extraordinarily oily. Curries, a staple of Myanmar cooking, are often served with a thick layer of bright red oil, and this oiliness is usually the first thing that visitors to Myanmar notice about the food. In general however, sour and salty flavors predominate Myanmar cuisine, and the food is significantly more mild that that of Thailand or even India.

If all of this isn’t too off-putting, and you’re willing to try something new, there is a corner of Bangkok where one can sample authentic Burmese cooking. Soi ABAC, off of Ramkhamhaeng Soi 24, is a virtual mini-Yangon, and is home to many Burmese immigrants as well as four restaurants serving a variety of authentic Burmese dishes.

 
Daw Nwe, a respected Burmese chef, cooking at her restaurant in the Ramkhamhaeng area.

I visit Soi ABAC on a Saturday with my former Myanmar language teacher, Daw Than Than Myint, and Burmese student and Myanmar food aficionado, John Parker. We begin our meal at Daw Nwe’s (as is the case in Myanmar, the shops generally don’t have names per se, and are typically named after the owner/cook), according to Daw Than Than Myint, the best Burmese restaurant in the area. When we arrive Daw Nwe had actually closed shop, and was in the process of single handedly preparing a meal for several hundred people for a funeral the next day, but was kind enough to prepare a few bowls of ohn no hkauk hswe for us. This coconut milk-based noodle dish is thought to be the basis for the northern Thai dish, khao soi, and is served every Saturday at Daw Nwe’s restaurant. Served with condiments of sliced limes, sliced shallots, boiled egg, and crispy deep-fried vegetables known as a kyaw, ohn no hkauk hswe is savory but not heavy, and like most Burmese food is mild rather than spicy.

With Daw Than Than Myint acting as a translator, I ask Daw Nwe about Myanmar food, in particular, why Myanmar curries tend to be so oily. “We feel that if we invite a guest or donate food, and the curry isn’t oily, you’ll look stingy,” she explains. I ask her if the Burmese feel that the liberal use of oil contributes to the taste. “When you compare bland food with oily food, the oily food tastes better,” she says. “The oil helps the flavors to mix and taste rich.” For those willing to try more Burmese specialties, on Wednesday and Saturday Daw Nwe makes mohinga, a noodle dish often regarded as Myanmar’s national dish, and on Thursday is dan bauk, the Burmese version of khao mok or briyani.

Across from Daw Nwe’s is Ma Hlaing’s , a good example of the kind of rice and curry shop that one can find all over Myanmar. Inside, a glass case displays a selection of meat and fish-based curries, soups and thoke, Burmese-style “salads” similar to Thai yam. I choose the ma kyi ywet thoke, a salad of tender tamarind leaves. The dish is pleasantly tart from the tamarind leaves but savory from the garlic-infused peanut oil used to bind almost all thoke. I also order a bowl of nga phe lon hin, fish ball curry, a dish I have enjoyed many times in Myanmar. Unlike Thai fish balls, which often have a manufactured taste and texture, Myanmar nga phe lon are made by hand using fresh fish, and are soft and generously flavored with garlic, ginger and other fresh herbs. The fish balls are fried and are served in a oily curry that should be eaten with rice. Ma Hlaing also serves ngapi ye, a potent Myanmar-style “dip” served with rice and fresh vegetables, a dish provided free of charge by virtually all curry shops in Myanmar.

From Ma Hlaing’s we head further down the soi to Ma Che Ma Cho Sain (“Mrs Love and Mrs Sweet’s Shop”). This is another typical rice and curry shop, this time serving a few Myanmar regional dishes. Daw Than Than Myint urges me to try wetha ne ponyegyi, pork sautéed in a paste made from soybeans, a specialty of the Pagan area. The dark appearance of the dish is off-putting, however, the earthy, concentrated taste of the bean paste is not entirely unpleasant. I follow this dish with chin baung ne hmit chin ye, a sour broth of bamboo shoots and roselle leaves. This dish is another favorite of Myanmar curry shops, and features prominent sour and salty flavors and well-cooked vegetables. As we eat, Myanmar music videos play in the background, providing an appropriate soundtrack for our culinary expedition.

 
A fragrant curry of homemade fish balls at Ma Hlaing&apos;s Burmese restaurant.

Our last stop is at the restaurant run by Ko Tayo (“Mr China”), a Myanmar of Indian descent. Ko Tayo serves Indian and Nepalese-influenced Myanmar dishes, and like many of the restaurants in the area, has a small selection of Myanmar food products, cosmetics, and herbal medicines for sale. Having already eaten at three restaurants, my companions are only interested in shopping at this point, and I take the opportunity to order a cup of lephet ye, Burmese tea. The sweet taste of the tea, the bubbly sound of Burmese conversation and the smells of Myanmar food make me feel like I’m back in Yangon—until I remember that I was never very far away to begin with.

To reach the restaurants, go down Soi ABAC past the entrance of the university until you reach a residential area and the first four-way intersection; the restaurants are all located within a short distance of this intersection and are easily recognizable by their Burmese-language signs out front.

 Enjoy upscale Chinese in a subterranean eatery at Siam Paragon.

 Why is it that restaurants feel a need to intimidate us? Take for example the entranceway of the new Crystal Jade Restaurant in the basement of Siam Paragon. Perhaps its design is based on some ancient method of feng shui meant to deter less wealthy diners, but this dark, towering cavern doesn’t exactly say Come, dine with us! Meeting with some friends for the purpose of this review, we met in front of the restaurant at 5:00 on a Saturday afternoon, only to find the place seemingly closed. Given the day and time, we knew the restaurant had to be open, however, I was the only one who dared ventured down the intimidating, cave-like hallway. Wishing I had brought carabeeners and some rope, I plunged in and was eventually able to find somebody who told me that the restaurant didn’t open until 5:30, but that we were welcome to come inside.

 

My first experience with this Singaporean chain of restaurants was at the somewhat less frightening but preposterously named Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao at the Erawan Bangkok. At this informal restaurant, dough is slapped, twisted, pulled and stretched before one’s eyes into what must be some of the most delicious Chinese-style noodle dishes in Bangkok. The atmosphere here is bright and friendly, and to date it’s the only place in town where I’m willing to pay 150 baht for a bowl of noodles. The latest Crystal Jade enterprise specializes in Cantonese cuisine and is a more formal effort: lotsa glass, lotsa bottles of wine, and numerous tanks of semi-live seafood—no kitchen views or slaphappy doughboys here.

We cowered into the lofty but empty marble-and-glass dining room, and took our seats around an immense round table. Our waitress was from Singapore and couldn’t speak Thai, and when asked for her recommendations, did her best to steer us towards some of the pricier dishes (“Do you like lobster?”). I abstained, and dove directly into the interesting list of appetizers: The crispy eel (170 baht) lived up to its name on both fronts, and was coated with a dark sauce suggesting the brininess of soy sauce and the sweetness of tomatoes The smoked pig shank and jellyfish (180 baht) was a bewilderingly bizarre combination on paper that somehow worked well in reality, coupling chilled slices of stuffed pig’s trotter with chilled preserved strips of jellyfish. The crispy beancurd with pepper and salt (130 baht) was no more or less than the name suggests, but reminded me of how delicious simple ingredients can be when prepared the right way.

 
The crispy fried eel.

My dining companions chose the entrees, and the highlight of these was without a doubt the sautéed pork collar with XO sauce (285 baht). The Chinese rightly appreciate fatty cuts of meat, and the paper-thin slices of pork neck were flash fried with chunks of celery and just enough dried chili to rise above the XO sauce (a Chinese flavoring sauce—not the brandy) to make the dish stand out from the others.

 
The pork collar in XO sauce.

Similar in form but not in flavor was sautéed sliced beef with mixed mushrooms (220 baht). The beef was almost ridiculously melt-in-your-mouth tender, but the presence of gelatinous oyster sauce—also evident in some of the other dishes we had ordered—was tedious. Indeed, maybe it was our bad luck in ordering, but much of the food seemed to be of the sticky stir-fry, slimy soup variety that Chinese restaurants outside of China seem incapable of moving away from.

 
Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce.

Smartly avoiding the cornstarch altogether was the excellent steamed garoupa (100 baht/100g), which was just barely cooked, and served with a silky-smooth broth swimming with scallions and laced with hints of sesame oil. We also ordered a few soups, including the “Sichuan” hot and sour soup (120 baht) and the crab claw, bamboo fungus and vegetable soup (200 baht), both again, of the slightly slimy variety, the latter being of the extremely flavorless variety.

Due to the fact that there weren’t many diners, and perhaps realizing that I was doing a restaurant review, there were at least four service staff at our command at all times. This meant that, in the tradition of good Thai service, we were kept thoroughly watered. In the course of our one-hour meal, I consumed enough tea to put the Chinese National Mah Jongg Team to shame.

In the end, our meal certainly did not turn out to be the intimidating experience that we feared, but rather, somehow oddly familiar. The food was probably better than average, but seemed for the most part to be the same dishes we’ve all seen before, but in a sleeker package. Maybe it’s got something to do with the feng shui?

 World-class chefs are in high demand in Bangkok these days. What do the chefs think of their stardom? 

Gerald Passedat appears tired, and rightfully so: just a few days earlier he was probably happily filleting fish in the kitchen of Le Petit Nice, his two Michelin-star restaurant in Marseilles, southern France. Today the chef is in Reflexions, the Plaza Athenee Bangkok’s French restaurant, trying to balance answering the questions of the local press with preparing a six-course meal for more than 30 people. This is Passedat’s first time in Thailand, not traditionally a stopover on the route of Michelin-starred chefs, and he’s obviously trying to make the most of it. “Asia is important for us [chefs],” he explains. “We’ve got to travel and see what’s happening, new types of cooking and ingredients.”

 

Important indeed. This month alone, chefs from no fewer than six Michelin-starred restaurants are paying visits to Bangkok’s top hotel restaurants. From David Thompson, Head Chef of London’s Nahm, the only Thai restaurant ever awarded a Michelin star, to Pierre Gagnaire, Head Chef of the eponymous three-starred Paris restaurant considered by many as one of the finest in the world, Bangkok has seemingly been inundated by this virtual constellation from the culinary stratosphere.

This interest in high-end dining is hardly new however. Bangkok’s first effort in this area began in earnest back in 2000 with the initiation of the World Gourmet Festival. This event brought in chefs from virtually every corner of the world, and was generally considered a critical and financial success. The event has continued to be held every year since, and in late 2005, the concept was taken to an extreme with the Epicurean Masters of the World. This event saw 10 chefs with a total of 19 Michelin stars brought together under one roof—something that rarely occurs even in Europe. The Michelin accolades of the chefs involved were liberally touted during this event, setting a precedence that will be difficult to follow, and perhaps also whetting the appetite of Bangkok diners to crave the occasional star with their meal.

 
The brothers Pourcel prepare their dishes at D&apos;Sens at the Dusit Thani Hotel.

This month’s largely coincidental culinary deluge may well be the result of consumer demand, but it is also an illustration of the current trend for chefs to leave their comfort zones and be exposed to new influences. During this month I was fortunate enough to meet with some of the visiting chefs, and gained some interesting insights regarding Michelin stars, local ingredients, as well as the state of fine dining in Bangkok.

Two chefs who are no strangers to neither Asia nor Michelin stars are twin brothers, Jacques and Laurent Pourcel, of Le Jardin des Senses in Montpellier, France. Established in 1988, their restaurant quickly accumulated praise for its Asian-influenced Mediterranean cuisine, and at one point was awarded three Michelin stars. Since then, the Pourcels have used their acclaim and skills to establish successful restaurants not in the usual suspects of London and New York, but rather in Bangkok, Tokyo, Singapore and Shanghai.

 

Despite their obvious success, the topic of Michelin stars can be a touchy subject for the Pourcel brothers; after having held on to three stars for four years, in 2004 Le Jardin des Sens was downgraded to two, where it still remains today. With this in mind, I visit D’Sens, the restaurant in the Dusit Thani that the Pourcels oversee, and ask brothers what they feel are the negative and positive attributes of running a Michelin-starred restaurant. “The downside is that you’re seen as an “expensive” restaurant,” explains Laurent, “Although now you can find some places in the guide that are reasonable.” Jacques adds, “Nobody knows the judging standards. The system isn’t perfect, but the chefs who receive two stars are generally very good chefs and they deserve it.”

I mention the current flood of high-ranking chefs, and ask the brothers if they think that diners in Bangkok are really ready for such high-level dining. “Thais still expect traditional cuisine,” replies Jacques Pourcel. “They aren’t yet used to modern [cuisine], but there is still time to learn to appreciate new flavors and ingredients.” Ironically, in the case of the Pourcels, many of the “new flavors and ingredients” Jacques speaks of are actually staple ingredients in Thailand: passionfruit, coriander, tamarind and coconut milk are among the ingredients that the Pourcels have seamlessly integrated with traditional French cooking enough to make them unrecognizable even to Thais.

 
Two-star French chef Gerald Passedat.

French Chef Pierre Gagnaire, who is currently in residence at the Oriental’s Le Normandie, has never been to Bangkok before, but it was really only a matter of time. Gagnair is Head Chef of a restaurant in Paris considered among the finest in the world (and firmly clutching three Michelin stars), is the virtual inspiration for an entire school of gastronomy, and is considered by both chefs and diners alike to be among the finest chefs in the world.

Despite all this, Gagnaire is fully conscious of how tenuous culinary fame can be, having experienced a well-publicized financial collapse while running a previous three-starred restaurant. That restaurant folded, but Gagnaire eventually came back—in Paris of all places—and with his current restaurant, Pierre Gagnaire, again holds three stars. I ask Gagnaire if there’s a negative side to having a three-stars. “What’s bad is that you can lose them,” explains the chef. “Say you’ve got a film director, and he wins an Oscar. He can put it on his mantelpiece, it’s his for life,” explains Gagnaire through a translator. “With three stars, you don’t get them for life, you have to fight every day to keep them.”

Gagnaire is certainly willing to fight, and does this by challenging diners with new flavors and textures (he calls them “disturbing minor details” or “multi-sensory hits”). I ask him if he thinks diners in Bangkok are ready for food of this level. “When it’s being done in a sincere and honest way, people don’t need to have a lot of references and knowledge about the cuisine to appreciate it,” explains the chef. However when traveling, Gagnaire admits that he feels less inclined to experiment. “It would be great to do something like a lemongrass infusion, but that’s not what people here want,” he explains.

Of all the chefs currently in town, Australian Chef David Thompson probably has the least enviable job of all: cooking an exclusively Thai meal for diners in Bangkok. This is nothing new to Thompson, who, after virtually stumbling upon Thai food more than twenty years ago, pursued this then-obscure school of cooking, eventually culminating in Nahm, his London restaurant, as of yet the only restaurant specializing in Thai cuisine to have been awarded a Michelin star.

 
Gerald Passedat&apos;s Loup Lucie, sea bass prepared in his grandmother&apos;s style.

Despite the unique accolade, Thompson is tangibly cynical about his star, and when I ask him about the benefits it has brought, he says straight faced, “It gets you into restaurants easily.” After laughing, he continues, “Any cook worth his fish sauce shouldn’t succumb to the idea of doing things for awards,” he explains. “If you start to become preoccupied with what other people think of you, or what awards you might garner, then you start to lose the point of why you’re doing it in the first place.”

I ask Thompson, who is currently in Bangkok preparing his take on Thai food at the Metropolitan Hotel’s cy’an, if he feels that Thais are becoming more sophisticated in their dining tastes. He replies, “I think it’s concomitant with the incredible boom that’s happened in this country, where people are becoming more affluent and wish to display their affluence. Thais have always been a status conscious society, and this is yet another way to display that.”

Despite the media attention and consumer interest, for most hotels, hosting a Michelin-starred chef is not necessarily a profitable venture. “For us it’s a tradition,” explains Konstantino Blokbergen, Director of Food&amp;Beverage of the Oriental Hotel, whose restaurant, Le Normandie, has been hosting three-star chefs for almost 20 years. “But there is a cost associated with it. Financially, we try to break even, but it’s not done to make money. It’s an investment meant to last. It brings customers back.” In any event, it seems an investment that many hotels are willing to make, and with rumours of a possible Michelin Guide to Asia in the air, can also be seen as a sign of greater things to come.

Back at Reflexions, two-star chef, Gerald Passedat is posing for photos and trying his best to look cheerful. Earlier I had a chance to ask him how important getting the third Michelin star is to him. “When you have three [stars] you can open restaurants anywhere in the world and do whatever you want,” he explains. “But naturally, my goal is simply to make the customers happy.” Judging by the reaction from Bangkok’s diners, I would say that Passedat and his colleagues have been, without a doubt, successful in this area.

 Guide to the Guide 
The Guide Michelin, the source of all the stars, and undoubtedly the most influential restaurant guide in the world, started with practical beginnings. Introduced in 1900 by Andre Michelin, head of the eponymous tyre company, the guide was meant to assist motorists by listing lodging and restaurants, as well as provide information on mechanics, garages and bathrooms. In 1923 the guide began to review restaurants independent of accommodation, and in 1926 the star rating system was introduced, in which a star symbol was shown next to restaurants “noted for their fine cuisine”. In the 1930’s the star system was expanded to include the two and three-star system that still exists today.

The Red Guide, as the book is often called, covers 10 countries, mostly in Europe, although there is now a guides for New York City. Although much of the prestige of receiving a Michelin star is often associated with the chef, the prize is actually given to the restaurant, thus it is slightly inaccurate to describe someone as a “Michelin-starred chef”. Of the more than 5,000 restaurants reviewed in the 2004 UK and Ireland Guide alone, only 11 received 2 stars (“excellent cooking, worth a detour”) and 3 received three stars (“exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey”), making the stars very elusive indeed.

Despite the prestige associated with the stars, in recent years Michelin Guide has been subject to a fair amount of controversy. The book is regarded by many as being far too influential, and in 2003 a well-known French chef committed suicide, allegedly due to concerns that his restaurant was to be downgraded by the guide. In 2004 a former Michelin reviewer wrote a book describing the review standards as lax, and the Michelin inspectors are sometimes regarded as having a French bias.

a thick, fish-based broth that is often considered the national dish of Myanmar. The noodles used are similar to the fermented rice noodles known in Thailand as khanom jeen , and the broth fortified with ground fish, shallots/onions, and the edible soft pith from the innermost stalks of the banana tree. In Myanmar this is usually accompanied with the fresh veggies seen in the pic, as well as a kyaw , crsipy deep fried vegetables. Daw Than Than Myint claims this is the best mohinga in Bangkok.

Our Mohinga was taken with wetha lon kyaw , literally &quot;fried pork balls&quot;:

 

ground pork mixed with herbs and spices and deep-fried. They are taken with the spicy/sour dipping sauce seen in the background. Personally, I found this a bit unusual, as the Burmese aren&apos;t real big meat eaters, and I can&apos;t recall having come across any dishes using pork in Myanmar. Perhaps it&apos;s some sort of adaptation made for Thailand?

Michael and friend were passing through Bangkok and we met up for lunch a few days ago. As I&apos;ve done in the past when others have visited, I like taking people to a brilliant Thai Muslim place down near the Oriental Hotel. The restaurant, called (if I remember correctly) Muslim Home Cooking, is relatively new, and specializes in Indian-influenced Thai-Muslim cuisine.

We started with a speciality of Thai Muslim food, fish curry:

 

This Thai Muslim staple sees hearty &quot;steaks&quot; of fish (usually plaa insee , Spanish mackerel) in a thick, sour curry broth. Usually there a few vegetables thrown in for shits and giggles, in this case okra and tomato (sometimes also eggplant or green bananas).

This we followed with mutton spareribs in curry sauce:

 

I&apos;ve never come across this dish in Thailand and assume it is Indian-Muslim in origin. It&apos;s a great dish; we finished every drop of the curry sauce, and really enjoyed the garnish of crispy deep-fried shallots.

As one usually does when eating Thai Muslim we skipped the rice altogether and instead took our curries with the cripy pancakes known as roti: 

 

Other highly recommended dishes here include the khao mok (briyani), which is served with a raita (cucumber-yoghurt mixture), a sweet and sour sauce, and a savory eggplant dish. The restaurant is located virtually across the street from the French Embassy in the Haroon Mosque area.

click on the image Casual readers of RealThai must get the impression I&apos;m noodle obsessed. In fact, I hadn&apos;t hardly eaten noodles at all the first several years I worked here. I always found Thai noodle dishes too sweet, and the various pork/beef/fish balls that seem to accompany such dishes are, for the most part, shockingly nasty. In recent years I&apos;ve opened up a bit and have found a few noodle dishes I really enjoy, including the topic of this entry, kwaytiao khae . I&apos;ve mentioned this particular dish before here and here , and recently noticed a new shop not far from my house selling the stuff. Well, despite it&apos;s rather attractive appearance:

 

this was by far the worst bowl I&apos;ve yet to encounter. If kwaytiao khae was served on board airplanes or in hospitals, this is what it would taste like. The broth was institutional and tasteless, and the various ball products tough, chewy and tasteless.

Khuat didn&apos;t have much better to say about her yen ta fo :

 

When I get a chance, I plan to feature the best kwaytiao khae I&apos;ve had yet, which is sold virtualy on the side of the road in Chinatown. Please be patient.

The food isn&apos;t amazing, but it&apos;s consistently good, and there&apos;s an amazing variety of curries, fried dishes and soups:

 

I tend to order the same things, and here what I had last time I stopped by:

 

At 12:00 is a stir fry of tofu with ground pork and kheun chai , Chinese celery; at 3:00 is kaeng khii lek , a southern-style coconut curry that combines the bitter leaves of the khii lek tree and grilled fish; and at 6:00 phak khanaa kale/chinese broccoli fried with oyster sauce and barbecued crispy pork belly.

click on the image Possibly the most popular restaurant meal among middle-class Thai is suki-yaki, the Japanese hot pot dish that Thai refer to simply as sukii . For those not familiar with the dish, it&apos;s basically a do-it-yourself meal that revolves around a cauldron of boiling broth. You order raw ingredients and cook them in the broth.

Like noodles, this is another one of those dishes that Thai people love that I never really cared for until somewhat recently. I really enjoy it now, as it revolves around my two faves: seafood and veggies, and is about as healthy as it gets.

There are several franchises serving suki in Thailand including MK, Coca and See Fah, but today we tried a new one, called simply, Hot Pot.

We like veggies so we ordered the veggie set:

 

We&apos;ve got phak bung (the long green veggie), green onions, kheun chai (Chinese parsley), carrot slices, daikon slices, a few types of mushrooms, tofu, and in the back, glass noodles. We also ordered a few other, mostly fish-related, side dishes such as squid, fish, fish balls, and fish &quot;noodles&quot;.

This is Khuat taking the first step: pouring the beaten eggs into the broth:

 

When the broth boils again, then we start piling the rest of our ingredients in:

 

Wait a few minutes until they&apos;re cooked, and dig in!

The Thai way to eat this is to take an ingredient out, and dip it in the sauce below before shoving it into the gob:

 

It&apos;s a largely sweetish/sourish sauce with sesame seeds and cilantro, and which is usually accompanied by a separate dish of optional minced garlic, minced chilies and limes to make it really Thai. I think the sauce is just OK, but Thai people really seem to love it. Personally I like to sip the broth, which I imagine is the Japanese way of eating sukii, but which nobody here seems to do.

 

In general, I felt that Hot Pot&apos;s take on the whole thing was very mediocre. It&apos;s really hard to do a bad job of suki--it really just depends on the quality of the ingredients--and in this case the seafood we ordered was obviously past its prime, and the veggies neither attractive nor fresh. Much better in my opinion is Coca, especially considering that they have a half-broth/half-tom yam cauldron, and lotsa fresh veggies and seafood.

click on the image Khok thong (&quot;Golden Mortar&quot;) is the name of a popular isaan (North-Eastern Thai) restaurant near my house. For those of you not familar with ahaan isaan , this cuisine has a lot in common with the food of Laos, just over the Mekong River. This means a lot of grilled dishes, salads and soups, with very little of the Chinese-style fried stuff seen in Bangkok and southern Thailand. Additionally, people in isaan tend to eat glutinous or &quot;sticky&quot; rice with all their meals.

A staple of ahaan isaan is som tam , a type of &quot;salad&quot; made of unripe papaya pounded up in a mortar and pestle usually with green beans, tomatoes, chilies, lime juice, fish sauce, garlic and sugar. Today we ordered tam sua :

 

This is a particular kind of som tam that includes khanom jeen , fermented rice noodles. This may seem an odd combination, but the noodles do a great job of mellowing out the dish, which is typically very spicy. The yellow bits are the peel of ma kok , a kind of sour fruit (I think it&apos;s called Chinese olive, or something similar to that) that adds a tart flavor to the dish. (Ma kok, incidentally, is the origin of the name Bangkok, meaning a plain where lots of ma kok trees are found.) I&apos;d venture to say that right now som tam is probably the most popular food in the country; EVERYBODY loves the stuff, and it can be found on virtually every street corner.

Another isaan favorite is khor moo yaang , &quot;grilled pork neck&quot;:

 

This dish takes the fatty fatty meat (sometimes also known as the &quot;collar&quot;) grilled and typically served with a spicy/sour/salty dip.

Isaan food is always taken with khaao niaow , &quot;sticky rice&quot;:

 

which is eaten with the hands and rolled in a small ball before being dipped in any of the dishes present. The container its served in is known as a katip and is meant to hold the rice while at the same time allowing heat and moisture to escape. Unfortunately most restaurants put the rice in a plastic bag, which really defeats the purpose and often results in a mushy, sticky mess. Fortunately that wasn&apos;t the case today.

And finally we had kaeng om plaa duk :

 

Kaeng om is a type of soup typically revolving around lots of veggies and fresh herbs. This one was loaded with cabbage, lemongrass, basil, and most prominently, dill (known in Thailand as phak chii lao , &quot;Lao cilantro/coriander&quot;). This kaeng om was of the plaa duk, catfish variety.

For the most part, Bangkok is a big ugly intimidating city, but there are some nice corners, views and neighborhoods here and there. This shot is over looking the BTS line, with Lumphini Park on the right, and Bai Yok, Thailand&apos;s tallest building, in the upper left hand corner.

I&apos;m currently doing a piece on restaurants with nice views, so I&apos;ll try to include more pics like this. In terms of views, I would really recommend D&apos;Sens, having nearly 360-degree views over the city from its 23rd-floor cockpit-like dining room. (The restaurant also has the most amazing bathrooms in the city, the men&apos;s urinal being a floor-to-ceiling window that gives one the sensation of literally pissing on the city! Great therapy for those fed up with urban life.)

click on the image Was fortunate enough to have lunch with David Thompson, Head Chef of London&apos;s Nahm , and author of a big fat book on Thai cooking , and his partner, Thanongsak. I first met David when I interviewed him for an article on Michelin-starred chefs visiting Bangkok . We got to talking about Thai food and mentioned that there was a place near my house that makes an excellent khao mok plaa , fish biryani. He was intrigued, and yesterday we finally met up again, this time at the aforementioned restaurant.

The place in question is Yusup (probably a Thai corruption of the Arabic name Yusuf), a Thai-Muslim restaurant located along the Kaset-Nawamin highway in northern Bangkok. I had unknowingly driven past this place literally thousands of times before a friend recommended it to me. After my first visit I soon became a regular customer, and have been wanting to take people there for ages.

David and I started with the requisite khao mok plaa:

 

Not a particularly evocative pic--was focusing more on eating and chatting about Thai food, but you get the idea. For those of you not familar with this dish, biryani , called khao mok in Thai, is rice cooked with spices and meat, which in Thailand is almost always chicken. It&apos;s an amazing concept, but, as David mentioned, never seems to fulfill its potential. Most of the time it&apos;s just rice colored yellow with turmeric (or food coloring) with some crap chicken thrown on it. The good men and women at Yusup however, know what&apos;s going on and load their version with spices, peas, minced carrots and fresh herbs. Other than fish they also have beef, goat, and the ubiquitous chicken versions.

This was accompanied by sup haang wua , oxtail soup:

 

A Thai-Muslim speciality, this soup is both mouth-puckeringly sour (from lime juice and tamarind) and rich (undoubtedly the result of all that marrow and bones), and the oxtail has been slow-stewed until fall-apart tender. Amazing stuff.

Thanongsak wisely ordered something outside of the two dish repertoire that I tend to stick to and chose matsaman nuea , &quot;Muslim&quot; curry with beef with roti , fried dough:

 

I found the matsaman to be one of the best coconut milk-based curries I&apos;ve had in a long time; smooth, not too sweet, savory, and with a pleasant taste of coconut that, oddly enough, isn&apos;t usually found in these curries. The roti, on the other hand, were mediocre--not nearly as crispy and fresh as they should be.

And finally, after all this nosh, David shocked us all by ordering a bowl of kwatiao kaeng , &quot;curry noodles:

 

This is a dish that one rarely sees around, and is more similar to the Malaysian laksa than anything Thai. David mentioned that he liked it the more he ate it:

 

but in the end commented that it could have used a final swirl of coconut cream to smooth it out.

click on the image Found myself in the right part of town at the right time and got my mits on some nice northern-style Thai food today. The right part of town is Viphavadee, the right time lunch, and the right restaurant, Khao Soi Faa Haam. This is actually the name of the most famous khao soi --a northern-style curry noodle dish--restaurant up in Chiang Mai. I was up there about a year ago interviewing the owner for an article on khao soi , when I learned that they also have a branch here in Bangkok, and have been enjoying it on a regular basis. Khao soi is getting a lot of attention recently, with a fun thread at eGullet , and Chubby Hubby also featuring some pics in a recent post .

I went to the restaurant with the obvious desire to have a bowl (or two) of khao soi, but in the time-honored tradition of Thai ill-preparedness, they were temporarily out (it was, after all, 12:30!), and would I mind waiting? This was actually a blessing in disguise, as it allowed me to stray from the well-eaten path and order something different for once. This Something Different was khanom jeen naam ngiaow :

 

The dish is of Shan/Thai Yai origin, and is actually quite similar to a spicy, sour spaghetti. It is made by frying ground pork in curry paste with small, sour tomotoes. Water and pork spareribs are added, and topped with everybody&apos;s favorite, cubes of coagulated chicken blood. This is then served over fermented rice noodles. Possibly the best part of the dish is the deep-fried crispy garlic.I&apos;ve eaten this dish heaps of times--and even make a mean version myself--but this was the first time I&apos;d eaten it here, and I&apos;ll certainly have it again.

By the time I finished my nam ngiaow they were finally done making the khao soi:

 

I usually order beef khao soi, but they were out (!) today, so I had to settle for the chicken. Still very good, but this was probably the richest bowl I&apos;ve ever consumed--I couldn&apos;t even finish all of it!

It&apos;s April here in Bangkok, which is the hottest month. Most of the time spent in my kitchen I&apos;m literally dripping with sweat, so today I decided to make something cool:

 

The red are pieces of chilled watermelon, and the topping an odd but delicous mixture of dried fish, sugar and deep-fried shallots. This is an old-school Thai dessert I first had at David Thompson&apos;s dinner at cy&apos;an. He gave me the recipe, which involves taking plaa chon daed diaow , a kind of semi-dried freshwater fish, and roasting or grilling it until dry. You then pick the flesh apart and grind it up in a mortar and pestle with some sugar. For the shallots you simply thinly slice a bunch of shallots and fry them in oil until they become dark and crispy. Let them drain on several changes of paper towels, mix with the fish mixture, and sprinkle over the watermelon!

Enjoy!

 Spicy, Salty, Sour and Sweet: My Second Taste of Laos (Intermezzo Volume No. 5, Issue 13)

In 1998, as a twenty-year-old junior at the University of Oregon, I received a scholarship to visit Laos with a group of students from various Southeast Asian countries. At that point the country had only recently opened its doors to international tourism, and when I arrived I had the distinct impression that I was somewhere unknown and unvisited by the outside world. Since my college years, I have spent most of my time living and working in Thailand. I have eaten countless amazing Thai dishes, and tasted the foods of nearly every country in Asia. Yet I&apos;m constantly reminded of the food of Laos, and recently decided to revisit the places and tastes that proved to be so eye-opening to me as a student.

 
Tam baak hung, a tart salad of unripe papaya, eggplant and tomatoes, is a favorite meal in Laos. 

What I ate in Laos eight years ago was so unlike anything that I had ever tasted before that it truly grabbed my attention. Several of my culinary experiences still remain vivid to this day, such as my first time eating sticky rice, being faced with an intimidating dish of raw beef laab, and eating a papaya salad so spicy I nearly fainted. Every meal seemed an adventure, the food being both unusual and exciting, and after all this I was shocked when, after arriving home, I heard Lao food brushed off as “like Thai food but less spicy”.

 
 Beer Lao is considered by many to be the best beer in Southeast Asia. 

The food of Laos is based on fresh ingredients and boasts assertive flavors. Being a poor, mountainous, landlocked country has had an impact on the cuisine that makes Lao cuisine completely distinct from its big brother to the West. To begin with, that most important of Asian staples, rice, is in Laos, very different than that of Thailand. Rather than fragrant, long-grained rice, the staple carb of Laotians is short-grained “sticky rice” known as khao niaow. And as Laos is fully landlocked, freshwater fish is an immensely important staple, as is game (including deer, wild birds, lizards and other ahaan paa, or &quot;jungle food&quot;). And that symbol of Chinese culinary imperialism, the wok, has made little inroad in Laos, where much of the food is grilled or prepared in soups rather than fried.

I begin my journey in Vientiane (pronounced “wieng jan”), the capital of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Although it’s only a short bridge crossing over the Mekong River from Thailand, Vientiane feels a world, and a generation away. Upon arrival in the city, one is greeted by crumbling colonial-era villas and towering shade trees, a palpably different experience from the largely characterless, concrete cities of Thailand. Schoolgirls wearing the Lao national costume, a long embroidered skirt called the phaa sin cycle by on bicycles, and monks wrapped in bright orange sweep leaves in front of Buddhist temples. The capital of Laos is essentially a sleepy, dusty town on the banks of the Mekong, undoubtedly how Thailand was a generation ago, and much of the isolation of the past 30 years has served to preserve a culinary heritage that, even today, is still very much intact.

 
 Fresh lemongrass is a common ingredient in Lao cooking. 

Upon arrival in Vientiane, I proceeded directly to the banks of the Mekong River to begin my culinary reeducation by sampling what is undoubtedly the most quintessential of Lao dishes, tam baak hung. Consisting of strips of shredded green, unripe papaya, sliced tomatoes, lime, garlic, and fish sauce all ground together with a mortar and pestle, this tart “salad” is a relatively simple but delicious meal. The deep wooden mortar used to make tam baak hung is ubiquitous in every part of Laos, and is almost always wielded by women. Some cooks pound aggressively, as if punishing the papaya, the mortar and the pestle at once, while others use the mortar and pestle more as mixing tools, gently coaxing the ingredients together. Regardless of how it is done, the bell-like hollow thud that resonates when the dish is being prepared is recognizable enough to make one’s mouth water. One particular element that makes a tam baak hung particularly Lao is the use of chilies. Despite what others may say, the majority of Laotians actually do like their food hot, and I still wince when I recall a dish of tam baak hung I had in 1998 that was so spicy, that after the almost intolerable initial heat, I began to feel an intense chili-induced “high”, and stumbled back to my hotel room in a near-stupor.

The spiciness of chilies is, along with sour, sweet and salty, one of the four essential tastes that makes up Lao cuisine. Sour flavors typically come from the use of lime juice or crushed tamarind pulp, and a dish’s sweet taste might be the result of cane or palm sugar. Saltiness is usually obtained through generous use of paa daek, a mud like, unpasteurized fermented fish sauce essential to Lao cooking. The use of paa daek lends Lao food a certain earthy flavour, not to mention the fact that many Lao people still prefer to eat ahaan paa, game taken from the jungle. Lao food is also earthy in its tones, many of the dishes brown from the use of ingredients such as mushrooms or paa daek, or green from the addition of fresh herbs.

 
 French-style baguettes for sale in Luang Prabang. 

As with most countries in Asia, the staple food of the Lao people is rice. Not fluffy steamed rice, as in the vast majority of Asia, but rather, heavy, glutinous “sticky rice”. This form of rice grows well in Laos’s relatively high mountain valleys, and is prepared by being steamed over boiling water in wicker baskets, rather than by being immersed in water. In Lao households, sticky rice is often prepared in the morning then left in a permeable wicker container for the rest of the day, to be consumed with all meals. This container is known as a katip, and individual serving sizes, often used in restaurants, make good souvenirs. Sticky rice is eaten using the hands, and is rolled into a ping-pong sized ball with the right hand, and dipped into soups and dips. Eating sticky rice in Laos was the first time in my adult life that I had ever eaten entire meals with my hands, and I remember finding it a liberating and delicious experience.

To truly get a feel for Lao food, it helps to see the ingredients in their raw form. This is best done at any of the morning markets that take place every day at nearly every town in Laos. With this in mind, on my second day in Vientiane I wake up early to visit the hectic talaat sao, or morning market. Making my way past piles of lemongrass, pink joints of galingale and neatly bound bunches of dill and coriander, I wander over to the meat section, where entire chickens are on display, and bored-looking vendors shoo flies away from pork meat. Despite being a poor country, the inhabitants of Laos are generally rich with food, and consume meat on a regular basis. Thus, along with tam baak hung and sticky rice, the third essential element of Lao food is ping kai, grilled chicken. Grilled foods rule in Laos, and can range from fish to pork skin, but grilled chicken is the most popular, and arguably the most delicious. Chickens are typically first deboned before being rubbed with a mixture of cilantro root, garlic, turmeric, and salt, and are then splayed on a bamboo rack and grilled over hot coals. The result is smoky and savory, and along with tam baak hung and sticky rice, forms a complete Lao meal.

 

After a few days in Vientiane, I continue my culinary tour by traveling north to the former royal capital of Laos, Luang Prabang. Situated on a finger of land between the Mekong and Khan Rivers, Luang Prabang was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its pristine colonial-era and traditional Lao architecture. The city is one of the most pleasant and atmospheric places in Asia, if not the world, and is also where I had spent the majority of my time in Laos all those years ago.

I was eager to return to the places I had eaten in Luang Prabang, and made a point of making pho, Vietnamese-style noodle soup, my first meal upon arrival. Surprisingly for a landlocked, isolated country, there is a considerable amount of culinary influence from other countries, and pho is an example of this. However, Lao pho, unlike the beef-based Vietnamese original, is typically served with pork or buffalo meat. The soup is served with side of fresh herbs including Thai basil, sawtooth coriander, and the fragrant young mint leaves particular to Laos, as well as limes, pickled vegetables, chili paste, and deep-fried crispy rice cakes. It is this variety of condiments that makes pho such an individual eating experience. Almost instinctively, I added the herbs, squeezed my limes dry, crumbled the rice cake, mixed the soup, and the tart, herblike scent that resulted took me immediately back to my first time in the country.

Laos was part of French Indochina for more than 50 years, and other than Vietnamese food, along with French rule came certain inseparable European culinary traditions, including bread. It was in Luang Prabang where I first came in contact with khao ji, French-style baguette sandwiches that arrived in Laos via the Vietnamese. Using freshly baked bread, khao ji are often consumed at breakfast, the bread somehow always able to stay crisp and flakey despite the humidity, and spread with a variety of ingredients usually revolving around a form of pork-liver pate (no doubt also vestige of French influence) or the ubiquitous Vache Qui Rit cheese spread.

It is a desire for bread and yet another French legacy that impels me to wake up early on my first morning in Luang Prabang. My memory serves as my guide to a ramshackle mélange of benches and chairs known as Pasaneyom Lao Coffee. I am here to sample what must be the most ubiquitous French culinary legacy in Laos, coffee. The Laotians took this unfamiliar product and created their own method of brewing it, pouring hot water through a small baglike filter filled with coffee grinds. The resulting thick liquid is served small tumblers with sweetened condensed milk and followed by a “chaser” of green Chinese tea. The people of Laos also produce coffee, at one point the country’s beans, mostly grown in the southern part of the country, being among the costliest in the world.

 

Another remnant of foreign influence is the country’s beer. Laos is also home to what is considered by many to be the best beer in South East Asia, Beer Lao. Despite formerly being a monopoly (and thus not necessarily obliged to produce a good product), the state-owned Lao Brewing Company produces a fresh-tasting, hoppy lager-style beer, which when served ice-cold on a hot Lao day, is somehow even more refreshing than water. Beer in Laos is typically served with ice cubes, and sometimes, during the sweltering months of summer, bottles of Beer Lao are served wun, meaning that the beer is so cold it has reached a slushy, near frozen state.

While in Luang Prabang I was eager to sample the town’s unique local food, a cuisine that differs substantially from that of the rest of Laos. As in much of the country, the best and sometimes only place to sample local cuisine is at the evening market. Here freshly made curries, soups and salads are dished up to take home along with steaming hot sticky rice. In Luang Prabang, grilled Mekong River fish and ping kai can also be found, as well as a variety of jaew, a kind of chili-based “dip” eaten with sticky rice and vegetables. A particular specialty of Luang Prabang is jaew bong, roasted dried chilies pounded with garlic, shallots and buffalo skin. Jaew bong is traditionally eaten with sticky rice and paper-thin crispy sheets of dried Mekong river weed called khai phaen. After some deliberation, I buy both of these, as well as a bottle of ice-cold Beer Lao, and return to my hotel for a final celebratory meal. The occasion? I have tasted Laos again.

 
 Lao eggplants come in a variety of shapes and colors. 

Recipes:

Khao Niaow
Sticky Rice
Serves 4

In Laos, sticky rice is traditionally steamed in a cone-shaped bamboo basket called a huat The rice is placed over an aluminum pot designed to fit snugly with the huat. If you can find these at an Asian market, go ahead and use them, otherwise this recipe is adapted for use with a two-piece pasta pot.

2 cups Thai sticky rice
5 cups water

1. Soak sticky rice in water for four hours. Drain water and set rice aside.
2. Add water to a pasta pot until it is slightly below the bottom of the strainer. Line the removable strainer with cheesecloth, and add the sticky rice.
3. Insert strainer, tightly replace the lid, and bring water to a boil over high heat. Steam rice for 20 minutes, until grains are soft but firm.
4. When rice is done, remove cheesecloth with rice and open on a countertop, using a wooden spatula to spread the rice out flat, and let sit for five minutes.
5. Keep rice in a permeable container, such as a colander covered with cheesecloth, until needed, and serve warm, or at room temperature.

Tam Baak Hung
Papaya Salad
Serves 4

To shred the papaya, peel the papaya first, then use a cheese grater with large holes. Alternatively, for more hearty slices of papaya, use a sharp knife to dash several lengthwise cuts into the green, unripe papaya, then, using a knife or potato peeler, shave off strands of the papaya. The strips of papaya should be roughly cardboard thick and more or less as wide as a finger. In Laos, tam baak hung is made using a mortar and pestle, but as most people in the West don’t use these tools, this recipe is adapted for use with a sturdy bowl. In terms of seasoning the tam baak hung, in Laos this dish is made to taste, so if you prefer spicy, then add a few more chilies. If you dislike sour, then don’t add all of the lime juice and tamarind pulp. To this extent I have suggested adding only half of the seasoning ingredients initially, then adding the remainder to taste.

1 tablespoon tamarind pulp
5+ Thai chilies
2 cloves of garlic
3 cups shredded unripe papaya
5 cherry tomatoes halved
2 golfball-sized green or yellow Thai eggplants
1 tablespoon lime juice
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon of palm sugar (or white sugar)

1. Prepare tamarind by mashing the pulp up with 1/4 cup of warm water. Strain the resulting liquid and set aside.
2. Roughly chop chilies and garlic and smash with the broad side of a knife.
3. In a large bowl insert chili and garlic mixture and the shredded papaya and tomatoes. Slice the Thai eggplant directly into the bowl, and mix and grind all the ingredients using the bottom of a large wooden spoon, for about 20 seconds. The idea here is to gently bruise the papaya so that the other flavors will penetrate.
4. Add half of the tamarind, lime juice, fish sauce and sugar, and grind again. Taste for a balance of spicy, sour, sweet and salt, and add additional lime juice, fish sauce or sugar as needed.
5. Serve immediately with sticky rice.

Ping Kai
Lao-Style Grilled Chicken
Serves 4

In Laos entire chickens are typically deboned and splayed on bamboo racks before being grilled. For simplicity this recipe uses a whole chicken that has been jointed. Another option would be to use six chicken thighs.

1 chicken, jointed and cut into parts
2 tablespoons of salt
3 tablespoons of chopped cilantro roots
1/2 tablespoon peppercorns
4 tablespoons of chopped garlic
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon fish sauce

1. Rub chicken parts with salt and set aside for 20 minutes to draw out any unpleasant juices.
2. In the meantime, using a mortar and pestle or food processor, finely grind cilantro roots, peppercorn, garlic and turmeric powder until a thick paste results. Stir in fish sauce.
3. Wash chicken pieces, pat dry, and coat with the paste. The previous steps can be done the day before and the chicken left to marinade in the paste overnight. Otherwise allow chicken to marinade in the paste at least 30 minutes before grilling.
4. Grill over a well-oiled grill on medium heat, turning every 10 minutes, until finished.

This particular bad boy is located in the Or Tor Kor Market compound and is known for its kai yaang (grilled chicken), as the name suggests. We consumed this dish, but the shop was dark and the pic was crap, so I&apos;ve decided not to include it here.

Other things we ate were tom saeb :

 

This is a sour/spicy soup popular in the NE of Thailand. &quot;Saep&quot; means spicy and sour at the same time, and this soup was deliciously tart. This one was based on tender pork joints, and had the unsual addition of lettuce and chinese celery in the broth.

We followed this with tam sua :

 

This is an isaan-style som tam , or papaya salad, with the addition of fermented rice noodles. The black bits are pickled field crabs; they are crushed up with the papaya in the mortar and pestle used to make the dish and are a very common ingredient, added more for flavor than anything else.

For the kid we ordered tam poo :

 

This is a milder, central-style papaya salad with crab and cashews. We told them to make it palatable for a kid, not spicy, and the result was sweet enough to be a dessert. I couldn&apos;t eat it but Nong Paeng liked it.

This is her demonstrating the proper way to eat sticky rice, ie., with the fingers:

 

One more thing worth mentioning about this place it&apos;s also probably the loudest restaurant I&apos;ve ever eaten at. The staff are terribly unorganized and compensate by screaming orders at each other. It&apos;s really quite unbelievable, both in terms of volume and also in terms of what people are willing to subject themselves to in order to eat good food!

Tracing the roots of Portugal&apos;s influence on Thai cuisine. 

I have some news for you: the green curry you ate last night is really a Portuguese dish. And your favorite som tam? Portuguese as well. Fancy a glass of cha dam yen, Thai-style iced tea? You have Vasco da Gama to thank for that. Well, OK, I’m exaggerating a bit, but it is essentially true that none of the above Thai dishes would have been possible without the help of the Portuguese.

This is because many of the ingredients and dishes that we consider Thai are actually fairly recent culinary introductions, a result of the influence of Portuguese traders and missionaries who visited Thailand starting in the 16th century. This 500-year-old exchange of produce and ideas had a profound impact on Thai food, and largely contributed to defining the cuisine we are familiar with today.

 
 The area surrounding the Santa Cruz Church was once home to a community of Portuguese settlers. 

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit Thailand, having arrived at the former royal capital of Ayuthaya in 1511. Establishing friendly relations with the court of King Ramathibodi II, the Portuguese were quick to take the exciting new products coming from the Americas and market them in Thailand. Thus saw the introduction of such modern-day Thai staples as tomatoes, potatoes, corn, lettuce, cabbage, chilies, papaya, custard apples, guava, pineapples, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, cashews, peanuts, and tobacco. Today these ingredients have been integrated to such an extent that their origin is largely forgotten, and few Thais are aware that their beloved chilies, for example, are actually a non-native species.

The Portuguese were also responsible for bringing products from other parts of Asia to Thailand, such as cinnamon from Sri Lanka and nutmeg and cloves from Indonesia. Perhaps the most significant example of this inter-Asian commerce was the trade of a simple leaf known in an obscure southern Chinese dialect as te: tea. The Portuguese brought tea from China and introduced it to Thailand and much of the rest of Asia, and were also largely responsible for popularizing the drink in Europe.

 
 A great deal of the produce that Thais use on a daily basis are actually fairly recent introductions courtesy of Portuguese traders. 

Other than introducing a new variety of raw ingredients, the Portuguese also had an impact on the way Thais cooked. This influence is most clearly seen in the area of khanom, sweets. In fact, Thai history claims that much of the Portuguese influence on Thai sweets can be traced back to a single person: Marie Guimar, the mixed-race Portuguese wife of Constantine Phaulkon, Greek explorer and high-ranking minister of King Narai. Guimar had a strong influence on the kitchen of the royal household, and by introducing the concept of baking and the use of ingredients such as egg yolks and flour—methods and elements unknown in Thailand but integral to Portuguese dessert making—she had an impact on Thai desserts that can still be seen today.

One of the most obvious examples of the Portuguese influence on Thai sweets can be seen in the numerous desserts that share the Thai word for gold, thong, a reference to the yellow/orange color imparted by the liberal use of egg yolks. These desserts include thong ek, thong yawt, thong yip, and foy thong, and are all variants of a family of Portuguese desserts known as ovos moles. Despite the passing of a half-century since their introduction, many of these sweets are still similar in form to desserts that can be found in Portugal to this day. To learn more about the production and origin of these desserts, I paid a visit to the factory of Kanomthai Kao Peenong, the largest producer of Thai sweets in the country.

 
 Thong yawt. 

I am given a tour of the factory byArin Pipattawatchai, Kao Peenong’s head of quality control, and an expert in the production of Thai sweets. She explains that all of Kao Peenong sweets are made by hand, still employing the same methods that were introduced by the Portuguese nearly 500 years ago. In the case of the Portuguese-influenced thong sweets, this process typically involves immersing duck-egg yolk combined with various other ingredients in simmering syrup. “For Thai people in the past, eggs were dinner food—they weren’t used for sweets,” explains Pipattawatchai. “This concept was introduced by the Portuguese.” We watch the production of thong yawt, made by dropping a thick paste of duck eggs, coconut milk and jasmine-scented flour into boiling syrup, resulting in firm, bright yellow balls that are both sweet and fragrant. The process for thong yip is similar, however the still-warm golden disks are pressed into small ceramic bowls to obtain their flower-like shape. The most interesting process of all is that of foy thong, whereby egg yolks are streamed into simmering syrup through a fine sieve, resulting in delicate, golden ‘noodles’ of egg yolk.

 
 Making thong yip at Kanomthai Kao Peenong. 

Another example of the Portuguese influence on Thai sweets can be found alongside the Chao Phraya River in Thonburi, in the neighborhood surrounding the Santa Cruz Church. This area was allocated to Portuguese and French traders when the capital of Thailand was moved from Ayutthaya to Thonburi, and is today known for khanom farang kutii jiin, a cake of Portuguese origin. The cake, a simple mixture of duck eggs, sugar and flour, is prepared by an improvised method of baking, which employs a bottom layer of heated gravel and a top layer of hot coals to simulate the effect of an oven, a kitchen tool not found in Thailand during the Ayuthaya era.

 
 Along with food, the Portuguese also introduced Christianity to Thailand. 

To learn more about this unique sweet, I pay a visit to Thanusingh, a family bakery that has been making khanom farang kutii jiin in the shadow of Santa Cruz Church for more than 200 years. Pong, a fifth-generation baker, and Thai of mixed European and Japanese descent, is one of the few people in Thailand still making this dessert, and explains how every effort is made to preserve the original recipe and methods. “The Portuguese tourists who come here recognize the cakes immediately,” explains Khun Pong of the sweet that has changed little in several centuries.

 
 Khanom farang kutii jiin fresh from the oven. 

To make khanom farang kutii jiin, duck eggs and sugar are beat at a very high speed until slightly stiff and peaked. Formerly this was done by hand using an improvised pulley system turning a wooden paddle, but today modern electric blenders do the job. Flour is then carefully folded in, and the mixture is poured into small hand-made metal trays. These are then baked in a modern, custom-made oven that recreates the effect of the original method of employing a bed of heated gravel topped with hot coals. When the cakes are done, I try a hot one, and find the cake dry and generally unremarkable, but to Ayuthaya-era Thais not familiar with bread or sweets, it must have been nothing short of a culinary revolution.

 
 Khanom farang kutii jiin, a Thai snack of Portuguese origin, are still made using traditional methods. 

Khun Pong goes on to mention that the Santa Cruz Church area is also known for other dishes almost certainly of Portuguese origin, including a dish of a roasted calf’s leg inserted with dried spices, and a hearty vegetable stew probably with origins in the Portuguese cozido, both of which are typically are only made during Catholic festivals nowadays. Portugal’s influence on Thai cooking is a unique culinary heritage, the result of a centuries old cultural exchange, that is both thriving, and in danger of dying out.

click on the image This is a street in Bangkok that is particularly known for its street food. Every night at about 7:00 vendors push their carts out to the intersection with Sukhumvit and the hungry follow them there. The area has been well known for ages, but I get the feeling that it might be in the process of becoming a Tourist Attraction, as there were quite a few lost-looking foreigners clutching guidebooks, and the prices on some dishes were substantially higher than usual. I must admit that I&apos;ve only recently discovered this area; I live on virtually the opposite end of Bangkok and don&apos;t tend to eat Thai food outside of my area too often. However, I&apos;m looking into moving--possibly to this street--and the added benefit of good street food might make it an easy decision!

Here&apos;s a view of the street from the Thong Lor BTS station:

click on the image This is the odd name of a Vietnamese restaurant near my house. We&apos;ve passed by it several times, but never ate there until today. I think it&apos;s a chain, and features the kind of uninspiring interior that one would expect from such a place, but the food was actually pretty good, if a bit overpriced. I like Vietnamese food, but in Thailand, it almost always tends to be the same 5-6 staples dishes on offer, usually of virtually the same quality and style. Would be nice to find an authentic, no-frills Vietnamese place in Bangkok with some different dishes.

We started with khanom beuang yuan :

 

The thin, crispy &quot;pancake&quot; is filled with ground pork, minced shrimp, firm tofu and beansprouts. Most Thai just pour the sauce over it and go at it with a spoon and fork, but I like to eat it Vietnamese style, which means rolling bits of it up with the provided fresh herbs (mind, coriander, etc.) and sauce in lettuce leaves and eating with your hands.

We also had muu yaang , grilled pork with a side of fermented rice noodles and crispy garlic:

 

Not bad at all--the pork was marinated before being grilled, and despite being quite try, was pretty tasty. A bit too meaty for this wannabe veggie though.

The best dish of the day was poh pia thawt , deep-fried spring rolls:

 

I almost feel a bit embarrased ordering spring rolls--they&apos;re a bit of a foreigner cliche in Thailand, but these were by far the best I&apos;ve had in a very long time; crispy, hot and made to order, and generously filled with savory/sour fermented ground pork, glass noodles, mushrooms and some crispy vegetable that I forgot to identify. We ordered two plates of this. We also ordered pho, Vietnamese noodle soup, which was very bland and not worth showing here. I&apos;ve had pho a few times in Thailand and for some reason the Thais cannot do this dish any justice. All in all a nice lunch, but probably not worth the cost (believe it or not, $11 is a substantial amount for lunch for two in Thailand!).

 Koh Kret - a time capsule for long lost treats. 

In recent years Western fast food has had an immense impact on the eating habits of the people of Thailand. Rarely do Thais crave such traditional snacks such as miang kham, wild tea leaf ‘packages’ filled with fresh herbs, or kai sarong, savory balls of chicken wrapped in noodles and deep-fried. Today, most Thais would probably rather buy a bag of chips at one of countless 7-11’s, or fried chicken at a nearby KFC. This drastic change in diet and the resulting homogenization of a once diverse cuisine means that many traditional recipes stand the risk of being lost forever.

 
 Thod man nor ka laa, deep-fried battered herbs and flowers that are a speciality of Koh Kret. 

Thankfully there are a few places in Thailand that have chosen to preserve this rich culinary heritage. Once such place is the island of Koh Kret in Nonthaburi province, north of Bangkok. This ‘island’ is actually the result of a canal dredged to shorten an oxbow bend in the Chao Phraya River nearly 300 years ago. The area is also home to a community of Mon people that have lived in the area since the capital of Thailand was moved to Thonburi from Ayuthaya, and today Koh Kret is a stronghold of Mon culture in Thailand. This, coupled with the island’s relative isolation, have made it an excellent place to sample the obscure but delicious food of the Mon people, as well as a variety of old fashioned central Thai fare.

 
 Koh Kret is known for its pottery, which is often used to serve coffee and other drinks. 

To experience these diverse tastes, I paid a visit to the island on a recent Sunday. Koh Kret is an extremely popular destination on weekends, when urban Thais come in droves to eat and shop, and the day I visited was no exception. I boarded a very crowded boat at Wat Sanaam Nuea for the brief ride across the Chao Phraya River and set off to explore the culinary possibilities of this tiny man-made island.

Virtually the first thing one encounters after disembarking from the boat, and probably the commonest dish on Koh Kret, is a snack of Mon origin known as thod man nor ka laa. Thot man usually refers to a dish of deep-fried patties of ground fish, however this particular version consists of various fresh herbs, colorful flowers, mushrooms and nor kalaa, an aquatic vegetable, battered, deep-fried until crispy, and served with a sweet and sour sauce. The result is both delicious and attractive, particularly considering the rare pleasure of eating such colorful flowers. The thot man nor ka laa are, like many other dishes on Koh Kret, served in traditional banana-leaf cups called krathong, although nowadays the krathong are held together by a staple, rather than the bamboo toothpick of the past.

 
 Khanom bueang, an old-fashioned Thai sweet. 

A variety of Mon dishes are can be found on Koh Kret, including khanom jeen, fermented rice noodles eaten with a variety of different curries, and the rice dish known as khao chae. The latter is an improbable but delicious combination of camphor-scented rice in chilled water with savory tidbits, and is particularly popular during the Thai summer, as it is considered to have cooling properties. I stop by Khao Chae Khun Daeng, probably the most popular of the numerous khao chae restaurants on the island, and am given the requisite rice along with a dish of candied strips of daikon coupled with savory dried pork. The odd combination of sweet and savory somehow works, and the coolness of the rice leaves me feeling refreshed and ready to continue my culinary tour.

Other than Mon food, Ko Kret is also known for its khanom, sweets, and khong waang, savory/sweet snacks, and most visitors to the island leave clutching bagfuls of both. This wealth of sweet food is due to the fact that sugar palms grow very well in the fertile soil of the riverbank, thus supplying the people in the area with ample raw materials. Many of the sweets sold on Koh Kret are of high quality, but are generally easy to find on the mainland, and much more interesting are the khong waang, many of which are rarely made or eaten nowadays. These include miang kham, wild tea leaves topped with a do-it-yourself mixture of fresh herbs and a thick, savory/sweet sauce, and pan sip, tiny deep-fried “turnovers” filled with a mixture of shredded fish, ground peanuts and black pepper. Another delicious snack one rarely sees nowadays is kai sarong, minced chicken wrapped in egg noodles and deep fried, resulting in crispy golden balls.

 
 Koh Kret is home to a variety of old-fashioned snacks, such as these griddled quail eggs. 

This emphasis on antiquated food extends to meals too, and many of the restaurants on Koh Kret specialize in dishes that have fallen out of favor. Driven by the intense heat of midday, I stop for lunch at a such a curry stall where I order phat phrik khing, long beans fried with pork and a sweetish curry paste, and kaeng phet, a coconut-milk curry, in this case made with pork and hearty chunks of pumpkin. Another old-school Thai dish available on Koh Kret is a soupy curry known as kaeng bon. Similar to the central Thai favorite kaeng som, kaeng bon differs in that it includes kaffir lime zest and krachaay, an indigenous root similar to ginger, added to the curry paste. The curry is thicker than that of kaeng som, the result of the addition of the pounded flesh of grilled fish.

Koh Kret is a fertile island, and during the course of the day I see numerous vendors selling the various agricultural products grown on the island. I was delighted to see that many of these were indigenous Thai fruits and vegetables, such as kaffir limes, buap (a kind of gourd), tam lueng (a leafy vine) and fresh herbs, such as Thai basil, cha om (a pungent leafy herb) and the aforementioned nor ka laa.

 
 Enjoying lunch near the Chao Phraya River, Koh Kret. 
 
By the time I come to the end of my culinary tour it is late afternoon and the crowds on Koh Kret seem to only be getting larger. I decide to leave, but first I indulge in a particular specialty of Koh Kret: freshly brewed coffee. Countless stalls selling coffee prepared the old-fashioned way dot the island, and as Koh Kret is also known for its pottery, the drinks are served in large clay cups produced on the island. As I sit enjoying an iced coffee among the throngs of visitors, I’m reminded that in many cases, tourism is often a destructive phenomenon. However in the case of Koh Kret, tourism has given the locals incentive to continue culinary traditions that might otherwise have died out, something that left a very good taste in my mouth.

click on the image Was downtown yesterday and decided to stop by another well known food street, Silom Soi 20. Although not as well known or expansive as Sukhumvit Soi 38 , this street also seems to get its fair share of both hungry Thais and sunburnt whiteys. The street is in what must be one of Bangkok&apos;s most multi-cultural areas, with a great deal of people of Chinese origin, a popular mosque, a very large Hindu temple across the street and even a sizeable Burmese population.

Here&apos;s a view of the street:

 

You can see the spire of the mosque in the background, and some Muslim dishes are sold there, and keeping with the multi-culturality of it all, a Chinese guy selling pork just accross the street!

The majority of the food on Soi 20 is Chinese-style, which means lotsa frying:

 

So with this in mind I started out with a dish of phat see ew :

 

It was too dark inside the shop to photograph the dish, but it was nothing special. Hardly a tick on the bum of this phat see ew near my home, and I needed to add about six tablespoons of fish sauce to make it taste like anything.

In general the street seems to sell more fruit than cooked food, as can be seen here:

 

For those too lazy to peel their own, here&apos;s a close of up a fruit cart that can be found in virtually every corner of Bangkok:

 

And some fresh durian sold near the Silom end:

 

On my way out I noticed a new restaurant across the way on Silom. The restaurant was called Roti Yummy and specializes, as the name suggests, in roti, a kind of fried &quot;pancake&quot;, normally associated with Thai-Muslim food. I was excited about this, as roti with curry is one of my favorite dishes. I stopped by and ordered plain roti and a bowl of kaeng karii kai , Muslim-style chicken curry...

 

...and was rapidly disappointed. The roti was OK; hot and crispy in the right places, but the curry was bland and stodgy; a big fat brown bowl of mush. With a corny name like Roti Yummy I should have known better.

Yen ta fo, for those of you who have been living under a rock, is a Chinese noodle dish that is probably the most popular of all noodle dishes in Thailand, and has been mentioned previously here . A friend of mine was invited to take part in this contest--not necessarily because of his competitive eating skills--but rather because he was invited by the owner of the chain of yen ta fo restaurants who apparently needed a Token White Guy! The contest was sponsored by the well-known noodle restaurant, Yen Ta Fo Khrueng Song , owned by Ajaan Mallika , who also works at the school my friend works at.

Anyway, this is Kelly being introduced by two extremely perky TV hosts:

 

And no, he doesn&apos;t normally wear the apron and hat.

There were eight contenstants, and they had one hour to eat as many bowls of yen ta fo as possible.

 

One important ingredient in yen ta fo is a big fat cube of coagulated pork blood:

 

And lest you think eating a bunch of noodles looks easy, I should mention that the contestants had to eat the rot jep , &quot;searing taste&quot; noodles, with an almost obscene amount of chilis, as illustrated below:

 

This young man hiding behind a stack of consumed bowls is the eventual winner:

 

Here&apos;s last year&apos;s winner, who this year came in nearly last:

 

However it was Kelly who eventually did come in last... He was able to eat only six bowls, whereas the winner, a skinny university student, ate 12 bowls!

 

After the contest, everybody was given a popsicle, which I thought was a bit odd. When Kelly emerged several minutes later he said that the reason for this was so that everybody could use it to facilitate vomiting! He said backstage was a mess--not something I want to reflect on...

click on the image Today was definately a theme day: khanom jeen . These are noodles made from fermented rice involving a very unique process. I was able to see this firsthand a couple of years ago in Sangkhlaburi, a small town on the Thai-Burmese border. The name khanom jeen includes the Thai word for Chinese, jeen , which causes many people to think the noodles come from China. However khanom jeen are actually Mon in origin, and as Sangkhlaburi is home to many Mon people, this was an excellent place to see the noodles being made.

The first step involves mixing rice with water. When this mixture is sufficiently soft and slightly fermented, it is boiled, blended and poured through a seive into boiling water:

 

The mixture solidifies in the water resulting in thin, white noodles, which are immediately stacked:

 

and sold or consumed, as they tend to spoil quickly.

Back to the present--I&apos;m making an effort to try new places, and the restaurant we visited today, despite being very close to my house, is the kind of place one passes by but never stops at. Well, today we stopped, and it was well worth it.

The first dish I ordered was khanom jeen kaeng khiaow waan look chin plaa kraay (whew!), fermented rice noodles topped with green curry and fish balls made from plaa kraay , a type of freshwater fish:

 

I assume most of you are already familiar with green curry, but this a particular variant that is typically taken with khanom jeen. The green curry is given some life with slivers of kra chaay , an indegenous root herb somewhat similar to ginger. An authentic recipe for this exact curry can be found here at Chez Pim.

The curry was excellent--one of the best green curries I&apos;ve had in ages--not nearly as watery as most of the &quot;green curry&quot; peddled around Bangkok nowadays. I wasn&apos;t so hot about the fish balls (too rubbery), although Khuat liked them:

 

(Please note that one does not usually employ chopsticks when eating khanom jeen---she had ordered noodles, saw how delicious my dish looked, and changed her order!)

Being thoroughly impressed with the food at this shop, I ventured further into the world of khanom jeen and ordered a dish of naam yaa :

 

This is a coconut milk-based curry, this time featuring pureed fish, that is only eaten with khanom jeen. This dish was just as good as the first one--especially considering that it is usually to sweet for me. It also included a generous amount of kra chaay, which gives the dish a simultaneous cooling/spicy flavour!

Upon ordering this dish, I was given a dish of raw veggies to eat with the noodles:

 

Starting from the bottom and moving clockwise we have shredded cabbage, pickled mustard greens, green beans, parboiled bitter gourd, bean sprouts, and in the center, bai menglak , an herb that has the unfortunate English name, hairy basil. You simply take what you like and mix it up with the noodles and curry.

And as if this wasn&apos;t enough khanom jeen, I had another plate at home when I took a pic of khanom jeen naam yaa pak tai , khanom jeen with a spicy southern Thai-style curry for my cookbook on southern Thai food:

 

I made this one myself, and it is topped with some exotic fresh herbs I picked up at the southern Thai place down the street. This particular curry is, like naam yaa, only eaten with khanom jeen, however it is much, much more spicy, requiring something like 50 dried chilies its chili paste!

 Lifting the lid off &apos;khao mok,&apos; a popular Thai variant of a world-famous dish. 

I can still recall a conversation I had with a friend before visiting Thailand for the first time. We were sharing what precious little we knew about the country, and he was enthusiastically going on about how much he loved Thai food, “Especially that peanut sauce,” he said, mentioning the famous accompaniment to sate. As is the case with many Americans, and indeed, many Thais, neither of us was aware that several of the dishes one associates with Thai cooking are actually Muslim in origin.

Although Muslims form less than 5% of Thailand’s population, they have nonetheless had an immense influence on Thai food. Popular dishes such as sate, grilled skewers of meat served with the aforementioned peanut sauce, the fried ‘pancakes’ known as roti, and perhaps the most lauded Thai curry of all, kaeng masaman (literally ‘Muslim curry’) are all Muslim in origin, having been brought to Thailand by Muslim traders several hundred years ago. Thai-Muslim food is generally characterized by the use of dried (as opposed to fresh) spices, and many dishes tend to be quite sweet and savory, rather than spicy. Thai-Muslim food is, like other Muslim cuisines around the world, largely meat-based, and dishes must be halal, meaning that cooks must follow certain religious precepts regarding the slaughter of meat, and the avoidance of pork and alcohol, among other things.

One of the most common Thai dishes of Muslim origin, and a dish that combines nearly all of the elements above, is the spiced rice dish is known in English as biryani. The dish is thought to have its origins in India, and variations can be found around the world, ranging from the Central Asian pilaf and the Indian biryani, to the more distant Spanish paella and the jambalaya of New Orleans. Thai biryani, called khao mok (literally meaning ‘buried rice’) is known for its bright yellow color, a result of the use of turmeric, and is typically served with chicken that has been cooked in the rice, along with sides of sliced cucumbers and a sweet and sour sauce. Formerly a dish associated with Muslims, khao mok is today made by Buddhist Thais as well, and can be found in virtually every part of the country.

 
 A dish of khao mok , a Thai version of the Indian dish, biryani. 

Despite its ubiquity, khao mok is a notoriously difficult dish to make, and is almost exclusively eaten in restaurants. I was curious to learn more about the making and the history of this unique dish, and was fortunate enough to share this interest with David Thompson, the Head Chef of London’s Nahm, the Michelin-starred restaurant that is arguably the most acclaimed restaurant in the world serving Thai food. Mr. Thompson is currently in Bangkok working on a Thai cookbook, his second, and was also interested in learning more about khao mok.

We begin our research at Yusup, a popular Muslim restaurant located along the Kaset-Nawamin highway, north of Bangkok. The restaurant’s near-perfect khao mok is its major draw, and includes versions made with beef, goat and the standard chicken, as well a version made with fish. It is this unusual latter take on the dish that interested David and me, and we asked if the shop would be willing to show us how to make khao mok plaa, fish biryani. They agreed, and a couple weeks later, accompanied by David and his partner Thanongsak, I met with the restaurant’s owner and namesake, Yusup at the newest branch of his restaurant in Bang Na.

Before going directly into the cooking, we began with a meal of several Thai-Muslim specialties including sup hang wua, a deliciously sour broth of oxtails; kurma kai, a thick curry of chicken that, as Thompson points out, is also Indian in origin; kaeng karii kai, a watery coconut milk and dried spice-based chicken curry; and of course, khao mok plaa. As a side we were also given a small bowl of ajaad, a condiment consisting of sliced cucumbers and chilies in a mixture of syrup and vinegar, that, as Thanongsak suggested, did an excellent job of cutting through the predominately heavy and oily main dishes.

 
 Ajaad is a common condiment in Thai-Muslim cooking. 

Moving to an improvised kitchen, Yusup began his cooking demonstration by sautéing a thick curry paste in a large pot. “You have to fry it until it is almost burnt,” he explains. “Otherwise it won’t taste good.” When I ask what the ingredients are, he says sheepishly that this is his “secret”, and admits only to the use of milk and dried spices. Thompson, intrigued by this, tastes and smells the mixture, giving me his take on the ingredients (“There’s definitely some cardamom in there, something sour, maybe vinegar…”). Yusup reveals only that most of the ingredients he uses are available in Thailand, and that some have to be ordered from Egypt. He continues by adding chopped tomatoes and coriander, and additional dried spices, stirring the mixture with a giant wooden paddle.

I ask Yusup about his cooking background and he relates simply that he “loves making food.” He confesses to being largely self-taught, having learned mostly from books and trial and error, and claims that it took him more than two years of experimentation to reach a khao mok recipe that he was satisfied with. While he is talking he adds a small amount of chicken broth to the mixture, followed by several hearty steaks of plaa insee, Spanish mackerel. He closes the lid, and moves to another large pot of boiling water. Into this he adds several cups of rice, a handful of lentils and some dried spices. He explains that he is going to par-boil the rice before adding it to the curry paste and fish mixture. “This is my own step,” explains Yusup, “Others don’t do this, and this is part of what makes my khao mok different.” Thompson explains to me that this step leaves the rice half-cooked, with a translucent exterior and solid core—perfect for absorbing more spices, yet able to avoid becoming soggy.

When the rice is ready, Yusup strains it from the water and adds it to the curry paste mixture, which by now how has reduced considerably. “You have to do this step quickly, or else the rice will overcook,” he explains. He drizzles the rice with melted butter and deep-fried shallots and replaces the lid. “When steam starts coming out, that means it’s done,” he explains confidently. After only a few minutes steam does start emerging from the pot, and it is as this point that Yusup removes the lid and declares the khao mok done. I glance into the pot and am surprised to see that the rice hasn’t yet obtained its characteristic yellow color. Yusup carefully removes the fish steaks, and using the paddle, gently stirs the rice, which has the effect of turning the entire mixture yellow. He tastes the khao mok, and his excitement is almost tangible. “Wow!” he exclaims calling his staff over to smell and taste the result, “This is even better than the stuff we usually make!”

 
 Michelin-starred chef David Thompson turns to restauranteur Yusup to learn the secret of his delicious khao mok.

We sit down to eat this still-warm khao mok, and it is indeed sublime; hearty and fragrant enough to be eaten on its own without the traditional sauce. “This is a dish that’s always disappointed me until now,” explains Thompson, going on to describe how khao mok is too often simply rice adulterated with copious turmeric and topped with rubbery fried chicken. Yusup’s khao mok plaa has seemingly inspired Thompson, who is thinking out loud about the possibility of a khao mok with lobster. Perhaps it is only a matter of time until diners at one of London’s finest restaurants are greeted by a dish of Muslim origin with a long history and a particularly yellow hue.

Yusup is located along the Kaset-Nawamin Highway (known to taxi drivers as sen tat mai, the ‘new road’), in Bangkok’s Bang Khen district. The shop is on the left-hand side before the first stop light.

 What&apos;s the quickest way to South India? Families converge on a fast-food favorite. 

I had been eating at Komala’s, a Singapore-based Indian restaurant on Sukhumvit Soi 20, since it opened in 2002, and always harbored suspicions that the food was good. My hunch was confirmed when the food and beverage manager of a five-star Bangkok hotel—himself a native Indian and former chef—mentioned to me that Kormala’s was his favorite Indian restaurant in town. This is all it took for me to go back to the restaurant with an even more critical view.

Do keep in mind that in the case of Komala’s, restaurant is a loose term. Specializing in southern Indian style vegetarian cuisine, Komala’s is a self-confessed peddler of fast food. But, please don’t run away just yet. As one would expect from a fast food joint, the emphasis on value (is this necessarily a bad thing?), and few of the restaurant’s dishes cost more than 100 baht. Unfortunately, this frugality is also manifest in the restaurant’s interior, which seems to share the same design sensibilities as McDonald’s (plastic molded chairs, an overabundance of counters, reckless use of teal), but luckily not in the food, which despite the setting, is as vibrant and delicious as any Indian restaurant in Bangkok.

 
 Komala&apos;s South Indian Meal. 

Visiting Komala’s with a companion one recent Sunday, I strode into a restaurant packed to the gills with Indian families on their day out. Indeed, virtually every time I’ve been to Komala’s, I’m generally the only White Guy, which is generally a good sign. Ordering food here involves a confusing process of placing an order at the counter in the front of the restaurant (“Ordering Counter”) and taking the receipt to a counter in the back of the restaurant (“Servery Counter”), whereupon the food will be probably brought to your table by the wait staff. Despite the obvious setbacks, this system can sometimes work in the diner’s favor, such as when my companion was given a delicious dish (onion uttappham, ? baht) he hadn’t actually ordered.

I chose the South Indian Meal, a vast banana leaf topped with a manly mound of rice and no less than 12 different items including rasam, a sour broth; sambar, a hearty soup of pureed lentils and spices; and several delicious sides of steamed raw banana and curried vegetables, among others. Being a fan of sour tastes, I thoroughly relished the tart rasam and the mouth-puckering achar, and even liked the dessert—a tiny cup containing sweetened warm milk with vermicelli. I washed this down with the traditional can of Elephant Ginger Beer (“Using real ginger”), a tasty beverage of Sri Lankan origin.

 
 Ordering at Komala&apos;s might be a confusing ordeal, but the food compares favorably to that found in any other Indian restaurant in Bangkok, especially given the prices. Just ignore the unfortunate color scheme and the plastic chairs. 

My companion ordered the Mysore masala (95 baht), a large triangle of thin crispy dough filled with a spicy pulse and vegetable mixture, which he found agreeable. Indeed, the various breads associated with southern Indian cooking (dosai, rawa, parrotta, poori) are the restaurant’s specialty, and all are served with sides of coconut chutney, onion chutney, and the aforementioned sambar. Many of the breads are intimidating in their girth, but are generally quite light, and I never find one to be enough. However I still recall the shock on the faces of a Thai couple when served a dosai the length of a baseball bat.

Desiring more, my companion ordered a plate of samosa (? baht), which was the biggest disappointment of the meal. As if punishing us for ordering such a banal Indian standard, the samosa were doughy and tasteless, and seemed to have forgotten that they were supposed to be crispy. Also a letdown was another Indian cliché, the mango lassi (? baht). The drink appeared to be nothing more than yoghurt laced with a miserly swirl of mango syrup, and tasted correspondingly.

 
 A girl enjoys bhattura , a deep-fried bread of southern Indian origin. 

A girl at the table next to ours ordered a deep-fried bread that was puffed up to the size of a small basketball, a bhattura, I later learned. As the girl poked the bread with her finger in an effort to deflate it, her father told us that the food at the Bangkok Komala’s was “different” than that of its Singaporean predecessor, although he wasn’t able to explain exactly how. In general I found the food at Komala’s to be everything good food should be: tasty, a good value, and fun, bringing into question why other restaurants need to go to such pretentious lengths (custom-designed carpets, foie gras) to provide good sustenance. Although honestly, somewhat less teal would be appreciated.

click on the image The following is a piece that I wrote several months ago about the food of Luang Prabang, Laos. Unfortunately the article was never printed, but to put it to some use I&apos;ve decided to post it here. Incidentally, I do have photos to accompany the text, but they will be used to illustrate a similar piece currently being written by Bangkok-based writer which will run in an undisclosed magazine. So it&apos;s probably best not to post them here just yet. Enjoy! 

I first visited Luang Prabang in 1998, when the most common way to visit the former royal capital was an arduous two-day boat trip from Chiang Khong, Thailand. Grimy backpackers mingled with homebound locals on the noisy ferry, and through the windows, Laos seemed very much like unexplored territory. Arriving in Luang Prabang, I was amazed to have found such a delightful place that had seemingly not yet been exploited by modern tourism. Accommodation was abundant and more than adequate, but the town’s food, typically quasi-Thai cuisine in overpriced restaurants, or the ubiquitous Vietnamese noodle soup, pho, left a great deal to be desired. The local cuisine was said to be interesting, but was really only available in take-home form from the evening market.

Fast forward nearly eight years and Luang Prabang is clearly on the beaten track. Tourists can now fly directly from Bangkok, and spas, boutique hotels, and high-end shopping are all firmly established. And as a result of all this activity, food, the one area that traditionally lagged behind for so long, is finally starting to catch up. The cuisine of Luang Prabang, for years a concept virtually unknown to the outside world, is by no means generating a buzz, but is grabbing attention, and is finally there for those who are willing to try it.

What have we been missing out on then? To get an idea of the food of Luang Prabang, the best place to go is the town’s daily evening market. It is here where vendors line the streets peddling the flavours of Luang Prabang: bright-red pork curries, grilled Mekong River fish, “salads” of local vegetables, homemade pork and herb sausages, and steaming baskets of sticky rice. The food of Luang Prabang is simple, honest and earthy, relying much on the use of vegetables, herbs, often those having a bitter-spicy flavour, ahaan paa, game from the jungle, and fish from the Mekong River. Unfortunately, the food at the evening market is sold to be eaten at home, and there are no tables or chairs.

However, if you like what you have seen, and you’re ready to taste Luang Prabang, a good starting point is the delightfully unpretentious, third-generation restaurant, Maly Lao Food. “We’re the only restaurant in Luang Prabang that serves authentic local food,” explains Yinthorn Dalachit, son of the restaurant’s namesake. He describes how his mother, Thai by birth, married a high-ranking resident of Luang Prabang and learned the local recipes well enough to become a chef in the former royal palace. The monarchy was abolished along with the advent of communism in 1975, but many of the recipes still survive and are now served in the restaurant.

The restaurant’s optimistic but barely-legible English-language menu doesn’t help much, but simply opening the first page (“Luang Prabang Specialties”) and pointing to a dish at random will virtually guarantee a good choice. With the benefit of experience, I order yam salat, a salad made from a variety of local watercress known as phak naam. The dish resembles a western salad, but the dressing, a tart mixture of lime juice, egg and ground peanuts, is unmistakably Asian. “This dish is very local,” explains Dalachit. “It is always served at any sort of festival or celebration in Luang Prabang.” Other specialties of the restaurant include or laam phak, a thick, savory stew of vegetables and local herbs, and laab paa, a “salad” of minced Mekong River fish with a spicy-tart dressing.

For a more upmarket take on the local cuisine, the Restaurant Les 3 Nagas is easily Luang Prabang’s most ambitious restaurant. An anomaly of sorts, Les 3 Nagas is a fine dining restaurant serving humble Luang Prabang dishes to a mostly foreign clientele. The owner, Yannick Upravan, describes the menu as “real Lao”, but admits that to suit foreign palates, he has compromised on the level of spiciness. “In the beginning I invited my family [to eat at the restaurant], and they said the food was good, but not spicy enough,” he relates, laughing. Ranging from local takes on well-known Lao dishes such as laab, to obscure specialties such as khai phaen, crispy sheets of Mekong river weed, the restaurant’s menu is a virtual encyclopedia of traditional Luang Prabang cuisine.

Ironically, Upravan’s first contact with the food of Luang Prabang came while he was living with relatives as a cooking school student in France. “My aunt’s husband was from Luang Prabang, and in France I ate Luang Prabang food every day,” he recounts. “When I came Luang Prabang I knew the flavours and tastes of the foods, but didn’t know the names. Everybody asked me, ‘How did you learn these recipes living in France?’”

In 2000 Upravan noticed the lack of fine dining in Luang Prabang, and he and a partner opened L’Elephant, a French bistro-style restaurant. An interest in the local cuisine of Luang Prabang’s continued to haunt him though. “Next door to L’Elephant was an aunt of mine,” explains Upravan. “She spent all day in the kitchen making Luang Prabang food, and I could smell this from L’Elephant. We began to exchange food, croissants for Luang Prabang dishes, and when she cooked something I asked her for the recipes.” This growing interest in the local food inspired Yannick to open a restaurant wholly dedicated to the food of Luang Prabang.

I ask Yannick to describe the flavours of Luang Prabang cuisine, and he replies “rustique”. “For instance, or laam,” explains Upravan, describing the thick herb-laden stew—a staple of Luang Prabang cuisine, “has meat, vegetables and paa daek [Lao-style fish sauce]. In the beginning you smell the paa daek, then you taste the flavour of the meat, and then finally the spiciness of the herbs. In this dish there are many tastes,” he explains.

And this complexity is certainly the case with the food at Les 3 Nagas. The food of Luang Prabang is subtle and earthy, slowly approaching you rather than hitting you in the face like Thai food often does. I order jaew bong, a paste of crushed dried chilies, garlic, shallots and buffalo skin that is probably Luang Prabang’s most famous dish. Eaten with sticky rice, the jaew bong is savory and heady—not as spicy as the amount of chilies would suggest, and it takes a few bites before I can really get a grasp on the wide variety of flavours at work.

Another highlight in Luang Prabang’s emerging culinary scene is the Maison Souvannaphoum’s restaurant, L’Elephant Blanc. The hotel and restaurant are located in the home of a former member of Luang Prabang’s royal family, Souvanna Phouma, and L’Elephant Blanc’s executive chef, Vanhsay Picknock, has created a menu that includes Lao and French cuisine, as well as dishes that were once favored by the prince, such as kaeng som kalampi, a sour soup of pork, white cabbage, and herbs such as lemongrass.

The restaurant’s menu also includes a few Luang Prabang specialties. “We have three old local ladies working in the kitchen,” explains Picknock. “We keep them around because they know the local recipes,” laughs the Vientiane-born chef. Local dishes at L’Elephant Blanc include sai ua, a sausage of pork and fresh herbs, and ua nor mai, a tender bamboo shoot stuffed with savory pork and deep-fried. “I was surprised,” replies Chef Vanhsay, when asked how foreign diners respond to local cuisine. “Foreigners who come here can eat Lao food, but if Lao people go to Europe, they probably won’t be able to eat the food,” explains the chef.

Luang Prabang, as well as the rest of Laos, was a French colony for more than 50 years, and the French left a significant culinary legacy, including baguettes, called khao jii by the Lao, and the ubiquitous coffee. This legacy is also evident in Luang Prabang’s numerous French restaurants. The best of these is L’Elephant, also co-owned by Yannick Upravan and his business partner, Gilles Vautrin. The restaurant, opened in 2000, serves, in the words of Mr. Vautrin, “simple, honest French bistro-style food”.

The menu at L’Elephant ranges from French staples using imported ingredients, such as escargots de Bourgogne, to more innovative dishes combining ingredients unique to Luang Prabang with French cooking styles, such as Bouquet de Cresson a la Vinaigrette, a salad using the local watercress. A particular highlight is the use of wild game such as boar and venison, manifest in the restaurant’s Terrine de Sanglier au Poivre Vert et au Cognac, Wildboar Terrine with Green Pepper and Cognac. L’Elephant also has its own organic farm with herbs such as basil and parsley, and salad vegetables such as rocket and frisee. “Sometimes during the high season we couldn’t get all the produce we needed, so we started up our own garden,” explains Gilles. “The produce is better quality and cleaner, and we even sell produce to other restaurants in Vientiane.”

Upscale local cuisine. Imported snails from France. Frisee in Laos. As I exit L’Elephant on my last night in Luang Prabang, reflecting on these culinary anomalies, my eye catches a snapshot of one of L’Elephant’s former customers: Mick Jagger. In this instant I’m convinced that yes, the food in Luang Prabang finally has caught up.

 Gelato so remarkable you&apos;ll think you&apos;re in Italy

 I’m a bit ashamed to admit that the first time I ever tried gelato was only last year, and in Macau of all places. I had heard about this famous Italian-style ice cream many times over the years, but nothing prepared me for my first taste: creamy, smooth and totally refreshing; thoroughly unlike any ice cream I’d ever tried. I’m still looking forward to trying the real stuff in Italy someday, but thanks to Ittiake Kittiungool, an enterprising 33-year-old Thai, tasting authentic Italian-style gelato now requires only a trip to Siam Paragon.

Kittiungool, who first discovered quality ice cream while a university student in San Francisco, took his newfound interest to lengths not many would be willing to follow. After returning home to Thailand, he arranged to take courses in ice cream making at the Frozen Dessert University in Bologna, Italy. At this institution, the only of its kind in the world, Kittiungool studied under Luciano Ferrari, a well-respected figure in the world of Italian-style ice creams. Upon returning to Thailand, he opened up Gelate, a shop selling gelato, milk-based ice creams, and sorbetto, fruit-based sorbets, at Central World Plaza.

 
 Gelate owner Ittiake Kittiungool studied at Italy&apos;s Frozen Dessert University, where he learned the art of creating flavorful gelate and sorbettos. 

I meet with Kittiungool, who has no previous experience in cooking or the food industry, at his shop in the basement of Siam Paragon. I ask him to describe the differences between North American-style ice creams, which comprise the majority of ice cream sold in Bangkok, and gelato. “Gelato has a dense texture, but is light and smooth, and it has less fat,” explains Kittiungool. “Also, all of the ingredients are fresh, which gives us the opportunity to create unlimited flavours.” He pauses and points at some freshly cut pineapples at a nearby stall. “For example, if we wanted to make pineapple sorbetto, we could just take that and use it right now. It all depends on whatever raw ingredients are available.”

As we are talking two girls walk by and I overhear them remarking how delicious Gelate’s ice cream looks. This prompts Kittiungool to mention what is perhaps the single most recognizable aspect of gelato: its appearance. “How it looks is the most important thing,” he explains. “That’s what catches people’s attention.” At Gelate this involves whipping the ice cream into tall peaks, and decorating these with generous chunks of the various ingredients. Kittiungool even goes as far as to serve the gelato with the traditional flat metal spatulas rather than the ubiquitous ice cream scoop. This emphasis on authenticity has led to Kittiungool importing ingredients, machinery, and even display cases directly from Italy. “Our concept is to make everything as real as possible,” he explains.

 
 A few of the gelate available at Gelato, a recently opened ice cream shop at Siam Paragon. 

I ask Kittiungool if he has made any allowances for Thai tastes, and he explains that Thais aren’t as fond of sweet tastes as the Italians are, so his gelato is significantly less sugary. So far people in Bangkok seem to favour his milk-based gelate, and hazlenut and cheesecake are currently the shop’s best sellers. He offers me a bowl of three gelate: pistachio, double chocolate and bacio (Italian for “kiss”), a mixture of chocolate and hazelnut. Both of the nut-flavored gelate resonate with the flavour of real nuts, as opposed to powders or syrups, and the texture is smooth and almost fluffy. The pistachio gelato in particular is deliciously fruity and savory, with its green color an indicator of the generous amount of pistachios it includes. Gelate’s sorbettos consist of just fruit and syrup, and are thus fat-free, and the most popular flavour is fruitti di bosco, mixed fruit.

Right now Gelate can only be found at Siam Paragon, but Kittiungool plans to open outlets in Central World Plaza and The Mall Ngam Wong Wan in the coming months. “I’d love to have an shop with fresh ice cream made on-site, and a Lambretta hanging from the ceiling!” the young entrepreneur tells me while I try finish every last drop of my ice cream. Gauging by the product he’s created, it seems like it’s only a matter of time.

Gelate is located inside Gourmet Market, basement floor, Siam Paragon.

click on the image Today was a clean out the fridge kinda dinner, and here&apos;s some of what I came across:

 

Long beans, pork, curry paste... I know what you&apos;re thinking: You can make phat phrik khing! Well, that&apos;s what I thought, and here&apos;s how to go about it.

Phat phrik khing is a very easy dish to make, and is probably one of the first Thai dishes I ever learned to make. I think most of the ingredients, including the curry paste, are generally available in the West nowadays, so go ahead and give this one a try if you&apos;re new to Thai food. Going from my mise en place, here&apos;s exactly what you&apos;ll need:

 

Starting at 6 o&apos;clock you have some parboiled long beans. These are made by taking long beans, chopping them into 1-inch lengths, and boiling them in salty water, immediately plunging them into cool water to stop the cooking process. Actually you don&apos;t have to parboil the beans first--you can just fry them in the curry, but I think this is easier. Continuing clockwise we have three or four kaffir lime leaves sliced as finely as possible, sugar, water, cooking oil and fish sauce. At 3 o&apos;clock we have some phat phrik khing curry paste that I bought pre-made a few days ago. And in the middle is pork cut into bite-sized pieces.

First, using a generous amount of oil, fry the curry paste over med-high heat in a wok until it is fragrant and a layer of red oil has begun to emerge:

 

Then add your pork, coating it with the curry paste:

 

Continue frying and stirring until the pork is fully cooked, at which point the mixture should be quite dry. Add about a 1/2 cup or so of water, turning up the heat, and fry, stirring constantly, until the mixture is reduced and curry-like:

 

At this point season the mixture to taste with fish sauce and sugar (Thais like this dish sweet--I don&apos;t), and add your long beans and kaffir lime leaf slivers. As the long beans are already cooked, you really just want to heat them through here:

 

And you&apos;re done:

 

You could make with any meat you like--my particular favorite is big chunks of a particular kind of crispy dried fish--but pork is the most common. I had mine with hot rice and a fried egg.

I ordered a bowl of khao tom with squid, oysters and fish belly:

 

The green stuff is khuen chai , Chinese celery, as well as some green onions and deep-fried crispy garlic. The rice is soft, not soggy, the seafood broth is really light, and the seafood perfectly undercooked.

Khuat ordered the same thing, but with pickled jellyfish (no comment) and oysters:

 

Perhaps even more than the rice soup, I really love the hors d&apos;oeuvre of strips of crispy deep-fried tofu served with a spicy-sour-salty sauce:

 

The sauce is made from tao jiaow , fermented soybeans, and is liberally laced with sliced chilies and lime juice. The sauce is also meant to go in your rice soup, but this is one of the few places that does food so well, you don&apos;t really need to add a bunch of supeflous sauces.

And finally we also ordered a bowl of parboiled seafood:

 

This is essentially the same thing as khao tom, just without the rice and broth. This bowl contained (more) oysters, (unfortunately more) pickled jellyfish and slices of plaa kraphong , sea bass. All of these are dipped in boiling water just for a second, so that they&apos;re not really cooked, but no longer raw. This dish also has a generous amount of Chinese celery and deep-fried garlic, which is best after you&apos;ve mixed it all around a bit:

 

Until it looks like this:

 

Mmm...

click on the image A few days ago David Thompson and Thanongsak were kind enough to invite me and Hal Lipper, a friend and writer at the Nation , to visit Singburi province, about 200 km north of Bangkok. David had been to this relatively obscure province previously and had come across a couple good restaurants that he wanted to share with us.

It soon became clear that this was going to be a food-oriented trip when we took a lengthy detour to a tiny town to pick up some plaa som , fermented fish! The first restaurant we visited was Sum Phai, a tiny, ramshackle place in the countryside outside Singburi town. David and Thanongsak had called ahead and arranged for us to watch the ladies make our lunch so we could see how it was done.

As Singburi is located in central Thailand, the food was representative of this area, which meant slightly sweet dishes, often using coconut milk, and employing a variety of freshwater fish. Hal and I lent a hand, as much as we could, including grinding up the curry paste:

 

However the old ladies did all the cooking, much of which was done over charcoal:

 

This is Paa Anong making kaeng khi lek , a coconut milk-based curry that uses the bitter leaves of the neem tree and slices of grilled beef:

 

They also made plaa raa sap , unpasteurized fermented fish chopped up with a bunch of fresh herbs:

 

This was probably my favorite dish of the meal, but due to its main ingredient being essetially, rotten fish, Thanongsak and I were virtually the only ones eating it! The dish was accompanied by delicious fresh herbs directly from the restaurant owner&apos;s garden.

We also had puu lon , another &apos;dip&apos;, this time of coconut milk, ground pork, salted field crabs and lots palm sugar and fresh herbs:

 

On the way to the restaurant Thanongsak stopped to pick up some hor mok , cakes of fish and curry, and we the ladies to steam them for us:

 

The fish used in the hor mok is a freshwater fish called plaa chon , serpenthead or snakehead fish, and is a speciality of the province. We also had semi-dried semi-salted fillets of this fish that the ladies deep-fried for us:

 

As delicious as these look, the fish was kind of musty tasting and wasn&apos;t really that good, which was disappointing, as this particular dish is a specialty of the area.

David&apos;s favorite dish was yam takhrai , a &apos;salad&apos; of very thinly sliced lemongrass with prawns and dried squid:

 

That evening, still quite full from lunch, we visited another restaurant, Mae Laa Plaa Phao, a place known for its grilled plaa chon:

 

The large plaa chon was grilled/smoked over coconut husks, served with bitter sadao leaves and two sauces, a sweet and a sour/spicy. Absolultely delicious. We also had a stir fry of the fermented fish we had bought earlier, a soup with pickled mustard greens, and stir fried Thai watercress.

The next morning we woke up very early to visit Singburi&apos;s immense morning market:

 

And later that day we made our way to neighboring Ang Thong province, where we stopped by a place known for its &apos;jungle&apos; food. There we ordered a dish of dried frog meat sauteed with curry paste:

 

We also ordered an idential dish with cobra meat. Despite the intimidating-sounding ingredients, the dominant flavor was spicy, and virtually any meat could have been used. David described the dishe as having &quot;a lot of potential&quot;, and theorized about doing a version with quail or hare at his restaurant .

There was also phat phet muu paa , a stir fry of boar:

 

And a tom yam of free-range chicken:

 

Overall a really fun trip with some amazing food. I need to do more food-based travelling in the future, especially in out of the way places like this. Incidentally, Hal&apos;s article on our trip, illustrated with my photos, will appear in the Nation in coming weeks. Will keep you informed.

click on the image Chinese cooking has had a very large impact on Thai cooking, and in many cases has become so intertwined with native dishes and ingredients that their Chinese origins are completely obscured. On the other hand, there are several restaurants that sell Chinese food more or less in its original unchanged form. An example of this is the place near my house that we went to the other day. I forgot the name, but it doesn&apos;t really matter, as you&apos;ll see below.

Khuat ordered khao naa pet , rice with roasted duck:

 

The roast duck, skin included, is served over rice with a duck gravy/soy sauce and side of vegetables. Looks pretty good but her verdict was extremely mediocre, no specific details given.

I ordered a few trays of dim sum:

 

Dim sum is a dish I really want to like, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever really enjoyed it, even when I&apos;ve had it in China (Macau). This restaurant&apos;s version was pretty standard for Thailand, i.e. unidentifiable orbs of meat encased in dough, except this was worse; the trays were only steamed for about 30 seconds leaving the dim sum somewhere between cold and room temperature. We ordered about five different kinds, but they really all tasted like the same combination of ground pork and shrimp. Ugh...

My final choice was kuaytiao pet , duck noodles:

 

Actually I don&apos;t know why I even ordered this one. I don&apos;t really care for the broth, which tends to be too sweet and is ruined by adding a bunch of Chinese herbs and spices.

click on the image I&apos;ve had some free time lately, and as a result have been working like mad on my book. It will be one in a series called Flavours of the Street , of which Flavours of the Street: Turkey is the only one to have been published so far. Mine will focus on the food of Southern Thailand and is supposed to be finished by August...

Anyway, on a more positive note, I&apos;m going to start posting some of the recipes I&apos;m working on here. Would really appreciate it if people made them and gave me feedback as to the clarity of the instuctions, taste, whatever. I&apos;m starting with what is probably the easiest recipe in the whole book: Moo Waan , sweet pork belly. All you need is four ingredients and about one hour. The important thing with this recipe is to use good quality ingredients, especially concerning the palm sugar. I was lucky enough to have some excellent stuff from Phetburi, a province known for its sugar.

Unfortunately I don&apos;t have the usual step-by-step illustrations here, but will try to do so in the future.

Sweet Pork Belly Muu Waan
 (Serves 4)

 
 
Pork belly (skin, fat and meat) 500 g
Cooking oil 1 Tbsp
Palm sugar 5 Tbsp
Fish sauce 2 tsp, or to taste

Wash pork and cut into bite size pieces. In a large pot of boiling water, blanch pork for 5 seconds. Drain and set aside.

In a large wok over med-high heat, add oil, followed by palm sugar and fish sauce. Stir mixture until the sugar has melted and has combined with the fish sauce to form a thick sauce.

Add pork to sugar mixture, stir to combine, and reduce heat to as low as possible. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is meltingly soft and sugar is dark and caramelized, at least one hour.

Serve hot with rice as part of a southern Thai meal.

click on the image Working freelance, I have a very open schedule, and try to set aside time each day to have a coffee and read the paper(s) at a local cafe. This almost always ends up being one of a few modern-style cafes serving Italian coffee drinks. Today however, I went back to a more traditional, Chinese style coffee place I used to visit regularly a few years back. Unlike the places I usually go, which have music, a TV, air conditioning and wealthy Thai people talking loudly on cell phones, this place had one table that wasn&apos;t piled with the owners stuff (the shop also doubles as his living room), a screaming baby, and the employees at the next table eating a lunch of smelly fermented fish!

The place serves coffee the Chinese/Thai way, which means putting the loose grinds in a small sock-like filter, and pouring the hot water through that. This kind of coffee is very dark and thick, but acutally has little body, and isn&apos;t generally very good. It is either served hot, with sweetened condensed milk, or cold, with regular milk and lotsa ice:

 

Another specialty of this place, and other cafes like it, is grilled bread. Elsewhere this often takes the form of toast, but at this place they take soft rolls, gorge them with butter-flavored margarine, sprinkle with sugar, and grill in an oven, and chop them up:

 

Good, but real heavy, and real sweet.

click on the image Fun Talop is the name of an isaan-style Thai restaurant that, I think, started out at the famous Chatujak Market. That&apos;s where I first came across it anyway. The restaurant is located in a somewhat remote corner of the market and was hugely popular, with lines of people breathing down your neck and staring at your som tam as they waited to take your seat. The woman who made som tam there did so in two of the biggest mortar and pestles I&apos;ve ever seen, working with one pestle in each hand! The 7 above refers to the fact that this new Fun Talop is the seventh branch of the original restaurant, which shows its popularity. Luckily for me this most recent outlet of Fun Talop is about 1 km from my house. So of course we had to try it out.

We started with a dish that we always ordered at the original Fun Talop, plaa som :

 

This is a kind of freshwater fish that has been stuffed with rice and left to ferment for a few days. The fish is then deep-fried until crispy, and is deliciously sour. The only downside is that it contains hundreds of literally microscopic bones, which inevitably end up lodged in your throat.

We had tom saep , an isaan-style tom yam, with tender pork ribs:

 

This was also sour from the use of lime juice, and was fortified with khao khua, ground roasted sticky rice.

And of course when eating isaan food you also have to have som tam , papaya salad:

 

This kind is called tam sua , and the papaya is mashed up with thin rice noodles.

We also ordered a plate of sai krok isaan , fermented pork sausages:

 

The casings are stuffed with rice and fatty pork, and are grilled or deep-fried. They are taken with hearty slices of garlic and ginger.

And when eating isaan food the rice of choice is sticky rice:

 

All in all a great lunch, but for some reason I miss the hustle and bustle of the original.

click on the image Kaeng massaman , literally &quot;Muslim curry&quot;, is a dish you&apos;ll probably find in almost every Thai cookbook. I&apos;ve tried many of these recipes and have never been happy until recently. The following recipe is one that I came across in a Thai-language cookbook and adapted myself, and is by far the best I&apos;ve seen. Kaeng massaman differs from most Thai curries in that it doesn&apos;t have a curry paste that&apos;s pounded up in a mortar and pestle; the ingredients, mostly dried spices, are added step by step. Keep in mind that Thai-Muslim food tends to be sweet. If you don&apos;t like sweet dinner dishes, than reduce the amount of sugar in the last step. Most people expect this dish to have peanuts; you can put them in there at the last step if you want, but I think it&apos;s oily and fatty enough already!

“Muslim” Curry with Beef Kaeng Matsaman Nuea
(Serves 4)

 

Ingredients
Beef 500 g
Thick coconut milk* 1 cup
Think coconut milk** 1 cup
Freshly roasted and ground
coriander seed 3 Tbsp
Freshly roasted and ground

Chili powder 2 Tbsp
Turmeric powder 1/2 tsp
Ground pepper 2 tsp
Cooking oil 3/4 cup
Chopped shallots 1/4 cup
Cinnamon 3 pieces
Star anise 3
Thai cardamom (look krawaan) 10
Water 1/2 cup
Potatoes 200 g, quartered
Shrimp paste 1 tsp
Peppercorns 20, crushed
Shredded ginger 1/2 cup
Salt 1 1/2 Tbsp
Tamarind paste 4 Tbsp
Palm sugar 5 Tbsp
Onion 1, sliced

*Thick coconut milk is the coconut milk that comes directly from the can.
**Thin coconut milk is canned coconut milk that has been diluted, 50%, with water.

Method
Wash beef and cut into large bite sized pieces. In a medium saucepan, cover beef with water, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until beef is tender, at least 40 minutes.

Combine ground coriander, ground cumin, chili powder, and ground pepper. Set aside.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, add oil and fry shallots with cinnamon, star anise and Thai cardamom, until golden and crispy. Add dry spice mixture, stirring well to combine. When fragrant, add thick coconut milk followed by water. Bring to a slight boil and add potatoes. Simmer until potatoes are just done, about 5 minutes, and add beef. Combine shrimp paste with two Tbsp of hot curry mixture and return to saucepan, stirring to combine. Add peppercorns and ginger. Bring to a boil and reduce heat, simmering until fragrant and flavors have combined. Add thin coconut milk and season with salt, tamarind paste and palm sugar. Bring to a boil and add onions, simmer until onions are soft and remove from heat.

Serve hot with rice as part of a southern Thai meal.

 From Iran to Bangladesh, a tour around the cuisines of Nana&apos;s Soi Arab 

The songlike call to prayer emerged from a mosque across the street as I sat sipping a glass of mint-laced tea. I turned to find the source of the noise but by my view was obstructed by the fragrant smoke of several turbaned men smoking hookahs. Where am I, you may wonder? Well, not Dubai, or Damascus, or even Beirut, but rather Bangkok. Sukhumvit Soi 3/1 to be exact.

Known colloquially as Soi Arab, this street, and the area that surrounds it have long been associated with visiting Muslims. In reality, the name Soi Arab is a misnomer, as the area is home to North Africans, West Africans, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Persians and Malaysians, as well as Arabs, but the atmosphere is unmistakably Muslim.

 

And a great deal of this atmosphere is provided by the area’s lively food scene. Muslim food conjures of images of flatbreads and skewered meat, mezze and bizarre grains, and Soi Arab is no exception. A stroll around the area will reveal signs advertising a variety of restaurants serving Egyptian, Bangladeshi, Malaysian and Persian cuisine. However, despite these names, the vast majority of the restaurants serve what could only be described as ‘Pan-Muslim’ cuisine, typically incorporating elements of the better-known Lebanese and Indian styles of cooking. A restaurant claiming to have Turkish food might also have hummus on its menu, whereas a Bangladeshi restaurant may also serve a few Arab specialties. However there are a few restaurants that focus on the cuisine of a particular country, which are described in more detail below.

Nasser Elmassry Restaurant&amp;Shishah
4/6 Sukhumvit Soi 3/1
02 253 5582
www.restaurant-shishah-nasir.com

Nasser Elmassry is one of several Egyptian restaurants in the Soi Arab are, but judging by the amount of kitschy Egyptian paraphernalia and abundance of stainless steel, appears to be the most well established. However it’s the food, rather than the ambiance, that has kept me coming back to Nasser Elmassry for years. The freshly baked pita bread (particularly the kind topped with garlic) is the best in the area, delicious when dipped into the Middle Eastern standards of hummus and baba ganoush, and hand-in-glove perfect with the Egyptian national dish, ful, pureed fava beans. As with most Muslim food, the emphasis at Nasser Elmassry is on meat, and my companions and I ordered grilled lamb chops and mutton and chicken kebabs, which served together on a vast platter, appeared substantial enough to satisfy any large carnivore. The meats were delicious and suggested every adjective associated with grilled meat: smoky, juicy and tender. One disappointing aspect of Nasser Elmassry, other than the grumpy and pushy service, is that more than 2/3 of the menu is written only in Arabic, suggesting that there’s almost certainly a great deal more on offer than the usual Middle Eastern standards.

 

Nasser Elmassry also features a shishah, an upstairs smoking room, where customers can recline and watch Egyptian TV programs while smoking fruit flavored tobacco from bubbling hookahs. You can also eat there if you don’t mind consuming your kebab in a haze of cherry-scented smoke.

Al-Iraqi Restaurant
8/17-18 Sukhumvit Soi 3/1
02 655 5357

Tucked into the far corner of Soi 3/1, Al-Iraqi is a restaurant that one could easily pass by without noticing it, as I did myself several times. The restaurant, as the name suggests, serves the cuisine of Iraq, a country known for many things other than its food, but the existence of a restaurant in Bangkok serving its cuisine must mean there’s something there, so I gave it a try.

 

Navigating the lengthy menu, I asked the staff for something typically Iraqi and was steered towards the Iraqi kebab, two skewers of minced lamb, lightly spiced and served on a bed of shredded cabbage. The meat was, I imagine, probably as good as grilled minced lamb can possibly be, and was accompanied by two colossal wheels of freshly baked bread made in a tandoor-style oven in front of the restaurant. I was only able to eat one piece of bread and was shocked to see the Iraqi man at the next table order curry and bread, as well as a heaping biryani-style rice dish, also a staple of Iraqi cooking.

Kebabs
Sukhumvit Soi 3/1, next door to Nefertiti Egyptian Restaurant

 

If you find the relatively high price of food in the Soi Arab area prohibitive, it will come as good news to learn that the area is also home to one of Bangkok’s best value meals: kebabs. Consumed directly on the street or at rickety tables, the kebabs sold in Soi Arab are utterly proletarian, but really are delicious, and at 50 baht, one of the best deals in Bangkok. There are three vendors selling kebabs, but the best is found at a basic restaurant adjacent to the Nefertiti Egyptian Restaurant. The kebabs here are carved from rotating spits of beef or chicken, rolled in a thin flatbread and are slathered with the requisite vegetables and sauces (as well as, oddly enough, but deeply satisfying, thick cut French fries) before being warmed in a sandwich grill. Simple, delicious and filling. And the kebab I ordered take home was just as delicious as the one I ate at the restaurant.

Abyssinya Café
16/11 Sukhumvit Soi 3
02 655 3436
www.search.in.th/abyssinya

Those in search of something more obscure than hummus or pita can do no better than Thailand’s only Ethiopian restaurant, Abyssinya Café. Located just off of Soi Arab on Sukhumvit Soi 3, this café/restaurant was started three years ago by Tigist Fekade, an Ethiopian woman who, in the words of her daughter, Frey Nebiat, was simply “looking for good coffee.” Ethiopia is the homeland of the coffee plant, and when Fekade was not able to find real Ethiopian coffee in Bangkok, she decided to circumvent the problem altogether and opened her own café serving the drink.

 

It didn’t take long before customers started asking for Ethiopian food, and Fekade expanded the café concept to include a variety of traditional Ethiopian dishes. Stopping by on a recent day I ordered yemisir kik wet, a vegetarian set that included stewed lentils, curried onions, a vegetable curry and an Ethiopian-style vegetable salad. My companion ordered yedoro kei watt, chicken cooked in spicy/sour berbere sauce and accompanied by homemade Ethiopian style curds and a hard-boiled egg. The dishes were served together on a large platter, the curries placed directly on top of two vast portions of injera, spongy Ethiopian-style bread. “We used to get our injera directly from Ethiopia,” explained Nebiat, of the soft, gray flatbread, “But Ethiopian Airlines stopped giving out free tickets, so now we make it here.” Along with teff, the grains used to make injera, the restaurant imports the majority of its ingredients, including the chilies and spices used to make the piquant berbere sauce, a staple of Ethiopian cooking.

The emphasis on coffee has not faded, and every Saturday and Sunday evening at 7:00 PM, Fekade brews up Ethiopian coffee beans the traditional way.

Shater Restaurant Persian Food
79/6 Sukhumvit Soi 3/1
02 655 6460

Persian is one of those cuisines I had only ever read about, so I was excited to discover that Soi 3/1 is also home to a restaurant featuring the food of Iran. I visited the restaurant recently looking forward to trying something new and exotic, but was disappointed by the menu, which seemed to feature nothing but eerily similar combinations of grilled meat and rice. Surely the people of Iran eat more than this? Nonetheless I braved forward and chose a dish highlighted as the “Webmaster’s Favorite”, the gormeh sabsi (“parsley, cilantro, chives and beans cooked with veal shank and served with basmati rice”). The dish took the form of a dark puree of the aforementioned herbs, with the random bit of bean and meat floating in the mix. The dominant taste was sour, and was not entirely unpleasant, but was entirely uninspiring. The dish and its accompanying Everest-like mound of rice seemed to be an illustration of food for sustenance. Perhaps I should have stuck with the grilled meat?

Al-Hussain Restaurant
75/7 Sukhumvit Soi 3/1
02 252 0240

Al-Hussain is located in the heart of Soi 3/1 and boasts a vast display case holding a variety of curries and brandishing a line of Bangladeshi text. Assuming the restaurant served Bangladeshi food, I asked the employees to recommend any specialties of this country. “All our foods are Bangladeshi,” said the man behind the counter, in an effort to get me to hurry up and order something. So I pointed to a chickpea curry, curried vegetables, and dhal, pureed lentils in a spicy broth, accompanied by the ubiquitous naan bread. The food was hearty and tasty—very similar to meals I’ve had in Pakistan, although I don’t think it was particularly Bangladeshi, which to my limited understanding emphasizes freshwater fish and mustard seed.

 

Al-Hussain features an open-air dining area, and during the course of my meal, every time a European-looking foreigner walked by, the staff had the annoying habit of screaming “Welcome saaar!” which seemed to result in making all European-looking foreigners eat everywhere but Al-Hussain.

 Inspired by a delicious Italian meal, our writer tries to make it himself. 

Fans of pasta and pizza in Bangkok should consider themselves particularly fortunate; the Italian Trade Commission estimates that there are currently more than 300 Italian restaurants in the capital. This is obviously a wonderful situation for diners, but what about those of us who love to cook? Does Bangkok also have the ingredients and produce to make a high quality Italian meal at home?

I first began to think about this after eating at biscotti , the Four Seasons’ Italian restaurant. When I stopped by last week, Chef Giovanni Speciale was preparing food from his home province of Puglia, also known as Apulia, the “heel” of the Italian boot. His meal began with hearty slices of grilled bread spread with ricotta forte, a pungent cheese spread, accompanied by a white globe of mozzarella di bufala topped with arugula and cherry tomatoes. This was followed by orrechiete, the “little ears” of pasta often associated with southern Italy, served with a thin sauce of broccoli, anchovies, chili and olive oil. “You cook the broccoli in the same water as the pasta, and you add just a bit of chili,” explained Chef Giovanni, who emerged from his kitchen to explain each course. The final course was bombette di maiale, thin slices of pork filled with provolone cheese, wrapped in pancetta and grilled.

 
 Chef Giovanni Speciale explains the nuances of Puglia&apos;s major product, olive oil. 

Wiping our plates clean of dessert, my companion and I were awed; the meal was simple and even rustic, but astonishingly delicious, the result of strong, confident flavors and quality ingredients; in short, I wanted to make it. Luckily, during the course of the meal, Chef Giovanni was kind enough to describe how the dishes were made. The only obstacle would be finding some of the more obscure ingredients. Obviously this would involve sourcing a fair amount of imported meats and cheeses, but when possible, I wanted to look into the growing variety of Italian-style ingredients that are being produced in Thailand today. An invaluable tool in my mission was a map provided by the Embassy of Italy, Bangkok With an Italian Heart, which describes the various Italian institutions, monuments, restaurants and shops found in Bangkok.

To recreate Chef Giovanni’s antipasti, I followed a lead indicated on the map and visited Maria Pizzeria (909-917 Silom Road,02 234 0440). Seemingly a nondescript pizza parlor from the outside, Maria is also the home of Gennaro, one of Thailand’s first producers of Italian-style cheeses. In an effort to provide cheese for his popular pizza restaurant, owner Somchai Thaveepholcharoen decided to make Italian-style cheeses himself. He sent an employee to Italy to study cheese making, imported the necessary equipment, and began producing Italian-style cheeses using Thai milk. That was 15 years ago, and today Thaveepholcharoen produces more than 10 different styles of cheese including mozzarella, ricotta, mascarpone, scamorza and most interestingly, a fresh mozzarella that contains buffalo milk. “[Buffalo milk] is very hard to get,” explained Thaveepholcharoen. “Thais aren’t interested in making it, so I can’t get a lot of it.” It is this fresh cheese that I have come by to pick up, and Thaveepholcharoen mentions that Gennaro products are also available at some branches of Tops, Villa and Foodland, but he has no problem with people coming to the restaurant simply to buy cheese to go.

My next stop was at another business featured on the map, Food DItalia (160/1 Sukhumvit Soi 33, 02 259 9549). Owned by Roberto Brivio, a friendly native of Milan, Food DItalia is an importer of Italian food products into Thailand. Though the vast majority of his business is conducted through hotels and restaurants, Brivio is more than happy to serve individuals who are willing to come to his showroom. “I like being here to explain the products to customers,” explains Brivio. I describe the meal I plan to make and he is able to provide every last ingredient including smoked pancetta, which Brivio slices paper-thin, a “spicy” provolone cheese known as auricchio, and ricotta dura di pecora, a sheep’s milk cheese from Puglia. “People in Puglia use this cheese on pasta instead of parmesan,” explained Brivio, as he gave me a piece to taste. The cheese was delicious, and was just one of the products that I didn’t previously realize was available in Bangkok. As an added bonus, I am able to take Brivio’s last bag of fresh orrechiete; a vast improvement over the dried stuff generally available at Bangkok’s supermarkets.

 
 Food DItalia owner Roberto Brivio slices off paper thin slices of prosciutto. 

I had mentioned to Roberto that I was still in need of wine, preferably something from Puglia, and he suggested I visit ItalAsia ’s showroom at All Seasons Place (Wireless Road, 02 685 3862). ItalAsia is Thailand’s oldest importer of Italian goods, and claims to have the largest selection of Italian wines. I stopped by the small shop, and after some deliberation, picked up a 1.5 litre bottle of Sangiovese di Puglia, a dry red that would hopefully go well with the slightly spicy pasta course and the grilled meat with its strong cheese filling.

I still needed a few odds and ends, and stopped by Villa, Bangkok’s standby for imported groceries. For better or worse, Villa’s stock of specialty food items is unmatched, and I needed a few items that could only be found there. I picked up some arugula from Rai Pluk Rak, Thailand’s first organic farm, as well as a jar of oil-preserved anchovies from Siam Fishery, a Thai brand. I also bought a loaf of country-style sourdough bread from La Boulange, Bangkok’s best bakery, which sells its products at Villa.

My final stop was at my favorite store in Bangkok: Doi Kham (101 Kamphaeng Phet Road, 02 279 1551). This tiny supermarket located near the Or Tor Kor Market stocks a truly impressive variety of Western-style produce grown in northern Thailand under the auspices of the Royal Project Foundation. The fruits and vegetables sold at Doi Kham are high quality, pesticide-free and include such Italian staples as eggplants, artichokes, fennel, zucchini, bell peppers and radicchio, as well as fresh herbs such as sage, Italian parsley, oregano and thyme. I picked up some young broccoli and juicy cherry tomatoes—essential ingredients for the pasta dish, and made my way home.

 
 Doi Kham stocks an impressive variety of produce. 

The next day I invited some friends over and made my Apulian meal. Relying on Chef Giovanni’s descriptions and my own experience making Italian food, the cooking went relatively smoothly. The antipasti of grilled bread, arugula salad and mozzarella was a hit, the creamy buffalo cheese winning over even those who normally don’t like dairy products. The fresh pasta of the next course was deliciously tender, and was only improved by the tender Doi Kham broccoli and tomatoes and the strong flavours of the Thai anchovies and dried chili. The Apulian wine stood up to the food well, surviving both the spicy pasta and the strong provolone in the grilled pork.

 
 Pleasing the critics. 

In the end my Apulian meal wasn’t necessarily cheaper or even more delicious than my meal at biscotti, but for someone who loves to cook, it was a pleasure to discover the diversity of products available in Bangkok. And although sourcing these ingredients may have involved a considerable amount of travel, it was worth it considering the quality of both the imported and the domestically produced products. With resources such as these, surely it’s only a matter of time before Italian food in Bangkok moves from the restaurant into the home.

click on the image Nong Khai is the name of a province in NE Thailand. Lying on banks of the Mekong River, the city of Nong Khai sits directly across from Vientiane, the capial of Laos. Nong Khai is also the name of an Isaan/Vietnamese restaurant very near my home. The place is a real hole in the wall, incorporating insanely crappy service, horribly filthy tablecloths and a kitchen I&apos;m sure I do not want to see. But despite all this, the restaurant serves some of the most interesting regional food in Bangkok, a delicious mix of Vietnamese and NE Thai fare.

Below is by far my favorite dish at the restaurant, as well as possibly one of the tastiest dishes I&apos;ve come across yet in this country, laap plaa duk :

 

Laap, as you may already know, is a kind of NE Thai-style &quot;salad&quot; usually consisting of minced meat. Plaa duk means catfish. In this laap the catfish has been grilled, then the meat picked off and minced up along with some hearty freshwater snails. The lot is then mixed up with sliced shallots, green onions, fish sauce, lime and khao khua , ground up roasted sticky rice. It is then served with two vegetables, dill, in the back, known in Thai as phak chee lao , &quot;Lao coriander&quot;, and a hard-to-find herb called phak khayaeng . I&apos;m really not sure how to describe the flavor of this herb, which I&apos;ve virtually only ever come across at this restaurant, but it&apos;s sort of bitter and fresh at the same time. The laap itself is spicy, sour, savory, smoky, crunchy, chewy... it really has got everything.

Following close behind the laap plaa duk in terms of interest and flavor is the restaurant&apos;s namesake, som tam nong khai :

 

This som tam differs from papaya salad elsewhere in the use of a few very interesting ingredients. First of all, the small green seeds on the top are called kathin and have a pungent flavor, similar to the southern Thai favorite, sator . Also making this som tam very unusual is the addition of kung ten , literally &quot;dancing shrimp&quot;. These are tiny freshwater shrimp that are kept alive until being cooked (or more commonly, eaten raw). They are named for the way they bounce around in the mesh containers they are kept in until being used. And finally this som tam uses a particular kind of small round green and red tomato found in northern isaan and northern Thailand known as makhuea som . These tomatoes have a wonderfully crispy texture, and a slightly sour/sweet flavor. All in all a very unusual and delicious variation on the already delicious papaya salad.

Next was deep-fried pork belly served with thin rice noodles and crispy fried shallots, a dish of Vietnamese origin, I do believe.

 

Pretty damn good, but crunching through deep-fried pork fat is a guilty pleasure I&apos;d rather not take part in too often.

One of the most popular dishes at the restaurant is a Vietnamese dish called naem nueang :

 

This is grilled pork &quot;sausages&quot; served with a variety of condiments and rice paper wrappers and a fat bowl of fresh herbs. You take a lettuce leaf, top it with some herbs, top this with a piece of rice paper, a chunk of sausage, a chunk of garlic, cucumber, chilies, unripe banana or starfruit, and finish it off with a generous dollop of the requisite sweet/sour peanut sauce. The final step involves rolling this &quot;package&quot; up and stuffing it in your greedy gob. Yes, I know, a lot of work just to eat, but it&apos;s worth it.

My companions ordered this dish, pork skewers wrapped in bai cha phluu (wild tea leaf) and &quot;grilled&quot;:

 

I write &quot;grilled&quot; rather than grilled because the menu says they are grilled when in fact they are deep-fried. A brilliant idea for a dish, but definately not something that should be deep-fried; the greasy skewers alone are enough to make me not want to eat it.

My muse led me to Nonthaburi Market, north of Bangkok. This is a really fun market in a sort of old fashioned area right next to the Chao Phraya River.

A marketside breakfast of stewed pork leg amongst the flies and screaming vendors. Not my ideal brekkie:

 

Much more interesting for breakfast are khanom jeep , Chinese-style dim sum-like meat tidbits:

 

You&apos;ll need coffee, and that&apos;s what this cheeky lad is here for:

 

Steamed plaa thuu , mackerel, is one of the most common foods in Thailand:

 

Sometimes plaa thuu is grilled, along with chilies, garlic, shallots and eggplant, and then mashed up in mortar and pestle into a delicicous dip. Here are the ingredients before the mashing; the dish is made to order:

 

This guy is dishing up preserved freshwater crabs, a popular ingredient in NE-style som tam:

 

This guy was selling knives and razors. To the right is a try of very finely chopped ginger. I&apos;m not sure if this was for sale or a testament to the sharpness of his knives!

click on the image Was at the venerable Or Tor Kor Market again this afternoon for lunch and a spot of shopping. Since the recent rennovation, the old Or Tor Kor is becoming a more and more interesting place to eat. Today&apos;s lunch involved eats from the polar opposite ends of Thailand; the cool north and the spicy south.

Starting in the north, I downed a bowl of khanom jeen naam ngiaow , a spaghetti-like sauce of pork and tomatoes served over thin rice noodles:

 

These were served up by a lady from Chiang Rai in the far north of Thailand. Here&apos;s the old gal dishing up another bowl:

 

A single bowl of noodles generally not being enough, we decided to move to the stall next door, which served southern-style food. Khuat ordered kaeng tai plaa , &quot;fish kidney curry&quot;, a really freaking spicy curry that tastes much better than it sounds, served over the same rice noodles:

 

I ordered the same curry, along with a side of khua kling neua , beef simmered in curry paste, served over rice:

 

Also really freaking spicy.

Here are the shopowners, two ladies from Phuket, in the midst of a lot of predominately orange-colored, really freaking spicy southern Thai food:

click on the image Was on my way to somewhere else and stopped by the tiny town/province of Saraburi, about 100 km north of Bangkok. Saraburi is mostly known for its dairy industry, and is the first place Thai people started milking cows, about 40 years ago. Other than that, it&apos;s not known for much, but I came across a couple cool food surprises nonetheless.

My first discovery was a Thai snack called karee phap . This is, believe it or not, the Thai pronunciation of the English word &quot;curry puff&quot;, and refers to small deep-fried turnovers. These bad boys are sold in the thousands along the main street of Saraburi, mostly sold at roadside stalls like this:

 

Many of the vendors were Muslim, which is not surprising when one considers how much they resemble samosa. The curry puffs are filled with a variety of fillings, ranging from savory, such as chicken or pork, to sweet, such as pineapple or chocolate:

 

They are all made by hand:

 

and deep-fried until crispy. Here&apos;s a close up of my pork and shitake mushroom curry puff:

 

Not too shabby, and I like the &quot;layered&quot; effect of the dough. Bought four (two pork and shitake and two &quot;original chicken&quot;), which at a paltry 5 baht each, almost made me feel guilty. Interestingly enough, the word karee is also Thai slang for prostitute. Would be curious to find out the origins of that.

Another fun discovery in Saraburi was the roadside stalls selling local agricultural products:

 

These can be found in rural areas all over the country, and vary depending on where you are. In northern Thailand you can find things like freshly-picked wild mushrooms or wild honey. In Saraburi the emphasis was on bamboo and pumpkins:

 

 

In the top photo the small bamboo was grilled, something I&apos;d never seen before. Unfortunately I&apos;m not currently in need of giant pumpkin or a bamboo root, and only took photos.

My final discovery came while looking for lunch on the hardscrabble streets of Saraburi. Other than karee phap, the food situ in Saraburi is pretty grim, and I it took me a long time to find something that wasn&apos;t wrapped and deep-fried. Eventually I came across a shop selling beef noodle soup. This is not something I would normally choose, as beef in Thailand is invariably chewy, usually consisting of fat and joints rather than meat, and the broth that accompanies this soup is usually way too sweet. However, this place served beef that was par-boiled to perfection, and accompanied by &quot;homemade&quot; beef balls that were tender and delicious:

 

Throw in a few more veggies and you got yerself a damn good bowl of noodles.

click on the image I spent the previous four days up in the former Thai kingdom of Sukhothai. Going up to this northern city wasn&apos;t a food trip per se, but being that I was traveling with Thai people, food was always at hand. Basically we would get up, eat breakfast, stop for coffee, find a snack, eat lunch, find more snacks and eat a huge dinner. Repeat for three days.

Sukhothai is not really a food destination, but there&apos;s some interesting stuff there if you know what to look for. With some free time on our hands the first night, we stopped by Sukhothai&apos;s fresh market to see what was going on. Here&apos;s a busy curry vendor:

 

Freshwater fish has been an important food of the people of this region for a very long time, and was included in virtually each of our meals. Here&apos;s some of the raw ingredients being sold at the evening market:

 

The next day we got up early to check out the ruins of the nearby Sri Satchanalai Historical Park. Luckily for us, there was a small market going on right near the ruins. We thus ordered some coffee prepared the traditional way:

 

To give you an idea of the setting, this is what dominated the vendor&apos;s view:

 

The weather at Sukhothai Historical Park was hot so we stopped for a cool snack. Can anyone guess what this is?

 

I&apos;ll give you a hint: take a couple scoops of homemade coconut ice cream, some sticky rice, peanuts, sweetned condensed milk, and put it between two slices of white bread. What do you have? An ice cream sandwich, of course!

Outside of Sukhothai we stopped at Hat Saa, a small town known for its silk weaving industry, and also home to a pretty good restaurant serving dishes using some of the local ingredients. Among other things, we ordered kaeng paa muu paa , &quot;jungle&quot; curry with boar:

 

And yam yawt maphrao awn , a &quot;salad&quot; of tender coconut shoots:

 

One of our last stops was at a place that sells Sukhothai-style noodles. These are really popular and quite well known, but as far as I could tell, are pretty much the same as noodles sold in Bangkok except that they included a variety of pork (barbequed pork, par-boiled pork and stewed pork ribs) and came topped with thinly-sliced par-boiled green beans:

 

Much more interesting, and more delicious, was the &quot;Sukhothai-style&quot; phat thai, which despite Sukhothai being at least 400 km away from the sea, included prawns:

This chap comes every Saturday and sells candies that he shapes out of sugar himself.

 

The wooden base holds a small coal oven used to heat up and soften the sugar mixture that is held in a metal bowl. When it&apos;s soft enough he takes a bamboo stick and a glob of each color:

 

and twists it into the shapes he desires, using nothing but his fingers and a pair of scissors to do the details:

 

Today he had parrots, hearts and flowers. I asked him to make a custom one for me and he made this elephant:

 

Another interesting thing at the market is the kung ten salesguy:

 

The sign says &quot;Kung Ten Salad. Fresh and clean.&quot; Kung ten literally means &quot;dancing shrimp&quot;, and refers to tiny freshwater shrimp that are sold while still alive:

 

You can&apos;t tell in the photo, but they are bouncing around all the time, thus the name. These are popular in NE Thailand, especially in the provinces near the Mekong River, where I imagine they&apos;re raised in cages. Here&apos;s a closeup of the shrimp:

 

He sells them by the bag, makes them into yam , a spicy-sour salad, or deep-fries them until crispy. I&apos;ve had them before and they really don&apos;t taste like much. I think the attraction lies in the thrill of eating something that&apos;s alive!

click on the image For dinner tonight we visted Koyi, a popular open-airish restaurant near my house. This restaurant is a bit unusual in that it only serves a few different dishes, mostly an odd mixture of somewhat traditional Chinese and Thai dishes. Here&apos;s the entire menu:

 

I ordered khao phat poo , fried rice with crab:

 

Delicious. They fry the rice in a wok over a large flame, which gives it a slightly smoky flavor. The whole dish consists of just rice, crab, eggs and perhaps a splash of fish sauce, and is served with sides of sliced cucumber, green onions and a slice of lime to squeeze over it.

Khuat ordered kaphoh plaa :

 

The name of this dish translates as &quot;fish stomach&quot;, which oddly enough, some people consider food. The dried fish stomach is suspended in a thick sweet broth topped with crab meat and a quail egg. Bizarre. Never really been a fan of the stuff.

Needing a bit more I ordered green curry with grilled pork served with khanom jeen , fermented rice noodles, instead of the usual rice:

 

Pretty good, but a bit too meaty and sweety for my taste. Like the green color though.

 To see the full image or to start a slideshow,
click on the image The area surrounding this street, also known as ari, is one of Bangkok&apos;s food hotspots. It&apos;s located near lots of very tall office buildings, which means during lunch there are lots of very hungry office workers. The general atmosphere of most of the restaurants is decidedly basic. No, perhaps assertively basic. No air-conditioning, grumpy staff, predominately plastic furniture and not the cleanest restaurants in the world. The food is cheap, however, and most of it looked pretty good.

Here&apos;s a bird&apos;s eye view of the street:

 

Once you enter the street, then take the first side street to the left (the one the green and yellow taxi is turning into). I can&apos;t recall the name, but this is where most of the action is. It was here that I saw all of these people were queing up to buy mangoes and guavas:

 

Normally mangoes and guavas aren&apos;t the source of this sort of frenzy. Howeve on closeer inspection I noticed they were peeled, which means they were probably chae buay , meaning that they have been soaked in sweetened plum water, and are really, really tasty.

Here&apos;s a well-stocked fruit stand:

 

And a well-stocked som tam (papaya salad) vendor:

 

And a Chinese pork vendor counting his profits:

 

This lady blocked my shot a chicken rice restaurant, making it somehow much more interesting:

 

All this was making me hungry so I stopped by a curry shop for lunch. I choose three things from the approximately 20 already prepared curries, fried dishes and soups, and got this:

 

I don&apos;t think my dish has ever been piled to this extent in Thailand. At 9 0&apos;clock you have pumpkin fried with egg, at 12 o&apos;clock phat phet plaa duk , catfish fried with fresh herbs, and at 3 o&apos;clock fish fried with onions, chilies and copious crushed black pepper. Somewhere under all of that there&apos;s some rice as well, if memory doesn&apos;t fail me.

click on the image Seeing as this dish was mentioned in the previous post, I thought I post the recipe here. It&apos;s really a no-brainer and requires a few simple ingredients and a wok, but is one of my favorite Thai dishes. However I should clarify that when I say pumpkin I&apos;m not talking about jack 0&apos;lanterns , but rather Thai-style gourd-like pumpkins, which look like this:

 

I reckon you can use a Western-style pumpkin if that&apos;s all you&apos;ve got, but to maintain authenticity, see if you can get your mitts on the real thing.

Pumpkin Fried with Egg
(Serves 4)

 

Ingredients
Pumpkin 500 g, cut into 3 cm cubes
Eggs 4
Cooking oil 2 Tbsp
Sugar 1 tsp, or to taste
Fish sauce 1 Tbsp, or to taste

Thai basil leaves (bai horaphaa) for garnish

Method
Bring 1 l of water to boil in a large saucepan, and boil pumpkin until soft but not mushy, about 5-7 minutes. Drain and set aside.

While pumpkin is boiling lightly beat eggs together in a bowl. Set aside.

In a large wok over medium heat, add oil and fry pumpkin until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add sugar and fish sauce, stir to combine. Pour eggs over pumpkin and allow to set, without stirring, for about two minutes. Continue to cook at low heat, stirring mixture only occasionally.

Serve hot, garnished with basil leaves, with rice as part of a southern Thai meal.

 At a grass jelly factory, the secrets behind the popular dessert are revealed. 

Perhaps you’ve encountered a Thai dessert consisting of small black cubes of jelly served with crushed ice. Like me, you probably took one look and said “no thanks”, opting for something a bit, well…less black and jellylike. Next time however, I urge you to try that dessert. It’s called grass jelly, and is actually a pure and delicious product. And if you believe the manufacturer, a very healthy product as well.

 
 A bowl of grass jelly at a Kamphaeng Phet restaurant. 

I recently became aware of grass jelly on a trip to the city of Kamphaeng Phet. The dessert, which Thais call chao kuay, seemed especially popular there, and on a whim I stopped by Chao Kuay Chakangrao, a small grass jelly factory. Arriving unannounced I was greeted warmly by the company’s owner, Sermwut Suwanroj, who was happy to take me around his factory and reveal how this unique dessert is made.

Suwanroj has been making grass jelly full time for a little over three years. He claims that it was his success that inspired the grass jelly craze that seems to have swept over Kamphaeng Phet. “I was the first one to make it here,” he explains. “All the others followed after me.” Suwanroj’s business is not limited to this small northern city though, and his product is sold in Bangkok and even abroad.

 
 Sermwut Suwanroj, owner of Chao Kuay Chakangrao, shows a pot of the fresh herb used to make grass jelly. 

Having heard that grass jelly comes from everything ranging from tree bark to grass, I began by asking Suwanroj what the stuff is actually made of. He replied by pointing to a small potted plant resembling mint. I knelt down to smell it, but unlike mint the herb had virtually no fragrance. Suwanroj explained that it isn’t until the herb is dried for a year that its odor is apparent. He goes on that his single potted plant is a mere decoration. “We get most of the herb from Vietnam, China and Indonesia,” he explained. “Very little is grown in Thailand. The conditions just aren’t right.”

 
 The dried herb used to make grass jelly is imported from China and Vietnam. 

We enter his factory and I am shown blocks of the dried herb, which is thoroughly rinsed of dirt several times before entering the first phase of grass jelly production. This involves boiling the herb in water for two to three hours in an effort to extract the fragrant oils. This is done by hand in large barrels over charcoal-burning stoves, much as it would have been done in the past. After three hours the liquid has developed a sticky, glue-like consistency, and the unmistakable earthy, medicine-like odor of grass jelly has flooded the open-air room.

 
 The dried herb must be boiled for two to three hours to extract its fragrant resin.

 The next step involves pressing and straining the thick liquid, which at this point resembles something like crude oil. The strained liquid is blended with a small amount of flour and put into a large steam-powered mixer where it is kneaded for one hour. The smooth jellylike liquid that results is then spread out onto several shallow trays where it is left to cool and solidify. 

 
 The resin is then extracted (shown above) before being filtered, blended and cooled into jelly-like sheets. 

The final step in production involves simply cutting the solid mixture into small squares, which are packaged with syrup. At this point Suwanroj offers me a bowl of grass jelly, which in the Thai style, is served with crushed ice. Suwanroj’s grass jelly is more fragrant and slightly toothier than grass jelly I’ve had in the past. I find the dessert a tad too sweet, but immensely refreshing, especially on this hot morning. This is hardly surprising, as the herb used to make grass jelly is in fact in the mint family, and is known by the Chinese for its cooling or “yin” properties. 

While I enjoy my treat, Suwanroj expels the supposed health benefits of grass jelly. “It lowers your blood pressure, it cures colds, and helps to cure infections and relieve diabetes.” He explains that it is particularly beneficial to drink the boiled herb as a kind of tea. I am skeptical, but I can’t imagine a more appropriate spokesperson for grass jelly than this vibrant and enthusiastic man.
 
Before leaving I express a desire to by some grass jelly to take home and ask how long it will last. “Our chao kuay contains no preservatives,” explains Suwanrot, implying that it should be consumed soon. “I’m not doing this to make money,” he adds, “I make grass jelly to make customers healthy.”

My first view of Kamphaeng Phet was from a bus bound for Sukhothai. I was considering getting off to explore the small northern provincial capital, but when I finally saw the town—seemingly not much more than a highway bordered with a few utilitarian shops—I changed my mind and decided to continue to my original destination.
 
It was only later that I learned that Kamphaeng Phet’s bus station is located a few kilometers outside the town, and offers no suggestion of the city. Returning to Kamphaeng Phet recently for a closer look, I discovered that the city is both atmospheric and interesting, home to impressive Buddhist ruins, an attractive riverfront setting, and some excellent Thai food.
Kamphaeng Phet literally means “diamond wall”, a reference to the unbreakable strength of this formerly walled city’s protective barrier. This level of security was necessary, as the city previously helped to protect the Sukhothai and later Ayuthaya kingdoms against attacks from Burma or Lanna. Parts of the wall can still be seen today, and the former moat, which was used for irrigation as much as protection, is currently being rebuilt.

The Kamphaeng Phet of today has expanded far outside its former walls, but is still located on the banks of the Ping River. The riverfront area is a focus of the city, and is home to a vibrant night market and a recently remodeled promenade. Taking a walk one evening I saw joggers, couples cuddling under palm trees, and in what initially appeared to be some sort of trompe l’oeil, a group of teenagers playing soccer on a submerged island in the middle of the river.

 
 Playing football in the shallows of the Ping River. 

I was fortunate to have my own vehicle, and a bit of exploring revealed that Kamphaeng Phet is pleasanter than most provincial capitals. Although Bangkok-style concrete architecture dominates, a surprisingly large amount of old wooden houses can be seen, of which Kamphaeng Phet even has its own architectural style, defined by a slightly peaked roof topped with terracotta tiles. The greatest concentration of wooden buildings can be found along the northern end of Tesa Road. Another architectural highlight of the city is the hor trai or manuscript depository of Wat Khuu Yang. Built during the 19th century, this graceful wooden building in the Rattanakosin style is located above a fish pond.

 
 The hor trai, or book depository of Wat Khuu Yang was built during the 19th century. 

However the main attraction of the city, and indeed the province, are the impressive but relatively little-visited ruins. Begun in the 14th century, roughly the same time as the better-known kingdom of Sukhothai, Kamphaeng Phet’s Buddhist monuments continued to be built until the Ayuthaya period, nearly 200 years later. As a result, the ruins possess elements of both Sukhothai and Ayuthaya styles, resulting in a school of Buddhist art unlike anywhere else in Thailand.

 
 The remains of Wat Phra Kaew are still have examples of the Kamphaeng Phet school of Buddhist artwork. 

The ruins of Kamphaeng Phet are found in two separate areas. Those located inside the city walls were inhabited by monks of the gamavasi (“living in the community”) sect, and are dominated by the remains of Wat Phra Kaew. This former Buddhist temple showcases some impressive Buddha statues and a stupa decorated by some modern but less attractive restoration work. The combination of Ayuthaya and Sukhothai styles is particularly evident here, with bell-shaped chedis reminiscent of Sukhothai and a reclining Buddha similar to that found in Ayuthaya.

 
 The remains of Wat Phra Kaeo combine elements of both Sukhothai and Ayuthaya-era styles. 

Near these ruins is the Kamphaeng Phet National Museum, a small but decent collection of antiques mostly associated with the ruins. The highlight here is an ancient bronze sculpture of Shiva that was unearthed where the city pillar now stands.

 
 Making an offering at Kamphaeng Phet&apos;s city pillar. 

The majority of Kamphaeng Phet’s ruins are found a few kilometers outside of the city walls in area previously home to monks of the arani (“living in forests”) sect. There are at least 40 temple compounds in this area, including Wat Chang Rop, named for its base that boasts 68 elephants, and remarkably, a few patches of relatively intact stucco relief work. Another standout is Wat Phra Si Iriyabot, which has a four-faced altar that once held a reclining, a sitting, a standing and a walking Buddha. Today the towering standing Buddha is the only one remaining, although elements of the graceful Sukhothai influenced walking Buddha can also be discerned.

 
 Wat Phra Si Iriyabot is home to four-faced monument of which this standing Buddha is the only intact example. 

Wat Phra Non, another temple in the area, is known for possessing the largest single laterite pillar in the world. Laterite, a clay-like material that is abundant in Kamphaeng Phet, hardens when exposed to light and air, and served as the primary building material for the majority of Kamphaeng Phet’s religious structures.

 
 Wat Chang Rop is named after the 68 elephants that surround the base of its chedi. 

The historical park also boasts an excellent brand-new visitors’ center, which also doubles as Kamphaeng Phet’s tourist information office. The center, possibly the best of its kind in the entire country, offers films, interactive computer presentations and displays, all offering clear English. Like many of the attractions in Kamphaeng Phet, the ruins are best accessed by those who have their own transportation, although there are bicycles for rent at the visitors’ center.

After all this exploring I was hungry, and although Kamphaeng Phet is not known as a food destination, I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. The city’s most famous contribution to Thai food is kluay khai, small sweet-tasting bananas. However much more interesting is Kamphaeng Phet’s famous egg noodles. At Bamee Chakangrao on Ratchadamnoen Road I ordered a bowl of bamee haeng, which contained at least six different preparations and cuts of pork (barbecued, par-boiled, stewed, skin, liver and deep-fried pork crackling), as well as sides of a slightly sweet broth and a bowl of par-boiled green beans and bean sprouts. The noodles used are reminiscent of smooth higher quality Chinese-style noodles, rather than the pasty yellow noodles found across much of the country.

 
 Egg noodles with various cuts of pork is a signature dish of Kamphaeng Phet. 

If noodles aren’t your thing, Kamphaeng Phet is also home to an impressive night market. Located on Tesa Road near the banks of the Ping River, this covered area is open from about 5 PM to late, and features an enormous selection of food sold to go, as well as several basic restaurants. I sat down to an excellent phat phet muu paa, spicy boar stir-fry served on a heaping mound of rice and reflected on my luck. What at first appeared nothing more than a gritty bus stop turned out to be a worthwhile diversion, perhaps even a destination.

I began with kaeng paa look chin plaa kraay , &quot;jungle&quot; curry with fishballs made from a type of freshwater fish:

 

Although it looks pretty, I&apos;ve et better. This one was a bit too bland and sight too salty.

I also ordered yam hoy naang rom , a &quot;salad&quot; of raw oysters:

 

I always order this dish, forgetting that I don&apos;t really like this dish. Actually it&apos;s not bad, but I don&apos;t really care for yam that employ that sweetish, red sauce. I would much rather have the simple mixture of lime juice, chilies, fish sauce and sugar, as illustrated in painstaking detail here .

Khuat ordered pet phalo , duck stewed in Chinese-style spices:

 

For me this dish is like the Thai equivalent of steak; a big hunk of meat. Not bad, but boring.

She also ordered phat phak boong fai daeng , flash-fried morning glory:

 

God, I love this stuff. It&apos;s everything I like in food: spicy, crunchy, garlicky, salty, and it&apos;s veggies. I eat it so often I think it should constitute a whole other food group for me.

And finally in an moment of feeding frenzy that was later regretted, we also ordered ahaan thale luak , a variety of seafood par-boiled and served with two dipping sauces:

 

Not bad, but there are places that do this much better .

 A rolling tour of the tastes of Khao Yai. 

Despite being home to just two wine-producing vineyards, the area known as the Khao Yai Valley has gained a reputation as Thailand’s wine country. Although essentially accurate, the label is somewhat pre-emptive as it implies a degree of development and refinement that simply hasn’t been reached yet. As of now, much of the food and wine-based tourism is still in its early stages, but the basics are there, and being less than two hours from Bangkok, has the potential to be a unique weekend getaway.

 
 Young vines at PB Valley, the Khao Yai area&apos;s largest winery. 

With this in mind, I head north one morning with the aim of spending a weekend discovering and tasting what Thailand’s fledgling wine country has to offer. After a mere hour and a half, I stopped by Dairy Home (044 361 841), a small dairy/restaurant just off the main highway. Dairy Home is located in Muak Lek district, the site of yet another European-style food import: dairy farming. It was in this same area that Thailand’s dairy industry was started nearly 40 years ago, and not surprisingly, the restaurant offers fresh organic milk products, as well as a decent a breakfast set with homemade bread, sausage and butter and good coffee.

After breakfast I continue along the hilly roads that cut across the Khao Yai Valley to GranMonte Vineyards , a family-owned estate and one of the two wine producing vineyards in the region. Located in a secluded corner that owners have christened Asoke Valley, the vineyard has been growing grapes for nearly eight years. At Montino, the vineyard’s “cellar”, my companion and I sample four red wines, all of the shiraz/syrah varietal, the dominant grape of the Khao Yai valley. GranMonte’s 2002 “Celebration” vintage was for me the most balanced of the lot, featuring both full body and a strong but pleasant aroma.

 
 Some of the wines available at GranMonte Vinyards. 

Impressed by the gorgeous setting, we decided to have lunch at VinCotto, the vineyard’s attractive restaurant. VinCotto’s menu was designed by one of the estate’s owners, and features a relatively short menu of dishes meant to be taken with GranMonte’s wines. I begin with the soft shell crab salad, a plate of iceberg lettuce topped with an immense soft shell crab and oddly enough, several onion rings. Unfortunately even the winery’s decent but overpriced 2003 chenin blanc wasn’t enough to help this dish. Somewhat better was my main course, spiced shoulder of lamb sautéed with garlic and served over fettuccini. My companion made a better choice and enjoyed her spicy squid-ink spaghetti.

In general the weekend revealed that most attempts at Western-style food in the Khao Yai valley are forgettable, and the prices less so. A much better choice is, not surprisingly, Thai food, and one of the most popular restaurants in the area is Narknava (02 253 2455) a decidedly basic restaurant serving Thai-Muslim dishes. The restaurant is known for its 100-baht chicken biryani, which judging by the number of customers, is worth the price. We enjoyed a dish of spiced rice coupled with a fried fish and a bowl of piquant chicken soup, both spicy and delicious. Being a Muslim restaurant there’s not a drop of wine—or any other alcohol—to be seen.

From there we wound our way to PB Valley , the area’s largest vineyard, and our base for the weekend. PB Valley, whose grapes are used to produce wines under the Khao Yai and Pirom labels, is also home to a resort consisting of a few mock-Tudor “villas” perched on a hillside overlooking the vineyard as well as much of the valley. The rooms were basic but comfortable, and part of the fun lied in their almost remote location deep in the vineyard, and the scenic drive it took to reach them.

 
 Grapes at PB Valley. 

For dinner we visited the resort’s restaurant, The Hornbill Grill. Although the menu features a few German-style dishes, we decided to go Thai, and ordered a few of the recommended dishes. As most of Khao Yai’s wines are relatively high in alcohol and body, this is not a problem, as the wines are made to tolerate the heat of Thai cooking. We ordered deep-fried tapean fish in spicy Thai sauce, a dish that more closely resembled the Isaan dish laab than a fried fish. We also enjoyed the fried boar with baby pepper and the spicy enoki mushroom salad with shrimp. These dishes were helped along by a bottle of Pirom tempranillo 2004, a red wine from grapes of Spanish origin that is probably the region’s finest bottle.

Waking up early the next morning, we left the car behind and explored the vineyard on foot. Strolling among the seemingly endless rows of grapes, it took the occasional banana tree or tropical bird to remind me I was still in Thailand. The vineyard, like much of the surrounding area, takes the form of a rolling valley edged by forested mountains and gray limestone cliffs, a setting made even more beautiful by the rugged symmetry of rows of grape vines.

 
 PB Valley. 

After breakfast I met with Prayut Piangbunta, a youthful native of Chiang Mai who is the Khao Yai Winery’s resident winemaker. Piangbunta also happens to be the country’s only Thai winemaker, and has agreed to show us his winery. We are taken from room to room while Piangbunta describes the wine making process and the functioning of the equipment. At one point we stop to taste the 2006 vintage, still being held in towering stainless steel tanks. Piangbunta gives me a glass of 100% colombard, which despite its cloudy appearance, is deliciously crisp and fruity, causing me look forward to its release in 2008. “I let the wine reflect the vintage,” explains Piangbunta of his winemaking philosophy. “I don’t add sugar or acid, I let the yeast make the wine. 
Although at present, going behind the scenes at Khao Yai Winery is only possible by appointment, Piangbunta is working on plans to offer tours on a regular basis in the near future. For now, visitors will have to make due with the wine tastings that are given every weekend and the occasional tour.

With the end of our weekend drawing near, we reluctantly leave PB and stop for a light lunch at the Fabb Fashion Café . The restaurant is one of a growing number of Bangkok-based establishments opening branches in the area. I order an Italian sausage salad with balsamic vinegar, an odd combination that was oddly satisfying. Our waiter told us that the prices at Khao Yai are significantly cheaper than those of the restaurant’s Bangkok counterpart, which already seemed expensive given the rural setting.

Another import is the popular Bangkok-based chain, Cabbages and Condoms . Run under the auspices of the Population and Community Development Association (PDA), the leafy open-air restaurant features local ingredients such as mushrooms from a nearby mushroom farm and fresh herbs from the resort’s pesticide-free garden.

After a final drive through the hills, it was time to head back to Bangkok. Although the Khao Yai Valley wine district may not yet live up to its label, it is by all means a fun getaway and a beautiful destination, and possibly an early glimpse at what may in the future be a bona fide wine district.

 A lesson on Thailand&apos;s nam phrik kapi. 

The first Thai dish I ever learned to make is probably the simplest Thai dish of all: Using a mortar and pestle, grind up a few small chilies with a couple cloves of garlic, squeeze in the juice of a lime, add sugar and a heaping spoonful of the pungent shrimp paste known as kapi, and mash this mess together until a thick gray muck results. The result: nam phrik kapi, one of the most common dishes in central Thailand.

 

Nam phrik, literally “chili water”, is the name of a family of spicy dips or relishes from Thailand. Normally eaten with rice and fresh or parboiled vegetables, nam phrik are well known to all Thais, but rarely seem to make it out of the country, and can even be hard to find in Thai restaurants in Thailand. They are generally homemade, often prepared using a well-worn granite mortar and pestle, and the recipes are as numerous as the chefs who grind them.

Nam phrik are probably among Thailand’s oldest recipes, and along with a curry or soup and a fried dish, are one of the essential elements of a “complete” Thai meal. The dish has even penetrated into the vernacular; a Thai friend recently told me he was “kin nam phrik jaak thuay derm”, literally, always eating nam phrik from the same bowl, an oblique way of saying that he was bored in his relationship.

 

Stripped down to its most basic elements, a nam phrik will usually encompass all of the four Thai tastes: salty, sweet, spicy and sour, although the various ingredients added to produce these flavors vary greatly. In general though, chilies, especially the tiny but pungent phrik khii nuu (“mouse shit chilies”) are used to add the heat, fresh-squeezed lime juice to add the sour flavor, and sugar, especially a kind of raw palm sugar called nam taan piib, to add the sweet taste. Some nam phrik are even flavored with maengdaa, a type of insect that secretes a fruit-like essence that is not as entirely unpleasant as it sounds. There are also “dry” nam phrik, which usually incorporate shallots, garlic, dried chilies and dried shrimp, all fried in oil until crispy, then ground together, and possessing such evocative names as nam phrik narok (“Hell Chili Paste”).

Nam phrik are probably the most regionally variable of Thailand’s foods, and one can usually tell what area of Thailand one is in simply by looking at the nam phrik on the dinner table. Northern Thais, fond of their vegetables, take the slender dark green chilies known as phrik num, roast them along with garlic and shallots, and mash the results together in the dish known as nam phrik num. This nam phrik is traditionally served with parboiled vegetables and deep-fried pork crackling, another northern Thai specialty. In far southern Thailand, the aforementioned nam phrik kapi is an obligatory side dish in most restaurants, and because the southern version tends to be much spicier than in Bangkok it is usually served with “cooling” vegetables such as cucumber. And finally, in the northeastern region of Thailand, nam phrik is often made with plaa raa, a mud-like, unfiltered, unpasteurized fish paste with a smell and taste even more pungent than that of kapi. The most basic nam phrik of all is nam plaa phrik: a small saucer of fish sauce mixed with thinly sliced chilies, and sometimes sliced garlic and lime juice, a rough equivalent to the salt shaker in western countries.

 

Despite the variety, the single unifying element of nam phrik is in the manner in which they are eaten, and although some extravagant versions exist, the majority are eaten with a simple assortment of raw or parboiled vegetables. This typically ranges from cucumbers to long green beans or eggplants, but can also include different regional fresh herbs or roots, such as white turmeric or sawtooth coriander. In parts of Thailand where steamed rice is eaten, one or two vegetables are placed on a small amount of rice, the nam phrik spooned over this, and the entire package is consumed using a spoon. In other regions where people tend to eat sticky rice, such as the north and northeast of Thailand, the vegetables as well as the rice are individually dipped into the nam phrik by hand, and followed by a bit of sticky rice, also eaten using the hands.

Recipes:

Nam Plaa Phrik
This is the most basic form of the family of spicy relishes known as nam phrik in Thailand. Nam plaa phrik is spooned over one’s rice to spice up bland food, much the way salt is used in the west.

3 tablespoons Thai fish sauce (nam plaa)
3+ phrik khii nuu (very small Thai chilies), sliced in rings as thinly as possible
1 clove garlic, sliced
1/2 lime

Put the fish sauce in a shallow dish, add chilies, garlic, and squeeze lime juice to taste.

Nam Phrik Kapi with Fresh and Fried Vegetables

 

Nam Phrik Kapi is probably the most well known nam phrik in Thailand. As the name suggests, it is made with kapi, a salted and fermented paste of fine shrimp known as khoei, and is always served with fresh and/or parboiled vegetables, as well as egg-battered deep-fried vegetables, as described below. The amount of ingredients listed below for the nam phrik are largely for reference; a Thai chef would virtually never use measuring instruments to cook, and a dish is usually made to taste, keeping in mind a desired balance of the four tastes: sour, spicy, salty and sweet.

3+ phrik khii nuu (very small Thai chillies)
1 tablespoon garlic
1 tablespoon sugar
1 squeezed lime (about 1 tablespoon of juice)
1/4 cup Kapi (Thai shrimp paste)
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons makheua phuang (pea-sized Thai eggplant)

4 eggs
1 Chinese or Japanese eggplant, sliced into 1 cm thick rounds and put in a bowl of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of vinegar to prevent browning
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 bunch of cha om (a pungent vegetable sometimes available frozen in Thai grocery stores)

An assortment of fresh Thai vegetables, such as eggplant, cabbage, carrot, wing bean, long bean, all cut into long bite-size pieces

Using a mortar and pestle, grind the phrik khii nuu with the garlic until a rough paste is formed. Add the sugar and the lime juice and grind together. Add the shrimp paste and continue grinding until a paste forms. Add water. If the mixture is still too thick, add additional water, a teaspoonful at a time (nam phrik kapi should have the consistency of a slightly watery paste). Taste and add more chilies, lime or sugar, to taste. Add the makheua phuang, breaking slightly, but not grinding, with the pestle. Put nam phrik kapi in a serving bowl.

Beat eggs with a few drops of fish sauce or a pinch of salt, divide into two bowls and set aside. Drain eggplant and mix thoroughly with one of the bowls of egg. Heat cooking oil in a wok and taking two or three slices at a time, fry the eggplant in oil on both sides until crispy. Set on paper towels to drain. Remove the tender cha om leaves and blend with the eggs. Fry mixture in hot oil as a thick omelet or frittata, turning over to cook on both sides. Drain on a paper towel until cool then slice into bite-sized squares.

Arrange the fresh and fried vegetables on a plate and serve with rice and bowl of nam phrik kapi.

Nam Phrik Ong

 

Nam Phrik Ong is a dish that originates from the Tai Yai or Shan, a Thai ethnic group that lives in northern Thailand and Myanmar. Ong means to fry in the Tai Yai dialect, and the dish makes use of pork and tomatoes, both staples of Tai Yai cooking. Nam phrik ong is now eaten among all northern Thais, regardless of ethnicity.

Chili Paste
7 large dried chilies, soaked in warm water until soft
3 peeled shallots
1 head of garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons chopped lemongrass (using only lower white part)
2 tablespoons of shrimp paste
1 teaspoon salt

1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
2 large cloves of garlic, chopped

1/2 cup ground pork
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

Fresh, crispy vegetables such as cucumber, long beans, wing beans, cabbage, sliced or chopped into bite-size pieces
Pork rinds

Using a mortar and pestle or food processor, blend curry paste ingredients together finely.

With the mortar and pestle, mash the tomatoes into the curry paste.

Heat oil in a wok over low heat. Add chopped garlic and fry until crispy. Add curry paste and tomato mixture and fry, constantly stirring, until the mixture begins to become fragrant, and oil begins to rise and accumulate, 5 to 10 minutes. Add pork and continue to stir until pork is fully cooked and the oil again begins to rise. If mixture seems dry at any point, add water, 1/4 cup at a time. Nam phrik ong should have the consistency and appearance of a thick, oily spaghetti sauce.

Serve in a bowl, sprinkled with cilantro, and serve with fresh vegetables, pork rinds, and sticky rice.

Nam Phrik Num

 

This is another northern style curry that has become popular among people all over Thailand. The main ingredient is phrik num, long slender green chilies that are almost exclusively used in this particular dish. Depending on the chilies used, the nam phrik can range from mild to mouth-searingly hot.

7 phrik num or other long green chili
10 cherry tomatoes
5 shallots
2 heads of garlic
1 teaspoon salt

8 bamboo skewers

Fresh vegetables, such as cucumber
Parboiled vegetables, such as cabbage, long beans, Thai eggplant, wing beans
Pork rinds

Skewer the chilies, tomatoes, shallots and garlic and grill until charred. When done, put all grilled ingredients in a plastic bag for 10 minutes and peel off burnt outside layer.

Using a mortar and pestle, grind salt and grilled ingredients together until blended, but still chunky (phrik num should ideally be in long strands or strips).

Serve in a bowl, with fresh and parboiled vegetables, pork rinds, and sticky rice.

 Exploring Saraburi, the country&apos;s curry puff capital. 

Travelers passing through the small town of Saraburi, about 100 km north of Bangkok, may have noticed the almost absurd abundance of a particular snack. Resembling a small round pocket of dough similar to an Indian samosa or a Mexican empanada, the dish is sold in countless shops in the town and is known in Thai as kalee pap. If this doesn’t ring a bell, it may help if I reveal that kalee pap is the Thai pronunciation of the English words “curry puff”, and is a snack with obscure origins that has become wholly associated with this otherwise unremarkable town.

 
 Curry puffs for sale at Renu, Saraburi. 

Being one of the first major towns one reaches when driving north from Bangkok, the streets at the southern end of Saraburi are strategically lined with shops selling this deep-fried snack. On my way through the town one day I was astonished by the amount of curry puffs for sale, as well as the amount of people buying, and decided to stop by to learn about the origin of the snack and what it is that makes it so popular.

I stop in for a few curry puffs at Renu, one of the many shops selling the snack, and speak with the owner, Somjai Likhananusorn. “I’ve been making kalee pap for about six years,” explains Likhananusorn, who has been cooking all her life. Today she makes 13 varieties of curry puff, selling them every day from 5 AM to 9 PM. She estimates that she makes more than 1,000 a day. “Our best selling kalee pap are chicken and pork. After that it’s our fruit-flavored ones,” she explains.

 
 At Renu, three people make the curry puff, each handling a different step. 

I ask why curry puffs are so popular in Saraburi, and Likhananusorn says that the snack actually originates in nearby Muak Lek district of Nakhorn Ratchasima province. “Travelers liked the snack but complained that they had to go all the way to Muak Lek to buy it,” explains Likhananusorn. She describes how somebody got the idea of selling the snack in Saraburi, which is conveniently located along the main north-south highway. In typical Thai fashion, this person’s success inspired an almost overnight rush of people to start set up their own curry puff shops, and today kalee pap are now more associated with Saraburi than their original home just up the road.

Making curry puffs is a time-consuming process that I am able to witness first-hand at Likhananusorn’s tiny shop. She explains that the best method involves the cooperation of three people, the first of whom rolls out two discs of dough into a flat sheet about the size of a hand. By rolling two discs of dough on top of each other the snack obtains its characteristic layered look when deep-fried. Likhananusorn’s daughter then fills the dough with a heaping tablespoon of filling and folds the curry puff into its rough shape. Likhananusorn then finishes the process by deftly twisting its edges into something like a ropelike braid to seal it.

 
 Somjai Likhananusorn, owner of Renu, gives the curry puffs a final twist. 

When a batch is ready, the curry puffs are then deep-fried for about 20 minutes in a specially designed deep fryer with two frying basins. Working as a team in this manner, Likhananusorn’s daughter estimates that they can make as many as 400 curry puffs in an hour.

I mention that that kalee pap are very similar to samosa, and that the majority of the vendors I saw selling the snack in Muak Lek were Muslim, which coupled with the name, seems to suggest that curry puffs are Indian or Muslim in origin. “I’ve been told that it’s a Muslim dish,” says Likhananusorn. “But their kalee pap are different, they use butter in the dough and they don’t eat pork.”

 

In any event, as the name suggests, Renu’s chicken kalee pap are seasoned with a liberal amount of curry powder. However, as a result of the intense competition in Saraburi, vendors have to be creative, and today kalee pap can be found with fillings diverse as pork and shitake musroom, and pineapple and raisin.

Upon leaving I am given a box of curry puffs to take home. Finding myself stuck in traffic on the way back to Bangkok, I can’t resist the urge to nibble on a few. Crunching through one, I realize that curry puffs really are the ideal road food. They’re small, savory, filling, and at five baht each, a terrific value. Now if they could only do something about the crumbs…

click on the image I was recently on Ko Samui. This was actually my first time there despite having lived in Thailand several years! I&apos;m not much of a beach person and initially wasn&apos;t very impressed by the island, but after renting a motorcycle and exploring for a few days, the place really grew on me. The native Ko Samui people are among the friendliest I&apos;ve ever met in Thailand, and the islands local cuisine was simply amazing.

I was on the island to do a story on the local cuisine for ThaiDay. That report will follow in the next week or so, but I was so excited about the food that I wanted to give a bit of a preview. Surprisingly, local food is quite hard to come by on Ko Samui. There are countless restaurants selling Japanese, German, English, Australian and Italian food, but there are only about six or so restaurants where local Ko Samui dishes are available. The most famous of which is almost certainly Bangpo Seafood (077 420 010), a low-key restaurant in the Maenam area. This place makes use of the more interesting local ingredients on Samui such as waay , a small octopus that is used fresh, or when out of season, dried:

 

At Pangpo Seafood waay is made into a thick stir-fry with coconut milk and fresh herbs:

 

Another unusual ingredient used by the locals is the eggs of the sea urchin. The raw roe is mixed with sour mango, chili paste, chilies and lime to make a yam , or Thai-style salad:

 

Fish also plays a big role, and ranges from tiny little &quot;anchovies&quot; deep-fried and served as an appetizer:

 

to larger fish, such as the one below, which as been coated with a mixture of coconut milk, fresh turmeric, black pepper and salt before being grilled over coals:

 

Coconut is Samui&apos;s largest crop and large stands of the tree can be found across the island:

 

The extracted milk from coconuts seems to find its way into nearly every local dish, as I learned when I met with Sermsi Thongrueang, a native of Samui and a woman with reputation as a good cook. She taught me how to make khao man thua khiaow , rice cooked with coconut milk, dried beans and salt:

 

And even grated a fresh coconut

 

to make khoei jii , a very unique appetizer of shrimp paste, shallots, garlic, coconut meat and chilies ground up, spread on a coconut shell and grilled:

 

Another good use of coconut was at Sabeinglae restaurant (077 233 083), near Malai. The restaurant serves a kaeng khua , a thick, rich coconut milk curry topped with fragrant cumin leaves:

 

The main ingredient in this curry was an acquatic creature called het loop:

 
 
Sabeinglae also serves an excellent dish similiar to the coconut-milk stir fry at Bangpo, but using squid and lots of crushed black pepper:

 

Samui is also home to some fun markets:

 

The green pods above are known in English as &quot;stink bean&quot;, and are very very popular in southern Thai cooking.

Here&apos;s the Muslim fishing village at Hua Thanon:

click on the image OK, this is going to be a big one. I just got back from six days in Hanoi, Vietnam and have a lot to share. I&apos;ve been to Vietnam before, but never Hanoi, and found it to be one of the craziest and most intense, but also most photogenic places I&apos;ve ever been. The food scene was definately interesting, but I think Graham at Noodlepie would probably agree with me if I said it wasn&apos;t as diverse or delicious as Saigon&apos;s. Nonetheless, it&apos;s still Vietnam, which invariably means good eats.

Probably the most famous Vietnamese dish of all is in fact a Hanoi dish:

 

Yes, pho. This beef noodle soup is available almost everywhere, from shops:

 

to the streets:

 

It&apos;s popular for breakfast, but I prefered this dish, which here in Thailand is known as khao kriap paak maw :

 

The dish is made by spreading rice flour and water mixture over a hot surface:

 

and the fresh &quot;noodle&quot; that results is then filled with pork and served with the dipping sauce and veggies seen above. Utterly delicious.

Other than pho, undoubtedly the most common dish in Hanoi is bun cha, grilled pork served with sides of rice noodles, fresh herbs and a sweet/sour dipping sauce. This dish can be found at virtually every corner in the city:

 

as well as at proper restaurants, this one in the Old Quarter:

 

A similar dish is made with chim, pigeon, this on Ta Hien street, which Graham refers to as &quot;Pigeon Street&quot;!

 

I love morning markets, and a unusual one could be found on Pho Hang Be in the Old Quarter. The weird thing about this market is that at exactly 7 AM, all of the vendors suddenly got up and ran away! Where they went and why I&apos;m still not sure, but it made for some great photos:

 

 

Other things seen at this morning market were silkworm worms:

 

fruits:

 

and herbs:

 

A more or less stationary market is the Dong Xuan market, north of the Old Quarter:

 

 

 

 

 

Or if you chose, the market simply comes to you:

 

 

If you&apos;re thirsty after all this, then have a glass of freshly squeezed sugarcane juice:

 

Or a glass of beer at one of the many, many, many bia hoi (&quot;draught beer&quot;) joints:

 

Or if you&apos;re hungry, have a dish of deep-fried eels:

 

or maybe some other seafood:

 Southern city solves Thailand&apos;s morning blues with its Chinese dim sum breakfast buffets. 

Despite the diversity and ubiquity of its cuisine, breakfast in Thailand can often be a dreary sight. The old standby, rice soup, soon becomes tedious after the first couple starchy, stodgy bowls. The omnipresent “American breakfast” consisting typically of oily fried eggs, lighter-than-air white bread, curiously colored hot dogs and undercooked bacon is neither breakfast nor American. And the combination of instant coffee and the oily deep-fried dough known as pa thong ko are enough to send most foreigners running in the other direction. What’s a traveler to do? My suggestion: go to Trang.

 

Located in southern Thailand, the relatively little-visited city of Trang seems to thrive on breakfast alone. Populated mostly by Thais of Chinese origin, the residents of this city have made early morning eating a true delight with atmospheric cafés that haven’t changed in decades, great halls dedicated to dim sum, and old-fashioned coffee shop-slash-food courts combining both caffeine and food.

“There are at least 70 dim sum shops in Trang city,” estimates Ja, owner of Ruean Thai (075 219 342), one of the city’s best-known dim sum eateries. In his cavernous restaurant located slightly outside downtown Trang, early risers are blessed with a selection of more than 40 steamed dim sum items. “We make all our dim sum by hand,” he explains with evident pride. “Many other places just buy the frozen dim sum and steam it.”

 

Ruean Thai’s dim sum ranges from quail eggs wrapped in ground pork to plain tofu, and the protocol is much like other dim sum restaurants in the city. After choosing a seat, diners are presented with a large tray of deep-fried dim sum items. You choose what you want, then walk over to the steaming counter where you select your steamed dim sum, which are steamed to order in bamboo trays. Every order is accompanied by a bottomless pot of Chinese tea, and despite the dish’s Chinese origins, chopsticks are nowhere to be seen, the people of Trang favoring tiny forks.

 
 Steaming dim sum at Reuan Thai restaurant, one of the city&apos;s best known dim sum eateries. 

Along with dim sum, many of Trang’s restaurants also feature another dish not normally associated with breakfast, roast pork. “Before people in Trang didn’t eat roast pork every day,” explains Prasert Namphut, owner of Trang Muu Yaang, a popular restaurant that sells the dish. “Before, it was only for special occasions, or given as an offering on Chinese holidays.”

Nowadays however muu yang, roast pork, is available every day, and in virtually every restaurant. The dish is prepared by marinating an entire pig for eight hours in a mixture of Chinese spices and sauces. “The recipe we use comes from China, it’s an old one that has been used here in Trang for a long time,” explains Prasert. After being marinated, the entire pig is roast for two hours in a giant oven. This relatively short cooking time gives Trang’s roast pork a crispy, nearly charred texture, much unlike the tender, juicy meat that most Americans would associate with barbecued pork.

 

Every part of the pig is sold, including the head and feet, but the most popular part is undoubtedly the delicious but fatty belly. This cut includes a crispy outer layer of skin, a tender layer of white meat, soft fat and a charred layer of dark meat. The belly is chopped into small bite-sized squares and is served plain along with dim sum, or over rice. Trang Muu Yaang’s roast pork was assertively oily, and the marinade had a sweetness associated with that of American-style barbeque sauce.

Other restaurants featuring similar selections of dim sum and roast pork are the popular Phong Ocha (075 219 918) and Ko Lan (075 222 925). The roast pork at Ko Lan was somewhat spicy, suggesting coriander and cumin, and had little of the barbeque sauce sweetness of its neighbor. However the skin was shatteringly crispy, and overall a bit too fatty to stomach for breakfast. Despite the grease, Trang’s roast pork is so popular that is has become a souvenir, and most shops sell the dish in decorative take-away boxes.

 
 Trang Muu Yang serves dim sum and its popular specialty, roast pork, which is made using an old Chinese recipe. 

If all you need in the morning is a simple cup of coffee, then Trang is also well equipped with numerous old-world cafés. Known locally as raan kopi, the shops are almost exclusively owned by Thais of Chinese origin, and many seem suspended in time, sporting the same décor and selling the products they have for decades.

Perhaps the oldest surviving raan kopi, and undoubtedly the most atmospheric, is Yu Chiang, located on Praram 6 Road near the market. Although the owners aren’t exactly sure how old the shop is (one said 60, another 100 years old), it is obvious that the Yu Chiang has changed very little since the day it opened. Faded green paint from the restaurant’s last renovation (50 years ago?) is coupled with ancient marble-top tables and rickety wooden chairs. Adding to the atmosphere is the shop’s clientele of crusty old men of Chinese origin, aged monks, and laborers smoking hand-rolled cigarettes.

 
 Yu Chiang, a coffee shop in Trang, has changed little since its inception at least 60 years ago. 

The coffee at Yu Chiang is still made the old way, using a sock-like filter filled with locally grown and roasted beans, and water from a charcoal-burning stove. The only thing that seems to have changed is the prices. “Coffee used to cost one baht a glass,” explains Yu Chiang’s friendly barista. “That seemed like a lot back then. Now it costs 10 baht, and that’s nothing today!”

For those seeking food with their atmosphere and coffee, there is no better choice than Asia Ocha. Located on Kantang Road, not far from the train station. Asia Ocha is a combination coffee shop and food center of the kind that is still found in Singapore and Malaysia, but hardly exists any more in Thailand. “The shop is no less than 50 years old,” explains Somlak Theekhasenee, the second-generation owner. “You can tell if a coffee shop is really old by looking at the tables. If they’re marble, then the shop is old,” he explains.

 
 Making coffee the old-fashioned way, Yu Chiang coffee shop. 

Asia Ocha’s tables are indeed both marble and old, however Somlak is proud of the shop’s original price list, a stained document stating that, at the time of its printing, coffee cost one baht per cup. He seems oblivious to the fact that his shop is in serious need of a paint job, something doesn’t which doesn’t seem the concern the numerous diners slurping noodles to the sound of Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire”.

Other unique coffee shop/restaurants include that of the Koh Teng Hotel (075 218 148), a building dating back to 1948 and located on Rama 6, and Sin Ocha (075 211 191), just steps from Trang’s railway station. The latter offers the usual combination of food and coffee, but without much of the old-world atmosphere. Sin Ocha was originally opened in 1967, but recently underwent a significant renovation and suggests little of its former self. This is made up for by the excellent coffee, which is probably the best in town. Served the traditional way, in short glasses with a dose of sweetened condensed milk, the coffee at Sin Ocha is made in a modern espresso machine, and even features a thin “crema” of foam at the top.

When asked why coffee shops are so popular in Trang, Sin Ocha’s second-generation owner, Sutus Chayankiat, explains that, “In the old days most people in Trang were involved in harvesting rubber. Going to a café after work was a way of exchanging news and info.” Although the people of today’s Trang are involved in a variety of jobs, the city’s raan kopi and dim sum restaurants still largely serve this purpose, and provide a convenient meeting place for locals, and more importantly for us, good coffee and a decent breakfast.

click on the image Good northern Thai food is very, very hard to find in Bangkok. By comparison, Isaan (NE Thai) is available on every corner, and southern Thai on every third corner, but one really has to search hard to find northern Thai eats here. Fortunately for me, a place opened not far from my house serving some pretty darn good ahaan meuang (&quot;northern food&quot;). Can&apos;t remember the name, but it&apos;s located in a quasi-yuppie shopping complex called, bewilderingly, Plaza Lagoon.

We started with northern hors d&apos;oeuvres (that&apos;s actually what it was called in Thai), a platter of several dishes associated with northern Thai cooking:

 

As seen from above:

 

in the center you have nam phrik num , a &quot;dip&quot; of roasted chilies, shallots and garlic, at 12 o&apos;clock some par-boiled veggies that are meant to be eaten with the dip, at 3 o&apos;clock we&apos;ve got khor muu yaang , grilled pork collar, served here with a spicy dip (not really a northern dish per se, but done very well nonetheless), at 6 o&apos;clock is one of the most famous northern dishes of all, the herb and pork grilled sausage known as sai ua , and finally at 9 o&apos;clock, deep-fried pork rinds, another northern specialty, meant to be taken with the nam phrik num. The only loser in this lot was the nam phrik num, seemingly made a few days earlier and extremely limp and lifeless...

Next was kaeng phak waan plaa yaang , a soup/curry of phak waan (&quot;sweet vegetable&quot;, a leafy green that is significantly more green and leafy than it is sweet) and dried fish:

 

Very, very good. Actually one of the best Thai dishes I&apos;ve had in a long time. Like many northern Thai dishes, this soup makes somewhat unusual use of noodles, and is laden with glass jelly noodles.

And finally, this slightly blurry pic (sorry) is of another famous northern Thai dish, kaeng hang leh :

 

This is essentially a Burmese dish (hang being the Thai pronunciation of hin, the Burmese word for curry ) and employs hearty chunks of pork belly (including the skin and fat) in sweetish-sourish sauce that is eerily similar to US-style barbecue sauce. This is not the most flattering comparison, I know, but trust me, it tastes much better than it sounds (and looks). This dish is often made in great amounts for northern Thai festivals and religious ceremonies. This restaurant&apos;s version was pretty good, but a bit thin and somewhat too sweet.

All in all a pretty good eat. Not as good of course as dinner in Mae Hong Son , but just about as good as it gets in Bangkok. I&apos;ll be back.

click on the image Only a few days back from Hanoi and already longing for (good) spring rolls and banh xeo... Luckily the Thais like Vietnamese nosh as well, be it their own slightly different interpretation of it. Unfortunately Thai restaurants serving Vietnamese usually spin about four or five of the same dishes, most of which are illustrated below. (Oddly enough, pho, probably the most famous Vietnamese dish of all, is quite hard to find.) This usually makes for pretty predictable eating unless you find the odd place that really stands out, like I did today. The place is called Nong Khai (not this Nong Khai featured previously, although they have similiar menus), and has the best Vietnamese-Thai/Thai-Vietnamee I&apos;ve come across yet. Witness:

We started with deep-fried spring rolls:

 

Pretty darn good--comperable to stuff I ate in Hanoi actually. Although these were filled with ground pork, and I prefer the Vietnamese crab-filled variety.

Next was another Thai-Vietnamese staple and the restaurant&apos;s signature dish, naem nueang . This is a kind of grilled pork sausage:

 

served with chopped fruits and veggies (unripe banana, cucumber, garlic, unripe mango, chilies), rice paper, a peanut-based sauce and a tray of fresh herbs. You take a piece of lettuce and top it with the sausage and whatever else you fancy:

 

Again, this place did a really good version. The herbs were all fresh and clean, and the grilled sausage delicious. Usually I don&apos;t care for the peanut sauce as it can often be very sweet, but this one was just right.

Next was banh xeo, what Thais call khanom bueang yuan :

 

Normally a tasteless oily sheet filled with ground pork, this one was delicious, the outside being both crispy and tasty, and the filling of bean sprouts and pork sausage very nice.

Lastly was kuay jap yuan , a thickish noodle soup with pork ribs and Vietnamese sausage, and topped with fresh herbs:

 

Again, much better than the standard. Looks like I know where I&apos;ll be getting my quasi-Vietnamese fix.

click on the image Tonight&apos;s dinner was at a khao tom restaurant called Kan Eng (&quot;On Our Own&quot;, or something similiar). As I think I&apos;ve mentioned before, khao tom literally means &quot;boiled rice&quot; and usually refers to a dish of rice soup, such as this , featured previously. However in another sense it can also refer to the repertoire of made-to-order Chinese-style dishes that are typically consumed with small bowls of watery boiled rice.

We started with tom jap chay , a Chinese-style &quot;stew&quot; of pork ribs, mustard greens, dried mushrooms, white radish and whole garlic cloves (!):

 

And there were hoy talaep (I think that&apos;s what they&apos;re called...?):

 

Small cockles that look and taste like rubber, and when eaten raw, emit an alarmingly red juice that looks like blood. These were par-boiled and served with a really strong garlic-chili-fish sauce &quot;seafood&quot; dipping sauce, which really made them taste just like the sauce (which made them edible).

This bad boy is probably one of my favorite Thai veggie dishes:

 

It&apos;s a stir fry of the of the tender stalks and leaves of the small gourd known as chayote (or mirleton if you&apos;re in New Orleans or fak maew in Thailand) with garlic and fermented soybeans. Incidentally, in a bizarre example of foodblogger synchronicity, this veggie is also the basis of a question in today&apos;s post at the Hanoi-based sticky rice . I think I&apos;ve answered it.

And to complete our vegetable feeding frenzy, there was phat khanaeng fai daeng :

 

Khanaeng is a crunchy green leaf somewhere between brussels sprouts and kale (yes, such a thing exists), and is fried here with hearty chunks of salted preserved fish. Very salty, very garlicky, and very good.

click on the image Am making every effort to improve my photo skillz, and today took a jaunty stroll through the sunny streets of Bangkok, gaily snapping photos of the gentle natives. OK, of course it wasn&apos;t like that; car exaust from rush hour nearly made me vomit and two people yelled at me for taking their photos, but it was still good fun. I started at the Saphan Taksin BTS station and made my way along Charoen Krung Road all the way to Chinatown, a long walk that I&apos;ve never done in its entirety.

Taken from Takin Bridge, these are commuters getting off the Chao Phraya Express Boat:

 

and getting off the river crossing boat from Thonburi:

 

Just up the road a bit is the Bang Rak market. Can you tell what these people are doing? (It would be much easier if there was color.):

 

 Noy naa (custard apples) for sale along Charoen Krung:

 

And street vendors:

 

 

Approaching Chinatown there is an area where there are countless shops that deal in used engine parts:

Not hard to tell what part of town these were taken in:

click on the image As mentioned earlier , I recently did a piece for ThaiDay on the local cuisine of Ko Samui. Seeing as most of the images that have already been blogged, rather than rehash them again, here is a direct link to the article at the ThaiDay site. Read it. In my opinion it&apos;s the most interesting piece I&apos;ve done for them yet.

click on the image This is dish of Chinese origin normally associated with Singapore and Malaysia that I&apos;ve been seeing more and more of in Bangkok. In the best tradition of investigative food journalism, I selflessly decided to see what all the fuss was about and stopped by a local place cleverly named Ba Kut Teh.

The signature dish, bak kut teh , is a thickish stew served in an earthenware bowl:

 

The fragrant broth contained the requisite pork ribs and joints as well as a couple kinds of mushroom and some cabbage. The stew was served with two sauces, soy sauce and a spicy-sour chili sauce, and a bowl of plain rice. It was good, but didn&apos;t quite have the deep flavor of something that had been simmering for hours. Judging by the current popularity of this dish, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s got to be better bak kut teh out there than this, and I&apos;ll be keeping my eyes open from now on.

As sides we ordered a dish of khanom jeep , steamed &quot;dumplings&quot; of ground pork and crab:

 

and an odd but oddly delicious deep-fried sausagelike &quot;roll&quot; of meat and veggies:

 

also very nice. All in all a good eat, and a nice break from the usual Thai suspects.

What is it that interests people about this photo? Is it the woman? Is it chicken? The juxtaposition of chicks and chicken? I think it might be the last one, as my second most viewed photo at the time of writing is this:

click on the image Today&apos;s lunch was taken at a local noodle joint that I&apos;ve previously described here . Don&apos;t normally like to do reruns, but this place has a great dish that I&apos;ve only recently discovered. The dish is called hoy jor , and looks like this:

 

Hoy jor is ground pork mixed with crab and copious black pepper, which is then wrapped in a tofu skin and deep-fried. It&apos;s similiar to the dish mentioned here , and is essentially a protein-based spring roll. The dish is served with a sweetish plum dipping sauce that is easily forgettable, but the hoy jor itself is crispy outside and tender inside, and has so much pepper it&apos;s almost spicy. Very good--we usually get two dishes.

Another thing I ordered that I usually don&apos;t is crysanthemum juice:

 

Don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be doing that again. Way too sweet, and tastes like a Chinese apothecary smells!

And I couldn&apos;t resist the usual, kwaytiao khae:

 

The meatballs and fishballs (there are about five different kinds) here are outstanding.

click on the image It&apos;s Tuesday, and that means mini market night in my neighborhood. Not too much to choose from on Tuesdays--Saturday is big market day--but there is one lady selling decent northern Thai food, which is what I ended up choosing.

Many of you are familiar with laap (or laab or larb), but I doubt many of you have tried the northern version, laap khua :

 

Khua means fried, and in this dish ground pork, along with pork liver, heart, tripe, skin and intestines, are sauteed with a curry paste. The curry paste contains a dried herb called ma khwaen , which gives this dish a spicy &quot;numbing&quot; flavor, somewhat similar to Szechuan pepper.

With this I had the northern staple, nam phrik num :

 

A &quot;dip&quot; of grilled chilies, garlic, tomatoes and shallots eaten with deep-fried pork rinds:

 

and par-boiled and fresh veggies:

 

All of this was taken, as is the tradition, with sticky rice. A decent meal--and all for 45 baht ($1.25)!

click on the image As the title suggests, this post is definately NOT about Thai food. But after living here for nearly seven years now, one does get the odd craving for some Western-style food. Rather than satisfying this urge by eating at overpriced and underwhelming restaurants, I usually just make it myself.
 
My latest craving was tacos. Not Old El Paso crispy shell ground beef iceberg lettuce American tacos, but real tacos, as illustrted in this fun New York Times piece . This, coupled with the blog mentioned in the article, The Great Taco Hunt , put me over the edge; I had to make tacos. Luckily, or coincidentally, or both, it just so happened that Mark Bittman recently did a piece on making tacos. Following his recipe for Pastor, marinated pork, I went out, bought the ingredients, and here are the results (not the greatest pics--I was really anxious to try them!):

 

They really came out quite nicely. Bittman&apos;s recipe involved marinading the pork overnight in a mixture of dried spices (coriander, cumin, peppercorns and cinnamon) and orange and lime juice. The next step required roasting the meat in an oven, but as I don&apos;t have an oven, I just simmered the meat in a bit of water in a large pot. After about two hours I took off the lid to allow the liquid to evaporate and the meat was incredibly tender and fragrant.

Here you can see the condiments:

 

I made a guacamole (with Thai avocadoes), a salsa fresca (with Thai jalapenos and some nice tomatoes) and a chile colorado sauce, recipe courtesy of the excellent RollyBrook Mexican food blog .

Even the tortillas were made in Thailand, an included a semi-decent corn tortilla:

 

And a less decent flour torilla:

 

Will definately be making tacos again.

click on the image The above is not a question, but rather the name of a new restaurant on Soi Sena 1, not far from my house. From the outside it looked like the kind of cute cafe/restaurant that seem to be popping up everywhere in Thailand. In reality it was much more basic, and was the kind of inexpensive and basic eating place that university students thrive on. Sometimes these places can be good. Sometimes they can be great. This one was almost good.

I started with khao khluk kapi :

 

This is rice that has been cooked with shrimp paste ( kapi ) and topped with sour shredded mango, sliced omelet, cucumber, chilies, dried shrimp and Chinese sausage, among other things. This dish usually includes a side of muu waan , pork stir-fried in copious sugar and minimal soy sauce, which I don&apos;t care for and always ask them to hold. I&apos;ve actually been wanting to feature this dish for a long time, it&apos;s a brilliant Thai invention, but this is not the greatest example, as the dish is usually much more attractively arranged. In addition, the best khao khluk kapi have a few more toppings, and come with a bowl of broth.

We also had flash-fried morning glory:

 

a dish that probably constitutes a good third of out diet! It&apos;s crunchy, garlicky, salty and green, and everything else that&apos;s good.

And the last was tom yam po taek thale :

 

Po taek (literally &quot;broken pier&quot;, not sure why), is simply tom yam with the addition of bai kraphrao (I think this is called &quot;holy basil&quot; in English). This one was extremely spicy; I reckon there&apos;s few groups of people around the world who can tolerate food of this heat other than the Thais. The &apos;shrooms were nice, but the seafood (shrimp, squid, fish) was crap.

click on the image No, I don&apos;t make this stuff up. Salmon Cuisine is really truly the name of the restaurant where I took today&apos;s lunch. And no, the food is not just for fish. People can eat there too.

The restaurant is one of countless &quot;steak&quot; restaurants found around Bangkok nowadays. These restaurants typically serve overpriced Western-style food, the &quot;steaks&quot; generally being sorry-looking pork chops! They&apos;re generally to be avoided, but today Salmon Cuisine caught my eye for 1. Its ridiculous name 2. A Thai-language sign out fron stating that they served roti kaeng karee. For those of you who aren&apos;t familiar with this dish, roti is a kind of crispy pancake of Muslim origin, and kaeng karee , literally &quot;curry curry&quot;, a Muslim-style coconut milk-based curry laden with dry spices. At Salmon Cuisine these came together as a set:

 

and were not half bad. I suspect the roti was of the pre-made frozen variety (and was, as you can see, a bit on the meagre side), but it was well heated up and crispy nonetheless. The curry was pleasantly spicy, with small chunks of potato and carrot. The topping you see there is cripsy deep-fried shallots. Comprehensively delish, but more a snack that a meal.

Khuat had already eaten and was after dessert, and ordered an apple crepe with vanilla ice cream:

 

Waaaay too sweet. The ice cream was from Swensens, which is popular here, but to my tongue tastes somehow &quot;artificial&quot; and, again much too sweet. The pool of syrup seen at the back of the plate is a a pool of syrup. These dishes and two drinks cost 300 baht ($8)! This may not seem a lot to some of you in The West, but compare this with my far superior northern Thai meal of a few days ago for a mere 45 baht!

A couple more close-up shots of the food can be seen here .

And due to popular demand, from now on I&apos;m going to try to list the addresses and phone numbers of the places I visit.

 phat kraphrao plaa meuk , squid stir-fried with basil. Salty, spicy, sloppy and garlicky. All my faves. And then there&apos;s also the bonus of a fried egg. This was consumed at a nondescript restaurant, but the dish is mad easy to make and I&apos;ll try to include a recipe soon.

click on the image Spent yesterday evening in bowels of Yaowarat, Bankgok&apos;s Chinatown, with China Williams , guidebook author and self-proclaimed &quot;huge fan, really big, immense...&quot; of RealThai, and Alex, a representative of her publishing company . In an instance of what China refers to as &quot;research&quot;, we scanned the area in search of interesting eats--and ate them. Yes, believe it or not, some people get paid to do this! I, unfortunately was not getting paid, but enjoyed the experience nonetheless. I hadn&apos;t been to Chinatown late at night in quite a while, and was quite blown away by the food choices. After wandering a bit, this is where we eventually decided on this Chinese-style eatery with heaps of prepared foods to choose from:

 

The place is called Khao Tom Plaeng Naam, and is located at the Charoen Krung end of Thanon Plaeng Naam. They&apos;re apparently open 24 hours, which explains why some of the choices looked less fresh than others, but we still had pretty good meal of stewed pork ribs, fish steamed in garlic, flash-fried morning glory and deep-fried fish.

Dessert took the form of a fruit smoothie at this stall on Thanon Yaowarat, directly across from Chraroen Krung Soi 16:

 

I think it&apos;s only open in the evenings, but I really recommend it if you&apos;re in the area. It served by far the biggest, and probably the best smoothie I&apos;ve had in ages.

Due to a Chinese holiday, the main market street, Soi 16, was open late, and was selling an obscene amount of boiled chickens (given as offerings, I&apos;m told):

 

And despite the late hour (we were there at midnight), there was an equally obscene amount of people still to be found eating in Chinatown:

 

The people above are eating kuay jap , a thick, slimy-ish &quot;stew&quot; of pork at an extremely popular stall near the smoothie joint, but in Chinatown you can also get grilled seafood:

 

birds&apos; nest soup:

 

stir-fried veggies:

 

noodles:

 

 khao man kai , Hainanese chicken rice:

 

or the best of both worlds, noodles AND poultry, here barbecued duck:

 

Again, please keep in mind that these foods are only available at night, typically not until about 8 PM. Chinatown&apos;s fresh markets are fun in the mornings, but the area is not a terrific food desination during the day.

click on the image Before going over to Chinatown yesterday, I spent a couple hours at Paak Khlong Talaat, one of Bankgok&apos;s biggest wholesale markets, and come evening, the home of Bangkok&apos;s famous flower market. There&apos;s lots to see here, and even more to photograph, but it&apos;s tough shooting. Low light makes it necessary to use a tripod in most cases, and the variety of light (natural, tungsten, flourescent) wreaks havoc on even the best digital SLRs. I don&apos;t like to use a tripod though, and could care less about White Balance, and tried to take advantage of these factors, as well as the hectic nature of the market:

 

No, the young man above is not on fire; he&apos;s simply moving some bright yellow flowers. This guy is moving roses wrapped in newspaper:

 

Choosing the right flowers can be a hard decision:

 

After all, there are lotuses:

 

and more lotuses:

 

and... uh, I&apos;m really not sure what these are:

 

Particular to Thailand are buds of fragrant jasmine that have been threaded and formed into garlands, often used as religious offerings:

click on the image Noodles are big in Bangkok, and at the top of the heap sits yen ta fo , a noodle-dish probably of southern Chinese origin that combines a sweetish red broth, fish balls and morning glory. There are countless restaurants serving this dish, but a new one caught my eye today. It is called Yen Ta Fo Corner, and is located in an small outdoor mall called Palm Street.

We started with a couple unusual appetizers. The first was deep-fried fish skin:

 

As bizarre as it sounds, this is actually pretty common find in yen ta fo restaurants, however this version was apparently made from salmon skin, and was served with an excellent nam phrik phao , a roasted chili dip--both divergences from the norm. Ironically, I dislike the skin when eating fish in other forms, but kinda like this dish.

This was followed by a variety of fish balls, topped with chinese celery and crispy garlic, and served with a spicy/sour dipping sauce:

 

They make some pretty good balls here, and the exceedingly detailed notes on the menu testified that they are made from 100% fish with no preservatives or borax! The long ball in the front is known as a &quot;rugby&quot; ball, the darker one behind it is a shrimp ball, and behind that is kiaow plaa , a &quot;fish wonton&quot; filled with ground pork, coriander root, garlic and pepper. The dipping sauce, a combination of tiny fresh chilis, garlic, lime juice and fish sauce, is standard in Thailand, but absolutely delicious.

We then made it to the restaurant&apos;s namesake, yen ta fo:

 

This was somewhat disappointing. The broth was a bit too red and too sweet, the noodles limp and overcooked, and the morning glory on the skimpy side. But again, some pretty good balls.

click on the image My mom and grandma are currently here in Bangkok. This is mom&apos;s third trip, and she does pretty well with the Thai food, except for her irrational, prejudiced and wholly unwarranted fear of the spicy stuff. Today we drove down to the province of Phetchaburi, about 100+ km from BKK. This hardly-visited-by-foreigners small town is really a fun destination, with a nice outdoor morning market and heaps of cool temples. Mueang Phet has some good eats, but for lunch we drove about 40 clicks south to the old seaside resort of Cha Am. The beach at Cha Am is none too impressive, and a the town a bit run down, but none of this matters, because at the northern end of the beach, right at the foot of the pier, are about 87 restaurants serving fresh seafood! We randomly chose a restaurant with a seafront view called, for some reason, Captain Yuad, and here&apos;s what we ate:

 

Our eating marathon began with the traditional Thai carb accompaniment to seafood, khao phat puu , fried rice with crab:

 

Shown above is the &quot;medium&quot; size--more than enough for the four of us, and well-seasoned with hearty chunks of crab and egg.

Mom still has dreams about the grilled prawns from her last trip here, so we orderd a 1/2 kilo:

 

She needed a bit of instruction in peeling them, but got it eventually:

 

Not stopping at this she also ordered shrimp fried with palm hearts:

 

This was a dish with lots of Chinese influence: dried mushrooms, bell peppers, soy sauce and green onions.

Khuat went directly for the spicy stuff, ordering hoy shell phat chaa , scallops fried with fresh herbs:

 

and the previously mentioned po taek , a tom yam-like soup with mixed seafood and flavored with holy basil:

 

This was probably our favorite dish of the meal--and ironically grandma and mom&apos;s least favorite! The broth was rich, but according to them, too sour (not true at all), and contained meaty crab, chunky squid and giant fresh prawns. Here&apos;s grandma enjoying the latter:

 

And in a fit of seafood feeding frenzy, Khuat ordered a dish of par-boiled cockles:

 

She regretted this decision almost immediately, and jusifiably so: nobody ate them and she ended up sharing them with the cat at home. I&apos;ve heard that the cat liked them.

I ordered plaa samlee daet diaow , &quot;cottonfish&quot; dried in the sun for one day, then deep-fried and served with a sour/sweet mango-based side sauce:

 

This dish employed probably the biggest, meatiest cottonfish I&apos;ve ever seen--all to its detriment. Smaller cottonfish have a more delicate &quot;salty&quot; flavor that is really pleasant--this specimen was so meaty it was not unlike the tasteless protein of an American Chicken Breast. And ideally, the fish should be somewhat dry (the result of drying), however I&apos;m pretty sure they just took the biggest fresh fish they could find and deep-fried it. Naughty, naughty.

All of these were served with the famous Thai seafood dipping sauce:

 

An unpalatable cauldron of fire to mom and grandma, but a tad too sweet for my tongue.

As with most of our meals so far, mom and grandma were utterly shocked by the amount of food we ordered. Nonetheless, we always seems to finish it off:

 

All of this fun for 1,300 baht (about $30).

Incidentally, in the next few days we&apos;ll be going up to northern Thailand--Chiang Mai, Lampang, Naan and Sukhothai--and I&apos;ll certainly be posting bits and bobs from our eats up there.

click on the image I was recently contacted by a writer who asked me to share some advice on Thai kitchen utensils for a piece she is working on. I think this is a great idea for an article and reckoned I could both help her out and do a fun blog by picturing and describing a few of the tools here. This is by no means an exhaustive list; in the course of doing this blog alone I thought of heaps of other impliments/tools/appliances that I&apos;d like to include, but it&apos;s a start, and I&apos;ll try to add to it later. If anybody out there has anything to suggest, please do comment away.

Perhaps the most important tool in the entire Thai kitchen is the mortar and pestle. Granite mortar and pestle sets are used to grind curry pastes, dried spices and chili pastes, as seen below:

 

Clay and wood sets are used to make som tam , papaya salad:

 

Speaking of which, if you&apos;re going to eat papaya salad, then you&apos;ll also need sticky rice, which in turn requires the huat , the straw basket used to steam the rice:

 

(As a slight aside, the huat is also used, painted and in combination with a palm tree branch, as part of the well-known masks in the Phi Ta Khon Festival in Loei, NE Thailand):

 

One of the most unusual tradtional Thai kitchen tools is literally translated as the &quot;coconut milk scraping rabbit&quot;. This tool is used to scrape the meat from mature coconuts, from which coconut milk is extracted. In the past, the tool used to take the form of a large rabbit; one would sit on the rabbbit&apos;s back while using its sharp metal &quot;teeth&quot; to scrape the coconut. Although it&apos;s not too clear, the woman below is using a less-rabbitlike, more modern version of the tool:

 

My personal favorite Thai kitchen tool is the coffee sock. This is a cloth tube that serves as a primitive coffee filter:

 

It&apos;s probably not the best way of making coffee in the world, but is certainly unique. The coffee sock is usually found with a stainless steel pot of hot water (over a traditional charcoal stove, as seen below), a recepticle or two for the filters, and a specially designed ladle for pouring the hot water:

 

Wood makes its way into a few different iconic Thai kitchen utensils. Any Thai who sees the following wooden container:

 

will immediately be reminded of its contents: chao kuay , or grass jelly. And hard coconut shells are also used to make a variety of spoons and ladles:

 

 

Clay is another important material, and takes several different forms and serves several functions, as seen below:

 

Possibly the most iconic is the tho naam :

 

This clay pot is usually associated with northern Thailand, where it is located in fron of houses on a small roofed stand in order to provide clean drinking water for anybody passing by.

Somewhat more refined, but equally iconic are the bowls with hand-painted chicken design:

 

 

And possessing hardly any aesthetic value at all, but entirely practical and ubiquitous, are the aluminum, plastic-handled pots used for serving curries and soups:

 

A final interesting tool is the ice-filled basin used to make old-school Thai popcicles:

 

Small metal tubes are suspended in icy water from a rack that can be shaken and turned to uniformly chill their contents:

 

Again, there&apos;s lots more where this came from (i.e. the pin to or Thai &quot;lunchbox&quot;, enamel colanders, the metal tray with the flower design, intimidating-looking cleavers, and katip , sticky rice containers), and I&apos;ll try to post more when I get a chance to take the pics. And Jill, it would be wonderful if you could send us by a pdf of the piece when it runs ; )

click on the image Unlike at home, malls here can actually be pretty good places to find food. The restaurants can be hit and miss, but the foodcourts--an essential part of every mall in Bangkok--are usually more than decent. Foodcourt food is for the most part void of soul-sucking franchiseism and is generally cleaner and fresher than that found on the streets. The best foodcourt in Bangkok is probably that of MBK, but it&apos;s a long trip up six floors of frantic shoppers, so we settled for the glittery new food court at Siam Paragon, where we already happened to be. Paragon&apos;s food court is firmly average, and the prices double what you would pay outside, but it&apos;s a decent and safe intro to real-ish Thai food for those who would rather not have car exhaust in their noodle soup. There&apos;s lots to choose from, especially if you&apos;re a fan of noodles, but the dish that caught mom&apos;s eye was khao man kai , Haiananese chicken rice:

 

Khao man kai is boiled chicken:

 

served over rice that has been cooked with chicken broth and coconut milk. Grandma ordered a regular:

 

and mom a dish of khao man kai thot , chicken rice with deep-fried chicken:

 

The dish typically comes with a bowl of chicken broth and a salty/spicy/sour sauce.

After some shopping we stopped for cake and coffee at the Face cafe:

 

I&apos;ve previously had the opportunity of interviewing the friendly pastry chef of this restaurant, who is responsible for making some of the best desserts and chocolates in town:

 

Right now Face is currently running a special: 150 baht for a piece of cake and a coffee. Not dirt cheap, but a great value when one considers the quality of the desserts and the going price of Lavazza coffee elsewhere. I encourage a visit.

Off to the wild north tomorrow. Should be back and posting in about a week.

click on the image Mom and grandma like shopping. I like food and beer. We needed a place to go, and as I compromise I suggested visiting the Suan Lum Night Bazaar--the Chatujak Weekend Market&apos;s slightly more upscale, cooler, less crowded competitor--a place where one can find stuff to buy, and more importantly, eats.

We arrived at 6 PM, when it&apos;s still light out and the food stalls at the gigantic covered beer garden are just beginning to open. To begin, I ordered a plate of one of my fav Thai appetizers, deep-fried soft shell crabs:

 

A decent job here, although some of the shells weren&apos;t as &quot;soft&quot; as one would expect. And they also lose points for the crappy bottled dipping sauce.

When left to her own devices, Grandma is somewhat conservative in her Thai food choices, and chose the good but safe, khao phat poo , fried rice with crab:

 

served here with peas and corn (both hightly unusual additions), and the more traditional sides of thinly sliced chilies in fish sauce, sliced cucumbers, green onions and a wedge of lime. This dish is probably one of the most simple, but most satisfying Thai dishes, and is a necessary accompaniment to grilled seafood.

Mom is a sucker for regional Thai foods, and headed directly for the isaan (NE Thai) stall:

 

where she ordered a dish of tam poo , papaya salad with crab:

 

As for myself I stood with severe indecision in front of a variety of slightly overpriced dishes at a ahaan taam sang , made-to-order restaurant:

 

and eventually chose khao khluk kapi , rice cooked with shrimp paste and served with a variety of toppings:

 
a dish previously mentioned on these pages . This version was much greasier than it should be, and oddly used shredded cabbage in place of shredded mango, but was acceptably salty and exceptionally filling.

In general the Thai food at the Suan Lum Night Bazaar is mediocre and somewhat overpriced. For me, the highlight is the great selection of imported (mostly from Germany) beers. While mom and grandma were shopping, I spent a good 20 minutes searching for Bass Ale--an extremely rare specimen of beer that I had previously consumed at this very same night bazaar. Coming up empty handed, I settled for a delicious but under the circumstances somewhat disappointing Weihenstephaner, only to find the Bass Ale tap on the way back to my seat! Oh well, next time.

Incidentally, there are rumours (unconfirmed) that the Suan Lum Night Bazaar is closing. Apparently locals have complained that the place is too loud, but don&apos;t these people have any sympathy for imported beer lovers? If their desires are met and the bazaar is eventually closed, where do these people expect me to buy English ale and German hefeweizen? Is sleep really more important than Schneider-Weisse? People like this deserved to be fed nothing but lukewarm Beer Chang for the rest of their cruel, selfish lives.

At the urge of Melissa at the Traveler&apos;s Lunchbox , I&apos;ve decided to play along with her fun foodgame and list the five things I feel one should make a point of stuffing into his/her gob before the unfortunate but inevitable event of passing away. Here are my five:

1. Khao Soi (as prepared in northern Thailand, of course) 

 

This is the legendary curry noodle soup indigenous to northern Thailand. Served with beef or chicken and egg noodles and a side of sliced shallots, lime and picked mustard cabbage, the dish encompasses virtually every taste and flavour. Whenever I have friends or family visiting I always make a point of introducing this dish, and invariably people love it.

2. Beer from Oregon 

 

I come from just east of Portland, Oregon, a city considered by many to be one of the world&apos;s beer hotspots (and by some accounts, the city with the most breweries per capita). Beer from Oregon is almost certainly the one food I really and truly miss here in Thailand, and I would give my left earlobe to obtain access virtually anything from Portland&apos;s own Widmer , or Newport&apos;s Rogue , or especially my favorite beer of all time, Mirror Pond Pale Ale , an example of American brewing at its best, courtesy of Bend Oregon&apos;s own Deschutes Brewery . 

3. Orecchiette con Cime di Rapa 

 

I&apos;ve been making my own version of this southern Italian pasta dish for years using dried pasta, Thai anchovies (!), pecorino romano, broccoli and a generous amount of dried Thai chilies. I&apos;ve always liked it, but never realized how perfect a pasta dish it really is until I was fed the dish by Giovanni Speciali, a native of Puglia, and (former) head chef at the Bangkok Four Season&apos;s Biscotti . His take employed fresh orecchiette (&quot;little ears&quot;) pasta, plump cherry tomatoes from Italy, young broccoli sprouts from northern Thailand and grated ricotta dura de pecora, a semi-hard sheep&apos;s milk cheese from Puglia. What I learned from Chef Giovanni&apos;s version is that besides being absolutely delicious, the dish is drop dead easy to make; all you need is the best ingredients possible.

4. Real Bread 

 

Not WonderBread. Not Whole Wheat Bread. In fact, nothing already sliced or in a plastic package will do. It has to be kneaded by a human, is probably European in origin, and has a tender yet chewy center, and a crisp exterior. Dip it in something greasy or spread it with the coagulated milkfat of a well-fed cow; it&apos;s been the stuff of life for a long time and shows no sign of dying out. A good place to taste Real Bread is the Pearl Bakery , in Portland, Oregon.

5. Anything green prepared phat fai daeng 

 
 
Phat fai daeng is Thai for &quot;fried with a red flame&quot; and refers to the Chinese-influenced style of cooking where one flash fries veggies, igniting the cooking oil to give the dish a pleasant &quot;smoky&quot; flavour. In Thailand these dishes usually use phak boong (morning glory, an aquatic vegetable) or kai lan, flavoured with fried with oyster sauce or fermented soybeans, along with copious garlic and tiny fresh Thai chilies. Salty, spicy, garlicky and green--everything you need.

I pass the mission along to the following food bloggers:

1. The one and only Pieman, Graham at noodlepie .
2. My homegirl Pim at chez pim .
3. Everybody&apos;s favourite meat-obsessed Cambodia correspondant Phil at Phnomenon .
4. Former Thailand inhabitant Robyn at EatingAsia .
5. Culinary globetripper Mike at Trippin&apos; Mag .

click on the image Ditching the traffic and boiled rice of Bangkok, we headed up north. Our first stop was in Chiang Mai, where after picking up our rental car, we proceeded directly to Khao Soi Lam Duan, Chiang Mai&apos;s, and by association, Thailand&apos;s best and most famous khao soi restaurant:

 

From Chiang Mai we drove directly to the pleasant town of Lampang, home to an excellent night market selling heaps of northern Thai food. This stall was virtually inundated with people buying food to go (a very good sign), and their food was nearly sold out even before it was dark:

 

Selling mushrooms:

 

Serving up sticky rice, which as in much of northern Thailand, is wrapped in large leaves called bai tong tueng :

 

We took our goods back to our hotel, the lovely Riverside Guesthouse , where they were kind enough to let us use their dishes.

The next morning, on the way out of town, we stopped at a shop selling a vareity of curries meant to be served over khanom jeen , fermented rice noodles:

 

Mom chose the northern specialty, khanom jeen naam ngiaow , a dish of tomato-based broth not unlike a spicy spaghetti sauce:

 

I think this pic was taken at the point when she was told that those dark cubes are not liver, but rather coagulated blood!

Our next stop was the beautiful province of Naan. Unfortunately almost as soon as we arrived, the entire area experienced its worst flooding in nearly 50 years! I was planning to spend a few days in Naan, so this drastically changed our plans, but at least we had an amazing dish of laap khua at a restaurant call Pu Som before heading to higher ground:

 

The next day was spent in the small provincial town of Phrae. A night market can be found in the middle of town, and although the food sold there wasn&apos;t local (nor really good), we did have some good roti :

 

From Phrae we drove south to Sukhothai to check out the ruins. The modern city of Sukhothai is probably one of the least attractive urban areas in Thailand, but there is some decent food there, including a night market with both prepared dishes and people selling produce such as the local favorite, phrik num :

 

However one of the best restaurants in town is an extremely popular noodle shop called Jay Hae. This place is known for its Sukhothai-style noodles, as Nong Paeng is showing here:

 

And they also do an excellent khanom jeen naam ngiaow:

 

One of the most interesting stops on our trip was at Thung Kwieng Market, found along the highway between Lampang and Chiang Mai. Also known as the jungle market, this market previously had a reputation for selling rare animals/produce from the surrounding forests. Today the sale of endangered wildlife is more or less a thing of the past, but there are still some bizarre things to be found, such as this:

 

a nearly fully developed buffalo fetus, known locally as khwaay awn . It is prepared by chopping it up, rubbing it with copious spices (to cover up the horrible smell) and steaming it, as shown below:

 

The market had an amazing amount of particularly northern Thai specialties, such as dried spices:

 

grilled food, including the famous northern Thai sausage, sai ua (located on the right):

 

and maengdaa:
 
 
 
an insect used all over Thailand for its fruitlike &quot;essence&quot;.

In the coming weeks I&apos;ll be going up north again, this time to my beloved Mae Hong Son, to write a sample chapter for a particular publisher of travel books popular in SE Asia .

click on the image Dim sum is a dish I&apos;ve always wanted to like, but one that has inevitably disappointed me. I&apos;m not sure why; it involves seafood, consists of a variety of small dishes, is served with tea and is eaten with chopsticks--several of the earmarks of a good meal. Maybe it&apos;s just that I&apos;ve never eaten it at the right place, although to date I&apos;ve eaten dim sum at various restaurants in Macau, Malaysia, Oregon and Thailand. Despite all this, whenever I see a new dim sum place here in Bangkok I&apos;m always keen to try it.

My latest effort in the search for edible dim sum was at a nearby branch of a somewhat new chain restaurant, Chokdee Dim Sum . Like most dim sum restaurants, upon entering Chokdee, you walk to a glass case where the uncooked dim sum are anxiously waiting for you. You choose the ones you want, which are steamed to order and brought to your table:

 

Despite it being a corny fast food restaurant, it was one of the first times I&apos;ve ever really and truly enjoyed dim sum. The steamed dumplings weren&apos;t defrosted and deformed like the usual stuff one typically gets in Bangkok, and the vegetables and (most of) the seafood were relatively fresh. Mom liked the steamed buns:
 
 
 
which, as she accurately noted, were compellingly similar in taste and texture to Polish pierogi . Another highlight was a big fat steaming bowl of bak kut teh (a dish previously mentioned here ). The broth was downright spicy with ground pepper, and contained pork ribs, tofu skin, and dried and fresh mushrooms.

I think mom and grandma were initially weirded out by the unfamiliar ingredients and all the steaming going on, but they soon lost all inhibition and went into something of a dim sum frenzy, stabbing each other with their forks (the poor souls haven&apos;t yet learned to use chopsticks) to get at the best bits:

 

I tried my best to ignore all of this and enjoyed several cups of Chinese tea:

 

Incidentally, the company&apos;s motto is (among other things) &quot;Our dimsum is made fresh by hand, with love right here in our kitchen.&quot; Because this is written on virtually every wall of the restauant, we decided to ask if it was in fact true, and were told that the dim sum were actually made elsewhere and brought to the restaurant every morning! Oh well, at least it&apos;s probably made with love. Regardless, I&apos;ll be back. You can find me at:

click on the image This is a longstanding neighborhood joint that recently either won the lottery or robbed a bank, and expanded to much posher digs across the street:

 

The new place still carries all the southern-style curries and fried dishes of the &quot;old&quot; branch, but also has a new menu of noodle dishes and a la carte dishes. We started our rather lengthy power lunch with an order of khao tang naa tang :

 

This dish consists of squares of crispy deep-fried rice served with a slightly sweet, generously savory currylike topping consisting of ground pork and shrimp. I liked it, mostly because they went light on the sweet, unlike most places.

Our food was washed down with glasses of fresh guava juice:

 

Our second appetizer (!) was papaya salad:

 

This is a dish that, I imagine, was previously relegated to roadside isaan , or NE Thai food joints. However now papaya salad is the de facto national dish of Thailand, and is seemingly available everywhere. Despite this restaurant serving mostly southern-style food, they did an excellent job on this dish, which featured an almost perfect (in my opinion) balance of sweet, sour, salty and spicy.

For my main, I ordered sen chan phat poo :

 

The famous rice noodles from Chantaburi fried with crab. Essentially phat thai without the peanuts, this dish was done very well, although perhaps a bit more crab meat wouldn&apos;t hurt.

Khuat ordered the southern special, kaeng tai plaa , literally &quot;fish kidney curry&quot;, served with fermented rice noodles:

 

She found it too salty, but actually this dish is supposed to be salty. Nice try, Khuat.

It was an excellent lunch--the place is better than ever. I&apos;m also excited about a couple more new places in the neighborhood--a dim sum place and what appears to be a &quot;steak&quot; restaurant just across the road from this one. Reportage will ensue.

Since Pim at Chez Pim and Helen at Grab Your Fork were both kind enough to mention RealThai as one five blogs they want to share on the occasion of Blog Day 2006, I thought it best to repay the favor and mention five blogs I enjoy. Unfortunately, I&apos;m a day late (Blog Day was officially August 31st), but I&apos;m sure none of the following talented bloggers will mind:

1. Rolly&apos;s Recipes is probably the first thing resembling a foodblog I ever came across, and I liked it immediately. Rolly is an American guy living with a family in Mexico, who graciously shares illustrated recipes of the food that the family makes. Try their insanely spicy, but delicious salsa casera . I did, and I love it.

2. I must admit that I&apos;m not a regular reader of Algerian Cuisine , a blog by Farid Zadi, but I try to stop by in every once in a while, and find it fascinating to learn about a cuisine I know absolutely nothing about. Although he hasn&apos;t been updating too much lately, do visit and learn how to make octopus soup !

3. The Traveler&apos;s Lunchbox is one of the most aesthetically pleasing foodblogs on the &apos;net. Ironically, the author, Melissa , and I are the same age, come from the same part of the US, have both studied linguistics, have both lived outside of our home country for ages, and are both crazy about food. Who knows, maybe we&apos;re also related? 
4. Although Pim already beat me to it, and I&apos;ve previously mentioned it here, I can&apos;t enough of the Cambodian-based foodblog, Phnomenon . Phil (the self-confessed &quot;pimp of Khmer cuisine&quot;) really knows his stuff, and is probably the most talented and sharp-witted foodblog writer out there, as seen in the following quote: &quot;Cambodian beer will always have a place in my heart, right next to that blood fluke that I caught while swimming in the Mekong.&quot;

5. I&apos;ve recently been obsessed with real tacos . Part of the source of my obsession was my discovery of The Great Taco Hunt , a blog based in LA. The author, Bandini, is a card-carrying &quot;taco journalist&quot; who scours southern California for the best tacos, and who occasionally also delves into taco politics , and taco couture . I immediately gained respect for his work when, on the first anniversary of his blog, he enjoyed, yes, a birthday taco , complete with candle.

click on the image I&apos;m off the the wilds of Mae Hong Song, Thailand&apos;s northwest corner, and undoubtedly my favorite province in the country, to gather info and put together a sample chapter for a certain publishing company . If they like my work, I could be writing for them on a regular basis. Wish me luck, and see you in a week!

click on the image As previously mentioned, I&apos;m on the road, currently in the hopelessly beautiful province of Mae Hong Son. Using a computer that somebody told me is known as a &quot;PC&quot;, along with software that another kind soul described as &quot;Internet Explorer&quot;, I decided to stop by RealThai, only to discover that all the contents of my right-hand bar have rudely been dumped to the bottom of the page! First of all, why didn&apos;t anybody tell me this earlier? And what can be done to correct this? Muchly appreciated.

Oh, and by the way, can you tell I&apos;m a Mac user?

click on the image This is going to be a long one. I just got back from a week in my favorite place in Thailand, Mae Hong Son. I&apos;ve been there several times, and have even blogged about it previously , but this was the first time I&apos;d been during the rainy season, and I couldn&apos;t believe how green it was:

 

For those of you who aren&apos;t familiar with Mae Hong Son, it is found in the far northwestern corner of Thailand along the border with Burma. It&apos;s Thailand&apos;s most moutainous and remote province, and is home to a group of people known as Shan or thai yai . The Shan belong to the Tai ethnolinguistic group (the word Shan might possibly be a Burmese mispronunciation of the word Siam), and their language is similar, although not mutally comprehensible, to Thai. Their homeland is over the border in Burma, and they have their own distinct food and culture, and Mae Hong Son is really the only place in Thailand where you&apos;ll find a lot of them.

I started out in Chiang Mai, where, before leaving, I stopped by my favorite temple there, Wat Paa Pao. This temple is associated with the Shan, and if you visit in the the morning or during a festival you can try their food:

 

This noodle dish with pork ribs and tomatoes is known as naam ngiaow (a dish I&apos;ve previously mentioned here and here ) and you&apos;ll find it anywhere you find Shan people.

From there I made my way over some very windy roads to Pai, sometimes referred to as the Khao San Road of the North. The whole backpacker scene there is a bit of a joke, but luckily the hippies haven&apos;t yet ruined the town with all their free sex and dreadlocks. When I&apos;m in Pai I tend to avoid the vegetarian tofu laap and drum circles and head straight for:

1. The evening market:

 

Where there&apos;s raw ingredients:

 

prepared food:

 

 

traditionally dressed people:

 

and even fighting bugs:

 

2. Laap Khom Huay Pu (0 5369 9126). This is a restaurant just outside of town that serves the most amazing l aap khua

 
 
I&apos;ve ever eaten. Taken with a plate of mostly bitter-tasting herbs

 

and a katip of sticky rice, and pehaps a glass of the locally-produced passion fruit juice, this is a meal I could probably eat every day for the rest of my life.

Moving on, I spent the next night in neighboring Pang Ma Phaa district, where by the side of the road you&apos;ll find hilltribe people selling vegetables and fruits they&apos;ve grown:

 

And that night I ate, you guessed it, another dish of laap khua :

 

this specimen at a place called Laap Khom Phaa Toob. Of course inferior to that of Huay Pu, but only slightly so.

After two days I reached my destination, the provincial capital, Mae Hong Son. I love this city&apos;s morning market, where in one corner, you&apos;ll find a row of Shan women selling traditional breakfast dishes:

 

Many of these dishes revolve around soybeans, of which the Shan are very fond, but there&apos;s also the previously mentioned noodle dish:

 

At the market you&apos;ll also find deep-fried bamboo worms:

 

some marginally more normal deep-fried stuff:

 

Shan curries:

 

and bunches of flowers meant to be given at temples:

 

This is Mae Hong Son as seen from the hilltop temple of Wat Phra That Doi Kong Mu:

 

Somewhere down there is a shop, Panoon Khaw Soi (0 5361 2384; 9 Th Phadungmuaytor), that serves a pretty mean bowl of khao soi :

 

And in Baan Phaa Bong, about 10km south of Mae Hong Son, you&apos;ll find this friendly lady selling sweets:

 

The thing she&apos;s cutting into is called thamin suay , thamin being the Burmese word for rice. It&apos;s a Shan &quot;cake&quot; of sticky rice sweetened with sugar and coconut milk, and was delicious.

Arriving back in Chiang Mai, I had some time to take photos of the 100+ year-old murals at Wat Phra Singh:

 

Which proves I&apos;m not the only one obsessed with recording images food and eating!

For anybody visiting Mae Hong Son, in addition to the places mentioned above, I recommend the following restaurants:

Baan Phleng (look for yellow shop with sign reading ‘Local Northern Thaifood’; 0 5361 2522; 108 Th Khunlumpraphat) Located just south of ‘downtown’ Mae Hong Son, this popular restaurant is the best place to try northern Thai and Shan food. Come at lunch, when as many as 30 different dishes are on display; simply point to what looks interesting or refer to the English-language menu.

Mae Sri Bua (&apos;Local Shan Food&apos;; 0 5361 2471; 51 Th Singhanatbamrung) Like the Shan grandma you never had, Auntie Bua prepares more than a dozen different Shan curries, soups and dips on a daily basis. I recommend the kaeng hang ley , a curry of pork belly with a flavor not unlike American-style barbecue sauce (but much better!).

click on the image Lang means &quot;behind&quot; in Thai, and Head refers the the Head Office of Thai Airways International. Put these together and you have the colloquial name of a large market located behind Thai&apos;s head office on Vibhavadi Road. The market is primarily known for its clothes, as well as some other frivolous, useless things, but here at RealThai we will focus only on the important issues, ie food.

The Thai Airways Head Office is filled with prepetually hungry people who, every day at lunch, are let free en masse and run screaming out of the building in search of sustenance. Many of Thai Airways employees are upper middle class, and can afford slightly better eats than the average office slave. As a result, the food court at lang head is a bit better than most, featuring an amazing diversity of food from all over the country, as well as several takes on noodles, the staple food of most Bangkokians.

We arrived on a recent day at about 11:00 AM:

 

It was still pretty quiet when we got there, and I recommend going at this time, as at lunch it&apos;s pretty mad and you&apos;re liable to get a chili in your eye or worse during the feeding frenzy.

Although there weren&apos;t yet many customers, the cooks were very busy, scrambling to get their food ready for the lunch hour:

 

serving up khao mok kai , chicken biryani:

 

and frying up roti :

 

After some initial scouting, I decided to trust my lunch with these people:

 

They serve a variety of nam phrik , Chili-based dips, that are accompanied by a fresh and deep-fried veggies and a fillet of deep-fried mackerel. I chose nam phrik khai pu , a nam phrik with crab eggs:

 

Starting at 11 o&apos;clock you have the mackerel fillet, at 1 o&apos;clock deep-fried veggies including battered eggplant and cha om khai , sort of an omelette of egg and a pungent herb, at 3 o&apos;clock the nam phrik, and 6 o&apos;clock par-boiled veggies, including carrot, cabbage, long bean and a kind of gourd. An excellent lunch for 40 baht (just over $1) my only gripe being that they were a bit skimpy on the nam phrik pu.

As lunch approached people started filing in, ordering noodles:

 

curry over rice:

 

and some other meaty food:

 

Thai Airways International Head Office is located on 89 Vibhavadi-Rangsit Road, and as mentioned previously, the market and food center is located on a small street directly behind the building. Just look for all the hungry Thai employees.

click on the image This the the second dim sum shop to spring up in my neighborhood as of late. And by spring up I mean that quite literally; one day this was an empty building and virtually the next it was a fully decorated, functioning restaurant. Shit happens fast in BKK. 
After the surprisingly good grub at Chokdee Dim Sum I had somewhat high expectations for this new place. Unfortunatley it was not meant to be. For starters, rather than being able to choose your raw dim sum from a glass cabinet (thus giving you the opportunity to choose what looks fresh), at Shanghai you&apos;re given a short menu with photos of the choices:

 

which inevitably never look so nice in real life.

We began with the standard Thai dim sum starter, a hot bowl of bak kut te:

 

Spicy with black pepper and chock fulla pork ribs, dried mushrooms and tofu skin, it was not bad, but wholly unremarkable. This was followed by salapao , steamed filled buns:

 

again, astonishingly mediocre, and somehow they managed to simultaneously over and undercook them. Marginally better was stuffed squid:

 

My personal fave of the day were the poh pia thod , deep-fried spring rolls:

 

which were actually surprisingly tasty, but not enough to rescue an achingly average meal.

So it looks like I&apos;ll be driving the extra five minutes to get my dim sum fix at Chokdee . Shanghai Dim Sum is located at the far end of Soi Sena (near the Kaset-Navamin Highway), and looks like this:

 

And just in case there are any unemployed dim sum jockeys out there, the sign in front of the shop says they&apos;re hiring and salary starts at 6,000 baht (about $200) a month. It doesn&apos;t, however, mention anything about health care benefits or profit-sharing programs.

We ordered tom kha kai , a dish that&apos;s pretty much tom yam with coconut milk:

 

Despite not looking like the picture in the menu, this was really quite good, even more so because we almost never order this dish (I don&apos;t care for chicken, she doesn&apos;t care for coconut milk). It was pleasingly sour, with a healthy dose of everybody&apos;s favorite aromatic root, galangale (the khaa in the name), and with none of the cloying thickness of too much coconut milk.

The star of the meal was plaa muek phat khai khem , squid fried with salted preserved egg:

 

Sounds disturbing, I know, but was actually quite nice. The eggs, as the name suggests, are salted, so very little additional salt or fish sauce was needed. And the person who made it flash-fried the squid for just the right amount of time, leaving it tender and cooked, but only just so.

Conversely, the weakest dish of the day was khanaa phat nam man hoy , kai lan in oyster sauce:

 

On second thought, it wasn&apos;t bad, but just lacked personality, which ironic, as it&apos;s probably the easiest of the three to prepare!

Butterfly The Studio cafe looks like this:

 

and is located in a open-air shopping center called Plaza Lagoon (no lagoon here either, nor a plaza) in the Wang Hin area off of Soi Sena, northern Bangkok.

click on the image Tha Siam is a popular chain restaurant that serves kwaytiao ruea , &quot;boat noodles&quot;. This is a noodle dish that originated in central Thailand and which can be identified by its hearty brown/red broth, the result of copious spices and blood.

 

The importance of this last ingredient is made very clear on the menu:

 

where just below the evil pig logo it reads something like, &quot;true Thai blood&quot;.

Ironically, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever eaten noodles here; I&apos;m not a big fan of blood broth and actually the other menu items are all quite good. In particular, they have a short but great menu of isaan or NE Thai dishes. I ordered som tam laao , Lao-style papaya salad:

 

They do this dish just the way it should be done; with wide, irregular hand-cut chunks of crunchy unripe papaya, salted field crabs, plaa raa (unfiltered, unpasteurized fish sauce) and ma kok (a sour fruit). It&apos;s extremely sour and satisfyingly salty, with none of the sweetness you&apos;ll find in Thai-style papaya salad.

Everything was jolly until I received my khao phat naem , fried rice with naem , a kind of fermented pork sausage:

 

This was among the worst dishes I&apos;ve ever been served in a Thai restaurant. It looked like it had been sloppily slapped together by the dishwasher and featured a barely-chopped clove of garlic, pinky-sized chunks of naem and an astonishing amount of oil. In his/her haste to prepare the crappiest fried rice dish ever, the dishwater also forgot the obligatory sliced lime and dish of sliced chilies in fish sauce.

I guess that&apos;s what I get for ordering fried rice in a noodle restaurant.

We ate at Central Lad Phrao, but there are branches at Fashion Island and Siam Square, among others.

click on the image As the Thai food guy, am I really expected to comment on the current political situation? Well obviously I have some views on what&apos;s happening in Thailand, but perhaps you would be better served by getting your information from a highly opinionated Thai foodblogger , the Thai newsblog of the moment , or failing all else, you could always turn to the BBC as a last resort.

As for the state of things here in Bangok, which I feel qualified to comment on, it&apos;s really just rather...quiet. I was downtown this morning, hoping to get some interesting pics, but there was not much to see. Most of the last night&apos;s tanks have been moved elsewhere and other than some machine gun weilding soldiers here and there, it really just felt like a random Sunday morning in Bangkok. This is in strong contrast with last night, which was characterized by extreme uncertainty, creepy TV messages and communication blackouts. Where all this will lead, nobody knows, but the general feeling one gets here is that nobody is sorry to see Thaksin go, and if these clowns follow through with their promise to relenquish power in a year, then it might actually be a change for the better, albeit by highly unsavory means.

Despite all this, we&apos;ve still got to eat, and today I actually discoved a great restaurant near my house. The place is called Baan Chan, and specializes in the cuisine of the province of Chanthaburi, east of Bangkok near the Cambodian border. Today&apos;s lunch was excelllent, and they have a very interesting menu, so I&apos;ll definately be going back for a more detailed report. As a sneak preview, here&apos;s what I had there today, kaeng paa nuea , &quot;jungle curry&quot; with beef:

 

Normally kaeng paa is more souplike, but apparently in Chanthaburi it takes the form of a stirfry and was absolutely delcious--spicy with the famous Cambodian pepper, hearty green chilies and chunks of soft gourd-like vegetable. Behind the jungle curry is s stirfry of pumpkin with pork and the same green chili (known as phrik yuak ), good, but not as interesting as the kaeng paa. I can&apos;t wait to try the beef curry with nutmeg and the crab fried with Chanthaburi&apos;s famous rice noodles.

click on the image Known as sator in Thai, stink bean is the unfortunate English-language name of this podlike vegetable:

 

The &quot;beans&quot; are actually the large seeds found in the pod, and must be extracted and peeled beforehand. In Thailand, stink bean is mostly associated with southern Thai cooking, where it is eaten raw with dips, used in stir fries and even pickled. The name, although unnecessarily derogatory, is not all that innaccurate, as stink bean is probably one of the most pungent foods around.

Despite all this, I like it (as do many, many people in southern Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia), and find the flavor similar to an intense, but less biting, garlic. If you can get your hands on it, one of the easiest ways to prepare stink bean is this simple stir fry with some shrimp paste and seafood. I use squid in the recipe below, although you can replace this with shrimp or even pork if you like.

Squid Fried with Stink Bean
(Serves 2 as part of a southern Thai meal)

Ingredients

 

Cooking oil 3 Tbsp
Garlic 3 cloves
Shrimp paste 1 Tbsp
Onion 1/4, sliced thinly
&apos;Banana chili&apos; 2, sliced thinly
Water 1/4 cup
Squid 100g
Halved stink beans 50 g
Fish sauce 1 Tbsp, or to taste

Method
Using a mortar and pestle or a food processor grind garlic and shrimp paste together into a rough paste. Set aside.

Wash and slice squid into 1&quot; wide rings. Set aside.

In a wok over medium-high heat, heat cooking oil and add shrimp paste mixture. Stirring constantly, fry until fragrant, about two minutes. Add onions and and chili, fry briefly, and add most of the water. Allow mixture to simmer and reduce, stirring constantly, until it reaches a gravy-like consistency. Increase heat to high and add stink beans and squid, stirring constantly. Add fish sauce to taste and saute until squid is cooked, about two minutes.

 

Serve hot with rice and try to avoid talking to other people for at least three hours.

click on the image Regular readers will know that I&apos;m a big fan of Thai-Muslim cuisine. I like the dried spices, something that&apos;s rarely found in &quot;Buddhist&quot; Thai cooking, I love khao mok , Thai-style biryani , and most importantly, I also live a mere couple kilos from one of the best Muslim restaurants in town . But I also like to make ahaan mussalim at home, and today I made sup haang wua , Muslim-style oxtail soup, for the first time.

The recipe below is taken from an excellent Thai-language cookbook called ahaan mussalim (&quot; Muslim Food &quot;, published by Sang Dad press), although I&apos;ve altered it considerably (the original recipe called for 2 kg of oxtails!). One thing to keep in mind is that when making any kind of Thai food, don&apos;t follow the seasoning directions to the last word. Season to reach a taste that you find favorable, or the primary flavor that the particular dish should have. For instance, this dish should be sour, followed by salty. This basic recipe could also be followed, with some obvious alterations, to make an excellent chicken soup as well.

Oxtail Soup Sup Haang Wua 
(Serves 4)

 

Ingredients
Oxtails 1 kg
Butter 3 Tbsp
Cardamom 4
Cloves 5
Cinnamon 2 small pieces
Onion, chopped 3 Tbsp
Garlic, chopped 2 Tbsp
Ginger, sliced 5 slices
Freshly roasted and ground
coriander seeds 3/4 Tbsp
Freshly roasted and ground
cumin 1/2 Tbsp
Turmeric powder 1/4 tsp
Water 2 l
Crispy fried shallots 100 ml
Salt 3 Tbsp
Coriander root 3
Onion 1/2 large, sliced
Tomato 2, seeded and sliced
Lime juice 100 ml
Small chilies 20, bruised
Coriander 1 bunch, chopped

Method
Place oxtails in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, remove from heat and drain water. Set oxtails aside.

In another large saucepan, heat butter over medium-low heat and add cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, chopped onion, garlic and ginger. Saute over medium-low heat until onion is translucent, and add ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric powder. Saute until ingredients are yellow and fragrant, about two minutes. Add oxtails, water and half of the crispy fried shallots and increase heat. When mixture has reached a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and add and coriander roots and salt. Allow to simmer until oxtails are soft and falling off the bone, at least 2 hours.

Add onion and tomato and half of the lime juice and chilies. Allow mixture to simmer an additional 10 minutes. Taste and add additional salt, lime juice or chilies if necessary. Remove from heat.

Garnish with coriander and remaining crispy fried shallots and serve with rice.

Pok, pok pok! This sound, the unmistakable hollow thud of unripe papaya being pounded in a clay mortar, is a rallying call for Thailand’s favorite dish, som tam. Unlike other foods where a delicious odor or artful presentation is the impetus to dig in, the advertising technique of the som tam vendor is a bell-like ring, which for many has become associated with this spicy snack.

Som tam, a salad of strips of crispy green papaya, has its origins in the rural kitchens of northeastern Thailand. The recipe is a probably recent one, as the many of the main ingredients (papaya, tomatoes, chilies, limes) were first brought to Thailand from South America in the 16th century. Nonetheless, the dish spread quickly and can now be found in virtually every city in Thailand, and is by all accounts the de facto national dish. In a country with such a diversity of food, what is it about this particular invention that makes it so popular?

 

One explanation is that som tam successfully combines all four of the essential flavours of Thai cooking: hot, sour, salty and sweet. In this case the hot comes from the liberal use of fresh chilies, the sour from a squeeze of lime juice, the salty from fish sauce, and the sweet from palm sugar. Another reason for its popularity is that the dish is a nearly perfect snack food, its intense spiciness providing a mental “full” while at the same time still being relatively light. Thus som tam can and is consumed between meals on street corners and in office buildings, a fiery fix to hold one over until the next meal.

Som tam can be neatly divided into two schools. The isaan or northeastern Thai style is considered by many to be the “real” som tam, and features hearty strips of papaya pounded up with chilies and a thick, unfiltered fish sauce known as plaa raa. The salad is typically bulked out with ingredients ranging from preserved freshwater crabs to ma kok, a tart fruit. The other type of som tam is a more modern take favored by city dwellers that revolves around fine threads of crispy papaya dressed with bottled fish sauce, tomatoes, green beans, roasted peanuts and dried shrimp. This version tends to emphasize sweet and sour flavors, and is generally eaten as a snack. Regardless of the style, som tam is always made to order, and the degree of spiciness or tartness is determined by the customer.

 

Despite its popularity, som tam is still largely relegated to the streets, and in a case of reverse discrimination, som tam vendors are almost exclusively female. The dish is made by first bruising the more resilient ingredients, a few small cloves of garlic, the pasty palm sugar, and a generous handful of tiny fresh chilies. Next, a handful of shredded green papaya is added and the mixture is given a few strong thumps before adding a splash of fish sauce and a squeeze of fresh lime or tamarind pulp. At this point the som tam is simultaneously mixed and pounded, often using a spoon along with the wooden pestle in an effort to combine the flavours thoroughly.

As a reminder of its northeastern origins, som tam is typically served with sticky rice, the staple grain of this part of the country, as well as a side dish of raw vegetables and herbs typically including Thai basil, sliced cucumber and strips of cabbage, believed to help counteract the spiciness of the dish. Order a plate of kai yang, grilled chicken with your som tam and sticky rice, and you have yourself a complete northeastern Thai-style meal.

 

Regardless of how you eat it, som tam is a virtual embodiment of Thai food, a time-tested combination of simple and fresh ingredients boasting strong flavors. The sound effects are a bonus.

Eating the island
ThaiDay, 22/07/06

Walk down the streets of virtually any part of Koh Samui and you can find restaurants selling the food Italy, Japan, Greece, Australia, England and Germany. Ironically, one cuisine missing from all this is the cuisine of Koh Samui, a variant of southern Thai cooking with a unique island touch. The cooking of Koh Samui remained relegated to home kitchens and housewives until relatively recently, when a few natives decided to share their secrets with the rest of us.

 
 A fishing village on the coast of Ko Samui 

“I was the first person to open a restaurant on Koh Samui featuring local food,” explains Sookhkoe Donsai, the owner of Bangpo Seafood (077 420 010). Wearing only shorts and a smile, Ta Koe (“Grandpa Koe”), as he is affectionately known, is a native of Samui, and owner of one of the island’s most well respected Thai restaurants.

“I used to be a lawyer and got to travel all over Thailand,” explains the 58 year-old. “I noticed that each province had a place to sample its local dishes, which made me realize that Koh Samui had nothing like this. So after coming back home, I opened this restaurant.” This was 13 years ago, and today the success of Ta Koe’s restaurant has largely been responsible for inspiring other Thai restaurants on Koh Samui to include local dishes on their menus.

 
 Khoey jii, a dip of shrimp paste and coconut, Bangpo Seafood, Ko Samui. 

The emphasis at Ta Koe’s restaurant, as well as the base for much of Koh Samui’s native cuisine is, not surprisingly, seafood. However, unlike the grilled prawn and phat thai cuisine featured in most tourist restaurants, the food of Koh Samui is spicy and salty, featuring strong flavors and making good use of the ingredients at hand.

Often these ingredients tend to be the relatively easy to gather items that can be found just offshore, such as the devoutly inedible-looking sea urchin. Ta Koe explains that during the right season, the people of Koh Samui would pry the sea urchins off of the coral, crack them open and eat the rich roe found inside. At Bangpo Seafood raw sea urchin roe is mixed with curry paste, shredded mango and chilies into a yam, or Thai-style salad. “The salad has to be sour and spicy to counter the fishy taste of the urchin,” explains Ta Koe. A taste reveals that the salad is indeed spicy, but rather than tasting simply fishy as Ta Koe describes it, suggests the pungent saltiness of Samui’s clear waters.

 
 Yam hoy men, a &apos;salad&apos; of raw sea urchin roe, Bangpo Seafood, Ko Samui. 

Another fruit of the sea available at Bangpo Seafood is a small octopus known locally as waay. “It comes out early in the morning when the water is cool,” explains Ta Koe of the mollusk, which is considered a staple of Samui cooking. Ta Koe goes on to say that when in season, fresh waay is used in tom som, a spicy/sour soup similar to tom yam, and out of season, the dried meat is quickly rejuvenated in water before being stewed with fresh coconut milk and bruised herbs, a dish equal parts sweet, salty and savory.

Fish is another staple food on Koh Samui, and at Bangpo Seafood fresh fish is prepared using a local method known as hoop ping, meaning that it is splayed and rubbed with a mixture of coconut milk, fresh turmeric, black pepper and salt before being grilled over coals. The turmeric mixture gives the fish a pleasant orange hue, eliminates any “fishy” odors, and negates the need for any dipping sauce.

 
 Grilled fish Samui-style, with turmeric and coconut milk, Bangpo Seafood, Ko Samui. 

The residents of Ko Samui have long made use of the sea’s other treasures, notably its seaweed, and one place to sample this unique ingredient is Kin Khao Bang Kham (077 426 181), another seafood restaurant whose menu features a few local dishes.

Toom, the restaurant’s head chef and a native of Koh Samui describes how the seaweed, known as saraay khor, is gathered from the beach in the mornings after the tide recedes. “It’s getting harder and harder to find nowadays,” he laments. Toom, who was interviewed on a Thai TV program about this very ingredient, goes on to explain that the seaweed is then rinsed and par-boiled before being combined with other ingredients in a Thai-style salad, a dish that has made the restaurant popular among locals. “The seaweed [off of Koh Samui] is very good,” he says. “The ocean floor is muddy, which is good for the seaweed and makes it fat and crunchy.”

Not all of the ingredients found in the Samui kitchen come from the sea. Indeed, Koh Samui’s cash crop is coconut, the extracted milk of which seems to find its way into virtually every local dish. “People from Samui feel that if they eat a soup or curry that doesn’t have coconut milk they don’t feel full.” This according to Sermsi Thongrueang, a native of Samui and owner of a traditional sauna and massage business located in her family’s 80 year-old home just minutes from the sea.

Sermsi, who also has a reputation as a knowledgeable cook, has agreed to demonstrate how to make two local dishes, both of which include coconut milk. The first dish is known locally as khao man thua khiaow, and is simply rice cooked in coconut milk along with salt and dried beans, a dish that, despite its simplicity, has become very hard to find nowadays. “We used to make it in a clay pot,” explains Sermsi. “This adds to the flavor.” Today however Sermsi makes the dish in an electric rice cooker, something of an anomaly in her ancient teak wood home.

 
 A grove of coconut palms, Ko Samui. 

As an accompaniment to the rich rice dish, Sermsi makes khoey jii, a unique side dish of roasted shrimp paste. Marching into her sandy yard the energetic 65 year-old comes back with a single coconut that she thrusts onto an exposed stake to pry away its thick husk. Taking the coconut into the kitchen she cracks it open and uses a traditional sit-down shredder to extract some of the mature meat inside. This meat is ground up in a mortar and pestle along with shrimp paste, chilies, garlic and shallots, and the resulting paste is spread onto the inside portion of a coconut shell and grilled over coals until fragrant.

The dishes are, like much of local Samui cuisine, salty and pleasantly oily, and employ ingredients that can be found with little effort. “Before, people on Koh Samui didn’t have to buy anything,” reflects Sermsi. “We fished ourselves, raised chickens and grew coconut. The only thing we ever had to buy was pork.”

Also making good use of the abundant coconut is Sabeinglae (077 233 082), an open-air seafood restaurant largely frequented by locals.

“I don’t know how to cook, but I know how the food should taste,” reveals Sabeinglae’s owner, Amnat Chotchong. “I grew up right here on the beach, and I’ve been eating this food since I was a kid.” When asked where the recipes in his restaurant come from, Amnat describes how at community or religious festivals, where there tends to be lots of communal food, he would taste the different dishes, find the best one, and ask the cook how she made it. “These old ladies don’t mind giving their secrets away,” he laughs.

One such find is Sabeinglae’s kaeng khua het loop, a rich coconut milk-based curry using het loop, the small anemone-like beche-de-mer found on the coral surrounding Koh Samui. The curry is thick but not oily, and is laced with a generous handful of fragrant-but-spicy cumin leaves, another common ingredient on Koh Samui. Like many of the ingredients in local dishes, the het loop is strictly seasonal, close at hand, and comes from the sea; just some of the elements of a delicious island cuisine that is finally being discovered.

click on the image One of the most bizarre dishes in Thailand is khao phat amerikan , American fried rice. This is rice that has been fried--like we always do back home in the States--with the addition of ketchup, sliced hot dogs and raisins, and if you&apos;re lucky, a fried egg. Other than this culinary train wreck, there aren&apos;t too many dishes in Thailand that attempt to combine Western and Thai cooking. Steaks (i.e. pork chops) are popular, especially in Bangkok, but fried meat is more or less universal, and there&apos;s no lemongrass or kaffir lime leaf involved. &quot;Bread&quot; (I use this term in the loosest sense possible) is also very common throughout the country, but for the most part takes the form of fluffy, sweet imitations of Real Bread , without any real attempt to make it &quot;Thai&quot;. You&apos;ll also be hard-pressed to find tom yam pot pies or green curry with salmon (actually, I could be wrong here). In general, Thais like their Thai food Thai, and their Western food staunchly quasi-Western. However, one dish that successfully combines both Thai and Western cooking is spaghetti plaa khem , spaghetti with salted fish,

 

Lest you assume in your haste that &quot;salted fish&quot; refers to anchovies, it&apos;s actually the very Thai plaa insee , Spanish mackerel. At the neighborhood joint where I consumed the above, a chunk of this extremely salty fish was deep-fried until crispy, before being broken up and sauteed with some garlic, dried chilies and oddly enough, canned mushrooms, the only time I&apos;ve ever seen or eaten this stuff in Thailand. This was briefly sauteed with spaghetti and topped with bai horaphaa , Thai sweet basil, that had been deep-fried until crispy. The result was salty, spicy and satisfying, and although it wasn&apos;t capable of inspiring misty-eyed reflections of my youth in the Old Country quite like American fried rice can, it was still a pretty good lunch.

click on the image Isaan (northeast Thai) food is something you can&apos;t avoid here in Bangkok. I reckon there&apos;s more som tam , kai yaang and sticky rice here than in the whole of northeast Thailand. A lot of it tends to be pretty hardcore streetfood; think tripe and liver hanging from rusty hooks, dripping blood on shredded papaya, the whole lot coated with a delicate but fragrant film of auto exhaust. Alternatively there&apos;s lots of isaan mall food; chain restaurants serving well-presented and generally clean isaan food, but made for Bangkok tongues (read: sweet). For the most part, there&apos;s not a whole lot of the well-prepared, authentic, sanitary in-between. Luckily I recently came across a place that comes pretty close. Kai Tong (&quot;rooster&quot;), located on Soi Sena 1, is an old-school sitdown restaurant complete with upholstered booths and uniformed wait staff. Definately not the norm for an isaan place.

We started with the restaurant&apos;s specialty, kai yaang , grilled chicken:

 

And a mighty good bird it was. I think they claim it is kai baan , free-range chicken, but it actually had a bit too much meat on the bone for my taste (chicken meat is virtually tasteless--it&apos;s the fat and skin that tastes good. Believe me.). The chicken comes with a sweet syrup, chili and plum-based dip, and an absolutely delicious jaew , salty/spicy/sour dip made from dried chilies and tamarind pulp.

Following this was som tam pu plaa raa , Lao/isaan-style papaya salad with salted rice field crabs and a thick form of fish sauce:

 

Almost perfect. If they hadn&apos;t beaten the life out of the papaya with the mortar and pestle it would have been perfect. One thing, okay, two things I like about the som tam here is that they&apos;re not afraid to add garlic, a lot of garlic, and it&apos;s exceedingly sour.

And finally we had tom saeb , an issan-style sour soup:

 

We&apos;re not big meat eaters, so we asked for mushrooms instead. Not bad, but a little too sweet. Do like the presentation though.

The only bad thing I could say about the restaurant is that the isaan menu isn&apos;t very expansive. They have the 10 or so favorites that you can find pretty much anywhere. They do do them quite well though!

Kai Tong is located on Soi Sena 1, about 2 km from the intersection with Phaholyothin.

click on the image Coconut milk-based curries are among the first Thai dishes I ever tried to make. And they never turned out right. Never. I didn&apos;t know then that these kind of curries are among the most difficult Thai dishes to make. There are a couple reasons for this. For one, there are two very different ways of making them. The most common curries, the ones you see with a layer of oil floating on top, are made my slowly sauteeing the khreuang kaeng (curry paste) in the &quot;thick&quot; coconut milk until the coconut oil &quot;breaks&quot; and emerges to the top. The &quot;thin&quot; or diluted coconut milk is then added towards the end. Alternatively, there curries where you begin with thin coconut milk, and slowly add the thick so that a layer of oil doesn&apos;t form! The curry below is the latter, and I think kind is much easier to make. Although one danger with this kind of curry is that it can get too thick and creamy. You want the end result to be just slightly watery, not too thick. If it does get too thick then add some plain water (or dilulted coconut milk) at the end. And remember to season to taste! The pineapple in this recipe will give the curry a sweet taste, so only a bit of sugar (if any) is necessary.

If you follow these directions exactly, and use some good-quality mussels, I guarantee you&apos;ll like this one.

Curry with Mussels and Pineapple Kaeng Sapparot Kap Hoy Malaengphoo 
(Serves 4)

 

Ingredients
Curry Paste
Large dried chilies 10, seeds removed, softened in warm water
Small dried chilies 20
Salt 1 tsp
Peppercorns 1 tsp
Galingale, chopped 1 Tbsp
Lemongrass, chopped 3 stalks
Kaffir lime peel, chopped 1 tsp
Garlic 30 small cloves
Chopped fresh turmeric 1 tsp
Shallots 5, sliced
Shrimp paste 1 tsp
Mussels 1 kg
Thin coconut milk* 500 ml
Thick coconut milk** 250 ml
Chopped pineapple 250 ml
Fish sauce 2 Tbsp
Sugar 2 tsp
Tamarind paste 2 Tbsp

*Thin coconut milk is canned coconut milk that has been diluted, 50%, with water.
**Thick coconut milk is the coconut milk that comes directly from the can.

Method
Starting with your curry paste ingredients:

 

Use a mortar and pestle or a food processor grind them together until you get this:

 

Set aside.

Wash and de-beard the mussels. Bring a large pot of a water to the boil and add the mussels, and boil until they open, about 3 minutes. When cool enough to handle, remove the meat and set aside. Discard the shells.

Over medium heat, bring the thin coconut milk to a gentle boil. Add the curry paste and stir until fully blended with the coconut milk.

 

Increase heat slightly and add mussels and pineapple.

 

Gradually add remaining thick coconut milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, stirring to combine. Don&apos;t let the curry boil to rapidly, or the undesired coconut oil might separate. Add fish sauce, sugar and tamarind. Bring to a final boil and add remaining thick coconut milk.

 

Serve hot with rice as part of a Thai meal.

click on the image A few months ago I visited the morning market in Nonthaburi and posted some pics . Well I was back there again this morning and took a few more images worth sharing. If you weren&apos;t around the first time, Nonthaburi is a province just north of Bangkok whose market is a huge affair located next to the Chao Phraya River. There&apos;s lots of fruit from the surrounding provinces, and it&apos;s one of the few places in Thailand where you&apos;ll see bicycle rickshaws still in action. I&apos;d really recommend it to market hounds or just people interested in Thai food. To get there take the Chao Phraya River Express boat to the northernmost stop, or tell a taxi driver to go to thaa ruea non (&quot;Nonthaburi boat pier&quot;), the market is only a block away.

 

Selling cutting boards:

 

which, I&apos;ve read somewhere, are usually made from tamarind wood.

Dragonfruit:

 

The flesh inside is white and speckled with tiny black seeds; quite different from the outside!

There&apos;s lots of seafood at the Nonthaburi market, including artfully arranged mussels and clams:

 

a kind of fish known as plaa jeen , &quot;Chinese fish&quot;:

 

and lots of eels and turtles:

 

Other products from nature include honey:

click on the image Lemon Farm is a grocery store chain in Bangkok that sells &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; produce and other products. I&apos;m making a point of using &quot;&quot; here because as far as I know, there is no agreed upon standard for organic produce here in Thailand. There is however a great demand for these kind of products, and most grocery stores in Bangkok have a section with products labelled as &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;green&quot; or &quot;healthy&quot;. I think that more often than not, these labels are simply slapped on products, along with an increase in price, without any real regard to how their produced. Regardless of this, the produce at Lemon Farm is good, although slightly more expensive than elsewhere. I&apos;ve been shopping there for years, and like the free-range eggs and formalin-free fish. I also like to buy products that are made by small community organizations and government programs.

A new Lemon Farm opened near my house recently, and we stopped by for lunch. Every branch of Lemon Farm has a small cafe serving a few mostly vegetarian dishes. One of these, khao yam is a southern Thai dish, and takes the form of a &quot;salad&quot; of rice and fresh herbs. The version served at Lemon Farm is not a traditional one, but rather an &quot;herbal&quot; take on the dish, with some unusual additions such as carrot, sesame and brown rice:

 

The dish traditionally also includes puffed rice, shredded green mango, pomelo, thinly-sliced lemon grass, green beans and &quot;wing beans&quot;, dried shrimp, grated coconut, and oh yeah, a bit of rice. The whole lot is topped with a type of southern fish sauce called budu that has been simmered with palm sugar and even more fresh herbs. The best part is mixing all these different ingredients into one big delicious mess:

 

Despite the unorthodox additions, it is an excellent khao yam, just as good, or even better, than anything you&apos;ll get in the south.

The cafe also has khanom jeen , fermented rice noodles served with a curry sauce:

 

Normally the curry sauce is made from fish (usually plaa chon , snakehead fish), but this being &quot;health&quot; restaurant, the noodles are made from brown rice, and they&apos;ve substituted the fish with mushrooms. Like khao yam, you also mix a variety of fresh herbs and veggies into the dish:

 

Despite the lack of fish, it was actually a pretty good khanom jeen by any standards.

This is a street in Ko Rattanakosin, Olde Bangkok, that is known for its Chinese shophouse architecture and its insane variety of eats. I have to admit that I&apos;m somewhat of a newcomer to Thanon Tanao. I&apos;ve passed through several times, but it wasn&apos;t until relatively recently that I discovered just how much good food there is here.

Here&apos;s a view of the street from the Ratchadamnoen Klang end:

 

On the right you&apos;ll see our first stop, Kim Leng:

 

This is small restaurant that serves up good central Thai/Bangkok fare such as curries, dips and Chinese stir fries. Most of the dishes are made in advance, so you can just choose whatever looks good, and they also make some dishes to order. I&apos;d recommend the nam phrik kapi , a shrimp paste &quot;dip&quot; that is served with par-boiled veggies, and battered and deep-fried eggplant and mackerel.

Next, for fans of isaan (northeast Thai) food, we go a couple blocks up the street to a place called Kai Yaang Boraan (02 622 2349), which serves grilled chicken, papaya salad and other Lao-style specialties. It&apos;s not the best isaan food you&apos;ll ever find, but I think it&apos;s a very good introduction to the cuisine, as they have all the standards and the shop is spotless. It&apos;s also probably the only air-conditioned restaurant along the strip.

Continuing on the same side of the street, the next interesting place we&apos;ll come to is Raad Naa Yod Phak:

 

As the name suggests, this place serves raad naa , noodles in a sticky broth that I don&apos;t really care for. Much better, in my opinion, is phat see iw :

 

These are the same noodles as raad naa, but are fried &quot;dry&quot; with the addition of soy sauce, egg, pork, and the tender shoots of kai lan. They do an excellent job here, frying the noodles up in a huge wok that allows them to get slightly burnt and acquire a delicious smoky flavor.

Passing a large Chinese shrine, we now reach a street called Thanon Phraeng Nara. This is an excellent food street, with many of the restaurants located right on the sidewalk.

 

 

One of the first places you&apos;ll see is Khanom Beuang Phraeng Nara:

 

 Khanom bueang are small &quot;tacos&quot; that come in two forms: salty and sweet. The sweet ones:

 

are filled with a mixture of shredded egg yolk, coconut meat and dried fruit. They are made on a charcoal stove, so they also have a slightly smoky flavor, and are at their sublime best when hot and crispy. The khanom bueang here are easily among the best Thai desserts I&apos;ve ever had, and are completely different from the cream-filled impostors you&apos;ll find elsewhere in Bangkok.

Just up the road is a popular noodle stand:

 

Where we&apos;ll stop for a quick bowl:

 

before continuing on. As we u-turn and go back to Thanon Tanao we&apos;ll pass a very tempting phat thai kung sot :

 

But we&apos;ll have to say no thanks here, as we still haven&apos;t reached our goal, the acclaimed hole-in-the-wall, Chotechitr (02 221 4082):

 

This is a tiny restaurant that, since having been mentioned in a New York Times article last year, has gained a cult-like following among foreigners in Bangkok. Being the Thai Food Guy, I was tired of sheepishly admitting that, No... I&apos;ve never actually eaten there... So we&apos;re going to make a point of stopping by today. We begin with yam tamleung , a spicy/sour &quot;salad&quot; of tamleung , a vinelike green:

 

An excellent dish. More than sufficiently sour with just a hint of sweetness, and as we know, a handful of giant prawns and squid never hurt anybody. This is followed by kaeng paa plaa kraay , &quot;jungle&quot; curry with fish dumplings:

 

A less successful effort, in my opinion. This is a dish that should not under any circumstances be sweet, but in true Bangkok style, bordered on the dessertlike here. The homemade fish dumplings were excellent though. Finally, there was moo thod krathiam phrik thai , pork fried with garlic and peppercorns:

 

This is my favorite dish, and not just because it contained mad amounts of garlic and pepper, but because it was obvious that the person making it employed some restraint and didn&apos;t fry the hell out of it. The pork was tender--possibly the first time I&apos;ve consumed tender pork in Thailand--and the other flavors, salty and just slightly sweet, were perfectly balanced.

Continuing on the same small street where Chotechitr is found is a small community called Phraeng Phuton. There are several longstanding restaurants here, and one good choice is Udom Pochana:

 

This place has serving food here for 60 years. They do mostly Chinese-style dishes, such as bamee , wheat-noodle soup, and wonton soup, as well as the somewhat more obscure kalee , &quot;curry&quot;:

 

This is a very old-school dish that is hard to find nowadays and is obviously different that your average Thai curry. The dish is actually more like a gravy than a curry, and there&apos;s little trace of spices of any kind. The above was the beef version, and is served with sweet potatoes and cucumber.

This is just a tiny taste of what&apos;s available along and around Thanon Tanao. I&apos;ve yet to visit the place that makes pig brain soup, or the famous Thai ice cream restaurant in Phraeng Phuthon, so there will certainly be additional excursions. Stay tuned.

I expect the highlight to be Penang, where thanks to Bee at Rasa Malaysia , I&apos;ll be stuffing my gob with the finest street food Georgetown has to offer. But it promises to be a full trip, with interludes in fine dining in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, and Malay-Portuguese fusion food in Melaka. Details to follow...

Penang appears to be the latest hot destination among SE Asian foodbloggers. Chubby Hubby was there , Karen of ramblingspoon recently made a visit , and of course there&apos;s Bee of Rasa Malaysia , a native of the place, and a frequent blogger on the food of her hometown. If you ask me, all this attention is justified, as Penang has got to be one of the greatest food cities in SE Asia. I was able to learn this firsthand on a visit to the city a week ago. I have been to Penang several times previously, but was always kind of overwhelmed by the food scene there. I&apos;m not too knowledgeable about Chinese food, which forms the bulk of eats in Penang, and couldn&apos;t tell a lo bak from an oh chien if my life depended on it. However, with the help of the previously mentioned Bee, I was able to make some sense of Penang&apos;s eats, and had a fantastic three day long meal. If you&apos;re thinking of visiting yourself, go to her blog where you&apos;ll find an amazing resource for Penang food-related info.

Street food in Penang takes several forms. The most well-known are the city&apos;s hawker centres. There are semi-contained areas that are specifically designated for selling street food, essentially keeping the food off the streets! My favorite example of this was the Gurney Drive Hawker Centre:

 

This was the largest, although possibly most &quot;commercial&quot; hawker centre I came across in Penang. It&apos;s popular among tourists, but there are also lots of locals. And there&apos;s an amazing array of food, ranging from all the various Chinese treats that Penang is associated with, to Malaysian and even Indian eats. I personally liked the rojak:

 

a &apos;salad&apos; of crispy fruits and vegetables (such as pineapple, cucumber, jicama, among others) mixed up with a copious sweet/savoury shrimp paste sauce and topped with ground peanuts--when done well among the most delicious things in the world.

Also delcious were fried oysters:

 

Unlike the Thai dish , which tends to be cripsy and flavourless, oh chien, as they are known here, have a soft texture, lots of egg, and a delicious garlicky flavour. The oysters are tiny things often the size of a fingernail, but are almost never overcooked and are, well, just OK. The dish as a whole is great though.

For a hawker centre that&apos;s a bit more &quot;authentic&quot; there&apos;s the gritty collection of stalls known as New Lane:

 

Here I enjoyed chee cheong fun:

 

a deciptively simple dish of steamed noodles sprinkled with sesame and served with three different sauces. I say deceptively because the dish looks bland, but the sauces, in particular the spicy/savoury one, had an incredible depth of flavour, and the noodles were tender and delicious.

If you need more noodles, this guy makes a popular won ton soup:

 

but I was more interested in trying some authentic satay:

 

The above was prepared by this lady:

 

who, as you can see, intentionally used fatty pieces of meat and let them flare up, which gave the sate a wonderfully smoky flavour.

The food fun in Penang isn&apos;t limited to the night. In fact it starts out quite early, at Penang&apos;s morning market. There, in addition to the various raw ingredients, you can also find prepared foods such as Chinese-style curries and fried dishes:

 

Kuay kak:

 

essentially fried cubes of dough. This is not something that would normally appeal to me, but the combination of the salty sauce and charred essence of the pan made this dish delicious. It was actually quite similiar in form and flavour to the fried oysters.

Loh bak,

 

proved to be one of my favorite snacks. This dish consists of tender pork, and I believe, crab and/or shrimp, wrapped in a sheet tofu skin and deep-fried. The result is served with two dipping sauces, one sweet/sour and one a bit more salty/savoury.

As if this wasn&apos;t enough, there are also hawker centres and food courts that are only open during lunch time. A good example of this can be found on Lorong Selamat where I enjoyed the Penang favorite, char kway teow:

 

wide rice noodles fried with chili sauce, egg, cockles and shrimp.

Normally I&apos;m not a big fan of Asian sweets, but the iced kacang at Swatow Lane converted me:

 

This is basically finely crushed iced topped with a seemingly random array of sweet things such as syrup, grass jelly, beans and here, sliced jackfruit. On a hot Penang day I can&apos;t imagine anything more refreshing.

Many of the daytime hawker stalls are like large indoor cafes:

 

and serve dishes such as assam laksa:

 

a thick broth of fish and fresh herbs, served with thick udon-like noodles. This is among Penang&apos;s most famous foods.

And come evening again, if you haven&apos;t got time for an entire meal, then a good option is lok lok:

 

This is a variety of skewered meats and veggies, which you dip in a boiling water to cook, and then top with one of two sauces before eating. Standing room only.

For me, a special highlight of Penang food was the amazing diversity of Indian and Muslim foods. Both of these are somewhat hard to find in Bangkok, so I always eat my fill when I&apos;m in Malaysia. I was in for a special treat during my visit to Penang, as it coincided with ramadan, where at the end of every day of fasting, known as the buka puasa, several stalls selling food emerge on the streets. Penang&apos;s Little India had a great deal of these, and a particularly popular treat was a kind of bread known as roti jala:

 

The weblike shape is made by pouring the liquid batter through a seive:

 

Other treats included fresh coconut juice:

 

and some obscenely sweet-looking fried bread:

 

Not to mention a whole host of other sweet foods (does fasting create a desire for sweet foods?):

 

If I had any complaint about Penang&apos;s street food, it would probably be the extreme lack of vegetables and the extreme overabundance of starch. Penang&apos;s Chinese community seems to survive on noodles alone, with the Muslim community seemingly surviving on rice (or breads) and meat. And between either of these, there&apos;s hardly any green to be seen. There is of course lots of southern Indian vegetarian, which is delicious, but the veggies are usually pretty overcooked and mushy. Followers of weird American reduced carbohydrate diets consider yourselves forewarned...

 To see the full image or to start a slideshow,
click on the image I must begin by admitting that I&apos;m really lagging behind on this one; Chubby Hubby scooped me by visiting Flava, the brand-new Dream Hotel&apos;s funky Thai restaurant, several weeks ago. You can see his description and wonderful pics here . But I already had plans to visit the restaurant for an article I was working on, and thought it would be fun to couple this with a blog on my meal.

All meals at Flava start with a complimentary dish of khao tang na tang:

 

This is essentially puffed rice crackers served with a dipping sauce. I normally like this dish, but when I saw the recipe that Chubby Hubby had got from Flava&apos;s chef, I was pretty skeptical. The inclusion of red curry paste makes it seem like the kind of Thai dish inspired by a recipe on the back of a box of American Pad Thai Noodles. It was better than that, although it still lacked the salty savouriness that this dish should have.

Our meal proper started with Yam chao suan, a &quot;salad&quot; of banana flower and young coconut with prawns and shredded chicken:

 

This odd combination of ingredients was, well... odd, but not bad. I&apos;m not a big fan of banana flower to begin with, so the tart, astringent taste didn&apos;t really win me over. It looks lovely though, doesn&apos;t it?

In an effort to order something slightly unusual, I chose Lon ta jiew:

 

This dish, a savoury &quot;dip&quot; of fermented soybeans, coconut milk and fresh herbs, is a really Thai dish that one doesn&apos;t normally see on too many menus. Flava&apos;s version was just OK, definately nothing to write home about. The requisite saltiness of the fermented soybeans just wasn&apos;t there, and there was little hint of the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf, galingal and other fresh herbs that should be in full force here. And the selection of veggies served along with the dish was pretty dull.

Next was Bour thot goong, shrimp wrapped in bai cha phluu , wild tea leaf, and deep-fried a la tempura:

 

A fun, and well-prepared dish.

We also had Goong tom yam hang, a &quot;dry&quot; tom yam consisting mostly huge prawns:

 

At this point, you might have noticed a trend: prawns. Upscale Thai restaurants tend to unmercifully unload prawns on their diners. My theory on this is that in the West, prawns, at least large, good-quality ones, are very expensive, and chefs here can easily wow foreign diners (who constitute the vast majority at upscale Thai restaurants--Thais eat elsewhere) by including them at every turn. To the restaurant&apos;s credit, the prawn dishes were all done very well, including the above, and it was probably our own fault for ordering so many dishes that included them. But like many upscale Thai restaurants, the menu seemed to be dominated by this one ingredient.

The hands-down winner of the meal was the Geang prik kraduk moo, &quot;Pork spare ribs braised in black peppercorns and red curry&quot;:

 

This is a variant of a southern Thai dish, and it was clear that the chef was confident about this one--not a surprise as Flava&apos;s Sous Chef is a native of Phuket. The curry was spicy, but it was the warmth of black pepper, rather than the burn of chilies. The pork was tender, and as you can see, the herbs are there in full force. I can still taste this one.

Flava&apos;s dining room is super funky, and I loved the unorthadox presentation of the dishes, especially the splashes of turmeric-laced oil and the grindings of black pepper. I&apos;d recommend it to novice Thai diners, or to those looking for solid and tasty, but not exceptional Thai food, in an exceptional setting.

Every year at October, many Thais of Chinese origin choose to wear white, abstain from eating meat (and garlic and alcohol), and spend lots of time at the temple. Apparently there are significant historical and religious reasons behind all this, but we&apos;re really only interested in the food, aren&apos;t we?

And there&apos;s much to be had at this week-long festival. Many restaurants choose to serve only vegetarian food (known in Thai as ahaan jay ), advertising their choice by flying the yellow flag seen above. Not all of the food is very good, but it&apos;s a fun time to try new things that aren&apos;t normally available. I happened to be in Yaowarat, Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, the center of much of this meat-free madness, and did some exploring. I started the day with a tasty dish of kwaytiaow lord :

 

hearty rice noodles topped with a few different kinds of tofu and bean sprouts. This was accompanied by a to-go bag of delicious deep-fried spring rolls:

 

These two dishes more or less set the tone of the day, as despite this being a vegetarian festival, there are surprisingly few vegetables to be seen. Starchy stuff such as noodles:

 

and steamed buns:

 

make up the bulk of this &quot;vegetarian&quot; cuisine. Apparently the Chinese have a difficult time parting with their beloved flesh, making their vegetarian food as similar to meat possible, as illustrated in the astonishingly lifelike &quot;duck&quot; meat below:

 

as well as the wide variety of amazingly realistic vegetarian &quot;meats&quot; for sale at talaat mai , Chinatown&apos;s main market:

 

It&apos;s hard to see, but above are veggie &quot;shrimp&quot;, veggie &quot;salted fish&quot;, and believe it or not, vegetarian pork intestines!

Continuing along Thanon Yaowarat, Chinatown&apos;s main street, there was lots to see, including people making deliciously crispy peanut snacks:

 

crepe-like snacks made from a light batter poured through a seive:

 

and a huge pot of sangkhayaa , egg and coconut milk dipping sauce for paa thong ko , Chinese-style deep-fried dough:

 

I even came across an entire stall selling an array of northern Thai dishes, all made without meat:

 

including the famous northern curry kaeng hang lay , which was made with vegetarian pork belly!

I headed over to Wat Mangkon Kamalawat, Chinatown&apos;s most sacred temple, and a centre of activity for this festival. There were lots of people in white praying:

 

and lighting incense:

 

And there was even food available right at the temple. I ordered my favourite jay dish, yellow noodles fried with veggies:

 

Which, if you&apos;ll look closely, even included some fresh greens! It was, I felt, an appropriate end to a day spent going veggie.

A few bonus pics can be seen here .

click on the image I had been entertaining big plans to go back to Baan Chan, a promising restaurant serving the food of Chanthaburi province that I have previously mentioned in this very forum. Well, this morning I finally found the time to go there, only to arrive and find that they&apos;re closed on Sundays... In a fit of desparate hunger, we scrambled to what was virtually the nearest restaurant, an outdoor joint called Ram-Saep. Ram is the northern Thai dialect word for delicious, and saep the isaan or northeastern equivalent (central Thais say aroy ), so called because this restaurant serves both northern and northeastern Thai food.

This being northern Thai, I couldn&apos;t resist ordering laap khua :

 

Regular readers might have noticed that I&apos;m pretty obsessive about my laap khua. Ram-Saep&apos;s was good effort, with more or less the requisite flavours and textures, but nothing compared to the work of a laap khua master like the good people at Laap Khom Huay Puu (scroll down a bit).

Next was nam phrik nam puu :

 

This is a &apos;dip&apos; made from the small black crabs that are found in the rice fields of SE Asia. The crabs are crushed and boiled down into a thick black sludge that more or less tastes like you imagine boiled crab sludge would. Bitter is the main flavour here, and if you&apos;re not a fan of this taste you probably won&apos;t be writing the people at home abou the nam phrik naam puu. The dip was served with sides of cripy veggies and deep-fried pork for dipping.

There was jor phak kaat , a soup of a leafy green veggie popular in northern Thailand:

 

This was my personal favorite dish of the day. The broth was sour with healthy chunks of garlic and the vegetable was just undercooked and pleasantly crunchy.

Moving to issan food, we ordered kai yaang , grilled chicken:

 

and a mighty good one at that. The dish featured a reasonably scrawny chicken (this is a good thing) with fatty skin that was rubbed with crushed garlic, coriander roots and black pepper, rendering the dipping sauce unecessary. Delish.

And finally, a som tam , green papaya salad:

 

which was served in a cute mini mortar. This dish was mediocre, being a bit too sweet for my taste, and bordering on the souplike.

Ram-Saep is of the outdoor &apos;garden&apos; restaurant variety, which means rustic bamboo furniture, loud live music and stray dogs begging for your scraps. This sort of atmosphere is best appreciated at night, when it&apos;s cooler and you have some time to throw down a few cold beers with your meal.

Before you think I&apos;m going out on a limb here, take a look at the above and tell me it doesn&apos;t look like a perfectly ordinary Thai meal!

There&apos;s actually quite a bit in common between Portuguese and Thai cooking. It was actually the Portuguese who introduced chilies (and many other ingredients) to Thailand in the 16th century. And although they didn&apos;t take to searingly hot food as much as the Thais did, both countries share a deep love for seafood, chicken, grilled foods and sweets, as you&apos;ll see below. Now if only they&apos;d introduced vinho verde , good cheese and olive oil...

Regardless, I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about Portuguese food lately. I like the emphasis on seafood and bread, and had recently gotten hold of a nice bottle of Portuguese olive oil that I wanted to put to good use. I had also come across several interesting-looking Portuguese recipes as of late, so I decided to put together a Portuguese meal using ingredients I could easily get here in Bangkok. Two dishes that immediately came to mind were frango no churrasco , Portuguese-style grilled chicken, and piri piri , the ubiquitous chili-based dipping sauce.

The two recipes below were taken and adapted from the Portugal volume of Lonely Planet&apos;s excellent World Food series. I have several of their World Food books, and find them an excellent introduction to the food of several different countries.

Frango no Churrasco (Char-grilled Chicken)

 

2 large cloves garlic
1/2 tsp dried hot chili flakes
1/2 salt
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium free range chicken

1. Crush the garlic and mix with the chili, salt and oil. Set aside.

2. Remove and discard the chicken&apos;s neck and giblets. Wash the chicken in cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Place the chicken breast-side-up on a chopping board and, using a large sharp knife, cut down the middle riht through to the board and all the way up to the neck. Open the chicken out and press it flat. Rub the flavoured oil all over both sides of the chicken. Cover and refrigerate to marinate overnight (or at least for a few hours) to allow the flavours the develop.

3. Prepare a moderately hot charcoal fire with a grill rack about 15cm above the coals. When the coals are white, lay the chicken on the grill with the skin side up and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, then turn the chicken over and grill the other side for a further 12 minutes or so, or until the chicken is browned. Remove and &apos;rest&apos; the chicken in a warm spot, uncovered, for 10 minutes -- resting ensures the juices stay in the mean when it is cut.

Piri Piri (Red Hot Chili Pepper Sauce)

1/2 cup small dried chilies
3 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 tsp sea salt
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 cup olive oil

Put all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and process until combined. Put in a jar with a tight lid and leave in the fridge for a week.

The natural accompaniment to frango no churrasco and piri piri is batatas fritas , deep-fried potatoes. Despite this, I&apos;ve always been intimidated by boiling oil, and my previous attempts at deep-frying were pretty abysmal. However I recently became interested in giving this style of cooking a second chance after reading the chapter called &quot;Fries&quot; in Jeffrey Steingarten&apos;s excellent book, The Man Who Ate Everything . In this book he gives a recipe (attributed to French master chef, Joel Robuchon) for frites that is so simple, it almost seems like he&apos;s playing a joke on us. I&apos;ve adapted the recipe slightly, as I use a cold-pressed sunflower oil that&apos;s excellent for deep-frying (Steingarten suggests peanut oil--something unavailable in Thailand), and unless you&apos;re cooking for many people, I feel that measurements are superfluous.

Easy Frites 

 

potatoes
sunflower oil, at room temperature
salt

1. Wash and peel the potatoes (if desired), and cut them into the shape of your choice, keeping in mind that they will shrink when fried. Wash them briefly under cold water and dry with a cloth. Put them into a pan about 10 inches in diameter with sides at least 4 inches high. Just cover the potatoes with the oil.

2. Place the pan over the highest heat. The oil will begin to bubble, first softly and then furiously. Using long tongs, stir the potatoes to ensure that they cook evenly and that they don&apos;t stick to the bottom of the pan. By the time the oil reaches 350 degrees F., about 15 minutes, the potatoes will be a deep golden brown and should be ready to eat (Make sure that the oil temperature never exceeds 370 degrees F.).

3. Taste one or two. Drain and blot with paper towels. Salt the frites just before serving.

At this point, I already had some bubbling oil, and also happened to have a small bag of green beans, so I decided to try a recipe I&apos;d come across in the fun section of Portuguese recipes at the excellent Leite&apos;s Culinaria . The dish below is called peixinhos da horta , which according to Leite&apos;s, is Portuguese for &quot;little fish from the garden&quot;, as the dish resembles deep-fried fish that are popular in Portugal.

Peixinhos da Horta (Deep-Fried Green Beans)

 

1/2 pound green beans
oil for frying
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water
1 egg
1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

 1. Cook the beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain, cool in a bowl of ice water, and drain again. 

2. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a large saucepan over medium-high heat to 350°F (175°C). Combine the flour, water, eggs, baking powder, salt and pepper in a large bowl; whisk until a smooth batter forms.

3. Dip six beans at a time into the batter, shaking off any excess. Add the beans to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes per batch. Using tongs, transfer the beans to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with more salt and serve hot.
Although I&apos;ve heard that the Portuguese aren&apos;t too big on fresh greens, I also included a salad:
 
 

The dressing for this (as well as the marinade for the chicken) was made with an excellent Portuguese olive oil I was able to find here in Bangkok, Herdade do Esporão Virgem Extra D.O.P. This is significantly cheaper than the high-end Italian oils available here in Bangkok, but was still very nice, with a slightly spicy flavour, perfect for my:

Portuguese-Style Vinaigrette

3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 pinches salt
good quality Portuguese extra virgin olive oil
1 large clove of garlic

Put the apple cider vinegar in a deep heavy plastic or ceramic bowl. Add salt and using a whisk, mix until salt is dissolved. Add olive oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly. After having added about 3 Tbsps of olive oil, taste the dressing. Stop here if it tastes good to you, or continue adding more olive oil until you reach a taste that you like. Split the garlic clove and add to the dressing. Let the vinaigrette &quot;season&quot; at room temperature for at least an hour.

And finally, there was dessert:

 

The treats above were brought at Or Tor Kor Market in Bangkok, and are the kind of traditional Thai desserts that one could find almost anywhere in the country--a seemingly un-Portuguese end to our meal. Actually though, the practice of making desserts out of egg yolks and sugar was originally introduced to the Thais by--you guessed it--the Portuguese. In the foreground are foy thong , &quot;golden threads&quot; ( fios de ovos in Portuguese) and behind these, thong yip , &quot;pinched gold&quot;, named for their colour and the way they&apos;re formed. For more on the Portuguese influence on Thai food, check out this piece I wrote for ThaiDay several months ago.

To help her out, I did a blog entry describing some of the most emblematic tools in the Thai kitchen. Her article has just come out, take a look . (Incidentally, in the same issue there&apos;s also a cool &quot; Style Map &quot; of Hanoi (scroll to bottom of the page) courtesy of the Monsieur noodlepie himself, Graham Holliday, as well as an article about fancy French potatoes by Clotilde of Chocolate and Zucchini . Kinda makes you wonder what happened to all the real journalists, doesn&apos;t it?)

Although many visitors to Thailand rave about the street food, frankly, much of it is pretty mediocre. Much better, in my opinion, are the small mom and pop restaurants that specialize in one kind of dish, or perhaps a style of regional Thai cooking. They tend to be dark, difficult to find, and the owners can often be surly, but the food, man, the food... The above restaurant is a perfect example of this genre of restaurant. It&apos;s called Sukhothai Mor Din, literally &quot;Sukhothai Clay Pots&quot;, so-called because their curries are served in the red pottery made just outside this northern city:

 

These aren&apos;t just run-of-the-mill curries either. These curries are meant to be ladled over khanom jeen , fermented rice noodles. They had about eight different curries to choose from, and we ordered naam yaa paa , a watery fish-based curry, and naam ngiaow , a thicker northern-style curry made from pork ribs, tomatoes and chunks of blood:

 

An order of any type of curry and khanom jeen is always accompanied by lots of fresh and par-boiled veggies and herbs:

 

The green leaves in the foreground are called bai menglak (hairy basil?) and along with par-boiled morning glory, thinly sliced green beans and bean sprouts, are taken with the naam yaa paa . The naam ngiaow is normally eaten with pickled mustard cabbage, crispy fried garlic, shredded cabbage and squeeze of lime.

Other than curries, the clay pots also hold sweets:

 

I believe the above is sago with corn. I ordered sweetened sticky rice with lamyai , an indigenous fruit. Khuat ordered bua loy maphrao on , small, sweet balls with young coconut:

 

Those not familiar with Thai sweets will be surprised to learn that the Thais actually prefer these kind of coconut milk-based sweets to also taste salty. I was aware of this, but was surprised at just how salty this shop&apos;s sweets were.

On my next visit I&apos;m going to try the delicious-looking green curry with fish balls. Stay tuned...

 To see the full image or to start a slideshow,
click on the image I get quite a few emails from people planning to visit Bangkok asking me to recommend &quot;the best places to eat&quot; or where &quot;the best Thai food&quot; is. I&apos;m honored that people would trust my opinion regarding an issue so profound, and thought the best way to approach this would be in a blog entry.

First of all, it&apos;s important to understand that with Thai food it&apos;s generally pretty hard to find a great all-around restaurant (although certainly some do exist); you&apos;re much more likely to find a place serving a few great dishes. As I&apos;ve mentioned previously, the most rewarding Thai restaurants specialize in one style of cooking, or perhaps food from one particular region of Thailand. Keeping this in mind, it would be an immense undertaking to recommend individual restaurants. Instead, I&apos;m going to mention the types of dining I think one should take part in when in Bangkok, and a few areas where small restaurants, street stalls and/or vendors are of a higher caliber than elsewhere.

For Thai newbies, I would strongly recommend beginning with a visit to a mall food court . They are clean and cheap, the menus are written in English, you have a wide range of choices, and actually, the food can be pretty good. My favorite food court is probably the one on the sixth floor of Mah Boon Khrong (also known as MBK). You&apos;ll find a huge variety of Thai food, everything from noodles to isaan --they even have a stall selling Thai-Muslim food such as khao mok kai . One of my favourite stalls is the one selling vegetarian food. There&apos;s generally a foodcourt at every mall, and in particular, upscale foodcourts seem to be springing up everywhere these days (such as the food court at Siam Paragon ) but they&apos;re generally quite overpriced (by Thai standards) and mostly Chinese (I&apos;m assuming you&apos;re looking for Thai food here). One peculiarity about Thai food courts: they don&apos;t accept cash. You&apos;ll need to find the cleverly hidden counter, where you&apos;ll have to stand in line to exchange your cash for coupons, or more recently, a swipe card. Then after you&apos;re done eating, you&apos;ll forget the coupons or swipe card with the remaining money in your pocket, and won&apos;t realize this until you get home. It&apos;s all part of the Thai food court experience.

At this point maybe you&apos;ve found a dish or two that you like, and are somewhat more familiar with the flavours of Thai food. Now you are ready to eat somewhere &quot;nice&quot;. Thus, I feel the natural next step is to eat at an upscale Thai restaurant . Be forewarned: upscale Thai restaurants are mostly mediocre, almost exclusively patronized by foreigners, and are going to be much more expensive than all other forms of Thai food put together. But they can also be very atmospheric and fun, and as most people try to include at least one on their trip anyway, I thought I would recommend the few I&apos;m familiar with. My favourite upscale Thai place is probably La Na Thai , one of the restaurants in the lovely Face complex. I&apos;ve eaten here twice, and both my Thai companions and I have enjoyed excellent Thai food each time. Other good upscale Thai include the tourist-ridden but good (as long as you avoid the buffet) Bussaracum and Flava . Lastly, if $ is not an issue, and you&apos;d also like a view with your tom yam then I&apos;d recommend the atmospheric riverside restaurants at the Oriental or the Peninsula .

Once you&apos;ve downed a few plates of food court nosh and have consumed the requisite nice Thai meal, I reckon you&apos;re ready for the next step in Thai dining: a good food neighborhood . In my opinion, this is the highest level of Thai dining (you&apos;ll instantly realize just how average upscale Thai tends to be!). In good food neighborhoods there might be a few standout restaurants, but generally it&apos;s possible just to pick and choose. The restaurants are going to be simple, but the flavours strong. In this regard, I would recommend the area on and around Thanon Tanao in Ko Rattanakosin, one of Bangkok&apos;s oldest districts, and a place teeming with legendary Thai eats. Other good food neighborhoods include Tha Phra Chan (in particular the area around Tha Chaang in the evenings) and Thanon Phra Athit, both more or less located in the same area of Bangkok. I&apos;ve also got a feeling that the Siam Square area might have some good eats, although on the surface it appears to be dominated by KFC and other chains. Investigation will ensue...

At this point, if you have followed my directions, you will have sampled a true cross section of Thai cuisine. It is only now that you are ready for the final step: Thai night market/street food . These affairs are only open at night, are not the cleanest restaurants you&apos;ll ever see, and they&apos;re in weird parts of town. But the food is often pretty good--almost equal to the experience. In this regard, I wholeheartedly endorse Chinatown at night . Simply walk down Thanon Yaowarat, try to avoid the annoying touts at touristy seafood restaurants, and pay attention as you reach the intersection Charoen Krung Soi 16. There you will find virtually every form of Chinese-influenced Thai street food. Another strong option is Sukhumvit Soi 38 , where Chinese-ish food again dominates, but is a bit wider in scope, despite being a much smaller market.

There. That&apos;s my 2 bits. Anybody got anything else to add?

 To see the full image or to start a slideshow,
click on the image I finally made it back. Baan Chan, the subject of today&apos;s post, is a restaurant specializing in the cuisine of Chanthaburi, a province in eastern Thailand. I had been to Chanthaburi several years ago, but other than some nice seafood, didn&apos;t really notice anything in particular about the food there. Since then I&apos;ve learned that Chanthaburi is famous for its fruits, is home to Thailand&apos;s most famous rice noodles (&apos; sen chan &apos;), and is also known for the famous black pepper that grows in the area as well as over the border in Cambodia. The border area is quite undeveloped, and the province is also known for dishes that include various types of game, such as wild deer, boar and birds. I like Thai boar (which is usually raised), but don&apos;t really want to consume wild animals, so on my visit to Baan Chan I stuck with duck. This included kaeng paa pet , &apos;jungle&apos; curry with duck:

 

If you order kaeng paa elsewhere in Thailand, you&apos;ll get a soup. But apparently in Chanthaburi the dish takes the form of something like a thick stir-fry, with crunchy bamboo, heaps of herbs (lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, basil, chili, peppercorn and a hint of nutmeg), bizarre bits of duck, and unusually, chunks of unripe banana (the unattractive grayish bits you see there). This is the restaurant&apos;s signature dish, and a good example of really freaking spicy Thai food done well, meaning that there was actually a variety of spicy flavours present (black pepper, ginger), rather than just the burn of chilies.

I also had khua kling pet :

 

Until this meal, the only khua kling I was familiar with was a southern Thai dish that is typically pork or beef braised in a a curry paste until &apos;dry&apos;. This dish was actually more or less a lot like a drier, spicers kaeng paa without the veggies. Excellent.

After these two, the green curry with homemade fish balls:

 

seemed like a mild palate cleanser! I thought this was a perfect example of &apos;real&apos; Thai green curry, which unlike the stuff you&apos;ll get in touristy restaurants, tends to be slightly yellow in color, has a hefty layer of oil floating on top, mushy eggplants, and is more watery than most people think a &apos;curry&apos; should be. I do remember seeing this curry in quite often in Chanthaburi, and recall that is often contained fish, which is somewhat unusual elsewhere in Thailand.

Although I don&apos;t think it&apos;s particularly associated with Chanthaburi, we can never say no to a good naam phrik kapi :

 

i.e. shrimp paste dip, served with fresh and battered-and-deep-fried veggies.

The last dish was kao lao :

 

It&apos;s basically a bowl of noodles--without the noodles. Kind of a pointless dish, if you ask me. The broth was sweet, as is usually the case, and was heavy with ground peanuts. Yuck.

I&apos;ll definitely be coming back, as I still haven&apos;t tried the sen chan phat puu , rice noodles fried with crab, or the kaeng nuea sai krawaan , beef curry with nutmeg.

This is the English name of a restaurant chain we ate lunch at recently. The name is a reference to the spiciness of Thai papaya salad (called tam som in some dialects). Obviously you can&apos;t go to a place like this and not order som tam (as it&apos;s called in the central dialect):

 

They do a decent one here, although I reckon those with a low tolerance for obscenely spicy food might have a tough time. The som tam was served with the traditional accompaniments of crispy cucumber, lettuce and long beans, but here they put them in on the the containers normally used for noodle condiments:

 

Cute.

We ordered laap wun sen :

 

which was basically pork laap with the addition of wun sen , glass noodles.

There was tom saep het faang :

 

 Tom saep is an isaan version of tom yam , and is usually made with pork ribs. This version probably used the same broth, but had no meat, and instead included het faang , straw mushrooms. Het faang go from good to slimy in a matter of hours, and unfortunately they decided to use the squishy old ones in this soup. Yuck. But that sure is a cute little stove.

My favourite dish was their kai yaang khamin , grilled chicken with turmeric:

 

This tasted excellent, but the texture was a bit unusual. I have a feeling they deep-fried it, then grilled it, or vice-versa. Oddly enough, &quot;grilled chicken&quot; is sometimes deep-fried in Thailand.

And there was, of course, sticky rice:

 

Cute container, no?

Nang Loeng Market is located just off of Thanon Nakhorn Sawan in Rattanakosin, old Bangkok. It first opened in 1899, and was in use until several years ago when it was destroyed by a fire. After a few years of construction, the market was recently rebuilt, and probably looks better than ever, but doesn&apos;t really seem to have recovered. On the day I visited only about a quarter of the stalls were in use and I wouldn&apos;t describe the atmosphere as particularly vibrant. Maybe I came on a bad day? Despite this, there&apos;s still some interesting stuff to see (and eat), in particular the old-school snacks and treats that this market is known for.

My day began with Thai-style coffee and paa thong ko , Chinese-style doughnuts:

 

Like other areas in Old Bangkok, Nang Loeng is where you&apos;ll find lots of old dudes drinking coffee and chilling:

 

I wandered around the market, passing by grilled sticky rice:

 

a lady making rice porridge:

 

rose apples:

 

a kind of freshly-steamed rice noodle called khanom paak mor :

 

and sugarcane:

 

before happening upon a small alley:

 

This whole alley is part of a famous noodle shop called Rung Reuang. I ordered a bowl of kiaow naam , wonton soup:

 

My noodles were made by a shirtless guy of Chinese origin who, according to the literature on the walls, still makes his own noodles. The kiaow were pretty good, mostly because they contained an astonishing amount of crab meat, an ingredient lesser noodle stalls skimp on.

Nang Loeng Market is particularly known for its sweets, such as these sticky rice snacks:

 

a bunch of khanom :

 

and my new favourite, khanom bueang :

 

While I ate my khanom beuang , I sat down to talk to the maker-man:

 

He told me how he is one of the few people making these snacks the old way,

 

employing a batter that comes from thua thong (&apos;golden beans&apos;, not sure what they&apos;re called in English) and rice, which he makes himself from scratch. The sweet ones (above) are filled with foy thong , sweetened egg yolk, and shredded coconut meat, while the savoury ones (shown in the first pic) are filled with a combination of shrimp, coconut meat, coriander roots and black pepper, all mashed up with a mortar and pestle.

This guy was born and raised in the Nang Loeng area, and told me stories about what it was like growing up there. He also told me where to find a movie theatre that was built in 1918! The theatre, called Chalerm Thani, was among Bangkok&apos;s first, and was used up until the 1990&apos;s, but today is used as a warehouse.

I thought this was a cool little corner of Bangkok with lots of potential. If more was done to revitalize the area, including perhaps inviting more vendors and touching up the 150 year-old row houses that surround the market, I think this could be a busy, vibrant market.

Been meaning to do this one for ages. Baan Chok Man is just about the closest restaurant to my house here in northern Bangkok. Coincidentally enough, it also happens to be one of my favourite restaurants in Bangkok. Before you get too excited, let me make it clear that the food at Baan Chok Man is not particularly exciting. Nor is it innovative or clever. It&apos;s simply good, solid, consistent Thai grub. Very consistent in fact. I&apos;ve been eating here for more than five years, and throughout that time the dishes are churned out exactly the same each time . I&apos;m starting to think they might have robot in the kitchen or something. This is the first place I take my friends and relatives when they visit Thailand, and they invariably love it.

Baan Chok Man is a garden restaurant:

 

and part of the pleasure here lies in sitting under the trees on a cool evening. Unfortunately we arrived a bit early and to avoid the laser-like rays of sun, were forced to sit indoors. Our first dish was tom khrong plaa krob (pictured above). This is more or less a thicker, spicier tom yam . Plaa krob means crispy fish, and refers to the crunchy dried fish that serves as the protein in this dish.

This was followed by sator phat kung , &quot;stinkbeans&quot; fried with shrimp:

 

Somewhat unusually here they mince the shrimp, which actually makes it easier to eat, although slightly less impressive looking.

This was followed by yam kaan kaew , a &quot;salad&quot; of crispy kai lan stalks:

 

The kai lan is mixed with minced shrimp, pork and squid that have been carefully blended with sliced shallots, chilies, fish sauce, lime juice and sugar--a combination that finds its way into many of the restaurant&apos;s dishes.

However my favourite dish, and something we have to order every freaking time we eat here, is plaa samlee op samunphrai , &quot;black banded trevally (a kind of fish--trust me here; I saw the English name at Tesco&apos;s) baked with herbs&quot;:

 

Contrary to the name, there&apos;s not a lot of baking (at least in the Western sense) going on here. Honestly, I always wondered how this dish was made, and I think I finally figured it out tonight. First, they take a medium-sized black banded trevally and deep-fry it. While this is bubbling away, they do a quick stir fry that includes minced pork, thinly sliced lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, garlic, green peppercorns and chilies (the &quot;herbs&quot; in the name of the dish). The fish and stir fry ingredients are combined on a sheet of foil, topped with crispy fried shallots and fresh kraphrao (a kind of Thai basil) , wrapped up and &quot;baked&quot; (most probably grilled) until steaming inside. Pure genius.

If you&apos;re ever in the Kaset area of northern Bangkok, do stop by.

Tami over at running with tweezers has initiated the first annual Souper Challenge Blog Event , a thinly-veiled threat for all of us foodbloggers to make soup. I don&apos;t really need an excuse to do this, as we eat soup nearly every day in Thailand, and I&apos;ve decided to take part by doing tom yam , the famous sour-spicy soup.

Now, I know what you&apos;re thinking: Austin, there are about 80 million recipes for tom yam on the Internet [actually there are 179,000 ], why do we need another one? It&apos;s true, but if you ask me, I don&apos;t think any of them come close to describing the best way to make this dish. Most tom yam recipes demand that you follow their instructions regarding the specific amounts of the flavouring ingredients to add. In reality, Thai people make tom yam by feel , adding ingredients and tasting continuously until they reach a flavour they like. You&apos;ll probably never see a measuring spoon in a Thai kitchen, but you will see lots of spoons for tasting the broth!

Today we&apos;re going to make make tom yam kung , tom yam with shrimp. I&apos;m choosing this kind because it&apos;s probably the most famous kind of tom yam , and I want to share the method of making a really nice broth. To make tom yam for two people, here&apos;s what you&apos;ll need:

 

Fresh shrimp (shells and all, not just shrimp meat) 10 or so depending on size
Water, approximately 4 cups
Galangal, a thumb-sized piece, peeled and chopped into big disks
Lemongrass, 3-4 stalks, outer layer removed and bruised
Shallots, 6, peeled
Coriander (cilantro) roots, 4, cleaned well
Fish sauce, to taste
Sugar (if desired), to taste
Straw mushrooms ( het faang ), 6
Cherry tomatoes, 4
Sawtooth coriander ( phak chee farang ), 6 leaves
Chilies, to taste
Limes, 2-3, depending on how sour you like your food
Kaffir lime leaves, three, halved

Wash the shrimp well and behead and peel them , reserving the shells and heads. Devein shrimp, butterfly (if desired) and set aside in the fridge. Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan and add shrimp shells and heads. When water reaches a boil again, stir and push on the shrimp shells to extract as much shrimpy goodness as possible.

 

Reduce heat slightly and let simmer for about five minutes. Strain and discard shrimp shells, reserving water.

In the same saucepan, bring shrimp broth to the boil again and add galangal, lemongrass, shallots and coriander roots. Allow to reach a slight boil and reduce heat to a simmer. Add a few drops of good-quality Thai fish sauce and taste. Add more fish sauce until the broth tastes just slightly salty, no more. If you like sugar (as many Thais d0) do the same thing with your sugar at this point, and taste.

While the broth is simmering, prepare your mise en place. Halve your cherry tomatoes, slice your limes, thinly slice your sawtooth coriander:

 

quarter your mushrooms:

 

and roughly chop your chilies, grinding and smashing them with the side of a knife when done:

 

After about 3-4 minutes, when your broth is fragrant, add prawns, mushrooms and tomatoes:

 

After another 2-3 minutes, when mushrooms are slightly soft and prawns done, squeeze in your lime juice and add your lime leaves:

 

Again, taste to see how sour it is (this soup should be sour followed by salty, but go for a taste that you like). Add more fish sauce (or sugar) if necessary, tasting all the while, and add your chilies and sawtooth coriander. Stir to combine and remove from heat. You&apos;re done.

Ratchawat Market is located in a secluded corner of the Dusit area of Bangkok, not far from the royal palace. I had read about it in The Nation, which described it as a good food destination, and I decided to pay a visit. The market itself is rather dark and unattractive:

 

although there were some friendly ladies selling sweets by the entrance:

 

Much more interesting things can be found along Thanon Nakhorn Chaisii, the main road leading to the market. Here you&apos;ll find heaps of vendors selling fresh produce, such as these bitter gourds:

 

and jackfruit:

 

as well as prepared foods, such as grilled meat:

 

curries to be eaten with khanom jeen , fermented rice noodles:

 

 muu khua kling , a southern Thai dish of pork &quot;dry&quot; fried with curry paste, served here with mad amounts of green peppercorns and kaffir lime leaf:

 

 chao kuay , &quot;grass jelly&quot;, a kind of dessert:

 

grilled and deep-fried fish:

 

including plaa som :

 

This is fish that has been stuffed with rice and basically left to rot. After a few days the fish obtains a wonderful sour taste. It is then typically deep-fried and served with sliced shallots, chilies and a squeeze of lime. Delish.

Ratchawat Market is near the imposing Excise Department, which means lots of hungry people at lunch time. The numerous small restaurants serving these people turned out to be the strength of this particular market area, and there were some interesting options. I started with a dish of phat thai at one of those hole-in-the-wall restaurants that look like they&apos;ve been serving the same thing for fifty years. Unfortunately I came at a bad time, and they were in the middle of frying up a massive take-away order of phat thai :

 

I waited patiently, and finally got my dish from somewhere in the belly of that beastly pile of noodles:

 

Not surprisingly, it was mediocre. Much better was kwaytiao lawt from this streetside stall:

 

 Kwaytiao lawt refers to the wide rice noodles used in this dish, which are topped with, among other things, Chinese pork sausage, tofu, barbecued pork and a sweetish soy sauce:

 

Really, really good. And continuing on the noodle theme I finished with yen ta fo , the one noodle dish that people in Bangkok can&apos;t seem to get enough of:

 

Those familiar with this ubiquitous dish might notice that something looks a bit different here. I think this was more of an old-school yen ta fo , and went light on the various fishballs and heavy on the more unusual pickled squid (!) and pickled jellyfish (!!). The broth was great, but there were a lot of strange bits and bobs left in my bowl...

So, I encourage a visit here, but don&apos;t feel bad if you give the actual market a miss. Come just before lunchtime, when the nosh is ready, but the hordes of hungry government employees have yet to arrive, and try something new.

 Thip pramong means something like &quot;heavenly fishing&quot; and is the name one of several seafood restaurants in the Khao Saam Muk area of Chonburi, about an hour east of Bangkok. Friends of ours, Nat and Pao:

 

had been there recently and liked it. So they invited us to go back on Friday.

We began with clams stir-fried with bai horaphaa , Thai basil:

 

Mighty good, and some mighty meaty clams. This was followed by plaa meuk neung manao , squid &quot;steamed&quot; with lime:

 

which, as you can see is not really &quot;steamed&quot; but simmered in a sour, sweet and spicy broth.

When eating Thai seafood, you must order khao phat puu , fried rice with crab:

 

Despite being such a boring dish, I really love this one and have to have it every time. They did a good one here, with huge chunks of crab and egg. A squeeze of lime and some phrik naam plaa (sliced chilies in fish sauce), and I&apos;m happy.

There were also grilled scallops:

 

which were VERY well done, but it didn&apos;t really matter, as the extremely spicy/sour dipping sauce they came with masked any scallop flavour. Made with a bit more care was deep-fried grouper with a mango-based sour dressing:

 

It&apos;s a bit hard to tell by the pic, but the entire fish has been butterfly-cut, splayed open, battered and deep-fried. The mango dressing is served on the side.

However the Dish of the Day, at least for me and Nat, was puu phat phong karii , crab fried in curry powder:

 

Two fat, meaty crabs fried with onions, scallions and a rich sauce made from curry powder. Here&apos;s Nat enjoying:

 

During dinner Pao asked me if this kind of food was expensive in the US. I told her it was, and that very few people could afford to eat like this, but couldn&apos;t really give her an accurate estimate. Any ideas? Our meal came to just short of 2,000 baht (about $50), which is rather expensive by Thai standards. Regardless, everything was good, and the seafood was truly fresh, as evidenced by the nearby pier where it was unloaded from boats and taken directly to the restaurants:

 

While we were eating a boat arrived and some truly frightening looking horseshoe crabs and several buckets of fish were brought it.

As an added bonus, along the way back from Khao Saam Muk there are several roadside shops selling granite mortar and pestle sets. After some careful inspection, Nat and Pao picked one up for their new house:

Every evening at about 5, a small market unfolds at Tha Chaang, the boat pier just across from Wat Phra Kaew. I happened to be in the area, and just happened to be hungry, and so began with a dish called, if I remember correctly, khanom phak kaat :

 

This translates as &quot;cabbage snack&quot;, and since this dish has no cabbage, leads me to believe I might have misunderstood the name! It&apos;s basically fried cubes of dough (probably from rice or tapioca flour):

 

and is very similar, athough not as good a dish I had in Penang called char kway kak . That dish had a wonderfully smoky wok hei ; this was more like well, fried bits of bland dough.

It&apos;s not a huge market, but you&apos;ll find all kind of prepared food such as noodles:

 

fruit:

 

 khanom jeen :

 

as well as raw ingredients, such as overpriced fruit:

 

Seeing all this made me hungry so I had a plate of khao khluk kapi :

 

This is rice that has been cooked with kapi , shrimp paste, which is then supplemented with several different toppings:

 

including sliced shallots, sliced green beans, shredded green mango, sliced omelet, Chinese sausage, &quot;sweet&quot; pork and fresh chilies. Squeeze a lime over it and you have one of Thailand&apos;s best dishes.

 The article below was written by friend and journalist Hal Lipper, and ran in last Sunday&apos;s The Nation . I was along with Hal, David and Phi Tong and took the pics that accompanied the article. 
 

This is how David Thompson does it. The world&apos;s only Mich elin-star chef specialising in Thai cuisine spends days with grey-haired grannies in the kitchen, watching them pound pastes and stir curries. 
He takes copious notes while they cook and when sampling their food, and then later recreates and enhances their traditional dishes in Nahm, his restaurant in the Halkin Hotel in London.


Thompson, who currently is in Thailand to supervise photography for his book on Thai street food, took The Nation on a road trip to Sing Buri to search for some of the region’s best fare.


In 36 hours, we ate nearly two dozen Central Plains dishes – ranging from curries to grilled snakehead fish to stir-fried frog, wild boar and cobra – and made a 4am foray to Sing Buri’s sprawling wholesale market.


 
 Singburi&apos;s morning market. 


“The food in the central plains is more rustic, more fully flavoured and sweeter than Bangkok,” noted Thompson, whose first cookbook “Thai Food” culled forgotten recipes from funerary texts that had been written to commemorate exemplary chefs.


We sampled the cobra, wild boar and frog at the Look Thung restaurant – which shares its name with the country-music style. It’s an open-air affair on a dusty road just outside the provincial capital of Ang Thong. It had been recommended by a friend of chef Tanongsak “Dtong” Yordwai, Thompson’s partner of two decades. The reptiles and amphibians are chopped and dried before being stir-fried with a chilli paste, and are primarily drinking foods – good with beer or rice whisky, but not worth the three-hour drive from Bangkok.
 
 A stir fry of cobra, Look Thung Restaurant, Ang Thong.
 
Sing Buri is known for its snakehead fish, which Thompson feels is the finest in Thailand. Among the best restaurants to sample this huge, primal-looking fish is Mae Laa Paa Pao (Mae La Grilled Snakefish) just outside Sing Buri on Route 1.

The snakeheads here are grilled over coconut husks until their skin is black and crispy and can be peeled off to reveal the toothsome, naturally oily flesh. The smoky aroma and delicate flavour are astounding.


 
 Poo lon, a dish of crab and pork simmered in coconut cream and herbs, Sum Phai Restaurant, Singburi. 


We sampled a half dozen other dishes, but none compared with the grilled snakehead.


The highlight of the trip was Sum Phai (Bamboo Grove) Restaurant, a rustic, al fresco eatery set at the end of an irrigation canal about 10 kilometres past Ampur Muang in Sing Buri’s Hua Paa district. (The restaurant, closed by the recent floods, will reopen after January 1.)


Sum Phai was a remarkable find. Its chefs – three related by blood, the fourth related by marriage – together have nearly two centuries’ culinary experience. The eldest chef’s mother and grandmother were cooks, and their recipes are from the days of King Rama V, who used to visit Sing Buri, celebrated for its superb produce, fish and local cuisine.


 
 Deep frying semi-dried snakehead fish, Sum Phai restaurant, Singburi. 

All dishes at Sum Phai are cooked using local ingredients, including herbs and chillies plucked from a garden that grows beside the kitchen. The women here pride themselves on their frog salad and frog jungle curry. But amphibians were in short order that day, so they instead made plaa raa sap, fermented fish minced with fresh herbs.


Also on the menu: kaeng bon, a thick curry made from grilled fish, coconut milk and tamarind, kaeng khee lek, a coconut cream-based curry made with fish, a lemongrass salad with cashews, deep-fried snakehead fish, poo lon, a dish of crab and pork simmered in coconut cream, a stir-fry of morning glory and shrimp, and luk tan, the fruit of the palm-sugar tree, for dessert.


Thompson positioned himself on a stool in the corner of the kitchen and took copious notes. Dtong helped the chefs prepare collect the ingredients.

The people of the central plains generally use fresh, indigenous ingredients rather than frozen foods from other provinces. “Food here is prepared and cooked in context with local society. It’s cooked with great care,” Thompson noted.


Two hours later, just before plating, Thompson and Dtong were shooed to the dining area, which is shaded with palm fronds and flowering vines.

The dishes rolled from the kitchen. The kaeng bon was rich with taro and the bitter-sour leaves in the kaeng kee lek were a nice counterpoint to the sweet coconut cream, tamarind and savoury grilled beef.


Thompson was ecstatic. “You rarely get raw fish dips or taro shoot dishes in Bangkok,” he noted.


The lemongrass salad was made with fresh shrimp rather than dried prawns. Thompson liked it so much that he said he would cook a variation with squid and roasted coconut for William Paterson, Australia’s ambassador to Thailand, at a dinner for 30 the next week.

“In the countryside, you find better, fresher ingredients, and more authentic flavour,” Thompson noted. “The techniques may not be as refined as in Bangkok, but the results are often superior.”

What a great find. This month-old restaurant, located just a few kilos from my house, specializes in fish from the Mekong River and other specialties of Nong Khai province in northeast Thailand. There are actually a few restaurants around here that do this sort of food, but I was really blown away by Paa Uap. For starters, the proprietors are natives of Nong Khai, and import their fish directly from the province, packed in ice and on the overnight bus:

 

The big yellow fish on the top is plaa khae , so called, I was told, because it resembles a crocodile ( khae is apparently the Nong Khai dialect word for charakhe , crocodile). The ones below are called plaa phoh , and are apparently quite hard to catch and are thus quite expensive. These, and any other fish they might have, can be grilled, made into tom yam , deep-fried, or just about anything you&apos;d like. If you&apos;re not sure what to order, and can read Thai, the restaurant&apos;s menu even contains detailed information about the various fish they have:

 

including when they&apos;re available, how they taste and where they&apos;re found. Other than Mekong River fish they also serve naem nueang , the Vietnamese do-it-yourself dish often associated with Nong Khai, as well as several dishes featuring &quot;jungle&quot; animals such as deer.

However, this being isaan food, we started with the ubiquitous som tam plaa raa , Lao-style papaya salad (pictured at the beginning of this post). I think this has got to be one of the best I&apos;ve had in Bangkok. The dish was exceedingly sour and garlicky, and featured a strong but not overwhelming essence of plaa raa as well as hearty chunks of slightly bruised papaya. In short, very Lao. We ended up eating two dishes.

This was followed by laap plaa jok :

 

 Plaa jok being another kind of Mekong River fish. Unfortunately this laap was so strong on the lime that there was really no chance to see what the fish tasted like. It was still very yummy though.

And finally there was hor mok plaa ling :

 

In Thai Food David Thompson likens hor mok to a steamed curry, which is accurate when describing Thai food, but northeast Thai/Lao-style hor mok is a bit different . Less (or no) coconut cream is used here, and the flavours here are really subtle, in this case a combination of dill, a tiny bit of chilies, tender greens and bai yaanang , a bitter leaf often used in hor mok . The fish was very fresh, and took the form of meaty strips, as well as part of the head. The taste and smell was so authentic that I nearly had to remind myself that I wasn&apos;t sitting by the side of the Mekong in Nong Khai (or Vientiane, Laos, for that matter!).

All this was taken with freshly steamed sticky rice. Have you ever eaten freshly steamed sticky rice? If you have, then you&apos;ll know why I put it in italics!

If you&apos;re thinking of visiting, I&apos;d recommend coming in the evening, as when we were there for lunch we were the only diners and the staff weren&apos;t quite ready.

Welcome to southern Thai food heaven. As the image above was meant to suggest, this restaurant in northern Bangkok is serious about southern curries. Walk in any day before lunch and you can choose from at least 30 different curries, fried dishes and soups. And most of them are pretty good. I think it&apos;s a &quot;famous&quot; restaurant, as I&apos;ve seen it mentioned in a magazine. But the most important thing is that it&apos;s close to my house, so I&apos;ve eaten here many, many times. We&apos;ve always got to order kaeng lueang :

 

This is the southern version of kaeng som , and is bright yellow with turmeric and shockingly spicy. This one was loaded with or , the pithy interior of the taro stalk, as well as huge chunks of fish. I harbour suspicions that they might season this dish to please Bangkok eaters, as it&apos;s usually pretty sweet. Scandalous.

One of my favourite things about this place is that, in true southern style, you get a vast tray of fresh herbs and veggies regardless of what you order:

 

And there&apos;s also herbs in the curries, such as the kaeng hoy sai bai chaphluu , a coconut milk curry with shellfish and wild tea leaf:

 

This being southern food the seafood didn&apos;t stop there. There was an excellent plaa thod khamin , fish deep-fried in turmeric:

 

(a dish for which I have previously described the recipe here ), and a yummy hor mok plaa :

 

This is a lunchtime joint; if you are unfortunate enough to arrive in the evening the selection of curries is none too impressive.

It&apos;s been just on a year since I started RealThai. I&apos;m spending more time on it than ever, it finally more or less looks the way I want it to, my photo editing skills are improving (just take a look at some of the early images!), and as a result, more and more people are reading it. Occasionally I&apos;ll even get an email from a reader who happens to be passing through Bangkok, asking to meet up. Such was the case with Maia, a food addict living in Paris. She had asked if I was willing to meet, and deliberately playing on my weaknesses, had promised a grab bag of food-related goodies from Paris. How could I say no?

We at Hua Lamphong and began our day with a bowl of kuaytiaow khae consumed in the medieval-like bowels of Chinatown&apos;s talaat mai:

 

After a bit more wandering, Maia bought three bags of tofu skin, as one does in Chinatown, and we proceeded to Thanon Tanao. Stopping in at a cafe we met this monk, who wished us lives of 130 years, and who was exceedingly proud of the Japanese clock he purchased for 300 baht:

 

Maia, a self-confessed &quot;weirdo magnet&quot;, was loving it. The monk, who originally came from Lopburi, had been a monk at nearby Wat Bowonniwet for an astounding 49 years!

At lunchtime I had an appointment with with another fellow blogger and RealThai fan, Göran Lager. Göran, a food historian, is the author of several books in his native Sweden, and also does stories for a food program on Swedish radio called Meny (&quot;Menu&quot;). Upon discovering my blog a few weeks ago he was surprised to find that I used to live in his hometown, Sollentuna, and decided to interview me about Thai food:

 

In flipping through RealThai, Göran and his wife (who is Thai) noticed my obsession with som tam, and we knocked back a couple while he asked me, in Swedish, about the dish. Now, I&apos;ll admit that I used to speak Swedish somewhat well, but that was back in 1998. In the decade since then I&apos;ve spoken a total of about 14 words of Swedish, and the &quot;interview&quot; that resulted that day was a garbled mash of substandard svenska, equally bizarre English and, oddly enough, somewhat accurate Thai. Thankfully, Göran appears to be a professional and can edit out the bad bits, although I imagine he&apos;s unable to do anything about my American accent. In an effort to capture the entire som tam &quot;experience&quot; he even recorded the sounds of the som tam being made:

 

My guess is that this sound was somewhat more interesting than my interview.

So, if you&apos;re a fan of RealThai and happen to conduct a food-related program on your country&apos;s national radio, or are willing to bring gifts of exotic treats, by all means, do drop us a line.

This is the creative name of a very longstanding restaurant in the Silom area. Apparently they&apos;ve been making briyani and other Muslim dishes in this same location for 60 or 70 years, and was among the first restaurant of its kind in Bangkok. The thing I like about it (other than the food, which I&apos;ll get to in a moment) is that it appears that very little has changed about the restaurant throughout this time:

 

In particular, the wooden booths are a feature that one sees only amongst the elite few of Bangkok&apos;s crustiest restaurants. However most people come here to eat, not critique the interior design, and most of them come to eat the khao mok , biryani. They do several kinds here, which is a great chance to avoid the ubiquitous chicken. I choose khao mok phae , goat biryani:

 

As the orange colour illustrates, it&apos;s really quite unlike any other khao mok you&apos;ll get in Bangkok. I find it similar to biryanis I have eaten in Yangon, Myanmar, and imagine it&apos;s similar to what you would get in India. The goat was in the from of a huge joint that offered little meat, but was tender and tasty. Personally, I could go without the meat and simply eat the delicious rice with the complimentary sides of sour eggplant curry, and ajaat , a sweet/sour cucumber, syrup and chili sauce.

Feeling only 84% full, I ordered two samosas:

 

Greasy, but tasty, and will leave the taste of cumin in your mouth for a good half hour. The glass case where these came from also holds various curries and Indian-style sweets:

 

I&apos;ve eaten other dishes here, including the shrimp biryani and the oxtail soup, and can vouch for their goodness. Here&apos;s what the Nation has to say about the restaurant. I say it&apos;s definitely worth a visit, both for the fun old-world atmosphere and the good eats.

I&apos;m slightly somewhat late here, but I&apos;d like to help spread the word about Menu for Hope III . This is a program that raises money for the UN World Food Program . Last year&apos;s run was apparently the world&apos;s largest online food auction, and raised just over $17,000!

The idea is simple: we, the foodbloggers, offer cool prizes, and you, the readers bid on them. Hungry people receive the money. My contribution is a six-hour food tour of Bangkok (idea courtesy of Pim). This is a custom tour I&apos;ve developed myself that takes in two of Bangkok&apos;s most vibrant markets, some well-respected restaurants and street stalls, as well as some other interesting, but non food-related sights. I&apos;ll fork out for all the transportation and meals, and provide lively conversation and insightful insight. The code for this prize is AP44.

As tempting as this sounds, there are other prizes as well, and to see a full list of what is being offered by Asia-Pacific bloggers have a look here . For the entire list, visit Pim . Once you&apos;ve decided what you&apos;re interested in, break out the plastic, remember the code of the prize you want and buy as many $10 raffle tickets as you can afford at Firstgiving , the entity handling all the money.

The campaign is scheduled to run from now until Friday 22nd, 6PM PST. So buy your raffle tickets now!

In the course of doing an entry about phat thai for Lonely Planet&apos;s new travel blog , I found myself at Thip Samai, probably the most famous phat thai restaurant in Thailand (as well probably the only phat thai restaurant with a website ). As illustrated by the interior:

 

it&apos;s also among the oldest phat thai shops in Thailand, and they&apos;ve been frying up noodles since 1966.

In keeping with tradition, Thip Samai still makes its phat thai using old-skool charcoal-burning stoves. Controlled by electric fans, the cooks can increase the flames when necessary to provide an element of wok hei , or &apos;breath of the wok&apos;, a smoky essence that ideally should be present in all good wok-fried food:

 

 

 

Despite this, I was a bit disappointed to see that they don&apos;t do the phat thai to order here. Rather, they fry up a huge wok of the stuff and divide it among several plates. They only do phat thai here, although they do about five different kinds. I began with phat thai man kung kung sot :

 

This is phat thai where the noodles have been fried with man kung , shrimp fat, giving them the pinkish-orange hue. The dish had the savoury oiliness of the shrimp fat, but this being true Bangkok food, was slightly somewhat sweet.

I followed this with a dish of phat thai thammadaa , &apos;normal&apos; phat thai employing the famous rice noodles from Chanthaburi:

 

Again, slightly sweet, with somewhat undercooked noodles.

All phat thai is served with a side dish of banana flower, Chinese chives, bean sprouts, sliced lime, and my favourite, bai bua bok, a green, slightly bitter herb also known as Asian pennywort:

 

I&apos;m going to go out on a limb here and say that, in my opinion, the phat thai at Thip Samai is good, but really no better than good phat thai I&apos;ve eaten elsewhere. In my experience, phat thai is a dish that is either good or bad, but never great. On the other hand, I think that if they were to fry the phat thai to order (impossible, given the number of customers), each dish would be better-proportioned and have more of that wonderful wok hei , and could very well be the first great phat thai I&apos;ve had.

Thip Samai is open from 17:30 to 1:30.

Had lunch at Muslim Restaurant with David Thompson today, the author of the austerely-titled but acclaimed, Thai Food . As I know quite a few readers own and love this book, I thought you might be interested to know that Mr Thompson is currently working hard on its successor, a tome on Thailand&apos;s street food that figures to be every bit as authoriative (and thick) as Thai Food . At this point Thompson has assembled 250 recipes and is &quot;2/3 of the way done&quot;, but reckons the book probably won&apos;t be on the market until Christmas 2007. Right now he&apos;s struggling to finish the chapter on khanom jeen (9 pages, 1o-15 recipes!), and would appreciate help from anybody who can provide authoriative information as to the origin of this semi-fermented rice noodle!

It&apos;s hard to believe that something with such humble origins would eventually become the acclaimed yet feared multi million dollar-grossing media empire that it is today. As CEO of RealThai ™ © ® on this special day, I&apos;d just like to say that, despite the lavish lifestyle and cheroot-smoking groupies that often accompany such fame, and regardless of the nasty rumours currently being spread on CNN, RealThai remains absolutely, and unequivocally independent.

Thanks to the vigilance of devoted readers such as Austin from Bangkok (apparently I&apos;m not the only one), I&apos;m kept abreast of developments in the fast-moving world of the city&apos;s food scene. However today&apos;s entry is not even remotely fast moving. Natthaphorn, an unassuming street side ice cream shop in Olde Bangkok has been scooping for at least 60 years. I&apos;d heard of it before, but hadn&apos;t yet visited, so today after an excellent lunch at the nearby Chotechitr , and with Austin&apos;s praise in mind, I finally made it to Natthaphorn&apos;s with friends Ron, Carla and Giovanna:

 

As the sign in the first pic indicates, they have three flavours: coconut, chocolate and coffee:

 

The maphrao on , or young coconut ice cream is the shop&apos;s most famous:

 

It contains no milk; only coconut cream and tender coconut meat, and like many Thai sweets that contain these ingredients, a very subtle salty flavour. The texture is slightly more &quot;icy&quot; than Western-style ice cream, but is still smooth, and the ice cream seems to take its sweetness from the coconut, rather than added sugar.

I think Ron liked it:

 

The chocolate:

 

and coffee varieties are made using milk, and are more or less similar to Western-style ice cream, but were also delicious.

The friendly third-generation owner says that she does other flavours on occasion, including &quot;milk tea&quot; and passion fruit, among others. Because Thai-style ice cream is often served with sticky rice, we suggested that she do a mango ice cream in an effort to capture the flavours of the famous Thai dessert, mango and sticky rice. She said she&apos;d do it if we promised to come back. We&apos;ll be back.

I&apos;ve mentioned Chinatown here many a time, but still feel its worth touching on again. It used to be a nightmare to get to this part of town, but with the MRT terminating at Hua Lamphong now, it&apos;s a simple ten minute walk from the station. As I&apos;ve said before, the food down here is great, and the atmosphere is really fun as well, with both locals and tourists.

The food more or less starts at the corner of Thanon Phadung Dao and Thanon Yaowarat. This corner is dominated street stalls that sell overpriced seafood to Asian tourists:

 

They really are quite fun though, and have a great selection:

 

The most popular of these is probably T&amp;K, which has a virtual army of young employees from upcountry:

 

On a slightly smaller scale, farther down Thanong Phadung Dao, I came across one tiny stall that sold different steamed shellfish:

 

She sold cockles and mussels, which are served with the Thai seafood dipping sauce:

 

Getting back to Thanon Yaowarat, I crossed the road and stopped by the mangkorn khaao , &apos;white dragon&apos; noodle shop:

 

This stall does the best bamii , Chinese-style wheat noodles, and wontons I&apos;ve had in Bangkok. The wontons in particular:

 

are immense, and are filled with a mixture of a shrimp and ground pork ground up with black pepper, coriander roots and garlic. And the barbecued pork here is a world away from the red-painted meat you&apos;ll find all over Bangkok.

If this isn&apos;t enough (it wasn&apos;t), across the way is a popular stall that sells satay, skewers of grilled pork:

 

Continuing along Thanon Yaowarat, the next side street is Thanon Plaeng Naam, where this guy does stir-fries over amazingly hot charcoal stoves:

 

And at the end of the street are two shops that sell a huge variety of pre-cooked Chinese-style dishes:

 

Getting back to Thanon Yaowarat:

 

I stopped for a dish of mii phat hong kong , &apos;Hong Kong-style fried noodles&apos;:

 

A simple, but delicious dish of wheat noodles, shrimp, crab meat, dried mushrooms and sliced cabbage, that I&apos;ve only really ever seen in Chinatown.

Along Thanon Yaowarat another common sight is guys roasting chestnuts in large woks filled with sand:

 

The end of the line, and probably the busiest spot is where Thanon Yaowarat intersects with the market known as talaat mai , at Charoen Krung 16. There&apos;s tons of food and people here, but much of the fuss is centered around one stall that sells kuay jap (a kind thick noodle soup):

 

This place is mad popular and has a constant line of people.

All over Chinatown you&apos;ll find kids selling garlands Burmese-style, from trays balanced on their heads:

 

Wandering to the end of the street, I discovered that someone was showing a movie:

No turkey, no fruitcake, no eggnog; this year&apos;s Christmas dinner was taken with friends at Paa Uap . Isaan food in plastic chairs by the side of the road--how less Christmas can you get?

Vongdeun ordered tam taeng , a dish identical som tam , but employing strips of crispy cucumber rather than the normal green papaya:

 

We ordered two.

Mr. B had a need for laap muu :

 

and I ordered yam naem , a salad of fermented pork with julienned ginger, peanuts and chilies:

 

But this is a freshwater fish restaurant, and the best dishes are of the piscine variety. We had tiny plaa nuea on deep-fried with copious garlic:

 

Which we ate bones and all. This was followed by plaa nin phao :

 

A Mekong River fish stuffed with lemongrass, coated with salt and grilled over coals. Delish.

And this being Christmas there was, of course, sticky rice:

Inspired by noodlepie&apos;s mention of a Flickr noodlemap , today I hit the streets in search of a noodlelunch. My search led me to a neighbourhood restaurant selling kwaytiao reua , &quot;boat noodles&quot;, possibly the second most popular form of noodle in Thailand. This is a dish associated with central Thailand, and is so called because it used to be sold from small boats along the canals and rivers. Today all of Bangkok&apos;s canals have been turned into streets, but the boats still survive:

 

That these noodles are normally served from a landlocked boat is not their only interesting attribute. Boat noodles are among the most intensely flavoured noodle dishes in Thailand, featuring a dark, somewhat sweet broth suggestive of spices such as cinnamon and clove, a hearty dose of pork blood, and crushed pork rinds and dried chilies in every bowl! The dish is normally made with pork or sometimes beef, and when you order, you choose the form of meat you desire, which can include meatballs, ground meat, stewed falling-apart meat or liver. Thankfully, dish also includes something green in the form of par-boiled morning glory (I asked for extra):

 

As with other Thai noodle dishes, you can also choose the type of noodles you want, although I think this dish is best with the thin rice noodles known in Thai as sen lek :

 

The bowls are tiny, and very cheap--only 10 baht each--and I can easily put down three or four. Rather than doing that though, I opted to try the only other dish this restaurant makes, khao khluk kapi :

 

This is rice cooked with shrimp paste and served with all the toppings you see there, including (on top of the rice) sour mango, a shredded omelet and muu waan , &quot;sweet pork&quot;, as well as Chinese sausage, lime, thinly sliced green beans, thinly sliced shallots and thinly sliced chilies.

Expect to see more on boat noodles, as I&apos;m planning on making a trip the canal behind the Victory Monument where there are several shops that specialize in this dish.

Well, they&apos;re still doing them, and the latest one will be about Thailand. The project, called Thailand: 9 Days in the Kingdom , involves 50 of the most famous photographers in the world, people like Steve McCurry, Abbas, Mike Yamashita, Raghu Rai, Bruno Barbey, James Nachtwey et al . These guys (and gals) will be documenting life in Thailand for a period of nine days starting on January 16th. I&apos;ll be working as an assistant to Eric Valli , the French photographer who&apos;s probably most well known for the photos he took of honey hunters in Nepal. He and I will be going down to Ko Phi Phi, where back in 1990 Eric did an article for National Geographic documenting the workers who gather the valuable swift nests in the caves near this island. So basically, I&apos;ll be spending a week on a tropical beach helping out a world famous photographer. Could it get any better? Oh yeah, and there will be southern Thai food.

Friend and South China Morning Post journalist Hal Lipper had been invited to the Millennium Hilton&apos;s Chinese restaurant, Yuan, to sample their new menu, and was kind enough to take me along. That&apos;s him above trying to convince the hotel&apos;s PR staff to give us the most expensive bottle on the wine list.

Yuan&apos;s chef, Chow Chun Chuen, is a native of Hong Kong and all the dishes we had were vaguely Cantonese in origin. One of the most unusual dishes of the meal was Braised fish maw steak with abalone sauce:

 

For those of you who don&apos;t know, fish maw=fish guts, but surprisingly this was one of the better dishes of the meal, and Hal&apos;s personal favourite.

I liked the Stir-fried beef with pineapple and rose apple:

 

The beef had been marinated beforehand and was very tender, and the rose apple, though unusual, added an interesting sweet flavour.

Another very unusual dish was Stir fried scallop and mango with fresh milk:

 

Upon reading the name of this dish I was certain I wouldn&apos;t like it, but the fresh milk took the form of very soft scrambled eggs or cheese and was actually quite nice.

There was also Baked river prawns in cheese and butter bulk (?) with E-Fu noodle:

 

which consisted of seemingly homemade but soggy noodles with a rich but nondescript sauce.

And finally, Deep-fried shin of beef with Thai chicken sauce:

 

The battered and deep-fried shin of beef was nice, in a tamale sort of way, but the &quot;Thai chicken sauce&quot;, ostensibly the cheap bottled stuff that people normally serve with fried chicken, made the dish soggy and sweet.

We were also invited to try some of the restaurant&apos;s dim sum dishes, which mostly included the old standbys like steamed buns filled with barbecued pork:

 

the steamed morsels known in Thai as ha kao :

 

steamed noodle with shrimp:

 

and khanom jeep :

 

Bangkok-based dim sum fans should be aware that Yuan offers a dim sum lunch buffet every day for 500 baht.

click on the image Today was something of an informal Bangkok Bloggers Summit. I trekked all the way to the Lang Suan area to meet with Newley Purnell of www.newley.com fame. Newley has been blogging since 2001, an era when, I believe, the word blog had yet to be coined. What did they call it back then, Newley? Online Diarying? Internet Loggery? Pointless Frivolity?

Newley lives just minutes away from Lang Suan Soi 6, a tiny alley that, come lunchtime, is a virtual magnet for hungry Thai office staff of every stripe. We decided the partake in the madness and dove directly into the heart of the soi. More or less halfway down we came across a raan khao kaeng , rice and curry shop, that serves up some very interesting looking nosh, and our fate was sealed.

Newley made a beeline for the green curry with chicken:

 

I suspect many of you are familiar with this dish, however the stuff you get in Thailand is quite unlike the green curry with chicken you&apos;ll find at your local Thai Hut in Gresham, Oregon (or wherever you are). The &quot;chicken&quot; in this case referred to a colourful mixture of meaty joints, fatty skin, cubes of coagulated blood and chewy feet--I don&apos;t think a breast was involved anywhere. Thai green curry also tends to be quite watery, and the obligatory eggplants tend to be pretty mushy. But that&apos;s how we like it.

I ordered a plate of some very tasty looking battered and deep-fried mushrooms:

 

Served with the spicy/sour Thai seafood dipping sauce, they were an unusual but delicious dish.

I also took the opportunity to introduce Newley to that very central Thai of dishes, nam phrik kapi :

 

Served, as tradition dictates, with a chubby deep-fried mackerel and fresh and par-boiled veggies. I wasn&apos;t sure if Newley could handle the heat of the nam phrik , but he proved himself fully able.

Incidentally, it is at this very curry shop that Newley was previously laughed at by several Thai women .

After lunch we explored the street and came across some interesting things, including sai ua , the famous northern Thai sausage:

 

some interesting looking mee kathi , sweet noodles:

Abbas is one of the 50 photographers shooting for the Thailand: 9 Days in the Kingdom project, and is one of the minority of 23 who still insists on using film (as opposed to digital). Abbas usually shoots in black and white, but he will be shooting in colour for this book. He will be taking photos in Pattani, a province in Thailand&apos;s troubled, Muslim-dominated south.

Incidentally, a movie is also being made of the 9 Days... project that will document the photographers at work. The filmmakers asked each photographer if he or she would mind being filmed, and Abbas, feeling certain that this would cramp his style, wrote on the form that he is &quot;unfriendly and difficult&quot;!

I found myself in the Tha Phra Chan area this evening and came across a fun street stall. It sold khao tom , which literally means &quot;boiled rice&quot;, but which usually refers to rice served with a variety of mostly Chinese-style stir-fried dishes. This khao tom stall was a bit unusual in that all the dishes were made in advance, and was also among the cheapest I&apos;ve ever come across: each dish was 10 baht (28 cents). Other than being mad cheap, this khao tom stall was also mad stocked:

 

 

And when you have this many choices, choosing side dishes is a serious business:

 

I chose squid stuffed with ground pork, tofu fried with bean sprouts, and stir-fried eggplants. Total: 45 baht ($1.25). The food wasn&apos;t necessarily very good, but sometimes variety is better than quality. I think, anyway.

Will be sure to come back with some southern Thai food porn, cool pics from the 9 Days... project, as well as some insight on Khmer khooking. In the meantime, some of my images have been featured on this American Express website , and I do believe that a photo feature I put together on the food of Luang Prabang should appear on the Lonely Planet website any day now.

I&apos;m currently in Phnom Penh, also something of an interesting food destination. Phil of Phnomenon has been gracious enough to take me around to the city&apos;s best markets and restaurants and I&apos;ve been having a great time. Will definitely post some pics and info when I get back to Bangkok at the end of the month.

As mentioned previously I spent the previous week in Cambodia&apos;s lovely capital, Phnom Penh. The visit wouldn&apos;t have been half as fun if it wasn&apos;t for the help of the friendly bloke above, Phil of Phnomenon . He was kind enough to accompany me to countless restaurants, food stalls and markets, and taught me a lot about his host country&apos;s unknown and underrated cuisine. One of the places he took me to was the slightly upscale Khmer restaurant, Sweet Cafe. I let Phil handle the ordering, and we began with what is possibly Cambodia&apos;s most famous dish, amok :

 

This dish is typically a steamed mixture of fish, herbs and curry paste, and takes several forms, but Sweet&apos;s slightly soupy version fit my preconceived notion of what the dish would be like. It was also the most delicious of the several I consumed during the week.

This was followed by a delicious &quot;salad&quot; of slightly sour shredded mango and the smoked fish known in Thai as plaa krob (&quot;crunchy fish&quot;):

 

This dish was sour, but not unpleasantly so, and had a delicious smokey flavour courtesy of the fish. Phil explained that Khmer cooking often emphasizes one flavour per dish, rather than trying to reach a balance of sour/spicy/salty/sweet as many of its neighbouring cuisines do.

One of the more unusual dishes of the meal was this &quot;omelet&quot; of ground pork and a kind of dried fish called trei prama :

 

Much like the Thai nam phrik , this dish was served with a variety of fresh, crispy vegetables, and it provided the salty aspect of our meal.

And finally there was the obligatory sour soup, a style of cooking that Phil feels is the true soul of Khmer cooking, and a variety of dishes I really learned to love during my time in Phnom Penh:

 

The particular soup above is known as samlaw machou yuan , &quot;Vietnamese sour soup&quot;, and took the form of a clear broth with huge hunks of freshwater fish and a variety of vegetables including pineapple and white radish. The soup was topped with a variety of fresh herbs and crispy fried garlic. It was, like much of the food I ate in Phnom Penh, simple but delicious.

Shhh... Don&apos;t tell anybody, but Phnom Penh is a great place for food. Not only do you have the fascinating Khmer cuisine, but the city is literally studded with tiny French, Italian, English, and even Russian and North Korean restaurants. After decades of eating simply to live, the Khmers seem to have begun living to eat, and the excitement about food in the city is almost palpable. For local flavours, a good place to start is evening at the Psar Thmei, where every evening a few vendors sell some low-key street food, including the delicious looking grilled squid above, and some noodle dishes:

 

However my favourite market was the Psar O Russei, Phnom Penh&apos;s largest. There you&apos;ll find everything ranging from roast piglets:

 

to ladies specializing in ingredients specifically for the countless varieties of samlaw , Khmer-style sour soups:

 

 

And this being Cambodia, there is a truly mind-boggling variety of freshwater fish:

 

Inside the market building you&apos;ll find fresh(ish) meat:

 

dried fish:

 

and a dark but inviting food court that must be the greatest conglomeration of Khmer food in the world:

 

I would highly recommend these stalls to anybody visiting the city. The selection was great, the prices cheap, and the stalls were actually much more sanitary than their outdoor brethren.

There are several fun markets within the downtown area alone, some specializing in raw ingredients:

 

 

 

and others featuring prepared food, such as grilled snakehead fish:

 

and deep-fried treats:

 

The waterfront along the Tonle Sap is also a decent place to grab a snack:

 

 

Especially if you share the Cambodian love for eating deep-fried insects:

 

But food is more or less everywhere in Phnom Penh:

 

 

 

And one particularly ubiquitous eat is sugarcane:

 

The stuff is peeled:

 

then squeezed through a frightening looking machine to produce some of the most refreshing liquid known to man:

As mentioned previously, I recently worked as an assistant to Eric Valli, one of 55 photographers involved in the Thailand: 9 Days in the Kingdom book project. Back in 1990 Eric did a National Geographic article and film about the workers who gather swift nests in the caves of southern Thailand. The nests, pictured above, are made from the hardened saliva of the swifts, and are believed by the Chinese to have medicinal properties. The gathering of the nests, which are located deep inside island caves, is also very dangerous and they are thus extremely valuable. For the 9 Days project Eric wanted to go back to these caves to photograph a profession and world that very few outsiders have ever seen.

I&apos;d love to post Eric&apos;s pics here, but reckon the publishing company wouldn&apos;t be too happy about that, so I&apos;ll have to rely on the images that I took, which is too bad, as Eric&apos;s images were simply amazing.

The man below is called Sahat and was the climber that Eric worked closely with nearly 20 years ago:

 

Sahat retired from gathering bird&apos;s nests about 10 years ago, but is still very strong, and at 72, earns money by, among other things, climbing and cutting the tops off of coconut palms!

This time Eric worked closely with a young climber called Sun:

 

a super guy, and one of most talented natural athletes I&apos;ve ever seen.

It&apos;s hard to explain in words the work these guys do because even after seeing them do it myself, the reality is simply quite unbelievable. Basically the climbers rely on a complicated network of bamboo scaffolding to reach bird nests that are often found at the highest and most deepest corners of the caves. These towers of bamboo can sometimes be literally hundreds of feet high, and the climbers climb up them barefoot, jamming their toes in the knots like steps. In places where the use of bamboo is not practical, they rely on bunches of vines, and increasingly nowadays, rope, to pull themselves up. Although nowadays most of the climbers wear modern harnesses (introduced by Eric), the only time they use them is when they are stationary and lash themselves to something stable (typically bamboo) if they have to reach for a particularly far wall of nests. And the electric light that Sun is wearing in the pic above is also a relatively recent introduction; when Eric was here in the late &apos;80s the climbers still relied on fiber torches that they gripped in their teeth!

As if this doesn&apos;t sound crazy enough, simply to reach the cave that we photographed involved an hour boat ride, a precarious climb up a sheer rock face, a long hike uphill and a 150 foot rappel, although the climbers simply chose to climb down the bamboo. Here is the cave seen from about halfway down:

 

Besides being dangerous, it was also very hard and dirty work, as this picture of Eric after a particularly difficult climb shows:

 

Here is Eric setting up a shot inside a relatively small cave on an island called Ko Li Pe:

 

As many of the caves are almost completely dark, we were limited to photographing in caves that had some natural light. This particular cave had quite a bit, and with the help of a flash, I was able to do these portraits:

 

 

 

Because of the value of the nests, each cave is protected by armed guards:

 

 

Although everybody assured us that there was little theft nowadays because &quot;the thieves are all dead.&quot;

Relaxing after a hard day&apos;s climb:

 

and Eric and I on our way back to Ko Yao Noi, where we were based for the week:

 

In all it was a difficult and sometimes scary, but amazing experience. Because of the high stakes and security, Eric reckons we are probably among the only outsiders, Thai or foreign, to have climbed in these caves with these people, which is quite an honor. And in case you&apos;re wondering how I feel about bird&apos;s nest soup, frankly I find the stuff--basically a sweet, tasteless broth with strands of noodle-like bird spit--rather disgusting. But don&apos;t tell the climbers I said that.

Food with friends always tastes better, especially if those friends happen to introduce you to really good restaurant you&apos;ve never been to before. Such was the case when I was taken to the famous Soi Polo fried chicken joint by experienced diner and South China Morning Post editor Hal Lipper, and self-confessed &quot;ace reporter&quot; Ron Gluckman (check out his site for a plethora of wacky Asian reportage) and his wife Jolanda. These guys all live within a few minutes&apos; walk of Soi Polo and had eaten there several times. For me getting to this part of town is something of a minor expedition and it was my very first time.

This restaurant has been popular among locals for ages (40 years, according to the sign), but particularly caught the attention of Bangkok&apos;s foreign community when it was featured in a New York Times article by RW Apple. On the day we visited the clientèle was overwhelmingly Thai (generally a good sign), and we began with som tam Thai :

 

The dish arrived within seconds, which made me fear that it might have been pre-made, but a taste proved the dish to be freshly pounded and really quite exceptional; sour and salty with hearty chunks of crisp papaya and unlike just about everywhere else, good-quality dried shrimp.

Everybody is familiar with laap , but I suggested ordering laap plaa duk , made from the meat of grilled catfish--something new to this group:

 

The catfish had a delicious smoky flavour that was accentuated, rather than overwhelmed, by the accompanying fish sauce, lime juice, powdered rice and chilies. And the dish wasn&apos;t &quot;mushy&quot; as it often is at lesser restaurants.

Continuing on the fish theme, Hal ordered plaa chorn naam tok , a deep-fried snakehead fish served with a hearty Isaan-influenced dressing:

 

and Ron wanted us the try the restaurants thord man , fish cakes:

 

which were almost certainly the largest I&apos;ve ever seen.

But everything else aside, this place is really all about the deep-fried chicken:

 

which was pretty amazing stuff, although, just to be picky, I found it a bit too meaty, myself preferring the scrawnier kai baan , free-range chicken. The chicken had been marinated in a dressing not unlike the famous deep-fried chicken from Hat Yai, and came with two good, but largely unnecessary dipping sauces. But I think everybody would agree with me that best bit was the copious crispy deep-fried garlic, which I&apos;m sure I could eat by the handful, like popcorn.

Everything we ordered was great, and I was particularly impressed by the quality of the ingredients: big, flavourful mint leaves, tasty catfish, meaty shallots et al . This is a restaurant that really does seem to deserve all the praise shoveled upon it.

Not like this.

Eating Thai food with non-Thais always reminds me how different our eating habits are. Although you&apos;re probably not going to offend anybody by holding your spoon the wrong way or taking to much yam wun sen , understanding how Thai people eat will undoubtedly smooth your way and maybe even provide a greater understanding of the food and people. And chicks love it. So here are a few tips on how to eat like the Thais do:

1. Order a balance of dishes. I know you all want to eat phat thai , but it&apos;s actually a jaan diaow , a one-plate meal typically enjoyed by one person eating alone. When eating with others, try to order dishes that everybody can share (i.e. virtually everything except phat thai or any other noodle dish). Also, try to order a good balance of dishes. Ordering four coconut milk-based curries is a bad idea you&apos;ll almost certainly regret later. I always try to order one fried vegetable dish, one sour soup and one uncooked dish, perhaps a yam (Thai-style salad), or a naam phrik (chili dip). Throw in a grilled or deep-fried fish and you&apos;ve got yourself a phat meal. This is very easy to do in most restaurants, and allows you to truly sample the variety of Thai cooking.

2. Always eat your food with rice. Growing up, I recall my family ordering Chinese food and how the rice would always end up unopened, in its white container, until, several months later, it solidified and went sour and was eventually thrown away. Needless to say, I don&apos;t do this any more. In fact, I can&apos;t even imagine eating a spicy kaeng som or a phat fai daeng without rice. In Thailand, rice is the &quot;base&quot; of the meal, much like bread elsewhere. And since the flavours of Thai cooking are so strong, you&apos;re going to want something to tone it down a bit anyway. There are many Thais who, in leaner times, have had little more to eat than a plate of rice and maybe a splash of fish sauce, but you&apos;ll find very few, if any, who have ever scarfed down a bowl of kaeng phet sans riz .

3. Dishes are shared. This is one concept that foreigners seem to have a particularly difficult time with. If you dine with Thais, they&apos;ll ask you to order one or two dishes that you fancy. However, when these dishes arrive, they are no longer &quot;your&quot; dishes to horde, rather they belong to everybody. On the same note, when serving yourself, you are expected to take one bite at a time, not one serving, from the central dish. Scraping a huge pile of food onto your rice can be seen as greedy here. And there are no &quot;courses&quot; per se in Thai food, so eat everything as it comes.

4. Use a fork and spoon. This is another big difference that has a couple dimensions. When dining informally, or with close friends, there often won&apos;t be any serving spoons. Thais use the same spoon they&apos;ve just shoved into their mouth to pick food from the central dish. This seemed very, very odd to me at first, but is just the way things are done here. And for those who are unsure about the mechanics of the fork and spoon, here&apos;s how it&apos;s done: with your right hand, use your spoon (or the communal spoon, if one is provided) to take the equivalent of one bite of food from the central dish. Put this directly on top of some of the rice on your plate. Holding the fork in your left hand, use it to push the now food-drenched mound of rice back onto your spoon. Shove the spoon in your gob. Repeat.

5. Tipping is not necessary or even expected in Thailand, but it sure is nice. The people who serve you your food in Thailand probably work 12 hours a day, six days a week, and earn very little. When paying, Thai diners typically leave their coin change, not so much as a tip, but more to avoid looking cheap. I try to leave 20 baht or so to look wealthy. Chicks love it.

I love Thai food, but after eating it day in day out sometimes I want something different, something a bit more exotic, something like... fish and chips. The Brits in the audience will no doubt laugh, but as a teenager growing up in Oregon, fish and chips seemed pretty exotic to me. Upon moving to Bangkok I was delighted to discover that fish and chips were quite readily available, and my usual (and now former) fish and chips haunt became a characterless room adjacent to a bar near Soi Cowboy, which, according Wikipedia is &quot;perhaps Bangkok&apos;s best known fish and chips shop&quot; . This may be true, but in retrospect, a visit to this place is an exercise in mediocre food in desperate surroundings. (For an excruciatingly detailed, and sometimes impassioned discussion on the fish and chips scene in Bangkok, check out this forum .)

Thus I was overjoyed to discover Oh My Cod!, a relatively new fish and chips joint and a card-carrying member of the British Federation of Fish Fryers . Today I finally made the long trip down to Banglamphoo, and was fortunate indulge in one of my favourite foods with Newley Purnell,

 

fellow Oregonian, fish and chips aficionado, and the body and brains behind newley.com .

Apparently there are other food products for sale at Oh My Cod!, but Newley and I dove straight into the f&amp;c. The restaurant offers a choice between red snapper or the more traditional cod, and being men of conscience we went for the not-yet-extinct snapper. As illustrated above, the dish takes the form of a mind-bogglingly puffy portion of fish accompanied by thick-cut chips (&quot;French fries&quot; for you American English speakers) and peas prepared either &quot;garden&quot; or &quot;mushy&quot; style. The fish batter was spot-on crispy and flaky, but the enclosed snapper was a tad soft and mushy.

The fish was followed by a right proper cuppa:

 

of PG Tips no less. And being &quot;fully licensed to sell drinks&quot; the menu at Oh My Cod! also includes some imported English beers and ciders, as well as the elusive Beer Lao. The restaurant also sports a pleasant outdoor dining area:

 

and what must be one of the most detailed websites in the history of fish and chip restaurant websites. The only bummer was our surly nose-ringed waitress, who refused to speak Thai with us, but who didn&apos;t seem able to speak English either. Not sure exactly how she expected to communicate, as my sign language skills are pretty rusty. Regardless, I will doubtlessly be returning.

It&apos;s Saturday, which means my neighbourhood&apos;s talaat nat , or weekly market. It&apos;s quite a big deal, and we even get shoppers from other nearby neighbourhoods. The market is a real family affair, and children are expected to help their parents:

 

and, in some cases, apparently also help with the shopping!

 

This guy was selling kai baan, free-range chickens:

 

and chicken boiled in a fish sauce-based broth was what made this stall so popular:

 

The variety of food at the market is pretty amazing. We have everything from northern Thai food:

 

to southern specialties:

I reckon this dish--meat fried with a kind of basil leaf, garlic and chilies--is the closest equivalent to Thai &quot;comfort&quot; food. It&apos;s quick, nourishing and delicious, and is available just about everywhere. You can make it with virtually any meat or seafood, although I&apos;ve decided to use the ubiquitous (and delicious) squid.

A couple things to keep in mind when making phat kraphrao at home are that you&apos;ll need bai kraphrao (holy basil, the dish&apos;s namesake), not bai horaphaa , Thai basil. Bai horaphaa, although more familiar to most people, is almost only eaten raw, or as a garnish. Bai kraphrao, on the other hand, is always cooked, and it&apos;s bitter-spicy flavour is a world apart from the sweet, anise-like taste of bai horaphaa.

Also, ideally you&apos;ll want a hot, preferably gas or propane stove to make this dish. The idea with this dish is to cook it quickly and at a high heat to allow the ingredients to remain fresh and crispy. If you really know what you&apos;re doing, you can also tilt the wok and &quot;ignite&quot; the dish while cooking in order to impart a delicious smoky flavour (shown below). If an electric stove is all you&apos;ve got, then by all means go ahead, but the relatively low heat means that the dish will inevitably be slightly soggy and overcooked.

And as always, I&apos;m not going to tell you how much seasoning you need to put into the dish. I recommend adding fish sauce a teaspoon (or small glug) at a time, tasting after each addition to make sure you&apos;ve added enough. For reference, phat kraphrao should be slightly salty and spicy, so feel free to indulge. And if after cooking you&apos;ve found it&apos;s not spicy enough, you can always make a quick bowl of phrik naam plaa , sliced chilies and garlic in fish sauce, a typical accompaniment to this dish.

Here&apos;s what you&apos;ll need to make two dishes of phat kraphrao :

 

Squid (or other meat or seafood), 4 medium
Bai kraphrao, (holy basil), two large handfuls
Long bean, 4-5 beans
Garlic, about 4-5 large cloves
Chilies, to taste
Cooking oil, 2 Tbsp
Fish sauce, to taste
Oyster sauce, about 1 Tbsp
Sugar (optional), to taste
Rice (not optional), two plates
Fried egg (optional)
Prik naam plaa (optional)

Begin by cleaning and preparing your squid (if you&apos;re not sure how this is done, go here ). Slice into thick rings and set aside.

Wash bai kraphrao and remove the leaves:

 

Set aside. Wash long bean and cut into 1/2-inch pieces:

 

Set aside. In a mortar and pestle, grind up your garlic and chilies into a coarse mash (not a fine paste):

 

Set aside.

Prepare your mise en place : within reaching distance of your wok, place a bottle of fish sauce, a bowl of sugar and a bottle of water. Have all your ingredients close at hand, open and ready to throw in the wok. The entire cooking time of this dish should be no more than a minute, so you won&apos;t have time to be hunting around for things once you&apos;ve begun.

With the flame on med-high, heat 1 Tbsp of oil and add half of the mashed chilies and garlic. Saute about 10 seconds:

 

Increase heat to high and add half of the sliced long bean and a tablespoon or two of water. Fry until long bean is cooked but still crispy, about 20 seconds:

 

Add half of the squid, followed by a splash of fish sauce, oyster sauce and sugar (if using). Stirring constantly at very high heat, fry until squid is just done, about 10 seconds:

 

Add a tablespoon or two of water if mixture is beginning to dry out, and toss in a haldful basil (don&apos;t worry if this looks like too much; the basil shrinks considerably when cooked). Stir thoroughly to combine, taste and add more fish sauce or sugar if necessary. Fry until basil is just wilted but not limp, about 15 additional seconds.

Serve phat kraphrao steaming hot over hot rice with a fried egg on top, if desired. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

Ever try to order food in a Thai restaurant only to be completely and utterly misunderstood, or even worse, ignored? Perhaps it&apos;s because you just came in from Khao San Road and are not wearing shoes and shirt. But in most cases it&apos;s probably because you&apos;re not pronouncing the names of Thai dishes correctly. Thai is a picky language, and a misdirected tone, a shortened vowel or improperly articulated consonant can mean the difference between a hot meal and yet another bag of &quot;Thai Basil&quot; chips at 7-11. And not only are Thai words hard to pronounce, but,there is no commonly accepted method of transliteration from Thai to English, so a dish you saw spelled one way on a menu last week, could very well be spelled differently in the next place. To help you understand and make yourself understood, I&apos;ve put together a basic guide to Thai pronunciation and transliteration.

 Som tam 
I sometimes hear non-Thais pronounce the first consonant of the second word like our t in English (ie aspirated, with a puff of air). Generally, if you see something written with a t, it is probably referring to the unaspirated t sound (somewhere between a t and a d, and similar to the t in the English word &quot;stand&quot;). On the other hand, if you see a Thai word with th, it is never pronounced like the th in the English words &quot;thin&quot; or &quot;this&quot;, but is rather the aspirated (accompanied by a puff of air) t sound. The same goes for k, kh, p and ph. Sometimes the unaspirated t is also written as dt, which personally I find confusing.

 Phat thai or phad thai ? 
In Thai there is no difference between a final t or d sound (or ph, p or b for that matter). However do keep in mind that ph is the aspirated p sound, and is not equivalent to f.

 Larb vs. larp vs. laab vs. laap vs. lahp 
The length of the vowel sound is very important in Thai, and to convey a long vowel sound, English transliteration often sticks an r (or sometimes an h) into the mix. Myself, I prefer just to double the vowel, as the Thai long vowel sound is not exactly like the English r sound. Regarding the words above, there is no &quot;correct&quot; spelling--just remember to pronounce a long vowel sound when you say the name of the dish.

 Some sounds simply don&apos;t exist in English
 Obviously transliteration has its limits, particularly in the lack of tones (a whole other can of worms that I won&apos;t get into here) as well as the various sounds that are common in Thai, but that aren&apos;t found in English. A couple examples of this are the eu sound, found in the word for &quot;one&quot; ( neung ), which is made by smiling (as opposed to rounding the lips). Another sound that doesn&apos;t have a real equivalent, and tends to be written any number of ways is the aw (like in the English word &quot;law&quot;) sound. Sometimes you&apos;ll see this transcribed as o or or .

 l and r 
The written Thai language distinguishes between r and l, but in everyday speech, the r is almost always pronounced like an l (in Laos they&apos;ve done away with the r sound altogether). This is why the dish raad naa , when said by a cook on a street corner in Bangkok, is going to sound more like laad naa .

Today I had lunch with the Lonely Planet&apos;s Man in Japan, Chris Rowthorn. Chris trusts me enough to let me choose where we eat lunch, which, if you ask me, is the highest level of trust. Around noontime we found ourselves near the venerable Nang Loeng Market , and I decided to stop in at Ratana, a curry restaurant I had seen, but had yet to try. Like many of the places in the area, Ratana is simple, but oozes heaps of old-school Bangkok charm. The line of people out front is a sure-fire sign of good eats anywhere in Thailand. And as illustrated above, the amazing selection of curries, soups and fried dishes is a great introduction to Bangkok-style Thai cooking.

We began with green curry with beef:

 

which was more like a stir-fry than the soupy curry you&apos;ll find in most places. It was also among the tastiest green curries I&apos;ve ever sampled, the curry paste sporting a healthy dose of peppercorns. I was curious about this somewhat unusual flavour and asked the cook, who told me that the shop makes all of its own curry pastes, something quite uncommon nowadays.

This was followed by a Chinese-style stir-fry of veggies and shrimp:

 

a pretty common dish at Bangkok curry shops of this ilk, and a decent source of the green.

More interesting (but far less photogenic) was a bowl of tom yam with pork leg:

 

Unlike most tom yam, which are generally seafood-based and clear in broth, this one was bordering on stew like, but still tasted light thanks to the copious lime juice. The soup supported several chunks of hearty pork leg, including bone, skin, and even, if I remember correctly, a bit of meat. A truly wonderful dish.

And finally Chris was curious to try khao khluk kapi :

 

the dish of rice cooked in shrimp paste and served with a variety of toppings. Ratana&apos;s version was very, very good, and also unusual in that they topped the dish with an herb called cha om , the long green leaves seen in the pic, which have a slightly pungent flavour.

I often receive emails asking about what kind of photo equipment I use or how I edit my photos. I&apos;m flattered by this, as although I do earn my bread by taking photos, I&apos;ve only been shooting professionally for a couple years now. Go back to the early days of this blog , and you&apos;ll see some pretty horrible pics and even worse editing. Regardless, I&apos;m learning and improving all the time, and for those of you who care, the following outlines what I shoot with, and how I edit my pictures.

I shoot with a Nikon D200. I really, really like this camera; it feels strong and durable like my F100 (a Nikon film camera), and the controls are easy to use and intuitive. The only downside is that, at least in my experience, the images require some basic post-processing, as you will see below.

In terms of lenses, the vast majority of the shots on this page are taken with my Nikon 35mm f/2. When put on the D200, the 1.5 factor makes it very close to a 50mm &quot;normal&quot; lens, i.e., similar to what the human eye sees. It&apos;s a light, compact lens that because of the fast aperture, is great in low-light situations. Sometimes I&apos;ll also use my Nikon 60mm f/2.8 Macro, probably the best lens I own, although obviously it requires a bit more light (and distance). After having used a few off-brands, I&apos;ve decided I&apos;m only going to use Nikon lenses from now on. And of course I always use Nikon UV filters to protect the glass.

I always shoot in RAW (with accompanying jpegs), because I don&apos;t like to worry too much about getting the exposure just right, and with RAW you can &quot;push&quot; or &quot;pull&quot; the image up to a stop or more with no real repercussions. I import my images using Nikon Transfer and use Nikon View 6 to weed through the jpegs and organize my images. I use Photoshop CS2&apos;s RAW converter (not the useless Nikon one) to adjust white balance (another advantage of shooting in RAW), exposure and boost the saturation. I also use this screen to adjust the colour space, using sRGB if the image is going on the web. In Photoshop I improve the contrast using Levels, resize and sharpen. Sometimes I&apos;ll crop, but rarely, if ever, do I do more than this.

As an example, here&apos;s a shot as it looks directly from my D200, with no editing or changes whatsoever:

 

And here&apos;s the same image after adjusting white balance, giving it an exposure increase of 1/2 a stop, a saturation boost of 15, and some adjusting of Levels and a Sharpen:

 

That&apos;s it, and really, that&apos;s about the extent of my Photoshop knowledge. I have no idea how to cut ugly people out of an image or change the color of a bowl from red to green (or whatever), so everything you see here is real.

One invaluable tool in doing this blog has been Flickr . In the beginning I posted my pics directly with Blogger, with horrible results . At Flickr, I can fully control the quality of my images and they appear on my blog exactly as I&apos;ve edited them.

I&apos;m self-taught, and my greatest resource has been, not surprisingly, the Internet. My latest and greatest find is Strobist , a blog that teaches great off-camera lighting techniques using very simple gear. I recently bought a light stand and an umbrella, and am having lots of fun using my simple SB-800 to make studio-quality shots. K en Rockwell is a great site to learn about gear and/or technique, and for pure photographic inspiration, go to the Magnum Photos site , or browse David Alan Harvey&apos;s blog .

But really, all this technical stuff is pretty boring; if you want to improve, get out and shoot!

click on the image I&apos;m in the process of interviewing some locals for an upcoming Lonely Planet book and chose to profile Suthon Sukphisit, author of the Bangkok Post&apos;s weekly Thai food column, Cornucopia. I&apos;ve been reading Cornucopia for years, and always thought Suthon must be the closest thing to a living encyclopedia on Thai food. I wanted to pick his brain about Chinatown, an area known for its food, and he was kind enough to meet me and show me around for a few hours last night. I&apos;ve been to Chinatown many times, but going with Suthon was a truly eye-opening experience. He seems to be familiar with literally every tiny alley and side street, and took me to and pointed out some of his favourite food-related places.

Our first stop was the subject of one of Suthon&apos;s numerous articles; an ancient house where a man named Thot is the second generation of his family to make kun chiang , Chinese-style sausage:

 

Khut Thot still makes sausages by hand in the same place his parents did--an ancient Chinese shophouse on Thanon Plaeng Naam, the very house he grew up in:

 

After mixing &quot;good quality&quot; pork with spices, he stuffs the casings and hangs them in a locker over warm coals:

 

After a few hours of this, he&apos;ll move them to another locker where they&apos;ll dry for a day. The sausages are done at this point, but still need to be cooked before you can eat them. Khun Thot was kind enough to give me a bag of his kun chiang, which I&apos;m really looking forward to trying.

Just a few steps away is a famous vendor selling khanom jeep , Chinese steamed dumplings:

 

This vendor has gained a reputation for making the dim sum-style snack by hand using a traditional recipe, something he claims to have done for 50 years! He starts selling at lunch, and will remain on the street until he&apos;s sold everything:

 

Served with a light soy sauce and deep-fried crispy garlic, the khanom jeep were delicious, and a world away from the recently-thawed, oily, tasteless clumps you&apos;ll find elsewhere. And later, in a backstreet scene reminiscent of medieval Europe, we even got a glance of how the dough wrappers are still made using traditional methods:

Heading up towards Thanon Mangkorn we passed by a famous curry shop called Jay Puy. On the surface, it looks like any other street side curry shop in Bangkok, and I&apos;d walked by it several times without noticing anything in particular. However Suthon pointed out one quirky aspect:

 

Jay Puy has no tables--something that Suthon claims has no impact on the number of people who eat there. &quot;In the rainy season they don&apos;t have a roof or umbrella,&quot; says Suthon, &quot;but people still eat there!&quot; The shop is known for kaeng karii , literally &quot;curry&quot;, but a Chinese take on the Indian/Thai dish. Suthon explained that the curries here aren&apos;t as thick or as spicy as the Thai version, and that they are thickened with flour, as not to be so oily.

4pm-9pm

Our evening ended at a tiny, dark alley off of Thanon Plaeng Naam where Suthon wanted to take me to Jay Joo, one of his favourite restaurants in Chinatown, and a place he described as being more Chinese than Thai:

 

&quot;Real Chinese food has to made over a very, very hot flame,&quot; explained Suthon. As seen above, Jay Joo&apos;s coal-burning stoves were indeed very hot, and Suthon ordered plaa kiam buay , a deep-fried fish served in sour broth of salted plums and ginger; tao hoo song khrueang , deep-fried tofu served in a thick sauce with veggies; and kung kap plaa muek phat nam phrik phao , fresh shrimp and pickled squid fried in chili paste:

 

Everything was outstanding, and coupled with the exotic atmosphere (a huge family eating nearby, rats underfoot) and a few cans of Singha, made a memorable meal that topped off a truly memorable evening.

While here he interviewed me for the Swedish radio food program, Meny . I was honored to be involved in this, and we had a great time eating and talking about som tam . However I hate listening to my own voice, and the thought of my own voice stumbling over a language I haven&apos;t spoken in 10 years, well... Anyway, to hear the program go the this page and click the speaker symbol near the phrase &quot;torsdag 1 mars 2007&quot;. Apparently our bit is towards the end. If you can&apos;t understand a thing, consider yourself lucky. (And let me know how it went.)

(15 minutes later: OK, I couldn&apos;t resist and listened to it, and other than a few cop outs into English, it wasn&apos;t that bad. Göran is an amazing editor, apparently.)

Continuing on my Lonely Planet assignment, I spent yesterday morning at Kathmandu, a photography gallery owned by one of Thailand&apos;s most lauded photographers, Manit Sriwanichpoom. Located in a restored Chinese shophouse on Thanon Pan (near the Hindu temple off of Silom), Kathmandu is one of the only galleries in Bangkok specifically dedicated to photography. It also happens to be located smack dab in the middle of one of Bangkok&apos;s most eclectic food areas. Within steps of Kathmandu you have Burmese, Persian, southern Indian, northern Indian, and some well-known Thai restaurants. After I finished shooting, Manit&apos;s wife was kind enough to supply us with thali from Mashoor, a northern Indian vegetarian restaurant located directly across the road:

 

They comprised of (starting at 12:00 and moving clockwise) a curry of peas and paneer (fresh cheese), curried okra, dhal, home made yogurt, fresh chappitis and pappadum, gulab jamun and rice. Everything was excellent, and I can&apos;t imagine a better Bangkok Sunday outing than an exotic meal followed by a visit to the Hindu temple and a look at excellent photography on display at Kathmandu.

Exploring Chinatown the other day, Khun Suthon tipped me off to a tiny restaurant that he said made the best hoy tawt , fried mussels/oysters, in Bangkok. This caught my ear, as hoy thawt is a dish with such potential--who doesn&apos;t love eggs, oysters and oil? But it&apos;s also a dish that has disappointed me nearly every time I&apos;ve ordered it (who likes ill-prepared eggs, oysters and oil?). Finding myself in Chinatown again recently, I made a point of stopping by.

 

The restaurant is called hoy thawt jao kao plaeng naam, meaning that it was previously located on Thanon Plaeng Naam. After 11 years at that location they moved directly across the street, where they&apos;ve been for four years now.

The hoy thawt made here are of the crispy variety, which basically means they fry the crap out of them:

 

You have a choice between oysters or mussels, and I chose the latter. The plump, fresh-looking mussels were fried with egg, batter and lotsa garlic until bordering on burnt. This was then broken up and served on top of bean sprouts that had also been fried in oil. The result was predictably very, very oily, but undeniably delicious, and was served with a really nice spicy/sour sauce. Cholesterol issues aside, I think Khun Suthon just might be right.

I&apos;ve been doing restaurant reviews for a local listings mag as of late and have decided to include some of the more interesting places here. However, I should make it clear that for each of these, my visit has been arranged ahead of time and I&apos;m not paying for the food. Despite this, I&apos;ll do my best to be as objective as possible, and my goal is simply to spread the word of good eats in Bangkok, not to promote certain restaurants.

One of my first visits has to be one of the oddest restaurants in Bangkok. Big Mama describes itself as a pizzeria/Italian restaurant, but could be more accurately classified as Italian-American food with Thai accents as served to a Japanese and Korean clientele. Despite this geographical confusion, it works somehow, and I really enjoyed the majority of my meal.

Being a fan of salt and fish, I began with anchovy spaghetti:

 

Which was served in an earthenware container, topped with a dough lid and baked for a few minutes. Upon arriving at the table, the staff opens this &apos;lid&apos;:

 

to reveal steaming pasta topped with anchovies, chilies and parsley. However the best part was found at the bottom of the bowl, and was a &apos;sauce&apos; of garlic and shallots sauteed in olive oil until they reached an almost creamlike state. This dish, with its disparate Italian roots, hearty American serving size, and Thai flavours, somehow really worked.

The pasta was accompanied by Greek salad:

 

Which was just about perfect--a tasty, well-balanced dressing, delicious tomatoes and bell peppers (that I suspect come from the excellent Royal Project Foundation ), and plenty of salty feta.

And this being a pizzeria, they encouraged me to try one of their pizzas, and provided a combo:

 

The pizza, really the only disappointment of the meal, was topped with a bizarre combination of hot dog-like sausage, lunch meat ham, enoki mushrooms, bell peppers and cheese. Despite being made in a custom-built wood-burning oven, the pie just couldn&apos;t support the extreme variety of unrelated toppings and mostly went home in a doggie bag. A bit odd that they would choose this particular pie for me to sample. To be fair, the sauce was nice, and the dough OK, and I suspect a pizza of more subtle topping could very well be pretty good.

In addition to the colourful interior (first pic above), Big Mama also has a pleasant outdoor dining area:

 

If I lived closer, I would easily make Big Mama my local Italian/American/Thai restaurant.

click on the image Exploring Chinatown with Khun Suthon last week I was pointed in the direction of a curious streetside curry shop with no tables. As illustrated above (take a look at the guy in the white shirt), diners sit at tiny plastic chairs, holding a plate of rice and curry in one hand while they eat with the other. We didn&apos;t have time to visit the shop that day, but I was back in the area again and made a point of stopping by. As you can see above, things were a bit more &quot;busy&quot; this time. Fortunately for me the line was made up of those wanting to buy curry to take home. I wanted the entire table-less dining experience, and squeezed my way into the only free stool. A very loud gentleman shouted at me to order, and I timidly asked for a plate of green curry with fish balls over rice. In the meantime I was given a cup of weak iced tea, which the other diners and I put on an unoccupied stool. A moment later I was served, and like the others around me: raised my plate and dug in.

After a few minutes I realized that I was virtually the only one who ordered green curry. All the others had ordered kaeng karii , literally &quot;curry&quot;, a Chinese take on the Indian-Thai-Anglo dish. This was served over rice with sliced phrik chii faa chilies and slices of the deep-fried Chinese sausage, kun chiang . My green curry was pretty good--a bit bland perhaps, but with excellent homemade fish balls--but the kaeng karii looked pretty amazing, especially with all those unusual toppings. Unfortunately I had some more eating to do that day and couldn&apos;t risk a second dish. Next time though...

I was recently in the Thong Lor area of Sukhumvit Road and came across Boon Tong Kiat, a restaurant selling &quot;Singapore chicken rice&quot;. Despite having visited the country several times, I only recently became aware that chicken rice is Singapore&apos;s &apos;national&apos; dish and was curious to see how it differed from the Thai version. The shop was also highly recommended by a friend, so I stopped by.

From the get-go, Boon Tong Kiat&apos;s khao man kai looks quite different than the domestic version of this Chinese dish. The rice had a slightly gold hue, which according to an extremely detailed sign inside the restaurant, was due to the use of &quot;nine different spices&quot;. In addition to this, the sign explained that the rice was also &quot;the finest jasmine rice in the country&quot;, and was first fried in a wok over high heat before being cooked over medium heat in a gas-powered rice cooker, before finally kept warm in a &quot;Singaporean rice cooker&quot;. There was an equal amount of information regarding the cooking of the chicken, the majority of which escapes me now.

Culinary mission statements aside, it took only a simple taste to realize that Boon Tong Kiat is doing something special here. The rice was was fragrant with the &quot;nine spices&quot;, galangal being the only one I could identify with some confidence, and was perfectly cooked, being both tender and toothsome. The chicken was also tender but not mushy, and was juicy and flavourful. This was the first time I&apos;d seen this simple dish done to its full potential, and I loved it.

Halfway into the dish, I noticed that the restaurant also did rojak, a sweet/sour &apos;salad&apos; of Indonesian origin known at Boon Tong Kiat as som tam singapore . I loved this dish from my visits to Singapore and couldn&apos;t resist ordering:

 

Boon Tong Kiat&apos;s version was pretty spot on and combined par-boiled morning glory, crunchy bits of cucumber, pineapple, apple and the deep-fried Chinese dough fritters known as you tiao . This was topped with the thick, sweet/sour sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The sauce wasn&apos;t as profound or thick as that I&apos;ve had in Penang, but tasted more or less as it should.

In addition to chicken rice and rojak, Boon Tong Kiat also prepares a variety of Sino/Singaporean-foods. And despite Singapore being virtually a neighbor of Thailand, this shop, as far as I know, is the only place in town where you can find such dishes. Very highly recommended.

In Bangkok nowadays you can find Sri Lankan, Korean, regional Japanese, southern Indian, Persian, Burmese and Lao restaurants, among others, but until recently, no Malaysian. Not a single restaurant. I find this exceedingly odd, as Malaysian food is undeniably delicious, and many of the ingredients and flavours of Malaysian cooking are identical to Thai. Not to mention the fact that Thai food (in particular tom yam) is very popular in Malaysia--why not the opposite?

This will probably remain a mystery, but I was delighted to come across Kopitiam, a Malaysian cafe/restaurant on Thong Lor. Kopitiam literally means coffee shop, but this tiny restaurant also serves a variety of Malaysian and Thai dishes. The owner, Georgette, is a native of Kuala Lumpur who has lived in Bangkok for 18 years. After several years of making Malaysian food for her friends, she decided to spread the love and open her own place, and the restaurant has been open about half a year now.

With her guidance, I began with nasi lemak, rice cooked in coconut cream and served with a variety of side dishes:

 

Kopitiam&apos;s version was served with the traditional accompaniments of crispy fish and peanuts, squid sambal , a boiled egg, and somewhat unusually, the owner&apos;s savoury beef rendang. Nasi lemak is a simple dish, but very nice, and everything was excellent, the flavours just as I remember from breakfast in Penang or KL.

I also had rojak, the Indo-Malay-Singaporean salad of crispy fruits and veggies:

 
my second dish this week. I&apos;m not enough of a rojak expert to authoritatively differentiate between this and Boon Tong Kiat&apos;s, but will venture to say that I found Kopitiam&apos;s dressing a bit richer. Georgette was kind enough to show me hae ko , the prawn paste that is the essential ingredient in this sauce.

Kopitiam also serves Malaysian favourites such as roti canai, a couple kinds of laska, and of course, teh tarik. If you live in Bangkok and you&apos;re craving Malaysian you really don&apos;t have any other choice, but it&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;ll be disappointed.

click on the image In the course of doing some research for an upcoming Lonely Planet guide I recently came across a cool website with some traditional Lao recipes . Apparently they were originally written by Phia Sing, a former chef to the former Lao royal family, and later compiled and translated into a book by English food expert, Alan Davidson . I&apos;ve actually heard of this book (it provides much of the basis for Ant Egg Soup , a Lao food-based travelogue), and it sounds fascinating, although I&apos;ve never seen it in SE Asia. Regarding the 15 recipes shown on the site, I would particularly recommend stuffed bamboo shoots , or if you can get your hands on some water buffalo meat, the thick, vegetable-laden stew known as or lam , both dishes I&apos;ve enjoyed very much in Laos.

I recently had a very fun dinner with friend, Hal Lipper and his wife, Jing. Hal is a talented and enthusiastic cook and was keen to try some recipes from his new cookbook, Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook: Recipes from Hunan Province by English cookbook author, Fuchsia Dunlop . The Beijing element mentioned in the title of this post refers to the fact that Hal lived in Beijing for many years and his wife is a native of that city. In fact, he has actually been working with his wife to compile her mother&apos;s family recipes in the form of a cookbook:

 

and they have recorded over 100 recipes at this point. I was lucky enough to try a couple of them that night, including a simple but delicious dish of pickled cabbage:

 

and an appetizer of grilled bell peppers served with 1000 year-old eggs:

 

However the bulk of the dishes Hal made came from Dunlop&apos;s book. One dish that Jing grew up with, but that is also featured in Dunlop&apos;s book was something Dunlop calls Lotus Root &quot;Sandwich&quot; Fritters. Hal wasn&apos;t able to get ahold of lotus root so he used eggplant instead:

 

As seen above, the &quot;sandwich&quot; refers to the use of two slices of eggplant surrounding a filling of ground pork mixed with egg. These are coated in a simple batter and fried until crispy:

 

This was followed by Strange-Flavour Chicken, a combination of cucumbers, shredded chicken and a unique peanut sauce:

 

According to Dunlop, &quot;The curious name &quot;strange flavour&quot; derives from the a bizarre but deeply satisfying combination of salty, sweet, sour, nutty, hot and numbing flavours.&quot; This is probably true, but if one follows Dunlops seasoning suggestions for the sauce, the leading flavour is an deeply unsatisfying bland. Hal was forced to remedy the mixture with some extra vinegar and soy sauce and the result was quite nice, although not nearly as intense as Dunlop suggests.

One of the most unusual dishes of the evening was something that Dunlop calls Pearly Meatballs. This was a combination of ground pork, water chestnuts and spices formed into balls and coated with a mixture of sticky rice, ham and mushrooms:

 

They are are then steamed:

 

and the result was very nice; meaty and crunchy (from the chestnuts), but still requiring a boost in the seasoning department, and we were compelled to dip them in soy sauce.

The biggest disappointment of the night (for Hal at least) was Chairman Mao&apos;s Red-Braised Pork (shown at the top of the post, as well as on the cover of Dunlop&apos;s book). Hal chose to substitute the fatty pork belly with pork ribs, and despite doubling the spices called for in the recipe, the result was still rather bland. Even the braising liquid, reduced to a thick red sauce, was somehow lacking in flavour.

This was coupled with Dongting Stir-Fried Duck Breast:

 

At this point Hal simply disregarded Dunlop&apos;s seasoning suggestions altogether and cooked the dish to taste. The result was a simple, but delicious (and well-cooked) stir fry, and probably the most delicious dish of the meal.

The New York Times&apos; review of Fuchsia Dunlop&apos;s book can be seen here . The author of this review declares that, &quot;Every recipe I tried was a rousing success.&quot; Not sure if Hal would agree...

The sign says raachaa khaao mok , &quot;The king of biryani,&quot; and that about says it all. Yusup Phochana, a Muslim restaurant located minutes from my house in northern Bangkok is probably my favourite place in town. I&apos;ve mentioned it previously here and here , and just recently, after being shut down for a month, the restaurant moved into new digs even closer to my house. I&apos;m happy, and thought it was high time remind people of its existence.

I ordered, as always, khaao mok plaa , fish biryani:

 

You&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find another fish version of this dish in Bangkok, not to mention a khao mok this strong. Mr Yusup employs mackerel steaks that are cooked directly in the absolutely delicious rice, and topped with crispy deep-fried shallots, a couple slices of cucumber, and a sour/spicy/sweet sauce. The restaurant also does the ubiquitous chicken, and the slightly more unusual goat versions of the dish.

This was accompanied by sup haang wua , oxtail soup:

 

a deliciously sour/spicy/salty broth loaded with fatty oxtail and topped with deep-fried crispy shallots. The broth is so flavourful and hearty you could almost stand a spoon up in it. Those not keen on eating oxtail can go for the sup kai , chicken soup, which is very similar.

Desert took the form of rotii waan :

 

a paratha-like crispy pancake topped with sweetened condensed milk and sugar--a meal that would send most carbo-paranoid Americans running away screaming.

They&apos;ve got lots of other stuff here: curry noodles, &quot;Muslim&quot; salad, mataba , satay, and some absolutely amazing curries, so I reckon there&apos;s something for everybody--other than vegetarians.

Detailed instructions:
Here&apos;s the bad news: for those located in central Bangkok, getting to Yusup Phochana is going to be something of a trek. The restaurant is located in northern Bangkok along the Kaset-Navamin highway (also known as sen tat mai ). If you&apos;re coming from Mor Chit BTS/Phaholyothin, turn right at the Kaset Intersection onto the Kaset-Navamin highway. Go past the first stop light and the restaurant is on the left side just after a very large sign with the Swiss flag (as well as several Thai-language signs advertising the restaurant). If you get lost, go ahead and try one of the mobile number above, but I&apos;m pretty sure these people don&apos;t speak English.

I&apos;ll admit, the issue of the best noodles in town is as subjective as it gets . Despite this, it&apos;s an issue that can result in heated debate, ill-tempered shouting and dissolved friendships. Fortunately, operating from the format of this blog, I&apos;m able to provide some legitimacy to my vote for the Best Noodles in Town. So there. I originally came across this stall in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown several months ago while waiting for a train at Hua Lamphong. I tried to find it many times since then, but only succeeded recently.

The tiny stall boasts three (maybe four?) tables on an incredibly polluted, noisy and hectic stretch of Thanon Yaowarat. This is literally street food; if the vendor sticks her bum out too far what blanching bean sprouts she&apos;s going to regret it.

 

The stall&apos;s sign claims that the fishballs are all homemade, and this appears to be true. The balls are soft without being rubbery, and unlike most places, actually taste like fish--and fresh fish at that. The broth is clear but not bland, and heartily laced with cripsy deep-fried garlic, and what appears to be pickled garlic as well. I ordered kwaytiaow look chin ruam , mixed fishball noodle soup (pictured above), a dish combining four or five different kind of fish balls, a few par-boiled bean sprouts and a pinch of chopped green onion. I always order this with sen yai , the thick rice noodles, and top it off with a couple spoonfuls of the garlic/chili/vinegar sauce, and a splash of fish sauce.

Damn.

The noodle stall has no name as far as I can tell and is located on Thanon Yaowarat near the corner of Thanon Plaeng Naam. Good luck.

It&apos;s good to know people in other parts of town. Today my friend Cherry, a resident of Thonburi, took me to Tha Din Daeng, a part of her &apos;hood I would otherwise never have visited. According to Cherry, this area is known for its vendors who sell satay, the Indo/Malaysian dish of grilled skewers of meat.

There are several satay vendors along this relatively short street, and they serve from lunch until late evening, and use some of the longest grills I&apos;ve ever seen:

 

I can&apos;t even imagine how hot it must be to grill food over coals on an April day in Thailand:

 

We sat down at the first shop we came to and ordered 20 sticks. As shown in the first pic, pork satay is served with the famous peanut sauce (which, incidentally, many people in America mistakenly associate with Thai food) and shallots, cucumbers and sliced chilies in a vinegar/syrup mixture. In Thailand satay is also often served with grilled white bread:

 

something I&apos;d be curious to know the origin of.

Everything was great, although I must admit that I prefer the Malaysian practice of furiously fanning the flames so that the satay have a smokier flavour. Cherry, on the other hand, seemed to find no fault with it:

click on the image I&apos;ve been wanting to do a photo blog for a while, and finally, here it is. Actually setting up the blog was a matter of a few moments; the hard part was thinking of a name. The one I finally decided on actually comes from a Pogues song that happened to come on while I happened to be sitting trying to think of a name... I&apos;ve been obsessed with the &quot;street&quot; photography of masters such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Elliott Erwitt , and thought the name reflected something of the nature of their work, as well as the essence of the images I hope to show here. These are going to be works in progress; the pics that I snap on the way to a job, or something I&apos;m proud of that will probably never sell, but that I like nonetheless. My main inspiration for this concept has got to be David Alan Harvey. Despite being a Magnum photographer and filing a constant stream of stories with National Geographic, the guy still finds time to add to his own blog, At Home with David Alan Harvey .

At present she&apos;s looking pretty sorry--I&apos;ll get a custom banner and add some links hopefully sooner rather than later. For now I just wanted to get it up as soon as possible, as in a matter of hours I&apos;m to leave for Stockholm, Sweden, then on to my home Oregon, and wanted a place to post images from both of these locations. For now I&apos;ll start in my third &quot;hometown&quot; of Bangkok. I Happened to be down on Khao San Road, Bangkok&apos;s famous backpacker district, the other night. I was just passing through, but quickly realized that this place warrants a full-scale photographic expedition, something I&apos;ll certainly do when I come back in May. After people watching for a while we stopped in at Brick Bar, a place where, oddly enough for Khao San Road, I was virtually the only white guy. We had come to see Teddy Ska, a Thai band that had been recommended. The band was really fun (what other band in Bangkok has a violin soloist and a horn section?), and really got the crowd going:

 Siam Paragon taken with the ultra-wide Nikon 10.5 f/2.8 DX. 

I&apos;ve always liked wide lenses, but with Nikon&apos;s less-than-full-frame digital factor of 1.5 means that most wide lenses are never quite wide enough. Until now. Stick this digital-only fisheye on the Nikon D200 and you&apos;ve yourself got the equivalent of a 16mm on a full-frame camera. I bought this lens mainly so I could do some insane-wide landscapes of Stockholm, but suspect it will provide endless hours of fun far into the future. After I get back to Bangkok I hope to obtain the DxO Optics Pro software to straighten out all those crazy lines. One can do the same thing in Photoshop, but apparently this program is quite sharp and easy to use. Anybody have any other software recs?

Detailed info and lots of example pics taken with this lens can be found here .

Last night was the opening for Surat Osathanugrah&apos;s exhibition Face - Hand - Back - Foot. Surat is a very wealthy and well-known Thai businessman, but he&apos;s also a talented photographer. Apparently he was more or less forced to take the family business, but always harboured ambitions to become a photographer. Now he&apos;s retired and has time to pursue his true passion.

 

The exhibition was held at Kathmandu, Bangkok&apos;s only 100% photography gallery, which is owned by Manit Sriwanichpoom, one of the country&apos;s most well-known artists. The gallery is located in a restored Chinese shophouse, and the downstairs showcases Manit&apos;s own work:

 

and the upper level is where the temporary exhibitions are held:

 

Incidentally, in about a year from now I&apos;m actually going to have my own exhibition at Kathmandu, but more on that later...

I&apos;m back in Stockholm, Sweden, one of my three &quot;hometowns&quot;. I lived here as a teenager and have been back and forth quite a few times over the years. Oddly enough, I actually have more friends here in Stockholm than in America, so it always feels great and somehow familiar to come back.

I wasn&apos;t particularly interested in food when I was living here, but one thing that left a strong impression was the very un-Swedish (yet very Swedish) kebab. This kind of food may seem common to most Europeans nowadays, but I&apos;d never come across the stuff growing up in Oregon, and at the time it seemed very exotic. My friends and I swore by Kebab Kungen (&quot;The Kebab King&quot;), a hole-in-the-wall (by Swedish standards, anyway) place in Södermalm that served what were the cheapest kebabs in town (I think they were 19 kronor back then?). I recall skipping gymansiet (the Swedish equivalent of high school) to come down there, fill up on kebab, then explore the city. Nostalgia and a desire for chippped beef brought me back to Götgatan, only to find that Kebab Kungen has been replaced by a shop selling sporting equipment for children or some other rubbish... I was forced to walk directly across the street to Jerusalem Kebab, Kebab Kungen&apos;s direct competitor, and a place I had seen countless times, but had never entered on strict moral grounds:

 

Like most (all?) kebab places in Stockholm, you can order beef or chicken kebab, in a pita or on a plate (with pommes frites), in addition to pitas or plates of felafel or deep-fried eggplant:

 

I&apos;ve always wanted to try the other dishes (does anybody ever order anything but kebab?), but haven&apos;t got around to it yet... My 25 kronor (125 baht, about 2 US dollars) got me a kebab i bröd with everything. The bulging pita (pictured above) was filled with a generous amount of salty, spiced chipped beef, which was covered with lettuce, red onions, bell pepper, yogurt and chili sauce, and my personal fav, pickled chilies. It&apos;s messy, but absoultely delicious, and by Stockholm standards, very cheap.

Incidentally, in trying to find the address for this place I came across a site called Allt om kebab (&quot;Everything about kebab&quot;), which looks to be a great reference for kebab fans in Stockholm, but which unfortunately appears to be down at the moment.

By the way, är det nån som vet vad hände med Kebab Kungen?

Ironically, Swedish food can sometimes be a bit difficult to find here in Stockholm. The fish-and-potatoes diet that most Swedes&apos; grandparents grew up with is seen as woefully old-fashioned compared to the more popular tapas, Mexican, sushi and Italian cuisines that are found on every street in the city. I think this is a pity as there really are some wonderful traditional dishes here. In particular I absolutely love the breads, from the cracker-like knäckebröd to the rye-laden limpor, and am fascinated by the variety of fish dishes; pickled herring, baked salmon, smoked eel, etc. Thus I was fortunate when upon exiting Slussen subway station on Södermalm I came across the stall pictured above that combined the two. Nystekt strömming means &quot;freshly fried herring&quot;, a traditional Swedish dish that at this stall is served both traditionally and with a modern touch.

After a long wait (I guess people do like this kind of food--why isn&apos;t there more?), I ordered a knäckis, which takes the form of a pizza slice-sized hunk of knäckebröd topped with two fillets of the fried herring, lightly pickled slices of cucumber, red onion and parsley:

 

This is the &quot;snack&quot; version and cost 27 kronor, but the herring is also available as a heartier plate along with mashed potatoes and a salad. For those who cannot break themselves away from American-style fast food, there is also a bizarre-sounding &quot;herring burger&quot;.

According to this site , the owners, Tommy and Viveka, have been selling nystekt strömming at Slussen since 1991. When asked if they ever get tired of fish they replied, &quot;No. If you work here you eat herring every day.&quot; Sounds good to me.

As in most other big European cities, the residents of Stockholm buy their groceries at modern supermarkets. However the city still supports a couple examples of old-school market halls, which I&apos;d like to feature on these pages. The first of these is Hötorgshallen, located in a basement below a large movie theatre smack in the middle of downtown Stockholm.

This being Scandinavia, you&apos;ll find quite a bit of seafood, including fresh:

 

 

preserved:

 

and ready to eat:

 

Other interesting looking local food is found at Saluplats 30 , a stall selling the prepared dishes and ingredients of Sweden&apos;s neighbour to the east, Finland:

 

The food here looked delicious, and quite similar to traditional Swedish food, and I definitely plan on buying a few things for a picnic in the future. In general however, Scandinavian food is not the emphasis at Hötorgshallen, but rather other cuisines, including Greek:

 

Middle-Eastern, including these amazing salads and mezze:

 

and most predominantly, Turkish. Other than a couple Turkish delis and the obligatory kebab stall, there were also two places selling &apos;Turkish burgers&apos;:

 

These took the form of buns filled with various Turkish condiments. I found this too interesting to resist, and ordered a vegetarian version:

 

It was stuffed with deep-fried eggplant, grilled cheese, a dolma, some salad, and then topped with two sauces of your choice. It was actually quite good, but got me wondering if such a thing is actually found in Turkey, or is a result of the Swedish desire to serve everything in burger form...?

For more info on Hötorgshallen (only in Swedish), go here .

click on the image Taking photos here in Stockholm is literally and figuratively a world apart from taking photos in Southeast Asia. There&apos;s very little life on the streets, and the paranoia people emit when they see my camera is almost palpable. This is not to mention the cold weather and the fact that when I&apos;m already familiar with a place I tend to have a difficult time seeing something new. Luckily there have been fleeting moments of sun and warm weather, and after the long, dark winter, people occasionally drop their guard and forget about the guy with the camera.

Such was the case yesterday in Kungsträdgården, a park in central Stockholm. The weather wasn&apos;t exactly warm (I overheard some Thai tourists complaining about how cold it was), but there were people out enjoying the sun, in particular a couple men playing street chess. I started out with this image:

 

The pic shows what was happening, but lacks dynamism. To make it a little more interesting, I moved to a different angle, closed in a bit, and tried to capture some of the movement of the game:

 

Not being entirely happy with this, I used the old trick of tilting the horizon:

 

and then cranked down the aperture to depict the movement:

 

which resulted in the best pic of the lot. I&apos;ll be the first to admit that this isn&apos;t much more than a mediocre image, but it is much more dynamic than the first, and I&apos;m happy that I&apos;m beginning to become more pragmatic about my photography. I also like the fact that I am slowly getting better at being able to pick out what I want to show, or what I don&apos;t want to show. Now if there was only more life here...

 Interesting shadows, Östermalm, Stockholm 

More wandering around central Stockholm has resulted in the pics posted here. Again, nothing terribly interesting (where are all the people ??), but it was a slightly more productive wander than previous days. I&apos;m still waiting for the nice weather to go out so I can take some boring postcard-type shots that I can sell as stock later. For now, I&apos;m free to pursue the kind of photography I love, but am finding it hard to be inspired in this environment...

In looking back at these, I find that many of these and many of my other photos are far too symetrical, and a bit too &apos;distant&apos;. I&apos;ve also really been thinking about something David Alan Harvey recently said on his blog , &quot;...to really make photographs that have the &quot;authorship&quot; of which i so often speak, the photographer must look inside....for it is impossible to be an author if one does not have anything to say....&quot; I&apos;ll admit that in most cases I&apos;m often simply observing, and don&apos;t necessarily have anything to say about Stockholm or the other places/things I shoot, which is probably my biggest obstacle...

I recently spent a lovely evening at the home of writer and food historian (and blogger ), Göran Lager:

 

Göran lives in Sollentuna, the same suburb of Stockholm that I lived in when I went to high school here more than 10 years ago. He and I orginally had plans to take dinner at Edsbacka Krog , possibly Sweden&apos;s best restaurant, also located in Sollentuna, but our appointment was moved to Thursday (more on that later). Instead, we went back to Göran&apos;s house where his wife Rodjana, a native of Thailand (and a former employee of Edsbacka Krog), made us a wonderful meal.

We started with a teriffic tom kha kai :

 

the famous coconut milk soup with chicken. I never order this dish in Thailand, but think that Rodjana&apos;s has inspired me to begin doing so! This was accompanied by a spicy som tam :

 

The image of which was actually taken by budding food photographer, and Lager&apos;s daugher, Plaifah:

 

And finally, an absolutely delicious muu thawt , deep-fried pork:

 

Which was made from pork shortribs from G. Nilsson Livs , Göran&apos;s favourite butcher in Hötorghallen. Rodjana marinated these in fish sauce and coriander seed, and liberally sprinkled with deep-fried crispy garlic.

Thai restaurants in Stockholm are very expensive, and by all accounts, mediocre. If you&apos;re here and want Thai food, my advice is to become friends with a Thai--preferably one who cooked at a two-star restaurant!

Found myself again in Södermalm, southern Stockholm, where just around the corner from Jerusalem Kebab you&apos;ll find a 99 year-old restaurant and Stockholm staple, Kvarnen . Friend and blogger Göran Lager invited me out here recently, and we had a great time, eating some excellent svensk husmanskost (traditional Swedish food) and chatting with the restaurant&apos;s chef and owner.

Göran suggested the havswallenbergare, a seafood take on a traditional Swedish meat dish (pictured above). Normally made from a patty of beef, this version was comprised of salmon and pike, and was served with mashed potatoes and peas and a hollandaise sauce. Although it was very simple it was very, very good.

Göran and I were almost equally impressed with the restaurant&apos;s excellent bread basket:

 &apos;&apos;

a reliable indicator of a good restaurant. The basket contained a variety of delicious and slightly unusual Swedish hårdbröd, which thankfully, was served with butter (most Swedes prefer margarine).

After dinner we chatted with the Kvarnen&apos;s chef, Mauritz Lind and the restaurant&apos;s owner, Thomas Steinwendr:

 

These are two guys who love talking about food (Mauritz worked at Edsbacka Krog as well as at a restaurant in Phuket for nearly a decade), and after we complimented their bread, Thomas brought us a few more that they&apos;re planning on including in the basket:

 Saluhallen, opened in 1888, is the largest and most famous of Stockholm&apos;s indoor markets. Located in Östermalm, traditionally the wealthiest part of town, you&apos;re not going to find any deals here, but the setting is amazing, and the products excellent.

 

This market is considerably more &quot;Swedish&quot; than Hötorgshallen, and inside you&apos;ll find more traditional Swedish staples such as potatoes:

 

herring to eat over them:

 

or even smoked eel:

 

Or maybe you&apos;d rather have your potatoes fried with ham, as in the traditional Swedish dish, pytt i panna:

 

If you crave Swedish food but can&apos;t be bothered to cook, there&apos;s also prepared food inside the hall:

 

as well as baked goods to take home:

 

If you don&apos;t mind doing a bit of cooking, pick up some sausages:

 

It&apos;s all there:

 

To reach Saluhallen, take the red line subway to Östermalmstorg station.

A couple weeks ago Göran Lager and I took lunch at KB, Konstnärs Baren (&quot;Artists&apos; Bar&quot;), a Stockholm institution. Located in a beautiful building from 1891 that also houses Stockholm&apos;s dramatic theatre, the restaurant is known excellent traditional Swedish fare and for its murals that cover the walls of the upstairs dining area:

 

But as you can guess, we were mostly interested in the former. The menu (shown in the first pic above) offers a short but very interesting array of traditional Swedish dishes based around indigenous ingredients such as shrimp, herring, salmon, dill and lingonberries. We began with gravade strömming:

 

marinated herring served on a slice of pumpernickel-like bread and boiled potatoes. Sounds like starch overload, but it really was wonderful, and thankfully, for me at least, the herring lacked the sweet taste found in most Swedish pickled fish. It was easily the best fish dish I had during my stay in Stockholm, and even the potatoes were delicious and perfectly cooked.

This was followed by raggmunkar, Swedish-style potato pancakes:

 

which were served with knaperstekt fläsk, bacon-like strips of ham, and a side of rårörda lingon, stewed lingonberries:

 

It was rustic, salty, oily, and hearty, and when topped with the lingonberries, sweet and a bit sour; basically everything I like in a dish. It also had the added benefit, according to Göran, of being an excellent hangover cure (I had been at a wedding the previous night...).

Here&apos;s Göran&apos;s take on the meal (unfortunately only in Swedish), which, as a bonus, includes a recipe for gravade strömming. Despite the utter simplicity of the dishes, this was easily one of the most memorable meals of my trip. I&apos;d encourage any of you who happen to be in Stockholm to stop by.

 At the beginning of the match I stood in &quot;knacken&quot;, the area reserved for the more hardcore AIK supporters.

But the point of going was to photograph fans, so after a while I moved down to ground level.

click on the image While in Stockholm I accompanied my friends to a couple soccer matches. My friends are big fans of AIK, one of three Stockholm teams in the Swedish league, and hold season tickets. One of their pre-game rituals, other than two warm beer to cool their nerves, involves dinner at a kebab restaurant near the stadium in Solna. Having consumed kebab earlier on my trip, I followed my friend Ola&apos;s lead and ordered the &quot;vegetable plate&quot;:

 

This took the form of various deep-fried veggies: eggplant, cauliflower, onions and falafel, served over a massive heap of saffron rice (or French fries), with sides of hummus and a yogurt sauce. The image above doesn&apos;t do a good job of illustrating the sheer vastness of the plate, and I was only able to eat about 75% of it. It was tasty, but incredibly salty, and at about $10, isn&apos;t exactly a &quot;deal&quot; for fast food, but that&apos;s Sweden.

Here&apos;s Ola devouring his:

 

He finished it.

During the game the only food option is korv, Swedish-style sausages:

 

a food I will soon document in detail at the Lonely Planet website.

click on the image One of the highlights of my trip to Sweden was a visit to the country&apos;s most acclaimed restaurant, the two-star Edsbacka Krog . Ironically, the restaurant is located a short walk away from where I lived as an exchange student in the town of Sollentuna, although I was blissfully unaware of it at the time (my culinary interests during the period focused mostly around kebab ). My dining companion, Göran Lager , who I&apos;ve mentioned here several times previously, is friends with the restaurant&apos;s well-known chef, Christer Lingström, and as I was also working on an article, we were treated very well.

We chose the avsmakningsmeny, the tasting menu, a eight-course extravaganza of taste that began with the following trio of Creamed parsnip with strawberry jelly, fish broth with basil foam, and asparagus soup with crispy pork:

 

Unusual combinations that worked together very well, as Göran&apos;s expression suggests:

 

The remaining seven courses included exotic ingredients such as pigeon and sea buckthorn, indigenous ingredients such as ramslök (kind of onion) and gooseberries, and challenging combinations such as marinated hälleflundra (type of fish) with a vanilla-lemon foam. I&apos;m planning on printing some of the photos later, so I&apos;d rather not run any here before they&apos;ve had a chance to run. It was an amazing experience, and by far the best food-wine pairing I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure to experience. Highly recommended--if you can afford it!

click on the image The EEgos are the hottest new band of the moment in Portland, Oregon. Due to the fact that their guitarist, Dave:

 

is one of my oldest friends, I was granted unprecedented access to photograph an invite-only show a few weeks ago.

It was extremely dark where they were playing, so I was forced to shoot at ISO 1600 and I illuminated the shots with my SB-800 held in my left hand. If you&apos;re not already aware, the D200&apos;s built-in flash can control the SB-800 wirelessly and without the use of an extra slave. I simply changed a few settings on the flash and camera, set the strobe to slow-sync (dialing it down one stop, if I remember correctly) and fired away. I really like this effect, which freezes certain elements of the frame, but also suggests motion and action. And the fact that the light is coming from an angle makes the lighting that much more attractive.

 

 

 

 

 

The backstage party, as you can imagine, was totally insane, and I had to use my connections to bail Dave and five underage groupies out from a local jail.

Joe&apos;s Donuts is a donut shop in my hometown of Sandy, Oregon. Apparently the place has quite a reputation , and has a keen a following among locals, foodies in the Portland area, as well as skiers on their way up to Mt Hood:

 

Ironically, despite having more or less grown up in Sandy, I had never been to Joe&apos;s Donuts. So one morning, with nothing to do and a hunger for American food, I decided to make the 10 minute walk over to the place. I ordered a double espresso, a blueberry fritter (I think that&apos;s what it was called) and my favorite, an old fashioned:

 

The donuts were pretty good, but I&apos;ve been out of the deep-fried dough loop so long I wouldn&apos;t know an exceptional one if it hit me on the head. I&apos;ve never even been to Krispy Kreme. And setting me even further apart from most Americans, I wasn&apos;t even able to finish my donuts, and ended up taking half home in a bag.

Regarding the coffee, I find a perverse pleasure in ordering espresso in the US; because most Americans drink incredibly complicated coffee creations that involve multiple-digit ingredients, my order of a simple espresso almost always elicits a bewildered response. Several times while in Oregon I was only charged for what is known as an &quot;extra shot&quot; and got a decent espresso for 50 cents!

My brother Garett lives outside Astoria, Oregon, a city located at the mouth of the Columbia River in the far northwest corner of the state. Astoria is an incredibly hilly town with lots of old buildings, and has served as the setting of such influential and groundbreaking films as The Goonies and Kindergarten Cop . Film history is not, however, one of my interests, and luckily Astoria also has some interesting restaurants.

In town for lunch one day we stopped by Clemente&apos;s, a seafood market and restaurant known for its fish and chips. Rather than plain old fish and chips, I went with the more exotic oyster and chips:

 

The coast of Washington, directly north of Astoria, is known for producing some of the finest oysters in the world, and I wanted to take advantage of this. Thankfully the restaurant treated them well, barely coating them in batter and deep-frying them so that the batter was crispy, but the oysters inside were more or less still raw, just like they should be.

Garett ordered albacore tuna with his chips, a fish that previously formed the basis of Astoria&apos;s fishing industry.

 

This being Oregon, the fish and chips were accompanied by a bottle of simply amazing beer, in this case the Dechutes Brewery&apos;s Black Butte Porter :

 

I chose this bottle because Deschutes makes what must be my favorite beer of all, the Mirror Pond Pale Ale . The porter, although not my favorite style of beer, was excellent , and went very well with oily deep-fried seafood.

And in case you&apos;ve already forgotten, there&apos;s some pretty good f&amp;c available in Bangkok here . My writeup can be found here .

One of the highlights of my visit to Oregon was the chance to finally visit the Portland Farmers&apos; Market . It is considered one of the premier farmers&apos; markets in the US, and features all the stuff I dream about while in Thailand: cheese, fresh herbs, wild mushrooms, wine, oysters and depending on the season, a huge variety of other produce.

 

I was there in May, very early summer, so understandably there wasn&apos;t a huge amount of stuff available. There were lots of cold-weather veggies, including carrots:

 

chard:

 

and some early strawberries:

 

And perhaps more unusually, fern shoots:

 

Mushrooms from the forests of Oregon looked particularly interesting:

 

There is also heaps of delicious-looking prepared food, including these pizzas:

 

baked in this mobile wood-burning oven:

 

Another stall tossed its pizza dough on site:

 

This stall selling Italian sausage sandwiches was particularly popular:

 

I was particularly interested in the breads and baked goods, including these amazing looking loaves from Ken&apos;s , currently considered one of Portland&apos;s best bakeries:

and baked sweets, such as tiny lemon tart:

 

There were also lots of happy customers:

Finally back to Asia...

I recently found myself in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. It&apos;s a small town with not a great deal to offer, but fortunately has what must be one of the most colorful and interesting fresh markets I&apos;ve ever visited. The market is located right on the waterfront, and gets started just before sunset:

 

The emphasis here is seafood, and the market had the biggest variety of fresh fish I&apos;ve ever seen anywhere:

 

In particular, there were several vendors selling a tuna-like fish that I&apos;ve never come across in mainland SE Asia:

 

as well as every other kind of fish you could imagine:

 

 

and the people who prepare them:

 

There were also several kids walking around clutching plastic bags, begging for fish scraps. This girl, one of them, was very interested in my camera:

 

Other interesting sea-related eats were several varieties of edible seaweed:

 

 

and conch shells with their meat sold separately in plastic bags:

 

There&apos;s also plenty of land-based food:

 

 

and a great deal of prepared food, including curry shops selling stuff such as these deep-fried soft shell crabs:

 

and drinks sold by flirtatious vendors:

 

I&apos;ll detail the interesting meal I had here in my next post.

Kota Kinabulu&apos;s evening market, besides having some great raw ingredients, also had some wonderful prepared food. In particular there was an entire section dedicated to grilled seafood. Choosing from shrimp, lobster, several kinds of fish and crabs, I had a grilled mackerel/tuna tail and a grilled squid:

 

These were accompanied by a spicy sambal, rice and various sides that were already laid out on the table:

 

The sides included hinava, a local raw fish dish, shredded green mangoes, and a couple seaweed &apos;salads,&apos; which is what I chose:

 

The seaweed was naturally salty and crunchy in texture, and was great with a squeeze of lime. An excellent meal, and best of all, the whole thing cost me about $3.

Every Saturday my neighborhood plays host to a gigantic talaat nat , or weekend market. I love this market and always look forward to it. Ironically, I always tend to forget that we also have a much smaller market every Tuesday afternoon. It&apos;s probably only 1/4 the size of the Saturday market, but there&apos;s still some interesting stuff, including fruit:

Not the best, but good when you need a northern Thai fix. Much better were the southern Thai hor mok yaang , grilled curries:

 

They&apos;re sold topped with crab meat, shrimp, fish or horseshoe crab eggs. A crab and a shrimp and a plate of rice formed my dinner.

I&apos;m off to Cambodia tomorrow for a week where I&apos;ll be working with Phil of Phenomenon on some articles. I won&apos;t be posting, but you can expect some follow up posts here after I get back.

He saw some potential in the pics I brought by, and in particular liked the following shots:

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also like these shots, so it&apos;s good to know Manit and I are on the same page. My only problem is that I don&apos;t really have a &quot;concept&quot; yet. I&apos;ve just been walking around shooting whatever looks interesting. Also, I&apos;ve been traveling so much lately that I haven&apos;t had time to go back and take more shots. Fortunately I have time--Kathmandu is booked up until the end of the year. So I get back from Cambodia, where I&apos;m going tomorrow, I&apos;m going make a point of going back to Chinatown on a regular basis and will to sure to share my progress here.

Mexican is a cuisine that one is pretty hard-pressed to find in Bangkok. Thus there was something of a buzz in Bangkok (OK, essentially an email from a friend) when a new taco shop opened off of Sukhumvit.

Compelled to investigate, I ordered three soft tacos (pictured above), which in the Mexican style, are served open-faced and topped with your choice of meat: chicken, seasoned ground beef, carnitas, carne asada and barbacoa beef. I went with carnitas and carne asada and found them both to be pretty good. The corn tortillas weren&apos;t bad either, but the entire taco package was brought down by shoddy toppings (shredded iceberg lettuce, tinned jalapeños and &quot;cheese&quot;) and a sweet, slightly artificial tasting salsa (&quot;John&apos;s Red Hot Salsa&quot;). Inexcusable really, considering that most the requisite taco ingredients, including some of those lacking at Sunshine (cilantro, lime, onions) are available fresh here in Bangkok.

Burritos and chips and salsa/guacamole are also available, as well as a couple plate dishes. Sunrise Tacos is a located a short walk from Asoke BTS station and is open 24 hours.

Iea Sae is the unpronounceable name of an old-skool Chinese-style coffee shop in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. There are quite a few cafes like this in southern Thailand, and heaps in Malaysia, but very, very few in Bangkok, which makes this place somewhat special.

 

If you&apos;re coming here for good coffee, you&apos;re going to be sorely disappointed, but if you get a buzz from atmosphere, it can be a fun place. The shop is 60 years old (a fact written on nearly every dish and cup in the restaurant) and is outfitted with antique tables, an old tile floor, and some interesting murals on the walls. These furnishings could be purchased just about anywhere, but the thing that makes Iea Sae interesting is its patrons. The old Chinese-Thai men who frequent the cafe order a single cup of coffee and spend the next three hours doing their best to drink it as slowly as possible while arguing about politics, discussing food, smoking, and in the true Chinese tradition, carrying on with lots of hawking and spitting.

 

As far as I can see, they just serve coffee (some food items are written on a chalkboard, but they never seem available), and in the Chinese-Thai style, a cup or glass is always followed by a chaser of weak Chinese tea:

Thanon Phat Sai (This street runs parallel to Thanon Yaowarat, Chinatown&apos;s main road, and is most easily reached via Thanon Phadung Dao. Iea Sae is located smack in the middle of the short street; simply look for lots of old men drinking coffee.)

After all these years in Thailand I&apos;ve still never really taken to the Thai breakfast. Jok , pureed rice soup, is about as delicious as the description sounds. Paa thong ko , deep-fried bits of dough typically dipped into crap coffee is a nightmare waiting to happen. And at home Thais generally tend to eat the previous night&apos;s leftovers with rice. So when traveling to other countries in SE Asia I always keep an eye open for interesting breakfasts, and invariably I&apos;m impressed: crispy roti and sweet teh tarik in Malaysia and Singapore; a steaming bowl of mohinga (a fish-based noodle soup) in Myanmar; and in Cambodia, rice and pork.

Known in Khmer as bai sach chrouk (literally &quot;rice pork&quot;), this dish is more or less as simple as the name sounds, but is much more delicious. There are two divergent schools of bai sach chrouk. Proper restaurants, invariably Chinese in origin, tend to deep fry their pork and serve it with sides of a porky broth and a sauce similar to a sweet Vietnamese dipping sauce (illustrated above). Preferable, in my opinion at least, are the more &quot;Cambodian&quot; places where after being marinated in soy sauce and palm sugar (and apparently sometimes garlic and coconut milk), the thin slices of pork are grilled over coals:

 

The result is sweeter and smokier than the deep-fried version. This kind of bai sach chrouk tends also to be served with a small dish of lightly pickled veggies, and is generally served outdoors, at makeshift stalls.

Regardless of the ethnicity of the vendor, all bai sach chrouk is served topped with heaps of chopped green onion, and is served over broken rice that, if you&apos;re lucky, has been cooked in broth, as shown in this pic:

 

For a more detailed take on the dish, proceed to Phnomenon .

Much like Mexican , authentic northern-style Thai food can be very, very hard to find in Bangkok. A few mediocre dishes are sold at my neighborhood&apos;s Tuesday market , and good khao soi is available if you&apos;re willing to make the trek out to Viphavadee in northern Bangkok, but in general you&apos;re hard pressed to find a tasty kaeng hangle or a pleasant kaeng ho . This is a pity, as when done well, northern Thai food can be among the best in the country. It is markedly more seasonal than other Thai cuisines, featuring the odd mushroom, green or fruit that is only available at certain times of the year, makes great use of a wide variety of indigenous veggies, and is porky, porky and porky. Which, I am told, is a good thing.

So thanks to the keen nose of my food friend Aong, I was recently directed towards Maan Mueng, a restaurant in Bangkok specializing in the dishes of the north. Maan Mueng features a huge array of authenticly prepared dishes:

 

so even those who can&apos;t speak Thai or aren&apos;t familiar with northern Thai food can simply point to whatever looks good. And damn, does it look good. Witness:

 Nam phrik khaa :

 

A nam phrik or &quot;dip&quot; of chilies and galangal that is typically served with steamed mushrooms (now is mushroom season up north) and beef that is boiled before being steamed over fresh herbs. Thanks to the copious galangal, known in Thai as khaa , this nam phrik has a truly unique flavour, and the beef was, unlike most Thai beef, tender and very edible.

 Tam khanun :

 

This is a thick &quot;mash&quot; of young jackfruit and a chili paste topped with crispy fried garlic. Simple but delicious.

 Sai ua :

 

The famous northern-style sausage that is loaded with heaps of fresh herbs (lime leaf, lemongrass, garlic, etc.) and grilled. Spot on.

 Nam phrik num :

 

Another &quot;dip&quot;, this time of grilled chilies mashed up with grilled garlic, shallots and fish sauce, and served with pork rinds and fresh and par-boiled veggies for dipping.

 Laap khua :

 

This is laap that has been fried with a chili paste mixture that includes the herb makhwaen , which provides the dish a distinct bitter/hot flavour. The meat includes lots of offal (the heart fans out there will love laap khua), and includes the ubiquitous but delicious crispy garlic topping.

 Naem :

 

Raw pork that has been buried for three days until sour. Much better than it sounds.

Here&apos;s the spread:

 

Note the pile of greens on the left-hand side; Maan Mueng features an entire table stacked with fresh herbs and greens for its customers. And dishes are accompanied by perfectly-steamed red sticky rice.

Our meal ended with coconut ice cream:

 

a dish available just about anywhere in Thailand, but I&apos;m sure this is among the best I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure to enjoy. The ice cream was incredibly creamy and light in texture, and was suggestive of the soft meat of young coconuts rather than the cloying coconut milk that is typically used.

Maan Mueng is located quite far from the center of Bangkok, but is in all regards considerably easier than going to Chiang Mai or Mae Hong Son.

 Ahaan isaan , northeastern Thai-style food, is available virtually everywhere in Bangkok. In fact, I&apos;ll bet there&apos;s more isaan food in Bangkok than in isaan! The vast majority of this food is cheap and informal, and is sold primarily to homesick working class immigrants. However, there is also a great deal of isaan food that is directed towards middle class Bangkok diners. Although this kind of food may not always be as &quot;authentic,&quot; it&apos;s often much cleaner and more accessible.

Foon Talop, a wildly popular restaurant located in the Chatuchak Weekend Market is an example of the latter. The restaurant is as interesting in terms of its atmosphere as its food, with diners seemingly stuffed into every tight corner and waiters and som tam pounders screaming orders at each other:

 

Since it is isaan, of course you&apos;ve got to order som tam :

 

which, although it&apos;s made en masse in two gigantic mortar and pestles, is quite decent. We ordered som tam thai , som tam with bottled fish sauce, peanuts and dried shrimp. As with every restaurant serving this dish, it is made to order, and I ordered mine &quot; phet priaow ,&quot; spicy and sour.

Another isaan standby is nam tok muu :

 

This is strips of grilled pork made into a &quot;salad&quot; along with roasted sticky rice, lime, fish sauce, mint leaves and shallots. Nam tok literally means &quot;waterfall,&quot; and refers to the fact that traditionally the drippings of the grilled meat are collected and added to the dish. I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s the case here though.

These dishes are good, but I like Foon Talop for its slightly more unusual items, such as plaa som (pictured at the top of this post), a freshwater fish that has been stuffed with sticky rice and allowed to sour. The fish is then battered and deep-fried and served with heaps of crispy fried garlic. Absolutely delicious, except for the tiny bones that are almost impossible to avoid.

Another interesting dish is kuay jap yuan , literally, &quot;Vietnamese noodle soup&quot;:

 

A delicious pork broth containing thick round rice noodles, chunks of the Vietnamese sausage known in Thai as muu yor , strips of chicken, and topped with crispy fried shallots. Simple but good.

On the surface, Mae Sot is one of the least likely food destinations in Thailand. However those in search of something unusual will certainly be rewarded, as because of its location near the border with Myanmar (Burma), Mae Sot is in many ways more Burmese than Thai. This has led to a variety of dishes and ingredients that are rarely seen elsewhere in Thailand. This is especially evident in the town&apos;s morning market (pictured above), where I began my day with a breakfast of mohinga :

 

the famous Burmese noodle soup, which in Mae Sot is sold from several basic restaurants near the market:

 

The mohinga was OK, not nearly as good as some I&apos;ve had in Yangon, but considering this is one of the few places in Thailand where one can get the dish, I was happy. The strips you see in the top of the soup are yuak kluay , the inner pity stem of the banana tree, an essential ingredient in mohinga. Upon ordering the dish, the vendor also crumbles a deep-fried lentil cracker into the soup.

Other interesting things to eat at the morning market included this delicious Burmese sugar cane sweet:

 

another rarity in Thailand, samosas:

 

and fresh eels:

 

There were also some interesting things to see, such as the Burmese shoppers and shopkeepers themselves:

 

 

After exploring the market, we stopped by Wat Chumphon Khiri where we had a snack of lephet thoke :

 

the Burmese dish of pickled tea leaves mixed with deep-fried nuts, tomatoes, shredded cabbage, lime juice, sesame oil and garlic. There were lots of other Burmese dishes for sale at the grounds of this temple.

Lunch was another dish of probable Burmese origin, khao soi :

 

Made here by Muslims, an ethnic group that is quite evident in Mae Sot. The khao soi was average; undoubtedly better is hkauk hswe, the Burmese predecessor to khao soi that is sold at the same shops that sell mohinga.

So if you&apos;re looking for an exotic market and even more exotic food, I&apos;d highly recommend Mae Sot.

There are many dishes of Chinese origin in Thailand, as well as a great deal of food using Chinese ingredients, but Chinese food as the Chinese eat it in China is quite rare. Thus my ears perked up when my trusty partner in food, Aong, mentioned that she knew a good Yunanaese restaurant.

In reality, Kuaytiao Naam Ngiaow is something of a hodge-podge of Chinese cuisines, ranging from Taiwanese to Szechuanese, but the most interesting dishes are those of Yunanese origin. The owner comes from the Yunanese community of Doi Mae Salong in remote Chiang Rai Province, a town known for the noodle dish that serves as the restaurant&apos;s namesake. Like the food, the restaurant&apos;s clientèle was authentically Chinese, and the menu items were written on the wall in Chinese characters.

Before we even had a chance to sit Aong had already ordered mii phat , fried noodles:

 

This was the first dish that arrived, and upon tasting it, I knew that this restaurant was going to be special. The noodles had a deliciously smoky wok hei and lacked the oiliness of lesser fried noodle dishes.

I like green things that are fried with salty things so I ordered a dish of yot thua lantao , pea greens, fried with oyster sauce:

 

The greens were fried the way the Chinese do so well; cooked but not soggy or wilted. Tons of garlic and dried chilies didn&apos;t hurt either. At this point, things were going very well.

Things got even better when we received my favourite dish of the meal: Szechuan-style tofu:

 

A variant of this dish, tao huu son khrueng , is quite popular in Thailand, but doesn&apos;t come close to this version, which was strong with the numbing/hot flavour of Szechuan pepper.

And last but not least, we ordered nuea phae naam daeng , goat in red sauce:

 

A stew-like concoction served over a layer of steamed bok choy. I liked this one a lot as it reminded me of a very similar oxtail dish I had once eaten in Macau. The broth was thick and tasty, and loaded with red wolfberries, which a Chinese chemist once told me are good for the eyes.

Well done, Aong.

click on the image Along with having one of the longest restaurant names in Bangkok, Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao must also serve some of the city&apos;s best Chinese food. The restaurant is one of a Singapore-based franchise that has branches all over Asia. Bangkok&apos;s branch opened about a year ago, and always seems to be packed during lunch time. It was my turn to impress Aong with my restaurant choice prowess, and I thought this place, with its excellent and authentic Chinese noodles, would do the trick.

We began with Shredded celery with dried beancurd and sesame oil:

 

The dish was served chilled, and was flavoured with little more than sesame oil and perhaps a drop or two of soy sauce. The celery and carrot carried this subtle flavour, and also provided the dish with a deliciously crunchy element.

But this was just a starter, and the real reason people come here is for la mian, fresh, hand-pulled noodles:

 

We split a huge bowl of Hot and spicy &apos;La Mian&apos; with Sichuan preserved vegetable and minced pork. The noodles come to the table coated with a layer of oily broth redolent of Szechuan pepper and cumin:

 

Immediately after receiving your bowl, you&apos;ll be approached by an employee wielding a pair of kitchen shears who will ask if you want your noodles cut. I would recommend this, as the noodles are very long, and otherwise you&apos;ll end up getting most of the oily broth on your shirt. The noodles, no doubt made minutes earlier (you can see the noodle pullers at work behind the counter) taste fresh and soft, and are surprisingly light. The broth is spicy, sour (from the pickled veggies) and salty.

These were followed by the restaurant&apos;s other namesake, Xiao long bao, steamed, broth-filled pork dumplings:

 

which Aong and I agreed were average at best. The wrappers were thin and tore easily, making it a messy and difficult dish to eat, and the pork filling seemed disproportionately large.

The only possible complaint I have would be that much of this is cold weather food, and this being Bangkok, it wouldn&apos;t hurt the restaurant to turn up the air conditioning a few notches just for atmosphere!

Chiang Kii, a old-school restaurant located in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, is known for serving Bangkok&apos;s most expensive khao tom plaa , rice and fish soup. A 250 baht (about $8) bowl (pictured above) includes heaps of very fresh fish (I believe it&apos;s pomfret), tiny cubes of sweet/salty pork, dried shrimp, preserved white radish, dried galangal, a pinch of bitter greens, strips of dried tofu, and a garnish of deep-fried garlic; a simple dish, based on simple, but high-quality ingredients.

Each bowl is prepared by an elderly couple:

 

who tend to speak Chinese to each other (and, incidentally, Thai with a strong accent). Considering the cost of their product, they take their work very seriously, and each order involves a fair bit of consultation and discussion, with some customers ordering variations such as less rice or more fish (I asked for oysters). It took the man several minutes of concentrated work to turn out my bowl, which was served with a tiny bowl of tao jiao , fermented soybeans, the obligatory condiment.

The broth itself was inobtrusive, and required the saltiness a few spoons of tao jiao would supply. The fish was both copious and incredibly fresh, the reason, I suspect, for the dish&apos;s high price tag. As a whole the khao tom was very good, but I have a feeling that if it weren&apos;t for the essentially unrelated factors of atmosphere and the whole &apos;ceremony&apos; associated with preparing the dish, I might feel slightly ripped off. As it is though, I&apos;ll certainly be back come pay day.

Previously when I thought of phalo , the first thing that came to mind was a soupy Chinese dish combining fatty pork and a boiled egg with a sweet cinnamon and anise-flavoured broth. It took the help of a friend and a trip the other side of the Chao Phraya River to realize that, when done well, this can be one of the better Chinese-Thai dishes out there.

The friend was Cherry, the same person who introduced me to one of the Bangkok-area&apos;s most famous satay vendors , and the place was again Thaa Din Daeng on the Thonburi side of the river. There we stopped by Chua Jiab Nguan, a 70 year-old restaurant known for its haan phalo , goose cooked in a spiced Chinese-style broth:

 

The dish is simply thin slices of goose breast served in a liberally spiced (but not spicy) broth. The goose (a notoriously difficult bird to cook) was tender, and the broth salty and spicy, and lacked the sweetness and cinnamon-flavour that I previously associated with the dish.

We also ordered another dish consisting entirely of goose intestines and goose blood:

 

Both were surprisingly edible, although by nature they lacked flavour; all the taste came from the broth.

Here&apos;s our spread:

 

The phalo was served with rice and bowls of broth, one containing bitter gourd and another with a preserved Chinese vegetable. The dishes were also accompanied by an extra bowl of the nearly black broth and a delicious dipping sauce of vinegar, crushed chilies and copious garlic.

 

After finishing the goose, Cherry (above) couldn&apos;t resist, and also ordered a dish of hoy jor , tofu skins filled with a crab and ground pork mixture and deep-fried:

 

These appeared to have more crab than pork, which is rare, and were among the best I&apos;ve had.

click on the image Ayuthaya is only a one hour drive from Bangkok, but in terms of atmosphere, feels a world away. Besides the famous ruins, the city also has some great restaurants and fun bars, and is a best-kept-secret weekend getaway destination for those tired of the big city. I wanted to introduce some friends to this side of Ayuthaya, and on a Friday afternoon we boarded the bus for a night of eating and drinking. I wasn&apos;t sure exactly where to eat, and asked my trusty food sidekick Aong for help. She sent me an email with several recommendations, but reckoned her favourite was a place called Baan Wacharachai.

We cycled to the restaurant, located on the river behind beautiful Wat Kasatrathirat, and upon arriving I gave Aong a call and asked her what to order. Without hesitation, she listed several dishes I had to order, including the grilled snakehead fish:

 

Which, upon ordering, the waiter asked me, &quot;Have you ever had this before?&quot; Smoked is probably a more accurate way to describe the fish, and it had such a wonderful smoky flavour that I felt guilty using the three (!) delicious dipping sauces provided.

I was also told to order tom khlong plaa salit bai makhaam on :

 

A sour soup with salit fish and young tamarind leaves. Upon ordering this the waiter asked again, &quot;Have you ever had this? It&apos;s really sour!&quot; It was indeed sour, but we like this, and enjoyed the soup very much.

And finally she insisted we order y am thua phlu , wing bean salad:

 

Again, very tasty and well done. Thank you, Aong.

Left to our own devices Carla ordered yam plaa duk foo , crispy catfish salad:

 

If you&apos;re not famililar with this dish, it&apos;s made from grilled catfish flesh that has been deep-fried until crispy (Pim&apos;s description of this unique process, and a recipe can be found here and here ). The &quot;fluffy&quot; fish is is then served topped with peanuts and yam mamuang , a sweet/sour green mango salad. Good, but I found the mango topping a bit too sweet, as if often is.

Ron ordered phat phak boong fai daeng :

 

Flash-fried morning glory. Mad garlic. Delicious.

Baan Wacharachai is located on a handsome stretch of the Chao Phraya, and other than the lovely house and garden, also includes a moored boat upon which one can dine. Unfortunately in my hunger and haste, I neglected to take any photos. Next time.

I must be the luckiest food blogger in Bangkok. Hardly a day has passed lately when I&apos;m not invited to try a friend&apos;s favourite restaurant. Now it seems that word of RealThai is spreading among the relatives of my friends, which has led to even more discoveries. Most recently I was taken to a new restaurant by Apple and Ae, the older brother and wife of my friend Cherry. They are fans of a Muslim restaurant near their home in Bang Khae that they thought I might be interested in, and on quiet Sunday we all drove out there.

The restaurant sports the inspirational name, Islamic Food Center ( soon ahaan isalaam ), and is not so much a kitchen, but rather a gathering place for several different vendors who each specialize in a specific dish. As a result, the food here is of quite high quality, and pretty much runs the gamut of Thai-Muslim eats. Of course there was khao mok kai , chicken biryani:

 

the stuffed &apos;pancake&apos; known in Thailand as mataba :

 

and the salad Thais call salat khaek , &apos;Indian salad&apos;:

 

For those not familiar with this dish, the dressing, served as a side in the pink bowl, is a sweetish peanut sauce nearly identical to the one served with satay. I usually find it too sweet, but liked this version. The yellow strips are, I believe, deep-fried tofu.

This being Muslim food there were lots of meaty things, such as nuea daet diao thord :

 

Semi-dried and marinated (?) beef that was deep-fried. Nobody else seemed to like this very much, but I found it delicious, especially with the crispy garlic topping.

Chicken satay:

 

and one of my personal faves, oxtail soup:

 

Phii Ae ordered kuaytiao kaeng , curry-noodle soup:

 

Forgot to ask her how it was, but it certainly looked good.

And for dessert Cherry couldn&apos;t resist ordering a dish of rotii waan :

 

Roti sprinkled with sugar and sweetened condensed milk before being chopped up and mixed. We were initially surprised by this presentation, but in the end agreed it was much better.

I&apos;m currently in the process doing research for the next edition of Lonely Planet&apos;s Bangkok guide. This involves, and I&apos;m serious here, visiting and eating at lots and lots of restaurants. It&apos;s refreshing to finally get paid for doing this, and as expected, I&apos;m taking the job very seriously. For this morning&apos;s research I made a point of stopping by Naaz, a Muslim restaurant that, in the words of the current edition, serves &quot;...some of the city&apos;s richest khao mok kai (chicken biryani).&quot; Upon reading this I immediately felt provoked and defensive, as I live nearly next door to what I consider one of Bangkok&apos;s best Muslim restaurants, the self-proclaimed King of Biryani, Yusup .

Upon arriving at Naaz I diverged a bit and ordered khao mok phae , goat biryani. Even before tasting it was clear that the guide doesn&apos;t lie. The rice was absolutely perfectly cooked (overcooked rice is a common theme of lesser biryanis) and was topped with slightly sweet golden grapes, halved cashews and deep-fried crispy shallots. The fragrant yellow mound concealed a joint of goat with meat so tender it could probably be consumed by an infant. The meat was also coated in a rich curry-like sauce that had soaked into some of the rice. The dish was so perfect I didn&apos;t even use the (overly sweet) sauce provided.

Yusup, you&apos;ve got competition.

Here&apos;s the interior of Naaz, as well as the diverse and interesting menu:

 

I had other places to visit, so I unfortunately I couldn&apos;t try anything else, but I&apos;d certainly be curious to visit on Thursday when apparently they serve something called Karai Ghost.

Do go here.

The name of this restaurant literally means Yong Her Soy Milk Shop. Clever, isn&apos;t it? But soy milk is available just about everywhere in Bangkok, and clever restaurant names abound. The real reason you should come here is to try authentic northern Chinese food, a relative rarity here in Bangkok. The menu spans all the doughy, starchy foods loved by the residents of China&apos;s cold north, as well as some interesting salads, pickles, soups and oh yeah, soy milk (pictured above).

I asked the Chinese waitress what she recommended and she pointed to a menu item described in English as &quot;Small steamed dumpling.&quot; Despite the vague name, I trusted her, and what came to my table was actually a huge tray of xiao long bao , the Shanghainese broth-filled steamed dumplings:

 

I found these to be much, much better than those I had previously at Crystal Jade . The skins were just strong enough to support the hot broth without being too thick, and the pork filling was soft, tasty and not overwhelming.

Unfortunately I was on my own and didn&apos;t get a chance to try much else, but I really enjoyed the dumplings, and the other diners&apos; meals looked great as well, so you can expect to hear more from me about this place.

Japanese food is big in Bangkok. Restaurants serving Japanese food can be found just about everywhere, and &apos;sushi&apos; is even sold at my neighborhood&apos;s Saturday market . Despite this, I generally don&apos;t get too excited about eating Japanese here. The vast majority of Japanese restaurants take the form of characterless corporate chain-type places such as Zen, or the gorge-yourself-to-get-your-500-baht-worth buffets such as Oishi. There are also many privately-owned authentic eateries, particularly in the areas of Sukhumvit around the Emporium shopping center and Thong Lor, but these are quite far from my house. And yet another form of Japanese restaurant in Bangkok is the small informal Thai-owned and run place that put out a few standard dishes. Such is the case with Kinkoku, a tiny streetside Japanese restaurant/cafe at the Chatujak Weekend Market.

I and my friend Nick, doing research on an article about eats at Chatujak, sat down directly in front of one of those fans that blows cool misty air and started with yakisoba:

 

which was, well, yakisoba. Despite this, I think I enjoyed this dish the most, and the noodles were reasonably tasty and graciously un-oily. The dish contained tasty bits of browned chicken, and I liked the white cabbage (maybe because Thais rarely eat it?), especially when dipped in the salty soy sauce provided.

We asked the waitress what she recommended and she suggested the grilled mackerel with soy sauce:

 

I find this type of mackerel, known in Thai (via Japanese) as saba, to be almost assertively fishy and oily in flavour. Maybe I&apos;ve just never had a really fresh one? This one was no different, although the sweet-tasting soy sauce almost concealed the fishiness. This dish was served with a bowl of Japanese rice and miso soup.

And finally we had grilled mushrooms:

 

For some reason they used the virtually flavourless straw mushrooms, het faang , as opposed to the more delicious (and infinitely more Japanese, not to mention appropriate for grilling) shiitake, het hom .

All in all a decent eat, and a fun break from the ubiquitous som tam and southern food of Chatujak, but certainly not worth a detour.

And on a non food-related tip, that morning I also got some pretty cool candid shots of vendors and shoppers that I&apos;ve posted in black and white at my photo blog, The Old Main Drag .

Today I found myself at the food court of Carrefour Rama IV. As with most food courts, there&apos;s a lot to eat there: Muslim food, yen ta fo noodles, Thai-Chinese eats, l aad naa , curries and much, much more. All in all, it&apos;s a pretty average Bangkok food court, albeit on a slightly grander scale. However despite all these choices, I can never resist one particular dish when I see it. I&apos;m a huge fan of veggies, and this dish has heaps. I also love fish and spicy stuff, and they&apos;re both there as well. And I don&apos;t like being locked into one single taste or flavour, and this dish has lots of variety.

The dish is naam phrik kapi , a &apos;dip&apos; of shrimp paste mashed up with garlic, sugar, chilies and lime juice. The dip is served with rice, fresh vegetables, including green beans, wing beans and eggplants, par-boiled veggies, including cabbage, buap (a type of gourd), pumpkin, Chinese greens, and deep-fried battered eggplant, an omelet laced with cha om (a pungent herblike green), and perhaps most importantly, an entire battered and deep-fried mackerel.

Nam phrik kapi is a very Thai dish that tends to be served at people&apos;s homes, rather than at restaurants. It&apos;s also a dish that I don&apos;t see too many foreigners eating. If you happen to be at a food court and see something that looks like the above, do try it. You might find the naam phrik spicy, but you can always just take a bit less. If you don&apos;t happen to have a Thai food court at hand, recipes for naam phrik kapi can be found here and here .

I spent the last three days in the resort town of Pattaya with my former students, the Satit Kaset IP Class of 2006. At 19 and 20 they&apos;re pretty much adults now, which seems strange to me as I first met most of them when they were in 6th grade! Apparently I had a good influence on them, as a few of them are now totally camera obsessed, and based on the meals we had, they generally seem to have pretty good taste in restaurants.

I&apos;ll be blogging on a couple of the places we ate at, but will start with our first meal, and the primary reason Thai people visit such places: seafood. Varawit led us to Tankay Restaurant, an open-air seafood joint located smack dab in the middle of Walking Street, Pattaya&apos;s sleazy go go bar area, an area he&apos;s apparently intimately familiar with.

There we consumed plaa meuk khai :

 

Grilled squid, including its eggs. I always like grilled squid, but don&apos;t really care for the eggs, which honestly have little if any flavour, and a spongy texture.

 Plaa kraphong neung sii ew , fish steamed in soy sauce:

 

which included heaps of shredded green onion and ginger in a pleasantly salty broth. Very nice, apparently, as Chanon appeared to eat virtually every last fish molecule:

 

Somebody ordered thord man koong , deep-fried shrimp cakes:

 

and steamed crab legs:

 

and perhaps as a result of feeling a bit too carnivorous, I also decided to order some greens:

 

flash-fried morning glory, which was done exceptionally well here.

The meal was accompanied with three huge plates of crab fried rice (first pic above), the usual carb accompaniment to Thai seafood feasts.

 

All in all a very good Thai seafood meal, although considering the area, I imagine the atmosphere might be quite different at night!

Immediately after eating copious amounts of seafood at Tankay, we obviously required dessert. This turned out to be a no-brainer, as just across the street from the restaurant were two interesting looking gelato bars. Peach, Leew and I decided to try the one called Time Out, while all the others went into Italia, mostly because Mr. Noo described it as having a more &quot;milky&quot; smell.

Here&apos;s Peach and Leew choosing their flavours at Time Out, a process that involved considerable time and tasting:

 

I had rum raisin, as always, and found it more than acceptable. I&apos;m pretty sure the girls enjoyed theirs.

And back at Italia, Pongston also appeared to enjoy his decision:

 

I wish there was more of this kind of ice cream in Bangkok...

I had eaten at this modest isaan restaurant on my only previous visit to Pattaya several years back. The place is well known, and the memory of the som tam thai I had back still lives strong: crispy, chilled strips of green papaya gently coaxed with tart lime and barely smashed tiny cloves of garlic... I always wondered if the place was still around, and was excited when, arriving at the grilled chicken restaurant Songdet recommended, realized it was the very same place. I told you these guys have good taste in food.

This place is all about the som tam, in particular, the som tam thai :

 

which is som tam made with bottled fish sauce, and topped with peanuts and dried shrimp. It was every bit as good as I remembered; the papaya crispy, and the dish sporting an assertively tart flavour.

As a counterpoint to this central Thai dish, someone ordered the very northeastern version, tam sua , isaan-style som tam with khanom jeen noodles:

 

complete with the northeastern-style unpasteurized fish sauce known as plaa raa and pickled field crabs, I was surprised these Bangkok kids could eat stuff like this.

There were isaan staples such as laap muu , pork laap:

 

 tap waan , &apos;sweet liver&apos;:

 

 three dishes of khor muu yaang , grilled pork collar:

 

and an entirely too sweet wing bean salad:

 
 
And of course, the main reason Songdet took us here, the grilled chicken:

 

which according to him, is marinaded in honey.

And finally Peach, for some strange reason, decided to order som tam khao phot , corn som tam:

 

a bizarre mixture of corn and carrot. She said wasn&apos;t very nice. It didn&apos;t look very nice. Everything else was wonderful though.

I had first read about Foo Mui Kee in a review in the Bangkok Post several years back. I forgot to make note of where the restaurant was, and after a while, forgot about it entirely. On a recent day I was only a block away from the English language library I visit frequently when I stumbled upon the restaurant. Upon entering and sitting down at one of the old-school wooden booths, I noticed that on every table sat a bottle of not fish sauce, but rather Worcestershire sauce:

 

and was reminded that Foo Mui Kee is known for its Chinese takes on English/Continental dishes. The menu confirmed this, with dishes such as pork chop, oxtail soup, and beef fillet salad. I decided on one of the recommended dishes, ox-tongue stew:

 

The ox-tongue, cooked in a tomato-based gravy, was tasty and very tender, and was coupled with potatoes, tinned peas and a plate of rice. The dish reminded me of a meal a Chinese cook would have made his English employers in Hong Kong back in 1942. It was not particularly inspiring, but good, and I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and touches such as the complimentary chilled towel to wipe up after the meal. The women working there told me the restaurant was 80 years old, and I found it fun to take part in something that&apos;s been around for so long. I&apos;ll certainly be back.

I spent last weekend in Ayuthaya with a group of friends. As mentioned previously , the quiet town is a wonderful place to escape big city life, and features great restaurants, (relatively) cool weather and lots of stuff to do. After arriving, we asked the staff of our guest house to suggest a good place to eat, and they suggested a place called Bann Kun Pra .

The hotel/restaurant is located in a beautiful antique building directly on the river, and has creative menu. Unfortunately, as the stereotype goes, the places with the best locations/view often have mediocre food, and this was definitely the case with Bann Kun Pra. The first warning sign should have been the fact that the restaurant serves its rice in cute animal shapes:

 

After beheading our turtles, we dug into the dishes we ordered, which included asparagus stir-fried with prawns:

 

It was decent, although like most of the meal, bland and characterless.

A soup of cucumbers stuffed with ground-pork:

 

was, in my opinion, probably the nicest dish of the meal. The cucumber added a pleasantly sweet flavour to the broth, and the pork filling was peppery and tasty.

The sesame grilled chicken:

 

was, despite appearances, slightly spicy and not bad, although very dry.

Possibly the biggest disappointment was the grilled beef and mangosteen salad:

 

The dish sounded interesting on the menu, but the beef appeared to have been par-boiled, and other than a nearly tasteless coconut milk dressing, the dish had little flavour.

Carla ordered rice fried with curry powder:

 

and Ron can apparently not go an entire meal without ordering flash-fried morning glory:

 

Which is OK, as I&apos;m the same way. Unfortunately Bann Kun Pra&apos;s take on the dish was bland and unnecessarily included ground pork.

 

Again, I imagine Bann Kun Pra is a lovely (although slightly overpriced) place to stay, but not a very good destination for authentic Thai food.

While in Ayuthaya we made a point of taking our friends to Baan Wacharachai, the restaurant we visited on our last trip . This place combines a wonderful atmosphere right on the river, outstanding Thai food, great service, and by Western standards, is very cheap--just about the perfect restaurant, I reckon!

We started with kapi khua , a &apos;dip&apos; of shrimp paste sauteed with herbs and coconut milk:

 

The dish had a strong flavour of smoked fish and was pretty spicy--not something I thought everybody would like, but most people seemed to enjoy it.

There was a &apos;salad&apos; of thin slices of grilled pork collar:

 

The pork was topped with a spicy/sour sauce similar to the Thai seafood dipping sauce, and was served with sides of tiny (but strong) cloves of garlic, slices of cucumber and tomato and garnished with mint. Delicious.

Tony ordered tom khaa :

 

the coconut milk and galangal soup that is usually made with chicken, but done here with large prawns.

Sophie ordered mixed veggies sauteed in oyster sauce:

 

I ordered kaeng liang:

 

and somebody ordered chu chi plaa nuea orn :

 

freshwater fish fried with curry paste. The curry sauce was tasty, but usually the fish is deep fried beforehand to make it crispy. Here fresh fish was used and Tony and I didn&apos;t much care for the texture.

There were a couple reruns from last time, including the spot-on yam thua phlu , wing bean salad:

 

and the sublime plaa chon phao , grilled/smoked snakehead fish:

 

served, as always, with three delicious dipping sauces. We ordered two of these, and hardly anything was left...

After all this time, I think I&apos;ve begun to develop something of a sixth sense for finding good restaurants in Bangkok. It&apos;s reached the point where after a quick glance, I can usually tell if a place is worth entering. Take today&apos;s restaurant, Rosdee. Walking by one day, I think it was the cool swan logo (shown above) that initially caught my attention, but upon entering, the restaurant&apos;s uniformed and bow-tied waiters, geriatric Chinese-Thai customers and old-school atmosphere left no doubt in my mind that this meal was going to be good.

There was or suan :

 

Oysters fried with egg and a sticky batter. At lesser restaurants this dish is like a tasteless, gelatinous blob. Here it was rich with garlic and barely-cooked egg, not to mention fresh, plump oysters. The batter served to hold the ingredients together, rather than dominate. Excellent.

On a previous visit I had crispy pork served over rice:

 

The pork was perilously crispy, but tasty nonetheless. I was somewhat disappointed not to see the spicy/sour dipping sauce that usually accompanies this dish, but the side of pickled ginger was an interesting substitute.

I particularly enjoyed fish fried with black pepper:

 

The fish had been deep-fried beforehand and was slightly crispy, and was re-fried with an insane amount of ground pepper, onions, sliced chilies, onions and green onion. There was so much pepper I found myself in a warm, peppery stupor afterwards. This is a good thing.

This being food of Chinese origin, one must order stir-fried veggies such as poy leng :

 

a green leaf not unlike spinach, and khanaa , Chinese kale with oyster sauce:

 

Salty, garlicky and only slightly oily. Perfect.

I was right.

Chiang Heng is a blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-it kitchen supplies store on Thanon Charoen Krung. The owner estimates that the Sino-Portuguese shophouse is at least 100 years old, and he is the third generation of his family to own the shop.

I recently met with Suthon Sukphisit, the author of the Bangkok Post&apos;s excellent weekly Thai food column, Cornucopia (ever Saturday in the Outlook section of the Bangkok Post ) . Khun Suthon is a gold mine of information about Thai food and hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Bangkok, and was kind enough to give me a few interesting leads that I will certainly follow up on these pages. One of the places he mentioned was a khao mok , biryani, stall near the Haroon Mosque off of Thanon Charoen Krung. According to Khun Suthon, the stall serves what he considers the best khao mok in town, but is only open on Fridays, the biggest Muslim prayer day.

Curious, I headed down last Friday to check it out. The stall was a bit hard to find, but after asking around I located a long table topped with snacks and sweets and three immense pots of biryani:

 

I ordered a plate of khao mok nuea , beef biryani (pictured at the top of this post), but honestly was skeptical. The rice seemed to lack the deep yellow/orange colour of previous excellent biryanis, such as that of Naaz , and wasn&apos;t even topped with crispy deep-fried shallots! Despite appearances, the rice and the beef were both rich in flavour, the rice was perfectly cooked, and had a pleasant spicy flavour and was laced with sweet golden raisins and green peas. I&apos;m not sure if I would call it the best khao mok in town, but sitting at the open-air table next to the mosque and chatting with the other diners, reckon it&apos;s undoubtedly the most atmospheric.

Among the other things available here are a variety sweet snacks, some very tasty samosas:

 

and khao yam :

 

the southern Thai rice &apos;salad&apos;.

Fatima, the owner, and her helpers were very friendly and talkative, and when I asked why she only sold on Fridays, she said that &quot;There are not enough customers in this neighbourhood!&quot; Too bad, that.

I came across this interesting item at Wikipedia. It&apos;s a poster advocating how Thais should and should not have dressed during the conservative Phibulsongkhram era (1938-1945). It reads:

Thai Culture
When in communal or official places
When in public or on the street

(left side)
Do Not
Dressing in this manner is not part of Thai custom
Men:
Do not wear a sarong or expose the upper body
Do not shave your head or wear a Muslim-style hat
Women:
Do not expose the upper body or wear a shawl
Do not wear only underclothes or carry things on your head

(right side)
Do
Thai custom entails dressing this way
Men:
Do wear international-style clothes or Thai style short trousers
Do wear a proper button-down shirt
Women:
Do wear your hair long and a clean, proper outer shirt
Everybody must wear a proper skirt

Joy Ngeuamboupha (above) and Caroline Gaylard of Tamarind restaurant in Luang Prabang have been making their delicious Lao food at the Sheraton Grand Sukhumvit this week. As part of the occasion, a small, but elite group of the city&apos;s media was invited to take part in a cooking demonstration of three traditional Luang Prabang dishes taught by Joy himself.

Joy, a native of Luang Prabang province, and Caroline, an Australian, originally collaborated to make a cookbook of authentic Lao recipes. This led to, as these things do, a restaurant, and in 2005 Tamarind was born. Today their restaurant is still one of the only handful of places in Luang Prabang where visitors can sample authentic local dishes, and the owners have made it their mission to introduce people to authentic Lao food.

Before going through the dishes Joy taught us, here are a few tips from Joy about sticky rice, the Lao staple:

-Sticky rice should be soaked for 12 hours before cooking
-After soaking, the sticky rice needs to be washed three times; the first time gently squeezing the rice, the second two simply rinsing until eventually the water runs clear
-Sticky rice should be steamed for about 30-40 minutes, uncovered; when steam begins to rise from the top of the rice, take the sticky rice out, flip it over, and steam for another five minutes
-When the sticky rice is done, keep it in a katip , a permeable bamboo basket; keeping the sticky rice in a sealed container will cause it to become inedible mush

 Oua Si Khai - Stuffed Lemongrass 
 

Joy began by showing us how to make several long slices in the bottom parts of largish stalks of lemongrass:

 

After being softened (with a pestle) and opened, the stalks were then stuffed with a filling of ground chicken that had been blended in mortar and pestle along with salt, garlic, spring onions, coriander and kaffir lime leaf:

 

The lemongrass sticks were then dipped in an egg wash and deep-fried:

 

until the meat was just done, resulting in the finished product seen above.

 Jaew Makok - A &quot;Dip&quot; of Roasted Chilies and Makok 
 

This one might be a hard dish for many of you to make at home, as makok , also known as hog plum, is undoubtedly quite hard to find abroad. I wouldn&apos;t really recommend substituting anything, but would just say that it&apos;s there to provide a sour flavour to the dish.

Joy had a bowl of previously-roasted chilies (the large ones called phrik chee faa ), shallots, garlic and the makok , the green fruit shown below:

 

He told us to peel the burnt bits off before mashing the mixture up in a mortar and pestle along with some salt and that very Lao of flavourings, MSG:

 

To this mixture Joy added a handful of deep-fried pork rinds, some chopped coriander and green onions. Still using the mortar and pestle, he mixed the ingredients again, adding a few tablespoons of water as it was quite thick. The finished dip should be salty and sour in flavour, and is served with sticky rice and fresh veggies and herbs.

 Or Lam - Thick Luang Prabang-Style Vegetable Stew 
 

This is one of my favourite Luang Prabang dishes. It should have a spicy/bitter flavour, the result of the addition of sakhaan , a vine used in Luang Prabang cooking. Joy brought several chunks of sakhaan to Bangkok, and showed us how it should be used.

He began by peeling and quartering the sakhaan, and soaking it in water:

 

While this was soaking, Joy brought a couple stalks of lemongrass, a few round eggplants, a couple cloves of garlic and a handful of pea eggplants to a boil:

 

A few minutes later he added some sliced pork and the sakhaan. The mixture was left to simmer for about a half hour, or until as Joy said, &quot;The eggplants are soft.&quot; When this was accomplished, he removed all the solid ingredients, except for the pork and sakhaan, reserving the broth. He then pounded the now-soft herbs and veggies in a mortar and pestle until a rough paste was formed. This paste was re-introduced to the simmering liquid, along with a couple tablespoons of paa daek (Lao-style fish sauce), chopped green beans, more pea eggplant, mouse-ear mushrooms (het huu nuu ), tamlueng , a vine-like leaf, and khao buea , sticky rice that had been soaked in water then broken up into a course powder, a traditional thickening agent:

 

While this was simmering, Top was ordered to chop up a huge amount of dill, coriander, green onions, sawtooth coriander and Thai basil:

 

Which he happily did. When the most recently-added veggies were just about done, the chopped herbs were stirred in:

 
and the mixture left to simmer for a couple more minutes. Enjoy with sticky rice and Beer Lao .

If you just can&apos;t get enough Lao, check out this photo essay on Luang Prabang food I did for Lonely Planet a while back; a still-unpublished piece I wrote about Luang Prabang food ; some super cool Lao recipes ; and an article about Lao food I wrote that ran in the US food mag, Intermezzo .

The restaurant is named after yen ta fo , a Chinese noodle dish that has become very popular in Thailand in the last few years. For many foreigners, the dish, which includes delicacies such as coagulated blood, pickled squid and fish balls, not to mention a disturbingly bright-red broth, is rather off-putting. I previously felt this way, but have learned to embrace the weirdness of yen ta fo and now consider it one of my favourite noodle dishes, especially when consumed here.

On a recent visit, Aong ordered a bowl, which at this restaurant, is immense:

 

It includes all the weird stuff mentioned above, as well as phak boong , deep-fried fish skin and heaps of chili. Oh, and apparently somewhere in there are some noodles.

This restaurant also makes some very good non-noodle dishes, and I ordered khao phat nam phik long ruea :

 

rice fried with a particular type of chili dip (nam phrik long ruea) and served with sides of battered and deep-fried and fresh veggies. Very nice, but not as good as their khao nam phik khai poo , rice served with a spicy chili dip made from crab eggs.

We also ordered a couple sides, including deep-fried fish skin:

 

which tastes much better than it sounds. The crispy skin is served with nam phrik phao , a sweet/spicy chili dip. Ironically, I usually pick the skin off when I eat fish, but like eating this stuff, especially with the dip.

There was also an assortment of look chin plaa , fish balls: 
 

served with a delicious dipping sauce not unlike that typically served with seafood in Thailand. I particularly like the kiaow plaa , fish wontons (far left); the &apos;wrapper&apos; is made from fish, and the filling is ground pork pounded up with fresh herbs.

For more yen ta fo-related mirth, refer to the yen ta fo eating contest (sponsored by Yentafo Kruengsong) that my buddy Kelly took part in last year.

On Sunday I was lucky enough to go to a new place with some new friends. New Friend #1 Hock spent several years on the professional banana boat circuit, but after a near-fatal collision with a dolphin, is currently flipping burgers at an anonymous Bangkok restaurant. His wife, and New Friend #2 Maytel is a self-confessed full-time blogger ( Half Asian Tourist , Gut Feelings ) and part-time academic. And there was New Friend #3, who I will refer to as New Friend #4, and who, although it&apos;s only marginally relevant, somehow reminded me of Australian chef David Thompson .

The new place was Mae Phim Beach in Rayong. In the Thai tradition, half of the beach is devoted to fresh seafood shacks, one of which, Khrua Thalay, Hock and Maytel had been to a few times previously. Rummaging though glass cases of live seafood, Hock chose Moreton Bay bugs , which our lovely chefstress suggested deep-frying with garlic:

 

Very nice, and actually a first for me.

Somebody wanted whelks (pictured above), another novelty for me--I had only known them as hoy waan . We had grilled, and dipped into the famous Thai seafood dipping sauce, they were wonderful.

I ordered hoy phat chaa :

 

clams fried with fresh herbs, including garlic, kaffir lime leaf, holy basil and krachaay . The clams were just done, and the balance of flavours nearly perfect.

Hock ordered plaa kraphong , seabass that was splayed and marinated with fish sauce before being deep-fried and served with a green mango dressing:

 

The fish was slightly salty and the salad provided the sweet and sour. There was balance.

And along with balance there was also a generous portion of fried rice with crab:

 

A lovely meal and a lovely day.

Jay Fai is probably the most famous place in town to get phat khii mao (&apos;drunkards&apos; stir-fry&apos;), the spicy fried noodle dish that, like the name suggests, seems to combine just about everything in the kitchen. People go to Jay Fai because the noodles are good, but her restaurant might actually be more famous because the noodles are expensive. Now, 200 baht (about $7) may seem like chump change to those of you reading this in the West, but it&apos;s a helluvalot for noodles here in Bangkok. Expectations run high.

I got there at 5pm, just as she was opening, which meant having to wait through a lengthy prayer and offering session at her spirit altar. Jay Fai began by pouring a good half-litre of cooking oil into a smoking hot wok. This was followed by two large prawns. After deep-frying these, she tilted the wok to pour out nearly every last drop of oil, reassuring me the entire time that &quot;It won&apos;t be oily, it won&apos;t be oily...&quot; And indeed, without adding any additional oil, she followed with the rest of the ingredients: the wide noodles known as sen yai , squid (both fresh and pickled), minced garlic, crab meat, chopped green beans, long slices of carrot, baby corn, palm heart, shiitake mushrooms, and finally, a healthy handful of holy basil leaves and a dollop of fresh chilies. While she sprinkled the lot with fish sauce, she explained that if the mixture stuck, she loosened it with a bit of broth, not more oil. The result:

 

was delicious: meaty, smoky, garlicky and only slightly oily. Was it worth 200 baht? Taste is subjective; try it yourself and decide. I&apos;ll certainly be back.

There are heaps of good things to eat in Thailand. But if there was one dish that I would recommend to visitors, particularly because so few foreigners seem to be familiar with it, I would choose khao khluk kapi . This literally means &apos;rice mixed with shrimp paste&apos;, which is a poor description of this vibrant dish that seems to include every favourable flavour and texture in Thai cooking.

The dish is based around rice that has been fried, or sometimes boiled, with shrimp paste, giving it a pleasant fishy odour and a greyish-brown hue. This rice is topped with ingredients that usually include shredded green mango, slices of cucumber, a thin omelet that that has been sliced into strips, thinly sliced shallots, thinly sliced green beans, crispy deep-fried dried shrimp, and sometimes a few slices of kun chiang , Chinese-style pork sausage, and small slices of pineapple. There&apos;s always a side of muu waan , pork belly that has been braised in palm sugar and fish sauce, a garnish of few dried chilies deep-fried until crispy, and often a slice of lime. The dish is often, but not always served with a dish of clear broth.

The dish is salty from the shrimp paste, fresh and crispy from the veggies, sweet from the fruit and muu waan, and can also be spicy, if you decide to mix in the chilies. I like to mix everything together beforehand to ensure that I get a bit of each flavour/texture in each mouthful.

For more in-your-face khao khluk kapi action, check out the excellent version done at Ratana ; an acceptable take at a local noodle stall ; a decent but scant version at Tha Chang market ; an improvised version at the Suan Lum Night Bazaar ; and a haphazard dish at a local restaurant .

 Bamii , wheat noodles served with muu daeng , barbecued pork, is a dish you can find just about anywhere in Bangkok. The vast majority of stalls are leased out by a franchise called Chai Sii, and are mediocre at best. The noodles at these stalls tend to be quite pasty, and the barbecued pork is largely flavourless meat that appears to have been painted with a overly-sweet red sauce. I&apos;m sure there must be some good bamii out there, but the only place that has reached my lofty standards thus far is Mangkorn Khao (&apos;White Dragon&apos;), way out in Chinatown.

I always order kiaow naam :

 

wontons in broth. The wontons are filled with ground pork that has been mixed with an ungodly amount of ground black pepper, garlic and coriander roots, and wrapped around a single shrimp. The broth is subtle, but fragrant, and includes a few bits of greens and deep-fried pork rinds. Eat this and I can guarantee you&apos;ll still be tasting the warm black pepper/garlic/coriander root flavour a good half-hour after leaving. It&apos;s a nice feeling.

I like to follow this with a bowl of bamii haeng muu daeng , &apos;dry&apos; noodles with barbecued pork:

 

The noodles at Mangkorn Khao are slightly thinner than those you&apos;ll find elsewhere, and are toothsome and have a pleasant nutty flavour. The barbecued pork appears to have really been barbecued, and is slightly crispy and fatty, almost bacon-like. If pork is not your thing, you can also get crab meat, which I usually do at lesser stalls, but the pork here is so good I can&apos;t pass it up. If you order your noodles &apos;dry&apos;, the broth is served on the side, and I like to add just a couple tablespoons to loosen up the noodles.

Mangkorn Khao was mentioned previously here .

Chote Chitr, a six-table restaurant in the Banglamphu district, has gained something of an underground following since it was mentioned in a New York Times article a few years back. I first learned about Chote Chitr (pronounced chote jit ) from Suthon Sukphisit, author of the Bangkok Post&apos;s excellent weekly Thai food column, Cornucopia. Suthon told me that it is of his favourite places in town to eat, and in particular he always orders, mee krob , &apos;crispy noodles&apos; (pictured above). He explained that Chote Chitr is one of the few places that makes this dish the old school way, using the peel of som saa , a certain kind of citrus fruit, to flavour the sauce. The sour/citrus flavour of the som saa is indeed very prominent in the dish, which despite appearances, wasn&apos;t as sweet as I feared. In fact, it was a very nice balance of sour, sweet and savoury, with a satisfying crunch. There were a few prawns and squid bits thrown in, a topping of shredded pickled ginger, and sides of Chinese kale and beansprouts. I&apos;ve never made the dish, and have no idea where to get a good recipe. Any ideas?

For other good eats in this area, check out this post .

If you&apos;ve ever looked at my photo blog, The Old Main Drag , you&apos;ll have noticed that I tend to spend lots of time in Yaowarat, Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. For the last few months, I&apos;ve been working on a photo project that will be shown Bangkok&apos;s own Kathmandu Photo Gallery late next year. As a result, I&apos;ve been going to Yaowarat at least once a week, often more. My favourite time to take pics in Yaowarat is early in the morning, and after a couple hours of walking and shooting, inevitably I get pretty hungry. Despite the variety of eats in Chinatown, I always end up eating at a streetside curry stall off of Thanon Phaatsaay called Jay Kii.

 

Jay Kii sells a variety of Chinese-Thai curries, stir-fries and soups:

 

These include an excellent kaeng khiaow waan look chin plaa kraay , green curry with fish dumplings, some nice soups, namely jap chai , the Chinese-style vegetable stew, or an excellent bitter gourd stuffed with pork in broth . But I always tend to go for her daily &apos;specials&apos;, such as this morning&apos;s naam phrik kapi &apos;set&apos; (pictured at the top of this post), or her excellent khao khluk kapi (shown in this post ). After some eats, and a glass of iced coffee from the stall in the same soi, I&apos;m usually ready to wander for another hour or so before heading home.

Spotted at a market in Chanthaburi. My sources tell me they are filled with some sort of sweet liquid and are particularly favoured by the younger generation. Perhaps my all-knowing food mentor Aong can provide some insight? Anybody else?

More from Chanthaburi to follow in the next couple days.

I recently spent a couple days in the town of Chanthaburi. Discovering a new place is always fun, but sometimes it&apos;s better to have a guide, and on this trip I was fortunate to be accompanied by a well-connected half-Chanthaburian food freak.

Rice noodles, the main ingredient in p hat thai (shown above) are associated with Chanthaburi, and we stopped by a factory where they still make the noodles the old school way, by drying them in the sun on bamboo racks:

 

Rice noodles are also used in kuaytiao muu liang , another dish associated with Chanthaburi:

 

We at at a place outside of town called Phrya Trang (address below). The broth gets its dark colour from a combination of local herbs, and its slightly sweet taste from the addition of pineapple. I&apos;d say it was somewhat similar to kuaytiao ruea , but not quite as intense.

Root herbs are actually a very important part of the local cuisine in Chanthaburi, and a walk through any of the city&apos;s markets will reveal several kinds of plants generally not used elsewhere in Thailand, such as krawaan :

 

and young krachaay :

 

Being close to the sea, seafood is also a big deal, and the markets are stocked with heaps of fish, shrimp and squid, and even odder things, such as horseshoe crabs:

 

The ones above have already been grilled, and you only eat the eggs (often made into yam , Thai-style salad); there is no meat.

If you&apos;re at Chanthaburi&apos;s main market in the morning and find yourself in need of a snack, you can do like the locals and stop by this tiny stall selling paa thong ko , deep-fried bits of dough:

 

The stall is very popular, as the line of impatient motorcyclists suggests. Unlike elsewhere, in Chanthaburi paa thong ko are served with a thin, sweet/sour sauce, somewhat similar to that sometimes served with deep-fried chicken elsewhere in Thailand.

The annual Chinese vegetarian festival is now on until the 19th. On Tuesday I made it out to the Talaat Noi area where a Chinese temple called Saan Jao Jo Sue Kong is a centre of all the meat-free frenzy. Here heaps of white-clad worshipers come to watch ngiw (a Chinese drama, shown at the top of this post) pray, burn incense and candles, and buy the paper lanterns that form a virtual roof over the temple.

 

This is all fun, but my main goal was to eat, and my favourite dish to eat during the veggie festival is mii lueang , stir-fried Hokkien-style noodles:

 

At Talaat Noi these were made at very popular stall where had to wait about 20 minutes before we even got a seat.

Another thing I really enjoyed was khanom tup tab , a snack made by pounding peanuts with sugar until a thick, sweet skin is formed:

 

This is then wrapped around crushed peanuts. The result looks similar to, and tastes almost exactly like Butterfinger , but without the chocolate. Delicious.

Here and elsewhere in Chinatown you&apos;ll find meat-free versions of most popular Chinese-Thai dishes, including noodles, stews and stir-fries. Oddly enough though, despite this being a vegetarian festival, you&apos;ll find very few vegetables, and hardly anything green, Thailand&apos;s Chinese community preferring soybean and flour-based dishes.

A few more pics from the veggie festival, including some from last year&apos;s, can be seen here .

I used to think khao soi , the northern Thai curry noodle dish, was nearly impossible to find in Bangkok, but in the last few weeks I&apos;ve run across it more than a couple times. My latest discovery was ironically only a few kilos from my house, under the Ram Intra Expressway near the intersection with Lad Phrao.

Arriving just after lunch with my generally reliable food sidekick Aong, we were dismayed to find that they only khao sois remaining at that time were the pork and seafood varieties. This was immensely disturbing news, as khao soi is almost exclusively served with chicken or beef (a sign of the dish&apos;s Muslim roots). Pork is a lazy substitute and seafood khao soi is a heresy beyond words, and those responsible for the concept should be forced to eat...seafood khao soi for the rest of their days. Grudgingly, we chose the pork (shown above). The dish was a decent, if not mediocre take on the dish, but lacking the creamy, oily, spiciness of Faa Haam&apos;s nearly-perfect bowl . The sides (pickled mustard cabbage, sliced shallots and lime) also seemed of substandard quality. Sophaphan also serves the Shan noodle dish, naam ngiao w, as well as some northern Thai standards and som tam . Good in a pinch, I reckon, or if you&apos;re in the neighborhood (make sure you come early), but you&apos;ll be much happier if you make the trip over to Viphawadee to eat at Faa Haam.

I&apos;ve also come across khao soi on Sukhumvit Sois 22 and 31; stay tuned for a detailed investigation.

Addendum: In flipping through my replies to this blog, I recently received a comment from a woman who&apos;s doing a blog exclusively about khao soi in New York City ! Honestly, I was surprised enough to find out that one can actually get khao soi in in the US (it&apos;s hard enough to find in Bangkok), but even more shocking is the price: $16 for a bowl of khao soi??!!?? Maybe I&apos;m spoiled living here, but the price I payed for the bowl above, 30 baht--slightly less than $1, feels about right to me. Guess I won&apos;t be going home anytime soon...

click on the image I was recently forwarded this New York Times article about dining in Portland, Oregon (one of my three &apos;hometowns&apos;, along with Bangkok and Stockholm). Other than making me slightly homesick, I was surprised to learn that a Thai restaurant is among those currently creating a buzz back at home. I did a bit of research and found that Pok Pok , the restaurant mentioned, serves not just Thai, but ahaan isaan , northeastern-style Thai food. The self-proclaimed &apos;shack&apos; was also voted the Oregonian&apos;s Restaurant of the Year . Two detailed and generally favourable blog reviews can be seen here and here (I particularly like this bit: &quot;Fortunately the lighting is is much better than what you’d typically find in Thailand.&quot;). Sounds very interesting. Has anybody been?

Nakhorn Sawan Street, just outside Banglamphu in old Bangkok, is home to Talaat Nang Loeng , one of the older and more interesting markets in town. However the street is probably even more associated with the several shops in the area that sell kluay thawt , deep-fried bananas. This snack, also sometimes known as kluay khaek , is found just about everywhere in Bangkok, but what&apos;s special about these bananas is the way they&apos;re sold.

As illustrated above, the vendors take their product directly to the streets, waiting for a red light and weaving between stopped cars.

 

Technically, this is illegal, and every time a policeman comes, the vendors scream warnings at each other and run away frantically. I saw this happen several times in the nearly 15 minutes I watched them at work and thought that it seemed an awful nerve-wracking way to make a living.

Eventually I took a seat and tried the bananas. Although they&apos;re normally sold in bags of two for 20 baht, I bought a single bag for 10. The bananas of the particular vendor I bought were decent; not too greasy, but could have been a bit sweeter (and I prefer the ones with sesame in the batter). While I sat and crunched through my bag, I chatted with the vendors while they screamed at their co-workers in the streets when cops drove by. One vendor told me that he was particularly annoyed with journalists who had pretended to want to buy bananas, only to snap pictures and leave without buying anything.

Mango and sticky rice is, like phat thai and tom yam , one of the few Thai dishes foreigners seem to be familiar with even before arriving in Thailand. On Khao San Road there are even a couple mobile mango sticky rice carts that wander up and down the streets, scavenging for hungry new arrivals. I haven&apos;t tried these carts, but doubt they&apos;re anywhere as good as the stuff sold literally across the way at K. Phanich.

K. Phanich only sells khao niaow moon , sweetened sticky rice, and a few other sweet/savoury toppings; if you want to eat your rice with mango you can buy one from the woman waiting patiently out front. We arrived late in the day and she apologized several times that she only had slightly sour mangoes left. She choose what she reckoned to be the sweetest one and proceeded to peel and slice it for us:

 

K. Phanich has no seating, so we took our booty to the shop next door (another interesting place that I&apos;ll blog about next) where, after ordering a few more things to eat, we combined about half of the sticky rice with the mangoes, poured over the still-warm salty-sweet coconut dressing, and sprinkled the lot with the crispy dried peas (the peas don&apos;t provide much taste, but provide the dish a wonderfully crunchy texture). The mango was slightly sour, but I thought it was a pleasant counterpoint to the very sweet rice and sauce. This dish, like many other Thai desserts, also has a slightly salty flavour, and is best eaten slightly warm, which really allows the bizarre but delicious salty/sweet combo. to shine.

If you&apos;d like to try to make this dish at home, here&apos;s a recipe from Pim .

Virtually next door to K. Phanich is Nom Jo, a small restaurant that specializes in, of all things, milk. This is an odd variety of Thai restaurant that, I assume, dates back to the days when milk was something not generally available in Thailand and Thais had to go to specialist restaurants to drink it. Nowadays milk can be bought everywhere, but the restaurants still exist, and have begun to sell a variety of dishes to stay alive.

At Nom Jo (&apos;Jo&apos;s Milk&apos;) we skipped over the milk altogether and went directly to kuaytiao luy suan , literally &apos;noodles on an adventure in the garden&apos;. I really have no idea regarding the origin of this name (can anybody help?), and can only assume that it has to do with the fact that the dish is served with a large variety of fresh herbs and veggies.

As shown above, the dish is similar in form to spring rolls, the main difference being that kuaytiao luy suan are &apos;wetter&apos; and more savoury. With lesser versions of this dish, when you break the noodle wrapper, the typically &apos;dry&apos; filling tends to tumble out. With Jo&apos;s version, the filling, a mixture of ground pork, carrot and shiitake mushrooms, and a few other things I can&apos;t recall, had been sauteed before being placed on a lettuce leaf and bundled in the noodle. This helped hold the mixture together, and the seasoning during this process also provided a salty, savoury taste. The rice-flour noodle wrapper was also very nice, and was thick and toothsome without being soggy or heavy.

The dish was served with two sauces: a delicious spicy/sour one similar to that served with Thai seafood, and another sweet sauce similar to the one Thais eat with fried chicken, not to mention herbs including basil, mint, sawtooth coriander and lettuce.

Nom Jo also serves what look like some very interesting Chinese-Thai stews and curries, not to mention a variety of drinks (both milk and non-milk).

Still in the Thanon Tanao area of Banglamphu, virtually across the street from K. Phanich and Nom Jo (I told you there&apos;s a lot of good stuff to eat here), exists a second-generation shop that specializes in making one product: paa thong ko . Essentially deep-fried bits of dough, it&apos;s a simple dish, and the owner has been making them in the same place for fifty years, taking over from his parents after they were too old to run the business.

The paa thong ko are served with a sweet milk-based dipping sauce flavoured with (and turned green by) bai toey , pandanus:

 
 
They are best eaten right away, when they&apos;re still hot, but I was surprised to find that the paa thong ko remained relatively crispy a good half hour after we bought them.

Another day, another Bangkok food legend. Today&apos;s gem is Likhit Kai Yaang, an ancient isaan restaurant next door to Ratchadamnoen Thai boxing stadium in Banglamphu. Likhit doesn&apos;t appear to have changed much since its apparent grand opening in 1960-something, and is not unlike, I imagine, a Soviet-era mess hall. And as was probably the case with Soviet-era mess halls, I wouldn&apos;t particularly advise looking into the cave-like kitchen.

 Kai yaang means grilled chicken, and this is what people come here to eat. The birds (in this case kai baan , the Thai version of free range chicken) are first marinaded in a secret mixture, which I&apos;m thinking must include at the least garlic, coriander seeds and/or roots and perhaps a bit of turmeric, before being grilled over coals outside the restaurant by an expert:

 

The result is a crispy skin redolent of the delicious marinade, and flesh that is tender and slightly smoky. Lovely indeed. Other than the restaurant&apos;s namesake, Likhit also does the issan staples, including a delicious som tam :

 

 tap waan , liver:

 

grilled catfish:

 

and tom saep , a spicy/sour issan-type tom yam :

 

All wonderful, in particular the som tam, but the chicken is the reason I&apos;ll come back.

Roti Mataba is the name of restaurant on Thanon Phra Athit that has been made extremely popular by its place in the Lonely Planet guide. It used to be quite good, but standards have dipped in recent years and I&apos;d not really recommend it any more. The Roti Mataba I&apos;m mentioning today is an entirely different place.

Found around the corner next to Thammasat University, this Roti Mataba is located at the beginning of the impossibly narrow alleyway known as the Tha Phra Chan Market . We were simply here for a snack, and ordered a mataba (pictured above), a Thai-Muslim dish similar to a stuffed pancake. This one was filled with minced chicken that had been mixed with a delicious &apos;curry&apos; mixture and egg. Mataba are always served with ajaat , a sweet/sour dipping sauce that includes sliced chilies (the mild type) and cucumber.

The restaurant itself is tiny cave-like affair:

 
(Click here to see a larger version.)

and since there&apos;s no ventilation, and virtually everything the restaurant makes is fried, the entire place is coated with a thin film of oil. It&apos;s also very hot, but despite all this, it really is an ideal place for a snack, as they serve a huge variety of drinks, as well as every imaginable type of Thai snack-type food, including hoy thord (fried oysters), spring rolls, som tam , and in particular, yam plaa duk foo :

 

the salad of crispy deep-fried catfish.

I&apos;d like to urge any readers in Bangkok to visit the 9 Days in the Kingdom photo exhibition currently being held on the 8th floor of ZEN, Central World. The exhibition is the offshoot of the book of the same name that features the images of world-famous photographers such as Greg Gorman, David Alan Harvey, Steve McCurry, Mike Yamashita, Abbas, Eric Valli, et al over a nine-day period in Thailand during January, 2007. James Nachtwey&apos;s images on an AIDS hospice are particularly moving, and I really enjoyed shots by Surat Osathanukhrah, Dow Wasiksiri, Gueorgui Pinkhassov and Ben Simmons. And as an added bonus, I&apos;m actually featured in one of the images! Mad props to the first RealThai reader who finds me.

Grass jelly is a dessert of Chinese origin that can be found virtually everywhere in Southeast Asia. If you&apos;re not familiar with it, have a look at this piece I wrote last year for a domestic paper.

My favourite place in Bangkok to eat grass jelly is an old shophouse just a few steps away from Tha Chang. There are a couple of chairs and tables inside, but most people simply sit on the stools set out along Thanon Maharat, as shown in the picture above.

 

The grass jelly itself has subtle &apos;herbal&apos; flavour, and is served with crushed ice, but my favourite part is the unprocessed cane sugar, naam taan daeng , that the dish is topped with:

Something of a mini Southeast Asian food bloggers summit was held a couple weeks ago here in Bangkok. This involved Hock of Gut Feelings , Phil formerly of Phnomenon and currently The Last Appetite , and me of here , and any day now, Gut Feelings . Aided with my in-depth Bangkok food experience, as well as a handy illustrated map provided by food-blogger-in-spirit Aong, we attacked Thanons Tanao and Mahanop, leaving nary a crumb behind.

I&apos;ve mentioned most of our stops in previous posts, so I&apos;ll just touch the one new place I visited, Ko Lun. Directed by Aong&apos;s map, we entered Thanon Mahanop and turned right at the fat dog:

 

and started with the recommended khanom jeen hailam , Hainan-style noodles (pictured above). The dish took the form of a clear, rather bland broth, with hearty udon-like noodles, and deep-fried and par-boiled pork, and oddly, toasted sesame seeds. It wasn&apos;t much to write home about until you added the tiny bowl of seasoned shrimp paste, an unusual but tasty condiment for a noodle dish.

The restaurant&apos;s other signature dish is goat stewed in red sauce:

 

It was good--although perhaps not as flavourful as the deeply-coloured broth would suggest. The goat was still pretty tough, and was supplemented with tofu skin and offal:

 

The dish was served with rice and two dipping sauces, one very much like the spicy/sour Thai seafood dipping sauce, another of finely shredded dried galangal that I found absolutely delish.

Despite the big names and egos involved, it was an enjoyable day, and the Summit went generally well until Phil unsuccessfully tried to score us a free meal by promising to blog on the restaurant (&apos;Do you know who I am? No? Does a little thing called Phnomenon ring a bell? Bitch...&apos;).

You&apos;ve just got to keep your eyes open. Khao soi , the northern Thai curry noodle dish that every foreigner seems to love, is in fact available in Bangkok. My most recent discovery was on Thanon Sukhumvit, an unlikely place to find good, let alone, regional Thai food. A small family-run shophouse outfit, Yuy Lee has been serving khao soi for a couple decades. Despite this, the product of their labour:

 

is, in my opinion, decent, but not exceptional. The broth could have used a bit more oomph, and the noodles were regular round bamee noodles, not the flattish noodles typically used in khao soi. The deep-fried crispy noodles were also of the cheap, packaged variety.

Much stronger was the khanom jeen naam ngiao (pictured above). The broth was fragrant and deliciously sour (from the addition of tomatoes), and loaded with deep-fried crispy garlic. If I went to Yuy Lee again, I would probably go straight for this rather than waste time with the khao soi.

For a cutting edge dispatch from the heart of khao soi country, check out The Last Appetite&apos;s recent post , which in a bizarre circle, also links back here.

I recently made my first trip to Australia to attend a Lonely Planet writers&apos; workshop (ta Tony and Maureen!). The workshop was held at LPHQ in Melbourne, but I touched down near Byron Bay, at a place called Brunswick Heads. My friend K lives a short walk from the sea, which, I&apos;ve been told, is good for a variety of things, in particular easy access to excellent fish and chips:

 

It was also a pleasure to discover that Australians consistently do excellent coffee:

 

although the nomenclature is a bit difficult to get one&apos;s head around. In Australia, an espresso is known as a &apos;short black&apos;, but at the coffee bar above I mistakenly called it a &apos;small black&apos; and received a blank stare as a response!

After a long weekend of relaxing by the beach, I flew over to Melbourne for the workshop. I only had an afternoon free to explore the city, so armed with tips from Phil and Hock , I headed directly to the amazing Queen Vic Market :

 

 

I really loved the deli section (above) that has all that good stuff that is so hard to find, and/or too expensive here in Bangkok.

This was followed by a delicious lamb souvlaki at Medallion Cafe in the Greek district (apparently Melbourne is the largest Greek city outside of Greece), immensely filling Western-Chinese at the brilliantly named Supper Inn , and a mini pub crawl to Transport (which boasts 150+ kinds of beer including the excellent Crackenback Pale Ale , and the local brew, Mountain Goat Pale Ale ), and Hock&apos;s old haunt, Troika .

Melbourne has to the be most Asian &apos;Western&apos; city I&apos;ve ever visited, and seeing as LP HQ is in Footscray, home to the city&apos;s largest concentration of Vietnamese, J, one of my former editors, took some of us out for a Vietnamese lunch:

 

where we had huge bowls of a very tasty vegetarian pho:

 Phil&apos;s recent post at The Last Appetite reminded me that I&apos;ve yet to post a few additional images from our recent mini Southeast Asian bloggers summit . The pictures in question are of k hanom pang ping sangkhayaa , toast topped with a kind of coconut custard (pictured above). I&apos;m not entirely sure what is responsible for the orange colour, but whatever it was, it tasted as artificial as it looked.

There was also nom naam daeng :

 

chilled milk mixed with naam daeng , a syrup-and-food-colouring mixture that all Thais seem to love, and that I thought went very well with this employee&apos;s outfit:

 

Despite garish colours involved, I actually like this restaurant. It&apos;s called Thian Song, and is an old-school Chinese eatery-slash coffee shop in a fun part of town, minutes from the Giant Swing. It&apos;s probably favourite place to drink iced coffee--just stay away from anything bright.

Wandering about Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown as I often do, I tend to pass by lots of good eats, usually immediately after I&apos;ve finished eating. I always make a mental note to come back, but it&apos;s not often that this happens.

A couple weeks ago I finally made it back a shop that I had noticed several times. Thai Charoen, a tiny family-run place along Thanon Charoen Krung, sells equal parts Thai (curries, spicy stir-fried dishes) and Chinese (stewed veggies, fried noodles), and dishes, such as the stuffed squid shown above, that seem to straddle both cuisines.

I had eggplant stir-fried with fish dumplings (another Thai-Chinese &apos;fusion&apos; dish), and a bowl of jap chai , a Chinese vegetable stew.

 

Both excellent, and I would recommend stopping by. And on this note, I realize Bangkok is a big, confusing town, so from now on, I&apos;m going to try to link all my restaurant writeups to Google Maps. Hope this helps!

Mr. Mong makes the best hawy thawt , fried oysters, in town. Actually, don&apos;t tell Mr. Mong, but I prefer it when Mrs. Mong is at the stove (see above). Her dish is greasy, has little nutritional value, and honestly, doesn&apos;t look very attractive:

 

but it&apos;s delicious, which is what counts.

To make it, they fry a flour and egg-based batter over a coal-burning stove until it resembles crispy and nearly burnt pancake:

 

They then toss either mussels or oysters on the stove and along with some spring onions, soy sauce and a corn starch wash, fry until just done. These are then used to top the crispy batter.

I&apos;m told they also make an excellent fried rice with crab.

In the next couple days, those visiting this blog will automatically be redirected to a more general foodblog at my online portfolio, www.austinbushphotography.com/foodblog. RealThai has been just as international as it has been Thai for while now, so you can expect to see no real change in content. However I thought thought that integrating my blogs (I&apos;ll also have a photography blog, www.austinbushphotography.com/photoblog) with my online portfolio would make a unique &apos;hub&apos; of all my work. I hope you&apos;ll agree, and I also hope you&apos;ll take the time to check out the new images that form my portfolio, as well as my photography blog. Enjoy!

 Khao man kai , Hainanese-style chicken rice is a dish you can find just about anywhere in Bangkok. The hard part is finding a good one. Working on vague word-of-mouth instructions, my food detective friend Aong and I found ourselves near the Victory Monument confronted by two identical-looking khao man kai restaurants. Employing an innate ability to find good eats in Bangkok that has yet to fail us, we chose Jay Wa. Good choice. The rice was perfectly-cooked (not too soggy or to dry), and my favourite part, the sauce -- a mixture of tao jiaw (fermented soybeans), ginger and vinegar -- was also wonderful.

In the course of our gluttony we discovered that Jay Wa also does a wonderful k uaytiaw yentafo (a noodle soup combining fish balls and a red, spicy broth).

Curries are a big deal in Kanchanaburi. People in this province love them, and love lots of them. I saw a restaurant in Thong Phaa Phoom district advertising 100 dishes. You can recognize such restaurants by the stainless steel pots out front. Other than curries, you&apos;ll also find soups, stir-fries and other dishes. Understandably, it&apos;s a big decision:

 

Finding myself both in Kanchanaburi and hungry, I was lucky to find Ko Kaat, a roadside stall boasting 39 dishes. After lifting about 20 lids, my partner in eating, Aong and I finally rounded it down to four dishes. Unfortunately, Kok Kaat appears to favour quantity over quality, and the dishes were had were average, although not bad. These included a pretty good tom yam het , mushroom tom yam :

 

and kaeng khii lek , a curry made from a bitter leaf:

It may not look like it, but these very Thai-looking sweets, photographed at a market in Samut Songkhram, are in fact Portuguese in origin. Here&apos;s a description of how they came about, excerpted from an article I wrote a while back for Chile Pepper magazine:
 Other than simply having brought new ingredients to the people and places they colonized, in some cases, by living and mixing with local populations, the Portuguese also had an impact on the way Asians cooked. This can be seen as early as the early 16th century, when after having secured the port of Melaka in present-day Malaysia, the Portuguese went abroad to nearby Thailand, then known as Siam. Establishing friendly relations with the kingdom that was based in Ayuthaya, the Portuguese influenced an unexpected aspect of Thai cuisine: its sweets. By introducing the concept of using egg yolks and flour, ingredients integral to Portuguese dessert making, the Portuguese had an impact on Thai desserts that exists until today. Remnants of this legacy can still be found Ayuthaya today. There I came across a variety of Thai sweets, probably variants of ovos moles , a Portuguese egg custard. These bright orange sweets included foy thong , ‘golden strands’, thong yot , ‘golden drops’, and thong yip , ‘pinched gold’, the names all including the Thai word for gold, thong , a reference to the color imparted by the use of duck-egg yolks. Do I have any Portuguese readers out there? Am curious to know if these sweets still take the same form in their country of origin.

Stay tuned for more pics from Samut Songkhram&apos;s very impressive market.

Samut Songkhram, a small town south of Bangkok, has one of the most interesting fresh markets in the country. As illustrated above, a significant part of the market is located directly on the city&apos;s railroad tracks. When the train runs through, as it does several times each day, everybody picks up and moves to allow it to pass, then immediately gets back down to important task of vending. The aesthetics of the situation, not to mention the excellent food, led to some interesting images, some of which can be seen here .

Update: Reader cranrob sent a link to a hilarious YouTube video (not mine) of the train running through the market:

I&apos;ve mentioned this northern Thai restaurant suburban Bangkok previously , but after a recent meal, and now that I&apos;m mapping restaurants, feel compelled to mention it again.

Perhaps I wasn&apos;t so decisive about this before , but after my third visit, I&apos;d say that this place serves the best northern Thai food I&apos;ve eaten outside of the region. In fact, I&apos;d wager that Maan Mueng puts out better northern Thai nosh than many restaurants in Chiang Mai! If you come during the day, the selection if huge, and you can just point to whatever looks good from the pots out front. It&apos;s probably one of the only places in Bangkok where you can get seasonal dishes, such as the dish pictured above. It&apos;s called yam phak hueat , and is made from sour-tasting leaf ( phak hueat ) that is minced and par-boiled before being mixed with a curry paste and some other herbs and seasonings. It may not look (or sound?) that pleasant, but was delicious.

Another fun dish was something of a northern Thai tempura; big green chilies stuffed with a delicious minced pork mixture, then battered and deep-fried:

 

But perhaps the coolest thing about Maan Mueng is the greens; there&apos;s a vast table topped with bowls containing different veggies, leaves and herbs, many of which most Bangkok Thais wouldn&apos;t even recognize:

 

A waitress warned me that one herb I chose would make my mouth numb. She was right.

Maan Mueng, which is also known as Yaa Maeng Wai, and which is now open evenings, recently moved a bit further up Ramkhamhaeng, and is now truly outside of the city, but is definitely worth a visit.

This restaurant (pronounced sa ngoo an see ), resembling a concrete bunker filled with office furniture circa 1973, has been a longtime favourite of the the lower Sukhumvit professional set. The kitchen specializes in central and southern Thai fare, with an emphasis on sweet-savoury dishes and curries.

On a recent visit, friends Liz and Dan and I ordered khaao tang naa tang (pictured above), crispy rice cakes served with a sweet-savoury coconut milk, herb and ground pork topping. On previous visits I have had a good kaeng phet pet yaang , red curry with grilled duck breast served over khanom jeen noodles, and an interesting salad containing dried fish:

 
 
I&apos;ve eaten here quite a few times recently, and have enjoyed each meal. This is in contrast to David Thompson , who told me he didn&apos;t enjoy his latest visit. I urge those of you in Bangkok to stop by and let us know what you thought.

To find Sanguan Sri, enter Thanon Withayu and look for a gray, featureless building that you&apos;ll inevitably walk past without noticing.

You&apos;d think you could get fried rice just about anywhere in Bangkok. But Cherry insisted we needed to go to Thanon Thaa Din Daeng, across the river in Thonburi. Cherry has taken me to some good places on this street before, so I had no reason to object.

What makes Sor Raad Naa&apos;s fried rice worth the journey is that owner fries the rice old-school style in a wide flat wok over very, very hot coals. Occasionally he tilts the wok to impart everything with a smoky flavour:

 

If the coals aren&apos;t hot enough, he flips a switch that turns on a high powered fan. He does two types of fried rice, one with tomato (pictured above) and another with Chinese kale:

 

The tomato version was slightly sour, and I imagine that the kale version would taste slightly bitter from the greens. Both are topped with pork that has been marinated and cooked ahead of time.

As the name suggests, the shop was originally known for its raad naa , noodles fried in a thick gravy. They also do the fried noodle dish, phat sii iw , but it seemed that most people, like us, came for the fried rice.

Other places on the same street that Cherry has taken me to include the famous satay place and Chua Jiab Nugan .

This restaurant, pronounced phot saphaa khaan , is famous for its cook, who is the relative of a former cook in the royal palace. The restaurant, which has been located in the same place since 1925, claims to follow these royal recipes, and serves excellent old-school faves such as mee krawp (sweet/sour crispy noodles) and kaeng liang (a thick soup combining shrimp and vegetables). I particularly like the more unusual dishes such as a delicious salad of fresh herbs and grilled pork, and the deceptively simple but delicious omelet with lemongrass (pictured above).

Ever find yourself in a rut? There&apos;s so much good stuff to eat in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, but somehow I always find myself going to the same places. Thus with the intention of trying something new, I stopped by Choy Tii, a shophouse noodle joint on Thanon Plaeng Naam in the heart of Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. What initially drew me in was the shop&apos;s sign (above), which advertised phat mee hong kong , Hong Kong-style fried noodles. Unfortunately Choy Tii was out of the thin, pale wheat noodles used to make this dish and I was asked if I&apos;d rather have mee haeng , &apos;dry noodles&apos;. I agreed, reluctantly, and received this:

 

The noodles, the flat kind known as bamii , were par-boiled along with a few leaves of lettuce, and the whole lot was topped with cubes of fatty muu waan , &apos;sweet pork&apos;, and generous lashings of thick dark Chinese-style vinegar. The dish was meaty, oily and sour, and I thought it was one of the best bowls of noodles I&apos;ve had in a long while. I ate every last bit.

Looking at the sign again it appeared that yen taa fo was Choy Tii&apos;s signature dish, so I decided to try a bowl. I was highly disappointed: the soggy noodles, tasteless factory-like fishballs and weak broth were particularly disappointing, especially after the wonderful yet simple bowl I had just eaten. It was almost enough to make me order another mee haeng.

Lest you think it&apos;s all famous restaurants and ancient recipes for me here in Bangkok, I do enjoy (relatively) trashy food once in a while. This desire usually manifests itself early in the morning, when I&apos;m on my way to Chinatown to take photos. Stopping by Hua Lamphong, the city&apos;s main train terminal, I beeline to the snacks shown above. The waffle-like pastry above is in fact, cleverly known as The Waffle (motto: &quot;Enjoy your life enjoy your waffle&quot;). Lately I&apos;ve been opting for sesame-salt flavour, but I&apos;m also an firm supporter of rum-raisin. A hunk of The Waffle is best enjoyed with a steaming paper cup of espresso from Black Canyon (motto: &quot;A drink from paradise... available on Earth&quot;), a bargain at 50 baht.

And if there was any additional need to justify my decision, here&apos;s the view at Hua Lamphong:

 
(For a larger version of this pic, go here .)

Friend and fellow blogger Newley Purnell is also a big player on the Bangkok waffle scene. He has been known to down one or two The Waffles, but is probably most recognized for his promotion of that ancient Thai snack dish, the waffle-coated hot dog .

Many Thai dishes begin with a thick, pungent paste, typically combining chilies, garlic, shallots and sometimes dried spices. These pastes are known as phrik kaeng or khrueang kaeng , and in the past, were made at home, using a mortar and pestle. Nowadays, at least in Bangkok, most people skip this time-consuming step and buy pre-made pastes. There are lots of brands out there, but if you&apos;re lucky enough to live near Banglamphu, you can get yours at Nittaya.

Having made curry pastes for several decades now, Nittaya has quite a reputation. They&apos;ve got everything here, from ready-to-go matsaman paste, to an excellent nam phrik phao . The curry pastes are kept in covered containers:

 

although this does little to mask the...delicious odour. They&apos;re sold by weight, and the staff can even put your choice into a leak-proof tube.

Nittaya also sells heaps of prepared curries and other dishes:

I&apos;ve been on the road quite a bit lately, the reason for not having posted in while. However I&apos;ve recently become the owner of an intimidatingly black MacBook , so you can expect some mobile blogging in the near future.

My first trip took me once again visit Ayuthaya. I&apos;m always happy to go there for fresh air and the chance to explore, but the excellent Thai food has also become a good enough excuse in its own right. I&apos;ve already mentioned it here and here , so by now you know that if you visit Ayuthaya, you must eat at Baan Wacharachai. This time I wanted to try something different, and asked the locals about the best place to eat kuaytiaw ruea , &apos;boat noodles&apos;, a dish associated with the city. I was enthusiastically pointed in the direction of an open-air restaurant across from the ruins of Wat Ratburana called Lung Lek (&apos;Uncle Lek&apos;):

 

Lung Lek&apos;s noodles here must be among the most intense bowls I&apos;ve ever consumed. There were the usual condiments on the table (fish sauce, dried chilies, sugar), but none was necessary--the noodles were already thoroughly spicy, sour and sweet. The beef variety (pictured above) contained a few slices of very tender stewed beef along with lots of unidentifiable bits, and the pork combined par-boiled pork and meatballs. Both contained a handful of par-boiled phak boong (sometimes known as &apos;morning glory&apos;, a green aquatic veggie), crispy rinds and a dose of blood. After a bowl of each (they&apos;re small and cost 15 baht) I cycled just up Thanon Chee Kun to Paa Lek (&apos;Aunt Lek&apos;), another recommended noodle joint. Paa Lek&apos;s noodles (pictured at the top of the post) were slightly more attractive, and judging by the crowd (and the wait) more popular, but I felt they lacked the intensity of the previous shop&apos;s. Sweet was the leading flavour here, and I&apos;m not a big fan of bean sprouts.

I&apos;ve previously mentioned roti sai mai , candy floss wrapped up in thin pancakes. On this trip I had my sights set on another Ayuthaya sweet fav, khanom babin :

 

Tiny pancakes of sticky rice flour and coconut meat. When done right they&apos;re just a tiny bit crispy on the outside, and soft and sticky on the inside. And they&apos;re usually not too sweet either (a rare trait among Thai sweets). Khanom babin can be found in abundance at the market located directly behind Wat Phramongkhon Bophit.

click on the image On my most recent trip I spent a week in three of Thailand&apos;s southernmost provinces: Songkhla, Pattani and Narathiwat. Due to a violent insurgency that&apos;s been brewing since 2004, there&apos;s not a lot of folks visiting these parts, but there&apos;s still a lot of interesting things to see...and eat.

Every big city in the south has a night market. Hat Yai&apos;s: featured a few stalls selling curries, grilled seafood and khanom jeen (fresh rice noodles served with curry). There were also several stalls selling kai thawt hat hai , Hat Yai-style fried chicken. However where it concerns the local dish, the residents I talked to consider Kai Tod Daycha, with three branches around town, the best: Hat Yai-style fried chicken differs from elsewhere in its spice-laden marinade, and Daycha served the eponymous bird over fragrant yellow rice, or with a side of som tam (papaya salad).

In addition to Muslim-style food, there are also lots of ethnic Chinese in the south, and at a cafe in Hat Yai I had a wonderful bowl of ba kut teh: pork ribs cooked in a herbal broth and served with sides of rice and deep-fried bits of dough. And yes, that&apos;s an entire head of garlic there in the broth.

Moving south, Pattani also has a much smaller, but still interesting night market serving a mix of Thai-Muslim and Chinese dishes: The city also has one of the most vibrant morning markets in the region: Most people in Pattani are ethnic Malays and there were more conversations in Yawi (a Malay dialect) than in Thai. In addition to language, breakfast is also very different in Thailand&apos;s deep south. Undoubtedly the most popular morning meal in these parts is khao yam (pictured at the top of this post), rice, often cooked with a type of purple flower, and topped with a bunch of finely-sliced herbs, roasted coconut, and a type of fish sauce called budu . The thin red strips are a kind of flower called dawk dala .

Another ubiquitous breakfast, especially in Muslim areas, is roti , a type of crispy pancake associated with Thai-Muslim cooking, and often served with a curry dip: Thai Muslims really love sweet food, and will often put a tablespoon of sugar or three into the dip. In fact, despite southern Thai food&apos;s reputation as the hottest regional cuisine in the country, I found that many dishes featured sweet as their leading flavour. In Songkhla they like a dish called tao khua : thin rice noodles and deep-fried crispy bits swimming in an insanely sweet sauce.

After a meal like that, I rarely felt a need for dessert, but really fell for khanom kho : These are soft balls of dough and coconut meat surrounding a tiny cube of raw sugar. The combination of the soft, fluffy outside and the crunchy inside was amazing.

click on the image You&apos;ve undoubtedly been re-directed here from RealThai, my former Thai food blog. Thai food fans don&apos;t despair just yet--all my previous entries have been moved here, and I&apos;m still living in Thailand and the bulk of my entries will continue to emphasize Thai eats. However, I&apos;m doing a lot more traveling these days and wanted a more general forum from which I can share my food discoveries. I also like the idea of a &apos;hub&apos; of my own work, and if you&apos;ve got the time to explore the site a bit, you&apos;ll also find a Photo Blog , my portfolio , as well as my Bio and a few examples of my published work.  Update your bookmarks and enjoy!

As some of you pointed out, the maps were written in Thai--not a great deal of help to most of the people who come here. Fortunately, in glancing at my Google Map today, it appears that it now includes both Thai and English. So, please take a look, click on whatever looks good, and hope this tool helps you find it!

click on the image I&apos;m currently on Ko Pha-Ngan, a beautiful island in southern Thailand. At the moment, the water is clear, the weather sunny and I&apos;m having a great time with old friends. There&apos;s only one downside: the food is bloody awful. Actually, that&apos;s a bit too strong. The food here isn&apos;t unsanitary, or rotten or even that badly prepared. It&apos;s just phenomenally bland. A boring, uninteresting approximation of Thai food for gastronomically timid foreigners. To make things even worse, every restaurant on Haad Yao seems to have the identical menu, and they staunchly refuse to vary from this. Among the more bizarre things that I&apos;ve been served is something called Haad Yao fried rice (pictured above), rice fried with ketchup and chicken, and wrapped in a thin omelet. You can opt for the classic Thai dishes, but unless you&apos;re a fan of limp, salty &apos;kana with garlic&apos;, greasy phat thai , or milky tom khaa , you&apos;re screwed.

Our only saving grace at this point has been a streetside som tam and grilled chicken stall about three kilometres up the road. The proprietor is from Buriram, and makes papaya salad just the way I like it: sour and spicy. If you go to the same area in the morning, you&apos;ll even find, believe it or not, authentic southern Thai food such as khanom jeen . Unfortunately a taxi ride there (actually a seat in the back of a truck) costs more than the meal, so what would be a dirt cheap meal anywhere else in the country becomes an exorbitant splurge here.

In a couple days I&apos;ll be crossing over to Ko Samui, home I&apos;m sure to even more quasi-Thai food, but also the location of Bangpo Seafood , a beachfront restaurant serving authentic Ko Samui-style Thai food that, despite having eaten there only once, I still count as one of my most memorable eating experiences in Thailand. Can&apos;t wait.

I have a big fat list of places I have to shoot, but the good thing about doing this job is when I come across something interesting I can usually just shoot away. This happened when I was taking photos of Na Thon, Samui&apos;s main port. It was sunset, and several ships had docked and were unloading fish: A bit later, the remaining natural light mixed with the fluorescent and tungsten lights of the boats to create a pretty cool effect: If you look closely, you can see that they are filling the boat with ice, which also added an interesting element to the pic.

click on the image I&apos;ve been on Ko Samui for almost a week now, and although finding real Thai food is not impossible, it can be something of a struggle. While on Lamai Beach I had a handsome meal of bangers and mash, was tempted to order pizza (&apos;Chef from Naples&apos;), and one night ate dinner at, uh... a Swedish restaurant (falukorv med stekt potatis och äkta svensk senap!). These were all satisfying, but I was still longing for something... local. I finally found it the next morning at Lamai&apos;s morning market. There I had a breakfast of sweet Thai tea with a Thai sweet (pictured above--name forgotten). Sweet, yes, but Thai. More to follow...

click on the image After several days on Ko Samui, I officially have no more reason to bitch about the lack of local eats. While staying on Lamai beach I discovered a stall at nearby Talat Dao that sells a variety of khanom jeen , curries served over fresh rice noodles.  This is possibly the most common dish in southern Thailand, and is served at all times of day or night. Khanom jeen can also be got in other parts of Thailand, but what makes it different down here are the types of curries served and the toppings. Southern Thais like their chili heat, and the innocent looking, typically yellowish curries you&apos;ll see here are some of the spiciest in the country. The one pictured above is called naam yaa plaa (pictured above), and is a fish and coconut milk-based curry particular to the south. As with all types of khanom jeen, when you order you&apos;ll simply get a shallow bowl with a handful of noodles and a ladleful of curry. It&apos;s your job to top it with the fresh herbs and veggies held in vast trays on the tables. These herbs typically include a couple kinds of basil, young cashew nut leaves, phak chee lawm (an herb almost identical to flat leaf parsley, pictured above) cucumbers, long beans and a couple types of pickled veggies. It&apos;s all for free and you simply take what you like, rip it all up and mix it into your noodles.

Another very southern type of khanom jeen is kaeng tai plaa , literally &apos;fish kidney curry&apos;: I think this curry, which also includes crispy bamboo, grilled fish, long beans, and a type of sweet potato-like local tuber, is about the spiciest thing humans were meant to consume. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, it&apos;s also extremely salty.  After eating it I was still feeling the burn a good 20 minutes later. Honestly though, it wasn&apos;t all that unpleasant. Have you ever eaten anything so spicy you actually felt a bit... well, high?

click on the image Throwing around superlatives can be a scary thing, but I think I&apos;m justified in this case. I&apos;ve been to many, many restaurants in Thailand, and have eaten some pretty amazing food, but Bangpo Seafood particularly stands out in my mind. I knew something was special about it after my first visit over a year ago, and wrote quite a few good things about it , but have always been keen to go back and see if the restaurant was really was as good as I thought.

Well, after two recent visits, my initial impression was right, and I think Bangpo Seafood just might be my favourite restaurant in Thailand.

This informal beachside restaurant located on the northern coast of Ko Samui serves the local dishes of the island. This means lots of seafood, including some unusual ingredients such as waay , a type of small octopus, sea urchin roe and flying fish. Coconuts, a major crop on Ko Samui, feature in several dishes, including khaao man , rice cooked in coconut milk with a pinch of salt and dried green beans. This is the house carb, and apparently was how people on Ko Samui used to prepare their rice. And as with southern Thai food in general, veggies also play a large role, especially in khoei jii : Shrimp paste pounded up with coconut meat, shallots, chilies and crab, smeared on the inside of a coconut shell then grilled over coals and served with local herbs such as young cashew tree leaves. This dish is given to everybody who walks in the door, and is far from being a throwaway appetizer. I&apos;d be more than happy with a few of these and the previously mentioned coconut rice.

The first dish I ordered was plaa hoop ping : Flying fish ( plaa nok en ) that is splayed, coated with a coconut milk/plack pepper/turmeric mixture, then grilled. The result is smokey, salty, oily--everything you&apos;d want in a fish dish. Yam saaraay : A Thai-style &apos;salad&apos; of a local variety of seaweed, which included sour mango and cockles, and oddly, peanuts.

The owner didn&apos;t exactly have to twist my arm to convince me to try two of Surat Thani&apos;s famous oysters: Served Thai style with accompaniments of naam phrik phao (a sweet/spicy chili sauce), lime, deep-fried crispy garlic and shallots, seafood dipping sauce and pungent krathin leaves. Despite how impressive they look, I found this the least interesting dish I ate at Bangpo Seafood. The oysters were simply too big, too tough, and had little flavour.

There was also plaa insee phat chaa : Mackerel stir-fried with fresh herbs. Very oily, as you can see, but the mixture of green peppercorns, krachai (Chinese key--a ginger-like root), garlic, Kaffir lime leaves and fresh fish was outstanding.

And these are just the dishes I ordered. While I was wondering how I could possibly consume all this, the owner&apos;s wife brought out a couple more dishes for me to try, including tom som waay : a soup of a kind of small octopus made sour by the addition of tender young tamarind leaves, as well as several tiny deep-fried fish that one eats in one go, head and all.

And you know what? Other than the oysters, it was all outstanding.

So if this isn&apos;t enough to convince you to hop on the next plane, I don&apos;t know what else I need to do. However, a brief word of warning: apparently in the same area there are a couple identically named restaurants serving inferior food. If you aim to go to this one, be sure to make certain that you&apos;re at Ta Khoe&apos;s (the owner, pictured at the top of the post) restaurant.

click on the image I’m currently in Tokyo, so this is what my curries will be looking like for the next few days. I love this city and am here taking photos at Tsukiji, the world-famous seafood market, for a magazine article. Will post some pics from that, as well as some of the fun food I had in Phuket just before coming here, soon.

In the meantime, do any of you who read this thing happen to live in Tokyo? I’ll be here until the 2nd and since the language barrier has largely limited me to eating things such as the above, I’d be more than willing to meet up for a real meal. My email can be found at my Bio/Contact page.

click on the image It didn&apos;t take me long to discover that, unless you&apos;re a fan of mediocre Swedish food or bland Thai/Asian, you&apos;ll find little of interest to eat on the island of Phuket. The exception to this was Phuket Town, by far the most interesting and atmospheric place on the island, and virtually forgotten by the hordes of tourists who cling to the beaches. I was surprised to find that many of the traditional dishes you&apos;ll find there are nearly identical to those of Penang . This may not come as a big surprise to those familiar with history though, as there was apparently a great deal of trade between Phuket and the former Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca and Singapore, and all of these areas were populated by similar Chinese ethnic groups.

And it is Chinese cuisine, often with a Southeast Asiann twist, that constitutes much of Phuket Town&apos;s traditional food. An example of this is mee hoon , a noodle dish known in Penang as bee hoon: As well as lor bak : Deep-fried porky savouries served with a dipping sauce almost identical to that which tops the Malaysian dish rojak. The bits at the top of the plate were nearly identical to hoy jor , and were really delicious.

There was pretty good dim sum: And another interesting dish of Chinese origin, although I don&apos;t recall having seen it in Penang, is something called oh taao : Somewhat similiar to hoy thawt or or suan , this dish combines chunks of taro, a batter, tiny oysters, egg, a deep red chili and a greenish garlic sauce, and my favourite part, crumbled bits of deep-fried pork rind!

There&apos;s a palpable Muslim influence in the city, and on several occasions I had some very tasty roti, both as a savoury breakfast (served with a small bowl of curry), or a sweet snack: Just outside the city, Ko Sireh is also home to the island&apos;s biggest fishing port: where every morning you can see heaps of interesting looking fish (and on one occasion, three very large sharks!) being unloaded. Not far from the fishing port I found a cool little cafe that served Thai-style coffee and lots of old-school sweets and snacks: Despite how the look, many of them were just as savoury as they were sweet, and made a wonderful breakfast.

And lastly, if you&apos;re looking for something a bit more formal, you can&apos;t go wrong with Siam Indigo : a restaurant housed in an beautiful 80 year old Sino-Portuguese building that does some excellent Thai, Thai-influenced and locally-influenced food.

While on a recent visit to Tokyo, I spent four mornings exploring and taking photos of Tsukiji, the world famous seafood market. The highlight of the market for many is the famous tuna auction, which in the last decade has actually become a huge tourist destination. During each of my visits there were at least a hundred or more visitors, standing in the way, taking photos (often with flash, although very large signs asked that people not do this), and posing with the fish. Tiny forklifts are constantly buzzing by at breakneck speed, and the floor is very slippery--clearly not a place for tourists. Being Japanese, the bidders and auctioneers involved in the market were typically polite, but I could sense their frustration. In recent years this madness has reached tipping point, and there&apos;s word that since April this part of the market should now be closed to tourists.

As shown above and below, there are several expansive rooms lined with fresh and frozen tuna: From about 5-6am the potential buyers carefully inspect the tuna, making notes: looking closely: and often tasting and smelling the tuna (spitting the meat out on the floor, to my surprise). When inspections are done, a bell rings and the auction takes place: The highest bidders take their wares off to the interior of the market to be cut and prepared: This was fascinating, but there&apos;s a lot more at Tsukiji than tuna. The entire market covers several cold and wet warehouses: encompassing virtually every kind of seafood imaginable, from beautiful shrimp: to crabs: and fish: Apparently the entire market is slated to move to another part of town in the next couple years, and will, I&apos;ve heard, not be as open as the current one.

click on the image Have you ever rented a car and driven to another province for a bowl of noodles? That&apos;s exactly what me, Hock and Andy did this weekend. Andy is the owner of Pok Pok , a popular Thai restaurant in Portland, Oregon, and is on something of a noodle research expedition across Asia. I offered to contribute to this scholarship by taking him to Lung Lek, a noodle shop in Ayuthaya. Hock was kind enough to drive, his expensive mobile phone providing both navigational support and musical entertainment.

Lung Lek (&apos;Uncle Lek&apos;) claims to have been making his unique &apos;boat-style&apos; noodles ( kuaytiaw ruea ) for 30 years now. I reckon he&apos;s just about got it down. I really the beef version: Unfortunately our first bowls were pretty mild, as seeing that we were not Thai, Lung Lek dumbed the flavours down, assuming we wouldn&apos;t be able to take the heat. Re-ordering brought us the bowl shown above. This type of noodle dish is called naam tok (&apos;waterfall&apos;) and usually includes a swirl of fresh blood, but Lung Lek adds a tablespoon of the liquid used to marinade his beef. Like other boat noodles, his broth is laden with dried spices, and has a dark colour. Unlike others, Lung Lek&apos;s noodles aren&apos;t sweet, and his broth is much richer.

Lung Lek&apos;s nearly half-century investment has proven worthwhile, in my opinion. Now if he&apos;d only put the ladle down for a day or two and consider improving the aesthetics of his restaurant (little more than rickety tables on a dirt floor under a ratty tarp). If he wishes to maintain some of the more rustic elements of the current restaurant he could could make the simple transition towards French Country , however I&apos;d suggest something a bit more radical like the Queen Anne-inspired whimsy of Raul Villares Gayan&apos;s Nouveau series.

click on the image Arguably Bangkok&apos;s most popular hawker stall, Naay Uan&apos;s recipe for success must lie in its simplicity. His kuay jap, a basic but delicious soup of of pork offal, thick rice noodles and broth draws literally hundreds of hungry diners to Chinatown every night: (For a larger version of this image go here .)

But that broth... Naay Uan&apos;s kuay jap broth is probably the most pepper-intense dish I&apos;ve ever consumed. The guy must pour bags of ground white pepper into his broth, leaving the diner with a mildly burning, spicy sensation. For me this is the highlight, but I think most people come for the meat, which includes your choice of pork heart, stomach, tongue or crispy deep-fried pork.

click on the image In 2006 Krua Apsorn was chosen as one of the Bangkok Post&apos;s Best Restaurants (see clip here ). Apparently members of the Thai royal family like to get their eat on here, and I&apos;ve noticed that David Thompson likes to recommend the second branch of the restaurant, located by the National Library, to visiting chefs and friends. Not surprisingly, the place is generally quite crowded and reservations are even recommended (!), but on the rainy Friday night we visited, Krua Apsorn was virtually empty.

We started with yellow curry with lotus stems and prawns (pictured above). I really enjoyed this dish. Having recently been in southern Thailand, which is where yellow curry comes from, I have had it lots lately, but think I prefer this version. Unlike in the south, where the dish is insanely spicy (and often even more insanely sour), this version had a balance of flavours. Another favourable difference is that the lotus stem was still crispy, unlike the typically soggy veggies in the more traditional version.

A laap of mushrooms: was pleasantly sour and rich with the earthy, smokey flavour of khaao khua , roasted ground rice.

Another somewhat unusual dish was pork fried with a curry paste made with a particular type of chili called phrik karieng and milk (as opposed to coconut milk): I particularly liked the simple but delicious stir-fry of gourd greens ( fak maew ) and a type of local flower ( dawk khajawn ): And finally, one of the restaurant&apos;s specialties, a round omelet with crab meat: Because of the Thai name, I expected this to have a lighter and fluffier texture. It was good, but a bit heavy on the egg and light on the crab.

In all, we had a very good, though not amazing, meal. I&apos;d definitely come again though, as the expansive and slightly unusual menu suggests that there&apos;s lots of interesting stuff in store. For another view of Krua Apsorn, check out this review at previously unknown Thai foodblogger and cookbook author, Oh Sirin .

Other than being a bizarre and boisterous part of town with great food and interesting stuff to see, I&apos;ve also been taking pics there with the intention of putting on an exhibition at Bangkok&apos;s Kathmandu Photo Gallery early next year.

After countless visits, I&apos;ve sat down with the results and have rounded them down to 22 images that I like (at least for now). I haven&apos;t been shooting with a specific &apos;theme&apos; in mind, but have been partially inspired by Khun Manit&apos;s (the owner of Kathmandu, and a well known Thai photographer) comments that the early images I showed him seemed to depict the relationship that the residents of Chinatown have with their space--typically their lack of it and the way the deal with this. Some of the pics below are an effort to explore this theme, while others are simply interesting images. It&apos;s a big blog entry, I know, but I&apos;d appreciate if any of you could sit down for a few minutes, take look at the images and give me some feedback, in particular, which images you reckon I shouldn&apos;t include, and why.

click on the image After all this time, it looks like Thailand is set to get to be what appears to be a premium, domestically-made, and if the Gods are kind, drinkable beer: Federbräu. Brewed somewhat surreptitiously by ThaiBev (the brewers of Beer Chang) in Ayuthaya, the beer is a Blond Lager and contains 4.7% alcohol. Interestingly, many of the sites and blogs, not to mention the beer label itself, seem to make a point of mentioning that Federbräu is brewed following the famous Reinheitsgebot, ensuring its purity. But on a tour of a Singha Brewery a few years ago, the German-educated brewmaster ensured me that despite how it sometimes tastes, Singha also contains only water, barley, hops and yeast. Well, Singha had its chance, and iff they can get it right with Federbräu, I&apos;ll be switching loyalties very soon.

click on the image I&apos;ve mentioned Yusup, a Muslim restaurant on the northern outskirts of Bangkok, many , many times. The restaurant&apos;s rich curries, amazing biryani , and wonderfully sour soups have made it just about my favourite all-around restaurant in Bangkok. I&apos;d love to see more people eat there, but the restaurant is located quite far outside central Bangkok and is something of an ordeal to find. Well, gone now are the days of excuses: armed with Google Maps , you should have no problem in locating Yusup.

I stopped by Yusup for lunch today with a companion and ordered several things, including the dish pictured above, kuruma with roti. I prefer their goat kuruma, but they were out of it so we had to settle for chicken: Regardless of the protein, the curry is almost impossibly rich and thick, chock fulla dried spices and fresh herbs, and packing a sour bite akin to a vindaloo.
My companion ordered kaeng karii kai , Muslim-style chicken curry, over rice: The curry is lightly spiced, probably not much more than tinned curry powder, and includes thick chunks of potato, tomato and onion. It&apos;s served with ajaat , a side of sliced cucumbers, chilies and shallots in a sweet/sour vinegar dressing.

Together we picked at mataba nuea : A roti stuffed with beef, a few basic veggies and egg, also served with ajaat .

And for dessert? You guessed it--more roti: this time drizzled with sweetened condensed milk and liberally sprinkled with sugar.

How to get there:
The restaurant is located in northern Bangkok along the Kaset-Navamin highway (also known as sen tat mai ). If you’re coming from Mor Chit BTS along Th Phaholyothin, turn right at the Kaset Intersection onto the Kaset-Navamin highway. Go past the first stop light and the restaurant is on the left side just after a very large sign with the Swiss flag (as well as several Thai-language signs advertising the restaurant). If you get lost, go ahead and try one of the mobile numbers above, but I’m pretty sure these people don’t speak English.

Last weekend on Ko Samet this meant sticky rice, grilled chicken and many, many dishes of som tam (a salad of unripe papaya): The food is sold from mobile vendors, also from the northeast, who prepare both the som tam and grilled chicken from mobile basket kitchens: At one point we ordered so much chicken that At had to lend a hand to the grilling process: It wasn&apos;t all northeastern food though. At a restaurant in Baan Phe we had a decent dish of puu phat phong karii , crab sauteed with egg and curry powder: and at a restaurant in Rayong, a nice yam of raw scallops: There were some culinary lowpoints, however, such as An An&apos;s box of cream-filled Doraemon-shaped cookies: Pics taken with my D100 (my beach camera) without any editing in Photoshop.

click on the image Yet another restaurant located way out in the wasteland of northern Bangkok, but after four recent visits, I reckon it&apos;s worth the drive. For starters, Crokmai Thai Lao has one of the most extensive menus of any isaan/Lao restaurant I&apos;ve been to in Thailand. It has a full page dedicated to insects: Another page of the menu is entirely dedicated to dishes using ant eggs. Crokmai Thai Lao must also be among the few isaan/Lao restaurants anywhere with a website: www.crokmaithailao.com .  Check it out; you can even see the entire menu , including many photos, scanned into the page, and of course the obligatory page of celebrities who&apos;ve visited the restaurant . I&apos;ve been told the guy in the red hat with the microphone always wears red hats. Very heady stuff. Rest assured though, it&apos;s not all fancy technology  and famous people--this place does some pretty good food.

Crokmai means &apos;wooden mortar&apos;, the tool used to make som tam , so naturally there was a dish of the famous papaya salad (pictured above), made here Lao-style with plaa raa and salted crabs.  Sour and extremely spicy. There was kaeng poerh (I really have no idea how to transliterate this last word--it sounds a lot like someone spitting bad soup out): This soup combines a dark broth (the result, I believe, of the addition of bai yaanaang , a leaf), thin slices of crispy bamboo, mushrooms, pumpkin and my favourite bit, a pungent herb called cha om (the green leaves seen above). I&apos;ve had this dish at restaurants and even at peoples&apos; homes, and reckon this bowl is among the tastiest and most balanced I&apos;ve had.

Another great dish was mok nor mai : bamboo stuffed (or combined?) with ground pork and a very coconutty curry paste mixture, wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed.  Almost creamy in texture, and despite the disparate ingredients, a wonderful combination. Naam phrik plaa raa : Good, but not outstanding. The naam phrik , a &apos;dip&apos; of Lao-style fish sauce was tasty, but watery. I liked the combination of veggies  though, including steamed pumpkin and some edible flowers.

And every time I eat here I have to order plaa som thot : Freshwater fish that has been fermented via some rice and deep-fried.  Sour, cripsy and meaty.

I recommend a visit, be it physically or virtually .

click on the image I&apos;ve spent the last couple weeks upcountry, first in Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son, then on a long drive along the west bank of the Mekong River all the back to Bangkok. While in Chiang Mai I really wanted to stop by a place that I&apos;d eaten at years before, a late-night joint selling a variety of deep-fried meats and northern-style naam phrik or chili-based &apos;dips&apos;.

The place, which doesn&apos;t even open until about 11pm, is known among some as midnight naam phrik num, although I don&apos;t think it officially has a name. The image above doesn&apos;t even begin to describe it. The oil used to deep-fry virtually everything they serve is black and sludgelike--I reckon it hadn&apos;t been changed in several days, at least. The dining section of the restaurant alters between dark and intensely florescent-lit, and is the favourite haunt of a family selling flower garlands. Despite all this, the place is something of a Chiang Mai legend, and if you can temporarily put aside fears of carcinogens, avoid eye contact the horribly messy, oil-splattered &apos;kitchen&apos;, and prepare yourself for the gloomy atmosphere, the food here is actually pretty tasty.

Although the emphasis appears to be on deep-frying, the real deal here are the dips, of which there are two kinds: nam phrik num , made from grilled green chilies pounded up with grilled garlic and shallots: and another called n am phrik taa daeng (&apos;red-eye chili paste), made from dried red chilies. The former, pictured above, is one of the better versions I&apos;ve had of this dish, and was spicy but balanced, with delicious tiny cloves of tender garlic. The latter employed a strong shrimp paste and had a sweet flavour, resulting in a flavour not unlike the dressing used to top the Malay/Indonesian dish rojak. Both dips are served with a small plate of par-boiled and pickled veggies for dipping, and your choice of meats. These range from sai ua , the famous northern Thai herb-filled sausage (grilled, mercifully), to vast chunks of deep-fried pork fat. No, that&apos;s not a typo. And yes, it&apos;s actually pretty good, especially with the nam phrik num. All the meats are deep-fried once, presumably in the previously-mentioned vat of sludge. When you order something, they deep-fry it again in a smaller and slightly less black pot of oil until hot and crispy. I also had an interesting dish of naaem , raw fermented pork sausage, combined with an egg, wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled.

The restaurant is located approximately two blocks south of the Imperial Mae Ping Hotel. If you ask about for the midnight naam phrik num you&apos;ll inevitably be pointed in the right direction.

click on the image This market, located behind Chiang Mai University, is probably the first Thai market I ever became familiar with. I was studying Thai at the university, and the market was a short walk from my apartment, also located lang mor (&apos;behind the university&apos;). I&apos;d walk there to buy prepared food, and my first attempts at cooking Thai food were made with ingredients bought here. I still use the wok I bought there back in 1999. At the time I assumed Talaat Ton Phayom was like any typical market anywhere in Thailand. It wasn&apos;t until I learned more about Thai food and came back to the market later that I realized how local this market is. The vast majority of food sold there is specific to northern Thailand, and even as far as Chiang Mai markets go, this one is defiantly northern. The northerners&apos; love of pork is very evident at Talaat Ton Phayom. There&apos;s heaps of sai ua , the famous herb-packed northern Thai sausage: as well as several vendors selling deep-fried pork rinds: and of course, naam phrik num to dip them in: There&apos;s also less traditional protein, such as rot duan : literally &apos;express train&apos;, worms that have been deep-fried.

The food in northern Thailand is more seasonal than elsewhere in the country, and during the rainy season you&apos;ll find lots of mushrooms: For a slide show of the entire set of images, go here.

click on the image Laap , minced meat mixed with roasted rice, lime juice, fresh herbs and fresh chili, has its origins in northeast Thailand and Laos, and is a dish known well outside the region. Laap as it&apos;s served in northern Thailand is an entirely dish altogether and is virtually unknown outside of the region. The most popular type among locals, laap khom , literally &apos;bitter laap&apos; combines minced raw meat, typically beef, mixed with a curry paste and bitter bile from the stomach of a cow. It&apos;s easy to see why laap khom isn&apos;t going to be the next molten chocolate cake . I tend to stick with the &apos;safe&apos; version, laap khua , &apos;fried laap&apos;. This version takes basically the same ingredients, but with the addition of some very unique dried spices and bit of offal, and sees them fried and topped with crispy deep-fried garlic and green onion. Both kinds of northern-style laap are served with a small dish of tiny cloves of garlic and fresh chilies, and a plate of fresh veggies and herbs, many of which are unknown outside of northern Thailand, and which possess bitter flavours.

The laap khua pictured above is from Laap Khom Huay Puu, a tiny restaurant just outside Pai, Mae Hong Son, that specialises in the dish.  Theirs is my personal favourite version. The pork laap, shown above, is rich with the flavour of two local dried herbs, makwaen and diiplii , which add a bitter/hot flavour not unlike Szechuan pepper. Karen at Rambling Spoon goes into more detail on these unique spices here . The pork version of the dish uses a somewhat dry chili paste containing a slightly different spectrum of herbs and spices than the more paste-like one used for the beef version. I&apos;m not sure if the cow bile, dii wua , is added to the pork version as it is to the beef version. Served with a big basket of warm sticky rice and a plate of herbs, it&apos;s one of my favourite meals in Thailand.

Laap Khom Huay Puu makes a total of about four, all meat-based dishes, including a pretty good beef soup: The restaurant is located about two kilometres outside Pai along the way to Mae Hong Son.

click on the image Tucked into the far northwestern corner of Thailand, remote Mae Hong Son is known more for its windy roads and Burmese-style temples than its food, but there&apos;s actually some pretty interesting stuff to eat here. One of my favourite places in the city is Baan Phleng. Baan Phleng does excellent northern Thai and local Shan (an ethnic group related to the Thais that largely live in neighbourning Burma) food, including several dishes you&apos;d probably be hard-pressed to find just about anywhere else in Thailand. During the day, you simply walk up to the glass under the zinc fretwork and point to whatever looks tasty of the 15+ prepared dishes. In the evenings, seating moves across the street to a garden and dishes are available a la carte from an expansive menu that also includes helpful descriptions of the dishes (unfortunately only in Thai).

We started with a very northern Thai (and oft-mentioned on these pages) dish of naam phrik num (pictured above), probably the only truly Thai dish of the meal. The grilled chili paste was served with fresh and steamed veggies and two types of pork rinds. This was accompanied by baskets of sticky rice and several other sides, including a delicious yam or Thai-style salad of phak koot , tender fern shoots: The shoots had been par-boiled but remained crispy, and the salad was held together with a simple Burmese-style curry paste and topped with heaps of crispy fried garlic, as well as roasted sesame seeds, a specialty of the Mae Hong Son area which is often made into oil.

There was lung jin , Shan for meatballs: Although they were made from fish, they&apos;re chock fulla fresh herbs and taste a lot like sai ua , the well known northern Thai sausage. Another local dish was a tasty Shan-style yam or salad made from tofu: And to round off our almost entirely Burmese meal, we also had a bowl of kaeng hang ley : This curry dish is found all over northern Thailand, but is probably Burmese in origin (hang is almost certainly a corruption of hin , the Burmese word for curry). Hang ley usually uses thick cuts of muu saam chan (&apos;three levels of pork&apos;--ie a belly cut including skin, fat and meat), but they forgot the other two levels and the dish was mostly fat. It was still pretty good though, with a thick curry broth that was a lot like a rich American-style barbecue sauce mixed with slivers of fresh ginger.

click on the image Besides some great lunch and dinner places in and around Mae Hong Son (one more of which I&apos;ll profile soon), there&apos;s also some interesting stuff to be had at breakfast and in the evenings. In the mornings, the city&apos;s market is by far the best place to fuel up: There you&apos;ll find several basic stalls selling everything from generic Thai breakfasts such as rice porridge to local Shan specialties such as khanom jeen naam ngiaw , fresh rice noodles served with a light pork broth. Amongst the same knot of vendors as the latter, you&apos;ll also find the dish pictured at the top of this post, an odd combination of a type of solidified soy bean paste and deep-fried tofu that the locals told me is a relatively new introduction from Burma. It&apos;s made by slicing hearty chunks of the bean &apos;pudding&apos;: and chunks of deep-fried tofu, and topping the whole lot with garlic oil, deep fried crispy garlic, tamarind juice, fish sauce, soy sauce, MSG, sesame seeds and dried chilies. A little odd, but actually not that bad. Things get really weird when the hot liquid soy bean stuff is poured over fresh rice noodles, resulting in a gooey, stringy mixture.

Every evening a market sets up directly in front of Wat Chong Kham: During the tourist season, there are several vendors selling everything from som tam to local sweets. We arrived during the off season when there&apos;s a lot less for sale, although you can still find a couple people selling khang pong , a Shan dish of fried papaya fritters, generously spiced with chili and dried turmeric: As well as a few vendors selling the previously-mentioned khanom jeen and Shan-style khao soi . Update : Flickr user meemalee claims that the tofu-like ingredient mentioned above is made from gram, not soybean flour. She provides a link to this Wikipedia entry , which provides all the details. Thanks, meemalee!

click on the image Long known as the city&apos;s most upscale market, Or Tor Kor Market is also probably my favourite place to shop in Bangkok. This has nothing to do with its chi-chi reputation; I&apos;ve been shopping here since I moved to Bangkok in the late 90&apos;s, and the market has a great selection of just about everything, from high-quality ingredients to a decent dish of curry. It&apos;s relatively close to my house, and after a thorough renovation about three years ago, is now cleaner, better organized and more well-lit than ever. I&apos;ve mentioned the market quite a few times on these pages, but have never really done blog specifically about it. I&apos;m hoping to follow this up with profiles of some of Bangkok&apos;s other significant markets in the coming weeks.

Or Tor Kor is mostly known for its giant--and often expensive--fruit, but you can pick up just about anything there, including veggies from this couple who&apos;ve been selling at the market just as long as I can remember: Tourists in particular are drawn to Or Tor Kor&apos;s selection of insanely immense shellfish, but at a markedly less impressive stall, Mr Sanyaa has been selling freshwater fish, the majority from the northern province of Nakhorn Sawan, for more than 10 years. He&apos;s incredibly enthusiastic about his products, voluntarily lifting and explaining the pedigree of each, and claims to sell only freshly caught (not raised) fish, including this meaty plaa buek (giant Mekong catfish): If you&apos;re in no mood to cook, there&apos;s lots of prepared food you can take home delicious hor mok , steamed curries (shown at the top of this post) which, as shown above, tend to sell out pretty quickly, or a bag of curry to go from Mae Malee, an incredibly popular and longstanding curry stall just across the way: If you can&apos;t wait until you make it home, there are lots of snacks too. Mr Tii has been making and selling his tasty khanom khrok , crispy coconut puddings, at Or Tor Kor for more than 25 years now: He reckons the renovation has made the market better and has even improved his sales, as he&apos;s not located on the outermost edge any more. Mr Tii also claims that despite the rise in rent that came as a result of the renovation, most of the same vendors have remained and still sell their stuff at Or Tor Kor.

If you like Thai sweets, there are some delicious sticky rice treats: and khanom taan , cornbread-like cakes of steamed palm sugar at Khanomthai Kao Peenong, a family-owned Thai sweets vendor that dominates the centre of the market.

You can also stop by Or Tor Kor for lunch or dinner, although there are better places in town to sit down to a meal, and anyway, there are never enough seats during the lunchtime rush. One reliable stall is Rot Det, whose tremendous variety of curries, soups and stir-fries have been available at Or Tor Kor for &apos;only about 10 years&apos; according to one worker: For a larger version of this image go here . Steps away from Rot Det, I came across a stall I had never seen before, selling kung op woon sen , shrimp and glass noodles: I had never noticed it before because it was new; less than a week old, confessed the owner. After recently graduating from a professional cooking course at Kasetsart University, she and her husband (and baby) decided to open up a stall at the market. Her take was deliciously peppery, but as she used margarine instead of the more traditional pork fat (a result of her Western-style cooking education, she explained), it lacked the richness I normally associate with kung op woon sen.

Another reason to visit the market is the abundance of regional Thai food. There at least four stalls selling various products from Thailand&apos;s north, and at least three stalls selling southern Thai food, including Jiap&apos;s, whose Phuket-style naam yaa pak tai , a fish-based coconut curry that is by far the mildest of all her excruciatingly spicy dishes, is pretty good: The food of Thailand&apos;s northeast is represented by Sut Jai Kai Yaang, a stall (with an nearby, but noisy restaurant), that has served som tam and grilled chicken at Or Tor Kor for more than 30 years now: They sell do-it-yourself som tam kits with everything you&apos;d need (except the mortar and pestle--but those can also be bought nearby), something I&apos;d never seen elsewhere.

In recent years, I&apos;ve tended to visit Or Tor Kor primarily for its handsome branch of the Doi Kham or Royal Projects store, located directly east of the market. There you can get high-quality, Western-style produce grown in northern Thailand for ridiculously cheap. A recent visit revealed hard-to-find items such as sweet lemons, Italian parsley, rhubarb and smoked trout. At the west end of the market is another shop selling similar products from a different project; they have tiny bottles of wonderfully creamy goat milk and on occasion, a decent liver pate.

click on the image From Chiang Mai, I decided to go back home the long way: over to Chiang Rai, then back to Bangkok along Thailand&apos;s length of the Mekong River. The vast majority of this trip took place in isaan, Thailand&apos;s rural northeast, which food-wise, normally inspires thoughts of sticky rice, som tam and grilled chicken. However the residents of the Mekong region love their Vietnamese food. I had heard this before, but was not prepared for just how completely ubiquitous and utterly delicious Vietnamese food was. In Nakhorn Phnom, for example, there were three Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance of each other, but not a sticky rice steamer or mortar and pestle to be seen. I&apos;m going to profile some of these dishes and restaurants in the next couple blogs, beginning with this amazing restaurant in Nong Khai.

Mae Ut told me her mother was originally from Hanoi. She learned her recipes from her when she was young, and has making them in the same location for more than 40 years: Her son, pictured above, lends a hand, and they&apos;re both extremely kind and enthusiastic about their food, taking the time to describe to me the dishes I wasn&apos;t familiar with. This didn&apos;t take a great deal of time, as Mae Ut only makes about four different things. Naturally I decided to have three of them.

I started with khanom paak mor (pictured at the top of this post), known elsewhere in Thailand as khaao kriap paak mor , and in its country of origin as bánh cuốn. It&apos;s a freshly-steamed noodle, filled with a ground pork mixture, topped with deep-fried crispy shallots and served with sides of muu yor , a Vietnamese-style pork sausage, a sweet/sour dipping sauce, and a vast plate of fresh veggies and herbs. This dish is sometimes available at Vietnamese restaurants in Bangkok, but Mae Ut&apos;s version was heads and shoulders above anything I&apos;ve ever had here, and might even be tastier than the bánh cuốn I had in Hanoi . The noodle was soft and almost egg-like, and the filling was deliciously savoury and peppery. The muu yor was among the better I&apos;ve had, and the dipping sauce was balanced, unlike versions in Bangkok which tend to be sweet, or versions in Hanoi, which I often found varyingly too sweet or too sour. My only complaint would be Mae Ut&apos;s herbs, which although diverse, weren&apos;t as fresh as they could possibly be.

I followed this with deep-fried spring rolls, known in this part of Thailand as miang thot : Unlike pawpia , typical Thai spring rolls, miang thot wrappers are clear and shatteringly crispy, and the ground pork and veggie filling nearly spicy from the copious white pepper, and if I&apos;m not mistaken, a very slight cumin flavour. The dipping sauce for this dish was slightly different than that of the previous dish and included ground peanuts, but was still balanced and delicious.

My final dish, ban baew (from, I believe, the Vietnamese bánh bèo ) , was the most unusual: It took thick, coin-sized rounds of noodle and topped them with pork floss, crumbled pork rinds, crispy deep-fried shallots, and a sweet/sour dipping sauce, slightly different than the one accompanying the other dishes. I&apos;m not a big fan of the sweet flavour of pork floss, so this was my least favourite dish.

Friendly proprietors, simple but excellent food and great old-school atmosphere; hands down one of the best meals I&apos;ve had in Thailand in a long time. Unfortunately I&apos;ll probably never be able to eat Vietnamese in Bangkok again...

click on the image Khai katha , literally &apos;pan eggs&apos;, is a dish I came across in virtually every Thai town that bordered the Mekong River. It&apos;s apparently a Vietnamese take on fried eggs for breakfast, although I don&apos;t recall having seen it there.  The eggs, fried up in a tiny aluminum pan (the katha ), are supplemented with thin slices of kun chiang (Chinese sausage), muu yor (Vietnamese sausage), sliced green onions, and unusually for Thailand, ground black pepper. The dish is also accompanied by bread, which at the better places, takes the form of a freshly-toasted French-style baguette (although it must be said that the Thai ones are nowhere near as good as their Vietnamese and Cambodian counterparts).

The khai katha above is from Nong Khai, where after meeting it for the first time by the city&apos;s morning market, noticed the dish just about everywhere on the drive back to my hotel. Khai katha is big in Nong Khai. The bread shown in the background is a half-arsed Thai attempt at bánh mì, a Vietnamese-style sandwich, but included a few thin slices of the previously-mentioned sausages and little more.

Another version in the town of That Phnom, in Nakhorn Phnom province, was more like an omelet: Rather than the muu yor they used cheap hotdogs and ground pork, and in place of the French-style bread, toasted white bread. It was a low point in my khai katha experience.

Undeterred, I bought two katha in Mukdahan, and since returning home have been making the dish for breakfast nearly every day, using tasty free-range eggs, muu yor from Ubon Ratchathani and decent French bread from La Boulange , and have refrained from cooking the hell out of the eggs.

click on the image Mukdahan is probably the least known and quietest of Thailand&apos;s large cities located along the Mekong. Despite this, it had one of the region&apos;s best night markets: It was surprisingly large for such a small town, and despite being firmly rooted in rural northeastern Thailand, Vietnamese food was just about everywhere.

A couple stalls sold this previously unseen specialty: Pig legs stuffed with a pork and mushroom mixture. Sliced into disks and served as an appetizer, it was deliciously rich and savoury, almost like a pate.

Another unique dish was ban daa , shown at the top of this post. The dish takes the steamed noodle I&apos;ve mentioned previously, but mixes it with a beaten egg and slaps a crispy sesame-laden rice cracker on top: Bizarre, but actually truly wonderful--crunchy, hot and soft--it&apos;s a real texture experience. I&apos;ve seen a similar dish elsewhere, but according to the vendor, the egg version is only available around Mukdahan.

Another stall sold naem nuang (Vietnamese: nem nướng): skewers of grilled pork that are eaten wrapped in tiny squares of rice paper along with sour fruits, copious herbs and a sweet sauce. Far less meaty than those sold in Bangkok, the pork was also freshly grilled and still had that wonderfully smoky flavour.

click on the image Nong New, a stall in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, specialises in a few dishes that you&apos;re more than likely to run into in this part of town: birds&apos; nest and shark fin soup. I&apos;ve had bird nest soup a couple times, and find it too sweet for my taste. And shark fin soup is a ridiculous dish that&apos;s more superstition than cuisine. But there&apos;s still reason to visit Nong New&apos;s stall; he&apos;s known for making some of the best phat mee hong kong , &apos;Hong Kong-style fried noodles&apos;, in the area: This dish, which one could best describe as deliciously bland, combines thin round wheat noodles with exceedingly fresh and tasty shrimp, crab meat, chicken breast and dried mushrooms, not to mention a variety of sauces and flavourings, ranging from what looked like oyster sauce to Chinese dark vinegar.  Nong New (shown at the top of this post) takes great care in preparing his noodles, at times judiciously mixing the contents with a small metal spatula, and at other times simply grabbing the wok with a towel and tossing the ingredients in the air by hand. This results in a dish that&apos;s not only balanced and delicious, but at 100B (about $2.50 US), also the most expensive mee phat hong kong in the area.

Having never been to Hong Kong, I was wondering if this dish, or something similar to it, can actually be found there?

click on the image In reading Suthon Sukphisit&apos;s excellent Cornucopia column, which runs every Saturday in the Bangkok Post , I was reminded of a Vietnamese market that takes place every Sunday morning off Th Samsen. Considering that my last few posts have been decidedly Vietnam-oriented, I figured a visit and a blog wouldn&apos;t be out of place here and now.

The market unfolds in an area known locally as Baan Yuan (&apos;Vietnam Town&apos;) directly behind the St Francis Xavier Church. According to Suthon, the area has been inhabited by people of Vietnamese origin for more than 200 years. Other than the Catholic church, today there&apos;s little to indicate that the area is any different from any other riverside community in Bangkok. However a close look at the neighbourhood&apos;s Sunday market reveals its Vietnamese origins.

It&apos;s a small market that appears to thrive on the after-service rush at about 10am or so: A couple stalls sell ingredients imported from Vietnam or used exclusively in Vietnamese cooking: including several varieties of muu yor , the ubiquitous steamed pork sausage, tiny baguettes from Nong Khai, jars of coarsely ground black pepper, and the rice noodles and rice paper wrappers used in various Vietnamese dishes.

If you come hungry there are also a few prepared dishes, including khao kriap paak mor, shown at the top of this post.  As mentioned previously, this dish takes a freshly-steamed noodle: and fills it with a pork and herb mixture and serves it with a spicy/sour dipping sauce. A variation on this, known as ban daa , and previously mentioned here , takes the steamed noodle and puts it in a crispy rice cracker: I liked the khao tom yuan , a thick fish (or chicken) based soup with round, squiggly noodles: I also liked the khanom bueang yuan , the famous Vietnamese stuffed crepe: although, in rather un-Vietnamese fashion the dish was served without fresh veggies and herbs.

Other dishes include deep-fried spring rolls, Vietnamese-style roast pig (unfortunately sold out when I arrived) and a shop at the middle of Soi 11 that appeared to sell some tasty-looking naem nueang .

click on the image As the painfully obvious name (&apos;Phat Thai House&apos;) suggests, this is indeed a phat thai restaurant, but there are no noodles in today&apos;s post. Rather, walking by this tiny shophouse restaurant in Olde Bangkok, I was drawn to the vast array of ingredients used to make khao khluk kapi , rice cooked in shrimp paste and served with a vast array of toppings. This is one of my favourite Thai dishes, and as it seems to be little-known among visitors to Thailand, I&apos;ve been working tirelessly to promote it, with previous mentions here , here and here .

And I&apos;m lucky I decided to stop by, as Baan Phat Thai&apos;s khao khluk kapi, pictured at the top of this post, is one of the better I&apos;ve tasted. Here&apos;s the proprietor assembling a dish, with the reflection of Sino-Portuguese shopfronts along Th Mahanop in the background: Baan Phat Thai is a Muslim restaurant, so rather than muu waan (sweet pork), beef is used. Other ingredients include, starting at 12 o&apos;clock and moving clockwise, a garlicky-salty-dried shrimp mixture similar to a dry sambal belacan; am omelet that has been sliced into thin strips; beef braised in palm sugar and fish sauce; thinly sliced long bean; lime; cucumber; sliced shallots; shredded sour mango. Whew. The rice itself was rich and savoury, and lacked the oil that many weaker versions of this dish have.

Excellent, and more incentive to try the phat thai on my next visit, I reckon.

And yes, I know exactly what you&apos;re thinking, so here goes: a recipe for khao khluk kapi in Swedish .

The recipient of a recently-finished makeover culminating in a fresh coat of paint, new tiles and a rather garish sign, Nang Loeng Market is hardly looking its 100+ years. However, in all honesty, the label &apos;market&apos; is a bit of misnomer here. The Nang Loeng of today resembles something more of a food court than a fresh market, and the main hall is dominated not by piles of greens or still-flapping fish, but rather by stalls selling prepared dishes: For larger version of this image, go here . At lunch the market is packed with hungry employees from the surrounding area; come at virtually any other time and you&apos;re likely to have the entire place to yourself.

My favourite stall at Nang Loeng, and among the most popular, is a curry vendor called Ratana: I&apos;ve blogged on this stall previously , and on every consecutive visit, seem to find some unusual dish. My most recent meal revealed a bizarre soup combining pork leg and peanuts. I continue to find their slightly dry green curry (made with a spicy, but not hot -spicy, homemade curry paste) among the most delicious in town.

At virtually every stall other than Ratana, Nang Loeng epitomises old-school/central Thai flava, meaning you&apos;ll find two things in abundance: noodles and sugar. The former was present in a bowl of kuaytiaw khae , fishball noodles, from the stall pictured at the top of this post: Despite the vendor&apos;s experience (&apos;couple decades&apos;, I was told) and confidence-inspiring old-school stall, it turned out to be a pretty normal bowl of noodles with handmade, although underwhelming fishballs.

Sugar and noodles were present in just about everything else I consumed. They reached an almost harmonious junction in an old-school Thai dish called mee kathi : Thin rice noodles (coloured yellow with food colouring, &apos;To make them look more delicious,&apos; according to the vendor) topped with tofu, dried shrimp and a thick coconut milk-mushroom-ground pork dressing. In theory a savoury dish, but boasting enough sweetness to border on dessert, for me at least. The dish is what I imagine much of Thai food, in particular that of Bangkok and the surrounding provinces, used to taste like in the not-so-distant past. Not surprisingly, the vendor, who looked at least 70, claims to have been making this dish since she was a child. She told me that she used to use crab meat, but finds it too expensive now.

Another dish that combined sweet flavours and noodles was the hard to find kuaytiaw kaeng , &apos;curry noodles&apos;: This the beef version, which also included bits of tofu and a hard-boiled egg and a thick curry broth not unlike the sweet, peanuty dipping sauce that accompanies satay.

Not surprisingly, given the emphasis on the sweet, Nang Loeng is also known for its Thai desserts, such as these photogenic sticky rice with various toppings: And as if this wasn&apos;t enough to rot your teeth, Nang Loeng is also something of a depot for sugarcane juice: The fresh stalks are squeezed of their juice in a dark room just outside the market, before being bottled and loaded into carts to be sold on the streets of Bangkok.

Being a fan of salty, rather than sweet flavours, I must admit that I like Nang Loeng more for its old-school atmosphere: than its food, but it&apos;s still worth a visit if you&apos;re never been, or at not least since the renovation.

click on the image At Phonsavan&apos;s evening market. I recently spent two weeks in Laos, taking photos and gathering information for two separate articles on food and travel. I was primarily occupied with these two topics until while in Luang Prabang I happened to run into Magnum photographer Abbas . Talking to him about his work, I was inspired to go back through the pics I had taken that didn&apos;t necessarily have to do with my work. There&apos;s little in common with Abbas&apos; work (he&apos;s doing a long-term project on Buddhism), and no single unifying theme, but rather the images below are simply those that I find interesting.

click on the image This may sound like a macabre title for blog post, but anybody who&apos;s been to a Buddhist funeral in Southeast Asia knows the events take a decidedly different form here. For starters, funerals in this part of the world are more like family reunions, and are generally festive, rather than dour in atmosphere. They can often last several days, depending on the family&apos;s budget. And most importantly, like much of life in Southeast Asia, they tend to revolve around food.

I learned this firsthand while walking the streets of Luang Prabang, in northern Laos. I was searching for images to illustrate an article on Lao food, when I came across a funeral entering its fifth day. A man of 82 had died, and directly in front of the house in which he grew up, his relatives and people who knew him had erected a tent and were busy cooking.

It truly was a communal affair, at least among the women, and everybody pitched in, including neighbours, neighbours&apos; relatives visiting from America, and sometimes people who just happened to walk by: Those not able to help in the more physical parts of preparation simply dished out the final product: in this case, a thick coconut curry called khua kai .

When a meal, usually consisting of four different dishes, sides of fresh herbs and veggies, and sticky rice, was completed, the dishes were put on trays then laid out to be consumed: Between meals everybody snacked on miang laao : A variety of toppings ranging from pork crackling to garlic that are put in a leaf, topped with a salty/sour sauce, and popped in the mouth.

Among the dishes made in the three days I visited the funeral were an herb-filled omelet, a laap -like pork dish, and because it was in season, several dishes revolving around bamboo, including a clear soup (pictured at the top of this post), and a delicious stir-fry of crispy bamboo, egg and ground pork: Below is the recipe for saem , an eggplant and pork dish that I was able to watch being made from beginning to end. I was told by the people making it that the dish can only be found in Luang Prabang, and is among a repertoire of dishes often served at funerals and other occasions.

I&apos;ve failed to include amounts here simply because the women themselves didn&apos;t measure anything; like most recipes in this part of the world the cooking was done entirely by taste, feel and experience. The dish is pictured at the top of this post at about 4 o&apos;clock, and below.

Saem: Pork and eggplant &apos;salad&apos; Making saem

-Boiled pork liver and belly, sliced thinly
-Lao fish sauce ( paa daek )
-Rice cakes ( khao khop )
-Young, round purple eggplants (ideally w/out seeds), boiled until soft and peeled
-Ground pork, boiled
-Salt, MSG, dried chili powder
-Green onion and cilantro, sliced finely
-Sides: fresh mint, watercress, leafy pak boong , long beans, chilies and small purple eggplants. Slicing pork liver for saem

1. Simmer fish sauce with some of the broth left over from boiling the pork liver and belly until reduced and fragrant. Strain and reserve.
2. Pound rice cakes in mortar and pestle until very fine. Remove.
3. Pound eggplant and ground pork in mortar and pestle until well blended.
4. Season to taste with Lao fish sauce, salt, MSG and chili.
5. Add pounded rice cake powder, liver and belly. Blend well.
6. Garnish with green onion and cilantro.
7. Serve with sides and sticky rice.

It&apos;s particularly nice when consumed at Pasaneyom, a tiny family-run coffee shop in Luang Prabang: Before the town&apos;s morning market was moved a few blocks away, the place was very popular among tourists, and they often outnumbered locals. Today it&apos;s a bit quieter and the locals have come back. The original owner died a few years back, but his son and daughter-in-law (pictured above) carry on the tradition of a caffeine-fueled breakfast next to the Mekong.

click on the image One thing I particularly love about eating out in Bangkok is the informality. I&apos;ve witnessed firsthand the hoops that people have to go through simply to eat out (not to mention the prices associated with this) in most other big cities around the world, and love the fact that I can virtually waltz into just about any place in town on a whim. Come to think of it, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever even had to make a reservation for a restaurant in Bangkok. Until now, that is.

That reservations are necessary at Jok, a tiny restaurant in a tiny alley in Chinatown, is not surprising, given that the restaurant only has four tables. This is actually a significant increase from the time when Jok was famous for having a single table. But despite the 400% increase in seating, a three-month wait is still the norm here, and according to Mr Jok himself, no amount of money or rank will influence this. Luckily I have friends with more connections than myself who were able to take advantage of a last-minute cancellation. So on a recent Saturday the five of us headed over to Chinatown for a particularly decadent lunch.

There&apos;s no menu at Jok, and arriving at the restaurant, we were simply seated and told of what was available. We were begun with wontons: which were generously stuffed with shrimp and topped with a delicious blanket of crispy deep-fried garlic. Almost dumpling-like, they appeared to have been steamed rather than boiled.

Possibly my favourite dish was a platter of smoked meats, including fatty pork, pork tongue and duck: The meats had the slightest whiff of alcohol (Chinese cooking wine, we theorised), coupled with a favourable fattiness and a rich smokiness. The dish wasn&apos;t necessarily indicative of the chef&apos;s skills, but did show his talent for choosing high quality ingredients.

There were deep-fried snowfish steaks served on a bed of iceberg lettuce: This was probably my least favourite dish of the meal. I&apos;ve always found snowfish ( plaa hima ) impressive looking, but underwhelming in the flavour department. And if you ask me, iceberg lettuce belongs on Big Macs and not much else.

This was followed by steamed crab (pictured at the top of this post). In talking to chef Jok after dinner, we learned that his family had been in the crab business for 70 years. Indeed, it was while delivering seafood to Chinatown&apos;s various restaurants, he explained, that he &apos;learned&apos; many of the recipes that later became the basis of his restaurant. It goes without saying that Jok knows his crab, and this was by far the meatiest I&apos;ve ever come across, although unfortunately it appeared to have been steamed long before reaching our table.

We loved the abalone stir-fried with dried musrhooms and Chinese kale: Until, that is, Mr Jok matter-of-factly informed us that it was mock abalone (apparently made from squid). Regardless, for me at least, this took nothing away from the peppery spiciness of the sauce and the delicious mushrooms and kale--my favourite parts of the dish.

Next was a dish of prawns deep-fried with ginkgo nuts: This also turned out to be slightly disappointing, as the prawns were overcooked. I did like the texture of the ginkgo nuts though, which were pleasantly rubbery, not floury as I expected.

I really enjoyed Jok&apos;s &apos;Old-fashioned fried rice&apos;: which contained more of that deliciously smokey pork (one of our group bought half a kilo to take home). According to one of the cooks, making the dish involved steaming rice, cooling it under a fan, refrigerating it overnight, separating the grains, and then slowly frying it, to allow the flavours of the various ingredients to penetrate the rice. It works, and the grains of rice were both rich, as well as separate and not overcooked.

Fried rice was followed by a delicious soup of grouper and pickled greens, and we assumed our meal was over at this point, but Mr Jok wanted us to try his most recent menu item, shrimp-and-fishcakes: Part of the postprandial ceremony is the obligatory picture with Chef Jok himself: And of course, if you&apos;d like to come back, the reservation: I suspect there&apos;d be a minor catastrophe if this book was lost. Our next visit? Sometime in November.

click on the image K uaytiaw khua kai , wide rice noodles fried with chicken and egg, is a dish found all over Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. I&apos;ve had it a couple times, but have never been blown away, usually finding it often too bland or too oily. However a recent peek into a normally dark alleyway revealed the best take on the dish so far.

The dark alleyway in question, which also doubles as stall&apos;s &apos;dining room&apos;, is Trok Issaranuphap (Charoen Krung Soi 14), the hectic market alleyway generally known as talaat mai : The owner stations himself at the top of the alley near Th Yaowarat and painstakingly fries the dish on a small brass plate over hot coals with no more than a tablespoon. The noodles, fried with garlic-steeped oil, stick to the pan, which coupled with the coals, gives the dish a deliciously smoky flavour and an occasionally crispy texture. In addition to egg and chicken, crunchy pickled squid and chopped green onions are added, and the whole lot is served on a bed of lettuce: With a sprinkle of salty fish sauce, a dash of chili, and accompanied by the stall&apos;s sweet lamyai juice, kuaytiaw khua khai is one of Chinatown&apos;s better noodle dishes.

click on the image Bang Saen, the nearest beach from Bangkok, was the topic of my first blog post . That was way back in 2005, and I think I&apos;ve only been back once since then.  It was high time for a re-run, so with Hock and Maytel and their mad wheelz, A, and all of our empty stomachs, we headed out on a recent Sunday.

Bang Saen is quintessentially Thai in that it&apos;s a beach where people go to eat, not to swim. You&apos;ll see a couple kids splashing around in the water, but the vast majority of people who go there plan to stay dry and eat all manner of seafood. All of Bang Saen&apos;s eats are prepared at dozens of tiny but bulging portable stalls at the edge of the sand: It&apos;s been a mighty long time since I took part in good, old-fashioned yam khai maengdaa thale , horseshoe crab egg salad (shown at the top of this post), and I had plans to order this even before boarding the vehicle. Hock didn&apos;t seem so keen on it, but I really liked the combination of the strips of sour mango and the weird crunchiness of the eggs.

It&apos;s a given that somebody will order grilled prawns: Maytel loved these. I&apos;m not sure if I even got to taste one, but I did quite enjoy the garlicky seafood dipping sauce.

A ordered yam thua phloo , wing bean salad, which was a wise decision indeed: mostly as there was no lack of crispy deep-fried shallots.

Somebody ordered po taek , a delicious variant on the ubiquitous tom yam : which includes a variety of seafood and a generous handful of bai kraphrao , holy basil leaves.

And there was a grilled plaa kraphong : which unusually, was stuffed with herbs, and less unusually, accompanied by more garlic-loaded seafood sauce.

A beautiful sunset was an appropriate end to our meal: After which we left Bang Saen, feeling high from all the garlic.

click on the image Khun Manee is a respected maker of khao taen (pictured above), rice cakes that are deep-fried and drizzled with palm sugar, in Lampang, a city in northern Thailand that is known for the sweet.

To make khao taen, sticky rice (both the white and &apos;black&apos; varieties) is steamed then mixed with watermelon juice. This gives the rice a slightly pink colour and sweet flavour. The still soft rice is then pressed into rings: and the cakes are then left in the sun to dry, which I was told usually takes a couple days, depending on the weather: When sufficiently dry, the cakes are deep-fried. Khun Manee does this herself: The cakes puff up amazingly fast, and a batch is done in less than 15 seconds.

The rice cakes are allowed to cool, then they are drizzled with a mixture of warm palm sugar, sesame seeds and a tiny bit of salt: Khao taen were probably the first Thai sweets I ever tried (I was a student in Chiang Mai where they&apos;re also popular), and are still among my favourite, although I usually prefer the kind topped with sugarcane sugar. Nonetheless, I still downed a (rather large) bag of Khun Manee&apos;s in 1 1/2 sittings.

Several vendors were selling them, and just about everybody was eating them. Initially I was impressed by their size--roughly equivalent to a child&apos;s fist. But I also really loved how they were served. After being grilled: the gigantic meatballs were served with a steak knife, the porcine cutting board shown above, and a sweet bottled-tasting sauce. Unskewer, cut, dip and eat.

They tasted about as good as they look.

The above is a camera obscura image of Wat Phra That Lampang Luang, a 700-year old temple compound outside the northern Thai city of Lampang. On the grounds of this temple is tiny elevated room with a small hole in the door. A white sheet hangs inside, and the light projected through the hole creates the (upside down) image shown at the top. For some reason, women are not allowed in this particular part of the temple.

Here&apos;s what the temple looks like: For larger version of this image, go here . I put my camera on a tripod and used a 15 second exposure (at ISO 400, f/4.5) to get the pic at the top. Would be fun to put a piece of photographic paper in place of the sheet; I&apos;ll bet the colours and textures would result in a fascinating image, perhaps something like this:

click on the image I&apos;ve been in northern Thailand for two weeks now, but Lampang is as far north as I&apos;ve made it. As one goes further south within phaak nuea (northern Thailand), the language, culture and food become more like those of central Thailand, so Lampang was really my only chance to get my hands on good, authentic northern-style Thai food.

Luckily it&apos;s a pretty good place to do this. There aren&apos;t too many restaurant serving local food, but the city&apos;s night market is terrific, although everything is take-away only. Luckily the folks at Riverside Guest House were kind enough to let me use their dishes.

It was very wet when I was in Lampang, and the market had lots of rainy season goodies such as bamboo: and mushrooms: Typical of northern Thai markets are the pre-portioned bundles of veggies and herbs for the various soups and curries. The one below is to make kaeng khae , the famous northern Thai herb-laden soup: This woman made one of the best kaeng hangleh (a Burmese-style pork curry) I&apos;ve had: And the pic at the top of the post?

Lucky because there&apos;s not a whole lot to do in Kamphaeng Phet and also because likay is incredibly photogenic. Likay is, (taking from the upcoming Lonely Planet Bangkok ) &apos;a colourful mixture of folk and classical music, outrageous costumes, melodrama, slapstick comedy, sexual innuendo and sociopolitical commentary&apos;. It&apos;s quite a bit like ngiw , the Chinese drama which I&apos;ve shown here previously .

The light was very irregular and it was at night, so I shot everything at ISO 800, the first time I&apos;ve really shot that high with any of my cameras. The results seem to have come out OK, with less noise than I expected, and I actually kinda like the contrasty, saturated look of the images.

I was surprised to find quite a few different kinds of noodles on my recent trip up north. Of course, there&apos;s the famous khao soi : and khanom jeen : Paa Pong, the restaurant above, is in Lampang and is only open Saturday and Sunday. You can easily identify the shop by the long row of bubbling curries, which are served over the fresh rice noodles.

But there are also some relatively unknown noodle dishes up north. The bowl at the top of this post is from Kamphaeng Phet. They make their own bamee , wheat noodles at this restaurant, which were slightly thinner and firmer than those elsewhere. The dish combines several types of pork and is served with par-boiled sliced green beans and bean sprouts on the side. The &apos;dry&apos; (served without broth) version was excellent, and included just enough oily broth to moisten the noodles.

At the moment there&apos;s a crazy party going on there with heaps of free nosh: It&apos;s been said somewhere that you always end up paying for free things, and I reckon the cost here would be having to eat your free pork and sticky rice while being forced to listen to somebody screaming about the current Prime Minister must &apos;die&apos;. I lost my appetite, which was really too bad, as the selection of food was pretty impressive: curries, stir-fries, an abundance of omelets, candy and buns. If you wait long enough, an expensive German car will inevitably pull up and and unload even more food: And when you&apos;re full, there are lots of pleasant places to relax: It&apos;s the hottest party in town. And it&apos;s all free. Details here .

click on the image I&apos;ve eaten at many, if not most of the upscale Thai restaurants in Bangkok, and have rarely, if ever, had a good meal. Nothing I ate at these restaurants was necessarily bad--no hairs were found, no surly service, nothing rotten--but rather, the food left no impression whatsoever. The general phenomenon seems to be that the more you pay for Thai food, the less flavourful it is, and the more predictable the menu tends to be.

Exploring Banglamphu with friends on a recent Sunday, it didn&apos;t take us very long to realize that on Sunday, in Banglamphu, absolutely nothing is open. Luckily, a few days previously, I was reminded of an upscale Thai restaurant that I&apos;ve always suspected might be different from the rest, so we made it up Th Dinso to Sorndaeng.

A sign out front claims that Sorndaeng has been around since 1957.  A glance into the dining room shows that very little appears to have changed in 51 years: the service staff dress like soldiers, there are doilys and frumpy furniture, live lounge music (appropriately, a mild version of &apos; Sukiyaki &apos; was sung at one point), and of course that most telling sign of old-school Thai elitism, a table dominated by several big-haired, silk-wearing Thai-Chinese women: A had been eating here since she was young, and suggested we order krathong thong : &apos;golden baskets&apos; with a sweet/savoury filling.

I ordered lon kapi , a savoury &apos;dip&apos; served with fresh vegetables and herbs: and yam som oh , pomelo salad: The former was a very good take on a dish that&apos;s somewhat hard to find, and the latter was simple but delicious, incorporating no more than five ingredients including deep-fried cashews, and if I remember correctly, roasted coconut.

A ordered fish maw fried with egg and bean sprouts: a dish I didn&apos;t think I would like, but which was actually very nice, deliciously eggy and smokey, a lot like or suan .

P ordered mee krop , just to see how it would stand up to that of Chote Chitr : It wasn&apos;t bad, but not nearly as rich, citrusy and complex as Chot Chitr&apos;s.

We had a couple other things as well, including a soup with duck and pickled lime, and the yummy crab-filled hor mok shown at the top of the post. Virtually every dish was excellent.

Sorndaeng also proved to be one of the few places I was actuallly inspired to order a dessert: Mango and sticky rice--a Thai cliche, but still very nice, even if it wasn&apos;t peak mango season.

Finally: highly recommendable upscale Thai food.

click on the image Kuay jap , a thick broth with deep-fried crispy pork, pork offal and thick noodles is not a dish I thought I would like. In general, I try to keep my meat consumption to a minium, and I like noodles well enough, but rarely crave them. However with kuay jap it&apos;s the broth that keeps drawing me back... The thick liquid is so laden with pepper that it&apos;s positively spicy.

Uan Phochana (&apos;Fat Nutrition&apos;--don&apos;t ask) is one of a couple very, very popular stalls in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown selling this dish. Naay Uan (&apos;Mr Fat&apos;, you sense a trend here?), just up the road, is probably more popular, but my latest discovery had a couple touches I really liked. There seems to be less emphasis on the offal at Uan Phochana (although it could be they just prepared it that way for the White Guy), the crispy pork could shatter a tooth, and the dish is served with tiny, crispy fingers of deep-fried dough: But best of all, there&apos;s that pepper burn...

click on the image It&apos;s that time of year again: Thailand&apos;s annual Vegetarian Festival is in full swing, and as always, the best place to eat is the Chinatown area. Most people come for the various meat-free noodle and fried dishes, but I personally can&apos;t wait for khanom tup tap . This is an old-school snack made from peanuts, sugar and a bit of salt pounded into a flaky roll--via a pretty amazing process.

It all begins by cooking roasted peanuts in boiling syrup: The resulting mixture, which resembles still-warm peanut brittle, is cooled then thoroughly blended by two men working wooden mallets. During the pounding, the peanut mixture is repeatedly folded onto itself, giving the dish the phyllo-like layers you can see in the first pic. The sound ( tup tap, tup tap ) made by the pounding is the origin of the snack&apos;s name: The paste is then stretched out into a long thin sheet and is filled with even more ground peanuts, with the sheet serving as a wrapper of sorts. The whole lot melts together and the long tubes are cut into bite-sized pieces: The result is simultaneously savoury, sweet and crispy, and is remarkably similar in taste and texture to the the American candy bar, Butterfinger . As Phil Lees can confirm, khanom tup tap are also incredibly addictive. Get your tup tap on from now until October 9th, at the shrine described below.

click on the image Jay is the Chinese/Thai word for vegetarian, and from now until October 9th is the annual Ngaan Jay , Vegetarian Festival. To be honest though, it is quite possibly the most innacurately-named festival around. Although everything for sale in Thailand&apos;s various Chinese districts during this period is entirely meat free, you&apos;ll actually find very few, if any, actual vegetables. Just about everything is either some form of starch (noodles, rice, potatoes) or protein (soy).

In addition to a lack of vegetables, virtually everything is fried: Another odd aspect of the festival is that Bangkok&apos;s entire Chinese community seems to collectively decide that it&apos;s not capable of cooking at home during the 10 days, and instead buys every meal &apos;to go&apos; from a truly remarkable number of street stalls: Nonetheless, if you&apos;re willing to brave the potentially detrimental health risks of the Vegetarian Festival, it&apos;s heaps of fun, and in Chinatown, everybody is involved. In Talat Mai, the main market alley, vendors who normally sell meat instead sell soy-based meat substitutes: If you look closely, you&apos;ll see veggie ground pork, veggie scallops, and even veggie pork stomach and intestines!

Across the way, even Nay Uan , normally one of the meatiest stalls around, goes jay , serving up tofu, soy protein and mushrooms in place of pork offal: Just next door, OK Phat Thai has ditched the epynomous dish and makes a variety of meat-free noodle stir-fries and vegtarian hoy jor : But my favourite Vegetarian Festival dish is fried yellow wheat noodles, phat mee leuang : Fried yes, but also one of the only dishes that actually includes vegetables.

click on the image After many, many visits to Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown in the last year, my seemingly aimless wanderings have culminated in this; beginning on December 6th, 15 of the images I captured there will be exhibited at Kathmandu, the Bangkok photography gallery owned by famed Thai photographer, Manit Sriwanichpoom. The official press release:
 The Last Chinatown 

 A photographic exhibition by 

 Austin Bush 

 6 December 2008 – 25 January 2009 

 [Opening party on Sat 6 Dec at 6.30 - 9 pm] 
 American photographer Austin Bush spent a year exploring the back streets and main drags of Yaowarat, Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. His cinematic images depict the realities and oddities of life in one of Bangkok&apos;s oldest neighbourhoods: the tiny alleyways with creepy old men and smoking teapots; the clacking of Chinese chess pieces and choppy conversations in Tae Chew; tired prostitutes and lotus bud-shaped coffins; bespectacled dogs and beggars. Unlike other Chinatowns around the world, which often seem little more than culturally-themed shopping centers, Bangkok&apos;s clings to its roots and continues to be a living, breathing, albeit gritty community. Austin Bush After graduating from the University of Oregon in 1999, Austin Bush received a scholarship to study Thai at Chiang Mai University, and has remained in Thailand ever since. Austin photographs for various publications and writes guidebooks for Lonely Planet. Samples of his work can be seen at www.austinbushphotography.com . This is his first photographic exhibition. Kathmandu is located on 87 Th Pan, virtually across the street from the Hindu temple on Th Silom (see map below). Additional details can be obtained at the Kathmandu website . I hope those of you in Bangkok who read this blog can all make it to the opening! View Larger Map

click on the image It&apos;s been far too long and I apologize. I&apos;ve been working furiously on the next edition of Lonely Planet&apos;s Thailand , and simply haven&apos;t had the time to blog. I am in Chiang Rai at the moment, doing research for Thailand , and will do my best to share the food discoveries I&apos;ve been making up here.

Guided by an old issue of the Thai-language food magazine Khrua, my first great food find here in Chiang Rai is a local noodle restaurant called Paa Suk. The signature dish here is naam ngiaw , a thin broth (usually pork, but here they also do a beef version) flavoured with a local chili paste and tomatoes, typically served over fresh khanom jeen noodles (&apos;northern spaghetti&apos;, if you will) . The pork version (pictured at the top of this post) was deliciously meaty, although I personally prefer the type served in Mae Hong Son that emphasizes sour tomatoes over meat. The dark cubes you see are coagulated blood, and the dish is served with sides of bean sprouts, pickled mustard cabbage and slices of lime.

They also do a very northern dish called khao kan jin : This is rice that has been mixed with (again) blood, wrapped in a banana leaf, then steamed. The result is drizzled with garlic oil and served with fresh coriander, cucumber and green onion. Very nice, and you wouldn&apos;t know there was blood involved unless I told you.

The restaurant is currently being run by the third generation of the same family, and now they even have a branch on Soi 3, Th Silom, in Bangkok, which I&apos;ll be sure to investigate as soon as I get back.

click on the image To my surprise, it was actually a bit of a struggle to find khao soi in Chiang Rai. This bowl is from Phor Jai, apparently one of the more famous khao soi joints in town, but I found it mediocre; the broth was quite bland and I&apos;m not a big fan of this particular type of deep-fried noodle topping. The pickled veggies were good though, and some might like the fact that user-friendly diced chicken breast was used, rather than the typical chicken leg.

click on the image Mae Salong is a remote hilltop community of Chinese immigrants in Chiang Rai province. The majority of people who live here are the descendants of KMT fighters who, after the communist victory in 1949, fled to Burma and then Thailand. Despite having been away from China for so long, their culture is still very strong, and you&apos;ll hear the Yunanese dialect of Chinese spoken much more than Thai (those who can speak Thai tend to do it with a funny Chinese accent). It goes without saying then that Chinese food, in particular dishes from Yunnan province, are also big here.

One of the best places to sample local food is at the morning market. It&apos;s a tiny affair and starts early; it&apos;s best to get there before 7am. Beakfast at Mae Salong&apos;s morning market means two things: soy milk and deep-fried fingers of dough (pictured at the top of this post). Unlike virtually every Thai person, I&apos;m usually not a fan of this combo, but they were done so well here I had the same breakfast two days in a row. The paa thong kho (the Thai name for the deep-fried dough) were crispy without being oily, and the soy milk was thick and rich.

Other than shoppers, you&apos;ll find the daily parade of monks at the market: and members of the various local hill tribes: Another breakfast option, if you&apos;re a late riser, is a bowl of the town&apos;s excellent egg and wheat noodles: They&apos;re topped with a mixture of thin slices of boiled pork, a homemade chili paste and deep-fried garlic. The dish is very popular and is available at several shops around town. This bowl was taken at a shop on the main stip called &apos;Yunanist Noodle Shop&apos;.

click on the image Despite the amazing diversity of food in this country, much of the street food in Thailand is actually quite homogeneous; the same brand of bamee (wheat and egg noodles), Chai Sii, can be found in just about any town or city; central Thai dishes such as phat thai or phat sii iw are prepared at the farthest extremities of the country; and it&apos;s become the exception rather than the norm to find regional dishes at night markets. Luckily, when I was recently in Mae Sai, Thailand&apos;s northernmost town, I encountered the exception in khao soi noi , a Shan dish that, according to the incredibly detailed information on the cart (I didn&apos;t manage to read all of it), has its origins in neighbouring Chiang Saen district. Although the name might suggest the famous northern curry noodle dish, it&apos;s entirely different, and is probably more similar to bánh cuốn , the Vietnamese freshly-steamed noodle.

The first step involves spreading a dab of rice flour batter on a small tin, which is then steamed so it solidifies in a thin layer. When this was done, the vendor then handed me the warm tin and asked me to add whatever seasonings I liked. With her help, I think I managed to add just about her entire arsenal: ground sesame, ground peanuts, lime juice, garlic oil, soy sauce, MSG, three kinds of chili paste and dried chili powder. She took my custom mixture, added a bit more rice flour batter, mixed the entire mess once more and topped it with an egg: A pinch of vegetables (thinly-sliced cabbage and fresh chilies) was sprinkled on top before putting the tray back in the steam. It&apos;s worth pointing out that rather than somehow elevating it over steam as one would normally do, she simply let the dish float on rapidly boiling water: It took about four minutes to steam each dish, and as seen above, her &apos;steamer&apos; can only hold one dish at a time. This meant some very slow going, which I mentioned to her. &apos;Yes,&apos; she said, &apos;you have to be patient to eat this dish!&apos;

Eventually my khao soi noi was deemed ready and was served by folding it over on itself and topping it with a bit more of the cabbage mixture: The result was something like a spicy Burmese pancake--eaten with chopsticks. I quite enjoyed it, particularly because I was aware that it was only in this particular town that I could eat this dish.

click on the image While in Mae Sai I decided to sneak over the border for breakfast in Burma. Specifically, I was looking forward to eating a bowl of mohinga , the thick fish broth and rice noodle dish that&apos;s often considered the unofficial national dish of that country. After a morning of wandering, I eventually found my mohinga, but not before running into several other interesting things.

My search began in the town&apos;s hectic morning market: I love fresh markets in Burma because they typically take place directly on the streets. The market just across the border in Mae Sai was in a dark, smelly building; better for protection from the rain, but far less photogenic and user friendly. Here virtually everything was stacked in neat piles on banana leaves out in the open.

After some wandering, I eventually found my mohinga, prepared at the stall shown at the top of this post. Although it may not look that attractive, it was good: as it always is; Mohinga, like a hamburger (in my opinion, at least), is almost always good--never amazing and rarely bad.

It was getting later at this point, perfect time for a visit to another Burmese food fave of mine: a teashop. My first stop was at a Muslim teashop where I downed a glass of chai and two delicious slices of semolina cake: My next tea stop was the popular, slightly more cosmopolitan Valentine: where I had two more glasses and some greasy samosas: Samosas, on the other hand, can often be pretty bad.

At this point I was feeling no little pride in the fact that I had successfully ordered the mohinga and all my teas in Burmese (essentially reaching the extent of my Burmese language skills). I was also reminded of the way the Burmese call the wait staff in restaurants: by making an annoying kissing sound.

On my way back to Thailand I came across yet another group of monks: proving that, issues of food aside, things are pretty much the same on either side of the border.

click on the image This may look like just another bowl of beef khao soi , but they do things a bit differently at Khao Soi Islam, in Mae Sai. Rather than the typical yellow wheat and egg noodles, this version, which they call pa pa soi , employed thick noodles made from brown rice. The noodles were short and coarse, and had the texture and appearance of boiled taro, which is initially what I thought they were. Another interesting thing about this restaurant was that the owners, Thai Muslims of Chinese extraction, and staff communicated in a seemingly flawless mixture of Chinese, central Thai, northern Thai and Burmese.

click on the image I didn&apos;t manage to find a whole lot of regional Thai food in the tiny riverfront town of Chiang Saen. Even the town&apos;s night market had the tired &apos;franchise&apos; vendors selling the same dishes you&apos;ll find just about everywhere in Thailand nowadays. However the fact that cargo boats from Jinghong, in Yunnan province, dock at Chiang Saen meant that there were a couple interesting Chinese options. In particular, I had a great breakfast at Ah Ying, a family-run noodle joint located across the street from the Mekong River. I was pretty sure I was getting authentic Chinese-style noodles here because a) the entire family was speaking Chinese and b) the noodles were hand-pulled.

My order of a bowl of noodles got the two Chinese guys into action, grabbing a ball of dough and pulling, twisting and whacking it into shape: Less than two minutes later the thin strands were dunked into boiling water, and were served with a light broth, a handful of greens, and very un-Thai topping of minced pork and pickled mustard cabbage that was equal parts spicy and sour. It alone was reason enough to go dine in Chiang Saen.

click on the image If you&apos;ll allow me to backtrack a bit, I forgot to mention that I did eventually find a decent version of khao soi in Chiang Rai. Sold at the side of the street under two gigantic trees, Somkhuan Khao Soi does a pretty good bowl, his broth having the smokey flavour of chako , a dried spice that some vendors use in their curry paste mixture. Khanom jeen nam ngiaw is also available.

click on the image If you can read Thai, and spend enough time in northern Thailand, eventually you&apos;ll start to see the word luu on restaurant signs just about everywhere. I had a vague notion of this northern dish, knew it was something blood-related, and noticed that it always seemed to be found to be at restaurants that serve the famous northern-style laap. But other than this, I had never seen or sampled it. Recently in Phrae, I was able to get a crash course in luu.

It is indeed a blood dish, raw blood being the primary ingredient. The owner of the shop that was recommended to me explained that the blood must be purchased very fresh. It tends to coagulate somewhat nonetheless, he told me, so he still has to run it through a blender when he gets back home. He then adds eggs (raw) and lemongrass leaves (not the stalks, just the leaves; he made this very clear). He then kneads this mixture together by hand for about 20 minutes, before pouring it through a cloth strainer and storing the strained blood on ice. I forgot to ask why eggs were added, but I suspect the lemongrass leaves play some role in preventing the blood from coagulating.

To prepare the dish, a ladleful of the blood is poured into a bowl and mixed with a chili paste (that contains, among other things, makhwaen , the dried spice that&apos;s ubiquitous in northern Thailand), some chopped cilantro, and a pinch of salt and MSG: As shown at the top of this post, the blood mixture is served with a mixture of crispy fried noodles, deep-fried kaffir lime leaves, deep-fried sections of large intestine (&apos;Very difficult to prepare,&apos; explained the owner. &apos;They have to be washed very well, then boiled, then deep-fried. It takes a long time.&apos;), deep-fried pork rinds and a bit of the liquid from a jar of pickled garlic. To eat it, the blood is poured over the noodle mixture (he said that some people prefer bits of boiled or raw pork fat in place of the noodles), and mixed thoroughly: I sampled a bit of it, and honestly, it was quite tasty. This guy has created an amazing homemade chili paste, and it was this flavour that came through most clearly. The texture was crunchy, mostly due to the deep-fried intestines and pork rinds. The colour, a brilliant, deep red, was for me the most disturbing part. I was alone in my tasting though; &apos;I&apos;ve been making this dish for 22 years,&apos; the owner told me, &apos;and I&apos;ve never eaten it. I don&apos;t like to eat raw things.&apos; I asked how he could make it without tasting. &apos;Experience,&apos; he replied.

Other dishes served at his restaurant included, and I&apos;m not making this up, grilled cow teats (&apos;Very good, better than other kinds of beef&apos;) and aep orn muu , banana leaf packets of grilled pork brains.

click on the image Located almost exactly halfway between Chiang Saen and Sop Ruak (&apos;The Golden Triangle&apos;), Jinda&apos;s Kitchen claims to have been making northern-style dishes for 50 years. They have a small menu of only about six or eight items, one of which was, of course, khao soi . Her version was decent, a little on the bland side, I must admit, but her khanom jeen nam ngiaw (unfortunately I ate it before I remember to take a pic) was fantastic, probably among the best I&apos;ve consumed. Either way, it&apos;s worth a stop, as there&apos;s little in the way of good food, particularly that of the local variety, in this corner of Chiang Rai.

click on the image Nan, a little-visited city in northern Thailand, has a great atmosphere, an attractive setting, friendly people and some of the most beautiful temples in the country. Unfortunately, it also has one of the worst eating scenes of any city in Thailand.

Actually, that&apos;s not entirely accurate. I&apos;m sure there are some great home cooks in Nan, and the prepared food and ingredients at the markets looked pretty tasty. And eventually I did find one interesting local restaurant. But for a visitor without access to a kitchen or even dishes, the Nan&apos;s food choices were pretty uninspiring, and sometimes just plain bad; I left one meal (a simple vegetable stir-fry, I&apos;m not entirely sure how they managed to mess it up) half-eaten on the table, something I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever done before in Thailand.

So on my last day in the city, rather than eat yet another mediocre restaurant meal, I decided to buy lunch to go at the morning market. Everything was wrapped in banana leaf, so I didn&apos;t need any plates, and the the various dishes are meant eaten by hand with sticky rice in the northern style, so silverware wasn&apos;t even necessary. And my hotel had some tables on a balcony overlooking the street, so I didn&apos;t have to eat on my hotel bed or directly in front of a dressing table mirror.

The meal included, clockwise from 12 o&apos;clock, sticky rice; par-boiled veggies, including some nice local beans; deep-fried pork rinds; sai ua , a type of herb-filled local sausage; nam phrik taa daeng , a chili dip made from dried chilies; and aep paa , a steamed banana leaf packet of fish and chili paste. I think it came to less than 50 baht (about $1.50) for everything, and it was by far the tastiest meal I had in Nan.

click on the image This bowl of chicken khao soi was downed in the lovely city of Nan. The restaurant is located about a two-minute walk from Wat Phumin, my favourite Buddhist temple in Thailand. Wat Phumin&apos;s Buddhist murals, executed by a Thai Lue artist called Thit Buaphan in the late 19th century, are exquisite; this bowl of khao soi was merely acceptable. Sweet was the dominating flavour, if I remember correctly, although the dab of plain coconut cream was a welcome aesthetic flourish.

click on the image S om tam , green papaya salad, is probably the most popular dish in Thailand. The dish likely originates in northeastern Thailand, or perhaps Laos, but can now be found in virtually every corner of the country. It&apos;s equal parts cheap, spicy, quick and satisfying, leaving little wonder why it&apos;s become so popular.

However when a dish reaches this ubiquitous and iconic status, the most natural next step is to change it somehow. This has already begun to happen to Thailand&apos;s beloved som tam. The most recent twist I encountered at a small cafe/resturant in Nan was deep-fried som tam (pictured above).

The papaya actually appeared to be more dried than deep-fried; there was none of the oiliness or sogginess typically associated with deep-fried...papaya. There was some regular shredded green papaya thrown in, as well as some carrot and the usual tomatoes, peanuts, long beans and other seasonings. Like a good som tam should be, the dish was satisfying and refreshing, but had the added benefit of being super crispy. The only real downside I could find would be the addition some overly-sweet dried fish.

click on the image Phayao, a small town that most Thais aren’t even aware exists, turned about to be one of the more pleasant destinations of my trip. The town’s setting at the edge of a vast swamp is a lot more interesting than it sounds, and the city also had some very tasty food

The khao soi at Phayao’s Khao Soi Saeng Phian was both rich in flavour and vast in size. I generally don’t like big bowls of khao soi – it’s so much more fun and satisfying to eat two small bowls (which is generally how the dish is served in Chiang Mai) than one large one – but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The broth was tasty and they employed good quality pickled mustard cabbage. And better yet, for those of us who like northern-style noodles, there were at least four other places within a block radius serving khao soi, khanom jeen nam ngiaw , or both.

click on the image Ban Bo Luang lies in far western Nan province, only a dozen kilometres from the Lao border. The town is nestled in an incredibly picturesque valley with forested mountains on either side and is inhabited by three ethnic groups: Htin, Lua and northern Thai. The town is colloquially known as Ban Bo Klua (Salt Well Village) because the town&apos;s well produces extremely salty water. You&apos;d think this would be horrible luck (in fact there are freshwater wells and a beautiful stream there as well), but from this well the locals have been extracting ‘mountain salt’ for an estimated 300 years.

Salt, as some of you probably know, was previously a seriously valuable commodity, particularly for those with no access to the sea. It’s said that caravans from remote corners of China would stop by Ban Bo Luang to load up on  the ‘white gold’ before returning home. Although just about everybody around the world has access to salt nowadays, little has changed at Ban Bo Luang, and they&apos;re still collecting salt as they&apos;ve done for centuries now.

The salty water originates from a couple deep wells in the centre of the town: The water is pumped from these wells into several rough huts that have rows of large earthen &apos;stoves&apos;: The water is then boiled for about three hours until much of the liquid evaporates and crystals start to form. The salt is then scooped into bamboo baskets to drain: The guy pictured here is a native of Ban Bo Klua and has been doing this job much of his life: When it&apos;s his shift he actually sleeps in the smoky hut, waking every few hours to refuel the fires, scoop salt and refill water. The salt is sold in bags directly from the village, delivered elsewhere around Nan, and is now even being purified at the local hospital and used in different dermatological treatments. I reckon they should package it and slap on a label that says &apos;Artisan Hand-Collected Htin Mountain Salt&apos; and sell it to people New York City for $8 a bag.

click on the image The bowl above is, for now at least, the final entry in my gratuitous khao soi series. I had  eaten at this same khao soi shop nearly a decade ago when a friend and I were doing some exploring in Doi Phu Kha National Park in Nan. After a few days in the jungle, we eventually emerged at Ban Bo Klua, and at what appeared to be the town’s only restaurant found both food and accommodation. I don’t recall what we thought of the khao soi then, but I was sure I wanted to eat it again this time, the opportunity being a perfect nostalgic bookend to my seven-part epic khao soi feature.

Richard and I arrived at the shop at an early hour and I asked the vendor (the same woman from 10 years ago) if it was open. ‘Of course, open, yes, yes, we’re open. Sit down,’ she replied in an exceedingly enthusiastic, confident manner. Her attitude immediately made me suspicious; in Thailand if someone zealously confirms something, it most likely means it’s untrue.
After a minute or two she brought out our bowls, and Richard and I dug into what would be the worst bowls of khao soi either of us have ever encountered. For starters, the broth was just a step above lukewarm, and appeared to be little more than coconut milk with a pinch of curry powder. The chicken, which along with the broth appeared to be left over from the previous day, was nonetheless severely undercooked and alarmingly pink in parts. But the worst thing about the khao soi confirmed my initial suspicion; as I stirred the contents, I discovered that this bowl of noodles had no noodles.
‘There are no noodles in this khao soi,’ I told the woman.

‘Oh yes,’ she replied without hesitating, ‘the water hasn’t boiled yet so I can’t cook the noodles. I just used the deep-fried crispy noodles instead.’

As anybody who’s eaten khao soi knows, this is not an acceptable substitute.

‘When I asked you if you were open, you said that you were ready to go,’ I argued.

‘I am ready. Do you like the khao soi?’
I was not getting through. Clearly this woman just wanted to sell at any cost. When we told her, quite frankly, that the chicken was undercooked and that we did not like the khao soi, she asked, without a hint of irony, if we wanted to buy another two bowls.

Don&apos;t eat here. I&apos;m providing the map below more as a warning than a recommendation.

click on the image When I was up in Chiang Rai I had excellent northern-style noodles at a place called Paa Suk . It wasn&apos;t until I needed to come up with an interesting eating destination here in Bangkok that I recalled that they also have a branch here in Bangkok.

The occasion? Friend and Thai Food author David Thompson was in town: David, being a Michelin-starred chef, demands only the finest cuisine and wine, and noodles at a greasy table while seated at tiny wooden stools seemed to fit this category. The restaurant is called Kuaytiaw 12 Panna, and serves the same repertoire of northern noodles as the Chiang Rai branch, with the addition of khao soi . The signature dish is khanom jeen nam ngiaw : which I thought was pretty much identical to the version in Chiang Rai: rich and meaty. Unfortunately we were all disappointed by the restaurant&apos;s khao soi, which not only was rather bland, but seemingly also prepared incorrectly.  Hock and I liked the khao kan jin (rice and blood wrapped in banana leaves and steamed), pictured here .

While eating, I asked David about the book he&apos;s been working on. It is as of yet unnamed, but will focus on Thai street food, and should be in the shops in about a year from now. It will be considerably thinner than Thai Food , spanning 100 recipes that took, in his words, &apos;a f**** lot of testing.&apos;

His next book, which he has yet to begin, will focus on the historical and cultural origins of Thai food.

click on the image well, I&apos;m not exactly sure what, but it certainly is in the press lately. First of all, Saveur #115 has a feature piece on Lao food. I didn&apos;t think the dishes profiled seemed particularly &apos;Lao&apos;, but I liked much of the photography.  And secondly, there&apos;s a piece on the food of Luang Prabang in the December issue of Food and Travel , written and photographed by, uh, me.

click on the image I don&apos;t think Phil was too keen on the idea , giving prions as a lame excuse. But they were out of brains that day anyway, so he got off easily. However on a recent visit to Banglamphu I wasn&apos;t so lucky; they hadn&apos;t yet run out of brains, and I finally got a try. What I&apos;m referring to is tom yam samong muu , pig brain tom yam.

This unusual -- even for Bangkok -- dish is served in an ancient townhouse in Bangkok&apos;s Banglamphu neighbourhood owned an extremely friendly 80-year old man: His father, an immigrant from China (and who eventually lived to be 94 -- the result of a diet of pig brains?), was the original owner. He reckons his father started the restaurant up during the early years of WWII, and little, including the positively medieval kitchen, appears to have changed since then. He now runs the place with his daughter.

Undoubtedly due to his father&apos;s influence, the man told us that the style of pig brain tom yam he makes is the Chinese style (Thai-style pig brain tom yam is available just across the street, he explained). In fact his signature dish doesn&apos;t only contain pig brains; there are bits of liver, tubular lengths of intestine and pork balls (no, not pork testicles, meatballs), among other meaty bits I wasn&apos;t able to identify. The dark brown bits you see are, if I remember correctly, battered deep-fried chunks of taro, which were particularly tasty.

He told us that most people eat the soup with a bowl of rice, dipping the meats in a tiny side dish of spicy dipping sauce first, then eating it with the rice. His dipping sauce was in fact delicious, and was made from tiny pickled chilies ground up with salt.

The verdict? Not bad, but not amazing. As pictured above, the broth appears thick and cloudy, but wasn&apos;t as rich as it looks. And I&apos;m more put off by intestines than brain, which to be honest was actually very similar in flavour and texture to soft tofu. I&apos;m thinking of using it as a tofu substitute for vegan recipes.

click on the image Poj Spa Kar (pronounced phot saphaa khaan ) is Bangkok&apos;s oldest restaurant. The current chef, Nathamon Jaidet, married into the family of the owner, whose relatives were former cooks in the Thai royal palace. She continues to use some of these royal recipes, my favourite of which is this simple, but delicious Thai-style lemongrass omelet. Unlike a French-style omelet, which is cooked on one side in a small amount of butter, Thai-style omelets ( khai jiaw ) are essentially deep-fried on both sides. Minced pork is a common addition, but this unusual version uses finely sliced lemongrass, which provides the dish with a slight citrus flavour. The ideal Thai omelet is &apos;fluffy&apos;,  which Nathamon claims is due to the addition of a squeeze of lime juice. The cooking process is also unique, and Nathamon insists on using very hot oil, which results in an oil-free omelet. She also pours the egg mixture into the oil from about a foot above the wok, producing an omelet that is crispy and layered, not unlike a pastry.

Ingredients:
Lemongrass, 1 stalk
Eggs, 2
Lime
Oil for deep-frying
Chili
Cilantro
Bottled chili sauce

Slice white section of lemongrass as thinly as possible.

Beat Eggs thoroughly. Add a squeeze of lime juice, beat again. Add lemongrass and combine.

Heat at least four cups of oil until just beginning to smoke. Pour eggs into hot oil with a swilrling motion, from about a foot high. When omelet is slightly brown on the bottom, about 20 seconds, flip. Cook until slightly brown and crispy on opposite side, a few more seconds. Drain oil and serve with optional garnishes of sliced chili and cilantro, and a small bowl of bottled chili sauce. Serve with rice.

click on the image As if I haven&apos;t been going on about it enough already, I have more exciting khao soi-related news. I was lucky enough to meet up with Andy Ricker of Pok Pok fame in Chiang Mai, where together we visited six of his favourite khao soi joints. The above pic was somewhere into our third bowl at the famous Samoe Jai Fah Ham. I&apos;d love to reveal more, but the results will run in a magazine article next year. More to follow then. For now I&apos;d just like to say that six bowls may not seem like a lot, but I reckon it will be a good while before I gain back the desire to eat khao soi...

click on the image I&apos;m usually not a huge fan of Thai desserts, but have really been enjoying the sweet stuff up here in Mae Hong Son, northern Thailand. The majority of people in this province are Shan, also known as Thai Yai (or Tai), and have a different set of sweet stuff than the Thais. Essentially, they&apos;ve made due with the limited set of ingredients they have at hand: rice (regular or sticky, or sometimes wheat flour), sesame and sugar, often from sugarcane (rather than from palm sugar, as is typically the case with southern Southeast Asia).

My favourite so far is suay thamin : I can&apos;t remember what suay means, but thamin is Burmese for rice, in this case sticky rice, which has been steamed with raw sugarcane sugar and/or juice and topped with a salty coconut custard. A similar and equally common sweet is alawaa : made from rice flour, coconut milk and sugar. Both of these were bought in the tiny town of Pang Maphaa, also known as Soppong, and were among the only interesting things to eat there.

At the morning market in Mae Hong Son I came across these, which resembled donuts: Apparently they&apos;re made from rice flour, sugarcane sugar and... sesame.

The last, and probably simplest of all, is khao pook : This is purple sticky rice that has been mashed up with a bit of salt, then rolled in ground sesame. It&apos;s then served with sugarcane syrup or simply a block of sugarcane (as shown above) and wrapped in bai tong tueng , a leaf from a teak-like tree that often replaces dishes in this part of the country. Amazing really, what you can do with just a few basic ingredients.

click on the image Sesame is an important item in the traditional diet of the Shan people in Mae Hong Son. In addition to the various sweets that employ the seed, sesame is also used for its oil. Most places in Mae Hong Son use a mechanical press to make sesame oil, but one place in Ban Pang Muu, about 5km north of the provincial capital, still does it the old way: by buffalo.

They begin with dried sesame, shown above. When the pods are fully grown and dried, they open themselves, and getting the seeds out simply involves turning them over and shaking them out. The seeds are washed thoroughly, dried, and are ready to go

A bit of a water is added to the large wooden mortar-like vessel: followed by the seeds themselves: which have been washed thoroughly and dried slightly, but are not roasted beforehand, as in Chinese-style sesame oil: A rather reluctant buffalo is connected to a large wooden &apos;pestle&apos; and proceeds to walk around in circles, driving the pestle and crushing the seeds: It takes about three hours to extract all the oil, and the guy above has to walk with the buffalo the entire time, otherwise it will stop: After an hour or so the oil begins to separate from the seeds and rises to the top. After three hours it&apos;s simply scooped out by hand.  It takes 15kg of seeds to produce 4kg of oil, which is then put old whiskey bottles and sold in the province&apos;s markets: To see this process firsthand, visit:

click on the image Mae Sri Bua is a Shan restaurant in Mae Hong Son. The owner/chef, Mae Sri Bua is a native of the city and has been at this a long time. She has trouble walking nowadays, but still manages to make some pretty good eats. On my first visit to the restaurant I had had jin lung , the meatballs pictured at the top of this post. This a Shan dish you see everywhere in Mae Hong Son and it&apos;s made by pounding meat (the above were made with pork, but beef or fish can also used) with fresh herbs and veggies including lemongrass, garlic, galangal, fresh chilis, shallots, turmeric and tomato. The paste is shaped into meatballs that are then deep-fried. The meatballs are spicy and strong and would put any Swede to shame. Alongside this is some sort of curried vegetable that Mae Sri Bua claims has medicinal properties, and in the small bowl nam phrik khua , another popular Shan side dish that combines dried chili, deep-fried crispy garlic and a grilled soybean paste.

On another visit I had this: kaeng hang ley , a Burmese-style pork curry, and kaeng ho , a northern Thai-style stir-fry. The former was probably the best version of the dish I&apos;ve had in a long time, and was incredibly rich as well as fragrant from the thin slices of ginger. I think it could be even better if the pork belly was slowly braised until fall-apart tender. I&apos;ve already bought the necessary ingredients and am definitely planning to make this one when I get home. If I get a chance, I&apos;ll share the recipe here.

click on the image The name of this dish is, I believe, dialect for, &apos;rice with meat&apos;. It&apos;s a Shan dish that one finds all over northern Thailand, but is best near its traditional homeland.

Ironically there&apos;s little meat involved in the dish; that is unless you consider blood meat. The dish is made from rice that has been mixed with blood (and perhaps a bit of salt) and steamed in a banana leaf. When served, the dish is topped with crispy deep-fried garlic, plenty of garlic oil and deep-fried chilies. Coriander (cilantro) and bean sprouts are served on the side. If you have the dish in Burma&apos;s Shan State it&apos;s served with the pungent root of a type of onion/leek.

One of the best versions of the dish I&apos;ve encountered is at a tiny roadside stall in Mae Hong Son: The stall serves just two things: khao kan jin and the local version of nam ngiaw , a northern-style noodle dish. Not surprisingly, the rice dish is rich and oily, but unless you were already aware, you&apos;d never know it was made with blood (which has little flavour of its own anyway). The nam ngiaw is made in the local style: watery and employing more tomatoes than meat.

click on the image Mae Sot, a bustling city near the Burmese border in Tak province is mostly populated by Burmese refugees. Many of those who live in town are Muslim, and have had a huge influence on the city&apos;s food scene. In particular, along the street that runs south of the city&apos;s main mosque, you&apos;ll find several Burmese/Muslim-owned teashops: They were heaps of fun, and served dishes you&apos;d be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in Thailand.

Although roti , crispy fried pancakes, are available just about everywhere these days, it&apos;s still hard to find a good one. The guy pictured at the top of this post did a good job. His roti began their lives as small balls of greasy dough: Stretched, smacked, pulled, smacked and slapped until the form thin disks, they&apos;re then fried in plenty of oil, shredded, and topped with sweetened condensed milk and sugar: Sweet tea, also shown above, is available at every one of these places, although some customers choose to circumvent the restaurant altogether and order through the window: Another fun dish is the tandoor-baked flatbreads known here as nanbya . Much like the roti, the dough is  portioned ahead of time. The balls of dough are then flattened onto a cloth-covered dome and slapped onto the side of the oven: A couple minutes later they emerge as steaming hot flatbreads. The bread at the shop above was incredibly popular, and there was a line of people both inside and outside: At most places this sort of bread was served with a dhal , a mild, watery lentil curry: I wish we had something like this in Bangkok, although this blog&apos;s occasional investigative reporter Nong A tells me she recently came across something similar to nanbya at a place on Th Ramkhamhaeng. Details to follow soon...

The restaurants are open early, from 6-9am, and are found within about 500m south of the city&apos;s mosque, which I&apos;ve labeled on the map below. View Larger Map

click on the image Lephet thoke is a popular Burmese dish based around pickled tea leaves. The sour, slightly bitter leaves are mixed with shredded cabbage, chopped tomatoes, crunchy deep-fried beans, nuts and peas, a splash of rich garlic oil and pungent slices of chili and garlic. The dish is versatile: it can be a snack, an appetizer or a palate cleanser. Apparently it&apos;s also a stimulant; a Burmese waiter in Mae Sot told me that I&apos;d be up all night if I ate too much lephet thoke.

I&apos;ve had some interesting experiences eating this dish. Once several years ago I ordered the dish at a street stall in downtown Yangon. The woman mixed the dish, in the traditional manner, with her bare hand, squeezing and squelching the mixture thoroughly. After serving me the lephet thoke, she then stared at me while I ate it, licking her fingers the entire time.

I recall that the lephet thoke was tart from the tea leaves and crunchy from the fried peas.

Another time, on a boat on the Irrawaddy River, I was ordering a dish of lephet thoke while a drunk man started screaming at me in Burmese. Another man nearby was kind enough to translate for me. &quot;He says he hates foreigners and wants to kill you,&quot; the man said, without a hint of emotion.

The lephet thoke was rich with garlic oil and had thick slices of raw garlic, which I loved.

Compared to previous dishes, the lephet thoke above, consumed in Mae Sot, was uneventful. Unlike in Burma, the dish was served without garlic oil, and the garlic and chilies were served on the side. The dish seemed to be just about everywhere in Mae Sot, not surprising given how many Burmese now live there. I was able to eat it at four different restaurants and even brought some pickled tea and crunchy nuts back home to Bangkok.

click on the image Lying just steps from the famous backpacker district of Th Khao San, you&apos;d think that there would be much in the way of authentic Thai food on Th Phra Athit. But there are actually some pretty interesting places to eat. My most recent find is a tiny streetside stall that serves only three dishes, the most famous of which is khao khluk kapi , rice cooked with shrimp paste and served with a variety of delicious toppings -- a dish mentioned many times previously on these pages.

Pictured above, the dish incorporates (starting at 12 o&apos;clock and moving clockwise) kun chiang , deep-fried Chinese sausage; deep-fried dried chilies; lime; long beans and cha om , a pungent herb; sliced fresh chilies; sliced shallots; shredded green mango; muu waan , &apos;sweet pork&apos;, pork belly that has been simmered with fish sauce and palm sugar; and in the centre, shredded omelet and dried shrimp deep-fried until crispy. There&apos;s just about every flavour and texture you could ever want, and served with a bowl of hot broth, the dish is a tasty, healthy and balanced one-dish meal.

Another dish made here is khao phat nam phrik long ruea : This is fried rice served with nam phrik long ruea , a pork and chili-based &apos;dip&apos;, par-boiled veggies, fresh herbs and other side dishes. The chili dip is wonderfully tart from the addition of a kind of citrus fruit, and I love the sides of salted egg (11 o&apos;clock) and cha om ,the herb mentioned above, which in this case is served in the form of a dense omelet (12 o&apos;clock).

The third dish they were serving that day was khanom jeen saw naam , fresh rice noodles served with a coconut cream-based dressing. On previous visits I&apos;ve also seen nam phrik kapi , a shrimp paste-based dish served much the same as the dish above.

The stall is open during lunch, dishes will set you back a whopping 30B (less than $1) and there are English-language signs, probably to facilitate the odd backpacker who dares to explore the gastronmic depths that lie beyond Khao San-style &apos;pad thai&apos;.

click on the image The title of this post is a take on the oft-cited 2005 New York Times article by R. W. Apple Jr. about dining in Bangkok. In the article, the late journalist explores the food of the capital with Bob Halliday, a 30-year resident of Bangkok. In my version, I&apos;m accompanied by friend, chef and blogger Hock, and friend, chef and author David Thompson (both of whom, incidentally, work in restaurants mentioned in the Apple article), in our own effort to keep it &apos;real&apos; on the streets of Ayuthaya. To this extent, Hock brought a bottle of prosecco and some prissy French nectar drinques , David took along his wit and historical knowledge, and I brought my camera to document part of the day.

Our first effort in Ayuthaya-style realism was Lung Lek , a &apos;boat noodle&apos; restaurant just across from the ruins. The restaurant was as busy as I&apos;ve ever seen it: which unfortunately had a negative impact on the food. As David illustrates below, the noodles required substantial seasoning, something usually not necessary for the inherently rich dish: The next step in our plan was to go to Pom Phet, a quiet shaded spot overlooking river and ruins, unfold our mats, and indulge in the pleasure of getting drunk somewhere other than Bangkok. Unfortunately there was construction underway at Pom Phet and virtually every other riverside ruin. So we headed directly to a riverside restaurant where we wished Hock had brought more prosecco, and where David and I fought over the fattiest bits of pork.

From there we headed next door to Baan Wacharachai where we spent the next few hours on a moored boat, eating, talking and drinking. The latter caused me to forget to document this part of the day, but the highlights were Baan Wacharachai&apos;s wonderful smoked snakehead fish, watching boats pass by on the river, and teasing Hock.

It was somehow decided that the only appropriate dish to end the day was of roti with condensed milk. This being Thailand, we naturally stopped off to buy another kind of roti on our way to eat the roti: There are several shops selling roti say mai along the strip of road opposite Ayuthaya&apos;s main hospital and David chose the most popular one, at which he had to wait a good 20 minutes: Free samples helped Hock to pass the time: And then it was on to our final destination, Ayuthaya&apos;s night market. Where, as a pre-dessert snack, we ordered beef mataba : Undeniably real and uncomfortably full, we headed back to Bangkok.

click on the image The tongue-twistingly difficult name of this street stall is Chinese in origin, appropriate for a stall on the outer edges of Bangkok’s Chinatown. I was escorted there by David Thompson, who knows the neighbourhood a lot better than I’d expected. According to David, the highlight here is not the the fish dumplings nor the charming atmosphere (we sat on plastic stools near a drain) but rather the noodles: And I’d have to agree. Despite the stall’s claims regarding their fishballs (&apos;The fishballs that jump&apos;, whatever that means), they tasted stale and manufactured. The noodles on the other hand were flat, firm and flavourful. We both found that they had a lot in common with the noodles at Mangkorn Khao , where we had eaten previously that evening.

click on the image Particularly among middle-aged people from the English-speaking world, there seems to be a longstanding fascination with Provence, the southern French région . I’m sure Provence is very lovely, and fits many folks&apos; preconceived notion of a beautiful, rural paradise (although I think eventually I would grow weary of the scent of lavender), but when I recently found myself with a great deal of writing work and a desire to complete it in an idyllic setting, southern France didn&apos;t even come to mind. Naturally, I chose Mae Hong Son.

It was an easy choice, really. Mae Hong Son is beautiful: The hills surrounding Mae Hong Son -- a three-minute bike ride from my house has its own interesting cuisine : At Mae Hong Son&apos;s evening market and brilliant weather: A typical misty Mae Hong Son Morning -- the view over my backyard And so far it’s actually lived up to its status as my own personal Provence. I start each day with a chilly early-morning drive through a mountain valley to the morning market where I down a bowl of thua oon or khanom jeen nam ngiaw . If I’m thinking of cooking later that day, I may do a bit of shopping at the market (the only &apos;supermarkets&apos; in Mae Hong Son sell dry goods), but regardless will almost always buy several banana-leaf packets of Thai Yai sweets from my favourite vendor. I don’t have Internet at the house I’m renting, so I’ll spend some mornings online at Coffee Morning, followed by lunch at Mae Sri Bua or Baan Phleng . By the time I drive back home, the heat of the sun has cleared the mist and I can see the blue sky and mountains that surround the town. The rest of my days are spent working in a covered patio adjacent to the rice fields shown above.

Honestly, I can’t imagine anywhere else in the world I’d rather be right now. I’ll be here until the end of February (maybe longer?), and will be blogging about all of the above, and more. So bear with me if I tend to gush about Mae Hong Son, but I’m really loving it and feel that there’s some interesting stuff here worth sharing.

click on the image This is a Thai Yai/Shan dish that one sees for sale all over Mae Hong Son, and it combines ingredients essential to virtually every local dish: soybeans (both in the form of tofu and thua nao , disks of dried soybeans), garlic, tomatoes and turmeric. However, just like any other dish, there appears to be several different ways to make thua phoo khua . My neighbour claims that thua nao has no place in the chili paste of this dish, and that she normally uses fresh chilies. The ladies selling meat in the morning market told me that I have to use thua nao and dried chilies... I&apos;ve followed the latter method, combined with a recipe from a Thai-language cookbook printed in Mae Hong Son.

Regarding the other ingredients, the people here prefer the small, slightly sour tomatoes – use these if you can get them. Also, try to get the firmest tofu you can get. And in place of thua nao you could use a tablespoon of tao jiaw , the salted soybean condiment popular all over Southeast Asia and China.

Thua Phoo Khua

Chili paste ingredients: Garlic, 2 Tbsp
Shallots, 4 Tbsp
Dried chili, 25 small chilies
Thua nao, ½ disk

Other ingredients: Quartered cherry tomatoes, 2 cups
Oil, 2 Tbsp
Turmeric, 1 tsp
Ground pork, ½ cup
Firm tofu, squared, 2 cups
Salt

Combine the chili paste ingredients in a mortar and pestle and grind until you get a fine paste. Add sliced tomatoes to chili paste mixture and blend thoroughly.

Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add turmeric and blend thoroughly with oil. Add curry paste mixture and simmer over medium heat until tomatoes have broken up completely and oil starts to emerge, about five minutes. Add pork and cook, stirring, until no longer raw: Add tofu and blend with curry paste mixture. Don’t be afraid to allow the tofu to crumble, although you don’t want a mush: If the mixture becomes too dry, add water. Continue to cook until tofu is slightly broken up and heated through, about five minutes. Season to taste with salt. People here in Mae Hong Son will also sometimes add a bit of cha om , a pungent leafy vegetable, at the end.

Serve with hot rice.

click on the image Khao ya koo is the Shan/Thai Yai name for a type of sweetened sticky rice. Other than simply being a sweet snack, the dish has strong associations with celebration, as it&apos;s only made on certain holidays. It also has ties with community, and as you&apos;ll see, is one distinctly local method of making merit ( kwaa loo in the local dialect).

The process begins by steaming lots of recently-harvested sticky rice: At the same time, blocks of raw sugarcane sugar are melted with coconut cream: When throughly blended, the sugarcane mixture is added to the still-warm sticky rice: The rice/sugar mixture is then stirred with large wooden paddles (also shown at the top of this post): I only saw men doing this, and the process took as long as a half hour, giving the rice a creamy, almost oily texture. Towards the end of the stirring process (called kuan in Thai) crushed peanuts are added: The rice is then allowed to cool slightly, and is divided into plastic bags or banana leaf packages: And it is at this point that the merit part takes place. The bags of khao ya koo are then loaded onto trucks: and the villagers drive through the various districts of Mae Hong Son, handing packets of the rice out to everybody they see: In recent years this has been accompanied by a parade: But the most important thing is still giving (and getting) that rice:

click on the image I’m in very good culinary company here in Mae Hong Son. As soon the owner of the house I’m renting learned that I have an interest in the local food, she started bringing me local sweets and snacks on a daily basis. This morning she went out of her way to bring me a local dish of sticky rice steamed with coconut milk and turmeric and served with local-style meatballs (more on this later), something that I had mentioned the previous day. My next-door neighbour, Phii Laa, is equally generous, and possibly even more enthusiastic. Once she learned that I was interested in the local eats she’s been in my kitchen every morning since, sharing a new recipe.

The first recipe Phii Laa shared is one I only came across recently. Khao som literally means  ‘sour rice’, and is local a dish of balls of rice made sour by the addition of tomato and tamarind. The dish is traditionally served with yam thua , ‘bean salad’, the recipe for which can also be adapted to make any sort of local salad where the main ingredient, which here can range from tender fern shoots (a popular local ingredient) to sour leaves, is first par-boiled. In my next blog I’ll demonstrate how to make a saa , another type of local salad centred around fresh (as opposed to par-boiled) greens or veggies.

The ingredients required for khao som and yam thua are pretty basic and I imagine all are generally available even in the west, except for nam phrik phong : a mixture of thua nao (disks of dried soybean), dried chili, salt and MSG, all ground to a fine powder. If you’re determined, I’d suggest just substituting a pinch of finely ground dried chili flakes and some salt, although the dish will be missing a truly local flavour in thua nao.

And if you haven’t done it before, making crispy deep-fried garlic and garlic oil is a snap: Simply get your hands the smallest cloves of garlic you can find, chop them up coarsely (skin and all), and simmer in a generous amount of oil over medium heat until the garlic is just beginning to become crispy. When this happens remove mixture to a heatproof container and allow to cool.

And as always, ingredient measurements below are estimated; Phii Laa, like most Thai cooks, doesn’t use measuring utensils, instead cooking by taste and feel.

Khao som&amp;yam thua (Sour Shan-style rice and bean salad)

Uncooked rice, 2 cups
Strained tamarind pulp, 1 cup
Chopped tomatoes, 2 cups
Salt, 1 tsp
Turmeric powder, ½ tsp
Sugar, 1 Tbsp

French beans
Shrimp paste, 1 Tbsp Nam phrik phong , 2 Tbsps
Ground roasted white sesame seeds, 4 Tbsp
Shallots, sliced, 4
Garlic oil&amp;crispy deep-fried garlic
Deep-fried dried chilies

Cook rice with at least three cups of water (the rice is supposed to have a soft consistency). When cooked, allow to cool slightly.

Combine tamarind pulp, tomatoes, salt, turmeric and sugar in a wok over low heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to a thick paste: about 10 minutes. Set aside.

Prepare beans by removing the strings and chopping: Par-boil beans until just cooked, about a minute, and shock in cold water. Set aside.

In a wok over medium heat, dissolve shrimp paste in ¼ cup of water. When shrimp paste is fully incorporated, add nam phrik phong and sesame. Combine thoroughly and turn off heat. Allow to cool slightly, add sliced shallots and beans and mix thoroughly. Remove to a serving dish and top with crispy fried garlic and garlic oil.

When rice is cool enough to handle, combine ¾ of the tamarind mixture with cooked rice. Taste and season with remaining tamarind mixture and/or salt if necessary.

Coating hands in a bit of the garlic oil, shape rice mixture into golf ball-sized balls: Arrange on a plate and drizzle with plenty of crispy garlic, oil and deep-fried chilies. Serve dish, as illustrated at the top of this post, on individual plates with a generous serving of the bean salad.

click on the image Yesterday, Phii Laa, my neighbour, came over with the tray of ingredients pictured above and a desire to share her recipe for saa , a local type of yam or Thai-style ‘salad’. I was excited about this because in Mae Hong Son there are several variations on the standard Thai yam that I&apos;ve yet to get my head around: there’s the type I mentioned in the previous blog , that uses par-boiled veggies; there’s sanaap , which apparently combines par-boiled veggies and a rather different dressing; and finally there’s saa, which appears to revolve around fresh greens.

The most common greens used to make saa range from tender mango or tamarind leaves to shredded lettuce. In this recipe Phii Laa used yot thua lantao , the tender young leaves from a type of pea, which she has growing in front of her house. If you&apos;re making this at home, I reckon you could use just about any salad-type green.

Regarding the other ingredients, keep in mind that the type of sesame oil people in Mae Hong Son use is made from raw, not roasted sesame seeds. The flavour is significantly subtler, and if you can only get the more ubiquitous Chinese-style roasted sesame oil, I’d suggest diluting it with equal parts plain vegetable oil.

And many cooks here protein up their saa with bits of plaa thoo , steamed mackerel, but a few still do it the old-school way: with bits of deep-fried pork rind.

Saa (Shan/Thai Yai-style yam using fresh greens) Fresh greens, sliced thinly, 1 large bunch
Shallots, sliced thinly, 3
Tomatoes, seeded and sliced thinly, 3
Steamed mackerel or pork rinds
Roasted peanuts, ground coarsely, 3 Tbsp
Nam phrik phong, 1 Tbsp (see previous blog for a description of this ingredient)
Sesame oil/garlic oil, 1 Tbsp
Salt, to taste

Combine greens, shallots, tomatoes and fish or pork rinds, in a large bowl.  Top with peanuts, a pinch of salt, oil and nam phrik phong: Mix thoroughly by hand: and season to taste. Serve on its own as a snack or with rice.

click on the image Khun Yay (‘Grandma’), my landlord’s mother, is originally from Ayuthaya, but moved to Mae Hong Son when she was 14 – more than 70 years ago. &apos;It took us three months to walk here from Ayuthaya,&apos; she explained to me, adding that part of the journey was done on elephant back. After seven decades here she’s essentially a native of the city, and even used to earn extra money by selling Thai Yai/Shan sweets. She can also make the local savoury dishes, and everybody in the family agrees that she makes a mean hang lay. Kaeng hang lay is a rich curry based around pork belly (hang lay is a corruption of the Burmese word for pork curry). The dish is found all over northern Thailand, and because it’s easy to make in large volumes, is often associated with communal eating. &apos;If you come during a festival they’ll make the dish using tens of kilos of pork,&apos; explained Khun Yai, while pounding the curry paste in a mortar and pestle. Her version is a variant on the local version of the dish that usually forgoes the chili paste altogether (she decided to include a basic one here), and which also highlights the local obsession with tomatoes (here in the form of ketchup). She explained that if you substitute chicken for pork, and leave out the ginger, tamarind and garlic, you’ll have the recipe for kai oop , another popular local curry.

Kaeng Hang Lay Chili paste
Small chilies, 10
Salt, 1 tsp
Shallots, sliced, 2
Shrimp paste, 1 Tbsp
Garlic, sliced, 1 Tbsp

Bork belly, including fat and skin layer, 1kg
Bottled chili sauce, 1 Tbsp
Ketchup, 2 Tbsp
Sweet soy sauce, 1 Tbsp
Turmeric powder, 1 tsp
‘Marsala’ powder*, 2 Tbsp
Vegetable oil, 2 Tbsp
Shallots, peeled and quartered, 12
Small cloves of garlic, peeled and left whole, 20
Ginger, peeled shredded, ¼ cup
Tamarind pulp, to taste
Sugar, to taste
Salt, to taste

*Known locally as phong maksalaa , this is a spice mixture used in Mae Hong Son.

Combine chili paste ingredients and grind to a paste using a mortar and pestle: Set aside.

Wash pork and cut into chunks about 4cm long. Combine with chili paste, chili sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, turmeric powder and ‘Marsala’ powder: Heat oil over medium heat in a deep saucepan. Add pork mixture and allow to seal, stirring only once or twice, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add enough water to cover the pork: reduce heat and allow to simmer until almost all the water evaporates, the fat rises and pork is tender, up to two hours. If water evaporates too quickly, add more.

Add shallots, garlic and ginger: and allow to simmer until tender, about 10 more minutes. Season to taste with tamarind pulp, sugar and salt, and serve with hot rice and an acidic salad; Khun Yai suggested a local salad of green mango.

click on the image The bloggers at EatingAsia recently pointed out that northern Thais love their meat . This is certainly true, but I&apos;d also add that they love their oil just as much. Deep-frying is something of a cult in northern Thailand, and Mae Hong Son is no exception. I&apos;ve never eaten so many deep-fried foods as I have in the last month, in particular for breakfast, a meal for which I&apos;d almost totally avoided deep-fried foods -- up to this point at least.

But let me start at dessert. The donuts above are called khanom wong (&apos;round sweets&apos;), and are deep-fried rings of sticky rice dough that are dipped in sugarcane syrup, the making of which can also be seen at this EatingAsia post. Unfortunately I&apos;ve yet to find them served hot from the deep-fryer, and haven&apos;t really enjoyed them.

Deep-fried foods can be taken at lunch or dinner too. Sticky rice and nam phrik (chili-based &apos;dips&apos;) are the staple foods of northern Thailand, and are typically eaten with deep-fried meats: These can range from deep-fried chicken heads, salted fish, fermented sausage, or my personal favourite, pork rinds: Not surprisingly, deep-frying is also a popular way to prepare snacks in northern Thailand. Here in Mae Hong Son one of my favourite snacks is khang pong, a local dish of battered and deep-fried strips of green papaya and shallots: The vendor above sells khang pong at Mae Hong Son&apos;s evening market and she seasons them with the perfect balance of salt, turmeric, lemongrass and chili. The result is equal parts spicy, salty, crispy and hot.

Which brings me to breakfast, as khang pong is also a popular way to start the day here: In the mornings it&apos;s served with the local version of khanom jeen naam ngiaw , a pork and tomato-based noodle soup. Many of the vendors who sell this dish also sell thua oon , a type of noodle soup served with a thick gooey gram bean &apos;porridge&apos;. The same gram bean stuff is also steamed into shallow cakes and yes, deep-fried: The bane of my breakfast. They look and taste astonishingly like fast-food French fries and are served with a deliciously sour tamarind-based dipping sauce. The other deep-fried dishes are, at 2 o&apos;clock, deep-fried tofu, and at 5 o&apos;clock, fritters of &apos;black&apos; soybeans. I enjoy all of these very much, and have adapted to eating them for breakfast, but only allow it every other day. Guess I could never be a real northern Thai.

click on the image Jin lung are a local type of meatball, rich in fresh herbs and often yellow in colour from the addition of dried turmeric powder. They&apos;re most commonly made from pork, but beef and fish versions can be found on occasion. In Mae Hong Son&apos;s morning market they&apos;re sold in Indian-style pots in a generous amount of the yellow cooking oil, and when ordered,  two or four (the serving sizes here are really small) are bagged up with a drizzle of the oil and some deep-fried crispy garlic.

The source of today&apos;s recipe, Khun Yai, although a resident of Mae Hong Son for longer than most of us have been alive, is originally from Aythaya, and adds a couple central Thai touches to this dish. &apos;The people here don&apos;t put Kaffir lime leaf in jin lung,&apos; she explained, &apos;but I like it!&apos; She&apos;s also partial to shrimp paste (the locals tend to use dried soybeans), and explained that in the old days the dish was traditionally served with sticky rice boasting a bright yellow hue from the addition of turmeric, and rich and oily from the addition of coconut milk. Unfortunately few people eat it this way any more, and according to my landlord, the remaining person in the town&apos;s morning market to make jin lung and the rice, stopped making both last week.

Jin Lung (Shan-style meatballs)
Chili paste Small dried chilies, 10
Salt, 1 tsp
Shallots, sliced, 6
Lemongrass, white section sliced thinly, 2 stalks
Garlic, peeled, 12 small cloves
Coriander seed, 1 Tbsp
Shrimp paste, 1 Tbsp

Ground pork, 500g
Dried turmeric, 1 Tbsp
Tomato, seeded and sliced thinly, 3
Kaffir lime leaf, sliced thinly, 2
Egg, 2
Oil for deep-frying
Deep-fried crispy garlic

Make chili paste by grinding chilies and salt in a mortar and pestle. Add coriander seed, lemongrass, shallots and garlic. Grind until you have a fine paste: Add pork, turmeric and tomatoes to chili paste mixture. Work finely using mortar and pestle, pounding to blend mixture thoroughly and tenderize pork: The mixture should have fine, silky texture and ingredients should be thoroughly amalgamated. When you have reached this texture, add the eggs, stirring with a spoon to combine thoroughly.

Heat a generous amount of oil in a wok over medium heat. Form one small ball and test: If the oil is too hot the jin lung will cook on the outside but will still be raw inside. Deep-fry at a low heat until jin lung are cooked inside, and golden outside -- this should take a few minutes. Serve drizzled with a bit of the oil and some deep-fried crispy garlic, with hot rice.

click on the image This morning I took a drive along Hwy 1285, an isolated road that twists 15km between mountain valleys to the village of Huay Phueng, not far from the Burmese border. It&apos;s getting warmer in Mae Hong Son, but driving a motorcycle at 7am, in the shadows of the hills, it was so cold I quickly lost the feeling in my hands.

One sign of the approaching hot season, as the image above illustrates, is the changing colours of the leaves. Known locally as bai tong tueng , the huge leaves fall to the side of the road and are gathered and spliced together to be used as roofing. They&apos;re also a serious fire hazard during this time of year, so you&apos;ll also see people sweeping them into large piles to be burnt. Running over them on a motorcycle results in an extremely satisfying crunch.

The most scenic spot along Hwy 1285 is the tiny Shan village of Thung Masaan. The village is located on a slight cliff overlooking a stream and a perfectly flat mountain valley where people grow rice, garlic and soybeans: At the far end of this field is the village temple: and if you ask me, this simple house at the edge of the valley has one of the nicest views in Thailand: View Larger Map

click on the image Paa Add cooks and sells a variety northern Thai and Shan dishes at Kaat Yaaw, Mae Hong Son’s evening market. She can be a bit of a hard sell, but is an extremely talented cook, her dishes both well executed and perfectly seasoned (her local-style fern shoot salad is a culinary masterpiece), even if you’re not familiar with the cuisine. I’d been buying her delicious curries, stir-fries and salads since coming here, when one day I asked her if she’d mind if I stopped by to see how they were made. She immediately dropped what she was doing and stared at me for at least five seconds. ‘Are you going to open a restaurant abroad?’ she asked.

Despite her initial skepticism, and with my promises that I wasn’t going to open a restaurant, she allowed me to come to her house and was a kind host and a patient teacher. She made several things that day, ranging from a delicious soup of grilled pork and phak waan , a local vegetable: to three different types of laap , a northern Thai meat dish, that I plan to detail in a subsequent post. She usually makes a total of seven dishes to sell, including a few she does every day, including laap , moo phalo , and a sublime kaeng hang lay : She prepares all these dishes by 1pm, then loads them on a cart to take to the market: The dish I want to share first is khai oop , a dish emblematic of Mae Hong Son-style cooking, as well as a very simple dish to make, the ingredients for which are obtainable just about anywhere. Although Paa Add made enough to feed a dozen people, I’ve adapted the recipe to make a decent serving for two.

Khai Oop (Shan-Style Egg Curry)

Hard-boiled eggs, peeled 3 or 4
Shallots, sliced, 2
Garlic, small cloves, 20
Tomatoes, seeded and sliced, 2
Oil, 2 Tbsp
Shrimp paste, 1 Tbsp
Turmeric powder, 1 tsp
Dried chili powder, 1 tsp, or to taste
Salt, sugar, MSG, to taste

In a mortar and pestle or food processor, combine shallots, garlic and tomatoes. Blend thoroughly, set aside.

Heat oil in a wok over med-low heat. Add shrimp paste and turmeric, stirring to combine with oil. When fully incorporated and fragrant, add shallot mixture and chili powder (shown at the top of this post). Allow to simmer and reduce, stirring constantly to avoid sticking.  It is at this point where my recipe differs slightly from Paa Add’s. She used enough oil (more than enough, actually) so that the shallot mixture never really dried up or stuck to the wok. When I made the dish it quickly became dry, so I added water, a couple tablespoons at a time. I allowed the water to reduce and added more, repeating this process until the mixture gained a smooth, slightly oily consistency.

Season with salt, sugar and MSG as desired. Add eggs to mixture, and allow to heat up: Serve khai oop with rice.

click on the image Fans of Thai food in the west are likely familiar with laap (or larb or laab), a minced meat ‘salad’ tart with lime juice and fragrant from the addition of khao khua , roasted and ground sticky rice. Fewer are likely familiar with the northern version of the dish of the same name, which contains neither khao khua nor lime juice, and instead gains its unique flavour from a mixture of dried spices specific to northern Thailand.

Laap mueang ( mueang is a word used to describe anything northern) is one of my favourite Thai dishes. I&apos;ve mentioned it a few times previously, but haven&apos;t really blogged about it in a general sense. So in this, the first of three blogs about the northern-style laap, I&apos;m going to share general description of how it&apos;s made and the different varieties of it that exist. Because the spice mixture is such a crucial part of the dish, I&apos;m hoping to follow this with a post about the delicious nam phrik laap (the spice mixture) made by a community group in Pha Bong, about 10km south of Mae Hong Son. And finally I&apos;ll follow that up with a recommendation for a decent laap restaurant here in Mae Hong Son.

If, after all this, you’re tempted to make laap khua , the northern-style ‘fried’ laap, I&apos;d suggest combining the information provided in these blogs with this recipe provided the bloggers at EatingAsia, which appears to be a good approximation of the dish for those outside of northern Thailand without access to the more obscure ingredients.

I was able to watch Paa Add makes three types of laap while she was preparing food for her stall a couple days ago. For all varieties of laap Paa Add begins with a variety of fresh pork and beef offal: liver, heart, tripe, intestine (both large and small), skin, fat and other unidentifiable (at least for me) bits. She boils them until tender and slices them thinly: For the raw pork laap she takes a generous amount of fresh blood and liquefies it in a food processor. The impossibly red liquid is poured into a basin that already has some dried chili powder, salt, MSG, sugar and the laap spice mixture: The ingredients are mixed with a spoon and raw minced pork is added. This is stirred again, checked for seasoning (after tasting the back of the spoon Paa Add added additional MSG, dried chili powder and some water), and the boiled pork offal is added. The laap is done at this point, and only requires a garnish of a mixture of minced coriander, sawtooth coriander ( phak chee farang ), green onions and mint, and of course, a fat basket of sticky rice to accompany it.

The process for making raw beef laap is nearly identical, except the ingredients, from the offal to the blood, are all beef-based, and a slightly bitter bile, known as phia , is added to the mixture: This type of laap is known in northern Thailand as laap khom , &apos;bitter&apos; laap, because of the dominating flavour imparted by this ingredient.

The process to make make the more user-friendly laap khua, ‘fried’ pork laap, is initially at least, quite similar to the above. Paa Add combined some boiled pork offal, raw minced pork and a tiny amount of blood.

Into a large wok over hot coals she poured a very generous amount of cooking oil and added minced garlic, peels and all. She deep-fried the garlic until fragrant and ‘yellow’ in her words, before adding the pork mixture. This was followed by a generous amount of dried chili powder, MSG, salt, and the prepared laap spice mixture: It took a good few minutes of cooking and stirring before the meat was thoroughly cooked and fragrant. She let me taste it at this point and the laap was intensely rich and spicy, and had the oily consistency associated with this version of the dish. Garnished and served with sticky rice and bitter herbs, it&apos;s among the most satisfying dishes in this part of the world.

click on the image I was hoping to blog about a community group in Pha Bong, 10km outside Mae Hong Son, that gets together every weekend to make a spice mixture for laap , but when I drove out there on Saturday they weren&apos;t able to get enough lemongrass (they need a lot of lemongrass) and had rescheduled for the next day. Unfortunately I was leaving Mae Hong Son then and did not get a chance to witness this...

Dejected but hungry, the next best choice was to head to Laap Khom, a restaurant in Mae Hong Son that uses the very spice mixture.

The owner of Laap Khom is the type of older Thai man who screams at you (in a friendly way, of course), then pats you on the back and makes you feel welcome. Despite owning a restaurant specialising in northern Thai dishes, he and his wife are originally from Isaan, and their daughter is the only local.

To make laap khua they simply take an order of raw laap, which apparently has been seasoned ahead of time, and fry it up in a small wok: &apos;Usually my mom does this,&apos; explained the girl apologetically as she cooked. She needn&apos;t apologise as it&apos;s a decent dish -- not the most refined laap khua you&apos;re going to find in the north, but rich and tasty. The dish is served with a variety of fresh herbs, a couple of which are bitter, a slightly bitter dipping sauce made coarse with the addition of roasted rice powder, and of course, sticky rice.

This was done with a great deal of reluctance, but it was beginning to get intolerably hot and smoky, a profound change from the first two weeks of my stay when I had to wear a fleece jumper and thick socks until lunch. One sign of the impending hot season is the floating restaurants that go up on the Mae Nam Pai: And now I&apos;m back home in hot, sweltering Bangkok, although yet again in transition: tomorrow I&apos;m off to Bangladesh (!) for a week and after that, will be in Phuket for a few days. An almost perverse contrast in destinations, for sure. Depending on the Internet situation in Bangladesh, I&apos;ll try to do some blogging, but can&apos;t make any promises.And lastly, I&apos;ve entered a contest/marketing ploy for a prize to embark on my photographic &apos;Dream Assignment&apos;.

But the people here are by leaps and bounds the friendliest, kindest folks I&apos;ve ever come across anywhere, and in a bizarre way, despite the garbage, pollution and poverty, Bangladesh is probably the most photogenic place I&apos;ve ever been.

click on the image In general, food in Bangladesh wasn&apos;t much to write home about. There were a few interesting dishes, some of which I&apos;ll blog about soon, but most of our meals seemed to be endless but eerily similar variations on mutton and rice. The one area we were most impressed with was sweets. These ranged from syrupy-sweet golab jam, below: to milky shondesh (background, image below) and the slightly more savoury mishti (foreground): After a great deal of &apos;research&apos;, I realized that my preferences lie somewhere between the above, and this dish, taken at the sweets shop pictured at the beginning of this post, combined my favourite Bangladeshi sweets: tender (and not overpoweringly sweet) carrot borfi, slightly firm and cardamom-rich laddu, and an unidentified one, which was remarkably similar in taste and texture to what we call &apos;old fashioned&apos; donuts in the US.

There were even some great sweet-ish snacks, including poori (deep-fried bread) and semolina halwa: And although jilapi, strands of dough that are deep-fried before being soaked in syrup, certainly looked interesting: the combination of oily and sweet was just a bit too much for me.

click on the image The first time I was on Ko Yao Noi was in 2007 when I was assisting French photographer Eric Valli for the book project, Thailand: 9 Days in the Kingdom . For his assignment, Eric had chosen to photograph the Muslim islanders who gather swallows&apos; nests (a Chinese delicacy) in local caves, revisiting a topic he had documented in a film, book and National Geographic article in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During the nine days we worked mostly with the new generation of bird nest gatherers, but Eric did make a point of stopping by to say hello to Sahat, a now elderly gatherer who was the superstar of his previous work. Despite his age, Sahat was still as spry as ever, at one point proving to us that he could still climb by quickly scaling a vine hanging over our boat!

Two years later find myself on Ko Yao Noi again and decided to stop by to see how Sahat was doing. I could only vaguely remember the street he lived on, but somehow found him, amazingly wearing the same Thai schoolboy&apos;s shirt as last time! The image above shows him holding a copy of the National Geographic article that features him, an item he keeps along with Eric&apos;s book in a plastic bag. The pages of both are worn and falling out, the victims of many viewings, and he appears exceedingly proud of having been recognized for his amazing work.

As for me, despite being on a tropical island, I am, if you&apos;ll excuse my Swedish, jävligt upptagen at the moment, but will post some pics from Bangladesh when I get some time.

click on the image Undoubtedly my favourite dish I encountered in Bangladesh was phuchka (known elsewhere as panipuri ), tiny crispy poori-like breads filled with a delicious mixture of spiced beans, chunks of potato, diced shallots, chopped fresh chili and cilantro (illustrated above, at the top). The phuchka are spicy, fresh, sour, and are small enough to be consumed in one go. The beans used were most likely a type of chickpea, but actually reminded me of the tender gula ärtor Swedes traditionally eat in their ärtsoppa every Thursday.

A variation on the dish, consumed in Khulna, southern Bangladesh, did away with the act of stuffing altogether and simply served the crumbled bread over the bean mixture, which also had slices of hard-boiled egg: I believe this version is called chatpati , which was also the name of the shop. Regardless, an essential part of this dish appears to be a sour tamarind-based, watery sauce/dip, which was served with both types.

click on the image or met ya ruang , or kayii or kayuu . Or met thai khrok or met hua khrok . Or perhaps even met mamuang himaphaan . These are all the different Thai dialect words for cashew nuts. The English word, cashew, is almost certainly a cognate of the Portuguese cajou, which apparently originates from the Tupi word acajú , and which is most likely also the source of kayuu, the term used on Phuket, the thought being that the Portuguese first introduced the fruit to Asia from its native Brazil.

Met ya hui and met ya ruang, however, are the terms used only on the island of Ko Yao Noi, in the Phang Nga Bay, not far from Phuket. As in much of the south, cashew trees are just about everywhere on this beautiful island, their yellow and red fruit emitting a sweet smell and making colourful stains on the roads: Most of us have only ever eaten cashew nuts plain, but in the south, cashews are used in various local-style curries, and the fruits are sometimes consumed as a sweet snack. I&apos;ve also recently seen a cashew-based bottled drink here in Bangkok.

To prepare cashews for consumption, the nuts are first collected, separated from their fruits and dried, as illustrated at the top of this post. The next step involves roasting the nuts: This is done in large black woks with holes in the bottom to encourage the nuts to catch on fire, causing a toxic substance in the shell to dissipate. When the nuts are flaming, hissing and emitting a shocking amount of black smoke, they&apos;re dumped onto the ground to cool: After being peeled, the nuts can be eaten at this point. But if the cashews are to be packaged and sold, they&apos;re typically roasted in ovens first: They&apos;re then graded for quality (whole nuts without any shells demand higher prices), packaged and sold:

click on the image I love breakfast in southern Thailand. Unlike breakfast in the west (or even elsewhere in Thailand), which is typically as bland as possible, southern Thais fancy a bit of flavour in the morning. Khao yam , the rice &apos;salad&apos; illustrated above, isn&apos;t exactly spicy, but the abundance of thinly-sliced fresh herbs certainly stands in contrast to a bowl of oatmeal or rice porridge. This dish was heavy on the galangal and mackerel, and served slightly warm, was a wonderful breakfast, particularly when coupled with a glass of sweet Muslim-style tea: On Ko Yao Noi many choose to begin the day with khao mok kai , chicken biryani: Fragrant with turmeric and other dried spices, it&apos;s a dish usually regarded as lunch elsewhere in  Thailand.

Another popular breakfast is khanom jeen nam yaa pak tai , fresh rice noodles ladled with an equal parts creamy and spicy curry dressing: You can cut the heat with some of the unusual toppings, which here ranged from slices of watermelon to pickled jackfruit, as well as some interesting local herbs.

And if you find this all a bit too much for breakfast, you can always go for the huge array of sweet-ish snacks on offer at just about any southern-style coffee shop:

click on the image While scooting around Ko Yao Noi I came across the scene above, a local woman stirring a vast wok of fragrant curry. I stopped and asked what was going on and she explained that she doing the Muslim equivalent of making merit by sacrificing an animal (in this case a buffalo) and sharing the meat with friends and family: The woman went on to explain that because I wasn&apos;t a Muslim, I couldn&apos;t eat any of the food -- not even one bite -- as doing so would render the merit invalid. She was very clear about this, and repeated it several times, not to be exclusive, I suspected, but rather because she felt guilty that she couldn&apos;t offer any to me. Ko Yao Noi is a predominately Muslim island, and like other Muslim places I&apos;ve been (Pakistan, Bangladesh and other places in southern Thailand), the hospitality and generosity run thick. I found the residents of Ko Yao Noi in particular to be the friendliest people I&apos;ve met anywhere in Thailand. I ran into characters ranging from a man who uses monkeys to gather coconuts: to a group of Muslim missionaries: and everybody was genuinely friendly, generous and kind. These experiences, not to mention some pretty interesting food, have given me a strong desire to visit more Muslim lands. Later this year I&apos;ll have some free time and a lot of frequent flier miles, and at the moment am considering Syria or Yemen (although food-wise, Lebanon and Turkey look pretty interesting). Any Muslim world hands with any suggestions?

click on the image Perhaps I&apos;ve lived here too long, or maybe I&apos;m just jaded, but lately I&apos;ve become convinced that there&apos;s little good Thai food in Bangkok. My cynicism seemed to be confirmed when a recent dining companion and longtime resident of Bangkok, Ung Ang Talay, expressed similar notions. He then proceeded to prove both of us wrong by taking me and buddy R to Dao Tai, a truly wonderful southern Thai restaurant in Thonburi (well, technically not Bangkok, but close enough).

Dao Tai, like any good southern Thai raan khao kaeng (curry shop) serves a huge array of prepared curries, soups, dips and stir-fries. Simply side up to the glass case and point at whatever looks tasty. We ordered a huge array of dishes, every one of them uniquely delicious and authentically southern: There was, from the bottom and moving upwards, kai tom khamin , a thin but fragrant broth of chicken, lemongrass, shallots and fresh turmeric; kaeng lueang , one of the most famous dishes in southern Thailand, a sour, salty, spicy soup of fish and vegetables (or sometimes shrimp and fruit);  a rich coconut curry combining beef and pea eggplant; an absolutely delicious soup of creamy coconut milk, tender palm shoots, tiny shrimp and a local leaf called bai liang ; and previously unknown but delicious curry of tender palm shoots, grilled fish and sour young tamarind leaves.

Ung Ang Talay ordered nam phrik makhaam on , a tart &apos;dip&apos; of young tamarind: and at some point there was also a bowl of kaeng khii lek , a thick coconut curry of bitter accacia leaves and grilled fish.

It was one of the best Thai meals I&apos;ve had in a long time, and also served to assure me that there is indeed good Thai food in Bangkok; you just need to be pointed in the right direction by somebody equally pessimistic.

A few more images from the meal can be seen here (all images taken with my Nikon D100, my first digital SLR).

click on the image Hua Hin is an old-school seaside resort a couple hours south of Bangkok. It&apos;s still a popular destination today, particularly among middle-class Thais, but beer bars have begun made the centre of town feel more like Pattaya than a quaint fisherman&apos;s village. Nonetheless, if you walk along the beach you&apos;ll see several graceful holiday homes that echo the town&apos;s past, some of which have been refurbished as restaurants. Probably the most popular of these is Baan Itsara: I had eaten here several years ago and recalled that I enjoyed it. Visiting Hua Hin again with buddies N and R, Baan Itsara seemed the perfect setting for a bromantic late lunch.

My favourite dish of the meal was probably ping ngop thale : The dish is made by combining curry paste with hearty chunks of seafood, wrapping it up in basil and banana leaves, then grilling it until it solidifies. The basil leaves provide a slightly spicy, bitter flavour, and the dish also has a subtle smokiness from being grilled.

There was a deliciously sour plaa kao tom buay : grouper soup made tart with the addition of dried plums, and slightly spicy by the addition of holy basil.

There was a unique stir-fried green curry: topped with deep-fried crispy krachai (Chinese key) and rich with fresh seafood, but the curry was a bit too mild and the eggplants undercooked and bitter.

There were slightly flabby raw oysters (pictured at the top of this post), served Thai-style with sides including garlic, seafood dipping sauce, nam phrik phao and crispy fried shallots. And we also ordered a so-so house yam : a Thai-style &apos;salad&apos; featuring generous amounts of even more seafood.

All in all a decent, but not outstanding meal.

click on the image I was taking photos at Nay Lao, a noodle restaurant in Bangkok, when the owner made a serious face and called me the back of the restaurant. I thought he was going to scold me for snapping pics, but instead he asked, &quot;Are you Catholic?&quot; I replied &quot;Sure&quot; and immediately thought back to the photo I had just taken: &quot;There&apos;s a father visiting Bangkok from the Philippines. He&apos;s here to cure people, please come by,&quot; he said, handing me a brochure.

In addition to salvation, Nay Lao also specialises in two tasty dishes: raat naa (shown on the left above), rice noodles served with pork, greens and a thick gelatinous gravy, and phat sii iw , rice noodles fried with pork, greens, egg and soy sauce ( sii iw ). Either dish can be ordered with sen yai , wide flat rice noodles, or sen mii , vermicelli-like strands. The pork has been marinated and is tender, and the vegetables, a type of Chinese kale, are fresh and crispy.

But the best thing about the dishes is how they&apos;re prepared. The men wielding the spatulas at Nay Lao are masters, expertly charring the phat sii iw and providing the dish with a smokey flavour that remains in your mouth a good hour after you&apos;ve eaten. This is done in a single vast wok that really could use a bit of cleaning: but we can only pray for that to happen.

I was able to witness some of the clashes firsthand today from 1-3pm in the area surrounding the Victory Monument.

click on the image Back in 2006 blogger Newley Purnell introduced the world to a French fry-coated hot dog on a stick he had encountered in Korea. Word spread, and other bloggers, including the now Melbourne-based Phil Lees, were posting their own sightings of the dish. Eventually, Lees took the concept a step further and improvised a recipe for the dish (as well as a subsequent bacon version ). Here in Bangkok were so taken by the inherent genius of the dish, not to mention Lees&apos;s breathtaking reverse engineering feat, that we decided to attempt our own &apos;modern&apos; interpretation of the French fry-coated hot dog on a stick.

Our contribution to the genre? The dish pictured above: sous-vide potato confit with panko crust and hot dog foam. Unlike Lees, Hock has a modern kitchen at his disposal, and he took full advantage of this to apply cooking techniques that would best highlight each of the dish&apos;s individual ingredients while not losing sight of the dish&apos;s street origins. I think you&apos;ll agree that we succeeded in this.

The lengthy process began by cooking hot dogs and potatoes sous-vide; the hot dogs at a carefully calculated temperature and time ratio of 53.2ºC for 73 hours and 22 minutes, the potatoes at 84.7C for 2 hours 17 minutes (Starch begins to break down at temperatures of 78C and above. Natural pectins, which are the molecular glue holding all plant cells together, do not begin to break down until 85C ): For that bit of extra luxury, the potatoes were prepared confit with the help of the finest street fat available, Crisco: To prepare the hot dog foam Hock extracted the liquid from the sous-vided CP-brand hot dogs we sourced from our supplier (a nearby branch of 7-Eleven, think local, fools): and combined it with .83% lecithin, using a hand blender to create a rich nitrate-laden foam: The potatoes were prepared in an egg bath and subsequently coated with panko bread crumbs: before being deep-fried: A smear of ketchup* and a dollop of the hot dog foam finish the dish: A few &apos;behind the scenes&apos; pics can be seen here .

*Our original conceptualization of the dish included a ketchup &apos;ribbon&apos;, but Hock&apos;s methylcellulose was no match for Heinz, and after several failed attempts we gave up; plus Hock had a terrible case of Bangkok belly (probably from all the hot dog research) and was growing weaker with every passing hour.

click on the image I recently spent three days in Melbourne, Australia shooting the photos for a magazine article about the city&apos;s alleyways, arcades and lanes (an article on the same topic, written by Phil Lees, can be seen here ). It was a fun assignment, and was also my first real chance to try out my new camera, a Nikon D700, and I have to say that I&apos;m a satisfied customer. I think I rarely shot below ISO400, sometimes even shooting at ISO6400, getting excellent results nearly all the time. I love the feel of the camera, and appreciate the gigantic viewfinder.

click on the image Phil said he wanted to make sai ua , the famous northern Thai sausage. I was skeptical. Phil had previously told me about Melbourne&apos;s Footscray Market and its apparently amazing selection of Asian ingredients, but could we really make anything approaching an authentic northern sausage in Australia? Using Thompson&apos;s Thai Food as a rough guide, we made a list of the ingredients we&apos;d need and set off. Arriving at the market (pictured above), I was almost immediately converted: Footscray Market was every bit as well-stocked and hectic as any in Asia, and we had no problem finding virtually every last ingredient.

Arriving back home, and fueled by a constant stream of Little Creatures Pale Ale , we chopped the fresh herbs roughly: and Phil fed this mixture and some pork through a meat grinder. As a test, we fried a bit of the mixture up: and were pleased to find that it was nearly spot on. After adjusting the seasoning slightly, Phil put the ingredients through a second run, this time filling a sausage casing: While Phil was grilling the sausage, I made two Mae Hong Son dishes: saa , a salad of pea shoots, and kaeng hang lay . I had brought with me a couple of the more obscure ingredients, but again, we were able to find everything we needed, including pork belly, at Footscray market. I marinated the meat a la Khun Yai&apos;s recipe : and let it simmer for about four hours until it was fall-apart tender: The weather was too cold to pretend we were in northern Thailand, but the flavours were pretty damn authentic.

It only took me a couple of meals and a bit of exploring to come to the conclusion that Melbourne must be one of the best food cities, well, anywhere. The diversity of cuisine alone is astounding: authentic Vietnamese, Ethiopian, Lebanese, Chinese, Greek and Italian are all easily available. The city&apos;s markets are fantastically well-stocked and vibrant. The coffee excellent. And there are meat pies. The only downside I can think of is cost, but this is largely based on my parsiminous Bangkok mindset, and reckon you&apos;re more likely to find tastier and more varied budget eats in Melbourne than say, New York City or Paris.

I was fortunate enough to eat at two of the city&apos;s upscale restaurants, Cutler&amp;Co. and MoVida. We had a wonderful meal at the former, which had one of the most interesting dessert menus I&apos;ve ever come across. Now, I&apos;m normally not much of a sweets fan, but with creative and delicious sounding dishes as Ginger granita, coconut sorbet, fresh lychee; Toffee apple, fromage blanc, spiced short bread&amp;cider jelly; Steamed pear&amp;suet pudding, liquorice ice cream, confit lemon; and Chestnut ice cream, burnt butter cake, frozen chocolate crumbs&amp;Cognac, ordering dessert was an imperative, not an option. My Chocolate ice cream sandwich, vanilla parfait&amp;salted caramel was wonderful, but then again, I&apos;d probably be happy with a plate of warm dirt as long as it was topped with salted caramel.

The restaurant, which Phil has previously written about , has a largely predictable northern Chinese menu, but with a few obscure but delicious Uighur/Western Chinese dishes thrown in. These included la mian , the famous Uighur dish of hand-pulled noodles fried with lamb, bell pepper and tomato (shown at the top of this post), spice-dusted lamb skewers, and a deliciously tart and crispy cucumber salad: 1+1 Dumpling Noodles

Slightly more refined pastries were available in the CBD: and Acland Street in St. Kilda had a string of cake shops that looked impressive, but that were mostly hit and miss in terms of flavour: I particularly enjoyed the huge variety of tasty Greek and Turkish pastries: and of course, Aussie pies. The pie below was taken at Dinkum Pies, a rural Victoria bakery in the midst of upscale cafes on Block Place: Dinkum Pies

We spent a morning wandering around the halls of Victoria Market, with me drooling at the Mediterranean-style dishes I could never even dream of getting in Bangkok: But this being Australia, we naturally settled on eating pies: And for some reason I felt compelled to order a comically immense bratwurst: A fittingly greedy end to what was essentially an indulgent but tasty visit.

click on the image Khao San Road is probably the unlikeliest place in Bangkok you&apos;d expect to find an authentic Thai cooking school. But the people behind Khao Cooking School have heaps of experience and have put together an institution that feels both professional and homey, despite the incongrous location.

The school was founded less than a year ago by Kobkaew Najpinit (in the middle in the picture above), author of several cookbooks and a 35-year veteran of teaching Thai cooking. Her daughter Ning (on the left) speaks great English and does much of the teaching to non Thai-speaking students. A typical course at Khao spans three dishes over four hours and costs 1,500B. There are two sessions a day, each offering a different repertoire of dishes, so it&apos;s possible to study a week and not repeat a single dish. Those interested in more obscure recipes can arrange private scholarship.

click on the image Khun Daeng, originally brought to my attention by diligent foodsleuth Nong A, is a tiny restaurant that serves an equally tiny repertoire of dishes. The emphasis is on kuay jap yuan , a noodle soup of partial Vietnamese origin that combines several kinds of pork including ribs, ground pork and muu yo , the smooth, peppery Vietnamese pork sausage. The nooodles used are made from rice flour and dusted with another type of flour, the latter of which provides the broth with a thick, slightly gelatinous texture. It&apos;s the kind of Vietnamese-Thai dish one finds in the towns along the Mekong River such as Mukdahan or Nong Khai . Khun Daeng also does a tasty-looking yam of muu yor.

click on the image I&apos;ve previously blogged about the other location of this restaurant, but the original branch, located near the National Library, is apparently the more famous of the two, and has hosted the likes of the Thai royal family and was previously named as one of the Bangkok Post&apos;s best restaurants in Bangkok a few years back. Because of these accolades, the place has a something of a reputation, and some visiting friends were keen on stopping by.

At my last visit, nobody was interested in ordering the most expensive item on the menu: crab fried in yellow chili oil (pictured above). I finally got my chance and quite enjoyed the dish, particularly its generous chunks of crab and its pleasantly oily texture.

Once again we ordered the house special dork khajorn , a type of domestic flower, flash-fried with minced pork and oyster sauce: Hock ordered miang khanaa , expecting it to be served in the traditional manner with bai miang (sometimes known as wild tea leaf) : but as the name suggests, the dish is served here with the crispy, slightly bitter leaves of khanaa , Chinese kale.

One of the best dishes of the meal was mussels fried (or were they steamed?) with fresh herbs: I think it was the first time either Hock or I had eaten tender, perfectly-cooked mussels in Thailand.

And finally I ordered the house green curry with freshwater fish dumplings: The curry itself was pleasantly bland (as is the intent), but the fish balls were rubbery and flavourless.

I think we all felt it was generally a solid, satisfying meal, as is the case with of much of the Thai food in Bangkok nowadays, but nothing profoundly delicious or revelatory (which is also the case with much of the food in Bangkok).

click on the image It&apos;s the story of my life. Virtually every time I make specific plans to visit a specific restaurant in Bangkok, it&apos;s closed. It&apos;s happened tens of times, and I&apos;m surprised I haven&apos;t mentioned it here before. And yes, it happened again today when I planned to take visiting Thai food fans Nick Malgieri and David Thompson to Dao Tai , a southern Thai restaurant in Thonburi.

Suppressing the urge to throw my camera at the retractable steel wall that separated me from delicious southern Thai food, I remained calm and reminded myself that there are two seemingly identical restaurants across the street: One of which was closed (of course), leaving us with little choice: Ruam Tai. Fortunately the bundle of sator , also known as stink beans, hanging at the display case was an encouraging sign of southern authenticity: The selection was also encouraging, so we ordered a huge spread of dishes: including a spicy boar stir-fry, the famous southern Thai fish kidney curry, kaeng tai plaa , a soup of fresh turmeric and chicken, a very nice yellow curry and a stir-fry of stink beans.

I particularly liked the slightly sweet soup of coconut milk, palm hearts, shrimp, the previously-mentioned stink beans and a southern Thai leaf called liang : David liked the dish in the foreground, a mixture of cockles and bai chaphlu , wild tea or betel leaves in a mild coconut milk curry: And I thought Nick did quite well in general, considering the famous heat of authentic southern Thai food. I thought the dishes weren&apos;t quite as refined and the flavours not as expertly balanced as those of Dao Tai, but everything was still authentic and tasty.

In the end my initial disappointment was almost entirely forgotten when we made our way into the Thai sweets shop directly next door (Phensri, 02 411 0839), where the very kind owner plied us with jasmine-scented Thai sweets, answered our ridiculous questions, and eventually took us into her kitchen where she let us see where she mixed, steamed and smoked her mor kaeng and other desserts.

click on the image I&apos;ve previously blogged about this tiny Muslim restaurant off Thanon Charoen Krung, but having recently been reminded just how good it is, not to mention the fact that it always seems to be empty, felt compelled me to do a re-run.

The dish to order here is khao mok , biryani, in particular, the goat version (pictured above). The rice here is perfectly-cooked, pleasingly oily (with ghee, I suspect) and fragrant, and studded with raisins, cashews and dried spices, while the joint of goat is fall-apart tender and sits beneath the rice in a puddle of rich curry that eventually soaks into the rice, bringing the dish together.  It&apos;s served with slices of cucumber and onion and a slice of lime and a wonderful homemade relish that&apos;s equal parts sweet and sour.

Damn, it&apos;s good.

click on the image I&apos;ve recently moved, and after all these years of living in Bangkok, I&apos;m finally living in Bangkok. I&apos;m now based steps from Thanon Silom, Bangkok&apos;s de facto financial district, basically in the centre of town. Foodwise, there&apos;s an amazing amount of cheap eats around here, strategically positioned and priced to appeal to low- and mid-level office staff. Frankly, much of it doesn&apos;t really look that interesting and is emblematic of the spicy, oily stuff that Bangkokians fancy these days. But amongst the riff raff there are a few &apos;famous&apos; vendors, including a yen ta fo vendor called JC.

Despite being a street stall, and despite the fact that your order is most likely be taken by an overweight shirtless man, there&apos;s no small amount of pretension and protocol associated with eating here. Seating is strictly relegated, and the vast majority of tables are only available for groups of six. If you come with a friend you&apos;re asked to sit on the same side of one of the few tables set aside for individuals. (And don&apos;t even think about sitting where the owner sits.) Because the place is so popular and so much care is put into each bowl, you&apos;re encouraged to order multiple bowls in one go (this is called bun and stems from the Thai shortening and mispronunciation of the English word &apos;double&apos;). And after all this, bowls only leisurely arrive at your your table, just as fast as the older couple can put them together.

But it&apos;s worth the wait.

The yen ta fo here is slightly sweet for my taste, but admittedly, that&apos;s exactly how this dish should be. The broth is balanced out with plenty of deep-fried crispy garlic and slightly salty tao huu yii , a tofu-based condiment that also provides the dish with it&apos;s red colour. A bowl comes with excellent-quality fish dumplings, fish cakes, shrimp balls, deep-fried tofu, par-boiled morning glory and pickled squid. And lastly, an order of sen yai here will not get you the usual wide rice noodle sheets, but rather noodles that take the form of thick, old-skool Adidas shoelace-sized strands.

click on the image Bangkok is a decent place to dip your toe in the ocean of regional Thai food, but as soon you attempt to go any deeper than that it&apos;s nigh impossible to find anything profoundly good (it&apos;s even getting harder to find really good Bangkok food these days, but that&apos;s a whole other blog post...).

Take khao soi , for example. If you&apos;re a regular reader of the blog you&apos;re probably already aware of my love for this northern-style curry noodle dish. I&apos;m constantly seeking the stuff out when up north and am always on the lookout for a decent bowl here in Bangkok, but have mostly come up empty-handed. Other than the excellent khao soi at the Bangkok branch of the famous Chiang Mai institution Lam Duan , which unfortunately is located way outside of town, most khao soi in Bangkok is mediocre, or worse. And disappointingly, such was the case with today&apos;s effort, Kuan Phochana (pictured above). The broth of our khao soi kai , chicken khao soi, looked and tasted like little more than sweet-ish coconut milk combined with stale curry powder. Even the sides of pickled mustard greens and the fried chili topping were unpleasant (admittedly, the noodles were decent and authentic though). And to top it off, at 50B for a phiset or &apos;special&apos; bowl, it was relatively expensive.

Luckily their nam ngiaw : a northern-style noodle dish usually also served at the same places that serve khao soi, was decent: satisfyingly rich, meaty and fragrant.

So if you&apos;re in the neighbourhood, you could do worse than stopping by the for decent nam ngiaw, but I&apos;d recommend saving the khao soi for your next trip up north. (And if you can&apos;t make it up north, other, slightly tastier khao soi joints in Bangkok include Khao Soi Sophaphan , Yuy Lee and Maan Mueng .)

click on the image The name of this stall means &apos;rising flame&apos;, a reference to how the phat thai here is fried a small wok, which allows the flames to char the noodles. This is a substantial difference with the vast majority of phat thai, as the dish is generally made on a wide flat surface with no flames at all.

The vendor sets up at the little alleyway of &apos;famous&apos; stalls at the popular Soi 38 night market, and in addition to flames, there are a few more interesting things about how he rolls. He begins the dish by flash-frying shrimp, dried shrimp and tofu in plenty of oil over a very, very hot flame. Next, the fire is turned down and dry rice noodles are moistened with a few splashes of tinned milk and seasoned with sugar, vinegar, dried chili and fish sauce. The heat is increased again and the noodles and seasonings are mixed thoroughly (shown above). After a few seconds, chopped Chinese chives and bean sprouts are tossed in and the dish is removed. In a new wok, he then scrambles a few eggs over a very high heat and when cooked, adds these to the noodle mixture. And when serving the dish, instead of the usual sliced banana flower, he uses a few sprigs of pennywort.

Unfortunately, despite all these clever variations, the result is a pretty bog standard dish of phat thai: Not bad, but wholly unremarkable, and most sadly, lacking the smokiness that I assume was the intent of making the dish in this manner.

Oh well.

click on the image Vegetarians, cover your eyes: this is a particularly flesh-laden post. But in its defense I&apos;d have to say that Ko Tek Chiang 3 is one of the best uses of meat that I&apos;ve encountered in a long time.

The flesh in question is in the form of toon , a Chinese-style slow braise: It&apos;s a simple dish, consisting of cuts of pork or beef simmered until tender and served with a seasoned broth, a pinch of veggies and, if desired, rice.

We stuck with the nuea toon , beef (shown at the top of this post). The slices you see at the top of the bowl are tongue, which have their own particular meaty flavour and were virtually fall-apart tender. Below that you&apos;ll find bits of beef similar to the Vietnamese-style corned beef one finds in pho, and the Thai favourite, big strips of gelatinous tendon. The broth has a pleasant amber colour and is peppery to the point of being spicy. The dish is truly, meatily wonderful, but, in what must be the proprietor&apos;s bizarre inside joke, is served with some of the worst rice I&apos;ve encountered anywhere in Thailand.

The other downside: Ko Tek Chiang 3 is located way out in Muang Thong Thani. The &quot;3&quot; in the name implies that there are two branches elsewhere, but they have no business card so I wasn&apos;t even able to establish an accurate address for this one. The Google Map location below, pinpointed with the consul of my iPhone, should be accurate though.

But it&apos;s worth the drive for the tongue alone.

click on the image and happen upon a drunk Kiwi chef grilling chicken on the side of the street, don&apos;t be alarmed; foreigners haven&apos;t started taking menial jobs, and food standards haven&apos;t yet dropped that much. Rather, Hock and I simply wanted to make frango no churrasco, Portuguese-style grilled chicken.

You see, my new place doesn&apos;t allow coal-burning stoves, so we asked the streetside Isaan restaurant downstairs if we could use their grill. They were kind enough to oblige, and the next day we brought down two small Thai free-range chickens that I had marinated overnight in my own homemade molho de piri-piri (dried phrik kariang chilies from Mae Hong Son, olive oil, garlic, vinegar, salt): After removing the birds from the marinade, Hock spatchcocked them two different ways: one he cut down the breastbone and the other down the spine: After a few minutes of grilling, it appeared that the latter seemed to work better, as it meant that the thicker breast meat was in the centre of the chicken, directly above the fire. Hock also pointed out that, whereas Americans and Australians happily go about spending hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars on complicated barbecue systems, this guy, like many other Thai street vendors, gets by with an enamel basin and a wire grill. This is really all one needs, since we were grilling, not smoking, and a lid isn&apos;t even necessary.

The coals were hot but not flaming, and it took a good 45 minutes to cook, all the while we drank our beers and received strange looks from passing Thais. Our kind sponsor helped us pass the time with shots of yaa dong , a bright-red, sickly-sweet Thai herbal liquor. In return, we gave him some chicken, our recipe and money for new coals.

The result was so tasty we forgot to take a pic of it.

click on the image I blog about phat Thai on occasion, but mostly for you people. I realize it&apos;s huge abroad, particularly in the US, but to be honest, I&apos;m not such a big fan of the stuff. Generally find it kinda stodgy and greasy, particularly when compared to a lot of Thai food out here.

But occasionally I&apos;ll meet a vendor that changes my perceptions of a dish. This was the case a while back when I went to Chinatown with my friend Be. She was born in the area and wanted to take me to some of the places where she ate when she was a kid. One of these was open-air stall serving tiny dishes of phat Thai on Thanon Ratchawong.

I had walked by this stall heaps of times previously, but had never stopped by or noticed anything in particular about it. It took Be&apos;s help and a closer look to reveal what I had been missing. To begin with, the couple, like many vendors in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, fry the dish over hot coals: which provides the dish with a subtle smokey flavour. The noodles that they use are thinner than regular phat Thai noodles, and are chopped into short lengths. They&apos;ve also been cooked beforehand, having been previously fried with most of requisite ingredients (sliced shallots, dried shrimp, bits of firm tofu, seasoning, egg). To order, they pull out the pre-cooked noodles and then heat them up with bean sprouts, chopped Chinese chives and additional seasoning. To go orders are served in krathong , the tiny banana leaf cups shown at the top of this post.

The couple work pretty slowly, and there are usually lots of to go orders, so this isn&apos;t exactly fast food. But if you&apos;re patient, you&apos;ll be rewarded with a phat Thai that is rich and liberally-seasoned rather than stodgy and bland (Be reckons they use duck eggs, which could contribute to this).  And despite being re-fried, the dish isn&apos;t particularly oily either. Not quite sure how they accomplish that.

click on the image I last blogged about this shophouse restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown back in 2007, but after several recent meals there, feel compelled to do a re-run. Actually, despite my numerous visits, I&apos;m somewhat ashamed to admit that I&apos;ve only ever ordered one dish at Nay Mong: or lua , a crispy oyster and egg omelet (shown here ). It eventually took the help of a couple newbies to get me out of my rut.

Visiting the restaurant on a recent eating tour of Chinatown, Hock&apos;s father in law, P, was clever enough to order or suan , the &apos;soft&apos; version the dish (shown above). I&apos;d had this dish elsewhere, but Nay Mong&apos;s take was simply head and shoulders above anything else. Like or lua, the dish combines just four ingredients: oysters, egg, green onions and a sticky batter (and of course, seasoning). But in this case, the ingredients are deftly fried, resulting in a light creamy texture that seems to emphasize the eggy and salty flavours of the dish; a profound contrast with the starchy, sticky, heavy pancake that one finds at most places.

I still love or lua, but there is definitely going to be some serious indecision on my next visit. And to add to this, I&apos;ve also been told on good authority that Nay Mong does a very good crab fried rice.

Maybe next year.

click on the image After a long hiatus, I find myself yet again spending quite a bit of time in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. This is mostly due to some photo assignments I&apos;m working on, but I&apos;ve also been making some eating trips as I now live only a couple metro stops away. As always, I&apos;ve got my own repertoire of favourite stalls and dishes, but I&apos;m also making an effort to discover some new places.

My most recent discovery is Nay Yong, a streetside curry stall on Thanon Yaowarat, Chinatown&apos;s main drag: It&apos;s very similar to the exceedingly popular Jek Pui , located just around the corner, and likewise is associated with mild Chinese/Thai-style curries such as kaeng karii . I chose green curry served with look chin plaa kray , freshwater fish dumplings, and hearty chunks of white radish (shown at the top of this post). The curry is served over rice or khanom jeen noodles (I chose the former), and I also ordered a side of deep-fried kun chiang , a type of Chinese sausage, a traditional accompaniment to this dish. The curry is tasty but mild, and definitely benefits from the optional condiments of sliced fresh chili and a sweet soy sauce. The kun chiang here is also quite nice, and is not as waxy and bland as elsewhere.

There&apos;s another &quot;branch&quot; of Nay Yong virtually across the street, in the cluster of street stalls near the entrance to Talat Kao.

Motivated by an open schedule and a temporary lack of work, I&apos;ve decided to spend a week in Vietnam. Starting in Ho Chi Minh City, I&apos;ll be taking the Reunification Express north, with a stop in Hoi An (and possibly Hue), before terminating in Hanoi. It&apos;s a bit of a whirlwind trip, and having relatively little time to explore each destination, I&apos;m relying on the generous consul of guidebooks, websites and blogs. Luckily, there&apos;s some great eats advice out there, and I&apos;ll be posting my pics from various meals and markets as often as I can get a decent WiFi connection.

click on the image As mentioned previously, this is a bit of a whirlwind trip, which leaves me relatively little time to explore dining options on my own. Knowing I&apos;d be in Saigon I went directly to EatingAsia&apos;s Vietnam archives and found I wasn&apos;t staying very far from Hồng Hạnh, a restaurant specialising in Hue-style cuisine they appeared to have much praise for . I jotted down a couple dishes that looked interesting and headed over one evening.

Even before your bottom hits the chair at Hồng Hạnh you&apos;re presented with two side dishes: On the left is bản công thành chiến , a deep-fried, meat-filled bun. On the right and wrapped in banana leaves are two different kinds of Vietnamese sausage: giờ, a pepper-studded piece of steamed minced pork, and nem chua, raw fermented pork with plenty of garlic. Both were wonderful, particularly the giờ, and I could have ordered a beer and called it a meal.

But following EatingAsia&apos;s tips I ordered bún thịt nướng (no pic) and the dish pictured at the top of this post, bánh đa , a deep-fried rice cracker served with tiny freshwater snails fried with fresh herbs. The former takes the form of thin rice noodles and shredded herbs topped with thin slices of grilled pork. the dish was sweet from the ubiquitous nước chấm , a syrup and fish sauce condiment, and could have used a few more fresh herbs, but instantly reminded me of the fresh Vietnamese flavours I&apos;d been missing since my last visit to the country. I really enjoyed the latter, which was as simple as it was rich and herbal.

Coming back the next day, I arrived just before lunchtime. Business was slow, and after a couple minutes one of the employees came over and sat with me: She couldn&apos;t speak much English, and compensated by helping me order, and eventually, taking it upon herself to season my dishes with copious chili (luckily I like spicy). With her help, I ordered bánh ít trần: a dish described in the English-language menu as &quot;round patty stuffed with green peas paste and meat taken with taro cake stuffed with meat.&quot; The two patties, one of which was fried and crispy, the other steamed and sticky, were stuck together, were served with shredded daikon and carrots, and two types of Vietnamese sausage. Unusual, but tasty.

We also decided on a bowl of bánh canh cua : a thick crab-based broth with pork and, according to EatingAsia, tapioca starch noodles. The crab wasn&apos;t the pleasantest I&apos;ve ever encountered, but I really enjoyed the fishy heartiness of the soup, the clear slippery noodles and the fact that the Vietnamese will put crushed black pepper on just about anything.

Two excellent meals, and if for some reason I had to head back to Saigon again on this trip, I&apos;d eat there again.

click on the image I had nearly forgotten about the Vietnamese obsession with noodles. Virtually every dish you encounter in this country contains some sort of doughy strand. There are so many noodle options I&apos;ve yet to even consume a single dish of phở, arguably Vietnam&apos;s most recognized noodle dish.

Vietnamese noodles usually take the traditional form, such as the dish shown above, mì trứng, wheat and egg noodles with chicken.

Another standard is bún bò Huế, thick udon-like rice noodles served with slices of tender beef: But often things verge towards the unfamiliar, such as câu lầu, Hoi An&apos;s signature dish: A mixture of light brown and slightly grainy noodles, shredded herbs and slices of pork. The dish is served without broth and is garnished with squares of the noodle that have been deep-fried until crispy.

This noodle dish, also taken in Hoi An, employed short, squiggly lengths of a clear noodle and was served with a small baguette: And Vietnamese noodles don&apos;t even have to be noodle-like, as is the case with bánh bèo: round disks concealed under a shrimp-based dressing, clear shrimp-filled dumplings and Vietnamese sausage.

click on the image Lonely Planet&apos;s Vietnam reckons that Bánh Xèo 46A makes the best bánh xèo in Saigon. I&apos;m certainly no authority on the dish, a type of Vietnamese filled crepe, but I reckon Bánh Xèo 46A do the best version of the dish I&apos;ve had.

Unlike the bánh xèo served in Laos and Thailand (where it&apos;s known as khanom beuang yuan ), where the crepe is often paper-thin and crispy, the dish here is pleasantly eggy, hearty and relatively thick. The filling was also slightly different than bánh xèo I&apos;ve had previously, and in addition to the usual shrimp, sliced shallots and bean sprouts, included thin slices of fatty pork belly. Watching the locals eat I also learned the definitive way to attack a dish of bánh xèo: roll a hearty hunk of the crepe up in an entire lettuce leaf until you have something the size and shape of a spring roll, and using your hand, dip it in the dipping sauce.

click on the image I didn&apos;t really take to Hoi An. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the city&apos;s famed Chinese and French-colonial-style buildings were beautiful, and the setting was pleasant. But virtually every single structure seemed dedicated to selling t-shirts or overpriced food to tourists, and there seemed to be more of the latter than locals. And on top of all this, when I was in town, the town&apos;s central market was in the process of being rebuilt, which apparently caused many of the local vendors I had read about at EatingAsia to stay at home. That&apos;s why, after having walked around in search of a meal on my first day, I was happy to discover the scene below: This street vendor was feeding a steady stream of satisfied locals, and was one of the few eating options in Hoi An&apos;s old town that didn&apos;t seem to be aimed specifically at Western tourists.

A closer look, not to mention help from a friendly local, revealed that she was making bánh bèo nhân tôm (pictured above), a round noodle steamed in a ceramic cup. At each order the woman tops the noodle with a creamy orange mixture made from shrimp, and a sprinkling of crispy croutons: The dish had a lot in common with cao lầu , another of Hoi An&apos;s signature dishes, both in the slightly dark colour of the noodle and in the use of croutons. The result was equal parts soft, salty, creamy and crunchy -- a perfect example of the disparate ingredients, flavours and textures the Vietnamese are so absolutely brilliant at combining.

click on the image I must admit that of the reasons I was most excited to visit Vietnam was because I knew I&apos;d be able to consume bánh mì, Vietnamese-style baguette sandwiches, on a daily basis. This dish is virtually non-existent in Bangkok, and is in my opinion, the perfect sandwich. Unfortunately, other than coincidentally stumbling across the same delicious bánh mì in Saigon that was mentioned at EatingAsia , most bánh mì I encountered during my week in Vietnam were hastily put together and not entirely delicious.

This was until I arrived in Hoi An and came across Phương. Judging by the throng of impatient customers alone, I knew this would be the bánh mì I had been expecting: I ordered bánh mì pâté, a crispy submarine of bread filled, assembly line-style, with peppery pork liver pâté, slices of barbecued pork, thin slices of cucumber and tomato, a few sprigs of cilantro, hot pepper sauce and a final sprinkling of Maggi: The result was crispy, meaty, oily, spicy and veggie; essentially everything a sandwich should be.

click on the image Often it&apos;s little more than an atmospheric locale that draws me a to a particular vendor or restaurant: Such was the case with the ancient dining room of this streetside stall in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Practically before I really even knew what was being served, I&apos;d taken a seat and placed an order.

It was a few seconds later that I learned that I&apos;d be eating  bánh canh cá lóc: Not knowing exactly what this was, I watched with wonder how patties of a pasty white dough were rolled onto PVC pipes: Thin slices of the dough were chopped off directly into the broth: forming the noodles of the dish (shown at the top of this post). I found them a bit chalky, but liked the broth and other ingredients, which included fillets of snakehead fish (the epynomous cá lóc), oily and orange from having been fried with turmeric, chunks of giờ, a type of Vietnamese sausage, a single quail&apos;s egg and heaps of green onion.

The sides, present on every table, included banana leaf packages of delicious giờ and nem (fermented pork sausage), and tiny hard-boiled quail&apos;s eggs, which were meant to be dipped in a salt and chili mixture. I grew to love these sides in Vietnam, and they made every meal a fun experience.

click on the image How many different dishes can one make with some form of carbohydrate, shrimp and the occasional pork rind? Leave it to the Vietnamese to have created a fantastic number of dishes using these relatively limited ingredients, all of them creative and delicious.

I became aware of this at a restaurant called Hàng Me in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. Although located steps from the backpacker strip, the place was filled with locals and littered with the banana leaves used to steam the various dishes -- both signs of good eats.

I started with the dish above, bánh bèo. Mentioned previously , the dish takes the form of a noodle steamed in a ceramic cup and topped with a savoury shrimp mixture and pork rinds. I enjoyed this one even more than the one in Hoi An: the noodle at Hàng Me was soft and slightly salty, and pork rinds make just about anything taste better.

Another variant on the noodle-and-shrimp theme was bánh nam: This was my favourite item of the meal. The noodle, steamed in a banana leaf: was again incredibly tender and savoury, and the shrimp topping was deliciously meaty, fatty and rich.

Bánh ram ít were almost identical to bánh bèo, except that the noodle here is perched on a crispy round of pork rind: Bánh loc, another combination of carb and shrimp, was steamed in what I assume was a bamboo leaf: The noodle element was apparently made from tapioca flour and is supplemented with two shrimps and a piece of fatty pork belly. The slightly rubbery texture of the noodle and the fact that the shrimp weren&apos;t shelled made this my least favourite item of the meal.

As I was about to leave, they brought out a few slices of freshly-made chả tôm, steamed &apos;cake&apos; of prawns: Eggy, meaty, and, at that point at least, graciously lacking a noodle element, it was a perfect end to my most memorable meal in Vietnam.

click on the image If you&apos;ll recall , back in February I spent a month in the northern Thai city of Mae Hong Son. Cool weather, great scenery, great food and ample opportunity to explore combined to make the month one of the most pleasant of my life, and ever since then I&apos;ve dreaming, virtually on a daily basis, of going back.

In mid-August I finally got my chance, and this time was accompanied by Chef Andy of Pok Pok fame, Chef Hock and for two brief days, Maytel (herself more a Restaurant Manager than a Chef). We spent a week in Mae Hong Son, and as Maytel describes here , there was a great deal cooking and eating, although unfortunately not as much exploring as I&apos;d like to have done. I&apos;ve never previously been to Mae Hong Son during the wet season, and found it to be very... wet. Due to the rain, we were largely housebound the first two days and a couple days after that, I came down with a flu and was housebound again for a few more days... Needless to say, this was something of a disappointment after so many months of wanting to come back, but in the end it was worth it simply for the moments of health and clear weather and scenes such as the above.

A couple food-related blogs to follow.

click on the image As mentioned previously, Mae Hong Son was pretty wet, so we spent a lot of our time indoors, much of it eating and drinking. Of all the things we consumed there, I&apos;m pretty sure that the local sweets were the biggest hit among the two chefs. We bought several banana leaf packages of the sweets on a daily basis, and they never seemed to tire of them.

Our sole khanom purveyor was Pa Ni, a native of Mae Hong Son who was taught by her mother to make Shan/Thai Yai-style sweets over forty years ago. My personal fave of her repertoire is something called peng mong : According to Pa Ni, this one is made using what she calls paeng mi , &quot;noodle flour&quot; (I suspect this simply wheat flour), and has the consistency of a Western-style cake, with a salty/sweet coconut topping acting as the frosting. Because of the crumb-like consistency of the sweet, Chef Andy reckons some sort of leavening agent is used here, a rarity in Thai sweets.

My second favourite has to be alawa jun : a significantly heavier sweet made from rice flour, ample coconut cream and a slight hint of durian (Pa Ni adds thurian kuan , durian paste, to this sweet). Like all of Pa Ni&apos;s sweets, the top is slightly singed, the result of a &quot;baking&quot; process where, after steaming the sweets, she covers the trays and tops this with a layer of hot coals.

The regular alawa : is slightly lighter and gets most of its flavour from sugar and coconut milk.

And Suay thamin : is the Shan pronunciation of the Burmese shwe thamin , &quot;golden rice&quot;, and is rather heavy sweet made from sticky rice.

click on the image The morning market in Mae Hong Son is one of my favourite in Thailand. Despite being a rather small market, and the fact that I&apos;ve spent quite a bit of time there, on each subsequent visit I always seem able to find some new ingredient or dish I wasn&apos;t previously aware of. This is partially due to the fact that Mae Hong Son is rather more seasonal than other places in Thailand. Much of what&apos;s on offer is dictated by the weather, which unfortunately during the rainy season is rather limited. I missed the bright red tomatoes and fern shoots of the cooler months, but was compensated by the variety weird edible insect larvae, tender edible fruit tree leaves and bamboo shoots of the rainy season. Year round there&apos;s always an odd selection of items from just across the border in Burma: calendars with Burmese pop stars, pickled tea leaves and packets of herbal medicines. And breakfast at the market is always one of the weirdest and most satisfying in the country.

click on the image Cambodia isn&apos;t generally known as a culinary destination, but I really enjoyed the eats during five recent days in Siem Reap. The quality of the city&apos;s foreign cuisine, particularly its French, was much better than that of a huge city like Bangkok. Among other meals, we had a fun lunch at Le Bistrot de Paris , and on a daily basis, excellent pastries from the Blue Pumpkin (unfortunately we never made it to dinner at the allegedly delicious Abacus ). And the Cambodian food was excellent too, for which I have to thank Chef Joannès Rivière, Executive Chef at Hôtel de la Paix . Chef Jo oversees a truly delicious Khmer set menu at Meric, the hotel&apos;s restaurant, which includes dishes such as his famous stuffed frog, a trio of pounded salads (coconut with pork, wild eggplant with fish, and sesame with chicken), and an equal parts tart and smokey star fuit salad with smoked fish. It was really one of the best restaurant meals I&apos;ve had in a long time, but unfortunately the restaurant was too dark to document with my crappy old Nikon D100 (you can though see a pic of Meric&apos;s famous watermelon salad here ).

The next day Jo took me to New Cheip Sok, a restaurant he recommends not only for it&apos;s kick ass Khmer food, but also for its noteworthy and classy wall of beer bottles: I left the ordering to Chef Jo. There was prahoc k&apos;tis : a delicious &apos;dip&apos; of Cambodian fish sauce, fish, herbs and coconut milk, served with fresh and par-boiled veggies. This was a dish that exemplified Khmer flavours: mild, herbal and balanced, and revolving around something fishy.

There was deep-fried pigeon: which were served with the simple but absolutely brilliant Khmer dipping sauce of salt, pepper and lime: Mam , raw Khmer-style fermented fish served with a platter of fresh herbs, veggies and fruit and slices of pork: And the house specialty, &quot;hidden eggplant&quot;, a Chinese-Khmer deep-fried dish combining minced pork and eggplant: New Chiep Sok

click on the image Other than noodles, the greatest contribution the Chinese have made to Thai cooking, at least in my opinion, is khao tom . The Thai words literally mean &quot;boiled rice,&quot; but in this case they refer to restaurants that serve a variety Chinese/Thai dishes to order, often with small bowls of watery rice. One of my favourite khao tom places in Bangkok is Khao Tom Jay Suay, an ancient shophouse restaurant in Chinatown. The restaurant is colloquially known as Khao Tom Roy Pee, &quot;100 Year Old Khao Tom,&quot; but I was told it&apos;s really only about 50 years old.

You can recognise Khao Tom Jay Suay by the vast table out front holding the restaurant&apos;s huge array of raw ingredients, mostly different types of vegetables: Directly behind this, and shown at the top of this post, a fellow works a station with several prepared dishes. These include several types of meats and fish, a few stir-fried dishes and soups such as jap chai , a type of vegetable-heavy Chinese stew. He shouts the orders out to two additional stations within the restaurant,  a soup station and a separate stir-fry station, and as far as I could tell, no order is recorded on paper.

Must-order dishes at Jay Suay include the delicious smoked duck; muu phat nam liap , minced pork fried with salted Chinese olive; the previously-mentioned jap chai; and any flash-fried veggie dish. On our visit we ordered all of these, as well as a stink bean stir-fry, a tom yam of squid and mushrooms, and a salad of plaa salit thot , a type of deep-fried fish: You&apos;ll be sitting on the side of a smelly street and it will inevitably be hot, but the food is full-flavoured and excellent.

click on the image Operating since 1983, Shoshana must be the longest-standing Israeli restaurant in the Khao San Road area, if not in all of Bangkok. Nowadays there are several places in the area serving pitas, felafel and even shwarma, but I inevitably go back to Shoshana. This used to be partially for the constant stream of Seinfeld re-runs being played there (I&apos;ve never owned a TV), but was mostly for a delicious break from Thai food.

As is the case with many of my favourite places to eat, I rarely stray from a few dishes that I know to be good. The set above, my usual, combines felafel, French fries, a garlicky eggplant dip and &quot;Israeli salad&quot;.  I seem to recall the set selling for 55 baht until relatively recently, making Shoshana also the cheapest place in Bangkok to obtain Western-style food. The price has gone up 120 baht now, but it still remains a bargain, especially when you consider the quality. Although they&apos;re not breaking any gastronomical barriers, the folks at Shoshana are extremely talented at deep-frying -- this despite not using a Western-style deep-fryer (they use cheap aluminum pots) or deep-frying thermometers. Their skills are evident in the non-soggy and super-crispy French fries to the dry-yet-moist-in-the-right-places schnitzel. They also do good liver dishes, decent home-made pickles (shown in the background) and a decent yogurt shake.

click on the image Hat Yai is a large, rather unattractive town in southern Thailand. It&apos;s by no means a destination, but because the city serves as a crossroads to many places farther south, I&apos;ve spent quite a few nights here over the years. Fortunately there are worse places to be stuck, particularly if you count eating as one of your hobbies. The residents of Hat Yai are a mix of Thais, Chinese and Muslims and they have provided the city with an interesting restaurant scene. Just in case you happen to find yourself stuck in Hat Yai at some point, I&apos;ve put together a short list of the places that have caught my attention over the years that I&apos;ve been going there.

My favourite single dish in Hat Yai has to be the dish above, bak kut teh , as served at Koh Tii Ocha, a Chinese food court-like restaurant in the centre of town. The name of the dish is Chinese, but EatingAsia claim the dish has its origins in Malaysia. The dish is served with your choice of meat and offal (and typically an entire clove of garlic) and sides of rice and paa thong ko , deep-fried dough with a sweet coconut jam dip. The broth is dark, rich and evocative of the dish&apos;s Hokkien name (bak kut teh is generally translated as &quot;meat bone tea&quot;). Koh Tii Ocha also serves Hainanese chicken rice, wheat noodles and rice porridge.

Rice is cooked with dork anchan , a type of flower, giving it a purplish/gray hue, and is topped with finely sliced herbs, flowers, fruit, ground dried shrimp, thin rice noodles and a thin fish-based sauce. One of the better versions in Hat Yai is served by a Muslim woman who  prepares the dish a couple blocks away from the train station: Muslim Khao Yam (Google Maps link )

Chicken, marinated in dried spices before being deep-fried, is a specialty of Hat Yai that has a reputation across Thailand. Many locals claim that Daycha, a restaurant with a couple branches in town, serves the best version. You can order it with sticky rice and a plate of som tam or chopped and served over yellow rice: Daycha Fried Chicken (Google Maps link )

Hat Yai has a huge Chinese population, and Chinese food is ubiquitous, cheap and generally quite good. One of my favourite places to eat is Sor Hueng, a khao tom place with several branches serving mostly Chinese and Chinese/Thai dishes, with a few local dishes thrown in as well. Most dishes are made ahead of time and all you have to do is point to whatever looks tasty: Sor Hueng 3 (Google Maps link )

Hat Yai also has two pretty good night markets. The most famous is located north of the centre of town and is a great place to sit down to a dish of the local deep-fried chicken, a southern-style curry, a dish or khanom jeen , or some local seafood: Hat Yai&apos;s Night Market (Google Maps link )

click on the image When at home in Bangkok I tend to eat a pretty western-style breakfast (toast, eggs, yogurt), so when I&apos;m on the road in different parts of Thailand I really look forward to getting my hands on a domestic breakfast. I certainly wasn&apos;t disappointed in Songkhla, an atmospheric seaside town in southern Thailand. The southern Thais have some of the best morning eats in the country, and Songkhla was no exception. It was a morning of several southern Thai specialties and sweet coffee in several different locations.

My favourite place for breakfast in Songkhla is probably an open-air streetside courtyard just off Th Saiburi with different three vendors. One vendor makes old-school style Thai coffee and tea, other vendor makes a delicious khao yam (illustrated above), and another couple make roti : The crispy pancakes are served southern-style, with a curry and a sweet/sour cucumber dipping sauce. Continuing along Th Nang Ngam, a street lined with old houses and Chinese shrines, I came across this woman, selling noodles to students in front of a school: Her husband was equally busy, selling cups of pop to the kids, at 7am...

Just up the road I stopped by a an old shophouse restaurant for a salapao , a Chinese steamed bun, and a yet another coffee: The coffee wasn&apos;t so good, but the salapao contained a delicious mixed pork mixture and a quail egg. This was the kind of place that families stopped by on their way to work and/or school, and I got the impression that most of then had been coming there for a long time.

Continuing to the end of Th Nang Ngam, my last stop was at an even more ancient, Muslim-owned coffee shop (which has also been blogged about here ): with equally ancient interior design and clientele: I left Songkhla shortly after, feeling full and fully caffeinated...

click on the image For the first time I&apos;ll be attending, and blogging about, the Four Seasons Bangkok&apos;s annual World Gourmet Festival. This year is the 10th anniversary of the event, and chefs such as David Kinch, from the acclaimed Manresa in California, and David Thompson from London&apos;s Nahm, will be in town cooking, teaching and leading culinary tours to celebrate the occasion. I plan to attend the dinners of these two chefs, as well as those of Graham Elliot Bowles of Chicago&apos;s Graham Elliot , Paola Carosella of Sao Paolo&apos;s Arturito, Christine Manfield of Sydney&apos;s Universal , and Fulvio Saccardi of Ristorante Conti Roero in Monticello D&apos;Alba, Italy.

Leading up to the event, I&apos;ll be doing some brief profiles of the chefs above, and when the festival begins, I&apos;ll be blogging on the cooking demonstrations and meals, as well as interviews with some of the chefs.

The event will be held from October 5-11, at the Four Seasons Bangkok . For full details of the chefs involved and a schedule of the events planned, please refer to the official website . Some dinners are already sold out, so if you&apos;re in Bangkok and interested, act fast. Call the Four Seasons at +66 (0) 2 126 8866, or email the hotel at wgf.bangkok@fourseasons.com.

click on the image On the surface, Khao Noi appears to be your typical southern Thai-style raan khao kaeng , curry restaurant. A closer look reveals that Khao Noi is anything but ordinary. The tiny restaurant prepares nearly 50 dishes on a daily basis: and most un-ordinarily, every one I&apos;ve ever tried there is delicious.

On my most recent visit I had a plate of rice topped with two dishes: muu phat phet , pork fried with a spicy curry paste, fresh herbs and spices, and kaeng khi lek , a southern Thai-style coconut milk curry of cassia leaves and unusually, tiny shrimp (pictured at the top of this post). The phat phet, as the name suggests, was satisfyingly spicy, and the kaeng khi lek equal parts bitter and savoury. All dishes are served, in the southern style, with a side of crispy veggies to alleviate the heat.

I couldn&apos;t stop at this and my second dish included a yam or salad of green mango and a coconut milk curry of &quot;stink beans&quot; ( sator ), eggplant and fish: The salad was crispy and sour, and the curry was rich and pungent -- a perfect combination.

click on the image I happened to be in Pattani, one of Thailand&apos;s most Muslim cities, during Ramadan. I had read about the post-fasting markets held in Muslim countries during this holiday, and after talking to a few motorcycle taxi drivers, learned that was a large one held not far from Pattani&apos;s central mosque: There was a huge amount of hungry people and interesting food. The latter ran the gamut from traditional Muslim items such as roti: and dates, a traditional fast-breaking food: to more local foods, such as southern-style Muslim curries (shown at the top of this post) and khanom kho : impossibly soft pillows of rice flour encasing a crunchy cube of sugarcane. There was a popular vendor selling buffalo stew: identified by its strong smell, not to mention the carefully-displayed tell-tale hooves and horn. And of course, several vendors selling the ubiquitous khao yam : By the time it started to get dark, much of the food was virtually sold out and the crowds were already thin, with most folks presumably on their way home with the day&apos;s meal.

click on the image Since I was already in far southern Thailand, I decided to cross the border and spend a few days in Malaysia. Specifically, I wanted to spend some time in Kota Bharu, apparently one of Malaysia&apos;s more traditionally Muslim areas, during Ramadan. I was hoping to soak up some of the holiday atmosphere, eat some good Malaysian food and to hit up more post-fasting markets. I also wanted to check out Pasar Siti Khadijah, Kota Bharu Malaysia&apos;s famous Central Market, which I had read about previously here .

Well, things didn&apos;t go exactly as planned. Kota Bharu was practically comatose during Ramadan. The streets were eerily empty and all shops were closed. Thankfully the evening market was functioning, which I&apos;ll blog about soon, but virtually no restaurants, other than a mediocre Chinese noodle place, were open. In the end, I was able to hit up Kota Bharu&apos;s striking indoor market one day (it was closed the next for Aidilfitri), although the results are only marginally food-related, and more an excuse to show off my cool glass :

click on the image As mentioned previously, my plan was to spend a few days in Kota Bharu, one of Malaysia&apos;s more staunchly Muslim cities, during Ramadan. I was looking forward to the holiday atmosphere, not to mention some extreme holiday eating at markets like the one I&apos;d encountered in Pattani . Paradoxically, this wasn&apos;t to be the case, as because of Ramadan, all shops and restaurants were closed and most of Kota Bharu&apos;s residents seemed to be elsewhere.

There also appeared to be no equivalent of a special Ramadan post-fast market in Kota Bharu, although the town&apos;s evening market was particularly buzzing. Most dishes sold at the market were served to go: typically bundled up in sheets of brown waxed paper. But if you wanted to eat at the market it was possible to take your bundle to a stall selling drinks, order a drink, and eat there.

These fish were coated in a curry paste-like marinade and pan-grilled on banana leaves: There was heaps of grilled food: particularly chicken: but I really enjoyed the curry stalls (pictured at the top of this post), which served rich, meaty curries over rice, as well as nasi kerabu, the local equivalent of khao yam , blue rice topped with sliced fresh herbs and other toppings.

The sweets were also impressive, both in terms of quantity: and variety: On the eve of Aidilfitri, the last day of Ramadan, I waited in a very long and competitive line for two bundles of rice and took them to a drink stall. Most diners had already bought their meals, staked out a table, and were patiently waiting for the moment when they could eat again. Finally, just after 7pm, prayers were broadcast from the mosques in the area and after a month of daily fasting, Ramadan was over and people dug in:

click on the image It&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve posted something on this half of the blog, mostly because I haven&apos;t been taking too many pics lately. Other than the occasional photography assignment, I&apos;ve predominately been working on guidebooks and other writing projects. It was during this photographic drought that I mentioned to a friend that I&apos;d always wanted to check out a look thung concert, roughly equivalent to Thai-style country music. I got the hook-up (thanks, Angie!), and this afternoon I found myself at Suan Lum Night Bazaar, taking pics from the audience as well as backstage. I&apos;ve previously posted photos of other Thai performances, from ngiw to likay , previously, and it&apos;s a topic I&apos;d like to pursue, so stay tuned for more in the future.

click on the image Last night was the first dinner of the Four Seasons Bangkok&apos;s World Gourmet Festival! Our chef host was Graham Elliot Bowles, of Chicago&apos;s graham elliot . I&apos;d read that Bowles&apos;s food is strongly influenced by American cuisine, apparently stemming from his youth as ‘Navy Brat,’ having lived (and eaten) from the Philippines to Hawaii, California to Maryland. Deconstructed Caesar salad: baby romaine, white anchovy, Parmesan fluff, brioche Twinkie I found this to be true, and to my enjoyment virtually ever dish was evocative of the tastes, flavours and ingredients I&apos;d grown up with as a kid in the US. The strongest example of this, for me at least, was Bowles&apos;s Sweet corn bisque: Sweet corn bisque with garlic marshmallow, pepper jam, Corn Nuts and lime crema which, when poured, smelled exactly like the very American creamed corn , a soup I haven&apos;t encountered in a very long time. The garlic marshmallow was sweeter than I expected it to be, but this was countered by the subtle spiciness of the pepper jam. And I think this was the first time in perhaps 20 years I&apos;ve consumed Corn Nuts .

The Barbecued pork belly: Barbecued pork belly with cole slaw, potato salad, fried pickles, root beer was similarly evocative, combining all the best elements of a southern American-style barbecue (another thing I haven&apos;t eaten in ages): cole slaw, potato salad and tender pork. The root beer sauce, although unusual, was comfortingly ketchup-like and delicious.

Bowles&apos;s dessert, Movie theater extravaganza: Movie Theatre Extravaganza: popcorn gelato, Malt Balls, Twizzler puree, Cracker Jack was heaps of fun, and included even more ingredients I haven&apos;t encountered since my childhood. The popcorn gelato was deliciously buttery and savoury, and although I&apos;d almost certainly never even consider eating Twizzlers as an adult, the flavour was a perfect sweet/sour counterpoint. The Malt Balls and Cracker Jack provided a satisfying crunch.

The meal was accompanied by several Kendall-Jackson wines, of which our entire table really enjoyed the Grand Reserve Chardonnay 2006, and I couldn&apos;t stop sniffing the Grand Reserve Merlot 2005 (it tasted lovely too).

click on the image Prawns with shredded herbs/Nahm yaa sai gung sap I&apos;m always excited when David Thompson is in town. I first met him several years ago when he hosted a dinner at the Metropolitan Bangkok, and we&apos;ve stayed in touch since then, having had quite a few food-based adventures together in Thailand. Although David is often associated with his London restaurant, Nahm , the only Thai restaurant to have received Michelin stardom, he&apos;s also established himself as an author. His second book, Thai Food , is widely considered the most authoritative English-language book on the topic, and his third book, Thai Street Food , has just been printed and will soon be available in Australia (the rest of the world has to wait until next October). And fans of Thompson&apos;s cooking who live here in Bangkok have something else to be excited about: the chef has recently agreed to open a branch of Nahm at the Metropolitan Bangkok, to be open sometime next year. Yesterday, as part of the Four Seasons Bangkok&apos;s World Gourmet Festival , Thompson demonstrated three different recipes featuring khanom jeen , what he reckons is the only type of noodle native to Southeast Asia. David Thompson and Bangkok-based blogger, Newley Purnell The recipe below, which Thompson suspects has its origins in the 1950s, requires relatively few exotic ingredients and is, according to him, more accessible to an audience outside of Thailand. Prawns with shredded herbs/ Nahm yaa sai gung sap 500 g medium small prawns
1 cup coconut cream
a few tablespoons stock or water
pinch of salt
1 – 2 tablespoons fish sauce
pinch palm sugar
2 tablespoons sliced red shallots
1 heaped tablespoon sliced Thai garlic
2 tablespoons sliced lemongrass
½ teaspoon sliced galangal
4 tablespoons shredded grachai (a root also known as Chinese key)
several sliced scuds – optional
a little additional fish sauce – to taste
3 – 4 shredded kaffir lime leaves
additional ½ cup coconut cream

Peel the prawns. Carefully de-vein. They should now weigh about 250 g. Scrape out any tomalley – there should be about 3 tablespoons.

Bring the coconut cream to the boil with the salt. Add the tomalley and simmer for a minute or two. Season the sauce with the fish sauce and palm sugar. Add the prawns and when just cooked, add the chopped prawns and the sliced ingredients and simmer for a moment: Finish with the additional coconut cream, the fish sauce if needed. Stir in most of the kaffir lime leaves. Serve sprinkled with the remaining kaffir lime leaves. It should taste rich and creamy, aromatic and just a little salty and hot.

Serve accompanied by

* khanom jin (fresh rice noodles)
* lemon basil
* white turmeric
* sliced cucumbers
* trimmed bean sprouts

David will be hosting dinner at the Four Seasons Bangkok tonight and tomorrow, October 6&amp;7, and on the morning of the 7th, will be leading a market tour.

click on the image Yesterday, Argentinean chef Paola Carosella, of São Paulo&apos;s Arturito , held a cooking demonstration as part of the Four Seasons Bangkok&apos;s World Gourmet Festival . Carosella&apos;s love for the food of her native South America is palpable, and she showed us how to make three dishes, all based around relatively common ingredients and representative of South American flavours, including a very Argentinean roast beef with chimichurri, an orange-scented dulche de leche flan, and a deliciously tart Peruvian ceviche: Paola Carosella&apos;s ceviche Carosella spent a year traveling and eating in Peru, and explained that her ceviche recipe is the result of this experience and is a classic version of the dish. She explained that ceviche can be made with whatever seafood is available, shrimp, octopus or even sea urchin, with the caveat being that it must be very fresh. She combines her ceviche with a small amount of leche de tigre, literally &quot;tiger&apos;s milk,&quot; a blended ceviche that, in Peru, is typically served in shot glasses, sometimes supplemented with pisco, a type of local grappa. Carosella added that in Peru, ceviche is also often served with some sort of crispy side dish, in this case, sweet potatoes fried until golden. Paola Carosella&apos;s Ceviche For the avocado cream:
2 fresh avocados
1 lime
sea salt

For the sweet potatoes:
1 kg sweet potatoes
vegetable oil

For the leche de tigre:
100g white fish
200ml water
sea salt
15 g fresh chilies
50 g white onion
2 garlic cloves
lime juice

For the ceviche:
1 kg extremely fresh white fish
1 kg limes
1 kg red onions
100 g sea salt
200 g fresh chilies
200 g fresh cilantro/coriander
100 g garlic

For the avocado cream
Put the avocados in a blender along with juice of one lime and a pinch of salt. Puree and keep refrigerated.

For the sweet potatoes
Boil the sweet potatoes skin-on in salted water until tender. Allow to cool, cut into slices and fry until golden and crispy. Keep warm.

For the leche de tigre
Combine all ingredients in a blender for a few minutes. Strain and keep refrigerated.

For the ceviche
Peel and cut onions into very thin slices. Clean and separate cilantro/coriander leaves and chop. Cut fish into thin slices or cubes. In a glass bowl, season fish with sea salt and the juice of the limes, add the leche de tigre, chilies, onion and cilantro/coriander. Mix well and keep refrigerated until serving.

To serve, spoon a little of the avocado cream in each plate. Put a slice of sweet potato on the side and add ceviche and juices. Serve immediately.

click on the image Chef David Kinch&apos;s Tomato soup, barely cooked, with coriander ice I was particularly excited about meeting David Kinch and trying his food. Chef friends here in Bangkok have long been relaying the buzz of his California restaurant, Manresa , and I&apos;ve long been obsessed with the Spanish flavours and ingredients that partially inspire much of his food. Not to mention the fact that, a few years back, I spent a fun afternoon in Bangkok with David&apos;s longtime Thai partner, Pim, of Chez Pim fame. Before attending Kinch&apos;s cooking demonstration, I spent a few minutes talking with the chef, and an excerpt from our conversation is below: Chef David Kinch giving a cooking demonstration at the Four Seasons Bangkok&apos;s World Gourmet Festival AB: In looking at what you do at Manresa, it appears that there&apos;s a huge emphasis on locality. With this in mind, is it even possible to recreate what you do at Manresa here in Bangkok? DK: Absolutely not. At Manresa we strive for a certain sense of place, which can&apos;t be done anywhere else. To take this out of the equation is a giant curve ball for us. We have to come to these events with more ambiguous menus. For instance, I&apos;ll say that I want to use fish in a dish rather than have a specific kind of fish in mind. AB: So you haven&apos;t brought any ingredients over from your garden or Love Apple Farm [the California farm that supplies the vast majority of Manresa&apos;s produce]? DK: No, it&apos;s just not practical. AB: Will you incorporating any Thai flavours or ingredients while here? DK: No, we&apos;re simply trying to provide a snapshot of our restaurant. I definitely wouldn&apos;t feel comfortable making Thai food here. AB: Your influences appear to come largely from Spain and Japan, two disparate food cultures. Are there any similarities between these two cuisines? DK: I&apos;d say that my influences are more generally European, but I&apos;m still very much a Francophile at heart. Respect for the product and tradition are paramount in both places. AB: Many of the chefs here, particularly the Australians, have published books. Do you have any book plans? DK: I&apos;m working on a book about a couple of meals I cooked for a friend. He&apos;s a jazz musician and has composed songs for the meals, which will be sold as a CD along with the book. AB: As a restaurateur, how do you feel about amateur media, such as blogs? DK: Everyone is allowed their opinion. But there are a lot of people blogging irresponsibly. People don&apos;t always get the facts right and sometimes misidentify dishes or ingredients. And there are a lot of bad photos. The photos people take are of our products, and when they look bad, this makes our product look bad.

For today&apos;s cooking demonstration, Kinch demonstrated three recipes: Slow roasted rack of lamb with exotic spices: Chef David Kinch&apos;s Rack of lamb with exotic spices Tomato soup, barely cooked, with coriander ice (pictured at the top of this post), and a combination of desserts he calls A taste of New Orleans: Chef David Kinch&apos;s A taste of New Orleans Both dishes pictured above will be featured in Kinch&apos;s dinner at the Four Seasons Bangkok on October 10th and 11th, but I thought I&apos;d share his recipe for the tomato soup, as it&apos;s probably the easiest to recreate. Tomato  soup, barely cooked, with coriander ice Kinch explained that the most important element in making this dish is to slowly bring bring the tomato soup to a maximum temperature of 150F. This relatively low heat allows some of the tomatoes to become fully cooked while allowing other parts to remain essentially raw, resulting in a soup that has the best elements of both the cooked and raw fruit. Kinch also uses a hand-operated food mill to process the soup, which results in it having a slightly coarse texture. If you don&apos;t have access to a food mill, Kinch suggests using a Cuisinart or Robot Coup, but not a conventional blender, as this will result in a texture that is too fine.

For the coriander ice:
1 litre chilled water
120 g sugar
3 bunches coriander/cilantro
1 bunch mint

For the tomato soup:
4 lb ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
2 oz red wine vinegar (sherry or balsamic can also be used)
12 basil leaves
2-3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
salt
pinch of sugar

For the coriander ice:
Make syrup with 200 ml of the water and chill. Chill the remaining water. Blend all ingredients in a blender and strain. Freeze and grate using a fork or a food mill.

For the tomato soup:
Combine ingredients in a large saucepan and without using a lid, bring slowly to 150F. This should take approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Process in a food mill. Strain and refrigerate.

Serve chilled, garnished with coriander ice, a basil leaf, and if desired, pickled vegetables or fruits.

click on the image I&apos;ll let you in on a little secret: Of the chefs assembled here for the Four Seasons Bangkok World Gourmet Festival, Chef Christine Manfield is easily the loveliest. And up to this point at least, I reckon that her dinner has been the tastiest. But more on that in a minute. Manfield, a native of Australia whose current outpost is the Sydney restaurant Universal , is a longstanding proponent of drawing tastes and flavours from disparate cuisines. I spent a bit of time in her kitchen leading up to her dinner (more on that to come soon) and was blown away by the diversity of ingredients she was using. Some of her vegetables seemed most likely to be bound for David Thompson&apos;s Thai meal, while some of the spices she used made the kitchen smell as if we were in Tunis or Marrakesh.

Previous to Thursday night&apos;s dinner, I had the opportunity to chat with Manfield about Australian cuisine, writing, her eclectic palate and love of travel, excerpts of which are below: AB: In talking with Australians, I often get the impression that Asian food is perceived as an essential part of what people today consider Australian Cuisine. Would you say that this is accurate? CM: Absolutely. Because there were so many Chinese miners in the past, every tinpot town in Australia has a Chinese restaurant. The food wasn&apos;t always good, but it&apos;s always been with us. The shift happened over the last 20 years, and was a result of immigration and the fact that so many Australians travel. We&apos;ve become used to this diversity, and now are even starting to appreciate the regional differences in Asian food. AB: Do you plan to incorporate any Thai flavours or ingredients while here in Bangkok? CM: Half of my repertoire stems from Thai food -- fish sauce is my salt. When I was in London, we used to get excellent Thai ingredients. In Australia it&apos;s more limited as we&apos;re on island and there are lots of restrictions. When I&apos;m here I like to use palm sugar, it&apos;s like caramel. Som saa , which is like lime, orange and kaffir lime combined, is another I like to use. I like dishes that look simple, but at the same time, have highly refined flavours. You should be able to taste every flavour in a dish. AB: Other than simply a source of inspiration for recipes, travel appears to play a central role in your life. CM: I spend half my year traveling. Last year I went on 14 overseas trips! I take my staff abroad and lead culinary tours. I think young people should be required to travel abroad. AB: Cooking is often perceived as a physical, rather than an intellectual endeavour, yet you and fellow Australian chef David Thompson are known as much for your writing as your restaurants. Why write? CM: For me, a cookbook isn&apos;t just a list of recipes. I come from an intellectual background and for me, cooking is about feeding my brain. I have a huge cookbook library and encourage my staff to read.

Now to the meal. For those here in Thailand, I thought that it was no stretch to find similarities between Manfield&apos;s dishes and the native cuisine. As she mentions above, the flavours were generally strong, independent and crystal clear, and she also didn&apos;t seem afraid to employ a bit of spice and salt. The first course, Dry aged beef tataki, pomegranate and pickled beetroot, did a great job of setting the pace for the entire meal: Chef Christine Manfield&apos;s Dry aged beef tataki, pomegranate and pickled beetroot The slices of beef were rich and moreish, and contrasted with the acidic, fruity flavours of the pomegranate, starfruit, beetroot and citrus. The meaty and acidic elements were bound together by a slightly sweet/sour onion chutney. The result was a dish that, even if it had been the only dish of the night, would have left most of us feeling mighty satisfied.

This was followed by Woodbridge smoked sea trout, smoked eel and pomelo salad: Chef Christine Manfield&apos;s Woodbridge smoked sea trout, smoked eel and pomelo salad another dish that could have easily passed as a yam or Thai-style salad in its emphasis on crispy freshness and acidity. In fact, the combination of smoked fish and thin strips of green mango was eerily similar to ngnoam swei kchey trey cha , a Cambodian dish that also revolves around these two main ingredients.

The Spiced crab, ginger and coconut broth: Chef Christine Manfield&apos;s Spiced crab, ginger and coconut broth combined, among other things, mustard seed, coconut meat and curry leaves, the ingredients that define the dipping sauce that accompanies southern-Indian dosai .

The most substantial dish (Manfield is known for serving virtually carbohydrate-free meals), was Jasmine tea smoked duck breast: Chef Christine Manfield&apos;s Jasmine tea smoked duck breast, grilled duck sausage, spiced eggplant and green bean sambal The dish was served with slices of a duck sausage that I found nearly identical to a very, very good sai ua , a type of northern Thai sausage (this was confirmed by the table of Thais next to us). The green bean sambal (essentially a stir-fry) included morning glory, grilled eggplant and green peppercorns, and was pleasantly spicy and salty (too salty for the aforementioned table). Amazingly, each dish was fried to order.

The dessert, Raspberry ripple: Chef Christine Manfield&apos;s Raspberry ripple was delicious, and included the first ripe raspberries I&apos;ve encountered in Asia in years, but seemed slightly out of place among the largely Asian-influenced flavours of the previous courses.

click on the image David Thompson and Ning Najpinij of Khao Cooking School preparing for Thompson&apos;s dinner at the Four Seasons Bangkok&apos;s World Gourmet Festival. In addition to taking part in and blogging about this year&apos;s Four Seasons Bangkok World Gourmet Festival, I also got the opportunity to put on the whites and spend a couple afternoons in the kitchen, lending a hand to prepare David Thompson&apos;s Thai meals.

This meant the unique opportunity to share a kitchen with chefs such as Thompson and Christine Manfield, not to mention the pleasure of working with the Four Season&apos;s talented and amazingly hospitable kitchen staff: As I believe I run a risk of exaggerating my part in all of this, let me make it clear that my role was strictly that of kitchen slave (Thompson&apos;s term, not mine). My contribution was limited to such technically advanced tasks as arranging quail eggs on a platter, peeling grilled chilies and stirring very heavy pots: A crappy iPhone pic of me, pitching in to make Thai sweets for David Thompson&apos;s dinner at the Four Seasons Bangkok&apos;s World Gourmet Festival It was only on the second day that I was allowed to touch a knife (with it I clumsily and slowly scored several kilos of squid), but over the two days I was able to see how several dishes were made, taste heaps of interesting food and provide input on their taste, and generally see what goes on inside the kitchen of a high-level restaurant. It was a fun and revealing experience. I&apos;ve worked in a few kitchens since I was a teenager, but it&apos;s been a very long time since those days, and I&apos;d forgotten how physically difficult it can be to stand for hours on end, just how hot kitchens are, and the risk that fingers constantly face from lazy knife work, scalding hot liquids, searing chilies and the enduring odour of squid.

Some, such as Chef Christine Manfield, served a variation on her dish served a few nights earlier: Chef Christine Manfield&apos;s Woodbridge smoked ocean trout, tea smoked oysters, blood sausage, celeriac and apple salad while others, such as foie gras king Michael Ginor, created a dish specifically for the event: Michael Ginor&apos;s Citrus butter poached lobster with sea beans and potato cream If the above doesn&apos;t already sound rich enough, Ginor&apos;s dish was then garnished with flakes of foie gras that had been cured in kelp: Chef David Kinch providing a foie gras garnish at the Four Seasons Bangkok World Gourmet Festival&apos;s Gala Dinner Behind the scenes, there was a surprising amount of cooperation between the chefs: Inside the kitchen at the Four Seasons Bangkok World Gourmet Festival&apos;s Gala Dinner such as American chef David Kinch helping Japanese chef Kazumi Sawada prepare the latter&apos;s deep-fried conger eel. There was also equally as much discipline, both in preparation and in service: Dinner service at the Four Seasons Bangkok World Gourmet Festival&apos;s Gala Dinner And the night ended with pastry chef Francois Payard&apos;s chocolate-centric creation: Chef Francois Payard&apos;s Palet d&apos;or with hot and cold chocolate and several glasses of Yamazaki malt whisky from Japan.

click on the image Chef Fulvio Siccardi shaving truffles at the Four Seasons Bangkok World Gourmet Festival Chef Fulvio Siccardi was born in Turin in the Piedmont area of north-western Italy in 1969. Since 2004 he has been owner and Chef of Ristorante Conti Roero at Monticello d’Alba , where he received his second Michelin star. His dinner for the Four Seasons Bangkok World Gourmet Festival was classically Italian, combining simple but high-quality ingredients with an emphasis on the tastes and ingredients of the country&apos;s north.

Our starter combined peppery pastrami-like sheets of beef, crispy greens and a rich mustard sauce: Chef Fulvio Siccardi&apos;s Lightly smoked marinated beef tenderloin with grain mustard and chives emulsion all of which were (generously) supplemented by truffles, shaved just before service by the chef himself (shown at the top of this post).

Our second course, which Siccardi calls alternatively Egg in jail or Vertical egg, is the his signature meal, and was quite possibly my favourite single course of the entire festival: Chef Fulvio Siccardi&apos;s Egg in jail The full name of the dish is Egg with black truffle, scented Parmesan and milk sauce, and these ingredients are combined in a special kind of heat-resistant plastic bag and baked at approximately 450F for seven minutes. To eat, we untied our bags, added the crispy croutons: Egg in jail and using a spoon, scooped out every last bit. The eggs were rich and creamy, and had a wonderful Parmesan pungency that I can still recall clearly the next day.

This was followed by a very northern Italian gnocchi with a rich ragu: Chef Fulvio Siccardi&apos;s Potato gnocchi with bra sausage and veal ragu The next course we had previously encountered at the Gala Dinner, although this version was supplemented with chanterelle mushrooms: Chef Fulvio Siccardi&apos;s Carmelized vinegar goose leg with Belgium endive and chanterelle mushroom The chef explained that with this dish he&apos;s attempted to combine all off the basic flavours: bitter from the endive, sweet and sour from the carmelized vinegar sauce and meaty and salty via the mushrooms and goose. Siccardi told us that the goose leg was cooked for several hours confit-style, but to our surprise the meat had none of the crispiness or stickiness associated with this method of cooking, and could easily have passed as sous-vide.

Dessert was three variations on yet another northern Italian dish, panna cotta: Chef Fulvio Siccardi&apos;s Panna cotta trilogy the version on the left was a seriously impossibly light cream topped with a delicious salty caramel -- it was probably my favourite dessert course of the entire festival -- while the panna cotta in the centre was supplemented with hazelnuts in the traditional manner.

Fulvio will be hosting his final dinner at the Four Seasons Bangkok tonight, October 11. Some of the events are already sold out, so if you’re in Bangkok and interested, act fast. Call the Four Seasons at +66 (0) 2 126 8866, or email the hotel at wgf.bangkok@fourseasons.com.

click on the image Piang Kee is both the most noteworthy and quirkiest restaurant I&apos;ve come across in Bangkok in a long while. For starters, the Chinatown-based restaurant specialises in Hakka Chinese dishes , a relative rarity here in Bangkok. The restaurant itself is unabashedly old-school, and the lovely middle-aged couple who have run the place for the last few decades are still incredibly enthusiastic about what they do. And to round it off, Piang Kee is both rather difficult to find and maintains inconvenient opening times, at least for those who would like to visit for dinner.

I had heard about the restaurant on a Thai television programme, and with a bit of help, was eventually able to track it down. The photos below constitute two separate visits to Piang Kee, the first with the clever food researcher who was kind enough to find the restaurant for me, and the second with Bo and Dylan of Bangkok buzz restaurant Bo.lan , and David and P&apos;Tong from London&apos;s Michelin-starred Nahm : On both visits we ordered the dishes shown at the top of this post, stuffed tofu served in a broth seasoned with khao maak , fermented rice, and &apos;drunken&apos; chicken. The former is my favourite dish, mostly because of the broth, which is made salty and red from the addition of the fermented rice, an unusual ingredient used in several dishes here. The chicken is tender and silky and made fragrant and slightly tart by the addition of the rice wine.

Another house specialty is deep-fried stuffed tofu skins: These are deliciously crispy, and like many dishes here, are filled with a mixture of minced pork and dried squid that has been dry roasted and minced. They&apos;re served, also like just about everything here, with a specific dipping sauce, in this case a syrupy plum sauce.

The house dipping sauce, on the other hand: is a simple mixture of fresh chilies and salt that is left to ferment overnight. It&apos;s amazing stuff that&apos;s pleasantly spicy and sour, and the owners suggest it as a dipping sauce to the tofu and chicken dishes above.

Another dish associated with the restaurant is dumplings made from daikon and carrot and supplemented with dried shrimp: The shrimp provide the dish with a briny taste and the thick soy sauce dip provides a sweet counterpoint, although in general I found the dumplings to be a bit gloopy and heavy.

A must-order dish is the pork belly served over preserved greens: The meat has a subtle smokiness and is fall-apart tender, and I really enjoyed the slightly crispy re-hydrated spinach.

On one visit there was a dish of sliced pork belly: a specific type of pork belly, according to the owner, and served chilled over bean sprouts with a tart/spicy dressing.

One of my favourite dishes at Piang Kee is goat braised in red sauce: extremely meaty and rich, with a subtle herbal flavour. As is the case elsewhere in Chinatown, the dish is served with a thin dipping sauce based around dried galangal.

The couple do their own perfectly-seasoned fishballs, made from plaa kray , a type of freshwater fish: and a very unusual stir-fry of lettuce and the ubiquitous khao maak: Somebody ordered kaeng jeut , normally a predominately salty broth: but in this case both salty, from pork and dried squid dumplings, and aggressively tart, from the used of dried plum.

And fermented rice was employed yet again in this stir-fry of thin rice noodles and pork: A dish that was rather bland on its own, but wonderful when taken with a bit of the wonderful chili sauce.

The restaurant normally closes at 6pm, but if you want to have a slightly later dinner and can speak Thai (or Hakka), call ahead and I imagine you&apos;ll find that they&apos;re normally willing to accommodate.

click on the image Phai Kiaw (&apos;Green Bamboo&apos;) is, as far as I&apos;m aware, the only place in Bangkok where one can get Sichuan-style hot pot. It&apos;s not as delicious as the huo guo I&apos;ve encountered in China, but is a fair approximation, and a welcome change from MK or Coca (the preeminent Thai hot pot chains). The broth at Phai Khiaw is possibly even oilier and spicier than I remember it being in China, but Phai Khiaw&apos;s ingredients are on the whole probably better, and on my most recent visit (pictured above) we also ordered several other Chinese dishes and everything was quite tasty indeed.

At the end of the meal, and to our surprise, our buddy W pulled out a bottle of absinthe. We dug in, and Phai Khiaw&apos;s Burmese/Chinese staff didn&apos;t seem to notice, let alone mind, that we were in their restaurant burning sugar on suspicious-looking spoons: It was my first time drinking the stuff, and the picture below, depicting the tuk tuk ride to our next destination, pretty much sums up the night: Or was it the Sichuan pepper?

click on the image I&apos;m a bit late on relaying this, but Thailand&apos;s annual Jay or vegetarian festival is currently is full swing. I&apos;ve made a couple trips to Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, the centre of activity, and I can report with confidence that the offerings are as vegetable-free and oily as ever: Although, at least as far as I&apos;m aware, there have never been claims that the food sold during the vegetarian festival includes vegetables or is supposed to be healthy, I&apos;m shocked at how overwhelmingly veggie-free and deep-fried, and how eerily meat-like the offerings are (is going without meat for 10 days really so difficult that it necessitates the invention of mock pork intestines?). A more accurate name for the event would be the Deep-Fried Fake Meat and Carbohydrate festival. I also find it fascinating that an event with apparent origins in sacrifice and asceticism has instead become an exercise in gluttonous indulgence. But I&apos;d be a hypocrite to slag off anything with copious amounts of food as a central tenet, particularly when this is the only time of the year when I can get freshly-made khanom tub tap . This is a sweet made by pounding syrup and peanuts into a flaky shell (the process of which is pictured at the top of this post), which then is stretched and rolled around more ground peanuts -- the Asian version of a Butterfinger candy bar.

Enjoy the meat-free fun until Tuesday, October 29. But if it&apos;s veggies you&apos;re looking for, I&apos;d suggest staying at home and fixing yourself a nice salad.

click on the image While in Hong Kong I got the chance to eat at some Michelin-starred restaurants (one of which I&apos;ll blog on soon) and a few other similarly upscale places, but to be honest, what I really wanted to do was eat what regular Hong Kong people eat. I finally got my chance at Nathan Congee and Noodle, a closet-sized restaurant in Kowloon.

The place is allegedly famous with local foodies, but also apparently has a reputation among visitors, as the menu was written in, of all languages, Thai: We started with a few classic Hong Kong-style side dishes, such as kai lan with oyster sauce: jellyfish salad with 1000 year-old eggs: and lettuce with oyster sauce: But the emphasis here is congee, made to order by a man in a small booth: I ordered a bowl of fishball congee (shown at the top of this post), and like the bowls of the stuff I&apos;ve encountered in Thailand, it was pleasantly bland, blandly pleasant, inoffensive stuff. I&apos;ve never been a huge fan of congee, but can see why others like it, and by all standards, this was a pretty good bowl. I particularly liked the crispy deep-fried fingers of dough, which unlike other places, were still crispy.

Despite it not being the most delicious meal of my trip, I probably found it the most memorable, simply because it seemed representative of what people in Hong Kong really liked to eat, and didn&apos;t involve foam.

click on the image In 2008 the Michelin guide expanded its borders to include Hong Kong and Macau. This gained quite a bit of attention in the international media, as the influential guide had previously limited itself to fine dining in Western countries. This apparently also generated a great deal of interest in Hong Kong, as in an effort to promote the accomplishment, I was taken to two Michelin-starred restaurants on my recent press trip there. Of these, the restaurant that stands out the most in my mind is Yung Kee, a nearly 60 year-old Hong Kong staple and recent recipient of a single Michelin star.

Unfortunately, we arrived at Yung Kee at the end of a day in which I&apos;d probably eaten more than any previous in my life. In the space of a few hours we&apos;d been to a Japanese buffet, an old-school dim sum restaurant and now this. But the food at Yung Kee was so good, I somehow found a way to make room.

Yung Kee&apos;s most famous dish by far is its roast goose: I&apos;m not a huge fan of duck or goose in general, but enjoyed this well enough -- it was pleasantly meaty, oily, crispy and tender. But I was more blown away by Yung Kee&apos;s dictionary perfect stir-fried dishes, which due to our somewhat uncollaborative ordering, comprised the remainder of our meal. These included Shredded chicken with chili: the chili in this case actually a very mild bell pepper, which like all of the restaurant&apos;s ingredients, was expertly and attractively sliced, and like all vegetables to follow, was perfectly fried, retaining all of its fresh crispiness. There was Chinese sausage fried with kai lan: the sausages, which I think were a mixture of pork and goose liver, were on the waxy side, as Chinese sausages typically are, but again this was a masterpiece of deft stir-frying and subtle-yet-adequate seasoning. Sauteed sliced beef and vegetable was similar: although here, for me at least, it was the meat the stood out. The beef appeared to have been pounded until tender and marinated, giving it a nearly fall-apart texture and a pleasantly salty flavour. Again, the technique took the forefront here, and the beef was simultaneously just-cooked and partially singed. Our final stir-fry was eggplant flash-fried with crab meat: I can&apos;t imagine this dish involved more than five ingredients (eggplant, crab meat, salt, oil and perhaps a bit of corn starch), but was wonderful: smokey, well-seasoned and relatively un-oily -- everything a good stir-fried dish should be.

Reeling from having consumed so much food, I sat back and looked around the restaurant and noticed that, despite the accolades, Yung Kee appeared more or less like any other upscale-ish restaurant in Asia: there were a few tourists, but most diners appeared to be middle-to-upper-class locals, including several families. The dining room was boisterous and service was equal parts professional and informal. It struck me that this is exactly what a lauded restaurant should be like -- excellent food that everybody can enjoy without the baggage of formality and snobbery. I can&apos;t wait for the chance go back to Yung Kee on an empty stomach and try a greater repertoire of dishes.

click on the image I&apos;ve always liked the idea of dim sum -- countless small Chinese dishes served with an endless flow of green tea (one of my favourite things to drink) sounds wonderful to me -- but I&apos;d yet to encounter a version that I truly enjoyed. My first authentic dim sum meals in Macau and Malaysia were fun, but too meaty and oily for my taste, while much of the dim sum I&apos;ve come across in Thailand has been processed and flavourless (in addition to being meaty and oily). I thought for sure that I would finally meet my fantasy dim sum in Hong Kong, a city virtually synonymous with the dish, and to a certain extent, I did. In Lin Heung Tea House I found a restaurant that fit my preconceived notion of how a dim sum place should be: a great old hall complete with grumpy waiters, creaking trolleys, old men reading newspapers, lazy ceiling fans and lots of cigarette smoke and tea. But as with previous attempts, I was let down by the food.

Don&apos;t get me wrong; there was nothing wrong with the dim sum at Lin Heung Tea House, but the dishes were just as meaty, oily and heavy as those I&apos;d had before. Arriving late one afternoon we were given some of the restaurant&apos;s &apos;special&apos; dishes: shown above at 6 o&apos;clock is fish maw and minced pork wrapped in tofu skin and steamed, at 9 o&apos;clock a type of pig stomach, at 12 o&apos;clock a type of sweet bun called &apos;Malaysian cake&apos;, and at 3 o&apos;clock, pork liver fried in an oily garlic sauce. The volume of meat and oil made the cleansing properties of extremely strong tea a necessity: and effectively marked the end of my search: dim sum is what it is, and I should stop looking for a salad in a steak house.

click on the image Despite having owned the place for five centuries, the Portuguese influence on Macau is actually quite superficial. The Macau of today is essentially a very Chinese city with a few Portuguese-style buildings, a very small minority of people of Portuguese descent, a handful of Portuguese restaurants and an abundance of azulejos (Portuguese blue tiles). Fortunately Macau is rather compact, so for those interested, seeking out the remnants of Portuguese culture, particularly those that are edible, is not difficult. And perhaps the most ubiquitous and tastiest remnant of the Portuguese colonial legacy are pastéis de nata, or more commonly in Macau, Portuguese egg tarts.

Having been denied the gene that grants one the ability to bake, I would never even dream of attempting making them at home, and am thus limited to eating them when I&apos;m in Macau (although there is a decent vendor of the sweet here in Bangkok that I&apos;ll blog about soon). And although they&apos;re available just about everywhere nowadays, I&apos;m partial to Margaret&apos;s: The shop appears to be one of the more popular vendors, particularly among tourists, and I spend a few minutes here virtually every day I&apos;m in Macau. If you&apos;re willing to put up with the mediocre coffee, they do an excellent egg tart (pictured above): flaky, buttery (I&apos;ve read that the original version was made with lard), expertly scorched and not overtly sweet.

click on the image Those wishing to taste the true flavours of old Macau can do no better than stop by Riquexó, a restaurant serving Macanese cuisine, a blend of Portuguese, Chinese, and on occasion, Southeast Asian ingredients and cooking styles.

The restaurant is still run by its original owner, Aida Jesus: who despite being in her mid-90s, continues to look after Riquexó on a daily basis and, on occasion, even contributes dishes herself, such as xarope de figo, a sweet drink made from fig leaves. Besides being one of the few interested in preserving the culinary heritage of Macau, Dona Aida is also apparently one of the only remaining native speakers of Pátua, an old dialect of Portuguese that was previously spoken in the former Portuguese colony.

As the sign (above) suggests, Riquexó is self-service, and in fact is more like a cafeteria. You queue up, point to whatever looks good, and a tray will be brought to you.

Scanning the day’s offerings I immediately ordered capela: I’d read about this traditional Macanese meat loaf, but had never previously tried it. The dish was rich and well seasoned, and the steamed greens were a perfect accompaniment. The cheesy crust and minced olives were signs of the dish’s Portuguese origins, and accompanied by rice and a cold Sagres , it was my favourite part of the meal.

We also ordered a dish of feijoada: the bean stew that is also the unofficial national dish of Brazil, another former Portuguese colony. Riquexó’s feijoada featured a thick broth, the result of using a pig foot, and was supplemented with cubes of pork, carrots and cabbage.

And finally we ordered what is probably the most beloved Macanese dish of all, minchi: Paradoxically, the dish has little resemblance to anything Portuguese or Chinese, and the name is most likely a corruption of the English word “minced”, but according to Célia Jorge, author of À Mesa da Diáspora , a book on Macanese cuisine, minchi single handedly embodies comfort food for people of mixed Portuguese and Chinese heritage. The dish combines minced beef (or pork, or a blend of the two) wok-fried with little more than onions and two types of soy sauce, and is served over rice or cubes of deep-fried potatoes with, on occasion, a fried egg. I’ve made it at home on a couple occasions and was particularly excited to try the ‘real’ version, which to be honest, wasn&apos;t quite as tasty when served at room temperature.

Additional information about Riquexó and Aida Jesus is available in this article , which also has a recipe for capela.

click on the image Despite my previous tirade , I was still willing to subject myself to more dim sum.  This was partly for nostalgic reasons, as I wanted to revisit a dim sum restaurant in Macau that I remembered from a previous visit.

Beginning at the Ruínas de São Paulo and wandering along hilly lanes until we reached the beautiful Jardim de Luís de Camões, I spotted the restaurant and we stepped in. The choices appeared a bit more diverse than those at restaurants I&apos;d encountered in Hong Kong: and actually included some vegetables. Beginning at 1 o&apos;clock and moving clockwise, there was steamed fish balls, deep-fried wontons, eggplant with a fish paste filling, steamed pork-filled buns, firm tofu stuffed with pork, and in the middle, fish head with black beans. Unfortunately it was a bit of a cold morning and most dishes chilled upon arrival, but we kept warm with hot tea: Unfortunately the food was not quite as tasty as I remembered, and as a frustrating but appropriate footnote to my dim sum experience,  I suspect that the red fish balls gave me one of the worst cases of upset stomach I&apos;ve had in years.

Regardless, if you&apos;re willing to risk it, the restaurant is located near the entrance to Jardim de Luís de Camões: View Thai Eats in a larger map

click on the image I was originally drawn to Café Ou Mun, a tiny café in central Macau, for little more than an early morning galão (the Portuguese equivalent of a café au lait) and a pastry. But the quality of the food led me to make a few more visits, including one proper meal.

At first glance, the emphasis at Café Ou Mun is on sweets: And not only do they look great, but they were some of the tastiest desserts I&apos;ve encountered in a long time. My hands-down favourite was the sweet pictured at the top of this post, tijelada. Translated as Portuguese egg pudding, tijelada is a wonderfully eggy and barely-sweet pastry that I later tried to recreate at home with disastrous results (go here for an interesting video, narrated in Portuguese, about making tijeladas the traditional way).

However in addition to sweets, Café Ou Mun also serves a few prepared savoury snacks, including pastéis de bacalhau, the famous Portuguese salt cod croquettes: not to mention an à la carte menu of traditional Portuguese dishes. Stopping by for dinner one night, we started with a salad-like appetizer of octopus: served with olive oil and pickled minced onion. I ordered bacalhau à brás: salt cod (bacalhau) sauteed with shoestring potatoes, onions and egg. Café Ou Mun&apos;s version was a bit gloopy and heavy, but I&apos;ve enjoyed the dish on previous occasions, and while in Macau picked up some bacalhau and plan to make the dish myself, following this recipe . And finally there was porco à Alentejana: the famous dish of cubes of pork marinated in white wine before being braised with clams and served with deep-fried potatoes and parsley.

The main courses perhaps weren&apos;t as impressive as the phenomenal pastries, but Café Ou Mun is a great place for a snack or a simple meal. Wish we had a branch here in Bangkok...

click on the image When I find myself in an unfamiliar province somewhere in Thailand and am in need of something to eat, my first course of action is typically to call Suthon Sukphisit. Khun Suthon writes the Cornucopia column that runs every Sunday in the Bangkok Post and is a wealth of knowledge about regional Thai food and interesting restaurants. In fact, I think Khun Suthon has been so many restaurants around Thailand that he&apos;s beginning to get them mixed up. On a recent trip to Suphanburi, a province about two hours north of Bangkok, I called Khun Suthon to ask if he had any recommendations and without hesitation he replied, &quot;You should go to Paa Muay, it&apos;s in Pang Plaa Maa District, just outside Suphanburi.&quot; I made a mental note and headed off to Bang Plaa Maa, only to find that there was no Paa Muay, but rather the almost identically-named restaurants Phii Muay, Paa Muay (different tone) and Mae Buay. Not wanting to bother Khun Suthon any more, we placed our bets on Mae Buay, grandest of the lot. And although I haven&apos;t yet confirmed it with Khun Suthon, I&apos;m pretty sure we made the right choice.

If you can read Thai, the best thing you can do in provincial restaurants is to order straight from the list of recommended dishes, usually the first page of the menu. Mae Buay&apos;s recommended dishes included mee krob , shown above. Unusually, the dish included egg and was garnished with crispy pork rinds. The slightly sweet noodles were great tamed by the crispy/sour/sweet sides of pickled garlic and Chinese chives.

There was hor mok plaa chon : a &apos;steamed curry&apos;, as David Thompson likes to call it, of snakehead fish. Slightly spicier than most, creamy from coconut milk and revolving around freshwater fish, the dish exemplified central Thai flavours and ingredients.

There was phat chaa plaa maa : a central Thai-style spicy stir-fry using the somewhat coarse freshwater fish that is the district&apos;s namesake. Although oily, I love this dish particularly for its typically generous amount of garlic and green peppercorns, ingredients typically used in an effort to mask &apos;strong&apos; tasting meat or fish.

And finally there was the sour soup, tom som plaa khang : Unlike the more popular sour Thai soup tom yam , tom som is made tart by the addition of dried/salted plum and young ginger. The plum provides the soup&apos;s sourness with a salty undertone, and coupled with the very fresh freshwater fish, the dish was the perfect bookend to a delicious, balanced central Thai meal.

Thanks, Khun Suthon.

click on the image After lunch at Mae Buay , we headed north to Suphanburi&apos;s Sam Chuk Market. The market, which was recently recognised by UNESCO for its efforts in conservation and preservation, is today a popular tourist destination among Thais, despite apparently nearly having died a decade ago. It&apos;s located along the banks of Tha Jeen River, and is comprised of several well-preserved wooden buildings, some of which are over 100 years-old. It&apos;s touristy, but in the Thai sense, which means that the emphasis is on food. You&apos;ll find lots of central Thai-style curries, salted eggs, chili dips, sweets, noodles and old-skool coffee shops.

click on the image I&apos;m currently at work on a piece about obscure ethnic restaurants for the Bangkok pages of CNNGo .  You wouldn&apos;t think that other Southeast Asian cuisines would fit in this category, but for some reason, there are remarkably few here in Bangkok, and New Mabuhay is the only place my friend, a Filipina and nearly 30-year resident of Bangkok, knew of that served Filipino food.

Arriving on a lazy Saturday, we ordered adobo, one of the most famous Filipino dishes: And justifiably so -- this was my first adobo, and I loved the combination of vinegar sourness and black pepper bite. In fact, the dish, with its use of fatty pork and copious shallots, reminded me a lot of Mae Hong Son-style kaeng hang lay .

There was pinakbet: mixed vegetables fried with shrimp paste. This dish reminded me of a kaeng som without the broth and sourness, or even kaeng paa without the soup and spice.

We meant to order sinigang na pusit, which I was told is a soup of squid in its own ink, but due to a communication error (my own fault; I was speaking Thai when I should have just used English), we got a rather bland dish of veggies fried with squid: We also forgot to order sinigang na Bangus (fish with sour broth), and that day the restaurant wasn&apos;t making relyenong bangus (deep fried stuffed fish), but this is just all the more reason to return.

Continuing my research for the piece, on Wednesday I&apos;ll be heading to a Cameroonian restaurant (cheers, Newley !). If anybody has any tips for other obscure cuisines in Bangkok, drop me a comment or an email.

click on the image In my previous post I mentioned that I was on a hunt for obscure ethnic restaurants in Bangkok. Well, after a bit of research, I think it&apos;s safe to say that it doesn&apos;t get much more obscure than my most recent discovery. Amirra is a minuscule, family-run restaurant that serves the food of the African nation of Cameroon.

I was introduced to the restaurant-- in reality more an open dining room -- by Stanley, a Cameroonian football teammate of my buddy Newley . Arriving in the Nana area one recent afternoon, Stanley led us down a narrow alley, up four flights of stairs and past a very domestic living room to a tiny dining room with three tables. We were greeted by the friendly eponymous owner, and Stanley, speaking rapid French, proceeded to order a virtual West African feast. There was haricots: a beef and kidney bean stew traditionally eaten with deep-fried or steamed plantains. He explained that this is one of the more common street dishes in Cameroun and apologized for the fact it isn&apos;t possible to get &quot;real&quot; plantains in Bangkok, claiming that what we were eating were simply bananas.

There was also gumbo: stewed okra with chicken, as well as a bowl of légumes, stewed greens with beef, a dish not unlike the US soul food staple collard greens. In fact, Newley, who is from South Carolina, noticed several similarities between these dishes and traditional food of America&apos;s south. All the vegetable-based dishes were meant to be taken with couscous de Cameroun, a dish not like the Moroccan-style couscous most of us are familiar with, but rather a variant of fufu , the starchy West African staple. Stanley explained that in Cameroon couscous can be made from any available starch, in particular cassava, but here in Bangkok Amirra has to make do with the next best substitute: cornmeal. Everything was accompanied by a deliciously spicy chili sauce called peppée.

Amirra is not the most sophisticated dining experience in Bangkok, and is a bit of a struggle to find, but for hearty eats and mad street cred, there&apos;s no comparison. To get to Amirra from Soi 3, enter the street side street that connects to Soi 3/1, and turn right into the sub-Soi that leads to Masjid Nana. Enter the red door on the right and proceed to the 4th floor.

click on the image Frankly, I wasn&apos;t blown away by my restaurant meals during my recent stay in Auckland. We had some genuinely fun and tasty dinners, but what I&apos;ll continue to remember are the meals based around ingredients that we were able to pick, scavenge and hunt ourselves.

Our hunting and gathering started close to home, at G and G&apos;s beautiful garden just outside Auckland: which had everything from fresh herbs to potatoes: Maytel had the brilliant idea to take some of the abundant Swiss chard (known locally as silverbeet) and combine it with a blue cheese studded béchamel, which Hock topped with crispy breadcrumbs: Twice we were given rabbit, an invasive menace in New Zealand, whose hunting is encouraged: One lot we braised with red wine and served over homemade gnocchi: and with another two I made two vast pots of rabbit and oyster gumbo, easily the tastiest gumbo I&apos;ve ever assembled.

After a few days in Auckland we headed over to nearby Waiheke Island: where within minutes of arriving, we were on our knees looking for pipis, a type of local shellfish: We found none, but instead came upon heaps of deliciously salty cockles, half of which we grilled: accompanied, courtesy of G and G, by a 2000 vintage Moët (it wasn&apos;t all hard work): and the other half Maytel stir-fried Chinese-style.

The next day we took off on G and G&apos;s boat, The Beaver, for some fishing, and returned 12 hours later with this catch of snapper: Hock filleted the entire lot, some of which we gave to the neighbours, some of which I made into a ceviche (following this simple recipe from memory), and the remainder of which he made into some truly memorable fish and chips: Amazingly, it wasn&apos;t until virtually my last day in New Zealand that I set foot in a grocery store.

click on the image Because I&apos;ve lived nearly my entire adult life in Thailand, a place where eating things such as raw blood is relatively commonplace, and because some people mistakenly consider me an authority on such bizarre foods, I&apos;m more than a bit embarrassed to reveal what I&apos;d consider my first exotic meal.

It was almost certainly a meal I ate when I was about 12, just before I made my first trip abroad. I had been invited to have dinner at the home of an ice hockey teammate, an Australian, and was served roast lamb. It was my first time ever eating the meat (I believe this was also the same day when I first tasted Vegemite -- you can imagine the cumulative culinary shock to my system), and I remember wondering beforehand if I&apos;d be able to get it down. Even the dinner table, topped with exotic-sounding condiments such as mint sauce and chutney, a gravy boat, cloth napkins and the family&apos;s special plates, not to mention the family&apos;s somewhat formal table manners, were intimidating and foreign and a world away from my family&apos;s informal and very American concept of dinner.

In the end I had no problem eating the lamb, and even enjoyed the meal, but had largely forgotten about the whole experience until recently, when on my recent trip to New Zealand, I was invited to have roast lamb with my buddy Hock&apos;s family.

We began, naturally, with a leg of lamb: which we seasoned and studded with garlic and rosemary.

Hock made mint sauce according to his grandmother&apos;s recipe: which involved grinding fresh mint, sugar, salt and malt vinegar to a paste in a mortar and pestle.

He also made his grandmother&apos;s fish pie: a delicious mixture of smoked fish, scallops and shrimp held together by a thick roux.

While all this was baking, the kids came by with chocolate slice that they had made: and Grandma Chris topped her famous and delicious eclairs: After nearly two hours in the oven, the lamb was done: the home-grown onions, potatoes and kumara (a type of local sweet potato) roasted: and the fish pie baked: and we sat down to a roast lamb dinner, my second in 20 years: This time around the meal didn&apos;t feel nearly as exotic, and was even somewhat homey and familiar, confirming for me that all these years in Thailand have conditioned me to eat anything, even roast lamb.

click on the image Somehow I&apos;d only consumed one pie, hastily and in the front seat of a car, during my stay in New Zealand, a situation I was determined to remedy. So on my last day in the country Hock did a bit of online research and we headed over to Kingsland to sample what the Internet told us were Auckland&apos;s best pies.

Arriving at The Fridge I followed Hock&apos;s strict instructions and avoided the Thai Red Curry Chicken and Moroccan Lamb pies and instead grabbed a Mince, a Steak and Guinness and something having to do with cheese and potato. The pies were $6, which apparently makes them somewhat spendy by Auckland pie standards.

We stopped at One Tree Hill Park and dug in: The mince was a classic, with a buttery flaky crust and a rich filling that, coupled with liberal squirts of tomato sauce, made a huge mess. The Steak and Guinness boasted a decent but somewhat bland stew-like filling with carrots and potatoes. And the cheese and potato pie was predominately gloopy and heavy.

I&apos;m not qualified to say whether or not these are Auckland&apos;s best pies, but I thoroughly enjoyed the mince in particular, and Hock, a native and pie enthusiast, seemed to agree. And if I&apos;m being totally honest, I even enjoyed the half of the cheese and potato pie, as it ensured that I had absolutely no reason to eat airline food -- even if I wouldn&apos;t eat for another four hours.

click on the image To regular readers, it will come as no surprise that, yet again, I find myself up in Mae Hong Son, northern Thailand. This time I&apos;m only up here for 10 days, and am already doing a fair bit of writing, so I&apos;d prefer to keep my blogging to mostly image-based, marginally food-related posts. A caveat: I&apos;m shooting with my old D100, a single 35mm f/2 and am editing the images on a laptop, so the images won&apos;t be amazing, but to be honest, I find that the 400ISO JPEGs from this camera have an attractive old-school film-like quality.

I came across the guy above just outside Ban Mae Lana, possibly the most attractive rural village anywhere in the country. He made for a nice portrait, but initially I was drawn to his &apos;luggage&apos;: a chicken container carved out of a length of bamboo, complete with a window and airholes! He explained that he takes the rooster into the woods, ties it to something and encourages it to call. This  apparently attracts any &apos;wild chickens&apos; ( kai paa ), which he then shoots. Unfortunately this particular chicken wasn&apos;t yet ready. &quot;He&apos;s still scared of the forest,&quot; explained the man, &quot;He needs to be trained.&quot;

The above is Mae Lana, the Shan village mentioned in my previous post . Mae Lana is located about 50km northeast of Mae Hong Son in a steep picturesque valley and is famous for Tham Mae Lana, a 12km-long cave.

Taking a break from the hectic metropolis that is Mae Hong Son, I decided to drive up to Mae Lana and stayed a night at Garden Home, the village&apos;s only guest house. Waking up early the next morning, I went on a 20km walk that wound through mountain scenery: and the occasional hilltribe village before terminating at Ban Tham Lot, another village near a cave.

click on the image I&apos;ve previously blogged on khao kan jin , rice steamed with blood and bits of meat -- a Shan/Thai Yai dish that&apos;s popular here in Mae Hong Son. After eating at the previously mentioned stall for years, I finally found another vendor, hidden in a side street and located roughly across from the TOT (Telephone Organization of Thailand) office. Drizzled with garlic oil and served with sprigs of cilantro, raw garlic cloves and deep-fried dried chilies, there isn&apos;t much to distinguish the khao kan jin (pictured above) here from my old standby. Both stalls are open at roughly the same time (3-6pm) and both serve khanom jeen nam ngiaw and deep-fried pork rinds. If anything, I&apos;d say that the khao kan jin here is slightly less rich, and the stall also does a variation of the dish that has not been steamed and thus contains raw blood -- the result being a rather intimidating bright pink ball of rice.

Lung Long is mostly retired these days, but will occasionally do work to order, such as the peacocks above that I commissioned.

click on the image Typical Thai Yai house and resident, Mork Jampae, Mae Hong Son Sometimes Mae Hong Son can appear as if it&apos;s stuck in a time warp. A considerable amount of the people here still speak the local dialect, eat the local cuisine and dress traditionally, many even wearing the kup tai (a conical hat). Likewise, most villages here appear to have changed equally little in decades. This is particularly the case with Thai Yai villages such as Mork Jampae, shown above, located about 12km from Mae Hong Son. The vast majority of the houses in Mork Jampae are made from wood and many still feature roofs made from bai tong tueng , a type of local leaf. And as is the case in other Thai Yai villages across the province, the houses are almost always incredibly tidy with a wooden or bamboo fence out front, upon which flowers and/or vegetables are grown. The only obvious concession to modernity is that instead of the tho , a clay vessel of water traditionally situated in front of the house for passers by, most houses now have modern water filters with a tap.

It&apos;s heaps of fun and reminded me of the fact that I seem to bump into some sort of festival or another virtually every time I&apos;m in Mae Hong Son.

I learned heaps and got the chance to use lots of previously unfamiliar lighting equipment, although not always successfully, as illustrated above. But regardless of our success, Joe was an enthusiastic, fun and inspiring teacher: and in addition to two of his excellent books and some cool new Lastolite gear , I took home several techniques and ideas that I hope to use soon. If Joe is ever in your part of the world, I&apos;d highly recommend investing in his workshops. Failing that, do check out his books The Moment It Clicks and The Hot Shoe Diaries , both of which are fun and pretty enough to grace the coffee table, but informative enough for the photo geek.

prohibit dip foot appeareds a pond

prohibit down water uncle in a pond

prohibit sit take a bath on pond edge

I was bathing here one morning (a wonderful experience) and apparently violated the last rule, as a man walked over to tell me that I shouldn&apos;t sit on the elevated edge of the hot spring. According to him, people were complaining it &apos;didn&apos;t look nice&apos; and that the &apos;dirty water&apos; from my body would go back into the hot spring (a vast pond of boiling water, I remind you) and make it unclean. I obliged, but was also reminded of how utterly important appearances are in Thailand, often taking precedence over reality, common sense and proper grammar.

click on the image Last week I found myself in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, attending Joe McNally&apos;s photography workshops . Thus, not only was I in photo geek heaven, but this being KL, I was likewise also in Asian food heaven, and with the guidance of EatingAsia and Jarrett , had a string of virtually faultless meals, ranging in scope from vegetarian southern Indian to porky Chinese.

But the meal that stands out, and which was recommended by both of the above, was Sek Yuen. This longstanding restaurant is unabashedly old-school, and was allegedly a popular destination for wedding receptions in the past: But it isn&apos;t all about appearances here. The kai lan with crispy pork belly: is quite possibly the tastiest Chinese-style flash-fried veggie dish I&apos;ve yet to encounter: smokey (they still cook everything over wood here), crispy/crunchy, meaty and garlicky; the only thing it could possibly use was a bit of chili.

The restaurant&apos;s famous roast duck (virtually every table had an order of this): although not entirely photogenic and slightly dry, was immensely satisfying, the crispy skin holding the subtle flavour of a complex dried spice rub.

There was steamed pork ribs: served with an oyster sauce- and sesame oil-heavy sauce, making the dish somehow seem even meatier than its already meaty appearance.

An attempt to order what in Thailand is known as kuy chai phat tao huu (garlic chives fried with tofu) instead got us gourd fried with egg (Thai-accented Teochew Chinese doesn&apos;t get me as far as I assumed), but communications problems aside, I found the staff here lovely: Lovely enough, in fact, for a re-run. Visiting again the very next evening, I had yusheng : a raw fish &apos;salad&apos; that has apparently become associated with Chinese New Year in Singapore and Malaysia. The dish is only available for two weeks at Sek Yuen, and with disparate ingredients including (but not limited to) ginger, pomelo, sesame oil, cinnamon and jellyfish, was a fascinating combination of virtually every texture and flavour imaginable.

click on the image I often get emails from people en route to Bangkok asking me to recommend the best places in town to eat. I reply to these when I can, but sometimes the volume of mail can get overwhelming, so back in 2006 I put together a blog post to address this problem . I recently stumbled upon the post, which by now is somewhat out of date, and thought it was high time to provide an updated version.

Again, this isn&apos;t a definitive list of Bangkok&apos;s best restaurants, but rather a general guide aimed at first-time visitors trying to make sense of the city&apos;s food offerings.

If you&apos;re fresh off the plane on your first trip to Thailand, I still feel that the best place to dip your toe in the water of Thai food is a mall food court . They&apos;re clean and cheap, the menus are written in English, you have a wide range of choices, and actually, the food can be pretty good. My favorite food court is probably the one on the sixth floor of Mah Boon Krong (also known as MBK ). There you’ll find most of the Thai standards, a huge variety of Thai-Chinese food, and there&apos;s even a stall selling Thai-Muslim food and a good vegetarian stall. The food court in the basement of Siam Paragon is a bit more expensive and mostly Chinese-Thai, but is also a decent and convenient choice. If you&apos;re feeling a bit more adventurous, you could also try one of the slightly more downmarket food centres such as the two huge food halls at the end of Silom Soi 10 that serve the area&apos;s hungry office staff, or Food Plus, the alleyway between Soi 3 and Soi 4 at Siam Square.

At this point you’ve found a dish or two that you like and are likely at least somewhat familiar with the flavours of Thai food. Assuming you&apos;re on vacation, you&apos;ll want to hit up at least one upscale Thai restaurant . Unfortunately I haven&apos;t actually been to many upscale Thai restaurants in the years since I wrote the first version of this post. The only one I&apos;m really familiar with right now is Bo.lan , which despite having eaten there at least five times, I&apos;ve yet to blog about (they&apos;re open for lunch on weekends now, so I&apos;ll get around to it soon). The restaurant is owned and run by two former chefs of David Thompson&apos;s London restaurant Nahm, and their dedication to great ingredients and obscure old-school Thai recipes combine to make it a worthwhile investment. Another alternative, although it&apos;s upscale in the Thai sense, is the delightfully old-school Sorndaeng .

Once you’ve downed a few plates of food court nosh and have consumed the requisite nice Thai meal, I reckon you’re ready for the next step in Thai dining: a good food neighborhood . In my opinion, this is the highest level of Thai dining, and a good food &apos;hood will have mix of good stalls, specialist shops and a good all-around restaurant or two.  The downsides to this are that you&apos;ll need a bit of experience to recognise what&apos;s on offer, and language can be a barrier. If you&apos;re game for a bit of adventure, one of Bangkok&apos;s best is the area around Thanon Tanao : View Thai Eats in a larger map a strip of road teeming with legendary Thai eats, including several specialised vendors including my favourite khanom beuang the excellent Paa Thong Ko Sawoey , and a few good all-around restaurants such as Chote Chitr , Poj Spa Kar , Kim Leng and a couple blocks away, Krua Apsorn .

At this point you&apos;ll have sampled a cross section of Thai cuisine and you&apos;re most likely ready for the final step: Thai street food . These affairs are generally only open at night, are not the cleanest restaurants you’ll ever see, very little English is spoken and are located in inconvenient parts of town. But the food can be outstanding and the experience fun. In this regard, I wholeheartedly endorse Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown : View Thai Eats in a larger map Simply walk down Thanon Yaowarat, avoid the annoying touts at touristy seafood restaurants, and pay attention as you reach the intersection at Soi 6. There you will find virtually every form of Chinese-influenced Thai street food. In this area I particularly like the egg dishes at Nay Mong , the kuaytiaw khua kai vendor and Nay Uan&apos;s kuay jap .

click on the image Located near Bangkok&apos;s historic Nang Loeng Market is a narrow alley where you&apos;ll find two slightly different dishes, united in their use of the same name, a crispy shell and a predominately sweet flavour: The first vendor, Ya Sam, makes the rarer form of khanom beuang (pictured at the top of this post), a crispy egg- and flour-based omelet filled with bean sprouts, tofu, coriander and a savoury/spicy mixture of coconut meat, shrimp, black pepper and coriander root. The dish is served with a sweet/sour dipping sauce that combines sliced cucumbers, chili, ginger and shallots. Frankly, I find this type of khanom beuang a bit too sweet, but this is a personal preference, and in fact think these flavours are probably representative of authentic old-school Bangkok-style food.

Virtually across from this stall there&apos;s also a vendor of the more ubiquitous form of khanom beuang: Lung Noy still makes these crispy taco-like snacks the traditional way, with a bean-based batter and two fillings, sweet, which combines dried fruit and sweet duck egg yolk strands, and savoury, which has a spicy shrimp mixture similar to the one mentioned above.

An ideal one-stop meal destination for those who appreciate linguistic redundancy, sweet flavours and a bit of crunch.

click on the image Northern-style Chinese food is relatively hard to find here in Bangkok. This shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise, as most Chinese-Thais trace their roots back to southern China, and anyway, heavy wheat-based food isn&apos;t generally the first thing people reach for when they&apos;re sweating from every pore. So stumbling upon Khrua Paking (Beijing Kitchen) while actually in search of another restaurant, was a spot of good luck.

The restaurant appears relatively new, is a literal hole-in-the-wall, located in a neighbourhood I imagine only Chulalongkorn University students are familiar with, and serves most of the northern-style standards. The dish above, which was recommended, combined tasty hand-pulled noodles with a minced pork topping and slices of cucumber. The pork topping had an intensely meaty flavour and an almost dried texture.

The restaurant also pushed their flash-fried greens: which, seasoned with garlic, a pinch of salt and a few drops of soy sauce, and just barely cooked, were very Chinese and very good. It&apos;s funny how such a simple dish can be so hard to find in Bangkok (the Thai equivalent uses different greens and seasonings and a lot more oil).

I&apos;m usually not a fan of Chinese-style soups that combine egg, corn starch and vinegar, but the restaurant&apos;s Sichuan soup: was actually pretty good.

There was a salad of Sichuan-style preserved greens: which was a bit heavy on the sliced leeks, but crunchy and satisfying.

And fried dumplings: although to be honest I thought I was ordering something similar to the stuffed breads described in this post . These were good, if a bit greasy, and like all the dishes here, were fully flavoured, made and served with confidence, and exceptionally cheap. Khrua Paking is definitely worth checking out if you&apos;re looking for something a bit different. And yes, it&apos;s air-conditioned.

click on the image After more than a decade in Bangkok, I’m still stumbling upon new entirely new dishes and places to eat. My latest discovery is an obscure intersection near Bangkok’s Chinatown that is home to several restaurants serving kuaytiaw khua kai , a fried noodle dish that’s also a relatively recent discovery of mine. The dish, which consists of wide rice noodles fried with chicken breast and pickled squid and served over lettuce, I first encountered at this alleyway vendor in Chinatown . He has been my go-to guy for the dish, and I don’t believe I’ve tried it anywhere else.

Until now.

For some reason, the Phlapphlachai intersection is home to at least five restaurants and street stalls serving kuaytiaw khua kai. Visiting the area over the course of two nights, I did three of these restaurants.

Located right at the intersection, Nong Stamp: Does the standard kuaytiaw khua khai as described above, but we opted for the slightly unusual seafood version of the dish (pictured at the top of this post), which includes fresh shrimp and squid. Smokey and crispy, it was a very good interpretation of the dish, although I found it a bit under seasoned, and missed the combination of chicken and egg. (Nong Stamp also has an interesting menu of other non-kuaytiaw khua kai dishes, so you can expect to hear more from me about this restaurant in the near future.)

Just up the road, Nong Ann: does several versions of the dish, and very little else, other than tasty fruit shakes (try the watermelon). We opted for the traditional, chicken with pickled squid: Although good by most standards, particularly in terms of seasoning, it wasn’t as satisfying as Stamp’s, lacking the smokiness and slight crispiness I associate with kuaytiaw khua kai.

Located in an alleyway behind Nong Ann, Nay Hong immediately won me over its huge crowds: ridiculously old-school and photogenic setting: and crusty old cook: who cooks the dish, over coals, almost pancake style, allowing the messy mixture of chicken, eggs and noodles to crisp on one side before flipping the whole lot over en masse . This provides the dish with a crispy texture and lots of tasty singed bits: Smokey and well seasoned, and it’s the perfect kuaytiaw khua kai.

click on the image Recently Global Post Thailand Correspondent Patrick Winn and I got the chance to visit the headquarters of the Lao Brewery Company (LBC), the brewers of Beerlao. For those not familiar with the brew, Beerlao is figuratively and literally the beer in Laos, commanding a staggering 99% market share. It&apos;s often also generally considered the best beer in Southeast Asia; a lot like saying Chateau de Loei is the best winery in Thailand, although I must say that the brand&apos;s Beerlao Dark is an unusual lager and a tasty beer by any standards.

The LBC brewery is located 12km from Vientiane at Tha Duea, and on weekdays from 10am onwards offers free brewery tours and tastings. So following a brief circuit of the brewery, and not long after breakfast, Patrick and I found ourselves conducting the following &apos;research&apos;: Much of the rest of the day is a blur, so here follow some random facts about Beerlao and the Lao Brewery Company (LBC):

-The Lao Brewery Company dates back to 1973 and was originally a joint effort between French businessmen and the Lao government Inside the Lao Brewery Company, Vientiane, Laos -After &apos;liberation&apos; in 1975, the Lao Brewery Company was taken over by the government, which today retains half (the other half is owned by Denmark&apos;s Carlsberg) At the Lao Brewery Company outside Vientiane, Laos -In 2008 the Lao Brewery Company produced 210 million litres of beer in its two breweries in Vientiane and Pakse Inside the Lao Brewery Company, Vientiane, Laos -Beerlao is presently available in 10 countries around the world (although paradoxically it&apos;s still relatively hard to find in Thailand) Inside the Lao Brewery Company, Vientiane, Laos -Beerlao&apos;s current brewmaster, Sivilay Lasachack, studied brewing in the then Czech Republic Glasses of Beerlao at a restaurant in Vientiane, Laos -Of the malt used to produce Beerlao, 70% is barley from Belgium and the remaining 30% is rice from Laos At the Lao Brewery Company, located outside Vientiane, Laos -In 2009 the Lao Brewery Company introduced Beerlao Gold (pictured at the top of this post), using &apos;sapphire aroma hops&apos; from Germany

click on the image After two weeks in Vientiane I have to admit that I’ve found relatively little in the way of Lao food worth sharing. I’ve encountered one exceptionally good Lao restaurant, a decent phở&apos; stall and a pretty solid night market, all of which I’ll blog about soon, but for the most part I get the impression that the vast majority of people here appear eat dinner at home, and when eating out, require little more a bit of grilled meat and Beerlao. This is unfortunate for visitors, as Lao food really can be good, but I imagine that much of what people manage to eat here is either gentrified for foreigners, or as is more often the case, just kinda crappy.

In voicing my thoughts to some local foodies, I was pointed in the direction of a laap restaurant near Vientiane’s northern bus terminal. I cycled out there this morning and amazingly found the place, which even more amazingly, considering that today was Lao Women’s Day (congratulations, Lao women), was open.

The proprietors of Han Khay Laap T2 (disappointingly, a reference to the name of the road the restaurant&apos;s located on, not the Hollywood film ) are friendly and even appear to speak a bit of English. The place specialises in beef dishes, in particular laap, which is prepared raw, par-boiled (shown at the top of this post) or fried, but also do a few other dishes including foe (Lao-style phở&apos; ) , grilled beef (tongue, heart and teats), tom kheuang nai ngua (a thick broth with beef innards), koy paa (similar to laap, but made with big chunks of freshwater fish) and kaeng som paa , a tom yam-like soup with fish from the Mekong: The laap was an excellent example of the Lao-school of the dish – tart, meaty, crunchy (from roasted and ground sticky rice) and herbal – and unlike most places, the obligatory veggies that accompany it weren’t wilted and even appear to have been washed. The restaurant also succeeded, somewhat, in alleviating my pessimism about finding good Lao food here, and made me realise that I just have to ask the right people.

click on the image Not from me of course, but from Phia Sing, a former royal cook in the palace of Luang Prabang. The 115 recipes, originally written on notebook paper by Phia Sing, and later compiled and edited by former British diplomat, Alan Davidson , comprise what must be the most fascinating cook book I&apos;ve ever encountered. Fascinating not only for the scope of obscure and delicious-sounding recipes (many of which were palace recipes and involve intriguing ingredients such as freshwater stingray, fish egg membrane and deer), but also for the vibrant and entertaining writing (Davidson also wrote the Oxford Companion to Food ), Davidson&apos;s interesting background on Lao food culture and ingredients, not to mention the context in which the recipes were obtained (Davidson was ambassador to Laos from 1973-75 and explains that he was probably the last Westerner to meet with the final king of Laos, King Sisavang Vong, who personally lent him Phia Sing&apos;s hand-written recipes).

Lending the book a fairy-tale air is the fact that it was allegedly Phia Sing&apos;s dying wish that his recipes be published. This mood is also evident in the endearingly anachronistic way Phia Sing describes measurements, examples of which include minced pork &apos;the size of a hen’s egg&apos; and fish &apos;the size of a man’s hand&apos;. Some of Phia Sing&apos;s recipes can be seen online here . I&apos;m particularly keen to try the jaew bong (a chili paste associated with Luang Prabang) and the khoua sin fahn , a seemingly rendang -like dish of deer braised in coconut and a curry paste.

Highly recommended. If you&apos;re not in Laos, the book can be purchased here .

click on the image Phở, Vietnamese-style rice noodle soup, is probably the most popular noodle dish in Laos, but a few things set it apart from the dish of its origins. Firstly, the noodles used in Lao phở generally aren&apos;t very high quality, and tend to be somewhat coarse and pasty. And Lao phở broth often lacks the deep meatiness of its Vietnamese counterpart (I suspect they attempt to remedy this by adding heaps of MSG). But I reckon the thing that makes Lao phở most different than the Vietnamese style is the number of condiments: Which, contrary to the other differences, is not necessarily a bad thing. Eating phở in Laos you really get the chance to customise your bowl with a seemingly endless variety of bottled condiments, and I love getting a stack of fresh herbs, not necessarily even to put in my phở, but simply to munch on.

Thus, unless you&apos;re a phở purist, you&apos;ll most likely enjoy Phở Dung, probably the most popular phở restaurant in central Vientiane. The noodles are OK, as is the broth (the meat slightly less so), but the condiments, which include heaps of fresh herbs and veggies, fish sauce, soy sauce, pickled eggplants, a slightly sweet peanut-like sauce, chili sauce, sugar, MSG, and more, just about make up for its other faults.

click on the image Driving along Rte 13 about 25km north of Vang Vieng, I passed by this roadside market, bordered by a stream and shaded by tall limestone cliffs: I learned later that the area is known as Pha Hom, &apos;Fragrant Cliff&apos;, but ironically there was a foul smell when I passed through and I continued without stopping.

On the way back, a fluffy silver tail caught my eye and I stopped to investigate. A closer look revealed that Pha Hom was clearly the home of a market specialising in ahaan paa , &apos;jungle food&apos;. There were at least 20 stalls, and in addition to the large mammals, most of which I couldn&apos;t identify, and the organs and bones thereof, there were birds (both dead and alive), crabs, insects, frogs and snakes.

The vendors clearly didn&apos;t want photos taken: But I played stupid and continued to snap away until a middle-aged woman told me to stop. Our conversation (me speaking Thai, her Lao) went like this: No pictures!
Why not?
Some foreigners took a video, put it online and we got in trouble for selling jungle animals.
What&apos;s wrong with selling jungle animals?
Well, if we sell them, they&apos;ll all disappear.
Then why do you keep selling them?
We need to earn money. This conversation took place less than 30km from one of Laos&apos;s largest tourist destinations, which also happens to be both a fertile valley and a busy travel crossroads; I&apos;m pretty sure there&apos;s other work to be done, but maybe there&apos;s not, and anyway, who am I to tell her what&apos;s right and wrong?

But this wasn&apos;t all. The very drive to Pha Hom had taken me through landscapes like this: and this: I&apos;d been through this area in July 2008 and the contrast of the sharp gray limestone mountains, occasional stands of dark forest and emerald green fields made it one of the prettiest places I&apos;d seen in Southeast Asia. Now, at the height of the dry season, the farmers were burning their fields to prepare them for planting, and the hillsides were either deforested or black, huge fires burned, seemingly uncontrolled, at the roadside, and one could barely see the mountains in the distance due to the smoke. I imagined that the countryside probably didn&apos;t look much different than when it was carpet-bombed by the Americans in the &apos;60s and &apos;70s.

Obviously people in Laos need to eat, but it&apos;s depressing to witness the direct and savage impact this need has. At about 5 million people, the population of Laos is relatively small, yet the Lao seem to have an inversely large impact on their environment. This is surely helped by the fact that Laos&apos;s neighbours are virtually free to pluck what they need from the country, whether it be logs, animals or hydropower (at present more than 30 hydropower projects were either being built or were in the advanced stages of planning in Laos, eight of which would dam the Mekong mainstream). If things continue this way, the Lao will certainly get their meal, but stand perilously close to losing their country.

click on the image Sam Euay Nong (&apos;Three Sisters&apos;) is a cheery, tidy family-run place in central Vientiane. They do a handful of simple Lao/Vietnamese dishes, ranging from tam mak hung , Lao-style papaya salad, to khao poon nam jaew , thin rice noodles in broth with pork and bamboo, all of which are full of flavour and well executed, but my favourite dish of theirs is probably naem khao .

The dish, shown above, is an unusual combination of deep-fried balls of rice and sour pork skin/meat, the former shown at the bottom of the pic below, and the latter, wrapped in banana leaf, at the top: The rice and pork are mashed together with seasonings including fish sauce, lime juice, MSG, sugar and peanuts, and served with a platter of greens and herbs. The greens are very Lao, and include butter lettuce (very popular here) cilantro, an unidentified sour leaf, banana flower and phak hom laap , an herb that, to my mind, combines the flavours of both mint and Thai basil. Wrapping the rice mixture in a lettuce leaf along with the herbs and a bit of chili, you get a bit of everything: meat, crunch, spice, salt and greens. Brilliant.

click on the image I&apos;ve been in Vientiane, Laos for the better part of a month now and during this time, my breakfast has hardly diverged from two places. Most days I&apos;ll head for Le Banneton, a French bakery in the centre of town. Usually I&apos;ll eat in and order their excellent cafe latte (brewed with Lao beans) and a sweet-ish pastry, such as kouign amann : But sometimes I&apos;ll buy some of their bread, usually still warm from the oven, and eat it at home with the good salted butter and apricot jam I picked up (illustrated at the top of this post). Highly recommended; I wish we had a bakery half this good in Bangkok.

A few vendors set up there in front of an old movie theatre selling breakfasty things such as rice porridge, khao piak (thick rice/tapioca flour noodles served in a slightly thick broth), phở and coffee. I usually go for the bánh cuốn ( ban kuan in Lao): freshly-steamed noodles filled with a pork mixture and served with Vietnamese pork sausage and a sweet/sour dipping sauce. They&apos;re tasty, although not nearly as nice as those I&apos;ve had in Hanoi , and make a yet another great breakfast I wish we had in Thailand...

Around the corner, a popular vendor also does decent khao piak , Very porky, and served with hearty cubes of blood -- but arrive early, otherwise the noodles tend to disintegrate.

click on the image Talat laeng , evening markets, are, outside of eating at somebody&apos;s home, the best place in Laos to find authentic food. The only downside is that, unless you live there, you&apos;ll likely need plates, silverware and a place to eat. But if you can manage this, the below are a couple of the better talat laeng in Vientiane.

The That Luang Market (pictured at the top of this post), located a stone&apos;s toss from the eponymous religious structure, seems to specialise in grilled foods: But you can get most other Lao standards there, including tam (pounded salads): and various curries and stir-fries: There are even a few vendors you can sit down to: although the choices are pretty limited, and include a couple noodle dishes, more grilled meat and naem khao .

My favourite of the city&apos;s evening markets is the one in the Ban Anou neigbourhood: It&apos;s a bit larger, and sells a wider variety of Lao food. In addition to the ubiquitous grilled meats: you&apos;ll also find a few more specific/regional vendors, such as this stall that specialises in sausages and dips normally associated with Luang Prabang: and another stall that has a huge variety of jaew , chili-based dips: The jaew in the foreground and to the right is the somewhat unusual jaew het , a dip of (grilled, I think?) mushrooms. This woman&apos;s jaew are pretty good, and she also has a huge mound of par-boiled veggies to dip them in.

Several vendors sell soups, curries and stir-fries: and most of whom sell kaeng nor mai , the dish in the foreground, a thick stew of bamboo, vegetables and fresh herbs that&apos;s a Lao staple.

And of course, this being Laos, there&apos;s tam mak hung : Vientiane&apos;s Evening Markets

click on the image Am back home in Bangkok, for a few days anyway, and one of the places I wanted to eat at and blog about was a restaurant I came upon only relatively recently. Tang Jua Lee is a longstanding restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, but since undergoing a relatively recent a face-lift, has something of a modern feel: The restaurant&apos;s specialty is hotpots, which come in a few different forms. The tastiest is probably a hotpot of deep-fried fish head meat (tastes much better than it sounds) served in a broth seasoned with dried plum and thin slices of ginger (illustrated at the top of this post). The dried plum ( buay in Thai) provides a pleasantly salty tartness that is quite unlike tamarind or lime, the normal souring elements in Thai-style sour soups.

They also do a suki-yaki-type hot pot, where you&apos;re provided with a simple broth loaded with a few basic ingredients: which you supplement with raw ingredients (fish, meat, tofu, veggies, etc.): I&apos;ve eaten here three times now and have sampled Tan Jua Lee&apos;s non-hot pot dishes, and can confirm that it&apos;s the type of place where just about everything is solid. Most recently, in addition to hot pot, we had a dish of Chinese-style pickled veggies: and a stir-fry of goat meat: The latter was of the few dishes I&apos;ve ever encountered in Thailand that used fermented black beans . It was very good, although I&apos;d say that they went a bit overboard with the kheun chai , Chinese celery.

On previous visits I have tried their tasty flash-fried greens: made Chinese style, with few bells and whistles but with lots of smokey flavour, and their excellent or suan , oyster omelet: which is rich and garlicky, without being gloopy or overly-eggy.

click on the image Am back in Vientiane after an all-too-brief visit to Bangkok followed by a week in the central Lao province of Savannakhet. And what a week it&apos;s been... My job at the moment is essentially to walk around towns in Laos and gather information, a task that&apos;s been made increasingly difficult by the arrival of summer here in Southeast Asia. Although I&apos;ve lived in the region for over a decade now, I&apos;ve only spent a couple summers here, typically having spent this time of year at home in Oregon or Sweden, or somewhere else cool. As a result, the intense heat feels relatively new to me, and is almost unbearable, particularly for one who&apos;s walking as much as 10km or more a day. I honestly don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever sweated so much in my life, but rehydrating in Savannkhet was a literal pleasure, thanks to Centella asiastica : a green herb known in English as Asiatic pennywort and in Laos (and incidentally, Mae Hong Son) as phak nork (it&apos;s called bai bua bok , &apos;land lotus&apos;, in most of Thailand). The herb is used as a side dish, salad ingredient and juice component from Sri Lanka to China, but I never really took to the latter form, particularly in Thailand, finding its herbal flavour a bit too intense. But in central Laos, as I&apos;ve also seen done in Vietnam, it&apos;s prepared slightly differently. Here, a couple fistfuls of the herb are tossed in a blender with the juice and meat of a young coconut (and the inevitable and inevitably large ladleful of syrup). This is blended for a good minute or two and the resulting frothly green pulp is strained into a tall glass of ice. The result has substantially less herbal flavour than the Thai version, but rather is green and grasslike in flavour, with a slight hint of bitterness. It&apos;s incredibly refreshing -- I think I had three glasses one particularly hot day.

Another equally refreshing drink found on nearly every street corner in Savannakhet is sugarcane juice: Branch-like sugar canes are peeled then passed through the wheels of an electric press several times to extract every last drop of liquid. This is, I suspect, perhaps another Vietnamese influence, as the vast majority of vendors use Vietnamese-made machines, specifically the ones with the funky 1960&apos;s lady one sees everywhere in that country: Served with a squeeze of lime, it&apos;s almost as good as nam phak nork , and isn&apos;t nearly as sweet as one might suspect -- I&apos;m generally not a fan of sweet flavours, but had no problem downing both the glass and pitcher shown above.

click on the image Actually this photo could have been taken just about anywhere in Laos; it illustrates a typical scenario that unfolds upon pulling into any rural bus station here. Even before the bus comes to a complete stop, women frantically run to the bus waving sticks of grilled chicken, bags of sticky rice or mangoes, grilled eggs, buckets of drinks and tubes of nyaa dom (nasal inhalers). I don&apos;t tend to see too many purchases, but the number of vendors suggests it must be at least a somewhat profitable venture.

Didn&apos;t really involve a whole lot of actual cooking, but it certainly was nice not to be eating in a restaurant.

click on the image After more than a month in Vientiane, I have to admit that it&apos;s still the case that I&apos;ve still only been able to find a scant handful of places that do good Lao food. Luckily I live literally around the corner from one that I, not to mention many locals, consider the best place in town.

Nang Kham Bang (&apos;Ms Khambang&apos;), or as the sign says, Khambang Lao Food Restaurant, is a third-generation family run place serving a relatively short but solid menu of Lao dishes. I’ve eaten here at least eight times now, both by myself and with others, and can say with confidence that the kitchen is consistent and service is also good, the latter a true rarity in Laos.

Just about everything here suggests quality, even down to the good-quality and perfectly steamed sticky rice: The house dish is fish (pictured at the top of this post), in the form of a half or whole paa neua on (a type of freshwater fish) lightly seasoned and grilled. Mekong River fish is also featured in kaeng som paa , a sour fish-based tom yam-like soup with lots of dill, bai menglak (a basil-like herb), shallots and galangal: They do an excellent sai ua: a Lao-style sausage, often associated with Luang Prabang, that’s less herbal than its similarly-named Thai counterpart. Other good meat dishes are a sublime grilled beef tongue: very good laap : including an excellent koy plaa (like laap, but made with larger chunks of freshwater fish), and jee sin lot : strips of beef that have been grilled until charred then scraped of all the burnt bits and pounded until tender.

Other dishes worth ordering are or laam , a thick stew-like stew of beef or pork with lots of herbs and vegetables; a very good jaew mak len , a dip of grilled tomatoes; and I reckon their tam maak hung ( som tam -- papaya salad), served here with tiny crispy tomatoes and even tinier freshwater shrimp, is the best version of the dish I&apos;ve encountered yet in Laos.

click on the image If you spend enough time on Rte 8, the Lao highway corridor linking Thailand and Vietnam,  you’re bound to encounter huge lorries bound for Vietnam carrying cages filled with hundreds of dogs.

According to this fascinating four-part investigative report and video by journalists Patrick Winn and Pailin Wedel, the trade in dogs as meat in Southeast Asia actually begins in northeastern Thailand, where stray dogs are caught on a daily basis by what many consider a local mafia. Most Thais don&apos;t eat dog meat themselves, but many contribute to the trade anyway, seeing it as a way to do away with pests and alerting dog catchers of stray dogs in exchange for plastic buckets or cash. The trade is technically illegal, but local police choose to look the other way, claiming that enforcing the drug trade or illegal immigration is a better use of their resources.

The caught dogs are eventually brought to Tha Rae, a town on the banks of the Mekong River in Nakhon Phanom, where they are temporarily held in pens, graded by quality, before being packed into wire cages and loaded onto a truck. A typical truck can hold as many as 1000 dogs, with five or more dogs crammed into each cage: The trucks then cross the Mekong on a barge, beginning a journey across Laos, via Rte 8, that can take up to a couple days. The dogs aren’t fed or given water during the trip, and some die along the way. I encountered one of these trucks (pictured at the top of this post) three times along Rte 8 one unlucky day, and the smell of dog fur and excrement coupled with the endless sound of howling and fighting was truly heartbreaking. A Lao man we spoke to near the border with Vietnam claimed that the trucks pass every single day. “Some days I see four trucks,” he added, causing me wonder how there are even enough stray dogs to supply this demand. Arriving in Vietnam, the dogs can be worth as much ten times the price for which they were obtained in Thailand, making the trade highly lucrative. Winn and Wedel estimate that this particular cross-border trade in dog meat could be worth as much as US$3.6 million a year.

click on the image More and more communities in rural Laos are opening up their doors to foreign visitors in the form of homestays. Ban Hat Khai, a village located at the edge of Phu Khao Khuai National Protected Area , in central Laos, is an example of this. I spent a night with a family there a week or so ago, and in addition to meeting some very nice people and gaining an insight into rural Lao life, I also got to witness some Lao food made firsthand. The resulting three dishes comprised one of the better meals I had in Laos.

The first recipe I witnessed is essentially a &apos;dip&apos; of grilled tomatoes that is as simple as it is delicious, and is also very Lao. The second two dishes took full advantage of two live ducks picked up at the market.  On previous visits to Laos I hadn&apos;t really noticed how fond the Lao are of duck, but on this trip I seemed to see it everywhere, particularly grilled, which other than Bali, where I think it&apos;s technically roasted, is something haven&apos;t really encountered elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Jaew Mak Len Tomatoes, 4
Medium-sized chilies, 5
Shallots, 5
Garlic, 2 small heads
Salt, to taste
Fish sauce, to taste
Cilantro, green onion, chopped

Skewer the tomatoes and grill over a coals until the exterior is slightly charred and the inside is tender. Toss the chilies, shallots and garlic directly into the coals. When slightly burnt on the outside and soft inside, remove from coals, and along with the tomato, peel off all the burnt bits. In a mortar and pestle, pound grilled ingredients together into a rough paste/dip and season to taste with salt and fish sauce (and MSG, if desired). Garnish with chopped cilantro and green onion and serve with sticky rice and par-boiled vegetables such as green beans or cabbage. Tom Pet and Laap Pet Ducks, 2
Ginger, peeled and sliced, one 5cm section
Galingale, peeled and sliced, one 5cm section
Shallots, peeled, 6
Chillies, red, 3
Lemongrass, bruised, 2 stalks
MSG, to taste
Fish sauce, to taste
Small sour tomatoes, halved, 10
Young tamarind leaves

Cilantro, one small bunch, chopped Phak hom laap (a local herb; substitute with mint), equal to amount of cilantro, chopped
Green onions, 4 stalks, chopped
Shallots, 4, sliced Khao khua (ground roast sticky rice), about 2 Tbsp
Fish sauce, to taste
MSG, to taste
Lime juice, to taste

Kill ducks. Remove innards and feathers. Joint ducks, separating the bones from the meat. Skewer the meat bits and grill over coals until fully cooked.

For the tom pet, a duck broth, while meat is grilling, bring a large pot of water, enough to accommodate the bones from both ducks, to a boil. Add ginger, galingale, shallots, chilies and lemongrass. Bring to the boil and allow to simmer for about 20 minutes. Season to taste with MSG and fish sauce, add tomatoes and young tamarind leaves. The resulting broth should be equal parts meaty and tart.

For the laap, when the meat is grilled, chop finely and mix with the chopped herbs. Add sliced shallots, khao khua, fish sauce, MSG and lime juice to taste. Serve with a platter of additional fresh herbs (more cilantro, a few sprigs of dill, mint) and sticky rice.

click on the image It wasn&apos;t all sticky rice and grilled meat for the last couple months. Setting out on a road trip to central Laos with my trusty driver Christophe (above, on the left), I picked up a grab bag of French goodies at Les Boutiques Scoubidou, Vientiane&apos;s best French deli: There was raw milk camembert, saucissson and liver pate. Both loaves of bread were from Le Banneton , Vientiane&apos;s best bakery. And because I was with Christophe, who is Lao but who spent most of his life in France, lots of pastis. All of this was enjoyed in a bamboo hut at the edge of the Nam Lik: The other gentlemen controls the cross-river ferry here, and in his youth was a revolutionary fighter, having fired his gun at American planes in Vieng Xai in the late 1960s. He ate more camembert than I expected.

In addition to being a fan of pastis, Christophe is also an excellent driver, speaks fluent French and decent English and knows Laos like the back of his van.

This time it&apos;s kuaytiaw reua (boat noodles), so naturally I headed to the heartland of the dish (and possibly one of the more underrated food cities in Thailand), Ayuthaya.

Inside knowledge from a local led us to Jay Nit, a longstanding &apos;restaurant&apos; on the man-made island that forms Ayuthaya&apos;s old town. To get here you have to walk through Wat Ratayachai, a temple at the edge of the Chao Phraya River, until you reach what looks like a dilapidated wet market at the edge of the river. The place is frankly filthy, but filthy in that reassuring Southeast Asia way that often suggests good eats.

The ladies here claim that the restaurant has been in business for 40 years, although only the last decade has been on solid land: The noodle dishes at Jay Nit, which include yen ta fo , are done at two stations, although I didn&apos;t really understand the division of labour (one pork station and one beef?). Regardless, they&apos;re doing something right. The broth of the pork version was satisfyingly thick, thanks to the addition of blood, but wasn&apos;t actually as rich or as spicy as it appeared. But I was most impressed with the pork (illustrated at the top of this post), which was fatty and tender and served in thick slices not unlike a very good bowl of Japanese-style ramen. And unlike most other places in Ayuthaya, the servings here are rather generous (boat noodles are typically served in tiny bowls that sell for as little as 10 or 15 baht - possibly a legacy of the dishe&apos;s waterbound origins), making it a heartier version of the dish than most of its counterparts.

More boat noodles to follow; in the meantime, another good bowls can be got at Lung Lek .

click on the image Urai, a boat noodle restaurant in Ayuthaya&apos;s Sena District, is part of a government-funded scheme called Thong Fah (&apos;Blue Flag&apos;) that has established exceedingly cheap restaurants, often serving regional dishes, around the country ( Mae Sri Bua in Mae Hong Son is another Thong Fah restaurant I&apos;ve previously blogged about). I think a bowl of noodles here cost 15 baht (less than 50 cents). As illustrated above, the broth at Urai is practically coffee-like, and is almost certainly the darkest and thickest I&apos;ve encountered. Yet despite this, it was somewhat under-seasoned, and really need a few splashes of fish sauce and a generous scoop of dried chili. And in contrast to that of previously-mentioned boat noodle joint Jay Nit , the meat here is nothing special, having been simply flash-boiled. On the other hand, the noodles at Urai are served the traditional way, in tiny bowls: I believe I ate four...

Urai is located in Sena district, about 15km west of Ayuthaya.  It&apos;s the only boat noodle place in town, and is located right at the bus terminal.

click on the image I arrived back home in Bangkok to some pretty bizarre circumstances. While I was in Laos, red-shirted protesters took over a large swathe of central Bangkok, from the central shopping district to the edge of Lumphini Park, directly opposite my apartment. They&apos;ve occupied this space for several weeks now, having barricaded themselves inside an intimidating fence of tires, bamboo poles and barbed wire (for background on the current conflict in Thailand, go here or here ). The conflict has escalated in the last few days, and yesterday there were rumours that the protesters were going to be surrounded by the military and police at 6pm. At about this time I left my house with the intent of taking a few pics and documenting what was going on in my neighbourhood. While wandering around the red shirt camp, I happened to run into ace reporters Newley Purnell and Anasuya Sanyal , and here are some of the things we saw that night.

View over the Silom area, with hotels and skyscrapers in the background and the medieval-looking tire and bamboo fence in the foreground: A closer look at the fence and one of its guards: It&apos;s said that the protesters have soaked the fence in gasoline, and will set it on fire if attacked. Inside the fenced area (no, those rocks aren&apos;t for landscaping): Guarding the fence: While I was in the area I happened to see  Khattiya Sawasdipol, better known as Seh Daeng (Commander Red): a rogue military general and hardline red shirt supporter who has allegedly likened himself to the Mel Gibson character in the film Braveheart: Only moments after these photos were taken, Seh Daeng was shot while being interviewed by New York Times correspondent .

click on the image I live just off of Thanon Silom, which in addition to being the area of Bangkok with arguably the most restaurants and street food, is also directly adjacent to the epicentre of the current conflict . As a result, the streets in this part of town feel particularly empty today: Shops are closed, rubbish isn&apos;t being collected, armed soldiers outnumber civilians, and the contents of my fridge are starting to run low. And what is normally an area with an overabundance of food has now been reduced to one stall, the lone noodle vendor pictured at the top of this post.

Stopping by for a bowl today at lunchtime, I had the following conversation with one of the ladies running the stall: Wow, you&apos;re open today. Aren&apos;t you scared?
Yes it&apos;s scary, but I have to earn money. We haven&apos;t been able to open in five days!
How has it been today? Have you heard any gunshots or explosions?
Yes, but from way over there [points towards Lumphini Park].
You must be selling well since you&apos;re the only place to eat at Sala Daeng. How late will you stay open?
We&apos;re almost sold out now! And indeed she was selling well, with the bulk her customers, not surprisingly, hungry journalists:

click on the image Damage and burning along Rama IV, Bangkok Yesterday was relatively quiet, at least in my area, but this was the scene five minutes&apos; walk away, along Rama IV. The smoke is from burning tires, and was accompanied by explosions (mostly harmless but very large rockets fired by the protesters) virtually every 20 seconds. A surreal and frightening scene.

click on the image As  mentioned previously , yesterday was generally quiet in the Silom area, at least until about 1am. Shortly after falling asleep I was awakened by the sound of several very large explosions and the pop of sniper rifle fire (as opposed the rattle of machine gun or the blasts of shotgun fire the previous nights) very close to my house. Wandering out this morning to survey the damage, it became clear exactly how close the sounds were: the Dusit Thani Hotel, which I can see clearly from my balcony, had been hit by a grenade (see pic above). Guests were apparently herded into the basement in the middle of the night, and as of today, the hotel has closed, its employees helping people evacuate from this area&apos;s now empty streets: The government has set a deadline of 3pm today for everybody to leave the protester&apos;s main camp, which begins at Lumphini Park: and stretches all the way to the shopping district at Rajprasong. It&apos;s 2.30pm as I write this, and the recent death of influential red shirt supporter Seh Daeng , the sound of explosions, mysterious small planes passing overhead and ominously, dark clouds and thunder, contribute to a very dark, tense atmosphere.

Incidentally, if I&apos;ve gained anything from this experience, it&apos;s the knowledge that the seemingly useless internet application Twitter actually has a practical application. In the words of Bloomberg reporter Dan Ten Kate, &apos;It&apos;s like having sources all over town,&apos; and many journalists and observers use it via mobile phone to keep up to date on what&apos;s becoming an ever-expanding conflict. I follow it compulsively from home, and if you also desire minute to minute updates on the situation here I can recommend feeds from Newley Purnell, Patrick Winn, Alastair Leithead, Andrew Marshall, bangkokpundit and Agnes Dherbys.

click on the image The tiny village of Ban Nong Ping (Leetch Lake Village) lies at the eastern edge of Laos&apos;s Khammuan Province near the border with Vietnam. Its 200+ inhabitants are a mixture of lowland Lao and Salang who were ordered to moved here more than a decade ago, and who have yet to experience the joy of electricity (it&apos;s meant to arrive in 2012). The village is the access point for Hin Namno NBCA and some of the more remote stretches of the former Ho Chi Minh Trail, as well as for the amazing Tham Lot Se Bang Fai, which is why we there there. After having explored the cave and stayed with the villagers, we had a bit of free time on our last day and I did some impromptu portraits. The images were taken with my D700, a 80-200mm f/2.8 VR and illuminated with two off-camera strobes, a SB-800 and an SB-900, both activated by the camera&apos;s built-in flash. I didn&apos;t have much time and the flashes were acting naughty, but at the least the images provide a bit of insight into the inhabitants of one of the most remote and poorest villages I&apos;ve ever visited.

click on the image Despite having many of the same culinary resources and origins as neighbouring Thailand, the people of Laos subside on a markedly more basic diet. Considering Laos&apos;s poverty and lack of both infrastructure and large-scale agriculture, this shouldn&apos;t come as much of a surprise. But the monotony of the rural Lao diet can come as a shock if you&apos;ve never encountered it personally. This post describes another blogger&apos;s nine days of very basic meals in a particularly remote corner of northern Laos. I spent six days in the country on my most recent trip, only four of which were spent in the boondocks of central Laos, but I&apos;d say we had a somewhat similar experience.

All of our meals were based around sticky rice. At a couple dinners this staple was accompanied by dishes such as sour soups with frog or fish, grilled chicken, and on one occasion, bamboo shoot soup ( kaeng nor mai ). Otherwise we ate sticky rice with tinned fish and a grilled chili dip, sticky rice with tiny grilled fish or chicken and a grilled chili dip, or instant noodles. None of it (other than the instant noodles) was bad, but it was pretty monotonous, and given the almost blanket absence of vegetables, not entirely nutritious. Yet despite this, I suspect that our meals had significantly more variety and nutrition than those of the people hosting us.

A notable exception to this diet came the day we explored Tham Lot Se Bang Fai, a 6.5km-long cave created by the flow of the Se Bang Fai. While we were busy inside the cave, a few of the villagers of Ban Nong Ping , our host village, had gathered the baby swifts and bats that had fallen to the cave floor or in the water. These were boiled and plucked: and like most of our meals, were grilled: And as if eating scavenged baby birds and bats wasn&apos;t enough, the villagers had a particular way of preparing them that made already questionable (by our standards, at least) food even worse. Basically they charred the bats and birds, grilling them until they were unrecogniseable black shells. I suspect that this makes the bones, wings and skin easier to eat: Luckily for us, the bats and birds were a special treat for the people who&apos;d gathered them, and our meal was the reassuringly monotonous mix of grilled chicken, instant noodles, sticky rice and a grilled chili dip.

click on the image Jay So originally comes from Yasothon, if I remember correctly, and opened her eponymous northeastern Thai restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s Silom area more than a decade ago.  She&apos;s cheeky and boisterous, and eating at her place, with the smell of plaa raa (fermented fish) and the sound of the northeastern Thai dialect being spoken, is probably not unlike eating at restaurant in her home province. I&apos;ve been eating here for years, and despite not having been back in a long while, she still somehow remembered that I like my som tam without sugar.

Jay So&apos;s dishes run the standard Isan (northeastern) repertoire, and with one exception, are solid, but not amazing. Of course she does several types of som tam (papaya salad), including som tam lao : Lao-style som tam, made with fermented fish, salted crab, crispy eggplant and dried chilies. We also ordered som tam khai khem , a Thai-style som tam (ie made bottled fish sauce and including peanuts and dried ship) with salted egg: There&apos;s kai yaang : grilled chicken, which is really just OK, and a not-so-subtle tom saep , a spicy/sour broth of pork bones: But the real reason to eat at Jay So&apos;s is the plaa duk yaang , grilled catfish: It&apos;s not the most photogenic dish in the world, but you&apos;ll have to take my word for it. Before grilling, Jay So stuffs the necks of the fish with a coarse paste of lemongrass, garlic and salt, providing them a delicious herbal flavour. The skin is crispy and lightly seasoned as well, and on a good day, the meat is just a touch dry, like I prefer it.

So although Jay So&apos;s standard menu and occasionally heavy-handed seasoning may fall short of an exceptional Isaan eating experience, it&apos;s a welcoming and chaotically cozy place, and there&apos;s always the catfish.

click on the image I&apos;ve recently had the urge to buy a point-and-shoot digital camera. There are times, particularly when doing food-related pics or schlepping around places doing guidebook research that I&apos;d rather have a camera that I can carry with one hand or simply stuff in my pocket. I&apos;ve also been influenced by this article by Peter Hessler , in which he explains how a small digital camera proved helpful in the writing his excellent new book, Country Driving . In the piece he describes how looking at digital snapshots, sometimes several years after they were taken, helped to remind him of details he&apos;d forgotten and contributed to the quality and accuracy of his writing.

I&apos;ve played around with using my iPhone, but its images (an example of which, taken recently in Melbourne, Australia, is shown above) just don&apos;t cut it. Any recs? Ideally I want something with a fast lens (f/2) and at least some degree of manual control. I was initially drawn to Leica&apos;s digital point-and-shoots, largely because I&apos;ve long wanted to own something with the Leica logo, but they&apos;re expensive and generally don&apos;t get very strong reviews. The Canon PowerShot S90 seems to get high ratings and is affordable. And apparently a particular model of Ricoh has garnered substantial praise from those who do lots of food-related photography.

click on the image Sawang is a decades-old bamee (wheat and egg noodles) joint virtually across the street from Bangkok&apos;s Hualamphong Train Station. It&apos;s easily located by its overabundance of florescent green lighting and the aged and rather grumpy owner who sits in a chair out front. Some aged promotional material inside desribes Sawang as &quot;The most expensive bamee in Thailand.&quot; Yet despite these ominous attributes, it&apos;s now my favourite place in town to eat the dish.

Discovering Sawang -- it was a tip-off from Jarrett -- was well timed. Over the last few months I&apos;ve been in something of a restaurant rut here in Bangkok. I&apos;ve been making the effort to try places new to me, but most of those that I&apos;ve been directed to have been mediocre, or worse. Sawang has the benefit of being both good and close to my home.

Several things about bamee stand out here. The roast pork is fatty and bacon-like and worlds away from the limp, lean, red-painted stuff you find at the vast majority of Bangkok&apos;s bamee restaurants and stalls. The noodles are toothsome and tasty and lack the disturbing whiff of ammonia that lesser restaurants use as a leavening agent. And unlike most bamee places which tend to separate their liquids, the broth at Sawang is essentially the same water used to boil the noodles: thus its cloudy appearance (see pic below). It&apos;s also worth mentioning that they&apos;re fairly liberal with the MSG here; on my first visit a thumb-wide trail of the white crystals ran down the side of my bowl.

The kiaw (wontons) here are simply shrimp encased in a thin dough wrapper: They&apos;re simple and tasty, but I prefer the heartier version at Mankorn Khao , in which the shrimp are surrounded by minced pork that&apos;s been blended with an intense mixture of coriander root, garlic and white pepper. The bowl above was served with generous chunks of fresh crab claw meat, and at 100B (about US$3), is one of the more expensive around.

click on the image First of all, allow me to apologise for not having blogged for such a long time. I had back surgery in early July and since then have been recovering, admittedly with enough time to blog, but unfortunately little in the way of content or desire. I’m more or less mobile now and am ready to jump...er carefully lower myself back into blogging again.

Before white sugar crystals became ubiquitous, Thais generally sweetened their food with sugar made from the sap of the sugar palm or coconut tree. I had a general idea of what was involved with making this type of sugar but had never witnessed it being produced firsthand, so I jumped at the chance when invited to go on a sugar run with Dylan and Bo of Bangkok&apos;s best upscale Thai restaurant, Bo.lan . With the help of a Thai academic, they were able to source a producer of coconut sugar in Samut Songkhram, about two hours from Bangkok. The sugar, which they use in their restaurant (and which can also be purchased there), is produced traditionally and naturally, and isn’t adulterated with white sugar, as is allegedly often the case these days.

The process begins by tapping the young flowering buds of the coconut tree. The woman pictured at the top of this post (who, incidentally, is in her 50s) does this by climbing a tree, armed with a machete and a few long can-like tubes slung over her shoulder: She shaves the tip off a fruiting bud and after the sap begins to flow, hangs the tube below it to collect the liquid. Depending on how much the trees are producing, it can take a few hours to fill the tube, which also contains wood chips that naturally prevent the sap from fermenting. We were offered some of the freshly gathered sap and it was watery  and sweet, and had a slightly musty, yeast-like odour. The sap is gathered twice a day, and if the trees are neglected for too long, the buds will flower instead, eventually resulting in coconuts.

After all the cans are collected (they have more than 100 trees), the sap is filtered through a cloth into large woks positioned above a long stove: A fire is lit, which in a tidy cycle is fueled by sugar palm leaves, and the sap is left to boil for about an hour until its volume has been reduced by approximately two-thirds. The constantly evaporating water carries the yeasty odour of the sap, making the work area smell not unlike a brewery.

After about an hour and a half the once watery sap had stopped foaming and had changed in form to a simmering liquid the consistency and colour of a dark syrup. It was poured into another nearby wok where, using a special tool, it was stirred and eventually whipped for about five minutes: According to Dylan, this process introduces air into the sap, effectively crystallising the sugar and providing it with a pale colour and a slightly gritty paste-like texture.

The sugar is then scraped into small metal bowls or a large metal tin known as a peep (a colloquial Thai name for this type of sugar is nam taan peep , &apos;tin sugar&apos;) where it’s allowed to cool and solidify even more. If kept relatively cool, the sugar will maintain its solid state, otherwise it will gradually melt back into a thick syrup. The final product has an attractive blond colour and a fragrant smell, and is not overwhelmingly sweet, with a savoury and even slightly salty flavour: Both the sugar and excellent Thai food are available at Bo.lan.

click on the image Khao soi , a northern-style curry noodle dish, is quite possibly the Thai dish that I get the most inquiries about. Foreigners in particular seem to love it, and understandably; with khao soi you&apos;ve got meaty, rich, oily spicy, crunchy, soft, salty and sour all in one bowl. Unfortunately, given its northern origins, khao soi is relatively hard to come by in Bangkok, and I suspect that Pantip, the IT mall in central Bangkok, was for a long time one of the handful of places here where the dish was available. People had been mentioning this vendor&apos;s khao soi to me for years, but I&apos;d never investigated until today.

The khao soi is served from a stall at Pantip&apos;s nondescript food court, and despite all the signs indicating otherwise -- pre-cooked noodles, scant and ragged-looking condiments, not to mention the fact that you&apos;re dining in what is probably the most unpleasant shopping centre in Bangkok (your noodles are accompanied by a constant and irritating soundtrack of vendors hissing &apos;DVD sex? DVD sex?&apos;) -- I have to admit that I found the Pantip food court&apos;s khao soi OK. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it certainly isn&apos;t amazing; the broth lacks the dried spice complexity of a solid northern-style bowl of khao soi, and was served with huge chicken thighs, which basically overwhelmed the dish. But it was spicy and even somewhat rich, unlike the bland and gloopy bowls one normally encounters in Bangkok. It&apos;s definitely not worth going out of your way for, but if you find yourself at Pantip, buy a bowl.

Lamyai, about which I was told by my buddy R, is a lunchtime open-air stall that serves khao soi and kuaytiaw muu tun (noodles with braised pork) just off Thanon Lang Suan in central Bangkok: Arriving recently with Andy Ricker, chef/owner of Portland, Oregon&apos;s Pok Pok and accredited khao soi assessor, it was soon clear to us that, for Bangkok at least, this is a khao soi worth seeking out. Served with chicken, pork or beef (the latter of which is pictured above), we both found the broth satisfyingly rich and hearty, although Andy pointed out that it lacks the dried spice complexity of a truly great bowl. Lamyai appears to make for this in volume and good quality noodles and condiments, and I reckon you&apos;d be hard-pressed to find a bowl of khao soi this solid anywhere in central Bangkok.

click on the image Pheng Phochana, a longstanding restaurant in the Suan Luang Market area behind Chulalongkorn University, is quite possibly Bangkok&apos;s most popular destination for kuaytiaw khua kai , rice noodles fried with chicken and egg: This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it&apos;s the best bowl in town, but there are a couple things that make the dish unique here. Firstly, the noodles are positively encouraged to ignite and flame during the frying process: providing the dish with an intensely smokey flavour and scent. But, as my dining companion pointed out, because they&apos;re using palm oil this singeing also provides the dish with an unpleasant, almost petrol-like aftertaste. This is in stark contrast to the vendor at Nay Hong , where the choice of fat (pork fat, in this case), provides the dish with a savoury, meaty depth. And rather than scrambling the eggs with the noodles as is done elsewhere, at Pheng Phochana the eggs are saved for last and are wrapped around the noodles in the form of a thin omelet. Another unusual aspect of the dish is that it&apos;s garnished with tiny pa thong ko , deep-fried bits of dough. This provides the dish with pleasant crunchy element that&apos;s otherwise lacking. And lastly, they do a couple unique spins on the dish including kuaytiaw khua thaleh , a seafood version, and kuaytiaw khua tharo , in which the protein element is Taro , the popular squid-flavoured fish snack.

click on the image Still hot on the Bangkok khao soi trail, I recently decided to go back to a vendor that I&apos;ve long felt does the best khao soi in Bangkok. Lam Duan Fah Ham is the only Bangkok branch of the similarly-named, longstanding Chiang Mai institution. The original restaurant, located in Chiang Mai&apos;s Fah Ham area, serves what&apos;s arguably the best bowl in town, and the people who run it even claim to have &apos;invented&apos; khao soi.

Dubious origin myths aside, the Bangkok branch of Lam Duan Fah Ham maintains the quality of the original, and is arguably the best bowl in Bangkok. The only real fault here is location: the restaurant is located in extreme northern Bangkok, not far from the former airport. Because of this, I hadn&apos;t been back here in at least a year, and upon arriving and receiving my bowl of beef khao soi (pictured above) felt a twinge of disappointment: the broth at Lam Duan Fah Ham can appear deceptively thin, almost watery. But a taste revealed that it&apos;s actually quite rich, with virtually zero bland/sweet coconut milk cloyingness and more dried spice complexity than any other bowl I&apos;ve encountered in Bangkok. The noodles and condiments are of pretty good quality, and the serving size is also authentically northern (i.e. one bowl is never enough, two is more than enough).

Also laudable is the restaurant&apos;s khanom jeen nam ngiaw : Although not quite as meaty and rich as the bowl at Kuaytiaw 12 Panna , the broth here is tart and spicy, with hearty chunks of both pork and tomato.

Lam Duan Fah Ham also serve a few non noodle-based northern Thai dishes.

click on the image This certainly isn&apos;t breaking news at this point, but David Thompson, the Michelin-starred chef of London&apos;s nahm, is opening an outlet here in Bangkok. The restaurant, also set to be called nahm, will be located in the Metropolitan Hotel , and is expected to open near the end of the month.

I&apos;ve been to a couple test run dinners over the last few weeks and on both occasions was thoroughly blown away. The dinner pictured above was probably the best Thai meal I&apos;ve had in years. Some of the more interesting dishes included a lemongrass salad of prawns, squid and pork with toasted coconut, a dish I first encountered with David in Singburi ; cured fish and pork simmered in coconut cream; and pictured front-centre, a wonderfully spicy jungle curry of minced catfish with basil, green peppercorns, shredded white turmeric and grachai. In fact, I&apos;ve been genuinely surprised (and equally delighted) by just how full-flavoured and spicy some of the dishes have been. David&apos;s also been experimenting with some more rustic, full-flavoured dishes such as sai ua , the northern-style grilled sausage, perhaps suggesting something of a departure from the refined Thai cuisine he&apos;s normally associated with.

click on the image I&apos;m often asked about my favourite places to eat in Bangkok. This is a hard question to answer, not necessarily because I have trouble deciding, but rather because I&apos;d say there are very few all-purpose menu-toting restaurants here that I truly enjoy. In my opinion, eating in Bangkok is all about the dishes, not the restaurants. So in no particular order, here are some of my favourite plates and bowls in Bangkok: The oyster omelet at Nay Mong. Whether you order the crispy ( or lua , pictured above) or soft ( or suan ) version, you&apos;re getting a brilliant intersection of seafood and egg; smoky, rich and cooked to perfection. Quite possibly my favourite dish in Bangkok. The kuaytiaw khua kai at Nay Hong : This is a relatively recent discovery, but after five or so visits, the smokey, crispy noodles here have quickly made it onto my list. Khao mok phae , goat biryani, at Naaz : I&apos;m a huge fan of Thai-Muslim food, but this unusual and delicious biryani is probably closer to the dish&apos;s Middle Eastern origins than anything found in Thailand. The khao man kai , Hainanese chicken rice, at Boon Tong Kiat : Fragrant, perfectly cooked rice and impossibly tender steamed chicken combine to form this nearly perfect one-dish meal. Khanom tup tap during the annual vegetarian festival: This peanut based snack is fleetingly available year round in some bakeries in Chinatown, but is at its peak when warm and freshly pounded. Laap plaa duk at Nong Khai : Served with freshwater snails and phak khayaeng , a hard-to-find fresh herb, this &apos;salad&apos; of grilled catfish is equal parts obscure and tasty. The oxtail soup and khao mok plaa , fish biryani, at Yusup : This Thai-Muslim place north of Bangkok is probably the closest thing to my favourite all-around restaurant in Bangkok. Their unusual fish biryani is fragrantly spicy and the oxtail soup is a satisfying combination of tartness and richness. The phat see iw at Nay Lao : Yet another smokey noodle dish, this one benefits from the addition of my favourite veggie and tender marinated pork. Mee krob at Chote Chitr : This restaurant gets heaps of press, not all of it justifiable, but the crispy noodles, aromatic with the addition of som saa , a type of citrus, are always delicious. The yen ta fo a t Coke Chuan Chim : The guy who runs this popular noodle stall is Bangkok&apos;s equivalent of the Soup Nazi , but it&apos;s worth the fuss. The kaeng karee plaa , fish curry, at Roti Mataba : I have to admit that it isn&apos;t probably as good as it used to be, but I still have a soft spot for the hearty tartness of this Thai-Muslim curry.

click on the image Hoy thot , literally &apos;fried oysters&apos;, is one of the more emblematic Thai street hawker dishes. Consisting of mussels (or oysters) fried with egg in a batter of rice and mung bean flours, and served on a bed of soft bean sprouts, its simple, rustic nature lends itself to streets and stalls, and you&apos;ll rarely find the dish in any indoor restaurant.

Hoy Thot Chao Ley, a longstanding vendor of the dish on trendy Thanon Thong Lo, has compromised somewhat on hoy thot&apos;s streetside status. Located in a covered alleyway, the place almost gives the impression of being indoors, but in keeping with the dish&apos;s street origins, the hoy thot here is simple, tasty, crispy and satisfying. Admittedly, the dishes aren&apos;t rich or expertly-prepared as those of Nay Mong , but are better than most you&apos;ll find around town, and are worth checking out.

In addition hoy thot, pictured above, which incidentally they call hoy malaengphu thot krob (&apos;crispy fried mussels&apos;), they also do thaley thot krob (a seafood version that includes shrimp and squid), phat Thai , or suan (a soft oyster omelet) and or lua (crispy oyster omelet).

All of these dishes are prepared on a vast round skillet: and are a lot less oily/greasy than you&apos;d expect.

I&apos;m heading up to Chiang Mai tonight and will be quiet for a few days, but hope to come back with some posts on northern food.

click on the image I studied Thai at Chiang Mai University back in 1998, but moved to Bangkok almost immediately after finishing my studies there. Since then, I&apos;ve spent relatively little time in Chiang Mai, and most of my subsequent visits have been little more than passing through on my way elsewhere. And although I know enough grab a bowl of khao soi at Lam Duan or Shan-style breakfast at Wat Pa Pao, I&apos;m woefully uninformed about the city&apos;s food scene.

Finding myself with some free time, I decided to remedy this and headed up north for a few days. Another reason for the trip was that my buddy, Andy Ricker, also happened to be in Chiang Mai. Andy&apos;s been coming to Chiang Mai since the 1980s, and is intimately familiar with much of the city&apos;s food, much of it having served as inspiration for his Portland, Oregon restaurant, Pok Pok . We spent three days eating together, and the next few blogs will cover a few of the places he took me to in Chiang Mai. Because some of these places were somewhat hard to reach and are pretty local, I include them here more as illustrations and descriptions of authentic northern Thai food, rather than specific restaurant recommendations.

On the day I arrived, Andy took me a few kilometres outside Chiang Mai to Mae Hia Market. He wanted to take me to his favourite vendor of sai ua , northern-style grilled sausage: All sai ua contains ground herbs, but this vendor&apos;s version is known colloquially as sai ua samunphrai , &apos;herbal&apos; sai ua, due to copious amounts of lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf, garlic and galangal he employs. As with other vendors, the sausages here are grilled over coals: but the final result is slightly drier and leaner than your average sai ua, with not surprisingly, a complex and rich herbal flavour.

click on the image On my first night in Chiang Mai Andy took me to Jin Tup, a rustic roadside restaurant a few kilometres outside of the city. Jin Tup turned out to be quite tasty and fun, and is very emblematic of the kind of food northerners (specifically, northern Thai men) like to eat with their booze. But it was obvious upon arriving that this isn&apos;t a restaurant for everybody; although cheery and welcoming, the place is shockingly messy and is also rather hard to locate.

The emphasis here is on grilled meat: which ranges from pork collar to grilled teats, and just about everything in between. The house specialty, which also functions as the name of the restaurant, is jin tup (literally &apos;pounded meat&apos; in the northern dialect), grainy pieces of beef (Andy suspects flank) that are seasoned, semi-dried and grilled before being pounded into thick strips with a metal mallet (illustrated at the top of this post). The smokey strips of meat are then served with two types of nam phrik khaa , a galangal-based dipping sauce. I first encountered a similar dish at Nang Khambang in Vientiane, Laos, but this version is meatier and fattier, and less leather-like.

We also had tom yam kop : the northern version of the famous spicy/sour (and in this case, very salty) Thai soup, served here with frog and a generous amount dried northern spices.

But our favourite dish was naem , fermented pork combined with egg, wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled: An amazing amalgam of two disparate proteins -- bland egg and tart pork -- that works amazingly well.

click on the image Acting on a tip from Amorn of the lovely Riverside Guest House , me and Andy were pointed in the direction of Laap Dee Khom, a longstanding restaurant located within Chiang Mai&apos;s old city walls. We arrived at lunchtime, apparently too late to sample the various northern Thai dishes that are prepared here on a daily basis, but not too late to try the restaurant&apos;s various namesake laap, spicy meat-based &apos;salads.&apos;

If you like Thai food, you&apos;ve most likely encountered laap previously, but the northern version is an entirely different beast altogether. The most popular version, known as laap khom (&apos;bitter laap&apos;) is made from finely-minced raw meat, to which is added a spicy curry paste, a mixture of dried spices, raw bile and blood (to see how the dish is made, go here ). A slightly safer -- and arguably more delicious -- version is laap khua , &quot;fried laap,&quot; in which sliced offal is added to the meat before it&apos;s all fried up in a wok. The predominate flavour in either of these dishes is spicy -- not necessarily a &apos;hot&apos; spicy, but rather a slightly numbing, Sichuan pepper-like burn stemming from the addition of dee plee and makhwaen , two northern Thai spices -- trailed by bitter, a result of the addition of bile.

We were able to sample virtually the entire spectrum of northern-style laap at Laap Dee Khom, and they didn&apos;t disappoint. Starting at 6 o&apos;clock and moving clockwise, there was saa khua , a slightly sweet and soupy laap relative consisting of hearty chunks of beef that had been simmered with a chili paste, a pinch of northern Thai spices and plenty of chopped herbs, in particular, lemongrass; next was a raw northern-style beef laap khom , studded with crunchy Szechuan pepper-like dried spices and pleasantly bitter from the addition of bile; at noon is laap plaa duk , a deceptively unattractive salad of grilled catfish that was simultaneously smokey and spicy; and lastly at 3 o&apos;clock, the classic northern Thai soup of pork ribs simmered with jor phak kaat , a peppery green used in many northern Thai dishes.

Andy and I loved the catfish laap, it being the first time I&apos;ve had this dish prepared in the northern style. We also really enjoyed the flavours of the raw beef laap, but were intimidated by its constituent ingredients, and in the end asked them to fry it up for us. The &apos;dining room&apos; at Laap Dee Khom is a scruffy, unlit nightmare (do you sense a theme here?), but the woman who runs it is very friendly, and assuming you arrive early enough to try a greater variety of dishes, the restaurant is a great place to sample the flavours of authentic northern-style Thai cooking.

click on the image Him Tang is the northern Thai dialect word for roadside, and as a name it accurately sums up the atmosphere of this rustic grilled meat shack in Mae On, about 30km outside of Chiang Mai.

Like Jin Tup , this is a place that revolves around grilled meats: and local booze: in this case yaa dong , rice alcohol supplemented with herbs and typically served with tart drinking snacks.

But back to the meat... We ordered aeb ong muu : pig brains and an herbal curry paste mixture that have been combined and grilled in a banana leaf package. The texture was smooth and the taste meaty and slightly spicy.

They do an excellent sai ua , northern-style grilled sausage: light on the herbs and heavy on the fat, just like I like it.

Perhaps the most unusual dish was grilled pig&apos;s tail: This was my first time eating this dish, and I must say that pig tail may be one of the most perfect grilled foods. As it grills, the exterior becomes crispy -- not unlike pork rinds -- while the meat on the inside is essentially basted in the fat and remains tender and moist. Amazing stuff.

But the best dish of the night was a laap of raw buffalo: This is an unusual dish -- most Thais generally avoid eating buffalo -- and was something of a special, with &apos; mee laap khwaay &apos; (we have buffalo laap) having been scrawled on a piece of cardboard. I&apos;m not a huge fan of the texture of raw meat, but the dish contained a complex and delicious spice mixture with hints of cinnamon and star anise, not to mention the normal northern Thai spices of makhwaen and deeplee , that made up for this. The result was meaty, spicy and also slightly sweet, and was probably one of the more interesting Thai dishes I&apos;ve encountered in a long time.

And speaking of Thompson, the Bangkok branch of his Thai restaurant nahm is now officially open for business. I ate there for the third time last night and yet again, was thoroughly blown away. Standout dishes included the deliciously tart and spicy cured &apos;hiromasa&apos; kingfish salad with chillies, lime and mint; the rich and very spicy smoked fish curry with prawns, chicken liver, cockles and black pepper; a slightly bitter and rather spicy red curry of grilled salted beef with chili leaves; and a deliciously decadent and rich durian and sticky rice. If you&apos;re in Bangkok and are interested in Thai food, it&apos;s a must visit.

click on the image Acting on a tip from another friend of Andy&apos;s, we hit Akha Ama Coffee . The tiny outfit has its office in Chiang Mai, but the beans -- as is the case with most domestic Thai coffees -- come from rural Chiang Rai province. The company uses 100% Arabica beans, claims to promote sustainability and fair trade among the Akha people who maintain the crops, and Lee, the young man we spoke with at the office/cafe, really seemed to know his stuff.

Having consumed their &apos;Strong Roast&apos; at breakfast this morning, I quite liked it, finding it a good balance of bitter and sour, with a decent body. It&apos;s also very inexpensive, at only about 100B (about US$3) for a 250g bag. If it was available in Bangkok I&apos;d probably consider it as an alternative to the more expensive Doi Kham or Doi Tung beans.

click on the image The last place Andy took me to was Phornchai, a longstanding noodle soup restaurant near Chiang Mai&apos;s city centre. This shophouse restaurant serves what is probably the most basic of Thai noodles, kuaytiaw . Pictured above, the bowls consist of a thin, largely bland broth, noodles (rice- or wheat-based), sliced cabbage, a bit of crispy pork fat with garlic, and continuing our meat theme, your choice of beef or pork. The beef balls were pretty tasty, although I found the other cuts slightly tough. They also do a decent khao soi: which appears deceptively bland and thin, but was actually quite hearty and meaty, with subtle hints of dried spice.

click on the image There are heaps of places in Bangkok that claim to serve Vietnamese food, but what most are serving is actually a Thai take on Vietnamese cooking. In theory at least, this isn&apos;t entirely a bad situation; I&apos;ve encountered many interesting Thai/Vietnamese dishes in places such as Nakhon Phanom, Nong Khai and Mukdahan. Where things go wrong is the fact that the vast majority of these restaurants serve virtually the same repertoire of dishes, with very little variation in terms of flavour or preparation. This is a pity, as I really love this type of food: it&apos;s fresh, tasty and healthy. I also find it strange that, given the similarity between Thai and Vietnamese cooking styles and ingredients, it shouldn&apos;t be too difficult to recreate relatively authentic Vietnamese dishes here in Bangkok. But apparently there&apos;s not the demand nor the desire, and what we&apos;re left with is a mediocre facsimile of Vietnamese cooking.

This having been said, Pa Kay, a longstanding restaurant in a former Vietnamese enclave near the Chao Phraya River, is one of the better places I&apos;ve encountered for Thai/Vietnamese food. The menu is largely predictable, but the preparation and flavours were generally above par.

The standout was probably naem nuang (nem nướng in Vietnamese), skewered and grilled pork served with rice paper and a variety of toppings and fillings (seen at 12 o&apos;clock in the image above). The pork here was flavourful and pleasantly charred, and the dipping sauce, which tends to be overly sweet, had a tasty savoury/spicy element, allegedly the result of the addition of minced liver.

The loser was kung phan oy (located at about 7 o&apos;clock in the pic), minced shrimp (and pork?) wrapped around a stalk of peeled sugarcane and grilled. The meat, which appeared to have been grilled several hours previously, was practically unseasoned and the side of pickled vegetables also lacked flavour.

The rest of the dishes were a half-step above their Bangkok counterparts. The khai kata (10 o&apos;clock), eggs served in a tiny wok with Vietnamese- and Chinese-style sausage, was tasty, and came served with tiny French-bread like rolls. And although the khanom pak mor (bánh cuốn; 4 o&apos;clock) weren&apos;t made to order and were somewhat thick-skinned, were decent and came with good quality muu yo (Vietnamese-style sausage).

click on the image Over the last few months, I&apos;ve done several articles for CNNGo&apos;s Bangkok pages on Thai dishes that resident foreigners (and sometime even resident natives) may not familiar with, and a few recommended places to sample them. So far I&apos;ve covered kaeng karii , khao khluk kapi , khanom jeen nam ngiaw , kuytiaw luy suan and kuaytiaw khua kai . At the moment I&apos;m at work on one about kuay jap nam sai , the Chinese/Thai dish that combines pork offal and a peppery broth. Of the six or so restaurants and stalls I&apos;ve investigated for the piece, my favourite was probably Mister Jo. Kuay jap is based around pork offal (heart, tongue, intestines, liver, spleen), but the crispy pork belly is what can make or break a restaurant. Mister Jo&apos;s pork belly is so good that it&apos;s also available separately, served on plates with a soy sauce dipping sauce. The broth is peppery -- as a good kuay jap broth should be -- but not assertively so, and was probably the most balanced of the various places I visited. Unusually, it includes squares of tender pork skin. And unlike most places serving kuay jap, Mister Jo is open during the day. As a result, it&apos;s crazy popular, and you&apos;ll almost certainly have to navigate a lengthy queue of to-go orders simply to step foot inside the restaurant.

Stay tuned to CNNGo Bangkok&apos;s Eat page to see the entire list of kuay jap nam sai stalls and restaurants I found.

click on the image Inspired by a piece in the recent Food issue of Travel + Leisure Southeast Asia , I recently had lunch at a nearby, but previously un-visited restaurant, Lert Ros Alacarte.

I ordered one of their set lunches, which included kaeng karii neua , a Chinese-style curry, a bowl of mild beef soup, and a glass of Coke (all for 125B, less than US$5). The beef in the curry was super tender and almost corned beef-like in texture and appearance, and the curry included a wedge of potato and was served with a spicy/sour dipping sauce. The soup, which turned out -- not surprisingly -- to be beef overload, was nonetheless good, and held a slightly sweet flavour, Chinese-style herbs and spices and tender tongue.

The food was solid, but I must admit that was almost more charmed by the old-school, diner-like atmosphere; think padded booths and lots of old furniture. The menu was equally old school and included dishes such as stewed beef tongue and fried rice with tamarind and shrimp. Am definitely looking forward to more meals at Lert Ros Alacarte.

As an aside, I&apos;ll be doing some travelling in some remote, predominately Internet-free areas for the next month and don&apos;t expect to be blogging. See you again in late October!

click on the image Boy did I miss a big fat plate of good ol&apos; fashioned food controversy when I was away. As mentioned previously , Australian chef David Thompson has opened a branch of his Thai restaurant nahm here in Bangkok. Not surprisingly, when one considers how dearly the Thais regard their cuisine, the opening has inspired a generous serving of heated discussion here in Bangkok. Some of this was spurred on by this piece in the New York Times . The article makes for entertaining reading (sample quote: &quot;&apos;He is slapping the faces of Thai people!&apos; Mr. Suthon said in an interview.&quot;), but is somewhat sensationalistic in tone and Thompson claims to have been quoted out of context. The controversy is also the topic of this BBC piece .

The local media also has its share of nahm/Thompson defenders and detractors. This rather clumsy restaurant review in The Nation seems to have been impressed with the restaurant, while this letter to the editor in the same paper is a dramatic and not entirely coherent damnation of nahm and its chef. The controversy has inspired a rather soul searching editorial in The Bangkok Post , &quot; Which Way Thai Cuisine &quot;, as well as editorials in the Thai-language media, including the influential paper Matichon . But perhaps the epitome of the media attention was this hilarious spoof in Not The Nation : &quot; Army Overthrows David Thompson In Cuisine Coup &quot; (you know you&apos;re in the limelight when you&apos;re being spoofed).

People have the right to voice their opinions about cuisine and authenticity. But I find it disappointing how rather quite racist and xenophobic some of the Thai reaction to nahm has been; how would the Thais react to vaguely racist French criticism of a Thai landing a high-level cheffing job at Pierre Gagnaire ? When it comes down to it, it really depends on the food, and I thought the most resounding sound bite about all this came from a Thai friend, who unlike many of the people writing or talking about the restaurant, has actually eaten there: &quot;All I know is that if Nahm was about a quarter the price it is I&apos;d be a regular. Authentic or not.&quot;

click on the image Am home in Oregon for a couple weeks. I&apos;m particularly excited about this visit as my buddy Hock also happens to be in-state, doing a temporary cheffing stint in Portland, and via his numerous visits to Thailand, I&apos;ve become good friends with Andy, chef/owner of Portland restaurants Pok Pok , Whiskey Soda Lounge and Ping .

One of my first meals in at home was at Podnah&apos;s, a Texas-style barbecue joint in NE Portland where Hock was doing his stage : I grew up in the US, but haven&apos;t really been much of anywhere outside of the west coast, and my understanding of barbecue -- like that of many Americans -- began and ended at backyard-style grilled meats. Southern- and Texas-style barbecue is a different beast altogether, and involves smoking -- not grilling -- meats over a low temperature for several hours. It was this unique technique that Hock came to Oregon learn.

The kind folks at Podnah&apos;s put together a something of a sampler platter spanning their best barbecue (pictured at the top of this post): pork ribs, pulled pork and beef brisket. Apparently the pork ribs are a highlight, but I preferred the slight fattiness of the beef brisket. The pulled pork, served on slices of white bread, was also very good, and like all the meats, had a flavour and texture more in common with smoked than grilled food. The meats were accompanied by some tasty in-house made sauces, ranging from a smokey/spicy chili-based sauce to a tart vinegar-based one that I really enjoyed.

I particularly enjoyed the sides, which included a crunchy potato salad, baked beans, excellent savoury cornbread and possibly my favourite dish of the meal, something called Frito chili pie: a spicy, bean-free chili served over Fritos corn chips and topped with cheese and thin slices of onion.

It was all a bit meat overload for me, but I really enjoyed the meal, particularly the communal serving style, which I thought had much in common with Asian-style dining. Podnah&apos;s Pit Barbecue 1469 NE Prescott St, Portland, OR

click on the image Most likely spurred on by similar success in LA, Portland&apos;s food stall scene has exploded in the last year. Stalls now allegedly number in the upper 500s and several so-called &apos;cart pods&apos; can be found in various Portland neighbourhoods. But despite the buzz, not all carts are buzzing with customers. In fact, I&apos;d say that relatively few appear to draw substantial numbers of diners. One of the lucky ones is Nong&apos;s Khao Man Gai: A native of Bangkok, Nong has been in Portland seven years and among other things, worked a stint at Pok Pok. In 2008 she decided to go into business for herself and less than two years later, her stall is one of the most popular in Portland. As illustrated above, the lines go around the block, and the amount of press this girl has received is pretty amazing: Nong got in relatively early on the food cart trend and was able to score a prime downtown location. The food she&apos;s serving is also very good (I&apos;ll get to that in a minute). And I know that her success is also the result of good old-fashioned hard work. But if you ask me, a substantial portion of her success is a no-brainer: Unlike other carts that try to serve as many items as possible, Nong clung to the central tenet of good Thai street food: serve one tasty dish that you can do really well. Her dish is khao man kai (Hainanese chicken rice), and other than drinks, that&apos;s all you can get at her stall; no pad Thai, no vegetarian green curry, no dessert. And despite the fact that she&apos;s serving a single dish the vast majority of Americans have never even heard of, it&apos;s worked.

After having read about Nong&apos;s Khao Man Gai on websites and blogs for the last year, I was finally able to try a packet firsthand. Ducking into the lobby of a nearby building, I dug in and almost immediately my suspicions were confirmed: I reckon that Nong&apos;s khao man is as good -- or perhaps even better -- than that of your average Thai cart or restaurant. The rice was toothsome and slightly oily (as it should be, yet often isn&apos;t in Thailand) and had the slightest fragrance of galangal and ginger. The chicken was tender and tasty and the dish comes accompanied by an exceptionally rich and fragrant broth -- the delicious by-product of boiling those chickens. And perhaps most importantly, Nong&apos;s nam jim (dipping sauce) is pretty much spot on: tasty and moreish, sour, spicy and salty, but with a slight emphasis on the sweet.

click on the image It was back in 2007, via this New York Times piece about dining in Portland, Oregon, that I first heard about Pok Pok. Only about two years old at that time, the restaurant had gone from a house-bound takeout stall selling a limited repertoire of dishes to one of the most talked-about restaurants in Oregon. Upon reading the piece, I immediately wrote an email to chef/owner Andy Ricker, who to my surprise, was already aware of this blog.

Since then, and via his numerous visits to Thailand, Andy and I become friends and have eaten and even cooked together many times. But I haven&apos;t been home to Oregon in several years and had never eaten at Pok Pok until now.

My first visit to the restaurant was during the day and my four dining companions and I ordered a decent chunk of the lunch menu. There was (pictured above, from left to right) Ike&apos;s Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, a moreish combination of salty, sweet, sour and meaty that is by far the restaurant&apos;s biggest selling item; Kai Yaang, grilled chicken based on a recipe and cooking method that Andy came across in Chiang Mai; Neua Naam Tok, grilled beef served northeastern-style with a rich, spicy dressing; Yam Khai Dao, a &apos;salad&apos; of fried eggs; and Khao Phat Puu, fried rice with crab.

The verdict? Excellent. Obviously some people are going to question my impartiality here -- and justifiably so -- but I think even Andy would agree that I&apos;m critical to a fault about what I eat, and although not everything was absolutely ideal (the grilled chicken needed some work, an issue which has since been corrected, and serving sizes are definitely more American than Asian), it was a solid, delicious meal and the flavours and textures were all there. The Papaya Pok Pok (not pictured) was as tasty as any som tam Thai I&apos;ve encountered in Thailand, and the fried rice with crab had a spicy richness that in my opinion, ought to be exported east. My mom, who&apos;s been on several visits to Thailand and who loves the food there, was convinced, as were my other dining companions, a chef friend who lived in Thailand for a few years and my half-Thai friend. But perhaps most impressively, my dad, who has a mortal and irrational fear of lemongrass and coriander, genuinely appeared to enjoy the meal, suggesting that this is good food on many different levels.

My second visit was at night, when Pok Pok&apos;s dinner menu boasts some dishes I can&apos;t imagine you&apos;ll find anywhere else in Portland or perhaps even in the US. We had Laap Khua, northern-style fried laap ; Kuung Op Wun Sen, prawns cooked in a claypot with mung bean vermicelli; Cha Ca La Vong, a delicious dish of almost buttery turmeric-marinated catfish served with fresh herbs and noodles; and a truly excellent Hoi Thawt, mussels fried in a crispy batter, a dish that, like Nong&apos;s Khao Man Gai , I&apos;d wager is tastier and more expertly-prepared than its average Thai streetside equivalent.

click on the image My apologies for having been away for such a long time. I&apos;ve spent the last month in a largely internet-free zone and am only just back home in Bangkok. Before getting back to the Asian stuff, I&apos;d like to post a few more things from my visit home.

Allegedly Portland, Oregon has the most breweries per capita of almost any city in the world -- nearly 50 at last count. The beer situation, much like the amount of hops being used, is pretty much out of control, but it was heaps of fun. For a crash-course in local beers, I&apos;d recommend APEX (pictured above), which has an almost overwhelming selection of local and imported beers, not to mention some friendly and knowledgeable bartenders. It&apos;s here where I enjoyed Astoria Brewing&apos;s Poop Deck Porter , Wandering Aengus Cider and a unique &apos;sour&apos; beer aged in Chardonnay casks. I also had several fun nights at Victory Bar , which in addition to some great beers and mixed drinks, has excellent food -- don&apos;t miss the spaeztle. Other Oregon brews that stood out include the beers from Double Mountain in Hood River, Oregon, particularly their Killer Green (using fresh hops from Salem, Oregon) and IRA (India Red Ale); just about anything from the Deschutes Brewery , particularly their Mirror Pond Pale Ale; and from Eugene, Oregon, the Ninkasi Brewing Company&apos;s Total Domination IPA. I consumed some nice beers from Rogue , enjoyed Captured by Porches&apos; Invasive Species IPA and was also reminded of how pleasant a beer Widmer&apos;s Hefeweizen is.

After a month of this, it&apos;s pretty hard to come back to Singha .

Besides being one of the most gorgeous cities I&apos;ve ever been to, and the place where I got to visit a dear old friend and a former student, Vancouver was also, more importantly, where I got the chance to sample poutine for the first time.

This is a dish normally associated with Quebec and is allegedly a bit hard to find on the west coast, but a bit of internet sleuthing led us to Vancouver&apos;s own La Belle Patate. As illustrated above, there was also a smoked meat sandwich and a steamie -- apparently also Quebec dishes -- but the main event was fries, fresh cheese curds and gravy. Beer was also involved, specifically Quebec&apos;s Fin du Monde : The verdict? We all quite enjoyed it. The cheese curds had the requisite squeak, the fries were well-fried and crispy and the gravy well-seasoned and tasty. And perhaps most amazingly, and despite Att&apos;s expression above, we didn&apos;t even feel grossed out afterward.

click on the image As mentioned previously , Portland&apos;s Pok Pok serves a lengthy and tasty menu of largely northern and northeastern Thai-influenced food. For Oregon (and perhaps the rest of the US), this is novel, but if you&apos;ve lived in Thailand for a long time, grilled chicken and papaya salad can seem about as exotic as hamburgers and French fries. Luckily, for something a bit more unusual, you can simply cross the street to Whiskey Soda Lounge.

Originally a venue for customers enduring Pok Pok&apos;s long lines, the Lounge has become a destination in its own right. Essentially a bar, but boasting a brief menu that is nonetheless rather more adventurous than that of Pok Pok, chef/owner Andy Ricker tells me that the Lounge is his effort to get people to eat more unusual dishes: As if to prove this, on one of the days I stopped by the staff were busy making naem , northern Thai -style fermented pork sausage: Other dishes I reckon you&apos;re unlikely to see on any Thai restaurant menu in the US include Neua Sawan, marinated and dried beef that&apos;s been deep-fried; truly tasty Sai Muu Thawt, deep-fried pork chitlins; grilled pork collar with an excellent dipping sauce; Jin Loong, Mae Hong Son-style deep-fried pork balls; and while I was there, a special of grilled pig&apos;s tail, a dish Andy and I ate up in Chiang Mai a few months back . The Lounge is a also a good place to try one of the equally unusual but tasty drinking vinegars made by Andy and his team.

On another visit, I got to spend some time helping Andy and his staff improve their take on khang pong , Mae Hong Son-style fritters of green papaya, lemongrass, dried chili and turmeric: Doing this brought home the difficulty of making such dishes in the US. The restaurant&apos;s chefs and cooks, most following what they&apos;d been taught previously about battering and frying, were making the dish too light and fluffy -- not flat and dense as it should be. Also, the only lemongrass that&apos;s consistently available to restaurants in Oregon is rather coarse and woody with not a whole lot of flavour. But after several attempts, and with a few minor tweaks, we were able to arrive at something that I thought was very close to the real deal. Whiskey Soda Lounge 3131 SE Division St, Portland, Oregon

Although the selections here are much fewer than those of chain suki restaurants Coca or MK , after a few visits, I reckon this is probably my favourite place to do sukii in Bangkok. The old-school atmosphere, once you get past the religious iconography, is fun: and the broth and ingredients are of good-quality and tasty. I particularly like the dipping sauce, which is not as sweet as others&apos; and has an almost meaty shrimp paste-like flavour.

They also do other dishes and we had a nice smokey khao phat puu , fried rice with crab.

click on the image I’m back north for my now-annual month in Mae Hong Son. The weather up here is cool and the leaves have changed colour, but foodwise, things aren’t quite the same this year. Pa Ni had eye surgery so her husband has been in charge of making the sweets. As a result, the suay thamin and alawaa are just slightly off. Pa Add is allegedly refurbishing her house and hasn’t been selling her amazing Tai Yai food at the evening market, and several visits to Baan Phleng have more miss than hit.

Luckily, there’s no lack of khao kan jin (pictured above), Mae Sri Bua is still cooking, and I&apos;ve discovered a couple new places that I hope to share here. I also plan to share some local recipes that I reckon should be replicable just about anywhere. Stay tuned.

click on the image My favourite northern-style laap place in Mae Hong Son closed a while back and it’s taken until now to find a replacement.

On this visit I’ve been getting my laap on at Laap Phrae. Phrae is a province in northeastern Thailand that’s associated with this and other meaty, northern-style dishes, such as the infamous luu . The owners of this restaurant are natives of Phrae, but don’t do luu.

Instead, they do the remainder of the spectrum of northern Thai-style meat dishes, including a decent nuea nueng , beef steamed over herbs and served with a spicy galangal-based dip; various grilled meats, from the user friendly beef to the more challenging paeng nom , cow teats; and kaeng om , an herbal, meaty stew.

But I tend to stick to the laap. Their laap muu khua , northern-style fried pork laap (pictured above, served with greens and herbs and sticky rice), is good, but not amazing. The spice mixture is quite course and the seasoning a bit heavy-handed, but it’s a tasty full-flavoured and meaty meal. The beef version is probably a bit better, and is heavy on the pepper-like dried spices makhwaen and dee plee . They also apparently do laap khwaay , raw buffalo laap like I had up in Chiang Mai a few months ago .

click on the image As mentioned previously , people in northern Thailand love their deep-fried food. And in a weird twist of fate, one kind of deep-fried snack that’s particularly popular in Mae Hong Son is also associated with the streets of Sicily.

Known there as panelle , in Mae Hong Son they’re sometimes called tao huu thawt , literally ‘fried tofu.’ This is a misleading name, as the crispy deep-fried snacks are actually made from chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour.

An obscure ingredient that I’ve only ever encountered here in Mae Hong Son or in Indian groceries (where it’s known as besan), chickpea flour is also popular in Myanmar, particularly among the Shan, the same Tai ethno-linguistic group that inhabit Mae Hong Son, who use it to make something the Burmese call Shan tophu kyaw , ‘deep-fried Shan tofu,’ a dish that outsiders sometimes call Burmese tofu.

The vendors in Mae Hong Son’s morning market sell a variety of dishes using chickpea flour. In one, known as thua oon , ‘warm beans,’ the flour is boiled with water, and the thick, yellow, gelatinous liquid is served over noodles. In another version, the flour and water mixture are allowed to set until firm enough to cut into slices which are eaten in the form a spicy salad .

But the tastiest and seemingly most popular version is thua phu thawt , ie the panelle of Mae Hong Son, where the firm mixture is deep-fried. They’re light and rarely oily, and when hot, actually taste a lot like McDonald’s French fries. In Sicily they’re fried in wide, flat sheets and are apparently served in sandwiches . In Mae Hong Son’s morning market, they’re served as tiny triangles and come with a spicy/salty tamarind-based dip.

Recently a vendor started selling the dish near the house I rent up here. Her version, like those sold in Myanmar, are small and crispy, and are served with a dip that combines chickpea flour paste, lime juice and chili oil (pictured at the top of this post).

This snack and view from the vendor&apos;s stall: are collaborating to take me from my work and make me fat.

Is there a link between the panelle of Sicily and the thua phu thawt of Mae Hong Son? My only guess is the Muslim influence that came to Sicily via the Moors and to Myanmar via India, brought with it chickpea flour. The fried dish that exists today in these disparate destinations could very well be a culinary coincidence.

If you want to make thua phu thawt, pick up a bag of besan at an Indian grocery and follow this Italian recipe . If you&apos;re in Mae Hong Son, simply go here: View Thai Eats in a larger map

I&apos;ve generally been pretty happy with it, and it&apos;s liberating to be able to stuff a camera in my pocket rather than lug around an entire kit. A few other positives:

-Easy to manipulate f/stop and exposure
-Has a &apos;fast&apos; f/2 aperture at the wide end
-Can shoot in RAW
-As shown above, with lots of light and at low ISOs, I can get pretty good quality shots

Some failings:

-Flimsy construction, particularly the wheel that controls the previously-mentioned exposure
-Shots generally tend to look &apos;flat&apos; with little dynamic range
-Pretty noisy, even when shooting in RAW at relatively low (400) ISOs: Mae Hong Son&apos;s Wat Phra That Doi Kong Muu, shot with the Canon PowerShot S90 (ISO 400, f/2.0) As always happens, I wish I&apos;d held out a few months and bought the S95 .

I now have a new favourite laap restaurant in Mae Hong Son.

Lung Roeng does northern-style laap just as I like it: finely minced, relatively dry, lots of dried spice flavour and spicy.

They also serve grilled dishes, meat-based soups and som tam . In addition to beef laap (shown above), I also ordered tam som oh , a classic northern Thai dish combines pomelo, a black paste made from field crabs, slices of lemongrass and eggplant.

If this alone isn’t reason enough to make the trip, across the street is a woman selling the spectrum of local Thai Yai-style deep-fried snacks: Including khang pong (strips of green papaya battered and deep-fried), thua phoo thawt (deep-fried tofu), and thua phoo lueang thawt (chickpea flour fritters).

click on the image I find the food up here in Mae Hong Son fascinating and love making and sharing local recipes. Unfortunately, many of the dishes call for obscure ingredients that aren’t generally available outside of Mae Hong Son or Myanmar’s Shan State.

With this in mind, I asked my neighbour, Phi Laa, a native of Mae Hong Son, to share some recipes I thought one could make just about anywhere. I’ve made no concessions to the following recipes, and assuming you have access to a basic Asian supermarket for some fresh herbs (lemongrass, Kaffir lime leaves, etc.), the most obscure ingredients you’ll need are shrimp paste, dried turmeric powder and sesame oil.

The first recipe is a simple but delicious salad, known locally as saa , of green tomatoes. Nuea tam , ‘pounded meat,’ is an deceptively simple side dish that’s meaty, salty and spicy. And finally, oop is the local word for a type of curry, the chicken version being arguably one of the most famous local dishes in Mae Hong Son. There are several variations on oop, some using different protein such as hard-boiled eggs or pork, with others based around vegetables such as eggplant, potatoes ( oop aloo , from the Hindi word for potato) or ferns. The recipes for the various vegetable-based oop are nearly identical to the below, but don’t have lemongrass or lime leaves, and often include slices of pork belly.

Phi Laa was working too fast for me to record the exact amounts of the various ingredients, so I’ve done my best to provide my own estimates retroactively. But like any Thai cooking, you should taste often and rely on flavour (and experience), not amounts. Saa Makhuea Som (Thai Yai-Style Tomato Salad)

Green and/or slightly unripe tomatoes, 5, seeded and sliced thinly
Shallots, 5, sliced thinly
Fresh chili, 4 (or to taste), chopped
Cilantro and green onion, one stalk each, chopped
Roasted peanuts, about ¼ cup, ground
Salt, to taste
Sesame oil*, to taste

Combine tomatoes, shallots, chili, herbs and peanuts. Season to taste with salt and oil.

Serve alone, as a snack, or with rice.

*The sesame oil in Mae Hong Son is made from unroasted black sesame seeds. It’s very different in flavour and appearance to the more ubiquitous Chinese-style roasted sesame oil. If you’re striving for authenticity, I’d suggest mixing 1 part Chinese sesame oil with 3 parts of some neutral-tasting cooking oil. Nuea Tam (‘Pounded Meat’)

Coarse cut of beef, about ½ kilo, cut into chunks about the length of your pinky finger
Turmeric, about ½ tsp
Salt, 1 Tbsp
Ginger, 1 piece about 4cm long, peeled and chopped
Garlic, about 5 cloves, chopped
Cooking oil, about ¼ cup
Dried chili powder, to taste
Salt

Put beef in a saucepan and cover with water. Add turmeric and salt. Bring to the boil, reduce heat slightly and simmer over medium heat, uncovered, until the water is completely evaporated and beef is tender.

After the beef is cool, pound the pieces in a mortar and pestle until flat: By hand or using scissors, pull the threads of beef apart as thinly and finely as possible.

Pound ginger and garlic in a mortar and pestle until you have a coarse paste.

Heat oil in a wok. Add ginger and garlic mixture and fry briefly until fragrant. Add beef and fry over medium-high heat, stirring constantly to prevent from sticking as much as possible (inevitably, some of the beef will stick to the wok, which is OK and provides the dish with its desired dry texture and smokey flavour): Add dried chili and season to taste with salt. Continue to cook until beef is dry and stringy.

Serve with rice. Oop Kai (Thai Yai-Style Chicken Curry)

Curry Paste
Salt, 1 tsp
Small dried chilies, six (or to taste)
Shrimp paste, 1 Tbsp
Garlic, 3 cloves, chopped
Shallots, 4, chopped
Lemongrass, 2 stalks, sliced
Tomatoes, 2, seeded
Turmeric, about 1 tsp
Masala*, about 2 tsp
Kaffir lime leaves, 5

Chicken, 2 legs, jointed
Cooking oil, about ¼ cup

Pound salt, shrimp paste and dried chilies in a mortar and pestle until you have a fine paste. Add garlic, shallots and lemongrass and pound until you have a coarse paste. Add turmeric, masala and tomatoes and grind until well-combined. Add Kaffir lime leaves and bruise: In a wok, combine curry paste, chicken and cooking oil and enough water to nearly cover the chicken: Cover, bring to a light boil and simmer over med-high heat.** When chicken is somewhat done and the oil has risen to the top, after about about 10 minutes or so, remove lid, increase heat and allow to simmer, uncovered: until most of water is evaporated.

The resulting curry should be rich, fragrantly herbal and oily.

Serve with rice

*This is a local spice mix similar to Indian Garam masala , which can be used as a substitute.
**I was genuinely surprised and somewhat skeptical about this cooking technique – most Thai cooks would fry the curry paste in oil first to allow it to amalgamate and release its oils and flavours – but it worked very well.

click on the image Despite being a northern dish, and despite there being at least six places in Mae Hong Son that serve it, there’s little khao soi here worth recommending. Even one longstanding restaurant that specializes in the dish turns out bland, soulless bowls.

Pho Phiang Phochana, a homebound restaurant near Mae Hong Son’s airport, serves just about everything, including bowls of self-proclaimed ‘Chiang Mai khao soi.’ It was the sign advertising this fact that caught my attention, and that also got me to thinking about the dish. I used to think of khao soi as a northern dish – I’ve probably eaten it in nearly every province in northern Thailand. But if I’m being honest, it’s never really very good outside of Chiang Mai. And if I’m being extremely honest, even in Chiang Mai there are only maybe two places where I care to eat it.

But back to Pho Phiang Phochana. Of the bowls I’ve had in Mae Hong Son, I reckon they do the best one. The broth was just rich and spicy enough, and the sides were of good quality. My only real complaint would be that they overdid it on the crispy noodle topping, making it somewhat hard to get to the main event.

If you’re going to eat khao outside of Chiang Mai, you may as well do it here.

click on the image The quintessential Mae Hong Son dish - or perhaps simply the most popular dish in Mae Hong Son - is a bowl of khao sen . Literally ‘rice threads,’ it’s the local name for a dish combining the thin rice noodles known elsewhere in Thailand as khanom jeen and a thin, pork- and tomato-based broth -- a dish known in northern Thailand as khanom jeen nam ngiaw .

Sold alternatively early in the morning and late in the afternoon, khao sen is regarded as more of a snack than a meal. Vendors who sell the dish always tend to sell it with one other snack-like item such as khang pong , a type of local deep-fried vegetable fritter; deep-fried pork rinds or buffalo skin; or khao kan jin , rice and pork blood steamed in a banana leaf package.

I’ve touched on all of these dishes previously, but I suppose it wasn’t until this visit that I understood just how much the people in Mae Hong Son love them. Khao sen is pretty much the go-to snack here, and there are several places to get it in town, so I thought I’d try to corroborate the vendors I’m familiar with all in one post.

If you’re looking for a khao sen breakfast, you’ll have to go to Talaat Say Yut, Mae Hong Son’s morning market. There, three vendors sell the dish at the northern edge of the market: View Thai Eats in a larger map My personal favourite bowl, and my breakfast at least three or four days a week when I’m here, is served by the two ladies who also do a delicious shallot-based khang pong. In the Thai Yai style, the broth is thin, with only bits of meat, and the dish is topped with deep-fried crispy noodles, garlic oil and some coriander leaves. The vendor across from them, Yay Jang, sells a similar bowl plus a few banana leaf packages of khao kan jin.

During the day, the options are limited to one vendor at the Chao Pho Kho Mue Lek Shrine: View Thai Eats in a larger map The khao sen here includes chunks of blood (normal for the northern-style khanom jeen nam ngiaw, but unusual for the local style) and is served with a somewhat oily papaya-based khang pong (both pictured at the top of this post).

Mid-afternoon is, in my opinion, the best time for khao sen. A pair of friendly vendors operating from a rickety stall along Th Khunlumpraphas serve the dish with my favourite khao kan jin: View Thai Eats in a larger map The meaty rice is drizzled with garlic oil and served with sprigs of fresh coriander or, if they can get it, a type of aromatic root. The khao sen is also good, and is served with optional sides of deep-fried pork rind.

Around the corner, Yay Jang, the same vendor who serves the dish at the morning market, does the same two dishes, with a ‘raw’ version of khao kan jin, in which, I assume, raw blood is mixed with cooked rice: View Thai Eats in a larger map This one’s popular, and you can expect a line here.

click on the image Thai Yai dishes for sale at Mae Hong Son&apos;s morning market I’m finally back home in Bangkok, but felt compelled to do one final post on Mae Hong Son.

One of the things that impressed me the most about the food up there was its locality. The Thai Yai or Shan food in Mae Hong Son is based around a unique repertoire of ingredients, many of which are virtually unknown in Bangkok or even Chiang Mai. Items such as as sesame oil (used as a condiment, not simply as a frying fat) and chickpea flour , and as mentioned in this post , even some of the cooking methods, are things I&apos;ve never encountered elsewhere in Thailand. Obviously this is due to the province&apos;s, well, location, but the twist is that in the case of a border province like Mae Hong Son, these items and techniques stem from a variety of sometimes distant sources and as a result, the cuisine resembles that of nowhere in particular.

Not only are these ingredients and cooking methods specific to the region, but in the case of the former, their origin is also very local. I reckon that of a nam phrik ong (a dip-like dish made from ground pork and tomatoes) I made one afternoon, every single ingredient, except for perhaps the salt, came from the fields around Mae Hong Song. A rice field in Mae Hong Son Perhaps this is not surprising for such a remote, mountainous province. But I found it interesting and suspect that it&apos;s probably the only time in my life that I&apos;ve eaten truly, genuinely locally. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that eating and cooking this way never felt contrived or like any sort of compromise -- the ingredients from Mae Hong Son, in particular the garlic, shallots, turmeric and fruit, are very good -- but rather, made the experience that much more special.

The downside -- and this is the case with much regional cooking in Thailand -- is that even if you&apos;re are in Mae Hong Son, much of this food is relegated to the home. There are a handful of restaurants in town that serve local dishes, but they’re hit and miss, and the only one that really comes close to home cooking is Pa Sri Bua . Unless you know some local folks, you’re only other opportunity to taste authentic, homestyle local food is at one of the city&apos;s markets. A particularly good place to go is the town&apos;s evening market, where Paa Add sells some pretty amazing eats. Another option is the morning market, where vendors like the one pictured at the top of this post prepare a huge variety of local dishes on regular basis, while others seem to take more of a hobby-like approach and sell a couple dishes from medium-sized pots whenever they feel like it. A vendor at Mae Hong Son&apos;s morning market These places are to-go only, and you might miss them if you blinked, but unless you have the chance to eat at somebody&apos;s home, it&apos;s your only opportunity to eat a dish that really has no counterpart anywhere else in the world.

click on the image I&apos;m back home in Bangkok and after months away, am getting into the swing of things by eating Bangkok-style food. Lunch a few days ago was yen ta fo and more recently, phat Thai .

For many people outside of Thailand, particularly those in the US, phat Thai is synonymous with Thai food. And in what must be some Americans&apos; fantasy perception of Thailand, I live literally next door to a phat Thai restaurant. Unfortunately this isn&apos;t my own fantasy scenario -- I&apos;d much rather live next door to a khao khluk kapi restaurant -- but the phat Thai at this no-name shop near Th Silom is better than most.

The noodles are slightly undercooked, as they should be, the dish is relatively well-seasoned with lots of egg and tofu, and comes served with good quality sides. My only gripe would be with the immense serving size, which if you ask me, is practically American.

click on the image Despite its English-language name, I suspect that most people know Tang Meng Noodle (Thai name: Khao Man Kai Tang Meng) for its khao man kai (Hainanese chicken rice). That&apos;s why I first went, when taken there several months ago by C and S, friend/owners of nearby WTF . On that visit, I found the khao man kai to be decent, but a subsequent visit revealed that the real surprise here is in fact the noodles.

This tiny longstanding place specialises in the type of Chinese-influenced noodles popular in Bangkok and central Thailand. The yen ta fo (pictured above) has a slightly sweet and tart broth that holds the usual assortment of noodles, fish balls and veggies, as well as lots of crunchy  bits, ranging from deep-fried tofu to fish skin. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s quite as good as the bowl served at my local joint , but it&apos;s one of the better ones I&apos;ve encountered.

They also do a couple takes on bamee , wheat and egg noodles. You can go with the traditional version, which takes the form of thin round noodles served with roasted pork and Chinese mustard greens, or try the flat type, which come served with a seemingly random mix of just about every protein imaginable, from homemade fish balls to chunks of roast duck: Tang Meng Noodle

I&apos;m never quite sure how to reply to this, as frankly, there are lots of places that do a particular dish very well but very few restaurants excel at everything. The closest I&apos;ve come to the an all-around outstanding restaurant would most likely be nahm , but it&apos;s expensive and most appropriate for a special dinner or splurge.

The Foodie is certainly not my favourite Thai restaurant in Bangkok, but after about six or so visits, it&apos;s proved to be all-around consistently tasty. The restaurant&apos;s been around for a while (previously in a former location) and specialises in somewhat unusual dishes of southern and central Thai origin that you&apos;re not going to find elsewhere.

On my most recent visit we ate (starting at approximately 12 o&apos;clock on the image above and moving clockwise) Prik king pla dook foo, catfish fried in a curry paste mixture until crispy; Kaeng liang goong sod, a peppery, herbal soup with shrimp, mushrooms and pumpkin; Yam som o, a &apos;salad&apos; of pomelo with a spicy/sour dressing; and Ma-ra pad goong-sab, a stir-fry of bitter gourd and minced shrimp with lots of garlic. The Yam som o is the standout, and has the right combination of sweet and spicy, not to mention lots of crunchy dried fish and deep-fried shallots.

click on the image I recently came across two new food-centric guides to Bangkok that are worth sharing.

The most recent release, Bangkok&apos;s Top 50 Street Food Stalls , is written by Chawadee Nualkhair, who also authors the blog Bangkok Glutton (an interview with the author can be seen here ). The book&apos;s name is something of a misnomer, as more than half the places mentioned aren&apos;t stalls at all, but rather are shophouse-bound restaurants. The guide generally appears to be directed toward first-time visitors to Bangkok and/or cautious eaters, as many of the restaurants and stalls mentioned are the sort of &apos;safe&apos; places that have long been profiled in the English-language media, and perhaps more tellingly, each entry includes a line on restrooms (sample: &quot;squat toilet. bring your own toilet paper.&quot;). Correspondingly, the book has some good background information on Thai food for those not necessarily familiar with the cuisine (there&apos;s a particularly helpful illustrated section on Thai noodles), and I quite like the general aesthetic of the book, which emphasises lots of photos and illustrations. If you&apos;re a first-time visitor to Bangkok and are wary about eating off the beaten track (or of finding yourself in a restaurant without a bathroom), this is the guide for you. Available online or at Orchid Books .

Rather than a book, Famuluous Eateries Bangkok takes the form of 52 cards profiling everything from street stalls to restaurants. The English can be pretty bizarre (sample: &quot;You will forget about the waiter&apos;s attitude, once you put the chicken your watering mouth...&quot;), but the authors seemingly made an effort to go past the usual foreigner-frequented suspects, delving into many lesser-known stalls and restaurants, many located in Bangkok&apos;s suburbs. There&apos;s lots of Thai, accurate map and transport information, and I like the idea of sticking a single card in one&apos;s wallet, as opposed to lugging around an entire guidebook. If you&apos;ve lived in Bangkok for a while and want to expand your culinary horizons, this is the guide for you. Available at Kinokuniya .

Recently, after spending some time on Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorn Tree travel forum , I got the impression that some people perceive the process of writing guidebooks as something of a solitary endeavour, done with little input from readers or locals. I sympathise with this to a certain extent and began to wonder how I could go about getting more of readers&apos; opinions on their favourite sights, restaurants, hotels, etc., for the destinations I&apos;m writing about. It was at about this same time that I started using Twitter, and it struck me that the application has immense potential as a tool to uncover exactly this sort of information. So, starting today, I&apos;ll be Tweeting travel- and destination-related questions and queries on a daily basis and would really appreciate your help. If you&apos;d like to pitch in, follow me on Twitter (@austinbushphoto), where my Lonely Planet-related posts will bear the official Lonely Planet hashtag, #lp, supplemented with the name of the destination I&apos;m working on (e.g. #lpbkk, #lpchiangrai).

click on the image No, the above certainly doesn&apos;t look like Thai food, so let me begin with a bit of background info. from the current edition of Lonely Planet&apos;s Thailand guide: (Con)fusion Cuisine A popular dish at restaurants across Thailand is khao phat Amerikan , &apos;American fried rice&apos;. Taking the form of rice fried with ketchup, raisins and peas, sides of ham and deep-fried hot dogs, and topped with a fried egg, the dish is, well, every bit as revolting as it sounds. But at least there&apos;s an interesting history behind it: American fried rice dates back to the Vietnam War era, when thousands of US troops were based in northeastern Thailand. A local cook allegedly decided to take the ubiquitous &apos;American Breakfast&apos; (also known as ABF: fried eggs with ham and/or hot dogs, and white bread, typically eaten with ketchup) and make it &apos;Thai&apos; by frying the various elements with rice.

This culinary cross-pollination is only a recent example of the tendency of Thai cooks to pick and choose from the variety of cuisines at their disposal. Other (significantly more palatable) examples include kaeng matsaman , &apos;Muslim curry&apos;, a now classic blend of Thai and Middle Eastern cooking styles, and the famous phat Thai , essentially a blend of Chinese cooking methods and ingredients (frying, rice noodles, tofu) with Thai flavours (fish sauce, chilli, tamarind). Despite having committed these rather derogatory opinions to print, I have to admit that I quite enjoyed the khao phat American (illustrated above) as served at New Light Coffee House, a vintage diner in central Bangkok. Yes, the rice had been fried in ketchup and was indeed served with a side of raisins (hidden under the egg), but the entire package wasn&apos;t overwhelmingly sweet, and unusually, also came served with a generous piece of roasted chicken (also partially concealed). I liked the sunny-side-up egg but didn&apos;t touch the ham, and in an effort to keep it as Thai as possible given the circumstances, opted to season it with Maggi , not ketchup.

click on the image There are so many examples of wacky English here in Thailand that I generally don&apos;t even notice them any more. But occasionally one stumbles upon a gem.

What&apos;s actually being advertised here is old-fashioned grilled pork. To us, the Sanskrit-origin word sutra - in Thai สูตร - may have connotations of Hindu literature , but to the Thais it has come to mean recipe or more broadly, formula.

Porker, on the other hand, is universal.

click on the image I love Thai-Muslim food and am always on the lookout for a better khao mok (biryani). This dish isn&apos;t too hard to find in Bangkok, but most of the time it&apos;s little more than rice made yellow by the addition of turmeric, and accompanied by a joint of stringy chicken and stock-cube broth. The versions of the dish that I do like - namely those served at Naaz and Yusup - involve a dried spice mixture that goes much deeper than simply turmeric, alternative meats (beef, goat, fish, mutton) and even surprises such as raisins and nuts.

I became aware of Sara about a year ago, via a review in the Bangkok Post .  Since this review, the restaurant has moved into the adjacent Nouvo City Hotel, but still continues to serve a short but interesting menu spanning a couple appetizer, main and dessert courses for each of the restaurant&apos;s three cuisines: Thai, Indian and European. Sara once won a prize for the city&apos;s best phat Thai - despite the fact that the kitchen is halal and most of the staff are Muslim.

But I was here for the khao mok.

At 280B (about $9) it&apos;s expensive, at least as far as khao mok is concerned, but is one of the better versions I&apos;ve encountered lately. The rice was perfectly cooked and fragrant, although I thought it lacked the richness of my two fave biryanis. I ordered khao mok phae , goat biryani, and the meat was fall-apart tender and quite rich. Unusually, at least compared to Thai-style khao mok, the dish wasn&apos;t served with the usual sweet/sour dipping sauce or a bowl of stock, but rather, was accompanied by a tart but delicious and seemingly homemade mango pickle and raita, cucumber and yogurt salad.

Not bad, but I&apos;m still on the lookout...

click on the image Coconut and turmeric curry of blue swimmer crab with southern limes. Image courtesy of nahm. I&apos;ve mentioned nahm, David Thompson&apos;s new Thai restaurant in the Metropolitan Hotel, here previously, but have yet to go into too much detail about my experiences eating there. This was mostly because being friends with David and having eaten there several times gratis, I wasn&apos;t entirely convinced that I&apos;d had an objective dining experience. However, after my most recent meal, I&apos;ve eaten there at least eight times -- both for free and paying, both when David&apos;s been there and when he&apos;s been away -- and feel I can express my opinions about the restaurant&apos;s food in an unbiased manner.

Not that there are going to be any real surprises -- I&apos;ve mentioned my fondness for nahm a few times in this blog and this has yet to change. In fact, the restaurant seemingly gets better every time I eat there, and at this point I reckon that Thompson and team are producing what must be some of the best Thai food anywhere.

For starters, I can&apos;t imagine another Thai restaurant where one is going to find such an evocative and unusual menu. I arrived early for my most recent dinner and enjoyed simply passing the time by reading the descriptions: Blue swimmer crab, peanuts and pickled garlic on rice cakes; Salad of grilled chicken with chilli jam; Cucumber salad with crunchy minced prawn floss and green mango; Braised lobster with sugar cane.

It can be somewhat overwhelming, even if you are familiar with Thai food. But after so many meals at nahm, I&apos;ve been able to round it down to a handful of personal faves: Cured &apos;hiramasa&apos; kingfish salad with chillies, lime and mint is a deliciously spicy and tart yam -like dish -- my mouth puckers in thinking about it now; Green peppercorn relish with shrimp paste, chillies and pork with salted prawns and fresh vegetables is rich and oily and packs a slow, satisfying burn; and possibly my all-time nahm favourite, Thompson&apos;s twist on an old kaeng tai plaa recipe, Smoked fish curry with prawns, chicken livers, cockles and black pepper. The latter is intense, but with the heat of black pepper, not the burn of chilies, and comes with a plate of cooling (and beautifully arranged) fruit and vegetables and ajaat , a Thai/Muslim sweet/sour dressing. In the same genre, the Mussaman curry of &apos;royal project&apos; chicken with onions and golden yams is one of best versions of this dish I&apos;ve encountered; it&apos;s sweet -- as it should be -- but is given additional depth by the presence of more dried spices than most Thai cooks would use, in particular, a fragrant cardamom. The stir-fries at nahm are wonderfully smokey, and I really enjoy the Spicy stir-fried frog with chillies, turmeric, holy basil and cumin leaves, a dish that, according to Thompson, employs three kinds of fresh chilies. As my dining companion last night pointed out, it&apos;s amazing how the dishes at nahm combine so many ingredients but come together as a seamless whole. This, I believe, is one of the unwritten aspirations of Thai cuisine, but one that&apos;s rarely met.

Another thing I appreciate about the menu at nahm is that, unlike a lot of fine dining, the emphasis is not on exotic cuts of meat, but rather, most dishes revolve around herbs, veggies and seafood. I always end up eating far more than I should at nahm, but it still feels like a healthy and balanced dining experience.

Admittedly, the food is expensive, particularly by Thai standards. But 1500B (approximately US$50) is not a great deal to pay for a set meal at a fine dining restaurant. And knowing firsthand the amount of research, trial and error and effort that goes into these dishes, I don&apos;t find it particularly exorbitant. Regardless, there&apos;s no real alternative to nahm, and if you&apos;re not willing to or can&apos;t afford to pay, you&apos;re simply not going to find dishes like this anywhere else.

So in the wake of all the controversy surrounding Thompson and nahm, much of which seems to have been forgotten by now, we&apos;re left with an excellent restaurant. This is welcome news, because now we can simply focus on the food. Metropolitan Hotel 27 Th Sathon Tai, Bangkok

click on the image Hot on the trail of a better khao mok (biryani), I recently dropped by Aisa Rot Dee, a longstanding restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s Banglamphu neighbourhood.  I&apos;d eaten here a couple times previously and was never blown away by the quality of the food, but with khao mok on my mind, felt compelled to return.

Unfortunately, little has changed -- at least from my perspective.

Tucked off the eastern end of Th Tani, Aisa takes the form of a Thai-Muslim food court: serving the spectrum of classic Thai-Muslim dishes: satay , kuaytiaw kaeng and mataba: the beef version of which was tasty and well done, and came with an interesting sweet/sour dipping sauce that, unusually, included slivers of ginger.

The khao mok kai (illustrated at the top of this post), though, lacked the dried spice complexity and richness of a truly stellar version. I liked the sweet/vinegary dipping sauce, though.

click on the image I first mentioned Muslim Restaurant back in 2006 . I recall having enjoyed it at the time, but in the one or two times I&apos;d been back since then, wasn&apos;t blown away by the food and eventually neglected the place altogether.

Recently a friend mentioned the restaurant, and I decided to give it another try. I was curious to see if things had changed and ordered quite a few dishes. There was khao mok phae , goat biryani (pictured above), the &apos;special&apos; version of which served on Mondays and Fridays comes with a side of yogurt and an eggplant curry; sup haang wua , oxtail soup, which although not as tart as elsewhere, was meaty and oniony; a tasty chicken mataba ; and a sweet but rich and complex kaeng matsaman kai , Massaman curry with chicken.

In addition to the above, they also do quite a few prepared curries, a couple deep-fried snacks (including good but greasy samosas), tea and coffee served with goat milk, and Indian/Middle-Eastern sweets. If this isn&apos;t enough, you can always order extra yellow rice, which for reasons unknown to me is called khao burii (&apos;cigarette rice&apos;).

I&apos;m glad I made it back, as I really enjoyed just about everything at Muslim Restaurant, particularly the biryani, which although not as perfect as the version served at nearby Naaz , is worth seeking out.

click on the image I thought I was done with khao mok (biryani), but recently while in the Thewet area I encountered a couple more places selling the dish.

Suwim is a proper shophouse restaurant that sells a very standard Bangkok-style take on khao mok kai (shown above): rice with very little dried spice flavour served with an exceedingly sweet dipping sauce.

Although inoffensive, it&apos;s not really worth seeking out.

Better yet, go around the corner to Ran Khao Mok Kai Lek, which although it&apos;s located on the street, serves a more interesting version: The rice, which they claim to cook using an old recipe, is slightly moist, with a subtle dried spice flavour. I chose to go with deep-fried chicken, which was crispy and tasty, if a bit dry. If you visit at lunch, you can expect a line here; the tart chicken and beef soup are as popular as the khao mok.

click on the image I&apos;m currently updating two Bangkok guidebooks, something which gives me the opportunity to spend time in the parts of town I wouldn&apos;t normally visit.

Ko Ratanakosin, the artificial island from which Bangkok sprung, is one of the more atmospheric parts of town. Unfortunately, dominated by Buddhist temples and royal palaces, the area has relatively few restaurants. If you need culinary incentive to visit, there&apos;s always Pa Aew, a longstanding street stall near Wat Pho.

The older couple here do exactly the kind of rich, oily, spicy central Thai food I love. Just about everything here&apos;s fried, but fried with care. Unsurprisingly, the dishes are somewhat oily, but oily in a rich way and not necessarily greasy.

There&apos;s almost always kung thawt krathiam , large shrimp deep-fried with garlic (shown in the centre of the pic above), and quite a few other seafood-based dishes. On my most recent visit I had phat phrik khing , a thick curry-like stir-fry with a spicy/sweet chili paste, fish and long beans, and phat chaa look chin plaa , a stir fry of  herbs and fish dumplings: Both were rich, spicy, oily and tasty. Highly recommended.

click on the image Thanks to my friend N (email tagline: &apos;story teller&apos;), I was recently introduced to a pretty cool restaurant in yet another obscure part of Bangkok.

Pet Tun Jao Thaa is a tiny restaurant located opposite the Harbour Department (the Jao Thaa) on Thanon Songwat, the ancient riverside lane in Bangkok&apos;s Talat Noi neighbourhood.

The reason most people come here is for the eponymous duck, braised in Chinese spices and served with a spicy/sour dipping sauce. It&apos;s good (more on that in a minute), but I have to say that my favourite dish of the meal was quite possibly mee phat krachet , thin rice noodles fried with krachet , an indigenous herb-like vegetable (illustrated above). Supplemented with seafood and pork, the noodles were well seasoned - think garlic, lots of garlic, and chili - and very tasty, although I could have used a bit more krachet.

Instead of duck, we went for haan phalo ,  goose braised in Chinese spices: The slices of goose breast are served on a platter along with cubes of blood and par-boiled kailan, and the whole lot is slathered with the braising liquid and lots of deep-fried garlic. The goose is tender and flavourful and the phalo is rich and has a meaty depth - a stark contrast to the sweet cinnamon-flavoured sauce that defines many versions of this dish.

Despite this being a duck restaurant, the only duck dish we ordered was kuaytiaw pet , duck noodles, which were quite frankly the least interesting dish of the meal: They weren&apos;t bad, and the duck was tender and tasty, but as a whole the dish was underseasoned and simply not as wow as the other two.

click on the image I&apos;m currently on the road in northern Thailand doing research for Lonely Planet&apos;s Thailand guide. I’d love to blog on the food up here as often as I did during my previous tour of duty back in 2009, but am really pressed for time and will most likely have to keep it to a handful of standout dishes and restaurants.

Alerted by EatingAsia as to the presence of a previously unknown noodle dish in Chiang Khong , I kept my eyes peeled while recently in the riverside town.

While most Thais associate khao soi with squiggly egg noodles and a curry broth, the residents of Chiang Khong have an altogether different idea of the dish. Referred to locally as khao soi nam naa , the dish combines rice noodles served with a clear pork broth, the whole lot topped with a dollop of a thick tomato and minced pork mixture. This dish has become so synonymous with khao soi in Chiang Khong that the other version is called khao soi kathi , &apos;khao soi with coconut milk&apos;.

Following EatingAsia’s lead, I sought out a stall selling the dish in one of the town&apos;s side streets. Upon seeing it, I realised that I’d actually encountered khao soi nam naa (or something very similar to it) previously, in Mae Hong Son, Laos and Myanmar. In Mae Hong Son and Myanmar, I seem to recall that the noodles took the form of round toothsome strands possibly made from tapioca flour, but here the dish was served with a flat rice noodle. The minced pork itself was dry and almost crumbly, and was held together by the paste-like mixture of chili, tomatoes and other spices and herbs. The dish was salty even for my taste, but otherwise was balanced and tasty.

A couple streets over at a flashier restaurant, Pa Orn continues to make and sell khao soi nam naa as her mother did more than 40 years ago: She claims that her mother, an ethnic Dai/Tai from Xishuanbanna, southern China, brought the recipe from her homeland,  suggesting in my mind a pan-Tai link for this dish.

Served in huge bowls, I really enjoyed Pa Orn&apos;s version of the dish, particularly because it was served with a side of some of my favourite veggies. Again, the minced pork was almost dry and crumbly, but was held together by a similar red sauce, which in this case was less tomatoey and salty, but spicier than the previous bowl. Like the previous one, the dish was served with a spicy/salty condiment that was very similar in form and taste to the thick red chili paste one finds at Korean restaurants.

Pa Orn also does some more standard northern Thai dishes, including a meaty khao kan jin , rice steamed with blood: Pa Orn

click on the image Well, not exactly. If you want to get all technical, Phrae is generally regarded as the spiritual homeland of the northern-style version of laap . But neighbouring Nan has a pretty good laap scene as well, as I learned on a recent visit.

My first experience in Nan-style laap was at Pu Som, a dark restaurant decked out with Cowboys and Indians paraphernalia. Fittingly, the emphasis here is on meat, specifically beef.

Pu Som&apos;s laap khua neua , cooked beef laap (illustrated above), is predominately beefy, emphasising meat over spice or heat. It&apos;s also slightly wet in texture and just slightly bitter, due to the addition of beef bile. Like all versions of the dish, it&apos;s topped with deep-fried crispy garlic and a mix of chopped coriander and green onion.

The dish in the middle of the pic is nam phrik khaa , a dip made from shredded galangal that usually accompanies neua neung , a northern Thai dish of coarse cuts of beef steamed over herbs. Dry, pungently herbal and spicy, Pu Som&apos;s is one of the best versions of the dish I&apos;ve encountered. I&apos;d be more than happy with just this tiny bowl and a basket of sticky rice.

Just around the corner from Wat Phumin - my favourite temple in Thailand - is what is allegedly many Nan residents&apos; favourite place for local-style laap, Laap Khue Wiang.

Here I ordered the pork version, laap muu khua : The first thing I noticed  here was that the spice mixture is quite coarse, as were the cuts of meat, which include bits of crispy deep-fried intestines and liver, as well as lots of fatty skin. The dish was well-seasoned, with an emphasis on the spices, and was both crunchy and chewy.

In talking to the woman preparing the dish, I learned that, rather than simply employing different proteins, beef and pork laap are essentially quite different dishes. She explained that she uses an entirely different spice mixture for the pork version, one that uses a variety of spices including not only the usual suspects makhwaen and deeplee , but cinnamon and coriander seed, among others. I had a whiff and it had a complex, almost sweet scent. Unlike other vendors, she doesn&apos;t use blood in her pork laap as she doesn&apos;t like the dark colour it gives the dish. She then went on to explain that her beef version includes a very simple spice mixture that includes only makhwaen, deeplee and chili, and the dish is darkened with blood and bittered with bile.

Songkran, the Thai New Year, is around the corner, and because I&apos;d rather not have dirty water thrown at me by a drunk teenager, tomorrow I&apos;m escaping to the hopefully more sedate streets Chiang Tung/Kyaingtong/Keng Tung Myanmar. Am looking forward to this, as I haven&apos;t been back in several years and am particularly interested in investigating the eats of the various Tai groups there.

click on the image Am just back from Kentung, and no, I wasn&apos;t able to avoid getting drenched. But before I get into that, here&apos;s one of the more interesting places to eat in Chiang Rai. Laap kai , chicken laap , is a common Isaan (northeastern Thai) dish, but as far as I can tell, is a rarity in northern Thailand. It wasn&apos;t until 2008 and with the guidance of an article in a Thai-language food magazine that I encountered the dish. Since then, Lung Eed, a restaurant serving laap kai and a handful of other interesting northern-style dishes, has been my go-to place in Chiang Rai.

Lung Eed&apos;s laap kai is unique in several ways. Firstly, I&apos;m not sure exactly how they prepare it - the meat has light, tender, almost tofu-like texture that&apos;s somewhere between fried and steamed. This is in direct contrast to the copious crunchy deep-fried crispy shallots and intestines. The dish has a very subtle dried spice flavour and very little, if any, chili heat. The whole thing involves maybe five ingredients tops, but is one of those dishes that&apos;s so simple, I imagine that it&apos;d be intimidatingly difficult to replicate.

The laap kai is also available raw (!), and they also do a fish version. And all of their laap are served with a basket of unique fresh herbs including paddy herb, young mango leaves and some sort of previously unknown peppery leaf.

They also do a tasty hor neung plaa , a northern Thai dish of freshwater fish combined with a spice paste, wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed. It was served with the standard spice paste for this dish - heavy on the turmeric and lemongrass - but not having eaten it in a long time, I was surprised at how almost southern Thai in flavour it was.

Lung Eed do a tasty fish head soup and a couple other snacky-type things, and that&apos;s about it.

click on the image I arrived in Kengtung (also known as Kyaing Tong and Chieng Tung), Myanmar, just in time for the lunar New Year. I wasn&apos;t able to avoid getting soaked, but I did meet some interesting people and got to eat some interesting festival foods.

If visiting Kengtung from Thailand, it&apos;s obligatory to be accompanied by a guide, and I was fortunate enough to end up with Sai Leng, a native of Kentgung.

Like vast majority of the inhabitants of Kentung, Sai Leng is ethnic Tai (Tai Nuea, to be exact). His village, located just outside Kengtung, could easily be mistaken for a Dai community in the Xishuangbanna region of southern China: His neighbours are predominately Shan and Tai Nuea, and as is the case with all Tai peoples, food plays a significant part in their traditions and celebrations. Eating at a neighbour&apos;s house on the first day of the New Year celebrations, we had some very local-style drinking food (illustrated at the top of this post): starting at 12 o&apos;clock and moving clockwise, there was deep-fried pork; homemade potato chips seasoned with salt and chili, similar to what I&apos;ve eaten in Yunan; pickled phak kum , a local veggie, served with lots of chili and garlic; pork fried with pickled phak kum and more garlic; a steamed cake of ground peanuts with a delicious chili-oil dip; and in the centre, threads of pork fried with ginger and garlic, similar to the Mae Hong Son dish nuea tam .

While we snacked, the same family was also busy preparing aeb khao , sweets of sticky rice flour, sugarcane sugar, coconut and nuts, strongly associated with Shan New Year: The next morning, after they&apos;ve been steamed, the sweets are given to monks: When the snacks were depleted, we moved onto lao khao phueak , the local name for rice whiskey, with more neighbours: We sat drinking and chatting in a mixture of Thai, English and Shan. The latter, although related to Thai and having many cognates, I found essentially unintelligible. Or maybe it was the lao khao phueak? Either way, when the booze was gone, we then made the next logical step: to the side of the road: After this... Well, to be honest, Sai Leng&apos;s impromptu concert and my dancing soaking wet on the side of the road are pretty much the last things I remember. I woke up in my hotel room at about 10pm having apparently bought some expensive souvenirs on my way home, and in desperate need of something to eat. I headed over to the town centre, where near a stage erected for the festival, at least eight vendors were selling yet another local festival food, khao som : the dish of rice, meat and blood steamed in a banana leaf known as khao kan jin in northern Thailand. Meaty and oily - quite possibly the Shan equivalent of the post-hangover burger.

If you&apos;re thinking of visiting Kengtung and need a guide, Sai Leng speaks English well and has a deep knowledge of Shan/Tai culture. He can be contacted at +95 94903 1470 and sairoctor.htunleng@gmail.com.

click on the image Kengtung has one of the more interesting markets in the region. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t spend as much time here as I&apos;d have liked because I was here during New Years and was terrified of getting my camera wet.

But it only took a brief visit to see that, despite being located in Myanmar, Kengtung&apos;s Kat Luang is similar - if slightly more exotic - to its counterparts in rural northern Thailand.

From the basics: including dried turmeric, dried chilies and disks of dried soybeans - all essentials of Mae Hong Son-style Thai food - to the prepared: which included many similar nam phrik (chili-based dips) and aeb (grilled banana leaf packages of meat), there were many culinary similarities between the food of the various Tai groups in Kengtung and that of the residents of northern Thailand. A particularly fitting example of this was the general porkiness of the selections, as the pork rinds and bottles of lard above illustrate. The sausages, located in the middle, are known as sai ua in northern Thailand and sai long phik in Shan. But the bundles to the right, dork khae , a type of indigenous flower, stuffed with minced pork and herbs and deep fried, were something I&apos;d never seen before.

There were lots of noodles: Including khao sen : thin rice noodles served with a tomato and pork broth - also big in Mae Hong Son .

But the most popular variety were flat, wide rice noodles served with meatballs: the latter tenderised by a vigorous and extremely unsanitary pounding with two sticks: The market is so utterly Tai, there wasn&apos;t a bowl of mohinga to be seen.

click on the image Back in 2008 , Andy Ricker, chef/owner of Portland, Oregon restaurant Pok Pok , was kind enough to share with me his favourite khao soi restaurants in Chiang Mai, which later became the basis of a magazine article I did. During our &apos;research&apos;, we made a couple attempts to visit Khao Soi Prince, one of his top places and a restaurant I&apos;d heard about but had never eaten at. Unfortunately Prince was closed for Ramadan, and  on subsequent solo visits to Chiang Mai, the restaurant was always closed for one reason or another.

Well it&apos;s unfortunate that it took me so long to get here, because even after my first and only visit last week, Khao Soi Prince is now one of my favourite places to get a bowl.

Named after the nearby Prince Royals College, Prince is a longstanding Muslim restaurant that also does biryani and some rich-looking curries. The khao soi kai , chicken khao soi, is a bit unusual  in that rather than the single chicken leg that most places use, Prince uses seemingly marinated chunks of breast meat, a bit of brown meat, and what appeared to be some very tender liver and/or blood. Despite its somewhat thin and watery appearance, the curry broth here is actually very rich and fragrant with the taste and smell of dried spices. And to top it off, they even use the good-quality pickled mustard greens topping.

And speaking of Andy, news just came in as I was about to post this that Ricker won Best Chef Northwest in the 2011 James Beard Foundation awards! Congrats, Andy - looking forward to celebrating over a bowl at Prince next week!

click on the image The northern Thai city of Mae Sot seems like an unlikely place to find a particular style of phat Thai - a dish I usually associate with central Thailand. But while in the city recently, I spotted three or so shops serving a somewhat unusual version of the dish.

The local twist here is the addition of pork (for those of you familiar with northern Thai food this won&apos;t come as a surprise). The dish is served with a small pile of crispy deep-fried pork rinds and topped with a few slices of barbecued pork. Real Thai-style phat Thai isn’t generally served with any meat (other than dried or fresh, shrimp), so I appreciate the addition of protein in what is normally a pretty substantial carb blast. It&apos;s also quite simply a good dish of phat Thai: the noodles themselves aren’t gloopy or heavy, although like every dish of phat Thai I’ve ever encountered, required additional seasoning with fish sauce and dried chili.

If you’ve never been, Mae Sot’s a pretty interesting food town. There’s a couple restaurants like this serving interesting mainstream-Thai-type fare, some northern Thai food, quite a few Muslim restaurants and lots of Burmese food , particularly at the town&apos;s morning market and for breakfast .

click on the image The northern Thai city of Sukhothai has its own signature noodle dish, kuaytiaw Sukhothai . There&apos;s nothing particularly northern about the dish, other than the copious use of pork, and it appears to be a slight a variation on Chinese-influenced central Thai noodle dishes. The dish is all about the pork, and is served with slices of roasted and/or boiled pork, pork rinds, slices of liver and often intestines. Other ingredients include thin slices of phak chee farang , sawtooth coriander, par-boiled and thinly-sliced green beans, a small mound of ground peanuts and a dollop of palm sugar. And unlike most noodle dishes in Thailand, you don&apos;t specify which noodles you&apos;d like - Sukhothai-stye noodles are almost exclusively served with sen lek , thin rice noodles.

Over the days I was in Sukhothai, I hit three of the town&apos;s most famous places to get the dish.

Ta Pui, whose noodles are pictured at the top of this post, claims to be the original vendor of the dish. It&apos;s easily the least flashy restaurant (it used to be little more than a brick floor and tin roof - it now has a cement floor), and correspondingly serves what is probably the most balanced bowl.

Despite this, the noodles: were probably my least favourite of the lot, although admittedly the differences between all of these places are very subtle. In this case I found Jayhae&apos;s bowl to be the sweetest and least porkiest. This restaurant also does phat Thai in the local style, which is similar to that served in Mae Sot .

click on the image Jay Noy is the epitome of the northern-style food stall: informal, meat based and fully flavoured. The whole place is little more than a grill and one or two tables - most of its business is take-away - concealed in a parking lot/shed in the northern city of Lampang. Yet as is often the case in Thailand, a restaurant&apos;s atmosphere has an inverse relationship with the quality of its food, and Jay Noy is no exception to this rule.

Starting at 12 o&apos;clock and moving clockwise, there was a rich curry-like stir-fry of mushrooms and bamboo (it&apos;s mushroom and bamboo season up here); kaeng som phak boong , a deliciously sour northern-style soup of pork bones and crunchy morning glory; nam phrik taa daeng , a slightly watery but spicy version of the northern Thai dried chili dip staple; sticky rice; aeb moo , a grilled pork dish, and jin som , sour pork; and crunchy pickled veggies.

Everything I&apos;ve eaten here is great, but the highlight is the meat, in particular the jin som (&apos;sour meat&apos; - the northern Thai name for naem ) and the aeb : The former (on the left) is fermented pork, that in this case, has been grilled in its banana leaf package. The latter is ground pork blended with egg and a curry paste, all of which are also wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled: It&apos;s the northern Thai equivalent of the central Thai hor mok , a type of steamed curry, and the result is smooth, rich and meaty, and only a tiny bit spicy.

Arrive later in the day after the aeb and jin som have run out and Jay Noy does grilled meat, from pork ribs to cow teats.

And since you&apos;re in Lampang already, you may as well consider dessert at Khun Manee .

click on the image The tiny town of Pai is one of northern Thailand&apos;s most popular destinations. And understandably so: it&apos;s laid-back, cheap and beautiful: Unfortunately - at least if you travel to eat - there are very few places to get local food. There&apos;s some tasty Chinese food, innocuous and backpackerish Thai, and a couple OK places selling Israeli standards, but if you&apos;re interested in trying northern- or Mae Hong Son-style eats, you&apos;re pretty much limited to a handful of restaurants. Luckily, two of them are exceptional. Laap Khom Huay Pu specialises in mostly meaty northern-style dishes such as laap khua and kaeng om (both pictured at the top of this post). The laap khua, northern-style fried laap , is probably my favourite version of the dish in Thailand, and successfully balances meaty, spicy and aromatic. The laap gets its dark colour from the addition of blood, and comes accompanied with a variety of fresh herbs, some spicy, some bitter, which change with the seasons. The kaeng om, a meat-and-offal-heavy soup, is almost curry-like in its thickness here, and is correspondingly rich and spicy, with tender bits of tendon, intestine, heart and liver.

Again, quite possibly my favourite take on the dish, the broth here is dark, rich and spicy, and is even tastier when accompanied with the restaurant&apos;s excellent pork rinds. There&apos;s no English sign here - simply look for the clay pots that are set out in front of the shop every afternoon.

At least some folks still choose to walk: although they appear to be limited to a particular demographic.

click on the image I recently spent a few days up in Chiang Mai eating and cooking with some pretty knowledgeable and and talented folks. There was Andy Ricker, chef/owner of Pok Pok , in Portland Oregon; JJ Goode , a writer based in New York City, with whom Andy and I will be embarking on an exciting and soon-to-be-announced project; and Sunny: Sunny, a longtime friend of Andy&apos;s, is a native of Chiang Mai who grew up in a household that was always cooking, both professionally and domestically. Like many Thai cooks, he cooks without referring to recipes, and appears to have an encyclopedic knowledge of northern Thai cooking. I suspect that much of what is served at Pok Pok has most likely, directly or indirectly, been influenced by Sunny, and understandably so: while in Chiang Mai, I got to sample several examples of his handiwork, including a very refined salad of green mangoes, a northern-style stir-fry of longbeans and eggplant, and a yummy kaeng som , all of which were delicious.

But the most delicious and interesting dish - at least for me - was Sunny&apos;s northern-style pork laap : I suspect that I risk overplaying northern-style laap on this blog, but I really do find it one of the most satisfying of Thai dishes. And despite its deceptively simple appearance, it&apos;s also one of the more nuanced and complicated Thai dishes I&apos;ve encountered. And observing firsthand the fluency and confidence with which Sunny prepared it reminded me that, despite more than a decade in this country, I still know very little about Thai food.

A good laap starts with a good spice mixture, which Sunny&apos;s sister makes (in fact, it&apos;s the very one used at Pok Pok). But this time Sunny decided to made it himself, from scratch. Starting with a specific mixture of dried spices that included makhwaen , peppercorns and deeplee , he dry-fried them until fragrant, then, with JJ&apos;s help, pounded them paste along with galangal, dried chilies, shallots and garlic: After this was finished, shallots and garlic were fried until crispy, and pork offal (specifically skin, heart and lower intestine) was boiled along with some lemongrass, shrimp paste and turmeric, until tender: The next step involved mincing raw pork, blood and fresh herbs with a machete-like knife (illustrated at the top of this post). This was done for a long time - at least 20 minutes - despite the fact that we were already starting with ground pork. Obviously we needed a big strong man to do this, and since I was busy taking pics, we settled for Andy. Andy&apos;s both a talented cook and a modest guy, which is why I find it a bit strange that he insists on wearing his James Beard medal whenever he cooks: After being fried in oil until fragrant: the curry paste mixture was then blended with a bit of the broth left over from boiling the offal, seasoned with salt and stirred into the raw meat along with the sliced offal and the deep-fried crispy shallots and garlic. At this point - at least if you&apos;re making a real northern-style raw meat laap - the dish is done: I ate some (actually, quite a bit) of the raw laap, and it was delicious, with a smooth texture (undoubtedly the result of all that chopping) and a rich flavour. Sunny then took the remaining meat, and working it in a saucepan with a bit more broth and some oil, made the more approachable laap suk or laap khua , &apos;cooked laap&apos;: We then took both laaps, a cooler of sticky rice, a bucket of greens and some grilled chicken to some of the most appreciative diners I&apos;ve ever encountered: Eating at, photographing and writing about restaurants and stalls in Thailand has given me something of a warped perception of the country&apos;s food - one that in some ways contrasts with the food that Thai people cook and eat at home. It&apos;s always an eye-opening and rewarding opportunity to be able to eat the food of and learn from talented home cooks, and I wish I could do it more often.

click on the image I&apos;m pretty amazed when I scroll through this blog and see the pics of all the food I&apos;ve eaten in Thailand. Quite frankly, I&apos;ve eaten a lot of stuff. And just in case you&apos;re wondering, I do mean this in the boastful way that it sounds.

But I also mean it in the literal sense: I eat a lot.

As illustrated above, my recent visit to Khao Khaa Muu Trok Sung, a longstanding restaurant off Th Charoen Krung, was an example of the latter. Despite my previous declaration, I haven&apos;t actually eaten much khao khaa muu , Chinese-style stewed pork leg, so I&apos;m not the best judge of the dish. But I enjoyed the version sold here. The pork was fall-apart tender and well-seasoned. As is the case with this dish, it was accompanied by a vinegary dipping sauce studded with fresh chilies - a necessary divergence from all the fat and meat. I would have liked more of the crispy pickled veggies, but this was somewhat made up for by the tasty soup with bitter melon. The only real weak point was the muu krob , crispy pork, which seemed to have been poorly seasoned and clumsily deep-fried several hours previous.

And just in case this wasn&apos;t enough fat and cholesterol, just across Th Charoen Krung is a popular vendor of sticky rice for mango and/or durian sticky rice: which of course, I visited.

Like I said, I&apos;ve eaten a lot of stuff.

click on the image The area around northern Bangkok&apos;s Victory Monument is home to several restaurants selling kuay tiaw ruea , &apos;boat noodles&apos;. The restaurants are known for serving exceptionally cheap - at little as 5B - bowls of the dish,  and are the legacy of a tradition that previously saw the noodles prepared and sold from small wooden boats in a nearby canal. Today, the canal is fetid and mostly empty and all the shops have moved to land. The restaurants remain quite well known, but aren&apos;t particularly tidy or tasty, and their setting at the edge of a stinky canal isn&apos;t very inspiring.

Luckily, a couple blocks away on a slightly more pleasant stretch of the canal, is, Sam-Ang Kulap. Having served boat noodles for more than 40 years now, they claim to be among the first of five boats to have sold the dish in the area. According to a history of the restaurant that&apos;s printed on the wall, a that time a bowl cost 1B, and it wasn&apos;t until the late &apos;70s that they began to sell the noodles from land. They remain in the same location today: In 2011 a bowl of boat noodles will set you back 15B (US$0.50), but the despite the low price, the noodles here are solid, and in my opinion could serve as the archetype for a well done, balanced bowl of a boat noodles. The broth is rich, round and meaty with relatively little spice flavour or spiciness, and is supplemented with a few cuts of tender meat (beef or pork), blood, and/or meatballs. The bowls emerge from the boat-shaped prep station with amazing speed: perhaps a legacy of the boat era.

Ask for a bowl of par-boiled phak bung (a crispy green vegetable sometimes called morning glory) and you have a delicious and balanced, Bangkok-style meal.

click on the image I&apos;ve finally got a bit of free time and have been investigating the restaurants and stalls recommended in a handful of Thai-language food guides I bought months ago. Most recently, Kin Rob Krung 2 (&apos;Eating Around Bangkok 2&apos;) led me Somsak Pu Op, a streetside stall in Thonburi, across the Chao Phraya River from Bangkok.

Somsak specialises in pu op wun sen , crab &apos;baked&apos; with wun sen (glass jelly noodles). In fact, they essentially only do this dish, if you don&apos;t count a variant using prawn, as well as a couple steamed shellfish dishes. On my visit, the crab was cashed, so we went with the prawns.

As is the norm with this dish, the seafood is put on a bed that includes a liberal chunk of pork fat, lots of garlic, black peppercorns and Szechuan pepper: These ingredients are then &apos;baked&apos; (the op in the name) in a lidded clay or heavy metal pan, with the noodles and a sprinkling of fresh herbs.

Somsak does this in stages, cooking the prawns first: before seasoning (with Maggi and a bit of water) and adding the noodles, followed by a final topping of green onions. The downside with this method is that the prawns tended to be a bit overcooked, and the noodles undercooked - ideally the latter should be slightly dry (even a bit crispy at the edges, if you ask me) and seasoned by the pork fat, garlic and pepper. This isn&apos;t the case here, but any any lack of seasoning is made up for by Somsak&apos;s delicious Thai seafood-style dipping sauce, which was intensely tart and spicy.

Probably not the most balanced version of the dish, but satisfyingly rich, and at 200B, relatively cheap.

click on the image Yen ta fo , noodles (typically rice, but sometimes wheat noodles) served in a slightly sweet broth with fish-based dumplings, is one of the most popular dishes in Bangkok. Stalls selling yen ta fo are just about everywhere, and over the years I&apos;ve noticed that many of them claim a link with Wat Khaek - the somewhat derogatory name given to the Hindu temple at the corner of Th Silom and Th Pan. Yen ta fo is Chinese in origin (I suspect it has links - at least linguistically - to yong tau foo ), but the name-dropping suggests that the dish may have been introduced to Thai diners from a shop or stall near this temple.

Origin speculation aside, today there&apos;s only a single yen ta fo restaurant near Wat Khaek. And although I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the original of Bangkok-style yen ta fo restaurant, the aged interior and rustic bowls of noodles served here suggest that it&apos;s been around for quite a while.

The yen ta fo here is good, but not exceptional. The broth, which is made from chicken: is balanced but bland, and needed more than a bit of fish sauce and dried chili to liven it up. There were lots of veggies and fishy dumplings, both supplemented with crispy salted squid and cubes of blood. This being a classic version of a classic Bangkok dish, I expected it to be much sweeter, and actually missed the tinge of sweet and the punch of garlic of a truly outstanding vendor like Yen Ta Fo JC .

Even more than the yen ta fo, I enjoyed khanom jeen kaeng kai : chicken curry served over fresh rice noodles. The former was pleasantly salty and spicy and was supplemented with eggplants, basil leaves and fresh chilies.

Yen Ta Fo Wat Khaek also serve a few other characteristically Bangkok-style Thai/Chinese dishes such as khaa muu , stewed pork leg and popia sot , fresh spring rolls.

click on the image Thanks to leads from both Kin Rob Krung 2 and my buddy J , I was recently pointed in the direction of Lung Chu, a shophouse restaurant selling a short-list of Chinese-style dishes. They do a variety of steamed buns, dumplings and noodles here, but the specialty is khao hor bai bua (ข้าวห่อใบบัว), rice and other bits steamed in a lotus leaf. I sincerely needed pointing in this direction, as I was never previously a fan of this dish, having found previous encounters with it heavy, sweet and oddly enough, somewhat waxy.

Lung Chu&apos;s version is still somewhat heavy (I think this is probably impossible to avoid), but this was tempered somewhat by the addition of a delicious vinegar- and crushed fresh chili-based dipping sauce. In addition to rice, the lotus leaf packet includes tender marinated pork, mushrooms, lotus seeds and a salted egg yolk, and is both well seasoned and fragrant. If you&apos;re sharing, it&apos;s the perfect savoury snack.

Lung Chu also serve some very nice salapao (ซาลาเปา), steamed buns (seen in background of pic above), although I suspect that they&apos;ve simply sourced these from another vendor. They&apos;re light without being dry or paper-like, and the sweet bun (ใส้หวาน) in particular had a deliciously fragrant sweet bean filling.

The restaurant serves a pretty predictable repertoire of Chinese-Thai/Bangkok-style dishes, from noodles to rice topped with crispy pork belly (illustrated above). They&apos;re OK, but the restaurant&apos;s specialty, and the real reason to eat here, is the paa thong ko (ปาท่องโก๋ - the menu calls them &quot;Grilled Chinese Donut&quot;) deep-fried bits of dough: The difference here is after being deep-fried, the paa thong ko are briefly grilled, making them even crispier than freshly deep-fried paa thong ko .

click on the image Forgive my lack of blogging, but I’ve been on something of a whirlwind European Tour. Istanbul, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Barcelona; they&apos;ve all been eye-opening and heaps of fun, and of course, have involved lots of amazing eats. For me, there was nothing more exotic than eating baklava in Istanbul or encountering real tapas for the first time in Barcelona, and I’ll try to post on some of those experiences soon. But to be honest, I’m most excited about eating in my current destination, Portugal, and want to try to blog about it while I&apos;m here.

I’ve fantasized about visiting Portugal for a while now, and since my last trip to Macau , specifically, its food. I’ve been in Porto a couple days now and just as I suspected, the food hasn’t been as sophisticated as Spanish food or as exotic as Turkish, but somehow it feels just right.

Portuguese appears to be a real meat-and-potatoes kind of cuisine, as exemplified by one of my first meals, frango no churrasco, Portuguese-style grilled chicken. The restaurant, Pedro Dos Frangos, was recommended by the nice lady at the tourist information office, and was typical of most of the restaurants I’ve encountered here so far; delightfully old school, mostly masculine and with a buzzing dining counter (the man next to me ate his entire meal - chicken soup, a ginormous slice of pudim molotov and an espresso with a shot of booze - standing up).

I sat at the long stainless steel counter and ordered a half chicken, which was skewered and grilled over coals: The bird was crispy and well seasoned, although I reckon it could have done with some brining (a must for chicken dishes, I’m now convinced – see here for details). The traditional accompaniment is deep-fried potatoes and the traditional topping is molho de piri-piri, olive oil steeped with dried chilies. It was a pleasure to finally get to sample these dishes on their home turf, particularly since I&apos;d tried making them previously (I&apos;d say we came pretty close). The meal was coupled with a couple glasses of cheap and very drinkable vinho regional, and dessert was chunks of soft, buttery queijo flamengo and marmelade, quince paste: It was heaps of fun, and I found a lot in common with dining in Thailand: the lack of pretension, friendly restaurateurs, the full-flavouredness and the low prices.

Am looking forward to more meals in this country.

click on the image Reverence for food appears to run deep in Portugal. The residents of the northern city of Porto are known as Tripeiros, ‘tripe-eaters’, for their love of the local dish, tripas à modo do Porto, Porto-style tripe. The dish is apparently so important that locals are willing to deface one of their city&apos;s most famous landmarks: in order to advertise that the dish be added to a list of world culinary heritage: My first experience with tripas was also my first meal in Portugal. Taken at an informal café in the centre of Porto, the dish was served in a way that now strikes me as very Portuguese: on a stainless steel platter or bowl with an abundance of starch, in this case, rice: The tripe was relatively minimal and instead the dish was dominated by a white beans, with salpicão , a type of salted beef, what appeared to be pork belly and a salty broth that had hints of cumin. The dish cost, if I remember correctly, 3 Euros, and I ate it at the dining counter with a mini-bottle of the house red.

My second experience with the dish was at a restaurant named, appropriately, Restaurant Tripeiro. This was a much more upmarket version of the dish, costing several times as much and being several times larger in volume, but containing roughly the same combination of beans, tripe, salted beef, and in this case, a variety of sliced sausages and a few slices of carrot. It was served in a slightly more upmarket stainless steel container (illustrated at the top of this post), in, as is seemingly the case in all restaurants in Portugal, cheap or expensive, a dining room dominated by a blaring television: I ate it with a delicious red vinho verde and a dish of olives, and because I feel foolishly obligated to eat as much of my food as possible, I walked around Porto feeling extremely full for the next six hours.

click on the image I haven&apos;t been to France since I was a teenager and have never been to Italy, but I&apos;m willing to wager that the café scenes of both of these countries pale in comparison to that of Portugal. The sheer amount of shops serving a combination of coffee, light snacks and pastries - known in Portuguese as pasterlarias - in Porto and Lisbon was frankly, quite ridiculous. Within a block of Porto&apos;s main market alone I can recall at least eight from memory. And not only were these pastelarias everywhere, but the the quality of both the coffee and sweets were quite high and the prices low (a gal ã o - the Portuguese equivalent of a café au lait/latte - and a pastry, my usual breakfast in Portugal, typically cost around €2) .

I was particularly interested in Portugal&apos;s sweet snacks, as they possess quite a few culinary links with Asia. The most obvious example of this are the pasteis de nata, egg tarts, which are now a standard sweet in parts of East Asia. These are unavoidable (and profoundly delicious) in Portugal, and I reckon I had at least one or two every day, sprinkled with cinnamon and consumed with uma bica (espresso).  With a direct link to Southeast Asia are the various egg yolk-based desserts - ovos moles, fios de ovos - believed to have been introduced to Thailand via Portuguese traders during the 16th century. These were somewhat less common, and I mostly encountered them in the way of fillings or toppings for a variety of pastry-based treats and not eaten on their own, as they still are in Thailand.

click on the image I&apos;m finally back home and hope to do a couple more Euro posts in the near future, but for now am keen to jump back into the Thai stuff... Khao tom (ข้าวต้ม) translates as &apos;boiled rice&apos;, but can be refer to a couple different rice-related food concepts. Many Thais associate the term with khao tom kui (ข้าวต้มกุ๊ย), a Chinese-style of dining that involves lots of small dishes, typically eaten with small bowls of watery rice. It can also describe a dish of rice served in broth with seafood. I first encountered the latter years ago at a cozy restaurant in my former neighbourhood in northern Bangkok . I have to admit that I wasn&apos;t initially impressed with khao tom - it&apos;s pretty bland when compared to just about any other Thai dish. But after subsequent and increasingly frequent visits over several years, I learned to like the dish, and also grew quite fond of the place that served it.

Since having moved downtown, I haven&apos;t eaten much khao tom, and with the old place in mind, have had my eye open for a new one. The Thai-language food guide Kin Rob Krung 2 and the English-language Famulous Eateries both recommend Nay Hor, a longstanding restaurant on Th Charoen Krung, so I investigated. Nay Hor is unabashedly old-school Thai/Chinese (think overabundant florescent lighting and an aged owner/money collector slumped grumpily behind office furniture), and is easy to locate by some immense stuffed fish out front. These are generally both good signs, but I made the mistake of ordering the &apos;mixed&apos; bowl, which included fish skin, fish eggs and what appeared to be pork intestines - items I don&apos;t really care for. Still, I thought the quality of the seafood was pretty good; I particularly enjoyed the oysters, fish and the bateng (cubes of marinated, deep-fried pork). The dipping sauce is, like at other khao tom restaurants, made from fermented soybeans, but here it lacks chili and has been blended, giving it the consistency and appearance of tahini. They also had bags of deep-fried tofu strips, which are great to crumble into to the broth or dip in the bean sauce, but unfortunately they appeared to have been fried long ago.

Would I make it my regular? Ideally not. But given the pricey bowls at Chiang Kii or the traffic nightmare involved in getting to my old place, I may very well be eating there again soon.

click on the image Much fine dining in Bangkok is relegated to hotel-based restaurants. This is fine for some people, and several of Bangkok&apos;s hotel kitchens are putting out some great food, but for most of us, hotel dining often lacks character and rarely feels like a good value.

Luckily, some clever folks have swooped in to provide us with an intriguing alternative.

Opposite, run by the people who started WTF , is a multi-purpose event space that has embarked on a series of pop-up dining events. Their most recent dinner (pictured above) was my first time experience with the concept, and took the form of a night of Roman cuisine as prepared by Italian chef Paolo Vitaletti. Dishes included Roman-style tripe, borlotti beans with prosciutto skin, deep-fried artichoke, and la porchetta, suckling pig stuffed with pork offal and fennel pollen that was easily the most delicious pork dish I&apos;ve encountered in a while. There was tasty prosecco and wine, and real bread, flown in from Italy. In addition to enjoying dishes one won&apos;t find elsewhere in Bangkok, we were pouring our own wine, scooping second helpings from communal bowls and making friends. It was all a lot like eating at the home of a very talented home cook, and my take-home impression of the meal was that this is how dining should be: informal, communal and tasty. At 2500B (about US$80), it wasn&apos;t exactly cheap, but with good food, generous serves and virtually free-flow booze, I can&apos;t imagine that anybody would feel that that he didn&apos;t get his money&apos;s worth.

If this sounds like your thing, stay tuned to opposite&apos;s website or Twitter feed (@oppositebangkok) for their next pop-up. opposite 27/1 Soi 51, Th Sukhumvit, Bangkok

click on the image The Thai-language food guide Aroijang recently led me to Khao Man Kai Jao Kao, a restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown known for its khao man kai , Hainanese chicken rice. According to the guide, the restaurant still does the dish the old-fashioned Hainanese way, using fat kai ton (castrated roosters) and cooking the rice over coals. This resulted in rice that was just about perfectly cooked, well seasoned and pleasantly fatty, but the chicken was unremarkable and lacked the tender, velvety texture that defines a truly remarkable version of this dish. Instead of the more common sides of cucumber slices and chicken soup, here the rice and chicken is served with a chunk of blood and garnish of coriander, as well as the usual fermented soy bean dipping sauce, which in addition to the usual ginger and chili, also included coarse chunks of garlic.

Almost certainly more interesting was the restaurant&apos;s tom lueat muu : literally &apos;boiled pig blood&apos;, a soup that, in addition to its namesake, also includes lean slices of pork, crispy pork belly, spleen, stomach and intestine. The meat and offal was extremely tender and flavourful without being too porky. The broth is clear and garlicky and came served with a couple leaves of lettuce and a sprigs of a fresh herb not unlike Italian parsley. You can order the soup with rice noodles or a side of rice, and if you find the offal too overpowering, you can temper it with a spicy/sour dipping sauce that combines crushed fresh chilies and vinegar.

click on the image A while back, I asked fellow Bangkok-based blogger and likewise graduate of the University of Oregon, Sirin, about her favourite places to eat in Bangkok. Without hesitation she mentioned Somsong Phochana, a shophouse restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s Banglamphu neighbourhood. I ate there for the first time not long after our chat, and after a few subsequent visits, suspect that Somsong may also be nudging its way onto my own favourites list.

Somsong is actually the name of the current owner&apos;s deceased mother, who started the restaurant more than 40 years ago. A native of Sukhothai, she began by selling curries and stir-fries, and later also sold the signature dish of her hometown, kuaytiaw Sukhothai , Sukhothai-style noodles. The dish is still available today: and appears to be the reason most people visit Somsong. Kuaytiaw Sukhothai combines thin rice noodles, a sweet broth, thinly-sliced long bean, various cuts of pork, and a topping of deep-fried pork rind. The version here also includes - unusually - crunchy squares of salted radish and ground peanuts. But despite the accolades and fans, I found the dish (both the &apos;dry&apos; and broth versions) overly sweet and one-dimensional, lacking the meatiness and oily richness of the versions I&apos;ve encountered up in Sukhothai .

Instead, what brings me back to Somsong is the restaurant&apos;s excellent central Thai-style curries and spicy stir-fries. In particular, you&apos;re safe ordering just about anything that contains the restaurant&apos;s look chin plaa kraay , dumplings make from a type of freshwater fish. Tender and pleasantly fishy, they&apos;re some of the best I&apos;ve encountered in Bangkok, and feature in several dishes including Somsong&apos;s excellent green curry (pictured at the top of this post). If you&apos;ve only encountered green curry at Thai restaurants abroad or at places that predominately serve foreigners, you might initially be disappointed, as the curry itself is rather thin and watery and has little of the coconut milk creaminess that I suspect many have come to associate with the dish. Instead, the emphasis is on taste, not texture, and an effort is made towards a balance of sweet and savoury, with tender eggplants providing a slightly bitter kick. The curry above was served over khanom jeen noodles instead of rice, and as with many central Thai dishes that include fish or seafood, also included thin strips of krachaay (a root herb with a camphor-like flavour), which serve to counter any unpleasant fishy flavour.

On a previous visit I had a somewhat more traditional green curry with chicken, accompanied by a spicy stir-fry of frog: And on my most recent visit there was a tempting kaeng matsaman , but as usual, I went for the green curry.

I&apos;ve also been told that Somsong does excellent desserts, but I&apos;m usually too full to investigate. For more descriptions of the dishes at Somsong, proceed to Sirin&apos;s write-up, here .

At Sor Naa Wang, a shophouse restaurant near Bangkok&apos;s City Hall, the noodles are seasoned with plenty of garlic and fresh chili, and come from the wok with lots of delicious singed bits. The dish is served with a somewhat unusual tart/salty dipping sauce that combines sliced fresh chili, sliced shallots, fish sauce and lotsa lime.

They also do a reputedly tasty sukii haeng that I&apos;m keen to investigate, as well as several other fried noodle dishes, but I&apos;ve yet to work my way past this one.

click on the image This is a fantastically simple but tasty dish you can make even if you have access to only the most rudimentary Asian ingredients. One of many Chinese-influenced fried rice dishes available in Thailand, khao phat nam liab revolves around nam liab , Chinese salted olive (Western-style olives are not a substitute), which gives the dish a distinct briny/umami flavour. I suspect that I first encountered the dish at Je Ngor , a Chinese-Thai seafood chain with several branches around Bangkok.

The amounts below are approximate, and like always, you should constantly be tasting the dish as you cook it to arrive at the flavour that your prefer. To my mind, this dish should have an assertively salty flavour that is balanced by the acidic sides.

And as written instructions aren&apos;t always enough, here&apos;s a video - in Thai only - of the dish being made: Khao phat nam liab Lime, 1, diced
Ginger, 1 small piece, peeled and diced
Fresh chili, to taste, sliced
Cilantro, a couple sprigs
Roasted cashews, a couple Tbsps

Oil, 2 Tbsp
Minced pork, about 1/4 cup
Garlic, 2-3 cloves, minced Nam liab (Chinese salted olive), about 4, seeded and chopped
Cooked rice, about 2 cups*

White pepper, to taste
Sugar, to taste
Soy sauce, to taste

Prepare lime, ginger and chili as described above, and set aside along with cilantro and cashews.

In a wok over medium-high heat, heat oil and add pork. Saute until somewhat dry and crumbly, about four or five minutes. Add garlic and salted olive, saute a minute or two longer until ingredients are combined and garlic is no longer raw.

Add rice, stirring to combine all the ingredients and separate the grains. Season with white pepper to taste, sugar, if desired, and soy sauce, if rice isn&apos;t salty enough.

Serve with prepared sides as illustrated above.

*As suggested in Thompson&apos;s Thai Street Food , I use just cooked rice, still hot from the cooker, and find that it doesn&apos;t tend stick to the pan and maintains the right consistency. This contrasts with many other fried rice recipes, which suggest using cooked rice that&apos;s been chilled overnight.

click on the image In flipping through photos of my recent trip to Europe, quite possibly one of the most memorable things I consumed there was a cup of Spanish-style hot chocolate at Granja Viader, a more than century old cafe in Barcelona: Luckily the pic at the top of this post does the bulk of the work, because the combination of that fat cloud of whipped cream and the puddle of hot, slightly bitter chocolate is something that can really only be experienced, not explained. In addition to a glass-like crust and a rich texture, the crema catalana had a unique spice flavour that I don&apos;t think any of us was able to identify.

Amazing stuff.

click on the image The area around Bangkok&apos;s Nang Loeng Market is home to lots of old-school restaurants that are ripe for investigation.

One of the oldest-school looking ones is Jib Kee, a restaurant that, for more than 50 years, has specialised in meaty Chinese-Thai dishes such as roast pork and duck: On my first visit I tried their muu krob (หมูกรอบ; shown at the top of this post), roast pork belly, and immediately suspected that it might be one of the best I&apos;ve encountered in Bangkok. The skin is crispy, without being too much so; the fatty bits literally melt away in your mouth; and amazingly, the meat is moist, tender and even perhaps a bit rare - surely an indicator of restraint and skill on their part. The dish is served with a dipping sauce that combines sliced chillies, dark soy and I think, a bit of vinegar.

The remainder of the restaurant&apos;s dishes revolve around duck, and include a decent pet tun (เป็ดตุ๋น), a slightly peppery broth of duck: roast duck (เป็ดย่าง): served over bitter greens in a light five spice-based sauce; and duck intestines (ใส้แก้ว): the latter with little or no flavour of their own, but with a crunchy texture, and served in a slightly salty sauce that included fermented soybeans.

The duck dishes are probably above average, and I suspect they&apos;re what attract the high-ranking military generals who frequent the place every time I&apos;ve been there (a sure-fire sign of a good restaurant in Thailand), but it&apos;s the pork belly that would draw me back here.

click on the image I&apos;m working on yet another piece about obscure Thai dishes for CNNGo&apos;s Bangkok pages . This week I&apos;m eating suki haeng (สุกี้แห้ง), the wok-fried &apos;dry&apos; version of the ubiquitous do-it-yourself hotpot sukiyaki that&apos;s found in just about every shopping centre in Thailand.

Of the handful of suki haeng restaurants I&apos;ve been to so far, a list that includes the famous Elvis Suki , this tiny stall at the side of Thanon Rama IV stands out as my favourite. The proprietor claims to have been making the dish at this location for at least 30 years, and in this time he&apos;s arrived at the combination of flavours and textures that define an excellent version of the dish.

A pork or chicken order here comes with tender, marinated meat, while the seafood version includes squid and shrimp. A dish here is slightly smokey with some nice charred bits, and contains lots of vegetables and egg and a relative minimum of noodles. A squirt of oyster sauce provides the suki with a bit more meaty roundness, and his dipping sauce - the element that can make or break a good suki - is excellent, combining meaty and spicy flavours with lots of garlic.

It&apos;s a very simple dish, as this video illustrates: He begins by heating oil over a high flame, adding to it egg and protein. These are just barely cooked before he adds the veggies (a combination of Napa cabbage, green onions and morning glory), a knot of bean thread, a pinch of sugar and MSG, and a squirt of oyster sauce. A few more turns to bring it all together and the dish is done in less than a minute.

It&apos;d be an easy Thai dish to make at home, the only thing lacking being the nam jim suki (น้ำจิ้มสุกี้), the dipping sauce, which as this video (in Thai only) shows, is a much more complicated dish than I&apos;d realised: If you can&apos;t understand Thai but want to have a go at making the dipping sauce it yourself, the process is pretty self-explanatory, and the ingredients include, in the order she introduces them, water, bottled chili sauce, cilantro/coriander root, garlic, fresh chili, sugar, fish sauce, sesame oil, oyster sauce, salt, lime juice and roasted sesame.

Ideal Map&apos;s Good Eats Rattanakosin map (see details here ) led me to this open-air shophouse near Nang Loeng Market that turned out to do one of the better plates of kaeng karee I&apos;ve come across in Bangkok.

The kaeng karee muu , pork curry (pictured above,) here is spicier than average, but as is the standard, comes served with slices of deep-fried kun chiang , Chinese-style pork sausage, a few slices of cucumber and sliced chilies.

They also do a similar satoo lin muu , a stew of pork tongue, served the same way.

click on the image If I hadn&apos;t been reminded of it by a recent post at EatingAsia , this blog probably would have continued sitting in my Out box.

I spent fewer than 48 hours in Istanbul, but in this short time got the impression that eating takes a distinctly different form there.

Take, for example, the costume and showmanship associated with serving Turkish-style ice cream: or tea: Or the city&apos;s alleged signature dish, balık ekmek , a type of fish sandwich, which, of course, isn&apos;t just a sandwich, but a show performed on rocking boats: The boats, which are moored by the foot of the Galata Bridge on Istanbul&apos;s European side, are floating kitchens where men griddle fillets of a mackerel-like fish and serve them in sandwiches. You pay on the pier and when the wave is right, the sandwich is handed over: Served in a spongy roll with a bit of lettuce and onion, and seasoned with little more than salt and lemon juice, I have to admit that my first balık ekmek was, quite frankly, rather underwhelming as a sandwich.

But eaten at the waterfront, with the view of Asia across the way, and the New Mosque as a backdrop: it seemed to embody that uniquely Istanbul intersection of ceremony and setting, where sometimes taste is only part of the experience.

click on the image Kun chiang (กุนเชียง) is a sweet, dried sausage of Chinese origin. I was never a fan of the stuff, finding it sweet in taste and waxy in texture, until I discovered Tang Kuang Khi Hiang, a shop in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown.

The third-generation owners here claim to do a Hong Kong-style version of the sausage, which to me seems less sweet, slightly less fatty, and not waxy at all. The standard version is made from pork, but they also do a pork liver version and a duck version.

Kun chiang can be fried and used as a side along with Chinese-style kaeng karii , or as the owner suggested, fried and steamed with chicken and ginger. It&apos;s delicious when sliced and thrown into a pot of rice as it steams, or when fried with kai-lan and salt, a dish I had at Yung Kee in Hong Kong . Another popular use for the sausage in Thailand is khao phat kun chiang , rice fried with kun chiang, the video recipe for which can be seen here .

click on the image Tipped off by กินรอบกรุง 2 ( Kin Rob Krung 2 ), a Thai-language food guide based on a television programme, I was recently pointed in the direct of Phat Thai Mae Am, a shophouse restaurant specialising in just two dishes: phat Thai and kuaytiaw khua kai .

It&apos;s exactly the kind of cozy, friendly, informal, tidy, longstanding, florescent-lit Thai restaurant I love the most: And to top it off, Mae Am does what is probably one of the better dishes of phat Thai that I&apos;ve encountered in Bangkok.

The noodles here are seasoned ahead of time with tamarind paste, palm sugar and fish sauce, giving them a pink colour; it&apos;s the old-school way of making phat Thai, I&apos;m told. They&apos;re then fried to order in a small wok, one or two dishes at at a time, with no additional seasoning. This contrasts with most places, which tend to season the dish in the wok, sometimes doing several orders in one go.

Mae Am adds lots of crunchy salted radish, good-quality dried shrimp, fresh shrimp, and if you like, squid. She fries the egg on the side, letting the mixture ignite briefly over the charcoal fire before dishing it up: The result feels almost delicate, and lacks the oily gloopiness of lesser versions of phat Thai - a result of that clever pre-seasoning, I suspect. As is the norm, the dish is served with a small pile of ground peanuts and the usual sides of Chinese chive, bean sprouts, banana flower, lime and pennywort.

Mae Am&apos;s kuaytiaw khua kai, wide rice noodles fried with chicken and egg, is also quite good: It&apos;s slightly smokey - again, from that charcoal flame - and well-seasoned. My only gripe with this (and the phat Thai) would be that, unlike the version at Nay Hong , Mae Am uses vegetable oil, not lard, as her fat of choice.

Saturated fat aside, these are two solid reasons to take the MRT to Khlong Toei come mealtime.

click on the image Little-visited Chanthaburi, located about 250km east of Bangkok, is yet another seriously underrated Thai food destination. The province is seemingly blessed with just about everything that&apos;s great about Thai cuisine: amazing fruit (some of Thailand&apos;s most sought-after durian are grown here), fresh seafood (particularly crabs) and rice (much of which is made into sen jan , the province&apos;s famous rice noodles). I was particularly interested in the local dishes that take advantage of Chanthaburi&apos;s abundant fresh herbs - pepper, cardamom and roots such as lesser ginger and galangal. These ingredients are mashed into coarse pastes that provide the local-style phat phet (spicy stir-fried dishes often employing game; pictured below) with a truly unique spicy/warm/camphor/fragrant punch.

In addition to food, Chanthaburi has an interesting old-school riverside area and a bi-weekly gem market, for which the town is also famous. This wasn&apos;t my first trip to Chan; I was last there almost exactly four years ago . For pics from my most recent trip, push play below.

click on the image Kuaytiaw phat puu , rice noodles fried with a curry paste mixture and crab, is a signature dish of Chanthaburi . Despite this, it&apos;s only available at a couple places in the town, most of which are take-away only.

It took a bit of sleuthing, but I was eventually able to locate a lone stall in the city&apos;s market, and bought a bag: Eating the noodles at a roadside coffee stall, I found them rich and slightly sweet, trailed by a barely-there spiciness. I liked the dish, and thought it had the added benefit of being easy to make for those who don&apos;t have access to obscure Thai ingredients. In searching the internet, I found two alternate versions of the recipe: one in which the crabs and then the curry paste are fried in oil before adding the noodles, and another in which the curry paste and crabs are simmered in coconut cream. I decided to go with the latter. If you can read Thai, the recipe upon which this is based can be seen here (the Thai script can&apos;t be viewed in Firefox for some reason). If you want to keep it authentic, try to find the famous sen chan , rice noodles from Chanthaburi, otherwise any thin rice noodles will do. Kuaytiaw Phat Puu (Chanthaburi-style fried noodles with crab) Large dried chilies, six, soaked in warm water until soft
Shallots, 5, peeled
Garlic, 6 large cloves, peeled
Shrimp paste, about 2 Tbsp

Coconut cream, about 2 cups
Dried thin rice noodles, 250g
Tamarind paste, to taste
Fish sauce and/or salt, to taste
Palm sugar, to taste
Ketchup, to taste
Four swimmer crabs (about 750g), prepared and quartered
Chinese chives, 1 small bunch, chopped into lengths of about 3cm

Lime, sliced
Chinese chives, 2 small bunches
Bean sprouts, about 1 cup
Baby cucumber, four, sliced thinly

Make a curry paste by grinding chilies, shallots, garlic and shrimp paste in a mortar and pestle until fine. Set aside.

Bring coconut milk to a simmer a wok over med-low heat. Add curry paste, stirring to combine. Lower heat slightly, being careful not to allow coconut cream to boil, and simmer until liquid is reduced slightly and mixture is well-combined and fragrant, about 10 to 15 minutes.

While mixture is simmering, soak noodles in water until soft and flexible, about 10 minutes.

Season coconut cream mixture to taste with tamarind paste, fish sauce, sugar and ketchup; it should be somewhat sweet and sour, slightly less salty and spicy. Allow to simmer another 10 minutes or so until the flavours have combined. Add crab and simmer until cooked, another 5 minutes.

Pour mixture, including crab, into a large bowl. Return about 3/4 cup of the liquid back to the wok, followed by about 1/3 of the noodles. Fry, stirring to combine, adding water, if necessary, to prevent the noodles from sticking. The noodles can get pretty gloopy at this point; to avoid this, simply fry smaller portions. When noodles are soft and have absorbed the liquid, add 1/3 of chopped chives 1/3 of crab, stir to combine and serve, accompanied by a slice of lime, a couple stalks of Chinese chive, bean sprouts and sliced cucumber.

click on the image Khao kai op (ข้าวไก่อบ; shown above) is a dish of slices of marinated chicken served over rice. Si Samorn Lert Rot, a restaurant just off Th Convent in Bangkok&apos;s Silom area, claim to have been serving the dish for 50 years - an allegation seemingly backed up by their cool old-school sign: &quot;Op&quot; literally means to bake, but when I asked about their oven, the woman preparing the dish at Si Samorn replied that the meat was in fact deep-fried. &quot;I don&apos;t know why they call it that,&quot; she added. Regardless, the chicken is expertly &quot;baked&quot; in a wok of hot oil until tender and moist. It&apos;s then sliced and served over rice and topped with a rich, oily and extremely garlicky sauce. It&apos;s a simple, satisfying dish, and this is allegedly one of the more famous places in Bangkok to eat it.

The meat is also available over noodles. I had the pork - also deep-fried, and also well-seasoned and tender - with thin rice noodles and a dollop of the previously-mentioned sauce: Good, but it didn&apos;t quite come together as well as the rice version.

Highly recommended.

click on the image Khao tom (ข้าวต้ม), rice soup, typically supplemented with some sort of fancy protein, is a dish that Chinese Thais take very seriously. Folks will pay the equivalent of US$9 for a bowl of the stuff, and vendors selling the dish are found just about everywhere in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. Despite its fame, there are a lot of mediocre bowls out there, but thanks to my friend Y (who also led me to Sisamorn ), I was pointed in the direction of one of the better ones.

The entire kitchen at Tang Ngee Huat, a Chinatown shophouse restaurant, is little more than a small countertop: This is where they assemble two versions of the dish: khao tom pet , rice soup served with duck, and khao tom kaphoh muu , with pig stomach. The owners claim that the restaurant has been serving these dishes for 63 years, following a Teochew recipe brought to Thailand by the previous generation.

Unlike most versions of the dish, which set out to impress with generous portions of fresh seafood, the star here is the broth. It&apos;s pleasantly salty and slightly peppery, with just enough deep-fried garlic so you know it&apos;s there, and satisfyingly crunchy bits of preserved vegetable. The bowl shown above is khao tom ruam , which includes duck, duck blood and pig stomach. The meat is minimal but exceedingly tender, and the odd combination somehow works.

click on the image For the last 30 years, Pa Jin has been selling cooked cockles and mussels from a stall on a busy street in the centre of Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown.

The relatively expensive price of 100B (about US$3) per plate belies the fact that you&apos;re sitting on a stool sucking car exhaust, but her unique cooking technique and good-quality raw ingredients make it worth it.

Rather than steam them, Pa Jin dips the cockles into a medium-sized pot of boiling water until they&apos;re just about to open - probably no more than 15 seconds. She then meticulously pries each one open by hand. The barely-cooked meat that emerges is tender and velvety, lacking the rubberiness of overcooked shellfish. The mussels, which have been pre-boiled, are also pretty good, and to order are briefly submerged in the same water.

Both are served with three kinds of dipping sauces (one order of dipping sauce is &apos;single&apos;, two is &apos;in love&apos; and three is &apos;family&apos;) that run the gamut from tart/spicy to sweet. And of course, Pa Jin has a website and a &apos;Call Center&apos;, the latter ostensibly for urgent cockle-related issues and/or emergencies. Pa Jin Th Phadung Dao, Bangkok

click on the image At the risk of repeating the previous post, I apologise for the lack of blogging over the last couple months... I&apos;m currently finishing work on a very large guidebook project, and if you haven&apos;t already noticed, I&apos;ve also been preoccupied with revamping this website -- if you read this blog via RSS, be sure to go directly to my homepage to check out the new look. Stick around for a bit and look at my portfolios, which I&apos;ve updated with new images.

But I have been eating -- most recently, at nahm. I&apos;ve mentioned this upscale Thai restaurant previously , but it&apos;s only in the last month or so that they&apos;ve started serving lunch, and a couple days ago I stopped by to investigate.

Lunch at nahm takes the form of a reduced menu of the usual curries, salads, soups and stir-fries you&apos;d find at dinner, but Chef David&apos;s real pride and joy is the khanom jeen , fresh noodles made from rice and topped with various curries. On my most recent visit, I had green curry with freshwater fish dumplings (pictured above), which also comes served with some delicious dried beef ( nuea daet diaw made from Wagyu beef -- easily the best version of the dish I&apos;ve encountered) and deep-fried fish. Other curries are available, including a rich and slightly sweet prawn curry, and at the opposite end of the spectrum, the fiery fish innard curry, which has long been one of my favourite dishes at nahm. At 800B, it&apos;s almost certainly the most expensive khanom jeen in town, but the dish comes as a part of a set, which also includes three canapes and a dessert. nahm Metropolitan Hotel, 27 Th Sathon Tai

click on the image Every January for the last four years, I&apos;ve spent the month up in the northern Thai province of Mae Hong Son. Unfortunately, this year, I&apos;ve just had too much work and was forced to camp out here in Bangkok. As a result, I&apos;m really missing northern Thai food. That&apos;s why I was excited when I stumbled upon a review of Gedhawa , a previously unknown-to-me northern Thai restaurant, in local listings mag BK.

Gedhawa is located off Th Sukhumvit, sports a somewhat cheesy Lanna-style interior and appears to be frequented almost exclusively by Japanese customers -- all factors that don&apos;t exactly work in the restaurant&apos;s favour. The menu spans just about all of Thailand, but there&apos;s an expansive northern Thai section, and this is what I was interested in. On my first visit, I ate, starting at the left of the image above, a soup of phak waan (ผักหวาน; a type of vegetable) with dried fish and tomatoes, a somewhat obscure but delicious northern Thai dish; nam phrik ong (น้ำพริกอ่อง), the famous northern-style dip of ground pork and tomatoes; naem (แหนม; fermented pork sausage) wrapped in banana leaf with egg and pickled garlic and grilled; and the famous northern-style fried laap .

The flavours were mostly there: the soup had the smokey flavour of dried fish, the dip was rich and meaty, and the laap had more than just a whiff of makhwaen (a unique dried spice used in northern-style laap). But ultimately, the meal reminded me of most other regional Thai meals I&apos;ve had in Bangkok: the dishes looked the way they should, but the food lacked nuance and soul. Worse than that, they got a couple things wrong at Gedhawa: nam phrik ong is usually served with fresh, not par-boiled veggies, and real northern-style laap contains blood and offal.

On a second visit, I was keen to try their northern Thai noodle dishes . A truly good version of khao soi (ข้าวซอย; pictured at the top of this post), the famous curry noodle dish, is even hard to find up in northern Thailand, and Gedhawa&apos;s version was no exception. The broth was thin and bland and tasted mostly of curry powder. Slightly better was their version of khanom jeen nam ngiaw (ขนมจีนน้ำเงี้ยว): a rich pork and tomato broth served over fresh rice noodles.

Consider Gedhawa if you&apos;re looking for a crash course in northern Thai dining, but look elsewhere if you&apos;re already familiar with the food and, like me, are craving something authentic.

click on the image I couldn&apos;t swing an entire month this time around, but I&apos;ve managed to squeeze in about nine days up in my favourite place in Thailand, the northwestern province of Mae Hong Son.

I&apos;ve spent a lot of time up here, and I&apos;ve been visiting the area since 1998,  so I&apos;m pretty familiar with the city&apos;s restaurants and stalls. I love the food in Mae Hong Son, but it&apos;s a small town, and the options are limited.

Perhaps in an conscious effort to avoid ordering the same old dishes, on a recent visit to Baan Phleng , we ordered luu , a dish of raw blood that I&apos;ve previously described here . It&apos;s an intimidating dish -- perhaps the most so in all of Thailand -- and if you smile while you&apos;re eating it, you look like a murderous carnivore. But luu is actually relatively subtle in terms of flavour, and boasts a touch of chili heat coupled with the unique dried spice notes that characterise northern-stye laap . And as far as I&apos;m aware, all of the people who sampled the luu pictured above are still alive and healthy.

Baan Phleng is probably Mae Hong Son&apos;s best all-around restaurant, and serves a wide spread of mostly blood-free Thai Yai/Shan-style and northern Thai style dishes.

click on the image Chay Thung, somewhat unceremoniously, translates as &apos;At the Edge of the Fields&apos;, which given the views provided by Mae Hong Song&apos;s rice fields in late January: is almost self-deprecating in its understatement.

The restaurant serves a good spread of Isan/northeastern Thai-style dishes, but the house specialty is kai op faang (ไก่อบฟาง), literally &apos;chicken baked over hay&apos;. Ovens are unknown in rural Thailand, and instead the chicken is &apos;baked&apos; in a clever contraption fashioned from two items one would normally throw away. To make the dish, a whole chicken, which has been seasoned with fish sauce, MSG and garlic, is inserted, upright, on a bottle filled with water. The &apos;oven&apos;, actually an empty metal oil can, is dropped over the bird, and the whole lot is covered with a huge mound of hay (actually dried rice stalks).

The hay is lit on fire: and initially, there&apos;s a huge flame: which burns away within a couple minutes, leaving a pile of very hot ashes. After about 20 minutes, virtually all that&apos;s left is a hot metal box encasing a smokey and tender &apos;baked&apos; chicken: While this is going on, the feet, head, neck and gizzards are made into a deliciously rich broth, which is seasoned with lemongrass, black pepper and turmeric.

Eaten with sticky rice and the restaurant&apos;s excellent som tam (green papaya salad), the meal (pictured at the top of this post) is quite possibly the most satisfying chicken dish I&apos;ve encountered in Thailand over the last few years.

Part of the dish&apos;s success can be traced back to its unique cooking method, but in my opinion, this is a dish in which the ingredients also play a crucial role: the chicken used at Chay Thung is kai baan , scrawny free-range birds with rich flesh that tends to cook up somewhere between slightly moist and almost dry, and which inevitably have lots of fatty skin. A breast-heavy Western-style chicken would most likely dry out, and would not have that satisfying intersection of almost equal parts verging-on-dry-but-still-tender meat and crispy, fatty skin.

On  subsequent visit, I had Chay Thung&apos;s excellent laap pet (duck &apos;salad&apos;): rich, spicy and tart, and served with delicious raw vegetables and herbs grown in the fields that surround the restaurant.

A must-visit restaurant, if you&apos;re in the area.

click on the image Khang pong , crispy fritters made from shredded and battered green papaya, or sometimes shallots, are one of the more ubiquitous snacks in Mae Hong Son. The dish is sold at several stalls in the town&apos;s morning market as well as from roadside stalls in the countryside. But my favourite version is sold by one particular vendor at the city&apos;s walking street market: I’ve been buying khang pong from this woman for years, and on my most recent visit, mentioned to her that my friend, a restaurateur in the US, was so taken with the dish that he decided to make a version of it at his restaurant (for a description of this, go here ). ‘Tell him he can come by and ask for the recipe,’ she said without hesitation. ‘I won’t charge anything!’

She went on to describe that khang is Shan/Thai Yai for pan, and pong means golden: While most khang pong are served as a crispy side to noodle dishes, hers are excellent on their own as a snack. Also unlike the version sold around town, hers are somewhat spicy, and come liberally seasoned with citrusy bits of lemongrass, turmeric and dried chili. Another difference is that unlike most vendors, who deep-fry khang pong, she pan fries hers, making them dense and somewhat heavy -- almost like a savoury cookie.

If you&apos;re interested in making the dish, the below is the translation of a recipe from สูตรอาหารและขนมไต, Tai Recipes and Sweets , a cookbook assembled by a Mae Hong Son community group. I&apos;ve made a few dishes from the book, including this one, and the proportions aren&apos;t always exact, so if you&apos;re going to have a go, be sure to employ a bit of cooking experience and intuition.

Khang Pong/ข่างปอง (Thai Yai-Style Battered and Deep-Fried Papaya)

Green papaya, 1kg
Lemongrass, 5 stalks
Shrimp paste, 1 Tbsp
Shallots, 5
Garlic, 3 heads
Salt, 1 Tbsp
Turmeric, 1 tsp
MSG, 1 tsp
Rice flour, 1 bag [an average bag contains 450g]
Sticky rice flour, 1/4 bag

Oil for frying

Peel papaya, rinse with water. Cut into bite-sized strips.

In a mortar and pestle, combine lemongrass, shrimp paste, shallots, garlic, salt and MSG. Grind until you have a fine paste.

Combine papaya, spice mixture, flours and add water until you have a thick batter.

Shaping mixture into small rounds, fry until crispy and golden.

click on the image Issaya Siamese club is the first domestic outlet serving Thai food of Bangkok-born chef, Ian Kittichai. As the story goes, Chef Ian started cooking as a child, selling food from a cart along the streets of Bangkok, before eventually going on to helm the Four Seasons Bangkok, and later, Kittichai , in New York City.

His most recent restaurant (Issaya) is housed in a charming 1920s-era villa that has been playfully designed by a Danish interior designer. There&apos;s a small organic garden out back, lots of lounge-like cozy corners (the Siamese Club part) and in the evenings, lawn seating on comfy-looking cloth chairs.

The restaurant&apos;s relatively short menu, referred to as the chef&apos;s Childhood Menu, claims to be a collection of &apos;Favourite dishes from Chef Ian&apos;s Childhood&apos;. A review in local listings mag BK mentioned that one of these dishes is Gaeng hung lay, the restaurant&apos;s take on kaeng hang lay , a northern-style curry of pork belly. This might very well be the one Thai dish I&apos;ve cooked and consumed more than any other, and I was curious to see how the restaurant did it: Like the dishes that followed it, there seemed to be a distinct emphasis on presentation, and by Thai standards at least, serves were huge. The hang lay had the requisite pork belly and hints of dried spice, but these were nearly lost in the curry&apos;s overwhelming richness and oiliness. Kaeng hang lay is indeed a rich and oily dish, but usually this is countered by the addition of a few tablespoons of tart tamarind extract, as well as acidic slivers of ginger and small cloves of garlic. Instead, Issaya&apos;s version was served with a large chunk of taro and a couple slices of lotus root. These additions are novel (although in Mae Hong Son they do a dish called aloo hang lay , hang lay served with potatoes), yet did little to bring balance to the dish, and instead seemed to make it even heavier.

The waiter recommended the Chili glazed baby back ribs: which arrived on a smoking Thai-style grill. They were smokey, crispy and tender, but despite Asian-inspired ingredients in the glaze, the dish had more in common with American-style barbecue than anything with origins in Southeast Asia. It was a satisfying -- if somewhat out of place -- dish, but was this really something from the chef&apos;s childhood in Bangkok?

In an effort to counter the meatiness, we ordered banana blossom salad (pictured at the top of this post). I didn&apos;t even recognise the dish when it arrived, which wouldn&apos;t be so bad if I hadn&apos;t also failed to recognise its flavours. The salad lacked that crucial intersection of astringency, sweetness, spiciness and coconut milk creaminess, and like the other dishes, seemed to be drowning in an overbearing sauce.

For dessert, we chose the restaurant&apos;s take on khanom kho , a Thai sweet I&apos;ve encountered previously in the southern Thai provinces of Songkhla and Pattani . The traditional version of the dish takes the form of tiny and almost impossibly light pillows of dough enveloping a crunchy core of sugarcane. Issaya&apos;s version took the form of  large and rather tough Japanese-style moji encasing sesame ice cream: Again, the presentation was unique, and on the surface at least, the dish sort of resembled khanom kho, but given the wholesale lack of the original dish&apos;s defining elements (delicacy, lightness, softness), why not just call it something else?

On a subsequent visit, I tried the restaurant&apos;s street food set, which combined grilled chicken, papaya salad and sticky rice: The grilled chicken took the form of skinless, boneless breast and/or thighs grilled and served in a marinade that combined lots of coconut milk and turmeric, but none of the spicy peppery, savoury flavours of coriander root, white pepper garlic or even salt -- ingredients one would usually encounter in this dish. It seemed more like a clumsy stab at Malaysian food than any Thai street food I&apos;d ever encountered. The papaya salad was unexceptional, and because the restaurant was out of sticky rice, I was given regular rice.

Both experiences were underwhelming, but perhaps the fault was in my ordering? On my first visit, and following the waiter&apos;s suggestion, we ended up with three rather meaty and saucy dishes -- hardly a balanced Thai meal. But after a second visit, I suspect that my ultimate mistake was in expecting Thai food. Given Chef Ian&apos;s experience and success in the US, the emphasis on presentation, the huge serves, and the general meatiness and sauciness, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder, Could Issaya Siamese Club be an example of a chef bringing Thai-American restaurant food to Bangkok?

click on the image It&apos;s my favourite kind of culinary discovery: an old-school restaurant that&apos;s new to me.

Guided by Ideal Map&apos;s Good Eats: Rattanakosin , a food-based map to Bangkok, I was recently pointed in the direction of Dee Mee Phochana, decades-old restaurant located in an even older neighbourhood.

Dee Mee is your classic Bangkok-style khao tom restaurant, serving a variety of prepared Thai-Chinese-style dishes. Just point at whatever looks good, and a few small plates will be brought to your table, to be accompanied by regular rice or a watery bowl of rice soup.

I went for a combo of khaa muu , braised pork leg, and tao huu phalo , tofu braised in Chinese spices, as well as a unique dish of fish served with pickled vegetables: The phalo was a pleasant surprise, and turned out to be one of the better versions of the dish I&apos;ve encountered in a while. Many versions of this dish can be cloyingly sweet, but the sweetness here was subtle, and was accentuated by spices such as cinnamon and clove, not more sugar.  The pork leg was tender, with similar flavours, and both were accompanied by a tart, spicy, garlicky dipping sauce. The fish dish was one I hadn&apos;t encountered previously, and combined tasty braised freshwater fish, crunchy chunks of pickled mustard green and a &apos;red broth&apos; ( nam daeng ) that brought it all together.

click on the image This may come as a surprise to people who&apos;ve been reading this blog for a while, but I&apos;d wager that Malaysia is the best eating destination in Southeast Asia. I love Thai food, but having lived in Thailand a long time now, I&apos;ve always been secretly jealous of Malaysia&apos;s variety: regional Chinese, Indian, and of course, Malaysian cuisines are available just about everywhere there. Food in Malaysia generally isn&apos;t super sweet -- a flavour the Thais love, but one I&apos;m not so hot about. And Malaysia seems to have a disproportionate amount of the type of stuck-in-time old-school restaurants that one really has to work hard to find in Thailand.

So I&apos;m very happy to be back.

My main reason for being in Malaysia is to begin work on Lonely Planet&apos;s Malaysia, Singapore&amp;Brunei , but I spent my first several days in country in Kuala Lumpur, doing a photo shoot. The running around didn&apos;t leave me time to do to much exploration, but I was still able to eat well, and hit now-familiar EatingAsia faves Yut Kee , Bakti Woodlands and Sek Yuen , not to mention LP-recommended places including Jalan Alor and Imbi Market: But my most memorable meal in KL was probably at Vishalatchi Food&amp;Catering, a southern Indian restaurant suggested by Jarrett : Unlike most southern Indian places I&apos;ve encountered in KL, this place is not vegetarian, and in fact sold one of the best versions of mutton biryani I&apos;ve encountered in a long time: Served with short-grain rice that&apos;s fragrant but not over-seasoned with dried spices, a hard-boiled egg and fall-apart tender mutton (not to mention the tasty all-you-can-eat vegetable-based sides), on a banana leaf on a long communal table, in a hall-like room with the music and noise spilling over from a ceremony at an adjacent Hindu temple, it was much an experience as it was a meal.

My next destination is Penang, where I have plans to meet up with some locally-based bloggers and food experts, and most likely, experience even more excellent Malaysian food.

click on the image The dish I was probably looking the most forward to eating in Malaysia is rojak, a type of fruit salad with a thick, intense dressing that practically screams Southeast Asia. I didn&apos;t come across any in KL, but from previous trips to Penang, I knew that I needed to head for Georgetown&apos;s busy Gurney Driver hawker market: There, Ah Chye, a lauded and busy stall, does the Penang version of the dish, which I&apos;ve been told is particular about the inclusion of rose apples (the tiny pink kind known in Thai as mamiaw ) and squid. Ah Chye&apos;s rojak also has crunchy guava, jicama and cucumber, bits of crispy deep-fried dough, sweet mangoes and tart chunks of pineapple. These disparate ingredients come together with the help of a virtually mud-thick sweet/fishy/sour/spicy dressing made from shrimp paste and sugar (Ah Chye&apos;s dressing is so popular, it&apos;s available in take-away tubs). And as if there wasn&apos;t already enough going on, the dish is garnished with ground peanuts and sesame.

Excellent, but I want more. Penangites/Georgetownians: Where do you like to get your rojak on?

click on the image I&apos;ve spent the last few nights in a hotel on Lebuh Kimberley. I wasn&apos;t previously too familiar with this corner of Georgetown, but it&apos;s turned out to be a great place to stay, as there&apos;s a lot of interesting stuff to eat just steps from my door: Goh Huat Seng, an old-school Chinese restaurant next door, comes recommended by Bee and is virtually full every night; there&apos;s a busy morning market one block away; there&apos;s a promising-looking char kuay teow vendor just down the block; and next door to my hotel, a busy and allegedly renowned vendor selling duck koay chiap. I was tipped off to the latter dish via a recommendation from food writer CK Lam in the guidebook I&apos;m updating. But upon reading it, I did a double take, because in Thailand -- at least as far as I&apos;m aware -- kuay jap , as the Thai version is known, is made exclusively with pork (for more on the Thai version, go here ).

The dish is prepared by friendly and rather portly family: and appears to be very popular, with the open-air shophouse &apos;dining room&apos; full of diners virtually every time I&apos;ve walked by.

I expected the dish to be sweet -- duck dishes in Thailand usually are -- but it was predominately rich and meaty, with a slight peppery spiciness that reminded me of the Thai version, and just a hint of &apos;sweet&apos; spice (cinnamon, star anise, clove, etc.). I asked for a &apos;mixed&apos; bowl, which included duck intestines and other offal, eggs, tender duck meat and a generous amount of duck fat. Like the Thai version, the dish was served with wide rice noodles that resemble tiny carpet rolls; as illustrated in CK Lam&apos;s blog , the noodles are still made by the proprietor himself. Unlike Thai kuay jap, a bowl is served with spicy/sour dipping sauce made from fresh chilies.

I&apos;d be curious to learn more about this dish: Is it Hokkien in origin? Teochew? Do Chinese-Malaysians do a pork version?

click on the image By day, Sup Hameed is a rather bleak nasi kandar restaurant (more on this type of Malaysian restaurant later). Come night, they set out tables and a cart with several huge pots of sup -- rich, meat-based Malaysian soups.

My favourite is sup kambing, goat soup (pictured above), but Hameed&apos;s oxtail soup is also good. They also do a quail version, in which the whole birds are added to a bowl of broth. Regardless of the protein, other than some subtle dried spices, a bit of turmeric and a pinch of deep-fried crispy shallots, the predominate flavour here is meat. This contrasts with the Thai version of the dish -- the nearest equivalent being the Thai-Muslim sup haang wu a, oxtail soup -- which is generally mouth-puckeringly sour, most likely the result of the Thai desire to pack every flavour possible into a dish.

The dish is served on its own or with a couple slices of white bread. If you need more flavours, try Sup Hamid&apos;s teh halia, ginger tea: it&apos;s sweet enough to be dessert.

click on the image I&apos;d been told by Bee and others that the rojak at the Esplanade hawker centre was worth investigating. I went there two times, but no rojak. In fact, despite how much I&apos;ve been raving about the food on Penang, eateries being closed has been a theme of my time here. Vague opening hours, no-show vendors and inexplicable closures have seemingly been working against me, and I&apos;ve probably only been successful in visiting half of the restaurants/stalls/vendors recommended to me.

But on my third visit there was rojak, and man was I glad I hadn&apos;t given up.

Rather than mix the fruit and dressing together in a bowl, as most vendors seem to do, the dressing at Ho Wei Jeng is simply drizzled over the bite-sized chunks of cucumber, guava, rose apple, jicama, pineapple and sour mango (no squid or deep-fried dough here). I&apos;m generally not a huge fan of sweet flavours, but the pleasantly sugary -- almost chocolate-like -- dressing here was amazing, and I didn&apos;t miss the shrimpy savoriness that seems to dominate most versions I&apos;ve tried .

click on the image On the one hand, wrapping my head around Penang&apos;s food has been easy: it&apos;s ubiquitous and delicious. On the other hand, the disparate blend of cuisines that have come to define the island&apos;s food -- Hokkien, Cantonese, Hainanese, Teo Chew, Indian, Malaysian, English, Peranakan -- is somewhat more complicated. Luckily, there&apos;s a great resource. Pointed in the right direction by Robyn , I picked up a copy of Penang Heritage Food , written by a native of Penang, Ong Jin Teong.

Teong lives in Singapore, but was in Penang during my visit, and I got the chance to meet him and talk about the food of Penang and about his book. I mentioned the fact that his book seemed very personal, and he told me that most of the recipes came from his mother. He explained that she used to give cooking demonstrations, and in doing so, recorded many of her recipes. It&apos;s these dishes, via a great deal of trial and error, that eventually became his book. Adding to the personal feel are the family photos, and amazingly, even a few old photos of the food vendors and hawkers his family used to be fond of, interspersed with the recipes.

We also had a couple meals together, but as mentioned previously , had bad luck with restaurants and hawkers being unexpectedly closed. Luckily, the delicious Hokkien mee vendor in Pulau Tikus was open, and I was able to score one of their last bowls -- this at about 9AM: Otherwise, we were forced to try a few new places (or at least places new to us), not many of which were so great. But some were interesting.

At a Hainanese restaurant in Georgetown&apos;s Little India, we sat down to a lunch of chicken chop (pictured at the top of this post). Teong explained that in the past, Chinese who emigrated from the island of Hainan were the cooks of choice for wealthy colonial families. Later, they took their experience in the food industry and worked as professional restaurant cooks and opened restaurants. In doing so, they continued to make many of the quasi-Anglo dishes -- chicken chop, curry puff, min chee, macaroni pie, chicken pie -- they had cooked previously. These dishes can still be found at a handful of Hainanese restaurants in Georgetown, many of them served with Worcestershire sauce as a condiment.

Compared to Hokkien mee, I can&apos;t say that the chicken chop could compete in flavour, but the fact that both of these disparate dishes have been available here for decades, and are considered part of  Penang&apos;s cuisine, is fascinating.

click on the image It being a predominately Chinese town, noodles are just about everywhere in Georgetown. In particular, I fell for the city&apos;s fried noodles -- a dish I don’t eat too often in Thailand -- and two types stand out in my mind.

Char koay teow gets my vote for Malaysia’s -- if not Asia’s -- tastiest fried noodle dish. It combines koay teow, flat rice noodles, with thin slices of Chinese sausage, cockles, prawns, egg and bean sprouts: The dish is seasoned with soy sauce and a paste made from dried chili -- no sugar here. Some fry the noodles with vegetable oil, although many still fry with lard; one famous vendor’s mise en place includes a huge bucket of the stuff: View Thai Eats in a larger map Allegedly she’ll throw a few chunks of crispy pork fat into the mix upon request.

The dish is rich, oily, a bit spicy and if, like the vendor pictured at the top of this post, fried over charcoal, smoky. Char koay teow is available all over Georgetown and although there are a few ‘famous’ vendors, it’s pretty much tasty wherever you eat it. View Thai Eats in a larger map Penang Heritage Food and Rasa Malaysia both include recipes for char koay teow.

The other Malaysian fried noodle dish that I couldn&apos;t get enough of is mee goreng. It’s an interesting dish, in that it employs Chinese-style ingredients (noodles, beansprouts, tofu), but is predominately made by Muslims of Indian heritage. These ingredients are fried with potatoes, deep-fried bits and egg. It’s generally quite rich and heavy, though despite the dark red colour of the dressing, relatively mild in flavour. This streetside vendor’s version bordered on bland: View Thai Eats in a larger map while this vendor’s version, sold near the Pulau Tikus Market, was just a bit spicy, and included lots of crispy deep-fried shallots: View Thai Eats in a larger map EatingAsia led me to yet another vendor’s version, which is topped with slices of squid cooked in a slightly spicy sambal: View Thai Eats in a larger map Recipes for the mee goreng can also be found in Penang Heritage Food and at Rasa Malaysia .

click on the image If you follow Asian cooking websites, you&apos;re most likely already familiar with Rasa Malaysia , maintained by native of Penang, Bee Yinn Low. In fact, Bee and I started our respective blogs around the same time, and early on, she used to write me with questions about basic camera skills and Photoshop technique. Today, her website gets a bazillion hits a day and she&apos;s even written and photographed a best-selling book . This obsession with food appears to be a family thing, as her brother, CK, although he hasn&apos;t got into the blogging game, conducts food-based tours of Penang. With the kind help of these two more-than-capable guides, I was escorted around the restaurants, stalls, hakwer centres, factories, shops and farms of George Town and Penang. It was a virtual crash-course in Malaysian food, and as we ate at more places than I have space to go into here, I thought I&apos;d share some of the highlights.

On our first morning we met at the busy morning market at Pulau Tikus, just east of George Town. There, we tried a whole lot of tasty stuff, but perhaps the most interesting to me were the dishes prepared by two friendly vendors selling Nyonya food: Nyonya is a blend of Chinese and Southeast Asian cooking styles and ingredients and is a cuisine I&apos;d read about, but hadn&apos;t yet tried myself. At one stall I tasted the famous curry kapitan (a rich chicken curry using coconut milk), a seriously tasty nasi ulam (a rice &apos;salad&apos; similar to the southern Thai khao yam ) and perut ikan (a thick soup using salted fish kidney -- tai plaa in Thai) -- dishes which seemed to vary in flavour between rich/salty and tart/herbal. I particularly liked one vendor&apos;s gulai kiam hu kut, a rich curry that gets its salty flavour from fish bone. After tasting dishes at a few more stalls, we grabbed a table and Bee snagged a couple packets of rempah udang, an amazing Nyonya snack of grilled sticky rice surrounding a savoury, spicy (think pepper and coriander) and shrimpy centre: Moments later, a bowl of curry mee arrived: Like  other versions, the bowl held both rice and egg noodles, soft tofu, blood, cockles and shrimp, but this vendor&apos;s version was among the spiciest dishes I&apos;d encountered on Penang. CK explained that the shop&apos;s broth is actually relatively bland, and the dish gets its spice and smoke from a generous dollop of chili paste, added at the last minute: Every good breakfast needs a dessert, so naturally we spent the remainder of our time at the market eating sweet stuff, including apom, a type of sweet pancake, from this cheeky vendor: Pulau Tikus Market
Jalan Burma, Georgetown, Penang View Thai Eats in a larger map In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by nearly all of the sweets I encountered on Penang, as they weren&apos;t nearly as sugary as their Thai counterparts. In particular, George Town seemed to have a variety of slightly sweet pancake-like dishes such as apom balik, a soft, eggy, a slightly sweet Nyonya pancake filled with sliced banana or corn: Apom Chooi

But it was really the savoury stuff I enjoyed the most. CK took me to Thin Seng Sauce Factory, a 100 year-old soy sauce factory in the middle of Georgetown: We were offered a taste directly from the vats, and far from being just salty, the soy sauce was virtually meaty, with just a touch of sweet: Thin Seng Sauce Factory

A bowl here combines tender and delicious fish dumplings made on-site by hand, a rich duck-based broth, and to bring it all together, a splash of pork fat and crispy garlic. Quite possibly one of the standout bowls of noodles I&apos;ve encountered in Southeast Asia.

click on the image I&apos;ve been on the road a lot lately -- Malaysia, Australia and Malaysia again -- and although the eating&apos;s been great, there are moments when I have missed Thai food. Luckily, during these brief stints at home I&apos;ve come across a couple new places (new to me, at least) that have tided me over, and are worth sharing. Khao phat pu (ข้าวผัดปู; fried rice with crab) and kraphoh plaa (กระเพาะปลา; a soup of fish bladder) are two dishes that are usually associated with touristy seafood palaces or flashy restaurants in Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown. As such, they can also be quite expensive, yet often, not that great. Luckily there&apos;s a cheap and tasty alternative on Th Tanao, an atmospheric street in old Bangkok with lots of low-key great eats.

The fried rice (pictured at the top of this post) at this no-name stall is slightly smokey and well-seasoned, and is packed with a generous amount of fresh crab. It&apos;s also not oily or clumpy, and at 60B (about US$2), is a steal. I&apos;m usually not a fan of kraphoh plaa -- the somewhat slimy texture of the broth tends to put me off -- but the version here was rich and tasty, if a bit thin, and included lots of fresh crab. I wouldn&apos;t cross town for this dish alone, but for the both of them -- particularly if I&apos;ve been away -- it&apos;s a no brainer.

click on the image Lots of people come to Thailand with visions of extravagant seafood meals. And the country&apos;s seafood dishes are generally pretty tasty and satisfying. But having eaten a lot of these meals over the last decade, I have to admit that I&apos;ve grown increasingly disillusioned. The low point probably came last summer, after I got back from my first visit to Barcelona, a place where I can honestly say that I really tasted seafood for the first time. After that trip, I finally began to realise what was wrong with much of the seafood in Thailand, specifically, the fact that it never tastes like much.

Much of Thailand&apos;s seafood is farmed and the emphasis tends to be on quantity over quality -- think huge but tasteless farm-raised prawns, the American chicken breast of seafood. To give the seafood dishes flavour, many Thai seafood restaurants compensate by serving dishes with heaps of lime juice and chili or bottled sauces. The inherent flavour of the seafood -- if indeed there was any -- never had a chance.

But occasionally one encounters a place in Thailand where the seafood is good and better yet, they treat it with respect.

Ruea Lae Le takes some effort to reach: it&apos;s located about 60km from Bangkok, nearly straddling the border between Phetchaburi and Samut Songkhram. And when you finally get there, it will most likely be something of a letdown: the current dining room is a wonky open-air raft, next door to which the new dining room -- a shockingly horrendous concrete &apos;boat&apos; -- is being constructed: Yet despite the questionable aesthetics, I can&apos;t say that I&apos;ve been to a better seafood-based restaurant in the Bangkok area.

Returning to the restaurant for the second time, we again ordered the restaurant&apos;s simple but tasty hoy malaengphu op (หอยแมลงภู่อบ), mussels steamed with Thai herbs: The medium-sized mussels are steamed in lidded pots with a bit of broth, galangal and lemongrass until just cooked. This leaves them tender, and with the relatively light seasoning (relatively speaking -- this is, after all, Thailand), actually tasting like mussels. (Alternatively, you can dip them in the restaurant&apos;s excellent spicy/tart Thai-style seafood dipping sauce -- I did, and this was tasty as well.)

Another re-run was kaeng khua pu bai chakhram (แกงค่ัวปูใบชะความ), a coconut milk curry with crab and chakhram , an aquatic vegetable associated with Samut Songkhram that Dylan told me is known in English as samphire : Kaeng khua is a popular vehicle for seafood, but more often than not, it is as bland and insipid as the fish it&apos;s meant to carry. Ruea Lae Le&apos;s version has a wonderful balance of herbal spice and coconut creaminess, not to mention lots of fatty (literally -- there were chunks of bright red crab fat floating in the dish), meaty crab and crunchy samphire. An awesome dish.

Hoy siap phat chaa (หอยเสียบผัดฉ่า), briny little razor clams fried with Thai herbs (garlic, fresh peppercorns, chili, lime leaf) was one of my favourite dishes of the meal: I&apos;d been on the lookout for a good version of this simple dish for the last few months, yet had been let down several times. The version here is pretty much exactly what I&apos;d been looking for: spicy, pleasantly oily, herbal and including good-quality shellfish, although I was a bit disappointed that it didn&apos;t include thin slivers of krachai (Chinese key).

The only dish I didn&apos;t care for on this visit was tom som pla duk thale (ต้มส้มปลาดุกทะเล), a soup with saltwater catfish: The fish was tasty, but the broth, which is seasoned with slivers of young ginger and tamarind, was far too sweet for my taste.

If you&apos;re feeling cholesterol deficient, they also do a great pla muek phat khai khem , thick rings of squid fried with the yolk of salted duck eggs -- a dish encountered on my first visit.

As evidenced from the view from the Ruea Lae Le: one of fish and shellfish farms extending to the horizon, the restaurant is no doubt using some farmed seafood. But the seafood here had flavour and was prepared in a way that allowed these tastes to come through. It&apos;s not quite Barcelona, but for Thailand, it&apos;s not that far off.

click on the image Patpong, Bangkok&apos;s famous red-light district, is not the most likely destination for good Thai food. Sanitation issues aside, many of the strip&apos;s restaurants, with names like Madrid and Mizu&apos;s Kitchen, are holdouts from the Vietnam War era, and offer an interesting glimpse into the Bangkok of the 1960s and &apos;70s: but continue to serve the same quasi-Western food menus they have for decades.

Yet there are exceptions.

Specifically, every Thursday at lunch, the longstanding restaurant Derby King serves bowls of khao soi , the famous northern Thai curry noodle soup (thanks, Nikky G, for the heads-up). It&apos;s hard to find a good bowl of khao soi even up north, so I was skeptical, but on a recent day, gave it a try.

Derby King&apos;s khao soi comes served with beef, chicken and less traditionally, pork, and seemingly different broths for each. I went with beef, which wasn&apos;t as rich as some of the better versions in Chiang Mai, but that was made with a curry paste that seemed to compensate with lots of garlic and aromatic dried spice. Flat khao soi noodles are virtually non-existent in Bangkok, so the restaurant used the standard round egg-and-wheat bamee noodles. It&apos;s not the most amazing khao soi in Thailand, but it&apos;s solid and satisfying, and with Lamyai having closed and Lam Duan Fah Ham being too far for most people, it&apos;s probably one of the better bowls you&apos;re going to get in central Bangkok.

Derby King also do excellent deep-fried spring rolls -- meaty, crispy and full of flavour -- that are easily the best I&apos;ve encountered in Bangkok.

Derby King&apos;s khao soi is popular, and you&apos;ll most likely have to call ahead to reserve a table -- itself another novelty.

click on the image &quot;Today fish head bigger,&quot; said the boy as he slapped down the aluminum tray that contained a steaming fish head. He was aware of this discrepancy because on the previous night, I&apos;d eaten this very dish at this very restaurant.

When doing research for Lonely Planet guides, I don&apos;t generally get the chance to eat at the same place twice -- there are simply too many places to investigate. And steamed fish head is an unlikely candidate to draw anyone, even me, back to a restaurant on two consecutive nights. But the dish was easily one of the most delicious things I ate on my most recent trip to Malaysia.

I encountered the steamed fish head in Alor Setar, the capital and main city of tiny Kedah state, in northwestern Malaysia. It&apos;s a sleepy, predominately ethnic Malay place, and in contrast to just about everywhere I&apos;d been previously in Malaysia, it didn&apos;t really appear to have many restaurants or food stalls.  So in an effort to find something interesting, I did some Googling, which led me to this blog post , and ultimately, the fish head at Muda.

Muda has no sign, is distinctly aesthetically challenged, and is run by elderly Chinese Malaysians who couldn&apos;t be described as friendly nor proficient in English. It also doesn&apos;t open until 8pm, but on the two nights I ate there customers would arrive as early as 7:45, place their orders and wait impatiently as the dining room gradually filled with oily smoke. Most of the cooking is done by one old man, so this can mean a long wait: on both visits I arrived at 8pm and ended up spending the next hour playing with my iPhone and nursing bottles of Malaysian Guinness until I was served.

But it&apos;s worth it.

Fish head may not seem like an especially meaty item, but the dish as served at Muda is really one of the meatiest, most umami-packed dishes I&apos;ve ever encountered. The fish head itself is actually more like a fish half and contains quite a bit of tender seabass flesh, both in the head and the body. This meatiness is accentuated by a broth that includes soy sauce, tomatoes and mushrooms, while being countered by the tartness of salted plum, chunks of pickled vegetables and slivers of young ginger. With all this going on, the final garnish of thinly-sliced leeks and deep-fried crispy garlic seems like some sort of last-ditch effort to include every ingredient in the kitchen.

The restaurant&apos;s other specialty is fried noodles, specifically or mee , which allegedly means &apos;black noodles&apos; in Hokkien: The round wheat noodles are fried in dark soy sauce along with greens, a type of fish cake and pork, and come served with a side of sliced pickled chili. It&apos;s not as salty as you&apos;d imagine (the pickled chilies really help cut through the soy sauce and lard), and instead is predominately smokey, meaty and rich.

Be the fish head big or small, I&apos;m glad I went back to Muda twice, as it took the first visit for me to realise that steamed fish head served in a grotty restaurant with grumpy service where little English is spoken is obviously not the ideal Lonely Planet recommendation. And it took a second visit to realise that I don&apos;t care -- it&apos;s too good not to go in the book.

click on the image If Malaysia has a national dish, it&apos;s almost certainly nasi lemak, rice cooked in coconut cream and served with sides of tiny deep-fried fish, peanuts, slices of cucumber, a boiled egg and a dollop of sambal belacan, a type of chili paste.

It&apos;s available everywhere, typically unceremoniously bundled in sheets of brown wax paper or banana leaves, and stacked on top of a table. It&apos;s always inexpensive and always satisfying -- spicy, savoury, crunchy and a bit salty. It&apos;s the kind of dish you begin take for granted or even overlook if you spend enough time in Malaysia, until, that is, you encounter a version that reminds of you of exactly what it&apos;s meant be.

The nasi lemak that did it for me was recommended by author and Penang native, Ong Jin Teong. Teong described this version (pictured above), sold from a shophouse cafe near Penang&apos;s Pulau Tikus market, as Penang style, and explained that it differs in a few subtle ways. Firstly, the sambal belacan here is left raw (elsewhere it&apos;s often fried in oil) and is served with a squeeze of calamansi (the result is a lot like the Thai nam phrik kapi ). And instead of a hard-boiled boiled egg or tiny fried fish, the rice is accompanied by fish rubbed with salt and turmeric before being deep-fried, or prawns marinated in tamarind then fried. But perhaps the most remarkable thing about this version of nasi lemak is, paradoxically, its most basic element. As Teong mentioned to me, &quot;This is the only place where the nasi lemak is lemak.&quot; &quot;Lemak&quot; literally means &quot;oily&quot; in Malay (&quot;nasi&quot; means &quot;rice&quot;), but it&apos;s rare that the dish has much of this texture or flavour. Yet the rice here was overtly rich, featuring a lot of the decadent fattiness and a little of the slightly sour fragrance that comes from using coconut cream.

For me, eating this version was almost like tasting the dish for the first time, and I have to admit: it&apos;s been hard going back to those paper packets.

click on the image Forget street food; Bangkok is 7-Eleven country. Within a 200m radius of my apartment, there are six branches of the minimart: View Thai Eats in a larger map In my case, this could be because 7-Eleven&apos;s HQ is nearby, or maybe it&apos;s somehow rooted in the fact that Thailand&apos;s very first 7-Eleven was installed on Thanon Patpong, also in the same &apos;hood. But actually there are 7-Elevens all over this city -- nearly 3,000 of them. Here&apos;s something I wrote about this phenomenon for Lonely Planet Bangkok :  7-Eleven Forever

Be extremely wary of any appointment that involves the words &apos;meet me at 7-Eleven&apos;. In Bangkok alone, there are 2700 branches of 7-Eleven (there will inevitably be several more by the time this has gone to print) – nearly a third the number found in North America. In central Bangkok, 7-Elevens are so ubiquitous that it&apos;s not uncommon to see two branches staring at each other from across the street.

The first sewen (as it&apos;s known in Thai) in Thailand was installed at Patpong in Bangkok in 1991. The brand caught on almost immediately and today Thailand ranks behind only Japan and Taiwan in the total number of branches in Asia. The stores are either owned directly by the company or are franchises, owned and managed by private individuals.

Although the company claims its stores carry more than 2000 items, the fresh flavours of Thai cuisine are not reflected in the wares of a typical Bangkok 7-Eleven, whose food selections are even junkier than those of its counterpart in the West. Like all shops in Thailand, alcohol is only available from 11am to 2pm and 5pm to midnight, and branches of 7-Eleven located near hospitals, temples and schools do not sell alcohol or cigarettes at all (but do continue to sell unhealthy snack food).

7-Eleven stores carry a wide selection of drinks, a godsend in sweltering Bangkok. You can conveniently pay most of your bills at the Service Counter, and all manner of phonecards, prophylactics and &apos;literature&apos; (although very few English-language newspapers) are also available. And sometimes the blast of air-conditioning alone is enough reason to stop by. But our single favourite item must be the dirt-cheap chilled scented towels for wiping away the accumulated grime and sweat before your next appointment.

click on the image If you spend enough time eating in Bangkok, particularly at old-school-type restaurants, you&apos;ll undoubtedly begin to notice an abundance of faded and often framed restaurant reviews, written in English, by a certain Ung-Aang Thalay. The name -- it translates as &quot;Sea Toad&quot; -- may seem familiar even if you&apos;ve never visited the city, as Ung-Aang Thalay has featured in Jeffrey Steingarten&apos;s It Must&apos;ve Been Something I Ate , as well as in this now-classic 2005 New York Times article about eating in Bangkok by R.W. Apple Jr .

Ung-Aang Thalay -- who has another name that his parents gave him -- was born in the US, but has lived in Bangkok since 1968. He began writing restaurant reviews for the Bangkok Post in the days long, long before blogs, listings magazines and online restaurant guides, and is the guy responsible for having put now-institutions such as Soi Polo Fried Chicken, Chote Chitr and Jay Fai on the map. I&apos;ve known Ung-Aang Thalay for a few years now, and his passion for Thai food is clear, if not by anything else, than via his rhetoric; who else uses phrases like &quot;I was slobbering like a Mastiff&quot; or &quot;It was so good we were flopping on the floor like trout&quot; when describing his reaction to a bowl of noodles?

Yet despite the love, Ung-Aang Thalay can also be disarmingly skeptical about the current state of Thai food. Like those of his friend, another Bangkok Post writer, Suthon Sukhphisit, Ung-Aang Thalay&apos;s sensibilities for Thai food can often seem to be locked into the Bangkok of the past -- a hopelessly conservative viewpoint for some, but a perspective that I sympathise with, and one that offers a window into a culinary world that is quickly disappearing.

That&apos;s why I was surprised when, after a hiatus of several years, Ung-Aang Thalay recently revealed that he was reinstating his food column. So, if, like me, you&apos;re partial to the flavours of Bangkok&apos;s past, buy or log onto the Bangkok Post on Fridays; Ung-Aang Thalay&apos;s recent columns have revealed a delicious-sounding Chinese-Thai eatery , a visit-worthy noodle restaurant and a central Thai restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s suburbs . His upcoming review, a dish of which is illustrated above, was consumed with me at a central Thai-style restaurant in Bangkok&apos;s northern suburbs. It was delicious, and frankly, I&apos;d like to write about it, but I&apos;ll leave that to the expert.

click on the image I recently passed through Phnom Penh -- my first visit to the city in about three years -- and have to admit that I hardly recognised the place. The town&apos;s never-ending construction finally appears finished, and with a slick new waterfront promenade, a handful of glassy high-rise buildings and the new and the seemingly North Korean-influenced Council of Ministers building , the city is looking more modern than ever. Perhaps it&apos;s inevitable then that I noticed a dearth of the type of old-school shop signs that used to be everywhere in the city. Computer technology and printing are ubiquitous and cheap now, and in the cities at least, signs and adverts are no longer painted by hand. Fortunately today, while organising my photos, I came across a folder of images such signs, taken on a previous trip in 2007. Another gallery of Cambodian signs can be seen at Phnomenon .

click on the image I may not have the most sophisticated palette or possess the most extensive knowledge about food, but I&apos;m pretty sure that I&apos;ve been blessed with powerful restaurant sense. I can usually pass by a place and at a glance, get a relatively accurate feel for whether or not the food&apos;s going to be interesting. I&apos;ve been burned a few times, but would attribute these lapses to the existence of some kryptonite-like element (perhaps those deep-fried hot dogs that are ubiquitous on Bangkok&apos;s streets?), and in general, my track record is pretty solid.

This was confirmed yet again at Hok Kee Phochana, a longstanding Chinese-Thai restaurant in an obscure corner of Bangkok. I&apos;d passed by this desolate stretch of Thanon Banthat Thong a few times and noticed an intersection with a glut of restaurants selling haan phalo (ห่ารพะโล้), goose braised with five-spice powder. Curious, I recently returned to the area on foot for a closer inspection and was drawn to the old-school interior of one of the restaurants, Hok Kee Phochana. In fact -- and providing the ultimate challenge for my senses -- Hok kee has three interiors: the un-air-conditioned crusty one, an adjacent simple but air-conditioned dining hall, and rather brash modern restaurant.

Wherever you eat it, the highlight here is the braised goose. We ordered the mixed version (illustrated above), which in addition to tender goose breast, also includes intestines, wing, blood, liver, heart and other hard-to-identify giblets. In particular, the blood here is almost impossibly soft and tender -- one of the best versions of the stuff I&apos;ve encountered. The thin layer of braising broth just might be the most satisfying bit, and unlike elsewhere, is not overtly sugary, instead relying &quot;sweet&quot; spices such as star anise and cinnamon, which are countered by a salty, slightly peppery flavour. The goose is consumed with a tart/spicy dipping sauce that combines, vinegar, garlic and fresh chili.

On my second visit, I tried a couple other dishes, including deer fried with Chinese celery: The deer meat was very tender and pleasantly singed, and any gaminess (there really wasn&apos;t any) was countered by slivers of ginger, the fragrant Chinese celery and chili. The dish included salted black beans , a rarity here, even in Thai-Chinese cuisine. Excellent.

There was also fish head hotpot: something that&apos;s quickly becoming one of my favourite Chinese-Thai dishes. The fish head is served in a broth made tart with the addition of salted plum, and is served with a dipping sauce of fermented soybeans and garlic. Fish head doesn&apos;t generally mean a lot of meat, and that which is found requires some effort to extract, but it really is some of the tenderest most flavourful part of the fish, and also has the benefit of adding a level of meaty depth to the broth.

Other recommended dishes at Hok Kee include or suan , a type of oyster omelet, and abalone fried with kai lan. View Thai Eats in a larger map Hok Kee Phochana
