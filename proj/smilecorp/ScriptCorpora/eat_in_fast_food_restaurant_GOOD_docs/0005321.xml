California Senate Bill 1613 (SB1613) Will Require California Drivers to use a &quot;Hands Free&quot; Device

 By Steven Thomas 
 
Thanks to California Senate Bill 1613 (SB1613) signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, Californians will have to put down their cell phone while driving and become hands-free by July 1st 2008.

The bill, brought forward by Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, requires motorists to use a hands-free device when using a cell phone while driving. The new law will impose a fine of $20 for a first-time offense and a $50 fine for each additional offense. The bill allows exceptions for calls to law enforcement agencies for emergency purposes, or emergency services personnel while operating an authorized emergency vehicle.

In addition to these exceptions, commercial truck drivers, tow truck drivers and operators of farming vehicles are also exempt.

The question for many Californians&apos; will be: How can I become hands free?

Becoming hands free means you are talking on your cell phone while driving, yet both of your hand&apos;s are still on the steering wheel. Actually, you can have only one hand on the steering wheel, as long as the other hand is not on a cell phone.

Interestingly, you can still eat the cheeseburger and fries from your favorite fast food restaurant with one hand, while you steer with the other hand without getting a ticket. Same goes for putting on makeup, brushing your teeth, trimming your nose hairs and other single-handed driving habits too disgusting to mention...but I digress.

So, how do you become hands free?

Well my California friend, there&apos;s more than one way to become hands free.

1. Abstinence ( don&apos;t use your cell phone while driving)

2. Speaker Phone (yell loud when your in your car alone, and make others believe you&apos;re a schizophrenic)

3. Use a bluetooth wireless device. ( you know, those things that people stick in their ear&apos;s)

4. Use a &quot;wired&quot; headset. ( most economical, ear buds plugged into your cell phone)

5. Install a &quot;car kit&quot; ( talk loud when your in the car alone, and make others believe you&apos;re a schizophrenic)

While the debate over whether sb1613 will make California roads any safer continues, many believe that even though there are other distractions that cause driver inattentiveness, sb1613 will address one of the more visible reasons for driver negligence.

How many accidents are really caused by distracted cell phone drivers? That depends on who you ask. According to a Harvard study in 2002, 5% of all traffic accidents are caused by distracted cell phone users. California Highway Patrol statistics show that cell-phone use is the top cause of accidents triggered by distracted drivers going all the way back to 2001. At the bill-signing ceremony in Oakland, Governor Schwarzenegger said;

&quot;The simple fact is, it&apos;s dangerous to talk on your cell phone while driving,&quot; &quot;So getting people&apos;s hands off their phones and onto their steering wheels is going to make a big difference in road safety.&quot;

While it&apos;s difficult to argue with the Govenator, Sprint Nextel would beg to differ as the only cell phone company opposed to sb1613.

Sprint Nextel

&quot;SB1613 fails to address the real public issue of inattentive driving and singles out just one potential distraction, the handheld wireless phone,&quot; said a letter from Sprint Nextel to the governor asking for his veto. &quot;It ignores many other more significant causes of inattentive driving, including drowsiness, smoking, and adjusting the radio/CD player. And it fails to distinguish between inexperienced teen drivers, who may be easily distracted, and experienced adult drivers whose experience and maturity make them completely capable of operating an automobile safely while speaking on a wireless phone.&quot;

Good points on both sides, however, the bill has passed and will go live in July of 2008. It will be interesting to see how many drivers will actually be pulled over for cell phone violations. The fact is, today I drive down the streets and highways in California and it seems almost everyone has a phone to their ear, frankly, I don&apos;t believe there will be enough law enforcement resources to ticket all sb1613 violators.

For $20 or $50, some people will likely gamble and continue to use their cell phone on the road. And for some of us, we welcome the break in connectivity for a change. In my world of technology, I&apos;m wired to the world all day at work, on the way home with my cell phone and wired once again from my computer at home, as of July of 2008 my drive time is going to improve.
