 Scam of the Month– ViSalus Sciences 
 
 

From Primerica selling bogus financial services to the sad miracle cure of MonaVie , it seems like everyone, everywhere has a great product to sell, and in most cases is so great that they require your help in selling it. The concept is simple and no different than every other MLM scam out there. You simply buy the product and sell it or help sell it directly for a chance to get rich as the product is simply flawless and undiscovered which makes it so much more valuable (or so you are told). The real problem however lies within people not believing a word of what you have to sell. How can this be? So many have claimed to make millions and now live free because of this and you somehow can’t sell anything?

 ViSalus Sciences sells a series of health pills and products supposed to help you live healthier and better. Ranging from weight loss pills to anti aging pills, the system is claimed to be a proven solution to help everyone but yet is not sold in stores? A great solution that would make millions if sold to the public but its not available in stores. That’s interesting that even a health store like GNC would not carry such a miracle cure but lets keep going with it.

 

 So what are you asked to do? 

Well you are asked to do what every MLM out there asks of you. Work very hard and sell lots and lots of products and make a commission off of every sale past the $200 mark. Meaning that each month you must sell or you can’t continue. Be prepared to buy extra products just to stay in the game even if you have no buyers. The site sums it up real nice, giving you an example of you selling $5000 and earning $1200 in commissions. They make it look easy by showing you how a few sales can make you big money but lets face it…how many do you know where you can sell $5000 of health supplies that they’ve never heard of? The point is that you don’t know enough to even sell $200 to, so you would have to start buying more for yourself or to resell, not earning any commissions but rather paying them (Exactly what MonaVie asks you to do).

 

 But wait there is a BMW in it for you! 

That’s correct, the very few lucky ones that make it to the regional director level, which will take you an eternity of ripping off people, will earn the right to go lease a BMW themselves and be paid $600 a month towards their lease, but must remain in the program at that level to keep it. So here is the kicker as to why this is a genuine way for you to not only not have a BMW but to get yourself in a financial trap at your own expense. You get to the regional director level and get to pick any BMW up to $600 a month. You are limited to a 3 series as the other ones cost more or require lots more $$$ down, but wait they show you a 6 series on the site? If the following month you don’t make it in sales, you must pay your own payment, which makes no sense as you may not want to spend your income on a a cheap 6 series that must be black. The better part is that if you don’t really qualify for a BMW lease, you can’t even get one, since the lease agreement has nothing to do with ViSalus Sciences but rather is with you and BMW. Visalus Sciences simply pays the $600 monthly allowance as long as you make them a ton of money but what happens if you quit or have to move? Well ViSalus Science has nothing to do with you, and therefore enables you to continue carrying your own payments unless you sell. There is one more element to this and its quite simple, you must sport all types of advertising for them on your car and there are many restrictions as to which car since they want others to believe in the myth. ViSalus Sciences executives do drive BMWs because of YOU selling their products, and are paid by the corporation, not by some product scam. (This is identical to 5Linx’s Bentley program which is even more foolish).

 Where does it all lead you? 

Nowhere, and therefore i will tell you that success is not founded on the basis of selling infomercial goods that has testimonials from doctors that no one has ever heard of. Success is you realizing that these opportunities are bogus and that real opportunities are out there in the form of real jobs. Please do not fall for these idiotic practices that prey on young folks with the dreams of getting rich.

 Do you want to Stay Poor? 

 We outlined and showcased the deceit and unethical business practices that Visalus offers. Obviously you are interested in Visalus for one reason, to make money. There could be other reasons as well such as the achievement of being your own boss and running your own business. Unfortunately, Visalus preys on the unfortunate and uneducated with false hope. If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. The reality is opportunities exist all around us and there are a million ways to make money and it all begins with yourself. It begins with a shift of your mind, seeing the world from a different perspective; one that allows you to identify realistic opportunities and positioning yourself in a win-win outcome.

In our book: Stay Poor–The Idea of Making Money , We don’t tell you how to invest, how to find funding, or how to find the next big idea. Instead we are going to change the way you look at everything around you, to help you identify opportunities around you and how to act on them but more importantly teach you how to be fearless in your quest for success.

 If you purchase my book and for any reason you feel like the book you purchased from us had no impact on your thinking or was not of value to you, we will refund you in full within 10 days of purchase, no questions asked.

 MAKING A CHOICE To See Things Differently 
 INSTANT GRATIFICATION = ARROGANCE + IGNORANCE There is a simple fact that people that know how to make money often think alike, they often identify opportunities and know how to act when positioned for success.
 This success is attributed to the Mindset they share and their ability to unlock their potential via their perspective.

Taking control of your mind is key when it comes to acting around money
 to ensure that you leverage all of the financial tools and loopholes you can find in order to succeed.

I been in this company! Too much hype and bad people! No such thing as free bmw!
 River 
I wish this was tired of seeing naive friends posting this crap. Someone start a page of Visalus scam as they have so much money invested online, it’s near impossible to find anything against them!
 Amber M. 
Pretty sure I haven’t had any problem selling and using the product! It is a great product and people need what Visalus is selling. We live in a nation of unhealthy people trying to find a way to become healthy. Visalus offers a way to do that AND make money. Who wouldn’t want to buy it?
 Contactus 
If it was legit, their crap would be sold in stores and they would be popular. The product is garbage and the program is a scam in every way, no difference from 5 lynks or Primerica
 Amber M. 
Really? Then why is it that EVERY SINGLE ONE of my clients has lost at least 3-5 lbs a week. I have gone from 16.8% body fat to 13.2% in three weeks! The proof is in the results my friend! How can you sit there and say it is crap when you probably haven’t even tried the product?
 Lexdynamic 
It’s interesting. I’ve been approached by friends who seem to be inviting people every week for a“challenge”. I suspected it was nothing more than multi level marketing, which is a nice way for a legal pyramid scheme. But what I’ve found is that Visalus representatives have a clear strategy to overwhelm Google searches of“Visalus scam”with their own“independent third party”reviews. Why would they do this, if it’s as good as they claim? Why set up such a defense of the term“Visalus scam”when they would tell you that Visalus is definitely not a scam. It’s a scam.

As for Amber, so, your“clients”lost weight.  There is one way to lose weight.  You take in less than you burn off.  If their product was the miracle it claimed, they wouldn’t have to rely on duping people into duping people—stores would be banging on their stores to sell it.
These outfits operate on a cult mentality, so I can see why those who are for it, are so passionate about it…but talk to me in 5 years and tell me how much money you’ve made…or lost…
 charles 
Amber M. fails to realize that not everyone needs to lose weight, and the people she roped into it probably did not exercise OR eat right so OF COURSE they would be losing weight if they replaced any meal with a shake of less calories. a MLM (multi-level marketing) scheme IS a pyramid scheme. This is a scam. It is sad to see a former classmate sucked into this cult. I had to de-friend her because I thought she was hacked on Facebook but apparently their plan is to annoy their friends and try to sell their crap.
 Brittain 
of course you are using this product! You are probably the main one buying it because your more intelligent friends and acquaintances know better. And so you can keep your“label”that the company promised you.  Becoming healthy is as simple as eating healthy foods (i.e. fruits and veggies and REAL food) and exercising. It is simple but nobody wants to do the work to be healthy. They want a slim-quick plan that offers INSANT results and that’s where YOU come in.
People don’t need what you’re selling. You want them to think that so YOU will make money.
 Ilovejenna2006 
There is only one way to do this. Eat right, drink plenty of water and exercise. This takes a lifestyle change. What are people going to do? Drink shakes and take pills for the resr of their lives? People are always looking for the easy way to do things.
 Ds5806 
I have friend right now who has gotten sucked into believing she is going to make a TON of money and that she can achieve her BMW within 45 days she has hassled me and hassled me for days trying to get me to join her and I have continued to refuse a life lesson I learned young was if something sounds too good to be true it is and making money pretty much by talking to people and getting a free BMW is too good to be true I just hope my friend realizes it before the screw her over…
 Padreman77 
There is alot of naive people! The people that building your lives with positive people in a positive enviroment. I hear you all complain and say scam. But I am sure your stuck in yojr dead end job complaining about life. Visalus has changed my life and my familys. I am healthier and feeling better than I have ever in my life! I drive a FREE BMW and help countless people get there health back in order and I help many financially. So if this is wrong then something is wrong with this world. I help people and my community everyday! What do you do for people or your community that is a positive thing?
 Spunky 
I am a promoter of this company earning 5 figures a month and we earned our free BMW in month.  On top of that we have 32 friends driving free cars too and many making additional $2000-10000/month into their households.  None of us have ever been in MLM before.  So I would say…proof is in a pudding.  If the product works (which it does…ask my many customers that are losing weight and gaining muscle)…it sells itself and your business will thrive!  As far as MLM being a pyramid…let me ask you about your corporate structure?  Do you earn as much as your supervisor, managers, or CEO.  Likely not, so if you aren’t earning as much as the person on the top, I guess that makes it a pyramid as well.  BUT I will point out with this MLM, I am earning more than the person who sponsored me.  Weird how that happens….and the pyramid just collapsed!  Sorry MLM and pyramid schemes are not the same thing.  Take the time to look them both up.
 lara 
I’ve been doing Visalus for a month with not one bite…no one wants to do it…on top of that several people I know who do monavie laughed at me and won’t switch over. Meanwhile I’m watching the happy-go-lucky statuses of my upline on facebook while I worry about paying rent next month. I’m so sad, I told them that I couldn’t afford to do this unless it worked and it hasn’t worked at all for me. I feel lost, and frustrated, and taken advantage of.

Listen, All you skeptics are idiots! I’m not yet an active member of Visalus  but….. I just attended the Orlando Visalus Vitality Event with over 6000 people this past weekend and watched over 1000 BMW’s awarded to Visalus members. I also personally watched three members awarded 250,000 each because of their level of achievement in Visalus. Our personal friend and his wife were awarded 25,000. To all you that don’t believe in this, keep your day job and book your 3 day cruise on Carnival next year with all the other loosers……. If you want to dream big, get yourself to a challenge party, no joke. We have been using the product with excellent results. We are so excited to get rolling. If someone says it is a scam, they are uninformed and I recommend you make new friends. Seriously!

losing 3.5% body fat in 3 weeks isn’t even healthy, so even if you are speaking the truth, the product sucks.

These MLM prey on people who are desperate and are looking for a get rich quick scheme.  They in turn try to confince their friends and family to buy this product by preying on their poor body image.  The company only wants you for your connections and when they run out they are not your freinds anymore and neither are your freinds.
 Anonymous 
I think your comments are very sad.  You forget to look at all the jobs they add to this desperate economy and that you don’t have to do much but let the product results sell itself.  If it was in GNC than it wouldn’t be giving many people a chance to have a job or make a business out of it,  there would only be a handful of people getting the financial benefits.  Look at it another way, a lot of people are getting unbelievable results on it and not only that, but couples and families are working together in helping others reach their goals and earn some money in the process!
What’s wrong with people helping people get healthy and earning a living in the process?  You hand the fast food chains money to get rich for their garbage, are you complaining about that!
 Saevere007 
MLM’s have no mechanism to control product saturation, nor do they care to. Infinite salespeople selling infinite supply of product. The product is the cover for selling the dream of becoming rich. Everyone who succeeds at these succeed on the backs of low level distributors buying into the training process to becoming rich. Imagine if we had to buy products and services in the real world that paid over rides and royalties to 8-10 uninvolved distributor layers.
 Minnie 
Thank you for this explanation about the“too good to be true”BMW.  These selling schemes often cause friends to put other friends on the spot w/ the sales pitch, turning what was once a genuinely caring relationship into opportunism…can’t stand this kind of stuff.
Plus, IF you want to lose weight, it’s possible to do it for FREE, and then put that money you didn’t spend on the product aside to buy yourself a decent car.
Here’s the program:
Eat fewer carbs and less fat, drink more water and unsweetened tea, consume lots of produce, lean meats and fish, and move your body through space for 30 minutes four times a week.  That’s it!
 polo12 
To get a BMW you have to sell a certain amount  (12,500 a month) with three other people under you to sell also,  You get $600 to lease a black BMW with their advertisement on it.  If you don’t sell enough to earn the $600 guess who’s responsiblity the lease is, that’s right yours.  You have to get the lease on your own.  To get a lease you have to have good credit and a JOB. The agreement you sign with Visalus says in the first few lines you are not an employee of the company or do you represent them. They do not ask you to sell for them or to recruit anyone else to sell for them.  If you are sued they do not provide you with a lawyer or have any responsibility to or for you. Good Luck on getting that lease. If you do not make to money to pay for the lease than you have to buy them out or etc……

That’s because the person who recruited you is not the greatest leader, or perhaps is learning how to become a leader….. Sometimes this happens. Get on your website and disect the training videos in your back office. I just qualified for regional director yesterday in less that 2 months! Don’t QUIT&amp;DON’T lose faith!!!  Keep your eye on the GOAL! Good luck girly&lt;3 God bless.

It’s disheartening to hear the ignorance seeping from every word in this post.  I can tell you with 100% conviction that this company is the furthest thing from a scam and for the record you can BUY your BMW, you don’t have to lease.  If you don’t want to get a BMW, then just collect the $300/month cash instead, it’s completely up to you.  2 weeks ago, I watched 5.25 million dollars in bonuses given away at the company event.  Let me ask you, what does your day job boss give you for all the work you put in?  I bet it’s a nice Turkey or maybe a gift certificate for a night out at Applebee’s.  My girlfriend lost 24 lbs. so far and is going to walk down the isle next month with a smile on her face and a tiny little waist.  Another friend is down 50lbs. and is no longer at the mercy of her Blood Pressure medication.  Obesity is the #1 killer in our Nation today, and the difference between what we have and a“scam”, is that we actually have products that work and a business model that is untouched.  Please.  You were intelligent enough to put up a website, do more research next time.
 Saevere007 
Medifast offers the same type of products without the training program to become obscenely rich. They also have a plan to keep the weight off after the shakes. It is annoying to most people to be told that they are poor they are working for a living considering on 8% of the people in the world even own a car. I’ll take my turkey and gift certificate and keep my $200 a month.

Use Common Sense if the owners are making all this money and so are the Reps. The product must totally worthless because there is no money going in to the product. Besides who wants to oack around a bag of mis, blender,milk, etc., after all this is 2011 there are better ways to package a product. What businesses ask their salesmen to recurit their compitetion abd take alower percentage of compensation.  Stop drinking the Kool-Aid.
 Rfdiaz2000 
We all seem to have an opinion about this company. Some good, some not so good.  But what I have learned in this life so far, is that there are two sides to every story.  I have not yet joined Visalus, or even tried their products, but I do know that every day when we step out our front doors there is a world of uncertainty ahead of us and if we don’t take a chance on something then we will never know what might have been.  I have been to two different doctors in the past month and have been given three different diagnosis and three different medications. So I think that it couldn’t hurt to try something new and hopefully positive to help my current health situation. If people are doing this“business”soley for the money then they are doing it for the wrong reasons. But if someone is doing it to better their health and good things follow then thats just a plus. Good Luck to all of you out there for and against this product.  I wish you all good health!

I tried this 3 months ago went from 148 to 132 and love the way it works.  My Sister also likes it and has lost 15lbs in two months.  And I forgot to say I off My blood pressure med and feel great.

Okay i wanted to look into this because it is in Yahoo’s Top news right now about how this Company is Paying Off BIG.  (Ryan established his first company, 24-7 Tech when he was only twenty-one years old. Since then, he has created and actively invested in multiple start-ups and has become a self-made multimillionaire. After he sold his company ViSalus Sciences to Blyth in early 2008, the global recession took the company to the brink of failure resulting in a complete write off of the stock and near bankruptcy. Ryan as CEO went“all in”betting his last million dollars on its potential and turned the company around from the edge of failure to more than $150,000,000 a year in revenue in only 16 months winning the coveted DSN Global Turn Around Award in 2010. In this interview, Ryan talks about how he re-branded himself after being in a gang, the issues with the education system, and more.) Here is the Full story of his life and keys to Riches

 Buddythebobfather 
I have to agree, if you search around for honest information about this company it becomes clear that they have invested a significant amount of time and money into“sunshine pumping”The people I know who sell this crap claim that it cures all kinds of disease and is the greatest weight loss product in the history of man. Of course they have lost some weight. That tends to happen when you go from eating fast food at every meal to drinking a shake. Come back in 2-3 years and you will find most of these people put the weight all back on and are falling for some other scheme. They also spend as much if not more time trying to tell people how rich they will become if they sell this crap too. If the product is so great and so amazing it should virtually sell itself and the people involved shouldn’t have to pimp business so much. The truth is it’s just another pyramid scheme. They are also masters of what I would call miss-information. Recently they claimed to have been featured in the Wall Street Journal Magazine. Yes they were“in”it, but not in the way they try to make people believe. An insert produced by a company that does significant advertising for MLM companies was purchased and placed in the magazine. In that purchased advertisement insert was a page advertising visalus paid for by visalus. So they paid a company who paid a company to place and ad. Even the marketing is like a pyramid, haha. Save your money and don’t get involved in this crap you can do better. Get an education and get an amazing job really helping people not scamming them.
 Bodytalk 
First of all, it’s great to hear that you have one of those too-good-to-be-true-o-meters. ;) Sad to say, but a lot of folks don’t and fall for the get rich quick schemes without thoroughly researching the “golden opportunity” at hand.I’ll give you my own “is ViSalus a Scam? – answered from a marketing and PR perspective” after the research I’ve done…The company has negative ‘propaganda’ that was most active in April and May of 06, upon their launch, but they continue to innovate with the launch of Neuro Smart Energy in ‘07 (which has tremendous marketability based on the unique formulation of DMAE or “brain food”) the launch of their Trim Slim Shape™ Weight Management System in ’08 and, now in ’09, they have just launched their social networking community called Vi-Net to support these products (which seem pretty comparable in ingredient comparisons from their website). That’s indicator number one that ViSalus is not a scam. After 3 years of being slandered on notorious forums like scam.com, they continue to innovate and haven’t fallen by the wayside – or been indicted–which speaks volumes in this economy.They have partnered with BLYTH, a successful publicly traded corporation and home expressions company in the direct sales arena. I wouldn’t think BLTH would jeopardize their shareholders, brand and assets unless they had made an extremely educated decision in answering that question for themselves before finalizing the strategic partnership, “Is ViSalus a Scam?” Indicator number two.The final indicator that has convinced me personally that ViSalus isn’t a scam is that the ViSalus CEO, Ryan Blair, is someone regarded highly in the media – especially on CNBC and the Big Idea with Ronny Deutch where he was featured as a multi-million dollar serial entrepreneur in showing America how to become successful quickly. Now I’m pretty sure that with all these news organizations promoting Ryan’s success and legacy, that they would have done their due diligence in finding out, “is ViSalus a scam?” It would be a PR nightmare for them if there were people being scammed by ViSalus with Ryan Blair at the helm so I’m sure if there ever was the possibility of ViSalus being a scam, they (the media, CNBC etc..) would be the first one’s to broadcast it on a national scale just to cover their mess up in promoting a fraud – which I don’t foresee happening.Good luck in your decision because that is of course entirely up to you after you have reviewed all resources for yourself. In my opinion, based on this research ViSalus is NOT a scam. One last word of advice, don’t let these videos from MLM marketers who aren’t even involved with ViSalus, and just spam their video titles with (scam) for controversy to drive traffic and peddle their wares, waste your time.I’ll leave you with this…what impresses me most is that ViSalus is proactive in giving back to the community. I came across their profile on a new charity network called Make the Difference Network or MTDN. Anyone who gives back to the community and charitable organizations in this economy is A-OK in my book.Best of luck and hope it helped!

Bodytalk thank you so much for setting the record straight about ViSalus.  People also can check out one of our major investors BLYTH Ind.  They are a multiillion dollar company who owns or has major shares in multiple companys including Partylite and Two Sisiters Gourmet.  The reason this company is so successful is that it is the products and real life experiences and successes that sell themselves.  A story is worth a thousand words and people really need to do research before trying to bash something.  You have Nothing to Lose but Everything to Gain if you just give it a chance and check it out.  ViSalus also has a community Challenge that you should check out.

Well, I have read all the posts here and I am completely disgusted with all the negative posts I have read here about Visalus. Either you are obese&amp;poor&amp;can’t afford the products or just plain jealous. As one of the founders, Blake Mallen taught us to say when someone says something negative“That’s amazing”Now all you dream stealers go away!
 Brian 
Keep drinking the Koolaid.  The ones buying this are the ones looking for a quick fix.  Ask any of them that lost weight what there eating habits were before the“challenge,”I am sure you will hear it was horrible.  It is no miracle why they are losing weight now.  If they drank 2 Mc Donalds shakes a day and had a sensible dinner they would still be losing weight.  Remember the thighmaster?

I am sure the product not only helps people to lose weight but also, gives people more energy, like myself.

This shake mix that taste like cake mix, is truly changing peoples lives, regardless of those who don’t believe in it.  We all are en-titled to our own opinion.  But, personally know it works, losing 7 pounds in a month, on and off the product.

What i dont get is why are you bashing it. Have you tried it. lol im a real person not some fake post. I have lost weight off the product so have my friends and even my girlfriend. She has lost 66lbs off the product and is healthier then ever. I wont call it a miracle shake but it really works. And as for making money off it it? Its a job, in my area its a 38% unemployment rate, this is creating jobs for people like me. My parents are even doing it and theyr happier then ever. I see that your a none believe or maybe you tried selling it but you just are a lonely sob staying up all night flaming about different things, and have no friends =)

All i have to say is.

I am a director about to qualify for RD and my sales are growing because why? My friends&amp;Family/customers/nutritionist’s/even my psyio-therapist loves it. Why would they wanna tell people about a product that doesn’t work.

Also i don’t give a sh** about the owners, who makes it who profits i don’t care. Were making money losing weight. Whats to complain?

It is amazing that the people who are selling this stuff have drunk the kool-aid so heavily that they come on a web site debunking Visalus as a fraud and put up their links.  Who are you trying to sell to each other.  The rest of us have already figured out the scam. Have you made all your friends and family mad. Sad……..
 Polo12 
Be very careful and please don’t give up on finding a real job, one that gives benefits: paid vacation, medical,etc.. A job that the Company will proudly say yes they work for me. A job that you can put down on a loan or lease application. Please be careful also that you don’t get in debt with these people.  This company tore a part our family. You want a job that pays you a wage you can count on and you don’t have to scam and lie to people.

This has recently become popular in my area and I know someone who is selling it…I even got invited to one of the“challenge”parties. I didn’t go because mainly because I knew I couldn’t afford to buy anything (I had to search the internet to find the prices b/c the people who sell it aren’t really that forth coming with that info).  I also heard that if you want to sell it, you have to put up money to do that but I could be wrong on that…Anyway, I knew it was a scam the minute I heard about it and I won’t be“drinking the koolaid”LOL.

How am i scamming and lieing to people?

Its a total scam….but people fall for it, wanting a magic pill solution.  I always hear the same thing:‘Oh, I lost 100lbs on visalus….blah blah blah…bmw…blah blah blah…’Hey, you morons…it’s called meal replacement.  If I replaced one meal with blueberry purree and pin sap, I would lose weight….but it doesn’t mean that its healthy.  All Viasalus is is Slimfast under a pyramid scheme.  It’s ridiculous.  People will use it for a while and the second they stop using it, most people will gain the weight back.  Weight loss is simple mathmatics.
 SirSkeptsalot 
I don’t sell the stuff, but I do take it. I have been 100 pounds overweight for more than half my life due to some terrible diet choices and a lack of exercise. Exercise and changing my diet only increased my muscle mass, but didn’t make me LOSE size which was what I wanted, so I tried to replace two of my meals with slim fast as well…which is basically protein, loads of sugar, and sodium, and make up for the loss of nutrition with one solid meal and two healthy snacks. I lost a few pounds slowly and then it evened out and I gained it back. In my opinion the biggest problem with any other meal replacement is the massive amounts of sugar and sodium that are used to make the“shakes”taste good enough to consume. Visalus has a negligible amount of sugar, low sodium, and doesn’t rob me of the nutrients of a normal, healthy meal. I personally don’t have any experience with the company, so you can say what you like about them, but I’m finally losing FAT from my body without feeling like shit all day. The company may have some insane scheme for pulling in sales people, but the product is the only legit thing out there. Sometimes things DO work.–A fellow skeptic that was proven wrong.
 Polo12 
Because you are telling them that this outdated mix is going to make them slim and cure their health problems and that ,oh by the way sign up to sell and you’ll become rich.  You have these people telling you that you have to get your friends and family to buy because no one else will unless they are.  They promise you a BMW. but you have to lease it your self must be black and advertise them. They send you $600 every month to pay for it and if you don’t sell $12500 a month and have three people under you oops it’s your baby.  Try getting a lease without a job. They tell you on the contract that you are not a employee and you not represent them. They say they do not ask you to sell their product or to recruit anyone.  We know this is a lie. They take no reponsiblity for you or to you.  Her’s a tip better put at least 15% a side to pay your social secutiry taxes, since you are not an employee you have to pay both sides of SS tax for any amount you receive.
 fatboy 
Slimfast has sugar. Spiru-tein tastes bad and doesn’t play nice with my tummy. I hear from my buddy that Amway tastes terrible.  Absolutely you can loose weight by doing any number of things. However, Visalus is something you can tolerate. I also lift weights and I am tired of spending money at GNC when I just‘pass’most of the good stuff out of my system before it is absorbed.
 Andeegirl77 
if you just want to use the product will they try to make you sell it?
 Haters gonna hate 
Sure is ironic that this site is hating on Visalus, yet is doing the same b.s. it condemns, trying to sell ebooks on how to achieve overnight success…haha…Hi pot, say hello to kettle…can’t stand a little competition and have to knock them down ?
 Polo12 
You betcha that is the way the make their money.  That is why it is a pyramid scam
 Polo12 
Do you not recognize sarcasm. This is not advertising it is making fun of all the gimmics they use.
 http://tomandalicia.myvi.net T.J. 
this doesn’t replace your job, it helps you lose weight, get fit, stay healthy, and if you do become distributor, you’ll make a little extra money on your spare time.  let’s just say you signed up for weight watchers and you lost weight, 10 people ask you about how you lost weight and you tell them, and they all sign up, and then they lose weight and tell 10 people, how much money did you make…NONE!!  With Visalus you would be generating income plus getting you stuff for free.  Money coming in none going out
 Coolgirl 
no.  i only buy it because it worked for me.  18 lbs in 1 month.
 TT 
Wow, how brainwashed!  I have heard that“dream-stealer”crap from a brainwashed co-worker who is peddling this crap (she is driving us all crazy and has lost all her friends by being pushy…desperate, I guess).

I think it is incredibly sad that people are falling for this scam.  Brainwashed sums it all up.

dude, that wasn’t in Yahoo’s Top news, it only showed up because of the cookies on your computer…what a lie!

sighhhh……which cycle of the brainwashing are you on now???

I suspected that Visalus has been“overwhelming”Google with their own propaganda…good to see that others are realizing this.  Too good to be true when you can’t find any unbiased responsed.  I was actually surprised to have made it here to this site!
 Cwtibr 
no; you don’t even have to sell it to get your product for free. You buy your first month find 3 people who want to try it and then all you pay is shipping and handling. This company has been around for over 10 years and has strong backing by Blyth (multi million dollar company with a great reputation). the only people who have negative things to say are the ones who haven’t tried it and don’t really know anything about it.
 Cwtibr 
It isn’t a pyramid scheme. You might sign up under someone but you can surpass them and promote yourself on how hard you work.
 Clavan 
you poor fools,running down great product that has helped so many when you havn’t even tried it yourselves.Your huge loss.

Visalus uses its advertising dollars to pay their promoters rather than spending those dollars on TV or other National means.  Sounds pretty engenious and generous to me to give such an opportunity for those who may otherwise either not have employment or need to supplement their already low paying, unappreciated efforts in a”JOB”–especially in these poor economic times.  And NO–I am not a Promoter, but I am using the product and so far I have nothing negative to say–one week in the challenge and already two inches and 3 pounds from the the“kool aid”as some of you call it.   Signed“so sick of al the negativeity”

Visuals has changed so much since it was started almost six years ago. Visalus is great company and is changing the lives of ten of thousands of people. My wife has lost almost 50 lbs on the challenge and we are using it to promote a better alternative to fast food.
 Non 
This is Old info. The new 90 day challenge has customers and promotors you can get your product for free and be qualified too. Whoever wrote this article is bias and needs to research more. I have thousands of people on my team manning money part time and thousands if customers that get there product odor free too…
 Wenjo222 
Sure, it may have changed and there is an opportunity BUT only to the“select few”who they know will carry out bogus claims of“huge income”!  These people live in homes NOT owned by their own hard work but owned by people they know high up the pyramid!!  It is so they can make people see all the“things they have”and leave them to assume these people are really doing great as the Visalus company states you can…they lie, post FALSE pictures of before and after and so on.  When you catch on to the fact that the“regional director or Director”that is sporting all this fancy stuff and lifestyle then they do everything they can to put you OUT!!  That is what happened to me…..just sign…make them good money and I found out things they surely did not want me to know (false homeownership is just one example) and they thew me out on my own and will just go find the next to lie to and suck into their web!!  SO watch out if you live in the Grandville and Wyoming Michigan area!!  Just to name two towns…..
 Wallaceflooring 
first, I just recently joined visalus to make some money. At first I came to this site to do research to see what people are saying about it, I couldnt find anything good. So I started asking around in melbourne fla if anyone was doing it. I came across a cop who was doing the challenge and who was being a distributor. we talked for hours, I was a skeptic. then I thought to myself what do I have to lose?. I weighed my options. They have a money back guarantee. so I tried it, because I thought if cops are doing it, it has to be legal. he is making a crap load of money and has a new bmw sitting in his driveway!!!
so I know for a fact it is not a scam!!! I have seen with my own eyes. The people who are putting this company down because you think this is a scam are wrong. you will make money if you are motivated!! if anyone wants to make extra money and get healtly on the side call me at 321-369-8617 my name is chris wallace. I would love to show you how. Remember this is NOT  a get rich skeme, you get back what you put into it! If you are lazy you will yield no results, if you like talking to people you can make 1000.00+ a month

What is a REAL job? Society tells us a REAL job is going to work for 10 hour days, sitting behind a desk, getting thrown under the bus from co-workers and or own supervisors because he/she doesn’t like us for whatever reason. The Owner of (Hotel A) has billions of dollars. He hires a Management company to run his hotel, who hires Directors, who hires Managers, who hires line salary employees who then hires line hourly staff. Try starting at $10 an hour, working all day, never seeing your kids or wife/husband cause your busy working trying to feed them, you blink your eyes and your 65, having putting in 40 years at Hotel A, getting a couple promotions along the way, now you make $17.25 an hour over 40 years. Now you retire, tired of working. Did you ever make what the owner has (millions) off of you working for him? NO!!!! That right there is what society says is a REAL job. Get Out Of Corporate America. That lifestyle is NO Lifestyle At All. Netwirk Marketing is not a scheme it is the same setup as corporate america just without the bulls**t hours and bulls**t minimum pay. My time is worth more than the $10 an hour you tell me I’m worth.

This is what I call an ignorant article. The simple fact is a shake from Visalus cost $1.87 plus shipping and tax so about $2 after all is said and done. You replace a meal and the body gets more nutrients and fiber than a usual meal. If you are overweight you loose pounds in fat and if you are fit you gain muscle when working out. Because you replace a meal with the shake you most likely break even or even save money while you loose weight. It is a simple solution to a BIG problem in the world which is health problems due to weight gain. Where is the scam? Our team has 75 people who earned a BMW in less than 4 months. You can buy an old used one and still get the $600 a month and pocket the difference. This article is simply wrong and has no real research. I honestly think the idea behind this page is to get traffic and make money on ads, because it makes no sense at all. http://www.visalusnorthamerica.com get informed!
 Realstorypictures 
No most likely they would not loose weight if they drank 2 milkshakes from Mcdonalds when you look at the fat content and sugar content. Silly
 MadPromotor 
I believe it depends on the“Promotor”you speak with as some will be straight up honest and others who are REALLY good at being the salesperson that could sell you a swamp!  LOL…unfortunatly that happened to me.  BUT…as far as the product is concerned, they taste really good and are very satisfing with hundreds of recipes too.  You can return in the first 30 days if not happy…full refund.  YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LIFE CHANGE THOUGH….be ready to be healthy, have energy, loose weight if that is your goal or just like any time you“diet”, you gain when done and go back to unhealthy choices, period! Yes this can be achieved in multiple ways without Visalus products…this is just simply“one way to do it”!!    Now, as I said before, as a promotor….you will do really good as long as you can lie and unfortunatly I can not and have no desire to.  So I have some customers and will continue to help others WITHOUT all the BS my upline does (Grandville, Michigan) and they dropped me as soon as I let them know that I knew the game they were playing to people in order to get them to sign on for 500.00 plus!!  So, here is an example of what I spend vs what I get in checks.  I spend about 500.00 per month and with my customers I make about 80.00 back…Whoot Whoot  So, if you want to speak to the one who will give ya the straight honest route…let me know =)
 http://www.freehealth.bodybyvi.com And sure you can refer three friends to Visalus and if all three purchase a kit of equal value of yours then the FOLLOWING month you get the“equal”kit free….and as long as they stay on…yours is free..if one stops…you need to replace that 1 and so on.  BMW…big joke and so not worth the wasted words at this point!
 Wenjo222 
Do you know anyone who was a distributor for PartyLite??  Blyth is the company behind them also….and Partylite was just as bad back in the day when you were a distributor…I watched a friend loose alot because they kept telling her that she had to spend money to make money and go to all the“meetings”whether out of state or not.  She had to buy extra product to meet their quota for her to remain a distributor…..very vicious circle!
So,“Cwtibr”the“only people who have negative…blah blah..”is so NOT true…cuz here I am =)  Just being honest and still promote…just in a different way…the honest way…to actually HELP people in the ONE of many different ways to be healthy and not screw with them in the meantime!
 Wenjo222 
True, True!!  AND you can get even farther if your upline teaches you how to deceive people…I hope you don’t Cwtibr!!  I am really trying to believe there ARE people promoting like myself and really care about people =)
 Wenjo222 
Hey now, play nice! LOL…I would absolutely (and do) inform anyone about the Visalus product as ONE of the tons of ways to get healthy whether it is to loose weight or build lean muscle or both….I wouldn’t encourage becoming a distributor at all…….
 Polo12 
The truth about Visalus and all pyramid schemes (if it doesn’t have a product it is a ponzi scheme) They have a cheaply developed product that they sell (these guys who started it did a long distance company as a pyramid until it played out) for a large price (while conning people into beleiving it is some miraculous shake that they are not really pay much for) This cost is anywhere from $149 to $249 depending on what add on they convince you that you must have.  Then they say you can get it free if you get three of your family and friends to buy it, and they can do the same thing.  If some doesn’t buy for a month than you get charged for it.  You have to pay them $580-$1000 to sell their product (red lights should be flashing) You sign a contract that says you are not employed by them, you do not represent them, you pay your own taxes (that is 15% right off the bat for social security-medicare  have to pay both sides) If you get 3 people to sell for you and sell $12,500 a month you can go out a lease or buy a black BMW with their advertisement on it, that is if you have the credit and a JOB somewhere else theywill give you $600 amonth.  If you lose one of those three or don’t sell the $12,500 the lease is yours to pay for anyway you can.Yhey state that they have no reponsiblity for you or to you.  If someome sues you they do not help you.You have to buy so much no ifs or buts and you have buy or sell at least $200 a month to be a distributor.  When you sign up a new distributor  you get a finders fee and 5% of your new competition.  One thing Visalus is great about it is the Kool-Aid they mix up.  They want you for yoyr contections and when they are played out so are you. They make you think that you have to get your family involved  and it is alright to decieve, lie, and set your friends and families up using any dirty trick in the book. All that matters is making that sell and signing them up. When people start pulling away it all falls a part but Visalus has made it’s money. What is the most sad is they make the people believe that they are helping these people they are tricking.  It doesn’t matter if they can afford it or not, or they be taking away from their kids and getting into financial trouble. There is an old Peter, Mary and Paul songs that says”go ahead hate your neighbors, go ahead cheat a friend, do in the name of Jesus you can justify it in the end. But one day was judgement day……….
 Polo12 
The difference maybe vacations, sick days, 401K, a job you can actually put down on a lease or purchase application.  A future and a company that will say that you are actually an employee and they take responsiblity fo you and for you. They pay employer portion of social security.  The most important it is a honest living you can keep your soul.

wrong it has been around for 6 years before that their scam was a long distance pyramid.
 saveyourmoney 
ok, the shake costs about 2 dollars per serving, but then you have to add what sellers try to steal out of your pockets….they claim you need to also buy the vitamins, the neuro, the mix in flavors and the appetitie supperesent….THAT IS WAY MORE THAN 2 dollars.  You ask where the scam is?  It’s in presenting a product as something more than it is not!  It’s a shake…there are many other shakes out there and they are all different.  Visalus loves to compare…that is rude.  What some people already enjoy works for them there is not need to change it.  The only reason visalus sellers make all these claims are because they WANT and NEED sales.  That is the hidden agenda.  This is not a normal“business”.  It does not take research beyond common sence to know that weight loss occurs when you restrict calories.  When you lose weight you feel better and have more energy and come off medications naturally.  It’s not rocket science…it’s propaganda.  Think about toothpaste for example.  We all use it to clean our teeth, and we do not all use the same brand.  But are we going to argue that our teeth are not clean, just because we use different toothpastes?  Come  on!!  If you are spending hundreds of dollars to lose weight…you can not claim to be saving money!!!  It costs nothing to not buy as much food to cut back on your calorie intake to lose weight!  It is FREE to lose weight, and instead of having to thank visalus, you can thank YOURSELF!!!!

It works! I promise you that!! I’m on facebook as tasha.gettin.fit

IF there is no product it the scheme is called a ponzi scheme if there is a product involved in the multible level schem then it is called a pyramid scheme. Evidently I know more about it than you do. Very intelligent response. Uh uh I wonder who is the moron.

 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
I was a Visalus distributor for awhile…first off, you don’t need Visalus to lose weight…losing weight is FREE, it’s all about calorie control.

As for their“Opportunity”, save your time and money. The amount of time you need to put in calling people, going to challenge parties and dealing with your downline is not worth it. Even at the Ambassador level, 10K a month, with all the time you put in to maintain that rank (keep getting residual pay), it comes up to about $16 an hour…no vacation, no sick days, no pension plan, no security. You don’t own your own business: you have no control over the product, over the compensation, over the future of Visalus…you’re not an entrepreneur, you’re a sales associate.

Again, if you want to lose weight, save your money and start counting your calories.  If you want an opportunity, get a real job, where you’ll be well compensated, have a pension plan, job security and plenty of advancement.

Bottom line: save your money, save your time. It’s much better spent with your family than giving it to Visalus.
 Izzy 
Watch it you are showing your intelligence. I got it right off their compensation plan. Go check it.
 Free Thinker 
Who ever wrote this article/blog/opinion is a MORON!!!  For the record, I’m not in Visalus.  You say Go get a job!  Sure, go get a job, tell your spouse to get a job, your kids to get a job and don’t forget about the dog, Fitto, it should get a job too.  Fact is EVERYTHING in the world is a MLM you moron.  Your job is a MLM and how is that working for you?  If being an EMPLOYEE and having a JOB was such a good thing then why aren’t the business owner doing that too?  Hmmmm, I wonder.  Maybe its because EMPLOYEES ARE BROKE AND WILL ALWAYS BE BROKE!!!

BTW–Izzy quit while you are ahead.  No one will listen to broke employee minded people.
 Wenjo222 
Thanks Izzy!!  Yeah, I too would like to see them stop being dishonest…sure should have waited to sign on until I was more informed…my family uses the product and have positive results but I am no fool to think this is THE ONLY WAY…Lol.  I realized all the lies and all the things they do not tell you…and they are really good at talking so fast and in circles…you walk out and be like“what the hell just happened”…so even though I seriously disagree with their pactices…too late for me.  And as long as it is helping my youngest get healthier, I will continue…just will NOT lie and cheat people or sell them stuff they do not need!  These people in Grandville Michigan even stay in a home at about 5000 sq ft (because they lost there own home to foreclosure) and tell people they too could own a home like this really fast….uuggg PUKE!!  I am very sadden and truthfully hurt…thought they wouldn’t be the kind of people to do this…but I take responsibility for my (not so smart) decision.  Izzy, do you know someone in it too?
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
This positive building to which you are referring is just their way of retaining you as a distributor/customer (some people call it brainwashing, or drinking the Kool-Aid)…I have no complaints about Visalus, I just want people to know the truth instead of what they hear from a Visalus distributor (BTW, I was a distributor for awhile…) And I certainly have no complaints about my life: great full-time job with the federal government, pension, benefits, vacation, sick leave, tons of advancement…I spend so much more time with my family, something I couldn’t do as a Visalus distributor because when you reach a certain level with them, and you want to retain that level, you have to attend challenge party after challenge party, travel to this event here and that event there, constantly talking with downline trying to get them to sell and retain them as distributors, retaining customers, team calls, back office work, etc…with my current employment, work stays at work. With Visalus, you really do live the“Vi Life”, as they like to call it, because you are trying to recruit and sell almost all the time, to every person you meet.

I will presume that you are at the Regional Director level (qualified for your $600 payment for BWM, not FREE as you say). If this is the type of work you like, then Kudos, my friend. But do not try to decieve others by giving them the“success story”crap, especially to your friends and family. You’ll soon be part of the NFL club (No Friends Left).
 Wenjo222 
Hahaha…yup, you got IT just like me, and I am not the type to poke fun at or laugh but if your going to“debate”…BE HONEST!  Sure, you can for 49.00 BUT they told me NOT to recommend this to anyone and no BMW qualifications and you get less in commissions.  OH YEAH…Don’t forget the 29.00 a month for the“better”internet site…they got me there too….didn’t tell me and it was taken out of my checking acct…with three kids…that hurt and could really hurt others!!  They also wanted me to sign people up and NOT tell them if they pick, let’s just say the 5th of every month for autp-ship….and they signed up on the 3rd at 500.00…you get charged for your first auto-ship two days later when you do not need it because your sign up includes product…they didn’t tell me…I found it myself and stopped it!!
 Wenjo222

Before you put your name or a dollar value in front of a product it is your responsibility to research said product for authenticity and nutritional content and long term effects on the body.

From the health perspective alone not dwelling on the misleading advertising and obvious 1970s high pressure sales tactics, the scale of fair play tips to a definite NO WAY on this one.

Check the ingredient of the shake read 4 times as much as you talk then make a decision based on what you read not hear from the mouth of a salesman wanting your money.
 Elitesccer07 
As a nutritionist if you have the sense to look at the ingredients it’s filled with almost everything your body needs. The product does work people are the ones who don’t. If you are supplementing it to lose weight and exercising and watching what you eat you will lose weight. If not you will not lose weight so learn how the body works and how food is metabolized and come back and sensibly talk.
 Garry 
What is it you do? You comments are unfounded and your logic is faulty. Your rhetoric is comical. Continually stating the same thing over and over and over again. If you are so unhappy with the company stop talking about them. No one asked you to shout blasphemy from a website. It’s people like you that make this world a bad place to live and you should be ashamed of yourself. So go ahead I can already guess your response blah blah blah blah visalus sucks.
 Kim champion 
I can’t even read all the way through this ridiculous”scam”review.

The only way you can fail at Visalus is if you are a lazy fool.

The product works, so everyone who sees you should be seeing a walking testimonial.The compensation is so simple. I personally know atleast a dozen people who have gotten their BMWs and I’m not that far from getting my own!

It’s sad that anyone at all can go online and run their mouth blaming others for their own failures. Do the work and see the profit like the rest of us!
 Vi girl 
Izzy, it is painfully clear you have never even tried a) the product b) selling it. I personally paid a ONE TIME $50 to make profit off of the people who see the product works and want to buy it too. I get my product for free EVERY month because I have done the foot work to have more than just the bare minimum of 3 people who buy through me every month.

You should be ashamed of your self for spewing such foolishness about something you know nothing about. There are alot of multi level companies who screw hardworking people everyday but Visalus couldn’t be easier. Use the product as directed, see results, share with others, make a profit.

Even if you don’t want to SELL the product it is still one of the cheapest and most effective health/weightloss products available.

It’s a win win situation…unless you are a looser to start with
 Alanhunt 
My name is way more valuable than a high high mantinance BMW, I have a friend who does this….he buged the crap out of me…kinda like green eggs and ham story except….i drank the shake twice a day….starved myself to death….I could have at whole grain cereal twice a day and been better off. IT IS A SCAM, dont do it. my new rule“if you ask me to join a multi level anything you are probably gonna get ignored from here on out.”The honest job requires a learned skill. I have already seen the guy who asked me to join, lose his toys once cause the company he was with before went down the crap shute. Want lots of money? offer a service better than anyone else can. get good at it. and you will be a high demand honest working person..
 Saevere007 
There is no denying that MLM’s and visalus can make people a lot of money. The system itself is set up for failure. Infinite sales people selling infinite product no matter how good or cheap the product it only has partial market penetration. As soon as the the balloon pops the good networkers jump ship to the next company. Help 3 people help 6 people succeed on the backs of the hundreds that fail and you will be worshiped in a cult like setting where everyone goes into a frenzy while you show off your new tux.
 Golden Rule 
“The only way you can fail at Visalus is if you are a lazy fool.”

A fool I may be, thinking I can stop anyone from making a mistake from this post.

But in response to Lazy, I own a strong flourishing business and need nothing from this company. It is funny that you defend a Company that has the integrity of a goat They care less about anyone but themselves. The product has not and will never hold up the claims they have puppets like yourself making. You see that’s the beauty of it they are saying nothing you are. They just dangle the carrot or 3 series BMW depending on who they are trying to motivate and you spout of all kinds of untruths in order to close you next deal. I would proudly wear the hat of a Lazy Fool as to walk in the shoes of a greedy liar.

On a side note: Why is a BMW 6 series on the website and a 3 series what the best puppets drive?

Dear Free Thinker, I wish you would have paid for a little of that knowledge you share it may have had a positive impact on your life. Please think more and when yoy fell something needs to be said think more.
 Izzy 
You have drunk the kool-aid. No I have never talen the product (too much common sense) but members of my family have. They were running around looking for something to throw into their shakes because they got so hungry and weak from not eating. After spending over a thousand dollars they had not lost a pound. Other members did pretty good at it after lying about how much weight they had lost and being very pushy and conniving until it all fell apart.  They thought they had earned a BMW until they went to pick out and found out that they had to lease it their self and to get lease they had to have one of those bad old jobs. Another member tried to just sell enough ( after paying her $50 for the priviledge) to get hers free, but couldn’t seem to keep three coustomer after a while.  I am just saying use your common sense do your research and then decide with a clear head.
 Izzy 
I do make money at a real job which I went to college to prepare for.
 Izzy 
Yes, This stuff has caused a great riff in my family. The ones trying to sell it being so pushy and conniving by using other family members and then getting mad at the ones who did not want to get involved. It left a bad situation not one we can not get through but one that hurts and we all will not forget.
 Izzy 
You are so right in everything you said.
 Izzy 
If I am so wrong why do you get so upset, No one asked anyone to express their opinions. The people selling this stuff do not want to face reality and want people to stop telling the truth.
 Izzy 
Slimfast is more advanced at least with Slimfast you don’t have to have the milk, blender, and add ins

It is like seeing someone drive off a cliff and not being able to stop them. You keep yelling the alarm (I keep repeating the facts) but no one hears……..

Wow-What a bunch of negative thinkers!!  I am not in Visalus, but I have been in several network marketing companies and:  If they sell a product,( in most cases), it is not illegal or a scam.  What you have to watch out for are“misleading”claims about what the product could do for you.  Most NWM companies have very good Compliance Departments which monitor the distributor field for misrepresentation, and, if found, they could be terminated.  From what I have heard/read about Visalus, it is a“straight-up”company.  Most of the people who criricize such companies do so without having proper information or:  They had a relative/friend who lost money in a similar program(probably because they did not WORK), so they blanket them all in the same category.  The biggest problem that I have seen is that the“sponsors”try to make it look too easy to make money, and people believe them.  If you treat your NWM business like a real business you should be successful.
 Jay 
Damn man! You might as well join Visalus as much publicity you are giving them! You could be making some money right now! I’m not even with Visalus YET but it MUST be something GREAT if one person would put this much effort into negative portrayal of it! Thank You for swaying my decision into getting started :) lol. I was taught a long time ago to never knock something you’ve never tried if it won’t hurt you. Also with almost everything you get out what you put in. Except for in your job where you can do the bare minimum and still make the same as the person over achieving for that promotion they may never get because their boss decides and NOT them!
 saveyourmoney 
Also…it is really disturbing that just anyone can sell a“diet product”and talk like they are experts on health and nutrition.  It is really rediculous that people fall for this all.  I know many people who sell this and I see behind the scenes.  They all lie and come up with plans to trick people.  Selling this is only about money and it is sad.  I have worked in the health&amp;fitness industry and it saddens me when the diet idustry is targetted.

Most people know losing weight is simply about calorie reduction.  By drinking a 200 calorie meal instead of eating a 1000 calorie meal, one will lose weight.  All the vitamins we need are in food.  It is going to be sad when the hype is over, or people decide to eat again.  The weight is going to pack on fast.

Another inside scoop about sellers and how much it costs to sell.  First you are encouraged to buy into the company for 500.00, then you have to pay a monthly fee to have your website, then maintain your quota buy purchasing more product if you don’t have enough buyers.  Before you can even think of making a real profit, you have to first make back all the money you are spending.  That usually does not happen for the majority of sellers because they are at the bottom of the pyramid.  Also the sellers have to pay taxes on the money they make.  So according to the majority of sellers bragging how rich they are getting…maybe they should not be so loud about it…the IRS is watching and listening!

Remember…if you are approached to sell, you are only going to help the people above you…unless you can get just as many people under you.  And if everyone is selling, then where will the buyers come from?  This is how these pyramid companies always end.  It gets boring, and saturated.  The owners will always be rich and move on to the next scheme.  The sellers have no protection.

I have seen so many friendships ruined over this.  Sellers have to make lists of all their friends and family to contact.  You will be on the list even if it has been 10 years since you have talked.  When they contact you they will talk to you like you are their best friend.  Say“no”and they ditch you.

All sellers are given scripts to use, words to use.  It is like brainwashing.  It’s also a red flag that they find the need to ruin online meeting places like Facebook to sell.  I don’t try to get people to use my brand of shampoo, or toothpaste every other posts.  These sellers are desperate and lose their sence of character the longer they are members of the cult.  So Sad :(
 Wenjo222 
I know I am repeating from another time I posted in this forum BUT Visalus must not have the“Compliance Department”in the  Grandville/Wyoming Michigan area….which is surprising concidering the“founders”are from there…and I can say that, not because I just feel like coming here to bad mouth a company, but from personal experience!!  The“First Female BBV Champion”held a“challenge”Party and I went…..long story shorter….the product is just ONE of HUNDREDS of ways to get fit PERIOD!!  They lied about their home ownership, as they lost their actual home just this year, they talk of using photos that show wonderful things but they leave out the elective surgeries, the BMW is a JOKE, they do not disclose alot of the FACTS….and when I figured out all the lies they actually told me (because I was dumb and didn’t research enough FIRST!)  they threw me right under the bus……..they are like this nasty little CULT!!  I really feel sorry for the kids of these deceiving adults.
Can you make money?  Sure can…Just this last month I spent around 500.00 on product and 180.00 on promoting tools and my“pay”check added up to 176.00…YES!!!            HaHa  I will take care of the customers I have and always be honest and will not EVER use a lie to further myself, that is why this and other forums are out there…they KNOW people that have LOST alot…finacially and family/friends!!  So I am very glad this forum is here….people need and deserve to know the truth….don’t always believe what you see….they play on people who have been out of work or work a lot of hours and ect.  So, bottom line….be carefull in Michigan…and I am sure this is not the only area doing some scamming…stay clear of the Taggart’s!!!
 Chachaz 
“YET but it MUST be something GREAT if one person would put this much effort into negative portrayal of it!”

Jay, if people didn’t truly care, they wouldn’t share.  Plenty of the responders here have either first hand knowledge of this‘business’and are sharing their personal experience or know a friend/family member who has (and have been suckered).

If you want to go jump off a cliff, that is your business!  But if someone wants to prevent someone from making a terrible mistake by sharing their experience, then kudos to them.

I have seen a family member ruined by this and now a coworker, who is as brainwashed as anyone mentioned here.  It really is very CULT like behavior that Visalus employs.  Very sad for those who are dumb enough to fall for it….feel free, Jay.
 Izzy 
You are so right.  They use their family and friends,trying to trick them into coming to challenges as so on.  If you say no they want to kick you out of the family, weird it as if they are taken over by something.
 Izzy 
blashemy, you are kidding right? I was simply quoting a old protest song. It went over your head but it means when people are doing wrong and they know it they try to justify it by saying it is for religion or more familar to you“I am helping people get healthy”.
 Izzy 
Why do you even fool with these people?  There is so many better and cheaoer products out there. Just wondering. I know you will probably be quitting but why not cut your losses now?
 Izzy 
Everybody is just starting or they don’t sell it. Ever wonder why. Don’t drink to much of the kool-aid or you will become a zoombie too. That is the decision you made after reading this site. WOW!
 xClaraX 
I did sign up and spent the $49. Honestly the protein shake I normally buy from the local nutrition store costs $60 a month so why not take a break from that one and try this for a couple months. I am not going to spend any more than $49 a month on it and if it works out great, if not I will quit. I think it might be worth looking into but I would not ever lease the BMW. If they want to give me $600 a month then I will take it but leasing a car myself because they told me to? That’s stupid…. I am not going to buy the vitamins, I prefer my normal ones. I am also not going to buy the shake add-ins, I made a shake today and just dumped in some frozen blueberries I already had. But if it doesn’t pay for itself after 3 months I quit and move on. Side benefits of course would be a paycheck and weight loss but I am not quitting my Weight Watchers while I do it because THAT is something I really believe in.
 Izzy 
That is so smart Weigh Watcher are really great I know scads of people who lost weigh and kept it off with Weight Watchers, they teach how to eat regular food in the correct portions.  Watch this company I know several people that got caught with automatic ship and it ended up costing them more than they realized. Good Luck
 xClarax 
Thanks! I don’t know how long I will do this shake anyway because it’s made with sucralose which I have recently found gives me headaches, my usual shake has stevia instead.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
I just want people to know the truth instead of what they hear from a Visalus distributor.  I certainly have no complaints about my life: great full-time job with the federal government, pension, benefits, vacation, sick leave, tons of advancement, job security…I spend so much more time with my family, something I couldn’t do as a Visalus distributor because when you reach a certain level with them, and you want to retain that level, you have to attend challenge party after challenge party, travel to this event here and that event there, constantly talking with downline trying to get them to sell and retain them as distributors, retaining customers, team calls, back office work, etc…with my current employment, work stays at work. With Visalus, you really do live the“Vi Life”, as they like to call it, because you are trying to recruit and sell almost all the time, to every person you meet.
The amount of time you need to put in calling people, going to challenge parties, dealing with your downline, back office work, team calls and attending events is so not worth it.…their online“training”is a freakin joke…Even at the Ambassador level, 10K a month, with all the time you put in to maintain that rank (keep getting residual pay), it comes up to about $16 an hour…no vacation, no sick days, no benefits, no pension plan, no security.

You don’t own your own business: you have no control over the product, over the compensation, over events, over the future of Visalus, even over your downline…you’re not an entrepreneur, you’re a sales associate. Every distributor you sign up is now your direct competition.

Bottom line: save your money, save your time. It’s much better spent with your family than giving it to Visalus.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Visalus prefers to be called MLM instead of pyramid…which is like saying callgirl instead of whore.

Look for my posts under“Ex-visalus Distributor”for the truth about this cult…I mean pyramid…I MEAN MLM…
 Aj Leblanc 
you CAN NOT returned opened product!
 Aj Leblanc 
that does not mean it is still not a pyramid!! lol. If there are people at the top getting rich, and people at the bottom who are NOT, then it IS a pyramid. Go to school and get a real job.
 Aj Leblanc 
ummmmmmm, SO, they KEEP 300 bucks just because you refuse to be a sheep and drive a black BMW……..sounds fair. SHEEP……..baaaaaabaaaaa.
Who did they give the bonuses to????? I bet it was NOT the people at the bottom of the pyramid…
I AM NOT SAYING that the product is no good, just the COMPANY and their screwed up way of selling it! If it is sooooo wonderful, why don’t they sell it in stores, so EVERYONE has access? I have yet to receive an answer to this question, form anyone.
 Aj Leblanc 
OMG, could not have said it better myself. I am hardly speaking to my best friend anymore, all bc of this company and her non ability to see this for what it really is, a BIG FAT SCAM. When I see the product available in STORES, without having to push it on other people, maybe THEN I will feel differently. But by that point, this person will have no friends left except her“Visalus”friends, who (no offense) all seem like a bunch of cult crazy freaking morons.
 Aj Leblanc 
“Dream big”Exactly, it is a dream for 99% of the people
 Aj Leblanc 
 http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/MLM.php I took the time, and YES I have tried the product. I think most people have a problem with how it is being advertised/sold, not a problem with the product. Eventually, your market WILL dry up, then maybe you can go to school and get a real job. A respectable job, where you don’t HARASS people for a living!
 Aj Leblanc 
these people’s user names are even centered around visalus. Get a life that involves at least 2 things……..lol
 Izzy 
You are so right about these people.  They do not realize how zombie like they sound with their memorized spills.  What happened to common sense.  So SAD……
 Izzy 
Be sure you understand that it cost $49 to be able to sell enough product to get yours free (have to sell same kit you are getting) To be a distributor you have sign up for automatic ship for $125 and sell enough to make a $200. If you want to get a commission and a chance at the BMW you have to pay $500+ or $1000. The commisson varies as to how much you sell and how many you have signed up under you to sell. Look at other entries to see how you earn the BMW  Be very careful.
 Izzy 
Everyone but the stores are selling this stuff. It is sold on Amazon. Why would you need to buy frpm a distributor? Since everyone who takes it is selling it, who do they sell to. All cheifs and no indians.
 Izzy 
This sounds like the brainwashing lets party and get drunk (alcahol is so healthy and they live such a healthy life style) meeting that some of my family went to. Gave away BIG fake checks. I agree anyone who is selling this needs to make new friends because you are not going to have many of your old friends left. No one every said that a few don’t make money but most don’t.  The market is to saturated. They put on a fine show for the gullible. All that glitters is not gold.
 Izzy 
I agree. Like the way you think. You have not drank the kool-aid and think clear.
 Izzy 
They teach them to say that.
 MLMSCAM 
LOL! How much Kool-Aid did you drink in Orlando? It’s already too late for you…you sound like you’ve already fell for it…have fun calling everyone you know and inviting them to your“challenge parties”…
 Pissed off 
ok, I came across this blog because I was trying to see if other people have had the same issues as myself with visalus. I signed up with a friend who pushed this stuff like it was crack, she had me signed up before I could even think about it, all the while trying to convince me it would be the best thing I ever did, I was hesitant the whole time but when I told her to stop, I didnt want to use my credit card, she plugged hers in and sent it away, so now I am apparently a distributor. A few days after this we have a serious family crisis that saw my household income cut in half, I called this long time friend and told her this needed to be cancelled due to the situation at hand. As a distributor she was not able to help me in any way to get out of it, she could sign me up just fine, but no way she could sign me out. I spent the next 4 days sitting on hold hours at time, since I needed a return code to return the unopened box of product. I kept getting an operator then the would transfer me then hold again. On the 5th day I finally got a human being ( I should mention I also emailed and never got a response). I apparently cancelled my account, so I thought. I returned the box via UPS. So now I wait for my refund right ? Wrong !!! They are now charging my credit card (which apparently got added to my account by my friend). So now I am back to sitting on hold and hoping I will get this much needed money back. I have read several other complaints of this nature, of visalus taking hundreds from peoples credit cards every month, I am a single mother, who has just lost my husband and now I have to fight for this money !! I followed all the procedures, this has nothing to do with being lazy ect. The fact is once you are in you are in and you are as good as screwed !!! DO NOT SIGN UP, THIS IS A SCAM !!!!!!!!!!

You do not“get”a BMW, your co. leases one for you.

You loose fat by burning more calories than you take in.
You gain muscle by working our with or without your product.
Earned a BMW?  It’s leased and therefore not a tangible asset.
 Izzy 
I am so sorry this happened to you. It sounds like you are a nice person and where taken advantage of.  I hope that you get all your money back but I know of several instances that the money was never returned. This kind of friend you don’t need. I would never take advantage of my friends, family or anybody the way these people due.  This is a great blog and one of the few honest one.  The guy who set it up is a genius.  Wish you the best of luck and will remeber you in my prayers.  It seems like single women are a target of a lot of scams.
 Demidan 
How?  If your skill will with spoken English is a poor as your written you need more than a shake to help out.
 Izzy 
If it is such a great weight lost tool and has everything your body needs why then do they want to sell you an appetite suppressent and vitamin packs, and even add ons to make your shakes better and even something that is suppose to give you brain power.  I wouldn’t over look that last one because if you get invoved with this scam….you need it.
 Izzy 
no you have to lease it yourself and they will give you $600 a month to pay for the lease if you recruit and sell enough every month don’t sell enough than the lease payment still comes due and it is you name on the lease and you don’t have the money oops!!!!!
 Izzy 
They teach them this fairy tale of everythings is a MLM you don’t need a job.  Come back to the real world. Having a job is a wonderful thing. If I have a job I got vacations, holidays, 401 K, pay check I can count on, health insurance, and the ability to buy a house, car, etc.  YES having a job is GOOD…………….. And I don’t have to be broke waiting to con somebody into buying some worthless shake.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
It’s not being negative…I would never recommend this to an unemployed person (or really anyone for that matter), because first, they would have to shell out some serious cash to sign up and to maintain their monthly membership, and second, if you really want to cold call people (mostly friends and family) to try to get them to buy Visalus products (or sign them up as a distributor), you might as well get a job doing telemarketing and getting regular paycheques. Trust me, even at the ambassador level, where claiming you make 10K/month is a regular saying, you really only make about 10 to 16 bucks an hour when you account for all the time and money you invest getting to and maintaining that level.

Bottom line: save your TIME and MONEY, it’s much better spent with your family and friends than giving it to Visalus.

First I would like to say that I have lost 20 lbs in 26 days of trying the Visalus product.

I have not cheated but taken all of the products as instructed and then I also eat one low fat meal a day.

To say the Company is a scam or the product does not work because of some INDEPENDENT REP’S that are saying things that are untrue or being rude or pushy, is like saying the Gas from Exxon is bad, or you can’t make money by owning an Exxon Station, just because you go to an Exxon Gas station and someone that worked there was rude or did not do what they were suppose to do or maybe they lied to you.

As far as this being a“Pyramid Scheme”I think everyone should check out this video whether you are in an MLM or not:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZiw15VgWoI 

By the way I have a great job and I do not need to make money by selling anything but the product is not a scam.

Just my $.02

 Tracymaurer50 
I just started with Visalus and I am actually a Realtor so I didn’t want to sell anything more.  I was using the shakes personally and I have hoards of friends who wanted to buy it.  So I signed up.  In 10 days I have over 5,000 in sales.  The products are the best I’ve ever had.  Ive experience no sort of scam.
 Fields 
What is finding three people who want to try it called? Sorry I would call it selling.
 Fields 
First if you have lost 20lbs in 26 days you need to get to doctor you may be sick. Second I am glad that you don’t need money because they are gong to take as much as they can get, but you have drank he kool-aid and are now a zommie.  Have you noticed that everyone who raves about this stuff just started. I can tell you drank alot of kool-aid because you are delusional. You compared Visalus to Exxon. I had a family member that compared Visalus to MicroSoft. What world do you live in where a MLM company is compared to Legit Retail businesses?

Come back in a few months and tell us how much you are spending veruse howmuch you are making. Everyone usually starts with a bang unless the area they are in is already saturated. Give it time the scam is coming
 Daniel 
Wow Fields. It is amazing that you and many people on this blog are so angry and spewing venom about this Company as if you have an agenda.

You said I was probably sick because I had lost 20 lbs in 26 days, you said I was a Zombie, I had drank the kook-aid, etc…

All I did was tell my experience with the product and then you attack me. That shows the intelligence level.

And If you go back and read my post I am not saying Visalus is comparable to Exxon, I was just stating that to blame a Company for the actions of some that may represent or work for a Company is preposterous. Also to say the product does not work because of how some people, that are Independant Reps, act or what they say is also unfair.

I just want people to hear both sides of the story however I am sorry if you or anyone else had a bad experience.

Thanks,
Daniel
 Fields 
If you look at the contract you signed. You are not employed by this company, you do not represent them, you pay your on taxes, they say they do not ask you to sell for them and do not ask you to get others to sell for them. They hold no responsibility to you or for you. If you have to get a lawyer they do not pay anything on it. You have to pay them to sell for them and you have to buy a certain amount.  That is not a reprensentative that is a victm.  I would read all the blogs below. Yes I do have an agenda with these people because they scammed my family. Although I would have an agenda aagainst anyone who scams others especially the ones who can not affford it and who are desperate.
 Fields 
I am sorry I did not mean to attack you. It is these MLM that I am attacking. They are good at sucking people in. It takes life lessons to recognizes these things for what they are.  Just be careful double check what they are charging you etc.  Good Luck. I hope you come out OK from it.  But they teach you to use legetimate companys (no matter how far fetched) to compare to call everyone who says the truth ignorant, uninformed, negative,&amp;dream killers etc.  I know Just use your common sense.

*Can you make money? Yes
*Does the product work? Yes, but there are other ways to lose weight.
Can you just use the product and not promote the business? yes, and if anyone tells you otherwise they are lying.

Friends and Family? For the people who constantly get bothered after saying no, I apologize for those people who haven’t been taught  how to market their business outside their warm market.
Can you get rich? Yes, but only 5-10% of the people in most companies gets that far.
BMW? Yes, it can be leased or brought. The good thing is I haven’t come across anyone who had to return it. No articles or anything online! You have to be smart with your money. If you can afford the payment without the $600 then great if not, it wouldn’t be a smart idea to get it.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to research, research, research and from credible sources.
Does meal replacement work? yes: http://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-meal-replacement-drinks
Does direct selling and network marketing (MLM) work? Yes
Bill Clinton endoreses it:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_eGbfTPbGY
Robert Kiyosaki: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0jabc3OBpc&amp;feature=related

At the end of the day people, you have to do diligent research, and not listen to what’s being told to you. Research from credible sources, not just someone who is bashing the network marketing (mlm) business.

Sorry I typed wrong They do not pay any of your taxes.

I’ve got an idea to loose weight and get a free BMW…

Watch your food intake and calories; eat less crap food.  Burn more calories than you take in.  By doing so, you will be healthier and more fit.   Very simple formula to looking great and loosing weight.  Now, use the money you save and go buy a 1-2 year old BMW.

If you’re looking for a good“opportunity”, Visalus is good, but there are many other MLMs outside the nutrition industry with huge market demand and unique products.
 LadyRedd 
I had to put my two cents in…my ex husband is involved with this“business”…he has definitely drunk the kool-aid.  Yes, they might have a good product, yadda, yadda, and he comes off as a successful person, driving his BMW and posting videos on how to succeed on youtube.  But what the lemmings don’t know is that he has been going to the court for the past year claiming he’s broke and needs his child support payments reduced, his daddy had to co-sign for the used BMW he leased because his credit is bad and he’s been behind on payments 6 times out of the last year, he spends absolutely no time with his children…when they are with him he is on the phone or out at challenge parties leaving them home alone, or he is blowing off his visitation weekends all together because he has to rush to Houston or Detroit for“work”.  He is pushing to the Ambassador level and everyone within his little circle thinks he is the Bomb–they don’t realize he is trapped (got fired from his full time job because he neglected it for this MLM and can’t get hired anywhere for the same money) and is literally running from bill collectors.  Meanwhile the kids are in therapy because they think daddy doesn’t love them and they have bonded more with their step father then they ever did with their father.  I’ve seen first hand what a wonderful company this is and how it’s associates will lie and cheat to get more victims signed up under them.  I’d rather keep my boring 9-5 job with it’s benefits and retirement package,  vacation and yearly bonuses, and be able to forget about work during the evenings and on the weekends, then“be my own boss”with this stuff.
 LadyRedd 
I have a question for you Kim, if the product is sooooo wonderful, why do it’s distributor have to continue to go on a new 90 day challenge every 6 months?  Seems they just can’t keep the weight off.  Do they not teach you how to eat right and maintain a healthy lifestyle after you drop the initial weight?
 LadyRedd 
So how do you keep the weight off?  Do they teach you to eat right and live a healthy lifestyle or do they just push another 90 day challenge?  As for“earning”that BMW…funny, my ex had to get his daddy to co-sign the lease for him because Visalus has nothing to do with you qualifying with BMW to get that lease, they will only pay you $600 a month towards the payment as long as you maintain your level.  If you don’t, that expensive car lease is yours to figure out how to pay for.
 LadyRedd 
What happens if you get sick, have a heart attack and need surgery…how do you pay for that?  My health insurance paid by my job, the one I sit behind a desk for, took care of my hospital expensive in that situation, and my job continued to pay my salary.  As for lifestyle…I get to go home at night and weekends and forget about work–do you?
 Izzy 
You have their number alright.

I just had lunch with a friend who disguised the Visalus pitch into my birthday lunch! What tact! She absolutley ranted and raved about this crap. Mind you, this is an older lady who doesn’t work and is looking to keep busy and make a little money. However, she is telling me that her husband has not stopped taking his blood pressure medicine ( thanks to the miracle of this crap ), and has stopped taking medication for his PAD ( Peripheral Artery Disease ) again, ( thanks to this crap ). What do I tell this poor woman who has been so blinded by the bullshit that she can’t see straight? Then she throws in the Bimmer Bling! I have owned a BMW. I am not impressed. They are crap cars that cost a hell of a lot of money to repair. I swear, I don’t understand why when people pitch this nonsense, they are actually people who say”Wow! A great way to make money with no effort”! Everything worth anything costs something. There is no”get rich quick”formula ( except the lottery ). I just want to slap some people and say wake up! Welcome to the real world baby! Here we don’t get sleep, we have ulcers and crappy bosses but at least all of it is REAL!!!
 LadyRedd 
“misleading claims”…how about these products will cure diabetes and high blood pressure?  Heart disease?  Don’t worry about it, Visalus can fix it.  I heard this and tons of other“claims”by Visalus distributors (my ex is in it and we have mutual friends that have tried to pull me on board).  How about the before and after photos and the claims of giant amounts of weight lost?  Hmmmmm, well my ex was 260lbs when we split.  He lost some weight initially on the shake, but has been doing this business for a year and a half now and looks even bigger then he did when we split.  But he claims he was over 300lbs to begin with and lost 75lbs on the 90 day challenge.  No one knows him from back then so why would they question him when he says this amazing fact at a challenge party?  Sometimes it’s not really the product you have to watch out for, but the distributors themselves.  Lying, cheating scam artists who are only interested in recruiting the next victim.  There is no scientific data saying that Visalus is any better then anything you can get at GNC, but the distributors will cry and tell you how they stopped taking their blood pressure medication because of this wonder product.
 LadyRedd 
Lazy fool…well my ex works this garbage 24/7 and ignores his kids, he’s one step away from Ambassador…but for some reason he claims he’s broke to the court and needs a reduction in his child support payments.“walking testimonial”…LOL  same man has been doing this for a year and a half and looks bigger now then when I split with him when he was 260lbs.  The BMW–ahhhh, what a lovely thing, a FREE BMW!!  Oh wait, did they tell you that you have to qualify with BMW for the lease, Visalus does not guarantee you will get one?  They will only pay you $600 a month (considered a“bonus”) to put towards payments and if you don’t maintain your level no more money…but you still have an expensive car lease payment to make.  The ex had to get his daddy to co-sign for the lease, on a used BMW, because his credit was so bad, and he’s been behind on payments 6 times in the last year even though he got the“bonus”each month…he had to use that“bonus”to pay other bills since most of his other“income”from the company was eaten up in travel and other“business”expenses.

Come back a year from now and tell us how wonderfully you are doing, how simple and laid back your life is, how much free time you have because of this wonderful opportunity.
 LadyRedd 
Broke Employees?  I make quite a good paycheck with my JOB, have health benefits (paid for by my employer), retirement (matched 100% by my employer), have paid vacation and sick time, and yearly bonuses based on my production during the year.  I have a healthy savings account, my kids want for nothing, I drive a nice car as does my husband, and actually get to enjoy time with my family in the evenings and on weekends because I’m not consumed by my“business”.

All Jobs might be an MLM to you, but at least I have security and I don’t have to lie to people to get their money so they sign up under me.

Oh, and I AM a business owner with my own photography business on the side–I make a nice supplemental income from it, but right now I’d rather spend time with my children as they are growing then build it into something bigger.  Can’t say as much for their father who is missing out on their lives while he“works”his Visalus business.
 LadyRedd 
You do realize that $250k and $25k is paid out in monthly payments over 2 years or more, right?  And that the BMW is not really“free”, you have to qualify for it with BMW just like with any car loan or lease, Visalus just gives you a“bonus”each month that you are suppose to use towards the payments.  You don’t maintain your level, you lose that money, but the car payments are still due and YOU are responsible for it.  I bet you saw my ex husband there doing his rah-rah spiel and even saw Hulk Hogan endorsing the products (btw he’s a PAID endorser).

My ex spends more time trying to recruit new distributors under him so he can keep his level in the company, and is missing out on his kids growing up because he cancels his weekend visitation with them.  He’s been involved for a year and a half and is almost an Ambassador (WOW!) but I have yet to see him go on a vacation except for the Visalus sponsored thing in Miami right after the Orlando cult convention, he got to spend 2 glorious days with other Visalus cult members–ooooo Fun!

I think I’ll pass on the 3 day cruise next year since I’m taking a 2 week trip to Hawaii next year to do some scuba diving…I don’t have to go on a Visalus sponsored event, I can go where I want to go.  Oh, and I get paid while I’m gone since my day job has that thing called“vacation time”.

Good luck with your Visalus adventure–make sure to taste test all the different flavors of kool-aid along the way.

You lease or purchase the BMW yourself (has to be black and can be a  motorcycle also) the company does not help you with this (got credit get car, bad credit no car).  Once you reach a certain level they pay 600 towards your note.  If you don’t want the car you get 300 a month extra.  But you have to maintain that level of sales.  Hell if you own a BMW and it’s black you get the 600.  I’m not knocking it, tried the shakes, taste good and filling.  They’ll help you lose weight, but I don’t have the time or patience to do MLM/network marketing.
 Izzy 
This sounds like some of my family. They used baby sitting, Christmas get together, even promising to quit smoking to try to get me to sign up. They live in some fantasy world that all they have to do is get you to one of their challenges and you will see the light and be a convert. I tried to explain to the that a MLM is a pyramid and they want your conections. They get every bodies money for as long as they can then they move on to greener pasture leaving everybody mad at everybody else. Read all the blogs to see what a rip off this is especailly the BMW.
 Izzy 
I like you . You live in the real world. You have the common sense to figure this thing out.
 Izzy 
You are great.  You know this business inside out. Hulk Hogan will endorse anything if he is paid and he doesn’t cost much either. His wife divorced him after he beat her etc while on steroids. So he needs every little bit he can get, have you seen hacking rent-a-couch co.  That is another business that is designed to take advantage of the desperate.

Ur friend should have and could have done that for you and been in touch with the company in 2.5 seconds!!!  Not the company’s fault but ur friends!!!  This info is coming from a Visalus distributor!!!
 Dpfrye 
Ok I do not usually comment on articles like this one but it sounds like this guy needs to do some more research. I have a great job w great benefit and I make a six figure income and have now for 12 years. I love what I do but I work a lot of hours and very long days. I got into visalus 3 months ago and I won the BMW the first month. I did not run out and get a BMW because I want to sustain my level and know that I will be able to maintain this level before I go buy or lease the car, but that just sounds like common sense to me. So far I have maintained that level and my business has grown every month. This is the easiest way to make money for anyone willing to work at it, yes I said work. If you call work having people(family, friends, etc.) over to your home and hang out and drink shakes, and watch a video that does most the selling for you. This is not the right thing for everyone but a lot of people need extra income right now, and I know this can work in the last 3 months I now have 30 distributors and 66 customers and 8 people have become directors and 3 of those will probably become regionals this month and win the car. So why am I doing this, because if I can replace my income with something I can do in half the hours per week and when I want to do it. It is called freedom!!!!!! I have 3 small children and how great would it be to spend more time with them, my family and friends. Life is full of opportunities try to see them, everything we do has negatives and last I heard unemployment it as at an all time high maybe people can not just run out and find a job. Also the product is awesome everyone I know has lost weight and felt better and it saves you money because it is a meal replacement. Where else can you spend less than 3 dollars for a meal. I think some of you guys just need to open your minds just a little bit. MLM can work and not all of them are the same again all I can say is do your research.
 MLMSCAM 
You contradict yourself very badly here…you say it is a lot of work (and it is), but then you go on to say it’s the easiest way to make money (in your obvious pitch). So which is it? You also say that all it is is having family and friends over, drinking shakes and the product sells itself (another obvious pitch)…what about attending challenge party after challenge party after challenge party, travel to this event here and that event there, constantly talking with downline trying to get them to sell and retain them as distributors, retaining customers, team calls, online“training”(which was pathetic BTW), back office work, social networking for hours, constantly and always trying to recruit…in other words you are always working…unlike my real job where I can leave work at work, and I actually have quality time to spend with my family, something I couldn’t do as a Visalus distributor.I just want people to know the truth instead of what they hear from a Visalus distributor.  I certainly have no complaints about my life: great full-time job with the federal government, pension, benefits, vacation, sick leave, tons of advancement, job security…you get none of that with Visalus…They try to tell you that you’re a business owner and an entrepreneur. Well, you don’t own your own business: you have no control over the product, over the compensation, over events, over the future of Visalus, even over your downline…you’re not an entrepreneur, you’re a sales associate. Every distributor you sign up is now your direct competition.

Bottom line: save your money, but especially save your time. It’s much better spent with your family than giving it to Visalus.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
I would never recommend this to an unemployed person (or really anyone for that matter), because first, they would have to shell out some serious cash to sign up and to maintain their monthly membership, and second, if you really want to cold call people (mostly friends and family) to try to get them to buy Visalus products (or sign them up as a distributor), you might as well get a job doing telemarketing and getting regular paycheques. Trust me, even at the ambassador level, where claiming you make 10K/month is a regular saying, you really only make about 10 to 16 bucks an hour when you account for all the time and money you invest getting to and maintaining that level.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Visalus prefers to be called MLM instead of pyramid…which is like saying callgirl instead of whore.

Fields i find it funny how you keep saying wait to see how much you are spending vs how much you are making. You only get charged for your kit if you have not earned for free. Get your facts straight…

I do not ever get involved in these arguments but after reading all these posts, i have  just have to intervene.
Subject: Visalus
Ok these are the facts.My best friend got me to try the shakes because i am a health freak and i have tried everything out there. I liked them…alot so then he pitched me. Knowing i would not get involved with a MLM company i did my research and ended up joining. I am glad i did so far so good. The shakes are the healthiest out there and i am watching day by day my friends lose weight and live a healthier life style. I received 3 checks and my product is free. There has been no extra charges to my c/c etc. Also i have had 2 distributors need to drop out for personal reasons they did on the 29th day of their first month and got a 100% refund. Here is the deal i did not get into this looking to retire from this or get a BMW. I do this because it is a great product and the system works its fun to have the parties and i do not sell people the dream. I tell them you will lose weight safely and you can make some money. By the way my friend has received his BMW status and is making an extra $1600.00 a month. Here the deal its a great product it is helping people get healthier and you can get your product for free. That is 100% legit facts. Can you make a great deal of money yes if you put the time in and you get lucky enough to have huge contact list of people. One thing i will say is that weight watchers is not a good product read the nutritional fact on their shakes.
Plus if you get all your friends to join what do you get out of it??? NOTHING so go on and make them money not your self…. This has been recognized by CNN MSNBC the Trump Org. etc as a great system. The proof is in the pudding as they say and there is a lot of pudding made…. Stop telling fabricated stories, sales is not for everyone and this is a sales job…..If you want to lie a healthier life then use the product it works, if you want to make some extra income then do it cuz it works, but don’t i dont suggest you quit your day job……

Its not rocket science folks! Why does a meal replacement work for weight-loss? You are replacing a larger calorie meal with a lower calorie meal. If you are taking good supplements or maybe adding healthy snacks while on any meal replacement shake program your body can maintain its muscle mass while on a program of this kind and the weight you lose is fat. Visalus is a business like many others to sell product to make money. Walmart sells thousands of products every hour of every day marks them up from their cost and none are calling the Walton empire a scam. That is a true pyramid. Regional Managers, District managers, General Managers, CEO’s CFO’s……blah blah blah! You can start there as a cashier and maybe even work your way up to CEO someday if you live long enough but its probably not going to happen. So many negatives about MLM’s, wow! If you think your JOB is great because they pay a portion of social security for you guess again cause they should pay that to you since the SS system is going bye bye. As far as your 401K program or matching company dividends whatever! Your paid time off, sick days that are used as days off by most who call in sick when they are not. Your profit sharing programs for upper level execs or your benefits paid by the company. You are so stupid because all of those things are figured in when they hire you based on what they expect for your production to be or how much they are making off you promoting their scheme. You see all companies make money by providing products or services even the one you are WORKING FOR! Instead of promoting the product they offer on TV, magazines, radio adds or even adding to all the hundreds of pounds of junk mail we all throw away each year by adding just one more flyer they pay promoters my advertising by word of mouth. We all promote things by word of mouth most days anyway. The movie you just saw and tell all your friends about, or the restaurant you“check-in”via Facebook, the theme park you email pictures of your family to your friends are all versions of promoting by word of mouth which is the best advertisement you could ever wish for as a business owner. Visalus pays its promoters for advertising for them. There is no magic pill or super natural ingredients but a system that when followed can assist people in losing weight gaining self confidence because they finally are losing weight without having to eat salad every meal and drink water. Duh! Most people don’t know how to prepare a healthy meal! If they did they wouldn’t be fat and need to lose weight in the first place. It’s easy to make a shake. Yes if they lose weight they may be able to reduce or stop taking certain medications. If they lose weight they also might start working out because of the new level of confidence. Visalus will give them their product for FREE if they have 3 people that are up for a challenge with them but they will not pay for your shipping so add about ten bucks to your free product, still no trip to the store so cool. Yes they want you to be on auto ship so they can plan for the future and make sure they have enough product to fill orders. Do people realize how much food this country throws away each day because of poor planning? Would the restaurants in this country throw away so much if they only took reservations and you had to see the menu on the web and order in advance for the party attending? Why would this be a bad thing? That’s what we do at home right? We plan our meals, go shopping and put a menu together for our family meals that week, right? Maybe some of you out there don’t plan the meals prior to going to the store so you end up buying a bunch of stuff you don’t need and end up buying a bunch of crap too and then wonder why you got fat? Seriously, groceries are costly especially when you try to eat healthy! Its cheaper to get fat than it is to stay thin at the grocery! So you find yourself in a situation where you realize you need to lose weight. What do you do? there are a lot of options out there and one of them is drinking meal replacement shakes. Visalus has good ones but they are not the only ones. You have the right to choose. They are the only ones you can get for FREE or win a cruise or a Hollywood vacation that I know of. When you do lose weight, and I hope you do, people are going to ask what you are doing different. Be honest and let them know and they will want to try it too. You just promoted it and could be receiving a check for your word of mouth advertisement. To get paid you either have to buy $125 of product for yourself each month or have $200 in customers product. You choose. You can get paid one of 8 ways. The company will not by you the car or lease it for you that is your job. They will pay you $300 extra when you reach the second level of the compensation plan and if you choose to get a Black BMW, new or used, lease or purchase, 2002 or newer then they will give you $600 extra as a bonus. I know if you don’t work your job like you want it you will lose it. I also know if you don’t work your business like a business you can lose it. Visalus is no different than having a franchise, except they don’t take royalties from your money that you collect like franchises do. I am a promoter and have been for 15 months. I have a 750LI that I drive daily which is paid for 100% by what I earn from the company. I have helped 34 others qualify for their car bonus too on my team of winners. We do have some losers on the team too. They quit before they get started just like every other aspect of there life but for a moment when they first signed  I saw some hope in their eyes right before they called and talked to one of their friends like you and killed the dream of maybe just maybe this will work for them too! Then finally those people that don’t want others to succeed sell them on a different“scam”and make them stop believing in themselves and they quit. The guy who signed me up never worked it and he quit. The guy who signed him up saw what I did and has finally now started following the system and just qualified for his car. The guy who signed him up was in another MLM that I said NO to and hasn’t really been able to get it going as well as he wanted to but only does promotions on face book. The guy above him is what you call a One Star Ambassador so he is doing well and the one above him is the same rank. As for me, I just made the level of One Star Ambassador too. I made a bit over 13K last month and there is no end in sight. I believe that I can get this level of income up to $150,000 per month by October of 2012. There are others making that now. If you don’t get it then no problem stay at your job! If you want to depend on Social Security no problem. If 67 is the age you want to retire then great. For me and others on my team I know there is more out there and this is a way that I can build true wealth and retire young. BTW, I lost 40 lbs over the last year and my wife lost 42 lbs. I did start going to a gym 3 weeks ago because I do have a new 90 day challenge. I am training to increase my muscle mass by 10 lbs. Its been a struggle but I will make it. I never would have gone to the gym the way I was before. The success I had for my weight loss has changed me in many ways. Wow, I just realized it is 5:26 am, I better go to bed. Even though I don’t have to get up at a certain time I still have things that I want to do in the morning like go jet ski. Things that I want to do like help my team reach their own next levels. I wish all that read this Vitality!

You always have something to work towards. I personally started at 601lbs, and am down to 504 now in 66 days, I feel better than ever, It’s given me the energy to leave the house again. I’ve gone from not being able to walk through the Mall parking lot without stopping for air, to swimming, walking daily, and going to the gym every morning. My skin’s cleared up, my dandruff *spelling?* has stopped.  At the end of the 90 I will still have plenty to lose, so I’ll start another 90 day challenge, When I get to my goal weight, maybe i’ll want to add more muscle, or work on jogging or something i’ve never been able to do before.  If you aren’t trying to better yourself every day, what are you doing with your days? You should always be on a 90-day Challenge, even if you aren’t doing the ViSalus program. I don’t care if I become the most fit person alive, I’m sure i’ll be able to think of something to challenge myself to get better at. People go on additional 90day Challenges because we love the way it makes us feel. Now, I’d love to stick around and read all the negative things you guys have to say about the people and program that has given me a shot of hope at living a normal life for a change, but I think i’ll go to the park and walk around after I have my breakfast shake. Have a good one!!

“Recognized by CNN, MSNBC, Trump Org…”MLM companies have been known to pay big bucks to have”celebrities”endorse their crap…Visalus is using Hulk Hogan right now…Hogan is a whore for money and would put his name on Depends adult diapers if the price was right.

Weight Watchers is all about counting calories and eating healthy, so telling people that WW is no good just shows how much of a brainwashed Visalus sales rep you are. Of course your friends are losing weight: it’s because they are consuming less calories by replacing 2 meals a day with shakes. You can do that without spending a fortune on Visalus shakes/products…count your calories, eat healthy and wholesome food. If you want to use a meal replacement shake, get one at the grocery store where they are much better priced and you don’t pay extra for shipping. Don’t listen to Visalus reps who claim their shake is the healthiest, best tasting, cures stuff BLAH BLAH BLAH…a Visalus rep just wants your money.

And that extra income a month you say you’re making (Visalus reps ALWAYS claim they make more than they actually do, it’s a selling technique), when you account for all the TIME and MONEY you invested to make that extra income, you probably made about 5 to 10 bucks an hour.  When most people go home from work, they like to spend quality time with their families and leave work at work. They don’t have time to telemarket every single person they know, attend challenge party after challenge party after challenge party, travel to this event here and that event there, constantly talk with their downline trying to get them to sell and retain them as distributors, retain customers, participate in team calls, take online“training”(which was pathetic BTW), complete back office work, social network for hours, constantly and always trying to recruit every single person they meet.

Bottom line: save your money, but especially save your time. It’s much better spent with your family than giving it to Visalus.

“Recognized by CNN, MSNBC, Trump Org…”MLM companies have been known to pay big bucks to have”celebrities”endorse their crap…Visalus is using Hulk Hogan right now…Hogan is a whore for money and would put his name on Depends adult diapers if the price was right.

Weight Watchers is all about counting calories and eating healthy, so telling people that WW is no good just shows how much of a brainwashed Visalus sales rep you are. Of course your friends are losing weight: it’s because they are consuming less calories by replacing 2 meals a day with shakes. You can do that without spending a fortune on Visalus shakes/products…count your calories, eat healthy and wholesome food. If you want to use a meal replacement shake, get one at the grocery store where they are much better priced and you don’t pay extra for shipping. Don’t listen to Visalus reps who claim their shake is the healthiest, best tasting, cures stuff BLAH BLAH BLAH…a Visalus rep just wants your money.

And that extra income a month you say you’re making (Visalus reps ALWAYS claim they make more than they actually do, it’s a selling technique), when you account for all the TIME and MONEY you invested to make that extra income, you probably made about 5 to 10 bucks an hour.  When most people go home from work, they like to spend quality time with their families and leave work at work. They don’t have time to telemarket every single person they know, attend challenge party after challenge party after challenge party, travel to this event here and that event there, constantly talk with their downline trying to get them to sell and retain them as distributors, retain customers, participate in team calls, take online“training”(which was pathetic BTW), complete back office work, social network for hours, constantly and always trying to recruit every single person they meet.

Bottom line: save your money, but especially save your time. It’s much better spent with your family than giving it to Visalus.

I have done the research and seen it in action.  When a Rep( the company doesn’t recornize as a Rep) runs out of family and friends they start to get desperate and that is when the lying and conning really starts.  They become such pests they drive everyone crazy. I saw on a weight lifting site that the lifters said Visalus was not any good it was made with cheap products and didn’t work. Also it had a product tha could be dangerous to some. But the Reps(?) always start lying about how much they have lost and how much they have made.  I would wait on that BMW it is probably going to all start falling apart soon.
 Izzy 
Not exactly like Avon etc. at least they had useful products. And they did not teach you to lie and to con your family.
 Izzy 
You have expenses like gas to get to parties, going to their meetings everywhere, taxs, web site, the $500-$1000 for getting into it to start. And then you get to convince everyone to be your cmpetition. Keeping those three is not as easy as you would think. Your customers are coming to their senses and quitting and the others you are converting from customer to competition.
 Izzy 
I don’t beleive a word of this. But if it is true good for you how many people did you have to scam.  I’ll keep my job with all it’s draw backs like vacation, sick days, health insurance ( Oh by the way do you have any?) , 401K, etc.  Answer me one question why don’t people just order it off of Amazon and there is no shipping charge over $25. Who wants to carry around milk, blender, add ins etc. They really should put some money into product development. How much are your taxes?  How did you get that lease? When this bites the dust what are you going to put on your resume?
 Izzy 
Whose kool-aid have you been drinking? CNN MSNBC may have recognized them as a scam but not as a business model. They do not recognize or recommend any business or business model unless they are buying air time.  Some one is giving you a lot of Hockie. As far as Trump who knows what he is going to recognize but I doubt even doubt that.  I would have to have proof from your friend.  They use every trick and con in the book.  They plan ways to scam their friends and families. It is like a cult that convinces each other it is just business. This is not a sales job. When you have a job the company recognizes you as an employee Visalus doesn’t. A job gives you a benefit packages and pays taxes for you Visalus doesn’t.  Ask your friend how much he has spent with Visalus and because of Visalus Travel etc.
 OneStarAmb 
Hi Izzy. It matters not to me whether you believe any of this or not. You should keep your job because you like it and what it brings you. That’s great! I personally don’t have paid days off or paid sick days as you would understand however I have not worked today at all. I woke up around 10:30 am and took a shower. Then I had a shake for breakfast and went to my sons high school. He had a problem with his schedule for some reason but we got it worked out. After that we went to a sub shop for lunch and then went by a friends house to look at the puppies they have for sale. Cute dogs, they are a mix between a poodle and chiwawa. My wife was already there so it was fun. Now I’m home but I will be going to a challenge party tonight to help some new folks in the business. I pay my own taxes and have a couple of IRA’s. I did make money today because the team did a bit over $17,000 in business in the last 24 hours. Why don’t people just order it on Amazon? I guess the company could sell directly to the end user like some others but that is not what they chose to do. I don’t carry around milk and things to add in to the shake. If I’m not home I use a shaker bottle that I got from the gym to mix protein shakes in. Usually I have 2 servings if I mix it in that because I usually mix with water. So that shake is more cost than the ones I make at home but still less money than an unhealthy meal that I would get at the drive through. I really love it because for me it just makes sense. As for the car I bought it and have a loan. The payment is $540 and one of the bonuses I get is $600 so that more than pays for it. As far as my resume you ask? When I started Visalus I was a business owner. I have not ever worked for another person or company since getting out of the military. I hated that fealing of being owned. I will always own my own life because I can. Sure it would be easy to go get a job and work for others but my reason to work for myself has always been FREEDOM. I come from a well educated family, father has his doctorate, mother has a masters and a specialist education degree on top of that, sisters both have masters, and my brother is a paramedic. I have a high-school diploma. What I have that none of them ever had was the will to be self employed. The will to believe in myself. Last year I made more than all of them put together but that is not a new thing. I did that before getting involved with Visalus. Best wishes to you. I hope for all that read this Vitality.


 Izzy 
Your ex-husband has been with the company a year and half. Congradulations LOL. That is longer than anyone I have heard of staying in before it fell apart.
 Fields 
Amd they encouraged to go the $1000 route and to also buy promotional products. They have to pay for travel expenses to challenge parties and their monthly meetings. Whoa……
 Izzy 
Check out Amazon, Visalus is sold there and no shipping charges.  What you sell is people wanting a get rich quick scheme. You did not answer do you have health insurance, does your children? Maybe your wife provides all this for you or do you think if any thing happens the government will take care of me.  We are not talking about freedom, real freedom is free from worrying about your future, you are talking about irresponsibily. The truth is that this stuff’s market is to saturated and the only ones who will end up buying it is the people selling.
 Izzy 
Who pays for the car loan if you don’t make your quota. Your wife muct have a job otherwise you would never have got the loan.
 Fields 
You are really spewing the brainwashing you received. One minute you are saying you have to work hard and the next minute you don’t have to do anything but to sit back and let your team work. It is so sad you are peddling a get rich scheme that takes other peoples money with your pitch and preying on people with bad body images and real needs. You Visalus people always jack up the amount of weight you loose and the amount of money you make.
 OneStarAmb 
“You Visalus People”, thanks, Ill take that as a complement! Looks like you need to read again. I never said that I work hard one minute and the next I let the team do all the work. Visalus is not a get rich quick scheme. It’s a meal replacement program. We base it on a 90 day challenge because everyone can focus on something for 90 days if they have a goal to reach. No, I didn’t inflate the numbers either in the weight loss or the income. I’m actually one of the lowest paid One Star Ambassadors. Most of the others in my position are making over $15K a month. That is a good living but definitely not rich. As far as preying on people, are you serious? I am just a messenger letting people know that there are options.
 OneStarAmb 
I have never missed qualifying for the car bonus since we originally got it September of last year and don’t plan to because that is one of the lowest levels in the company and I am one of the highest. No, my wife doesn’t have a job and getting a loan is easy even in a bad economy if you have always had good banking relationships like we have. We have great credit so it has never been a problem. I bought my first home in 1994 at the age of 21. It was a real piece but it was mine. I hope for all who read this, Vitality.
 OneStarAmb 
I looked on Amazon and do see that some of the other promoters are offering the product on that sight. That is what they choose to do but I promise you that the shipping is not FREE. Someone is paying for it and it might even be the promoter is some case. I’m sure they just take it out of the commission they receive after all we doo get paid very well for customers. Last month on my team we had 348 of them. Customers that is. Cool huh? That’s almost as many promoters we had last month on the team. That number was only 507. 126 of them made around $500 last month. 33 of them have gotten the BMW bonus and make an average of $1,800 per month. 6 of them got to the next level where the company is paying them to go to L.A. and hang out with the founders (great young guys by the way) for the weekend and they average $4,000 a month. 2 of them made it to the next level where they will have an all expense 3 day vacation somewhere tropical. When we went they put us up in the Ritz Carlton, it was so fun because we had about 300 people there and really took over the place. Great Party! Oh, and yes I do have insurance. We pay for it ourselves like any other“Self Employed”person. We haven’t always had it but for the last 6 years we have been able to afford it especially now that individual plans are not too expensive in Florida. Yes, my children are on the plan too. In prior years we bought insurance through the school system for them. They didn’t cover the parents but at least they had it. I never once thought that if my plans failed that I would expect others or the government to take care of me. I don’t think highly those who manipulate our well-fare system and would even know where to start if I needed assistance. I do have REAL FREEDOM and never“worry about my future”as you say. I am very responsible and I plan for my future. Most people don’t plan. I, am not most people. As far as the market being saturated? It’s not yet but that is the goal! Visalus will be a household name one day, even around the globe. We just launched in Canada and have“PLANS”for at least 21 other countries. I think we are on our way to helping many people change their lives for the better. Thanks for all who read this and I wish you Vitality.

As a self employed person you do pay your own taxes. Also as a self employed person you get to write off many things and pay tax on what is net income instead of gross income. So my travel expenses are not part of my income they are an expense. You would need to be self employed to realize the tax advantages so I don’t blame you for feeling the way you do. My health insurance for my family is a business expense also, just as it is for an employer. I wish for all that read this Vitality.

A weight lifting site downing another business? Wow, what a professional company! You should definitely take advice from them! Seriously? You are smarter than that. Did you down them for taking steroids too? Or commend them for building muscle the natural way? Everyone can think of excuses not to do anything. Even an excuse to not jump on a great opportunity when it presents itself. Luck happens when opportunity meets preparation. I wish for all that read this, Vitality.
 OneStarAmb 
That is why you are known as“Ex-Visalus Distributor”, because you think every one you sign up is your direct competition. If you signed them up they are part of your team. I built a team with positive like minded forward thinking people. You speak and think like an employee and that is why you are one. It’s OK that you weren’t able to make it happen, some people just don’t have it in them to follow through with what they start. Some of of do. I wish for all that read this, Vitality.

You should look up the meaning of the word cult.“refers to a group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre”I don’t think it means what you think it does. If what we are doing is abnormal or bizarre then sign me up again! Helping others change their live for the better both physically, and financially. Yea, thats awful!

Thank you for saying,“long story shorter….the product is just ONE of HUNDREDS of ways to get fit PERIOD!!”At least you agree in that we are an option for those looking. As far as making money, as with most businesses not all promoters of the challenge will be out of the red in only days, weeks, or even months. However that is exactly what we experienced. I have not paid for my product in 15 months, never missed a month of my BMW bonus and achieved the rank of One Star Ambassador last month and made 13K. No scam here, just great business. I wish for all that read this, Vitality.

You should really look up the definition to the word“Cult”. I don’t think it means what you think it does. Why would the hundreds fail again? PArtial market penetration and growing! Just this year in January around 14,000 joined the challenge. Just last month over 67,000 people joined the challenge. Yes, we are penetrating very well. Those who can’t do should move out of the way of those who can. I wish for all that read this, Vitality.

Congrats on going from fat to fit! You are right that exercise and eating right are the best way but let’s be honest. If exercise and eating right was so easy then we would be a country full of fat people. Most of us are not stay at home parents and haven’t been taught to eat properly or in some cases even how to cook a healthy meal. A meal replacement is exactly that, a meal replacement. It was designed to work for all, even the lazy ones, the too busy to exercise ones, the ones that only will do it the easy way. As far as the money to throw away? It’s a meal replacement ( i think i said this already), if you are currently eating (i think most people do that are living) then you actually save money replacing that meal with a shake that only costs $1.87. Oh yea, by the way, we also offer a 3 for FREE program. FYI :) I wish for all that read this, Vitality.

You are so right!“fruits and veggies and REAL food and exercising. It is simple but
nobody wants to do the work to be healthy. They want a slim-quick plan

Broke, employee, JOB mentality, no business experience, must have been told“NO”a lot. These are just a few things that come to mind after reading your post. Why is it you think being an employee is so cool these days? Have you not seen all the companies out sourcing to other countries? Do you not see all the people getting let go in this economy? Maybe having built an additional income would have saved some of the foreclosures. Start really looking at the big picture. There are choices out there other than the one you chose. At least they are attempting to make a positive difference. That’s what I’m doing right now, attempting. Be nice to each other. I wish all that read this, Vitality.

Sorry put I do know taxs and tax advantage and I have owned my own business.  Your families health insurance is not a business expense. Try that and the IRS will come calling.  Yes your travel and etc are business expenses and can be wrote off but be careful that you don’t have more expenses than income. This has happened to several people who did well and then started losing business and spent thinking they could get more business and came out in the hole.
 Izzy 
It was just as site started by weight lifters and they just mentioned Visalus in passing.  They weren’t selling anything.
 Izzy 
That was not my post. Life is full of chooses.  I chose not to lie , cheat, scam, take advantage of someone’s poor body image, take advantage of ones financial troubles and add to them and I choose not to pester the hell out of friends and family..

A pyramid scheme is a non-sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment, services or ideals, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme or training them to take part, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public
This supplies a product or service. So it isn’t a Pyramid Scheme.
 OneStarAmb 
A corporation owns my Visalus distributorship and I am an officer of the corporation and it does pay for my health insurance.

Some promoters may pester the hell out of friends and family but I don’t. That is not good business. I simply found a way I could help others improve their lives and have done just that. I am just the messenger. As with all messages you can choose to read or not, you can choose to believe or not, as you can also choose to succeed or not. If you call helping those who would have otherwise still been unhealthy or over weight using our product in the same way they can use others because they want to change their self image that is your choice. They make the decision to change, I didn’t make it for them. I only promote a challenge. What they decide to do with it is up to them.
 OneStarAmb 
Thanks for clearing up his garble. We have almost as many customers as we do promoters. They collect the information and choose what they do with it. Some choose to be on the challenge and take a chance at even winning cash cruises and such. Others decide to be promoters and add additional income to the home. Others only choose the challenge but would like to get with a group of friends and at least get the product for free. Choices people, we all have them, you have to make yours.
 Fields 
Yes you do, if you want to just sell enough to be able to sell to get your product free that will be $49 If you want to sell and get a commission and money for BMW you have to pay $500-$1000 (depending how far you want to go) for that previlege. You have to buy or sell $200 amonth to stay active. You have to sign up for $125 auto ship and if you don’t sell three people you get to pay for it. You have to get enhance web site $29 amonth. You have to buy promotional supplies, you have to pay your travel, etc.. Yes you can deduct expenses except auto ship if you make enough to pay for them to start with. Oh yea don’t forget Uncle Sam the social security and medicare is on all you receive and you have to pay both side, so take appx 15% off the top.  Sure sounds like nothing.  If you really want to complicate your life go lease or buy a BMW that is if you can without that bad old job.  They’ll give you $600 amonth for it as long as you keep 3 legs and your team makes $12500 and only 1 leg can make 60% of it.  Don’t make it and the payment is yours. You might have to go out and get one of those evil old jobs.

How did you find the weight lifters site? Are you too looking for a way to lose some of those unwanted pounds and you would like to do it the fastest, easiest, healthiest way possible but don’t have the time to eat healthy 100% of the time like most over worked under paid Americans? Sounds like you might be up for a challenge! My suggestion is to find a program that fits in your budget, that is simple and easy to follow and won’t cause any undesired extra stress in your life. Add a bit more exercise in to your days and set some goals. Visalus is an option but there are many options so choose the one that feels right for you. I wish all that read this, Vitality.

The only ones who get left behind are the lazy, job minded, hourly or salary minded people that don’t have the grit to be successfully self-employed. You have bought all the lies you were brought up being told. The Script you are speaking is not how it always was in this country. The whole get a good education, go to college, find a good job, work for forty plus years has been sold to people in this country since the Great Depression. I bet some of the people who have lost their jobs and homes and 401K’s and lives over the last few years have wished they had been self-employed so they had some control over what happens to them. I wish for all who read this, Vitality.

You are so far gone there is no way to get to you. But please make sure that you do have a saving account if you are making that kind of money now because belief me it will not last.  Those nice young men had another pyramid scheme before this one involving long distance when it fell they started this one and when this falls they will start another. If this product is so great why is it not in stores? Why do you have to recruit your own competition if it is a sales job.  They are just fooling you and you are just fooling yourself if you think you own a business.  I still don’t see how you got a loan if you or your wife don’t have job or a real business with real assets.
 Fields 
You keep contradicting yourself If you have formed a INC you better have that checked out, there are rules to forming a corporation.  Everyone gets to count their business expenses that are not reimmersed by the company you work for (most do when you have a JOB so you don’t have to count it off. you get more benefit that way then just writing it off as a deduction). You should talk to your accountant if you have one, because if you are counting it off as a expense  for the corp. you must also count it as income for yourself as an employee of said corp..  Also you do not have a Visalus Distutorship they don’t have any if they did then they would have some liabilty for them and Visalus does not admit anyone is in a business relationship (check your contract) because they do not want any kind of liabilty.  As far as they are concerned you don’t exsist only your money does. If you own your own business you have all the liabilty for everything.
 Izzy 
Distributorship????? Visalus won’t even asmit you work for them or respresnt them.  They won’t even admit they asked you to sell or that they asked you to get others to sell for them.  To have Corporation don’t you have to have some assets; building, inventory, patents, something…….
 Izzy 
No I wasn’t looking for a weight lifting site, I was searching for this one and the word Visalus just jumped out at me . Having an inquiring mind I checked it out
 Izzy 
The ones who have lost the most have been self employed. They have sold you the fairy tale that you are self employed. As far as being lazy I think people who are willing to lie and scam people are the ones who are lazy. They are to lazy and don’t have the grit to get out and hold a job. Make it sound so important to be self enployed. You do not own any buildings, inventory, patents, name rights, or any other assets. A scammer is a scammer no matter what they call themself. You hurt people even though you talk about helping people. Search the soul you might not have sold and admit it you hurt people.
 Izzy 
Simply you hurt people look around you. If you did not hurt people I would have no problem with it.  MLMs hurt people.

I’m very saddened that there are people out there who will take this article as 100% fact and won’t go out and do their own research, and thus will miss out on an incredible opportunity.

Always make up your own mind using facts from several different sources. Common Sense 101! :)
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Did you even read any of my posts? Or even my handle? what I say is fact, because I’ve been there, done that with Visalus…read my posts under“Ex-Visalus Distributor”…it’s funny how none of you pro-Visalus people are responding to my posts…it’s because you know I speak the truth.

You say“do your research”, but provide no resources. Plus, when you google“Visalus”, most of the hits that come up are blogs from people doing online marketing (or funneling), trying to drive traffic to their selling site.

Bottom line people: save your money, but especially save your time. It’s much better spent with your family than giving it to Visalus.

Hey OneStar, read my posts under“Ex-Visalus Distributor”…
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
I’m an“Ex”distributor, because I’ve seen the light. I made some money with Visalus, but it certainly was not worth the huge amount of time.

lol!  You built a team…yeah,ok…you’re making money off the failures of others…that’s exactly how the pyramid works.

Oh yeah, and I find it hilarious that because I’m not with Visalus anymore, you consider me someone who doesn’t follow through with things…you obviously know nothing about me, and to make that kind of judgement just shows the class of people MLMs deal with. You are either with them, or against them.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
lol!  Sure, just work 24 hrs a day like a Visalus sales rep, never spend time with your family or friends, lie about how much money you make and live the Vi-Life!

Thank you so much for all your posts and your tact…not all posters are as polite as you.  I was raised that college was the only thing to do.  My husband went to college, had a fantastic job with great benefits and we had plenty…I didn’t need to work.  Then the economy tanked and most jobs went over seas and now he’s been unemployed for 2 years. Sales is very hard.  Selling anything whether a product like visalus, tupperware, avon, marykay, or working at the mall for a cell phone company or even at a bank is hard.  There is some type of selling in any job and it usually sucks.  But if you can just deal with it…think some will, some wont, so what and move on  you can create a successful business for yourself and family without conning anyone.  Some are interested and some are not…you don’t have to lie to be successful.  Just find someone who is interested.  It’s not a get rich quick scheme, its an opportunity to work for yourself, set your own schedule, and accomplish what you want to at your own pace.  I’m not saying its easy but its possible.  Just a little support OneStarAmb.  Thanks.

I’m new to the whole visalus thing…but I’m in love with the products…and i’ve already lost weight, but this isn’t about me….the company itself doesn’t tell you, you have to pay the 500$ to be in the bimmer club to make money, all you have to do to make any money at all, is simply get 3 people to become distributors, who in turn each find 3 people to become distributors, and so on and so on…the more people working under you the more money you make. so for 50$ and maybe another 50$ to get“testers”you can market the product…i’m already making 200$ a week, and I only payed for the 50$ distributorship plan….i have no need or want of a bmw or do i want to spend 500$ on a program I don’t know if i’ll even go that far in…but seeing as how i’m in a small rural area (less then 20,000 people) and there are over 70 visalus distributors in this area alone, i feel i’m doing a pretty good job selling something. I’m not looking for a full time career out of this MLM I just wanted to make a little cash on the side while working part time and in school full time…its easy, its fun, im losing weight and i’m making money….i may not be at the top of the food chain, but for me its not about that…i’m sorry to the poster of this but just because YOU believe its a scam and doesn’t work, etc….doesn’t mean the same for everybody. Also….i plan on moving next year, and i’ve been told and shown countless times that moving means nothing…i’m still in the program and i don’t lose anything provided i keep my clients…so i don’t know where you got that info but its wrong….

90% of bussiness are owned by people who are self employed and the only make up for 10% of income…yes, self emplyed people financially loose over corporations but if so many people strive for self-employement  money must not be everything

Izzy its Vi SHakes not kool ade. If you did your research which you have not. CNN business has stated it is not a scam. Trump organization Ivonka on MSNBC clearly stated that Visalus has done their homework and has turned into a creditable business. No one has told me anything i witnessed these my self. No one is feeding my lies. When ever invest in something i do the research and get the facts. I owned 3 of my own successful businesses. I am a GM of a restaurant now and work about 55 hours a week i do this because iam getting people to live a healthier life and making some extra income and its fun. You all act out about it not being a real job and taxes and blah blah blah. A job is anything you have to work at yes? so it is a job. We are selling a product and a challenge to lose weight yes? so it is sales. When year is up we receive a 1099 from visalus there for we are independent contractors. Where in the world do independent contractors get health ins, benefits etc. As for my friend and i besides the cost of the distributor package and a few dollars for business cards we have not incurred any more expenses, traveling is part of the job. Visalus has made a great product better then any other out there and the 90 day challenge is a great system it is saving and changing lives safely. Do your self a favor and really take a look what your knocking, if people do not want to do this then they do not have to, but if people want to do it then they will. As far as Visalus not admitting i work, sell or am affiliated with the company is a little far fetched. I had a customer call up for support for her website and they knew exactly who i was and the real funny thing is every month when i receive my check its funny wait for it…. it has visalus co. and my name on it and its sign by the CEO and you know whats even funnier besides you and your haters? my bank cashes it. OMG really enough said if you. Heres what i think all of you thought you could punch a time card take your 30 min break and then get a check at the end of the week. Opps you were mistaken and now your pissed off that every one who is doing it is succeeding. This MLM is not for every one and it not a 40 hour  a week job you get what you put into it. So stop making an azz out of your self stop knocking a great nutritional product and weight lose system and get a second job if you extra time on your hands. Maybe if you put all this hate and bashing into being a distributor you could have been successful.

Izzy are you seeing what your writing…. This is an independent contractor job…get a grip if your going to post something at least know wtf your talking about.

Ok weight Watchers really !!!! talk about paying celeb’s to endorse something.Unless you live on mars you do not do something or buy something just because a celeb endorses it, you do your research.  First off if you think WW is good than your the retard. Its all processed crap loaded with sodium, cholesterol, sugar, etc. Yeah they put you on a point system to help you learn to eat better, but it actually teaches you to be able to eat your junk food. Do you realize that people skip meals during the day so they can have that loaded sodium piece of Salisbury steak and a piece of chocolate lava cake for dinner.Yeah thats a healthy system. the funny thing also is that it does help you lose weight but when you go to your annual physical the doctors says whats going on you look good but you cholesterol is high you sugar levels are of etc. Next time you want to discuss a product don’t do it with a person who has been a cert personal trainer and married to a RN also cert nutritionist. I work about 55 hours with my full time job then i put in about 15 hours a week for Visalus and my checks are about  $800 a month. So do the math i get about $13 an hour. This is not work to me its fun and i am helping people get healthier and wealthier and i m getting $800.a month to do it. Like i said to dizzy i mean izzy maybe if you spent all your free time and effort like your doing all this site and put into Visalus then maybe you would have been successful. Oh by the way did you know that Visalus is excepted into the Weight Watchers point system…..its like -2 pts…do you homework before you run your mouth little boys.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Whoa!  I never, ever called you a retard, so enough with the flamethrowing…I must have hit a nerve with you…

I’m happy for you that you like it so much, and I wish you all the luck…BTW, I was not talking about WW shakes, I was referring to their point system…and I certainly do not remember Visalus saying anything about a point system, so I have no idea what you’re talking about.

And you just proved my point about the money VS time…sorry, but I make enough money at my full time job that I don’t have to waste time peddling and MLM…I’d much rather spend that time with family and friends…

How embarassing it is to cold call people to try to sell them“health”products. But if you like it, then kudos to you. I wish you all the luck

I agree, I’m sure there are great, even possibly cheaper ways to go about it. But none of them worked for me, I can’t cook. I was 600lbs due to poor willpower and nutritional ignorance. Since starting Vi at the beginning of July I am down 102lbs, 9 inches in my hips, 1ft 2in in my chest, and 1ft in my waist. I’ve gone from spending about 30$ combined for Breakfast and Lunch to spending around 8$. Since starting I’ve learned what is healthy to eat and what isn’t. So when I’m finished with my weight loss, which will be a long way off, but none the less now possible, I can begin to maintain that weight with my new habits, and exercise routines. Sure, not everyone that signs up is going to get a BMW, who cares. I don’t want a car, I tell my friends about it because they ask me. I don’t push the product. I’m not trying to argue, I’m just saying if you wanna sit around and poke holes in something you can, nothing is flawless. But this is working for me, and working for many many others when nothing else has. I can’t imagine if I’d found this page and seen all the negative comments…i’d still be in hell.. makes me sad to think about it.

Like everybody else you just got in it. Be very careful.it will snowball on you.  You said you live in a small rural place and it it already over saturated. Just be very careful before you are in to deep. Keep your soul
 Fields 
Don’t you even know enough to know that Weight Watchers is a point system. Each food has an amount of points alotted to it so you eat regular food and count your points and they have a support system.  There is no meal repacement shakes or any of that foolishness.
 Izzy 
You have drunk a lot of the kool-aid, you do not make any sense and your math is awful.  Just the kind of person for an MLM
 Izzy 
what are you saying? I know what an independant contractor is. You are an independant contractor if you want to stretch the meaning. No one just because they want to be a corporation can go say make a corporation there are some legal qualifications to it. If there is a corporation established and you are a officer of that corporation than the corporation has to file tax returns for that corporation and the officier has to file personal tax forms.  Bet ya know more than you do.  This is what I do. But I will not call you any names I think your words speak for you.
 Fields 
I would not talk to much about weight lifters and steroids since Visalas spokeman is a documented steroid user and wife beater.
 Izzy 
no money is not everything.  Feeling good about yourself and what you are doing is important. Security is important  enjoying your life is important. doing no harm is important.  Not everyone strives for self-employment Most people strive for different levels of financial security.  I have fought all my life for the people who are bulled and taken advantage of. I do not like MLM because they take advantage of people who are in need for the most part. Lif lessons have told me that the easiest people to sell to are the people who can least afford it because they are so desperate to make their life better.  It is sad what humans are willing to do to other humans for their own gain

I was talking about the company paying for your health insurance if they pay it you have to count as income on your personal income taxs
 Izzy 
I have no only love for my fellow man, that is why I try to save everyone some heart ache.  Sure everyone has a right to do what they want but I think they should be aware that they are being lied to, conned, and scammed which is what is being done to you.  I don’t know what kind of make believe world you live in. If anyone is interested in losing weight I would suggest that first you have to come to terms with who you are and like yourself for what ever your weight is. Then look at your outside and do it to get healthy as stated many times before eat healthy (really food we were meant to chew and have variety in our food, looks and aroma is important in satisfying out hunger) If you don’t know how to cook healthy there aare a lot of cookbooks out there and you have to have exercise to be healthy (you choose nice long walks are great).  This business is a pyramid MLM business is designed to scam.  I have never had my questions answered 1. Why do they try to sell you all the vitamins ( We all know vitamins are best gotten from food and most of the vitamins we take as supplements go out of our bodies as waste), appititite suppressions ( You say the shakes are such a great weight loss product) the ad ins. and the rest. 2. Why do you have to recruit your own competition if it is such a great sales job. 3.  Why is it not sold in stores ( could it be that it could not compete with similar products in price and quality)..
 Fields 
All the visalus people have the same chant. Even that it is not for everyone. Everyone I have seen envolved in this stuff I would certainly describe their behaver as abnormal and bizarre, cultlike.
 Izzy 
You really are delusional. Do you always hear things that are not there. You are on their AP list so what does that prove. You get a 1099 that is for tax purposes. You have to pay SS both sides on that.  Any one you pay over $600 a year, you have to send them a 1099 even if they mop your floors.
 Scam 
I am very saddened that there will be people who wont take this article seriously and waste a lot of time and money in a hopeful get-rich-quick scam. I have looked into it A LOT, been asked by everybody and their dog for me to get in on it because I am an entrepreneurial kind of person. This is complete bologna and you have to wonder if they offer you a car to try to get in quick, is it really too good to be true? Yes it is. And their science is crap. If I were to use any protein shake on the market it would be Isagenix with their proven fact that you body uses 97% of the shake and only 3% waste. I’d LOVE to hear how much waste is in this product that will soon be stored up into fat. Keep dreaming people. You are only losing weight as you are currently minimizing the overeating you used to do on large meals and now have a better set eating schedule.

But hey.. at least it tastes good.
 RD 
Angel sounds like she’s had some bad experiences with network marketing, or she plainly doesn’t have any idea about sales or network marketing…

My dad is 55 yrs old, was 250 lbs, and has diabetes.  After the first month of taking the visalus products, he is taking less medication for his diabetes, has lost 20 lbs, and is now much healthier and going strong.  You guys need to do your research before you post.  Just because you can’t make it in this industry, doesn’t mean others can’t either.  People like Angel are always going to hate on people because they are jealous at what others have, they never had the skill for network marketing, or they are people that never go out and don’t have a social life.

My brother has been in visalus for 3 months, he’s currently a ND in the company, about to skip PD and jump to Ambassador this month. As for myself, I just broke RD in my first month.  We’ve been in Network Marketing back before cell phones came out, from selling long distance, to home supplies, etc.  Of course those companies never worked out, but as for Visalus, it is the real deal.  You can get healthy and Wealthy at the same time.  And if you can’t work with this company, then you must be dumber than rocks.  I had a 1.55 gpa and if I can do it, anybody can.  I also work full time at my other job working 50 hrs a week, which I don’t plan on doing much longer because I can help people get healthy and lose weight, and make some extra money with it.

Multi-level marketing is a business model where you pay for the opportunity to sell a company’s product and alienate your friends.Just The FactsMulti-level marketing is very much like a barely legal form of a pyramid scam
You will learn how to lose friends and scare people with high pressure MLM sales tactics

99% of consumers who join a MLM company never make a profit.
How it Works At one time or another, we have all been exposed to multi-level marketing although we may not have been aware of it at the time or may not recognize it by that term. There are thousands of different MLM schemes that exist today. They may offer different products, but the underlying business model remains the same: you pay a fee to become a distributor, gain access to product at wholesale pricing which you then sell to your friends and family.

The product is just a front for the real money-making potential, which is had by signing up other distributors below you and earning a commission on what they sell. The potential for earning money is virtually limitless; if you sign up six friends, and each of those friends sign up six more friends, and so on and so on, you could be earning serious cash–awesome right?

No one likes to feel they have made a mistake and endorsed a company they will later wish they hadn’t. or referred friends and family.
 Jackalope 
My first post here…I decided to do some research because a friend on Facebook is constantly hawking ViSalus stuff. It’s very annoying but I usually just ignore it…however, today she re-posted a testimonial from a customer who’s tachychardia has suddenly diminished because of ViSalus products!! Now that got me worried. Even on ViSalus’own website they say this (in very small type):

*ViSalus™ products are not evaluated by the Food and
Drug Administration. These products are not intended to diagnose,
treat, cure or prevent any disease.

Note: You should not take this product
if you are pregnant or lactating, or using blood thinning medication.
Please consult your physician prior to use.

Apart from all the anecdotal“evidence”that this stuff“will cure what ails ya”(snake oil anyone?) is there anything different from this MLM model than any of the others?? Sounds a lot like JavaFit, Amway, Herbalife, etc., to me…

I’m amazed that people constantly have to be educated as to what an MLM is and how it works. If you are not on the ground floor you will likely never make it rich.

I can tell you that I started Bodybyvi after starting chemotherapy.  I was struggling with lethargy and have a 6 month old AND my husband is deployed. So, I needed something that would help! 4 days after starting my shakes, my headaches went away, I haven’t vomited since and I have more energy than before I had my child.  I haven’t lost an astronomical amount of weight, but I’ve only been doing it for 2 weeks now and wasn’t expecting to. I know better, I have a degree in health and physical education.  But, knowing that I have the energy to spend time with my child and take care of the way he deserves makes me a firm believer in this product.  I’d like to know what everyone else here who has something negative to say about ViSalus is doing to make money and live a healthier lifestyle.
 Carrie 
You must be selling another product and have decided to bad mouth ViSalus because I’ve been doing it for a week and have 8 clients already.  Everyone here wants it and I haven’t been able to put my phone down for more than an hour before someone else has a question about it.  If you need help, ask your upline…your success is their success.
 Izzy 
They give outrageous testimonials that what ever they are selling will cure everything just to sell their stuff. That is what I don’t like about MLM they turn decent people into con men. They encourage each other and get together to come up with these stories. They end up in debt and wondering how it happened.

I think all the ex distributors and families of distibutors are to be commended for sharing their hard earned knowledge of MLMs and Visalus. I don’t it could not be easy. One thing that bothers me is the hostility that Visalus people have toward anyobe (including family and friends) who try to share their knowledge with them and warn them.  It is like they are so brainwashed that something is inside them. They blabber this same spill. It worries me that there maybe an occassion for violence if they snag the wrong person. It has happened. Why do they think that people who disagree with them who are only trying to help others from making the mistakes that they have made or seen up close made are haters, negative, are bad people making the world a bad place, losers, etc.  And that working for a living that you have prepared yourself for and enjoy and appreciate the benefits that having a job gives you is bad.  Something is not right.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Thanks Izzy, that is much appreciated. And you’re absolutely right: you’re either with them, or you’re their enemy.

When someone like myself, who has done the Visalus thing and knows what it’s really about, writes on a blog like this, all the pro-Visalus people say I couldn’t do it because it’s not in me to do it, or I don’t follow through, or that I’m just a bad salesman. The people who have never tried MLM  and write on this blog against MLM, the pro-Visalus people call them negative, lazy and uninformed. So there is no grey matter with MLMs: you’re with them or against them.

I’m so embarassed that I used to call people and tried to sell them Visalus products and tell them about the“opportunity”. I hate the fact that I wasted so much time on Visalus, but I’m happy I saw the light and don’t do it anymore. I enjoy writing on this blog, writing the truth about Visalus and MLM in general. I feel like I’m actually helping people, instead of ripping them off, as people do when they are part of an MLM.

I just purchased a Shape Kit from a Friend of a Friend, I have not desire to be a“distributor”but a great desire to jump start some weight loss. I could see right away the whole“earn money”scheme was similar to the old Amway pitch. I’ll be happy just to drop a couple extra pounds for my cruise in November. Thanks for the blog–reminds me not to believe everything I read on web sites…. loved the idea of a BMW tho!
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Good for you for seeing through their“opportunity”and recognizing a typical MLM…if you want to save even more money, you can buy meal replacement shakes at the grocery store or health food store…you’d also save money on the shipping…plus, if you go on Visalus’autoship, you will end up with more shake than you know what to do with…and, they will keep shipping it to you (and charging your credit card) until you tell them to stop (it’s not just for 90 days as they claim).

I wish you all the luck with your weight management and hope you have a great time (and body to match) on your cruise!

PS: The BMW is one of the things that sucked me in…keep doing what you’re doing and don’t fall for it like I did.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Don’t believe everything you hear on the Internet. People promoting their MLM are emotionally vested and are inclined to believe any positive thing they hear about their MLM. That’s just nature. So when anyone says something negative about it, they scream at the top of their lungs, not knowing that the“positives”may not be true.

Also know that the pro-Visalus people on this blog are either people who just started their MLM and are very emotional, or are the“leaders”at the top of their pyramid making money off the backs and failures of others.

But how it must suck for”leaders”when customers and distributors stop bying, that must be very stressful to a“leader”…that is why they work 24 hrs a day promoting and selling their products. I’d rather live My life than the Vi Life.
 Saevere007 
Here’s the list of the 10 things required to start a cult or a multi-level marking scam:

1. Charismatic leader

2. A good story

3. A good show

4. That first sucker

5. Bring on the testimonials

6. Swell the ranks

7. Give praise and succor to the believers

8. Defend assaults from outside with ambiguity, sweet talk and open arms.

9. Take checks to bank.

10. Laugh silently when no one else is around.

I thought  I would share these from another forum.

Keep up the good work. Because most of the people who fall for this are people who are desperate for money and/or have a poor body image which either way they come out the loser with they did not have it lose.  I bet you were a great salesman you write so intelligently and with such elegance. (not sure that is the right word)
 Izzy 
The people who started Visalus had a pyramid long distance co that went belly up before they had this one and I am sure they will have something else after Visalus.  Your 1.5 gpa is showing (I would even mention that if I were you). I am not surpprised by that fact since you got involved with this stuff.  I would advise you and your brother to hold on to your real jobs because this Visalus stuff will come falling down on you.  Be very careful.

That was really not a positive post in your favor. Read the BBB disclaimer…

BBB AccreditationA BBB Accredited Business since 11/2/2007BBB has determined that ViSalus Sciences meets BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.BBB accreditation does not mean that the business’products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business’product quality or competency in performing services.All the BBB does is take a fee for registering with them, monitor if you have complaints or not, and it Does NOT rate products or quality. I mean how many people actually file a complaint with the BBB if they have a problem with a company. I have had problems with companies and didnt like their services and have NEVER filed a complaint with the BBB…As for the company itself. IT IS a pyramid scheme which offers a product. You can take ANY meal replacement shake replace it for two meals of your normal food and you will lose weight. Simple math people…if the shake is 300 calories after the milk, shake mix, fruit, etc you put into it. and your normal meal consits of 800-1000 calories…your under budget and you will drop weight…By the way, this is coming from a guy who is starting the Visalus“challenge”in the next couple days. i JUST signed up under my friend to ONLY buy the product. I am NOT going to sign up people under me, and I am not buying their resale $500 program. I did my research and it makes no sense. You might make a couple bucks in the begining, but the bottom falls out and you end up losing quickly.The only reason I bought it under my friend rather than just buying the pouches on eBay (which is actually a few bucks cheaper) is so I would help him out a little. I even told him I am going to cancel in 90 days. And the only reason why I am trying these shakes, is just because the product itself (not the MLM scheme) seems ok. For example, I tried slimfast shakes, and the sodium and sugars in that are astronomical. This Visalus shakes seem to be a little better. I reccomend NOT to sign up with the company for resale UNLESS you know you for sure can get 100 people to sign up for the $500 plan. I mean how many people can actually do that?? Dont bother…
 Anonymous 
I understand you wanting to help your friend, that is what they (the company) depends on using each one that they can con into it to get their friends and family.  You were smart to not get into the selling part. I don’t even know if buying it from your friend is good for him it is sort of enabling the company to take advantage of him. That is an iffy thing.  But I do know that you can find better and cheaper shakes at your drug, vitamin or grocery store.  Or even better eat healthy meals and get plenty of exercise and you will lose weight and keep it off. A lot of my friends have had success with Weight Watchers.

We have been involved with Vi for about 10 months. They have a sound business model. Quite a few“big names”available in stores started as MLM, door to door, direct sales, ect. All commission based. The hardest rank achievement to break is from the RD to ND position. We have had our BMW bonus since Feb (3 months after we got involved). I am not sure who your upline was, what type of support system you had from them, past experience in direct sales, ect. Therefore I cannot know what happened in your situation. The comp plan is very balanced with promoters spread from the bottom to the top at about 30% each. This isn’t found in many other direct sales opportunities. I wish you well with whatever you are doing now days.
 DS 
I’m pro-Visalus and would NEVER say that other weight management systems don’t work, they just didn’t work for me! I have several friends and family who have had great sucsess on weight watchers, and nutra-system.  I’m not the kind of person that will shove something down someone’s throat to make a buck! If you want to try it, great, if you don’t, that’s fine too! And the whold BMW thing….YOU CAN BUY A USED BMW and they will still give you $600 a month even if your payment isn’t that much!!! I’ve been in this a while now, and I can honestly see everyones’sides, but you can’t make up peoples’minds for them, and just because it didn’t work for you, doesn’t mean it won’t work for someone else!!

Has anyone gotten sick once they stopped using visalus?  I have a friend that did the program for 4 months.  She reached her goal and then got busy and stopped doing the shakes.  Within a week she started feeling tired and her heart began racing.  Her blood sugar is up and down all over the place and she’s still wiped out almost 2 months later.  I keep trying to find anything about bad affects of this stuff but not having much luck.  You would think if people are getting sick it would be out on the net to find.

I never said it didn’t work for me…I did make some money…my biggest problem with Visalus is the big lie about earning so much money you will have more time to spend with your family…sorry, but promoting the product almost 24/7 and trying to maintain an build your downline, attending events, online work, social networking for leads and funneling, making tons of calls and trying to build your list, team calls and back office work……I think you see my point…the TIME it takes to do all that takes away the time I can spend with family and friends, and it just wasn’t worth it to me. Maybe it’s worth it to other people, but I think the TIME I spend with family and friends is far more valuable than trying to make a few bucks (especially at their expense).

You are a True Pessimist and Don’t have a Clue what you are talking about. I have worked this business for the past 6 months  and grown steadily in a small low income county. I have almost earned a BMW in this company and the weight loss results among the people involve is absolutely amazing. First of all, my family and I have lost a total of nearly 100 pounds. This was the first product that allowed my mom and dad at age 62 and 61 to lose around 30+ pounds each…and best of all without exercise…Other friends have even reported a drop in sugar levels that has allowed them to come off insulin shots.. YES insulin shots!!! The product is amazing and best of all when followed as directed–works flawlessly!!! So, You are a NUT and have no idea what you are saying…. BTW–you are wrong about paying the $600 a month after you qualify if you don’t re-qualify the following month…You actually get two free months to continue getting the bonus and that usually keeps you there…Also, No one that I know of in my upline has ever lost the Bonus!!!

That’s great that you enjoy doing the MLM thing, you really seem to enjoy it. But you need to re-read my posts, because you’re making an argument where there’s none to be made. I’m simply stating, as I did in my last post, I think the TIME I spend with family and friends is far more valuable than trying to make a few bucks (especially at their expense).

As for the product itself, there are thousands of meal replacement shakes and vitamins like Visalus, and most of them can be purchased from your local health food/grocery store, at a much more reasonable price and no shipping charges.

Your“magic bullet”attitude toward Visalus products is alarming, but typical of MLMers…I’ve heard my upline say the same types of things as you at events, team calls, challenge parties…this type of talk is very common in MLM.

I also don’t remember saying anything about the $600 bonus either, so you are arguing with yourself on that one. BTW–I’m not the owner or moderator of this blog, just a simple guy expressing his thoughts on MLM.

ViSalus is a scam.. analyze the compensation scheme and apply some critical thinking skills.. All the growth is from getting suckers to buy distributorships..

I’ve done several MLM companies—USA Today just THIS WEEKEND calls Direct Selling the wave of the future—it’s really just relationship marketing.   I’ve made money with every network marketing opportunity I’ve ever jumped in to—usually breaking even within my first week, or less…and I’ve never had to force my friends and family to do it.  The people who complain about MLM.. usually do so because they didn’t have the skills or patience to do it.   As for me—I don’t need a job.  I can make far more doing this, with much less effort and time.   You just have to be a real person, and talk to people, and build relationships.   The people who pressure family, friends, etc.,—or spam websites—are the ones who never succeed.   The difference with these companies is that they HAVE to have high quality product for the system to work—because the entire compensation plan depends upon loyalty of a customer base.  GNC actually has relatively low quality product—because they don’t have to market their product based on results.   Even before being involved in an MLM I knew I had to stay away from most store-bought protein shakes—the quality is simply lacking…they don’t market based on quality, but on ease of availability.   Network marketing companies HAVE to rise to the top in terms of quality AND results if they are to survive—bottom line.    Visalus is unique in that—if you ACTUALLY read the compensation plan—you can actually make just about as much by finding customers, as you can by recruiting promoters.  Unlike other opportunities, it actually allows customers to earn free products themselves—without ever being forced into a business.   In other words—the plan allows customers to be customers, and entrepreneurs to be entrepreneurs.

All I wanted to do is look up a few facts about The product. Like if it works or not. I see that you along with a few others have some very negative things to say. My question is…does the product work? That’s all I want to know. I’m not interested in money, cars, or how someones sorry husband can’t buck up. Thing is you have winners and losers in life. Anyway question for you negative ones does it really help? Oh yeah one more question do you believe in God?

A pyramid scheme is a non-sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment, services or ideals, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme or training them to take part, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public.This supplies a product or service. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_schemeBy your description, every company would be a pyramid scheme.

Ryan I totally agree with you.  My wife and I have been“PROMOTING”the 90 day challenge for just over a year now.  We have Vi-tired from our jobs and everyday are helping more and more people, through better health physically and financially.  I was a former autoworker and we hit the top of the comp plan in 9 months.  We have helped over 60 people on our team qualify for a BMW and have helped 4 people earn a 6 figure/year income with many more on their way.  What a crazy idea to actually get paid for helping other people change their lives.  As for the whole“PYRAMID”thing, every business is a“PYRAMID”.  The people at the top (Owners, CEO’s, President) make the most money.  Someone asked Donald Trump what would he do if he could start all over again and he said that he would be a Network Marketer.  If this website is trying to promote“ENTREPRENEURSHIP”, you may want to look a little deeper into your facts before you post Visalus as a scam considering that the company is backed by Blyth which is owned by the Goergen family that have a Business school of entrepreneurship named after them.  It doesn’t really matter what business you are involved with or own or who you are employed by because the bottom line is that hard work, personal growth and dedication is what pays off in the end.  My family, friends and our children’s lives have forever been changed because of this opportunity.  It you don’t have a positive opinion of something that you honestly don’t know very much about, you should keep it to yourself.

I abslutely agree with your statement“It doesn’t really matter what business you are involved with or own or who you are employed by because the bottom line is that hard work, personal growth and dedication is what pays off in the end.”

Your“success story”is the same thing I used to hear from the top ernears at events, challenge parties, team calls…typical MLM hype to keep your downline motivated and attract new customers/distriutors.

As for your“pyramid”analogy, it does not apply to every business. What about government employees, and workers of large internatinal businesses. Their organizations’charts certainly do not make a pyramid, but rather branch out several ways, and provide numerous services.

And I’m sorry, but anyone who becomes a Visalus distributor is not an entrpreneur or business owner. They have no control over the compensation, over the products, over events and team calls, over their downline, over the future of Visalus, no stake or ownershipof Visalus.

It’s unfortunate that you see my opinion as negative. I see it more as neutral, given that I used to be a distributor.

You are right as everyone has to work hard to make a living in this world.  But you are not helping people you are hurting them.  If all you did was sell the product I might buy that you actually thought that. But what your are selling is a get quick scheme and not every business is a pyramid, that is some more brain washing they have given you.  No other type business I know that is not a pyramid.  No other business requires you to recruit your own competition. No other business makes you require every month for your benefits and pay scale. No other business do they tell you to inflate your weight losses and others and to inflate your income.  No other business teach you how to trick,scam, and con other people.

I don’t agree with your thinking.  I think the products that MLM sell are of lower quality than you can find in stores. Simply because you have more of a choice.  I think they market it by MLM because they can not compete in the open market as far as quality and price.  Most are way over price for the quality of the product because they have to pay so many people.  The product is not what they are really trying to sell, it is distriborship (term used loosely here).  They recruit people to sell until they use up all their contacts then they are through.

I bet your upline would not tell you if they lost their bonus.  It is all smoke and mirrors.  Trying to make everything seem large than it is.  If you mother and father want to keep the weight off they need to exercise and eat health.  That is the only way to lose weight and keep it off.

How many 30% are in your 100%. The thing is MLM survive by getting people sucked in and them selling and sucking in their family and friends. Math tells you this will not last everyone runs out of people.  The company has made it’s money off of you (selling you samples and selling aids, web site etc. plus your minimum) and the other people you have suckered in. It plays out and they move on to other hunting grounds. And you are left with broken dreams.

LOL yea, I actually thought of it after I did it. By buying from him, I am enabling the company to take advantage of him…Its a phase, I know he will end up quitting the company in a few months time. Thats what happens with all of these types of companies. I just got the product in the mail today and I actually liked the taste of the shake. AGAIN, NOT GOING TO SELL. lol. But I dont know if I can have 2 meals a day/90 days of shakes, but I guess I will give it a try. I have tried quite a few shakes and this one tastes the best in my opinion. I have actually looked into weight watchers where they deliver the food to you, some time ago and a reason I never did it is because a lot of the items they cook with either have wine or pork in a lot of their meals and I cant have either (religious reasons). They might have changed recently, but that is what I remember from before. In addition to this 90 day shake binge…Im going to try and do p90x. Now that is a workout…I have only been able to get up to 3-4 weeks before I had some excuse to quit…Im hoping to finish it this time. Thanks for the advice.

Any meal replacement will work for awhile. There are better and chaper ones out there. If you want to lose weight and keep it off I would suggest to eat healthy and exercise and you will get healthy and stay that way and yes I believe in god  and I don’t believe he wants us taking advantage of other people.

The Weight Watchers I was refering to was the one on line that has a point system for the different foods and you count these points instead of calories.  They have a support group but I don’t think they supply any food.  I think there maybe a foods in the grocery with the Weight Watcher name on them put they are not required. Maybe you are thinking of NutriSystem, that stuff tastes like cardboard.

WOW, Visalis or not, what’s with the hate towards MLM? You assume that anything with more than 1 tier is an automatic scam? WRONG.
Not only have a few MLM programs changed my life in a very big way, but I was able to, and am to this day helping others.
I know next to nothing about Visalis, but one thing I CAN assure you is that the“average person”has a better chance at making money if they have a helpful upline. Sounds like some people here need to look up the definition of a pyramid scheme. Some of the world’s largest corporations have more than 1 tier, you’d be surprised. MLM and pyramid schemes are 2 totally different things. While there are a few MLM scams out there, there are WAY more scams that have nothing to do with MLM.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Here you go Bigb, the definition of pyramid scheme: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme 

So as you can see, MLM is just another way of saying pyramid scheme.

Visalus and other network marketers prefer to be called MLM instead of pyramid scheme. That’s like saying callgirl instead of whore.

I would suggest anyone who is still interested in buying this product and not selling it should not fool with a distributor, because that is what they are out to convince you to do ,but go to Amazon.com or to the ear-nose ringing in your ear specialist that came up with it; Dr Seidman’s site, he sells it cheaper than you could get it from a distributor.

I am often asked about the“lies”that MLM recruiters are guilty of perpetuating. Many very honest people take up MLM–including people who have“…never told a lie in their lives!”So, where are the lies?

The basic lie is that MLM gives all intending distributors an equal income opportunity. In practice, it does not.

New recruits do not know this. Many mid-term distributors do not know this. The upper echelon do know this.

By telling new recruits that there is an income opportunity for all, distributors perpetuate the lie, either knowingly or unknowingly.

The lie becomes truly sinister at the level of understanding where a distributor knows he or she is deliberately perpetuating the lie. It is at this point where the lie is driven by these people to evolve into an“understanding”that all who“fail”are simply not“good enough”to succeed. This lie is disseminated through the lower ranks from the moment they might choose to join. The challenge is thrown out to new recruits:“do the right thing or perish! But!–if you do the right thing you cannot help but succeed!!”

The fact is, it is impossible for all but a very few to succeed. The math and actual historical fact proves this.

New recruits and mid-term distributors are persuaded to“…do what successful people do (the“right thing”)”in order to succeed. The MLM experience aims to produce“clones”who do as they are told to do, at least until such time as their money is exhausted, and often enough, until their credit is also exhausted. From the very beginning of their MLM experience the“successful”upper echelon distributor emphasises recruiting as the way to success. This is true–recruiting is the only way to success in MLM. Consequently, nearly every new distributor commences a recruiting drive of some sort.

Effectively, these inexperienced recruits are driven to spend money to recruit. Most often, these same people are also driven to spend money on their own“how to succeed in MLM”education. In order to recruit profitably, a minimum product through-put is also most often required. It is during this period of hopeful enthusiasm that the MLM upper echelon profits wildly. A relatively small amount of money spent by each new distributor adds up to biilions of dollars world-wide. These billions, whether they are spent to recruit new people, to“educate”themselves or to buy product, serve to perpetuate the MLM“business”cycle.

Any and every statement that supports the contention that MLM is based on credible integrity is a lie.

You are a very intelligent person, so I want to ask you how does this company get such impressive intelligent people to fall for this.  The first time I heard about it I knew“no way”but I have had some life lessons that have taught me. I know using members of your family and your friends gives them the in track. But memebers of my family were recurited, they are highly educated ( I am talking doctors and masters degrees) people who should have known better.  They became like somebody else spilling the same outrageous claims. Combative to anyone that didn’t agree with them. They became like zoombies in some cult.  It was kind of amazing. So I was just wondering how did they do this.  If I didn’t know these people so well for so long I would think they went crazy.

I  knew almost nothing about MLM before Visalus. How did I get sucked in? From the lies I was told. The person who signed me up was a person I worked with (not at my current job). I was talking with him about retirement, and then out came his Visalus pitch. He was slick with it too, made it sound like it was the easiest way to make money, and lied about how much he was making. I attended a challenge party that had all the top earners there. I heard about a dozen “testimonials” from customers and distributors (probably shills) and watched a few videos.They had a couple of very influential motivational speakers and the BMW bonus was attractive too. At that time, I felt like I should be doing more for my family and thinking of my retirement, so that was my motivation for signing up. Anybody can fall for this, especially if they’re unfamiliar with MLM. Just flash some cash and a flashy car, listen to a few motivational speakers and you’d be surprised who will fall in the trap, it’s just human nature. As embarrassed as I am that I fell for it, at least I learned from my mistake, and can offer an informative opinion to those who ponder joining an MLM.

As for the guy who signed me up, we don’t talk anymore, as he’s still very involved with Visalus and very blinded by their MLM tactics and hype. He’s starting to become part of the NFL club (No Friends Left), because he’s revolved his life around Visalus.

Many of you obviously aren’t prepared to be an entrepreneur. Hard work, perseverance&amp;time is required to build almost ANY business which includes MLMs or Brick&amp;Mortar ones. Most new entrepreneurs work 60-80 hour weeks when they’re doing it full-time. Doing it part time will usually add another 20 to 40 hours on top of their‘regular’full-time job.

Where does this time come from?? A lot of it (if not most) will come from your family time. The key is to do the work up-front (spend a lot of time&amp;effort now) so that later, once your business is successful, you can scale back&amp;reap the benefits of your labour.

Again, this applies to almost ANY new business venture. I own a brick&amp;mortar Brand and Marketing Agency (Ad Agency) and regularly network with thousands of professionals, sales people&amp;entrepreneurs. All of the successful ones are spending a lot of time at their business (and by successful, I mean their business is successful). They spend much more time aiming for success than your average employee will ever spend at their job. Of course they will–they have a vested interest in their own success.

The biggest problem with MLM’s&amp;Network marketing is that they attract too many people who really just should remain as employees. The reality is that over time almost 40% of businesses will fail within the first 2 years. These are regular businesses, not the MLM variety. MLM businesses are higher than this (not sure of figure). People who are not cut out to be entrepreneurs are regularly brought on board. They are not prepared for the time&amp;energy sacrifices necessary to succeed. It is also a lot easier to pull out of a business where you have had very little financial investment .. try spending a few hundred thousand dollars on a brick&amp;mortar store, work 60+ hour weeks and see how quick you’d be to pull out when the market gets a little rough or you stub your toe. Very unlikely..

A very large problem with this is in how how certain promoters promote the business. They make it seem‘too easy’as if anybody can do it. Yes–some people do inflate claims&amp;lie.. these are a small portion of the masses. The reality is that like any new business venture, it requires dedication&amp;hard work–something that is mostly lacking amongst people in North America these days..

Success is filled with ups&amp;downs, failures&amp;successes. I would challenge you to find any massively successful business person who did not get there by a string of failures&amp;hard work. Most of you are just not up for the challenge..

It’s rare enough to find men with personal charisma and business acumen at the top of the corporate tree in any industry. Many have acumen, unquestionably, but few have that glowing, attractive to all, charm and sincerity that bless the out-front leaders of MLM. Good looking people. Intelligent people. Impressive and influential people. Successful, forceful, wealthy people. In fact, perfect MLM people in what is for them a perfect MLM world. Enviably placed at the top of the tree in all respects.

Is it coincidental that these men are spell-binding public speakers? That their lives follow a perfect curve that touches on magnificent? Charitable and beneficent. Venerable and wise. Energetic and focused. Uplifting and guiding.

They espouse the best social values. They contribute openly to the needy and do other great works. They subscribe to the philosophy of“…beggar help thyself!”They would prefer to teach a hungry man to fish rather than simply give him a fish.

These extraordinary people. How did they manage to do all this?

Well, they chose MLM as their vehicle to riches and influence. So they own the fishing holes. And they sell the tickets.

As a result, each is privy to the data that shows exactly what contribution each of their disciples makes to the company coffers. You are not.

Each is privy to the data which shows exactly what each of those distributors has earned in return for their efforts. You are not.

Each is privy to the data that shows exactly why so few benefit so much from the efforts and contributions of so many, and why it is necessary for thousands of people to“fail”in order to produce just ONE big financial winner. You are not.

And each is aware that nobody who follows them can possibly earn what they themselves earn from the self-serving commercial systems they have in place.

So, even though you might think you know how things really work in MLM, should you just go right ahead and follow the path laid down by these perfect people?

So you want to be an MLM icon?

It almost goes without saying that selling the“income opportunity”is the only possible path to wealth in MLM.

How can that be, you ask?

Well, let’s remove the“income opportunity”(read:“recruiting”) from any MLM for a moment and leave everything else in place. That would mean that anybody could be a distributor and be able to buy product direct from the company at wholesale pricing.

You are the first to approach the company to become a“re-seller”. You buy at wholesale and you may only sell at retail to others. In the ensuing weeks you sell product to 100 people, all of whom love it and decide that they too would like to become retailers. The company, anxious to expand, has no objection to this, but do you? Your repeat business has gone up in smoke and you now have 100 competitors in your service area, and you’re all looking for a retail customer base. All being equal, you now have less than 1% of your previous market to work with, no matter how big it was to begin with. For you to make the same money over again, you will have to find another 100 customers from less than 1% of the available market because now there’s a 100 others doing the same thing as you. Is this just cause for celebration on your part? No?

OK. Now let’s put the recruiting (“income opportunity”) step back in the equation.

You become the first distributor for an MLM. As above, you still retail to 100 people, but now you also recruit a 100 people. You’ll make millions a month forever! The 100 people you recruited have to do what you did so that they can also make money. They all do it. Suddenly, on your very next level, you have 10,000 distributors in your group who are retailing to 1,000,000 people, and you get a cut of all that action! Are you happy? You betcha!! Money! Money! Money! Do you CARE that you now have 10,100 competitors? Not as long as they keep making you money, you don’t! Right? **grin** You’re on your way to iconization.

But is EVERYBODY really happy?

What about the 10,000 new distributors who are searching in their turn for their 100 recruits and 100 retail people? To fullfill the need, the new level will have to consist of 1,000,000 new recruits with 100,000,000 retail customers between them. Now these 10,000 people want to make the same money that you do. You promised them they could, didn’t you? Difference is, each of them has 10,100 people competing with them in the marketplace (including you and your original 100 recruits). Whereas you had 100% of the marketplace to find your first line of people and your retail customers, each of these people has only 1/10,100th of the market you had to work with. (Don’t ask what the members of the next level have to contend with!)

Now this is where you can make the deal really interesting. Don’t tell anyone how many people have already signed up or where they live. Everyone will think that there’s still plenty of people out there and they’ll try harder! Far more sporting!. Take time out for yourself. It’ll be fun watching them all blundering about, crashing into each other in the newspaper ad columns and trying to work out new ways to beat the next guy to the next recruit or retail customer.

Now just how much of a good time do you want? More? OK. You could take a tour around your group to watch the less fortunate people spend more and more money! Urge them on. That’s fun. The best part though, is watching the disheartened actually lay down and cry. You get the opportunity to shake your head funereally and make it plain in asides to the other on-lookers in your group that these disheartened folk are really the weak, stupid and ignorant who were just not doing as they were told. Of course, if they had been doing as they were told, then they would be nearly as rich as you! Right? Of course!

The really, really, best part though, is watching the banks fore-closing on these really weak, stupid and ignorant silly buggers!! Hey! Told you this was gonna be FUN !!

Ain’t it just the best? Gettin’RICH in MLM, I mean?

All you gotta do is sell the income opportunity–over and over and over again!

And there you are. An MLM icon!

I disagree with your statement“No other business make you requalify every month to recieve your benefits and pay scale”Every single sales or so called customer service jobs out there make you qualify every month.  You think those people at the phone company or cable company would have jobs if they didn’t hit certain sales targets every month.  I can tell you first hand the answer is no.  Pretty much anyone who works in a call center must sign up or upsell a certain number of customers every month or they don’t get their bonus, if they miss targets for 2 or 3 months they are out the door.  This includes most inbound call centers, Cable, Phone, Online Banking, Hotel reservations if you can call them they HAVE sales targets.

Bottom line is some people are cut out for sales and some are not.

Ofcourse some people selling ViSalus are going to lie to you but that doesn’t mean everyone who sells it is like that.  When I worked at Bell Canada we had reps that would trick you into giving you thier cc number then ship you a“Free”cell phone.  Those people had good sales for a while but no retention.  There are idiots in every single line of busines out there.

I have read most of the posts on this page&amp;nearly everything of what I have read from the“haters”is true.

Never mind whether or not the product“works”or not.

Never mind that some initial residual income can be made.

Take a look at what will be lost if you decide to become a distributor:

1) Friends

The Visalus gods will“train”you to transform your personal facebook page into a selling tool.  You will have to constantly blast out your link, praying to god that someone clicks on it and joins so you can make your monthly goal.  Imagine if one of your friends asked you to buy their product, all day every day, you continue to tell them“no”, but they ask anyway?  Your true friends on facebook will diminish as people start to block and delete you.  You will not even notice, however, since you will be bombarded with friend requests from others in the business, so that they can all copy and paste each other’s facebook posts to use on their victims, err, I mean facebook friends.  And NEVER make the mistake of telling these people how you feel.  You will get ripped a new one similar to some of the comments made on this page by people you have been close with all your life.

2) Your Real Job

I have personally seen four of my close friends and family either lose or quit their jobs to take on this venture.  Visalus will convince you that you will make so much money by joining, that you will no longer need that“deadend job”with all those horrible things, like job security and benefits and such.  I have seen friends quit their jobs and go on state assistance for medical benefits to persue this“dream”as they call it.  They will brag about their weekly paychecks, but will never actually show you proof, since they don’t want you to know how little they make.

I have seen a friend lose their job, since their boss finally got tired of all the Visalus talk at work.

3) Your Integrity

Before you decide to take that“leap of faith”into this venture, look at the business model.  It will saturate.  Once it fully saturates, it will collapse.  Once it collapses, all the people you convinced to join will never trust you again.  Is this something you want?  Is it worth the money?

4) Common Sense

It is common to be skeptical before joining something like this, and it’s for a good reason.  Once people join, they get so suckered in that they somehow believe everything that they’re told.  I remember all these people bragging about how the CEO of this company was appearing on Dr. Phil.  Did it happen?  no.  Some people have even gone so far as to claim this product will help cure cancer and depression.  All I can saw is“wow”.  It is advertised as a cure-all so that it will appeal to as many people as possible.  The founders of this company have psychology degrees for a reason.  They are trained motivational speakers that will convince the biggest of skeptics and turn them into sheep in one sitting.

5) Money

Why do you think it costs money to join?  Part will go to Visalus, part will go to the team of people that brought you on.  Now that they got your money, you’re on your own.  If you have an ambitious upline, they will help you recruit people if they have their eye on the prize of getting that wonderful“free”BMW (don’t even get me started on that one.  Trust me, it’s not free, it’s a reimbursement program as long as you continue to make that monthly goal.  Do you really think you will make your monthly goal for the life of those car payments?  I promise you, you will not, and end up paying for it with all the“profits”you will make from selling the products.  At best, you will break even in the end).  You will tackle your close friends and family first, and then you will realize that you have no one left to sell to.  Then comes the interesting part.  You will have to travel all over the country starting up these“challenge parties”to recruit people.  Who pays for this?  You.  Who has the time for this?  People desperate to make this work.  Who gets the shaft from this?  Your family, your friends…all the people who have been there for you all along.  Suddenly they will not matter.  All that is important is that Ambassador level, so you can get that black jacket and brag to all your old friends and say“I told U so”, as this company trains people to think and say.  They will even have you use this as your licence plate.  It gets better, it is mandatory for you to pose in front of that black BMW using the“shocker”hand sign, so they can pimp you out for marketing purposes.  You have no choice in the matter.  You just sold yourself to the company and they can use your image however they like for as long as they like, even after you left them.

6) Your Health

This is something I’ve been witnessing that no one seems to talk about.  People who have been drinking these shakes for awhile now seem to be getting sick alot.  And I mean alot.  If you want to feel sick all the time, this is the product for you.  But, you’ll be losing weight, so I guess it’s ok.  You will experience constant diarrhea once you start taking this stuff, but you are trained that this is normal and that your body is somehow going through a detox process.  Really?  The human body is not meant to survive on a liquid diet.  What happens once you get off the stuff?  I’ll let you figure out that one on your own…not pretty.

7) Do you need any more reasons?

I feel so sad that some of my friends and family decided to go this route.  We no longer speak to each other, since I am labelled a“hater”with no ambition.  They claim they are an elite part of society and are entrepreneurs.  I think this point has been discussed in earlier posts, but these Visalus people refuse to see reality.  You have NO control over this company, you are NO entrepreneur.

I’m sure I will be ripped apart here for making these comments, but it’s nothing I haven’t heard before.  At least be original and stop making the usual remarks on how Ryan Blair is a rags to riches story (thanks to his step-father funding the whole thing), and how it’s“working”for so many people.  Water and carrots work for losing weight, but not the best way to approach the problem.  Do you really want to drink these shakes for the rest of tour life?

And of course, I wish“Vitality”to you all. ;)

This is very well said and I find it quite sad that perhaps a slightly bias approach may have been put forth by a possible bad former experience. I haven’t been involved in the financial side of the company for very long but can add this.. I almost died in august of last year and needed 3 major surgeries to save my life. I started taking this product a few months ago and have lost 35 pounds so far and feel twenty years younger and don’t feel unhealthy in any way shape or form and my usual seasonal cold has somehow passed me by.

In fact I ran out of product for a week between orders and felt like absolute crap! I was the same old tired and sluggy that I was before I started using Visalus to lose weight!

Since starting this journey, I have seen friends that were bed ridden become pain free and start to live normal lives, a very close friend with fibromialgia&lt;not sure if spelling is right, is now training for a marathon!

I have seen people lose weight, get in shape, dance, and enjoy life more then they have in years and heard testimony&apos;s from hundreds of others who say the same thing.. THIS WORKS!

Now. The marketing side of things, if you work for a company that you do sales for and the job comes with a car, usually thats based on your performance also isn&apos;t it? If you don&apos;t perform in your sales job, would they continue to keep you on. I think that the BMW and having to hit a target of production to continue to have that care paid for actually quite reasonable if it&apos;s true.. but what you also left out is you don&apos;t have to take the car, you can take the money instead although i don&apos;t believe it&apos;s the whole amount of the car payment but it&apos;s still a bonus that you can apply to perhaps your existing car payment!

Okay, so MLM has a bad rap.. isn&apos;t Amway a 40 year old company?.. and how old is Mary Kay and Avon? If MLM&apos;s delpete, how do some of these companies get so old?

I could go on about this but i won&apos;t.. you have made yourself look silly enough!

I totally agree with you and have seen the same results in very close friends with MS, LUPUS, CHRONIC FATIGUE, FIBRO , MIGRAINES, ARTHRITIS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION and more! It’s all over the net and you can find real testimonials from real people just by google searching the“90 day challenge”

By the way, my best friend earned his BMW in 42 days and I was there the whole time to watch it happen!

By the way his girlfriend who has fibro, chronic fatigue and was bed ridden three of the seven days a week with so much pain she couldn’t move is not training to run her first marathon. I know it’s true because I was there!

Oh, she’ll have her BMW this month, it’s been 3 1/2 months for her since Visalus!

LOL.. I meant to say now training to run a marathon.. never type in the dark :p
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
You hit the nail right on the head on that one. Everything you say is absolutely true. Great post!
 OPEN MINDED 
I wrote this letter to my brother today and decided to share it with you people to enlighten you a little bit about one persons opinion being just that…ONE OPINION! and a tainted one at that!

Enjoy!
Dear Steve,I have to say as my brother, I wasn’t very impressed with you posting a negative article on my wall in 3 places without actually approaching me first or at least reading the entire article with the posts below it! Some of what he had to say is true although completely over inflated and twisted by a certainly bias opinion of a failed attempt at possibly trying to do the business himself. Yes distributors use their wall to get peoples interest in looking at the products, it’s social networking, almost everyone is doing it these days, but not every distributor hounds their friends and family! Case in point, I have never spoken to you about this yet!Not only do visalus distributors use their wall to communicate with their friends about their products, generate interest, leads or whatever you want to call it, but so do a ton of other people doing business, including facebook! Who charges for that advertising! I responded to a couple of the posts that were put up on that thread last night and took the time to read it very thoroughly and the things that i found that you did not are this :You need a real e-mail address to respond to any threads and it chooses the first part of the e-mail address as your screen name.. I found it quite interesting that almost all of the negative posts, in fact almost all of the posts in general were from the same person who ironically called himself ex-visalus distributor to make himself look like more then one person at first glance to the hundreds of people that will read his blog and never reply themselves so they will never catch on to that. You definitely didn’t! It’s also evident by the writing style in several consecutive posts which you may not have read far enough to pick up on yet, becsuae your opinion was tainted before you even found the blog! I don’t know, that is my opinion!The other thing is, half of what he says isn’t true. The commision pays out are on any dollar amount of sales! They don’t have to be over a certain volume as he stated and as for the car, if your job gave you a car to use and you were a salesman not producing you would be let go and the car taken back! Also, yes the commision resets the next month and builds back up throughought the month like any other business does as sales are put through, including recurring ones. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THEN DSC CHARGES IN YOUR BUSINESS FROM PACS GOING THROUGH EVERY MONTH!This company has to protect themselves as well, so why wouldn’t they put in some kind of structure to do that! I would! The other thing about this that is complete bull is that if the company that created this structure is called BLYTH which you may or may not know. Blyth is owned by the Goergon family which are billionaires. This company trains entrepreneurs in fact, they actually have a school called THE GOERGON SCHOOL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP is world renowned! So if the guy that decided to write the article is a guy that represents entrepreneurs he’s not really all that intelligent a one himself or he would know that, he clearly hasn’t done his homework very well. There were a few other major flaws in what he has to say like for example if you earn a car as a bonus and the people under you continue to sell something that works&lt;–lets take that works part for a minute because you aren&apos;t quite sure about it and that&apos;s fine, i&apos;m not trying to turn you around on it just perhaps enlighten you with some knowledge because I assure you I have looked at this a lot longer and much more in depth then you have because you have a job and family etc and don&apos;t have the time and the energy to have looked at it as much as i have.. how can a business tap out of income that is constantly passive and continuing to build with people under you selling something that works to a market with a demand for it. Not everyone wants to have distributors under them, in fact you can earn the car withough anyone bleow you at all! Oh, that was another thing he forgot to mention in his article.Perhaps he is right! Maybe it will eventually slow down, but I have a really hard time seeing something slowing down that is actually helping so many people combat so many things when nothing else in the world is working the way this is.. As for health benefits, The only time I ever felt anything bad about this product is when I ran out of it and had less energy and was tired from shift work and getting up at 4:30 am to get to my other job!I strongly believe that the writer off this article probably really is an ex-visalus distributor, he seems to know enough about it to twist it all up and make a negative impression of it at first glance. I also don&apos;t think MLM&apos;s are for everyone, but the products distributed by them aren&apos;t necessarily bad products, look at Avon and Amway, how long have they been in business 40 plus years.. Hm.. they didn&apos;t fizzle out..??I also believe that on top of being an ex-visalus distributor, he&apos;s a lazy one at that and expected someone else to grow his business for him and he&apos;s pissed off that he paid for something and didn&apos;t get anywhere with it because he didn&apos;t try, but I&apos;ll betcha he got the hundreds of dollars in product that came with his distributorship, and I betcha he used them as well!I noticed that he said his family members quit their jobs to pursue this, he also never provided any proof that they were failing at it, and perhaps that pisses him off also! He probably hounded his friends and lost some of them and that&apos;s pissed him off as well.. by the way, I haven&apos;t approached you once!The people that I have talked to are open minded, want to be healthier, have health issues or might want a part time business and I am not pushing this on anyone, just presenting it and in fact, people are coming to me and asking me about it. I think like any business that you are doing, some certain amount of ethics should apply. These are mostly common sense and values. If your driving your friends nuts over and over with anything you will lose friends! What if I called you up every day over and over and over and said try Soy beens in your coffee, eventually you would get pissed off!Anyway, you can post whatever you want to your own wall, but before you start posting negative shit to mine, please think about what you&apos;re doing. I am interested in hearing what you have to say for sure and if the stuff you have to say is true, I&apos;ll post it myself! But don&apos;t go hurting my part time business and destroying my friends opinion of something because you allowed yourself to be tainted by one article written by a disgruntled dick head! How many other articles have you been able to find? Almost all of the ones BY THE HUNDREDS that I have found have been positive.By the way, I am in no way trying to turn you around on anything or slam you, you may even be very right in your opinions, but I am not so sure.. I am only trying to help you understand that your approach last night was damaging and irresponsible. Although I totally appreciate your concern and care about you because you are my brother, I would not have come at you directly like that with this if it was related to your business. It&apos;s just wrong and not the way to do things, especially when you already knew I was involved in it, you just didn&apos;t think!Steve there will always be someone with a negative opinion out there about everything! I can find hundreds of people if not thousands of people that have lost a great deal of money dealing in your business of selling mutual funds, but they never went out of business, and does that make your business bad? Not necessarily! Maybe they didn&apos;t do their business very well, and it;s like everything in life.. people have to put forth to get out! It doesn&apos;t just come in on it&apos;s own!
 OPEN MINDED 
I really like what you have to say and totally agree with you. Most tainted opinions are perhaps people that have been unprepared and failed themselves or watched someone they know fail themselves. I’ve had several businesses that have failed in the past, including an online webstore that I took hundreds and hundreds of hours of my time to put in and saw no returns.

There are plenty examples of failed business adventures out there that don’t always include them being an MLM type of business!

People have to work at their business and in most cases very very hard to get them from ground floor and build them up.

Bill gates did not become Microsoft from lies and deception and lack of hard work. There is a lot of work involved and values go along with that hard work.

Don’t paint the picture that everyone in any certain type of business is a liar or a cheater, I assure they are NOT!

I agree with you that MLM’s may not be for everybody and some of them are set up prroly and exhaust there potential, but I also believe that supply and demand still is in play like every business out there!

I think somewhere along the line you had a bad experience with a business choice and your opinion is your opinion! Not everyone is shady, not everyone is a liar, there are people out there that don’t run their business that way and I am one of them!

Sounds like she might have an underlying health condition, she should consult a doctor. I’m actually a paramedic myself and a distributor of Visalus and haven’t heard of anyone getting sick by stopping the shakes yet. But irregular heart beat and sugar counts are concerns that should never be ignored!
 OPEN MINDED 
You have mentioned a few times now that you have made some money in your former distributorship, I am just wondering, how long did you stick with it before you gave up. Perhaps if you work harder for a while, you might have been able to reap the rewards later on and have had that time to spend with your family.

No one so far with this company has told me it would be a cake walk! I have known from the beginning that I would have to work hard, like any other entrepreneurship business the onus is on you alone to make your business a success!

It’s like any other business! Are you gonna buy a corner store and just leave the door open and hope people will come in buy stuff and leave the money on the counter for you.. of course not.. you need to be there.. you need to advertise and get your message out and you need to not rip people off with substandard product at inflated prices!

I have seen people getting healthy with this so I know it works.. It’s under 2 bucks a shake so I know it’s less expensive then the average meal is..

and by the way.. you can earn the beamer without having distributors under you, it’s based on volume and if you work hard and have a good product you will have volume!

That is awesome..

He didn’t say they couldn’t exercise, he said they lodt without exercise.  I am sorry but I feel everything that Visalus people say are over inflated and not really true I have also saw this up close.

This is why I hate MLMs and Visalus in particular.  They cause trouble in families and with friends.  They brain wash into believing this is the greatest thing in the world when really it is just a outdated shake that is very over pricer that can not make it in the  market place so they have to get people to convince their friends and families that they should join in. In the end like all MLMs they fail because the success is in recruiting people whic everyone runs out of people.  Amway and Avon were success because they have so many different products and they DON’T depend on recruiting. They have a huge amount of reasonably priced products that everyone can afford and use. I feel so sad for you who turn so mean if anybody questions Visalus.  Your brother is just trying to help you.  He sees the dangers that you don’t.  Use your common sense and don’t get angery at your brother get angery at the company that is cheating you and causing family troubles.  By the way I have a close family member who is a salesman. He gets a new car every 80,0000 miles or 4 years.  It is leased or mowned by the company. He does not have to do anything, they furnish insurance, they get it licensed every year for him, and they give him a credit card for gas and maintanance.  He does not have sto sell any certain amount or qualify for it.   They will not take it away from him unless he leaves the company.  But of course he also gets paid for sick days, 401K, health Insurance. Life insurance. vacation, and a very handome salary that he can count on being there every two weeks.  Now that is a job.  Do not let this stuff break up your family.  Family is more important.  If you Visalus people  could hear yourself and realize how foolish you sound.  And you do have to have people under you to get the BMW look at the compensation schedule.  It is not a business Visalus doesn’t even recognize as a business associate. read your contract.

Thank You so Much for your honesty.  How do they get away with all the claims with out being sued.  I know the company NEVER takes any responsibilty for or to their reps but someone should get sued.  I know of one distrbutors that says it is recommeded and prescribed by physcians.  This I know is a lie. I have asked several doctors.  They can recommend that you should lose weight but no method or product.  They can recommend that you could take a suplement ( not many do unless you are not eating) but cann’t recommend a brand. Just like they can say take cough suryp but do not tell you which brand.

I have family that has been in sales for 35 years and he gets a company car ever 4 years or so.  He does not have to get it in his name, he does not have to worry about payments, taxes&amp;licenses, gas or repairs, or upkeep. The company takes care of all that. He got that when he started the job and they will not take it away from him until leaves the company.  He also gets full benefit package and a very good check every two weeks.

People that sell Visalus have illusions of grandour.  I have a distributorship, i have a business.. You have no business, you have no distributorship, you don’t even have a job.  You are trying to sucker people into to selling some worthless shake for a company that you have to pay, that does not recognize as an employee or that you represent their company.  They are jusst using you for the people you know and when they squeeze all of those contacts out of you, they are through with you.

If there is no shipping cost it is not a bad deal then. Let me ask you something, and this is legitimate because I really want to know, what other products are on the market that do what this product does that cost less, because I have lost 35 pounds in under 4 months and feel incredible energy so I know it works..

I’m not 100% on the multi level thing, because I know other companies have had serious problems as a result of multi level marketing, but believe in the products enough to sell them to my friends as I said I have had such great results myself.

I don’t want a leased BMW that I will be on the hook for if I don’t produce, and I have a great job with full bennifits now, so this is a part time thing for me.

I have been told it’s based on production volume so you can still earn the beemer as long as you hit your monthly target or you can take 300 dollars cash every month instead. It’s right on the Visalus promotional video so it’s in plain view and it is my understanding you don’t need to sign any lease or have to choose the car.

But mostly, since you know so much, I am interested in what products are cheaper on the market then this that will give the same results that I have been seeing daily. Also, just so you know I have a friend with fibro who now trains for a marathon. She was completely bed ridden half the week with chronic pain before Visalus. That story I know is true and not a lie told to me by someone I don’t know because I watched it for the last several years, the meds, the pain, the breakup with a best friend and the heartache of not having a normal life..

She is able to do things now and I watched the recovery happen. So I am asking you, if this is a cheap version of something else out there on the market, I would really like to know what it is.. Maybe I should be selling that one then..

Would a rational person, abreast of the facts, go to work selling any product or service if he or she knew that there was an open agenda to overhire sales reps for the same products in the prospective territory?
What do you think? Is this a good“opportunity”or a recipe for collective disaster?
So, as the saying goes,“Get in early!”This is a rationalization on the level of“getting in early”on the L.A. looting riots. If profit from the sale of products is fundamentally set up to fail, then the only money to be had is to“loot”others by conning them while you have the chance. Don’t miss the“opportunity,”indeed!
Where is the money coming from for those at the top? From the sucker at the bottom…as in every pyramid scheme. The product could be, and lately has been, anything.
The important thing is to exploit people while the exploiting is good, if you want to make quick money at MLM.

obviously you dont know what you are talking about,  I have been involved in Visalus for a good while and my sons have their bmw so I do know how that works.  The company is alot of things that people dont know about if you are not involved in it.

There again you dont know what you are talking about. Amway is a networking business like Avon, mary kay, jewerly businesses etc. Which requires you to have people in the business with you, which is great cause who would want to be in business alone.

I’ve never heard of Visalus, until a Pastor friend of mine put a link on his fb page for it today.. I do however know Network Marketing or MLM as some call it very well. I’ve been involved in the industry for 6 years now and could share countless stories of people who succeeded (including myself) and loving life spending more time now with our families than with co-workers, building a life most wouldn’t believe.. and stories also of people who have failed or never tried and bad mouth the industry because of what they read on a site like this. I usually never give any attention to negative sites like these, however I will say this, I was a HUGE skeptic when first introduced to Network Marketing! I wanted to be a traditional business owner..but was at least willing to try and understand why I was skeptical in the first place. I learned people usually don’t like or don’t trust what they don’t understand. Pretty simple. After I post this I will not return to the site to see what you all have to say, not to be rude but frankly I don’t care =) Just had to write this for that one person who may read this wanting to give it a shot. If you’re going to do your research, look up these companies on the Better Business Bureau, not on sites like these. And remember.. the mind is like a parachute, it works best when opened.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Apparently, it is difficult for gung-ho MLMers to see how they look from the outside. They can watch lifelong friendships unravel, churches and civic groups poisoned, the avoidance of friends and family, etc., and never see that MLM was the cause.
If you try to point this pathology out, you are treated as if you have attacked the very gospel! Perhaps for some, the MLM approach is a new gospel?
They will claim to have made“new friends,”most of which are MLMers or new acquaintances who could be considered“future prospects.”The shallowness of these“new friends,”the stilted conversations among the“old friends,”and the embarrassment, in general, for what seems clear to everyone but the MLMer go unnoticed. Callousness sets in; standards are lowered.
Of course, it could be pointed out that this might have happened anyway. Perhaps the die-hard MLMers would have ruined their friendships anyway in some other non-MLM business failure. Is the MLM really the cause, or just the vehicle?
Business failure of any type is traumatic on the relationships involved, but in most small businesses there is at least the chance of success. And this is never the case in an MLM, unless“success”can be defined as profiting off of the failures of others.
Non-MLM real-world businesses that offer products of interest to friends, family, etc., such as insurance agents and small retail shop owners, seem to be more circumspect in dealing with personal relationships in all but a few rare (and grievous) cases. But the MLMer is recognizable by duplicity of friendship overtures, overbearing glad-handing, full-time prospecting, outrageous initial deception, and social callousness. This is no accident, but rather sheer desperation. How could it be otherwise? For the active MLMer is in a hopeless bear trap: with hubris as one steel jaw and oversaturation the other.
And so the MLM relationship“bull”tramples through the relationship“china closet,”blindly ruining fragile and valuable things. Some never pull out of this, figuring the coldness they experience in their emotional lives is due to some other cause than their MLM participation.

I know they are but I said they don’t depend on recruiting. I have bought form Avon, Amway, and Mary Kay for years and not once has anyone asked me to sell it, I don’t think they would want the competition I wouldn’t if I was selling something.  Jewelry business I don’t know never bought anything from them.  Visalus the first I ever heard of it they were trying to get me to sell (you can get yours free if you just sell three other people) If I was selling something I would want to be in business alone.

I know exactly what you are talking about and this is what sent me to this site and made me want to investigate what Visalus was all about.  Some of my close family members got into it and recurited others. When I told them I had never heard of Visalus but that I did not trust pyramid schemes they got really hateful with me and flew off the handle saying things that I would have never believed they  would say to me. Then another family member after the 90 day challenge hadn’t lost any weight and quit you would have thought that he had shot somebody, his own son wanted to kick him out of the family.  When I made the comment that it sounded like a cult, things really blew.  After constantingly trying to trick me in coming to a challenge party, they have connived, lied, and etc trying to get me involved in this.  Now I have been invited to Thanksgiving dinner.  I am not going as I am afraid it is another trick to get me involved in this stuff.  SAD………..They went to all these meetings and got drunk and got more brainwashed each time.

You must not be prepared either or you would have picked another business. MLM attract people who do not want to work hard they just want to play without taking any responsibilties that you have to take any other types of businesses.

I’m really sorry to hear about your experience. It’s a sad situation when families get torn apart by pyramid schemes.

Just know that your family members involved in Visalus are emotionally vested in their MLM. They’ve listened to many very influential people at these events and are blinded by the lies they’ve been told. They think that anyone who doesn’t believe in what they preach must either be crazy or a negative person. If only they could see themselves from the view of others…

You seem like a very understanding and patient person. Keep being patient with them; you’ll see, they’ll eventually see the light. If I were you, I would go to Thanksgiving, that way you are showing them that you haven’t completely shut them out, and you’re not about to let a little MLM company like Visalus ruin your relationships. And if it ends up being a challenge party, simply tell them that you’ve listened to their pitch and are not interested. If they’re going to shun you for that, continue being patient with them. When it all bottoms out on them, you will be there for them…not to tell them“I Told U So”, as Visalus clones would, but to let them know you still love them, that they did their best and that you’ll always be there for them.

PS: You must be Canadian (like me!)…Long Thanksgiving weekend coming up!

How sad to see so many people here that do not realize what a great product the Visalus shake meal replacement actually is.  Forget the MLM.  The product works!  My friends and I are healthier, loosing weight, have more energy.  This is the truth of the matter!  If some are making money on the MLM, so be it.  My friend has her BMW and has no problems with payments because she has so many sales–because, again, the product is awesome.  I have a liver disease and was spending hours and hours on the couch.  After just one week on the shakes, I have tremendous energy and am loosing inches and weight.  The product works!  Who cares how it is marketed.  At the least, the profits are going out to regular people and not a corporation.  In these times, what can be wrong with that?
 Anonymous 
You have drunk the kool-aid too.  If it has made a difference it may because you want it to.  The point is that the people making the money is the Company.  The money is not going to the people selling it.  You load anything with caffiene you will get energy from it.  Read the other blog were people who stay on it get sick. The money the sales people get are only for a while.  The product is cheap and the packaging is cheap, even the printing is cheap. No money going there.  If it could compete on quality and price in the open market it would be there.

Imagine that Wendy’s became suddenly possessed by the idea that“everyone needs to eat,”and opened four Wendy’s franchises on the four corners of an intersection in your neighborhood. Who would benefit from this folly? The consumer? Certainly not the franchises; they would all lose. Wendy’s corporate? Perhaps temporarily, by speculative inventory sales while the unfortunate franchises were under the delusion that they could all make money. But in the end, the negative image of four outlets dying a slow death would likely offset the temporary inventory sales bubble. Even the most unreflective of the hapless franchisees would think twice about doing business in such a manner again. This is why real-world distributorships and franchises are contractually protected by territory and/or market.
Again, the simple fact is that even the most successful products will have partial market penetration. The same is true for services. Demand and“market share”are finite, and to overestimate either is catastrophic.
So why are MLM promoters obscuring this? Who is in control of the supply“knob,”carefully and skillfully managing the size of the distribution channels, number of salespeople, inventory, etc., to insure the success of all involved in the business? The truth is chilling: nobody.
Imagine trying to write a computer model of how MLMs work, and you will see this point most vividly. An MLM could never work, even in theory. Think about it.

Wondering if you have never been to a jewelry party pocketbook party etc during their presentation they always say if you are interested in the business please talk with me. and they also want you to have parties to help their business, nothing wrong with that, thats how networking works. And we do not talk to everyone about promoting the business.By not being in this alone we have a lot of people helping us and have made great friends.  I am self employed by trade and would much rather do visalus because of the great products and people than my other business..So as far as doing this as abusiness it is awesome.

That is just the type of judgement an mlmer would make. For most people, thankfully, the MLM experience usually ends in very quick financial failure and is then sidelined. Two possible responses are: 1) being embarrassed about participation, or 2) becoming even more intractable when the MLM has failed. You will find the latter chasing after the latest“get rich quick”scheme with similar results.“If we could have just sponsored so and so–they have so many friends–we would have made it.”
Thus, there is reason for the“bad taste”most people have for MLMs. By instinct if not experience or insight, we wince at the thought of what we know will follow in the wake of an MLM. Relationships strained, factions formed, deception, manipulation, greed, loss, a closet full of videotapes, brochures, and useless inventory that“everybody wants.”

I’ve been using the product for some time. I do have considerable amounts of energy. I sleep better. I am also much healthier. The product used for energy labeled“Neuro”has minimal amounts of caffeine. The reason it gives you a considerable amount of energy is the fact that it is rich in b vitamins, similar to a five hour energy supplement. The reason this product is so healthy for you is because it is full of almost every nutrient your body needs. Although, I would not consider it a meal replacement. Your body needs calories too anywhere from 1400 to 10000 depending who you are and the rate at which your metabolism burns fat. If you take this product for the weight loss factor, you will lose weight, but once you start eating normal food again the weight will come back quickly. I’d suggest taking this product for the nutritional value only and still eat normal food, just not as much. Also, I believe there are much cheaper ways of getting the same nutrition out there. I have a friend is a promoter and I only buy it once and a while to help him out. I consider this company a pyramid scheme…because that is exactly what it is.
 Someone who cares! 
hi!,

I am reading all this and it confuses me. My wife and I started with Visalus 5 months ago. We are what you would call National Directors. When we started we had no expectations and just wanted to do something fun together. We decided to do this after seeing and researching it thoroughly. We tried the products. I lost 25 pounds in the first 60 days. My wife went from a size 8 to a 4. We invested about $1500 and have made $25,000 in addition to driving new cars. We have not felt any pressure from anyone from either side. The people using the products or promoting the products. Its a product that gives people nutrition they can not possibly get by eating correctly every day. That is why there are so many products in the stores. They all have benefits and you probably do not need them if you do everything correctly. That is the problem. Most people do not eat right or watch their eating habits. This just gives people a great alternative to help get a  kick start. If you really look at some of the stories it will blow you away. People losing 50 lb in 90 days, 100 pounds in 90-120 days. and still feeling healthy. People getting off of high blood pressure pills (my cousin). It changes their lives.  70% of the USA is over weight. These products help. If there are people that you know who have not had success, does that mean that the product, business model or company is wrong or bad? My wife and I have helped 10 people qualify for BMW’s in the past 4 months. Some will get a car and some will just take a reduced amount of cash. no harm done then. Once you understand the system and build like we did to maintain its not that hard either. We hit that level by the 5th of every month so we do not have to worry. Someone posted that people get sick. I guess that could possibly be true but I have not experienced that. But people can get sick from eating anything. I can tell you that this company has an 88% retention rate on people who start using the products. In closing, I just do not understand why people bash things so harshly. I guess its like buying a ford. Some people buy one and it gives them nothing but problems so they say all fords are bad. Not true but in their mind it is. We enjoy helping people and that is our motivation. If someone in my family, circle of friends, or business circles does not want to be part of it, I am not sure why that would cause me or them to no longer communicate. I can see people getting defensive when people have no idea what they are talking about yet act like they do.
Most of the time, the people that get mad or upset if they have been involved in this or other businesses are the ones who did not have any success, maybe the person that brought them in did not help them properly, or maybe they just were not meant for this type of business. All business are not for everyone that they are perfect for others. Most of the people that I have personally sponsored into this business have already got their initial investment back so if they decide to leave then they have not lost anything.

Its all perception! We shied away from businesses for 20 years until this one and we feel we picked the right one. If the product and business model did not work a 1.6 billion dollar publicly traded company would not have invested into it. Also the company donates money, time, products and services to at risk kids, non profits, and contribute when disasters happen like in Missouri. If all that means that this is a bad company then you who do not know as much as you think you know should really dig a little deeper. Keep and open mind and give people the benefit of the doubt.

Oh, I forgot to mention. Getting the car is not a requirement. Most people will hold off until they have developed the consistency needed to maintain that car. That is called a smart business decision. You want to talk about scams. Corporate America is a scam. Banks are scams, the stock market is a scam because they control what most people do. We create jobs. Some people can do it and some can not. Just like everything else in the world. Why would anyone try to get into the NFL or NBA when less than 1% of all the playing people in existence ever get there? The people that make it are the ones that do not let anyone get in their way. They are willing to do whatever it takes regardless of what people say. People told Spudd Webb, Earl Boykins, Bugsy Mogues and Darren Sproles that they would never play professional sports but they have. Why?

We have been conditioned since childhood to go to school, go to college, get a job, work there for 30-40 years then retire. None of that is guaranteed either. Just ask the people who have PHD’s, MAster’s Degree’s and Law degrees who are unemployed and looking for work.

I say, Do what makes you happy and don’t hate others for doing what they feel is right for them!

Do you even know what a pyramid is? Where you work is a pyramid. You are the foot soldiers, you are the ones who do all the work so management, middle management and upper management get paid all the big money. Do you realize that the gap is growing? Middle Class America is disappearing because they are working people harder so the corporations can keep all the money for themselves? Our government is a pyramid. I have people that I personally sponsored into Visalus that have eclipsed my income level. If it was truly a pyramid then that could not happen.

PYRAMID example

CEO/OWNER

Executive #1        Executive #2         Executive #3

Middle Mgr #1 Middle Mgr #2 Middle Mgr #3 Middle Mgr #4

then a much of hourly employees who do all the work only for the 8 people above them get all the pay!

You work in a pyramid every day UNLESS you are self employed and can duplicate yourself!

Thank you!
 Someone who cares! 
Oh, and 40,000 people joined in July, 60,000 in August and 80,000 people did in September. Do you think that growth would happen if it was not working? An 88% of those people will continue to use the products.

Chernobyl had a control system that failed. MLMs have no control mechanisms at all. Where is the“switch”that can be flipped in an MLM when enough sales people are hired? In a normal company a manager says,“We have enough, let’s stop hiring people at this point.”But in an MLM, there is no way to do this. An MLM is a human“churning”machine with no“off button.”Out of control by design, its gears will grind up the money, time, credibility, and entrepreneurial energy of well-meaning people who joined merely to supplement their income. Better to just steer clear of this monster to begin with. There is simply no way to avoid the built-in failure mechanism of MLMs. If a company chooses to market this way, it will eventually“hire”(with no base pay and charging to join) far too many people.
Thus, the only“control system”will be the inevitable losses and subsequent bad image the MLM company will gain after it does what it was designed to do: fail. And sooner or later we have got to stop blaming this particular MLM company or that, and admit that the MLM technique itself is fundamentally flawed.
For most MLMs, the product is really a mere diversion from the real profit-making dynamic. To anyone familiar with MLMs, the previous discussion (which focused so much on the fact that MLMs are“doomed by design”to reach market saturation and thus put the people who are legitimately trying to sell the product into a difficult situation) may seem to miss the point. The product or service may well be good, and it might oversaturate at some point, but let’s get serious. The product is not the incentive to join an MLM. Otherwise people might have shown an interest in selling this particular product or service before in the real world. The product is the excuse to attempt to legitimate the real money-making engine. It’s“the cover.”
Intuitively, we all know what is really going on with MLMs. Just don’t use the word“pyramid”!
“You see, if you can convince ten people that everyone needs this product or service, even though they aren’t buying similar products available in the market, and they can convince ten people, and so on, that’s how you make the real money. And as long as you sell to a few people along the way, it is all legal.”Maybe…
But the way to make money in all this is clearly not by only selling product, otherwise you might have shown an interest in it before, through conventional market opportunities. No, the“hook”is selling others on selling others on“the dream.”

True Story………

There once were two young con men, one had dropped out of high school, that wanted to become very rich.  One of them had a stepfather who had become rich in real estate. The rich stepfather backed the two young con men to start an MLM getting people to sell long distance service.  This long distance service was outdated and not very good.  But that didn’t matter what they were really selling was the chance to make money.  The long distance company went under but the two young con men made a quite a bit of money.  Alas no one else did. The two young men decided to take their money they made on the long distance scam and do a bigger and better one. After all they had learned so much. So they started looking around for a product.  They realized that the weight lost industry was booming. They said thats what we need to get into. They met Dr Stieman, a ear-nose doctor (used lightly quack may have been better) who was specializing in herbal treatment of ringing in the ear.  He had developed the mix. The two young con men said great just what we need. We can take advantage of peoples greed and their poor self body image. We can even give them a way to justify it by telling them thay are helping people.  We will tell them that it cures everything, they won’t know the difference they’ll be dreaming of the money they will make, no body cares about the product any way so it doesn’t matter what form it comes in or how it is packaged as long as it is cheap to make. They had their product and their form of business model MLM of course.  Now their market they figured out should be young people for the most part, they will not have the life experences to know this is a scam WE will target people who don’t have a job/doesnt want a job or doesn’t like the work they do/doesn’t want to work.  Everybody likes a rebel so we will make them feel like they are rebeling against the establishment who are all pyramids anyway.  That working a regular job are for losers. They give out titles to make these people feel important because they probably have never held a job with any reponsibilitites or titles.  When the bright young con men didn’t make enough they threw in a BMW. They make people feel important by telling them they are a distribtor, self employeed, a business owner.  They have plenty of meetings to keep people brainwashed. They tell you that only the lazy and dumb fell.  Anyone who tries to tell you the truth are dream killers, ignorant, haters, etc.  But the best thing about this business for the two young men who are making millions.  The company has no responsibility for these people, they have them sign that they know they are not an employee, representative, you have not been asked to sell and have not been asked to ask anyone else to sell, that if you run into any legal matters the company does not furnish you with a lawyer.  So you choose to lie ( they suggest you make your sales and weight loss so great.  You tell everyone how it cures everything. But it is not for everyone in case they try to come back on you. They have you work on your family and friend’s desperation to make life better for their families, their bad body image, and give them the justification of your helping people.  The market gets saturated with the product that is sold everywhere put in stores the people with illusions that they have a business,etc, that they are helping people, that they have a successful title ( ever wonder why they come so quick (it motivates you)  it all comes crashing down But the two young con men who never recognized these people as employees of their company have made millions and will go on to new adventures and new MLMs.  This has been the story of Visalus

I have never been to a jewelry or pocketbook party so I can not say anthing about them but they certainly sound like a pyramid also. But do they depend on recruiting? That is the question it also sounds like this may be like Avon a pyramid but not depending on recurits but sales. My proplem is with pyramids that depend on recuriting and making false claims about sales, weight loss, cures etc.  Amway has had charges brought against them and been convicted. But I don’t think they are so blantant as Visalus.

Here is my main concern with the Visalus since I’ve encountered the product through a couple of friends who are new reps.  This company seems to purport through its’reps the claim that these product cure almost anything.  Having been in the supplement industry for quite awhile I am deeply suspicious of anything that has artificial ingredients, is not organic and does not say where or how the ingredients are sourced.  I also think replacing two meals a day with a shake is a shock to the body and although will almost certainly produce weight loss will more than likely strain the liver and the kidneys unduly.  Has anyone studied the long term effects?  Do they use milk that has been RGBST treated for their shakes, I think women should be very concerned about this in particular. Has anyone even mentioned that nutrition is a highly individual and specialized science which cannot be meted out through one cure all product?  What may cure one person may kill another.  And what happens to the reps who are not qualified to make nutritional prescriptions for their clients when someone does actually die from this product who is going to get sued?  I’ll bet that it will not be the company.  I’m also not liking that when I see my friends now all they talk about is this product, they are always investing money to go to some new meeting for some more brainwashing.  I could tell they were very unhappy when I chose not to be their rep or their customer and I try to avoid saying how very scary i think this whole deal is because I don’t want to crush anyone’s dream and honestly at this point I don’t think they would listen to a word I say…Thank you for giving me the opportunty to vent.

You are a very intelligent person and so right about everything you said and the company doesn’t even reognize them as reps and takes no responsibility for anything. You are right to be scared.  I doubt if your friends would listen it is like a cult they do not hear a word.

You are my source for all things Visalus. Question If someone becomes Ambassador and gets $25,000. I know they get it paid over two years. What I am wondering is during that 2 years if they fall below Ambassador or quite do they still get the pay out? Just wondering.

I would not recomend any shake diet and I would never recommend a MLM as a income maker.  Both of these are designed for failure.  As everyone knows when you lose weight this way when you stop you gain it all back.  MLM is set up to fail when the market gets saturated. If you want to find other shakes simply go to your grocery, drug, or vitamin store.  If you want an extra income I would suggest getting a regular part time job.

What is sad is that you don’t realize how you are being used. It is your time and money that you are giving to a company that doesn’t even recognize you as an employee. You had to pay them to let you sell their product. You spend your money on gas and etc to have the challange parties and go to the meetings for them to keep you brainwashed.  They do not but any requirements on the quality or quantity of the people who sell their product. They encourage you to recruit your customers as your competition.  They do not safe guard your territory. You have to sign the lease for your car and when the market in your area has become saturatied and you cannot recruit anyone else and everybody has taken this stuff till they are sick of it. This is a product that claims to be the cure all ,have everything in it. But then you come back and say oh, by whe way you should really take this appitete suppresant and these vitamins and ad ins and etc. It gets too expensive for most people. You have spent money on the promo and there is no one else to give it to.  You start losing business, you spend more money on parties, and etc.soon you are in the hole and by the way you also have car payments Oh Joy! But the company has sold you and all of your ex-friends and family so they don’t care.

I am the owner of a $28 Million a year company.  I think if you can find a way to make a great living, go for it, but selling a pipe dream that has no hope of being around in 10 years, is immoral and should be illegal.  I know a lot of people on this“train”, it WILL stop and everyone will have to get off.  The issue I have is that the same people that push this product are the same people that brought Team National, and some kind of energy drink (in my state anyway) as the new thing.  They are from“apparent wealth”and people follow them like lost puppies. They have had tremendous success with the“Body by Vi”product, but when this goes bust in our area, it will bust big. Slow and steady is the way of the wise person, don’t quit your day jobs.

Bottom Line
If you want to be a MLM founders here is how you do it.
First you must realize that your aim is to blizzard the world with as much of your product as you can as fast as you can, then grab all you can and run. Don’t worry about any long term relationships or customer loyalty.
Second Get a simple cheaply made product, one developed by someone else is best , you don’t want anything slowing you down when it is time to run.  One that no one would actually go into a store and pick out to buy.  It would have to be forced on you by a friend with big promises and outlandish claims before you would ever buy it. You don’t want the time and expense of patents, USDA approval or any of that foolishness. If you make it with common ingrediants in a common way than there is no patent.
Third You want to keep your expenses and exposure to a minium So you do not want any more employees than you have to have because that would mean you would have to take some responsibilty for them. We don’t want any expense for employee taxs, benefits, or etc. The best way to get around this is make them pay $500 or $1000 to sell, that’s a windfall right there, next make them pay for all distributing expenses like advertising , gas, meeting expenses, samples, etc.  That way we not only don’t have to pay for it but we can charge them for it. We are on our way. To make it even better lets make them buy a certain amount each month.
Fourth we have to understand human nature and make the most of it. Greed lets play to the greed factor (although for most I feel it is just a need to try to do better for their families and themself) lets promise they can make all this money. We will make them feel like the greed is alright because they are helping people We can blow up the potential. People want to feel important lets give them big Titles that they have to qualify for every month, we want to keep them busy. They will be so embarrassed after bragging about their title that they will not want to lose it. We will also give them some feeling of self importance by telling them that they are bussiness owners, self employed, own distributorships, contractors. This will make them feel inmportant and keep them in there longer paying us the money and not worry about having a job.  We can charge for all kinds of extras web sites, training, etc. We’ll have monthly brainwashing sessions and have them come from every where and they’ll pay for it.  We’ll all get drunk and pat each other on the back. We will teach them every dirty trick in the book to use on their friends and families.  Everyone wants to think they belong to an elite group. That’ll keep’em going and paying us.And to keep them in it longer we’ll tell them that they can get something wonderful free (Maybe a BMW) but they have to get it theirself and they have to keep out there paying us and qualifing for payments to the wonderful free thing. If they don’t make it will cost us nothing and no responsibility or exposure to us. Its their baby. We will make it so they will find us new victims to stay in the game and the victims will finds us some too and so on. And everyone will be paying us until there is no  one left. Then we will take our toys and run. Of course all the other good people will be falling off and new ones taking their place. All the time paying us and selling the product. And when it is all over we’ll just tell the poor fools you are just a loser and it is your fault you didn’t make it. Somepeople were just never meant to be business owners but employees.  The people that critize us are just ignorant of our business, are haters and are negative about life.

This hater mentality is what is killing our world!! It it’s NOT for you, than dont look at it.If you dont like whats on this or that channel,change it.If you dont like BMW’S,go buy something else. All this Visalus bashing,Why? Because it doesnt make sense to YOU! Look at fast food Giants or the Bevergae industry with there“high frutcose corn crap”. They are killing those who buy there products.We dont go around bashing them.Instead we go around EDUCATING people about the dangers of unhealthy eating and offer them a healthy alternative. If its not for YOU, then why are you on a place like this bashing when you should be doing whatever it is that YOU love!!!

First of all, the author is outright lying to you readers.  First off, he states very few people get the BMW, and that it takes forever to do it…wrong!!  How is that my RD got hers in 7 mths, and how is it that her mother got hers in 6, and how is it that another got his in 8????  It is not hard…does it fall in your lap..NO, you have to work at it, like any job.  But it is still easy…you just tell people about a great product that they can see working in you…I have been on it for 30 days and lost 16lbs!!  I feel amazing, and as a distributor, I have recieved two paychecks…of course I am not ready to quit my day job just yet, but with just a mth in it, I am sure that in a year, I will match my income.  Think about it, if you do nothing in a year, you will be exactly where you are today…so if you are ambitituous and want to be healthy and help others do the same…this is the best company to work for.
 Tanya Chancellor 
SOunds like you have a crappy family…but if you want to blame it on Visalus, then I suppose thats your choice!!  Don’t blame a company for your families problems!!
 Tanya Chancellor 
I am thinking you are the one that is brainwashed…you obviously do not know what a pyramid is.  With Visalus, if your upline struggles, then you can surpass them if you do better than them…you don’t have to worry about them doing well for you to do well.  It’s not that big of a deal..either take it or leave it..your choice.  I can see the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
 Tanya Chancellor 
Booze is not a typicak part of a challenge party.  Healthy eating and a helathy lifestyle does not include booze…once againyour facts are wrong.  If your family has done it that way, then they are doing it wrong.
 Tanya Chancellor 
You are clearly the only bitter person here.  I am not a distributor, but the shakes have changed my life as far as health goes, and my husband who is a diabetic has been taken off of insulin due to his weight loss with the shakes, our Dr. has nothing but praise for his new diet..and you know what..I get my shakes for free…so no $$ lost here, just a better life.  It’s not brainwashing, the proof is in the pudding, I am healthier than I have been in years…did I mention, for free??  It is a good product, it tastes great, I get to eat what I want during the day in moderation, and my skin looks amazing.  =)
 Tanya Chancellor 
say Dr. Elizzyp…lol
 Tanya Chancellor 
I also work for a car company…and you can’t compare apples to oranges.  Car companies have special insurance for their demos, and for their employees, and some will even pay for them, and some will make half the car payment etc…it’s not anything like the Bimmer club.

You keep saying that while on Vi you don’t eat…but that is sooo not true.  I eat throughout the day, I have two good and healthy high in protein snacks, and a good and healthy meal, and have two shakes a day!!  I eat, I eat well, I have energy, I feel great…stop lying!
 Tanya Chancellor 
I make close to 60k a year…so I am not desperate for money, and I did want to lose weight, and I have.  Thanks Visalus for helping me to start living a healthier lifestyle.
 Tanya Chancellor 
rude
 Tanya Chancellor 
weight watchers does sell food…It is in the frozen section…right next to the other delicious tv dinners..lmao…plus counting points does not work for everyone…and you have to pay to weigh..what kind of mess is that???  Weight watchers, nutri system..etc..all have peoples best interests in mind..they want to help people get healthy..same with Visalus.  It’s not different as far as that is concerned.
 Tanya Chancellor 
^^^ what he said!
 Tanya Chancellor 
rude…again
 Tanya Chancellor 
Love this!
 Glorifesimon 
quick question….is the drink ALL you take during the day?  Do they promote exercise or proper food diet?  cuz…i have a cousin who’s husband is selling this stuff and he posts that he’s having a ( insert flavor here) shake all the time.  It’s kind of annoying to see all his status updates actually.  same with hers cuz all they talk about is the new people they’ve recruited and what they’re drinking..  OH and is it safe for pregnant women?
 livingproof 
Folks, this is what I know…. I am an 39 year old female. I am a certified personal trainer and I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis&amp;Rheumatoid arthritis 8 months ago. It took nearly 18 months of nearly dabilitating symptoms to be diagnosed. Additionally I gained 52lbs and sank into a deep depression.  The answer ofcourse was to fill me with countless prescription drugs that make me feel worse most times than the symptoms and I have seen no results from any of them. I have been on Visalus for 14 days and I have stopped taking 3 of the meds. Not only am I waking up in the morning with far less pain I have felt well enough to get back in the gym. As a personal trainer I am familar&amp;have tried all the supplements our there that you can imagine. None of which have shown the results that I have seen with Visalus. I have lost 8lbs. in 14 days! I took this product to my doctor who sits on the board of one of the top 50 hospitals in the US and he is so convinced in this product that he is pushing to have products such as boost etc replaced with Visalus. Now, is this business a“pyramid”..I could care less. The prodcut WORKS and I am living proof of it. You can’t will MS&amp;RA away believe me if you could I would have long ago. So those of you that are going to say”your attitude changed etc and that is why you feel better”. That’s BS. The only thing that has changed is that I started on Visalus! Is Visalus the miracle cure? Is it going to make MS&amp;RA go away? No, probably not..but I feel better and that is all that matters. Money, BMW’s….who cares!!! I FEEL better…
 Leilani Mairet 
You are SOOOOOO clueless!!  Honestly.  First off, I got my product FREE in 11 days, my husband got his FREE in 5 days.  I made a paycheck the very first week in Visalus and yes I promote the challenge and am VERY proud of it.  Second, Primarica does NOT sell bogus services, you are full of it.  They are listed on the stock exchange and go through insurance commissions so you need to watch what you say about them too.  You are so misinformed that is is crazy!! Quite honestly did you get permission to use the logo’s and pics you are using? A response to someone like you is a waste of cyberspace!

 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Summary of What’s Wrong With Multi-Level Marketing

MLMs are“doomed by design”
to recruit too many salespeople, who in turn will then attempt to
recruit even more salespeople, ad infinitum. For
many, the real attraction of involvement in multi-level marketing is
the thinly veiled pyramid con-scheme made quasi-legal by the presence of
a product or service. The
ethical concessions necessary to be“successful”in many MLM companies
are stark and difficult to deal with for most people. Friends and family should be treated as such, and not as“marks”for exploitation.When
it comes to selling product, MLM sales reps are probably no more
aggressive or obnoxious than ordinary salespeople. Since most are not
salespeople by nature, and it is characteristic that MLMs attract
few people with any experience selling this particular product or
service, they usually sell through pre-fab“parties”or home“demos.”
Thus, sales pressure is exerted by situation, if at all.

It should be noted that
when selling product, the only distinction from a real-world business is
the possibility for deception due to the“looseness”of the MLM and the
incentive to exaggerate claims without
any accountability. Other than this, selling product in an MLM is fairly
similar to selling any product in the real world.

But when it comes to
getting you“signed up”as a“distributor,”the MLMers get pushy and
deceptive beyond the boundaries of polite social norms.

Remember, an MLM is defined by its rewarding people to recruit others in multiple levels. Many
have left high-paying jobs to“pursue their dreams”in an MLM. Having
been conned so dramatically, they do not easily admit defeat. It seems
easier to cling to the bad dream in an increasing cycle of desperation
to make the MLM work against all odds.“Losers”at the bottom congregate
into support groups, perhaps spinning-off another MLM where they can be
“boss.”

There is an undeniable
camaraderie among MLMers. But for everyone else,“there goes the
neighborhood.”It is saddening to see people being encouraged against
all instinct and common sense to chase after an
illusory“pot of gold,”but what can be done?
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
That is wonderful news about your health. But your magic bullet attitude toward Visalus products is alarming. If you are a certified personal trainer, then you of all people should know that everyone is made different, and what might work for one person may not work or the other.
 Matthew 
REALLY?  What company did you promote?  Can you SHOW me the proof?  Can you SHOW me the effort you put into promoting it, the people you talked too, the amount of time you put in, your leads?  I can show the proof I make at Visalus.  I DO put work into it and DO have a list of people that actually ASK me to use the product.  I DO have far far more customers than distributors.  Thus a need for my product.  I DO have people that sign up for my product without even talking to me.  It is a BUSINESS, one that is fun with many rewards but a business.  Did you actually do anything at your home business or did you sit on your butt and“pretend”to be busy?  SHOW ME YOUR PROOF AND I’LL SHOW YOU MINE, lol.  But you don’t have any, that’s why you are way too funny.  Any business has to be worked to be rewarded and especially in sales.  The effort you put in today will be rewarded down the line.  You are probably one of those people who are young and jump from job to job with no work ethic if it doesn’t come easy to you and no clue on what it’s like to actually dedicate your time to something. And seriosuly, that is OK, that’s why they have an hourly wage for you.   If you work at this business just like at any other home business, Mary Kay, Avon, whatever, you will make money.  It’s a matter of actually doing the work and  building a client base, something you obviously know nothing about.  Even Donald Trump agrees with Network Marketing and says that’s the only way to go!  So, yeah, basically start showing your PROOF, I don’t know, showing who you REALLY ARE, since you refuse to show your name anywhere and HIDE behind your lies.  And you really should think before your post logos of other peoples companies and pics and use the copyright illegally because people that have way more money than (those that own the Network Marketing Company you are bashing without any proof)  are probably watching what you are saying.

You should NEVER ever slam a company without actually doing a complete research. I have done many MLM. So I would be the first to shun all mlm companies just from pure disappointments. Yes, I am an easy prey, and I have been suckered to joining a lot of companies that make promises. When I found Visalus Sciences from a friend of a friend, I immediately had an opinion of a simple“No!”After a few weeks, I was told again to try the product for 30 days or get your money back. That was a good reason for me to try it. I got a sample from the friend of the friend. I like the taste of it. I ordered a bag knowing that I will probably have to call and get a refund. After 1 week of trying out the product, I realized that I don’t need my Prevacid any longer for my acid reflux. Then I noticed that I wasn’t ordering a lot of desserts every night for my sweet tooth. It took me a week to upgrade my order to get an extra bag of Vi-Shape. Than later, I found out that I can promote and make money. Bingo.. if I (me) the skeptical and the negative actually like this product, I have nothing to lose. I love this product whether I make money or not. I am now a promoter. I wish I found this product sooner to help with my problem issues. I wish the world could use this product to control obesity. I have lost 14 lbs! I am not a very big person so this is a huge feat. I had high triglycerides too. Thanks to Visalus. I can that in past tense:) OMG, don’t take my words for it or anyone else for that matter. Try it for 30 days. If you are not happy, get your money back. Oh, I don’t have a bmw, YET. But I will. Lastly, I get my products for free and get a few hundred dollars for commission. Don’t generalize. Just have an open mind and try it out. If you have a good team, you will succeed. Here is my site if you wish to order. I don’t care if you believe me or not.. just try it. You can thank me later when you feel energized and losing weight. 90daynow . bodybyvi . com

Have you read the nutrition facts or did any research on the vi-shape nutritional shakes? As a personal trainer I would for sure recommend to any of my clients, at any age. Whether it be for weight loss or supporting a healthy lifestyle. I don’t ever recall saying it was a“magic bullet”as with any supplement you must incorporate exercise and a healthy diet. In fact from all of the research that I have done on visalus they promote both 100%. Before starting any diet plan you should consult your doctor which of course I encourage all of my clients to do. For me, this is making a difference when countless things have not..you call it a scam and I will call it a healthy lifestyle and my glimmer of hope. Take good care…
 BellaNova 
And Visalus only gives you a monthly“bonus”towards the car…they do not buy the car for you.   You must qualify for the financing all on your own–in other words you sign a contract with the car company to buy a car.  If you drop below your minimum level to qualify or if for any reason Visalus feels like it, no more money…but you still have an expensive car payment to make.  That finance company is not going to care if you are getting the money from Visalus or not, they will repossess that car from YOU and it will go on YOUR credit if you don’t make the payments.
 Izzy 
Have you seen on the news and in the papers about an 18 year study that showed that vitamin supplements do not do anything and can be harmful if you get to much of one thing. Calcium is the only supplement that has been showned to actually help.  My question has always been and no one has answered If Visalus is so great why do they then push you to buy vitamins and brain pills, add ins, appitite suppresent.  You have been sucked into there illusions and am sorry to inform you it is not a business.
 Izzy 
Getting the BMW is not hard you are right on that If you have a job and good credit were you can get the lease yourself.  Keeping it is hard most end up with a huge lease payment with no money to pay for it. I repeat what has been stated before you do not work for this company, you do not represent them, they have not asked you to sell for them and they do not asked you to ask others to sell for them, It is in the small letters on the contract. That is why they can encourage you to lie about your weight lost, money you make,and how many people it has helped. Because they take no responsibilty to you or for you.  They state they do not furnish you a lawyer if you get sued. Anyone would lose weight on any meal replacement product but will not keep it off when they go off it and who wants to drink shakes the rest of their life.
 IZZY 
Because I feel when there is wrong being done we as humans should try to right it. Try to protect those who don’t have no had the life lesson to avoid getting hurt.  These are hard times and in hard times the scammer come out in droves.
 ElizzyP 
You are suppose to have two shakes a day and then a sensible meal and maybe some fruit. People I know that tried it got really hungry and weak, They try to get you to but add ins, vitamins, appitite suppresant, brain power mix, etc. It says in the small print not for pregant women.
 EizzyP 
What tree? It is still a  pyramid because it depends on recruiting more people. Not what the ones upline are doing.
 Izzy 
I have seen picture of the meetings last one in Orlando and EVERYONE is holding drinks and bottles of booze. I am not talking about the challenge party. No I wouldn’t think they would have booze it is only when they get together to celebrate scamming their victims and for some more brainwashing.
 Elizzyp 
They asked for my suggestions. not a prescription.
 Izzy 
I didn’t say it was like the bimmer club, NO WAY. He doen’t work for a car co. I was pointing out what a real business with a real employees does to furnish them with cars.
 Izzy 
You do not have to buy the weight watcher brand of food to be on the program. It is a lot of difference you are trying to talk your clients in being distributors.
 Izzy 
Truthful again.
 Izzy 
You have drank the kool-aid and been through the brainwashing. You will learn in time.  As far as bashing this company.  Everyone should speak up with they see a wrong being done to other people and try to right it. They play on everyone’s poor body image.
 Izzy 
More kool-aid drank another brain washed. Another victim. Another real world to come crashing down.
 IZZy 
You are SOOOOOO brainwashed. Sorry for your friends and families.
 IZZy 
Also the human weakness of having poor body image is something that everyone has and easy to exploit. Also since they don’t work for the company or represent them the company can not be held liable for anything thing they say or do. so the company can encourage them to say anything no matter how inane and when they come back to the company they just say don’t blame me they work for us.   Oh this is so much fun.
 IZZy 
I have a wonderful normal family. WE had never had a cross word until Visalus came into our world and taught them to be so rude and combative.  And the really bad part is they end up getting had. I would not  ever try to get my family and friends into an MLM I care to much for them and I resented that they would me.
 IZZy 
If you are getting yours free than you have paid at least $49 and are selling at least three ( that by the way you have to keep eo get it free. If one becomes a rep (used loosely) then you have to replace him, if one quits you have to replace him sooooooo you muxt be a distributor!!!!!! I am sure your doctor would be happy with weight lost no matter how you lost it.
 IZZy 
sorry meant don’t work for us. miss print.
 IZZy 
Again if it is so great and has so much why do they even make and puch to sell all the other products. If the nutrition facts are so great, by the way I have and am not impressed the printing and wording is so foolish, why do they push you to buy vitamins, add ins, appitite suppresients, brain power, etc.  No one has ever answered that question. But I keep asking hoping that some one has an answer.
 IZZy 
I would recommend that you read all the posts here but especially those of Jerry and Ex Visalus Distributor.
 IZZy 
If you want proof I would suggest you read ex Visalus Distributors’s posts and Jerry’s oh go ahead and read all the posts.
 http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1010607253 Peter Franzone 
I signed up as a favor to my account then I find out how you must hit a level a month to stay a distributor; when I ask them to stop automation shipment as soon as they got my other credit card they still keep shipping.  I canceled withing the 30 days now they say I did not. Now I can’t recover over $800 and they have the product I returned.  Any suggestions, beside small claims court?
 Clasimp 
I don’t know if it is a scam or not, but I can’t help noticing that most of the visalus people are still fat. If it is a weight loss product they are promoting and if it works, why are they still fat?
 Mike 
Because they arent using their own product like they should. They are spending their earned money on eating what they want haha
 Mikeswork1 
How many successful weight loss products have you made? Where did you get your doctorate in nutrition? I wish I knew as much as an expert like you in whether or not things work without even trying them. You must be God or something. You’re pretty intelligent and must run a successful company since you have all this time to sit on here telling everyone the product doesnt work and its a scam. Amazing how the ratio of haters to lovers is 1:900
 IZZy 
You don’t have to be the smartest person in the world to know what everyone knows that has an ounce of common sense. Ive seen enough I don’t have to be hit over the head with a hammer.
 IZZy 
I never said that you didn’t eat but I know to lose weight you are suppose to replace two meals with shakes and a lot of people I know got hungry and weak on this plan even though they had healthy snacks too.
 Elizzyp 
Yes they were rude
 Fields 
I read an article in the newspaper the other day about scams.  It said that during bad times the“last dollar companies”come out of the woodwork to pray on the desperate. They are called“last dollar companies”because they know people are hurting and need to make extra money and they are there to take advantage of that. They take the last dollars they have because they know people will spend their last dollar to try to make things better for their families.  Visalus is one of those“last dollar companies”ready willing and able to suck the last dollar from anyone that they can scam into letting them do it.
 IZZy 
It is all the partying at their brainwashing meetings celebrating their scams. They eat, drank, and are merry.
 Elizzyp 
Keep bugging the person that signed you up and the company. Threaten to inform the BBB (not they are worth abything) and any regulatory dept you can think of and your Congressmen and state elected officiers and do it sometimes this gets some action. I seen this same thing posted a lot .  If you find one ask them what they did.  Good Luck.
 Fields 
If that is the ratio you came up with you might want to take some math courses.
 Fields 
You sound rather desperate to make a sale. Just try it 30 days or 90 days just try it     Call me    call me just try it………..
 Fields 
Any one who has taken a creative writing class or saling class would recommend the blue print they have provided you. Identify that it is real. Establish creditability (I am 39 year old certified personal trainer)  Identify the trouble (MS and RA) Provide the cure (Visalus of course. Establish nuetrality No probably not  Go in for the Kill (I feel better)
 Samuelneedleman 
I have been hooked up with recurring monthly shipments and bills against my will.  I have called to cancel and was told that it was cancelled, only to find yesterday that it is not.  On their website, I see a number of emails like mine.
 JackMontana 
Holy cow Mathew. Have you honestly never researched an MLM before. Every forum you read on all MLMs for the past 30 years all look exactly the same. People coming forward who recognize it as a scam and then a few‘believers’who claim it’s awesome if you just‘work at it’.
Your responses are so cliched it’s hilarious.
By design MLMs are doomed to fail–it’s just pure mathematics. A few in the beginning will make a lot of $$ but over time the new distributers dry up and the model collapses.
Try googling Amway, Mona Vie, Nutrimetics and about 50 other vitamin based MLM schemes. You’ll recognize yourself somewhere within the forum.
 JackMontana 
Yeah. Leilani–your pretty typical of 1st time multilevel marketing prisoners. You’ve never seen this doomed business model before so you take it all in hook, line&amp;sinker. You’re not bad people, just not very well informed as to the history behind these type of scams.
 JackMontanaa 
You clearly haven’t heard of the law of regression to the mean. It basically states that when a person is sick there are 3 things that will happen with no help from the outsid world- 1/They get sicker2/They get better 3/ They stay the same.
When thousands of people take these new miracle cures a certain number are going to feel better just through chance. Those are the testimonials you’ll see on these forums. It wasn’t the‘magic cure’that did it. They were due to get better anyway.
This is different from the placebo effect but that also contributes somewhat.

Unfortunatley people who don’t have a science background look at the shonky‘evidence’for a product and assume it’s all legit. Show me a peer reviewed double blind placebo controlled study published in a reputable journal and I’ll start to believe.

Remember one of the basic principles of scientific method- Testimonials are not evidence.

 JackMontana 
Yes. I’ve built up a multi million dollar portfolio from nothing by using sound investment principles while working a regular job as a scientist for a disease management company. Do I qualify?

I’ve seen these MLMs come and go over the last 20 years, I almost got sucked into Amway myself before I realized that the heads of these MLMs have been scamming people for years.
They are all based on the same principle–find a product that no store would stock and nobody would look for in a store. Jack up the price artificially by claiming it is more potent (Amway soap), more powerful (Mona Vie prune juice) or has magical health giving properties (Visalus).
Convince your distributers that if they work hard enough and believe to achieve etc etc they can get rich.
Oversaturate the market.
Provide lots of anecdotal evidence that the product works- nb. In the real scientific community anecdotes never qualify as evidence.
Eventually go bust with the majority of distributers never making a dime.

You can make money if you get in early enough but just be aware that the money you take in now is really coming from some suckers pocket a year or so from now through a series of financial dominoes. You are essentially stealing from people that you probably will never meet becuae of the inevitable collapse of the system. If you feel comfortable stealing from people then go right ahead with your MLM.

By the way, just because a few doctors endorse a product means nothing. The healthcare system in this country is so screwed up that physicians will say just about anything to make some extra money.
It may pay for you to learn something about the scientific method and realize that unless a trial is double blind placebo controlled, randomized and peer reviewed it isn’t worth the paper its printed on.
 HP 
So if the product is so great, why isn’t it sold in shops. That is the most efficient way to provide a low cost solution to a common problem.
 JackMontana 
The difference between your pyramid scheme and working for a corporation is this-
Everyone in the corporation gets paid, some more some less but all employees have a realistic expectation before they sign an employment contract.
In a Pyramid/MLM the top 1/3  of the pyramid make all the money. The middle 3rd break even and the bottom 3rd lose money. Do you know anyone that goes to work for a corporation and pays their employers for the privelage.

In a pyramid a sponsor CAN make less than his downline by simply failing to recruit as many people. Take the Airplane Pyramid. If you turn up with only 2 people under you but those 2 turn up with 10 each, they get paid but you don’t. A you denying that the Airplane game is a pyramid.

I am not a user or distributor-weight fine and to busy for another venture, but have several friends who are users and 2 are distributors.  Amazed at the weight loss and health improvements of every user I know.  One came off insulin and dr reorded blood tests that were so good he thought test was mistaken, another lost 53 lbs in 90 days and is keeping it off.  the distributors have shown me their checks.  the product is good and the company pays as promised.  If I had to be scamed-then scam me all you like this way. I believe most of those bad mouthing never tried it to begin with.
 Sadsa 
Hey guess what.  Instead of buying useless overpriced supplements that nobody ever heard of, try proper diet and exercise for a change.  I agree with the author completely.  If the products are as great as they’re hyped up to be, then why not promote them to legitimate health product distributors.  These so called sales gurus prey on people who don’t feel like doing diet and exercise and instead are looking for a quick easy fix to their health problems.  I guarantee they have people employed just to go around the internet and pretend they made a ton of money selling this crap, or experienced miracle weight loss.
 http://pulse.yahoo.com/_H4WYRHP627RFJJWWTJABKNL2EI waynem 
You are correct in that proper diet and exercise are the way to go. I myself throw some greens, water, and fruit in a blender each morning for breakfast. but most people are not going to do that. Over half of our population is overweight mainly caused by fast foods, hurried schedule and laziness to cook. If some of these can reduce their weight and sugar levels by drinking something that tastes good-more power to them. One of my relatives is very obese, been trying for years to talk diet to her to no avail.  She now using and loving the shake and is losing weight-her life will be improved because of that shake.  Maybe not better than diet and exercise but better than what she was doing.
Direct marketing is just another method of marketing that has its place, every company must decide how it will market it’s products.  Not that the stores will not carry it but the company will not allow the retail outlets to do so.  They will disband any distributor who places it in a retail establishment. It has been shown to be better than many of the products in the stores. Ideal Protein is better but costs much much more.  Would not be surprised if allowed in stores after a few years but at this time that is probably the fastest way to get it to the market in force-so I can see why some companies choose that style of marketing.  Blue Cross and Blue Shield has a wellness clause where they will reimburse the cost to the employee, ADA is now considering it for endorsement. and many physicians are now beginning to recommend-they saw the results it made on some of their patients. I will listen to these endorsements over those of someone like myself who has no qualifications to decide if anything fit or unfit.   I shunned this for 2 months but when I personally saw one co-worker lose 53 lbs and completely control his bad sugar levels  and saw another pick up 2400 in his 3rd month I realized this may be one mlm that actually is on the up and up-and if I had the need and personality to get into something like this I would choose this company.
The author is right but he left a few facts out.  the company only gives you money to help cover the payment of BMW and warns them to be in a position to maintain that level of production.  They do not have to buy or lease a new BMW-it has to be a 2000 or above-which you can get for less than 600 per month.  You may choose to receive $300 per month in lieu of the BMW which I would do because that is one car I never wish to maintain.  As of today they announced it may be black, silver, or green.
As most of you I did not form my opinion by research, scientific tests, or knowledge. I formed mine from a RN friend, licensed dietician friend, 2 dtrs who are nurses. relatives and 3 co-worker users, and 2 co-worker who are distributors, and my own physician.
I have the right to participate or not and if some others participate and improve their health-then more power to them even if they are looking for a quick health fix and we all should have better things to do than this immaterial pissing match.

Do you really thjnk people are fooled by Visalus’trick of I have no dog in this fight. No one is that dumb.  I am suprised that people still fall for these MLM.  In the environment this world is in today with lots of scuzzy people out there trying to con us out of our hard earned money we don’t really need our friends and families conning us too.  I would never try to sell my friends and family anything.  If I get something they would like to have they can get it at the same place I got it, they don’t need me to sell it to them. Mixing friends/family with business is always a bad ideal.  If anyone tries to get you to sell to them , they aren’t doing you any favors.
 Fields 
Don’t let them get by with it. report them to Attorney General’s office both state and national. Report them to BBB (although this is a useless agency) and to any regulatory agency you can find out about. Report them to your local, state, and national elected office.  If they get by with it they will keep doing it.

Tell that to Warren Buffet-mlm is not what it was 20 yrs ago but am sure there are alot of crooks in it as they are in everything. Have never looked at a mlm before-as an accountant I could easily see the math never added up-this one was in my face and I saw the results. As for the no dog-believe me if i was in it I would tell you-because if I didn’t  believe in it enough I should not be there anyway.  If it wasn’t for the fact I am thin, no sales personality, and trying to run 3 businesses I would definitely give it a try.  I will state the friend and family business statement is correct.

Ouuuuu you get a company car to play with…big deal. It’s a BMW omg…i have to work for this company! NOT. I would rather work for the large corporate company I do now and pay for the BMW in my driveway that IS MINE AND NOT COMMISION BASED….people need to actually work. Waiting around for companies to let them borrow their company cars means shit. Its upsetting to know we live in a society based on false promises and hope. how many of you out there are slaving away promoting this stupid“weight loss”garbage when you could have a company car for free working for a better company and not have to sell any of that weight loss garbage? It’s really sad knowing people have to work for these types of companies and people believe anything they read. It’s amazing how if one onth you dont make your quota for a monthly commision youll loose the precious BMW you can borrow for free? And I bet the majority of the ppl who can finally go borrow the car cant even get it because they are lower class blue collared people trying to get by in life. This company probably doesnt even have benefits life insurance for their employee but they sure do have a car they can borrow…..which doesnt belong to them….they will never own…they will have to return…

stupid people.

While I’m not a Visalus distributor, I have had some experience in the MLM industry and it just amazes me that so many people on this discussion board are spending so much time to bash a single company when there are hundreds and hundreds of networking ventures out there.   Has anyone here said a single THING that hasn’t already been said about Amway, Shaklee and Herbalife more than 30 years ago?

Okay, we get it: most of you don’t like Multi-Level Marketing.  You don’t like the idea of selling, you don’t like recruiting, you don’t like the products these companies market on a“word of mouth”basis. Fine and dandy…no need for you to get involved.  But what I find interesting is that many posters simply seem to feel that because not everyone“makes it”or that there is attrition, that MLM is simply a bad business model.   Interesting, because in my field—Financial Services—the turnover for new stockbrokers and life insurance agents is AT LEAST 95% after one year.  And this is after they pass aptitude tests, study to get licensed and undergo weeks of proven training.  Yet even the best and brightest often“fail.”Does this mean that Financial Services is a bad business and no-one should ever consider the field?  Hardly.

The same thing holds true in MLM which is simply a group of people finding a product they like and looking to share the same opportunity with other like-thinking people.  Is it easy…well no, because if it were easy then EVERYBODY WOULD BE DOING IT.   Fact is, whether you make a few hundred, a few thousand or a few million, network marketing can be great training for any other business requiring some smarts, a great deal of persistence, the ability to see beyond just today and a desire to work with others in a TEAM setting as opposed to the“dog-eat-dog”environment of the corporate world.

One personality trait IS REQUIRED: the desire to achieve more, the desire to be your own boss.  Networking is NOT the place for those who simply believe that signing up earns them a paycheck; sorry folks, but there is WORK involved.  This is a business where, like any sales position,“You reap what you sow.”That simple fact is lost on so many, like the many who post negatively on this forum.  Even the“reviewer”who so easily dismissed Visalus at the top of this page seems to believe that everyone would be better suited to just go get your basic, average, easy-to-find high-paying JOB.  Really?  That’s your answer to anyone with an entrepreneurial spirit?  Look, not everyone is going to be Steve Jobs and not everyone is going to hit it big in multi-level-marketing, but for those who seek independence, who like the idea of their own business without massive capital requirements, who want to avoid the hassles of employees, rent and all the other headaches that can accompany a“traditional business,”the perhaps network marketing is the way to go.

Why should anyone have a problem with that?

I am a user/distributor of Visalus and it’s working great for me! I have Cystic Fibrosis and this product line is vastly improving my health! My kit was paid for in two weeks and the rest is all profits! Yep, sounds like a scam to me! Visalus had a convention this past weekend where they gave away $6.25 million in bonuses! 12,000 people attended. They are giving away an average of 20 BMWs a day! BMW has requested they add a color besides black because they’re having trouble keeping up with orders-Green and Silver have been added to the options! It is not carried in stores simply because that is not how it’s marketed. This company is changing lives and people who don’t know about it are scared of it and that’s why they give it bad reviews like this one! I was a big skeptic, I turned it down fir two months before I finally decided to just listen. I tried the product(delicious by the way) and started feeling better rather quickly. I’ve been on it for a month now and I have energy that I lost ten years ago. My Drs have been giving me all kinds of meds trying to get me healthier with little success. I’m running around like a teenager again! If you don’t like network marketing, simply stay away from it! Don’t call it a scam and ruin someone’s opportunity to decide for themselves just because you don’t understand it! By the way, as I said, I’ve been in for a month, so I’m not a Higher up in the company! But I know dozens of people, personally, with great success. Criticize me if you want, I’m sure some will, but I don’t care! Visalus is most definitely NOT A SCAM! Thank you for reading MY story and I encourage everyone to formulate your own opinion before you assume!

Like most people on here who are ViSalus customers and distributors, myself included. We all stand by the company. Its not a scam. I have always been leery about mlm companies and constantly turned away from it. My father is a professional fire fighter and had excess weight. Along with him were other fire fighters and they all tried the product. After 52 days my dad dropped from 242 to 210 and another dropped 56 pounds in 60 days and this one was taken off his blood pressure medication and it brought his cholesterol down from 310 to 130 in 60 days. Bash it all you want but until you try the product no one will actually take you seriously. This article doesn’t give an accurate description of the company either. It exaggerates all the details especially the corporate ones. The company tells you to wait a couple months before going to get a BMW to make sure you are stable enough with promotions and even if you fail to make your mark which is harder to do than not, they give you a 2 month grace period where they still send you the check. I also went to the convention in Atlanta over the weekend and we saw and spoke with so many people whose lives have changed from taking the product and/or promoting it. My father is a great example. He now promotes it along with me. I didn’t have any weight to lose but i put on 8 lbs of muscle in 28 days without taking whey or Creatine WHILE maintaining a 7.5% body fat and that’s not my BMI Be a skeptic. i encourage you to…I was until I saw and tried the product. I saw others have amazing results when other weight loss products fail. But don’t criticize it without trying it. That said, if you have any questions, do research on the product itself, compare it with others but don’t rely on articles like these with misgiving information. Talk to someone who has tried it too.
Good Luck and God Bless

25 bmw’s earned every single day, 1.2 million in BMW bonus money earned in the last 90 days. 1800 people earned their BMW in last 90 days. The guy that wrote this article has typos all over the place. Also BMW contacted ViSalus CEO and said we can’t keep up with the Black BMW  demand. Asked that ViSalus offer more colors. Now you can get ViSalus Green and Silver. BMW is doing ViSalus a favor and offers all who earn the BMW Wholesale Pricing. Also you can buy a used one too if you want. you can bet a BMW motorcycle if you please as long as the color is right. Also just fyi author…. you have a grace period were you still receive the car bonus if you do not for some reason qualify.   The car is at the second level of the company.

you probably will not find too much because they have lobbyist. people they pay to keep quiet and keep the negative out. they filter all the negativity that you try to search for. try googling visalus scams or something to that nature and what you will get a lot of the times is a negative header or title and when you click on it, you will read positive things about it, that it isn’t a scam and that it is a moneymaker and it is healthy. I am not saying that it doesn’t work because i have tried to research it and even tried it, and i did lose weight but it was nothing to really boast about but as a business model  i am not sure if it is worth it. It works for some i suppose but I know an entire visalus team (not a huge team) that the members have not even made director and have been trying for a year. Only one person, the one who got them to try it has recently made the title of Regional Director (that is the first major milestone in Visalus) it took him more than a year. He earns peanuts in my opinion, has a bimmer he can hardly afford and its a used 3 series with no amenities. but the company boast serveral people who have made ambassador in less then 42 days. If you want a good example of what i am talking about when you search for visalus scams check this site out.

The United States Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) warns“Not all multilevel marketing plans are legitimate. Some
are pyramid schemes. It’s best not to get involved in plans where the
money you make is based primarily on the number of distributors you
recruit and your sales to them, rather than on your sales to people
outside the plan who intend to use the products.”

think about it: you can make money by just selling the product, that amount just selling the product based on just customers is very little. ie: if i sell $1000 worth in product this month my payout is about 250 dollars this month. ok so i am $250 dollars richer but its not enough to pay my bills of which i have nearly no debt. that is actually my gas and electric bill only.
first i need to get 3 customers on the same kit i have so that mine is free, then i get 6 distributors under me who each have 3 customers of their own and are all active and not to mention you need $12500 in group points and i am a Regional Director(RD) and i am making supposedly anywhere from $1000-3000 dollars this month and i get a $600 dollar allowance towards my bimmer. So i have to put people in BMWs to grow and earn lots of cash in shorter time period. sounds really easy right…?? think again its hard enough getting yourself to RD trying getting a crew of only 6 individuals to do the same. want to make ambassador(AMB) you need to put 12 individuals in bimmers. by the way u only get the bimmer perk and all your earnings if you purchase the $500 dollar ESS distributor kit. otherwise you get very little with the basic distributor kit.

most money is primarly made by recruitment of successful distributors in your downline, that is where the money is mostly at. don’t forget about the levels deep u have to ge tas well.

lets go over the FTC warining once more:“It’s best not to get involved in plans where the
money you make is based primarily on the number of distributors you
recruit and your sales to them, rather than on your sales to people
outside the plan who intend to use the products.”

that is the definition of a really good pyramid scheme, maybe even one with loop holes that make it legal.

I am not saying it is impossible, just saying it isn’t as easy as they say and it can been thought of as a pyramid scheme. Just saying proceed with extreme caution, they will paint you a beautiful picture a Sistine chapel of sorts. i don’t care what numbers they throw at you, percentages, testimonials, what are the numbers truly based on. just something to think about. again use caution.

how’s it going everyone, have read lots of comments, some good and some bad. I can appreciate both. everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I just recently started the 90 day challenge. i believe that this product really does work i have had success with it and so has my wife. My mother in law also is doing well with it she finally has her 3 people and her product is now free. i only have 5 customers so far and to be quite honest i could use some help from existing vi people or anyone else out there. i really would like to be successful at this i know it can be done because one of my close friends is already a Regional Director. I’ve only had 3 challenge parties since i’ve started recently but i still only have the 5 customers. I’ve tried to have more parties but people sometimes don’t come. I could use the help i know you will not be disappointed in the product just try it for 90 days see what happens, shoot try it for 30 days and if you aren’t satisfied send it back for a refund. my website for now is victorarocho.bodybyvi.com if you have questions go to my website and ask me. please leave contact info for me to email you back. Otherwise check out the site and order a kit or sign up to be a distributor, i promise will do what i can to help you in either case. I have my friend others in my upline that can also answer your questions. again the website is :

easy  way to get fit??? people that believe this  are  lazy and fool…. know that those shakes contain sucralose (sugar which is the cause of many illnesses) and oraganochlorine which is lethal when consumed in large amounts)/
instead make your own shake: parsley, celery pineapple, ginger…. and stop eating like a pig, avoid white flour and fried food. or animals that are full of toxins like pork,shrimp,oysters…. in Leviticus 11, God tells us how to eat healthy : )

I have been on Visalus for 2 and 1/2 months now.  It is fantastic! They do not require you to buy any more than what you started with. Lets get our facts straight.  I have eaten like a pig my whole life and deserve to be fat I’m sure, but this product really helps curb cravings and is the only thing I have ever found that does make weight loss easier. I have fought depression and have had the hell teased out of me and finally know I am going to have this problem licked with visalus. I have lost a total of 21 pounds so far. My husband has lost 26. It is not a total miracle, but it is sure amazing how it helps.  The amount of sucralos is minute.I know there are many people who have all the answers on how to lose weight.  They make really mean comments and put others down because they have either arrogant or low self-esteem.  I have never found another product that works like this.  I am sure you all must know God better and be going staight to heaven because you know how to eat and looking right is so important.  I am sure all us fat people will go to hell because the bible tells us how to eat.  I have a relationship with Jesus that says to love your neighbor as yourself.  God is love.  Check out the gifts of the Holy Spirit.  Hmmmm.  They don’t fit in with calling people fat, lazy pigs.  Don’t knock Body by Vi until you try it.  If you don’t like it, you are not out a dime and they will give you your money back. I love this product! http://www.ckratzke.bodybyvi.com

My good, close friend and her mom have already recieved the BMW bonus. She has not had to work that hard to get it.  She has only been doing this 3 months.  She has lost 36 pounds, runs a full-time daycare, is a photographer.  When do you think she has time to pound the pavement.  Try it before you pass judgement.  You have nothing to lose.  I have lost 16 pounds in 2 and 1/2 months, my hubs has lost 26.  Those are the facts and they are real.  I have never tried anything that knocks out my cravings and makes me feel as good as this product does.  I am on Vi for life! http://www.ckratzke.bodybyvi.com

Call your credit card company and stop payment.  Most credit card companies will back you as long as you can document that the product was returned.  But don’t wait, take action today.
 the shake man! 
there is no scam, you know up front if you dont put in the work you dont get paid, i have thousands of customers and distributors on my team that have lost weight, several are pushing 100 lbs. Redirection of funds are killing the other MLM’s out there, and with our 3 for free program you get kits free minus the shipping. We have people making money from 100’s a week to 1000’s a week. Its all in what effort you put in. People are looking for a fast healithier alternative to working out 5 days a week and some people cant physically work out that are handicapped or disabled. I say Visalus is changing the world for the better and its getting gooder and gooder!!!

So 82000 people joined the challenge in Sept alone! Over 20 people a day are qualifying for the BMW bonus. Visalus will soon (Q1 2012) be the first direct selling company ever to do $1 Billion in sales from North America alone (yes, that includes the big boys, Amway, Avon, and the like). The rest had to go global to do that.

You’re right, this is just a scam. It can’t possibly last.
Don’t you just love ignorant people with big mouths?

One of our founders thought exactly like you did, until he realized his multi degrees guaranteed him nothing! They don’t teach the real skills needed in school. Wake up! Those Industrial revolution ideas don’t apply anymore in today’s market. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you’ll join the rest of us in the brave new world!

Ignorance.
The only difference between Visalus and say, NutriSystem, is that Visalus uses word of mouth advertising, and pays their people to advertise, rather than spending Million$ on TV, print ads.

You obviously have no idea about any marketing whatsoever, network or otherwise.
Ever heard of AFLAC, Avon, Mary Kay, Pampered Chef? Would you consider these scams? They are all multi-level marketing companies.
Just like any industry, there are good ones and bad ones.
Get your facts first before you open your mouth!

First off, the fact that you think Hulk Hogan is paid to endorse Visalus shows you know nothing!

The real brain washing begins at birth for all of us. We are told what to do, where to go, how to“fit it”in society.
Go to school, get good grades, go to college, get good grades, graduate, find a big company, work hard and they will take care of you. HA! How’s that working our for ya? How many of your goals have you accomplished with that plan? Better yet, do you even make your own goals anymore, or are they given to you by your boss!
See, the beauty of being self-employed is that we can work as hard or as little as we want. Can you say the same?
I learned long ago after going to several job interviews which side of the table I wanted to be on.
You keep your“safe, secure (HA), JOB”, I’m going to go help the economy by creating jobs!
That’s the difference. It’s the 80-20 rule. I’m in the 20% that go out there and get things done. You’re in the 80% that sits in their cubicle and complains that nothing gets done.

No one said you have to sell it. There are plenty of folks that are happy just enjoying the product benefits.
They don’t even have to be a promoter to get their product for free, just referrals can do that.

It’s a business. Of course you have to do some actual work. You are obviously not cut out to run a business or work for yourself. So, by all means, stay at the bottom of that corporate pyramid, i mean ladder.

The fact is, every single person who has come to this site is looking for something. Their life is missing something. Why else do they even start looking?
So if your life is missing something, why look into Visalus?
Hmm

If you are so against MLM’s, why are you even wasting your time on it?
Why not go do something more productive with your time? Oh, that’s right, that’s why you’re here in the first place, poor decisions.
If you are one of the few that found this while you were doing actual research, good for you. There may be hope for you yet.
Otherwise, stop wasting your time! Either get the facts, or shut up!

i dont know if you have your facts straight about religion but, eating alot does not mean you will be going to hell. the reason why those beatitudes were created was that so a human being may be able to control themselves. no offense but like you said, you did not hold back when you ate, that’s called gluttony, eating more than you can take. It’s not only a waste of food, but for other people who actually have nothing to eat. the bible never said anything about how we should eat, so don’t mock the bible or God. you say you love this product but really all you’re saying is that it’s the easiest way to loose fat without doing little effort. what happens you’ve lost that wait and you wish to get off the product, wouldn’t your body get attached to it? in the end, it may even end up turning into a drug.

I was actually doing a search for the new color that BMW has created specifically for Visalus. A new person is qualifying for their BMW bonus every hour! It is putting such a stress on BMW’s production of their black inventory, they contacted Visalus, and we now have our own color exclusively for us. During my search, my curiosity got the best of me when I saw“scam”. It amazes me how many people will say“that’s one of those pyramid things”without even knowing what that really means. They just heard someone else say it and thinks it’s what they’re suppose to say. The“Corporate”mentality has been ingrained in us all since birth. The current school system worked great in the industrial age, spitting out drones destined for the assembly lines. And since big businesses control the education elections, and the gov needs tax paying drones, the system that’s been broken for decades won’t get fixed. Did you know that 80% of kids who’ve graduated in the last 10 yrs don’t even work in the field of their degree? And with the emphasis that society has pushed to go to college, there are less and less young people willing to do blue collar work. See, people are stuck in their own little comfortable worlds and don’t want to know what’s really going on out there. As long as it’s not affecting them, they are oblivious. That’s the problem. Those are the people who can’t see past their own corporate brainwashing to realize why our country, as great as it is, is starting to lose our lead on the rest of the world. Sorry about my inner Dennis Miller rant coming out there. It’s just frustrating to read crap from uninformed, ignorant, negative people who won’t look at the big picture. They’re happy in their comfortable little box, and want to discourage anyone looking to actually step out and try to grow as a person. Visalus already has a handful of copycats. They copy our products (poorly), they copy our compensation plan, they have even copied our car program (right down to the exact volume needed to qualify for their, guess what, BMW). But they will never catch us because they don’t get it. What makes us so appealing isn’t the products, it isn’t the money. It’s all about our culture. We help each other, we are totally transparent, not hiding anything. We are about changing the world. We are making a real impact in the health industry, we’ve declared war on the fast food companies. We just gave our 1 Millionth meal to our Feed the Children program. So it doesn’t matter who tries to copy us, or bad mouth us, we just keep going. Nothing will stop us. We’re not a cult. We’re just like-minded people who choose to focus on the positives in life rather than the negatives. That in itself is a healthier way to live. Less stress, less worry. Those things have just as much physical consequences as all the fast food does. Anyway, still ranting. This company isn’t for everyone. If it’s not for you, great! Go do something that is.

BECAUSE, we are educating ourselves about a product/buisness that our friend or family member has“discovered”as some miracle magical cure to all of lifes problems.  And won’t stop pushing there ideas on us as if we can’t live without this crap.  I mean, isn’t that what they teach all you mlm people? It’s fricken annoying!  THATS why we are on here.  Because all the sudden our best friend has turned in to some brainwashed salesmen…There’s plenty of healthy meal replacement options out there, that if tried for 90 days will issue the same results.  Leave us alone!

Visalus prefers to be called MLM instead of pyramid scheme…that’s like saying callgirl instead of whore.

Hey, if you like cold calling people like an annoying telemarketer and promoting a product 24/7, then Kudos to you!  MLM is a business model that is designed to fail for 99% of the people who join one.

I assume your business is real estate. Can’t imagine why you’re on here looking for alternate income.
Visalus is over 6 yrs old, easily going to be around for a long time. The biggest reason is because it is now owned and financially backed by a $2 Billion, publicly traded company (BTH) called Blyth. Do the research before you bad mouth.

Yeah proper diet and exercise is the key. Congrats for being one of the few who has the discipline to do that. But the fact remains that the majority of society today needs help.
That’s why 60% of American adults are overweight, 30% obese, and 17% of kids are overweight!Fast food companies are the enemy, not companies like Visalus. We’re trying to make a difference. Trying to help people change their eating habits. Our products work! And as long as the majority of society continues to have bad eating habits, there will be a HUGE market for our products.
Those are the facts.

pyramid schemenouna fraudulent scheme in which people are recruited to make payments to the person who recruited them while expecting to receive payments from the persons they recruit; when the number of new recruits fails to sustain the hierarchical payment structure the scheme collapses with most of the participants losing the money they put in. see also: Ponze schemeAn illegal pyramid scheme has no exchange or product or service. It is simply money changing hands. Bernie Madoff would promise people a return on investment, when all he was really doing was keeping most of the money and throwing a few bones to those who asked about their“investment”.By contrast, multi-level marketing is very much legal, and has it’s own industry association:The Direct Selling Association, an American industry body, reported that in 1990 twenty-five percent of members used MLM, growing to 77.3 percent in 1999.[17] Companies such as Avon, Electrolux, Tupperware,[18] and Kirby all originally used single level marketing to sell their goods and later introduced multi-level compensation plans.[19] By 2009, 94.2% of members were using MLM, accounting for 99.6% of sellers, and 97.1% of sales.[20]The DSA has approximately 200 members [21] while it is estimated there are over 1000 firms using multi-level marketing in the US alone.[22]

As a so-called“nutritionist”, you are asking all the right questions, but you have no interest in trying to get actual answers.
Visalus is a completely transparent company, one of the very few in this industry, and all you have to do is contact them. They are more than happy to tell you exactly what’s in the products, where they get them, and anything else you would like to know.

We don’t want to be employees! Wake up! It’s your company that is using you!
Don’t believe me? Look at it this way. Who gets their cut of your income before you even see it? The IRS. Employees pay the most taxes!
As self-employed business owners, we get to take all of our business expenses, like mileage ($.54 per mile, btw), product, supplies, and more, and reduce that off of our income. Then the IRS gets their cut from that lower amount.
This is HUGE!
I don’t care if you do our business or not, but you are an idiot if you don’t have some kind of business, home-based or not, that lets you take advantage of our tax system.

Ignorange. You don’t have to buy a“new”BMW, it can be 10 yrs old. And from a tax standpoint, its better that we buy our own. We get to write off the mileage, interest on the loan, and a portion of the payments (if you have payments).
These are all advantages of owning a business. Ask any CPA, these are all legitimate deductions.

This is different how? It doesn’t matter what business you’re in, if you buy a car, don’t pay for it, they will take it back.
If your company was going to give you $600 a month toward a car, wouldn’t you get it?
And what if your company laid you off the month after you bought it? Because if we’ve learned anything from this recent economy, it’s that NO job is truly safe.
I do this business and a plan B first. I put in spare time to grow it. Yes, I have qualified for the BMW bonus, and I proudly drive it knowing I could make the payments if Visalus stopped paying me tomorrow. Nothing in life is guaranteed. Proper planning is a must no matter what you do.
But in the meantime, I take the $600, pay for the car, the insurance, the maintenance, and still have a little extra left. I bought used, planned well. Anyone can do this too!

That’s just what it is, a story of fiction.

You left out the part where those 2 guys, when the company was going under, bought that company and used their own money to make sure their people still got paid.
You also left out how a third guy, who wasn’t from network marketing, had started and sold multiple multi-million dollar companies, and has immense respect in the business world, joined the other 2 guys in building this company.
Further more, you left out how a $2 Billion, publicly traded company has so much faith in this company that it bought it.

I love how you can take just a few vague (known) items, and twist them to sound how you want it to.
Looking at the whole picture, your story doesn’t stand on its own.

We aren’t employees, we don’t want to be employees. You go ahead and keep slaving for someone else, making them rich.
We’re just fine.
Entrepreneurs have the ability to create something from nothing. We work for ourselves, we set our own hours, we are the makers of our own futures.

Do you have a plan B if you were laid off tomorrow? Because finding another J.O.B. won’t be as easy as you think.

It’s not a“company”car, its MY car. I don’t rely on my company to pay for it. They just happen to give me an extra bonus for having one. Its my choice. I wasn’t forced to get it. But most people I talk to, if given the choice, wouldn’t mind driving one.
And I’m sure if you don’t do your job, you couldn’t afford yours either. The difference is, you don’t get to write off car expenses, mileage, or anything else. I do. What does that mean?
Here’s an example:
Employee–Earns        $60K
Taxes paid (taken immediately) average  33%    - $20K
Take home amount          $40K

Self-employed:    Earns the same $60K, but that’s their take home amount!
Takes legitimate business expense deductions–$15K
New taxable amount               $45K
Using the same tax bracket (33%) only pays    $15K  in taxes.

So a business owner takes home $20K more, pays $5K less in taxes!
That’s a $15K difference! Can you say NO BRAINER!

Very well said. I can tell that you probably went to the national event in Atlanta also :D they can copy us, but they can’t catch us! But you’re right, most people who bash the company or it’s concepts, have either had a bad experience in a similar company/concept in the past, or are just jumping on the bandwagon of“if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is, and I should just stick to my minimum wage job for the rest of my life”mentality. If people knew the FACTS they’d have nothing bad to say. Because honestly, there IS nothing bad to say about it. The product works, the money is real, peoples lives are really changing, and the company is set up to be effective in a down economy. I just hope people do their research and see what this company is all about, so that they can hopefully help others as well as themselves. That’s the point of this business!

When the business was not doing very well they came up with the BMW pull.  This was story of how it all began.  It does not matter how many people get involved it still is a scam period. Beleive people their people which they do not even recognixe getting paid is a minor detail to them.

An employee reaps benefits for their efforts. The Business owners take the responsibilty. You are the one who needs to wake up. You are the ones who does the work, takes the risk, pays the expenes and Visalus reaps the benefits. STOP! THINK!  It is better to not have to spent the money to start with then to spend it and then try to get a little back from the IRS. If you drive on your job for any company and they don’t reimburse  you (most do because people would not put up with having to pay it theirselves) you can count it off their income taxes but who wants to foot the bill for a company and then see if you can get it back on a bteak on your income tazes. Get Real. If you don’t spend money then you are a head get it. You are not taking advantage of the tax law Visalus is taking advantage of you. Anyone who falls for this ploy is indeed an idiot.

He drives a new car, it is paid for, taxes&amp;liceneses, repairs, services, car wash, new tires,etc. paid for.  When he leaves the company he can buy him a new car with out all those miles on it with the money he saved from having  the upkeep of an old car. And he can use it for just pleasure. Also a company leases so many cars that at the end of the lease they usually allow the employee to purchase it for a very reduced rate. He has been the only one who drove it and he kept it up so a lot of the times if they need an extra car they will buy it.

These zombies just back from their lastest brainwashing section. Spouting the anti corporate mind jargon is really sad.  The really sad case will settle in when all the people they have cohersed into this product (friends and family) dries up.  They will have everyone mad at them and no one left to scam.  The stories get getting lamer and lamer. The Lies bigger and bigger. Poor fools wont listen to people who have been there. They are like a cult lying to each other scheming their next trick.  Saying that there are copies of Visalus! Where have you been these pyramid schemes have beed around since the beginning of time.  This is just the hot one right now and it to will play out. Oh by the way I am not searching for anything I just like to bring reality to the delussional.  Don’t fall over something with you being in a trance and all…….

a ponzie scheme is a pyramid that involves money but not products (Our buddy Bernie) is not legal. Pyramids are mlm that have a products to make them legal and are usually cheap made over priced products( our buddy Visalus) because they are only incidential anyway. Companies like the ones you mention have dozens of products that are resonable priced. They depend alot, but may grow, on representatives selling to friends and families. All the products above but Avon have branched out into stores. Avon has gone more to catalogue and internet sales. The main thing that differs these from scams like Visalus is they do not rely on recruitment for their business. Also you forgot to mention the thousands up on thousands that have come and gone some with big waves some with only a trickle. I do think that after the financial troubles we have been experencing that they will be tighten up on pyramid scams like Visalus.  In bad times the what is called (last dollar) companies come out of the woodwork.  They are called that because they know people are desperate and will try anything to make a living so they squeeze the last dollar they have out of them.      Nice People.

Please get your facts straight before posting.  Here you go, right from Wikipedia:

Again, have fun calling everyone trying to sell them this stuff.“hey listen to this 4 minute message about how great Visalus is…. how could you not sign up or this pyram…um..I mean .MLM Opportunity?”

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme#Connection_to_multi-level_marketing 
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Chernobyl had a control system that failed. MLMs have no control
mechanisms at all. Where is the“switch”that can be flipped in an MLM
when enough sales people are hired? In a normal company a manager says,
“We have enough, let’s stop hiring people at this point.”But in an MLM,
there is no way to do this. An MLM is a human“churning”machine with
no“off button.”Out of control by design, its gears will grind up the
money, time, credibility, and entrepreneurial energy of well-meaning
people who joined merely to supplement their income. Better to just
steer clear of this monster to begin with. There is simply no way to
avoid the built-in failure mechanism of MLMs. If a company chooses to
market this way, it will eventually“hire”(with no base pay and
charging to join) far too many people.
Thus, the only“control
system”will be the inevitable losses and subsequent bad image the MLM
company will gain after it does what it was designed to do: fail. And
sooner or later we have got to stop blaming this particular MLM company
or that, and admit that the MLM technique itself is fundamentally
flawed.
For most MLMs, the product is really a mere diversion from
the real profit-making dynamic. To anyone familiar with MLMs, the
previous discussion (which focused so much on the fact that MLMs are
“doomed by design”to reach market saturation and thus put the people
who are legitimately trying to sell the product into a difficult
situation) may seem to miss the point. The product or service may well
be good, and it might oversaturate at some point, but let’s get serious.
The product is not the incentive to join an MLM. Otherwise people might
have shown an interest in selling this particular product or service
before in the real world. The product is the excuse to attempt to
legitimate the real money-making engine. It’s“the cover.”
Intuitively, we all know what is really going on with MLMs. Just don’t use the word“pyramid”!
“You
see, if you can convince ten people that everyone needs this product or
service, even though they aren’t buying similar products available in
the market, and they can convince ten people, and so on, that’s how you
make the real money. And as long as you sell to a few people along the
way, it is all legal.”Maybe…
But the way to make money in all
this is clearly not by only selling product, otherwise you might have
shown an interest in it before, through conventional market
opportunities. No, the“hook”is selling others on selling others on
“the dream.”
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Some schemes may purport to sell a product, but they often simply use the product to hide their pyramid structure.

As with Visalus, no real wealth can be achieved unless you recruit a huge downline–thus this gives you the pyramid scheme structure…Honestly, I find it very amusing whenever I hear n MLMer trying to argue against this fact…

99% of people who join an MLM will make no money and/or lose money. Again, not an opinion, just a fact.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
LMAO!  Wow, I’d love to see what colour the sky is in your world!

You MLMers crack me up!  Give your little math formula to the 99% of the distributors who didn’t make any money in MLM!  They’d be more than happy to keep their job -plus all company benefits, pension plan health and life insurance, holidays, sick days…and they get to keep work at work at the end of the day…not like a Visalus Rep working 24 hrs a day…yeah, it’s a no brainer all right!

You know nothing about taxes. The tax laws were written a hundred years ago for business owners when most people were business owners. Farmers, professionals, shop keepers, etc. The industrial revolution caused many people to go to work for companies, but the tax laws remain in favor of business owners. How many people do you know that make over $250K per/yr? If you know any, how many of those are employees? I rest my case. You don’t get rich being an employee. And no, I don’t own Visalus. But, as an independent contractor I have many more freedoms than you do working for someone else. The fact that I receive all of what I worked for, not just what’s left after the gov takes their cut, makes it all worth it. I control what I pay them because I get it before they do. I’m not saying I evade paying taxes. I just take advantage of the way the tax laws are written, which all good CFO’s do, to maximize my deductions, and legally pay less in taxes than you do. You go ahead and keep working for the feds from Jan thru April. I want to keep the money I worked for.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
By a poster named Jerry–everyone pondering joining this MLM should read this:

I have read most of the posts on this page&amp;nearly everything of what I have read from the“haters”is true.

Never mind whether or not the product“works”or not.

Never mind that some initial residual income can be made.

Take a look at what will be lost if you decide to become a distributor:

1) Friends

The
Visalus gods will“train”you to transform your personal facebook page
into a selling tool.  You will have to constantly blast out your link,
praying to god that someone clicks on it and joins so you can make your
monthly goal.  Imagine if one of your friends asked you to buy their
product, all day every day, you continue to tell them“no”, but they ask
anyway?  Your true friends on facebook will diminish as people start to
block and delete you.  You will not even notice, however, since you
will be bombarded with friend requests from others in the business, so
that they can all copy and paste each other’s facebook posts to use on
their victims, err, I mean facebook friends.  And NEVER make the mistake
of telling these people how you feel.  You will get ripped a new one
similar to some of the comments made on this page by people you have
been close with all your life.

2) Your Real Job

I have
personally seen four of my close friends and family either lose or quit
their jobs to take on this venture.  Visalus will convince you that you
will make so much money by joining, that you will no longer need that
“deadend job”with all those horrible things, like job security and
benefits and such.  I have seen friends quit their jobs and go on state
assistance for medical benefits to persue this“dream”as they call it.
They will brag about their weekly paychecks, but will never actually
show you proof, since they don’t want you to know how little they make.

I have seen a friend lose their job, since their boss finally got tired of all the Visalus talk at work.

3) Your Integrity

Before
you decide to take that“leap of faith”into this venture, look at the
business model.  It will saturate.  Once it fully saturates, it will
collapse.  Once it collapses, all the people you convinced to join will
never trust you again.  Is this something you want?  Is it worth the
money?

4) Common Sense

It is common to be skeptical before
joining something like this, and it’s for a good reason.  Once people
join, they get so suckered in that they somehow believe everything that
they’re told.  I remember all these people bragging about how the CEO of
this company was appearing on Dr. Phil.  Did it happen?  no.  Some
people have even gone so far as to claim this product will help cure
cancer and depression.  All I can saw is“wow”.  It is advertised as a
cure-all so that it will appeal to as many people as possible.  The
founders of this company have psychology degrees for a reason.  They are
trained motivational speakers that will convince the biggest of
skeptics and turn them into sheep in one sitting.

5) Money

Why
do you think it costs money to join?  Part will go to Visalus, part
will go to the team of people that brought you on.  Now that they got
your money, you’re on your own.  If you have an ambitious upline, they
will help you recruit people if they have their eye on the prize of
getting that wonderful“free”BMW (don’t even get me started on that
one.  Trust me, it’s not free, it’s a reimbursement program as long as
you continue to make that monthly goal.  Do you really think you will
make your monthly goal for the life of those car payments?  I promise
you, you will not, and end up paying for it with all the“profits”you
will make from selling the products.  At best, you will break even in
the end).  You will tackle your close friends and family first, and then
you will realize that you have no one left to sell to.  Then comes the
interesting part.  You will have to travel all over the country starting
up these“challenge parties”to recruit people.  Who pays for this?
You.  Who has the time for this?  People desperate to make this work.
Who gets the shaft from this?  Your family, your friends…all the
people who have been there for you all along.  Suddenly they will not
matter.  All that is important is that Ambassador level, so you can get
that black jacket and brag to all your old friends and say“I told U
so”, as this company trains people to think and say.  They will even
have you use this as your licence plate.  It gets better, it is
mandatory for you to pose in front of that black BMW using the“shocker”
hand sign, so they can pimp you out for marketing purposes.  You have
no choice in the matter.  You just sold yourself to the company and they
can use your image however they like for as long as they like, even
after you left them.

6) Your Health

This is something I’ve
been witnessing that no one seems to talk about.  People who have been
drinking these shakes for awhile now seem to be getting sick alot.  And I
mean alot.  If you want to feel sick all the time, this is the product
for you.  But, you’ll be losing weight, so I guess it’s ok.  You will
experience constant diarrhea once you start taking this stuff, but you
are trained that this is normal and that your body is somehow going
through a detox process.  Really?  The human body is not meant to
survive on a liquid diet.  What happens once you get off the stuff?
I’ll let you figure out that one on your own…not pretty.

7) Do you need any more reasons?

I
feel so sad that some of my friends and family decided to go this
route.  We no longer speak to each other, since I am labelled a“hater”
with no ambition.  They claim they are an elite part of society and
are entrepreneurs.  I think this point has been discussed in earlier
posts, but these Visalus people refuse to see reality.  You have NO
control over this company, you are NO entrepreneur.

I’m sure I
will be ripped apart here for making these comments, but it’s nothing I
haven’t heard before.  At least be original and stop making the usual
remarks on how Ryan Blair is a rags to riches story (thanks to his
step-father funding the whole thing), and how it’s“working”for so many
people.  Water and carrots work for losing weight, but not the best way
to approach the problem.  Do you really want to drink these shakes for
the rest of tour life?

And of course, I wish“Vitality”to you all. ;)

14 days.  Wow that’s outstanding.  Not. I’ve noticed all the“supporters”of Visalus have only been on for a short amount of time.  Tell me the same thing in a year or two and I might believe it.

Your comments sound like ads.  Too reminiscent of others that I have read.
 guest 
Again, you sound like…guess what?  A salesman!
 guest 
The company wouldn’t NEED to encourage you to lie…the business model is set up in such a way that you would see the benefit in lying all by yourself.  I’m sure that’s what she meant.
 guest 
After reading all the comments from both ends of the spectrum, it seems to me that if the truth is that this is such a great amazing product, then why would the company need or want to be an MLM?  Why bother with distributors and BMW’s and all that jazz?  The only reason I can think is because of what this article is saying, that it isn’t about the PRODUCT, but about the money, made so easily in this pyramid scheme.  The nature of the business scheme and marketing proclaim the truth quite loudly, in my opinion.
 guest 
All you people who are currently selling Visalus sound the same.  Don’t you realize that?  Awfully incriminating…It doesn’t sound real.  I mean, maybe you’re right, but you need to be more convincing and quit sounding like a sales ad. :-P
 ThinkDontFollow 
CRAP CRAP CRAP!!  It might work for some people, but there is a lot of bull-shitting and ripping people off involved.   Nope….not good for my Conscience.
 guest 
6 months.  Wow, that’s really long-term.  It’s interesting to me that everyone on here who is promoting Visalus and claiming that it’s such a great product and business plan, have not been doing it for even a year.  I want to know what you all will be saying in two years.  5 years.  10 years?  I’m somewhat skeptical that you will still be singing it’s praises.  I think the answer is in the business model itself.  If it was such a great product, why would they NEED an MLM model?  To give people the opportunity to make money?  Yeah right.  No one is that altruistic.  Most businesses are in the business of making money.
 guest 
By the way, your post sounds just like everyone elses.  Giant red flag, imo.
 guest 
It doesn’t have to be scam, it’s just a business model that is set up for a short-term success.  I do not see this being profitable for the long-term.  I’ve already seen the trend of people dropping out and sales declining.  It’s a fad, once it’s over, all these distributors will need to move on to a new MLM.
 guest 
Common Sense 101 tells me that this all sounds suspicious, research or no.  Every comment on here from a Visalus user or seller sounds strangely similar, and I have yet to see one who has been on this product even a year.  Most 2 weeks to 6 months.  That is not“evidence”of it’s success.  It’s a fad.  It’s a short-term money maker.  I can tell that it won’t last.  If the product was so great, there would be no need for the MLM model.  THAT is the money-maker, not the product.  The fact that you make your money based on who you can get signed on is suspicious enough for me.  I don’t think that necessarily makes it a“scam”, but I doubt anyone is going to get rich off of it.
 letskeepitreal 
I guess everyone would rather every product be in major stores so that only a select few profit from the sales rather than distributing the wealth to those willing to put in the work.  MLM is simply the ability to set up distribution channels, if you don’t understand that you probably have no business listing off preselected facts about an industry in which you have not dedicated at least five years towards to educate yourself.  I’m sure your the type of person that knows how to make the restaurant better, but have never worked in on for more than a few months.  Or the guy that knows exactly what play your favorite football team should have called for the win, but have never invested enough time to coach to ever know what coaching is all about.  Most people who start in the junior college system don’t graduate from a four year university, does that mean we should do away with the college system because many don’t make it?  The main difference (and it is obvious in many of the negative posts that this is a major point of influence), is that in the direct selling or mlm business model, security is dependent on one’s own drive and efforts, where as in traditional job/business model security is backed by the company.  Either way you have to perform to keep your check coming in, or is that not a fact?  Either way someone who has been in the business longer than you or works harder than you is making more money than you.  Or is that not a fact?  I challenge anyone to show me a job or business model or organization or church or school or student council or police force or department store that is not designed like a pyramid when broken down in organizational chart form.  There are just as many if not more traditional companies doing harm to people and taking advantage of them than mlm companies.  Watch 20 minutes of tv and there is an ad for a pill that has more side effects than the systems we started with, there are junk food and high sugar product ads targeting kids, and tobacco and alcohol ad targeting everyone!  The thing is, just as with supporting those companies it all comes down to personal choice.  If you truly cared about people getting taken advantage of, or any cause for that matter, then you would take action that would make a real impact on this world, not just ranting with a bunch of sour sounding, whiny, unreferenced“facts”.  I could care less what people think of this industry because I know that with every single industry in the world today there are good apples and bad apples.  It is each of our job to do the proper research to filter the bad from the good, then take a calculated risk based on that research.  Disgruntled folks who have had a few bad experiences should be required to disclose what their real experience is, I respect your opinions because they are yours, and we all have our own.  However, it makes it real difficult to take anything from these types of comments serioous without that back story.  If you were someone who got screwed over by a money hungry salesman type, well that sucks, but that is not exclusive to this industry or one company.

It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in, what job you have, or what life you lead. Anyone can see the benefits to lying to get what you want. When someone has integrity, honor, discipline, and ethics, lying isn’t an option. I run my business, as do the founders of Visalus, under those standards. That’s why this company will be around for a long time.

The point here is no one is trying to disrespect you or your choses but are trying to share with you their life experiences.  These pyramid scams have come and gone since the beginning of tme.  The only thing new are the people who don’t know better.  You are being used and brainwashed for a few.  They do not consider you at all.  They want you to do the work for them, take the risk, and put your money up for the expenses of a cheap product that stores will not carry.  They know they could not compete in the market place.They want you to lie to your friends and family and push this stuff off on them.  Using the love and respect that they have for you. They are taking advantage of people who have not had the experience to know better.

You really need to go to school and learn about finances.  Those business deductions you have taken off are expenses that you have already paid for, so you are simply putting amount of money that has already come out of your pocket down.  I bet you any business would let you pay their expenses in exchange for the taxes saved.  You are saying let me pay that $200 gas bill so I get to take off .20 from my taxes.  Get real!!!  I am an accountant and  I wish taxes were that easy.  But there is such a thing as income levels and a lot of other things that go into the amount of taxes you pay.  By your faulty calculation you still lose. Because your $5K has already been spent by you or you never would have been able to take it off. You do all the work, take all the risk, and pay all the expenses.  What business wouldn’t want that deal.  There is no benefits and since they don’t claim you as an employee you even have to pay both sides of your social security taxes ( what does that do to your little dream). You are not a business owner you don’t own anything. You are a flunky for a useless shake company.The wonderful BMW is yours alright along with the lease or loan payment.  This a no brainer for a company like Visalus, they take done of the risk.  If you don’t sell you are stuck with it even if you cann’t afford it and it is your credit that is ruinned if you cann’t.  All the repairs, insurance, maintenance, etc. are also yours.  Have fun in your delusional world.
 Elizzyp 
Yeah in your dreams. When you get so bored with your shake then what?

You sound like you sell it to me.  Doctors and nurses are not allowed to recommend over the counter not prescribed) brands.  It is against board practices. The more desperate the distributors( used lightly) get the wilder their claims get)

Good post.  Visalus is nothing more than Nutrition Quackery.  Too good to be true, fake testomonials, logic without proof, and a motive of personal gain. Losing weight the healthy way, with a diet that you can do forever instead of a temporary fix.
 Elizzyp 
Sue you don’t sell it. You spout the same chant.
 Rocky3972 
Congrats to your weight loss.  But once you get tired of drinking visalus shakes.  Be prepared to watch the weight come back plus more unless you do something realistic like eating a sound diet that you can do forever.
 Elizztp 
DUH!!!!!
 Elizzyp 
I have to say one thing about these guys they really know how to brainwash.  How do you know what the founders do? From what I have read about them they are not the choir boys you think. They are good at comvince people to pay for the expenses and because they can count it off their taxes THEY are doing them a favor. How good id that.
 Elizzyp 
6 years ago the owners had a long distance scam that went under leaving everybody but them holding the bag.

They will gladly give you a load of bull.

I do know about taxes. To be able to take it off as a expense you first have to spend it.Let me say this again you have to spend it. It is gone. Then you get to save a little on your taxes because you SPENT IT. How do you come out ahead.  Any business would let you pay their expenses in exchange for claiming them on your taxes. It may cost you $200 to save .20 in taxes. If you can come out ahead on this you are truly a genius.  And by the way since we are talking taxes you better but away about 15% to pay both sides of your social security and medicare taxes. Good luck with your illusions of grandure.

The only reason 99% of people join is because they were made to believe selling this will make them rich, and they can earn prizes.  The very few people who do make money have no family life because they are constantly on the phone trying to recruit, constantly on the road traveling to“parties”trying to recruit, and literally eat, sleep and drink the business.  VERY time consuming and they are not really“helping”anyone else but themselves….even though that is what they preach.

I love my job.  When I am done working I go home to my family. I have benefits. I make good money. I lost a lot of weight years ago and have never gained it back.  I lost weight the way weight is meant to come off, by EATING and being more active.  That is why I have not gained it back.  I get to thank myself for what I accomplished.  Anyone who is willing to fast on a liquid diet, has the willpower to just stop eating so much.  Save your money and get healthy the way we have on this earth since we have been here!

Visalus people all speak like hypnotized zombies.  They are not original in their thinking. They are taught to repeat phrases and use certain key words.  It’s all about getting people under you as sellers.  That is what the“business”is really about.

They post pictures of themselves overweight YEARS before they started taking the product and then a current picture to claim their new bodies were created by a drink.  SAD  I know first hand a couple who are“ambassadors”who are the same weight now as they were 6 months ago and they are still overweight.  They are constantly saying how they are doing another“challenge”and continue to brag about weightloss.  The majority of sellers lie, brag and say whatever they think you need to hear to be convinced you have to join.  This company preys on people with low self esteem, people who are struggling and people who don’t have many friends.

Anybody who loses weight should realize it is due to calorie restriction.  Anybody who loses weight and then starts eating again, will gain it back. Be careful.  Be smart.

When I witness sellers working on convincing others to buy in, it reminds me of a carnival, and a booth w/ a fortune teller.  You sit and listen to them, and get brainwashed as they tell you what you want to hear.  Then you give them money.  I am sad for the people sellers USE.

The scariest part is the outrageous claims sellers make about the shakes healing powers.  Let’s not be that gullable please! Of course if you lose weight you will feel better and losing weight relieves many symptoms.  To tell people it is because of a drink, is a scam, and you are being selfish lying and exagerating to people. GREEDY!

Of course sellers are going to try their hardest to defend what they are doing, that is expected.  They are“trained”about what to say and how to respond.  If people always have an answer for every question asked, that is a red flag!

Ok so this is a scheme yet people who are taking the product are changing there lives and becoming happy, healthy and they are still given the opportunity to make some money if they want to?

I have a manager where i work use this product after his father died of a heart attack, and he has lost 40 pounds and is the best shape of his life and couldnt have done it without this product to replace meals with.

Just because you suck at this concept of marketing, or you dont like the product doenst mean its an evil scheme. This is america, these things are possible so why not let them be.

You may not believe in the MLM business model, which I understand, but you should do your research about the products.  You have information about the pills above that is incorrect.  They are not selling“diet pills”, it’s a very healthy meal replacement shake and they sell high quality chelated vitamins.  Again, do your research before  you write your rant.

Every business has expenses. That’s the price of being in business for yourself. As a business owner, I get to be in charge of my taxes. How do you think the rich get that way? They utilize the system that’s available to them. They know how to play the game. That’s the difference, employees don’t even get in the game because they never even see all of their money. The gov gets it’s cut before you even see it. Think of it this way: (This is from Robert Kiyosaki)
Picture yourself at a job interview. Which side of the table did you picture yourself? That’s my point. Which side of the table should you want to be on? Until you get rid of that employee mentality, you will never be rich, and you will never understand any of what we entrepreneurs are saying. It’s beyond your ability to comprehend.

I get my shake/smoothie mix delivered right o my door every month. Each shake costs me less than $2, $49 for 30 meals. I get over $100 worth of grocery nutrition in 1 shake! If you can go to the grocery and“eat right”for less than $2, i’d like to see how, and what, you’re eating. And in this fast paced world, very few folks have the time to go to the grocery and plan out every single meal anyway. We’re offering a healthy, less expensive, time saving alternative to fast food. How is that taking advantage of people. It’s called free will. We simple share what we have to offer. If people see how it can benefit them, great! If it’s not for them, that’s great too. We don’t (at least I don’t, nor do I teach my team to) waste time trying to push anything on anyone. There are plenty of other folks to share this with. And the bigger we get, the easier it is.

Hi Elizzyp,

Been reading through the posts here, and it seems like you really hate Visalus.  Which is fine–I’m not a Visalus distributor or anything (just doing research).  But fussing at a company because the bulk of distributors don’t make much (or any) money doesn’t seem very valid in my mind.

Any business venture is just that–a venture, involving risk.  If enough capital is brought to the table, that risk can be mitigated.  (e.g., you buy a franchise and invest $500k–$1m, then you have a good chance of succeeding).  But it’s still a chance, a risk.

With these types of MLm businesses, startup capital is low, and the marketing responsibility is put on the distributor.  I think the issue is that with a low ceiling, it attracts a bunch of people with no business experience, no marketing experience, and very little capital.  Most businesses take years to get into the black.  Someone who has zero savings, zero experience, and zero knowledge of growing a business probably isn’t going to succeed, as all those ingredients are essential for success.

Even then, most businesses (any kind of business) fail.  I don’t necessarily think this makes business, in general, a scam.  And I wouldn’t say the bulk of entrepreneurs in business“drink the kool-aid”either.

I understand that theoretically, MLM’s are“doomed by design”.  And yet…

1. Social security continues to pay out
2. Amway continues to sell and grow
3. Herbalife continues to be public, and make the monies

Visalus could fail, and so could other MLM’s.  But for every one example that fails, there are other examples where they somehow defy the laws of MLM failure…and succeed.

It’s not as easy and cut-and dried as the marketers and promoters of MLM make it out to be.  But it’s also not as simple as“it’s designed to fail”and“people on top make the money, people on bottom lose it”.  Plenty of these companies (and distributors) make money, though most will lose money or break even.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
@jpf–High quality vitamins can be purchased at your local grocery store/health food store, etc…and by purchasing them at these stores, you save a ton on shipping, you’re not put on“auto-ship”and have your credit card charged every month, and you can have a clear conscious that you’re not contributing to a pyram,,,,I mean MLM.

I am a 19 year old successful business owner that has worked very hard for what he has. I sold this product for a little while as I was sucked into it like everyone else by trying it and loosing 40 pounds. little did I know all of the weight would come back. I then went on a weight loss kick again, but this time without the shakes. I now am able to maintain a weight I am happy with. Without that shake, the people on it gain all of the weight back. Its a horrible scam. I ask anyone selling this product to strongly reconsider.
 Shakim Gonzalez 
My friend Kevin Merriweather became a 5 star ambassador in 19 months and is now a millionaire…My friend David is Presidential Director, and Sean a Regional Director…Visalus is real and so is network marketing. A JOB is more of a scam than this. Visit http://www.globalfitness.bodybyvi.com This blog is bogus and the author is misguided…

Network marketing is about puting money in the hands of people instead of directing money to large corporations that pay low salaries and outsource to other countries. Network Marketing creates millionaires…Who was the last millionaire your job created without hitting the lottery…
 Love my Vi-shakes 
I can only speak for MYSELF but I am LOVING my VI-LIFE-Shakes! I was very skeptical at first but after doing my research I decided to try it due to nothing but my first $100.00 to lose, what the hell…. I lost 10 lbs my first week along with 4 inches with NO exercise…I am continuing it due to my great results thus far, and better yet…. mine is FREE because I got 3 others interested with GREAT results…. People are going to bash ANY and ALL MLM’s. Look up ANY MLM and you will read bashing/horrible postings about it being so bad. Everyone has a right to their own opinion and you MUST be an ADULT to purchase from Visalus….  I have gone down to ONE shake a day to maintain my weight and get my much needed vitamins…I have NOT gained back my unwanted weight and I do eat shitty every now and then! ANY“diet”people do is a LIFEstyle change, not a quick fix and move on. I have not heard of ONE“diet”where you can lose 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 + pounds and stop and not gain anything back, it is called a LIFEstyle change for a reason!

I believe you are brainwashed and you are misguided.  I would rather be poor and healthy than use people to make a buck and gain fake friends and gain weight after fasting off shakes.  You are right, its just marketing.  Not how I choose to present myself to others.  I am a person of integrity and don’t find the need to force people into believing what I tell them.

And millionaires are not common and anyone who does make money selling anything in this type of business sacrifices their family life, and has no time for their real friends.  It’s a very snobby way of life, and I will be no ones puppet!

I love my  real job.  I go to work, I get paid well with full benefits.  I go home to my family and friends and they get my genuine attention and honest devotion.

A JOB is the biggest scam there is for most people.  You give ALL your time and dedication to something that just shits on you in the end! ITS TERRIBLE!!  Visalus and network marketing gives average people the opportunity to do above average things PERIOD!  If you think otherwise, then you REALLY need to educate yourself.  If they didn’t work, their wouldn’t be 5000 network marketing companies and this wouldn’t be a BILLION dollar industry.  Please don’t be out here spreading false information. Thank You!

many people sign up for these mlms  and make no money or lose

i have never been skeptical because I was never interested in the first place.  It’s a new thing on the market going through a hype phase..  Losing weight for health reasons is to be commended, but drinking your way to lose weight is not healthy.  People are meant to eat their meals and nutrition, just like we have been doing since the beginning of time.  We have already proven to ourselves we know how to not become extint.  It just blows my mind how people get suckeed every day.  Yes if a person wants to lose weight it is a lifestyle change. I am not interested in losing my friends and family over a drink, and I am disgusted by the majority of sellers behavior and false claims.

You have no control over the products, no control over compensation, no control over your downline (although some still try to treat  them as their employees), no control over team calls, no control over events, no ownership or stake in Visalus, and lastly, no control over the over-saturated market that will eventually be.

Have fun calling everyone you know like an annoying telemarketer trying to sell them on this“opportunity”.

You are right in saying that mlms attract people with little resources. That is the point it really makes me mad to see people who are desperate preyed on for the benefit of some con artist. They have these meetings and prey on the weakness of these people. Mlm always fail because of over saturation. These people end up with no friends, family mad at them and in worse financial shape and no one cares. I don’t like to see people taken advantage of especially when their children pay pay some of the price.  You can say it is their own fault that is what the mlms teach you.  But were is the moral principal at.  IT hurts people and IT just isn’t right.

Brittshepperd:  have you looked at the main ingredient in the shakes?  It’s soy.  Have you ever researched soy-based products…also a scam.  Get a brain.  Pyramid or not, the fact is, you are making money off of selling people shit products.  These people are naive and vulnerable because they will do anything to lose weight…you might as well be selling them cocaine.  It’s an obvious scam….in more than one sense of the word.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
You are missing the point entirely (like all the other mlmers)…pyramids, or mlms if you will, make their money and growth from“memberships”, people who“sign up”to become distributors…the structure is the same with all pyarm…I mean MLMs…

By your logic, everything is a pyramid…that makes no sense whatsoever…what about government departments and agencies, crown corporations, international companies, franchises…their org. charts certainly do NOT make a pyramid, but rather branch out several ways and offer numerous services, jobs, contracts, and products that consumers actually need.

I’ve tried it…been there done that…and as embarrassed as I am for having participated and spewed the same cliched garbage that you just did, I’ve learned an good lesson: unless you LIKE calling everyone you know and try to sell them on this stuff and promote this product 24/7 to make $5.00 an hour, than best just to steer clear of this MLM.
 Tolle Christopher 
Soy is horrible. Raises estrogen levels. What guy wants higher estrogen levels? And for the people that are on here saying”I lost 10 pounds in a week without exercise”, that’s a calorie deficit for you. Obviously if you burn more calories than you take in, you lose weight. Try getting off your ass, work out and eat right instead of buying a worthless product to do it for you. I’m a firm believer in finding out for yourself so anyone who is stupid enough to try to be a distributor, go for it and let us all know how it works out for you. Our society is utterly embarrassing…..
 Jac 
Pyramid or no pyramid…Just look at the size of some of the winners on that photo.  How the heck can you sell something like a weight loss product when you obviously don’t use it yourself? So obviously it is just about money, and where is the unbiased scientific data? Can’t find it.

You don’t know me. I don’t lie to or manipulate anyone. I’m not taking advantage of anyone. If they don’t want the products, they don’t get the products. Are you telling me that you think you are so much better or smarter than everyone else, that you can see through anything to reveal it’s inner motives? Give me a break! For people who struggle with weight problems, diabetes, low energy, and many other ailments, we have done nothing but help them. And when they share their stories of success with others, not only do they get their products for free, but they can supplement their incomes as well. If someone tries this business and fails, they have no one to blame but themselves. I help everyone on my team. Some just don’t want to do what it takes to succeed. They are stuck in the same corporate mentality that you are. And no matter how much I try to help them, they just aren’t going to get it. This isn’t for everyone. I don’t make promises I can’t personally keep. I don’t make product claims, or income claims. But I will share factual stories that I know are true.

Think of it this way, do you believe that every single, 100%, of all used car salespeople are crooks? No. But that’s the stigma they have because there certainly are a few that ruin the integrity for the rest. Same goes for any industry. Yes, I’m sure we have a few bad apples in Visalus. You can’t keep them all out. But I can guarantee that if they cross a line, and the corporate office finds out about it, they will quickly be removed. It just won’t be tolerated.

It sounds like you’ve been burned in the past by a bad apple. I will apologize for that. But don’t throw every person, every company, into the same barrel.
Do you feel like this about Mary Kay, AFLAC, Avon, Colonial Life? These companies are very well respected, and they all are MLM’s. So until you have proof specifically about Visalus, we’ll continue to grow at record pace and we’ll be joining the $1 Billion club very soon. How many scams do you know that can say that?

You have a problem you need to get checked out.  You believe anything. I have investigated this junk. They got the shake from an ear and nose specialist who was expermenting on a herbal treatment for ringing in the ear. They have not invested anything in it. The product is cheap and outdated. The packaging is cheap even the printing on the packaging is cheap. Wake up get some common sense……
 Elizzyp 
A Lot of them can say that .  You miss the point entirely.  You don’t have to be a genius to see what this company is.  No one burned me. I have just seen what this company has done to the lies of sompeople.  I do not like to see people hurt.  I will always call out when I see this happening.  To know that there is conning going on is to hear what these people (word used loosely) say at these meetings. Read the facebook of the people selling, read the postings here.  No one can be as gullible as you people come off, you have to know that you are conning.  You spout what they tell you and you don’t check it out to see if they are telling you the truth. Comparing visalus to other companies does not make it better.
 Elizzyp 
I know about this company you are the one in for an education. Visalus is not transparent they hide everything.

I find it hilarious when you mlmers come out with these numbers! It’s funny because Visalus practices the right to non-disclosure when asked how much money is made from distributor membership versus money made from customers…I guess they are smart to do so since it would be the difference between a legal and illegal pyramid scheme. The United States Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) warns“Not all multilevel marketing plans are legitimate. Some
are pyramid schemes. It’s best not to get involved in plans where the
money you make is based primarily on the number of distributors you
recruit and your sales to them, rather than on your sales to people
outside the plan who intend to use the products.”

Visalus prefers to be called MLM instead of pyramid scheme…that’s like saying callgirl instead of whore.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Too bad 99% of the distributors make NO INCOME…

…Also, your friend probably just told you that he’s a millionaire just to sucker you in…looks like it worked.

…also, your friend will need to jump to the next MLM that comes to town when the market is over-saturated, and start working 24/7 promoting that product.

BTW, I make 6 figures a year at my JOB–plus guaranteed pension plan, health/dental and life insurance all paid by my employer, recognition and advancement, job security, work with great people, and at the end of the day, I can leave work at work, unlike a Visalus distributor promoting this stuff 24/7 and spewing cliched crap to everyone they encounter…if only you could see how foolish you look to people. Maybe you’ll see the light one day, like I did!

Actually, when you dig a little
deeper into Vi-Shape, it isn’t all that impressive. In fact, it looks like a
poor purchasing decision. Take a look at the ingredients. It’s essentially a blend of protein, the“fake”fiber that MonaVie adds, and a pretty good multi-vitamin.You can actually make a similar shake at home for less money from products at Costco. And no auto-ship or shipping charges.
 Elizzyp 
You have swallowed the bait.  In Visalus world the extreme is normal. Have you noticed everyone has been in just a month, 2 months, etc.  Where are your old timers, you know the ones who have been in over 6 months.  Have they fell by the wayside because of over saturation.  I hope you don’t ruin your health with this stuff.  I know people who have taken it for about 6 to 8 months who are sick all the time but they keep on taking it because they have to buy it to make the quota and no one else will take it. Hope they see the light soon.

You are either very uneducated or very delusional
 REALITY 
Ryan Blair is the Billionaire and I am sure there are LIMITED #s of KEVINS who Distribute for ViSalus.  MARKET SATURATION IS REAL and proven!  The only delusional people are those who DO NOT UNDERSTAND that those who get in FIRST make the $ and those they recruit generally have to BUY PRODUCTS from the ACTUAL COMPANY IN TROY MICHIGAN THAT RYAN BLAIR CREATED in order to KEEP up their“Millionaire”status.  Ryan and those who started the company AKA THE DISTRIBUTOR and ONLY TRUE OWNERS are the ones making the 100s of Millions.  Ex. you are the first Reg. Director in your state/area, you get 10 people, who get 10 people who get 10 people….and w/in 10 cycles you have 100,000 reps in your are=MARKET SATURATION!  The Bimmer Club you have to HAVE THE CREDIT to buy or lease the Bimmer and the money to pay monthly because if you DO NOT make  your monthly qualification they DO NOT give you the $600 Bimmer Bonus.  Do some more research before you call those of us who did delusional.  I LOVE HAVING A JOB WITH GUARANTEED BENEFITS!  I ALSO CAN PURSUE MY OWN BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SO I HAVE CONTROL AND MAKE THE PROFITS!  JUST SAYIN!

Wow I understand that people don’t like network marketing but that’s because it’s usually for a bogus item. I take the shakes and I went from 167 pounds to 135 in 90 days and kept it off for months now, and I don’t even take the shakes anymore . So to me this is a great product and I don’t even sell it, but I can see how I would make money off of it because everyone asks me what I did to loose the weight and have tried it and love it. Don’t talk crap if you have not tried the shakes, and I have tried tons of diets out there with no where near this much success, including special k diet, 18 day diet, medifast and others and it’s no where near as expensive as Jenny craig and medifast.

To all the visalus promotors! Do all of us a favor and get off this trashy talking bashing visalus website.  We all have much better things to do, helping people with their health, and life.  Making a much better life for our friends and family, so lets get out there and work hard for a better life  !  This is the last time here, remember negative in, negative out! Positve in, positive out! God Bless each and everyone!

All this talk of BMW shortages…I am pretty sure that if it were the case, it would be known publicly that someone was buying absurd amounts of cars that as a manufacturer they couldn’t keep up. I would ask anyone, believer or not, to prove that BMW has run out of black 3-series and can’t keep up. Please post a link to a reputable site as proof…

So you’re going to drink these shakes for the rest of your life? Not recommended.  What do you think happens when you stop taking the shakes? You gain the weight back.  Try the Weight Watchers system if you haven’t already–all about counting your calories and promoting a healthy diet…and they weight stays off…And it’s FREE!
 Elizzyp 
I asked you a question but I think maybe you over looked it.  You have been so kind in answering my inquaries. If a person gets to be an ambassador and get the $25,000 bonus which they pay over two years.  If they fall behind ambassador ranking or quite the business do they still get the pay.  This has just been a nagging question I keep wondering about. Just curosity.

Try educating yourself with something besides their own propoganda.  In Visalus world the truth is wrong and negative, conning and lying is truth. Visalus cures everything (not even penecilian can do that) and if everyone takes it there will be no desase left and everyone will be rich and amabassadors and drive BMWs and the sky will be pink and the streets will be made of gold and………….

BMW shortage or not, they will now pay you for Silver and Green BMW’s too!…My girlfriend has put 11 friends in bimmers in the last 7months, 2 of my girls got the $25k bonus and one just got $250,000. I have first-hand experienced the delicious taste and benefits of this great product and have seen it transform peoples health and lives. That’s a beautiful thing-DONT HATE. The soy is non GMO, it’s a soy isolate and actually has no estrogen in it at all. Knowledge is power; whether you have a regular job or want to be a MLM distributor you can be succesful if you represent your clients best interests by acting professional, ethical and being knowledgeable. I love the shakes and would never pressure anyone into being a distributor…I have a succesful career and enjoy this product to give me the nutrition I need when I’m on the go. It’s an inspiration to see my friends living freely and making a six figure income off Visalus. Not everyone will; like anything you get back what you put in. To the Ex-Visalus Distributor; sorry this didnt work for you it’s not for everyone and my advice to you is to focus on the positve things in life which will bring you goodness however you want it…and best of luck in the future.

I completely agree with two of your statements:

“Knowledge is power; whether you have a regular job or want to be a MLM
distributor you can be succesful if you represent your clients best
interests by acting professional, ethical and being knowledgeable.”I couldn’t agree more.

And I also agree with your statement:“focus on the positve things in life which will bring you goodness however you want it…and best of luck in the future.”Thank you for those kind words. I’m a big believer in the“Power of Attraction”–focus on positive, and positives will enter your life…focus on negative, and negative will enter your life.

Thank you for a well written, thought-out post, even though I may not agree with everything you say, I think you are a diplomatic, positive person, and I admire that.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Unfortunately, I have no idea how they pay that out. I would think that they get to keep it, since they made the quota for that month, but again, I’m really not sure.

I just read through some past posts, and now I see where you asked me. Sorry I didn’t respond, I didn’t see it…which is strange because I always read your posts! We share a lot of the same views regarding MLM, and I enjoy reading your replied to the mlmers. I hope things are going better with your family.

I guess you tried to be a promoter and quit after the first week and now it’s the company’s fault and not yours.  Just plain pathetic!  I happen to know first hand how phenomenal these products are.  I have lost close to 40 lbs since January and my husband has lost close to 50.  The number of people we have helped to do the same is just incredible. We do have one of the mentioned BMWs, it has been paid for every month because we treat this like a business and are very serious about it.  Acquire the BMW and treat it like a hobby and yes, you will be paying for it.  Not only do we have the BMW but we have helped 30 other people qualify for one as well.  After only 1 year in the industry…not just this business in particular but the entire industry…we became Ambassadors.  Ambassador = $25,000 bonus!!  It took a lot of hard work and dedication to making other people healthy and financially stable but it was worth every minute.  So, don’t blame Visalus for your shortcomings.  You could have done it too.  But being a quitter will get you nowhere fast.  See you from the top!

@Ally081022I never blamed anyone…I just don’t like the MLM model, and I didn’t like doing that kind of work…it was embarrassing–besides, I make a hell
of a lot more money at my real JOB, and have way more time to spend with
my family…but hey, if you like calling people like an annoying
telemarketer, then kudos to you.

The years you’ve wasted promoting this stuff, all that time could have been
spent with your kids, your friends…you’ll never, ever get that time
back…mlms will always be there, but that time will not…I feel sad
for you. Good luck to you!

 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
By a poster named Jerry–everyone pondering joining this MLM should read this:I have read most of the posts on this page&amp;nearly everything of what I have read from the“haters”is true.Never mind whether or not the product“works”or not.Never mind that some initial residual income can be made.Take a look at what will be lost if you decide to become a distributor:1) FriendsThe Visalus gods will“train”you to transform your personal facebook page into a selling tool.  You will have to constantly blast out your link, praying to god that someone clicks on it and joins so you can make your monthly goal.  Imagine if one of your friends asked you to buy their product, all day every day, you continue to tell them“no”, but they ask anyway?  Your true friends on facebook will diminish as people start to block and delete you.  You will not even notice, however, since you will be bombarded with friend requests from others in the business, so that they can all copy and paste each other’s facebook posts to use on their victims, err, I mean facebook friends.  And NEVER make the mistake of telling these people how you feel.  You will get ripped a new one similar to some of the comments made on this page by people you have been close with all your life.2) Your Real JobI have personally seen four of my close friends and family either lose or quit their jobs to take on this venture.  Visalus will convince you that you will make so much money by joining, that you will no longer need that“deadend job”with all those horrible things, like job security and benefits and such.  I have seen friends quit their jobs and go on state assistance for medical benefits to persue this“dream”as they call it.  They will brag about their weekly paychecks, but will never actually show you proof, since they don’t want you to know how little they make.I have seen a friend lose their job, since their boss finally got tired of all the Visalus talk at work.3) Your IntegrityBefore you decide to take that“leap of faith”into this venture, look at the business model.  It will saturate.  Once it fully saturates, it will collapse.  Once it collapses, all the people you convinced to join will never trust you again.  Is this something you want?  Is it worth the money?4) Common SenseIt is common to be skeptical before joining something like this, and it’s for a good reason.  Once people join, they get so suckered in that they somehow believe everything that they’re told.  I remember all these people bragging about how the CEO of this company was appearing on Dr. Phil.  Did it happen?  no.  Some people have even gone so far as to claim this product will help cure cancer and depression.  All I can saw is“wow”.  It is advertised as a cure-all so that it will appeal to as many people as possible.  The founders of this company have psychology degrees for a reason.  They are trained motivational speakers that will convince the biggest of skeptics and turn them into sheep in one sitting.5) MoneyWhy do you think it costs money to join?  Part will go to Visalus, part will go to the team of people that brought you on.  Now that they got your money, you’re on your own.  If you have an ambitious upline, they will help you recruit people if they have their eye on the prize of getting that wonderful“free”BMW (don’t even get me started on that one.  Trust me, it’s not free, it’s a reimbursement program as long as you continue to make that monthly goal.  Do you really think you will make your monthly goal for the life of those car payments?  I promise you, you will not, and end up paying for it with all the“profits”you will make from selling the products.  At best, you will break even in the end).  You will tackle your close friends and family first, and then you will realize that you have no one left to sell to.  Then comes the interesting part.  You will have to travel all over the country starting up these“challenge parties”to recruit people.  Who pays for this?  You.  Who has the time for this?  People desperate to make this work.  Who gets the shaft from this?  Your family, your friends…all the people who have been there for you all along.  Suddenly they will not matter.  All that is important is that Ambassador level, so you can get that black jacket and brag to all your old friends and say“I told U so”, as this company trains people to think and say.  They will even have you use this as your licence plate.  It gets better, it is mandatory for you to pose in front of that black BMW using the“shocker”hand sign, so they can pimp you out for marketing purposes.  You have no choice in the matter.  You just sold yourself to the company and they can use your image however they like for as long as they like, even after you left them.6) Your HealthThis is something I’ve been witnessing that no one seems to talk about.  People who have been drinking these shakes for awhile now seem to be getting sick alot.  And I mean alot.  If you want to feel sick all the time, this is the product for you.  But, you’ll be losing weight, so I guess it’s ok.  You will experience constant diarrhea once you start taking this stuff, but you are trained that this is normal and that your body is somehow going through a detox process.  Really?  The human body is not meant to survive on a liquid diet.  What happens once you get off the stuff?  I’ll let you figure out that one on your own…not pretty.7) Do you need any more reasons?I feel so sad that some of my friends and family decided to go this route.  We no longer speak to each other, since I am labelled a“hater”with no ambition.  They claim they are an elite part of society and are entrepreneurs.  I think this point has been discussed in earlier posts, but these Visalus people refuse to see reality.  You have NO control over this company, you are NO entrepreneur.  I’m sure I will be ripped apart here for making these comments, but it’s nothing I haven’t heard before.  At least be original and stop making the usual remarks on how Ryan Blair is a rags to riches story (thanks to his step-father funding the whole thing), and how it’s“working”for so many people.  Water and carrots work for losing weight, but not the best way to approach the problem.  Do you really want to drink these shakes for the rest of tour life?And of course, I wish“Vitality”to you all. ;)

Don’t feel sad for me.  I’m now a stay at home mother…at home with my kids everyday…free from the rat race that is corp America.  They go to“work”with  me when I go.  I feel sad for you because you are so ignorant.  Some are scams…yes.  This one is not.  I’ve had a health transformation and so has my husband so people come to us about the product. Haven’t hounded anyone. Just because it didn’t work for you doesn’t mean it doesn’t work.  Have fun running the rat race and trading time for money.  I quit doing that several months ago because of this“Scam”you speak of.

I was a Weight Watchers leader for 10 years. Many people found the Points Plus program too complicated.

Plus members could stay within their PP budget and eat garbage with no nutritional value at all.

Also the WW products sold at the meetings are 95% chemicals and not even real food…and the Smart Ones frozen entree’s are not much different.

The Vi-Shakes are very nutritious and even more so with added fruit etc.

I left WW to promote the“90 Day Challenge”!

Your ending sentence is rather rude. Nobody knows everthing, and nobody has all the answers.  Someone who has an answer to everything should not be trusted. To state that only V people are enjoying life is sad. I have always enjoyed my life, and my family, well before the sales of a shake. I’ve always been healthy, and am succesful in my own right.

You sound rude. People who buy into the sales of V have FAILED many times…look at yourself in the mirror. I learn from  my mistakes, and when I succeed at something I am greatful to thank MYSELF…ME

This visalus bunch is the freak show.  You go to these brain washing sessions and come back when stupid ideas and views of the world.  You are like a cult of zoombies spew the crazy spill they taught you.  You sound like a buch of idiots and have drank the kool-aid so heavily you don’t even know it.
 Izzy 
Boy are you in for a rude awakening. The more the kool-aid you drink the more delusional you come.  I wish you could hear how ignorant you sound. Brainwashed.
 Izzy 
You have the nerve to call some one you don’t even know a quitter.  I think he (or she) is very brave to to have wised up and got out of the cult. Standing up to these crazy people is not easy and the poster is trying to help others from the mistake that he made. I admire him (or her) for having the guts to do that.  I did not make this mistake but I have made my share and I don’t know worther I would have the courage to admit to it and try to warn others.
 Elizzyp 
Thank you so much.  Things are going some better because as you and others predicted they have reached the piont that they are barely selling any and lost their titles and such.  They coming back to earth to some decree.  I just keep praying that they have not or do not get their self into a financial problem.
 Elizzyp 
Pathetic and comical.  I am quite talented then.
 Izzy 
Bless your heart.  You don’t seem to no what is failure and what is not.  I see getting out of a scam as success.  I see being brainwashed to sell (at your expense) some useless shake to your family and friend.  Conning and lying to people as failure.
 Izzy 
You need to go back and re educate yourself.  You have your facts wrong and suggest if you really want the truth that you go somewhere besides to Visalus.

I first started doing these shakes because a friend wanted me to try the 90 day weight loss challenge. It was exciting to think about this. I soon realized that this was more for my friends trying to make money, than anything else, but they are friends, and I thought why not try it. These shakes do work, if you have a lot of will power to not eat. It can be done with Visalus, but, as I have learned from a lot of research, there are far superior meal replacement shakes out there, and alot cheaper. Idealshape is what I am going to try after finishing my visalus order. It costs $40 a month, if you order a 4 month supply. They use a very good appetite suppressant, and are reported to be very good tasting. The Visalus package w appetite suppressant costs $250. If you would like to learn more, please go to mealreplacementshakereviews.com  This is a very informative website that compares all the shakes out there. At this point in time, I cannot attest to the long term results w Visalus, but everyone out there compaining about their cult like, obsessive, pushy sales tactics, are RIGHT ON THE MONEY about that part of Visalus. Nuff Said!!!!!!
 Elizzyp 
It is better than having no benefits.
 No Fool 
these shakes are  a joke ask in nutritionist. 12 grams (thats it)  of protein and if you look at the main protein its soy. Google soy protein and you will see alot of research showing how bad soy is.
 Bill 
Where I from they are selling via shakes and I know 3 people that have gotten hurt from this diet. The via distributors put everyone on a shake only diet with hardly any food and they end up collapsing at work. I was later told they were suffering from malnutrition.  Viasalus science better watch it Im smelling a class action lawsuit, I don’t think viasalus science does not train there distributors very well they should not be handing out diet plans unless they are nutritionist.
 Mike 
How fat were you to need to lose 30 or 50 lbs?  You were dumb enough to eat all that food that made you obese in the first place, and now youre trying to convince us that youre doing good for people…give me a break
 Elizzyp 
Ah Bill but Visalus has a dirty little secret.  Their representatives don’t work for them or represent them and they will not furnish them a lawyer if they  sued.  In other words Visalus would say we have no control on what they say they don’t work for us.  Visalus takes no responsibilty to or for their distributors ( word used loosely better word flunkies)
 wakeupworld 
My problem with this“business”is how they promote this as pretty much a cure all“drug”and make so many bogus claims of it being basically a miracle cure all and weight loss product.

It’s one thing to want to get in shape, or lose weight, or eat healthier.  There are many ways to do that.  Some safe, some not so safe.  Drinking to lose weight is not healthy.  And then to claim that the“shake”itself is what causes weight loss, and cures health issues is a SCAM.

Please tell me the ingredient that causes weight loss, and cures health issues.  There are no such ingredients in the world.  People lose weight because of calorie restriction.  People who lose weight get healthy side effects such as lowered blood pressure, more energy etc…….

Every diet product out there will work.  Every diet product is promoted the same way as being the best etc. It’s called marketing.  Visalus is a multi-level- MARKETING business.

Sellers don’t want anything but sales.  But USE customers to promote themselves if they lose weight etc.  It’s a sick and twisted game.

There is no way with the $50 you only get to sell three to get yours free.  If you want to make money and that great BMW deal you have to pay $500 to $1000 Read the compensation schedule.  You are a sad buch.  I’ll take my 5-9 with my pay check I can count on aand benefits.  You can have your 24/7 that lasts about 6 months until your area is saturated. and you get to pay the expenses of this little adventure too…Real smart…..

You couldn’t lose weight in ten years gosh…….i never heard of products sold at meetings.  You don’t have to go to meetings you can do it online.  You can eat real food and you get to eat that fruit too. You don’t have to eat frozen meals.  Smart Ones are not a Weight Watchers brand

They have now offered 2 other colors and VIP treatment and financing to Visalus BMW qualifiers.  There are over 27 people a day earning this bonus!
 mms 
AH, but if you do not want the Bimmer you can still get a $300 cash bonus.   So you are given the choice whether or not to tie yourself to the Bimmer payment or not.  That’s where common sense comes in handy.
 mms 
The isoflavones (which is the estrogen containing component of the soy) have been removed from the shake mix.  Soy is heart healthy and is used for those benefits as well as its near perfect amino acid profile.  This is why this product is working for body builders and athletes.  So if you would have done your research, you would know this about the product before knocking it. And from someone who works out 5-6 days a week and is dedicated to eating a clean diet of whole foods, this product has helped me lean out and become stronger as well as to build muscle and just obtain overall stamina and mental clarity.  THIS is why athletes, body builders and figure pros promote the products.
 Elizzyp 
That’s the kicker they offer financing to the qualifier.  Not to Visalus and when they no longer qualify the debt is theirs not Visalus as far as VIP treatment that should be any company selling anything to anyone standar practice. Visalus can offer this with no exposure to themself it is the qualifier’s credit that is ruined if they no longer can pay for it when their area gets over saturated.
 Elizzyp 
When people say I put or they put people into bimmers that sounds so false and pretentious.  Thye don’t put anybody into anything unless they are buying it for them.I am seen this product change people’s lives too. It brought them illness. debt, and lost of friends and family. You are delusional talking about your clients and being professional. No matter how you try to blow up all the health benefits and money made and weight loss, you are really a flunky for a scam pressuring a useless shake on your friends and families.
 Elizzyp 
I visited a body building web site where they were discussing Visalus and they said that it was made from cheap ingrediants, was over priced and useless.  They see it warranted much discussion so that is about all they said when some one asked about it.

Success in this business or any mlm is measured in the enormous losses of the low level distributors. Remember, in order to avoid being classified as an illegal pyramid scam, the mlm  must  try to sell some product (or service).  By law, they must derive
at least 51% of their income from product or service sales, rather than fees and
distributorships in order to avoid being legally classified as a pyramid scam.
That’s why each distributor must buy sales kits, trial kits, and sometimes, a
certain amount of“product”each month themselves. All to prop up the illusion
that the product is the real focus of the company, which it is not.
 Davidvanoke 
A good freind of mine made it to regional director in 30 days.Sounds like you choose to be negative or unhappy seeing other people succeed. It’s about changing peoples lives by helping them reaching their weight loss goals or whatever goal they have.I was a big skeptic of all MLM programs but I love The 90 Day Challenge.The whole corporate world is based on pyramid schemes. Quit trying to demonize businesses that are being successful!

After spending $1000s in GNC products over the years,  honestly I can say they have done nothing for me. Visalus is a fat-burning protein shake that people replace a meal with. The shake is cheaper than a meal, so I can’t really see where your losing money. And  a product that gives you the option to have it for free, don’t see that at the stores?

this guy is incredibly ill-informed and ignorant. please dont listen to a word of this.”very few lucky ones that make it to regional director”? we are doing 25 bmw qualifiers a day. yea…. an incredibly small amount. you spent more time bashing on the company than you did researching it

 Lol 
I would never replace a good old healthy meal with a shake. That is just dumb.

Healthy eating is a choice. If you can’t do that then you have another problem.

Seriously, how many years do you think you can drink a shake for?

It’s all about the“Regional Director”.
 Lol 
Just look at that picture with those women on the BMW’s. It tells you what the product is about.
 Davidvanoke 
Not looking for prospects here. just letting you know who i am and not afraid to share it. The reason your an ex distributor is either you gave up or you were in it for instant gratification and can’t handle rejection. The founder of KFC was turned down by hundreds of investors and only 1 agreed to back his recipe and ideas. Just because people reject this doesn’t mean its bad. You just decided to believe all the excuses rolling around in your head or couldn’t handle the negativity from other people.If you want to continue to live with your blinders on thats your choice.

Google is the engine/vehicle to get you to the source. Anyone can have a website claiming knowledge on anything. What is the actual legitimate scientific source? If soy was as bad as you say, it would be taken off the market. Many out there believe in Soy and many don’t. Its called difference’s in opinion or belief. One person can wholeheartedly believe in the benefits of soy while the next believes it to be bad. Otherwise, we would all be healthy and eat the exact same thing at all times. As far as what’s in the shake, it is against the law to put anything on a label that does not exist or to omit any ingredients.

Awesome article by Secret Entourage: MLMs (including Visalus) in a nutshell:

It is no surprise to anyone that unemployment is high and that
opportunities in corporate America are not what they were 5-7 years ago
during our booming economy. What you may not have known is the number of
multi-level marketing (MLM) companies out there that take advantage of
these times to take your money, time, and effort in exchange for a false
promise.

We did reviews of these scams over the past two years where we covered: Primerica Scam, 5Linx Scam, Mona Vie Scam and Visalus Scam
throughout our site. Surprisingly they all have significant amount of
comments to go with them showing the 1000’s of delusional people saying
it is a legitimate business while another 1000 scammed people say
otherwise. It truly is comical in nature but yet sad for society.

Today, we are going to break down how to identify such scams and making sure you do not fall for the traps.

Most MLM companies want you to believe that their business is a
legitimate business and will use a few components to create buy-in
(credibility) and get your hard earned dollars.

1. The celebrity or millionaire tie in: Many MLM’s
use celebrities, athletes, and millionaire to prove their business is
legit. Simply put, why would a smart millionaire or even billionaire
endorse a business if it wasn’t a great business. Everybody wants to
make money which is why you are contemplating joining to begin with, but
those with deep pockets are the ones who have made large amounts of
money by allowing companies to use their names, just so that you can
give your money and make those on top even more money. Celebrity tie ins
have been used for years in business and are a great way to get you to
pay up but reality is that those celebrities, regardless of what they
say, are not working at the bottom feeding those on top and have already
been paid a lot more than you will working 80 hrs a week. Be wary as
legitimate businesses DO NOT need to use such strategies to sell
themselves to employees which is the perfect example of how MLM
companies think of you as their customers, not employees.

2. The self employed approach: Every MLM out there
claims that it is an opportunity for you to own your own business but
yet in reality, you work for others. The idea is they cut you checks
which means you are not your own boss, they give you 1099’s which means
you depends on their corporation to pay you, and they expect you to work
certain hours, do certain activities, etc.. The idea here is their lack
of liability on you, so they don’t have to regulate what you do or
don’t do or when you lie and cheat people out of money. They simply
legally can allow to slide by while making money.

3. The disclaimer or disclosures: This our favorite
by far as its entire purpose is to be truthful but yet all it is says is
the exact opposite of anything you have been told by the reps of that
company. The disclosure or disclaimers on all these sites usually will
tell you that you are not employed by that company and that no support
will be provided in any legal matter, even if directly linked to the
product. It also states that most of the reps earn close to nothing in
salaries. Its all in the fine print and they do a great job hiding it on
their site or their paperwork.

4. Pay to join: The majority of MLMs will have some
sort of entry fee or mini purchase amount. Primerica and 5Linx expects
you to pay to join and they do a great job at telling you that this
covers expenses they incur while others like Visalus or MonaVie will
require you to purchase a minimum amount of their products as a starting
point. Both of those models profit them, and despite what they say
about needed licensing fees, etc, consider the following: Primerica’s
top revenue maker is its $99 entry fee and 5Linx’s fees in order to sell
for them contradict their fine print which says that you don’t work for
them. The other system which includes buying a minimum amount of
products actually makes you the company’s base client. When was the last
time you paid to join a job, when was the last time the job required
you to buy what they sell as a minimum to work there. It simply makes no
sense and spells out SCAM.

5. The false promise: Follow the money folks… People
in all those companies claim to make millions and have helped other
make millions but yet have nothing to show for it. They claim they make
money yet drive crappy cars, live in apartments, and best of all will
never reveal their W2 or 1099’s simply because they never made any real
money but rather made less money than a guy working in corporate America
in 5 years. We have asked over a dozen agents from Primerica, 5Linx and
Visalus for some 1099’s and have received nothing in the past 2 years
and yet constantly argue that they make money. Simply pathetic. We even
met a guy at Primerica who claimed to make $30,000 a month and yet wore a
$100 suit, lived in a van and smelled homeless but yet he made $30,000 a
month… WOW… Do you really want to belong to that crow of elite idiots?

These 5 indicators should be enough to keep away from these scams but
perhaps you need more proof that these are a joke. We understand that
many want to believe they are meant for greater than they currently are
doing, and we agree with that, but these MLM scams prey on that idea as
well as those unemployed looking for that big break. If you do decide to
join these scams, just remember that we told you so…

This Website is a big waste of time. people always try to rundown companies that are successful. no one reinventing the wheel here !
 Lol 
I have a friend who is bombing his FB page with this visalus stuff. Geez!!

What a joke. He can’t replicate what his parents did through their real business.

Hey, since you are all daring us to try visalus, why don’t you morons try another 90-day diet. I guarantee you they all work. Try P90x. Far cheaper and you can get it ar Wal-Mart. Try it. I“dare”you. Lol!!!!!!!

Wow! Look at all this negativity here! And people wonder why there is so much poverty in this world. Wake up people! Ever heard of Amway? Or how about the DeVos’s or Van Andel’s? Grand Rapids, Michigan wouldn’t be what it is today and that was a network marketing model. But they must have been scammers too, right? For Gods sakes we’re not robbing banks or selling drugs! We’re essentially getting paid to market a company instead of all the TV shows, etc., getting paid millions for offering a 30 second TV ad! Network marketing is a beautiful legitimate business model that many become financially independent on. It gives people the chance to break out of the rat race and become independently wealthy. If you like working the 9-5 that’s fine! Keep doing that! But don’t hate on the ones that don’t!

A scam. Ha! I’ll tell you what a scam is. Send me some money thru PayPal in exchange for a product or service and I’ll never fulfill it. That’s a scam!

The negativity in this world is just mind blowing! Grow up people!

Does the whey protein contain hormones or antibiotics?  Were the cows grass fed or grain fattened?  Just curious.  Also soy doesn’t contain estrogen.  Soy can stimulate estrogen production though.

Thank you!  Exactly!  Also if you lose weight without exercise, you have a lot of sagging skin.  I gained weight when I went on a exercise/healthy diet module.  It was muscle weight and I went down two dress sizes.  Am I upset about“weighing”more?  Nope!  skipping around in skinny jeans!

Depending in the area you live in Blue Cross Blue Shield Group health Insurance will pay for visalus Sciences products. They consider  Visalus sciences and The 90 Day Challenge a wellness product as It reduces obesity related health conditions and diseases. Don’t believe me?. google it for yourself. My website is davidvanoke.myvi.net.
 Davevanoke 
Correction to my previous statement. Blue Cross Blue Shield Group Wellness Plans will pay for Visalus Sciences and The 90 Day Challenge. Sorry for the error!
 Davevanoke 
You have to call Blue Cross Blue Shield to see if they will cover Visalus Sciences products in your area. Not all areas do.
 Elizzyp 
I would not google your site to answer that question.  I would ask Blue Cross and Blue Shield if they pay for Visalus they would pay for any kind of weight loss plan.  Most plans don’t unless it is in a hospital.
 Elizzyp 
All the BS you can stand.
 Elizzyp 
I think you need to grow up.  Face facts you are getting paid to talk your family and friends into buying a product that they would never think of buying in stores you are conning your on friends and families.  That is the only way they could get anyone to buy their product is to fool you people into conning those people closes to you, they other people couldn’t get to,  I rather rob banks that would be more honest.
 Elizzyp 
I wouldn’t visalus on a dare. LOL
 Davevanoke 
I stated to call Blue cross if you would read my posts and my website so people can get product through me. And no they would not pay for just any product. I’m an Independant  Insurance agent and would not mislead people

You are a peddler of a cheap useless shake that would not make it in stores and you pay all the expenses plus pay them for the priviledge, no wonder you didn’t make it in the real world.

You have drank the kool-aid. Nobody is mad at people for being successful that is more brain washing they give you.  We are mad at Visalus for taking advantage of people like you who are looking to better yourself and Visalus feeds off that desire and people feeling bad about theirself and turns it into money for theirself.  MLM hurts people and although they convince you that you are helping people you are not you are hurting them.

I think it’s funny how a persons true colors come out when you rattle their cage a little bit. Making assumptions about someone elses intelligence and job success doesn’t prove a thing. And lack of reading comprehension and correct spelling doesn’t help either.
 Elizzyp 
The truth of the matter is that Visalus wants you because you can get to your friends and family. They want you for your connections and when they are gone so is Visalus and most cases so are your friends.  People you really need to use your common sense.  If you have to pay all the expenses, pay them to sell, have them discount you as a business rep, have to buy a certain amount, have no benefits (health insurance, vacation, holidays, etc. You don’t even get unemployment because they as an employer don’t pay it. you pay all the taxes) they are not in business to help you that is for sure. And you are not helping anyone buy getting them mixed up in this scam.
 Elizzyp 
You are sad.

 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
“I think it’s funny how a persons true colors come out when you rattle their cage a little bit.”–I couldn’t agree more…just look how defensive you mlmers become when someone doesn’t agree with the mlm business model (quite comical actually). You label them as“haters”, lazy, negative and liars, even when presented with with facts about their particular mlm. Just look at the fine print on their Web sites–they state that most of the reps earn close to nothing in salaries. Its all in the fine print and they do a great job hiding it on their site or their paperwork.

BTW, you’re hypocrisy (and grammar)  is making you look unprofessional. My advice to you is take a break from trolling for prospects and go spend time with your family/friends, do something positive, and love life. Good luck to you.
 Dancingbear40 
most of your commentary is filled with negativity.  undermining people’s ability to make a rational decision, telling them to grow up.  Amway is ridiculous as much as Visalus.  The education of individuals selling Visalus products is laughable.  The products contain SOY, you do understand the consequence of adding non fermented soy into the human body, right?  No, you don’t?  Well maybe an individual with a nutritional degree and a dissertation on soy could fill you in on it.  Oh, wait, that’s me!  Yeah, it’s a very dangerous product unless fermented like MISO…Visalus has very low quality products gearing them at individuals with weight concerns or low self esteem.  Most of don’t hate on anyone, we just recognize a scam when we see one.  Some people don’t, and they think they’ll get rich with something like Visalus, or Amway…scamway.lol

Here’s what you do by selling Visalus:

You’re selling a product to people, first of all convincing them they need to loose weight, and that has been proven to delay the onset of puberty in children, or in some cases boys NEVER go through puberty…imagine that…wow

that’s enough, it’s just a horrible product.  But hey, make some money off of your friends and family with it!  Good for you!
 Coltcompton 
My friends are doing this and doing pretty well. I don’t have the heart to tell them that they are making all that money off of people that are getting totally ripped off.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Don’t forget, most mlmers exaggerate their earnings…with all the time they are investing (more like wasting), they are probably making $3 an hour working for this company.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Plus shipping and handling…they’ll also get you on autoship and charge you this amount every month until you beg them to stop. Good for you for not falling for it.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
99% of people who join an mlm either make no money or lose money. That is the major problem with mlms. I’m not being negative…I’m actually all about the Power of Attraction…There’s no hate here. Just stating facts. Thank you for posting!
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Now now…just because you lost a prospect doesn’t mean it’s right to lash out at others. Thought you’d be used to rejection by now lol!
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
FYI–It’s not your Web site, it’s Visalus’Web site…it’s the exact same Web site as every other Visalus distributor…Visalus just made you believe it’s your Web site…and you pay $40 a month for a Web site that does nothing for you…
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
This coming from the guy who said he’s not trolling for prospects. You do know the definition of hypocrisy, right?

I don’t pay a dime for my website. Talk about  wrong information !  Better go do your homework before you try to dominate a topic you know nothing about! LOL!
 Davevanoke 
I’m beginning to think you are a stalker! LOL
 Dancingbear40 
But the products are poorly made.  Why would you want to make money off of people by harming them?  I presume you will be in the defensive mindset after my comment, but I have viewed the ingredients in Visalus and they are very poor quality.  Have you read the long term studies on SOY?  Visalus uses Soy protein isolates.
 Dancingbear40 
There isn’t a“fat burning protein shake”anywhere, just claims.  Burning fat comes from hard work, not pills, shakes or bars etc.  There’s no such thing as a metabolism booster either…maybe a thermogenic, but not a metabolism booster.  And Visalus uses soy…very harmful filled with phytoestrogens.
 Davevanoke 
Did you ever read Proverbs 29:11 ? A fool uttereth all his mind: But a wise man keeps it until afterwards. Can’t wait for this resonse!
 Dancingbear40 
KFC kills people, makes them obese etc.  Just because you follow through with something, doesn’t make it a good idea…Hitler was successful with his dream as well—determination does not equate to healthy success.
 Davevanoke 
WOW LOL!
 Dancingbear40 
Credentials?  I have a background in nutritional sciences, masters in nutrition, have owned/operated a supplement store for the past decade, have constant growth/education and update my nutritional courses etc.  Anyways, ViSalus is at best a average to poor product.  I’m basing this on their ingredient list.  They actually use SOY.  wow, 2011 and they use SOY.  There are proven negative effects with the use of non fermented soy products, the same kind of soy used in Visalus.  Here come a resurgence of thyroid related health concerns.  Poepl, stop taking Visalus, do some actual research, get in touch with a N.D ( a medical doctor with a background in nutrition).
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Great quote from a great book. I can see why you have memorized it lol!
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Now you know how your friends and family feel from your mlm sales tactics LOL!

And again, you shouldn’t lash out at people just because you’re upset (it makes you look a little childish).
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
That’s funny, because when I was a distributor, it costs $40/month to maintain your ViNet. Maybe you should check your credit card transactions, because they might be charging you for it. Just sayin’. Cheers!
 Dancingbear40 
exactly.  The health concerns are huge, in regards to SOY.  Thank you.
 Dancingbear40 
There
is increasing concern that eating large amounts of soy can affect
thyroid function. Particularly worrisome is the presence of
phytoestrogens in soy-based infant formulas (isoflavones are a category
of phytoestrogen). Critics point out that the level of phytoestrogens in
soy-based formula is over 20,000 times that found in breast milk. In a
1999 press release, the Canadian Health Coalition stated
that consumption of soy formulas could lead to a host of health
problems, including thyroid dysfunction. They called on then-federal
Health Minister Allan Rock to impose restrictions on the use of
soy-based infant formulas. There has also been concern over whether or
not soy consumption can have an impact on thyroid function in adults.
 Dancingbear40 
Your
post-workout meal may very well be your most important meal of the day.
The reason is that when you’re finished with an intense workout, you’re
entering a catabolic state (muscle eating state) where your muscle
glycogen is depleted and increased cortisol ( fat storing/muscle eating
hormone) levels are beginning to excessively break down muscle tissue.
These conditions (if left to go too long)
are not good and the only way to reverse this catabolic state (and
promote an anabolic state (muscle growing state)) is to consume a
quickly digestible post-workout meal as soon as you can after training.
The goal is to choose a meal with quickly digestible carbs (not fiber)
to replenish muscle glycogen as well as quickly digestible protein to
provide the amino acids needed to jump start muscular repair. The surge
of carbohydrates and amino acids from this quickly digested meal
promotes an insulin spike from the pancreas, which shuttles nutrients
into the muscle cells. Whey protein is the fastest acting protein
available and this is why it is absolutely ideal for the post-workout
period. Ingesting 30 to 40 grams of pure whey protein isolate will
quickly switch your body from a state of catabolism to a state of
anabolism. Your body will stop breaking down muscle protein because it
will now be provided with an external source. This quick shot of whey
protein will be rapidly absorbed by your muscles and will speed up the
rate of protein synthesis going on within your body. This will
ultimately lead to a faster recovery period and greater gains in muscle
mass. The most important thing to remember here is that you must mix
your protein in water, not milk. The reason for this is that you want
the fastest acting protein you can possibly get, and milk slows down the
absorption of whey significantly. So does fiber. Any other time during
the day milk is fine, but during the post-workout period you must use
water. These carbohydrates should ideally come in the form of simple
sugar from a high glycemic juice or other sugary drink. Not fiber. The
easiest and cheapest method that I have found is to simply go to the
grocery store and purchase a bag of corn sugar (dextrose). This is a
cheap and very effective post-workout sugar. You need to replenish
your blood sugar levels and help to restore your muscle glycogen. Both
of these have been drained as a result of your workout and play a very
important role in energy production and muscle building. Even more
importantly than that, a quick shot of simple sugars during the
post-workout period will produce an insulin-spike in your body. This
rapid rise in insulin will drive all of that important protein (and the
other nutrients I’m about to mention) into your muscle cells at an even
faster rate. On the biological value scale of protein, where a whole
egg is 100. Whey protein is rated at 104. Soy protein is rated at 74.
Trimmed steak and chicken breast are both 80. Soy protein is relatively
low quality compared to other easily accessible proteins.

Dancingbear40 make is making point, of which you are kind of missing: you say just because it was turned down doesn’t make it bad…Dancingbear40 is saying it doesn’t necessarily make it good either. Both valid points.
 Saiberkid 
And you are that 99% lol sucker. Next time just look at yourself in the mirror and look for the bog L on your forhead. I am making about 8 G a month off lossers like you. Pyramids are great when there are suckers like you around lol
 Saiberkid 
Elizzyp, you are right about that only suckers fall for it. But the biggest fool is you who seem to know all about it and sit on chat boards waisting your time writing about something you are not even involved in LOL sucker!!
 moneymakingva 
Man it is so funny to hear you hater’s out there who just didn’t make it in the business. The reason most people don’t make is because you don’t follow the system that was in place. But i guarantee if you your has training to do your job you will be their. Why build somebody else’s dream when you can build your own. But wait you’ll say that we are in a pyramid scheme how bout you think about something for a little bit. Where you work, who makes the most money, CEO than the President, VP, Managers, Supervisors, than people like you and me who are employee’s. Now i hate to tell you but you will never make more than the CEO so in today’s society that would be called a pyramid also. So that is BIG scam because when you walk in the door for that job you are hoping that you will be able to make alot of money to do what retire. Please, you won’t be able to retire because they will fire you and hire somebody else so they won’t have to pay you retirement. So while you out here hating on people who are making a difference go look in the mirror and hate yourself for wasting time at your stinking job where in 15-20 yrs without retirement you might be saying welcome to Walmart have a wonderful day.
 Saiberkid 
You are right just like I am suckering people into drinking a shake. Mc Donalds is suckering families into feeding their kids food that is slowly killing them and starting an epidemic of Diabetes and heart disease. And you guys are smart lol Yeah I love this world stupid asses all over the place. I got about 500 suckers in my downline paying my bills LOL keep em coming
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
The false promise: Follow the money folks… People in mlms claim to make millions and have helped other make millions but yet have nothing to show for it. They claim they make money yet drive crappy cars, live in apartments, and best of all will

never reveal their W2 or 1099’s simply because they never made any real

money but rather made less money than a guy working in corporate America. We have asked over a dozen agents from Primerica, 5Linx and
Visalus for some 1099’s and have received nothing in the past 2 years
and yet constantly argue that they make money. Simply pathetic. We even
met a guy at Primerica who claimed to make $30,000 a month and yet wore a
$100 suit, lived in a van and smelled homeless but yet he made $30,000 a
month… WOW… Do you really want to belong to that crow of elite idiots?
 Ecusouthpaw15 
this is such an ignorant article
 Ecusouthpaw15 
why would anyone waste their time to give some random slandering individual a copy of their financials?  I’m sorry, you are WHO again??
 Elizzyp 
It is a ignorant article because it doesn’t say what you want it to. It tells the tructh and that is what you visalus bunch hate isn’t it.
 Elizzyp 
He didn’t say anything about fiancials he just said if you are braging about how much money you make you should be willing to proof it.
 Elizzyp 
You mlm flunkies are really dense.  They brain wash you into believing every business is a pyramid.  I have a job that pays me, gives me benefits, insurance, vacations, sick days, pays social security and medicare for me, pays unemployment taxs ( so if I do lose my job I will have an income), In 15-20 years working at a job you will have retirement, you will not have to pay health bills, you will have had vacations paid for, you will have had a pay check you could count so that you could have saved, you would be able to put them on loan applications for houses, cars, furniture etc so you will have that.  After working 15-20 years for an mlm you will have nothing but lost friends and bills.  I can not believe that you actually are brainwashed enough to think that because they get you to foot the bill for selling their crap you own a business.  LOL It is a pyramid because you have to recruit other people (your own competition) In a real jon you don’t do that.
 Elizzyp 
I would rather chase my tail then bunch of BS Visalus is pushing at least I would have something if I caught it.  LOL
 Elizzyp 
They are taught well in their stalking brain washing sessions.  I wonder wish cycle is stalking. He is out witting his own common sense.  You know these people are desperate when they reach for the Bible.“Go ahead hate you neighbor, go ahead cheat a friend, do it in the name of Jesus you can justify in the end.  But one day judgement day came……..”That is an old protest song of Peter, Paul, and Mary.
 Elizzyp 
You would not miss lead them but you are selling Visalus?  What is wrong with this picture.
 Elizzyp 
You are disgusting.  You not only make money off people by lying to them but you than you turn around and brag about it. Sold your soul did ya?
 Elizzyp 
If I am a sucker so be it.  But I will always cry out when I see people being taken advantage of.  I don’t have to be personally involved to know when something is wrong. That is called having morals. LOL at you.
 Elizzyp 
And you are dusgusting. Sold soul um…how does that feel.
 Elizzyp 
I have learnt most the time the hard way.  I am trying to educate other people so they won’t have to learn the way I did.
 Elizzyp 
back ground in powerlifting and personal training is that Visalus talk for hey I watch TV.  I have something I would not trade for your back ground commonn sense.  About my grammar I am not in English Class nor am I submitting a paper for puplication I am on a blog…….get real.. I miss push some letters so what.  It is the ideas that are in question here not writing ability.  By the way I don’t pretend to be a professional writer nor an English Teacher just a humble accountant and the numbers don’t add up.
 Elizzyp 
Good post
 Elizzyp 
Most say Visalus gives them a lot of energy. What in it gives them this?  Sorry to bother but I am afraid if they knew they would still lie about it.
 Elizzyp 
I am not making assumptions.  The fact that you are selling Visalus speaks for itself.
 Dancingbear40 
if soy was bad it would taken off the market…wow…you mean like cigarettes? or alcohol?  not very logical.
 Dancingbear40 
you don’t do any of what you’ve just said…other than be a stay at home mom.  You’re failing and being convinced that you’re not.
 Dancingbear40 
you equate loosing weight with first hand knowledge of…what exactly?  Loosing weight is not a way to measure health, it’s a perceived notion of health put out by the media, television etc.  And nobody except superficial individuals care about having a BMW.  Who really cares what type of constructed metal riding machine you drive.  Every single comment posted by Visalus individuals seem to be focused on weight loss and money.  Why not be like the rest of us and focus on sincere happiness and health.  Being skinny doesn’t mean you’re healthy, having a BMW that you have to pay for doesn’t equate to anything healthy either…you seem confused.

And just because you received a lot of money for becoming an“Ambassador”doesn’t mean much to most people who have true health and wealth.  It just shows that you have been lobbied by another well to do manipulative corporation.  One of the big concerns in this world are people like Ally081022.  Focus on money at whatever expense necessary.  The products you are offering assist you in loosing weight because they are starving your body nutritionally.  To loose weight properly you need five to six whole food meals per day.  You need an exercise regiment, maybe a trainer as well.  The shakes you offer are filled with fibre and soy.  Soy is very dangerous unless fermented properly.  You’re assisting people in an unhealthy lifestyle choice.  Not my opinion, a fact.
 Dancingbear40 
It does not show she is a professional in her field.  It shows she has spell check and wishes to convey her message accurately.
 Dancingbear40 
The soy is non GMO, it’s a soy isolate and actually has no estrogen in it at all???  How can a soy isolate be free of phytoestrogens?  It isn’t fermented, otherwise it wouldn’t be a soy iso.  Please explain.
 Dancingbear40 
Maybe you could visit my wife at the University of Toronto in her lab and explain it to her…I’m sure she would be more than willing to here what you have to say.
 Dancingbear40 
right. it doesn’t state that it is new zealand whey or that the cows are meadow fed…and yes, soy promotes an unhealthy amount of estrogen in the human body.
 Dancingbear40 
Your post-workout
meal may very well be your most important meal of the day. The reason
is that when you’re finished with an intense workout, you’re entering a
catabolic state (muscle eating state) where your muscle glycogen is
depleted and increased cortisol ( fat storing/muscle eating hormone)
levels are beginning to excessively break down muscle tissue. These
conditions (if left to go too long) are not good and the only way to
reverse this catabolic state (and promote an anabolic state (muscle
growing state)) is to consume a quickly digestible post-workout meal as
soon as you can after training. The goal is to choose a meal with
quickly digestible carbs (not fiber) to replenish muscle glycogen as
well as quickly digestible protein to provide the amino acids needed to
jump start muscular repair. The surge of carbohydrates and amino acids
from this quickly digested meal promotes an insulin spike from the
pancreas, which shuttles nutrients into the muscle cells.

Whey
protein is the fastest acting protein available and this is why it is
absolutely ideal for the post-workout period. Ingesting 30 to 40 grams
of pure whey protein isolate will quickly switch your body from a state
of catabolism to a state of anabolism. Your body will stop breaking down
muscle protein because it will now be provided with an external source.
This quick shot of whey protein will be rapidly absorbed by your
muscles and will speed up the rate of protein synthesis going on within
your body. This will ultimately lead to a faster recovery period and
greater gains in muscle mass.

The
most important thing to remember here is that you must mix your protein
in water, not milk. The reason for this is that you want the fastest
acting protein you can possibly get, and milk slows down the absorption
of whey significantly. So does fiber. Any other time during the day milk
is fine, but during the post-workout period you must use water.

These
carbohydrates should ideally come in the form of simple sugar from a
high glycemic juice or other sugary drink. Not fiber. The easiest and
cheapest method that I have found is to simply go to the grocery store
and purchase a bag of corn sugar (dextrose). This is a cheap and very
effective post-workout sugar.
You
need to replenish your blood sugar levels and help to restore your
muscle glycogen. Both of these have been drained as a result of your
workout and play a very important role in energy production and muscle
building.

Even
more importantly than that, a quick shot of simple sugars during the
post-workout period will produce an insulin-spike in your body. This
rapid rise in insulin will drive all of that important protein (and the
other nutrients I’m about to mention) into your muscle cells at an even
faster rate.

ViSalus protein mix is very high in fiber and designed for slow digestion and slow absorption
into the body, which is great for any meal of the day other than post-workout.

On
the biological value scale of protein, where a whole egg is 100. Whey
protein is rated at 104. Soy protein is rated at 74. Trimmed steak and
chicken breast are both 80. Soy protein is relatively low quality
compared to other easily accessible proteins.
 Dancingbear40 
Huh.  It’s still a poorly made product comparatively speaking.
 Davevanoke 
BLA ! BLA BLA!
 Dancingbear40 
But still.  Wouldn’t you rather get your information about weight loss and financial success from professionals?
 Elizzyp 
To me what proves Visalus is a scam more than anything is the way they flood the web with fake unbiased reviews.  They must have something to hide or they wouldn’t be throwing up the distractions that way.
 Ecusouthpaw15 
hahaha….ok you got me
 Ecusouthpaw15 
The reason that ViSalus doesnt OFFER our products to retail stores is as plain as day. It would totally defeat the purpose of an IBO having the opportunity to be an IBO. If I could go to the store&amp;get our products from GNC, then there would be no need for the entrepreneur IBO. ViSalus is not going to“sell out”the distributor base to the retail franchise market.
 Ecusouthpaw15 
Secondly, our products are federally funded by the National Institute of Health, patented and patent-pending, and formulated in an FDA-inspected laboratory. BCBS is even reimbursing insurance claims for our products on a case by case basis for employees with chronic health problems related to obesity as well as diabetes. Which also means, Doctors are writing prescriptions for ViSalus as a proactive means of weight management.
 Davevanoke 
Well Said!
 Ecusouthpaw15 
actually its $29 a month for your entire business overhead (website included)  and that’s only if you want the upgraded PRO.  The basic site is free my man
 Mrbamboostick 
Good research!
 Elizzyp 
You have completely lost it.  Your products are not funded by the NIH unless Visalus set up the bogus institute how can you lie like that? Are you that desperat.  I can see how you could be since they sell this crap all over the net work. Visalus doesn’t even try to control the quality or quanity of their distributors and they are so greedy they even sell it on the web.  You can not get a patent on anything that use ordinary ingrediants (like vitamins, soy), etc there is nothing unusal about them and the procedure to mix them is ordinary. There is nothing new to patent.  Doctors are not allowed to write prescriptions for over the counter by brand name.  Get Real Get a Brain.  They are going to be coming after you next you will be seeing little green men and hearing voices.  UNbelivable………….
 Elizzyp 
You have no sense of understanding of business.  The reason they don’t sell in stores is simple.  They can not compete with similar products on price and quality.  They could not sell this stuff to the people you do because they are your friends and family and you are really conning them into some get rich quick scheme.  Without the scheme no one would bother with the product.  It would be no one chose without being cohersed. They get you flunkies to pay all the expenses and push it off on your friends and family til they have sucked you dry than they move on to new suckers. Lordy people get some common sense.
 Davevanoke 
BLA BLA BLA…
 Ecusouthpaw15 
once again, This is all documented information, I have actual prescriptions written by real doctors, actually BCBS information, and all the NIH info can all be corroborated if you would actually do some research from accredited sources as oppose to reading the Daily Inquirer….
 Ecusouthpaw15 
hey kid, you haven’t brought any facts to the table, only your very small opinion that leaves a lot to be desired. You continue to“do you!”But thank you! Seriously! Because it’s ignorant uneducated people like yourself who continue to bring nothing to this world (other than a bunch of complaining) that reaffirm my gratitude and appreciation for the opportunity that we’ve been blessed with everyday.  So for you who complains all day, angry at the world, and says that it can’t be done, stop interrupting the rest of us who have done it already.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
I’m not asking…the nice people at Secret Entourage are asking. I don’t blame you if you don’t want to post something like that here…pretty personal stuff to post on the Internet.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
This is getting ridiculous. There are some of you here that I’ve had the pleasure of debating this subject, and we just seem to be going in circles. Other than what Ecusouthpaw15 just wrote–which is a well thought-out post and is information I had yet to hear on this blog (kinda made me go“hmmm”), we are just repeating ourselves.

I’ll bet that we share the same views on a lot of other subjects, just not mlm…and that’s cool…everyone can’t share the same views (what a boring world this would be). I guess what I’m trying to say is: regardless of what I’ve written on this blog, just know that I don’t think any of you are bad people,…we just don’t agree on this one subject. Hell, I bet if we hung out together over a couple brews, we’d probably discover we share more in common than we think!

To Dave Vanoke: I’ll admit that I was being a smart-ass with you the other day, my apologies…I guess sometimes I post things a little too quick, then regret it afterwards. You seem like a nice, intelligent chap, and I wish you luck in your business (not being sarcastic here).

To Elizzyp: you’ve been like my brother/sister here on this blog, supporting and complimenting my posts…I’m happy to hear some of your family members are coming around. I think you are a very caring and passionate person with strong family values, and I admire that very much.
 WholeFoodsGuy 
Yeah, you are off a little on those claims. Only thing I can find is that Visalus is based on NIH funded research. Very different that actually being funded.
Also, here’s a quote from the product data sheet that I found interesting.“These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.”FDA inspected laboratory means nothing except that the lab is safe. Speaks nothing of the product itself.
 WholeFoodsGuy 
Further, I have yet to find a patent that Visalus owns. Their products use patented (by other companies) ingredients which many other products use as well. They do seem to have one patent pending, which means they’ve applied for a patent, not that it will be approved.
 VisalusPAYS 
Funny story…I sold $5000 worth of products the FIRST MONTH and now sell over $20,000 per month and have a free BMW. Hmm…yeah I’ll take that’scam of the month’EVERY DAY. You’re entitled to your opinion and just because you can’t follow a simple system and make money by accident is only because of the 21st letter of the alphabet. Fix that and you can make real money too.
 WholeFoodsGuy 
Funny. You call other people out for not doing research and it seems you haven’t even read the agreement you signed with them.
“I understand that I am not being sold a franchise or business opportunity.”
Entrepreneur? IBO? What?
 WholeFoodsGuy 
Brilliant. You’re more evidence of what this article and the one referenced below are pointing out. Everyone involved in these things lies about how much they make. Why? Because it’s in your best interest to do so. You need to so that you can sell more of your product or you won’t get that BMW payment. Trust me, that BMW is far from free.
 Debbiekranidis 
Wow why are you guys so brutal? If you don’t believe in Visalus that’s fine,but on the other hand some people do….respect that. Another point to make in regards to FDA…it means squat….really you would trust their stamp of approval. They are making money stamping stuff and then you see all those commercials to call an attorney if you have been affected or seriously injured or even died. Stick with what works for you dont be haters .
 http://twitter.com/boomchek Maciej B 
Let me explain why most of you MLM’ers here are slightly delusional, something that many people here are trying to tell you.

Yes, both an MLM and a 9-5 day job structure are in the shape of a pyramid.  However your day job doesn’t require you to pay money to get hired, unlike MLM initiation fees, nor does it require you to buy minimum amounts of products every month.  Imagine you worked in a car parts store and every month you’d be required to purchase $250 worth of car parts.  Wouldn’t that be silly?  Yeah, I thought so.  Also a regular job doesn’t push you to recruit more people to work for them or underneath you.  That’s typically what MLM companies do, as well as pimps and drug dealers.  Just sayin.

If the MLM product you’re trying to pitch is so great, then trust me, it would be sold in the stores.  But it’s not, so instead of educated nutritionists selling these shakes, the company will take ANYONE off the street to peddle them to their friends and family, ANYONE who pays the initiation fee with promises of riches in the long run.  Why should I trust my health to some company I’ve never heard of, with my daily nutrition sold by someone who probably never had a day of nutrition or fitness training ever in their life?  Best way to lose wieght?  Keep calories low, and excercise.  There are no shortcuts. None.

If you’d like to hold on to your friends, please keep your MLM business and friend activities seperate.  Don’t spam your facebook about your products day in and day out, keep personal parties and product demos seperate, and respect the fact that not everyone will agree with you about your products or want to be a distributor.  I’ve had“friends”who post 30 articles a day about their MLM products, whose posts I had to permantently hide because it was just too much spam, to“friends”who sent out invites to their birthday/moving/going away/summer bbq parties at which there would be quick product presentations about their MLM business.  If I wanted a presentation I’d ask for one.  I don’t care to go to a LEISURE party only to be pitched stuff about some business, especialy by a“friend”.   Imagine if I worked at a bakery, and all I’d post about on facebook was breads, and more breads, and when I’d throw parties at my place I’d make every one learn more things about how bread is made and how great it is.  I think everyone would get tired of it all quite fast.  That’s how we feel when you MLM’ers spam us with your MLM flavour of the day idea.

Lastly, if you’re going go all out and promote your company and scream as to how great it is, perhaps you should do it after achieving some level of success first.  Bragging how Visalus will give you a free Bimmer, or how 25 people a day qualify for free Bimmers is all great but why aren’t you the one driving the“free”car?  Your friends might believe you once you get to that level yourself, but until then, shut up and work hard.  And besides, the free Bimmer is not free.  You’ll get up to $600/month reimbursed if you drive a black BMW and achieve a certain level of product sales.  If you fall off that level, you’ll lose the reimbursement.  Simple as that.  Plus, if your credit is crap and you don’t qualify for a lease through BMW financial, you’re not going to get any BMW lease whatsoever.  Now here’s an idea.  Start your own small business, and you can too write off your lease payments when doing tax returns.  Work in sales?  Same thing.  Nothing special here.  Oh yeah, and to those who think that your company somehow created a black BMW shortage and that BMW created special colors just for Visalus (somewhere in the comments way below), please lay off the crack pipe and grow up.  Just another brainwashing you got from your upline.

The reason I’m writing all this?  I’ve known many people who pitch whatever MLM product is hot as the next best thing, trying to recruit me, only to change their pitch a year later about some other MLM scam they say is even better than the previous one.  Keep this in mind kids:  those who are successful in an MLM business, whether they’re your upline or someone way higher who are making a ton of money, have the personality to be successful at ANY sales job.  They can sell hot tubs, crayons, or fanny packs, and they’d make a killing off it, just because they are good at selling anything.  Every company has these superstars.  Don’t think that they are good because of the product they pitch.  They were born good or they trained to be good and can apply their selling skills anywhere.

Good luck!

i pay…or should i say PAID 99 plus shipping. to have it AUTOSHIPPED every month is FREE. now…for the transformation kit i think thats the hefty price tag one…. I am getting mine for free. i have a few friends doing it with me. i am also a promoter. only been in it for about a month. my up line has been in it for 6 months. is making around 4,000 a month. and the wife, husband and 18 yr old son are all driving BMW’s…. they are living comfortably to say the least. i see their checks…. i see how they live. where they live. thats proof enough for me.
 BBVI 
OR MINE lol nicolewoodcock.bodybyvi.com :] i agree with david! NOT JUNK!
 Xdonkeykongx 
LMFAO
1..Don’t know when this article was posted…but the“few lucky”regional directors has reached over 5000….
2 There is no requirement to put any decals anywhere.
3. at the RD level you are making an extra $600-$3000 on top of the $600 bonus.
4. you don’t quit your job at the RD level unless you are a moron.
5. You don’t lease the BMW unless you a) can afford it outside of visalus or b) you make a decision not to quit promoting…(just as you would do with a job)
6. your article makes you sound like you are a complete failure that got lied to about how netWORK marketing works…
7 there are probably about 300 nutritionists that are now promoting this, and Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance is covering the cost of it for some folks who have obesity related diseases.
8 the $1200 commissions for selling $5000 of product, good luck finding that kind of margin in any traditional sales job.

9 you are so dumb, you are really dumb, you know that (antoine dobson)
 Elizzyp 
please get some different brain washing. You are a hater , you are a negative person is getting old. You MLMers have wore it out.
 Elizzyp 
This is the most sense you have made.
 Elizzyp 
All documented information. Documented where, Visalus web site. Oh, Goody I am going to beleive them. I would find more truth and less delusion in the Daily Inquirer than from you Visalus people.  You use words like and based on and expect people not to see through it.  If you believe that doctors write prescription for this crap ( I mean since when do you need a prescription to get this stuff it is sold on ever street corner and back alley) and that BCBS will pay for it you must not only have a steady diet of reading the Daily Inquirer you must write for them.  Did you come down on a space ship and bring Visalus to the world as a gift.  LOL
 Elizzyp 
Yes I will continue to be me.  I will stand up when some is being done wrong.  But you do know I hope that even though I am standing up to you because ai think you are hurting others I would also stand up for you If some one was hurting you.  I an not complaining and I am not angry. I have resaerched this company going back to its beginning and I am not against you I against them for conning people like you. I don’t think you are aware of the wrong you are doing to your friends and family but they are aware of it and don’t care.  They do not care if you or anyone else gets hurt. They tell you a bunch of lies and they are the best at brain washing and I know you were looking for an opportunity to better yourself.  They take advantage of that and fill you with misinformation.  i am not angry at you. You are just another one of their victims and I hope you come out of it ok.
 Elizzyp 
1-9 especailly 7 You really aren’t that delusional are you.  Did they wash all common sense out of your brain?
 Elizzyp 
You are either lying or so delusional they will come and lock you.  Don’t drive any heavy equipment.
 Elizzyp 
Don’t go.  Yes we are going over and over the same things but there are new people coming on that don’t have the facts and need your help.  Your intelligence and knowledge would be missed.  You have never been a smart ass, that’s me.  I see everything as a satire and with humor and can not resist putting my jabs into the mix. You have been very informative and polite.
 Elizzyp 
You have been in a month and your up line has been living this life for six months.  uh uh uh……..Every wonder why there is no long timers……….
 Elizzyp 
The sale has became a GIANTATIC sale.
 Elizzyp 
Talking about it being 2011 doesn’t it bother anyone that this stuff still comes in a powder form that needs to be put in a mixer with milk.  I thought they had evolved away from that a long time ago.   Just wonder it seems awful unhandy.
 Elizzyp 
Finally, you are saying something intelligent.
 Benstillerfaggot69 
false.
Visalus has removed the Isoflavons from the Soy, no phytoestrogens in this shake.

Also, proper nutrition has been proven 1000 times over as a way to increase your metabolism and burn fat.

As long as you can get your vitamins, protein and fibre, youre good to go. The shakes aren’t miracle drugs, its grade 9 biology.

The patented anti-aging energy formula is the only real revolution. But it won’t help with weight, just wrinkles, hair, and hearing.

sorry for bursting your  bubble. You just hate MLM, which is fine, because so do I. But I’m not to blinded by hate to ignore the facts.

They’re cheaper that 95% of their competitors, and they taste better than all of them.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Much appreciated…I’m not going anywhere (yet)…

so i been lookin at the chat board and your a fuckin idiot…visalus is like any other job, you put the time into it you get paid well which is exactly what they are trying to promote.  They offer a company car in which they will pay for it if you continue to work for them.  Its like any job but the hype for this job is that it is readily available and there is huge opportunity in it if the time is put in.  You would be selling a product to people who need it which i know works from seeing my friends take the challenge. its not a scam, its a job.  Its actually one of the easiest jobs out there. Recruit a person a day and get an outstanding commission sounds pretty good.  I know that by reading your posts you are under 16 and are very stubborn.  Even if the facts were right under your nose which they ARE you would still believe urself.

$1200 commission on $5000?

Wow, great margin.

So, can you tell us why the great commissions?
 Ripoff 
They offer a company car? You are totally wack.
 Elizzyp 
To get that great commission you have to pay $500 or $1000. Sign up three people under you. Then you have to sell that amount yourself to some one you have not signed up under you.  This is not as easy as it sounds because what you are really selling is not the crappy product but the selling of the crappy product so it is kind of hard to sell the people $5000 of product.
 Elizzyp 
You are delusional like the other MLMers that hasn’t come to their senses.  You are the one who is not seeing what is under your nose.  Read what Ex-Visalus Distributor ( he/she has been there) and Jerry wrote. If I was the only one here telling you this I might understand your insults but I will just chalk it up to the lack of charcter that it takes to con your friends and family.

Interesting conversation.  I work a full time job. I play the penny stock market. I have a college degree (which really doesnt mean anything)  My wife did avon.  She made some money.  Enough to make our monthly car payment.  We did Monavie in early mid 2000’s.  Made about $1500 in 4 months and couldnt afford autoship anymore (neither could our friends).  We did Amway in 90’s.  Made nothing.  We own an Mixed Martial Arts apparel company on the side.  Alot of fun.  Selling alot of shirts but overhead for website, ecommerce, inventory, marketing and sponsorships of fighters puts us still at a loss after 1 1/2 years.   Our AI (Angel Investor) knows the market and our business plan puts us profitable in about another 6 months.   My wife started Visalus in September.  I lost 20 pounds and quit coffee.  My buddies who fight for a living say they love it (their not distributors).  Our autoship has been free because we have about a dozen customers.  My wife, in 3 months has about 35 distributors.  Her commissions are way more than we anticipated.  Most of her distributors pay nothing for their autoship.  She got the BMW bonus.  That was nice.  We bought a used BMW w/ low miles for about $300 a month.  We pocket the difference towards gas and maintanence.   Just like the penny stock market, I do not fall in love w/ companies.  I follow trends and momentum.  If Visalus lasts long and continues to grow, great.  If not, we move on.   I would be hard pressed to call it a scam though.  Great Blog.  Thanks for the content.

Good! You have a rang of sanity they dearly needed.  I look at it this way in trying to get these MLMer’s attention I maybe a smart ass but that is better than being a dumb ass…….not naming any names…….

The Patent you are talking about is pending and has not been proven to do anything.. I just read a newspaper article that said after an 18 year study that vitamin supplements are useless and can even be harmful if you get to much of a certain vitamin ( this dependents on individual make up). It went on to state that the only mineral that has been proven to benefit us on a daily basis is calcium. Of course we have known for years that vitamin supplements go right through our body and are a waste of time.  But concerning Visalus is the fact the people selling this make out it is such a miracle drug with everything your body needs and such a great weight loss product but then they still try to sell you appitite suppresents and vitamins…why is that why do you still need all this other stuff if the shakes are such a great thing?  Just wondering….
 Elizzyp 
You better not call it a job some of these Visalus people will go off on you.   They do not want a job  they are business owners   I dare You.  Visalus will not like it either because the contract you signed with them says (maybe you didn’t read it  oh surely you are smarter than that) plainly that you are not an employee and you don’t represent them……It looks like you made a boo boo.
 Elizzyp 
That is a funny story Ha Ha Ha Ha……………
 Atm 
so you are good at selling unknown products to customers that you find. Why not start your own independent business and you can make a lot of money.
 Elizzyp 
All kidding aside. Visalus people lets talk.  The principal that I live my life on is that I have lived my long enough to know that there is very few things in life are worth getting upset about and even fewer people.  One of the things I find worth getting upset about is people taking advantage of other people.  I am sure you are good people as the anti visalus people are good people. I am not angry at you I am angry at Visalus for taking advantage of YOU.  I think we are on this earth for the same thing trying to live our life the best we can and we should help each other along. I wish you could see yourself from our advantage point ( which is you in about 6 months or so)  They have taught you that if we are aginst Visalus we are against you (nothing could be father from the truth we would like to help you) that we are haters but aren’t you the one doing the hating.  Hating us for popping your bubble. You call us negative but are you the negative ones automatically think we are hating on you and are ignorant. They teach you that you are helping people but they are using you to use your friends and families poor body images and the desire to better their circumstances against them to sell them a product that is iffy at best.  They know you are the only one who could sell this stuff and scheme to them because they love and trust you.  They don’t care that your loved ones are going to feel betrayed by you and you are going to feel ashamed and sorry.  They are taking advantage of your desire to do better for your family.   The big titles, BMW, meetings, that you own a business are to trap you into a faking feeling of self importance.  They want to tell you you own a business because they do not want to take responsibility for you ( that is why they encourage you to lie) or to you.  They want you to take all the risk, expense and exposure.  They can offer you the BMW because it is no exposure to them just you. I am not disparaging you only the company and their tatics.  I pray for and wish you all well.  We all have been brainwashed at one time or another the trick is  to recognize it and but a stop to it .  It is not being weak to be brainwashed it is weak to let them get by with it and not to defend others from it.

Thanks for the comment.  I truly think that you will run into this with any situation where you must market someone else’s product.  I have actually felt guilty at one time or another in my sales rep jobs since graduating college in 1990.  My life as a sales rep selling medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, finacial planning and even insurance for a major company has been filled w/ suggestions from the corporation to cut corners in order to make the sale.  To be quite honest, I see very little difference of the marketing approach of big conventional businesses and these multi level marketing deals.  These conventional firms (especially in the insurance and finanical planning industry) push you to contact all your friends and family first.  When my friends and family had claims that didnt qualify wheter they were in the right or wrong, I turned out to be the bad guy.  Almost every company wheter conventional or multi level has tactics that takes advantage of consumers.  Example- tobacco, pharmaceutical, health and wellness products, fast food, automotive sales, mortgage.     I have friends and family who market (sell) in all those arenas.  You could replace the visalus name above with Philipp Morris, Fannie Mae, the local car dealership, hydroxy cut, bank of america.  Again, Great Blog.  Just note, some of the sponsors on the side of your site have been documented to have takent advantage of consumers or even workers.
Peace,

This is not my site but I think the advertisers on the side are meant to be sarcasm rather than actual advertsing.  I get you point but my objection to visalus ( and the ones like them is they don’t stop at selling a overpriced worthless even harmful product to your friends and family but to get them to invest their hard earned money also and to sell all this under theguise of helping people.  Also they preach so much hate for people who don’t go along with them.  Look at past posts from people selling you would think we attacked their religion.  It is the tricks and the manupliation of people.  The way the try to make people believe that they are business owners when all they really want is not to have any responsibility to or for the people they use.  The main objective is to get the people selling to take all rhe risk, expense, and exposure.  They do not care what happens to these people they have set up for a fall.  I have worked in nonprofit most my work life so I have no moral qualms.  But can see were people come from if they do.  But my point again is we have to many in this world out to scam us we don’t need to have to worry about our family and friends doing it.  Good luck

I am not a Visalus distributor, but I like your comment. Especially your advice–focus on the positive things in life. I will keep in mind.
 Debbiekranidis 
This comment goes out to Elizzyp…..you seem to have enough time to sit here and be a hator,but guess what haters are motivators! You seem to have done your research on Visalus however you see the concept but in your warped mind you are finding negative things to say. How healthy are you? What is your weight…….do you have a goal to become a better person whether it be mentally or physically? Probably not. You are paying to start up a business if you know anything about business you would get it.I could sit here forever and go back and forth with you ,but i have to get off my chair and go to work. Ps i have lost 5lbs in 9 days on the challenge. Kudos to me!
 Elizzyp 
I really think you MLMers need to come up with a new brainwashing  because hatrers, negative people, ignorant people, losers all the negative terms they taught you to use toward people that disagree with you should be changed you have really wore those out.  I take the time to sit here and try to save some one from this scam because I care and I even care about you even though you have such hate for people you don’t even know but that see through all the smoke and mirrors and try to help you. Don’t you see you are the ones hating being negative to people who care enough to try to help you.  Don’t you see you are the losers because this company has made you into losers. Can you not see that you are the uninformed because.you did not do enough research into this company and its tatics but that is what they count on.  Donn’t you realize they want you to hate and be negative toward us because they don want you informed and to slip out of their web until they have sucked you dry.  Please be careful there is a bunch of people that has been taking this and ending up in the hospital. I heard of an Ambassador who ended up in the hospital, got out and went to one of the brainwashing meets, came back and got off the plane and had to go back into the hospital, please pray for him everyone. I am very healthy.  If you want to lose weight get on a healthy eating habit, exercise and you not only lose weight but lose it and keep it off. Quick weight lost is not healthy.  Plwase read all the postings here.  Educate yourself and then go and educate others.  I have done a lot of charity work. But right now my goal to make myself a better person is to care enough to sit here and warn you and others.

Quote of the day by Charles Jones“The difference between who you are today and who you’ll be in 5 years are the people you spend time with and the books you read.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
You’ll hear variations of the following statement from distributors:“I’m just a simple person who wants to help people”…yeah, but they all have one common alterior motive: money…you really want to help people? why not canvass for the Heart and Stroke Foundation, volunteer your time at shelters/soup kitchens and help lines, donate to the Salvation Army…Distributors want your money, plain and simple. There are many reasons why MLM/ Pyramid schemes have such a bad rep.

You’re an idiot!  Every business is in it to make money, but not many out there like the companies you’ll find in the Direct Sales, Network Marketing industry who actually give more money back than most corporate companies ever will.  You get paid what you’re worth in this industry. If you don’t work you don’t get paid, kind of like a job, only here you’re accountable for you and what you are willing to do.
Get a clue, this industry sells more products, goods and services than any other industry.  You’d be wise to jump on board with one.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Why would I jump on board with someone who just called me an idiot.  You see people?  This is the class of people you’d be dealing with…plus, you missed the point entirely…the point is the distributors always say they“just want to help people”, when in fact, they just want to help themselves.

The MLM industry is laughable, and you mlmers crack me up! Good luck to you!
 Jamessheppardiii 
I have worked many“normal”dead end jobs from slave to management levels. I have worked the normal self employed own your own business angle. I have also been involved with the networking industry since 1983. I have to say its a crime to see that someone as ignorant as you can post this kind of information.  I know what kind of person you are from reading some of your stuff. For anyone that is looking at this for an informed opinion please do yourself the favor of getting a true informed opion, this website, and the person writing it, are simply being negative for the sake of something to do. This info is totally uninformed. It is one sided extemely biased.

The network marketing industry is exploding, it is FULL of success. Of course it is also full of losers, and scams, that’s true for any industry.  If you are looking into this industry you must go in with both eyes open. Like any other industry, there are good companies and good products, good people involved and“un-good”people. I have seen both.

For whomever is writing this site and these blogs, actually I feel sorry for you.  You are hanging a flag that reaks of ignorance. What you really should spend your time doing is getting yourself a real job and shutting up. However I understand you need attention and this is the way that you find you can fill that void, and thus validate yourself.

I hope you find a cure for your illness.  It really is embarassing and sad to see someone screaming for“look at me, I am so sick, I really need help”yet not excepting the help when it comes.

From an educated fellow in the work force. Good luck.J

I can not imagine anything more boring then drinking a shake (free or not) morning and noon. Having a meal is chewing, taste, texture, and aroma of your food this is what motivates you to stay on a diet and eat right. No the same old shake over and over and over……….No my idea of the good life.

I want to tank Elizzip and Ex-Visalus distributors for opening my eyes. Terrible how you can feel ashame when your enter a distribusionship like Visalus without beeing able to sale or when you just don’t want to rush people to buy. At the beggening i was approach by old frieds from college ( i’m 44 now) and was desparate to regain energy after 18 operations in 4 years. That was my real goal when i started Visalus and it worked after 1 week so i was realy happy and suddenly they wanted me to become a distributor and 1 had a week to make my decision so my friend could be a raising star. All of the sudden i was a distributor because i felt bad to let go my friend who helped me regaining my energy…..and so on.
After a while a strarted my rising star course to please my recrutor and so on…I past the first month working like crazy, preparing parties, even going at the hospital to talk to people like me, talking about the”supposed benefits on healt that my friend told me she saw, my experience, my weigh loss, and going on many“lost weight forums”to put my annonces. During that month my new customers where not so impressed by the product…they almost didn’t see any difference in their healt, weigh or energy. Of course i was starting to understand that 1 was an exception because of my past story of healt.  weeks after i had a terrible pain in my cheast…thinkinf 1 was going to faint…telling my husban to prepare himself for my hospital admission if so…but finaly it stoped. One of my up had a heart attack the next week but he is so convinced of the product and the buisness that he recruted 3 clients at the hospital saying that visalus had nothing to do with his heart attack, its just genetic for him. Well i went to make some reserch about that on the net….nothing. So i continued.
Its been 2 months now, i’m a rising star wouhouuuuuu did it but my pour 8 years old boy lost his mommy for a hole month…its ok because it will pay one day…but i’m thinking…hey…trying to sale Visalus to people is so hard…planting seed does not seem to work…the second month not a single party, none of my customers are realy satisfied to do so…and mainly…i don’t feel like i want to push anyone for gaining money. But my recruter is pushing on me…bringing me to conventions etc..He’s telling me that 1 don’t have the right attitude and approach..i should demonstrate that it is crucial that they try the product….that we need only 1 person to make the buisness advanced…last month it was only finding 3 distributors plus 1000$ of sale.. The stress is bigger…my energy is passing in that…i feel guilty not to honor my friend, guilty  because i dont feel good to push, guilty for not pushing for new clients that are absolutely not interresting  or my customers that i already have, to keep their orders, guilty not to do enough for my distributors except attending their parties and preparing them..guilty to loose the money that i invested to fast even if i was not interrested in selling at the beggining and ashamed because i let myself beeing fool..WOW suppose to be an easy job…better then working for an employer…making your own time when you want to work..having a support group…but i experienced the opposite…not easy job like they tried to make me think, having not one but 2 Boss calling me for reports, and for the support i feel pressure more then anything…etc.. They also had told me they would find a way so i can get new customers by sending me to parties…never…i had to plan my own and find my customers. Did i told you that i don’t drive and i’m not working because of my desease…. They new all that and promessed to helped me.
Now i realised that if i continue, i will fell right back where icome from…healt problems, lost in energy for so little money…and making money on my friend’s and family’s back no way! Not my style. so in french we sy…if you took the pill you have to swalloed it…that means if you make a bad decision, you have to live the consequences! So i’m swollowing my pill and i will take that as an experience in my life to grow better. Deal done…never again! Not a single MLM.
By the way…yesterday i had my results from a biopsie…they will have to do more investigations because my scells are suspects…so they will have to take of my tyroide…That has nothing to do with my desease…just a new thing…that confimed my decision of quiting this buisness. Enough stress in my life…Life is more important than a buisness or money!
Thanks again guys…. you made so much sens!
Sorry for my pour english…i’m from Montreal, Quebec and the vinet is still not in french here…one more difficulty in the buisness!

Thank You!!!!  Don’t blame yourself , don’t even blame your friends although they should not have preyed on someine as sick as you were. These people are the best brainwashers in the world.  You can be proud of yourself for escaping from it.  That is not easy as they are almost like a cult.  DON’T LET THEM ABUSE YOU MENTALLY. I will pray for youre medical conditions. Have your doctors check out the connections with Visalus and your thyroid as soy can have an effect on that gland.  Maybe you can get a suit going.  Be proud of yourself for learning and for having the courage to tell your story so that it may help others.  God Bless

Not sure how this“blog”works and not sure if I’m“relying”to the right“comment”..lol.. I actually am working with both Vi Salus and Monavie RVL people ( as well as XB Fit, Scentsy etc ) all good products, without a doubt, but“products”only do so much.  They can definitely“enhance”lives, but it’s INFORMATION that truly“changes”lives. People are looking for ANSWERS that“products”wont give them. Take a look at what L.I.F.E. is doing with Leadership/Life coaching. How people can make PROFIT investing $50 a month. No shiny cars, big trips but we DO teach FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT so you can have it WHEN YOU DESERVE it. lol. You can generate income without even sponsoring anyone. Great program. No“pushing product”, just helping people. ELIMINATING“competition”between“product based”companies so we can all get along…lol.. play nice people, be blessed, and Love….always…

If you really like sales you might try selling in the manufacturing or business arena.  I know womeone who sells packaging to companies to ship the products in. He is very successful. I don’t think you would feel guilty selling to companies goods the need to produce their products The salesmen always have the best benefits and car furnished to them with no strings. Just a Thought.
 Ellizzyp 
Just a thought in the hospitals when people can not eat they give them endure.  You just take off the cap and drink them.  You might want to try them and see what they do for you.  I am sure that you could use them for weight loss to if your wanted but the best way is and alsways will be to eat healthy and exercise.

Thank you for the information on Visalus.  I’m actually an associate for Isagenix another Health and Wellness Company that has been around since 2002.  They are an MLM company but they do not pressure you to become distributors.  Their focus is on the products and they do not offer a BMW.  If you sincerely want to have better health then I highly recommend you look into their products.  I have been researching Visalus because of all the marketing ploys.  Isagenix products appear to be more money but when you compare apples to apples they are a far superior product.  Some of the products cost more and some the same or less.
I don’t normally post on blogs but I’m tired of hearing about Body By Vi challenge.  Isagenix involves a total health and wellness program including cleansing the body of toxins.  I encourage people to get healthy by using supplementation and a healthy diet with exercise.  I don’t pressure people into becoming distributors unless they want to.

If you want more information go to http://www.karenfaguy.isagenix.com

Scam of the month you are funny, before you put down some people and misslead countless number of people i recomend that you do some research about Visalus Sciences, when you do that you will see that visalus has seen double digit grow each quarter over the past year not because they are ripping off people as you calim but for actually selling products that work by helping people lose weight and regain thier health. I am a distributor at Visalus Sciences and im doing great business wise. i have no complaints so far and i am very happy to work for such a wonderful company. check out my site and watch the videos contact me if you have any questions. rabie.bodybyvi.com 321-947-2568

Ok so I don’t know much about this product just recently saw my step sister constantly posting about it on her FB page…. then someone posted this so I decided to read it. My take on this IS if people are doing what my step sister is doing which is drinking shakes(with fresh fruit)…eating healthier and going to the gym everyday of course your going to see some sort of results. But I am thinking it is like everything else if you have it in your mind your tired of your lifestyle and are going to change it….well it probably isn’t the ViSalus thats making you feel better it is you being healthier as a whole. But for some reason people think they need a miracle pill or shake to do this! It is all in your mind people you see it everyday…usually when people get motivated to actually lose weight they aren’t just taking a pill or shake and then sitting on the couch LOL. They are trying to make a lifestyle change! And as for a free car that seems very similar to what MaryKay does LOL…sure you get the car as long as you stay in the position your in once you stop selling or aren’t selling as much you have to give the car back or pay for it yourself! By the way my step sister has been doing ViSalus for a month and hasn’t lost any weight but has lost an inch….I am going to give her the credit for that…not ViSalus. But weird thing she has been complaining of Chest pains I really hope it isn’t because of the shakes…..

That’s pitiful. Partly factual and incredibly negative. What do you do for a living? You are obviously not a writer. Should people get a free BMW for life without working for it? I don’t have one. I had a Mercedes lease and turned it in at the end. My business paid for it. I had to work everyday to earn it.

I don’t know as much as you since you are qualified to write a review but I just looked up Visalus and they have sold almost one billion in product this year. I’d say people have heard about it. As to why they don’t sell in GNC, why isn’t Avon at your department store. Network marketing and direct sales replaces advertising dollars with commissions. I think it’s a perfect business model. You should look into it more. With a positive attitude, you might be successful.

You are brainwashed.  They are doing nobody any favors.  They sell it by MLM because they want you to pay the expenses, you scam your family and friends, you find your competition and because they could not sell the stuff in stores. Use your common sense.

Stick around then you’ll have plenty to compain about. You are not helping people you are ripping them off and maybe even hurting them.

Get her to check that out with a doctor.  Our body has ways of warning us with something is wrong.  Some people have pains in their jaws and it is their heart who would ever think when they are having jaw pains they are having a heart attack so it is better to be safe than sorry even young people can have heart attacks.

The day you die may come sooner than you planned if you keep drinking this stuff.

I think it is interesting how desperate these Visalus people are that they come on a site debunking Visalus and leave the links.  Do they really think this is the place for them to recruit?

come on people it is obvious that who ever wrote this article is doing business with a competitor i am happy to be apart of visalus and there are thousands of people on my team that are happy too. why dont you do something productive with your spare time like making money instead of trashing other people. Just because i worked hard and i found success at visalus that dont make me a bad person. yes we got freedom of speech in this country but some people on this site are abusing it by making unsubstantiated comments and claims. like i said before do some research about visalus then talk. Hulk hogan, master p, lil romeo, steve harvey, and roy jones jr are some of the celebrities  that are satisfied customers of visalus. these people are not scam artist the are the foundation that america was built on. they had a dream and then worked hard to get it and that’s what we at visalus do. check out my site rabie.bodybyvi.com if you want info about the company the products the 90 day bodybyvi chalenge go to overview.visalus.com
 what the! 
“famous people”get paid to promote products…it is very unlikely they waste their time selling products, as they are already weathly.

The problem us non-sellers have with MLM businesses is the scaming you do in order to make money.  You sell products that are not necessary and guilt most people into feeling they have to have the product you are selling.

There are no magical ingredients in a visalus shake.  It is a protein shake.  Nothing exciting, nothing new, nothing but a shake.  Making people think they are buying a magical product is wrong.

I refuse to take part in that type of scheme….getting some money and a car is not rewarding to me by lying to my friends and family.

PS I am healthy, and love my job, love my friends, love my life.  I have no complaints about my life.  I don’t need a website to prove myself.

The celebrity or millionaire tie in: Many MLM’s use
celebrities, athletes, and millionaire to prove their business is legit.
Simply put, why would a smart millionaire or even billionaire endorse a
business if it wasn’t a great business. Everybody wants to make money
which is why you are contemplating joining to begin with, but those with
deep pockets are the ones who have made large amounts of money by
allowing companies to use their names, just so that you can give your
money and make those on top even more money. Celebrity tie ins have been
used for years in business and are a great way to get you to pay up but
reality is that those celebrities, regardless of what they say, are not
working at the bottom feeding those on top and have already been paid a
lot more than you will working 80 hrs a week. Be wary as legitimate
businesses DO NOT need to use such strategies to sell themselves to
employees which is the perfect example of how MLM companies think of you
as their customers, not employees.

Visalus would sell out their mother if it got them a dollar.  How can you say they would not sell out their distributor base when they take any one who will sell for them.  They do not even try to control the over saturation. They don’t even try to control the quality or quanity of the people selling.  They sell it on the internet, amazon, e-bay, Dr Steidman’s site, and anywhere else they can. Wake up people you are being used to sell this product to people you know because no one else would buy it.  When you run out of connections the company will be through with you. Read your contract you are not a representive of their company, you are not an employee, you are not a distributor, you are a customer. They feel no responsiblity to you or for you. That is why they don’t care if you get yourself in deep water with to much expense or a car loan or if you lie or cheat.  They will just say will they don’t work for us they just buy from us once in awhile.

I call it a scam and scam are not God sent. How about the poor people who you“helped”get into this who ran up expenses they can’t pay. Take money from their family to pay for this stuff.  What about the people who will be left with credit card bills and car loan they can no longer pay for because they have run out of people who are foolish enough to get into this?

I just bought or rather received my first and only 30-day shake mix. I ordered it to help a friend (distributor) out. I will try the product because and will either switch to another powder for more than half the price (Nature’s Plus SpiruTein) or simply cut my caloric intake without supplements.  It is possible to lose weight without shakes.
 Postergirl2005 
I don’t know about that, all I know is I’ve lost weight and made money in less than a month. I was not convinced when I started but now I’m a believer! I don’t crave bad foods and I feel MUCH better. Yall keep hatin’while I drive around in my BMW that I don’t pay for!
 myeyesareopen 
You lost weight because you are fasting off a drink.
You spent money and how much do you make an hour after all the time you spend recruiting?
Everyone who loses weight feels better and gets motivated to eat better.
I don’t hate anyone.  I disagree with glorifying a protein shake.
It’s a protein shake, no magical ingredients. Nothing special about it.
What makes you think I care what kind of car you drive?
I like my car, and I don’t feel the need to brag about it.
I like my lifestyle and don’t feel the need to brag about it.
I like my diet and don’t feel the need to brag about it.
I like my toothpaste, shampoo, and other purchases I make, and don’t feel the need to brag about it.
The reason MLM people brag is because their only agenda is to take your money and make you believe you are giving your money for something magical in return.  That is a scam.
 Guest 
My problem with even thinking of being a distributor is the moral argument. Anytime a person cuts calories he/she will lose weight, barring any medical issues. To be a distributor is to sell a product that is not the best it can be for a crazy high cost.  Just as I noted to another poster, compare Vi-Shake ingredients to other like items and you’ll find the Vi-Shake is the lesser of the two, but usually cost more money. I’d rather help my friends and family and even strangers by offering advice that is free on what is the best product than to push one that I know is not the best it can be.
 Ellizzyp 
good for you for catching on so quick.  The best way and longest lasting way to lose weight is to cut calories and exercise.  Good Luck
 Ellizzyp 
They brag because the brainwasher try to make them have a false sense of eliteness that is the way they keep them in their web.
 Ellizzyp 
good for you.  It is nice to meet someone with some principals.
 Ellizzyp 
Read all the post below. You will not be feeling well later. A lot of the weight you have lost is probably from your wallet.  You also will find out the BMW isn’t so free. You can have the BMW and the payments for it. I am not hating anyone. You are the one hating, hating us for popping your bubble. You drive around in your BMW drinking your shakes, two a day for the rest of your life…….how boring…. you must be a ball for your friends..sorry suckers. You will notice in all the positive post they just started.

You are so negative in your comments. I think you need to do some more research on a topic before bad mouthing it. Its kinda funny how if you search in google to find bad info about visalus science your blog is the only one I can find!!!! Do your research! If the company was a scam there would be more negative reviews!
 Elizzyp 
Hulk Hogan would endorse anything that paid him.  He is on TV wanting everybody to rent their furniture too, and we know what a good deal that is………Geeez
 Elizzyp 
This is not the only negative blog it is just that Visalus buts up so many reviews that they flood the web to make it hard to find the negative ones. I wonder why they do that are they maybe hiding something.  I have researched this company back to when they first started. Go read my post true story that is taken from an investigative report which ran about a year after they started.  Everything that they say in the article is true. This is not my blog, I am not this smart, but I am smart enough to know a pyramid scheme that is developed around a worthless shake when I see it.
 Elizzyp 
I am going to give you MLMers a Christmas present. I am going to give you some facts about income taxes. Visalus has been promoting that if you pay your own expenses you some how make money. Here are some facts free of charge.

1. If you are a business you have to get registered as one, there are qualification you must meet of course (see a lawyer). You have to get a Federal employer ID number. You have to let Visalus know that you are a company. INC, or LCD and give them that number.  You do not get a 1099 since businesses don’t. You can take your expenses off your income when filing as a business but have to pay the business tax rate.  If you take any money out of the business than you must give yourself a W2 or a 1099 (because you work for the company) this is of course can also be counted as a expense. If you give a W2 you must withhold the federal, state, local, social security and medicare (also the company has to pay their share). You have to file these withholding returns every quarter. You do not if you furnish yourself a 1099. If you don’t furnish yourself with a 1099 or W2 for money you pay yourself this is called embezzlement.

2. Individual income tax filing if you received a W2 from your business you file as you always do.  If you receive a 1099 from your business you have to pay the taxes the company did not withhold including the company’s part of social security and medicare.

3. If you do not become a company and file a return with the 1099 Visalus sends you.  You can count your business expenses on an itemized statement on the business expenses not reimbursed section.  As with all itemized filing all your itemized expenses including business expenses not reimbursed have to be a certain percentage of your income.  You will also have to pay taxes not taken out by Visalus including the employers part of social security and medicare. On 1099s you will have to pay social security and medicare on full amount stated you earned.

This is for USA taxes not Canada, sorry I don’t know their laws.  Hope this helps.  Merry Christmas or what ever you might celebrate this time of year.  God Bless all

PS If anyone has any questions I will try to help…..

Well, there is such thing as a contractor or a DBA, which doesn’t require a licensed business or EIN. So point 1 doesn’t exactly hold. As a licensed CPA, I would strongly suggest that anyone doing this should set up a business and treat it as a separate entity (but as far as DBA/LLC/contractors, this is rare).

Pt 2–yes, this is true, referred to as self-employment taxes. It costs you 15.4% of pretax income, but half of this is exempt from personal income tax. In reality, this isn’t that big of a deal. Every business with employees pays FICA of 7.8% and the employees pay the same amount. If your self employed, then you still have to pay it, you just owe both the employers and employees side.

Pt 3–your dead wrong here man…sorry.
You can write-down almost any necessary and reasonable business expenses, regardless of whether you receive the 1099 (DBA) or the business does (LLC/corp/etc).

As far as the employers part of the SStax (part of FICA referenced above), its part of being self employed. Almost everyone pays the same amount, 15% on the first 110k worth of income. Does it really matter if you pay half and your company cuts your earning by the same amount and pays it to the government, or if you pay it all? The net amount is the exact same, so not any issue at all…
 Vandenna1 
So, I’m about the biggest skeptic there is about MLM. I am from Grand Rapids, MI, home of Amway and I have seen many people invest alot and get not alot out.

I am not a distributor or even a user of the products, but I am pretty intense in the supplementation process because I don’t believe we get necessary nutrition from common diets (due to excess processing, unnatural growing and unnecessary chemicals). Based on this, I have read many articles (mostly academic/medical literature with controlled and uncontrolled experiments) about supplements and I take a decent number of them on a daily basis (probably 12-15 pills per day). The ingredients that Visalus uses in the anti-aging formula are legit and have been proven to have a variety of health benefits. I will say that I would have increased the level of a few of the ingredients (Vit D3, Q10 and others) in order to comply with suggested levels, but at least they have them included and most people don’t get anywhere near the levels they should be getting! Now–the title anti-aging may be a bit misleading as there is no way to make your body stop aging, but the ingredients in there do have some great health benefits associated with them.I haven’t looked into the shakes yet, but I am planning to in time.
 Ksergent1 
I just love how the people that DON’T know, try to infuence the ones that DO know.  Only take financial advice from those that are in the position that you would like to be in.  Obviously, the haters posting here about Visalus are merely smearing because they are either promoting a competitor company, or not willing to do the work to be successful.  There are a large number of great products and services that are offered by MLM companies.  A product being placed on a Walmart shelf does not make it a great product….
 Elizzyp 
Products offered by MLM companies are usually products of cheap quality because they are just the cover for a pyramid scheme.  They are over priced and cheaply made so that they can support the pyramid scheme. Common sense should tell you to run from these offers.  I just love the way people who DON”T know will not listen to the ones who DO know because they are so delusional they do not want to know the truth. That is called deep brainwashing. It cleans so well it gets ever inch of your common sense.
 Elizzyp 
Our body should get our vitamins from our food if you are worrying about the quality of that food eat unprocessed and organic. There are plenty out there. If you are taking 15-20 pills a day you are certainly pissing your money away (pun intended) and could be injurying yourself. There has been and 18year study that proves that the only supplement that really works is calcium as we age we do need this because our bones require more and most people’s diets are lacking. Calcium does need Vitamin D to help it work.  Or you can just drink alot of Vitamin enriched milk.
 Elizzyp 
1. DBA is saying I am also using this name.  Forming a limit liability compan will protect your personal property if your company is sued.
2. I do not see how you can say it is no big deal to have to pay 7.8% off the top of your earnings if you are self employed  that if you work for a company it pays for you along with unemployment tax on you so that if you get laid off you will have an income. This adds up to a nice bonus or expense if you are self employed.
3. You can count off on your individual filing unreimbursed business expenses as itemized deductions. But if you count them off on your company’s filing you can not count them off on both filings.

Maybe I didn’t make it clear I was trying to warn people that it is not as easy or profitable as Visalus tries to make it sound. It is complicated. I was trying to tell everyone count off all your expenses but be careful and don’t do it twice. To make sure that all your taxes get paid but don’t pay them twice. If you form a company you need to file a company return and also an individual return. That you have to pay your FICA on the whole amount stated on your 1099. I have never heard of any company cutting anyone’s earnings to pay the employer part of their FICA.
Enough said.

I always chuckle when you say people who disagree with you are“haters”…that is not accurate.  You get defensive because we disagree and then call us names.

It is OK for people to have different opinions.

To suggest people that are not sellers are lazy or dumb for not taking part is rude and uncalled for.

It is OK for people NOT to want to take part in an MLM.  There are more people who don’t get involved than people who do, and there are many valid reasons why.  That is why blogs like this are created.

I believe it is wrong to act like you are an instant expert in a product, just because you become a seller.  The purpose of an MLM is the hopes to make money and win prizes.  It is not actually about the product.

A protein shake is nothing magical, no magical ingredients.  Losing weight by drinking a shake is not rocket science, and it is wrong to claim that a shake (even ones sold at Walmart) is the“healthy”way to live….that is misleading to people, especially those who  are desperate.

There is a reason that MLMS and the ones who fall for them make such great fodder for the sitcoms Like King of Queens (Love them) and the Office…They are riddiclous and the ones falling for them are in bad need of some common sense. And a sense of humor…..

You are a CPA, a nutritionist, read medical articles and even a chemist but you have not developed a moral compass. You have not developed the common sense to know a pyramid scheme when you see it.  Gosh….

Just a note to those who post Visalus on their Face Book;  Do you realize how foolish you sound.“Wow I have so much energy since I drank my delicous shake and can’t wait til noon when I can have another delicious receipe.”“You Go Girl”
and etc.  Sounds sdo silly and preteen.  Don’t you realize you are a joke to your friends.  They make fun of you and laugh at you behind your back.

You got roped into Visalus and I am the idiot, uh don’t think so.

ViSalus is making illegal claims in their marketing material. Like saying they have patents. There’s a bunch of applications but no patents awarded. Ryan Blair, the CEO is basically a petty thug, convicted criminal  with a rich step daddy who’s lying to the world about his being a self-made millionaire. The money is ViSalus is from the poor gullible, and often greedy,  people who really think they can make a fortune selling goo to their friends..Then when they get a reality check by the market–they are told it’s their fault by Blair and his lap-dog Nic Sarnicola
 respstu1 
It didn’t take me any time to realize what scam it was after I’d purchased the initial base kit!  I called to cancel my membership and was told it was taken care of…yeah…right!  The phone rep only cancelled my shake kits, but they have charged me $29 a month for each of the 4 months AFTER I cancelled, for an alleged“distributor”fee!  Uhmmm…if I’m not getting any of the products, then how am“distributing”them?  They said my cancellation had to be in writing, and they won’t refund my money, after the the rep told me“she’d taken care of cancelling my membership”!!  I’m calling my credit card company and seeing what I can do to get my $120 back!!

Just imagine all of us picking something we enjoy like our brand of toothpaste, toothbrush, lipstick, bread etc….and then we plaster daily post about it and how great it is.  It is SO SILLY and FUNNY to observe, and I can not believe people actually fall for this crap selling system. Here are some examples replacing visalus with toothpaste: (as it is not rocket science that fasting makes you lose weight, as brushing your teeth often keeps your teeth healthy…no matter what brand of toothbrush or toothpaste, or protein shake or milkshake.

“I just brushed my teeth this morning with my (insert brand name here) toothpaste and wow I feel great and refreshed.  My teeth are so healthy and clean, nothing compares to this toothpaste.”

2 hours later….“I just brushed my teeth again using my (insert brand here) toothpaste and wow, my teeth have never been so clean and shiny.  INBOX ME for more info on how you too can have clean and healthy teeth, oh and make lots of money selling it!!

10 daily posts, x 12 weeks later…..

“I’ve been brushing my teeth 3 times a day using (insert brand here) toothpaste and my teeth have never been cleaner, whiter and my dentist could not believe the improvement since my last visit!  My Dentist told me he would recommend it, so INBOX ME for more details and I’ll tell you all about it”

…..I think it’s quite easy to figure out….

Annoying, unnecessary and pointless.  The agenda of an MLM is to sell something for personal gain…it has nothing to do with helping anyone else.  That is what is wrong, and the MLM sellers sound and act rediculous.  I wish they could see themselves and how much they change over time.

Life continues regardless of what products we use, and who cares! :)
 Saevere007 
Do you think multilevel participants are qualified to judge whether prospective
customers need supplements—or medical care? Even though curative claims
are forbidden by the written policies of each company, the sales process encourages
customers to experiment with self-treatment. It may also promote distrust
of legitimate health professionals and their treatment methods.

Some people would argue that the apparent benefits of“believing”
in the products outweigh the risks involved. Do you think that people need
false beliefs in order to feel healthy or succeed in life? Would you like
to believe that something can help you when in fact it is worthless? Should
our society support an industry that is trying to mislead us? Can’t Americans
do something better with the billion or more dollars being wasted each year
on multilevel
“health”products?

You all are so stupid! It’s not endure, it’s ensure! You should compare the two products and see for yourself. MLM haters are so stupid they don’t realize they are already in one themselves. Go to work! Everyone can’t live the life of their dreams cause I still need someone to cut my grass, wash my cars, and do my po people work. It’s not for everyone but is for a few, and that’s all it takes. While you go to work tomorrow I’ll be in bed. While you go to your job that pays the employers portion of your taxes I’ll be chilling on the beaches of the world. Stay broke, fat, and stupid. I love it!!!!! Thank you MLM for my FREEDOM to live life while the others waste it working at their JOBS!

 RealityCheck 
lol…wow there are some really uneducated people posting on here.  Pretty entertaining.  Oh where to start….I have a very good full time job, I Coach hockey, I volunteer for the heart and stroke foundation, and I’m a member of my local Lion’s Club.  A friend brought Visalus to my attention about 2 months ago.  I did over 40 hours research into Visaus and was very impressed with this company and even more impressed with it’s line of products  I joined up as a Distributor, with no pressure from anyone, just myself.  I started using the product and was amazed after one week at the energy I had everyday.  The focus I had at my full time job…the work that I was able to accomplish because of this.  I had 2 torn rotator cuffs from water skiing last year and after 4 days I was %90 pain free in both shoulders.  I started working out again, now mind you, it didn’t“Cure”my shoulders totally, but it did give my body the nutrition and vitamins to help reduce my pain and  help heal my shoulder faster.  In 45 days I lost 8 lbs, 2.5″’s off my waist and increased my bench press by 45 pounds, not doing anything but having a shake for breakfast…then eating a normal lunch and supper.  I didn’t starve myself…and I work out at home 3 times a week.  I have seen the Visalus products do amazing things for family and friends, it has helped them reach their goals and improve their health in a very short time.. FACT- You get more nutrients and vitamins in one shake then most people consume in a week….so your telling me that it’s NOT going to help people?  I’ve seen Type 2 Diabetes people go off their insulin after 2 months……and they would rather have a shake or two a day then go back on the insulin.  I’ve seen it help with Muscle Gain, with Weight Loss, Energy Gain among many other things.
1 Shake a day costs me about $1.60, it tastes amazing, has over 1000 recipes, which you can bake with it, you can add“REAL FOOD”in with it, the skys the limit what you can do with it.  Tell me any other food out there that you can do that with?…and gives you the amount of nutrients and vitamins at the same time…it’s really a no brainer.  It also saves my family about $150 a month on groceries, so I’m getting healthier, feeling better, have more energy, taking bad weight off and saving money……and people have the nerve to call it a scam??? WOW AGAIN! It’s funny that the same haters on this page wouldn’t think twice to stop at a fast food restaurant and order a greasy hamburger and fries or buy liquor or buy cigarettes…but to put something that’s good for you into your body for less then a cup of coffee a day.  Probably %40-%50 of people out there don’t eat breakfast, which we all know is the  most important part of the day, and your body needs something to eat within an hour of waking up to boost your metabolism.  A very good tasting shake with tons of nutrients and vitamins is a great way to start your day.  You ARE going to feel better, you ARE going to have more energy, you ARE going to lose weight…these are all a given.  The Product is backed by some of the top scientists in North America…so I guess they are wrong too??? Lol..WOWOkay so enough about the product, I could go on forever, but I will trust that anyone that actually might want to try the product, look into the ingredients and let the Science make your mind up…not some uneducated people that have nothing better to do but post lies about a Great Product.Now for the Promoter side of it.  First thing…..NOBODY has to become a promoter to try the product and get healthy.  You can be a customer and use the product, it has a full money back 30 day guarantee.  You DON’T have to sign up for a year, you can just buy it once and make your own decision.  If you are looking for a part time job or residual income it has some great benefits that no other company can offer.  I have challenge parties every week and once people see how great of a product this really is, they order it.  %95 of the Customers that order it see a difference right away…and they continue to be Customers because they know it works, because it saves them money, because it’s convenient to make a 30 second shake in the morning with hardly no clean up and putting more nutrients in their body then they would normally do in a week.  You can’t argue with Science, no matter how hard you try.  Rising Star is an incentive for those that want to work hard.  It entitles you to bonus’s through the weekly enrollers pool, which is a percentage of the company’s profits.  It’s a job, just like any other job….like the lady that sells Avon, like the Insurance Salesman, like the Car salesman, like the factory worker…..like anyone.  Is it a Pyramid???  NO IT IS NOT.  Definition of a Pyramid (which btw is illegal)–A company makes money directly off of the people they they pull into the company.  VISALUS–makes money of the sales of their product.  Simple as that.  Just like Stores do when they sell their products.  Stores make money and the Manufacturer makes money, the warehouse makes money, the delivery company makes money…all these people make money when you go to a store and buy a product.  There are a lot of costs involved in selling a product from a store.  Visalus sells it’s product through distributors(like a store).  We the distributors have to market the product to sell it.  Just like a store has to market products it sells by flyers, coupons etc….A Visalus Distributor does not have the overhead that a store does and Visalus can make more money and help normal people like you and me make money as well by using people as promoters.  Just like the Beer Promoter that goes around to bars and promotes new products.  Same thing.  Every company out there today is the same as far as they all over CEO’s/President just like Visalus.  They all have different levels of management just like Visalus….so a scam? Please…do some more research/homework.Visalus gives you the opportunity to make your money back in the first 7 days, which many have did before.  You don’t invest in the company, the ESS Kit comes with over $600 of products, plus a membership to Success magazine, plus your own site to run your business through, plus eligibility for the Bimmer Club and access to the Enrollers Pool.  The start up cost for the ESS Kit is $499.00.  My first month I made that back, so in reality I just received my money back and have lost nothing at all.  The $29 a month is to run your website, which is the only OVERHEAD you have.  You do have to have $124 in Personal Qualification Value every month to remain active.  They also have the 3 for free option, which is refer 3 friends and your product is free.  Which is pretty easy to do when you see how great this product works and how it changes people’s lives.  It’s NOT a weight loss program…it’s a LIFESTYLE change.So once you have 3 customers with equal to your kit or more, yours is free the next month.  So now not only am I saving money on groceries, but I get my $200 Core Kit free every single month…..but yeah I know, nothing but a scam…lmao.I don’t pressure anyone, I don’t make someone go broke over using the product….I simply tell them what it has done for me….the Science behind it…the fact that it is diabetic safe, good for the heart, safe for pregnant women…is safe for ANYONE to use….for children under 12, they take only 1 Scoop instead of 2.Okay the Bimmer Club issue…..what it really is, is once you hit Regional Director you qualify for the Bimmer Club.  How it works is quite simple.  Once you qualify, Visalus will pay you $600 for life as long as you remain active in the company and as long as you retain Regional Director or above, which should really be no problem doing.  It can be ANY BMW from year 2000 to 2012.  It can be Green, Black or Silver.  You can buy it or lease it whatever you want to do.  Just send a picture of you with your new BMW and a copy of the ownership to Visalus and they will pay you $600 a month as long as you own it and are active in the company.  IF you do NOT want a bimmer, they will give you $300 cash in lieu of the BMW….so again SCAM???? Right….nice try.  So for those of you that don’t want a car, you get an additional $300 cash every month.So in reality, what other company can you work for or new business that you start up that is only a $499 investment (and that’s all in products) with an overhead of only $29 a month(to keep the website operating), free product every month and the opportunity to make thousands of dollars to live your dream and be healthy????? There is only one…and that is Visalus…..and I’ll tell you when I’m done a hockey game and my son wants to go home and make a shake with Visalus shake mix, fresh fruit and milk…..I would rather have that anyday then him wanting to go to a fast food restaurant for a milkshake.  So really in conclusion, most of the facts and accusations on this page are false or are largely inaccurate.  The people posting this stuff are obviously too lazy to research the REAL facts and have an educated post on a new product, rather then hating it because they don’t understand it or haven’t tried it.  I truly hope that you educate yourself a little better next time you post.  I thank Visalus everyday for improving my health and the health of my family and friends……..

You are so far gone you are really sad but of course the I’ve been doing it for 2 months speaks volumes, ever notice that all the people raving about this stuff has only been in it for a short time. The go to the brain washing parties and get all hyped up thenover time it starts to fall apart because it is suppose to.  IT IS A PYRAMID,a pyramid is legal barely. A ponzi scheme is illegal and has no product just the exchange of money.  It is set up to rope people in with the lure of riches, BMWs, cure alls, etc.  My favorite is they get people who have never had a title and has never had the chance at owning a real business and make them think they are getting all that. They think they have become one of the elite.  They bring wash into believing that anyone who questions you are ignorant, haters, and lazy. They want you because you are the one who can get to your friends and families and sell them. No one who has any knowledge of nutrtion knows this stuff is worthless. ( Do your research and read all the postings here). But the cheaply made developed and packaged product is secondary to getting your friends and families roped in to bevcome“distributors”all though on the contract you signed it said you are not an employee, you do not represent this company, you are not asked to sell or to get others to sell, if you have problems with the law we don’t help. They don’t care about anything but to soak you dry.  They don’t care if you are stuck with a car lease or loan, or credit card bills for driving around to parties and meetings, if all your friends hate you and make fun of you. I have researched this all the way back to when it first started. The market get saturated and everyone is a distributor and no one is left to sell to. Have you ever seen a job that your employer disavowed you, you had to pay to get hired, you hyad to pay all the expenses (but you get to claim you are a business owner, you have to pay all taxes and then you get to recruit your competion What really is laughable is when you talk about Sciences just saying it doesn’t make it true boy they wahed all the common sense out of you. You have given me a big laugh but you really talk to someone about your delusion.  And by the way a lot of people who have took this stuff have got sick.  The people I have known even though some of them are trying to  sell still.   Ended up  humilated, in debt, friendless, and sick with less energy than they had started with.  SO Sad.  I hope you come out of this OK but you have drunk an awful like of their kool-aid.  Good Luck.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
That is wonderful news about your health, congratulations!

But…

…An illigal pyramid scheme makes more money from sales of distributorships than actual products…The only reason Visalus is a LEGAL pyramid scheme is because they make the distributors either buy a minimum $125 worth of products per month or sell $200 per month to remain as active distrbutors…that’s why Visalus makes more money from“sales of products”than sales of distributorships; the distributors ARE the customers…just another example of how this company views you as a customer, not an entrepreneur.

Also, Visalus products are not magic bullet cure-all miracle products…there are many comparable products you can purchase locally at a much lower cost, you don’t pay shipping charges and you’re not put on auto-ship.

I follow the P90X Nutrition and Fitness program…this program made me super-sonic fit, healthy and strong. I would recommend it to anyone. Even following just their nutrition guide alone is a major positive lifestyle change. And it’s not sold through a quasi-legal MLM company.

the CEO is featured on CNN money website. One guy called blair out for what he is–A lucky criminal with a rich step-daddy.  Now the MLMers are defending MLM.. when does the brainwashing end!?!? There should be a mental illness classification for people who believe in MLM–and a prison cell for those who run them

Hahahaha funny that someone tried to get me into this scrap and told me the same thing you wrote. About his health improving…. BMW’s and $$$ bla bla bla. You wrote all this long message so you can try again to suck up people into this crap.

No Kool-aid, just changing lives for the better for the ones who want more. Your comments are awesome and shows how little you really know. Please comment again to show some more of your unconscious incompetence.

That’s funny! You would still be in Visalus if you had made some money but obviously you quit. I would say more but typing this has wasted enough of my time…..
 MLM Leader 
I agree, however, in addition to reading books and spending time with people the actions that you take are just as powerful.
 Jkljkj 
The problem with this is that you say try as the operative word. Which means you didn’t give it a try yet you are so quick to judge something that you don’t know anything about.  No one sits there and judges what you do for a living so why are you so quick and ignorant to judge other people around you who are trying only to make a difference in their life and those around them. Just an opinion
 MLM Leader 
Wow! What a goal! You should be proud of……wait, you already are proud of yourself. Congratulations! Ladies and gentlemen, we have yet another person who has set such a huge goal for themselves and is accomplishing it! You have probably stolen someones successful future with your meaningless rant. Keep typing and see how many others you can help!

I can talk to you about the commission structure if you really want to know. I have helped 55 get the car and only promote one company. I make a great income from it and have fun doing it. I closed one of my companies and sold the other and now have no overhead. Love this life!
 MLM Leader 
BLAH BLAH BLAH! OMG! Did you read your long response? You,“those who are successful in an MLM business, whether they’re your upline
or someone way higher who are making a ton of money, have the
personality to be successful at ANY sales job.  They can sell hot tubs,
crayons, or fanny packs, and they’d make a killing off it, just because
they are good at selling anything.  Every company has these superstars.
Don’t think that they are good because of the product they pitch.  They
were born good or they trained to be good and can apply their selling
skills anywhere.”Born good? Really? Trained to be good. Which is it? Either way it sounds like you would agree that they are good at what they do. Their business is just helping others do well also! If they don’t help others they wouldn’t make any $$$$!

My business is 50/50! Don’t know where you get your info from but this month so far we have 1339 customers and 1390 promoters. Did you ever think the reason why you are an ex-distributor is because your facts are messed up. Oh, by the way, Beach Body is a multilevel marketing company that owns the P-90X. Their biggest problem is the company sells against the distributors by having infomercials. So nobody really makes a lot other than the company themselves. Just like any other scamming corporate dream job where the owner makes all the money! You have to be educated before you are an expert!
 MLM Leader 
I congratulate you on your post explaining the truth! You can not change their minds no matter what you say. I have been promoting the challenge for 18 months. Closed one of my businesses and sold the other one I owned last week. I’m ready to rock this new year! I have never had the FREEDOM like I do now. I wish you the best! Sincerely, 1* Amb

This whole article is untrue!!!  I have a friend that picked up her BMW just before Christmas…and she just started with ViSalus in MAY @a7ac9f313ed679655b929f5caceb66ab:disqus f THIS year!!!  It does NOT take you an eternity of ripping people off as they say!!  And it is NOT ripping people off. I personally drink the shakes…and I feel AMAZING!!  So besides the fact that they’re paying me to tell people how amazing I feel, I’m getting healthy!!  I did Simply For Life and told everyone about them too…but they didn’t pay me to do it…nor did Weight Watchers!!  This product works every bit as good as either of those, it’s every bit as healthy…and it’s less than half the work and money!!  It cost me a whole lot more money to do Weight Watchers and Simply For Life, than it cost me to drink two shakes a day.  I have more time to do other thing….AND I’m getting paid to do it.  ViSalus ROCKS!!!!
 LOVE MY SHAKES 
I do that!!  If I love something…I talk about it…daily!!  Only difference is…ViSalus is paying me to talk about it!  THANKS VISALUS!!!
 Contextswitch 
Right–then when their sales ebb–as they always do, they will lose the BMW as they are on the hook for it and it will ruin their credit score and put a huge dent in their financial future.. It only takes a few months of below par sales and you lose it all..  If you want to make a few hundred bucks a month annoying your friends–fine. But this not not a magical cure and the way visalus is selling this stuff, it’s only a matter of time before they get investigated
 love my shakes 
Have you actually tried the product??  If you haven’t…then you don’t have the right to comment by saying it’s crap!!  I’m not a scienctist or a doctor or have any big educations…but I drink the shakes and I feel AMAZING!!  So until you’ve tried it…don’t bash it!
 Love my shakes 
Have you tried the shakes??  It’s not about making money…it’s about being healthy!  I drink the shakes…and I feel amazing!!  I don’t know anything about MLM…all I know is how I feel. I feel just as good drinking these shakes as I did doing the Simply For Life program…and it takes less than half the time and money!!
 Love my shakes 
No one said it was a magical cure…and the Canadian Government has approved for it to be sold in Canada.  As you may or may not know…Canada’s standards are much higher…and they’ve allowed it. If it was being sold on a shelf, no one would have a problem with it.  It appear to me…that the only people that have a problem with it…are people that have a problem with the MLM industry.
 Love my shakes 
Oh…and I know people that have been driving their BMW’s for months and months….and are making even MORE money now, than when they first got it!!
 Love my shakes 
This whole article is so halarious and such a joke…that I’m not even waisting anymore of my precious time reading it!!  I’m going to go make myself a delicious, super healthy shake and spend time with my family as we ring in the New Year!
 Contextswitch 
yeah.. months.. the lease is for years..When the market is saturated and all the groups will start cannibalizing each other.. Or, more people report getting sick from the product.. Or, the company will  get investigated for fraudulent claims..

why should i buy crap from a unbenefited contractor when i can get it cheaper from the company or a cheaper, better alternative from amazon?

This is not a business–the main profit is from getting suckers to become distributors and the BMW is nothing more than a white elephant. If you get sick a miss a few months quota–which is what it is a quota–Do you lose your whole business?..read the fine print.
 Love my shakes 
Obviously you haven’t actually researched ViSalus…or you would know that you don’t have to take the BMW. ViSalus will just simply pay you $300 a month bonus for reaching a qualified volume…as do many retail companies.  Taking the $600 BMW bonus is simply a choice made by the individule.
 Love my shakes 
Remember people…this is simply just a BLOG!!  It’s not a real life creditable article!!  It’s just someone’s personal opinion of a product!!  It has zero standing in the real world!!
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Awesome article by Secret Entourage: MLMs (including Visalus) in a nutshell:

It is no surprise to anyone that unemployment is high and that
opportunities in corporate America are not what they were 5-7 years ago
during our booming economy. What you may not have known is the number of
multi-level marketing (MLM) companies out there that take advantage of
these times to take your money, time, and effort in exchange for a false
promise.

We
did reviews of these scams over the past two years where we covered:
Primerica Scam, 5Linx Scam, Mona Vie Scam and Visalus Scam
throughout our site. Surprisingly they all have significant amount of
comments to go with them showing the 1000’s of delusional people saying
it is a legitimate business while another 1000 scammed people say
otherwise. It truly is comical in nature but yet sad for society.

Today, we are going to break down how to identify such scams and making sure you do not fall for the traps.

Most MLM companies want you to believe that their business is a
legitimate business and will use a few components to create buy-in
(credibility) and get your hard earned dollars.

1. The celebrity or millionaire tie in: Many MLM’s
use celebrities, athletes, and millionaire to prove their business is
legit. Simply put, why would a smart millionaire or even billionaire
endorse a business if it wasn’t a great business. Everybody wants to
make money which is why you are contemplating joining to begin with, but
those with deep pockets are the ones who have made large amounts of
money by allowing companies to use their names, just so that you can
give your money and make those on top even more money. Celebrity tie ins
have been used for years in business and are a great way to get you to
pay up but reality is that those celebrities, regardless of what they
say, are not working at the bottom feeding those on top and have already
been paid a lot more than you will working 80 hrs a week. Be wary as
legitimate businesses DO NOT need to use such strategies to sell
themselves to employees which is the perfect example of how MLM
companies think of you as their customers, not employees.

2. The self employed approach: Every MLM out there
claims that it is an opportunity for you to own your own business but
yet in reality, you work for others. The idea is they cut you checks
which means you are not your own boss, they give you 1099’s which means
you depends on their corporation to pay you, and they expect you to work
certain hours, do certain activities, etc.. The idea here is their lack
of liability on you, so they don’t have to regulate what you do or
don’t do or when you lie and cheat people out of money. They simply
legally can allow to slide by while making money.

3. The disclaimer or disclosures: This our favorite
by far as its entire purpose is to be truthful but yet all it is says is
the exact opposite of anything you have been told by the reps of that
company. The disclosure or disclaimers on all these sites usually will
tell you that you are not employed by that company and that no support
will be provided in any legal matter, even if directly linked to the
product. It also states that most of the reps earn close to nothing in
salaries. Its all in the fine print and they do a great job hiding it on
their site or their paperwork.

4. Pay to join: The majority of MLMs will have some
sort of entry fee or mini purchase amount. Primerica and 5Linx expects
you to pay to join and they do a great job at telling you that this
covers expenses they incur while others like Visalus or MonaVie will
require you to purchase a minimum amount of their products as a starting
point. Both of those models profit them, and despite what they say
about needed licensing fees, etc, consider the following: Primerica’s
top revenue maker is its $99 entry fee and 5Linx’s fees in order to sell
for them contradict their fine print which says that you don’t work for
them. The other system which includes buying a minimum amount of
products actually makes you the company’s base client. When was the last
time you paid to join a job, when was the last time the job required
you to buy what they sell as a minimum to work there. It simply makes no
sense and spells out SCAM.

5. The false promise: Follow the money folks… People
in all those companies claim to make millions and have helped other
make millions but yet have nothing to show for it. They claim they make
money yet drive crappy cars, live in apartments, and best of all will
never reveal their W2 or 1099’s simply because they never made any real
money but rather made less money than a guy working in corporate America
in 5 years. We have asked over a dozen agents from Primerica, 5Linx and
Visalus for some 1099’s and have received nothing in the past 2 years
and yet constantly argue that they make money. Simply pathetic. We even
met a guy at Primerica who claimed to make $30,000 a month and yet wore a
$100 suit, lived in a van and smelled homeless but yet he made $30,000 a
month… WOW… Do you really want to belong to that crow of elite idiots?

These 5 indicators should be enough to keep away from these scams but
perhaps you need more proof that these are a joke. We understand that
many want to believe they are meant for greater than they currently are
doing, and we agree with that, but these MLM scams prey on that idea as
well as those unemployed looking for that big break. If you do decide to
join these scams, just remember that we told you so…

I’m going to make myself a delicious meal of food that I get to chew and swallow and digest!
 guest 
so you get“paid to talk about it”…. that’s your real agenda, that’s my point.

A protein shake is what it is and visalus is nothing to brag about, the same way I don’t brag about the protein shake I buy off the shelf.  Just because I like what I choose to eat/drink does not make me any better than than you or the choices you make.

I am healthy, I used to be overweight, I have kept the weight off for over 12 years. Long term weight loss is only achieved with exercise and calorie reduction, and I am PROUD TO THANK MYSELF.
 guest 
It’s a protein shake, nothing more. No magical ingredients that make it more amazing than other amazing shakes out there.  Of course ingredients are different in each shake because there are laws about that.  Majority of sellers are bullies and act like they are experts on diet and weight loss. That is why it is being called a scam.

You sell this and talk about it for money and prizes and nothing else. You think you cover up your claims by glorifying a simple product and repeating phrases that all of the clan says, which gets annoying and is overkill.

The people who work 24 hours a day promoting may be making some extra money etc, but is it really worth it in the end, when this all comes to an end?
 Bull 
@realitycheck–so are you claiming that having these shakes will get people with type 2 diabetes off of insulin? Wow!!
 Bull 
“The product is backed by some of the top scientists”. As stated by realitycheck.

Is this true?
 guest 
they will tell anyone what they want to hear in order to make a buck…it’s sick!
 Contextswitch 
BEST…MLM…SUMMARY….EVER!!…

Seriously–very well done..
 CS 
true–but it’s still a major selling point to rope in gullible, greedy, people and the details are in the small-print–therefore part of the scam.

Enjoy your manufactured goo..
 Contextswitch 
no.. it’s deceptive marketing
 Lol 
Ya, just look at the diet experts sitting on the BMW’s in that picture in the article. Lol!!!! What a joke!
 Teresa 
Wow, I am shocked and amazed as I read the comments here. I am a Visalus promoter, and I also drink the shakes. It sounds like you all need more information :)  I was probably the biggest skeptic ever,&amp;started with the shakes simply because I had to go gluten free, I am blessed to have started because they aren’t just protein shakes, they are 99% pure, no fillers, food grade&amp;diabetic friendly, lactose free/gluten free. Low sodium, carbs, etc. I have lost 32 lbs&amp;26 inches ~ it’s no scam! On the income side: my investment, which included my personal product was $499, that was 5 months ago, and I have made approximately $4,000 so far just working about 8-10 hours a week.
 Jhth0205 
Yes, it is true. Research it, and you will see. The company is also backed by Blythe, which doesn’t invest in scams.
 Jhth0205 
Not so, my husband and several other folks I know with type II diabetes are off medication!
 Jhth0205 
Sounds like you need more information ~ not just a protein shake. Perfectly balanced, diabetic friendly, lactose free, gluten free food grade shake that has no fillers like the other shakes on the market. Also, very low sodium and other harmful ingredients that other shakes sometimes have. No, it’s not magic, just perfect nutrition that is helping hundreds of thousands of folks lose weight, get fit and live normal lives again. Have you tried it?
 Elizzyp 
How much expense did you have.  What about after taxes. When the over saturation hits than what.  When you can not find anyone who wants to be a“seller”, what then? When all the people who bought into drops out. What then? When you stop starving your self or just get bored with that same old shake every day,then what? What if you have your BMW and you quit selling enough, then what?.  The shakes are incedential what they are really selling is a get quick scheme.  A pyramid schem.
 Elizzyp 
If you call Dr Steidman a top scientist. LOL
 Elizzyp 
Blythe is a scam.  I have researched .  I went back to when it was first started up.  It is a scam.  They get their (distributors) sap to sell their overpriced cheaply made shake to their friends and families. When they run out of saps they move on to new territorties.  I make good money because the product is cheap, they get the (distributors) saps to pay all expenses including the company’s part of taxes.  In their contract they say we are not selling you a distributorship, you are not an employee or representative of the company and we do not provide legal help. In other words they do not take any responsibility or exposure, they just take in the money with no expense or risk. Their job is to keep everyone brainwashed.  You people could just make a record and then everyone just play it, because you all say the same thing.  They keep you brain washed by giving you big titles and a chance at a BMW if you sell enough and keep on selling enough and recruiting enough people. Big titles even if you have to earn it over and over again each month are important to people who have never had one.  My favorite brain wash is they get you to pay all the expense by telling you you are a business owner which also is important to people who would never have the chance to own a real business. All smoke and mirrors til reality sets in and you realize you have nothing, no titles, no business, no friends , but plenty bills.
 Elizzyp 
I hope they are seeing a doctor regularly they could be in danger.  They must not had it very bad.  I heard it cured baldness too. LOL
 Elizzyp 
You have drank to much of their kool-aid have become one of the zombies. You have become one of the members of the cult.  You are the one who really needs to be informed and not by the Visalus puppet masters but by real information. Try reading all the blogs here.
 Elizzyp 
Visalus has zero standing in the real world.
 Elizzyp 
No one in the cult wants to hear the truth.  Hate to tell you your shake is not super healthy and could be dangerous to your health.  Read some of the blogs below.
 Jhth0205 
Wow, sounds like you’ve had some bad experiences! I’ve been promoting the challenge for 5 months now, and I don’t have any bills. I’ve made my investment back over and over, and I’ve had great personal results. The folks I know on the challenge love it! I don’t pay taxes for anyone, we all pay sales tax on the product, that’s it.

You have been brainwashed well.  This shake 2x days how boring. How unhealthy. What happens when you quit drinking them. What happens when your friends and family quits drinking them.  What happens when your expenses get more than you sells.  You’ll go on to another weight loss program and another one after that.  poor thing……….
 Jhth0205 
The only expense I had was $499 for the ESS kit, which included the product I took, myself. There is no tax except sales tax. This company is like any other in that the momentum phase is the best time to become involved. With 71% of Americans being overweight, there is no such thing as over-saturation; however, the market isn’t even expected to slow for the next 8 to 10 years. We’re growing more than 25% monthly, and it is transforming millions of people’s lives and health. There are always people who don’t stick to any program, and it’s their choice, really. There are plenty of people who want to do the challenge. You obviously haven’t tried the shakes or you would know I don’t starve myself. In fact, I’m more healthy now than I have ever been ~ we simply cannot eat the nutrition in one meal that the shakes provide, and I stay completely full as if I ate a regular meal. As a matter of fact, the perfect nutrition satisfies my body so well, the snacks and meals I eat are even smaller portion sizes because my body just doesn’t want all the junk (referring to preservatives&amp;such that is in our food). Well, if you earn a BMW and choose to leave the business, obviously, Visalus will not continue to reward you with the bonus. Do you realize that everything in life is a pyramid? Your current job, the government, church, everything is set up as a pyramid ~ with Visalus, I have the option to work when I want, make the money I want, vacation when I want, and on and on and on . . . do you have that freedom?
 Elizzyp 
I have a problem with MLMs and any other kind of businesses that take advantage of people like you who don’t have the life experience to recognize them for what they are.  Just use your common sense.  I have seen to many families hurt by Visalus.  I did not make this mistake but have made others and no it is easy to get caought up in.
 Jhth0205 
Absolutely! Everyone I know is under the care of his or her own physician. Amazing what perfect nutrition can do for us. Also easy for a skeptic to be flippant, but doctors will explain to you that many folks with diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol can control the illnesses with a proper diet.
 Elizzyp 
The fact that you got caught up in this scam is enough proof of your pre-teen condition.
 Elizzyp 
Now, that is educating. I whole hardly agree. Well said.
 Jhth0205 
Wow, sure hope you’re not that negative about everything. I have read the posts, and sounds like a lot of arm-chair experts have shared input, lol. It’s not for everyone, and it’s not a get rich quick scheme ~ one has to be willing to put the time and effort into this just like anything else. I’m glad God gave me this opportunity, and I applaud anyone who finds his or her niche in this life ~
 Elizzyp 
You have a great imagination. Have the pigs flew yet in your world.
 Elizzyp 
Smart guy good for you
 Elizzyp 
Not being critical but it is your lack of common sense and your lack of  life experience not your lack of education that allowed you to get suckered into this scam.
 Elizzyp 
What I do for a living doesn’t hurt anyone.  I am not required to scam my friends and family.
 Jhth0205 
Take the nutritional info to your physician ~ he/she will explain to you that it is very, very healthy. My expenses will never be greater than my income, because there is no expense to being a promoter. I get my product free, I don’t carry inventory, and if I choose to stop promoting, there is no cost there except what I do to my own income. Nope, not brainwashed, believe me, I did a lot of research prior to promoting. My expectation for the shakes was non-existent, I agreed to try them because I had to go on a gluten-free diet. This has been perfect for me. Hope you have some things in your life that you find joy in . . . you seem to be taking a lot of time in this forum to attack folks who are happy, why is that?

Recuriting your own competition, No control on the amount or quality of the sale force, no territory protection, the company and the good doctor Steidman (who came up with this jewel) all sell it on their web site.  This is a orescription for failure if there ever was one.
 Jhth0205 
I have a problem with anyone who takes advantage of people, and I’m sorry that you know people who have been hurt, but please ask the hard question ~ did Visalus do it to them, or did they quit before they accomplished their goal. The only folks I know who don’t benefit as either a customer or promoter are the ones who quit.
 Brian6116 
This guy writes a blog and thinks it’s been published by the wall street journal. Get a life buddy, if you want nothing to do with Visalus fine by me, that just leaves more people available to me to spread the good word to.
 Elizzyp 
I am sure you need them. The market starts running thin.
 Elizzyp 
Your body is meant to get it nutrition from regular food, if you are afraid of perservatives and such get organic food. If we eat healthy and get exercise we will maintain a healthy body size. Chewing, texture, order are a part of satisfying our appetite.  How can you say this shake provides all your body needs and then turn around and try to sell extra vitamins, appitite suppresants, etc.  Everyone I know who has taken this shake are hungry and start looking for things to throw in it.  You have to pay income taxes and if you are from the USA you have to pay social security and medicare your side and the company’s side.  You have the expense of gas, food, meetings, etc. No the things you mentioned are not pyramids because you don’t have to recruit other people as your job. You have no benefits like vacation paid, sick days, 401K, health care, unemployment benefits, holiday pay, etc.  You can have all that freedom, I like having a pay check that I can depend on and don’t have to scam family and friends for.
 Elizzyp 
If you are from the USA you pay income tax and employee and employer social security and medicare. Everyone I know have ran up bills for gas, food hotel rooms, sign up fees. You have been in only 5 months, your reality check is in the mail. Be careful with this stuff I know several people who has got ill from this.  Soy is not good for you.  It raise your estrogen levels and messes up your thyrod. There is saturation. The company wants you to sell to your family and friends who trust you because no one who pick this product out to buy without have someone close to them pushing it on them.  Mostly what you are selling is the get rich scheme.  When you have run through your family and friends and robably ran them off the company is through with you.  They encourage you to stretch the amount of weight you have lost and the amount of money you have made to hook others.  The reason it is not sold in stores because they do not want any expense or exposure.  They know their product could not compete in the market place with other products on quality and price. Just watch out. I will pray for you and the others that this company has hooked.
 Elizzyp 
If it is very bad it takes more.  Again I ask you as I have many with no answer If this is such perfect nutrition why do you sell vitamins and appitite suppresent, god knows what else.
 Elizzyp 
I don’t think God gave you this. I would look in the other direction.  I think God would want you to scam your family and friends. If this is your niche I am really sorry for you. No kidding.  Your brainwashing is showing. The same old mlm chant you are negative, you are ignorant, you are a dream killer, etc directed toward anyone who might bust your bubble.  They teach this because they don’t want anyone telling you the truth and you escaping their web.
 Elizzyp 
You seem to have just as much time as I do why is that.  I suggest you do your research somewhere that Visalus web site. Where do you get you have no expense. You have to sell a certain amount or buy it yourself or they will drop you.  You have to pay $29 a mopnth for website, you have to get to your challenges parties that takes gas, You have to buy your samples and promtion materials, and I have heard they send them and charges you were you want them or not.  Then they want you to come to their brainwashing meetings which cost plus hotel, transportation, and food.  There are expenses. Plus the taxes already discussed.
 Elizzyp 
And I suppose you do know to get this $600 a month you have to have 3 people under you and sell $12,500 each and every month.  You have to take the lease in your name and if you don’t make the sells then the lease payment is all yours. No exposure for Visalus you aren’t their employee
 Elizzyp 
That is what they want you to believe. But most I know started out with a bang. Then people quit some went in debt to give it a try. Some put to much on credit cards thinking they could rebound in the end they all lost.  After telling people you have this big title and own your own business it is hard to admit it really isn’t so.  They just keep trying to hold on.  It is not fun to watch people self destruct.  Ending up with no customer and no one left under you, credit card bills, and a lease payment.  Some lost their jobs from neglecting them for Visalus.  Lost time with their families. Lost their friends.  Some of this happened to members of my family.  But the worst is the hate they teach them to have for anyone that doesn’t accept Visalus.  Yes it was Visalus. No one could have tried harder than some of them did.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Anyone thinking of joining Visalus should read the following (right from their own Web site)

Note how Visalus says in their distributor terms of agreement that the distributor“did not purchase a business opportunity.”Also, distributors“shall make no claim or inference as to what may be earned. No
guarantees of any income or assurances of any profits or success are
made by ViSalus. Furthermore, any profits or success resulting from
activities as an ID will only be from the sales volume, products or
services offered by ViSalus and any success achieved will be based
solely upon the ID’s efforts, commitment, and skill.”

Another goodie from their terms of agreement:

“I agree that as a VISALUS Distributor, I shall place primary emphasis
upon the sale of Products and Services to non-distributor consumers as a
condition of my receipt of commissions.”

The whole document has a lot of“little”things like the above to consider before joining:

 Jhth0205 
I have plenty of time because I do very well :)   You have been quite misinformed: I do not have to pay $29 for the website, I can choose the free version; I do not have to buy samples and promotional materials, and they do not send them&amp;charge me for them; I am not required to go to any meetings; and when I do a challenge party, it does cost gas, but any job does. I do not pay taxes for anyone but myself, and anyone who knows how to do a business tax return also knows how to take appropriate deductions; therefore, be compensated for mileage or any business related expenses.

lol……yes you pay taxes, just like any other job.  It’s like any other company…what if Kraft Dinner goes out of business?

You miss the point entirely…in order for Visalus to remain a legal pyramid scheme, the majority of sales must be from products, not distributorships. It’s just funny, that all.

They admit that they are not selling you a business opportunity. Doesn’t that tell you anything? Guess not…oh well, go live the“Vi-Life”and have fun calling everyone like an annoying telemarketer  and promoting a product 24 hrs a day for $3 bucks an hour.

So your little distributorship is going to reach all across America…wow…what about all  your competitors…I’m not talking about other companies, I’m talking about other Visalus distributors in your city, in your state, in the surrounding states? Surely you’ll have to compete with them to get sales for your distributorship. This is just one small example of how MLM is doomed by design.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
This is where you are wrong and blinded by their deceptive marketing tactics. Let me try to explain:

In order for a distributor to remain an active distributor, they need to either purchase $125 worth of product, or they need to sell $200 worth of product per month. Don’t you get it? The distributors ARE Visalus’main customers! That’s how“customer”sales are more than“distributor”sales, therefore making Visalus a legal pyramid scheme.
 Lawrence 
Im a trainer, gym manager, former bodybuilder. I have used and sold many different supplements since the early 90s. Visalus supplements are not unique. they can work as many of them can. Mainly because they can get you managing your diet and getting calories under control. Any meal replacement can do that. Im not saying its bad. Better than some not as good as others. My friend approached me to get involved with the company. I looked at the ingredients, and explained to him it wasnt something Id be interested in. Again didnt think it was bad. Could work. Just like many supplements. People are in it to make money. I understand that no problem. I just couldnt be dishonest in presenting it as a unique thing. Its an MLM. If a product came out that was so incredible. It would not be sold through an MLM.
 Laughable 
This product is overhyped by brainwashed people who only want BMW’s. How can I take this product seriously with those women sitting on the BMW’s?
 Laughable 
Please show me something these people studied and wrote about Visalus.
 Lol 
You did write:

“I’ve seen Type 2 diabetes people go off their insulin in 2 months.”

So, you just say that little line?

You do know it is illegal to make medical claims such as:“Visalus reversed Type 2 diabetes”…..

There is nothing in any protein shake that makes a person lose weight, or come off medications, or cause health problems to go away.
People lose weight and get healthy and come off medications from losing weight.
Promoting a product as“the reason”for the above mentioned results”IS A SCAM and FALSE ADVERTISING.
 integrity 
You are making a false claim that this is“perfectly balanced”….wow! A shake does not help anyone.  There are no ingredients in ANY protein shake that help anyone lose weight, get fit or come off medications.  The ONLY reason people become healthy etc are because they EXERCISE and change their BAD eating habits.  Anyone who goes from over eating and being a couch potato to exercising and eating better is going to lose weight, get healthier and feel great.  Making claims that these benefits come from a“product”is FALSE ADVERTISING!

Sellers are programmed to talk about nutrition and what is“not in the shakes”(no preservatives,etc) but then they go party, drink alcohol, brag about eating pizza and still losing weight….lol IT IS A JOKE and their eyes only see dollar signs.  I pass on being snobby and a fake in order to make a buck off scaming people off buying a product that THEY DO NOT NEED.
 Derek 
lol.. this is just another weight loss product guys, not some miracle cure. Losing weight CAN help you to get healthier and come off of many types of meds. Bash all you want, while not unique, this stuff works and is assisting a ton of people in their weight loss goals (thanks for the level head, Lawrence).
 Derek 
So in other words, you aren’t cut out to be an entrepreneur. No harm in that at all as most businesses need employees to run the show..
 Lol 
Now you say“it has been known to reverse type 2 diabetes”.
 Derek 
No but it also doesn’t make you an expert on entrepreneurship, business, direct selling, self-motivation or hard work .. all of which you clearly aren’t.
 Elizzyp 
I am not cut out to be a flunky for a MLM.  I am not cut out to scam my friends and family.  I am not cut out to be so delusional that I think that by selling a useless shake I am a entrepremeur.
 Elizzyp 
You must have visited the web sites or either Dr Steidman or Visalus to come up with this dribble.  Actually Dr Steidman is a ear and throat doctor. He has worked on a herbal treatment for ringing in the ear (Tinnitus).  He is considered a scam artist by the medical community.“Chinese Medicine”Of course you are kidding right.  ummm maybe not.
 Elizzyp 
I wish you people would get some new kool-aid“you haters”is old.  To tell you the truth Visalus is not important enough for me to waste my energy hating. And I certainly don’t hate you.  I am trying to help you to come out of your delusional stupor and save yourself.  I never heard anyone claim a Big Mac was healthy or would cure anything. People who eat them are under no delusion as to what they are doing to their bodies. You people don’t get it.  Our objection is to the way they lie to you and ask you to lie to other people.  Its the decption.
 Derek 
Good for you–keep thinking that way I’m sure it will get you far in life! Now you’d better run along to your job.. heaven forbid you might learn something new here.

If it would help one why not all, oh wait…..You have to go through the brain washing first.  Got Ya.

For something so‘unimportant’to you you seem to be expending an aweful lot of time&amp;energy here‘hating’it. About the only delusional stupor there seems to be on these boards are you and your ilk. Come out of your cloud–the world and all sorts of opportunities await!
 Elizzyp 
In their delusion world probably yes.  But then in their world pigs fly.

About as seriously as you can take this site with all the BMW’s, Maserati’s, Aston’s and Gallardo’s on the right. Oh–and don’t forget to buy one of their‘get rich’books on the way out..
 Elizzyp 
There are many reasons for dropping out.  They cann’t afford it.  They get tried of shakes and want something to chew, with texture and odor. They get tired of dragging out the mixer, milk, shales and all the ingrediants for those wonderful receipes. People stop diets all the time. Maybe they get tired of bugging their friends and family. Maybe it just doesn’t work on them.  What you are trying to sell is a get rich scheme anyway  Try educating yourself go back and read all the blogs here all of them.  Again a pyramid is not illegal if it has a product they are illegal if they don’t have a product.  You do know once you recruit everyone there will be no one left to sell to or for them to sell to. Visales makes money off what they require their“distributors”saps to buy, the sling supplies, the web site, etc.  Honestly would you have bought the product if it had not been attached to the get rich quick scheme and the bimmer.   Didn’t think so.
 Elizzyp 
How many of those people do you think are dumb enough to fall for your line?
 Elizzyp 
No I am sorry to say that is not true.  The people here are trying to help you by making you aware of the trap that they have seen others fall into or have fallen into theirself. We are not haters, negative people, dream killers. They tell you that because they don’t want you to hear the truth.  We are people like you who have either learned the hard way or seen others.  We care.
 Elizzyp 
and in the loss of their money, friends, and self esteem.
 Elizzyp 
Thanks Lawrence for your educated imput but I don’t think they’ll believe you.  They will just say you are a hater, a negative person, a dream killer, lazy……………and the rest that they brainwash them into calling anyone who trys to bust the bubble.
 Elizzyp 
Do you not recognize sarcasm?
 Elizzyp 
I am not hating anything or anybody.  I think you are worth the effort and time.  Yes there are some wonderful opportunities out there that doen’s involve lying and scams your family and friends.  Promise come on out……..

I learn something new everyday and one thing I learnt along time ago is not to be scammed. Hope you learn this lesson, really I do. And I will keep thinking. I have done pretty well in life thank you for asking.

Losing weight causes loss of money, friends and self esteem?

Whatever you’re into I suppose..

Losing money in exchange for a great product might fit (but a lot less than many‘off the shelf’products) and you would have to weigh the‘loss’of your money against what you can gain with the product (like any product–economics 101)

You seem to have a huge issue.. not sure if it’s with entrepreneurs, business owners, businesses, corporates.. whatever. Most of what you’ve been saying on these boards has no grounding in reality to be honest. But I’m sure it’s a huge part of your own reality–whatever that may be..

Let’s see.. the big complaints:

1.“Promoting a product as“the reason”for the above mentioned results”IS A SCAM and FALSE ADVERTISING.”(in regard to coming off of some medications).

While certain real cases have been discussed, the company does not promote the product in this way. Certain distributors may, however. That certainly doesn’t make it the company policy or stance on this issue any more than your ignorant attitude here is a reflection of whatever sorry company you work for. (I feel sorry for them.. I really do)

2.“This product is overhyped by brainwashed people who only want BMW’s.”

This may be true, although I don’t surround myself with these types. Most people I surround myself with are positive about themselves and positive about life–and genuinely want to help people. Perhaps you should change the channel or remove these negative people from your life?

3.“How much expense did you have.”–ahh yes.. expenses.

Very little up-front for most of us. And almost zero moving forward. Much less than almost any traditional brick and mortar business.

4.“What about after taxes.”

Like every responsible citizen, and especially business owner, it’s in our own best interest to manage our tax responsibilities responsibly and accurately. No?

5.“When the over saturation hits than what.”

What over saturation?? This is a consumable product.. get it??
Plus I’m sure I and anybody else active in business would be long retired before‘over saturating’the billions of people on this planet.

6.“When you can not find anyone who wants to be a“seller”, what then?”

Ahh.. the old“What-If”negative hype. A sure sign of a soon-to-be business failure. Once you start panicking you might as well pack your bags.

(Besides, there are plenty of potential customers out there–haven’t you heard that over 70% of North Americans are overweight? Oh yes.. that was mentioned on here before already…I forgot..)

7.“When all the people who bought into drops out.”

Serves you right for selling to a few people and then sitting back and doing nothing (which, unfortunately is the norm). What if Kraft  stopped putting their products on store shelves after the first 5 sales.. would they still be in business today?? Something tells me no..

Selling anything successfully long-term requires a constant stream of prospects and/or clients.  Didn’t you learn that in business school??? Oh ya.. I forgot…

8.“When you stop starving your self or just get bored with that same old shake every day,then what?”

Well contrary to what some shady‘distributor’told you, the challenge certainly doesn’t involve’starving’yourself. Bored of it?? Like anything in life move on. Life is full of choices for those who look for them (and aren’t too afraid to move forward)..

By then those who had the perseverance and self-motivation would have lost their weight anyways so the goal has been achieved.

You do know what perseverance and self-motivation are don’t you?? Two very key ingredients to success at almost anything.. and that applies doubly to being in business.

9.“What if you have your BMW and you quit selling enough, then what?”

Selling enough?? Not sure what you mean here. If you mean quit or give it all up then it’s no different than you quitting your job. Financial difficulties would ensue.
Other than that the minimums to stay active at the automobile bonus level are really quite low.

BTW: I know they probably covered this in business&amp;sales school but I just wanted to remind you that many corporate positions and sales jobs offer vehicle allowances. And most will take them away if you quit or are let go. The biggest difference here is that, as a sales reward, your minimums are extremely low compared to most other sales positions…and there’s no level at which they will let you go.

10.“The shakes are incidental what they are really selling is a get quick scheme.”

Really?? HOLY CRAP BATMAN!! I wasn’t aware of this!!! Please point out where, on the Visalus site, or other literature, it says that I can‘GET RICH QUICK’off of this?? Really!! I need to know as I can use the extra cash NOW!!!!!!

And here I thought all I needed was to put some hard work, time and effort into this darn ole‘Pyramid Thingy’to make it work…

In your own words, I would suggest that you”Try educating yourself”about the realities of being in business–ANY business. Most people aren’t cut out to be in business which is why there is such a high business failure rate in the first 3-5 years.

Then maybe you should work on this warped perspective you seem to have about an industry that you clearly know absolutely nothing about.

But then again, I know you won’t do this. In fact I’m sure the facts I have posted above are well above your level of comprehension.

So you can go back to your frivolous name-calling, bashing and general ignorance…. like a rabid dog over a piece of rotten meat.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
What you fail to realize is that by joining this (or any) MLM, you are not a business owner. You have no control over the products, over the compensation, over the downline, over team calls and staged events, no ownership whatsoever of Visalus, and no control of the market that will eventually oversaturate…so how are you a business owner when you have no control or ownership of your“business”? You’re a sales associate working in a pyramid scheme, it’s really that simple. And Visalus can pull the plug on you if you don’t abide by their terms of agreement…I don’t think that could happen to a real business owner…only the owner can decide their fate in a real business.

I understand that you, and many other distributors here, are emotionally vested in your“business”, and take offence to anyone that doesn’t agree with the MLM model. I was there…I know what it’s like…I worked hard when I was with Visalus…made some money too, but I realized that the amount of time invested just wasn’t worth it. You can’t put a price tag on the time spent with family and friends; time is priceless.

I wish you all the luck.

I am also a brick&amp;mortar business owner–business is not new to me. Being an independent sales person is also being in business and comes with the same responsibilities. It also comes with the same issues that you describe–no control over products, compensation, etc. You either accept it and get on board, or refuse it and look elsewhere. In my brick and mortar business, these are the ONLY options that we offer our independent sales people and account managers. While they are independently contracted professionals (business owners), they have no control whatsoever over the products and either accept what they are selling and the compensation or they are not contracted. The same applies for pretty well any Franchise. You either abide by their rules or they shut you down–there’s no controlling a Franchise product or your costs to head office.

Obviously it didn’t work for you and I understand that and feel for you. Regardless of how you, personally feel about this model it is a valid business model–and pretty well the only one that can get a product the kind of quick exposure across the country at such a low cost, all the while gaining brand loyalty. This is assuming that it is a legitimate product, of course (which this is).

Emotionally vested? Not at all–this is just one path within my overall business plan.

Taking offense to anyone who doesn’t agree?? Not at all–although it does astound me that people can post so many clueless, almost violent opinions about something that they clearly do not understand.

I’m sorry that it did not work out for you–it’s obviously not your thing. Just keep in mind that you didn’t‘make it’because of you–and I don’t mean that as an insult. Sales is hard! You need a tough skin. It is one of the very few careers where you are looked down on because of what you do–and one in which you hear more‘No’s’and negative attitudes than you do the‘Yes’s’. If Sales is your sole income you need a financial buffer (savings) to carry you through the hard times–these truths apply to sales of almost anything. If being in sales was easy you wouldn’t see the kinds of commissions that you do. If Sales was easy everybody would be doing it and compensation would be next to nothing. It is estimated that 80 to 90% of sales people either fail out or barely get by–a staggering figure really–and just goes to show that 80 to 90% of the people who get into any sales position (including a direct sales, network marketing one) really should be doing something else. MLM failure is even higher. When you consider that it attracts a lot of people who would never even consider being in business or getting involved in sales (due, in part, to a get-rich-quick mentality) you can easily see why. While anybody can be trained to sell and operate a successful venture, their success will be based mostly on what’s inside. Their ability to manage their own time, emotions, finances, failures, successes, work load, clients.. the list is endless.. these are what determine their successes.

While this may not be your thing, being in business is mine–regardless of the vehicle. The reality of being in business
means spending time away from your family and friends–my brick
and mortar business can take 14-16 hours of my day at times. This is the
price you pay to have a chance at success in the early days of a new
venture.

Another thing–if you were taught all of the negative things that are being posted here then you truly did have a bad upline. Little to nothing that is being portrayed here as‘the truth’has anything to do with Visalus (or most other MLMs for that matter), its values or how this business should be run. These are coming from specific individuals and not how Visalus is teaching people to grow their business.

I wish you all success in your endeavours–and I truly wish 2012 to be your best year to date!

You notice how the sellers all speak the same robotic language.  It’s all rehersed and they have pre-programmed answers for everything.  I know they get together and compare stories of people who said“no”and then come up with come-backs to be able to have something“clever”to say to the next“no”person.  So not original, and nobody thinks for themselves…they all repeat themselves like robots…oh yah THEY ARE TRAINED and brainwashed…and they wonder why“we”call them zombies.
 integrity 
the“stuff”referring to visalus…has NO special ingredients that cause weight loss, or medical cures.  Weight loss, feeling great and other health benefits come from reducing calories, and exercise.  Claiming these benefits are from a“SHAKE”is rediculous and what makes it a scam.

Think of bottled water.  Water is water, but you can have plastic bottles, glass bottles and different brands, but really it’s all water.

Thank you for posting such a detailed and well thought-out reply.

Even though I may not agree with everything you say, you do make points that make me see it at a different angle. I really respect the fact you own a legit business, that most certainly takes a lot of commitment, work and courage too…and yeah, the MLM thing isn’t for me, sales just isn’t one of those things I enjoy doing.

Thank you for your warm wishes and all the best to you as well in 2012!

Fewer than 1% of sales are made through MLM’s which mostly consists of purchases made by new distributorships paying the price of admission to a business they will soon abandon. The market dynamics are similar to that of legalized gambling but the percentage of winners is much smaller.

Can A person sell a Visalus product at retail? My boss wants me to sell it in our snack shop. $3.50 per“Vi-Shape”shake. I sthis legal? I need to know
 Elizzyp 
Dereck , Dereck, Dereck. Where do I begin, son you have it bad. I will try to be kind. If you have a real true to live business I am glad because you will have something to all back on.  I know a lot of successful salemen.  The ones I know are in sales of indusrial supplies.  They get a paycheck (very good ones) every two weeks, They get vacations, Holidays, sickdays, health Insurance, 401K, their company pays their side of the socisl security, unemployment tax on them.  They furnish them a new car every 60,000 miles that they don’t have to lease in their own name, they are given a credit card that the company pays for repairs, maintanence, gas, tires, etc. They furnish their car insurance.  There are many good sales jobs.  MLM are just not them. The only huge problem that I have are people who pray on others and most the times they are people who can least afford it money or emotional wise.  Yes there are 70% obesity rate or there abouts.  But there is 100% saturation in this market.  Do you realize how many products for weight lost there are.  Look they are everywhere and most are better than Visalus. So why would any of these 70% choose Visalus because their own friends and family approach them with it. And their friends and family wouldn’t tell them wrong. And besides the freind? is telling them they also can get rich and drive a BMW.  The company knows that no one on the open market who would pick their product out of all that is available.  So they use human nature against people to reach their end (make money with as little exposure as they can) So they use the trust your friends and family have for you, otherwise they would not be able to get with in ten feet of them.  They use people without the life experience to know better.  They use the human emotion of greed (money and BMW, to strike down that pesty old guilt feeling they convince that they are helping.  Every one wants to fill apart of something, they want to fill like they are among the elite so they play to the feelings with the ruse that you own a business and big title.  No business I ever knew you had to earn your title and your car allowance every month. But they know you are emotional invested in that title and that car so you will try as hard as you can to keep them it would be so embrassing to have to explain where they went. The company on the other hand if you read your contract doesn’t have anything invested in you. They tell you plainly you did not buy a distribership, you don’t work for them, you don’t sell for them, you are not a representive, you are not asked to sell or ask anyone else to sell. We know that isn’t the truth.  They want no exposure or expense.  They don’t care if you lie, if your friends are mad at you, if your stuck with a lease you cann’t afford.  After all you don’t work for them and if you fail it is your fault. That is why they teach you to automatically judge people who try to save them from their cult as ignorant, negative, haters, dream killers, lazy, just not the business owner type.  They  want to give you illusion of grandor so you will stay in till they suck you dry.  Sorry but you really need to know this.  I will pray for you and hope you have a great free 2012

Derek buddy, really I know I made you mad but being hard hitting seems the only way to get the Visalus people’s attention but it really does seem that you don’t know what you have got in to.  Go back and read your contract carefully, they have the real stuff hidden. Go back and read all of the 1100+ posts here.  Maybe you can see the big picture then. I really do care about you and everyone here. You do know about the $200 a month, the $29 web site, the promotional material and samples ( some sent autoship) The $500 to $1000 up front and all the numbers for BMW and compensation.  Good Luck.  I hope you do what is best for you.

 Stylinbeauty 
This is NOT accurate!!! You actually get your products FREE when you sign 3 people up under you!! So Dont believe all this stuff!! Just try anything you do out for yourself and see for yourself!! You will find ppl who disbelieve anything that isnt making THEM money!! LOL! Have a great Day!!
 Stylinbeauty 
I believe it is. But I would check with your state and local health dept before I did so. As long as you are ok to sell food  You should be fine!!
 Stylinbeauty 
Well I for one am interested in this product because of the fact I have seen the results from friends of mine. If I had a nickle for all the weight loss scams I have been on in my life (instead of paying for them) I would be rich!!!  But Phen/Phen killed ppl!!! So oops that one didnt work and might I add the PHDs sold that thru a PHARMACY!!! You had to pay the Doctor then the pharmacy and then you had to go back to the doctor every 30 days to get another prescription for your pharmacy to fill again and again so everyone else was making money and killing ppl to boot!!   Just an example of our society being BRAIN WASHED into believing if it comes from a doctor its ok to let them suck your bank account dry and sell you drugs that will and have killed many ppl ALL for the sake of losing weight!!   So just a heads up to anyone who may want to try a product that will potentially make you healthier and lose some weight…..well I say go for it. At least with this option you at least have the potential of getting your money back and if you like the way you look afterward…..Cool!
 Stylinbeauty 
sorry but what you are talking about here is the mindless drones our society has made millions into!!  YES we need some drones so dont feel bad. But self employed ppl across this nation do all those things you are talking about every year!  I know because I have been self employed for 18 years. I am my own boss and I have to pay the government all those taxes you are talking about! It is part of being SELF EMPLOYED! But like I said, We still need drones. That is what the govt is trying to make of this whole country with its BRAIN WASHING! I would rather be in charge of how much I pay the govt than just let them rape my paycheck every week!

MLM is NOT a scam. Get your facts straight before you go on a rant. Much of the alleged“information”in this opinion post (not news article) is not accurate or correct.
 Mom2tnj 
Pyramid schemes are not the same as the MLM business model. People like you are the reason the industry, as a whole, has image issues in society. MLM does work.  Just because you were part of the industry does not mean you understand it, especially if you still think it is a“pyramid scheme”which are, of course, illegal. MLM is not illegal.

I am not a Visalus rep, but I don’t appreciate your rhetoric. We are not under communism in this country and we all must make a legal living, whether it be for a MLM company or the standard corporate model (look how well that works with CEO’s raping this country). Like your selling your book for profit. Whp pays shipping when someone thinks it is crap and why the 10 day limit. What if it arrives late or when I am out of town. Are you a scam!  Are you getting paid for writing articles, or a portion of all these ads on the right of the page? Then you have a biased opinion. No product makes everyone happy, every sales person doesn’t make what they feel they are worth. Then by your definition all businesses or companies are scams.
 integrity 
Our complaints here is the scam of glorifying a protein shake and claiming“the shake”causes weight loss, health cures and makes you feel great.  There are no ingredients in any shake that makes a person lose weight, fell great or cure health problems.

Weight loss is caused by calorie restriction and exercise, and those are the only 2 ingredients that give you the great side effects.

It IS scamming people when you tell them what they want to hear and sell them products so that YOU can benefit.  It is the agenda behind it all.  The complaints here are about visalus, which happens to be an MLM business.

Using people who are struggling with weight and/or have low self esteem to make a buck is downright nasty.
 integrity 
Visalus claims are not accurate or correct
 Lawrence 
I thought this article was very fair and impartial. I have 2 friends involved with Visalus . There experience mirrors this article. Both have masters degrees and are sales people. They have been involved in it 2 years , and have yet to make money. They spend lots of time traveling to hotel meetings and trying to sell distributorships. One of them has become completely sucked in and cant talk about anything other than Visalus, and yet is making no money at it. I realize there are people who are. Great for them. I have a cousin who sold AMWAY for years. The approach was exactly the same. MLM companies depend solely on recruiting distributors. Problem is you cannot ultimately control how well they do. Which is where your money comes from.
 integrity 
So because something is free makes it legit? Nothing about this is free. It costs lots of money and time to get a free protein shake….why is so great about that deal?

If I bottle water in a fancy package w/ a fancy label and then talk it up beyond reality, and start my own business and market it like visalus…..I would be doing whatever I had to do, say whatever I had to say, to make my buck….to sell someone my water and convince them that my water is better than their water.  WHO CARES…..it’s crazy….so many gullible people out there.
 Lawrence 
Just to add to this. Weight loss shakes are the oldest and least effective way to lose fat, and maintain lean body mass. Muscle to fat loss is at around 60-40% under perfect diet circumstances. Using shakes have been around since the 60s.

Secondly. When I see the rapid weight results. I know for sure they will gain all back and then some. Your body is dropping lean mass. You will gain the weight back and have a higher fat percentage than when you started. I see this all the time with my Personal training clients.
 Forrest Baumfalk 
It’s obvious you wrote this based on a few pieces of info and little research into the facts. I have been involved in Visalus for one month and have found nothing dubious in their business practice. The company enables people to do as much or as little as they like with no obligations beyond what you would expect of any membership to any organization.
As for the shakes of course they aren’t miracle shakes. What they are however, is a healthy, nutrition packed REPLACEMENT for the garbage that people are normally eating.
Thank you Aaron for pointing out the irony in the writers of this article selling a learn it all book.
If any one has questions about Visalus or their products please feel free to contact me.

how can this be your reply every time you respond…you seem confused…
 integrity 
It’s much easier to replace junk food with healthy food, that way you can actually eat your nutrients.  No need for a shake.  Un-certified people telling other people to replace food with a shake is wrong.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Visalus prefers to be called MLM instead of pyramid scheme…that’s like saying callgirl instead of whore.
 integrity 
the sellers also contradict themselves and sound rediculous when the FIRST brag about how great the shake is by glorifying the ingredients as low sugar, low calorie, low carb…etc and THEN talk about how they ADD fruits, peanutbutter etc to the shakes to make it more satisfying! So basically adding EXTRA calories, EXTRA carbs and EXTRA SUGARS! So really, they end up drinking something completely different than advertised.  This is why EATING HEALTHY FOOD is the only true way to get your nutrients your body craves.
 Adam 
wow…you are an idiot.
 adam 
actually…with Visalus the customer to distributor ratio is 6-1.   I love how people make stuff up to sound smart.
 A.J. 
1. The ranting is rediculous.  Fact defeats Conversation every time.  Copying and pasting bits and pieces of a document that is meant to protect a multi-billion dollar company from illegitimate lawsuits is not fact.
2. A scheme is a scam, Visalus is approved by the National Institute of Health and it offers incentives so that people might choose to buy Visalus instead of another meal replacement.(i think thats advertisement)
3. This entire site is an opinionated, affiliate-based profiting website that makes uneducated and false claims about products so that people who google everything for information will stumble across here and possible click on an ad located on the right.  Profit is made by filtering consumers to other various products/sites through an affiliation process.
4. If a company is SELLING something, I’m assuming that most of its profits will come from the consumption of products.  Visalus is no different.  It offers a consumable as its main product, therefore it makes its profit from the product.  That is common sense.
5. Visalus is a company partly owned (57%) by Blythe Corporation, a multi-billion dollar company that has invested heavily on the success of this company. Visalus is small, but backed by a huge entity in the business world and this usually leads to success. Not to mention that health and wellness has been dubbed the nest Trillion Dollar Industry by many business magazines.
6. The Visalus customer to distributor ration is 6-1. So the comments about the money coming from distributors is false.
7. There is a retention rate of over 97% for those customers that refer 3 people. This is not only the refering customers, but also the customers being referred.
8.  This is not a diet scheme, it is a lifestyle change.  Many people here are right, it is a meal replacement shake that is much like many others.  The only difference is the way it is advertised and the fact that individuals have a support system to stay motivated so that goal achievement is more likely.
9. I am a former Marine, and I joined because of what a recruiter told me.  Although I am extremely grateful and honored to have become a Marine and to have fought for this great nation, I must say that the things he told me were mostly lies.  It is up to an individual to make decisions based off of his/her own opinions and knowledge.  Some distributors from Visalus are dishonest and overbearing, but that is with any business, but choices are made by the ones choosing and not by the individuals attempting persuasion.
10.  My last point makes itself.  Visalus produces results, whether the results are because the product is revolutionary or it is because of the total package offered by the company.  It is extremely healthy (like many other shakes) and it offers guidance and support from friends and family.  I do understand some people freak out about the business aspect of the whole thing, but that is based on a case by case basis and can not be considered in measuring the legitimacy of an entire company.    I, personally, am employed full time in a management position that requires world-wide travel about 6-7 months out of the year.  I make a decent amount of money and I love my job.  I am also a distributor for Visalus.  I don’t make a big profit doing it but it is fun and beneficial to my health.  I also do not invest more than what I make.  Doing so would be silly.
**fact is preferred over conversational idioms every time.  I’m just saying.
 integrity 
you are selling the product, that is why you are being defensive.

you state that“Visalus produces results”.  There are no ingredients in the product that produces results of any kind.  Results are due to calorie restriction.
I hear so much about users having to ADD more ingredients like fruit, peanutbutter etc to their shakes in order to make it more satisfying. (and that only adds extra calories, fat and sugars…so really changes the whole“no preservatives, low carb, low sugar”speal.  PLUS then get sold on the fact they have to also PURCHASE more vitamins and appetite supresants and flavor add ins…..REALLY!!!! ???

This is a pot of crap. Money is the agenda and the only reason people get into this. To claim anything else is a scam.
 Adam 
Defensive? That wasn’t defensive. I don’t have to be defensive, but aparently you feel the need to be aggressive with baseless opinions that prove your ignorance to the subject. People add fruit and peanut butter to a shake that has 90 calories. That must make it a big Mac. Wow, how silly and irresponsible with your words can you be? If you would read my comment with an open mind, you could see my rationalization of the while package making the difference, not the ingredients. I feel bad for you. You seem like a very angry individual. By the way, a pyramid scheme is where people make money off of fees paid by the people who join. That’s not the case here. An MLM is where people make money based off of goods that are sold. You call these people gullible yet the BBB rates visalus with an“A”. You seem like an angry individual with no credibility. I wish you the best of luck out there…. Please forgive any typos, I am on my iPhone.
 integrity 
you came here to defend why you believe in what you do, and we disagree. I’m not at all an angry individual.  I am very credible and have worked in the fitness industry and know first hand many sellers and even have friends who sell.  I hear the truth from them.

There is also a reason why sellers have private chat rooms, because they do not want anyone who disagrees invited to share our opinions.  Yet you are free to come here and share yours.
 integrity 
and a bananna is loaded with carbs and sugar.  My point in mentioning that people end up“adding”things to the shake that is supposed to already be perfect.  It is evidently NOT ENOUGH to just drink the shake as is, because it IS NOT enough as is.  It’s just a protein shake.  FOOD is what our bodies need and learning what food combinations are best is what should be done.  Anyone who is willing to (and has the willpower to) stop eating and basically fast, is ready to take the step in learning proper nutrition.
 integrity 
anytime a“non user/seller”shares their opinion we get told we are angry, ignorant and stupid. How rude is that? It is ok to disagree without name calling.
 Lawrence 
Why doesnt Visalus sell on the open market in health stores like GNC? Because they cant make any real money selling the product! Simple. Not bad or good or indifferent. A supplement is a supplement. EAS supplements made hundreds of millions of dollars on the open market. No hype. Sure Bill Phillips had a weight loss contest, and gave away lambourghinis. But there was no distributorships. The money comes from getting others to get others to get others to sell. Hence the term Multi level Marketing. Im not saying its a scam. There are many large MLM companies. Blythe owns many of them.  But the profit is from getting distributors to buy. I dont know why this is confusing. My friend who sells Visalus was honest about that at least. He didnt want me to use the product. He offered a business oppurtunity to buy in.

Shaklee. Herbalife. many others do the same thing.
 Lawrence 
Just to add. I was approached 3 times this month by Multi level marketing companies who sell health supplements.

There is no thinking to it, it is a pyramid scheme, see the clip from the Office. Pyramid scheme with a product is not illegal (immoral yes) Pyramid scheme without a product (ponzi scheme) are illegal. You don’t have to be a part of the industry to have the common sense to know what it is.
 Elizzyp 
You must be getting your ratio from Visalus recruiters because they are just made up out of the air.

I don’t know I would not want to sell it.  There have been some reports of people getting sick and I know the company will not stand behind you.  On their contract they state they will not help with any law problems.
 Elizzyp 
Yes it is accurate.  Yea you get it free after you have paid to join and keep 3 customer buying them same kit you want.  Put of course you are trying to turn every customer into a distributor and if you succeed than you’ll have to find one to replace them. And of course you have to sell $200 a month to be a distributor. Any month you slip under 3 your get charged for yours.
 Elizzyp 
Sorry but everything that is said here is the truth. I researched this company back to when they first started.  You need to read your contract and compensation schedule very careful.  I would suggest that you go back and read everyone of the 1100+ posts here. Consider it research.
 Lizphillips 
You are so right.  The shakes have come a long way since the 60’s except Visalus and some like them.  I mean they have them now that you don’t have to have a blender, milk, etc you can just take the cap off LOL.
 Izzy 
You said!!!!  I wish all these people could figure this out. Our complaints are not against people who are trying to make abetter life for themselves and their families ( applause your effort)  What we get upset about is the companies like Visalus who use this desire against you and take advantage of you setting you up to fail and to lose friends and families.
 Izzy 
Also you can not control the over saturation when all customers are to come distributors. There is no control over the quanity or quality of the people selling. I have to say that Visalus has some of the best brainwashers in the business.  You know they are could by the rage the sellers go into when anyone tries to wake them up from this trance they put them into.  I saw a blog a girl who got into it when it first started and stayed 4 years and lost $40,000 on the enterprise trying to stay in.  But your friends have lasted longer than anyone I heard about outside of her.

A.J, A.J you Visalus people really must get some new brianwashing, calling people angry, isgnorant, agressive is so yesterday, it has been worn out here. You seem to have some idea what a pyramid scheme is but not the common sense to connect it to Visalus. The BBB will rate anything A even a worthless shake, please don’t expect anyone to be impressed with that BBB was outed years ago as uneffective. We are just trying to save you from this cult that will suck you dry.
 Izzy 
Kudos to you.  Everyone I know who was on the shake got so hungry they were throwing everything but the kitchen sink into them.  When you have to use a spoon it is no longer a shake.
 Izzy 
You are so right, don’t take anything they say personally it is just their brainwashing talking.  The people who deny other people their rights are the first to demand theirs.
 Izzy 
Oh My aren’t you smart!!!!

Another person who has never seen sarcasm. gosh! How could we doubt you, you have been in it a whole month so of course you have seen it all.  You are just starting your brainwashing and seem to be a real good recurit with great possiblities of being one of the zombies.  I have reseaqrched this company back to it’s beginning and I can tell you that everything here is the truth. Quick hint something is wrong when a company requires you to pay to sell their stuff and then you have to recruit your competition.  Everything is based on what you do this month.  Good luck but I would suggest you do some more research outside of Visalus brainwashing a good step would be to read all the 1100+ posts here.

When you take a closer look. It turns out that many of the people holding up 250,000 dollar checks onstage were highly successful mlm marketers from other companies and brought with them up to 10,000 ready distributors already in place. Thats why they got there bmw in the first month. this from what i understand is a legal“gray area”.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Great contribution to the discussion.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Visalus is a legal pyramid scheme because the distributors are the main customers:

In order to remain an active distributor, you need to either buy $125 worth of“personal”product, or sell $200 worth of product to non-distributors per month. That’s how“customer”sales are more than“distributorship”sales, therefore making Visalus a legal pyramid scheme.

First of all you can add healthy peanut butter(poly and mono unsaturated fats Natural peanut butter)  or berries are low on the glycemic index which are naturally good for you!!  It just makes it more of a meal as opposed to just a snack when the product is on its own.  In a perfect world everyone would eat clean fresh well balanced diets everyday but in todays hectic fast paced world no one has time, so i would rather have a healthy fast alternative then skip breakfast or luinch etc.  Thank you for your comments but the shakes do have their place :)

Problem is, Vi-Shape is way overpriced, you have to pay shipping and handling charges, you are put on auto-ship, will end up with more shake than you know what to do with, if you’re in Canada you will pay the exchange, and you are supporting a quasi-legal MLM company.

You can get comparable, even better, protein shakes at your local health food/grocery store at a much better price.

Then don’t skip breakfast or lunch, that’s your problem! Eat! Are we so lazy that we can not take a few minutes to eat? That is why humans have teeth and digestive systems.

exactly.

You don’t have time to eat but you have time to pull out the blender, milk, and what ever you add in and blend it. Clean the blender and put everything back.  OK…….

The fun part I bet is trying to keep the titles and BMW payments coming by selling their quota and keeping their distributors month after month.  Wouldn’t it be weird to work for someone who wouldn’t admit you work for them and you only had your title and benefits for a month at a time, talk about unsettling, I probably would be as mean and vulgar as they are too. No I wouldn’t I would get out of it, like some opf the others have.

I am a ViSalus Distributor and I am pretty shocked to hear how many people can be so negative…..so many people are so blind and brainwashed by so many things.
So, yes $125 a month to remain active by choice theres no commitment you can stop whenever you want…..so I pay $29 for my website includes magazines and stuff, and I get 2 Bags or maybe a bag and some cookies…..Im active, I have 1 shake a day and still eat the“real food”as some of you say lol, Im still feeling so much better than I have in years, and I am not brainwashed, I am more positive about things and dont think about the negative things, there is more positive out of ViSalus than there is Negative, and what is not a pyramid by the way? Everyone works under Pyramids no matter what job you do, top guy is the Government, they can shut you down any time they like, also the ESS Kit $499 is tax returnable, $600 worth of products, you just got for free, which is a meal replacement……so Im not exactly sure what I am being brainwashed about, sounds like a much better deal to me than spending loads of money one health foods with little nutrition and buying drugs from the drug store which dont really work lol.
Im not sure whos more brainwashed….those who think Medical pills and drugs work….or those who take a nutritional shake that seem to do wonders for people……hmmm I just wonder……seeing I make a lot of money….every little work….hang out with a lot of awesome positive people who dont bitch whine or nag about products or other people or other companies or life in gerneral, we actually enjoy life and be positive about life, health and prosperity…..why make something so negative out of that? Brainwashed or not, we are all brainwashed about one thing or another…..thats just life, and I prefer to live it the most positive way I can :-)
ViSalus has done so much for me and I have not been this happy in so long.
Every thing everyone does, sets things in motion, ViSalus is not for everyone but heres a positive note for you all…..ViSalus is moving so great and so well, so many people buying the products, this CREATES more jobs…..and no Im not talking about Distributors, Im talking warehouses, packagers, printers, shippers, truck drivers, mail deliveries, etc etc the list goes on!! As I said more positives than Negatives, and I am sure there is going to be more negative comments about my posts, but thats just how we are, we all have to try to prove one another we are wrong, we are blind, we are“stupid”blah blah blah, I dont care Im just focused on a happy positive living, enough said :-)

Here you go. My mother, who is 61 years old and a vegetarian has been drinking these shakes for many years.  She is on a fixed income and these are easily affordable and purchased at GNC and local nutrituional stores.  The amount of nutrients is more than ViSalus. http://www.spiru-tein.com/products/product_details.asp?productNumber=4580&amp;criteria=keywordSearchResults&amp;category=25&amp;fb_source=message

I was reading that one well known multi level marketer was offered , along with the better people in his company, free BMWs just to get in. Day 1. Without having done any work yet.
 Lawrence 
To each there own. i wouldnt be willing to spend $125 to stay in unless I was doubling or tripling that on a monthly basis. In which case that would be  irrelevant.

My big problem is the fact they bring in marketars from monvie, or other companies. Who already have huge downlines ( thousands of distributors already set up). They stand onstage with there huge checks. The impression given that they started from scratch, and had all this success. Many of these guys already made millions because there downlines were already there. You dont have these resources , nor does anyone else. BUT, you will make them loads of money.

They hold conventions and get everyone cheering and pshyched up, and motivated…….to make them more money. I realize some can make money at this. but they are the very few.
I saw a facebook post from a guy who retired from his full time job because he was now making millions from visalus. I looked him up. Sure enough he was a top network marketer from monovie (another mlm) and got in very early with visalus with a huge downline from his previous business.
All in all I believe people are being led on.

If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck…..Its probably a duck.

Good luck

You make a great point about creating non-distributor jobs (packaging, warehousing, call centre, etc), I never really thought about it that way. You see, this is why I like this blog;

But your analogy about pyramid schemes is completely inaccurate…”pyramid”has nothing to do with how a company sets up their organization charts, it’s the way they operate (recruit! recruit and recruit!!) In my job (a job I love BTW) the money I make certainly does not depend on the performance of the people“below”me, like it does in pyramid schemes. I’m not asked to recruit other workers, and I certainly do not have to pay any fees to work at my job. Nor did my employer ask me to pay a fee to join the company after I was hired. So you see, it has nothing to do with organization charts, but how the business operates.

Here’s the connection between pyramid schemes and MLM:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme#Connection_to_multi-level_marketing

I admire that you are a positive person. The Power of Attraction is real, and that’s great that you love doing what you do. Just know that just because someone doesn’t agree with the MLM model does not make them a negative person. That would be like saying if someone doesn’t believe in a certain religion, they are a negative person.

Best of luck to you SomeonePositive.

I eat 4 times a day with 2 shakes and have lost a lot of weight…hmmmm because i know how to do it correctly, I am also aware that right now someone is making a better protein shake that will be better then Visalus but until that time comes I will enjoy my BMW bonus, my health and the passion I have found in promoting this product, not for the money, but because it works! I am at the 3rd rank in Visalus and happy where I am at, one day it will come to an end but until then i will be thankful for Visalus coming into my life and giving me things I could never afford before, might be for a short time but the time was worth it. I was a skeptic and a friend proved me wrong. I have kept my day job.

Visalus sellers world revolves around a protein shake! They glorify it, and claim it’s the best thing since holy water.  It’s just a protein shake.  There are no special ingredients in it that cause weight loss, or health cures.  AND OBVIOUSLY the shake itself is not as perfect as they claim it to be, since they also try to sell you extra vitamins, flavor add ins, appetite suppressants and countless“recipes”to add stuff to the shake, which entirely changes it’s original form.  A form that is JUST a protein shake.  A healthy lifestyle does not need any protein shake, (healthy food and exercise are the key to that) and if a person wants a protein shake, Visalus is nothing special.

There is nothing“wrong”with the ingredients either, don’t hear something I’m not saying.  Protein shakes are meant to add a little extra to anyones“diet”.  But to preach about it and idolize over it is rediculous and why it gets annoying to others.

Especially when the majority are one day a regular“Joe”, and the next day an instant expert on health and fitness, preaching to others how great they can make another persons life and help their health and make false claims about powder.

A powder that in itself is“ok”and true to be low carb/sugar/calorie…which they all brag about, and then tell you to add sugar, carbs  and calories to it with milks, fruits, chocolate syrup, peanut butter and other PRESERVATIVES!

The only reason visalus is special to a seller is because their only agenda is to hopefully make money, win prizes and form a pyramid with sellers under them.  They talk about visalus like Jesus just came down to the earth and blessed it.  My goodness….it’s so rediculous.

Then when non users/sellers voice their opinions, they feel the need to tell us how stupid WE are.  I am very proud to say that my life does not revolve around a protein shake.  It revolves around my family and real friends, NOT a product.

The time the sellers have to put in to this is outrageous and brings out fake and robotic personalities.
 integrity 
And you let people decide for themselves when they want a product and what product they want.  It sits on your shelf like any product should, and it’s up to the buyer to decide when and why they want it! :) Nice profit!!

Here are a few things I pulled from your post, which was rather foggy with the typical sellers banter (which is not original, as you all repeat the same exact lines….obviously you are not allowed to think for yourselves, you are told what to say to people who disagree)

YOU“people can be so negative, so many people are so blind and brainwashed by so many things.”ME- look in the mirror
YOU“so I pay $29 for my website yes $125 a month to remain active  I get 2 Bags or maybe a bag and some cookies”ME“you spend THAT much for protein powder and cookies! I can make many healthy well balanced meals for that!

YOU“Everyone works under Pyramids no matter what job you do”ME“Wrong…I do not recruit people under me in order to keep my  job.  I get hired and get to leave my job at work and go home and focus on my family after earning my paycheck.  I also get health benefits, free gym membership, dental, vision, payed holidays and vacations…and more.  And I know exactly how much I’m bringing home each week.  I don’t pay my boss anything from my income, they pay me.”

It is so disturbing that unqualified people out their are giving health and nutrition advice! One day they are overweight and unhappy and the next day they have all the answers!  RED FLAG
 Elizzyp 
You nailed it. You described them perfectly.  Good post.
 Elizzyp 
There was a gym owner who posted that he had a couple call and say they wanted to tour his gym and when they got there they tried to get him to sample the shake and wanted to sell them. After looking at the ingrediants and etc. he told them it’s quality wasn’t up to his standards.
 Elizzyp 
Well Said good Post. And I bet at your job your employer doesn’t disavow you, make you pay all your own expenses, and hires other people to compete with you with no thought to the quality or quanity of those they hire. She is also mistaken about the $499 being tax returnable (I don’t even know what she means with that unless she is saying that it can be taken off as and expense, not all of it can. And having it as a expense doen’t mean you get it back. You just pay a small amount less in income taxes my advice get a professional to file your taxes I bet they don’t expect you to take advantage of your family and friends.
 Elizzyp 
When you see some one one with a big fake check, it may just be that a big fake check.  I do know it says on their compensation plan that you will be paid in installments over yars if you get a big bonus.  I don’t know if you quite you even continur to get the installments.
 Elizzyp 
I never heard that all the ones I have seen after a couple of months they end up with the payments their selve which cause naccountable problems You have to sell $12500 with 3 people under you.  If you don’t have those three people under you than you don’t qualify. I can not imagine my car depending on me selling $12500 of some worthless shakes.  At that rate they can well afford to pay you the $600.

They teach them in their brainwashing that they have to be postive were people wont guess how desperate they are. The few jobs they might provide doesn’t make up for all the money they cheat people out of. You might like a blog called Is Visalus a scam wrote by lazymanandmoney
 Elizzyp 
I am sorry but you are not being postive when you are so negative about people who disagree with you.  I have heard this postive attitude before it is part of their brainwashing to get you to not listen to people who are trying to help you. You don’t have to be a negative person not to want to be scammed and see others scammed I am sorry but they do not want you to learn the truth.  I don’t know what they told you about tax deduction (I really don’t know what you meant by saying it tax returnable so you got it free) but you don’t get it free. One thing that bothers me about how they teach people to get so combative with the you are negative (no we are not negative you are at us), you are ignorant ( no we are not most of us have had dealings of this kind or seen it happen we are very well informed about Visalus and they want to keep you ignorant of their dealins, you are dream killers ( no we are not dream killers we are trying to kill what will become a nightmare for you) We are brainwashed ( no we are not brainwashed we are from a very diverse bunch of people with no connection except a desire to try to help people) we are loser of failures (no we are winners because we saved ourselves from the brainwashing and scam).  We are very postive people that is way we spend our time trying to help other people to excape from the cult.  Yes cult, I wish you could hear yourself. Be postive and keep your friends who are tired of being worried with you new obsession. You are around people who are postively conning you. Do some postive for yourself and get out of this scam.

I am making $1000-$2000 a month last month in the slowest month of them all I made $1900………not bad for spending $125 to be active on a product that is Health Canada Approved or I could just spend all that money on Pizza and other crap, I balanced out the money I spent on ordering out at lunch time or whatever else I spent more on that per month than I do for $125 a month for healthy products, but as I said its not for everyone, I dont force or try to change anyones mind, they either do or they dont.
 someone positive 
I got my $499 back in my tax return…..its a business start up…..so you should check your stuff out before you post lol. All jobs are the same if you really look at the business side of things nothing is different from MLM to Being a sales guy in a store….no wait actually there is, you actually get paid a lot more!!! I dont take advantage of anyone, I dont pressure or push anyone to join, they either do or they dont. its not for everyone
 someone positive 
Umm no one tells me what to say by the way….and no job is different from one another if you really look at it with an open mind instead of a closed mind. Take a sales guy for a food supply place….he is a sales guy who makes phone calls takes orders on the laptop from home, does not deal with money or cash or any of the above, he is paid commision and bonuses and so and so forth. I do the exact same thing except its an MLM oh my god its all bad its not right!!!! This job with ViSalus is no different from any other job out there except for the fact you can make a lot more money. And I certainly dont call people who wont sign up or disagree stupid, I only think the ones that are stupid are the ones that have to constantly slam ViSalus claiming they are fake and this and that and making ridiculous comments on false statements completely the opposite of what I am seeing within my company, it just makes me laugh to think some of them know how it works when they are completely clueless, like for example someone would tell me I have to spend $500 a month or I HAVE to do this or that and Im sitting there thinking jeez this guy knows nothing about this company yet making false statements, fair enough for me to say“what an idiot”but anyone who simply says no I am not interested I leave it alone because I know its not for everyone and not everyone will benefit from it or make money from it, just like any job someone tries, they either make it or break it, love it or hate it…..its a job and it works for me. My upline directly above me has been making $15,000 to $25,000 a month, and they have had more free time than someone who has a part time job lol……so as I said its not for everyone.
 someone positive 
ok I have to correct you here, I am not negative towards anyone except those that are trying to bash a complany based on false freaking statements that I know for 100% are false because it works for me Im making great money I am feeling better than I have in 10 years, so why would I want to get out of a company that has done nothing but good for me? its not for everyone but it works for me, and yes I got my $499 back in my tax return it was a business start up expense I am able to write off, so $600 worth of product which is completely covered. Theres no telling me that I am brainwashed because I could say the same about you, you are just as brainwashed as anyone else because you rely on negative and false statements and bashing a company that clearly works. No one has told me what to say or how to do ViSalus I was extremely skeptical at first because I hated the thought of any MLM markets out there but I watched and studied how ViSalus works and tried the product showed my doctor believe me I did my research then I jumped on board and I have not regretted it since, its the best company I have ever worked for, I am sorry you dont believe me but my own health and my own paycheck every month tells me otherwise, if I see any red flags I simply cut myself off theres no choking me on this company. Im making currently close to $2000 a month which is more than my 45 hour a week job a month. Soooo…….. I think Im gonna keep doing this lol
 someone positive 
umm none of us claim we have all the answers we are simply stating we found something that seems to be doing wonders, come check it out…..hell I dont even have all the answers behind it all I know it works…..so that sir is a false statement you just put there!!!! Very misleading
 Me 
pretty hard not to call someone stupid when they have to preach such false statements and misleading stuff they have no clue about….but good job!!! Not
 Me 
Thats exactly what I do with ViSalus the customer and myself along with promoters decide what they want to buy there is no pressure towards anyone whatsoever so once again more misleading B.S about ViSalus……
 Me 
As I said in other posts I am not hating or being negative to someone who disagrees or says no, I am fighting when I see someone trying to mislead others based on false statements and trying to bash ViSalus on false facts and figures and so and so forth, some of the people on here claim they know so much yet as I am doing it, it makes me laugh to see some of the remarks because its 100% false. I simply said its not for everyone, for whatever reason some people are just too closed minded or negative or some just arent a sales type, or a health nut, there is a million different reasons why it doesnt work for some, its not just because of the company, every job is the same, some like it some dont, some make it some dont, a job is a job, if it works for you then awesome, if it doesnt then move on, I hated a few jobs in my past but I came to realize it wasnt the company, it was just not for me, thats why I didnt succeed with past jobs.
ViSalus is certainly working for me and I didnt go into this blindly believe me I fought and argued and did my research and it just clicked for me and I found this does work for me, in less than 5 months I am now making up to $2000 a month at RD and I wasnt even trying that hard I was still skeptical, but now I am seeing exactly how the sales, the health and the business minded people work, and as I said it works for some and it doesnt for others, I just hate it when people bash ViSalus on false misleading statements that to me makes me think“what an idiot”but who cares I move on, there is a lot of idiots out there, and I prefer to just ignore it and be positive. Again not everyone will see my point of view and thats just how we all are. We all have to find something to disagree on and fight the other person, the other person will always think they are more right than you are, you cant win, especially in this“SCAM OF THE MONTH”forum, lol there will be tons of people trying to argue how wrong I am…..oh well it is what it is, just because it is wrong to them and doesnt work for them doesnt mean it wont work for me.
 Me 
Just like“they”teach you how to be lazy and negative and make false claims about desperation lol, no one taught me anything, I dont care if it works or not I have another job I like yet ViSalus has been doing so many wonders for me making me up to $2000 a month in less than 5 months and my uplines are at $20,000 a month and more……sooo desperate? Me? I dont think so I am pretty content where I am at actually but thanks for calling us brainwashed and desperate……………..
 Me 
lol wow…..ummm first of all everyone I know in the business that makes anywhere from $2000 a month up to $30,000 a month left companies like MonaVie and Amway because they went broke, came over to ViSalus with no team…..so again misleading statements that are false…..there is no fake checks, and $125 on products I actually love taking to be active and get paid $2000 a month, I wouldnt complain so to me its obvious you have no idea about how ViSalus works and whos in it, except a few big names that transfered over from MonaVie lol……so as someone in MLM for the first time after years of saying NO to all MLMs I never believed in the MLM markets Im very glad I took the chance with this one…..sorry to hear you dont believe it, I do and thats all that matters, cuz it works for me and Im making $2000 a month……….so………quack quack I must be a duck lol
 Me 
once again as a BMW qualifier you are very misleading and very wrong…..check your facts again
 integrity 
First, notice how the sellers are free and welcome to come to a blog that they know disagree with them, and then“give it to us”, yet they block all their“groups”from us.  That is not playing nice!

You certainly talk like you have all the answers, and there is nothing simple about how you run around in circles trying to hunt down everyone who disagrees with you to tell them off.

There are no ingredients in ANY protein shake that makes anything work towards weight loss, healing sickness or to make you feel good.  If you feel good it’s because you are eating better than you were before and like most people who start eating better, they start working out, and that is what happens to everyone who starts living a healthier lifestyle.  Those are NATURAL benefits, not because of a protein shake.

Of course you are only going to brag about what YOU ARE SELLING, because without suckers you don’t make a buck.  That’s your choice how you want to make your money.  I live an honest living.

You are misleading people by telling them a protein shake will make them feel better.  That is rediculous.
 Cainer70 
If Visalus was the real deal they wouldnt need a pyrimid scheme to promote it. Its funny how these distributors are soo brainwashed…

These are my thoughts on this whole BS

90 day challenge.  Ive been working out and eating right for 5 years. When I say eat right I mean that I weigh my food and keep track of my fats/carbs/protein/calories per day. I personally know people doing this challenge, most of which are women that are looking to lose weight.  They hear about the challenge and think Visalus is the answer to their prayers. Seeing as they have not been active in forever and start this 90 challenge no kidding theyre gonna see some sort of results. Its called exercise and eating right people…. You dont need a shake to look your best or achieve your goals.

There is alot more people have no clue about. Like your BMR….. Does even one visalus rep even know what a Base Metabolic Rate is?

You want to lose weight start by finding out your BMR. You cant lose weight unless your burning more calories than you are eating. Simply put!!!!!

There isnt one bit of information on what is in these shakes or anything…. Its all about marketing.

This punk kid just moved into our place a week ago and he was trying to sell me on this visalus shit….. He doesnt even know the first thing about proper excercise and nutrition.

Why cant you buy this stuff in stores???  Any good product can be found at GNC, Popeyes or any Nutrition Supplement store across the country. Dont be fooled my BS marketing.  Try a 90 day challenge eating right and drinking lots of water. Youll have the same results.
 integrity 
Well said, and yah…they do a 90 day“challenge”every 90 days, lol, and that is only in hopes to catch a newbie.  SO TRUE…EAT healthy, exercise and drink water and you get the same results!
 Cainer70 
You would think that a“health and nurtition company”claiming this 90 day challenge is the best thing ever, you would supply info about the product, maybe a bit on nutrition and health??????

All I learned from their website is to learn how to suck people in to involving themselves in this product. They give sooo much information on how to say things and word things properly so they dont have an opportunity to say no, then use your 2 tools. Then throw in the DVD…..

Come on people are you that naive.

In the amount of time it takes to watch all those BS marketing videos a person could have read some useful information on how to get their own 90 challenge started without visalus.
 Cainer70 
You found something that works wonders????? 99% of Visalus users were not eating properly, nor were they involved in exercising before their 90 day challenge . I wouldnt doubt since they started visalus they have changed their whole diet and are actually exercising nowadays. Pretty much living a whole new lifestyle.

You talk about finding something that is working wonders hey???

You are correct, but it isnt the Visalus I assure you that.
 Lawrence 
They went broke with Monavie and amway??? Gee cant imagine why…And with Visalus became so succsessful? Most of top guys came from monavie….Are they broke now?…DO your research. Why would these Pros be broke? They are master mlm marketers.

When they broke with Visalus. where do they go?
 Lawrence 
sorry. when they GO broke with Visalus. where do they go?

I have. Please provide an answer. This person i spoke to is a very successful mlm marketer. They offered him and his team a bmw. JUST TO JOIN VISALUS. they are not stupid they know he can provide a large downline.

AMWAY is very established company. light years ahead of Visalus.

How many people that you know PERSONALLY make 30,000 a month? How many People You know personally make 20,000 a month? How many people you know personally make 10,000 a month? I dont mean the top people. I mean regular people. Remember we are talking about a very limited line of supplements.
 Lawrence 
I have alot of knowledge of Visalus. I own a gym and personal training business. I also sell and have sold supplements for 20 years. NOone in the gym industry takes visalus supplements seriously. They dont measure up to the real supplements, manufactured by real supplement companies, that I buy from. I am approached all the time by Visalus reps…. I actually feel bad because they dont realize how absurd it is for me to consider carrying there product! Thats why they are an MLM. like shaklee. Herbalife etc. they dont compete in the real market! I sell $ 2000 a month in Gatorade!.
 Lawrence 
how many people in your downline?
 Visalus One Star 
They don’t offer a magic shake. I mean it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out calories in calories out is how the body works. If you take in more than you use you will gain weight. The reverse happens when you take in less calories than you use daily you will start to lose weight. A similar phenomena happens to your checking account when you spend less than what you make, it gets bigger. Meal replacement shakes are a healthy option that’s all! Why does it work? Taking in less calories than you use each day over time makes your body expend saved calories to use as energy. Most diets that people go on when they cut calories they are also cutting nutrition because they don’t know how to eat good nutritious food and prepare it properly or even plan and shop for the food in the first place. Plus, eating“Clean”as some people say can be expensive. Learning to eat properly can take a long time which is why so many people choose fast food! Because people don’t want to learn how to eat bad enough until it’s too late. They are over weight, have high blood pressure and maybe even type 2 diabetics because of their diets. The diets that most people are on cut calories and nutrition. When that happens your body will lose weight however, a lot of the weight you lose is muscle mass. It is easier for your body to burn its own muscle as energy than it is to burn all the saved fat. The Vi-Shake has been formulated so 99% of people can actually use it and lose mostly body fat by being low in calories but high in fiber and nutrients your body needs to sustain its active tissues such as your muscles. It has less than one gram of sugar (diabetic friendly), is lactose free (for those who are intolerant), gluten free (for those who are intolerant), Kosher Certified (for those who are on that specific diet), has 5 grams of fiber, three types of protein (Whey Concentrate, Whey Hydrosalate, and Non GMO Soy), plus a third of what your body needs in Vitamins and minerals including certain prebiotic digestive enzymes that are needed for your body to breakdown and accept the nutrients. Like I said, it’s a healthy option. Not the only option though. People can go learn all about nutrition so they can plan and prepare great meals but not everyone is willing to do that. Most people are looking for the easiest most affordable options in every part of their life wouldn’t you agree? I’m pretty sure that is why the fast food places do so well. You criticize someone who is willing to promote a healthy option to others and over time be able to earn additional income in their house hold by doing so. Would you be less critical if they weren’t getting paid to promote it? You have promoted someones business before right? Like told others about a place that you love to eat, or a movie that you thought was awesome, or recommended a hair stylist? Did you get paid for it? No? It would be cool if you did though right? That’s all network marketing is. Just another option that you can decide to say no to if you want. But, what if it was you that woke up this morning when you were done sleeping, drove your FREE BMW 750 to get your wife flowers and then take her to dinner and a concert later in the evening? That’s the type of life I live everyday because I chose to promote the other option. Maybe the reason why the people you were referring to have lost focus is because they are so excited about this option. Why not them too?

what you make, it gets bigger. Meal replacement shakes are a healthy option
that’s all! Why does it work? Taking in less calories than you use each day
over time makes your body expend saved calories to use as energy. Most diets
that people go on when they cut calories they are also cutting nutrition
because they don’t know how to eat good nutritious food and prepare it properly
or even plan and shop for the food in the first place. Plus, eating
“Clean”as some people say can be expensive. Learning to eat properly
can take a long time which is why so many people choose fast food! Because
people don’t want to learn how to eat bad enough until it’s too late. They are
over weight, have high blood pressure and maybe even type 2 diabetics because
of their diets. The diets that most people are on cut calories and nutrition.
When that happens your body will lose weight however, a lot of the weight you
lose is muscle mass. It is easier for your body to burn its own muscle as
energy than it is to burn all the saved fat. The Vi-Shake has been formulated
so 99% of people can actually use it and lose mostly body fat by being low in
calories but high in fiber and nutrients your body needs to sustain its active
tissues such as your muscles. It has less than one gram of sugar (diabetic
friendly), is lactose free (for those who are intolerant), gluten free (for
those who are intolerant), Kosher Certified (for those who are on that specific
diet), has 5 grams of fiber, three types of protein (Whey Concentrate, Whey
Hydrosalate, and Non GMO Soy), plus a third of what your body needs in Vitamins
and minerals including certain prebiotic digestive enzymes that are needed for
your body to breakdown and accept the nutrients. Like I said, it’s a healthy
option. Not the only option though. People can go learn all about nutrition so
they can plan and prepare great meals but not everyone is willing to do that.
Most people are looking for the easiest most affordable options in every part
of their life wouldn’t you agree? I’m pretty sure that is why the fast food
places do so well. You criticize someone who is willing to promote a healthy
option to others and over time be able to earn additional income in their house
hold by doing so. Would you be less critical if they weren’t getting paid to
promote it? You have promoted someones business before right? Like told others
about a place that you love to eat, or a movie that you thought was awesome, or
recommended a hair stylist? Did you get paid for it? No? It would be cool if
you did though right? That’s all network marketing is. Just another option that
you can decide to say no to if you want. But, what if it was you that woke up
this morning when you were done sleeping, drove your FREE BMW 750 to get your
wife flowers and then take her to dinner and a concert later in the evening?
That’s the type of life I live everyday because I chose to promote the other
option. Maybe the reason why the people you were referring to have lost focus
is because they are so excited about this option. Why not them too?
 MLM Leader 
Wow, people are clueless about network marketing. A career
can be about anything you can dream of. There are actually people that make a
living picking up other peoples dog crap from there back yards! That’s just
lazy! If your idea of being successful is working at a job then great, but
please don’t belittle what people are doing with any network marketing company.
It’s just a different way than you have been taught or believe. Pyramid is the
structure of most companies even non-profit ones. Pyramid Schemes are illegal
and Visalus is not. They don’t offer a magic shake. I mean it doesn’t take a
rocket scientist to figure out calories in calories out is how the body works.
If you take in more than you use you will gain weight. The reverse happens when
you take in less calories than you use daily you will start to lose weight. A
similar phenomena happens to your checking account when you spend less than

The money you make does not depend on the ones below you? Really? You might not be in charge of“the people below you”but someones paycheck is greatly affected by those individuals efforts. Recruit, recruit, recruit! Whatever dude. Sorry that’s all you got out of it. Not your fault. You might not be asked to recruit at your job, must not be the owner huh? Do you have to show up? Glad you love it BTW. LOL.

He does know but you don’t! That makes not only stupid but also unconsciously incompetent. That means you don’t know what you don’t know.
 MLM Leader 
You failed at it we know. Sales just isn’t something you enjoy you stated in an earlier post. We don’t sell it in the first place and that comment that you just made shows me how quickly you gave up. That’s your story dude not everyone’s. My business had 1381 active distributors last month and over 700 customers who are not distributors. That means about 30% or so of my total business is not distributors. But again, that’s just my business, a successful one. Not yours that you quit.
 MLM Leader 
I’m awesome at my….wait….I don’t answer to anyone! Have fun at work, because while you are there I’m at the beaches of the world enjoying the fruits of my duplicated labor! Think about it!

No! A comparable product! Not one that you feed your mommy that has 8 times the sugar, not gluten free, not lactose free, not Kosher certified, only 20% of the fiber, and only one type of protien! She can not get it for free either. I said a comparable product and then we can talk.
 integrity 
you are not“selling”me on anything. You are correct, calories in calories out.  But you are not correct about telling people there are special ingredients in any shake that cause any benefit.  I drink protein shakes for a snack, but I will NEVER drink one that is part of a mlm pyramid scheme.

You are glorifying a protein shake and sound rediculous.

Comparing shakes is like comparing people.  Protein shakes are powder, and all are different due to copyright.  Visalus claims how perfect their ingredients are, and then tell you to also buy extra vitamins, appetite suppresants, flavor mix ins, and then tell you all the extra calories, sugars and carbs to add to the shakes. (which by the way ruins your claim of nutrition facts) And you can add anything to any shake to make it better.

Eat a healthy diet, and drink water, exercise and you get the same results.  There are NO ingredients in any shake that cause weight loss or other health benefits.

Hahaha….this guy says all these MLMs are scams….yet he is still trying to sell something! Hmmm, lets listen to the scam guy…DONT BUY THIS BOOK IT IS A SCAM.  THERE IS NO REAL CONTENT IN IT THAT IS VALUABLE TO YOU!!
 Jimbeammo 
There are plenty of great products that are not sold in stores.  There were also plenty of products sold in stores that were thought to be great and safe but have been found to be bogus or even harmful to one’s body.  Just because you do not like them doesn’t make them a bad or bugus product.  Yes, some companies are not truthful with their advertising or marketing, but that is not the case for EVERY door to door or MLM company out their.  Too many people these days have this‘all or nothing”mentality.  Use your brains people.  Stop letting other peoples opinions rule the way you do things.  Just think how different the world would be if Steve Jobs, the Wright brothers, Albert Einstein, Wilhelm Roentgen, etc,…let the negative and judgmental comments rule the way they thought.  This site is no different then a fanatical MLM site.  Your“leader”on this site is a negative minded entrepreneur who uses the same tactics any MLM company uses.  Attack the“other”guys so you can try to slide in and save the day with a product of your own.  Hilarious, truly hilarious!

 Elizzyp 
No pressure“the customer, myself, and promoters”in my book that is pressure.  I want to go to a store compare all the items I am interested in and make a choise based on quality for price. That is no presure.
 Elizzyp 
I could hardly read your post because of the spacing.  But you sound like another brainwashed mlmer spouting all the lies they teach you. You all say the same thing it is the cult chant.  Part of the brainwashing is overstating your earnings etc. I can not beleive you really expect people to believe your fantasy. If you learn how to shop and prepare healthy food that will last you a life time not a quick fix that ends up back where you sstarted from.  To me it is a moral issue I refuse to use my family and friends.
 Elizzyp 
Hey, if your moral compass lets you lie to and scam your friends and family go for it but you won’t have a lot of friends left.  If you got to count it off as an expense that just saves you some tax money (not much on $500) it doesn’t pay you back the money you have spend. The part that you consume for your personal use is not tax deductable. This is one more of the scams they are pulling on people.  Best Company you ever work for.  Didn’t you read your contract“you are not employed by this company, nor do you represent this compan, nor are you asked to sell this product or asked to get others to sell this product. You have not bouth a distribtorship etc………….This company does not want any connection to you or responsibilty for you or to you.  Your great BMW is bought on your own credit and if you don’t make enough money then the payments are yours too.  You really need to come to earth in the mean time don’t operate any heavy equipment.

Look no one is saying that supplement shakes cant be utilized. But I dont have to go to a pep rally to sell a supplement. Again as I stated before. GNC, other such stores and most health clubs , such as my own would never sell visalus products. I considered it at one time, until I read the ingredients. Its just not a great supplement. If you and others like it more power to you.

This is a separate issue to me than The MLM part of this. Whether a product is good or not is one thing. Selling it in this format is an absolute indication that the focus is to GET OTHER DISTRIBUTORS TO JOIN. Its not about a product.

Furthermore. Visalus for the most part like  any other MLM will get anyone to distribute they can find. When my friend approached me to join, I thought it was the most idiotic thing. HE SELLS HARDEWARE FOR A LIVING. I Have been a trainer and gym owner for decades. What does he know about health and fitness? And how poorly does that reflect on Visalus? For this reason these companies always have an air of illegitimatcy.
 Elizzyp 
That is what all you guys say.  Again you can count as an expense on your return the part of the $500 that was not for your personal use.  This save some tax money but you don’t get it back. Another one of their lies. Asales guy in a store doesn’t have to scam friends and family. They don’t have to recruit their competition, they get benefits, they don’t have to pay the expenses for selling someone elses product. And guess what their employer actually admits they work for them…
 Elizzyp 
And you are the owner. The owner of what a useless shake scam?
 Elizzyp 
5 months golly gee a real old timer here. Calling other people ignorant isn’t postive.  Visalus doen’t think they gave you a job, better check that contract. Some people just aren’t scammer or refuse to take advantage of the trust of their family and friends, Some people have morals and principles (what negative people they are, right in Visalus world.) If you read what we write and say“what an idiot”what do you think we think when you write adown your fantasies.  You say our facts and figures are wrong (which ones?)  I think we have proved our side.
 Lawrence 
Thats what we are trying to do here…Get the visalus people to use there brains, and stop letting other peoples opinions rule the way they do things. We agree!
 Elizzyp 
OH yeah we know how Visalus works…..that’s why we are here.  You will also learn more than you really want to know about Visalus
 Lawrence 
If steve jobs listened to you guys APPLE would be 1 big MLM…I can see it now..IPHONE pep rallys in hotels across the country. 90 day ipod challenges!
 Elizzyp 
Let us know how you are doing in a year.  When you run out friends and family Visalus will be through with you, after all you really don’t work for them, so they say.  Of course they are going to tell you they make the big amounts of money to get you in till they can suck you dry.
 Elizzyp 
Visalus’contract says“you are not employed by the company, you are not a representative, you are not asked to sell or not asked to ask others to sell, you are not buying a distributorship.”In other woeds they don’t care how many or who they are that sell their“product”and if any thing comes up they just say they don’t work for me.  It is about the money not the product.
 Elizzyp 
WHAT IS THAT? Like I want any of Visalus’lies.
 Elizzyp 
Yeah every one I know who sells this gains what ever weight they might lose back = and then go on another 90 dayer.
 Elizzyp 
Again does no one recognize sarcasm?
 Elizzyp 
Please don’t tell me you are trying to compare Steve Jobs, The Wright Brothers, Albert Einstein, and Wilhelm Roentgen to MLMers and the Con men at Visalus I know you are brainwashed and they really clean out your common sense. Talk about telling people what to think. Man you are too delusional. This is no attack but a statement of facts. No one is trying to sell anything……Kind of negative aren’t you.
 Lawrence 
So many things i could say here regarding metabolism, fat loss, lean muscle retention. calorie restriction etc.

But i have to tell you in all seriousness. I know a guy who has a business picking up dog crap. He makes quite a bit of money. More than you can imagine for that kind of work, AND he makes more than anyone I know selling Visalus!
 Elizzyp 
In Dr Steidman’s own words“There could be pyscomatic elements, if you believe that you’re going to feel better and reduce stress, then you propably will.  In other words if I lie to you and tell you you are going to feel great and you beleive it you propably will.  The placebo effect.
 Elizzyp 
I can hardly make any sense out of this because of the spacing.  But it seems to be you are spoting the same old chant all the cult does.
 Elizzyp 
I am a numbers person but you said you make $1000-$2000 a month and the slowest month you made $1900 so wouldn’t you be making $1900-$2000 a month assuming your best month was $2000. Less of course the $125, gas samples, promotional tools, website,etc.  Divide by the amount of hours you put in on the telephone, having parties, going to meetings,going places to run in to people to try to sell, etc.  Pestering your friends and family priceless.
 Elizzyp 
I have never heard of that but maybe for someone that experienced with that many downlines.
 Elizzyp 
Reda all the post here.  They have talked about this beforemReading all the 1200+ post are worth the time
 Lawrence 
Multi level marketing companies are legal pyramid schemes. They remain legal because the distributors buy enough product to keep it legal. Ive been doing some research on MLM. Also on other types of marketing companies. Many of the top MLM people are NOT getting involved with visalus. Even though they are being heavily recruited. The reason they are giving is that they consider some of visalus practices to be on the shady side. They believe visalus rapid growth is a RED FLAG and a sign of a quick saturation point and crash.

Another MLM marketer also pointed out that visalus runs questionable comparisons with other supplements. IE. in a comparison visalus claimed to have lower calories, lower fat, and lower carbs. But did not mention the other companies supplement mixes with water, adding no calories. while visalus’s product was to be mixed with milk.
 Lawrence 
Yea they were offered BMWs Just to join. These guys were top marketers. He ended up saying no.
 Lawrence 
Gotcha. thanks I will.
 Lawrence 
This is a perfect description of visalus absurdity. But you left out how you would go to a huge meeting at a Marriot, and show everyone your teeth. lol….lol…….That is a great post!
 Lawrence 
MLM LEADER. IF this is so true…why are you here?
 Lawrence 
Its funny to me that visalus claims there product is better because its gluten free , kosher, and low sugar. SO WHAT. Unless you have an allergy to gluten- irrelevant. Kosher isnt related to the types of ingredients that make adiffernce with fat loss. virtually all supplements are low to no sugar. Even this is largely irrelevant. Its a protein shake. If you want my professional opinion. I would ditch the soy. up the whey protein. and quite honestly I would increase the calories.
 Lawrence 
357 per hour? So you work 2 hours a week?
 me 
wow ok you really are not all up there are you lol it was christmas time so I didnt spend much time on business and I made $1900 the most I have made up to date and that was last month and this month is looking to double that…….so instead of sounding like a fucktard on every comment you really should do some more research you really make yourself sound like an idiot….sure I am a“rude seller”and I am very unsuccessfull and losing all my friends lol…..you are soooooooo wayyyyy off base!!!!! Everything I read on your comments on here are completely the opposite, but hey to each their own, this site is just dedicated to bashing a great company, thats all it is, you guys live life coming on here to be a negative fucktards lol theres really no point in me coming in here reading most of the retarded fucked up false statements ever lol.
Spin it how ever you want, you will never be right PEACE
 Me 
wow I have never seen so many goddamn fucktards in a blog before, there truly is a lot of goddamn idiots in here who think they know everything but Im sitting back here laughing my ass off as you all make so many false statements about ViSalus, no matter what proof I provide, gym owners, doctors, it really doesnt matter to you guys, or even my friends that are making well over $30,000 a month……….sad to see such morons have to sit here on there ass bashing ViSalus all day, this site is a goddamn joke, useless waste of time for a bunch of no good losers who cant handle MLM companies, have a nice life bashing MLMs all day losers lol never coming back here again so save your breath, pointless fucking website!!!

What a rude person with foul language.  Certainly speaks wonders.  Really shows the type of person who is selling the crap!

We don’t need YOU to prove anything.  We already know exactyly what this mlm is about.

Anyone is welcome to post their opinions here, yet all visalus blogs are blocked, because they can’t handle hearing anyones opinion but their own.  Everyones opinion matters, but opinions are not fact.
 http://pulse.yahoo.com/_YX63DD3MKPHRUOUVU6VVD4NBLQ EricM 
I just have to say this…being a coach and mentor for business owners and  entrepreneurs in both Small/Medium and Home Based business…the only time you run into a site like this without any insight is because this person has been blinded by their own faults and failures. If their is a scheme here it’s written to use SEO to bring people to this site to bring innocent people looking for good information on Visalus to this page. Instead you get this negative write up and a pitch to buy his book making this the perfect capture site for those on rocky thinking paths. There is a split between the poor and wealthy and that split is always choice. Take a choice to follow or become a leader. Make a choice to either learn from leaders or follow those that will drag you down. This post could have been written positive and still given the same effect to capture peoples information to make money. People need guidance and not pity and when you write a post like this, you send the people who are looking for freedom back to the JOB–Just Over Broke. Forcing them to not chase a dream but to keep on living month over month, with less money than month. Being that I was from a poor family, in a gang and did my time, I learned allot about people. What is in the heart of a man that would write a post that has not other reason behind it but to trick the SEO so that he can make money selling his book.
 Lawrence 
The defensiveness from VI-people is astonishing. This is probably the only blog I have found that offered a different opinion on Visalus. I typed in Visalus scam originally. This sends you automatically to endless pro vi sites. So there is one blog that offers a different angle. And all you successful Visalus people come here and whine? Why are you here? Maybe Im just selfish. But If I was happy with my company, making huge money! I wouldnt spend a minute here trying to make my case to others…..

So. How well are you guys REALLY doing?
 Lawrence 
ARE THERE ANY VI people .OUT THERE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK WITHOUT USING TH F BOMB? Are all of you 20 years old?

One thing Im sure of . You are not being honest. someone with your communication skills cant be making any money.

We disagree with you.  Why are you even on a blog that you know does not agree with you? You have your own agendas obviously. We are not interested.

You have your blogs to chat in, and block people who disagree.  Our opinions are just as important as yours.

Protein shake sellers are not leaders!

Yah, you have to be a seller/buyer in order to be invited in“their groups”.  They can’t handle hearing other voices but their own.  They only know how to answer questions instead of ask them! :)

You said it best. Take a choice to follow or be a leader. Im not following.

Tell me why the only information that is on their website is ALLLLLLL about marketing and how to put on these parties and the right questions and all that stuff that has NOTHING to do with losing weight or any valuable information about nutrition…..

I can only assume that this whole paragraph you got goin on here is nothing more than something that visalus has provided to rebuttle any non believers….

Im looking at the BMW program guidelines right now….

Once your done with Visalus your own your own with the BMW dummy!!!

Please be aware of the following important points regarding your participation in this program.
o The contract you execute will be between you and the Dealership/BMW Financial. o ViSalus Sciences’ obligation is to award your monthly bonuses to you based on program rules if and when you take delivery of your car and sign and return the attached signature
page, fully executed. o ViSalus Sciences will not offer advice to you regarding your ability to honor a lease contract
or with respect to the terms of any lease. This agreement is strictly between you and the seller/lessor.

I don’t beleive your issue really stems around ViSalus.  It is VERY obvious that you have some rather serious issue that either are or have taken place in your life to make you belittle yourself and use a public platform to vent your rage.  I’m sorry for whatever has brought you to such a point in life that you would honestly show your character at this level.  I hope the best for you, I hope you get the help you need.
 bloggersheaven 
Your vision of a“caring person”must be seen through fogged glasses.  How are you caring about anyone by name calling bc someone decided to choose mlm as their job?  How does this make you the smarter or more educated of the group?  I have a bachelors in business as well as being certified as a preventative dental assistant…am I better then you?  I have not called you names, i have not tried to make you feel less deserving then you are, I have simply tried to point out that the“losers”you are pointing at could really be your own reflection.
I have doneextensive research on ViSalus and will say this….the facts that were given in this blog were NOT true to what I read with my own eyes.  I believe that the code of ethics need to be used if you make the decision to become a blogger.  Missed the boat on that one here!  I am a professional blogger who makes it my mission to provide HONEST facts, keeping a neutral stand point on both sides of the coin.
I think you take a lot from even a little verified information!
 Elizzyp 
You are atypical MLMer.  I am from a poor family also. That jusat made me smarter about scams.  Because these scam always go after the ones who can least afford it.  As for being a leader……Come on they use the nobody has ever made you feel important so I will were you will fall under my spell and sell my worthless shake. It is the illusion of grandur.  The are using and crashing your dreams.  I don’t wonder about some who would write this article intentions because it is all true.  Don’t you understand sarcasm. What I wonder about is what is in the heart of some one who would scam their frinds and family for a buck.
 Elizzyp 
I suspect they have their own doubts then we they see them confirmed they go crazy.  Such vulgar people no wonder Visalus doesn’t want to claim them as employees. But they will take their money.
 Elizzyp 
The also have what is called the white papers which are nonsensical“science”reports that says nothing about Visalus but they flood their web site with them claim they prove visalus is the greatest. They even went so far as to sign different doctors names to a report that did not have anything to do with it.  They called them out on the forgeries. This I got form lazymandmoney is visalus a scam?
 Elizzyp 
You talk like that and I am the idiot.  I would suggest that you try to enlarge your vocabulary.  I must not be to off base if you go this balisic. Look how negative you are being and you being such a positive person and all.  You are showing the mental capacity, morals, emotional stability of the people that are attracted to Visalus.
 Elizzyp 
I maybe stupid but it doesn’t take a genius not to get mixed up with a company that does not stand behind it’s sellers or product.
 Elizzyp 
No, OH Brilliant one, on the office sitcom they connect the dots to show you how there is a pyramid. I did not say anything about what was legal in connection to the sitcom but I would rather go there than Visalus. The crediability factor.
 Elizzyp 
Oh How brilliant you are. WHAT did you just say. I am beginning to think you are the one who doesn’t know anything.
 Elizzyp 
If your moral compass allows you to proceed that way go for it. But I would never scam my friends and family for a buck.
 Elizzyp 
You are sad.  They have really cleaned your brain of all it’s common sense.  Just because you could not make it in the real world does not mean the rest of who don’t want to sczam our friends and families appreciate the benefits of having and succeed in a job. We like the security of knowing what we are going to get every pay check, that we have health insurance, 401K, vacations, holidays, and sick days.  That our employer pays employment taxes on us so that if we do lose our job we will be able to depend on something. We appreciate the fact they pay their share of our SS and medicare for our future.  That they are proud of us as employees and stand behind us. If that makes me a drone than I’ll take it over being a lazy mlm flunky any day. I love my country and the government.

I am a visalus promoter, and was introduced to it by my cousin.  In only three months he attained the Regional Director and received his 600$ monthly allowance for his BMW.  A couple months down the road, he has made it another 2 levels and is far beyond the requirements to continue to receiving his bonus for the car.  I dont know who wrote this story, but it seems to me they need to talk to someone who is part of the business because everything in this article has been tweaked to make Visalus seem like such a bad company.

The reason our products are not on the store shelves is simple.  Instead of paying for advertisement and this or that to sell our product, we let you do it, the consumer, and pay you for doing it.  Also, when a product sits on a shelf in a store, you cant ask the person selling it all sorts of questions.  With this set up, we introduce it to you, let you try it.  Tell you about other people that have been on it, the reasons they didnt succeed (which every time is due to them cheeting on their own plan and not fessing up to it) and we tell you what other peoples success stories.

The most beautiful thing about this company is that everyone involved is there to help each other.  We cant get anywhere without reaching down and pulling new people up, so we arent going to just sign you up and forget about you if you want to be a promoter.  We sign you up, and help you to attain your goals on the business side, and on your personal health goals.  If you join you will find that everyone involved is here to help you, and there is a great community built of great people in this company.  The people i work with I consider my vi-family, not just co-workers or co-promoters.

Wow! What a hateful negative place to be, I won’t be coming back.
 Lawrence 
The reason its not on store shelves is because the company makes money by selling distributorships. I challenge any of you to only sell the product outright. Do not bring any others in under you. Tell me how you do.  You wont make enough for a BMW. Probably wouldnt break even.

any takers?
 integrity 
Yes, you are a visalus promoter, that is obvious.  We don’t expect you to do anything but promote what you are doing.  We disagree with what you are doing.

Your“community”is only about helping yourself, and downing us who disagree.

When we disagree, you all feel the need to write a book about what you do, when we already know what you do and we already understand what it is about.

Sellers glorify a protein powder, their lives revolve around a protein powder, and a protein powder is nothing special.

What ingredients cause weight loss.  What ingredients cause health benefits and medical cures.  What ingredients make you“feel great”.

Sellers become instant experts on health and nutrition and that is scary.  I know many overweight sellers who stay overweight and continue to say how healthy they are.  I know many people who use old“before”pictures and a current picture then claim how visalus made them look the way they do now.  I know many sellers who claim to lose tons of weight, but they are not and if they do lose weight it is because they made a drastic change in their junky diets.  The weight will eventually come back on.

Visalus is scamming people on making them spend money on something they don’t need.  Using the charm of“community, friends and fortune”as a fishing line.
 integrity 
That is exactly it!
 Saevere007 
The fact that few people need this product or
service and few people are presently buying similar products available in the
market even at lower prices is ignored. Who buys $200 worth of shake mix a month?
 integrity 
And the fact that the sellers mostly talk about bmw’s and prizes, really tells us what they really care about, because I have never heard of bragging about protein powder before lol…scam scam scam

Thank you, Lawrence!  We have a fitness store and sell a few supplement lines that are appropriate for our market.  Like you, I have customers approaching me to sell Visalus for them.  Like you, I read the ingredients and concluded that the lines we currently carry are better for our needs.  Every“no, thank you”reply I’ve had has been met with some of the same arguments/comments the believers are citing here.  They sure try to make it hard to say“no”, as if I was perhaps uninformed or really didn’t get it.  I feel bad, too, having to say“no”to a friend.  They took it so personal, I have to wonder if our relationship has changed.  And, like you, I really felt that they don’t see if from my perspective.  I refuse to feel guilty for running my business, partly because I’m almost feeling that my choice to say“no”isn’t being respected.  I’ve really had enough of it all.

I just happened to stumble onto this site and feel like there are so many people on both sides filled with anger. I have met people who own there own business, work for companies, both large and small. I happen to even know MLM folks. We live in the greatest country in the world, freedom of choice to do and pursue anything we want. Do what makes you happy, do what makes you money but for goodness sake don’t piggy back on another company to sell your product. If your product is of value work your butt off and market it, sell it, and help others through it. Don’t look for an easy route because if your going to be successful there is no easy route you have to work, work, work, and then work some more. I am into personal growth books and audio, and if Stay Poor is about that maybe I will read it. Before I go, I wanted to say I was approached by a promoter in visalus and the person who approached me never said anything about a BMW, Money, or shakes. All he did was state that he was on a 90 day challenge and wanted to see if I would be interested in joining him. I got the call yesterday, now that I know what great possibilities can be achieved I think I will have to do the challenge. In a weird sort of way I would like to thank whoever runs this site because you have helped me see what wonderful opportunities even I could obtain. Remember everyone we get one chance to live, make it your best and understand there is no greater joy then helping others and expecting nothing back.
 Positivepete 
Integrity, I like the part where you don’t pay your boss…Let’s see if you don’t work there what is the company missing? If the job you do helps out a sales person in the company then you are in the equation to helping the company make money. You don’t do your job, the sales person can’t do his job, the product doesn’t get sold and therefore the company starts to lose money. How does a comp[any pay it’s employees by selling a product or service. I don’t care if your the janitor, everyone in your company contributes to the end result. This was an example because I have no idea what you do for a living.

Believe it or not, there are people besides the executives of these companies that actually make their living with MLM schemes.. Regardless of the effectiveness of the product, the marketing, the business plan, people are going to buy into it for their own reasons.  Some do it for the product.  Some do it thinking they could be successful in the marketing side of it.  And even still, others do it because they were genuinely convinced to do so by promoters using manipulative sales techniques so they can continue to get their $600 monthly BMW stipend.

As it is with EVERY MLM, there are people who are *actually* successful.  But generally speaking, they either have many, MANY years of sales experience, literally thousands of established contacts, a means to continue expanding their network—oh, and they probably don’t have a typical day job, if they have one at all.

MLM’s like Visalus, MonaVie, and even Avon and Mary Kay, although the last two have“moved past that level”, prey upon people who do not understand the effort it takes to make money with these companies or are susceptible to this type of marketing.  These people could be your friends, your parents, your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.  If they’ve got years of sales experience, an established cash flow, and a promoter’s attitude, they will likely find some success in it.  But if that just isn’t them, sit down and have a kind but serious talk about the potential losses if they choose to fully buy in.

My dad got into this and unfortunately decided to buy into it as a promoter.  Never did anything with it, of course, but thankfully he is very financially stable and later admitted that buying in was his own little midlife crisis! That being said, I’ve gotten a few free bags of shake mix that he had left over and.. in my honest opinion, it’s pretty tasty.  Not $50 tasty—but tasty nonetheless.
 Lawrence 
Very well Put.

im highly allergic to peanuts and shellfish. are these shakes safe for me to consume?
 UpstateNYCheerCoach 
I am a big skeptic of MLMs. A lot are bad but some are really good. To Generalize Visalus is akin to generalizing all blacks as being ghetto, uneducated hoodlums or Mexicans being non- working scumbags who just suck of the system.
It’s really idiotic and shows how bitter and miserable some people are.
I would rather buy from a good MLM than to shop at Wal-mart. At least the money is staying here.
 Readyforthechallenge.net 
Hey, just caught your post, go to readyforthechallenge.myvi.net. Go to the“Products”tab at the top. There are PDF files at the bottom you can print off and take to your doctor to see if he would reccommend them. There are NO PEANUTS OR SHELLFISH in them UNLESS YOU ADD IT TO THE SHAKE. Go and check it out. I’ve lost 10 pounds since the first of January, and have TONS of energy! It’s awesome!
 UpstateNYCheerCoach 
Once again you should research your facts. Actually the price of the vi shakes are the same as the crap you find in stores ( Slim fast, Special K, Muscle Milk). However, this is far more healtheir for you and not loaded with sugars and chemicals. For 2 bags a month it is $99. Which if you do 1 or 2 shakes a day, you are actually saving money.
 ReadyForTheChallenge.Net 
Hahaha, this guy is ridiculous! He obviously doesn’t know what MLM is. OF COURSE you have to maintain monthly stats! Just like for people to sponsor THIS website, he has to have so many people come to this website to keep those sponsors. Is you think this is a scam, look at the facts! 72 MILLION shakes have been sold, 3 MILLION pounds lost, 400 NEW 5 figure a month earners(a lot of them have never been in MLM before) 35 BMW bonuses given away EVERYDAY! The reason people put a big emphasis on the money side is that it’s a business! I am friends with over 100 people from ViSalus on Facebook, and I see more posts about the health benefits and health results than I do about the money! And I’m friends with a lot of the top income earners(on facebook)! Facts beat conversation. I wasn’t even interested in ViSalus at first. But then I saw how the products are changing so many peoples lives, and I wanted to be apart of something SO MUCH BIGGER than me. So I signed up as a promoter. One of the best decisions I’ve ever made! If you want to check it out, go to http://www.readyforthechallenge.net You won’t regret it.

“The Most Expensive Thing You Can Own Is A Closed Mind. The Person Who Says It Can’t Be Done Should Not Interupt The One Doing It.”

Whether you look at it or not. It doesn’t effect me at all. But don’t take someone’s information just because they say it. Do the research yourself. This guy is trying to sell something himself by bashing a system that does work.

There are a lot of shakes that work. The 90 day challenge just gives people the tools to get what they want and need. Whether that’s the health benefits of losing weight, or the financial side. Personally, I won’t sign someone up who doesn’t want to take the shakes because they don’t care about the people. The money and success for me will come from me helping others get what they want.“The best way to get what you want is to help others get what they want.”

Like I said,it doesn’t matter to me what you do, but don’t bash something just because one guy says it’s a scam.“Dare to be different”

i found this , it says visalus shakes are produced on equipment that
processes products containing milk, eggs, nuts, shellfish AND peanut flavor!!!!     i would have a reaction to these i am very allergic and have had seizures just from being in the same room as someone eating a peanut butter sandwich.  you people selling anything should check into exactly what is in your product and where and how it is manufactured before recommending anything to anyone
 Lawrence 
Walmart carries better supplements.
 Lawrence 
What would you say your profit has been so far?

I would agree. Dare to be different….Dont follow Visalus blindly. Keep an open mind.

Obviously.. you do not know how to market yourself or a product. You can be successful selling ice to an eskimo if you know the product in and out. I lost 167 lbs using a meal replacement that was on and off ViSalus and a Whey protein shake…I regret NOT joining as a distributor earlier. I am 2 weeks in and have 4 monthly customers who are losing weight and training with me. MLM is unsuccessful for the average joe that has NO PEOPLE SKILLS, if you are not good at selling yourself. Go find a REGULAR job at walmart.. I am 23 and I am glad to invest ALL OF MY LIFE SAVINGS into ViSALUS AND THE CHALLENGE! i love it! I know it works! I lost my weight and now I help people do the same.. its my MAIN INCOME! ps: I attended the University of Utah for 2 semesters and DROPPED OUT  to follow my fitness goals and because I know online marketing better than the professor. So if you are reading this BOGUS report.. and want to be your own judge! Go do the RESEARCH! Dont listen to me or anyone else.. listen to your dam self! and go spend the time researching ViSalus! and if you want to learn how to use High intensity training and Visalus to lose weight.. visit http://www.buildmestrong.com …………Or else just let us make the money and when i got to walmart.. ill say hi to you!…
 Lawrence 
I mean no offense to you Jay. But you are exactly the type visalus wants. Please reconsider going back to school. Then you can make an honest living and still not have to work at walmart.

Best of luck
 Snoopy 
lol i have so many people i know over the years have been on this,  mostly broke uneducated in the area of nutrition/fitness, obese lazy people without a clue.. and all of a sudden they are like,

“do u wanna make extra $1000-$3000 and possible 5 figures a month,   LOSE WEIGHT AND HAVE AN AMAZING SHAKE THAT TASTES LIKE A CAKE.. i can show u how..”

it makes me LOL.. literally these people were complaining how overweight they are and having such financial trouble.. the next day they are throwing out all the same nonsense.

every year its something new..  maxgl, isogenics , bodybyvi…same poo different toilet..

people just have to exercise and eat nutrient dense foods, educate themselves, stop looking for the quick fix..  its a lifestyle change…u can do this WITHOUT any gimmicks.  on body by vi, are u suppose to stay on these shakes forever ?
 Lawrence 
If you feel you need supplement shake. Nearly all the other supplements are cheaper. (the real ones) I sell them in my Gym.
 Lawrence 
“stay on these shakes forever?”Visalus certainly hopes so.
 http://twitter.com/JCarteezy Jay Cartel 
No offense taken man!…I agree with snoopy…It takes good nutrition, patience and consistency to lose weight. The average american DOESN’T understand that concept. As a society, we have been slammed by marketing to want INSTANT GRATIFICATION. 6 Min workouts wont do crap to your body, Unless its a high intensity workout and you are consistently working out. Some folks are just to ignorant to understand the elements behind healthy living. You do not have to be on the Shakes permanently obviously you can find good food replacements but nothing will compare to the low caloric count in the shakes with the HIGH amount of vitamins and minerals and the protein in 2 scoops. I mean do not get me wrong, To each his own. Ive been self employed since I was 16, I started a clothing brand at 16. I understand the concept of business and my circle of friends DONT GET DRUNK on weekends, we get together and figure out new marketing concepts for the next 6 months. So ViSalus has been successful for me and now I just signed my 3rd promoter. I dont wake up wanting to make more money, I wake up wanting to help another person who was in my shoes duplicate my success story. That is why ViSalus worked for me. But it is not a SCAM. Its a GREAT opportunity for the right person.
Thanks Lawrence for your opinion.

 Nunyabiz 
So glad I came upon this blog post. I’ve been contacted multiple times on Facebook by a former high school classmates who sells BodybyVi. She says she has the greatest job ever and swears by her shakes (yet has lost very little weight in the year she’s been selling it) and is trying to convince her Facebook friends that it is the best weight-loss/health product out there.
She even had a page about how she was going to lose 90 pounds in 60 days with the BodybyVi shakes. She lost about 10 pounds during that time period. She used the excuse that she had little time to work out. However, she spent a good part o her day on Facebook posting“inspiring”quotes and photos of people who were“transformed”by these shakes.
I haven’t defriended her yet because her attempts at trying to convince everyone that she has this awesome career and that she is selling a wonder product are entertaining.
 Nunyabiz 
Oops–I meant to say she wanted to lose 60 pounds in 90 days. Sorry about that.

Another ViSalus disciple weighs in. It makes me so mad that companies like ViSalus take advantage of people by convincing them that they’re changing people’s lives with these products.
But I don’t feel too sorry for these people, either. They don’t want to put in the hard work to better their lives and think that shilling this garbage to their friends, family and  acquaintances is the answer to their problems. All they’re doing is ticking off their friends and family.
And I think this author knows what a MLM is–skeevy.
Weight-loss and adopting a healthy lifestyle is hard work. Legitimate programs don’t recruit you to sell their products.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
You just got caught in your own lie -  visalus shakes are produced on equipment that processes products containing milk, eggs, nuts, shellfish AND peanut flavor. Careful what you say, it could get you into trouble one day.
 Saevere007 
The only people buying this stuff are new recruits buying into a training program selling a dream. If the product were the money maker it would be sold in smaller units. I like soda I can buy a can a 12 pack or a case. I don’t pay royalties and overrides to uninvolved distributor levels with my purchase. I don’t need to attend a pep rally every month to tell me how much I love coke classic.
 Ms 
My wife makes 30,000 a month with ViSalus it is a great company you are just bashing the company to sell your book people dont believe this douche bag
 http://HealthChange.Info/ Paul 
Well said Jay I have to admit I have failed in the years passed a few times, and I made some of the same mistakes both times..I talked to my warm market and that was it! I never got out of the little trashy broke town I was in and learned how to recruit all over the world..But when you get hungry enough you will learn or not..Its that simple. I found a product I love not Visalus its fine but Im in something else, I love the product and I love helping people get healthy and making money! Its real folks…Dont get involved if you cant talk to people you dont know, dont get involved if you dont have a great leader or training and dont expect to go out and make 5k your first month.. I get on the phone and recruit all day every day 8 until as late as I can call people on the east coast then I finish calling Hawaii..I have signed up 50 people in 45 days and I will continue until I hit my goal..My product is clinically tested 11 separate tests with an 80 year history.. patented everything! so it has to be great OK or it wont last.. good Luck and go for your dreams!!

All the hours you spend going to meetings, calling *coUgH sCamMinG* people, traveling, you could be spending with your family and taking care of yourself.

Anyone who is ready to fast by drinking a shake is ready to learn about eating proper nutrition.  A protein powder does not cause health benefits or weight loss.  Cutting calories and exercise causes health benefits and weight loss.

You promote the worlds healthiest shake claiming it to be in perfect form, and cheap (well yah IT IS cheap) , but you never mention in the same sentence that after you sell your perfectyly made protein powder, you then convince the buyer to ALSO PURCHASE, flavor add-ins, vitamins, appetite suppresant ad-ins, cookies and“special water”drinks.  Now let everyone know THAT TOTAL!

Then the real kicker is how after you suckered people into buying the“perfect protein powder”, you have them ruin it by ADDING carbs, sugar, fat and calories to it, which then completely changes the entire label.

All the time it takes to put together all your funny recipes, and clean out your blenders, you could have prepared a very healthy meal that you can eat with a fork and spoon, chew and digest.

visalus sellers are NOT experts in health and nutrition, and it is so scary to know that these people are out there.  Don’t lie and say you are trying to help others.  You are only helping yourself, and then USE others as your scapegoat.

You can not wake up one day and have all the answers to everything.  People have questions and if you“have the answers”to all of them, you are a liar and a schemer.

another name caller, and remember you are the one that BASHES anything other than what product you are selling.  Do you not?

And how about showing your bank statement? I know first hand from experience that sellers LIE to get what they want.  They exagerate, embellish and lie.

A company that preys on desperate and lonely people is nothing to brag about.

I have nothing against companies that sell candles, makeup etc, because they are products that don’t hurt people, and when you see a candle you know what it is.  When you see a tube of lipstick, you know what it is.

When you get into selling products that revolve around someones health you are in a dangerous area, especially when you are not certified, or an expert in health and nutrition.  Claiming a product is superior is bogus enough, especially when you also sell other products to“make it better”, like flavor add ins, appetitie suppresants (true drinking your meal is not very filling), vitamins (I thought your shake already had enough), cookies (what now you come up with a food, and it’s a cookie! lol and brag your shake taste like“cake mix”?) lol Then come up with recipes to ruin your“perfectly balanced shake”by adding extra carbs, fats and calories.

At least when I buy a candle and a lipstick, that’s it! And if I want to buy a cookie, I will give my money to the Girl Scouts and practice portion control :)

Jay. You sound like a hardworking, intelligent young man. Even though we disagree. I hope you have great success, and get everything your looking for.I Iike the fact that you dont get drunk, and started working at a young age. That alone will put you miles ahead of others in whatever you choose.

Just my opinion and yes I’m a ViSalus distributor.

Can I make a lot of money with ViSalus…yes.  Do I…not really, but not because I can’t.  But because I choose how much time, effort I put into it and I’m cool with that.

Can I lose weight with ViSalus…yes and I have I get my product free every month and save money on groceries.

But what’s more important to me is having a business that works for my life.  I make $1000 a month in additional income that is helping me upgrade my education by paying for University and pay off some debt.  I’m a single mother I don’t want to have many challenge parties which is the main method of making a larger income with visalus, because my daughter is important to me (money isn’t necessarily) and to not spend that time I know later in life I will regret it.  However I enjoy coaching my team to reach their goals whatever they are and helping my friends who come to me interested in trying the product.  But most of all my passion is helping people live happier&amp;healthier lives no matter what that is, with or without visalus that’s just my personality.

At the same time its my responsibility to be educated on the products, my nursing background helps.  Have confidence in my ability to market and sell it, my business background helps.  But also design my business around the life I want to live, my investment in personal growth and coaching helps.

Everyone is different, and that’s cool.  I have found what works for me, and other people in ViSalus or not in ViSalus have found what works for them.

What has helped me most from ViSalus on top of the weight I’ve lost and the extra money for school, is the personal growth I receive every month from Success Magazine.  That is what inspired me to go back to school, change some of my bad habits and make better choices for a happier life.  And $30 a month for it has been an amazing investment for me.  And if you don’t want to sell visalus that’s fine.  I just recommend if you’re not happy in your life right now start becoming aware of it and think about how you want to change it.  Read books, magazines, talk to friends/family who won’t hold you back, work with a coach, whatever fits your budget.

Good luck in the future everyone and if you ever have questions about anything Visalus or non-Visalus related lol add me as a Facebook friend I’d love to connect.  Good luck with the sales of your book and good luck to my Visalus family on improving their lives.

I was introduced to ViSalus Sciences 1 year ago as a total skeptic.  If I had ready this article a year ago (knowing nothing about them) I probably would have taken this article at face value and not tried the program.  Thankfully I did (reluctantly) give it a chance, and it has been the best decision of my life.  I have never been able to manage my weight until this came along.  Now I am 100 lbs lighter, my body fat percentage has gone from over 45% to under 23%.  Per my doctor (who approved my use of the challenge), I have eliminated all of my weight related risk factors and am in the best shape of my life.  I began promoting the Body by Vi 90-day fitness challenge because I had such great results.  Given the epidemic obesity in America, I feel it would be selfish not to tell people about it.  In my opinion, this article is laughably biased and clearly, the writer has not done any actual research on the compensation plan.  You get out of the business what you put into it, just as you would with any business.  Amy I getting rich? No.  Am I building a business based on helping people who want it?  Yes.
Does ViSalus Sciences give a $600.00 payment towards the purchase or lease of a black, silver or green BMW to Regional Directors as part of it’s compensation plan? Yes, at the pace of more than 1 per hour.  Does that BMW have to be brand new? No (a detail conveniently left out by the writer).  Do you have to the BMW bonus?  No, you can opt for a $300 monthly cash bonus instead.
Please do your own research before you read a misinformed opinion piece like this.

I will take this post at his word his wife has a special skill that few people have. Convincing people that spending thousands of dollars a year on shakes and training seminars can make a return on their investment. I assure you she didn’t acquire this skill by calling her detractors douchebags. I will pose these questions about what she does.Do you think multilevel participants are qualified to judge whether prospective
customers need supplements or medical care? Even though curative claims are forbidden by the written policies of each company, the sales process encourages customers to experiment with self-treatment. It may also promote distrust of legitimate health professionals and their treatment methods.
Some people would argue that the apparent benefits of“believing”
in the products outweigh the risks involved. Do you think that people need
false beliefs in order to feel healthy or succeed in life? Would you like
to believe that something can help you when in fact it is worthless? Should
our society support an industry that is trying to mislead us? Can’t Americans do something better with the billion or more dollars being wasted each yearon multilevel“health”products?

I will pose these questions about what she does.Do you think multilevel participants are qualified to judge whether prospective customers need supplements or medical care? Even though curative claims are forbidden by the written policies of each company, the sales process encourages customers to experiment with self-treatment. It may also promote distrust of legitimate health professionals and their treatment methods.
Some people would argue that the apparent benefits of“believing”
in the products outweigh the risks involved. Do you think that people need
false beliefs in order to feel healthy or succeed in life? Would you like
to believe that something can help you when in fact it is worthless? Should
our society support an industry that is trying to mislead us? Can’t Americans do something better with the billion or more dollars being wasted each year on multilevel“health”products?

Great points SAEVERE007. As far as the 30,000 a month. Not gonna buy it. i have a relative (not by blood). who consistently claims a high six figure a year salary with another MLM. He even posts it on his website. He is barely making ends meet. The only job hes held in his 25 adult years was being a cashier at radio shack.
I see these claims all the time. Another top MLM er on another sight posted that he was told by a visalus rep he was making 60k a month, later to find out the guy was living in his van.

You touched on my biggest complaint about visalus. Ive been in the health and fitness industry for 20 years. The poor young reps at visalus dont realize how crazy it is for myself or anyone else in the business, to listen to them tell me about health and fitness.

THIS IS GOING TO BE IN THE LONG RUN A HUGE BLUNDER FOR VISALUS.

There reps have little to no knowledge of health and fitness.
 Lawrence 
Exactly. The supplements I carry can be bought in bulk much cheaper. If I were to use supplements which I dont. I could spend 50 bucks a month for a better product.

Hey Jeff–my name is Christine Sifuentes and I COMPLETELY agree with you. This guy sounded like an idiot writing this review and clearly is“uneducated”himself. please follow me on the Vi-net network!! username christine05 =) glad you posted this!!
 Lawrence 
Ok dont want to insult anyone, but I have noticed that communication skills and language of the vi reps (with some exceptions) is totally unprofessional. Again not all.
I went on, to look up some of these profiles. Not just here. other blogs as well. I found  Most vi-reps are very young. Doesnt mean there arent young people with these skills. Im just not seeing them. Some of these posts look like they were text messaged from a teenager. Including the name calling and downright immaturity. Why would anyone buy anything from them.

You think that you know what are in all these other products make up etc? How do you know that they are not full of chemicals that absorb into to your skin? Visalus promoters never claim to be health experts.But we do have a solid product and an amazing company to back us up. You talk about our shakes being so dangerous. Well it is a much healthier option and a good starting point for the millions of people that sit in drive thurs every morning to fill them selves full of garbage.
I agree that we should all have the time to eat healthy and live a balanced life style. We recommend proper diet and exercise to all of our customer. I think that you shouldn’t be so judgemental. Don’t knock it until you try it. I have been promoting the 90 day challenge for 4 months already and I am now making enough money to help provide for my family and not have to work my day job anymore. How can you be so negative towards a Business and a community of people that are so positive,
We hardly spend any time in huge seminars listening to motivational speakers. We invite poeple into our homes to learn about the Challenge and the business.
In regards to peoples health we advise anyone that has concerns or questions to check with a doctor before ordering.
I am sorry you are so skeptical.If you actually gave it a chance and some proper research you might see Visalus is a different light.
 Tanya_beamish 
most people are getting it for free.

If your drinking all hat soda one day you are going to need a shake.
 Ms 
ok i will show all my bank statements to you if come to my house try the shakes and we can research ViSalus together its people like you who do no reaserch then read one article and now your expert just please check the facts before you comment  P.S we are not lonely and desperate
 Guest 
Wow. You seem to be an angry leader. Is it necessary to say the poster“feeds their mommy?”If you are a true leader than you would address the information and not add personal commentary.
 Lawrence 
still not buyin it
 Ms 
i really dont care if you believe me or not lawrence i dont know you so i have no reason to lie to you someone brought this article to my attention so i read it and it was wrong the guy did not do his research he knows nothing about what he wrote about hes is trying to sell a book please go do your research on ViSalus dont listen to someone else
 Lawrence 
Ms. Ive been researching Visalus for over 6months. I have a close friend who is a distributor, and know a few others. Im also approached by visalus reps all the time.I own a gym and personal training business, and also sell supplements. This article is very similar to 3or 4 other reviews ive read. All written by mlm marketers. of them 2 were in the top 20 most successful multi level marketers. The only other reviews are written by Visalus.
Ironically my biggest issue is that Visalus doesnt do its research. and the reps have almost no knowledge of health and fitness. They dont realize it because they have only listened to Visalus. Ive been training clients for 2 decades. So you have to understand how strange it is to be approached by a young inarticulate rep. Who knows nothing about health.
IT seems to me that the people getting into visalus are the ones not doing research. look at the other side as well as the one presented by the company. Maybe my comment saying i didnt believe you was out of line. I dont know you so maybe i dont have the right to say that.. But im skeptical of all these claims from people.

good luck
 Ms 
i was skeptical with my wife at first when she started drinking them and listen it does work then she became a promoter we did not do this because we need the money i have very succesful cattle business so we are fine money wise she did to help other people just as you who owns a gym then it just took off because the results prove it works and when i say she makes 30,000 a month i mean it i promise you it took me a while to believe it myself and i understand people have there own opions and thats fine im not trying to come on here and get rude my comment about him being a douchebag was wrong and im sorry

There are no ingredients in any protein shake that causes weight loss and other health cures.  If a person drinks any diet shake instead of eating junk food, they will lose weight.  It is NOT because of what protein shake they are drinking.

A person can lose weight, feel great and improve their health by EATING healthy food and exercising. Those who claim the above benefits are because of a protein shake, are scamming you.
 Egg Nog 
There is certainly a lot of contradictory evidence about the motivations and the principles of any MLM company and ViSalus is caught up in this same controversy. From a purely business perspective it’s hard to say whether they are primarily direct marketing of an authentic product (protein shake) or whether they are the typical pyramid scheme which depends on an expanding base of distrbutors to keep them in business and keep the money flowing.  It seems from close scrutiny and personal acquaintence with distributors that both of these business models overlap in the case of ViSalus, although their directorship claims the first–product oriented intentions–most of the distrubutors appear to adopt the pyramidal incentive as their main reason for participating (they want to get rich as quickly as possible).  It seems to me that the product cannot back up the claims for effectiveness as trumpeted by Ryan Blair, Blake Mallen, and Nick Sarnicola (although Blair keeps referring to his own weight loss). When you hear that drinking the shakes can reduce or even completely reverse the onset of type2 diabetes and other illnesses the claims are“too good to be true.”These three co-founders are internet and tech professionals who have discovered a very sophisticated way to make huge profits from the MLM model, and the selling of the ViSalus brand is directly equivalent to how established churches operate at the level of appealing to their congregations.  On the“life of Ryan Blair”video it proudly states at least a half dozen times that Blair is a self-made millionaire, and this is a crucial selling point that gets mixed in very smartly with the fantastic claims about the product and the ViSalus“family.”

If this is indeed a scam, which Blair’s previous PC repair company appears to have been, then it is difficult to peg ViSalus with that same dishonest sell strategy because these guys have basically covered their asses by the complexity of their business model.  If you point out the“pyramid scheme”aspect of their model, they will automatically point to the successful product and customer focus of their company.

I think that the points made by Integrity here and others about the exaggerated claims of their protein shakes are true and the fact that their product is not sold at the regular retail levels throw into doubt the claims made by the ViSalus executives about the product. And in the end if the product is a scam (not any more effective than other protein drinks and supplements)–then all that’s left to look at is the pyramidal distributorships of the model which makes the whole company unethical.  They are selling a fantasy and they probably know exactly what they are doing.

Plus shipping and handling, exchange rate if you live in Canada, plus auto-ship…you are not saving money, you are bleeding it.

You can get better products at local health/wellness/grocery stores. Plus you don’t contribute to a quasi-legal pyramid scheme whose products are sold through the MLM model because the products have no true value in the retail market.
 corporatesucks 
you seem very bitter because i assume you didn’t make what you wanted with Visalus. I’m sure it’s all the companies fault also right?
 corporateamericasucks 
its a meal replacement not a protein shake, big difference.
 corporateamericasucks 
I saw this and had to address a few things. Let’s start with this scam of the month title. I assume you picked Visalus since its getting so much attention and your trying to sell your E-book this choice will get you more traffic and it sure has. A miracle cure product claim has NEVER been made like you say.

You refer to GNC not selling it. Go to GNC 3 weeks in a row and tell them a result your looking to get and whats the best option…you will get 3 different answers each week, whichever has the largest commission is where you will be directed. So be careful who you chose to put in a spotlight for a reference.

You say its a scam because its mlm, is EVERY mlm a scam? whats YOUR definition of a scam?

You make a few monavie comparisions, they are 2 TOTALLY different companies,  different product, different ways to get paid, stop with the apples and oranges.

The BMW issue. You seem to hate this idea and from your explanation your don’t know too much about it. Is there something wrong with giving additional $$$ ($3,600 if you dont have the car or $7,200 a year if you do) to people? The only visalus thing on the car is a 4 inch silver visalus icon on the back, the rest is optional. Is that bad? Most of the country WILL NOT receive a $3,600 raise this year. I also had a BMW prior to Visalus so they send me an additional $7,200 a year, i don’t view that as horrible either. I find it funny you hate this program, but sell 2 e books about driving luxury cars for free?????

You say this gets you nowhere but when 80,000 new customers join the challenge in december not to get rich quick but to take the first step in living a healthier lifestyle is that so bad? Is our company sending out $25,000,000 in FREE product in 2011 a bad thing, is that what makes it a scam? All of those $0 invoices hitting mailboxes?

Or did you SCAM us of our time, buy trying to get website hits for your e books instead of a fact based account of how you decide who the scam of the month is? You also say Visalus preys on the young and uneducated, what is your target market for your driving free luxury cars book? Or living the lifestyle you advertise, dont think its the old and educated!!! Before you throw around strong words and accusations you might want to make sure your not doing many of the same things your speaking down upon. The only difference is your lying about a company you don’t know much about and exposing the truth about yours…oops

And finally for the people responding and commenting to this(i skimmed through 2 pages) I hear mostly the same thing. Your upset that claims are being made by people that dont know all the ins and outs of the product. Well let me ask you this (trainers and fitness people especially) is this shake healthier and more likely for YOUR clients to achieve their goals with you then the fast food they get after their workouts, or the processed food they will eat? It’s not the healthiest option in the world, but its much much better then about 95% of the options we see daily, and much more cost effective then the rest in that 5%.

Tell me how a company that in the last year has helped over 400 new families make over $100,000 per year from home (can you name another company in the country that did that in 2011??) cuts a $300-$600 check 25 times a day to NEW BMW people, has given a customer the ability to fairly easily get FREE product, give out $10,000,000 in cash, prizes, and rewards for those hitting their goals(2012 its now $25,000,000) and gave away more free product to consumers then most companies SELL in a year.

I look forward to hearing your responses. Please do me a favor and be specific, not generalizations of issues. I can provide specific proof as to why these accusations are totally false and will continue to do so. I work from home since i was about to resign from my corporate job so i have plenty of free time :)



 integrity 
typical comeback…it is a protein shake and if you want to call it a“meal”replacement that is even more absured.
 integrity 
You want prizes and money…using people and getting them to give you money by buying something the do not need is wrong.

When I get a bonus at my job there are no strings attached.  I don’t have to recruit people in order to keep my job benefits, nor did I have to recruit people and sell them something to get my job.

When I leave my job and go home, my home life revolves around my family and not trying to scam people into selling them a product they don’t need.

If your agenda is to help people and their health, then you would teach them that calories in/calories out and exercise are key to weight loss.

People gain weight and lose weight by eating.  Eating is smart.  Drinking your meals is dangerous.  Telling people visalus will“help”them lose weight and will make them feel“great”and make medical“claims”regarding their health is a scam.

There are not ingredients in any protein shake or“meal replacement”that cause weight loss or health cures.  Anyone who goes from eating junk food, to not eating junk food, will lose weight, feel great and have health benefits.

Losing weight, feeling great and getting health benefits happen without visalus or any over the counter diet crap.  You are selling something people don’t need.  Your agenda is to win prizes and hope to get rich and make money.

I can give my knowledge regarding health and fitness for free to people who ask.  If someone tells you to spend money they are scamming you, and have an agenda.

It is free and saves you money to make better food choices and move your body.
 integrity 
Annoyed how sellers throw out $$$$$ numbers and talk about BMW’s, when trying to defend why they do what they do.  It just makes it even more obvious what the true agenda is in this.  Themselves and what they can get out of scamming people.

Not a very good choice for meal replacement. Also overpriced. Im in the health fitness field.

GNC does NOT make commisions selling supplements. They work on mark up. I sell supplements at my club. No health club or store would carry these products because they are not comparable to already existing supplements. Visalus is more along the lines of isogenics, shaklee etc. Visalus reps constantly deny this, but again few of them are in a position to know.
As a trainer i would recommend they  take all the money buying fast food and spend it on real food. Which is cheaper than all supplements including Visalus. If they needed a meal replacement I would point them to one I thought was better that would be much cheaper. (many options on this point).

Visalus is not legally a scam. It gets around this by selling its product to distributors. But for the average joe who wants to get in shape why would they want to get entangled with all this?

I get approached all the time at my club by. MLM companies selling health products.  There are more everyday. I HAVE TO TELL YOU. Alot of the other companies make a stronger case than Visalus. Im sure this is not true for alot of young people who are prone to hype. But to educated people in the field. We just dont buy it.

The 90 day challenge is the only reason Visalus is growing so fast. That will eventually run its course, and alot of people will have shelves full of product.

Lawrence, Do you know anything about soy protein? A while back there was a discussion on soy protein causing estrogen levels to rise cause troble with the tyhroid gland and the pancares. Some reported heart trouble to..? You can find this discussion several pages back.
 Okay 
The City of Toronto mayor, Rob Ford, is trying to lose weight. One of you distributors should give him a call.

Since you have the free time, it would also benefit you to read all the posts. There are alot more specifics earlier on.
 Egg Nog 
But corporateamericasucks, if you go to the ViSalus main page and check out the video from their Orlando convention, you will see plain as day when the second distributor comes up from the audience to give her“testimony”–she says directly that ViSalus intake over several months cured her of the type2 diabetes she was diagnosed with and put on insulin shots to keep in check. There are Blair, Mallen, and Sarnicola standing behind her applauding the“miracle cure”of the ViSalus shake!!! None of these multi-millionaire executives of ViSalus challenge any of her claims, they’re the ones who picked her out specifically to come up to the stage to tell her miraculous story.

You, who are cheering for this scam company, are hypnotized by the words of these people and cannot see any of the negatives (immoral practices) of this type of corporation.  No wonder corporate America sucks, because it is mostly profit oriented and will scam anybody to make money, nothing different about ViSalus.

Got out because the time invested wasn’t worth the return. Time with my family and friends has no price tag.

Maybe you like calling people like an annoying telemarketer, and you think that the time doing so is more valuable than time spent with your family, but it’s not worth it to me.

Best of luck to you!

If most people are getting it free how is the product the money maker? The distributorships and sales training i.e. magazines, seminars must be.

I am a UPS driver with Chron’s disease not likely to gain weight anytime soon. My G.I. doctor found it laughable after I told him that people thought these shakes cured Chron’s disease. Which has nothing to do with your diet and is a genetic immunity disorder.

I thought one of the prerequisites for succeeding in this business were to attend the big conventions to absorb the knowledge of the business leaders. This usually requires a weekend out of town in a hotel no?

So if and when that happens, should it remain a secret? Its not announced as a cure for anything but it if helps certain individuals why be upset or complain, why not congratulate? If it was my relative and that happened i would be thanking someone everyday, as im sure you would as well, right?

These people are like a cult. Wrong is right. Anything for the almighty Shake. Visalus is their God. They all chant the same insane irrational chant. Other people are negative.

There is no lie they would not tell, no one they would not scam for their god Visalus.

Have you been reading this blog or are you off in Netherland with all the other brainwashed Visalus crew.
 corporateamericasucks 
You are correct i used the wrong word. Most clubs(dont know you so not saying you but MOST) and gyms won’t put something on their wall to sell unless they make 35% markup. Many times people forget its a business.

We are along those lines as you say, but where were different is giving customers free product($25 million in free product in 2011 is nothing short of remarkable). You say as a trainer you would recommend…how many listen?

Is this option easier and just as cost effective? YES. Would that in return help YOUR clients with results? YES. Would those results increase foot traffic on your gym and add more $$$ to your bottom line? YES. Would your trainers get more clients if they were part of a $25 million prize pool and people could pretty easily get free supplements and save over $200 a month on food? Would that make you stand clear above most competition for the average person, of course.

Visalus is noting even close to a scam. Scams dont save you money, they kill your pocket. The only thing most people lose here is fat and insecurity. 2 things they look to lose when they come to you, are you a scam?

And please tell me about the MANY or A LOT of companies that make a better case then visalus, how so? Is it because you didn’t like the young rep you spoke with? I would love to talk personally and answer your questions, i think whoever you spoke with was very misinformed or new. thanks!!!
 corporateamericasucks 
FYI the meal replacement shake is under $2.00 per serving in that prices a mixer(milk, juice or whatever is counted) under $2 is much cheaper then 90% of other options, and FREE which 1 in 4 get it for in untouchable. just an FYI
 Elizzyp 
I wish you Visalus people would go back to school.  You are so unimformed, negative, angry people. You blow off when some one disagrees with your great master Visalus.  It is just a shake forlks, and not a very good one. You act like it is some great second comming. It is a scam. Nothing more.
 corporateamericasucks 
Do people spend money eating? A meal replacement i snot dangerous, most people in the know will tell you its impossible to eat as much as your body need from a nutrient level. So hitting the vending machine or fast food drive thru is better then a meal replacement shake? Are you serious?
 Elizzyp 
Jeff

You are not helping people you are scamming them. You are like the other brain washed Visalus people living in your little world or big numbers and even bigger lies. You have no business you are trting to scam people with a worthless shake that is not a business. You don’t even have a job.  Visalus thinks so much of you they will not even recognize you are connected with their company.
 Elizzyp 
The family thing—–Cult like—–.  You don’t have a business they tell you that to give you an inflated ego so that you’ll scam yoyr family and friends.  They don’t even think enough of you to even give you a JOB (dirty word to you right?)
 Elizzyp 
I don’t either.  I know you Visalus people have different way of accounting than the rest of the world. But even in your world that doen’t hold water. How many month has she made that.  In Visalus world you live month to month.

This is what I dislike about Visalus and MLM they take asvantage of good people trying to better themselve and scam them into this wacko sturr. Brain wash them until they wake up one morning and find themselve broke and with out friends and feeling bad about theirselve. Jay you do not fail they set you up to fail, there is no way you can win in this business unless you own it or so close to them that you don’t sell.  Good luck Buddy I’ll be praying for all of you Visalus victims.  Read all the past post here and get educated about this stuff.

I understand that most reviews online also offer there own opportunity to sell a book, usually on how to generate more MLM leads. The way of the world I guess. I would go directly on the visalus sight to contribute my opinion but they wont allow that unless I join.

Be careful.. There have been so many who have quit their jobs and then this fails through as it must like any pyramid.n  These people are not postive I have never seen such angry negative people when anyone doen’t agree with them about their god Visalus.  They are brainwashed into a cult like exsistance were the only people they are comfortable with and the only people comfortable around them are other Visalus people.  They are postive about scamming you and getting you to scam your friends and family.  When your connections have dried up they will be through with you. I hope you don’t end up with no job as I have seen happen. over and over again.

Yea I have read afew articles about that. The estrogen thing may have some validity, but I would think that to be insignificant. however Soy protein is not assimilated by the body as easily animal protein.
 Lawrence 
I mark everything up 100%. That said could still offer a better meal replacement, for about 70$ a month. If Its a client of mine I give it for cost.
I dont endorse most of my own supplements either, although they are better than visalus products. Not a big believer. MOST fitness professionals arent. This is where visalus reps screw up. The general public for the most part, have little knowledge of health and fitness. So they fall prey to this. Not just visalus. But all the supplemnts they see on TV and in stores.
My friend who initially approached me to get involved sells Hardware for a living. Yet he was stunned that I told him Visalus was unremarkable.
Visalus would do poorly in a health club setting because not only the staff, but most of the clientele is very savvy, when it comes to health and fitness. From what I can see, Visalus goes after the novice. Which in turn makes the reps novices, after they become instant distributors. Ive been approached many times by visalus reps. Without exception they give the company line. When challenged they start making claims about things they dont know. They dont have even a rudimentary knowledge of diet and nutrition. Some of the shaklee and isagenics reps were much more knowledgable. They didnt present themselves NEW or BETTER which of course is true of any supplement ever invented. Even if a supplement  came out that was better. It would be insignifacant. It would be akin to saying i can run faster with certain sneaker.

protein supplements are hard on the organs over time. Kidneys , Liver. So are vitamins.  If you get a high liver enzyme indication on a blood test, The second question they will ask you ( first being do you drink alcohol) is“do you take protein or vitamin supplements?”
Thats the great thing about real food. Its nearly impossible to take in to much of either.
Have you ever noticed the strong yellow orange color of your urine when you are supplementing? Thats the majority of protein and vitamins not assimilated by the body. VERY EXPENSIVE URINE.
I make my own shakes when I need something. Skim milk, nonfat yogurt fruit in a blender. Your body will utilize it all.

i think it funny how you barrage companies about scams, but in the same breath try to sell us your book on how to make money. lol
 Chameleonx13 
“pyramid scheme”is where you give someone money, and get nothing in return except for the hopes of money.

MLM is I buy a product, and I attempt (if I choose to) to sell that product to others.

This is Direct Sales, I’m buying this product because I want it…Yes, if I can make money, I’m not going to say no, but I’m also not going to push people into doing it that aren’t asking me about it.

I KNOW that I’m losing weight, feeling more energetic, not feeling hungry, and I’m saving money by not buying expensive food from the grocery store or otherwise (except for dinner lol) And you know what, I’m ok with all those things…and honestly, if I don’t make a penny, hopefully at least I’ll be in better shape and happier with my lifestyle choices…right?
 Chameleonx13 
And by the way, there is no such thing as a legal pyramid scheme lol
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Plus shipping and handling, exchange rate if you live in Canada,
plus auto-ship…you are not saving money…

You
can get better products at local health/wellness/grocery stores. Plus
you don’t contribute to a quasi-legal pyramid scheme whose products are
sold through the MLM model because the products have no true value in
the retail market.

BTW, before you judge me (becuause you already have on posts below), I stopped Visalus because the time invested wasn’t worth the return. Time spent with my friends and family is priceless. Maybe you think it’s worth your time to call everyone like an annoying telemarketer, but it’s not worth it to me.

Good luck to you!

I do not sell ViSalus, but I am a user who has had phenomenal results, as well as better health. Definitely not a scam! You must have no knowledge of what you speak of.

Any shake supplement should be treated as just that: a supplement, not a crutch. By replacing 2 meals a day, it is a crutch. You really want to help people live healthier lives? Tell them to start eating healthy whole foods and to exercise regularly.
 Lori 
I was simply looking up the Neuro vs the new mango drink and saw this link.,  I also use Visalus, but I don’t sell it, just not my thing. But I think that so far it’s a great product, and at a reasonable cost.  I pay full price  as I’ve only told a few people and one tried it.  for her it wasn’t as good as for me.  For me- I likely couldn’t be working as hard as I do today without it.  It has taken me rom very low energy to much higher energy. I haven’t done it for weight loss. It’s relatively healthy, and natural. all in all a good product. So I don’t really care about the marketing methods as I’m removed from that, but the product is good.
 Tmaddux 
“IT”(visalus) does not do anything to help anyone, since there are no special ingredients that cause weight loss or health cures, or ingredients to make you feel great.  If someone is losing weight or feeling great it is only because they have reduced their caloric intake, and are eating healthier. THAT is what causes health benefits and the“feel great”status.

Reducing calories=losing weight=health benefits NOT because of any particular diet shake.

You can lose weight and feel great without spending money on a protein shake.  Just stop eating junk food and exercise.  Save money from buying less junk food and it’s free.

Anyone who asks for your money in order to“sell you an easy fix”is scamming you.  There are plenty of certified and qualified people who will give their advice for free.
 Lori 
Wow- I decided to stay in here for a bit and read some comments- That Elizzyp- has a real hate on for Visalus, and I just don’t get why. Attacking anyone who likes it as needing to go back to school.  Hmmm.. I’m 51- just turned. Normally eat as healthily as possible and was very sick for years after being exposed to grain mould, and the secondary metabolites of mould. My memory went, my energy went, and my iron dropped dramatically. I had a ferritin level of 4. I ended up taking a year off to catch up at home from all the dropped things- I kept dropping anything that wasn’t absolutely critical and they were piling up.. A lot of that year I just recooperated.. but had little desire or ability to get going. Just as I went back to work a friend told me about Visalus- maybe I could sell it and I could put off going back to work, he thought.  I said that I can’t sell anything I don’t believe in, nor am I the rah-rah type. He told me about the challenge etc.  He hadn’t tried it yet- nor was he selling it yet. A couple months later after he did try it, he told me he felt a lot better- more energy than he had in years and lost 18 pounds- he’s a big man.  I went to a test party  as he decided to try distribution,and a frend of his I had never met, said- wow Al, you look better than you have in years. I listened to pitch- which I didn’t like- the guys are so young and“internety-”But I said- whatever, I’ll give it a whirl ,and I did.  What it has done for me, is allowed me to feel better and take a step back and examine what I may have been doing wrong in my eating before, and implement changes for the better.  I likely was a bit too carb dependant.  I feel so much better with not just the shakes- which I was against due to the sugar substitute, but the neuro, and the Vi trim pills, and the“system”.  Sometimes a system can make it easier to stay with something.
I am implementing small changes every month now in my life. I won’t stay on the shakes forever and am already phasing them out.  But it’s given me what I needed to want to make the changes now, as opposed to feeling so crappy I just wanted to plant my ass in front of the Tv when I walked in the door.
That system, assisted me in making changes I could not have done on my own.
I do eat well, but I was sick and needed a boost. Until you feel like that yourself, you simply don’t“get it”.
My IQ is very high, I am well -educated and I do not buy into everything that comes along- actually the opposite.
So far I stopped watching TV, ( at all–had it disconnected) study for hours a day now and spend time on creative things instead of TV. I seriously feel about 20 years younger- a big claim, but true- I could hardly keep up with my 84 year old dad this spring on a cruise.
If anyone can get upset about my choices and think I’m a fool for choosing this, I question their motives. I have a health food store I go to and get supplements when I feel I need them, I eat well- organic and vegetarian.  I had been on specially compounded iron supplements. I have taken other protien powders when I was younger and working out a lot. I’m sorry- this system is quite good. Maybe you don’t like that fact, but it is working for me anyway.

I didn’t do the challenge- not my thing, I don’t distribute, but I wish those that do well.  I tell a few people here and tere who comment on how well I look, that Visalus has helped me. I pay full price because I don’t ask freinds to purchase it so I can get mine free, and I still think it’s worth it. My distributor is Al–his site is Visiongate.myvi.net

It has a money back guarantee for the first month, so what is to lose?

The negative posters should back up their claims with personal experience or some scientific facts, or some financial details and cost comparisons. What I have seen has been opinion. And you are entitled, but it should be informed, not vehement protest.

Gym owner- maybe you are, maybe you aren’t, if you are you should post your guym’s name. Free publicity and all. Your opinion is possibly very valid, but It has worked for me.

good luck and healthy living all!
anyway- out of here for good.

An mlm has no off button. Well meaning people who join to supplement their income will lose their time, money and credibility. I am sure there are infinitely many uninformed distributors you have to spend your time making excuses for. Sooner or later we will have to stop blaming a particular mlm company and admit the mlm technique itself is fundamentally flawed.

 Bbmoudy 
WOW this site is totally BS!!!! My wife and I have been selling ViSalus for less than a year, she lost 45 pounds in 90 days and I lost 36.  After that people began asking how we did it(we were just customers st the time) then we referred them to our site, got our products for free and became distributors.  We both have BMW’s which we bought outright and get $600 per month each for life.  We are making a combined $13,520 per month and it keeps growing.  To say the things this site is saying is completely false and someone did not do their homework before writing many of these things.  The point of the ViSalus system is to build a team, like many MLM type companies its all about the team.  The commission structure is great  and the product REALLY DOES work.  Before ViSalus I COMPLETELY HATED MLM, but after the product ACTUALLY worked we couldn’t stop the orders from coming in.  It is a great solid company.  Come join me at http://www.bmoudy.bodybyvi.com.

Cut down on the molson.
 Lawrence 
Congrats. How many people do you and your wife have in your downline?
 ms 
i still dont care if you believe me or not
 ms 
who will have product on the shelf?
 Lawrence 
Gonna go out on a limb. Youre probably referring to me as“Gym owner”.“Maybe you are, maybe you aren’t”. How right you are. I guess we can never tell whos telling the truth.

Good Health.
 Egg Nog 
Oh, so you believed that lady about the diabetes cure, while I felt that she was exaggerating and just got sucked-up in the ViSalusmania–she wanted to be a star performer and guess what–it worked, she got the spotlight and you bought her story. I hate to break it to you corporateamericasucks, but miracles don’t happen, especially the corporate sponsored”protein shake miracles!”
 Egg Nog 
I thought you only get a site after you become a distributor?  Anyway, so you’re now earning over $162,000 per year, you’ll be millionaires in no time at all–and people here are calling it a scam!  You’re damn good.
 integrity 
Disagreeing about something is not being negative.  Us gym owners, or people who are healthy because we chose to eat food and exercise are not wrong about how we live life.  Saying“visalus”has“changed your life”or“worked for you”,…you are putting the thanks on the wrong subject.  You should be thanking yourself for your progress, that you have cut back on over eating.  There are no ingredients in any protein shake that cause weight loss, or health cures.  When a person chooses to eat better and live a healthy life, the natural side effect is a healthier life.

And we don’t feel the need to brag about where we work and what our credentials are, as we are not looking for anyone to bow down at us.  We are not idols and too many people are worshiping a protein powder.
 Elizzyp 
Yeah you are doing so well you are even trying to sell here. Putting up your site every where kinda speaks to your desperation and the untruth of all your other statements.  Poor you.
 Elizzyp 
I don’t hate on anyone or thing. I know you have a very high IQ.  Sorry about the MOLD. He doesn’t have to name his GYM if he doesn’t want too. Still desperatly trying to sell putting up sites. You say the same old lies and chan as all the cult followers.  All the catch phrase: it works for me, you don’t have to try it, hating on, negative. Another obvious miracle cure story.  If you really believe this you do need some help.  Surely you do not expect us to believe this dripple.  I have no motive but to warn people and try to save them from making a mistake.
 Elizzyp 
Sure you don’t sell LOL
 Elizzyp 
Sure you don’t sell it LOL
 Elizzyp 
Doesn’t anyone recognize SARCASM?
 Elizzyp 
On another site lazymanandmoney he made went and bought all the products in Visalus and it cost him .23 a shake. and that wasn’t even buying in bulk.  What mark up would you call that.
 Elizzyp 
After an 18 year study the only supplement your body doesn’t get enough of is calcium. The other vitamins and supplements you take your body discards and some may even be dangerous if you get to much.
 Elizzyp 
Yes it is better for you to eat if it is the right thing. You have other choices than drive thru or Visalus some good healthy food that you can digest and chew is another choice I would go for.
 Elizzyp 
At least Walmart would recognize you as an employee. and you probably would make more money.
 Elizzyp 
Good Catch!
 Lawrence 
Once the market is saturated, which will happen at some point. especially with the 90 day challenge. Visalus shakes wont sell as fast leaving distributors with extra product.
 Egg Nog 
Amazing miracles happening right before our eyes thanks to Visalus! Out of the blue we suddenly have 4 posts extolling the virtues of the product but not so keen of the marketing strategy–although Bbmoudy admits (unfortunately for him) that it“all about the team”- woohoo cult–and gives us his URL just in case there’s interest!
Obviously the“Visalus Team”is aware of this site and they need to suppress it, so they send their people out to try and scam the readers here. For all we know Lori and Lori could be the wives of Ryan and Blake?  These people are out to defend their territory from attack and they know very well how to scam, that’s how they make their living!
 Lawrence 
was thinking the same thing.
 Lawrence 
Spent some time watching videos from visalus reps including, Sarnicola, and mallen. I know this has been said before but THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT. Especially funny is Sarnicola’s“March to a billion”

I also spent time watching some BEACHBODY videos. They focus mainly on the product. Many of the Reps are also trainers. its another mlm so Im in know way recommending it. Just thought it was interesting.
 Lol 
Any 90 day system works, so, why is this any better?

Is it cheaper?
 Bodybypee 
The only pyramids I want any
part of is the ones in Egypt and Mexico! Protien shakes at a 4000% mark
up. Use your friends to pay you. Take salt out of an overweight persons
body and boom body b,y vi. Oh! I forgot to mention. Millions in
marketing.
 Lawrence 
Exactly. I could drink chocalate milk from stewarts instead of a meal for 90 days. I will drop a ton of weight.
They will say its cheaper. I dont think it is.
 Lawrence 
The sign just blew down in front of my“IMAGINARY GYM”
 corporateamericasucks 
1. Produce tastes great and keeps you full for about 3 hours with LESS calories, and sugar then most on the market.
2. Cost- Less then most as well, with option to get it for free(1 of 4 customers currently do)
3. $25 MILLION is free product, vacations, makeovers, and cash given away in 2012
4. 30 empty product $$$ back promise, you dont like you dont pay
 corporateamericasucks 
Lawrence nobody tells you how to run your gym, the marketing system and concept has not been used in direct sales before, which is why you think march to a billion is funny. But when they are the 1st company to do what you think is funny this years, who will be laughing?

Beachbody does talk about their greenberry shake, its only 2 times the price with no way to get for free unless you become a COACH(which you have stated drives you nuts) but like i said there is a reason we are growing faster then all the rest, BY FAR and its not because of a ad you watched.
 corporateamericasucks 
customers on the challenge get websites for free fyi
 corporateamericasucks 
Can you please explain something, you keep saying SCAM. It’s clear why this website did because they want to sell you e-books(very classy) but why do you? What EXACTLY is happening for you to call it a scam? You say they know very well how to scam, and make a living at it. So please elaborate, thanks!
 Elizzyp 
It’s because of all the people out with not a shred of common sense. Theis thing has been around forever scamming people and when Visalus has played out there will be others to take its place.
 corporateamericasucks 
what part is the scam? You guys keep saying scam scam scam but dont know anything specific lol
 Lol 
Fruits and vegetables will keep me full for 3 hours. At a fraction of the cost.
 corporateamericasucks 
yes. let me correct my math a fraction of free is? lol
 Cmba 
I have never posted on a site in my life but you really are a scary sad angry negative person. I feel bad for you and your attitude. Wow.
 Lawrence 
Sarnicola, mallon, blair will be laughing. dont  think 99% of visalus promoters will be. Truthfully though I dont think there gonna hit that goal.
 Saevere007 
The sale of the products is distributor driven not market driven. It is more like gambling, only the percentage of winners is smaller, than a legitimate residual income.  It appeals to the something for nothing mentality. It urges new recruits to buy products on a subscription basis, invest in sales material and pay for ongoing training  until they run out of money or give up.
 Lawrence 
To put this into perspective, AMWAY did 1 BILLION in sales in the month of june 2011
 Saevere007 
The sad thing is most people don’t realize Amway stays in business the same way Visalus does via enormous losses of new recruits.
 Egg Nog 
Look corp, it’s one thing to have a website that sells a book about how to make money, and quite another to outright lie to people (Blair picks a woman to give a testimony that ViSalus shakes cured her type2 diabetes), sell them a product with false claims, entrap them into a multi-level-marketing scheme where they become product distributors for your questionable product, promise them riches and luxurious gifts if they can reach certain sales volumes.

Of course it’s not a scam if these are your ethical guidelines: you are comfortable lying to people (friends and family), you don’t mind tricking people into buying some questionable product and encouraging them to become distributors for it by offering them benefits if they do. This kind of entrapment also benefits your financial position in the company and the more entrapments you can secure, the better off you will be.

Maybe these tactics look like genuine business practices to you, I mean Tide lies about their products and McDonalds lies about theirs, it’s all part of doing business.  But the scam is how the lies are used to entrap you into their MLM scheme and as the pyramid of distributors grows larger and larger, the money funnelling up to the top also increases.  Legitimate businesses selling products do not  enrich themselves by deceptively luring their customers into becoming their salespeople in a level by level hierarchy and making their profits off the continual growth of the number of their marketing representatives.
 Egg Nog 
To answer that last statement, they know how to scam . . .  they know how to lie creatively and then let their audience jump to the wrong conclusions.  I think they have the psychology all figured out in their marketing strategy by selling you on health and wealth and friendship, while the product under all this fake well-being is just your average protein powder drink that wouldn’t sell at all if not for the team hoopla,  the false promises, and the growth in distributorship.   These people know how to lie and get away with it by confusing the issue with complex salesmanship.
 Imsmarterthanyou 
And then die from no nutrition, idiot.
 Imsmarterthanyou 
Elizzyp, there are 50,000 promoters in Visalus across the US and Canada. Over 100,000 people joined the Challenge last month alone as CUSTOMERS. You are quite ignorant to think that every person who chooses to engage in your assanine debate has to sell.
Though, as a matter of fact, Blake Mallen, Ryan Blair and Nick Sarnicola ALL just sent out a blast email to EVERY promoter asking us to come here and defend Visalus because YOU are single handedly bringing the company to ruin! LOL
Like it or not asshat, people are going to continue“buying in”to the“scam”long after you get bored enough to quit whining and go protest something else insignificant. So do everyone a solid, take out whatever crawled up your ass and died and have a POSITIVE day, ok friend?
 Eking 
I too am a Visalus promoter. I have a friend that I went to school with, who was at the RD level when he shared Visalus with me. He reached the ambassador level ,making about 10-12 thousand dollars per month, in just over a year I have helped two people( one being my father) make it to the RD level already. I personally know 3 other people personally, who have replaced their income, and retired early, in less than 18 months. In addition, I know about ten others personally who also have BMW’s paid for by Visalus. My top challenger has lost 100 lbs in the past six months., Many other of them have lost 30,45lbs +. That’s all the time I have to plead my case. I have too many people that I have to go help lose weight and get healthy.Mos of these people on here are just uneducated. You can’t fix stupid.
 Lawrence 
Obviously wouldnt do it. Making a point. sorry you didnt get it.
 Lawrence 
Chocalate milk only has few less grams of protein than visalus. none of the vitamins which is ok. because youre body will eliminate any concentrated form of vitamins. Like I said before Visalus shakes and most others become very expensive urine. Hope you can understand this.
 Lawrence 
how many in your downline?
 Lawrence 
The company will come to ruin on its own. Especialy with inarticulate reps like yourself who have curse to make a point.
 Lawrence 
Here is the POSTER CHILD for Visalus reps. Im sure Visalus treasures you.
 Elizzyp 
1. same old shake over and over no matter what you put in it to make it taste different it is still a shake. To satisfy hunger you need aroma. texture, and to be able to chew.
2. Show the over saturation all dealers and no cutomers
3. If it is not overprice how do they pay for these.
4. Look at all the post from people who got suck and couldn’t get their money back.
 Elizzyp 
Are you crazy.  Milk is one of the most nutritous think you can eat or drink.  Babies live on it when they are growing and developing. WOW
 Elizzyp 
And what do they use to make the shakes, oh yeah MILK
 Elizzyp 
Since it is so wonderful why worry about getting it free?  You are growing faster than the rest; rest of what scams. Coach Distributor , a rose by any other name is still a rose.  You use we freely when the company doesn’t recognize as being associated with them.
 Elizzyp 
Scam like the company is scamming you.  You are the victim and then you produce more victims by scamming your friends and family.
 Elizzyp 
So right and the sad part is their target is their own family and friends.  I have seen families torn apart over this stuff, friends lost, etc. Not even taking in the finacials lost that people endure.  Run up their credit cards to go to meetings, promoting this stuff, acr leases, etc. Then they try to trick them into believing they are doing good.  They are a family. Jim Jones used that tatic.
 Elizzyp 
I agree about not fixing stupidity.  Anybody can be uneducated about a subject. It is stupidity when the chance to learn is presented but you refuse to learn.  We are merely trying to educated you about Visalus before you are hurt and hurt others. If you are legit I am sorry that your friend sucked you in to this shame on him.  Shame on you for sucking your father in. You are a victim but you don’t have to victimize others.  Please don’t insist on being stupid.  LEARN
 Elizzyp 
Not if you want the enhanced site, and who wouldn’t  LOL That’ll cost $29 each and ever month.
 Elizzyp 
I am neither angry or negative. Scary no way. My attitude is I don’t like to see people taken advantage of and when it is from your family and friends it hurts double. If you want to see some scary people tell the Visalus people the truth and talking about getting angry, negative. WHOA
 Elizzyp 
No I would not want you as a friend since I know you care so little of your friends you would scam them with Visalus. You proved our point over saturation. I have no desire to ruin Visalus you people with your trashy talk and manners will do that. Another point no control over the quanity or qyality of the people who sells.  I always have a positive day as I am smart enough and have the common sense not to get scammed by Visalus as you have. Which I don’t blame you for being angry getting scammed isn’t a lot of fun.
 Elizzyp 
EggNog you have way to much common sense for these Visalus people youwould never make it in their upside down world.
 Elizzyp 
I think most of this advertisement is sarcasm about the subject.  Has anyone here bought a book or anything.  I haven’t.
 Elizzyp 
I don’t think Lawrence needs your help in running his Gym.  He seems to have plenty sense, he has set standards and Visalus just doen’t reach it.  Now you I think you could benefit greatly from a big shot of common sense.
 Catwoman 
Amway is international.  ViSalus is only in the US and Canada.  If they do it, it will be impressive.  Amway has been in business since at least the 70’s probably longer.  ViSalus has not.
 Lawrence 
I agree. That would be quite the accomplishment. However the quick rise is also a reason some top marketers are staying out of it. Usually saturation and drop. Mona-vie claimed 3500% growth early on.
 Elizzyp 
Hey imsmarterthanyou I am no genius but I don’t think you are smarter than any one . You’re the one who fell for the scam not me umm who’s the idiot.
 Vrules 
Did they really send an email to every distributor? Could you post it?
 ms 
distributors dont handle the product. Thought you did your reasearch for 6 months?
 Fu_vialus 
Nick Sarnicola came of of the bathhouse with his tranny looking wife (cough* beard *cough) long enough to write something?

While Ryan Blair is too busy looking at his daddy’s checkbook to bother with any of this..

just another cheap punk looking for a daddy
 Lawrence 
didnt mean literally. Was a figure of speech for market saturation.
 Lawrence 
ok maybe 5 and half months.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
You do handle product: for your challenge parties…plus, an option to remain an active distributor is to buy a minimum of $125 worth of personal product for the month. Also, most distributors do the 90 day challenge to promote, which requires you to consume the product, so you are obviously handling the product. Maybe you overlooked all of that…
 Bull 
Sorry, how did u get it free?
 Lawrence 
I cant find revenue imformation for Visalus anywhere. Its listed on sites like Prweb etc. but that is a free press sight anyone can use. I cant find any official statistics. Im not saying there arent any. but its kind of strange. Also found a blog that said there are no official stats only claims by visalus. Not saying i doubt there claims but It is strange. If someone has official numbers please post. Theres many listings but they are not from recognized sources. AMWAY has there revenue listed in forbes.
 Lawrence 
Ex-Vi. Take a look at my new post regarding visalus revenue. Maybe you can help me out.
 Lawrence 
Wall Street journal article seems to be fishy too. No link. Turns out the article was written by THE DIRECT SELLING NEWS an insert flyer in the wall street journal. The article not written by WSJ.

3 for free program, if a customer wants whatever they get for free they can refer 3 to the challenge and get a $0 invoice next month
 corporateamericasucks 
yes common sense, i am a college grad, and was the most successful at my position in corp america out of about 450 people nationwide. I smacked my head on the glass ceiling for 3 years straight. I got on the challenge, turned into a business and was about to walk away from my job with a smile on my face. I now have a home in the north and south and live a lifestyle most cannot even imagine. So you keep your“common sense”and ill keep way of life. thanks :)
 Lawrence 
Any revenue data from an official source. ie: Forbes, Bloomberg. Nothing self reported.
 corporateamericasucks 
in the WORLD, not north america. BIG difference. A billion dollar company created in under 3 years in our country and canada alone. Maybe if a few more did they our country wouldn’t be in the position it is? I’m sure you guys will find a way to knock it then also so its a moot point.
 corporateamericasucks 
Specific example, what happened to you??? I KEEP ASKING FOR EXAMPLES but none are mentioned, are you just repeating things you hear with nothing to back it up?
 corporateamericasucks 
we are #1 in the industry with over $450 a rep in sales(3 for free model) so when we add 10k promoters and 80k customers thats a distributor driven market? I understand that MOST of the mlm are like this but we are not. Sorry guys, this is how the industry should be

were you in visalus?

thanks. BLYTH operated at a loss through the  4th quarter of fiscal year 2011. That is after the aquisition of visalus. No direct stats on visalus though. -Bloomberg. I’ll keep looking.

So, it’s not really free. You’re just making someone else pay for it. And when they stop buying you end up paying.

No, but I have seen all the sales hype and checked into the quality of their products because my closest friend has recently been sucked into the scheme by his ultra religious family.
His problem is that he has no education and he is very trustworthy and loyal especially with his family. He thinks the product is great because his parents are in the ViSalus scheme and they swear by it. Unfortunately they too are very gullible, strict Mennonites who basically take people for their word and know nothing about the business world. The sad part is, these are the sort of people who will lose money and spend money they don’t have to keep“the dream”alive, until finally they see the light.  These people are not lying or scamming like the distributors who got them hooked, and eventually they will be expendable–victimized by the lying cheats.
 corporateamericasucks 
go to directsellingnews.com look under financials they follow all the pubic stocks and companies. The loss was from their other companies, visalus saved them in Q3&amp;4. Visalus was up a little over 197 million in 2011 over 2010, its all public knowledge, check it out
 corporateamericasucks 
what is $1.65 divided by 4,000??? I will buy those meal replacement shakes, lol. Throwing out stupid numbers and facts just wastes the time of anybody reading your post. Have something to say, or just sit quite and call it a scam because you couldnt do it. Good luck to you
 corporateamericasucks 
no when your credit card is not charged, and your invoice says $0 with no bill to follow it is in fact free. What other company mlm or traditional does that? answer none. So they must be scams then right?
 integrity 
What is the price of the visalus protein shake PLUS the flavor add ins PLUS the appetite suppresant add ins PLUS the added vitamins PLUS the neuro PLUS the cookies PLUS the extra food you put in to make it more filling and satisfying and nutritious! LOL
 integrity 
YES it is a scam to work hard to convince another person they should buy a product they don’t need in order to fullfill your agenda.

You are BRILLIANT, dude.  First of all, it is evident to even my 2nd grade son that you haven’t quite mastered the English language….AND that you must hold a grudge about something for some reason, because you don’t quite know what you are talking about (my son understood that from reading your article, too).
Nobody makes ANY claimes about“miracles”or“cures”as you state in your“article”(that word is in quotes, as I use the term, loosly).  You will hear patient testimonials of incredible healthy lifestyle improvements, however, and you can meet with several MD’s whos hundreds of patients I have personally enrolled in the 90 Day Challenge ARE sharing THEIR amazing personal stories!!!  But, you will NEVER hear anyone claim Visalus products“cure”or“prevent”anything, or are a“miracle”product or drug.
You also talked about SELLING weight loss pills.  I don’t know what company you are referring to….but you better start doing your OWN research in the future before you start making statements out of left field, like that!!!  We don’t HAVE any WEIGHT LOSS pills!!!
Then bashing the BMW program&amp;telling people they will get RICH, because nobody has heard of this, but everyone wants it ,,,…???!!!???  Brother…..WHAT ROCK HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING UNDER????
FYI - last quarter, over 1,750 people EARNED their BMW bonus!!!!!!!!!!!
and this MONTH (January) we will have 100,000 BRAND NEW people JOIN the CHALLENGE!!!!
Sorry you are hurting, dude! I truly hope you find something positive in your life, soon.

OK…I just read down through some of these comments.  This will be the only time I WASTE my time on what I am quite certain would be a physically“larger than the average bear”….most FAT people are afraid.  They have failed before, or are afraid of failing, or are lazy. straight facts….I can make this presumption from the info I just gleened from the amazing nutritional statements just made in the comments I just read!!!  A LOT of ignorant statements.
A glass of milk does NOT have anywhere near the amount of protein (or the quality) of a Visalus shake.  Visalus burns FAT because it“siates”your blood…milk, choclate milk doesn’t….it actually increases MUCUS formation in the body, inhibiting ideal absorption in the small intestines.  I am a proud Cheesehead from Wisconsin who eats tons of dairy, as it is good for your body, none the less.
I can get into the rest, byut not now.
Visalus IS THE REAL DEAL…they stand behind it 100%.  get all your money back if it doesn’t work for you….nuff said
 Lawrence 
same old.
 Lawrence 
Ok I deal with this misconception all the time with my clients. The only way to burn fat is with a very gradual decrease in calories and obviously physical activity. UNDER BEST DIETARY CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WILL LOSE 60% FAT 40% MUSCLE. When you lose weight you are actually losing body mass(muscle and fat). There are all sorts of metabolic reasons for this. Mainly survival. Your body will strive hardest to retain fat over muscle.
To retain the most muscle and burn the most fat. Your diet needs to be well balance between carbs, fat and protein. You need fat in your diet to keep burning fat. Carbs are“protein sparing”which means they prevent you from burning your protein as energy. Thus it can be used to retain muscle.
NO SUPPLEMENT CAN CLAIM TO BUILD MUSCLE AND BURN FAT. To do this you must adjust your diet slowly..Or you will dump muscle. If i was to use a replacement shake I would want one with higher calories and more carbs. Visalus provides whey protein ( as does every other supplement) But low carbs, very low calories. That 22 grams of whey protein is being burned as energy. thus you will lose more muscle and retain more fat.

In some cases I actually have to increase my clients calories to get them to gain lean mass and drop fat.
 Lawrence 
The chocalate milk analogy was to point out the absurdity of this..Cmon People!
 corporateamericasucks 
those are ADD ons, you dont need them. The shake fills you up. You saying an entire product line is needed for 1 meal? I understand for some reason you are bitter but like i already stated, throwing out insane numbers and facts that we BOTH know are incorrect doesent help your position at all. It makes you look like your bashing something you know very little about.
 corporateamericasucks 
over at least 2,000 different shakes posted online. Any supplement is the same over and over. 10k promoters join a month, over 80k customers, all dealers no customers like you said shows you have done no research on what your speaking of. All on the shelf products which you say are legit we are either a little cheaper or right on price point with.

We can do that by the simple concept of mlm, millions and millions saved from tvs ads put into pockets of people. You have 30 days to get your money back, product can be 100% empty. I’ve had 1 person do it, zero issues. You are lumping us in with all the other companies in the industry, not realizing the reasons were growing how we are is because WERE NOT like the other companies in the industry.
 corporateamericasucks 
yes thats correct, just let the majority of people you know hit the drive thru, it all the same right? lol

customers get it free, reps can to or pay $29 a month to get 6 different websites used for business. I run my biz through this. Is that too expensive???? 29 a month????

I’m going to start a new thread since all of you refuse to answer a very simple question…..

For those of you that say Visalus is a scam, WHAT EXACTLY are you calling a scam? DO NOT reference other companies and what they do because they are just that, other companies.

so please let me know when you say this is a scam, what are you referring to? thanks, i will respond to all that are serious, if you just say stupid things i will allow you to sit in the corner and be stupid. :)

Lets try to be productive people

$450 a day, a week, a month or a year per rep? Are the majority of reps in your organization making money or losing money? 3 out of 4 are losing money according to your statistics.
 integrity 
the“add ons”are products sold by you and recommended as part of the visalus package.  Protein shakes are not satisfying to“fill you up”, at least after the placibo effect wears off.

I’m not bitter at all, and I state facts and have a lot of knowledge regarding health, fitness and visalus.

I am not“bashing”I am simply stating the facts as I know them, as I witness them and as I see them.

You know what you want to know, and that is ok, I’m not going to call you names or say you are bitter towards me for having a different view on it all.

This blog is open to everyone, yet visalus blogs are closed to people with different opinions….and the only reason for that is most are brainwashed and you don’t want other opinions (and my opinion is just as important as yours) thrown out.
 integrity 
First, I don’t believe we are refusing to respond…we have been explaining our opinions right along, yet you feel the need to dig in order to try to defend what you are doing.

It is a scam to work hard to convince another person they should buy a product they don’t need in order to fullfill your agenda.  The agenda is the hopes of getting rich, by getting others to buy a product they don’t need under you, and the agenda is to win prizes and“get rich”.

The“product”is nothing but protein powder.  There are many and you can’t compare any protein powder to another, they are all different.  You are just preaching what you have been taught.

There are NO ingredients in ANY protein powder that causes weight loss, health cures etc.  You lead people to believe things that are not true, which is a scam.  Nobody would be interested in this product if there were no prizes etc.  That is why this is a scam, and hurtful to target the health industry.

People who are willing to spend money on a product they don’t need in order to lose weight, are ready to take the step in learning proper nutrition and exercise.

People can get free advice and lose weight for free, and claiming a person needs visalus to become healthier is a scam.

When you lose weight, you“feel great”, your health issues improve like coming off blood pressure medication etc….. it is NOT because of visalus, like sellers claim it to be and that is a SCAM.

Testimonials from sellers are really just a sales pitch and that is a scam.  There are a lot of unhealthy and uneducated people selling  visalus and giving advice regarding health and nutrition and that is a scam and dangerous!

I found numbers directly from blythe. They arent quite the same visalus claims.
 Egg Nog 
I would add to your reply Integrity that those who are comfortable lying to people (especially to family and friends) or those who don’t see anything wrong with implying that their product is a miracle cure (but never actually say it outright), will not be able to see this as a scam.  They can’t see it because that’s the way they operate by taking advantage of gullible and trustworthy people and stressing the“we are family”aspect of the ViSalus brand.

When I keep seeing posters asking“where’s the scam?”after it has been blogged here over and over again, I can only conclude that these people are blinded by their own lies and as long as some money is rolling into their pockets, they figure it must all be above board and perfectly legitimate.
 Lawrence 
I spoke to my friend today who tried to recruit me probably…2 years ago. Hes really slowed down with Visalus. Doesnt talk about it as much. Still has his job he told me was ready to quit 2 years ago. Hes made little to no money. BUT hes back to being himself again. Dont get me wrong hes still in Visalus, but the hype is gone.
Hes areally good guy. My college roomate. He graduated Magna Cum Laude, He has worked extensively in sales. But made very little money if any with visalus. My point is. I think he realizes he was taken in by unrealistic promises and out of many people i know he would be one who I would think could succeed.
 corporateamericasucks 
Yes, most of you have if you look back i asked for examples and pretty much got none, most that were offered were referring to other companies like i stated.

I don’t need to defend what im doing, i do however need to address people that throw out words with no clue of what they are talking about(as you will also see by looking back at prior posts).

My agenda was to lose 25lbs, i did it. Others saw that had a agenda or goal like mine and wanted to know what i did. I agree that many products are“add ons”and not needed such as wine bottles filled with berry juice for $150 a month added to a budget. But a meal replacement is not an add on and if you look around you at people you will see its very much needed. That is not even worth going back and forth. Just turn on the tv or look around and you will see a MAJOR need.

Wealth is not a bad thing for people to chase it stimulates their local econ, this is not now nor has ever been bad. Just because you don’t see the need for something does not make it a scam, that is severely small minded. Do you consider Jenny Craig, weight watchers, nutri systems, p90x scams?

The product is a meal replacement, not a protein powder. You keep saying that which leads me to believe you dont know the difference. If you dont that you can learn on your own, i assume your an adult im not here to teach you about that. You can learn or not that choice is up to you. But there is a BIG BIG difference.

Our product only claim is to provide you the vitamins minerals and proteins you would get in a nutritious meal, and to stay full for the same amount of time. THATS IT!!!!!

We dont claim people NEED us, but we do say if you know you need to go a different direction we are a great first few steps. We help them get in better shape and learn to make better eating choices and grow that into lifestyle choices that stay with them much longer then 90 days. Whatever results happen after that are from the results of their personal choices, most of which would not started without visalus. Call it what you want, a lot of peoples health and wellness is improving due to us helping them take the first few steps.

Your last paragraph, that is NO different then every growing company in the country. That is the only part i partially agree with you on, but once again that is not a VISALUS problem, thats an industry one.

Like i stated earlier most of what you say is not visalus specific, except you see no value in meal replacement or supplements. And thats fine, its your opinion but NOTHING you said makes visalus a scam. A few people saying things you dont agree with is a way of life, not a scam.
 corporateamericasucks 
Egg nog, you are saying that because you cannot produce anything real. Your the only one whos stuck to their imagination. 3 years ago i viewed Visalus as the same as most in the industry, the concept of the challenge has changed all that.

WHILE MOST ARE SAYING IT WONT WORK WERE BREAKING RECORDS, BUSINESS ONES AND WEIGHT LOSS ONES.

Daily i have people thanking me for results and helping them take the first step, i guess these are all BS results then right? lol
 integrity 
you keep going in circles and are not hearing what is being said.  Visalus was indeed the topic of my post to you, and I knew during each key stroke what you were going to say in return, but I figured I’d share my thoughts with you, even though you don’t really want to hear them.

You try to make points by throwing out statements that have no bearing on what I said, or what we are talking about. I didn’t say anyting about anything other than visalus, and you then start asking me questions about other products and companies, which has nothing to do with the conversation.

You avoid the points that are being made, by talking about things that were not even in the discussion.

People get results when they lose weight, not because of a product.  YES it is a protein shake, there is protein and vitamins in it, which is what is in all protein shakes.  If you prefer calling a“meal replacement”that is even more absurd.  Meals should never be replaced, they should be eaten and enjoyed.  Visalus does not replace proper food nutrition.

Since you like throwing out random comparisons, maybe you will understand this one:

TOOTHPASTE- we all use it to brush our teeth.  Our teeth all get clean.

BUT I bet we do not all use the same toothpaste. But some people will say theirs is the best, even though mine does the job.

The more you brush your teeth, with any toothpaste, the cleaner your teeth will be. And guess what, my dentist recommends my toothpaste, and it’s guaranteed on the box.

Same goes for visalus…except it’s an exageration of the truth…for the personal agenda to win prizes and hopes of getting rich.

The less crap you put into the body the better it will feel. BUT it IS NOT because of a shake. It is because people have stopped eating crap.

You are not breaking any records, but what you make of it.  People lose weight and get healthy all over the world every day, before visalus and without visalus.

If you lost weight and people asked you how you did it, you told them visalus because you wanted them to buy it from you.

You have no idea what I know about this“company”and a lot of the people involved.  You do not know my background.  I can tell you I am a healthy, educated working person.

Your last sentence needs some correction:

I never said that people who disagree with me are scamming people.  You asked me what my opinion was regarding why I thought visalus was a scam.  Again, to me, visalus is a product that is not needed,  is being pushed on people, by people who have the agenda behind the sale to get people under them in order to win money and prizes.  When you market a product in that way it is a scam.  Especially when an unhealthy person can suddenly become an“expert”on health and nutrition the day they decide to sell this…..someone who was desperate one day and now claiming to have all the knowledge in the world to sell this product.  People get into this for the prizes and $$$.

Nobody could pay me to be a person that would spend my precious time trying to convince another person to buy something they do not need.
 integrity 

visalus doesn’t do anything but cut your calorie intake.  There are no specific ingredients that cause any weight loss or benefits.

You can lose weight without spending money and by saving money by not buying so much food or junk food.

I have people thank me every day for my kind words and help that I give of myself, because it is genuine and sincere.

I can’t imagine saying to my family, friends or strangers…hey let me tell you how I can help you…now get your credit card out…
 corporateamericasucks 
well you sure do spend a lot of your precious time researching something that you care little about, so it cant be to precious. Also, your comments show 1 thing. you do not believe in meal replacement, so you would be against any meal replacement.

What you do not believe in is your right, and good for you. Not sure what your looking for with the toothpaste talk. But months before i made a penny from visalus i was very very happy with my results which i shared, at the time for zero monetary gain.

But now i do it because i dont ever want to go back to my salaried position in corp america where i get paid for 40 hours and work 60-65. My time is precious to me, and i must speak up when people talk down on how i support my family.
 corporateamericasucks 
you stay full, you dont eat when not needed, you save calories. you lose weight. this is not difficult

if he realized that then why wouldnt he totally sever ties and quit??? The misconception many of you non networkers have is simple….The legit fulltime networker HATES the scumbags far more then you ever could. Your buddy might of failed, did he work the system or because hes smart try it his own way? there are so many factors in every success fail equation. What unrealistic promise was he told? was he told do this and get this and he didnt get it???? or did he not get the results and consider that failure? If a 24 hour fitness closes by you its not a scam, it just didnt work.
 integrity 
basically you asked for someone to share their opinion but you didn’t really want to hear it.  It was only for you to try to“sell”us on your thinking.

Why do I need to replace meals I eat them.  I am against the marketing behind visalus.

the same can be done with eating food. You are posting on a site that is not agreeing with you, you don’t like what we are saying, it shouldn’t matter to you.  Your blogs are blocked for sellers only, yet you were welcome to come here.

PS. this is not about“meal replacements”it is about scamming people into thinking they need to buy a certain product in order to gain something that can be gained in ways without spending money.

Instead of responding to what people say, you go on about things that were never brought up or mentioned.  And it is repeated by all sellers. Same chant, different person. Not original.

It’s all about NETWORKING PEOPLE!!! If you can not do a simple NETWORKING system then maybe you shouldn’t do NETWORKING at all! It’s NOT that hard to do NETWORKING! YES I said“NETWORKING”! That’s all its about. How you work it that is on you! Now, for those people who down NETWORKING is because they tend to FAIL at it! So what’s the next step they will do is literally talk down a company in all ways possible! I’ve been in many different MLM companies and some of them are not as easy as they say it is. If it’s SIMPLE then do it! If you think it is going to be hard then don’t start it! Now, why in the world would you start  ViSalus off with the most expensive package if you cannot afford it or know you really do not know a lot of people in the first place?? FIRST OFF…. VISalus is NOT A SCAM! It’s like as MOST MLM Companies a“NETWORKING”Process! AND…ALL MLM COMPANIES ARE NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!! There is ONE out there for each person.. VISalus might not be for you…obviously as we can see through the threads posted on here! I can sit here and name a bunch of MLM companies and say they are ALL SCAMS but they are not because of the fact that every single one of them have their own way of putting their products out there! So SHAME ON ALL OF YOU WHO LITERALLY DOWN ANY MLM COMPANY OUT THERE!!!
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Awesome article by Secret Entourage: MLMs (including Visalus) in a nutshell:

It is no surprise to anyone that unemployment is high and that
opportunities in corporate America are not what they were 5-7 years ago
during our booming economy. What you may not have known is the number of
multi-level marketing (MLM) companies out there that take advantage of
these times to take your money, time, and effort in exchange for a false
promise.

We did reviews of these scams over the past two years where we covered:
Primerica Scam, 5Linx Scam, Mona Vie Scam and Visalus Scam
throughout our site. Surprisingly they all have significant amount of
comments to go with them showing the 1000’s of delusional people saying
it is a legitimate business while another 1000 scammed people say
otherwise. It truly is comical in nature but yet sad for society.

Today, we are going to break down how to identify such scams and making sure you do not fall for the traps.

Most MLM companies want you to believe that their business is a
legitimate business and will use a few components to create buy-in
(credibility) and get your hard earned dollars.

1. The celebrity or millionaire tie in: Many MLM’s
use celebrities, athletes, and millionaire to prove their business is
legit. Simply put, why would a smart millionaire or even billionaire
endorse a business if it wasn’t a great business. Everybody wants to
make money which is why you are contemplating joining to begin with, but
those with deep pockets are the ones who have made large amounts of
money by allowing companies to use their names, just so that you can
give your money and make those on top even more money. Celebrity tie ins
have been used for years in business and are a great way to get you to
pay up but reality is that those celebrities, regardless of what they
say, are not working at the bottom feeding those on top and have already
been paid a lot more than you will working 80 hrs a week. Be wary as
legitimate businesses DO NOT need to use such strategies to sell
themselves to employees which is the perfect example of how MLM
companies think of you as their customers, not employees.

2. The self employed approach: Every MLM out there
claims that it is an opportunity for you to own your own business but
yet in reality, you work for others. The idea is they cut you checks
which means you are not your own boss, they give you 1099’s which means
you depends on their corporation to pay you, and they expect you to work
certain hours, do certain activities, etc.. The idea here is their lack
of liability on you, so they don’t have to regulate what you do or
don’t do or when you lie and cheat people out of money. They simply
legally can allow to slide by while making money.

3. The disclaimer or disclosures: This our favorite
by far as its entire purpose is to be truthful but yet all it is says is
the exact opposite of anything you have been told by the reps of that
company. The disclosure or disclaimers on all these sites usually will
tell you that you are not employed by that company and that no support
will be provided in any legal matter, even if directly linked to the
product. It also states that most of the reps earn close to nothing in
salaries. Its all in the fine print and they do a great job hiding it on
their site or their paperwork.

4. Pay to join: The majority of MLMs will have some
sort of entry fee or mini purchase amount. Primerica and 5Linx expects
you to pay to join and they do a great job at telling you that this
covers expenses they incur while others like Visalus or MonaVie will
require you to purchase a minimum amount of their products as a starting
point. Both of those models profit them, and despite what they say
about needed licensing fees, etc, consider the following: Primerica’s
top revenue maker is its $99 entry fee and 5Linx’s fees in order to sell
for them contradict their fine print which says that you don’t work for
them. The other system which includes buying a minimum amount of
products actually makes you the company’s base client. When was the last
time you paid to join a job, when was the last time the job required
you to buy what they sell as a minimum to work there. It simply makes no
sense and spells out SCAM.

5. The false promise: Follow the money folks… People
in all those companies claim to make millions and have helped other
make millions but yet have nothing to show for it. They claim they make
money yet drive crappy cars, live in apartments, and best of all will
never reveal their W2 or 1099’s simply because they never made any real
money but rather made less money than a guy working in corporate America
in 5 years. We have asked over a dozen agents from Primerica, 5Linx and
Visalus for some 1099’s and have received nothing in the past 2 years
and yet constantly argue that they make money. Simply pathetic. We even
met a guy at Primerica who claimed to make $30,000 a month and yet wore a
$100 suit, lived in a van and smelled homeless but yet he made $30,000 a
month… WOW… Do you really want to belong to that crow of elite idiots?

These 5 indicators should be enough to keep away from these scams but
perhaps you need more proof that these are a joke. We understand that
many want to believe they are meant for greater than they currently are
doing, and we agree with that, but these MLM scams prey on that idea as
well as those unemployed looking for that big break. If you do decide to

Shame on you for missing the point. It’s not visalus or mlm…it is about scamming people into thinking they need to buy a product they don’t need.

I think just the opposite most of the people that fail at networking as you call it blame themselves. Because that’s what they were told in their training. Most just write it off as a bad investment and fail to realize they are victims.

lol no. nice round number though. MLM companies dont have to put out official numbers like normal corporations do.

Just go to ViSalus main page and check out the 1hr video from the Orlando“Conference”–2nd lady and mom are brought on stage to make Ryan’s case for the health aspect. Mom tells us that ViSalus cured her type2 diabetes in several months! Ryan Blair hugs her and says how wonderful it is!
That is my real evidence, I didn’t make it up, go look for yourself. Yes, maybe she changed her eating habits and food choices, she started exercising, she lost weight and in combination with the ViSalus these things changed her condition.  Of course we also need to take into account that she is“in”on the scamming, so she deliberately exaggerated the details to make it look like ViSalus is a miracle cure. But the direct chemical/physiological connection between the shakes and her diabetes is a lie . . . and that’s what she is selling and that’s what Ryan Blair is selling!
Naturally nobody actually says“ViSalus will cure type2 diabetes”because that would be a lie, but what is somebody listening to this testimonial supposed to think . . .“well it must be a great product because it cured type2 diabetes”. . . what else?
I really can’t make my position any more clear for you. I don’t understand the majority of the rest of what you wrote, and the bold lettered ViSalus cheer is just their own propaganda.

Everyone touched on how its netWORKing business, and not for everyone.  Im gonna touch on the Regional Director level.  The will give you $600mth as long as you maintain RD, if your working residules should always keep you there no sweat.   If you chose not to get a BMW you can get $300mth.  Your right you on you are responsible for getting your own car though.  Visalus at this date is awarding 28 BMWs a day, in 3 colors!  BMW asked if we would add more colors and they do something special.  In 2012 they added a Visalus Green car for us.  We now can buy a black slilver or green BMW.  You can buy one with no payment or 200 or 2000mth payment dont matter you get 600mth.  I was able to buy one with my crap credit at 10K so my payment is well below 600, Im pocketing the extra.  You dont have to buy brand new, it must be 10 years or newer.  Plus the BMW level is at the second level in the company, what other company does that!?

your scamming people so you can get a car, by selling products people don’t need

If I want to buy a car I can go buy one with my money with no strings attached.  I would not want a copycat car.  I like being original, and not having to prove myself and a car does not define me as a person.

This visalus fad looks like a bunch of robots all programmed walking around in a world they created that revolves around a protein powder.  Snap snap snap out of it! The world does not revolve around visalus.

I have never been healthier in my life with such ease. I also have not been sick even with the common cold since Ive started this product. I also have many people around me that have had the same effects and more, including matching their income in Visalus commission, having a BMW paid for by Visalus and just overall happiness. How you use this product is your choice you are not forced to sell it and it cost money like any other weight loss  program but less. When it comes down to it if you haven’t tried it for at least 3 months you don’t have the first clue to be calling it a scam or anything at that matter.  I hardly sell any of the product and i have yet to loose any money i pay for what i use and that’s all, and just for getting 3 others to start a diet which they were whether it was Visalus or not i now get my kit for free, and if i didn’t i would still pay for it.

If you really wanted to get healthy then you’d start off by eating healthier with real fruits and vegetables. Funny how none of you distributors push the natural way first.
 integrity 
We are not interested in buying here…and you come preaching your“sale”…can any of you have a conversation without talking about bmw’s and your income?

And what does you“not being sick or not getting a cold”have to do with visalus?  Are you claiming visalus prevented that?  I certainly hope not!

There are no ingredients in any protein powder that cause weight loss, or health benefits.  When a person cuts junk food out of their diet and start exercising, they will lose weight and feel better.  It is not and should never be quoted as visalus being the reason.

People have been feeling great and losing weight long before visalus.  There is a small cluster of V-Bots roaming around, but many more realistic people that know better than to spend their time talking about a protein shake.

anyone in here work out?? any one ever use whey or creatine or any kind of suppliment visalus is the same, and just like ANY other product it is sold to make money, if its a scam because its being sold to people that dont need it go tell walmart they are scamming people for buying tvs or videos games or ANY thing thats not food water or something to do with shelter and keeping you warm because its not NEEDED, also yes you dont have to take it to lose weight and yada yada but its something that will help make it a little healthier carve out more calories, FYI i dont sell it and i dont take it but its just like any other company any other product that is trying to be successful isnt that the name of the game, oh hey let me just give you this so i can LOSE money and not run a bussiness, how do we know you are just bashing visalus so you can help the competition
 integrity 
You are missing the point….we are talking about people (mostly unhealthy and uneducated) going around telling people lies and exagerating the truth, in order to get them to buy it.

If I go to Walmart I go in private, with nobody telling me what I should or should not buy.  When I buy something I don’t have to tell anyone what I bought.  And why does anyone need to know what brand of shampoo I use or what brand of bread I buy.

When it comes to health products an uneducated and unhealthy person should not be preaching to others about nutrition and talking about a protein powder like it is holy water.

There are no ingredients in any protein powder that cause weight loss or help cure health problems.  There are people out their lying to people and saying whatever they have to in order to get a sale, because the whole agenda is not health (that is the word they hide behind), the agenda is about the dream of getting rich and winning prizes.

I know first hand about this, and I know many people who are involved and many more who are no longer involved.  I am a healthy person and want  people to think before they hand someone their credit/debit card for a protein shake scam.

If someone really wants to fast and drink a shake, there are many out there that don’t lock you into a scheme.  This is going to fade away like every other MLM, but why waste your time and money now.  Save it.  Save your friends.  If you want to get healthy cut out junk food and exercise.  That alone will save you money.  You don’t need visalus.

If i buy creatine at GNC. The clerk does not try to charge 125$ and get me to recruit others to sell creatine. Can you imagine how weird that would be. Nobody would set foot in GNC.

Thanks for your post. If I may….How many in your downline?
 corporateamericasucks 
I had a job most people in my area would die for. I made 6 figures, traveled the country, made all sorts of great friends and didnt have a boss down my back because my results spoke for themselves.

The issue was i got tired of smacking my head on the glass ceiling, as many in corp america do. I just decided i could do better.

I believe in myself and my skills and went for it. What most want to do but dont have the backbone to, i did. It worked, most of people on here have failed because they didnt try, they didnt have what it takes and wont ever accept something could be their fault. Its much easier to point the finger and put the blame on someone else.

Visalus is the best vehicle out there that i have seen for someone looking to make a change.

I stated a decking company down south on the side a few years ago. It cost me 23k to get the ball rolling, i had it in the bank and didnt need any loan. How many people today could get a loan for that?

$49-$999 to start up, and get the same tax advantages i had with my traditional business and thats a scam lol.

Misinformed people on here are calling names and yelling warnings, but we cant slow down to listen because were far too busy moving in the right direction.

the 90 day challenge is doing much more for people then most of you realize. I keep seeing eat more fruit and veggies and exercise….DO YOU THINK YOUR THE FIRST TO OFFER THIS GROUNDBREAKING ADVICE?????

People need to change their habits and thats what we help them with, its far more then a meal replacement.
 corporateamericasucks 
Lawrence you hate mlm, not visalus but mlm as an industry. I cannot understand with this hatred why you spend so much time researching and talking about it?

You have mentioned a few times you have been running a gym for years and years(20-30???) you might need to just accept(not like or be ok with, but accept) that times are changing.

MLM has never had the talent going to it that it has currently(thanks shitty econ) which is why a company like this is having the result it is, makes too much sense for most people to not give it a try as a customer.

People work out by pressing play on a p90x video, instead of hiring a personal trainer. Do you not upsell at your gym? Do you not try to get people to pay for services they prob should use but dont need to? And cut the GNC talk, over half the crap in there it totally overpriced, whats the product markup at your gym? 35%-40%, sounds like a pyramid product markup lol!!!

It’s also very funny to me that this website trashed a company with total BS about a car program but uses visalus to build hits for these stupid ebooks. Visalus giving a person $3,600-$7,200 a year for a car is a scam but you should buy a $10 how to drive a bentley for free lol. really?
 corporateamericasucks 
I’m healthy and educated more then most, is it acceptable for me to promote these products??? Are before and after pics lies and exaggerated truth??? Were you an amway rep 30 years ago that still has a garage full of products and a trunk full of tapes?

How are customers locked into a scheme?
 integrity 
Nobody should be promoting this product.
99% of the“before”pictures are taken WAY before and the“after”pictures just current pictures that look better than the befores.  I know some guys who push their guts out, then suck in.  Then they lie and say how much weight they lost.
YES before and after pictures lie and exaggerate.
If someone is losing lots of weight very fast, it is UNHEALTHY and definately should not be encouraged.
If someone is losing weight it is not because of visalus, it is because they are restricting their calorie intake from their junky before diets.  All that can be done w/out visalus.  Visalus does not have ANY ingredients that cause weight loss.  Weight loss does cause health benefits, and claiming health benefits come from visalus is a scam.
 integrity 
When people go to his gym, it is on their free will, and if he is in business he has plenty of clients.  They go in and do their thing and leave.

It’s quite lazy thinking to believe drinking a shake is the way.  It is not easy to get healthy, and people claiming to be“healthy, and energetic and blah blah”two days after starting the programming….that is scheming people.
 integrity 
I’d like to see visalus blogs open to the public! They call us“negative”,“dream killers”, and other names.  Yet they are so innocent but judge others.  Obviously they feel threatend that they can not fool everyone, but themselves.

There are no ingredients in visalus that cause weight loss or improve health conditions. Claiming that their“product”is the reason is a scam.

Food is healthy, exercise is key and the fact that a person can wake up one day and claim to know everything about health and fitness is scary!

That is why they have“training seminars”…..to give the sellers phrases and comebacks.  It’s training alright…brainwashing! I wish they could see outside themselves.

Hi all.
Ive been using Vi Shakes for the last 4 months and it is great! I do not sell this stuff, nor have I even thought of getting mixed up in the marketing of this product, but I am a consumer. I mix up my shake in the morning for breakfast which takes all of 2 minutes. It is delicious, and with the help of a small snack a mid-morning, it is all i need to get me to lunch time without hunger feeling.

Everything i am reading here is directed at the marketing of this product, and nothing to talk about the actual product. It provides me  with the fiber, carbs and protein i need to get through a morning, which i wasnt getting when i was eating cereal and what not for breakfast. Vi is a good option for people who would normally wait in a line for a breakfast sandwich or people who wouldnt eat breakfast at all.

and for the price, i get approx 60 meals for 100 bucks. Thats good for me.

My suggestion–use and try this product, but do not get mixed up into the marketing world of it. and that isnt because of Visalus itself..i would say that about any chain marketing idea!
 http://profile.yahoo.com/3I2BPTRGV5NVEO5IHTAST6KKLM Steve H 
What about the product itself? I couldnt care less about the marketing aspect. I will be a final consumer and that is it. Judging by the ingredients and nutritional information, this is a good breakfast option for me.
 Guesty 
12 g protein, 7g carbs, 5g of fiber…nothing to improve health conditions? You either get that stuff here, or eat something else, whats the difference?
 Lawrence 
Corp. Im only 41 years old. Ive owned the gym for 7 years. My formal education is in teaching. Times have been changing ever since I got into the business. One thing that is timeless is that companies will try to get rich quick without selling a product of real value. I have no hatred for visalus. But im in the business so i know how ridiculous the claims are. In that sense visalus is in no way new. They are the old way. If EAS products( 300 million a year). sold with this hype. I would be just as critical. Because supplemnts by definition are avery small part of getting in shape. They sell in stores so they dont have to be so rediculous in there marketing. Tony Little did a 100 million dollars in sales in his first year of the FITNESS FLYER on qvc. I thought that product was kind of stupid too, but again there not on a huge recruitment campaign. Its“take it or leave it”
BTW im a pretty good salesman. I made almost as much on membership commisions as I did in personal training, when I first started out. I bet I made alot more than most people in Visalus in there first year. But who knows Because you only get to hear CLAIMS.
Im not upset at all about losing clients to P90x. Its a good program. Nor am I upset if people equip a home gym.
when you get in the gym business noone tells you your gonna be a big success. Your gone have members lined up out the door, and Im gonna make ten thousand a month within a year. They say good luck your gonna need it. Its a tough business. Most non chain gyms go under very quickly. But that is the real world.
Visalus recruits 20 somethings from the EVERYTHING NOW generation who really think the world works that way. Dont get me wrong. Many, Many smart, people from this generation. They are fighting and dying for our country. But for the majority of these visalus promoters I think they are in for a rude awakeining.
 Lawrence 
He still holds out hope. I guess. if a 24 hour fitness closed, of course its not a scam. Let visalus compete directly. maybe it will work maybe not.
 Lawrence 
Visalus is growing quickly now because of the 90 day challenge. That will slow up, and eventually saturate. Mallon Sarnicola Blair know this Im sure. As do all PRO mlmers. Then they will go with another startup, bringing there extensive downlines. The vast majority of promoters will not make money by that time.
 Lawrence 
one thing that will never change. NOTHING LASTING WILL EVER COME QUICK OR EASY
 Lawrence 
I dont really upsell. Training business has always been successful. I hardly ever take on new clients. Im to busy. The only thing they would not need is our suppliments. But I dont push them because I dont make money on it anyway, and They dont do much.
Regarding supplements. I learned there true value the hard way. when iwas a competitive Bodybuilder. At first i supplemented. Then quickly realized your peeing out vitually everything that went in. Spending money for nothing.
 Daddys-boy-blair 
And let’s not forget that the CEO of visalus is convicted criminal with a serious daddy complex–who, left to his own morals, had no problem committing felonies and only sees the light after his mom get picked up by a rich guy

You really what to be following that?
 Elizzyp 
Visalus got a big boost when they started the BMW program but when people find out what it is all about then it starts falling off and they move on to another area. Before the BMW program it wasn’t doing anything but loosing money. Product hasn’t changed so guess it was all about getting the BMW.
 Elizzyp 
It is a lot like Carnation Breakfast drink only Carnation is bought in the store and is cheaper.  Usually can find coupons also on it.
 Elizzyp 
Getting it from food alot more healthy and cheaper and satisfying.
 Elizzyp 
They are like a cult always on the defensive.
 Elizzyp 
I have not seen anyone on this blog trying to sell anything else.  With Visalus you have to pay to sell it, recruit people to sell, take on all of the lexpense of selling it.. The target is your friends and families because you are the one who can get to them.  You are encourage to make outregous claims of health benefits, weight lost, and money made.  How is it not a scam.
 Elizzyp 
Also they would charge you $500 or $1000 for that priviledge.
 Elizzyp 
But if don’t sell enough creatin you get to pay for the BMW that they“put you in”
 Elizzyp 
You forgot to tell them to get that money you have to sell $12,500 of their product each and every month. and have three people under you.  That is just a minor detail uh.  That you have to sign the lease and get it on your credit and if you don’t sell enough the lease is all yours. Visalus never has any exposure for their sellers. Great company doesn’t even recognize people who sell their crap for them.
 Elizzyp 
Using common sense you would have to know the product has to be really cheap or they could not afford to give all the Visalus people claim they do.
 Elizzyp 
How healthy and educated are you saying most are? Give me an example to go from.  Yes before and after pictures do lie.  Come on you know this Do you really think all those models really look like their picture say they do? You are not that niave are you. Speaking of that garage you just saw your future!  Most cutomers are sellers or future sellers if Visalus have their way.  Ah come on you know that….dont you????
 Elizzyp 
You are so right.  Most of these people no matter their age just have not had the life experiences to see through these scams. Most mean well their moral compass has just got off track.
 Elizzyp 
You poor thing how sick were you before. I know you have been brainwashed and are now deludion but yopu will wake up but just a warning you are going to be in for a rude awaken and guess what a BMW lease payment.  sorry…..
 Elizzyp 
You are delusional Visalus does not award anything.  You have to earn the payment by selling $12,500 each and every month or the lease is yours to pay Visalus doesn’t take responsibilty for this leas.  Get real.  They don’t care what kind of BMW you get because they don’t take any responsibilty for it.  It is much easier to get the car and the title than it is to keep it.  Visalus doesn’t care about you.

you can get protein, healthy carbs and fiber from many satisfying foods……rather eat food than powder

it is similar in a breakfast shake…different in the following ways:

-50 less calories
-0.9g more fat
- 40g less sodium
- twice as much Protein
- 21g LESS carbs
- 20g LESS sugar

so yeah..similar that you can drink in before work, but different.

thats your choice, this is mine. If that is the only problem you have with it, than wow! I find the shakes tastes good and I can make it in 2 minutes. I dont live a diet of Vi shakes…but mixing them into your daily routine is great…especially if your normal breakfast is a breakfast sandwich and coffee.
 http://profile.yahoo.com/3I2BPTRGV5NVEO5IHTAST6KKLM Steve H 
you pay 100 dollars for 60 meals…and now with new larger bags, its more like 90 meals for 100 bucks. Why all the hate? What did Vi ever do to you?
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
My main issue with the product is that it’s overpriced…you  can purchase even better products at your local grocery/health store…they’re less expensive and you don’t pay shipping…also, if you live in Canada, you have to pay the exchange when buying Visalus products. On top of that, most distributors want to put you on autoship to receive your products every month, and you end up with more product than you need, plus paying shipping and handling, plus the exchange rate (if you’re in Canada)….before you know it, you just pissed away hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (almost literally).

I’ve been off Visalus for well over a year now…I follow the P90X exercise and nutrition program (yes, I know it is also sold through MLM, but I got mine at Costco lol). I’m now in supersonic shape, healthy and strong, and have made a drastic lifestyle change in regards to my nutrition. I supplement with protein shakes now and then, and I take a multi vitamin. I don’t spend nearly as much on shakes and vitamins as someone on Visalus would. Visalus also doesn’t promote exercise or healthy eating. They just want you to consume (and keep consuming) their products.

It’s like the old saying: Give a man a fish, and he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he eats for a lifetime.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Why do you ASSume that everyone eats breakfast sandwiches and coffee for breakfast. Is this the breakfast you used to eat? Here’s an example of a breakfast I eat:

1 Mushroom omelet
1 cup of fresh strawberries
8 oz of cottage cheese

Here’s another breakfast example:

2-3 slices of turkey bacon
1 low-fat cheese scramble eggs
8 oz skim milk
1/4 cantaloupe

You just can’t get the same nutrients from a“meal replacement”shake than you get from real food. Anyone telling you otherwise is doing so because they want you to keep buying their“meal replacement”and make money off of you. But you are right, it is totally your choice.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
…plus shipping and handling, plus exchange rate if you live in Canada, plus auto-ship, plus all the add ons (flavour mix-ins, anti-aging pills, Neuro, etc)…so you need to redo your math equation.

Nobody here is hating (I love the way the Vi people always judge and label). Believe it or not, the people here are trying to help.

And I find it very hard to believe that a non-distributor would come here and attempt to defend this quasi-legal MLM company.
 Guesty 
What percentage of people eat the breakfast you just described? Its very low. Yes that is a better breakfast, but the average person isnt going through all the work it takes to research, plan and prepare those meals. You are not the average person, as you already stated you are ripped to shreds and have done P90X…so no, I am not saying everyone eats breakfast sandwices for breakfast. But a large percentage of people do. So to those people I would say, a quick and easy way to get you started to living a healthy lifestyle is Vi shakes. You cant deny the fact it contains the stuff your body needs.

All I can say is that my wife’s parents have been using Visalus products (there’s more than just the shakes) for about a year. They have both lost over 50 lbs each, they’ve become more active since changing their diets, and they say they feel way better and happier. Their friends and family have noticed this, and signed on as well, in their MLM downline so yes, my mother in law now drives a BMW. It’s working for them. I know enough about health products to know that Visalus products are very good quality. Expensive yes, but you decide if it’s worth it for yourself.

It’s great that your inlaws have lost weight, which will make a person more active and feel better and happier.  The point is“visalus”is not what causes weight loss and the positive side effects.  It is calorie restriction, which can be done without visalus.

You are right, visalus sells more than just powder, they sell more vitamins, appetite suppresents, flavor mixins, cookies, energy powder drinks….yes it certainly is expensive, and money that does not have to be spent.

I don’t care what kind of car people drive.  I don’t find the need to tell people what kind of car I drive, or what protein shake I drink, or what shampoo I use etc….  I am not against having a protein shake as I drink them.

There are no ingredients in a protein shake that cause weight loss or people to“feel great”etc….

It is not worth it to me to exagerate products, and scheme people into buying a product, just for the agenda of winning a prize and hoping I get rich.

There is a lot of free advice out there.  Proper nutrition is not complicated and exercise is key.  True thing-when you lose weight you do“feel great”and“get more energy”, but it is not because of a product, it is because a person has restricted their caloric intake.
 integrity 
This is not the place to try and“recruit people”.
We are offering free advice and trying to help people.  Should we be charging people 200.00 or 1000.00 for our experiences and input?  Maybe you would agree with that more?  I’m not angry.  I’m very happy, energetic and healthy with a fullfilling life.  Sounds like you are angry at us for speaking the truth.
 integrity 
Your questions are pointless. Sounds like you have been to a few“training”groups.

People can not instantly wake up and start selling a product and claim to know what they are talking about.  They only know what they have been told to talk about.

Your community is very small compared to our community.  It’s ok to choose whatever path you want.  It may be easy to follow someone else, but it will lead you to a dead end eventually.  Good luck.

Thank you for the real review. I typed in Body by Vi reviews and started reading the first result only to learn it was actually a distributor who made it seem like it was a real unbiased review but then went into trying to sell the product. It took me 4 Google pages to get to you, as the other reviews were set up the same way. So they are buying keywords such as review, reviews, complaints etc. only to confuse. Just knowing this one thing gives me a bad impression of them. Also, I don’t see how this would be any different from Slim Fast and those other MR shakes. You stop drinking the shakes, you gain weight. Only a balanced diet and exercise can help someone lose and maintain.
 Nomorehackers 
I am not trying to recruit anyone as a matter of fact I have not even listed my visalus website.  I posted a link of a company that investigates MLM companies and what they have to say about Visalus…so that’s that!  Have a great day!  =)
 Nomorehackers 
my best friend drives the BMW too, and actually she is about to pick me up in it :)  Congrats to your family!!
 Guesty 
i would replay..but i dont make“sence”so i’ll stop.
 Guesty 
you find it hard to believe that a random person would come to defend a product these use every day? Really? well want me to tell you the truth–its exactly that! Just a consumer, having his say on the wide open internet discussion board. Dont sell it or promote it….my girlfriend wanted to sell it and I convinced her not to.

also, i do not need to redo my math equation. I can show you a copy of my credit card bill if you want. 120 dollars to get 60 meals to my door. Im perfectly okay with that.

and yes, they are meals. One shake in the morning plus a couple healthy snacks get me to lunch, and most days I have a shake for lunch which can get me to supper, in which i have my regular supper.

:) why cant you accept a positive review of this product on this message board?
 Guesty 
how is this a real review? it doesnt even mention the product itself, just the marketing. The product itself isnt even mentioned.

Hyper-consumption another tell tale sign of an mlm scam. Most legitimate businesses do not require the consumer to purchase the same product month after month.
 Nomorehackers 
Ok here goes it.  I have not drank the kool aid.  I haven’t fell for anything.  I have been in the marketing business since 2006 and I know it DOES WORK! No, I don’t believe in anything that mentions get rich quick!  Everything takes time and effort, losing weight, and making money especially.  I am doing both.  I personally know many people that I have known my entire life that Visalus has helped transform their lives.  That was enough for me.  That is what I am talking about‘community’, and trust me, it is exploding.  I don’t want to have to convince you, nor anyone.  I am in it to lose weight, and of course making money is a plus!  And I have made money before with a company I still stand behind 1 million percent. And I DO know people personally that have lost weight, making a substantial amount of money, and driving the BMW.  So this review is the scam of all.
 Nomorehackers 
and I also know plenty of people who are GAINING weight with Visalus, and  using as a body building component.
 Nomorehackers 
and not to mention are able to cut back on their prescriptions or no longer having to use..or my good buddy no longer has flare ups with Chromes disease.  Which we always tell everyone before trying the product to consult your physician! So you tell me that these people I grew up with, know and love…are actors and part of the big plan scam???
 Elizzyp 
I know plenty of people personally that lost weight went off the shake and gained more than they lost back,  I know people personally got stuck with a lot of bills trying to sell this stuff.  I know people personally that got sick taking this stuff.  I know people personally that almost got stuck with a car lease. I know people personally that made their friends and family so mad at them they didn’t even want to be around them. I knwo people personally that have come close to losing their jobs because of their preoccupation with this stuff. You are brainwashed and don’t even know it.  These people are great at brainwashing.
 Elizzyp 
here we go with the brainwashing dribble Visalus does every little thing that you could possibly want LOL
 Elizzyp 
You are delusional. Visalus grows flowers, makes the sky pink,  you’re scamming is showing.
 Elizzyp 
Good for you for recognizing it for what it is and continuing your investigation
 Elizzyp 
Can you not read or can you not comprehend what you read.  Read it again. Visalus is spelt V I S A L U S.
 Elizzyp 
Those lease payments are looming.
 Elizzyp 
You don’t know very much about health products or you would know that Visalus is a very poor quality product designed to be used as a pyramid scheme that the product is incidental. Of course your family and friends is what they want you for
 Elizzyp 
Tell your friend to save her money for when or Visalus sales stops so she can pay the lease payments.
 Ronnie 
Review of the company. The product is just another MR shake, wherein once one stops taking the shakes, they will gain back the weight they lost and possibly more.  (Think Slim Fast) It is not written by someone who sells it. To me, a company that practices business this way is not one to trust. I was wary before I searched, but the bait and switch tatic of the website I visited confirmed my wariness. Cutting calories and exercising will give the same results, at a very low cost.
 Elizzyp 
You people are the ones who have all the anger. You are such negative people hating (I love that mlm term) on anyone who is not foolish enough to fall for your scams and always always selling, don’t you ever get tired of lying about this stuff.
 Elizzyp 
Shame on you for trying to scam people all the time, don’t you get the message we figured you out along time a go.
 Elizzyp 
You don’t have to give us any dumbie links created by Visalus people.  You must really be scared and desperate always trying to divert people from the truth.
 Elizzyp 
Then you rally should grow up and quit living in LaLa land. Still trying to sell you sound so desperate.
 Elizzyp 
You are not helping people that is part of their brainwash. Scaming is not helping anyone.  That is what they tell you so you can live with yourself after scamming your family and friends. What happened to your moral compass not to know this.
 Elizzyp 
This is not these fair haired boys’first scam they learned their art through serveral before this one including a long distance one that went bottom up for everyone but them.  The Dr Steidman who came up with Visalus is a ear-nose doctor whois a self claimed specialist or rining in the ear and herbal remedies with a stained reputation of his own.

Ronnie. Google“vidsalus scam”or”visalus lies”. so much more bait and switch.

Very few supllement makers are willing to go through the time and expense of being FDA approved. We only know our bodies do not need all of this stuff and gets rid of most of it through our urine and the ones they don’t can build up and could be harmful.

I was really surprised to find out that these MLMs were even legal in Canada. Hadn’t thought much about it until I read your posts I guess I just assume since Canada is usually way ahead of the USA on social and humane issues.

Nothing they are actually trying to sell you on selling.
 Elizzyp 
If I want a protein shake I get a Boost. Open cap drink. No blender, no milk, no addins. But it is a protein shake that I occasionslly feel like having not a life style and not a meal replacement.
 Elizzyp 
Why all the negativity we aren’t  hating on you (love that term) because food is what our bodies are made to eat. I can not imagine 90 meals of a shake.  That is depressing.
 Elizzyp 
You must live a boring life. A shake everyday or even worst. I would be so bored with that. You sell it you are too defensive not to and I can not imagine anyone buying this product just to buy it, to help out a friend or family member maybe for it’s self no way.
 Elizzyp 
Your successful because you use your common sense.

The aren’t going to make any money or pay for their BMW by you eating the natural way.

I found this question posed at Yahoo and thought I would share the answer, as many state they can’t find the ingrediants. Keep in mind the answer is 4 years old and I don’t know if Visalus changed ingredients since then. It also only refers to the ViPak.

“I am only 16, an athlete, eat Ok, get plenty of excercise but am often tired and have some sports injuries. Would this stuff work for me, or anyone, or is it just a huge waste of money?
4 years ago
Best Answer–Chosen by VotersIt’s junk.

Just go to the site and you will see that it says,“all natural.”That’s not a true statement. Look at the ingredients very carefully and you will see for example, the Pine Bark Extract is only 7 mg. That’s ridiculous amount. The inventor of that product recommends a minimum of 300 mg. per day for the average size person.

The list of“Other Ingredients:”Kosher Gelatin, Glycerin, Soybean Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Pharmaceutical Glaze, Magnesium Stearate, Rice Powder, Dicalcium Phosphate and Water.

Gelatin comes from cow hooves; I’m not sure how you get Kosher Gelatin? Does the Rabbi bless it as they cut the hooves off the cows? Glycerin inhibits the absorption of nutrients. Many capsules are made of this and it has been shown that much of the nutrients in gelatin capsules never get absorbed in the body because the gelatin makes a barrier that won’t allow the absorption.

Soybean oil is genetically engineered and creates lots of problems for the body. It inhibits the absorption of minerals, especially iron (over 50%) and is loaded with goitrogens that cause the thyroid to slow down and even the drug manufacturers tell you not to use ANY soy when taking Synthroid because it interferes with the action of the drug; it’s that potent of a problem.

Titanium Dioxide is white paint. Go to your local arts and crafts store and ask them to show you a tube of white oil paint. Look at the ingredient,“Titanium Dioxide.”Bingo.

Pharmaceutical glaze? What is that? I’ve never heard of a natural product called that?

Magnesium Stearate—Now this is a really good one! Total up the total milligrams in the pill. In their multi-vitamin and mineral pill, they have 4669.8247 milligrams of chemicals in it. Multiply .05 x 4,669.8247 milligrams and that will give you the approximate total amount of magnesium stearate it contains. It is: 233.49 milligrams in each pill.

Each one of the so called“super charged antioxidants”contain 355 milligrams of the TRANS FAT–Magnesium Stearate.

The anti aging pill contains: 39.5 milligrams of TRANS FAT.

The Omega vitals contain: 80.21 milligrams of TRANS FAT.

So, if you take just one pill each of the garbage, you will get a total of: 708.2 milligrams of TRANS FAT each time you took them! This chemical is an immune suppressant.

Magnesium Stearate is a“TRANS FAT.”It inhibits the absorption of nutrients up to 80%. It is not put in the pill for your health, it is to make pill making easier for them. Each one of these pills also has a talc residue on them if they use standard pill making machinery; this is a known carcinogen. And each pill is subjected to 20,000 psi pressure to squeeze the pills into a form. This high pressure generates a lot of heat that alters the pill contents.

The rice powder is most likely a filler and made from the low grade waste in milling rice.

Dicalcium phosphate is a tableting agent. It’s an inorganic substance that was never alive and is just a chemical activator.

Water. It doesn’t say what kind of water or where they got it. Tap water? Is it purified? Don’t you think that if they went to the trouble of purifying it they would want to brag about that?

They claim this product is all natural, but that statement is obviously not true when you look at the excipient ingredients listed above with the explanations.

I suggest, unless they specifically tell you the origin of each of the ingredients, they are just synthetic vitamins. Synthetic Vitamins are not vitamins, they are chemical activators that have some of the characteristics of true, natural vitamins you find in nature. However, nature does not make just one vitamin that stands alone, it always comes in a package of cofactors and other nutrients that support it’s functions. In fact, synthetic vitamins when photographed in Kirlian photograph’s show very little light emissions, where as natural vitamins show huge bursts of light, indicating high energy values.

Additionally, the single chemical activators listed are not clearly specified as to their origins. A good example of this is the Thiamine (B-1). The synthetic origin of this is no doubt, coal tar.

When you take an individual chemical activator without it’s cofactors, the body has to give up nutrients to the make up the matrix for it to be absorbed. This depletes the body of these nutrients!

What has now been proven, to put the nail in this coffin, is that synthetic vitamins only help you a little at first, but then damage your DNA. Multi-vitamins have been shown to shorten your life, not extend it. People who take multi-vitamins live about 5% less time than those who don’t! When you damage DNA, the cells die prematurely and so you won’t live as long.

Look at all the synthetic vitamins they are putting into foods trying to make people think they are doing some good for them! Why not grow nutritious food that contains all the good nutrients instead of loading them up with garbage that shorten’s people’s lives? Profit over health. Simple economics.

The answer is obvious, this Vi-Pak is total garbage. I would not even flush them down a toilet for fear of contaminating fish. I would suggest taking them to a hazardous waste dump.

Wow, elizzyp obviously has no life…trying to shill their lame book by tearing down other companies…or trying…you’re just jealous 3,000 people a day start the 90 day challenge and you can’t sell your sad little book, you’re a pathetic worm…haha…they don’t dictate what type of BMW you get either, you buy a used one and still get $600 / month…the shakes taste good and because of 5g of fiber per serving they are filling, coupled with the vi-pak which includes an appetite suppressant i’m not hungry, and I have lost weight and made money…but that’s because I’m not a social misfit and can get out and talk to real people and not hide behind my screen and cry foul and point at the successful company and poo poo their obvious results !  go die in a fire !  you’re a hack…. hahaha
 Lawrence 
You sound like a social misfit to me.
 Nomorehackers 
And why would you stop taking the shake? Do you stop eating your steaks, or hamburgers, or desserts that you love or like?  After you lose the weight doesn’t mean that you will stop taking the shake.  And trust me, this shake is NOTHING like slim fast.  I have not heard anyone promote (and if they do I am sorry because it is not correct), that this is a miracle shake, it is a nutritional shake. It has the same amount of protein and nutrients that would take over 8,000 calories of intake to equal out to, but only has 170 calories.  Why would you want to stop drinking the shake?  It is my snack or meal replacement (of my chosing) instead of eating some fattening, like for example, my love for cool ranch Doritos! But trust me, I am not going to stop completely eating my doritos no matter how fattening they are, just not eat as much!  It tastes that great that I will give it up and replace it with as being my daily snack.  That is my choice.  Also not to mention the vita pacs..I have been on mine for two days and feel great!  I am normally a lethargic type of person and is very hard for me to get motivated and going.  Well, I couldn’t believe how great I felt this morning and got up with out even thinking about it.  And this is my second day, and even being one to hate taking pills….I am continuing to take them because I love how I feel! So again…why WOULD I stop drinking the shake and taking the vita pack?  As a matter of fact as I have been typing this, it made me hungry and I am enjoying a glass of my shake that tastes like a orange dream sickle!   My challenge is to lose my goal weight in 90 days, enjoying the products and still be able to eat my one meal of my choosing which I ate a yummy grill chicken breast and broccoli!    Also to mention, my 8 year old daughter came home from her friends last night and asked me for a snack.  So I went in the kitchen and went to get her a cookie, she said‘no mommy, I want one of those yummy shakes you made for me yesterday’.  So there is your review.
 Nomorehackers 
again true testimonies from my personal friends ;)
 Nomorehackers 
and that is unfortunate.  This isn’t for everyone and marketing isnt for every one.  and lol…no one has brainwashed me into anything. People fail at successful MLM companies all the time, unfortunately, for many reasons.  Mostly being because of their up-line going into it for the wrong reasons.  It happens all the time, and I am sure it is happening here.   I am sorry you feel this way about Visalus, but I know from being a successful marketer how to take care of my downline and make sure that they dont fail.   And I also have a full team upline that will also make sure of it as well.
 Nomorehackers 
you are putting words in my mouth.  This is their testimony not mine.  How about this? I feel great, and I will lose weight and maintain being fit and healthy which is a goal of mine and I love the product period.
 the frickin’pope 
well thanks for your keen insights there little helper !
Point is this site is trying to sell a book, yet crying about other successful companies that you / they deem as not worthwhile…It would seem a better use of your time to try to promote your book rather than attempt to bring down a huge profitable corporation…you just sound like a butthurt tween complaining you don’t have a date to the prom :(  waah….  so enjoy staying poor !  hahaha

I think it’s funny how you go into an emotional tirade about detractors of visalus and in the same paragraph quote company statistics and product ingredients. You forgot to tell me I am saving money by spending money I would spend on food and put it into my own milk shake business. Wait I don’t have a blender but I got a ninja for Christmas will that do the trick.

Guesty. thats my big problem with visalus. THEY hardly talk about the product. THEY only talk about the marketing.

A few very obnoxious sellers have thrown themselves at us again…not a very good selling point!

It shouldn’t matter if people disagree with you. At least my own thoughts and words come out of my mouth, not ones that I have been told to repeat.

Protein shakes, vitamins, flavored water/energy drinks, cookies and appetite suppressants are nothing new…it’s just another.  Nothing original.

The way these sellers go about acting like they are selling holy water from the heavens is just so wacky!

I feel bad for those who don’t know better, and who think they know what they are doing, and feel bad for those who are trapped and don’t dare to admit it.

If a person has an answer for every question asked, then there is a problem with the know it all!

It is strange your world revolves around a protein powder,
 RICH AND SKINNY 
I’d like to hear directly from those people Elizzyp. you don’t get stuck with bills you are trying to pay…you simply cancel your shipment if you don’t like the product.  if you think that going from eating big macs and processed foods all day long and going straight into eating a truly healthy diet that consists of ONE shake a day and eating the RIGHT foods in the RIGHT combinations isn’t hard on the body, your just as stupid as what you claim the our company is.  I’ve upset my sister because she is a fat lazy cow who can’t get off the couch and be a good role model for her step children, not because i’m selling VISalus and the Body By Vi Challenge.  Misery loves company.  Enjoy it.  You mention brainwashing but don’t offer any clear defined statistical data, JUST HERESAY….lol…your actually quite ridiculous.  And sounds like you probably will STAY POOR!! I’m driving a BMW that I’ve worked hard for, I stay with my customers and call them at least once a month.  I promote at the Gym I work out at, and I think that someone has you upset and there isn’t anything you can do about it, so you’ve wasted your time creating a website about it! Sad really…so anyway, i’ve WASTED enough of my time (which IS MONEY) on you and your childishness…I’ll be off to make more money now…enjoy your poor life and your fat ass stuck on the couch!
 RICH AND SKINNY 
yes, and here you go again with more brainwashing dribble of your own…blah blah blah…come up with some CLEAR STATISTICAL DATA TO BACK YOUR SLANDEROUS ACCUSAATIONS.  Nomorehackers is right…and you can’t say anything in clear defined rebuttal but THAT????
 Hjarrett49253 
HAHA.!!! Sooo your saying that because someone has failed and has family issues that they cannot make a good business person?  It’s probably easy to SIT on a SOFA staring into a screen and judging everyone besides yourself.  MLM’rs are making alot of money, comes down to some cynical, conspiracy theorists….and you guys are just making the rest of the“normal”uncommitted world laugh right now.  Why not make some money, write some comedy outta this horsesh*t and do something for yourself instead of blowing out everyone elses candle to make yours burn brighter.  SAD….

ANother angry one. Ive never seen so many rich people driving BMWs So angry!  Visalus has got the most positive reps!….How many people in your downline?

Visalus needs to adopt a new policy…..All reps must undergo ANGER MANAGEMENT TRAINING. Most also seem to be suffering late onset OEDIPUS CONFLICT. Maybe also some added prozac in the shakes.

prozac!

HEY F YOU ALL .. Visalus is awesome. It made my grandma come off of her insulin.. And my buddy, he’s been on the shakes and he’s lost a ton of weight.. I have TWO BMW’s thanks to visalus.. That’s right! TWO B M freakin W’s..

You are all idiots! My other buddy was in a COMA and I slipped him a tasty shake.. and guess what? He woke up–smarter.. At the convention, they took a guy who’s been dead for a week and Sarnicoa put some Visalus powder in his mouth–felated the corpse and it was a miracle the guy pops up and signs on as a distributor.. In fact Sarnicola says that’s how he got his entire cream team..

If you’re SOOOO successful with Visalus why not go concentrate on that awesome business of yours and stop desperately trying to convince us all that you’re not a pathetic sucker who is cheerleading for a crap pyramid scheme that will go under in a few months to years, leaving all you dipshits with nothing to show for it while the rest of us snicker and wait for the next stupid fucking MLM to come around and sucker all you assholes again?

FUCK visalus. How about I make my own shake: 1 scoop of Dymatize Elite Gourmet protein from bodybuilding.com (which is WHEY and CASEIN, which have been proven in countless peer-reviewed studies to be superior forms than the soy shit that is in Visalus) and add 1 Centrum multivitamin from the grocery store.

Total cost: $0.20
Total cost of a Visalus shake (crappier ingredients, 1/2 the protein): $1.25

OHHH EMM GEEEE…. bUT YOU GETS DA FIBER IN VISALUS!!!!

Ok, add some fucking Metamucil to it, morons. It costs about 20 cents per scoop. So now we’re at 40 CENTS per serving…compared to $1.25 for the shit Visalus shake…. that requires you to be a marketing whore and alienate your entire community with your lies, annoying spammy crap and your pathetic regurgitated sound bites and marketing phrases.

You are right. Im a former competitive bodybuilder. I sell BB supplements at my gym. Far superior to visalus. CASEIN is an awesome protein. Soy is a vegatble protein not easily assimilated by the body.

At least Thomas Edison had some credibility and you can buy light bulbs at the dollar store.

What next? My MLM friend is gonna sell me a candle at $35 per stick and tell me how superior it is to the light bulb? And if I find 3 more suckers to buy then I get my supply of candles for free? Then show me youtube videos of diabetics, lupus sufferers, who use candles?

I am not selling any kind of book. Boy are you angry, negative, ignorant person. One thing that has always worried me about Visalus is that they do not screen their recruits and some of these people are, lets say. a few bricks shor of a load.  They teach them to be so aggressive toward people who do not agree. There is a potential of some one going postal, but Visalus would say they don’t work for me. No kidding with their practices someone could get hurt the people are desperate. I am not hidding behind a screen any more than you are. You are again showing the class of these people that scam for Vissalus.

He talks about adding the Vit a pak that adds to the cost to that’ll be $250 a month Thank You.

You sound like a teen ager. No tak that back make tha a preteen. No one writing posts are trying to sell anything but you desperate Visalus people.
 Elizzyp 
You sound just like  a Visalus zombie and make about as much sense. GREAT IMPRESSION!

There you go again with your delusions equating Dr Steidman to Thomas Edison is like equating Viaslus to Micro Soft, yep had a Visalus person do that about chocked on that one.
 Elizzyp 
What they are really selling is the selling . Get it.

Got to say you are the sad one. BLOWING OUT SOMEONE ELSE’S CANDLE is this a new line they taught you.  Has Visalus wrote all over it.  You are the ones ending up in sitcoms (see the ones posted on this site.

2 days oh what an exstensive study.  Ther are other choices than drive thru, junk food and a shake.  Try eating healthy food. Shakes for ever how boring, getting out the blender and mxing the shakes with what ever, how boring. Please don’t be giving your child this junk. The cost shakes and vita pack $250 a month. Whoa. Give me real food.

I have personal friends that I saw destroy their life with this stuff.  You don’t know how far you can fall.
 Elizzyp 
What do you want be to do pull figures out of the air like you Visalus people do. I have seen any proof from you as to why this is such a great thing and pulling from the Visalus sale material is not proof.
 Elizzyp 
Yes I have heard people compaing about the pressure their upline put on them and how they are wanting them to put pressur on their downline. Wouldn’t want either. That is another Visalus line“its not fore every one”“people fail all the time”Go through all these post and see how many times the exact same things you say are repeated by some one else.

I am not Bill Gates put I do alright. I drive a Chrysler 300 because that is what I choose to drive. I own 2 homes in 2 different states.  Guess what I sleep well at night knowing I did not cheat or scam a single person to get them. Ilive in the real world were there is no delusion that peddling a useless shake for a company that doesn’t even recognize me as part of it is a business. Now Lawrence has a business, he has building, assets, he can go to the bank if he wishes and borrow on those assets, he propably has a car his business provides for him, he can sell the assets. You do not have a business, you have none of that. Wake up.  I have a job and I am thankful for it. I went to school to prepare myself. I get sick days, I get a 401K, I get paid vacations, I get health insurance.  My company pays their share of my social security ( you have 15.8% of your income taken right from the start because you have to pay both sides) and it pays unemployment insurance so that if I get laid off (not even a chance) I would have some income.
As far as having a fat ass (don’t think so) stuck on the couch, not ther either. And guess what I have lots of friends and I will keep them because I think enough of them to never scam them. So when you start getting personal at least know something about that person.
 Guesty 
no i dont. She didnt push me to sell, she told me i could refer 3 and get mine free, but thats it. Been using for months now and I barely hear from her. So no, thats not how it works. How would you know how it works anyways, you obviously dont use the product!
 Guesty 
tell your Friend to contact ElizzyP for all life advice, cause clearly she knows everything
 Elizzyp 
And just so you know I would never disrespect any of my family be calling them a fat lazy ass because they would not be scammed into buying or selling a worthless shake.  Your sister is much smarter than you.  I just feel sorry for her for having a sister lke you. I hope she stays away from you.
 Elizzyp 
Very good Thank you for your post.
 Elizzyp 
Hey guys these Visalus people may not be very trustworthy but you have got to admit they know human nature and are awesome brainwashers. They target people who have low self esteem and build them up by giving them big titles, only problem these titles have to be earned every month.  How would you like to have a promotion that is only good for a month? Smart though it keeps these people desperate to sell and hold on to that title they have bragged about. Then if they sell enough they give them the money to buy a BMW but you guessed it has to be earned every month. The danger here is you have to use your own credit and name to get that great BMW or you have to pay the lease yourself.  This smart to as the company has no exposure for the car you do. Not only have you bragged about your BMW you have that payment over your head, that’ll keep you desperate and working. They have meetings every month at different place to keep the brainwashing fresh. Trick to this you have to pay for it all yourself, that cr3dit card bill will keep you desperate and working. Add to that credit card bill expenses for challenge parties, just try it for 90 days, is their bread and butter.  The expenses for samples and promotional material, $29 amonth website you can see how you would be desperate for sells. All this is on top of the required amount of $200 a month you are required to sell to stay a seller.  The $500 to $1000 you have to put up front for the pleasure to sell for them.  The compensation plan is so complicated I doubt if they even know what it is.  To get anything you have to have 3 people under you selling too at all times. Then you have to sell $2500 to qualify for much of anything. Then $12,500 a month to be a regional manager and get the famous BMW. Then you get 5% of what your sellers sell and 25% of what you sell yourself ( I think I am right on this)  If you sell $100,000 a month you become an ambassador and get a bonus of $10,000 paid over a number of years, so the big fake checks you see at the meetings are just that big fake checks.  You can see how people would be desperate as it all is only good for a month.  They tell people they own a businesss to give an inflated sense of importance and to get them to pay the expenses and to make sure the company has no exposure.  They can encourage you to lie because they have you sign a contract stating you are not an employee or distributor of the company. They fall for this because these people have never had a title or a chance to own a business.  They take advantage of the dreams these people have and their bad body image they have of theirself.  SAD

Oh but Lawrence the Great Hulk Hogan ( Mr steroid wife beater himself ) is their spokeperson. Aren’t you impressed.

So why are you here being so defensive about a product you use…I mean really, it’s just a protein shake, so who gives a shit if other people don’t like it…what’s it to you? I use Colgate toothpaste, but I wouldn’t get defensive if someone told me it’s not a good toothpaste…please give us some credit…it’s obvious from your posts that you either sell it or helping someone sell it.

That’s funny, because I don’t remember the government asking me to recruit more people to join the government to make money…same with jobs…my employer (who happens to be the federal government) never asked me to pay $500 after I was hired…they also don’t expect me to recruit other employees and charge them $500 to be employed…they also don’t expect me to buy anything from them to keep my job…so…

…Visalus prefers to be called MLM instead of pyramid scheme…that’s like saying callgirl instead of whore…

I”m not a fan of Visalus or this dude trying to down play a network marketing company to sell his book. I don’t do Visalus products because of the ingredients, but if they shake was similar to say ON 100% Whey, I would be all in the business. If you offer a good product, why not join the business, because I can’t remember the last time ON sent me a pay check for telling others to take their proten. But some of you guys are so close minded, it amazing why so many people are broke in this country.
 integrity 
They don’t“pay”you…you become their slave and in order to make a substantial amount of money you have to devote your entire day and life around selling and promoting….which ends up being around 1-3 dollars an hour…no benefits, and no respect.

The good products are on the shelf and sell themselves :)

It’s not about the“product”so much as the lying and exagerating behind it all.  Marketing a product is one thing, but when a person chooses to do whatever and say whatever, then it becomes an issue and a turn off.

I think we are quite open minded. We don’t let people pick our pockets while they are lying to our face..  I consider sites like this the same as other scam alert sites.

I noticed on my Visa statement a charge for $66.00 from VISALUS SCIENCES CANADA. I had cancelled a few months ago, and have not been receiving any product in months. Now I have to go over my Visa statements.  Right now it looks like fraud, and I am thinking that the RCMP and BBB should be informed.

file a complaint.. Post your experience as a warning to others.. I cannot believe all of the paid PR that blair is getting so his company can hurt families.. There really ought to be a law against MLM or at least require them to provide full disclosure of the business in BOLD CHARACTERS. Then if someone is dumb enough to believe it–fine.

If people aren’t hating on you its because your not doing anything. I keep hearing many opinions but here are some facts:

3,000 NEW CUSTOMERS start the 90 day challenge every day. I would be upset if i was losing business to this company too. that’s 3k people that aren’t doing business with someone else so they are pissed and hurt.

I dont talk about BMW’s but you guys are obsessed with this so lets address again. Every HOUR every DAY a new person qualifies, if they get a car they get paid $7,200 a year towards their payment. If they don’t they get paid $3,600…now go to your boss and ask for that as a raise and tell me how long they laugh at you. Think of that 24 people a DAY are getting that, does your NON-scam company do that????

We now give away $25,000,000 as a reward for people to hit their goals, is that so bad?  With all the other MLM junk and crap out there is someone drinking a $1.65 shake in the morning instead of hitting the Mcdonalds drive thru so horrible? Is it not a much better choice?

And we still fail to realize or admit the biggest scam of all is this blog using visalus as a keyword to get hits and to sell e-books(drive a FREE luxury car) is one for example and thats totally fine but a company paying you as a reward is a total scam right? lol

Lastly, how is it possible that you can join for $49, have no autoship to pay for, get free product, have customers get free product.  And when that invoice comes and its a whopping $0 how in the world can it be a scam or waste of money?
 miseryhascompanyhere 
Was just watching CNN, they were interviewing a new american company making large TV, they focused on how this will add 100 jobs to the econ in Michigan. Visalus hired over 100 people to work at their office in MI. 100 REAL JOBS as you like to refer to them. But those must be BS too right?
 Funnyfriends 
3000 new customers. Impressive. Tell me, how many stay on.

I don’t talk about the BMW’s either. Tell me, who’s name is the car under? How do I qualify for it?

How do I get the product for free? Sign up 3 others? What if they drop out?
 corporateamericasucks 
not sure, my personal retention rate is about 2/3 stay on for 90 days. If they do it for a month they will for 90.

The car is under my name, i had it BEFORE visalus. And when its paid off because of the bmw bonus when i sell it the $$$ goes to me so that works out well.

Yes if you get 3 on the challenge with you yours is free, if someone quits and you want to get it for free then find another. If you get personal results you will find way more then 3 asking you what you did. If you dont want to promote the challenge to get free product then pay for its. Your choice. If you wanna pay for it its the same price as most on the market.

If you are working on a fitness goal to make yourself feel and look better, and save money i dont see how that could possibly be a scam.
 Solpro2000 
Your company also will not share the wealth you are building for the owners either.Change is always difficult. Network marketing works. It gives you and me the same opportunity as everyone else. You build a business and you get paid. You have a great product your business grows. It’s hard to understand why you say the product doesn’t work. Have you tried it? Would you rather pay a lot of money for something because the company has to advertise, market,carry inventory, pays employees minimum wage with no benefitsetc or would you like to pay less for a great product from a company that doesn’t spend it’s money on advertising, and ships direct from factory to consumer. Avon, Stanley, Fuller Brush, Mary Kay and many others have used this model for years. I was very skeptical of the product at first too. But getting a meal for less than $2 ea for a couple weeks was worth a try. If I didn’t see a diff I get my money back. McDonalds doesn’t offer this after you eat their meal. I tried it and it has made me feel great. I am not brainwashed. No one tried to get me to buy or sell it. I read about the results people were having and I contacted them. No one calls me trying to sell me something else. It’s just good. It’s a marketing method that works. It’s hard for people to accept if they don’t understand how and why it works. I’m tired of working for others and not knowing if my job will be there tomorrow. I am in charge of my life now.

 Nickwhite85 
ook,to anyone readin the above (and below) they are both RIGHT and WRONG!

i have been in Amaway and other mlm companies. i have made money, met people who still make a pot load of maniy, have friends who still make it. BUT i also know way more who have tried and failed (in almost all mlm)RIGHT: The majority of of people deciding to become distributors will fail, will never earn a BMW and will end up probably spending money on gas and some marketing products they think will make up for what they lack. MLM is MARKETING and SALING on a personal level. if u aren’t into either of those, u will fail.

WRONG: SCAM it is not, u can make money, and purchase products (that will be delivered, and use these products for what they were designed). MLM concept is a way some companies use to“save”on marketing cost, and to have a greater distrobution system accross a larger area. a lot of companies also realise that most return business is due to word of mouth and good experiences, rather than flyers and commercials.

A businesz is a business, u give me 10 days to decide if ur book will change my life, restaurants fail, corner stores fail, mlm promoters fail…we just see the mlm ones more because they don’t take the time to think it through.

If you don’t like the food industry, don’t open a restaurant, if you don’t like  refferal sales and marketing don’t become a promoter fir a MLM
 Lawrence 
The reason these companies Use the MLM model, IS NOT TO SAVE MONEY ON MARKETING COSTS. Its because they make the vast majority off distributors.
 corporateamericasucks 
Dear haters, stop trying to convince us that you have all the answers, and are not part of a legit business. We are not interested. We are not asking you to buy(we are far too busy thanking the 3,000 plus everyday that do). I dont care about your car you pay for, your real job, your real boss, or your health.

Start paying attention to the news, look around yourself in your community. Are people eating more fast food then good food? YES. Are people looking for ways to cut expenses ASAP? YES. And finally are some of you FAR to concerned with a company you have no association with? YESSSSS.

If i didn’t do this FULL TIME(According to some of you im one of the VERY few thats successful) I wouldnt be spending my time with something that had nothing to do with me.

I read this site calling us the scam of the month and since the article is total BS to sell e-books i had to comment. Those of you that feel like you must expose something about this company that is not true should honesty move on with your daily lives. NOTHING you are doing is preventing anyone from doing their homework on their own, we offer a FULL refund if its not for you.

We dont grow like we are by ripping people off. I understand a lot of what you guys say about OTHER companies and TOTALLY AGREE. We are growing because we dont do all that stupid stuff, as much as you WISH we did. We don’t, sorry :)

The average MLM pays %50 to the distributors. The other 50% goes to EVERYTHING else it takes to run a business. Those numbers are not far off or dead on with most business.

My background is rest&amp;bar. For the BEST run place you might put 30% down to the bottom line, many factors but this is general. MLM does not put that to the bottom line so once again here we go, its all a scam right?
 Contextswitch 
It’s a scam because Visalus makes it seem like their protein powder will cure every illness known to man and you will be wealthy by selling it.

The entire promotion is a scam because is it based on false hope and the real product is selling distributorships..
 Egg Nog 
The idea that it is NOT a SCAM because you can really make money doing it is not actually a justification for the methodology.  Of course you can make money off the MLM scheme, just like you can make money selling drugs or stealing from people . . . but‘making money’does not justify the sort of business practice that it is!

And of course there is a product involved, without the actual product (whether it lives up to its claims or not) the scheme would never get off the ground.

The SCAM aspect is all about the ethical nature of the method of sale. Lying about the product in extreme ways (it cured leuchemia, it cured diabetes) should raise red flags all over the place!  Giving false impressions about the benefits to distributors if they succeed.  Implying that you will be getting something for nothing after reaching a particular height in your own personal pyramid of distribution.  Not being honest to those who you see as potential (pyramidal base expansion) downline distributors.

The usual construction of a pyramid (from the top down) is to get 2 people under you to purchase the product (ViSalus uses 3 because as someone wrote only 2/3 on average succeed).  So the insistence that you have 3 as your customers or distributors under you in order to qualify for your“free”product gives the ViSalus MLM a much wider base on their pyramid (and yours also).  Now if you have 2 distributors and one non-distrib customer, then you get your“goodies”for free, but in addition to that your 2 distributors bring in, say, 5 more  distributors and another 2 customers . . . well the base of your own pyramid is growing and you get a cut of the downline purchases.  And the faster that ViSalus can give you a cheque for your cut of the profits, the more incentive there is for you to expand your pyramid base.  With the 3 total customers and the 5 downline distributors in your pyramid, that’s a total of $2,000 flowing up throught the core of the pyramid you have created. So you get a cut of $300 plus the“free”(for selling your soul) product, and you appear to be making about $550/month, impressive!  Let this pyramidal structure grow for a few months and the potential return can indeed be staggering. Now, can you look up to the top of the pyramid and see how much those at the top are raking in as pure profit, for basically doing nothing more that starting the scheme going and now and then encouraging more distribution in their business kingdom.

Of course legitimate jobs are also created in making the product and packaging and warehousing it. Also in research and development, in construction and technical help, etc..  These aspects are obviously not scams althought they exist only because of the scam that the pyramid creates.

Just imagine in the purest sense, if this was a nutritional supplement product, without the hype and aggressive sales of the pyramid structure, but merely relying on the actual effectiveness of the nutrients to drive the business model. What kind of success would it attain?  Would it reach $250million in annual sales in 3 years on the market?  Perhaps if it really was successful in those beneficial health cures that it promoted, but highly unlikely.  The success of ViSalus is the pyramid model and aggressive marketing of those who either have no ethical standards or those gullible enought to believe the claims that the scammers above them are making.

Today I was approached again by my friend asking me to try the product, when I said that I couldn’t affor $250/month for a supplement, he said,“But all you need is to get 3 people to buy it through you and you’ll get your supply for free! I’m sure you can do that!”So what’s he selling really, a great product or me getting something for nothing and even getting paid to promote the idea. It’s a pyramid. Of course it works, but who wants to“work under those conditions?”
 integrity 
I don’t hate. I disagree. I am healthy without visalus, and it is free to learn how to be healthy.

I saw about 8 different commercials the other night regarding health/diet products.  They all claimed to be the best, all had testimonials, all had before and after pictures, all had money back guarantees, all were“dr”recommended.  They all claimed to be the best product out there…so who is right if you are all right?  How about you are all competing in a market that is full of desperate people looking for quick fixes.

Nothing YOU are doing is preventing anyone from doing their homework on their own.“It”shouldn’t be for anyone…”It”is only your hopes to get rich and win prizes and help yourselves, lying saying you want to help others.

Drug dealers give free samples to get customers.  Does not make it ok and does not make me want to start using or selling drugs.  I bet they make more money than all of us, but it does not make it right.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
The difference is that you are most likely a distributor, claimig to be just a customer.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
You can get better products at your local grocery/health food store fore way less money. Plus you pay shipping and handling charges with Visalus…plus, if you live in Canada, you pay the exchange rate for Visalus products…

If you like telemarketing, then kudos to you for finding something you love. Personally, I  just didn’t think the time invested was worth the return.
 Lawrence 
Regarding claims: They can say it helped type 2 diabeties, because any weight loss will help type 2. I know many people who nearly come off there meds when they lose significant weight.(IF you havent had type 2 for long.) Thus, I dont consider that so impressive. I have had clients train with me who were able to lower or eliminate meds. DID I CURE THEM? lol.
I have seen bolder claims now. That WILL get the attention of the FTC and states attorney generals. BLYTH offers a disclaimer regarding Visalus. So they are not libel. In there financial statements , that were hard to find. They have a page or so of disclaimer type language regarding Visalus.
 corporateamericasucks 
People hear what they want to, i’m not trying to convince you of anything. I dont do it for my business either, its a waste of time. If i need to convince you to get on the challenge or join and promote, then EVERY day i need to convince you to continue, sorry but thats not worth my time.

Glad your healthy, most aren’t around you. FACT

You saw 8 commercials, most of those products are bad for you, promote a shortcut, and dont teach lifestyle changes. So in a very competitive market, options are bad? Or you just believe everything on the shelf is good for you? Match us up with everything on the shelf, roughly same $$$ sometimes pennies more or less. Your quick fixes statement, once again are you opposed to this is if works for people?

I encourage people to do their homework, do you think we cut off peoples internet???? People can do whatever research they want, i encourage it.

Its not for everyone, yes ANYONE can make a shake. But if they dont have a desire to start changing their habits there is no point. We are the step 1 a lot of people need, our numbers reflect that.

Do ever talk about my hopes, we have never met you know nothing about me. Assumption is step 1 of looking like an idiot. How many steps you take after that is your choice. What lie has come out of my mouth. You call what i do a scam because there is free info out there, so weight watchers is a big scam also correct?

I get a message every day with a customer success story. We claim a shake is step 1 to getting people on track and offer $$$ to keep them motivated, and you find that bad?

What do you do for a living? Has a company in your market closed down? Does everyone succeed? Does your mid level management make more then the owner? Has anyone ever complained about a charge or anything? Or are you and your life perfect like you try to portray on a blog thats a scam itself?
 Lawrence 
MLM bears absolutely no resemblance to a regular business. You must know this. If Visalus wants to enter that realm. LET IT DO SO. on the shelves next to every other shakes. With all the accompanied expenses.
 Lawrence 
According to Visalus.25% of distributors get product for free. 12% of buyers(not distributors get it for free).
NOT MANY have a $0 invoice.
 Lawrence 
25%. they used to say 1in 4. very deceiving. let me give you another stat. 1 in 3 men get prostate cancer. I have 2 brothers. Does that mean 1 of us will get prostate cancer ? OF COURSE NOT. Its an overall number. 1 distributor may sign up 5 people. Another distributor 0!
 Lawrence 
a business is not a business. Comparing mlm companies with REAL business is not valid.
 integrity 
Who are you to say that the products on the commercials are not good? They all make the same claims as visalus.  It is called marketing.

Comparing a real job (what I do happily for a living) to a MLM is funny and makes you sound uneducated.

I have witnessed many everyday people (unhealthy at that) become part of the visalus mlm, and claim to know how they can help people become healthy and claim to suddenly have all the answers.  That is fishy, and if it doesn’t smell good, it is rotten!

My real job hired me because of my experience and education.  My real job does not require me to recruit people in order to keep my rate of pay.  My real job pays me benefits, health insurance, bonuses etc.  I get paid hourly and get to go home after work and enjoy my free time with my family.

I don’t have to work 24 hours a day talking to people about what I do.  I don’t post on facebook about everything I do at my job trying to convince people that what I do is the best thing on earth.

I am not on this blog to promote anything.  I don’t care about if this page is selling anything…I am taking part in a coversation that happens to be on this page.

Visalus pays to spam the internet so that it is saturated with one-sided blogs….in order to prevent conversations like this one that includes people with all opinions, not just those of one side.
 corporateamericasucks 
ok? Whatever an independent rep CLAIMS Visalus is not libel. To grow how they have dont you think they are a little smarter then that? And now with the visalus owners being the 2ns largest shareholders of Blythe would they risk that??? Dont think so, Not sure where your going with this post.

at our rate of growth that 360 a day with a 0 invoice, talking negative about these people getting fre product that keeps them out of the drive thru is mind blowing lawrence.
 corporateamericasucks 
so what? why do you keep trying to make something of nothing? Stats are stats, numbers dont lie people do.
 corporateamericasucks 
yes your so smart. you have seen so much mlm BS in the past you cannot figure out whats going on here. It’s ok, your like our competition :)
 corporateamericasucks 
god no, then i will have to get a normal job again and take a huge pay cut and not have my lifestyle. No death cycle for me thanks
 corporateamericasucks 
Well you see a lot of EAS myoplex commercials with athletes(no im done is the slogan) as well as muscle milk, both VERY popular products on the shelf. They both contain too high levels of cadmium and lead (along with considerable levels of arsenic) But since they have commercials&amp;ads and are on a shelf they are good according to you right?

I’m far from uneducated, i rose to the top of 2 large corporate companies in the food industry and was AT LEAST 17 years younger then my fellow upper level management. I moved up that ladder very very quickly. I walked away from a cakewalk job i could do whatever i wanted had 5 weeks paid vacation, bonuses were about the amount of 3 entire american families household income, and received over 10% raises for 3 straight years.

Where we differ, was i wanted more. I was not ok with my head hitting the glass ceiling over and over again. Some people are totally fine with that(like you) and you know what? thats totally fine, but it wasn’t for me. So i made a change and hit a grand slam.

As far as benefits and health insurance, and bonuses I had all those. Now i have them again and they are MUCH MUCH better then before. See i believe in myself and my abilities, most people are scared and stay in their respective bubble.

One sided blogs? there are many but they say both sides?

Visalus is far too busy doing what they do and doing it damn better then the rest to notice these blogs.

With how much time you spend on here bitching about a company you only read about it seems like you dont value that free time with your family as much as you say. It seems like you were a soap salesman at amway years ago and are still bitter they you couldn’t“make it”so you have to trash companies doing good things(us, a lot are garbage) to get even or something?

I hope you get over this because their are a lot of people that have started down the path of better health, better decisions, and most importantly lifestyle changes. It would be a shame if your bitterness discouraged anyone reading this to take a step in the right direction.
 corporateamericasucks 
i am enjoying my paid off bmw quite nicely thank you :) as well as all my free product, so your theory sounds like too much work for me or all the rest of us getting free stuff. And its also $.40 more expensive then i currently pay. But thanks for your insight, you might also want to add a mood stabilizer as well because it seems your very upset with something
 corporateamericasucks 
not a paid endorser, they dont have ANY currently and wont. That model does not work for many of the reasons you just mentioned.
 integrity 
You are never sure how to respond to common sense and a little humor.
 integrity 
Its obvious you feel the need to respond in a derogitory way when confronted.  Your only defense is to end your conversation trying to hurt the other person.  Not very admirable.

FYI muscle milk and EAS were not the commercials I saw…you picked those out of the air.  My point in talking about commercials was to say that just because claims are made does not mean they are true.

My children are grown and out of the house and how I spend my free time weather it is cuddling with my spouse or surfing the net is my business.

I will speak my mind to help people and warn them about MLM companies like visalus anytime I can.

Sounds like you had a terrific position in your job.  I don’t feel the need to brag about mine.  My life is good and that is all I need to say, why do you feel the need to constantly brag about your life.

Most times people who brag, boast because they are weak and have low self esteem and are in need of praise.

I’m in no way bitter.  I will not change my mind“or get over this”, as you put it. People who disagree will always out-number you.  If you have the answers to every question asked, then you are a liar.
 corporateamericasucks 
No i didnt pick out of the air i picked 2 of the best selling actually. I was an athlete and used both in the past. But im sure you know that. If you are referring to the hydroxycuts and diet pills that are always on tv or magic dust to make calories disappear i have never tried nor will i so i wont comment.

You will get a derogitory response from me when you say things about me being uneducated and a joke.

What sounds like a terrific  job to you was not for me, like i said the corporate glass ceiling was not enough for me. We have 2 different schools of thought.

Visalus is a very new school concept and like i said the mlm you keep referring to sounds like amway back in the day.

I was stating facts not bragging, a few of you keep saying how you lose money in mlm and success is so minute I here to tell you either im in the 1% you refer to or maybe this concept is working. Im telling you from inside the company what i have walked away from, and what i have achieved. Again, some of you are not big fans of success stories, only stories of loss and hardship.

I am very far from weak and low self esteem is an issue im sure some people in my past wish i have. I am very very confident in myself, from prior success to current ones. I have no need of your praise.

I have no issue with disagreeing, thats fine. I have an issue with false accusations and calling something very legit and legal a scam. Thats my issue.

Luckily i have had to answer very few questions because all i really keep seeing are statements that say scam. Its a scam because people can get info for free, or because a $1.65 meal replacement is way over priced, or because it doesn’t cure anything. Or because your friend is doing this and says dumb stuff and is unaware of what they are talking about. Or if its so good it would be on a shelf with all the other great products(my favorite lol).

Does everyone make money. NO. Do those who dont actually do anything to generate money, usually not. Is that a scam, of course not. You cannot change human nature but you can offer people something better then a drive thru breakfast thats much better for them and the same price or less.
 corporateamericasucks 
No were talking about a legal document and health claims. The founders are young, but far from stupid. And once again, nothing about any of that is a SCAM. If i didnt have a sense of humor i would no continue to respond. Because i have a huge one is why im here because a lot im hearing is really funny.
 corporateamericasucks 
Also wanted to say since some of you keep talking $$$$ and %%%% here is one to chew one. $.50 of every dollar spent goes to people in the field. I think we can all agree to this, its the industry standard.

Well my personal team’s % for 2011 was a little over $400,000 a month, 4.8 million for the year.

Because of a $49 decision i made for a 2011 NY Resolution, my team was paid 2.4 million last year. $200,000 a month, $50,000 a week $7,143. a day, $297.62 an hour.

Thats just from my decision, an average guy. Thats the impact of Moms and dads, sons and daughters, friends and family, neighbors and co workers.

Most people that promote this challenge and company are satisfied customers. I cant think of ANY other  OLD MLM companies where that happens. Mostly because the only customers they have are buying their check.

New MLM focuses on customers that love the product and become a promoter. Us, P90X, and the proactiv solution people are the only few that come to mind. They are just a much smaller sales number then us.

When we do a billion in sales this year, if you doubt that please check back first week of jan 2013. We will be paying 500 million to U.S families and communities. Most companies(prob your ones for the haters) cannot say that.

So who’s a scam now?
 switch 
So at a 50% pay out in one year as just an“average guy”, you started at zero. and in 12 months averaged 266 units per day  $50 each, every day for the entire year..   Yet the visalus website says the average distributor does something like $500 / month or 10 units which means your team size is about 2% of the total # of distributors that your built in a 12 months

My bullshit meter is going off the charts at this point..

You are lying about something..

But it’s nice that you took the time from counting all your money to to enlighten us
 corporateamericasucks 
sorry buddy but its true, its very true. Its not all that i did but a network. Yes im very well off now.

Your BS meter is off the charts why? because you cannot do that at your job? So it must be BS?

On the site where your referring to each promoter doing $500 means that the average reps does $500 a month in sales which over time adds up.

Im a small part of our team, our team numbers alone would put us in the top 10% of companies in the industry.

I am lying about nothing, i have no reason or desire to impress you or try and recruit you. I’m putting it out there for all of you that say people only lose money in networking or scam people.

All i focus on is $0 invoices. Your business attrition rate disappears and then only grows.

My personal results got the ball rolling and i was smart enough to keep it going.

Back to counting my money as you say……
 integrity 
Sellers put lots of static out there trying to cover up the truth about this“visalus”scam.  visalus is the product they are selling in order to make this pyramid scheme“legal”.  There is just another protein shake on the market, and like every health/diet product out there they claim it to be the best and the one people have to buy.

Of course they claim this because in order for them to continue to win prizes and dream of getting rich, they have to scheme everyone around them to get you to buy and sell under them.

In the end, everyone loses.  (not weight, that comes back on)

Visalus sells protein powder that is claimed to be perfect by itself, yet they also sell you an appetite suppresant to add to it, flavor mix ins, extra vitamins, cookies and energy drink mixes.  So their perfect powder isn’t so perfect.  Unless you are going to eat a 100% clean diet, one healthy shake (no matter what brand) iss not going to be significant.

I try to picture a family sitting down to have a family meal, drinking a shake.  Sellers are taught to speak about how lazy we are as people, yet they preach fast fixes instead of lifelong lessons.

Health is a serious issue and having people who are not health experts tell people how to become healthy, with the only agenda for them to make a buck off you is wrong!  Once they know you will buy….they talk about you selling under them and buying all the other products….not your health.  Health is the mask they use to scam people, and most sellers don’t even realize what they are doing.

How lazy is it that you can not teach someone for free how to make a healthy meal and to exercise.  That will create lifelong health.  Telling someone they will lose weight fast and lots of it is the most unhealthy thing you can tell someone.

People who really care about you and your health are not going to try to sell you something.  Think of the persons agenda before you act.
 integrity 
You see“scam”statements because it is a scam!

I feel sorry for you.
 integrity 
PS. no amount of money in the world is worth becoming part of a scheme like this, preying on people….family and strangers.  Shame on you sellers who do this!

You throw out your stats and numbers thinking that it will entice me, and it makes me sicker….it just proves more what the real agenda behind this all is….and it is NOT peoples health.

Are you going to be there to support the people who realize they were duped and quit, or the people who gain their weight back and then some?  I bet you will just call them lazy people who don’t know how to sell good and that they are failures.
 Ex-Visalus Disributor 
The false promise: Follow the money folks… People in all those companies claim to make millions and have helped other make millions but yet have nothing to show for it. They claim they make money yet drive crappy cars, live in apartments, and best of all will never reveal their W2 or 1099’s simply because they never made any real money but rather made less money than a guy working in corporate America in 5 years. We have asked over a dozen agents from Primerica, 5Linx and Visalus for some 1099’s and have received nothing in the past 2 years and yet constantly argue that they make money. Simply pathetic. We even met a guy at Primerica who claimed to make $30,000 a month and yet wore a $100 suit, lived in a van and smelled homeless but yet he made $30,000 a month… WOW… Do you really want to belong to that crow of elite idiots?
 switch 
Yes.. Off the charts because you are lying.. and you know you are lying..

$500 a month.Sure, over time, but you said you did it in a year.

This is pure MLM bullshit. Either you are a seasoned MLM’r who brought an existing MLM pyramid under you–in which case, the“average guy”part of your story is a lie. Or, you are inflating the numbers of your team–which is likely. Or, you are really a low-level guy and aggregated your entire pyramid and made it sound like you are the tip–another lie

The fact is ALL mlm’s claim rampant growth to suck people in. Then sales flatten out or drop because the people realize their product is really no any better than other products and stop buying or people realize it’s not a real business and they get sick of being the pariah they are and move on to more productive efforts.

The few distributors who’ve risen a few levels expend all of their efforts trying to retain their people.. Most at one point will even buy their own products for cash from their own team to maintain their position.

I’ve done the taxes for a MLM’r who had a team, got the bonus car every year and had a sizable group under him He held weekly meetings and went to the conferences and had a wall full of tacky“awards”.. He felt like he was rich and bragged about his income and wanted me a join so I played along for awhile and went to the meetings.. It was truly sad because I knew what his net earnings really were.. Sure the checks appeared huge.. but the net was not after factoring all of the other expenses.

In the end, he wound up filing for bankruptcy

It’s the treadmill from hell..

I started my 90 day challenge in septmber 2011. I am down 50 lbs and feel better than I have in 10 years. My entire lifestyle has changed and Visalus helped me get their. I have been in the gym, 3-4 times a week and eat healthy balanced meals and drink delicious nutritional shakes…I became a promoter part way through my first challenge,not to get rich but to share my success with others…am I making money as a promoter? Absolutely! Am I driving my BMW? Not yet, but soon enough….am I scamming people? Not a chance. Am I forcing anyone or pressuring anyone to join? Nope….are people drawn to my success? Yep….. There is no scam, you can invest a small amount of money to open opportunity. The only one that stands in your way of being successful in an MLM company is yourself….you have all the help and support you need but if you don’t go and do your job, you will not find success….most people are just not used to this type of job…

It’s funny that all MLM’rs sound alike and all appear to come from low paying jobs and education..

Having done the taxes for seasoned MLM’rs I can tell you this. If you want to make a few $ on the side–fine. You can do that with visalus ( or mary kay/amway/etc etc ). Are you going to make enough to live on? VERY VERY unlikely. Are you going to make enough to retire wealthy? NO!

What makes visalus a scam is they tell people the shake is a magical cure-all and everyone selling it is a millionaire in the making. It’s just protein powder–like any other protein powder–everything else is just marketing

BTW: I think paramedics are WAAAAAAAY underpaid given how important their role is in emergency medicine.. WAAAAAAAY underpaid.
 Jdntrust 
Hey I am posting this to everyone, not just elizz, ok look the shakes the products ARE NO BETTER THEN THE REST other then that they taste amazing and you can make a ton of recipes w/them thats the truth. What visalus is to me and why I am good at promoting it is that I use it to challenge people for 90 days to achieve a goal to change their body which of course will help them with there self esteem and in the end hopefully motivate them to do more with thier lives then they ever thought possible, visalus is a tool to me just like money I want to help people be thier true selves and use the 90 day challege as the push that gets them to move, and again motivate them to a change they may never have done had they not had this“game”to play almost everyone I have sold to loses wieght maybe 15 maybe 30 nothing unrealistic at all, but more importantly they realize there potential to accomplish goals and become a more satisfied individual oh and yeah you are a complete fool if you buy the BMW then you will be running around like a snake oil salesman trying to hit your #’s so you don’t lose your car, take the $300  bonus and ride the wave, I make a legit $600-$1,000 a month and have a team of 5 distibutors that I have one meeting with a week we throw 2 parties a week and we all work together. Also note if you are not around the demographic if you are not fit, if you are not outgoing you will FAIL so don’t invest. I invested because my team and I are personal trainers for a large gym and have tons of clients and new people to talk to everyday everyweek and we dont promote a protien shake (lmao thats why you fail at this) we promote a 90 day challenge to change your life physically and mentally and that no other product can offer in the way Visalus does. Thats the truth I promise
 Duped 
Thanks for the story, but it’s not any different than any other weight loss shake.

Don’t you people get it? There is nothing compelling in the product and I am sure it is a good product. I am 100% sure you could have lost your 50lbs just through proper diet and exercise.
 corporateamericasucks 
congrats ryan!!!!! well said
 corporateamericasucks 
how is the price point with others that are on a shelf?
 corporateamericasucks 
yes 1 guy you know failed because he seemed to never be in control of what he had. Must be a scam right?

A pizza joint closed down by my house, and a burger king, and a boston market, and a grocery store, and a party store. So those are all scams as well because they closed down and the owner failed?

Would you rather risk $49-$499 or how much its cost to open a brick and mortar these days?
 corporateamericasucks 
the % person that joins the challenge has the same usual progression.

Month 1 just replace a meal and snack with a shake, thats it.

Month 2 Start eating healthier when not having a shake, they now are making an effort to eat better and more aware of what they are putting into their body because they lost weight and feel better

Month 3 Incorporate exercise because they have seen and felt results so they are excited. Over 1/2 my team customers achieve their goal.

So in 3 months you take someone, they now eat cleaner and are much more aware of what they put into their body, they exercise regularly and have hit a desired goal that once seemed hopeless due to they didnt have the desire or energy to chase their goal.

If they dont win anything, do you think they feel like they lost anything besides unwanted weight?
 corporateamericasucks 
those idiots are in EVERY industry FYI, and the whole fake it till you make it is old school dinosaur mlm.

yes i have all the reason in the world to lie because im here trying to recruit right? I haven’t said my name for a reason.

Like i said i have no reason to lie to you about anything. And even less desire.

How many people went bankrupt that didnt do mlm mr accountant?

You saying i know 1 guy who went bankrupt is silly, im sure this guy was a screw up at everything he did by the sound of your story.

I dont even expand my efforts going after new people, i focus on the challenge and people joining(customers) this is why were different then all the crap out there, this is why were growing like we are when the rest are closing down shop. And this is why most of you cannot wrap your head around what we do because your comparing us to all the old mlm companies.

New day and and i can think of 2 others companies similar to what were doing on a smaller scale P90x and proactiv solution(rodin and fields)

You are the person choosing to come here to a page where we discuss what we believe.
 integrity 
When people come to me for free advice if they want to live a healthier lifestyle, it does not come with a timeline or MLM products.

You constantly try to fill the page up with numbers, and stats.

You talk in the 3rd person….creepy.

People can lose weight without spending extra money on a product they don’t need.  If you introduced someone visalus, you are introducing them a product they don’t need to become succesful.
 integrity 
Like I said earlier…namecalling like“failure”comes out.  Where is your sympathy for human beings?

Again, throwing out pizza joints, fastfood places, grocery and other stores.

It is all static, to get people sidetracked, to avoid thinking about what an absurd MLM this is.

Businesses that close down are not my problem so why are you bringing them up? Do you think everyone is trying to open up a“brick and mortar”?

So many random things are thrown out by all the sellers….and the same things are repeated, just like you are trained to at your meetings.  Nobody says anything original, all copycat language.



I would rather save my $49.00-1000.00 plus dollars and not give it to a product I don’t need.  People do not need to spend their money on a protein shake, and all the other extras this MLM is selling.
 integrity 
who cares how much products on the shelf costs.  How much is the toothpaste I use compared to what you use, or the shampoo I buy….etc.

Always comparing….we are not the people who set prices.  You are the person who chose to get involved in selling protein powder….and appetite suppresants, and cookies, and flavor mix ins and energy powder…..

None of these products are newly invented, or extra special in any way.  None of these products are necessary to become healthy.  People do not need to spend 1 cent on these products to get healthy or to stay healthy.
 integrity 
Congratulations on getting healthy.  As a health and fitness person, I can tell you that it was a change in your diet with the combination of exercise that helped you reach your goal.  It was not because of visalus.

Anyone who is ready and willing to change their eating habits can and will get awesome results.  I have a big problem with people selling the idea that they need to spend money on this MLM to help them reach their goals, when there are countless FREE ways for people to reach their goals.

Doesn’t“investing money”in protein powder sound silly to you?  Protein powders are nothing new, and there is nothing special about any of them out there.  People like what they chose to drink for their own reasons, and it does not make the protein shake I drink better than the one you drink.

There are so many ways to invest money without getting involved in an MLM scheme.  This is not a“real job”.  It’s a temporary high, that will eventually bring a very sad low.
 Lola4bella 
Poor and uneducated?!?! WOW!! I don’t sell Visalus but have been using the product for over 2 years. I LOVE IT!! I have 3 EDUCATED childhood friends, with Master’s, degrees who quit their jobs because they are making so much money AND have each earned a BMW!!! Of course like any MLM company you have to work hard! The writer of this article sounds like the uneducated one! Also, Visalus is the only MLM company with stocks that are growing faster than Apple’s when Apple first started.

Well said!! I was thinking the same thing about“integrity.”

To make a judgement like that just shows the class of person you really are.
 CS 
someone is shhhh-wasted on Visalus kool-aid.  LOL. Time for rehab..

Translation: 3 educated friends with unmarketable degrees left low paying jobs with the false belief they will make a lot of money with a MLM. Now they are on the hook for a car they cannot afford and when their sales slow and their pyarmid collapses they will be in sever financial difficulty and so–fearing that they are doubling their efforts promoting what is essentially a bit fat lie..

If you’re making a few bucks great.. but please stop bullshitting us.
 CS 
Apparently what another MLM’r posted earlier is true.. Visalus is sending emails to their distributors imploring them to come here and spew their lies..

I guess visalus doesn’t want anyone to know their magic powder is just commodity and they’ve been duped into believing it’s so much more..

The comparison to Apple is just sad.. Blair/Sarnicola were comparing themselves to Steve Job–pathetic on so many levels..
 Lawrence 
sorry Been a trainer for 2 decades. Gym owner for 7 years. Also a former competitive bodybuilder.
I would suggest to you, your comments are probably more true of those involved with visalus.
 Lawrence 
nearly ALL are cheaper than visalus.
 integrity 
It is very true“cs”that visalus mlm’rs are told to confront all who dare to speak another language.  They spend countless hours trying to glorify a protein powder.  Then they go to places like here to invade a space where it is obvious we are not“buying”the product or the idea they are trying to sell.  They block all“outsiders”from their private chats.  Says a lot about them!

I saw a great post today:
 integrity 
True, most can not think for themselves so they go to their“upline”and ask how they should reply to comments and opinions that are different than their own.
 integrity 
If someone had a Master’s degree and were working, they would not be as blindsighted to actually quit their job for an MLM.  If they did, good luck to them.  I don’t care what kind of car people drive.  Do you care what kind of car I drive?  I work hard too and love my paycheck, my paid vacations, my free time, my retirement, and many other benefits.  If I feel like drinking a protein shake I can go to the store and buy some without any bullcrap

What kind of car I drive, my body size, my income or my job does not define me as a person.
 integrity 
Their“websites”are one sided and the company pays it to be that way, just listen to the people selling it and all the“testimonials”

I would never take a product that has to show profits to their share holders!  WHY would anyone?  That’s how product integrity deteriorates…I;m sorry this is an obvious scam…I;m sure your friends are smart, but they also have a truck load of student loans that need to be paid off…And they are doing it at the expense of false hope/health of others.  You can’t live on liquid shakes, energy drinks and fortified vitamins in a pill.  Not possible.
 TooMuch 
I’m just curious about the long term effects of drinking concentrated“secret formula”nutrition.  It’s sad that people can’t just stick to REAL food in decent size portions that satisfy and provide REAL nutrition to a body.  It’s frustrating that people just don’t want to put the work in to change their lifestyles and are lok=oking for a quick fix at the expense of their long-term health.
 Lawrence 
Luckily most people dont do this.  The vast majority find this laughable. The vast majority of people arent looking for a quick fix. The Visalus people are. They are quick fix people to begin with. Quick fix with diet (i sense the majority are overweight people who never excersized in the first place). So they are ripe for visalus, who need people oriented towards Quick-fix thinking. the 90 day challenge is perfect for this. It attracts the same people who come to me for training and expect huge changes in a month or 2. Long term they are guaranteed to fail on both counts
I keep hearing about people replacing junk food. not going to drive throughs. I dont know many people who do. BUT they do. they are that type of person.

We are not a quick fix and dont claim to be, 90 days is not a quick fix, your know nothing about any of the topics your commenting on.

sorry i meant write and pay if you couldnt figure it out yourself

Oh my goodness! Are you all kids on here or what?! 1st off not everyone is Entrepreneur type people! MLMs are Not for everyone and that includes ALL Networking companies out there not only VISalus! For those of you who decide to trash talk another company it seems like you’re not happy where you are? What do you expect to get out of trash talking this company along with other MLMs out there anyhow? I read and read everything that you all say but all im reading is a lot of gibberish! And a lot of nonsense arguing over what you THINK is a“scam”cuz reading the article then getting to the bottom of it seems like the person scamming everyone is the one trying to sell his/her book to make himself/herself rich which according to the book is to“stay poor”! Think about it people! This person who started it has done pretty well with trash talking a certain company in order to get his/her book out there. No MLMs company is a scam! Just a lot of hard workers changing their lives for the better! No matter what company it is…everyone has their own preferences on what they can do and what they like to do!

always changing the subject…..

When a person buys a computer, a cell phone Tylenol or Advil, it is a done deal and done privately.  When I buy something I am not required to have an upline and a downline and I don’t have to sell and buy and act like you 24 hours a day afterwards.

Stop avoiding and going off track

You are obviously feeling threatend since you post after everyone who has something to say opposite of your own thinking.

btw…. the“90 day challenge”is only promoted to keep people spending money for that long, and then hope they will feel too guilty or scared to stop their order because most people tend to feel trapped after being smothered.

It is no challenge to lose weight by reducing calories.  It is more challenging to learn how to eat healthy and make a lifeling goal out of living healthy.

There are many people who get sick off only drinking protein shakes (any kind for the sake of conversation).  It causes intestinal issues because our bodies are not created to live off liquid nutrition.

You are right.  People need to remember that you can both gain and lose weight by eating food.  Much funner, much easier, much cheaper and much healthier!

Also, visalus is the minority and that is why they get so defensive.  They idolize their products and have meetings like they are going to church.  It is very much like a cult.

I know first hand and second hand the truth behind this all.  It’s very sad.

They will talk down to people simply voicing their opinions.  They brainstorm ways to confront everyone who has something to say that does not go along with their thinking process.

They will have an answer for everything.  Someone who claims to know all the answers is lying about something!

Hey kids, good news…I’m down 30 pounds thanks to Visalus !  not only does it have soy protein (with isoflavones removed), but also whey protein (with the lactose removed) so it’s safe for lactose intolerant folks !  It is vegetarian, but not vegan since the whey protein is sourced from milk.  It also has probiotics and prebiotics to help repair the digestive system to aid in absorption of all the nutrition !  State of the art science !  Audrey Sommerfeld, formerly of Herbalife, came on board in 2007 and helped design the Vi-Shape meal replacement shake. For less than $2 a shake you get better nutrition than ANY alternatives at that price point (McDonalds value meal?  I think not) !  I’m not rich yet, but I did sign on 3 customers and am getting my shakes for free…I’ve only been a promoter for 30 days, so i’ll have to check back and give you updates !  Yes, that’s right I’ve lost 30 pounds in 30 days, but I was 293.5 pounds on 1-1-2012 when I started…so far so good, i’m cautiously optimistic, and excited about the opportunities. Thanks for all the kind words guys, I appreciate your support !  ! !

I only see the quick fix types after new years. They usually last 2 weeks. My training clients are serious about there health and always have been. People looking to get results quick wont stay with ANYTHING long term. Thats why I mentioned“Attrition”before. I see it everyday.

I am a mechanical engineer going for a minor in engineering management and I know for a FACT that my education surpasses yours 10 fold…i joined visalus because I analyzed EVERY aspect of it and noticed a personal friend lose 30 lbs without working out and now he drives around a 5 series with a residual income of $1600 a month at age 21…you can continue to say this is a scam but in reality, those who are involved with visalus wouldn’t want an uneducated little prick like yourself involved in something so amazing…after all we need someone to bag our groceries and take our orders at dinner

This disorder describes a lot (not all) visalus sellers

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a personality disorder[1] in which the individual is described as being excessively preoccupied with issues of personal adequacy, power, prestige and vanity.[2] Narcissistic personality disorder is closely linked to egocentrism.

Symptoms of this disorder include, but are not limited to:
Reacts to criticism with anger, shame, or humiliation May take advantage of others to reach his or her own goal Tends to exaggerate their own importance, achievements, and talents Imagines unrealistic fantasies of success, beauty, power, intelligence, or romance Requires constant attention and positive reinforcement from others Easily becomes jealous Lacks empathy and disregards the feelings of others Obsessed with oneself Mainly pursues selfish goals Trouble keeping healthy relationships Is easily hurt and rejected Sets unreal goals Wants“the best”of everything Appears as tough-minded or unemotional
 integrity 
Narcissists have such an elevated sense of self-worth that they value themselves as inherently better than others. Yet, they have a fragile self-esteem and cannot handle criticism, and will often try to compensate for this inner fragility by belittling or disparaging others in an attempt to validate their own self-worth. It is this sadistic tendency that is characteristic of narcissism as opposed to other psychological conditions affecting level of self-worth.

throw in a bunch of big words and stats and numbers and say whatever you want and we are supposed to just take you at your word right?

“respectable Visalus folk”Now that’s funny.. Lets see–we talk about facts with references–even from visalus’own website–about the whole visalus thing is basically a scam fraught with lies and false hope.

And“the frickin’pope”here resorts to name calling and other obscenities and yet–he is supposed to be respectable.

You, sir, have no honor.

Now go peddle your diet goo elsewhere
 FTP 
The FTC says it’s basically a scam. Look at the economic studies done on MLM’s and look at the due diligence section of the visalus web site. Look at the contracts and agreements you sign and bring them to your lawyer and have them give you an honest opinion..

I think you might be taking“Robert Kiyosaki, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump..”the wrong way. These guys LOVE MLM’s. I would LOVE a MLM–if I owned one because they are profitable for the owners.. The trouble is, they are making their millions off of the backs of people who were lied to and are making less than minimum wage. Over 90% of people involved with MLM’s make little if any money…and every study supports this.

Get the poor dumb people to do the work for the rich people with false promises of prosperity..

Now, if you want ot make money in a MLM–it’s too late for visalus and they will hit saturation fairly soon ( you can find the powder on CL cheap ). IF you believe in the MLM model–try to get in as EARLY as possible and then you can be the guy who’s success will be used to lure other distributors..You want to get into these things *before* in becomes a fad and fades away..
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
For anyone contemplating purchasing Visalus products, just be aware that you can get better products at your local grocery/health food store fore
way less money. Plus you pay shipping and handling charges when purchasing
Visalus products…plus, if you live in Canada, you pay the exchange rate for
Visalus.

The pro-visalus distributors here will try to convince you otherwise, but that’s because they’re worried they won’t make next month’s BMW lease payment, and will say anything to get your money. If you have the time and patience, just read through the posts here…note how all pro-Visalisers label anyone who doesn’t agree with them a“hater”, or lazy, uneducated, misinformed, etc…they’ll throw all kinds of crazy numbers at you, but have no source to back up those numbers.

You can lose weight and get healthy for free, and Visalus’“business opportunity”is just another pyramid scheme (Visalus prefers to be called MLM instead of pyramid scheme, which is like saying callgirl instead of whore).
 Willnotbescammed 
Why are all Visalus distributors so rude and disrespectful ( not to mention semi-literate )?

I guess the MLMr’s are angry with their decision and are trying to cover the fact the the average distributor producers around $500 in sales.

Or that every economic study on MLM’s show that only %5-%10 of people actually make any money..and they are mad they got duped into buying $20 worth of ingredients for $500.. ( hmm.. and the average distributor makes $500 )  Could it possibly be that the majority of the visalus sales are distributorships? Who knows..
 Motoxman30 
you aren’t an ex-visalus distributor.
 CS 
Actually he was a higher level guy–he was one of the 1%’s that actually made money. BUT–he did not make as much money as he thought he did.

HE went bankrupt when his sales peaked and then fell–he tried to play catch-up–doubled his efforts–but then the pyramid collapsed and he was left holding the bag–like the visalus BMW program..

What’s going to happen when you pyramid collapses? You only need a few  bad months and you’re out of the game.
 Motoxman30 
The FTC does not say MLM’s are scams…they agree that some may be set up like pyramid schemes and that it is the persons responsibility to differentiate. http://business.ftc.gov/documents/inv08-bottom-line-about-multi-level-marketing-plans …you obviously didn’t follow the evaluation plan..Robert Kiyosaki, , and Donald Trump do NOT own any MLM’s they simply endorse them and have made their profit elsewhere.  While Warren Buffet used his success to buy out several MLM’s to put his own flare on the company.  It is not hard work in any way considering it takes 10 minutes to figure out how to do it and if someone spent an 8 hour day constantly working on it they would receive a much greater profit than any other type of job.  It is not too late for Visalus in fact there are only 1000 distributors in California.  It is a product that EVERYONE can use and has more of your daily values than you’d be able to find in a week.  Name the study that supports that over %90 of people involved in MLM’s make little money.  In my first week i got a check of $750 and a close friend of mine gets $1600 a month residually and he gets a lifetime $600 a month BMW bonus of which he has a 5 series that he only pays $380/month and pockets the rest.  He is 21 and did this in less than 3 months working PART TIME as in 4-8 hours a week.  The product is amazing as well…its not that it contains all the nutritional value as any other product on the store shelfs, its the fact that it tastes GREAT and you can incorporate over 100 different recipes rather than that one shitty brand of protein powder that tastes like $H!+.  Do you have experience in any MLM business?  Do you know the compensation plan of Visalus and why it has revolutionized the way MLM’s do business?
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
Well said…the main customers (customer base) are the distributors, because to remain as an active distributor, you have to either buy $125 worth of product a month or sell $200 worth of product a month. This is how Visalus remains a legal pyramid scheme, by having more“customer”sales than distributorship sales.

No, not respectable. I’ve had to stop talking to a friend because of his wacky ideas about mlm’s and facebook posts. You know what? I felt bad for him so I bought one of them Amway kits a long time ago. Now he’s trying to sell me this product. Probabaly not bad, but nothing extraordinary.

Like i have said i focus on customers getting product for free and those $0 invoices that come monthly must wreak of a scam lol.

you guys are something else.please find 6 more of you to complete the 12 disciples of hatred.

I keep hearing..we dont like products where the company is trying to make a profit(still hippies??? down with the man) or eating right is the only way to be healthy, if you supplement your giving people things they dont need, but your in favor of GNC?

I am here strictly because a few of you are very amusing.  dave, im sure im totally insane and a social misfit and your a totally normal guy just looking out for the little desperate people we scam out of their hard earned $$$$ lol. You might be more entertaining then egg nog.

they dont have the self awareness or the IQ to understand this.
 corporateamericasucks 
customers count for the promoter as qualifying dollars. So UNLIKE many mlm’s the promoter really does not have to come out of pocket at all as long as they have some customers. Not needed to spend $ and get free product..revolutionary or scam? Numbers dont lie.

Last month around 10k NEW promoters, around 90k NEW customers….ummm i think thats almost a 9 to 1 ratio so how do you get all your figures willnotbescammed? OR, are you just assuming we like the rest?

I would be ashamed if I took a penny from someone by selling them something they didn’t need.

So if we are amusing to you, than you must be getting bored with your vi-folks? I would think it would be more important to you to, but instead you choose to repeatedly comment on posts that you know are going to be against what you are doing.

Visalus blocks people who are not  buyers/users from their conversations for a reason, they can not handle hearing anything but a broken record.
 I Love ViSalus 
Better products? Have you actually looked and compared the labels? I find that hard to believe. ViSalus shakes offer three sources of protein, are WAY lower in carbs, fat, chlesterol and sodium than most and have 30% of RDA of over 20 vitamins and minerals. Add in the digestive enzymes, the fact that its gluten and lactose free and  that the soy protein contains no isoflavones…I would be interested to know the brand name of these“better shakes”
 Motoxman30 
but %99 of the world needs it because they don’t care about their health…fast food has become mainstream, easy, and cheap…visalus shakes are healthy, easy, and cheap compared to an average $5-$10 meal…..its not about selling, its about promoting a healthy lifestyle which very few have…its not only the produc,t its the support that you get while doing your 90 day challenge from other people…visalus knows that unless you write your goals down and keep track of them your chances of succeeding are very slim…i would be ashamed to be a CEO taking %95-%99 of the companies profits leaving the remainder to the people who make the business possible underneath me….whats the real pyramid scheme???  One which promotes the success of the people working under them or one in which you work a 9-5 getting a small portion of what the CEO gets with the possibility of a miniscule raise..EVERY business is shaped like a pyramid and every consumer product is sold to people who dont need it…what your saying is that your ashamed of selling people a health product that EVERYONE need.  Please Elaborate.

Wow…where do you work??? What do you mean by SCAM! How could every single MLM in america be a SCAM.. You have tried them all I am assuming.. You would have to in order to make that observation. Anything that a person does reflects thier character.. If you are an aweful person it doesn’t matter whether you sell shoes or whatever. It is not the company dear, IT IS THE PEOPLE.. If you are the type of person that uses shady tactics and antics it really doesn’t matter what company your with.
 Ex-Visalus Distributor 
What are you talking about? I didn’t say anyting about whatever point you’re trying to make…you’re not addressing what I wrote.

And just out of curiosity, where do you get your numbers from? like when you say“10k NEW promoter…”is it from an outside, non-affiliated source?
 I Love ViSalus 
You drink shakes? Do you take supplements? As a fitness and health professional I assume you are aware of the importance of nutrition and how hard it can be to consume enough through solid foods alone. You should also be aware that due to health issues some people are unable to perform physical activity at all, let alone on a regular basis.

Lets take yourself, or anyone else that is active, works out, etc. Are you able to maintain the proper nutrition without any kind of supplentation? So why not take a product that is far superior to most (yes, I mean superior…read the labels and compare). Taking the product requires no investment. at $2/shake, why not go for something jam packed with nutrition (protein, fibre, over 20 vitmains and minerals), and super low in carbs, fat, sodium, cholesterol?

Or lets take someone that is overweight and looking for a healthier option than some fast food fix while they’re on the go. Why not ViSalus? It comes with an emense amount of support, resources, etc. and works! Yes, it works. Why? Because it is loaded with the nutrients most people are lacking in their daily diet. Why do people have more energy when taking ViSalus shakes? Because they are consuming what their body needs but arent getting in their daily diet. All in a shake that is simple, tastes great and cheaper than a McDonalds Happy Meal.

Those who do decide to promote invest very little and in return get tons of resources as well product for that investment.
I, as a personal trainer, fitness instructor and soon to be nutrition and wellness specialist, love ViSalus products. I began selling just over a year ago because I like the product. I offer it to clients that ask about it. Do i push it…no. Do I reach“quota”every month…no. Am I forced to buy product if I dont have sales…no! I make on average $300 month, already made 7 times my investment. Am I going to quit my job…no.
But I know others that have and are making a killing! Is it going to last forever? Maybe not, but the product is great, the promotion is great and the investment is minimal. Is your job going to last forever? Pretty sure nothing is certain so why not make the best of it.

Quality aside, say they were all‘equal’…Would you not much rather buy something from a friend and give them commission than go buy a similar product from some huge company that benefits no one you know. That’s pretty much a no-brainer in my books.

Ryan, Congrats!! Keep up the great work :)
 Keep your stupid mlm 
Here are Facts about Network Marketing:
-Less than 1 out of 1000 people in this industry will ever
make 6-figures.
-90% of all business WILL fail within their first 5 years
(Entrepreneur Magazine)
-Over 30, Million (yes million) Americans have either
attempted Network Marketing or are currently involved in the industry.
-Yet 90% make less than $10 a week.Why does everyone think this is an
industry of easy-riches when the reality is that most are failing
dismally?
yeah.. it’s a scam..  And this place is CRAWLING with delusional visalus reps trying to say otherwise.
visalus is just another get rich quick scheme where the owners get rich quick off of the backs of the people who paid for the privilege of being exploited.
 Guest123 
Well said.. and visalus uses shady tactics and lies to people with false promises. Plus the CEO is a convicted felon so you are right. Visalus is a sketchy company that is lead by Ryan Blair, a convicted felon, and uses deceptive tactics to lure people into their exploitive enterprise. They misrepresent the products and bury the disclaimers and other important information in the maze of their website. The company bought“visalus scam”add words and put up a bunch of fake websites to refute the facts on mlm’s. The CEO hired a PR team and paid people to post positive  reviews on amazon. ( then amazon removed them–Blair went whining to his FB group and told people to post positive reviews )

yeah.. a shitty company run by a shitty person
 I Love ViSalus 
Do you have brand names of these‘better”products? I’d like to compare the quality/ingedients as I have spent about 2 years looking for a protein source that I am willing to put into my body (that I can actually stomach) and have yet to find anything that compares to the nutrition or taste of ViSalus shakes. Seriously, 2 bucks a shake…how is that expensive?
 Lawrence 
totally unsubstantiated claim. There are no official direct visalus numbers. they are self proclaimed. They use PRnews (Direct selling news uses this). ANYONE can make a claim on Prnews. I know because i have used them in another business Im involved with. To get direct numbers you have to get the numbers from the blyth financials.
 Lawrence 
MLM companies ARE NOT REQUIRED to provide such data.
 corporateamericasucks 
here are the facts about real businesses. about the same, yes you would think they make more then $10 a week BUT how much more is their initial investment?

How many people in networking even do anything like make a call, or let people know what they do? what is considered failing?
 corporateamericasucks 
research blythe if you want they are a public company so numbers can be found. But most importantly….when you find out its true, will your opinion change?
 corporateamericasucks 
Customers and promoters are 2 totally different things here. thats what a lot of you cannot grasp. im not avoiding your main question at all, im actually trying to respond.

And just to correct you(even though im sure you know this since your an ex rep lol)you say“this is how visalus remains a legal pyramid scheme…. There is no such thing as a legal pyramid scheme. Unless all business you consider that? A pyramid scheme is a company selling nothing, no product which is not the case with us.
 corporateamericasucks 
sooooo to sum it up, exactly what i just said about looking into blythe???
 Lawrence 
Didnt you say that after my post? Thanks for backing me up your a good man corp. HAVE YOU READ THEM?
 Lawrence 
BTW. Its BLYTH not BLYTHE

Urge new recruits to buy products on a subscription basis…Check
Invest in sales material i.e. magazines dvd’s..Check
Pay for ongoing training until they give up or run out of money..Check
Ostracizes quitters when they discover contradictory information about the legitimacy of the program..Check
Investment in products for which you do not have orders in hand for i.e. samples are all hallmarks of a product based pyramid scheme.
 your life is a scam 
Network marketers become educated in the business over a short period of time and realize what momentum is…you say that %90 of all businesses will fail within their first 5 years…you must be delusional…there are over 100 SUCCESFUL MLM’s that have been around for quite some time but you haven’t heard of them because you know nothing about them..and if you haven’t noticed the US is in an economic recession because the old business model does not work…cite your sources…these are all opinions you are putting out there…this place is CRAWLING with delusional idiots like yourself trying to say otherwise…this article is inaccurate and as for making $10 a week that is a completely fabricated lie…my first week i made $750 for 3 hours of work in visuals…i was once in your shoes bitchin about other peoples success in the MLM industry until I found visuals which introduced a new compensation plan that revolutionized the industry…please tell me your experience in MLM’s I’d love to hear it because all of your so-called facts are merely biased opinions…you obviously have no idea wtf your talking about…please explain visuals’compensation plan, how to get the BMW, what products they offer and how many people have gotten healthier from it, what business your in, your level of education?? As far as I’m concerned my engineer background proves that my education surpasses yours 10 fold because I analyze every aspect of a decision I make…you on the other hand feel like Hercules because you have all of these people sharing the same biased but in reality your just surrounded by more negative people who probably don’t make more than $10 a week because they sit at home posting negative feedback on whatever they can find…so please if your going to diss visuals then learn about it before you do because you obviously have no idea what your talking about.

Actually, if you price the ViSalus versus other weight loss shakes such as SlimFast, they’re priced about the same. Now take into consideration that ViSalus is a much more nutrient-packed product and has greater variety and quality of flavors and you’ve got a really simple choice.

As for comparing it to protein powders…unless you’re buying the extreme low-quality Wal*Mart powders, ViSalus is actually priced below the average. Once again, much more nutrient-packed, albeit with less protein and fat than most competitors.

As for the promoters and such, it really is no different from Mary Kay, Avon, Tupperware, etc…and you don’t call those scams do you? Yes there is a lot of failure in MLMs, but it is quite possible to have some success. It’s the same risk as starting your own brick-and-mortar business, but with a considerably lower overhead. Is promoting for everybody? Goodness no…I wouldn’t recommend promoting a product until you’ve had some experience with the actual product.

I personally am a promoter. I’m not in it to make money per say, but I do actually bring in about 2000 a month on it. Is that much? No. It’s great supplemental income though. I’m on the 50 dollar a month plan as I use it more as a workout shake than a weight loss shake. Most of my customers use it as a weight loss shake and still only spend around 100 a month on it.

Now you’ll go and say that I’m undereducated or gullible or whatever, and truthfully I don’t care. I’ve got my Masters in Exercise Physiology, I am a NASM, ACE and ACSM certified personal trainer (I got different certifications as needed for different jobs). I worked hard and now own my own gym. I do honestly believe with that background I can speak with decent knowledge of both entrepreneurship and of nutritional supplements. I believe in the efficacy of ViSalus just as I believe in the effectiveness of MuscleTech products, SlimFast products and other such products. That’s not saying that taking the time to prepare a healthy meal wouldn’t be a better option, but as the success of McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, etc. shows, the average American either doesn’t know how or won’t take the time to do it. That also shows why 2/3 of Americans are overweight, and half of those are listed as obese. Don’t knock a product that works, isn’t overly expensive and can help to lower those very unfortunate numbers. Is it a cure-all, of course not…but can it help? That’s a resounding YES.

Back to the business portion of it…every business is a“pyramid scheme”if you want to look at technicalities. There’s always going to be somebody above you making more than you…there’s always going to be people that succeed with a lot of hard work (and a couple that get by on other factors)…and there’s always going to be people that just can’t hack it. Wait…isn’t that applicable to EVERYTHING in life? Yes ViSalus offers incentives that seem ludicrous, but they’re still achievable. As for the BMWs in particular, you could buy a cheap used black bmw on eBay for just a couple of thousand dollars and ViSalus sill STILL pay you the 600 a month to own it. All you have to do is put their emblem on the back just as auto dealerships do. How is that overbranding as someone stated above? Plus if you don’t think you can afford the BMW, hit that level and they’ll pay you 300 dollars a month instead. If you go either of those routes, you can get that bonus and then keep trying to hit that level again and again to keep it. How is that bad?

I’ve seen a number of comments about selling people stuff they don’t need…TV, Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, DVDs, expensive clothing, diamonds…oh yeah we definitely need all of that stuff…We’re hardly a society of just needs. Despite what anybody may say, ours is a culture bases solely on instant gratification…I WANT and I WANT IT NOW…nutritionally and weight-loss wise, ViSalus offers a cost-effective (even the more expensive packages are comparable if not cheaper than if you were to get all of the components from competitors brands), streamlined way to meet that goal. It isn’t perfect, but it’s definitely good.

On a final note, those that make negative comments about people posting their body sizes and whatnot…it’s a weight-loss/nutrition product, it makes sense to use personal stories of weight-loss success when talking about it. As with ANY plan like this, exercise is recommended for best results…that being said,  losses are possible even with just consuming the healthier shakes/meals and living a sedentary lifestyle. Please don’t mock somebody for being proud that they’re losing weight, getting healthier and feeling better even if you don’t like the product.

drug dealers give free drugs too, trying to entice people, and they make more money than all of us!

the mlm I have issues with is visalus.  I believe that is the topic here.

You said that“the old business model doesn’t work?”….there are 1000000+ of people making great money working with benefits.  How long has the world been spinning?

You said that we“haven’t heard about”the 100 mlm companys out there? That is because they are failing and only successful in small quantities, and that is why new schemes are plotted with the same agenda.  If you haven’t noticed MLM companies are temporary“jobs”for people like you.

And by the way you can not claim to“make 750.00 in the first week”because you have to deduct all your buy in money and money spent buying products, paying for website etc….and also talking about income and cars is not of interest here.

I’m interested in telling people the truth about health and fitness, not quick fix and get rich quick schemes.

Yes visalus promotes quick fix and rich quick.  Sellers brag about people and how quick they lose weight and how quick they get money.  quick scam

Telling others they have no idea what they are talking about is non productive.

You do not need to be here getting heated over people who disagree with you, you know.  You have your mlm people to talk to who think just like you.

The U.S. is in an economic recession because of the housing market crash in 2007 not because of traditional business models that account for 99.95% of the economy. Personal retailing is a thing of the past not the wave of the future.
 Ron 
Everyone is entitled to their opinions even when wrong. The only difference between you and most other bashers is you try to appear intelligent by promoting some worthless rag you call a success book. I have not read it nor would I waste my time due to the simple fact that if you are not even able to state the actual facts of the business you are attacking, you are left with absolutely no credibility. In fact, I don’t even know why I’m even wasting my time writing this to you. You obviously are probably a highly educated, frustrated, jealous, envious individual that can’t understand how in the world can someone without education do better than you. So you what most people do who can’t make it in the real world, they try to give advice.
 Contextswitch 
Ron, you started off well in that everyone is entitled to their opinion. Then you assume you are right and they are wrong. Then you assume the book is worthless–even though you admit you did not read it. Then you state it’s not worth your time–and yet here you are. And then you assume that he’s
“frustrated, jealous, envious individual”–how do you know you are doing better than him? Do you have his tax returns?

Did this little tirade make you feel better–or relevant?

Enjoy your MLM–but try not be be so sensitive to other opinions that contradict what you hold to be true. The truth will be revealed to you in time. Either you will fail like 90+% of MLMers. or, you will make a few bucks and struggle to maintain your group like 9.99%, Or you will“make it”and enjoy some good income–like the 0.01%.

I wish you luck
 your mom’s a scam 
For someone who’s“educated”you got it all wrong.

Fact: The economy tanked because of deregulation and the finance sector took too much risk

Fact: the visalus compensation plan is simply front loading the payouts–to make it appear more attractive

Fact: the product is your basic protein powder. not a cure all

Fact: You must be a bad engineer–as every engineer I know are make $80k-$1.5mm and have no desire to get into retail sales. they get stock options, health plan, 401k

Fact: As a visalus“rep”you are simply an 1099 contractor.. Nothing more. not benefits. and all you need is a few bad months before your pyramid collapses.

Fact: you are forced to pay to play to stay in the game. Sales will flatten and then dry when the next fad hits the market–it’s only a matter of time

I read the label and am horrified. There is nothing in there but sugar in various forms and bits and pieces of amino acids and chemicals.  I wouldn’t put this product in my body if you paid me.
 Duped 
Shit, I didn’t even know he was selling a book. I was here just to read the BS distributors spew.

I’ll give it the the CEO and partners. Good on them for becoming rich and making it.

The distributors, sorry, no respect.
 Texans79 
Visalus pyramid scheme, wow Ive heard alot of ranting and raving over this company both good and bad.  Heres the deal, in every self employed business you get what you put into it.  When your self employed you can work part time or full time but never sometime, thats where people fail.  In every retail sales job you have to be a salesperson in order to sell, if your not your going to fail.  You have to sell the best product in the world (Yourself).  I was in retail sales for ten years and became the general sales manager.  I know for a fact not everyone is cut out for sales.  You need  to plan your work and work your plan, constant follow up, prospecting, and in any job you need to work EVERY DAY LIKE SOMEONE IS COMING TO TAKE YOUR JOB.  Customers dont just show up at your doorstep it takes work.  Also nutrition is a way of life, not a 60 or 90 day challenge.  So if you feel that any product or company will suddenly cure you from being lazy and eating junk food it wont.  Any company can make a claim or stand behind their product,what they cannot stand behind is you (the individual or sales person.)  Because many people feel they can take a magic pill and poof all your years of laziness and not working out will disappear.  If you think that signing on to any mlm company will get your rich it wont, because again it takes work.  Some people think they will  sign on and magically a hundred people will show up under them, it wont happen.  But there is Girards law of 250, numbers show every person will meet or know at least 250 people in their life time if you can sell to 7 of them ( 3%) then thats how a sales pipeline grows, it takes time and doesnt happen over night.  As to whether this company is a scheme, I wouldnt make an opinion until you analyze the person making their claim? Is the person having success working out, selling, living healthy?  Is the person whos angry not taking the product, not sales oriented, hasnt sold or signed up one person and just waiting for everyone else to carry the load?  Are they trying to sell the most expensive thing first, or recommending their client to first try the product something small then gradually move them up when they see the results.  It all depends on a persons approach, in any business a client wont trust you if they feel you are only trying to make a sale. (if you use it trust it and beleive it then they will buy from you.)  I myself wouldnt buy a weight loss pill or protein shake from an obese person would you?  Also Im hearing the monthly sales to stay active is at least 200$, lets see, 200/4.33 is about 46 dollars in sales a week.  First of all If you have never taken the product, or work out or live healthy, there is no way your going to promote a sale of 46 dollars a week or even 15 dollars a week.  I wouldnt buy anything from someone who doesnt look like they use it.  Its like selling kitchen supplies, cars, or realestate,if the only people you talk to is your family or friends, then youll be out of prospects within two weeks, for sales to work you have to shake alot of hands its a numbers game, the more people you talk to the more you will sell.

Visalus is different, how?
 Mena 
Wow!  So many cranky unhappy people on here! Get a life!  All MLM’s are NOT bad Lots of Mlm’s  help people out  to put a few  extra bucks in their pockets each month.. All people are not out scamming..Look over what may be appealing.
It may be a MLM clothing line.. Or Tupperware.. Or Visalus.  They all have parties.
Sell their wares.. People  NEED to lose weight  For many people it has helped  and supported them in weight loss and income gain.
People need to store things  Thus tupperware..  If you have a 9-5 job with benefits  and someone else is controlling your life  Great  Live that.. It’s not for us all..

The fellow trying to sell  the book    Go ask Barnes and Noble  to  market for you  After all they sell  the 90 day challenge ( visalus)  magazine.. Imagine..
Taking an action step instead of fear marketing…
 @Mena 
I’m not cranky nor unhappy. The odd of you making any real money after expenses is near zero.

In your MLM–everyone is controlling your life. You upline and your downline and the company you work for.

We’re just not buying your lies..
 Elizzyp 
You have got to be kidding.  What world do you live on. read all the post here read all the 1900 and see if you can learn something. I am not cranky or unhappy I did fall for the scam
 Visalus made me sick 
Visalus: yet another get rich quick scheme run by a guy with a long documented history of criminal activity.

Like PT Barnum says: There’s a sucker born every minute

If you want to lose weight: diet / eat right / exercise

If this was such a wonder product–then why are there NO nutritionists recommending it. Why hasn’t the council of physicians made an announcement? Why is the promotion all testimonials and ZERO peer-reviewed studies

because it’s simply a diet fad

So, visalus contractors–please stop exploiting the trust of your family and friends for your personal gain. You buy a sales kit and all of a sudden you care about their health?
 Lawrence 
VISALUS FINANCIAL CLAIMS ARE UNSUBTANTIATED. MLMS DO NOT HAVE TO POST ECONOMIC DATA.
Everyone in the universe knows about the hundreds of other mlms. Is this new info to you.?
You said you have an engineer background. So you drove a train? Or did you mean engineering.
I own a fairly large business. It is obvious to me that most of you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about business.
 Lawrence 
You Brought up education . Personally I have an advanced Degree. Visalus is looking for the uneducated.
 Lawrence 
If you really made 750$ in 3 hours. your first day. THAT OUGHT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. That will not be sustainable. By the way you can make alot more than that in REAL business. BUT most of you would not have the discipline to stick with something long term.
 Elizzyp 
They give it awasy because it is cheap to make and they bring them in lots of money.  They aren’t giving anything they taking.
 Elizzyp 
Pyramids are legal because they have a product, it doesn’t mateer how worthless (Visalus). Are they ethical, in my opinon no.  If you don’t have a product then you have a ponzi scheme which is illegal. Pyramid indicates that you need to recruit other people.
 Elizzyp 
You get a worthless product free if you talk 3 of your friends to buy it at the outrageous regular price. If there is a ratio of 9 to 1 (really really doubt this being true) it is only because you are still in the process to recruit the other nine.
 Elizzyp 
In the world of Visalus they just grab numbers fronm the air, what ever sounds good will do.
 Elizzyp 
They are not going to turn over their financial to you and if they did you would not be able to understand them and you would not be able to figure out how many direct customers verus distributors. There would not be any public numbers for that unless they just made some up and threw athem out there.
 Elizzyp 
Yes he is.  Is know to much about the inner works not to be.
 Elizzyp 
Go to any store and there will be a wide varity to choose from.  Ones actually good enough to compete in quality and price.  I like Boost or Endure, I like that they are ready to drink uncap and drink.
 the frickin’pope 
Hey Kids !  How’s your frothing animosity today ?
Misery loves company, and you’re sure miserable bunch !
Trying to bring everyone else down…I’m losing weight, and feeling great !

Ok, for todays edutainment, I have a few corrections for the ignorant regulars here:
Visalus primary product is not a protein shake silly.  It’s a meal replacement shake, with full nutrition, not just protein.
Blyth now owns 57.5% of the company (source: NASDAQ.com) and also owns other direct marketing (that’s the term kids, NOT pyramid scheme :) companies (PartyLite candles is another of their direct marketing companies). Visalus is a sales driven company, by customers not promoters, there are 5–7 customers for every promoter, which immediately debunks your claim of pyramid, as the products are the reason for the sales !  I’m guessing all the detractors here tried and failed to lose weight or make money with Visalus.  Just because YOU are a failure, doesn’t mean the products don’t work!  Don’t blame others for your failures and inadequacies !
 Elizzyp 
Godh, you Visalus people are so crude and vulgar.  You are just showing that Visalus doesn’t screen for quality of quanity of their reps.  No wonder they will not even recognize you as employees or representative. I don’t see were you are coming off saying this sight is selling anything. There are some sarcasm ads here but buy anything don’t thinkso.  Hey out there anyone bought anything off this sight………..I wish Visalus would get some new brainwashing. I get so tired of the term haters.
 Elizzyp 
Good post.  I think you found the answer.  Also liked your not interested in your upline, downline, or waistline.  Kudos
 Elizzyp 
You make no sensense if all the big names you mentioned endorses MLMs how come they didn’t make their money that way. Sure he gets the money for his BMW for life or til he quits selling $12,500 a month. Which do you think will come first. Any kind of shake you can put anything in it. Get real.
 Elizzyp 
I have a very strong moral compass I would never ever ask my friends to buy or get involved in this stuff. I respect them to much and my self to much.  What is a sure give away that this is a scam 1 you have to pay to sell their product? 2. you have to pay all the expenses to sell their product.3. They use human nature to suck you end.4. They they give away a product if you sell others 5 You have to buy or sell a set amount a month. 6 all compensation, titles, etc is only month to month. 7 You have all the exposure even on your BMW. 8 the companies does not take any responsonibility 9 They refuse to recognize your relationship to them 10 You have to recruit others.  Screams SCAM. If my family and friends need helposing weight I would hope they would go to a professional and what I would advise. Eat the right food and exercise.  Not take some worthless over exgaerated shake.  I just could not do it.
 Duped 
Sorry, but I’ve never ever had to use a“meal replacement shake”.

Lol!!!
 Elizzyp 
Take a nother look their protein is soy protein which has been discovered to cause high estrone levels which can damage your panacraes and other organs .
 Elizzyp 
that is called a caffeine withdrawal headache will stop in about a week without caffeine.  Which is no big deal as there all kinds of things that have the no-caffeine varity. Some studies even show caffeine can be good for you and does fight fatty deposits.
 Elizzyp 
You are pityful.
 Elizzyp 
Hey haven’t you been to the movies in the last year.  Zombies are the big thing now. You Visalus people should be a great hit.
 Thefrickenpoop 
“the fricken pope”:Move along.. no one is buying your pyramid scheme here.It’s is just a protein powder–nothing else.In fact–compare it to“carnation instant breakfast”. Wow. It’s almost identical!!!!Visalus is based upon perpetual recruitment–and is a pyramid.If you were not so insecure with your business decision–you wouldn’t be pitching your lies to a educated audience. If you’re losing weight? Great.. Congrats. But it’s because you worked at it and not the patent powder you are pushing.We are not failures.. Quite the contrary. And one of the reasons is we make smart business decisions based on facts and not BS hype from a company run by a couple of con men funded by their wealthy step-father.So go pound your protein elsewhere..
 Elizzyp 
Yeah you can tell you just started. Anybody but me find it funny that everyone jsut started. Why are you attacking me I didn’t scam you.  I love to see people succeed if they don’t do it at the debterment of someone else. There are enough scams out there to have to worry about your friends and family scamming you too.
 TFP 
you’re the failure for falling for the scam..
you’re the failure for exploiting your friends and family for personal gain.
you’re the failure because you are unable to think for yourself and simply regurgitate what you are told.

look in the mirror–failure..
 Elizzyp 
You do not a thing about me. Talking about trying to make other people look bad to make yourself look better. Just what are you doing.  I would rather bag groceries, take orders, or pick up trash than scam the people that love me.  Yead you got real class my friend.
 Elizzyp 
The only good way to lose weight is to eat right and exercise anyone who tells you different are not a professional.  Visalus is a worthless product used in a pyramid scheme. Enough said
 Elizzyp 
You don’t have to worry about me being your competition.  This is one game I would never play .  I care to much about my family and friends. I have to live with myself.
 Elizzyp 
Are you really that dumb, tell me you aren’t that dumb of course they have paid endorsers.  get real.
 the frickin’pope 
If you’re against Visalus, that’s fine, don’t buy it. Don’t drink it.  No one is forcing you. I haven’t even asked you to. One of you haters claims to own a gym, that’s not the only way to get fit, Herschel Walker never touches a barbell or weight, he trains solely with pushups, situps, jumping rope…so by your logic, the gyms are a scam as one can get fit without a gym.  It’s a tool to facilitate fitness, just like Visalus products, it’s not a miracle product, it’s not the only way to lose weight, but it is A way, it’s an option, it’s a tool to help people lose weight and get healthy. That’s what you all lose sight of with your crying and tough guy posturing. I’m a walking billboard, and people approach me and ask me what I’m doing, I’m not selling anything, I don’t have to sell it. People see success and want to emulate that. It works for me, so it can work for them. Maybe it’s not much different than Carnation instant breakfast, but they don’t pay me to sell their product. Just like celebrities, do people REALLY think if they wear the same watch as Dicaprio they will have his success. No. This entire website is guilty of the exact same thing with all these fantasy dream cars and models, that 99% of all visitors here will never have. People need hope and dreams, and who are you to try to talk them out of it. How dare you.  You can improve yourself, be happier, move out of your moms basement, and be able to face the mirror again !  Good luck to all you haters, change your outlook, change your attitude. Don’t hate celebrate !  Love&amp;kisses, the frickin’Pope y’all !
 Thefrikinpoop 
Not buying.. not drinking.. so stop pounding your protein here.

Thank for admitting is“not much different than Carnation instant breakfast”and you’re only after the $.

Celebrities? You’re bringing in celebrities to prove your point?

…….Did you leave your prescription helmet at home?…….

And thanks for admitting that the real product is selling hopes and dreams–and how dare YOU to exploit the trust of you’re friends and families with a losing scam.

You are selling tickets to a plane that has already left the runway. .

You post is exactly why people should not join a MLM scam like visalus..It’s all about exploiting hope and dreams and not about a solid, ethical, business,

Thank you!!
 your life is a scam 
hey corporateamerica sucks…i say screw these guys…we know what we are talking about and the fact that these guys think they can tell us otherwise is quite pathetic…they can insult the business all they want but the truth is they don’t know anything…its sad that they have to check back here every half hour to post negative feedback on something theyve never experienced…its like me saying that their business is a scam even though I have no idea what they do…MLM’s are the business of the 21st century and our team is proof that it does work…there is no point in arguing over pointless things because as visalians we know that we shouldn’t bring ourselves to that level where we have to talk shit about other people to feel good about ourselves…we have stated the facts and they still hold those common beliefs of pyramid schemes and a crashing market…it does sadden me to read some of these comments but you can’t change someone so don’t try persuading them…we are on their territory in a falsely written article but if they came into our territory they would be torn apart…I say drop it and just read rather than reply…it begins to amuse you to see how much time these people waste on pointless matters…we know it works and we know that by the time the market is saturated there will be another one that pops up that is just as good…if you have any self control please do not reply to this with negativity…i will not respond
 your life is a scam 
not true at all…im not gonna change your mind i just think you should use your time more wisely than checking back here everyday to post negativity on something you dont know about…dont reply because i sure as hell wont read it

I was considering joining visalus until I did some research. This research brought me here ( as well as other places ).

The anti-mlm people here seem to be very articulate and present very good arguments with third-party references.

the pro-visalus people are very childish and appear to be desperate.

THANKS TO ALL ON THIS SITE!!!! you’ve helped me make a well informed decision.

Peace!

I am not a Visalus distributor.  I do have to say that after reading the company’s legal guidelines for distributors that this article is full of inaccuracies.  Furthermore, they are trashing Visalus to sell you a book…don’t waste your time listening to these frauds.

Truth / reality are not posturing…Fact: I’ve lost 30 pounds, people
in my sphere, have seen this, and inquire about HOW i’ve done it, and
I’ve done it with Visalus Meal Replacement shakes, so they too want to
lose weight, thus they want to try it.  People see that I have
successfully lost weight…I guess that is difficult to comprehend if
you have cheese doodles for brains. Thanks for this forum to help us get
the truth out. Visalus products work !  Thank you and good night !
 CS 
then why are you here?

What are the inaccuracies you mentioned?

i’m not buying the book either..
 CS 
So how fat were you?

You could have done the same thing with a slim-fast shake

the only truth that’s out is visalus is a scam.

thanks you!

If you lost weight, it was because you reduced your caloric intake from before.  There is nothing in visalus or any protein shake that causes weight loss.  Hopefully you are not claiming that there are ingredients in visalus that cause weight loss.

It is free to reduce caloric intake, so for someone to spend money on a product they don’t need is a waste of money.
 Yet another liar 
So someone who has no stake in visalus claims to have read the legal guidelines and then felt the need to come on here and tell potential visalus folk to ignore the frauds?

Right–you have no financial stake in visalus.. umm.. sure..

why are all the pro-visalus people such transparent liars?
 Visalus rep 
As a Visalus Director I encourage Visalus members to continue on with what they are doing.  Feel free to read through the article and through the comments however,  do not feed the fire by adding your own input.  This is a site where people have found refuge to share their opinions on why they think Visalus is a scam.  True Visalians know exactly what to do when they see this which is ignore it and find more positive things to feed their mind with.

As for those first timers who have happened to stumble accross this page because you want to find out more information on the company, this is not the site for you.  These comments will deter you from a great opportunity.  This site is one of the only ones in which Visalus is seen as a scam and the article has been falsified to prove a point.  If you are really interested in this company please check their website http://visalus.com/about/about-visalus/ to learn what they are about and review the success stories on YouTube as well as other un-biased sources on Google.  Visalus isn’t for everyone and we understand that but for those who feel they wanna take on the challenge of obtaining a healthy and financially stable lifestyle we have amazing teams all around the U.S. and Canada that are ready to help you reach those goals.

There is nothing un-biased about going to a visalus website, or youtube because it is all visalus sellers/promoters etc.

You do not want anyone hearing anyones opinion or getting knowledge from anyone else because you fear someone might realize they are about to get duped/scammed/taken.

Nobody needs to spend money on a product they don’t need.  The complaints here are because visalus is nothing new, nothing spectacular and it is blown out of proportion.

Getting healthy does not involve drinking visalus or any protein shake.

Getting healthy involves healthy eating, and exersize.  Cut back your calories and you will lose weight and save money.  There is no need to spend extra money for results you can get for free.

Anyone who is willing to stop eating unhealthy foods is going to lose weight and get all the great benefits from living a healthy lifestyle which has ALWAYS been available.

I agree. Let us on your territory. Visalus wont allow us to comment on there blogs. Open it up. I d be glad to have a discussion on your site.

Wow, so many people here and again if you read my previous post I lay it out there. Diets wont work for people who think they are magic.  If you take a diet product and it doesnt work youll say oh its a scam it doesnt work, (no its you who didnt balance your diet, and excercise).  Again, if you were to sell cars, ( you wouldnt last 90 days) then youd say the dealership is a scam.  Its not the dealership its you your not sales oriented.  If you were to get into realestate, you wouldnt last the 180 day period because it takes work, theres no one there to feed you customers, and you have to prospect daily.  If you become a money manager, you have to prospect for new clients, so if you go there and you suck is the company a scam? So for those of you who get into mlm and wonder why its not working for you its because your not sales oriented and you werent successful at it.  Its amazing how many people who are not sales oriented think that they can join a company that deals with the distribution of a product and actually think that they can make money at it.  Commission based jobs and self employed jobs are the only jobs where you decide what you make, you set your earning potential, if you do nothing you make nothing.  As far as pyramid scams, hmm lets see, if you work for a company, you have coworkers who work with you, you have supervisors, they have supervisors who respond to the CEO who then responds to the owner or owners of the company.  The guys at the top, who decide what everybody at the bottom makes. You work for an hour you get paid for an hour, then one day like in 2008-2009 they downsize and fire you? It happened to many people.  That seems like a pyramid to me, and if your a worker your at the bottom, you dont decide how much you make, they tell you how much to make, when to come in and when to go home, so whos the one getting scammed and whos the one actually in a pyramid, the people who decide when to work and how much to make, or the ones being told when to work, and how much to make?
 Lawrence 
this makes no sense whatsoever. Im not sure how to respond. Im not a hater . But im not sure you can understand that. How could you possibly come up with such an idiotic analogy regarding my gym. OF COURSE one can get fit without a gym. Any one with 2 brain cells rubbing togeather understands that. Why on earth would you think i would consider that a scam. I myself do the kind of workout herschel walker does.
Forget Visalus. If you walked into my gym and picked one of the shakes i sell off the wall and told me you were gonna get in shape by using it. I would tell you its worthless. Get in the gym and workout. OR go by a mountain pike.OR walk 20min every morning. Weight loss requires a lifestyle change. You dont have to do it my way. If you want to use visalus. Use it.

WTF is a Visalian?

I  keep hearing, A pizza shop goes out of business, a gym goes out of business, is that a scam? HUH? OF COURSE NOT. Its a real business. that requires REAL risk. and REAL work. How does this analogy make ANY logical sense. They have nothing in common with MLM models.

The most positive thing Visalians can can fill their minds with is the fact that visalus is a scam.. They’ll be WAY better off financially by avoiding this cult.

The article is“falsified”? By whom?

Since you are a‘director’how about you answer a few questions that a fledgling contractor might have.

1) What percentage of sales is product vs distributorships?

2) What is the income breakdown of each quartile for distributors/promoters?

3) provide some proof and back up your claim about the financially stable lifestyle visalus provides?

4) provide or cite double blind controlled studies that your magic powder is better..

I will await your reply…

Boy are you mixed up on so many fronts. You don’t go out and recruit your co workers or the people you supervise.  You don’t pay them to work for them, you don’t pay their expenses, they don’t disavow you. Something is wrong in this world (Visalus world) were people who hold a job and contribute are looked down on. Get real if you have a job you have benefits, helathinsurance, 401K, a company car that the company is responsible for, a company that pays their side of social security, unemployment taxes so if you lose your jonb you will have something to fall back on, paid vacation, holidays and sick days. With an MLM you have nothing…….nothing.  Get some common sense and at least pretend you got a brain.

I can not believe some one would come here and give orders to the zombies not to comment. Are you afraid they will spill the beans. If you are a Visalus seller please read everything here and get out or you lose more than your money but the respect of your friends and family.  I know how I felt when some of my family thried to get me into this mess; I felt betrayed, uncared for.  I would have never done that to them. Anyone who is thinking about joining Visalus read all that is here. See the low quality of perople who sell for Visalus. See how they flood the web with their false led ins and wonder what are they trying to hide. There are no facts falsified here, you noticed they did name any. We have one word for you RUN. Run as fast as you can away from Visalus.

Visalus seems be geting scammier by the day.

All of the research shows that 99% of the MLM promoters/distributors are doomed to fail.

It’s simple mathematics due to the recruitment-driven nature of MLM.

Add to that the commercial cult like environment of visalus.. Simply sounds like an awful experience.

One of the other MLM’s which is larger than visalus which a near identical compensation plan  and had experienced similar growth early on went on record stating that over %50 make less than $2k /year and less than 1 quarter of one percent, or 0.0025, make over $29K a year..

Visalus, for some reason, doesn’t publish their data. You think the would–hell–I might even sign up if the numbers worked!

Never tried to lose weight, would not sell Visalus. I’ll keep my soul, thnak you

according to a study posted on cnn.com, if a person worked for themselves and put in the SAME amount they do being an employee they would make 5 times what they currently so by making 5x more all of those benefits you can get on your own and then enjoy that xtra money. Its a mindset, so are content and happy some aren’t.

I think you need to get a life. No one here even notices the book, not even sure it exists I took it for sarcasm. Not cranky very happy I did not fall for the scam.  If people need to lose weight eat healthy and exercise, in gym, in front of the TV, take a walk, just exercise.
 CS 
Your reasoning is a good example of lax critical thinking skills..

visalus is a pyramid scheme because most of the money aggregates to the top %1. The ones who got it early and sit at the point of the pyramid.

the one’s getting in now are screwed and will pay for the“opportunity”to make less than minimum wage.

why? To keep the balloon inflated you need to recruit more and more people.. And everyone you recruit is a direct competitor.  You cannot recruit forever–eventually you get saturation and the balloon deflates and the pyramid collapses.. And guess who’s holding the bag?

Anyone considering a MLM should at least be give a chance to learn the truth–and yet–all visalus shows them are the exceptions–and not the rule

the reduced calories come from being full from a shake with 200 calories instead of that 600 cal breakfast.

It is free to reduce calories, but if its easy as you claim why do SO many people have such a hard time doing it???

Your principles and beliefs have nothing to do with visauls being a scam, you just dont believe in supplements.

SO DONT TAKE THEM, so people need them to get the ball rolling. If your not one of them good for you, but to discourage people that need that kick in the butt who do you think you are to tell them no?

The few of you keep saying the same thing over and over, you say the cult is making us say things but in reality YOU sir are the one that keeps doing that.

Strange, what cult are you in? What MLM did you do in the past?

Can you agree that many people spend more then $2 on breakfast or lunch?

I say sign up if your a sales minded person.  Dont fall for the get rich quick scheme.  You have to actually use it, and then sell it.  Dont sign up on any autoshipment of anykind, for any mlm.  If you really think you can sell anything, stay active by selling and not making your wallet part of the monthly draft.  Thats what these people are bitching about, they thought they could sign onto an mlm, and pay money to stay active just to see how many legs are placed under them.  The truth is they became their own best customer, and thats why they failed.  I read what these pikers have to say and laugh, because you can tell who got greedy and thought,“oh if i just buy enough every month in a few months Ill have so many people under me that I wont need to work or sell or sign anyone for myself.  You know who these weak people are by reading their statements.  You know who the fat people are by reading their statements. Yes your fat and lazy if you say it doesnt work.  Its not body builder strength, its fat people strength, body builders wont go to a company like Visalus and take a product with 14 g of protein, neither will athletes or  people who are fit, because they are fit, they will go to GNC and powerload on a stronger product.  These same people bitching probably tried the Atkins diet, Jenny Craig, The grape fruit diet, and failed miserably at them as well, its not the product or the companies, its them.

It’s paid out over 12 months.  My best friend just received hers.

She works anywhere she wants and is making over $15k a month.  She might work 3 full hours a day.

Gluten has been researched and proven to cause infertility.  Going on a gluten free diet (Visalus is gluten free) has enabled many women to conceive.  I drink and promote them because I have a gluten allergy. I’ve drank 1 shake a day, at lunch, for over a year.  I am thin and do not need to loose weight, nor was I trying.  I was just trying to consume something better for me than junk.  I lost 6 lbs in 14 months without any other change.

I call bulls*it on Visalius or whatever it’s called. Come on people, get a real job. Eat healthy and exercise, that’s how to lose weight.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is scamming you.  Don’t buy into these pyramid schemes…especially in this economy…people are desperate and will do anything to rip people off/make a buck.

I am having a little trouble understanding how it is unethical to promote healthy weightloss and boosting nutritional intake, unsustainable to encourage others to promote the same, and nonproductive to make residual income on all these ventures that I operate with honesty and integrity?  I myself use the shakes for weightloss and nutritional value, as well as many of my own family members. All of us are feeling better, more energetic and losing weight at a slow, healthy pace. Using a shake as a meal replacement is no gimmick OR new idea, its also being promoted in the retail market at many weight loss establishments (Herbal Magic, GNC, Popeyes etc) The only difference is you are contributing to the income of a large corporation purchasing through these establishments as opposed to supporting small business and entrepreneurial ambition(Not to mention the difference in quality of product, they ALL have more sugar, more carbs, and less ACTUAL nutrition, plus they taste like crap). I highly anticipate that none of the“naysayers”on this page(including the author) have done any of their own independent research OUTSIDE of the internet by going to an event or talking to promoters or customers of this company. I suggest you do that before you make any more foolish, ignorant and uneducated statements about something you clearly know nothing about.

I also get bonuses, paid vacations, and a paycheque every week. Your right you didnt have to pay a penny to get your job, however you DO have to pay 40 hrs a week(or more) of your life, every single week, every single year until retirement age. Trading time for money is not smart, you only have so much and when it is gone you cant get it back. If it makes you feel better to consider that an“honest living”Im glad for you. Myself as well as all of those who see a better way (working from home or the beach with my family around me and enjoying the only time I get here on earth, passionately promoting a healthy lifestyle and helping others prosper through“mlm scams”) will continue on to be”brainwashed”into thinking this is, as I said, a better way. Agree to disagree. Enjoy your 40+ hr work week while I am enjoying my life ;)
 reality 
It is NOT a pyramid scheme nor is it just a protein powder. If you think all that is creepy, that’s your opinion, but there are real people out there who have retired at under age 30 because they believed in the power of this business and the health benefits of the shakes. I am on the shakes right now and I am a promoter because I do, not because I want to make money. Although that is a part of it. Pyramid schemes get money from the people below them. There is a guy who was one of the first in Canada to become a ViSalus promoter and he told me last night that I can make more money than him even though he’s probably 10,000 steps above me.

All of these critics probably have never done the 90-Day Challenge and here they are making all these claims about what it is and what it isn’t. Well, take them with a grain of salt and hear it from someone who actually has experienced it.

Personally, I hate the fact our lives are governed by some unsound group of people and we have to work for 50 years, pay taxes, and then when we retire, we become a liability because we’re no longer making money for the government. There are hundreds of ways to change this by changing your mindset.

p.s. You don’t have to put ViSalus logos all over your BMW. People choose to do that because they love the business and the optimization of their health and life.
 reality 
ViSalus promoters don’t sell anything. They promote it. It is up to the people they contact (because they are concerned about their well being and health) to buy it for themselves.

Entrepreneurs are not uneducated. You have absolutely no right to insult someone, especially one who has had success in the very thing you obviously know nothing about.
 GUEST32 
Someone on FB was promoting this..being a person who dropped 100lbs the good ole natural way.. ate less exercised more..I”m very alarmed by this product. NOT to mention the fact that it’s nothing more than Slim Fast all packaged up and sold by“direct”people.  IF ANYONE has two shakes a day and one meal you will LOOSE Weight..I can go out and buy any whey protein, Pea Protein, Rice protein, etc..and get the same results.  THERE are too many products on the market that are not monitored that are“dietary”supplements/weight loss etc etc..honestly the ones people should be taking are Pharmacy grade products which are held to a completely different standard.    The problem with this“method”is that if they wanted to earn billions they would put it into stores like GNC, QVC etc, Walmart!!! THOSE are no fail markets. There is 100’s of articles about the fact that wide spread retail marketing will make more money! IF you have a product that has legitmit backing behind the product..and can compete with other products on the market.   LETS me honest I can go buy gluten free, lactose free protein mix (which I DO..b/c I have allergies to both)…for Less than $20.    with two protein shakes a day I will loose weight.. WHAT They fail to do is offer TRUE nutritional guidance and education!  NO person will sustain their weight loss once they go off the two shakes a day…it did not train you to change your eating habits, learn to read food labels, and make better food decisions…it’s a quick fix…to an obviously long term problem. ..WHEN you’re extremely overweight you got there from bad habits and lifestyle. ..THAT does not change in 90days! PERIOD.

Find a good nutritionalist, or Naturopath physician who works with more natural products…don’t resort to this SLIM FAST immitator!!! lol, you’ll just end up wasting your money and get pushed to sell a product to your friends..

kind of like when an account executive at a tv station sells airtime to a business on the claim that the majority of people in the tri-state watches their evening news?  or when an auto mechanic gives you a“deal”, when the deal is that the shop makes money on parts that are never paid for?  that kind of lying?  also I’m not defending the“pyramid”MLM business at all, but draw out the profit plan of a“legitimate”business and see how the money is distributed.  top down.  like a pyramid.  just sayin

Im not sure where this ridiculous idea came from that you have to put Visalus logos on the car.  It’s not true. Also it does NOT have to be black.  It must be at least 2000 or newer and you can take $300 cash per month instead of getting the car if you want, so that way you can use it towards a car of your choice or your mortgage or whatever you choose.  My wife and I are a 2 income family (3 if you count ViSalus) and we made a full time income this year with ViSalus.  We are certainly NOT at the top of our team.  The product is high quality and nutritional and we love what we do.  If you type in visalus prescription for google images you can see that several doctors have actually prescribed the ViSalus Shake.  It works.
If you work hard you can be successful with anything.  People who have failed did so because they did nothing not because of lack of opportunity or a quality product.

Vitamin D is available in some foods. Also Vitamin D does not come from the sun. Sunlight causes a reaction in your skin Which produces Vitamin D. I think there is enough talk here about scams etc without insinuating the milk industry does not fortify its milk with Vitamin D. It was designed to curb the severe Rickets epidemic that this country had.

Exactly don’t buy into pyramid schemes!! We’ve been trained to work job that will never allow us to make it to the top!! Never allow us to make more than our boss, and have no control over the fact the we get laid off! Imagine actually doing what you enjoy doing and controlling your destiny and not relying on the gov’t to help you out when you no longer have a job.Teach our younger generation to just get a job and settle and if you have a dream or goal don’t do it cause your not good enough to be the next Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs etc…. I guess Visalus is great at scamming people to the extent that there health is getting better, there goals have increased and there overall zest for life is there as well as continue to buy your supplements from the big makers and chains cause we can to continue to make those big buys rich…not the employees but the high executive of those companies!!! :-)

Oh your smart. You catch on quick.  They are suppose to.  Irony !

Use you common sense.  If you lose weight (any way) you will feel better.  The best way to do this is by eating healthy and exercising. Visalus is a scam because it is a poor quality shake that would never make it on the store shelves.  It depends on you and others like you to use the love and caring that your friends have for you to buy this worthless shake and then they are to do the same thing, etc.  No company that disvows you as an employee and requires you to pay them to sell for them, pay all the expenses and to pressure your family and friends is not a good thing.  They brain wash into believing you are helping your friends and you are going to get rich.  Bottom line they just want to sell as many of the people aroung you as they can and that’s it.  Read all the post here and educate yourself on this great chance.

Vitamin D is no big deal you get it from being outside in the daylight.  The rest occurs from weight loss on any method.  Eating“real”healthy food and exercise is the best way to take it off and keep it off and cheaper.  And you get to keep your friends.
 ElizzaP 
No way!!!!!!!  And Slim Fast has evolved into the 21st century they are already mixed and all you have to do is uncap them.  Slim Fast is way better and less expensive.  When you wake up from your brain washing I hope they didn’t wash away all your common sense.
 EllizzaP 
You just got back from one of their (by the way their not there) brain washing sessions.  Yes I like working for a company that gives be vacation, sick days, holidays, 401K, health insurance, life insurance, pays their portion of SS, pays unemployment taxes on me.  And a company they I do not have to pay them to work for me.  That I don’t have to pester my friends and families to pay them to work for them too.  A Company that proudly acknowledges that I work for them.  A ompany that pays the expense to market their product.  If I am a Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Lord forbid a Donald Trump I will make it in the company or while making a living in another avenue.  But most of all I don’t have to con people or lie. I feel good about what I do.
 ElizzaP 
I think Slim Fast taste a lot better than this crap and I don’t have to pack milk, add ins, mixer, etc.
 ElizzaP 
And there is a lot of things out there that I would not take and Visalus is one of them.
 EliizzyP 
About right.
 ElizzaP 
I have no idea what Scentsy or Premier Jewlery are, so I can not speak to them.  I have been to one Pampered Chief party which had hundreds of items, none was promoted as a cure all.  I was not asked to beconme a seller.  Mary Kay has hundreds of products as well.  I used it for years but was not promised great result or anything.  I was never asked to sell it. Might as well talk about Avon too. Avon has thousands of products which are all good and price comparable to other such products.  I have used them for years.  I was never told they would cure anything, I was never asked to sell.  I was approached by a family member to buy Visalus and apprached to sell it in the same breath.  It would cure a laundry list of things.  It was very over priced.  Not only was I asked to buy this wonder shake that had everything in it but also to buy vitamins, appitite suppressions and adins.  What happened to it having everything/    If you can not see the difference than your kool-aid binge has turned nasty.
 ElizzaP 
Just for anyone who is thinking of joining Visalus; I just found out that a Regional Manager I know has a $30,000 credit card debt from going to all the Visalus brain washings and having all the challange parties. Guess what they had to get one of those bad old jobs to pay for it.
 Lisa 
That is a bunch of bull.  Besides the fact that it’s ALL a tax writeoff.  I’ve been in this company for over 2 years and haven’t spent more than $2k out of my own pocket. Visalus and my upline payed for most of my travel.  Now that I am a 1 Star Ambassador, I am helping my own team travel.  Again, everything is a tax writeoff.
 LIsa 
Congrats for taking control of your health, Chris.  You could choose to eat nothing but junk but you care about your health.  Don’t let the haters get you down.

Whoever said you have to sell it?  That was my choice after 4 months on the product as a customer.  I’ve been to many of these different parties (Pampered Chef, Premier Jewlery, Mary Kay, etc) and they all ask when I’m going to have my own party and become a distributor.  And there are different options for everyone.  Just like Mary Kay or Avon.  You can just buy the $5 concealer or you can by the $20 anti-aging coverup that is better for your skin.  I personally know of woman that have been able to become pregnant, because of gluten allergies that cause infertility, and diabetics that no longer have to take daily insulin shots, because of these shakes.  Could they have done it on their own?  NO.  They all tried and they couldn’t do it.  We have a huge support system and think of each other as family.  We look out for our family and help them beat temptation.  Do you have any idea what it feels like for someone to say to you, You saved my life?

If you don’t like the product, then don’t use it.  I don’t understand why you have to bash on something that is proven to be good and work for so many others.  It makes you look like a fool.  I bet 30 years ago there was someone just like you saying the samething about Herbalife.  We are laughing all the way to the bank.

I don’t need a loan when I’m making over $15k a month.  And I didn’t quit my“regular”job until I was making that much a month.  I have $0 debt.  Even my BMW is paid off so that $600 goes in my savings account each month.  I plan to pay CASH for my home by the end of the year.  I will never have to count on a bank, a loan or credit again.  This is almost 2 years in the business and it’s only gotten better.
 Jeff 
All you have to do is turn your autoship OFF.  It’s super easy.  If you can’t figure that out, then you have no business as an entrepreneur.  I’ve been dealing with Visalus for almost 2 1/2 yrs and this has never happened to me.  It sounds like Elizzyp is making up her/his own posts.
 Katie 
I’d my doctor will tell you the exact opposite.  Everything bad that you put into your body will cause you to end up with some kind of cancer, arthritis, autoimmune disease, etc.
 Lisa 
It means $1k–$3k amonth in extra income and $600 towards a black, sliver or green BMW or $300 towards a non-BMW.

My life does not revolve around a protein shake.  My live revolves around my family and friends.  I love my job, and my coworkers.  I go to work and people appreciate what I do.  I help people.  I feel great, I am healthy and intelligent.  I am not gullible and would never stoop as low as to suggest that because I work a full time“real job”that I should be ashamed of making an“honest living”.  I take pride in being honest and trustworthy.  I would not want to spend a second trying to convince another person to buy a product they don’t need.
 integrity 
It’s pretty scary having a bunch of overweight people telling others how to become fit and healthy.  Selling a protein powder does not give you expertise in health and nutrition.

Losing weight will happen when you follow ANY“diet”plan.  Calories in VS calories out.  NOT what protein shake you drink.  Food is healthy.  People gain and lose weight by eating.  Trying to convince someone they should buy a protein powder (and/or any of all the extra money stealing products) is a scam.

Advice is free.  Losing weight should not cost you any more money.  You can save money by cutting back on the foods you know you should stop eating, and increase your exercise.
 ENRGY Money 
well written, while I don’t agree with the car programs these companies have come up with, I do agree with the industry.   People just need to watch out when joining companies because of a car program.  Check out this video

 You’re An Idiot 
If this article is any representation of the quality of the writing in your‘book’, then count me out.  My 5th grader could make a better presentation than this.  Not to mention that your‘facts’are completely wrong.

1.  Your first mistake is not knowing that the direct selling channel is more profitable to the business than selling retail such as in a GNC, per your example.  The overhead is significantly lower, and instead of having to take a reduced profit margin and spend huge money on advertising, independent distributors are paid commissions for their services. GNC doesn’t have the opportunity to sell this product because it isn’t offered to them.  And it is making millions.
2.  If you don’t sell anything, why would you make a commission?  Idiot.  And yes, there is a minimum qualification each month.  Your own product usage generally covers it.  Further, I make a percentage override on what my enrolled distributors sell as well, so as long as I an using the product (or giving it away as samples or using it for challenge parties) I will make that money.  The company direct ships to the user–we are not asked to stockpile anything, although we can and use it as I mentioned earlier.
3.  ViSalus does something no other NM company does–they put their car program within reach of the average person.  Why do you think that is?  Oh yeah, as a motivation to keep going.  Of course the deal for the car is between you and the dealer–how could they be on the hook for a new BMW every 45 minutes?  This fact is not in any way hidden.  And that is current info as of 3/12–someone qualifies every 45 minutes.  If you can not qualify credit wise for the BMW, they still give you a $300 bonus every month.  Do they have to?  Hell no.  Idiot.  It’s called research.
4.  Why do you think Warren Buffet bought a network marketing company?  Or why they are backed by people like Trump and Kiyosaki?  Or why top economists say they are the best method for the average person to make significant income?  Or why 80% of women who make over $100k/year do it in direct sales?  Idiot.
5.  You have done nothing to outline any deceit or unethical practices of ViSalus.  What you have done is painted yourself as an idiot who wants to sell some POS ebook.  It’s people like you that make the internet seem a lot less valuable than it is.  Any dufus who has basic typing skills can write an article or start a blog.  And don’t worry, I don’t expect my comments to see the light of day on this site because you are probably not man enough to not screen your replies.
 You’re an Idiot 
Not true. Try reading The 4 Hour Body by Tim Ferris.  Calories in vs out is an antiquated idea, and is proven not true in that book.  Food is healthy?  Are you serious?  We are living in the time of the most depleted nutrient supply in history and you come with that comment?  You need to do some research pal.  It’s also proven that people do better at losing weight when there is community involved, which is exactly what ViSalus does.
 You’re An Idiot 
ElizzaP: You seem to have a real beef with ViSalus.  So back up that big mouth of yours with some hard evidence.  Where is you proof that it is a‘poor quality shake’?  Show me, I’m dying to see this evidence, you know, because you are surely a scientist of some sort.  Or, maybe you are one of those people who can’t get off their super sized behinds and make something happen, so you like to tear others down.  I happen to know a lot about the contents of the product, and know many others who do as well.  The joke is on you–the crap that you buy on the shelf at Wally World is the junk, and has a huge profit margin.  So come on love, show me!?!  I won’t be surprised when you don’t have anything to come back with but some more insults and disparaging comments.

Why does anyone really care.  Don’t waste your time trying to convince anyone of anything they cannot convince themselves.  If you don’t want to join Visalus or any other mlm opportunity…cool b/c it’s not for everyone.  Just like not being an entrepreneur is for others.  There is a place for everyone and only individuals makes choices to create change.

Everything cost whether you are an employer..employee…or an ind. distr.

Don’t won’t the shake….you rather go buy some other“powder”from the store…cool that’s your choice but don’t knock someone elses dream whether it be financial…dealing with health or any particular part of their life.

Nothing wrong with a job and nothing wrong with paving your own way in sells.

if you don’t work you don’t eat….but that statement has absolutely nothing to do with clocking in.

You work hard at your job probably but guess what no matter what job you have there will always be people who don’t appreciate the opportunity that the job provides and this works in mlm as well.

In anything results very b/c individual efforts vary.

Don’t believe in Visalus….cool but who cares
Some people are not interested in what you do or believe in….but again who cares.

If you are happy doing what you do..that’s all that matters….no matter the choices you make there will always be challenges on any path you choose..

Choose wisely and remember people are always selling something…some of you are selling the opportunity that a person can go beyond the norm and some of you are selling doubt….

Whatever it is that any of you believe in…i hope you continue to be happy from it and that you prosper right where you are if that’s where you want to be.

Cheers!

Very true.  You are obviously involved in the visalus mlm, and you repeat what you have been told by other mouths.  If a person wants to“lose weight”they will, because they choose to.  YES food is healthy.  Obviously I am not talking about donuts. There are no ingredients in any protein shake that cause weight loss.  A person loses weight because they stopped eating so much and started exercising.  It is not rocket science.  It is proven that people should stay clear of visalus or any other“diet fad”out there.  I am a well informed adult, not your“pal”.  Visalus is all about getting another person to buy the product under you.  This product is nothing great, but some people are willing to sell others a product they don’t need and talk it up like it is more than what it is.  Visalus does not“do”anything”, it is the consumer chosing to drink fewer calories than they were previously eating.
 integrity 
your comment to Elizza is not worth responding to.

I am a healthy person, feel great and have lots of energy and I eat food.

All you sellers name call and assume everyone who disagrees is lazy and large, yet the majority of visalus sellers are lazy and large and have no educational background or experience to go around telling other people about how they should diet.
