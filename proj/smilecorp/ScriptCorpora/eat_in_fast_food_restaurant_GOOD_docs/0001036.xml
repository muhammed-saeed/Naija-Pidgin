The person pretty much surrendered and he continued beating them. He needs to spend some time in the slammer. Too bad for McDonald&apos;s though, they don&apos;t need this kind of negative publicity. oh here we go... **** that... they could of had a gun... they&apos;re stupid enough to jump over a counter and act hard, then they got what they deserved... one less scumbag i have to worry about populating the earth... lol... who am i kidding?... those dumb dikes don&apos;t have teh cock to make babies... **** em... reppin back 75% of the time.... all the time...

to people asking what the beating stick is:

its a deep fryer rod that you use to knock scum off and clean out the bottom of the deep fryer. its basically like a piece of rebar bent into an L shape with a handle-bend on the other end.

that **** would ruin your day they are pretty heavy. it would be no different then getting smashed in the head with a golf club when the shaft of it hits you instead of the clubhead.

or if someone swung a 2-3 foot piece of rebar onto your head.

 Lets go black man! Join Date: Aug 2009 Location: United States Age: 27 Stats: 5&apos;9&quot;, 185 lbs Posts: 6,771 Rep Power: 3561 NEW YORK (CBSNewYork)—A fight over an order at a Manhattan McDonald’s leads to complete chaos and it was all caught on tape.

The video contains images and audio of a graphic nature.

Sources tell CBS 2’s Chris Wragge the stunning incident featured a cashier with a criminal past violently beating two female customers after they appear to provoke him by slapping him and then hopping the counter.

It was a horrific scene to watch. The cashier disappears into the back of the fast-food restaurant on West Fourth Street in Greenwich Village before returning with a metal rod he then used viciously on the two customers.

The gruesome act of violence early Thursday morning escalated after the customers argued and yelled obscenities at the cashier when he questioned a $50 bill they gave him.

One of the female customers then slapped the cashier. A woman is then seen jumping over the counter, while the other woman goes behind the register. They are then savagely attacked.

Other customers watched in horror as other McDonald’s workers tried unsuccessfully to stop the violence.

One female customer had a fractured skull that required surgery and a broken arm. The other has a deep laceration.

 Rayon McIntosh, 31, was arrested and charged with two counts of felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon. McIntosh served more than a decade in prison after shooting and killing a high school classmate in 2000. He was being held on $40,000 bail. 

The female customers were reportedly charged with menacing, disorderly conduct and trespassing. Dude was in prison for 10+ years, locked up since 19 for shooting a classmate&amp;a 8yr old:

bishes got what they deserved though, they fukked with the wrong one. Jump the counter looking for a fight...this is a possible outcome Can&apos;t help me to 4K reps if you&apos;re dead...jus sayin&apos;

I wouldn&apos;t expect him to if he had stopped after the first couple of swings. But he paused and then hit them again when they were already on the floor, so I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he did get charged. Honestly though, those bitches provoked the wrong mother****er. Goes to show, no matter how tough you think you are, there&apos;s always someone tougher. Hopefully they learned their lesson. 10-14-2011, 09:16 PM #51 lolrence

I used to work at McD&apos;s (humble beginnings, don&apos;t hate) and I don&apos;t remember having that much crap to beat people with. Maybe just the fry baskets and the cleaner stick that the guy in video used, but that&apos;s it. 10-14-2011, 09:40 PM #60 Iterated
