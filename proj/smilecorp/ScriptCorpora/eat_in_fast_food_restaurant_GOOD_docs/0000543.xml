 *IMPORTANT NOTE IF PURCHASING THE $5.99 ROOT LIFT WITH $5/1 MANUF. COUPONS* 
 If you still have the Gift Card glitch in your store (some dont, some still have it), your final total when using MANUFACTURERS coupons cannot drop below $10 or 2 of your coupons will fail. This means that you will have to have at least an extra $7.03 in your order (that you wont be using MQs on) to absorb your coupon value. If you dont, your first $5/1 coupon will scan fine, your second will scan for $2.97 and your third will scan at $0.00. Be sure and use your $3/2 Target coupon LAST as it has no affect on this glitch and will allow your total to drop below the $10
