 &quot;Fast
Food Nation&quot;by Eric Schlosser investigates Americas fast-food
fascination from all points of the spectrum. 

 Schlosser,
an Atlantic Monthly correspondent, examines the social and economic
impact of fast-food chains and, through his research and personal
investigations, brings a new perspective to this modern-day phenomenon. 

 Food
chains like McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Burger King have changed
their operations in many ways and implemented innovative practices. Early on,
rapid production techniques were tested in many of the kitchens of these
restaurants. 

 The
use of ample grills and disposable dishes, the selection of foods that dont
have to be eaten with utensils and the elimination of short order cooks have
since revolutionized the fast-food industry. Speedy service and good, quality
food at a low, affordable price became the signature trademark of these
restaurants. 

 Marketing
and promotion methods adjusted to the new target market. Promoters created a
brand name and symbol that people could trust and recognize throughout their
lives. Characters were created to appeal to families especially children. 

 &quot;The
talking dog from Taco Bell commercials and the big yellow M of McDonalds
stands out in my mind,&quot;says Jane Prjlic, a 28-year-old resident of Auburn
Hills.

 The
convenience of fast food has proved to be helpful and destructive, however. Fast
food places like White Castle, Taco Bell and Wendys have changed the way
Americans dine. Ad campaigns encourage families to eat at these restaurants and,
as a result, eating habits are being shaped by places like these. 

 Nowadays,
the average person may make trips to a fast food restaurant several times a
week, if not a few times a day. 

 Brenda
Williams, a 48-year-old resident of Garden City, says that fast food places have
always been a part of her life and her familys life. She recounts memories of
her daughter, now 23, always asking for her favorite food chicken nuggets at
McDonalds as a child. 

 &quot;I
probably go to McDonalds or Taco Bell at least five times a week,&quot;says
Prjlic.&quot;I usually go on my lunch break or right after work on my way
home.&quot; 

 Prjlic
mentioned that since she commutes from Auburn Hills to Novi every day for work,
it is often easier for her to pick something up. 

 This,
of course, brings up the topic of mobile eating. 

 Americans
can be seen eating in their vehicles much more since the invention of drive-thru
dining. Making food easier to travel has become a necessity in todays
society. 

 Economic
results of fast-food restaurants can also be seen all over the country. A
restaurant can begin with one modest building and a dream. In time, it
flourishes into a worldwide success with a franchise business that booms. Fast
food buildings spring up all over the country. 

 John
Farner, a student at Schoolcraft Community College, says:&quot;I cant go two
blocks without running into fast food. We live in a world where processed animal
parts make up most of our diets. We eat not because we like it but because its
so easy to get.&quot; 

 Americas
economy has managed to benefit from these restaurants. Although employee
turnover is fairly high at fast-food restaurants, they continue to employ a
large percent of the nations population. Its not uncommon for people to
begin their job paths with these types of restaurants. 

 Fast-food
places employ unskilled, cheap labor who will work for minimum wage and no
benefits. That is why many of their employees are in their teens. In fact,
Williams says that she had briefly worked at a Burger King as a teen-ager. 

 The
strategic locations of fast-food buildings have given rise to high amounts of
traffic in particular areas, raising profits. McDonalds, for instance, began
setting up businesses off highways because these were locations where many
potential customers might travel. 

 Cities
have flourished from fast-food chains opening their restaurants in their
vicinity. Farner remembers traveling to Ohio on a Cedar Point trip and stopping
at a newly built McDonalds. He says the girl working the drive-thru was
amazed at how many people have come through her town since the place opened. 

 Restaurants
in these key locations bank on customers impulsively stopping by and ordering
food. It may have been the locations that led them there, but it is the quick,
friendly service and quality food that make them come back, Schlosser writes. 

 Prjlic
disagrees. 

 &quot;There
are too many fast-food joints clumped together,&quot;she says.&quot;People
think of fast food in a different way now. Its cheap but not great quality.
Were inclined to go there because we grew up with it.&quot; 

 Some
issues have kindled heated debates between food-service industries, animal
activists and other organizations. Food processing and distributing practices
have been under scrutiny for some time. 

 Prjlic
has been a vegetarian for about two years. She says she believes that the meat
products of many fast-food places are disgusting. The conditions in which many
animals are treated have turned her off to ever consuming animal products. 

 Many
animal-rights activists have similar concerns about the poor conditions of
livestock for food manufacturers. And the sensationalism of Mad Cow disease also
scared many Americans, impacting peoples notions about fast-food cooking.
Health agencies are being urged to investigate and regulate the food industrys
practices. 

 Farner,
who is also a vegetarian, thinks of fast-food chicken and meat products are bad
for the body. Stories of chicken nuggets without&quot;bird&quot;meat in them
and hamburger patties containing rat guts and cow intestines have persuaded him
to eliminate meat from his diet. 

 &quot;I
eat meatless, animal-free fast food because its fast and cheap to get,&quot;Farner says.&quot;But eating any of their burgers or chicken nuggets is like
putting pure, toxic poison into my body.&quot; 

 Another
issue of concern is obesity in America. Obesity is being linked to fast-food
chains because of their unhealthy menus and easy availability. There have been
lawsuits filed against fast-food restaurants claiming they were responsible for
a persons obesity. 

 &quot;Its
not the restaurants fault,&quot;Williams says.&quot;Everyone just wants to
blame someone else for their extra weight.&quot; 

 &quot;If
people stop going to these places, theyll reduce their chances of being
fat,&quot;Farner says.&quot;No one is forcing them to go. 

 &quot;This
is just what society has evolved into.&quot;
