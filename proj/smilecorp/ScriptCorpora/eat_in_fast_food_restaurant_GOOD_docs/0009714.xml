 May 31, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Just okay and a little expensive by TMN ( 236 reviews ) Fries are NY Fries. Not my thing but people do like them. Poutine not very good. Burger was okay but not spectacular especially considering the combo was over 15 with poutine. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful April 1, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Captain Cook ( 33 reviews ) Awesome selection of condiments. Yummy burger and onion rings March 10, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by simonblaine ( 55 reviews ) Think Harvey&apos;s with better fries. The buns are not good as they are too heavy and the patty isn&apos;t big enough to fill the bun. Flovourless patty. August 19, 2010 Likes it Not Bad... by Hungrycanadian ( 386 reviews ) Cross Iron Mills the newest mall just north of Calgary in Balzac has South St. Burger Co. a Franchise associated with the New York Fries restaurants. Their spin on the hamburger that has no hormone, antibiotics, or preservatives all natural beef like their fries. I wasn&apos;t hungry enough to try the burger itself but did have the fries that you guessed it is just like the food court NY Fries wow eh who would have thought. The cost for fries is pretty steep 1 medium fries, 1 double poutine and 2 small drinks came to $16.42 ouch, should have got the burger to make it worth while right. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful +1 more review from Hungrycanadian March 13, 2011 Great Vegi Burger I&apos;m not a vegitarian so I don&apos;t ever think of buying a vegi burger however i tried the one at South St. Burger today. You would never know there&apos;s no meat! The flavor tastes amazing if you ordered this burger you&apos;ll never miss the meat. I will be ordering this option next time I&apos;m in the mall for sure. January 29, 2012 Likes it Just better than 5 guys by koolossal ( 18 reviews ) Good burger and toppings. Like the new york fries combo December 22, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Best Burger in Calgary nope by BurgerFreak ( 1 review ) Good burger but certainly not worthy of best burger in Calgary (can you say ballot stuffing). No where near 5 Guys for quality and price. The fries well they are NY Fries and I think 5 Guys fries are just as good. I prefer Loungeburger in Calgary if I want a gourmet burger and it has a much better atmosphere. When I am in a mall I am not looking to pay those kind of prices for a burger. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful November 1, 2010 Decent - feeds two for $20 by Peaches ( 158 reviews ) My hubby had wanted to try this place for the longest time... and I finally caved in yesterday. Very busy place - especially since it&apos;s situated right inside a mall. Prices were ok... I guess you can&apos;t compare pricing to McD&apos;s, A&amp;W etc but nearly $9 for a combo is still not cheap. So between the two of us, we got two regular burgers (hubby added bacon for $1), one small fries, one small onion rings and a large drink to share. Total came to $19.61. Taste wise - they have a variety of toppings and dressings to choose from! Mango chutney, garlic mayo, spicy ketchup... and also your basic stuff. The hamburger patties were well made and very tasty. My only complaint is the bun - you have two options - regular or whole wheat, but the whole wheat was more like multi-grain and kept breaking apart for some reason. I don&apos;t think that was a good choice for a bun. Fries were nothing special - just your regular NY fries but I liked the onion rings - only about 7 pieces for an order of small. I swear onion rings are the most profitable side ever in history!!!!!! Overall it was a decent meal and I&apos;m glad we gave it a try. December 5, 2011 Likes it Best veggie burger in Alberta! by chellyw ( 10 reviews ) I was so happy to see that one of my favourite burger chains from back home (Ontario) opened out here in Alberta. Hands down, they have the best veggie burgers in Calgary and probably all of Alberta. Combine that with NY Fries and you have a lethal combination! November 15, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Grishma ( 10 reviews ) Great veggie and beef burgers and also fantastic service! January 25, 2012 Likes it Drop everything and go here, right now. by Mr.Mike ( 3 reviews ) Don&apos;t listen to the nay-sayers. They probably think Harvey&apos;s makes the best burgers in the world, which really says a lot about their taste in food. Five Guy&apos;s Burgers and Fries certainly have a good burger, but South St. blows them out of the water. This should be the new face of burgers going forward. If there was a Nobel Prize for burgers, this place would get my vote. Every little aspect of their burger is given the utmost care and attention. Carefully selected meat, fresh-baked bread, fresh-cut toppings, deliciously-planned sauces and condiments and an awesome selection of cheeses to boot, make this the best burger I have ever had. Their meat is grilled absolutely perfectly. It arrives to your bun juicy, tender and well seasoned. The patty is appropriately sized, and the thought of ordering an extra patty is unfathomable. There is no feeling of&quot;I could use a little extra/less meat&quot;. The toppings are fresh, there are no&quot;powdery&quot;tomatoes or... more» Don&apos;t listen to the nay-sayers.

There is no feeling of&quot;I could use a little extra/less meat&quot;. The toppings are fresh, there are no&quot;powdery&quot;tomatoes or wilted lettuce. The onions aren&apos;t overpowering in any sense. The cajun onions are orgasmic. The sauces are unique and tasty. Wasabi, garlic, and even curry mayo are all great, a variety of relishes, barbecue sauces, mustards and ketchups are all great in any combination. There is no over-saucing here, just the right amount. Words can not begin to describe how much better these burgers are than Five Guy&apos;s. The ingredients of your sandwich will not just blend together into a one-flavor mush. Each ingredient is distinct and will contribute an interesting flavor profile to your meal. There is no going wrong at South St. Burger Company. Don&apos;t forget the fries, poutine, onion rings or milkshake.All of them are fantastic. February 20, 2011 Likes it Best Burger in Calgary? by Adam Chiasson foodmusiclife.com ( 7 reviews ) As a regular listener of the Fan 960 sports radio station here in Callgary, and a guy who genuinely likes to shop, having a place voted the&quot;Best Burger in Calgary&quot;inside a brand new outlet mall seemed like an easy choice. I have been to Cross Iron Mills before and everytime I walked past South St. Burger Company I said&quot;I&apos;ll go next time.&quot;Since the last time I had been here, the listeners of the Fan 960 voted it the best burger in the city which cemented the&quot;I&apos;ll go next time,&quot;line, in stone. This place has been open for just about a year so maybe people like a new kid in town when it comes to burgers. I was there at 5:00pm on a Saturday. The mall was packed and so was South Street. I kept it simple and ordered the hamburger combo and paid extra for cheese. South St serves New York Fries as their side. Kind of a nice touch. The beef is not frozen and is cooked to order.

This place has been open for just about a year so maybe people like a new kid in town when it comes to burgers. I was there at 5:00pm on a Saturday. The mall was packed and so was South Street. I kept it simple and ordered the hamburger combo and paid extra for cheese. South St serves New York Fries as their side. Kind of a nice touch. The beef is not frozen and is cooked to order. This seems to be getting trendy as Wendy&apos;s advertises this. It kind of works caferteria style. You order and pay, then slide your tray down the line where you have a choice between a white and a whole wheat bun. Then they dress the bun while the burger cooks with your choice of their toppings. Given how busy it was, it didn&apos;t take too long for the burger to be ready. I went with a whole wheat bun, blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, ketchup, mustard and relish. The burger was really good. The bun was awesome. It was definitely the best part of the burger. Probablly the best burger bun I ever had. It was very soft and tasty. All in all, in my opinion, this is definitely not the best burger I ever had in Calgary, but having said that, for a place that is kind of like a fast food joint, it buries any of their competition. I can see myself grabbing a burger here everytime I at that mall and it is definitely worth checking out, but it&apos;s not the best burger in Calgary. Burger (with cheese), fries and a drink came to $10.50. March 15, 2011 Likes it Good Choice for a Fast Burger by James ( 4 reviews ) This was our second visit to the South St. Burger Co. The New York Fries make a big difference to your typical burger, fries, and a drink combo. They add a lot to the meal. There were three of us and we all had cheeseburger combos. Because you can choose from an assortment of toppings everybody&apos;s burger is going to be different. I like a burger where I can still taste the meat and where it isn&apos;t overpowered by the toppings. I choose cheddar cheese, Dijon mustard, a pickle, onions, and lettuce and was pleased that I could still taste the burger and bun with that combination of toppings. The service was fast even though they were busy and the food was hot and tasty. South St. Burger Co. in Cross Iron Mills is a good choice for a fast and tasty meal. October 29, 2011 They are okay by rabbitjunior ( 2 reviews ) I still think that 5 guys burger is better. South St. Burger is ok overall, I had it there a few times, it taste good with many topping options. You can choose any toppings you&apos;d like to have. However, cheese and bacon are $1 extra for each. A burger with drink and fries can be over $10. Much more than a typical fast food burger, but the quality is much better too. December 28, 2010 Likes it Good... Try it! by Jordan ( 7 reviews ) The burgers are good and the toppings choices are plenty. The bacon here (unlike some other burger places) is also very fresh&amp;tasty. April 16, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Jeff Johnston ( 3 reviews ) Not a bad burger, good choice of toppings, little pricy but what isn&apos;t these days?
