Troy Davis and the appeal puzzle
 Troy Anthony Davis, at the center of a well-known Supreme
 Court case over a claim of innocence and the death penalty,
 may have another opportunity to appeal to press his claim 
 but where would he appeal? The issue is far from clear, but
 may soon have to be resolved.
  The Supreme Court has taken a special interest in the case
 of a Georgia death-row inmate, Troy Anthony Davis, using an
 unusual source of power to give him a new chance to press
 his claim that he is innocent, and that someone else killed
 a Savannah policeman 21 years ago. But, in the process, the
 Court appears to have created a puzzle: now that a federal
 judge has ruled against Daviss plea of innocence, where
 does he appeal next? There appears to be no clear answer.
On Tuesday, the U.S. District Court in Georgia sent a letter
 to the Supreme Court, delivering a copy of an order District
 Judge William T. Moore, Jr., had issued on Oct. 8, finding
 that Davis may only appeal to the Supreme Court not to the
 Eleventh Circuit Court to pursue his case further. The
 Tuesday letter is under seal, but Judge Moores six-page
 order can be read here . In August, Judge Moore, reviewing the case on
 orders directly from the Supreme Court, had ruled that Davis
 is not innocent. (That ruling is discussed in this post .)

Davis was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1989
 shooting death of Savannah Officer Mark Allen MacPhail,
 while the policeman was working a part-time security job
 outside a fast-food restaurant in the Georgia city. In
 recent years, seven of the prosecutions key witnesses at
 Daviss trial had recanted what they said at the trial, and
 several individuals have suggested that the prosecutions
 chief witness actually did the killing.

But, by April of last year, Davis had run out of legal
 options in the lower courts, when the Eleventh Circuit
 refused to let him file a new habeas challenge in those
 courts. So, Daviss lawyers turned to the Supreme Court,
 asking the Justices to issue what is formally called an
 original writ of habeas corpus that is, one that the
 Court itself would issue with no involvement by a lower
 court.  The Court had not done so in nearly 50 years, so it
 was a long shot.

However, on August 17 of last year, over the dissent of
 two Justices (and with one Justice not participating), the
 Court transferred Daviss petition to Judge Moores District
 Court for hearing and determination. The Courts order
 said that the judge was to receive testimony and make
 findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have
 been obtained at the time of trial clearly establishes
 Daviss innocence.  Judge Moore carried out that order,
 holding a hearing in June, with new witnesses offered by
 Daviss lawyers, and soliciting new briefs on how one might
 prove innocence. At the end of the process, the judge on
 August 24 issued a 172-page decision concluding that Davis
 is not innocent.

In the course of his ruling, the judge expressed some
 puzzlement about what kind of authority he was exercising. He suggested, in a footnote, that since the case had come to
 him directly from the Supreme Court, he was functioning as
 a magistrate for the Supreme Court, which suggests appeal of
 this order would be directly to the Supreme Court. He
 added, however, that he has been unable to locate any legal
 precedent or legislative history on point. Even so, he
 said, he was sending a copy of his decision to the Justices.

Daviss lawyers soon filed two formal notices of appeal 
 one to the Eleventh Circuit (found here ) and one to the Supreme Court (found here ). The lawyers indicated that they had done so
 because they doubted that Supreme Court rules or precedent
 would allow a new appeal to the Justices. Separately, his
 attorneys asked Judge Moore to issue a certificate of
 appealability a necessary document if the appeal were to
 go to the Eleventh Circuit. (That document is here .)

In denying that application on Oct. 8, Judge Moore
 concluded that it would violate federal habeas law for the
 case to go to the Eleventh Circuit, since that court had
 previously refused to allow Davis to pursue a new habeas
 claim. In fact, the judge said, if the Supreme Court were
 acting in its appellate capacity when it ordered a new
 review of Daviss case, it would not have had the authority
 to do so because that route was not open to Davis. Since
 the Supreme Court was using its original jurisdiction
 authority, the judge said, the Justices had taken the only
 option that Davis and his counsel had left to them.

Accepting Daviss argument that an appeal to the Eleventh
 Circuit is now open to him, the judge said, would require
 this Court to believe that the Supreme Court can implicitly
 act in a manner expressly forbidden by Congress. The Court
 is unprepared to make such a ruling. Thus, the judge
 decided, no appeal remained open to the Eleventh Circuit,
 and no certificate would be issued to permit such an
 appeal.  Any new review of Daviss original habeas case,
 the judge said, must be conducted by the Supreme Court.

At this point, it is unclear just what procedural route
 Daviss lawyers would take to get the case back to the
 Supreme Court. The options appear to be simply to notify
 the Court that the judges ruling on the habeas petition is
 now back before the Justices for review on the merits, or to
 file a certiorari petition asking permission to appeal to
 the Court, or to file a jurisdictional statement
 suggesting that the case formally is being appealed.

The Courts rules do not appear to settle that procedural
 question. It would be up to the Court, then, to make up its
 own mind on how or even whether to go forward.

 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Grants Oral Argument for TROY
 DAVIS
December 9th in Atlanta, Georgia at 1pm 

 Click-2-Listen 

 10 Dec 2008
 
 Troy Davis and the rhetoric of insanity 



The Troy Davis case indicates just how subjective the legal
 system really is. The federal 11thCourt of Appeals deals with
 cases in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. A panel of three judges
 selected from this court considered the Davis case yesterday.
 Rosemary Burkett, a Clinton appointee with both Arab and
 Hispanic ethnic roots, would like to see a full airing of the
 facts surrounding the Davis case. According to the Atlanta
 Journal-Constitution, Burkett finds it troubling that 7 of the 9
 original witnesses have changed their stories and that one of
 the 2 witnesses sticking to his story has allegedly admitted to
 killing Savannah officer Mark Allen MacPhail.

Davis became the prime suspect in the case when Sylvester Coles
 told the Savannah police department that Troy was the killer.
 According to media accounts, Judge Burkett is wondering why
 Coles was never considered as a suspect. It&apos;s bad enough that we
 may be on the verge of killing an innocent man, she told the
 court during yesterday&apos;s hearing, but&quot;it&apos;s also possible the
 real guilty person who shot Officer MacPhail is not being
 prosecuted.&quot;

Why, Barkett asked yesterday, were none of the witnesses in the
 case shown a photo array including a picture of Coles?&quot;It seems
 police were so anxious to get somebody that they didn&apos;t pursue
 Coles,&quot;Barkett observed.

Judge Stanley Marcus, also a Clinton appointee, was less
 outspoken than Judge Barkett, but the testimony he was hearing
 bothered him as well. Since the 1991 trial, 3 witnesses had
 signed statements saying that Sylvester Coles admitted to the
 crime over a beer or between tokes.

True, a single witness, Stephen Sanders, is sticking by his
 story. At the 1991 trial, Sanders said,&quot;You don&apos;t forget
 someone who stands over and shoots someone.&quot;

However, as defense attorney Tom Dunn reminded the court
 yesterday, Sanders originally told police he wouldn&apos;t be able to
 identify the shooter. Memory usually gets fuzzier over time.

According to the Atlanta Progressive News, the hearing revolved
 around two questions:&quot;First, given the evidence available
 Tuesday, is it likely a jury would not convict Davis? Second,
 did Davis exercise due diligence in providing new evidence?&quot;

Susan Boleyn, Senior Assistant Attorney General in the State of
 Georgia, argued the status quo position. Troy Davis has
 presented no hard evidence of actual innocence, she told the
 judges. Davis&apos;s claims have been denied relief by the state
 courts, the 11th Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court and the state
 Board of Pardons and Paroles, she reminded the court. At some
 point you no longer get another bite of the same apple.

But when do you toss the apple core into the trash, and who
 decides?

Asked why 3 witnesses are primed and willing to testify that
 Coles privately confessed to murdering officer MacPhail, Boleyn
 rattled off a few theories. Coles might have been drunk or high
 on marijuana; or perhaps Coles was trying to impress his
 listeners with a bold lie.

Boleyn reminded the judges that the reliability of recanting
 witnesses has traditionally been held in low repute. The fact
 that a witness admits that they once lied under oath (for
 whatever the reason) should be enough to undermine their
 credibility.

Taken together, Boleyn&apos;s arguments boil down to this: yall can&apos;t
 prove your man is clean, so we get to kill him.

Boleyn was also critical of defense counsel for not bringing
 their concerns forward in a more timely manner. This raises an
 interesting question: what happens when defense attorneys don&apos;t
 file their briefs on time? Should the defendant suffer for the
 mistakes of the people charged with his defense?

Well, yes, if precedent is anything to go by, he should.

The smooth running of the judicial machinery trumps all other
 concerns. The law requires finality. You cant have witnesses
 changing their minds willy nilly, especially in a capital case.
 Therefore, it is generally agreed that witness testimony should
 be taken at face value and that once a witness speaks the words
 are set in stone. Recantations undermine the finality prized by
 the legal system.

Unless, that is, a case achieves the kind of attention the Troy
 Davis case is currently receiving. When both sides are free to
 make their arguments and the media is paying attention (sort
 of), the immovable object (&quot;we can&apos;t execute a man who might be
 innocent&quot;) runs up against the
irresistible force of legal precedent (&quot;a jury found him guilty
 and a string of courts have backed up their verdict, so hes a
 dead man&quot;).

Generally, a tie goes to the state. Not this time.

Does Susan Boleyn and her buddies at the Georgia Attorney
 General&apos;s Office know for sure that Sylvester Coles is innocent,
 Troy Davis is guilty, and the 7 recanting witnesses are all
 lying through their teeth? Of course not. How could they
 possibly know these things? They don&apos;t care because
they don&apos;t have to. Accused murderers are run through a complex
 game of musical chairs and when the music stops and they haven&apos;t
 found a seat, they die. We don&apos;t have to know for sure that
 you&apos;re guilty, nor do we have to care. Justice is defined as
 whatever the legal system decides to do. If a case proceeds
 through the proper channels justice has been served.

If Susan Boleyn worried too much about these things she wouldn&apos;t
 be able to sleep at night. Cut the poor woman some slack; she&apos;s
 just doing her job. The Senior Assistant&apos;s role in the Troy
 Davis melodrama is to argue for the state of Georgia no matter
 how nonsensical her arguments may sound to the uninitiated. Hers
 is not to reason why, nor can she allow her private judgment to
 intrude into the matter. The decision was made by her
 bureaucratic superiors and she is paid to spout their arguments
 in public even when it makes her look like an escapee from a
 Monty Python sketch.

Generally it doesn&apos;t matter because no one from the outside
 world is paying attention.

If folks had given up on Troy Davis he would be long dead. But
 because a shining sliver of humanity is paying attention and a
 handful of reporters are still pressing pen to paper Troy Davis
 clings to life.

It&apos;s got nothing to do with fairness or even common sense; it&apos;s
 all about finality and bureaucratic efficiency.

 Georgia Supreme Court   

 On November

 13, 2007 the Georgia Supreme Court heard Oral Arguments requesting a

 new trial for Troy. 

 The

 Supreme Court will not decide his guilty or innocence, but will

 only decide whether there is sufficient new evidence to merit a

 new trial. This same court has denied his appeal once

 before. This was partially on technical grounds and as a result

 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.

 This act was to deal with terrorists but also has an impact on Death Row

 appeals. 

 Another thing that may affect the out come of this case is a

 recent Assessment by the American Bar Association of the Death Penalty in Georgia. 

 Supreme Court Grants

 Davis Application 

 Atlanta, August 3, 2007 --

 The Georgia Supreme Court today granted Troy Anthony Daviss

 application for discretionary appeal from the denial of his

 extraordinary motion for a new trial. The order was granted

 4-to-3 with Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears, Presiding Justice

 Carol Hunstein, Justice Robert Benham and Justice Hugh Thompson

 for the majority. Dissenting were Justice George Carley, Justice P. Harris Hines and Justice

 Harold Melton.

 This is the

 video of the Georgia Supreme Court Hearing , the prosecutor is saying

 ignore the recantations they should not count and that the lawyers took

 to long to present them. Which is a lie the courts just kept denying us

 because we did not have the coverage we have now and they are still

 contemplating denial based on procedural law and not actual innocence so

 we have lots of work to do until this decision.

 NUL: GEORGIA DEATH ROW

 INMATE CASE UNDERSCORES NEED TO REMAIN VIGILANT WHEN IT

 COMES TO U.S. JUSTICE SYSTEM: 12/10/2007 (MaximsNews Network) 

 UNITED

 NATIONS - / MaximsNews Network / - 12 October 2007 -- Back in July, not too long after

 Mychal Bell, a member of the Jena 6, was tried wrongly as an

 adult for aggravated battery in the alleged attack of a white

 classmate, there was another case of southern justice gone awry

 percolating under the radar in Savannah, Ga.

It was that of 39-year-old Troy Anthony Davis, a death row

 prisoner for the past 15 years, who was convicted of murdering a

 white police officer -- his case built entirely upon what was

 most likely coerced eyewitness testimony with no physical or DNA

 evidence or a murder weapon.

He was just 24 hours away from a lethal injection when the

 state&apos;s Board of Pardons and Paroles granted him a temporary

 stay in light of seven of nine non-police witnesses recanting

 their original testimony.

Next month, the state&apos;s Supreme Court will decide whether to

 grant Davis a new trial in light of these new developments.  

 Martina Davis-Correia, his sister,

 and representatives of Amnesty International, recently met with

 me at the National Urban League&apos;s headquarters in New York City. 

 Her brother&apos;s story made me

 realize just how imperfect our nation&apos;s
justice system - at least in the South - is.

Many of the original witnesses were very young and had criminal
histories, Davis-Correia told me. They felt intimidated by local

 law
enforcement authorities and worried about their own fate.  

 One witness, a police snitch, now

 says law enforcement authorities paid him to lie on several

 occasions.

Shortly after Davis landed on death row, the Georgia Resource

 Center - which defended death row inmates - took a huge hit in

 funding at a crucial time for his case. He had no attorney and

 couldn&apos;t depend on the state to help him out.  

 As witnesses began to recant,

 there was no one to take their new testimony down.  

 After all the new information

 emerged, the courts told Davis there was nothing he could do.  

 Evidence of police coercion had

 not been raised during the original trial so his petition to

 introduce new evidence was denied by a state court.  

 The state Supreme Court and 11th

 Circuit Federal Court of Appeals concurred with the lower

 court&apos;s decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear

 Davis&apos; case.  

 How an innocent man could still be

 executed because of a legal
technicality is beyond my comprehension.  

 It defies logic and any conceptof

 fairness and justice.

The outpouring of support for her brother&apos;s cause has given
Davis-Correia and Amnesty International, which is lending legal

 support, hope that justice will finally be done.  

 But Davis&apos; case is yet another

 reminder of why Americans of all colors must remain vigilant in

 ensuring the integrity of our justice system.  

 We can&apos;t take anything for granted

 obviously.

&quot;Troy&apos;s case has really exposed the death penalty in the South:

 the racism, the recantation, the coercion; the witnesses, how

 they were treated, no physical evidence, no DNA, no gun,&quot;his

 sister recently told Democracy Now.  

 &quot;In November, I&apos;m prayerful that

 with all the attention
and things going on and the truth, that the courts will come in

 and do what&apos;s right and give Troy a new trial.  

 That&apos;s all he&apos;s ever asked for,

 for the witnesses to be able to tell the truth without duress.&quot;

On his part, Davis seems to be using his ordeal as a wake-up

 call to help other African-Americans protect themselves from

 similar plights.

&quot;My situation is a situation that should have never happened.

 But
together, if we pull together as a people, I&apos;ll be coming home.  

 And when I come home, we can bring

 more brothers and sisters out, bring them home, gather them

 together, and as one people, we can make a change in this wicked

 world,&quot;Davis told Naji Mujahid, a reporter with Free Speech

 Radio News and D.C. Radio Co-op in a July interview.

Let&apos;s just hope the Georgia Supreme Court next month will make

 the right decision and pave the way to sending him home soon.
