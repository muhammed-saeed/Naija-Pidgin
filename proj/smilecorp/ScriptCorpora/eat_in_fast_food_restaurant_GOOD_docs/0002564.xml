 None of them are healthy unless you order a salad. The only fast food restaurant that is healthy is Subway and they are not really fast food as a sandwich bar.

 There is a book called&quot;Eat This, Not That&quot;for restaurants. It tells you what the best choices are at fast food places. You can find it at Wal-mart or any book store.

 Subway baby!! :D
Chipotle isnt too bad either, depending on what ya get.
Blimpies
Jason&apos;s Deli. yum!
Even Arbys has some good choices. You can get :
Baked Potato, Plain, Grilled Chicken Caeser,Light Grilled Chicken, Light Roast Chicken Deluxe, Light Roast Turkey Deluxe, Roast Chicken Salad,Grilled Chicken Salad

It really just depends on what you get at what place.
Now most places have the calories of everything somwhere there.

 Actually, Chick Fil A and Wendy&apos;s are not healthy, maybe better than McDonald&apos;s but those are definitely not foods you want to be eating anyways. Subways isn&apos;t really that great either unless you got a small wheat sandwhich with little or no meat and lots of good veggies without all of those dressings and mustard and stuff like that. I&apos;m sorry, but there aren&apos;t really any options...I&apos;m sure you know this, but it&apos;s called fast food for a reason. You can usually make a small, healthy meal faster than the time it takes you to drive to a fast food restaurant and eat their unhealthy, disgusting, processed food.

 Well even salad at fast food places r not very healthy because of the dessing. Subway is ok but still not very healthy.If u need a quick,healthy dinner or lunch pack one from home. Pack: water(in a reuseable water bottle),crackers,string cheese,a banana and maybe dried fruit.Rmember use a reuseable lunch box!!!!!!

 Not sure where you live but besides the obvious places, Souper Salad is ok. The whole menu is supposed to be healthy though I have to be in the mood to eat there. Cosi and Panera Bread have a few healthy choices.

Stick to places that offer nutritional guide for their items. Cosi, Panera Bread, Subway, and McDonald&apos;s to name a few all have online nutritional info to their menu items on their websites. If you stick to one or two places you&apos;ll probably get bored.
