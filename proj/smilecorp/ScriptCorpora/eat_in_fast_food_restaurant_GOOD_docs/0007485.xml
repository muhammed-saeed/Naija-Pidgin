 George Moberley to R.W DBW/P/K/6/1 Winchester College 24 Oct. 1853

He will be in his generation what Hyde and Falkland were in theirs - what young Pitt, and Burke were in theirs; in the men who framed a new Conservatism, when in the march of things the older pattern became impracticable and really unsound.

State of roads dreadful - mud to horses knees even on beaten track. Due to exertions of our commissary supplies have not yet fallen short, as has been the case in most of the other Divisions.

It is certain the army will have to spend another winter in the Crimea and R.W. has no hope of leave of absence.

Has changed his grooms. Bazaar at Kadikoi so well supplied that he needs nothing from England. Tea is scarce but his friends the Moberleys [family of George Moberley later Bishop of Salisbury] have sent him a liberal supply of &apos;souchong&apos;. Weather very good. His general has gone home through ill health - R.W. now has a &quot;sixth master - Sir de Lacy [Evans] Genls. Pennefather, Buller, Barnard, Markham and Garrett. There is a fatality about the command of the second Division.&quot;
R.W. and Percy Herbert have stayed with the Division all through. &quot;real command rests more with the staff than with the General who is obliged to see through their eyes and hear with their ears.&quot; Hard at work with 6,000 men under civil engineers preparing for winter. R.W. has put another layer of planking on his hut, substituted windows for ports and doors on hinges for slides. Before he could hardly keep a candle alight.

Gloom cast over the camp by death of Captain Wallace who was thrown from his horse. His father Colonel Wallace came on board the Oronoco to see him. Has chosen a grave among some burial mounds marking an ancient Christian site. Disagreeable rumours of fall of Silistria. Will be glad to move to Devna because of the heat and dust at Varna. &quot;If you have read any of the asurd complaints of starvation which have appeared in the papers you will be amused to hear that even the privates sometimes indulge in a roastgoose for supper, the market price being about ten pence!&quot; Strange sight to see English and French soldiers mixing in a friendly manner. Has spoken with the Zouaves and impressed by their manners. June 5th - still at Varna. Is to remain with a portion of the regiment on garrison duty. &apos;The start of the Light Division this morning was really quite laughable to witness&quot;. Loaded many of the regiments horse with his own hands.

 Contents : Anxiety for his safety groundless as he was on board Retribution during battle of the Alma. Sick Officers: mentions Dunn, Watson, Hare, Hibbert. Lord Raglan has been most kind and his H.Q. has now moved near the front and the greater part of the seige train has been got up with incredible labour. Ground makes it impossible to use very heavy batteries so 2 enormous Lancasters and some 68 pounders got from fleet. Many deserters came over from Russia army. Russians not very enterprising and disturb us little. R.W. has tent to himself and all his men under canvas. Has acquired a mattress from City of London which arrived 2 days ago. His Arab, his English Mare and his mule arrived today from Varna looking very well. Staff life very luxurious compared to rest of army. &quot;Our old General [Pennefather] is most active and energetic, rather too much so for his years and strength&quot;. Lord Raglan looking very well and cheerful. Disposition of army before Sevastopol described. French received reinforcement. We have had 900 sick returned from Varna cured. Still the Cholera clings to us.
Addition Monday morning 6 o&apos;clock. Had written above last night as an attack was expected on our batteries but all is quiet. 
 Camp before Sevastopol; To &apos;Harry&apos; DBW/P/L/3/3 Saturday 21 Oct. 1854 
 
 Contents : &quot;Too bad&quot; of newspapers to circulate falsehoolds about fall of Sevastopol. Bombardment now in fifth day and effected very little. Russian batteries more numerous and answer shot for shot. Weather most beautiful. Agamemnon sailed within 800 yards but its bombardment achieved nothing.
&quot;My old General [Pennefather] is at times somewhat touchy and difficult to deal with. .. His Guerilla command in Spain has given him a contempt for authorities, which leads him often to disobey the clearest orders which he receives from those above him.&quot; Places R.W. the bearer of these orders in very difficult position. Has knocked up a rough table and chair which makes writing easier. One of the few books in Camp he has been able to borrow is Finley&apos;s History of Byzantine Empire. Chaplain&apos;s voice unable to be heard at service for guns. Lord Dunkellin taken by Russians while in charge of a party of guards who got back safe.

He dismounted at half past four having been in the saddle 10 hours. &apos;Steady&apos; his horse got a bullet in the neck. Russians have done nothing about their killed and wounded. Sir Thomas Troubridge was badly wounded and needed 2 amputations. The Brokes and General Richard Egerton at Eaton Banks to be informed of the news: Graham Egerton came with part of his regiment to help. A canon shot entered R.W.&apos;s tent, ripped up his mattress and dressing gown and broke his small store of wine etc. The 2nd Division was in the most exposed position of the whole army; received news that the enemy was advancing at half past six white R.W. was dressing. Immediately sent news to the Guards and the French to come to their aid. Real crisis came when R.W. was with Genl. Pennefather on the crest of the British position where the Sevastopol road crossed it. They had one French regiment and 3 companies of an English one, when the enemy advanced in great force. French regiment wavered and turned so that the English lost their &apos;firmness&apos;. Pennefather and R.W. thought the position lost but did their utmost to rally the French and English and succeeded. Russians retreated and later re-inforcements came up.

Charles Lindsay of the guards and Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar dined with R.W. yesterday together with Herbert - all are keen soldiers. Lord Raglan annoyed that more rewards in the way of promotion have not been given the army. Pennefather continues to mend but slowly. Climate not conducive to recovery.

Thanks to Sibella for her offer to make warm clothing but doubts whether he could receive it this winter as communication so bad. Duff Tollemache taken by the Russians.

 [Rode Hall]; From Randle and Sibylla Wilbraham DBW/P/L/4/3 9 Dec. 1854 
 
 Contents : Richard&apos;s parents very glad to know that he has &apos;weathered&apos; Inkerman and have heard from Miss Somerset at Eaton Banks that Lord Raglan continues in good health and excellent spirits. &quot;He is a very fine fellow and long may he live to enjoy the Honours which he has earned and is continuing to earn May he have the good Fortune of his late great Master in the Art of War&quot;. [i.e. Duke of Wellington.] Hopes R.W. will receive package of goods for the winter from Rode including a pair of boots warranted impervious to water or cold. His mother refers to the death of her brother (Lt. Gen. Richard Egerton) at Eaton Banks. &quot;I am sure Lord Raglan will mourn the loss of his old Friend&quot;. Thankful for Richard&apos;s safety &quot;We read your name with intense interest in Lord Raglan&apos;s dispatch&quot;. 
 Boulogne Sur-Mer; From C. E. Watson DBW/P/L/4/4 15 Feb. 1855

Does not see peace coming but hopes that Change of Ministry will effect some good; &apos;but I should think the change would hardly be for the better&apos;. George Moberly&apos;s son has gained scholarship to Oxford. He was on the point of being sent out with two other officers, with the rank of Major, to be placed on Lord Raglan&apos;s staff but the scheme at present in abeyance and probably the change of Ministry will put it aside altogether. &apos;We have passed safely through a great political crisis, during which I felt no little fear for the safety of our invaluable constitution. How brightly stands forth the character of Moberly&apos;s hero, Gladstone. To me he seems the only really unselfish man in the whole transaction&apos;. 
 London; From Sir George De Lacy Evans DBW/P/L/4/5 20 Mar. 1855 
 
 Contents : Thanks for letter of March 2nd and information contained therein about improved state of the army which is a great relief to the public. R.W.&apos;s own good health. &quot;I consider with Wonder those who have passed through the hardships of the Camp life&quot; during the hard winter. Glad Pennefather has resumed command of 2nd Division as he was rather anxious about Buller whom he did not know. Supply of fresh vegetables, meat and fuel to army much improved. Regrets many should obtain information about attacks due to plans being so widely known in camp beforehand or from deserter&apos;s. 
 From Scott [probably Maj. Gen. H. Y. D. Scott, Royal Engineers] DBW/P/L/4/6 1 Jul. 1855 
 
 Contents : Last night received by telegraph news of death of Lord Raglan &quot;I regret it extremely for though I never had any reason to consider him a friend yet I think he has been very shamefully abused by the public press and was in great hopes he would have lived to vindicate his character. .. You I know, will feel his loss very sensibly for he was a kind friend to those whom he took a fancy to.&quot; General Brown&apos;s health also bad &quot;whose loss under any circumstances would be great but just now irreparable&quot;.

 Contents : Richard Wilbraham&apos;s not being appointed to the head of the Adjutant General Dept. instead of Pakenham [Col. the Hon.

Pakenham&apos;s relationship to Duke of Wellington. Has written to De Lacy Evans and Pennefather urging strongly Richard Wilbraham&apos;s claims to be made full Colonel.

Little known of General Simpson in England but it seems he is to remain in command. Need for &apos;great men in every department&apos;. &apos;So many of our most promising men have been cut off or disabled.&apos; Affairs at home also in bad hands. Have heard a report that the Ministry were not gladdened by such news &quot;the changes in so critical a time are much to be deprecated&quot;. Regrets that &apos;all our highest interest&apos; are in the hands of Lord Palmerston and the Colonies under charge of Sir William Molesworth &quot;who used to be an infidel, and I never heard that he has ceased to be so&quot;. Fears that the people will draw down punishment upon themselves by having &apos;ungodly men set over them.&apos;

Wickham(?) expecting addition to the family.

Possible Russian tactics discussed and Turkish dispositions in Asia. Have seen &apos;dear old Roke&apos; whose eyesight is bad.

General&apos;s post and consoles Randle Wilbraham on his not getting the Adjutant Generalship of the army - previous staff appointments discussed &quot;what Sir R. England or Lord Lucan have done to obtain their honours puzzles everybody and there are some other cases nearly as bad&quot;. Illness of Mrs. Scott and news of other soldiers at home and in the Crimea. Supplies being sent from Liverpool for the Winter in the Great Britain and the Europa. &quot;They made a sad bungle about the huts occasioning a delay of 4 days in the departure of the Vessels - but everything taken in hand by the War Department is, I am sorry to say, terribly mismanaged.

 Eccleshall, Staffs. From George Selwyn, Bishop of Litchfield DBW/P/L/4/16 14 Dec. 1855 
 
 Contents : Glad to hear that R.W.&apos;s health is unbroken. He has heard from R.W.&apos;s sister that he would not ask for leave, even though others were coming home from Crimea.
&quot;The fall of Sevastopol is indeed a great success; it must, as you say, be attended with great results, in respect to Russian ascendency - we were very sorry, on the other hand, to find the fall of Kars after its noble defences, announced in yesterday&apos;s Times. It has been for some time past, anticipated. The Russians will make the most of it, in every way&quot;. The spirit of the nation still warlike. &quot;But peace would be an unspeakable blessing if attained with honour and safety; and I would not say that there will not be an increasing desire for it here, as I suppose there is in France; where we fear, there are several reasons why the war should not be so generally popular as it is with us. 
 Winchester. From Mary L. Moberly to R.W. A.A.G. 2nd Div. Sevastopol DBW/P/L/4/17 18 Jan. 1856 
 
 Contents : &quot;Your piece of the great Bell looks so nice on the table. Mama has had it set in a piece of Devonshire Madrefore, with a Greek Cross raised upon it, in which the Bell is fixed - The slab has an inscription all round it, telling what it is, where it was taken from, and the date.&quot; Talks of family matters and the children playing at &apos;the war&apos;.
(Enclosing 17b). 
 Winchester. From George Moberly [made Bishop of Salisbury, 1869] DBW/P/L/4/17b 18 Jan. 1856 
 
 Contents : Announcement in today&apos;s paper confirming rumours of yesterday that &quot;Russia has accepted, pure and simple, the proposals of Austria as the basis of peace&quot;.
&quot;We had felt great hope of peace ever since we heard the full Russian reply. It sounded like an excellent bid, and seemed to show that on neither side there would be adequate grounds left for such prolongation of so desperate and destructive a struggle.&quot;
&quot;The funds have risen near 5 per cent in the 2 days.&quot; Watson made Major? &quot;The present high prices, of corn, and so of most other articles will surely come down, and we shall hope for a spell of prosperity and contentment. Politically, I fear that so successful a coup will give Lord Palmerston&apos;s ministry some Ã©clat and stability, &apos;tho&apos; on the other hand, their only apparent strength did lie in their being the only statesmen anxious to press the war. 
 The Crimea; From H. W. Barnard [Lieut. Gen. Sir Henry William Barnard] DBW/P/L/4/18 20 Mar. 1856 
 
 Contents : Letter enclosing plan of the trenches and approach works comprising the &apos;Right Attack&apos; on Sevastopol.

He is not yet able to walk (following wounds in Crimea.)

 Contents : Camp before Sevastopol 29 Jun. 1855
Spirits weighed down by &quot;the death of our dear good Commander in Chief Lord Raglan.&quot; His illness assumed the form of Cholera yesterday. &quot;I fear our heavy loss and failure on the 18th [attack on the Redan] has weighed heavily on his mind and embittered the last days of his life... Every one loved Lord Raglan and all had hoped to place him in a position that would secure his own fame and turn the tables on all his detractors.&quot; His correspondence will ultimately vindicate him when it appears. &quot;As regards our attack on the 18th June Genl. Pelissier was to blame and Genl. Barnard told me that he had admitted it at last.&quot; Attack on Redan described. His own brigade not in the attack. &quot;We are very badly off now for Generals.&quot; Sir G. Brown and Pennefather have left with illness, Estcourt [Maj. Gen. J. B. B. Estcourt] dead, Codrington ill on board ship. Simpson to succeed to the command. Raglan&apos;s funeral arrangements not yet known &quot;Richard Wilbraham is quite well. I think he is the only remaining relative out here&quot;. Is hoping to get the 2nd Lieut. Colonelcy.
