Pearle Vision eye care center, glasses and ridiculous prices
 By DHubbert 
Pearle Vision eye care centers suck! They tried to rip me off big time and were rude on top of that!
 




My mother had heard that Pearl Vision eye care center had good prices on glasses so she recommended that I go to them for my next pair. But it turned out when I got there that their good deals were no where’s near good. They were far from it as they wanted me to pay them $500 for the same pair of glasses and lenses that I could get at BJ’s for $120! What kind of a deal is that?

I went to the Pearle Vision on South Blvd. here in Charlotte North Carolina. The lady that helped me was not the nicest and was actually kind of rude. When I told her that I forget the exact same pair and lenses from BJ’s Wholesale Club for a little over $100 she told me that I was lying and that it was not possible.

According to her their cost on these lenses and glasses was right at or near $500. If that were true then Pearl Vision would no longer be in business as no one would pay their prices and they would have no profits on that price. But that is clearly not the case and this lady that worked at that Pearl vision on South Boulevard was clearly trying to make a huge profit on me.

I where glasses not because of choice but because I have to. I have bad eyes and was born with them and I have to deal with that. But there should be some kind of protection out there to counter or control how much profit an eye care Center can charge or ripoff a customer for.

I told the lady again that I could go to BJ’s and get those lenses and frames for near $100. She told me that I’d be back when I found out that BJ’s actually had a higher price then theirs and that their quality was far less. So, with that I left and went to BJ’s and I got the exact same lenses and glasses for around $116.

Then I want back to tha Pearl Vision eye care center on South Blvd. to show the lady that I got them for under $120 like I said. That lady wouldn’t even come out to talk to me. I wanted to show her my receipt and my glasses that I saved over $380 on by going to BJ’s versus Pearle Vision.

At least the lady at Pearl Vision was right about one thing–that I would be back, but I wasn’t going to be back to buy my glasses and lenses from her. Instead I was back to expose her and Pearle Vision as a scam. They try to rip me off big time, but I caught them and ended up getting a great deal on a great-looking pair of glasses at BJ’s.

My recommendation? If you need a pair of glasses or need to see an optician or optometrist be sure to avoid Pearle Vision and go to your local BJ’s or Sams Club. They have discount eye care centers and offer everything you can get at stores like Pearle Vision. You will save yourself hundreds of dollars and get the same or better quality glasses than you would’ve at Pearle Vision.

What you probable didn’t understand is that although it may seem like you are getting the same pair of glasses for less, in fact they are different.

Places like Walmart, Cheeks and BJ’s are able to sell you glasses for less becuase their products are inferior. Frames often tend to break sooner, and lens are made of lower quality material. You get what you pay for.
Did you ever think why you were able to buy glasses so cheap? Your glasses may look good, but in the end it’s not how you look but how well you see.

I bought glasses at Pearl, the two for one special. The glasses ended up costing over $600.00 and after a year and one month the flexible titanium frame on one pair broke in the middle, Pearl charged me $68.00 to replace the defective frame. After about a year the replacement frame broke in the same spot as the last one. These frames are cheap Chinese crap and I will never go back there again.
