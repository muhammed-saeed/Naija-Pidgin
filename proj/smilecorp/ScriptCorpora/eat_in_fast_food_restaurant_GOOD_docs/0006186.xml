Variable experiences
 
I have been eating at Sila’s on and off for 30 years. I have had y fair share of bad food, but I have had outstanding meals also. Staff response varies mostly due to overhearing negative staff comments near the door. It would seem if the staff is unhappy, the dining experience may also be subpar.

I have not had a pizza that I would ever complain about, same for all lasagnas. I have been disappointed by other options, and have stopped ordering other choices.

My worst experience at Sila’s was asking for a cup of coffee, and being brought a chipped mug that read“Grandpa”, when I consider myself a reasonable appearing, middle aged woman. This left me feeling like an unwelcome guest. This occurred in the last year, and there have also been other dishware that I have been served on that was chipped, for which the concern of lead leaching from the dishware was a concern.

We mostly now order Pizza to be picked up to avoid the negative dining experience of eating in.

I cannot say that the quality of the experience has changed for the worse or improved at all over 30 years, but I keep returning hoping for a better experience.

 8 +40 This number is the number of useful votes marisa427 has. The more useful votes, the more you can trust the quality of reviews. 
Sounds like they could definitely step up the customer service. Thank you for sharing your experience :)

Final Straw. So dissapointed for the last time.
 
I have visited Silas over the past 5 years and all I can say is that they have gotten worse and worse with every visit. This time around is and will be my final visit to the Pizzeria. The food has slowly gotten worse compared to the first time I was introduced to Silas, now the worst part is the staff. The waitresses are rude and unprofessional. The manager simply put is a rude lady. Never will I eat here again. Never will I suggest to friends and family to eat here again. Silas you have lost a solid costumer and many others.
