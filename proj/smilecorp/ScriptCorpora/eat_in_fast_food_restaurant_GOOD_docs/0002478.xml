 Description 
 Starting a restaurant business is perhaps a good idea because most people today want to eat out or take food home.  Even though we have about 1,000,000 food service establishments as of 2012, there may still be some opportunity out there.
Most consumers want to have a fast and tasty meal, quickly.  That makes the to go food industry more attractive but some say, even despite  that, the restaurant business is not the easiest to make a lot of money.
If you can provide real good food and service coupled with great people to serve it, as well as a good a simple operation, you may have a good chance of succeeding in this business.  However, if you don’t know about serving or cooking food, a restaurant may not be for you.
But who your clients are going to be?  
Those from 15 to 25 year old eat out and usually they eat to go or fast foods.  So a fast food restaurant may be a good idea to target them.  The 25 to 45 crowd likes a more gourmet but yet fast type of service.  So a regular, not so formal restaurant may be ok If you want to cater to this group.  To serve the crowd from 45 and above, you may want to have an upscale restaurant and or a family upscale restaurant.    
Finally, keep everything clean, smelling well and elegant and you may be able to make some money operating a restaurant.
