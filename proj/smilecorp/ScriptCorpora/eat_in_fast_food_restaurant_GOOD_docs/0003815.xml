Just tried my first Fatburger and I have to say I&apos;m a fan.  Started with the 1/2 lb middle of the spectrum choice, gotta work up to the 1-1/2 pounder.  It was really good, the bacon was very smokey and they offer swiss cheese as a choice not just american.  The big plus for me is that it was made to order from a ball of beef that was fresh not frozen.They also have A1 which I love.  Gotta try the fat fries next time the skinny were just OK.

The only criticism I have is that it could have been juicier, but in this day and age nobody is cooking their burgers medium anymore.

Usually I&apos;m a fan of fatburger, but this one really altered my opinion.

I had the WORST experience at this location just the other day.  Not sure I&apos;ll be going to any other locations very often based on this latest experience.

First of all... They did not serve several of the items that were on the menu.  That really just confuses your customers in the first place, at least take it off the menu to show us what&apos;s actually available.
I asked her if i could get an order of chili fries without the cheese since my mom is lactose-intolerant.  She asked another employee if they could even &quot;do that&quot;. And the other employee wasn&apos;t even sure if that was possible.
When she repeated our order back, she messed it up multiple times and we corrected her.... Surprisingly we got the right order

Then as we paid, we used a LivingSocial coupon for $16, but they said they don&apos;t accept them anymore since they are under new management. The people behind us used the same exact coupon and were also denied.
But in my personal opinion, they should not have offered the deal on LivingSocial anyway. We felt ripped off and blown off.

While ordering, the employees were just rude and not considerate of the customer&apos;s experience at all.  They did not welcome us or even smile.  They just asked what we wanted to order. Also they just had a bad additude that showed that they obviously did not want to be there. No Hellos, Thanks Yous or Welcomes, though they would barely have changed my experience...

The quality of the food was not worth all of the trouble or the time that we had all wasted just from ordering the food.
Burger was pretty dry overall, including both the patty and the bun. It literally left my mouth dry.  The fries were definitely undercooked, leaving that raw flavor in my mouth while eating their chili fries, which barely had any chili on it.

The few minor pluses: its cheap and you have open options to add items to your burger, but there are other burger joints in pasadena or anywhere that you can find with new and better additions to your burger (i.e. Jake&apos;s, the Counter, etc.)

I usually don&apos;t write reviews but this time I&apos;m compelled to do so.. Absolutely the worst experience. The grizzled owner was extremely rude and doesn&apos;t know a thing or two about customer service. When I asked for the number to the corporate office (yup, that bad), he gave it to me (which didn&apos;t work) and egged me on to ask them if he should do what customers demand like, say, &quot;commit suicide&quot; (his words, by the way.. pretty tasteless, I know.. he could&apos;ve gone with &quot;eat sh*t&quot; and would&apos;ve been just as effective).

Anyway, 1 star since it appears as if they actually serve food that can be consumed by humans, and for the owner&apos;s spunk

I had a Living Social voucher for this location and after ordering the cashier said we are no longer suppose to accept these vouchers. After explaining that I was never told this ahead of time she did take it but not for the full value I paid. This turned me off right away. Secondly it was very hot inside and apparently no a/c. Third there was a terrible fly problem inside so basically we scarfed the hamburgers and left. The burgers were good but not worth all the trouble. We will not visit this location again.

What is there not to love about a burger place with the word &quot;FAT&quot; in the name? Nothing!!! But, just an FYI...Fatburger should really be renamed &quot;FAT and SLOW Burger.&quot; Now don&apos;t get me wrong, I love the food here and the staff is really nice. You just need to know going in that this is not FAST, fast food...it is SLOW fast food. Each burger is made to order so it takes a little longer, but it is worth it. Your fries will be hot when you get them and the shakes are made with hand-dipped ice cream. Consider this a public service announcement...it will take 15-20 minutes for you to get your food so plan accordingly.

The burgers are giant, yummy, greasy, fatty, unctuous piles of deliciousness! The chili cheese skinny fries are a delectable oxymoron. The shakes are made with real ice cream and are the perfect consistency. The ingredients are all very fresh. The staff is really awesome...so please do not yell at them because your food WILL take too long. Just sit back and enjoy the TV, interesting acoustics, and view of Lake Avenue in this former Taco Bell space. As soon as your burger arrives you will know it was worth the wait.

Food/Cost: (2/5) I got the Medium Deal ($8.69; $1 extra for Onion Rings) which is basically a burger combo with medium fries and a drink. The Fat Fries here were awesome -- truly fat, meaty (in the potato sense) and piping hot. Plus, they give an exorbitant portion of fries, probably 2 XL potatoes worth. I also had some of my brother&apos;s Onion Rings, which weren&apos;t the type I liked (I like them fat, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside), though perhaps some may like it -- they were extremely crunchy, but in a thin, dry way through and through. The portion of the Rings weren&apos;t as impressive as the fries; I counted 10 rings. And the burger? Not impressive to me -- the relatively thick patty was very chewy and sinewy. All in all, I&apos;ve had better.

Ambiance: (3/5) There was only 4 people inside at 7:00pm when I came today, a Tuesday. The place is pretty small; I&apos;d say about eight 2-person tables and 6-8 booth seats. You get those shiny, old-school red plastic covered diner chairs which are kinda cute, but otherwise the place is slightly rundown.

Location: (3/5) This Fatburger is found just a tad north of the 210Fwy, on Lake Avenue. The area is not great, but its okay. There&apos;s a private lot in the back so parking isn&apos;t really an issue.

Service: (2.5/5) Like the other reviews have mentioned, the service isn&apos;t at the typical &quot;fast&quot; food speed. I sat in the drive thru for 12 minutes while they made my order. Good thing I was the only one in the drive thru; if there were even just 2 cars before me I would have had to wait for half an hour?! Speed aside, the staff here was pretty nice.

Overall: (2.5/5) Neh. I tried Fatburger because one of my friends had really good things to say about it. It was just okay; for the same money you can get better burgers elsewhere, perhaps at the plethora of mom-n-pop burger joints around.

The food is stellar!

The waitstaff are stellar!

Just remember that the place is called FATburger not FASTburger. Your burger, fry, and shake order can take 15-20 minutes to get to your table. Mine did. I really didn&apos;t notice it much though, I was distracted by the TVs, music, other terribly impatient customers, and watching the traffic outside of the large semi-circular windows (because this place used to be a Taco Bell back when I was younger).

Again, the food and people are great. The burgers patties are big, think, and juicy and they cook them so that the edges are crispy without being over done, a technique that is hard to master. Good job Fatburger!

Great food but the customer service is horrendous! My experience was so bad that I will NEVER even think about coming to this location again. The kid working the drive thru was a complete a-hole for no reason at all. His attitude and demeanor were so bad that I literally felt like punching the kid in the face. If your craving a good burger in the dena area, I would suggest Fairoaks Burgers in Altadena or Jakes Burgers on Colorado blvd. Seriously, if you are considering coming here, just save your sanity and your mood and go somewhere else.

I&apos;m writing this based on two experiences. If I could rate using half stars I&apos;d give this location 2.5 stars.

What&apos;s good: The food was good. The place seemed clean, but then again, it&apos;s pretty damn dark in there.

What&apos;s not so good: It&apos;s hard to tell if this place is ever open. Horrible lighting inside and out. Seems like there&apos;s lots of people working and the place not that busy. Took a long time for food to be ready. Heard workers talk smack about a customer who just left, and then staff was suspiciously over friendly.... Hmmm hubby thought are they going to spit in my food? At they being sarcastic? What kind of crap talking is going to happen after we leave?

I&apos;ll pass on this Fatburger...

Really disapointed by this place. I am not from the L.A. area but I have always heard how great fatburger was.  The burger was just ok and the fries were nothing special.  It was overpriced for what it is. I have had so many other better burgers this place in no way lives up to the hype I have heard.  However, I have only ate here once so it may that it was just an off day but judging from other reviews I don&apos;t think this is the case.

5 Stars for the awesome burgers and Spectacular service!!

I got out of work late and was completely famished! I remembered there was a fatburger near by so I decided to call at 10:55 to see if they were open. The gentleman on the other side of the receiver informed me that they unfortunately close the dining room at 10pm but close the drive thru at 11pm. I informed him I was a mile away and didn&apos;t think I&apos;d get there in time, so he suggested I put in a phone order so it would be ready when I got there. Since I didn&apos;t know the menu all too well, I opted not to but thanked him for the offer. We got off the phone and not even a minute later, the nice guy called me back and said since I was only a mile away they would wait for me to arrive!!!

OMG! Who does that!?!! I was thrilled!
Unfortunately, I got every red light on the way, but he was so patient and amiable!
I was seriously impressed! This is by far the best service I have ever encountered at any fast food joint!

I will definitely be returning, although it won&apos;t be so late next time!!!

Thanks again to the guy that helped me out! I didn&apos;t catch your name, but I remember your star tattoo above your elbow! Thank you for the wonderful service, You&apos;re awesome! :)

Favorite hamburgers in the area! Good fries and onion rings too! Would give it five stars but service is often slow. I&apos;ve improved my experience of late by calling in the order at least 15 mins ahead of time.

I have been a fan of fat burger for a while now, so I decided to go to the new location that just recently opened up in Pasadena.  I was excited because it had been a few months since I&apos;ve had one.

I pulled up to the drive thru and placed my order.  At which I pulled up to the window and waited patiently to pay and get my food.  The lady working the drive thru didn&apos;t even acknowledge my presence, and was too busy talking on the phone.  10 minutes had passed until she realized I was there, which was understandable since another person was waiting behind me.  Unfortunately, she questioned me and the staff about taking my  order.  Now I&apos;m not sure what went on from me placing an order and having said person behind the ear set, but I&apos;m not crazy.  I recall her asking me if I wanted onions or bacon added, which I responded with Bacon and chili.  Apparently my order entered some sort of magical void and disappeared like a phantom of Fat Burger.

To say the least I was pissed having to wait in the heat thinking I was going to get a Fat Burger, a good 20 minutes of my time wasted because of either an incapable employee or technology mix-up.  What added more fuel to the fire, the drive thru lady didn&apos;t even give an attempt to remedy the situation, and try to at least take my order and apologize for the clear mix up.  But even that was beyond her own ability to provide &quot;customer service&quot;.   I&apos;m never coming back to the fat burger again.  That&apos;s just horrible service, despite the great food.

Been driving past this place for quite some time and i finally gave in and decided to come here for lunch.  The burgers are pretty good...nothing to spectacular....sucks that they charge for cheese...esp since the price for a burger is pretty pricey...bacon i can understand.  They claim that each burger is made to order...and i assume it is due to the fact that i sat in the drive thru for over 20mins.  As a result...this should be a fair warning for those that think its a quick go in go out type of a restaurant.

Pros: Burgers were juicy

Cons: Pricey and the long wait

After trying this place, im not really interested in coming back again unless a friend wants to try it out for themselves then i might go along.  For me i think the price for their burgers is almost the same as The Counter or Fuddrucker

Theres nothing to hate about fat burger besides for the fact that its terrible for you, but at least their honest with their name, so you know very well what your getting into.

Having said that, I love fat burger. Its my guilty pleasure. Burger with the egg on top with BOTH fat and skinny fries, a coke and I&apos;m in my own fat heaven.
I always regret eating it after I gobble down every part of my meal, but its so delicious during the mastication session, and it seems like such a great idea when I&apos;m really hungry.

DAMN YOU FAT BURGER.

I really like the fat fries and the shakes.   I tried the strawberry and the peanut butter and both are super yummy!! I found the beef burgers to be too greasy for my taste! However, they do make awesome veggie burgers and their grilled chicken sandwich is very moist and delicious.

Not worth the wait, or the money.

11 bucks for a chili burger and fries that&apos;s only mediocre? Really?

Won&apos;t be coming back here. Voted Best Burger in LA and Las Vegas my ass.

The slow drive through should be expected. Burgers are cooked to order, so if you&apos;re looking for a way to burn a lot of gas while waiting, use the drive through.

However, the employees didn&apos;t seem to have any experience working in a food service restaurant. They had no knowledge of the menu, and the process of taking and confirming an order seemed foreign to them. I think if they had trained their staff before opening the restaurant things would work much better. Additionally, the speaker box in the drive through was as broken as you could imagine. It seemed like it was older than the original Taco Bell speaker that was there before this, or the Chinese place, or the Baja place, or the other Chinese place, or the other taco place.....Nothing seems to stay in this building, so I hope Fatburger follows that trend.

I have never been to a Fat Burger that got your food ready in a timely manner and this place is no exeption.  With that said, be prepared to wait for your food.  However, this particular location is offering all kinds of specials on many discount websites so you are getting a deal.  I don&apos;t think that their turkey burger is particularly good and I suggest only trying the fat fries because the skinny fries are not worth the calories.

Haven&apos;t been to a Fatburger in ages. Asked them to add the extras and also got a salad with it to alleviate any feelings of guilt I&apos;m about to have for putting this much saturated fat into my body. So I gotta add another half hour of cardio into my workout later. Big deal. The only downside was when I got the food home, they left off some of the sides that I paid for! (grrrr.) The burger was still good though. But I suggest you take the extra seconds to open the wrapper and check to make sure that you get everything that you paid for. Incidentally, if my order would&apos;ve been correct I would&apos;ve given this place four stars.

I love that they have huge burgers. I only got the Large size, which was enough for me, but they also have an XL and a XXL. They also have a Small and a Medium. You can also pick from regular, or fat fries, or onion rings. As for the taste of the burger, it&apos;s actually pretty good. They make everything right  when you order it and it doesn&apos;t take them that long to do it.

Well I came all the way from Brooklyn for this place? Let&apos;s just say I once witnessed what I thought was my ex girl friend washing my steak in dish washing liquid! This taste will never leave my mouth just as a fat burger never will!!!! This burger taste the same I can&apos;t wait to get the hell out of here with three things on my mind.... In n Out burger is #1 and five guys is #2 and # 3 will come at a later date.

I still don&apos;t get how this gets such low ratings hahaha. I really like this place, but maybe it&apos;s because of how hungry I am each time... Each time I go there, I get the skinny fries and a Small Fatburger. The fries are always hot, and the burger is alwayyyys filling! However, I have a little problem with their fat fries; can&apos;t describe it, they just taste funny, and make me feel a little uncomfortable. I also have to agree with the fact that this place is a little overpriced, but still, it&apos;s good food!

I love Fatburger, just not this one. Bottom line... I ordered a plain burger (no tomato, onion, pickle, lettuce, etc.) but I wanted to add bacon, egg and chili. I received the exact opposite. I still paid as if it were there. No thanks, Fatburger on Lake.

Came through the drive through. It was pretty slow. The burger and fat fries and drink were worth the wait.

Burger was juicy. Fries were crisp. Drink was cold and thirst quenching.

Nuff said???

Good piece of meat! The toppings and bread was fresh. The workers are meh but it&apos;s cool. I&apos;d be meh too if I worked at Fatburger. I&apos;m giving an extra star cause now you can order ONLINE. This is the first one of its kind (burgers) to do it, yo! AMIRIGHT?

I can&apos;t lie. This place is amazing. I&apos;ve never gone through the drive through, but every time I&apos;m there no one is in line! I love how there are so many different sizes for the burgers and the onion rings are to die for!

Yummy fast food! I&apos;ve never been here and I was a happy camper when I devoured my burger.  I didn&apos;t feel so guilty getting fat from this burger, it was well worth it!  I&apos;ll be here again when I feel like getting fat again.

Good burgers, love their Fat Fries and Oreo Shake... not to thrilled about the prices though, very comparable to to Johnny Rockets as far as burgers, though I prefer the Chilli Fries at Johnny Rockets more!

Sorry Fat Burger.....I was really rooting for you guys but you really disappointed me last night.  I didn&apos;t even finish ordering before I was writing this bad review in my head.

First of all, the drive thru line was pretty gnarly.  I&apos;d say that it rivals an In N Out drive thru line any day, and we&apos;ve all felt like we wasted our lives in one of THOSE lines before.  But a long line usually means there&apos;s a demand, so I was reassured to notice the impressive crowd jones-ing&apos; for their Fat-fix.  I half expected there to be some wait time at 8pm on a Sunday night anyway, and I sure as hell wasn&apos;t going to get out of my car at night, on Lake, North of the 210 for fear of getting gang raped.  (Ok, the neighborhood isn&apos;t THAT bad, but I&apos;ve been watching a lot of Law and Order SVU lately......it leaves any short white girl shaking in her Ugg boots when she ventures away from her home for a hot meal)  They had an attendant take orders before you could see the &quot;big board&quot;, which is really nerve-wrecking if you&apos;re a Fat Burger virgin (far from it on my end, but it&apos;s been a few years since I&apos;ve ordered here),  The attendant did have to-go menus for review on hand, but then you had to turn on your harsh, unflattering overhead light in your car and make quick, possibly rash decisions while he waits, tapping his stylus impatiently.  I forgot to order my burger with swiss cheese, and I blame the hovering burger monger.

Second of all, who runs out of bacon?  I understand if it&apos;s a side item that you don&apos;t need to keep stocked because no one orders it, but when you make it the star of your menu you need to prepare.  I was already waiting 10 minutes in line by the time they took my order, and unless I wanted to 4-wheel it over the concrete divider, I was stuck in the drive thru line and had to make due with a lack luster order.  The loss of bacon also meant that I couldn&apos;t order the wedge salad that I was counting on, and probably would have earned Fat Burger another 2 stars if it was available.

The burger itself was enjoyable enough -the meat had a nice seasoned taste, bun was soft, and the toppings were plentiful.  I&apos;m a huge pickle fan, and the use of sweet relish almost threw me, but I quickly accepted the new combination of flavors.  I like the option of the skinny fries and the fat fries -the fat fries are Red Robin-esque, minus the seasoning.....but luckily I have a container of the Red Robin seasoning at home.  My strawberry milkshake was too thick, and undrinkable until it melted down enough to move up the straw.  I&apos;m sending Fat Burger my Botox bill when I&apos;m in my 40&apos;s.  But I did like the option of getting whipped cream on my milkshake.  Fat Burger is all about options -reg, turkey, chicken or veggie burger.  Fat or skinny fries.  Cheese, bacon, chili or fried egg topping.  Chocolate, vanilla or strawberry shake.  I like options......until they give me an option and rip the rug from under me when they run out of said option.

Let&apos;s talk location, location, location.  The location is a pain in the ass to get to if you&apos;re coming from the south on Lake; lots of turning around.  The parking lot does accommodate for the long drive thru lane, so cars are not backing up traffic on Lake.  I know it&apos;s their trademark, but this building is such a neighborhood eyesore!  Even for a semi-ghetto area, who wants get their eyes raped by a neon yellow brick building with a flaming red roof on their commute every day?!  You have to turn right out of the drive thru, so if u thought u had it easy coming in from the north, you&apos;re in the same inconvenient boat us South Lake&apos;rs were when we drove in.  Welcome to our boat North Lake&apos;rs!

Fat Burger, you almost had me with the fries, and the tasty burger, but here&apos;s where you screwed your chances of getting a good review from this Yelper: I took one look at those plain, unseasoned fries and decided to ask for some blue cheese dipping sauce before I sped off.... *deep breath* ....hold on, give me a second, I&apos;m still pretty upset about this.  The drive thru guy told me they didn&apos;t have any blue cheese dressing.  I gawked at him and asked, &quot;Uhhh, I don&apos;t understand, how do you make a wedge salad without blue cheese dressing?&quot;  His TKO reply?  &quot;We make it with ranch.&quot;  I&apos;d give anything to have some water in my mouth at that moment so I could do a spit-take to express my pure shock.  If I found out that they served me &quot;The Wedge&quot; salad with ranch dressing, I would have driven back there, got out of my car (my rage would have out-weighed my fear of rape), knee&apos;d all of the employees in the groin and dumped their imitation salad over their heads.  In this fantasy everyone in the restaurant would stand and applaud my actions, I&apos;d do a slow motion hair toss, and walk &quot;hip-action style&quot; back to my car.

The very best! Great food, excellent staff, clean kitchen, a real treat to have Fatburger back in Pasadena. Luv the Fat Fries and the real ice cream shakes. Finally a fast food burger joint that actually uses real fresh quality beef, substantial enough that you can see eat but not so thick that it&apos;s gross.

I used to go to the fatburger over in Marina del Rey when I lived in Westchester and I loved it everytime! Boy the Pasadena location needs some help. Understandably busy from its reputation but wow they really cant handle the load very well. Food was cold and they couldn&apos;t get the order right. Maybe this place will get better when the novelty wears off but the col food, poor service and inefficiency forces the 2 stars at this point.

I&apos;m not one to complain much, but Fatburger really disappointed me.  The drive thru line took FOREVER to get through and then I noticed the prices of their food.  I know the burgers are big, but over $6 a burger?! That&apos;s a bit steep for a drive thru fast food restaurant.

At Fatburger, we&apos;ve been doing things our own way since 1952. Making custom burgers, one at time, for people like you. That&apos;s why:
* Every burger is grilled when you order it.
* We use only 100% USDA lean beef. Fresh, never frozen.
* Our onion rings come from onions, not the freezer.
* Our shakes are made with real hand-scooped ice cream.
* Our fries and onion rings are cooked in 100% cholesterol-free oil.
* Our famous chili is made with a secret blend of herbs and spices.
* No generic burgers.
* No lame music.
 
History
 
 Established in 1952 

In 1952, Lovie Yancey created something unique. A culture. A phenomenon, if you will. She created the biggest, juiciest hamburgers anyone had ever seen. So obviously, there was only one name for them - Fatburger.

Half a century later, while other places are just discovering taste, we&apos;re still making hamburgers the way she did. Fresh lean beef, not frozen patties. Cooked-to-order, just the way you want it, every time.

Now here&apos;s just a few things to make you drool over your keyboard: onion rings made from real onions. Hand-scooped, real ice cream shakes. Great tasting chili. And fries cooked in 100% cholesterol-free oil. All served with a smile. Fatburger. Distinctive seasonings and attitude since 1952.
