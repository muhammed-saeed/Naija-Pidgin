 chat Join Date Jan 2002 Location MN Posts 5,789 My order stated that a free gift cannot be included with this order when I tried to submit it. Maybe you can&apos;t get it with the sale items?

I just removed the free cheese/sausage gift and it went through. Last edited by flossie73; 01-03-2008 at 02:53 PM . Reply With Quote 01-03-2008,  03:00 PM #7 Sweet Cheeks

I tried to re-do it and get something that wasnt on sale, and it still wont let me get the free item. I even took off the $10 off code to see if thats why and it still wont let me 

with the sale and $10 off is still a good deal though Reply With Quote 01-03-2008,  03:05 PM #8 flossie73

Don&apos;t know why it wouldn&apos;t go through if you&apos;d removed the $10 off code... Reply With Quote 01-03-2008,  04:39 PM #9 my3joes
