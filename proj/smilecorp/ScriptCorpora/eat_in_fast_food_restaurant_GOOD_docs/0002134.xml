 A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2) 
Post by admin on Aug 26, 2003, 5:26pm

Fun conversation between me and my Quebecianese girlfriend:

Genevive says: it&apos;s funny, they just talked about canadian idol on the news

Genevive says: weird

The Full Monkey says: well, it&apos;s all your country has to live for, that and winter

Genevive says: oh shut up

The Full Monkey says: i&apos;m ever so witty

Genevive says: my country is better than yours

Genevive says: wanna fight?

Genevive says: come on

Genevive says: i&apos;m not scared of you

The Full Monkey says: hehe slap fight! slap fight!

Genevive says: what?

The Full Monkey says: girly slap fight

Genevive says: no, i don&apos;t do that

Genevive says: i kick butts

The Full Monkey says: by&quot;kicking butts&quot;, do you mean&quot;flinging your leg up and falling backwards&quot;? and by&quot;my country is better than yours&quot;, do you mean&quot;we routinely have to fight polar bears for parking spaces&quot;? Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Something that happened the other night:

We were drinking (yay college!) and I was, shall we say, orientationally challenged. So, slumped against the refrigerator, I was just listening to the conversation nearby. The conversation turned to trying to figure out who&apos;s the drunkest, and one guy says,&quot;One way to tell if you&apos;re really f---ed up is to slap yourself in the face and see if you feel it.&quot;

The following is a list of what I remember of the next minute or so:

1) CRRRRAAACK!
2) My vision has suddenly shifted down and to the left
3) There is laughter
4) Why is the floor so much closer now?
5) Everyone who was near the door is now out of view in the hallway
6) The guy not near the door is doubled over in laughter
7) I decide I won, though I&apos;m no longer sure what it was I won
8) The guy tells me he meant only a little tapping on the cheek
9)&quot;[long, loud expletive]&quot;

I did it again later for the cameras (yes, I have video of it, from the makers of&quot;$15 Stun Gun Test&quot;), where I managed to knock myself down.

It took me 4 hours to do my homework today....think these things are related? Nah. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Well, it&apos;s not so much that I&quot;heard&quot;this, but that it is funny, and I didn&apos;t feel exactly justified in opening a new thread. I bumped into it on the ThinkGeek page. Now, to the funny:

Why Engineers Don&apos;t Write Recipe Books:

Chocolate Chip Cookies:

Ingredients:

532.35 cm3 gluten
4.9 cm3 NaHCO3
4.9 cm3 refined halite
236.6 cm3 partially hydrogenated tallow triglyceride
177.45 cm3 crystalline C12H22O11
177.45 cm3 unrefined C12H22O11
4.9 cm3 methyl ether of protocatechuic aldehyde
Two calcium carbonate-encapsulated avian albumen-coated protein
473.2 cm3 theobroma cacao
236.6 cm3 de-encapsulated legume meats (sieve size #10)

To a 2-L jacketed round reactor vessel (reactor #1) with an overall heat transfer coefficient of about 100 Btu/F-ft2-hr, add ingredients one, two and three with constant agitation. In a second 2-L reactor vessel with a radial flow impeller operating at 100 rpm, add ingredients four, five, six, and seven until the mixture is homogenous. To reactor #2, add ingredient eight, followed by three equal volumes of the homogenous mixture in reactor #1. Additionally, add ingredient nine and ten slowly, with constant agitation. Care must be taken at this point in the reaction to control any temperature rise that may be the result of an exothermic reaction.

Using a screw extrude attached to a #4 nodulizer, place the mixture piece-meal on a 316SS sheet (300 x 600 mm). Heat in a 460K oven for a period of time that is in agreement with Frank&amp;Johnston&apos;s first order rate expression (see JACOS, 21, 55), or until golden brown. Once the reaction is complete, place the sheet on a 25C heat-transfer table, allowing the product to come to equilibrium.

Aahhh engineering humor! It reminds me of college.

An example of the kind of stuff we&apos;d encounter?
 http://www.twinkiesproject.com/ 

I once had a CIVI friend run strength comparisons between concrete and stale bagels from the school cafeteria. And then there&apos;s the almost legendary account of students turning around the statue of our founder in the middle of the night using nothing but an A-frame.

But as for funny things I heard today? Well, I just woke up. But I&apos;ll keep an ear open while watching the US Open. Rich Eisen&apos;s giving Johnny Mac a run for his money as the funniest tennis commentator. The other day he hosted a spelling bee where fans were asked to spell the names of tennis stars. Hee!

I was watching some news show the other day, and they cut to a reporter named John (I think) doing something about the recall election at a local (for them) pancake joint. The reporter says something like,&quot;Come on down, there&apos;s plenty of seats and the pancakes are delicios, and John is buying breakfast for..absolutely no one ask the crew.&quot;

The timing was perfect. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Hehe... from a news report last night.

There&apos;s a stretch of forest fires seriously endangering BC right now. Thankfully none near where I live, and there&apos;s (finally!) rain expected this weekend, but a good part of the interior is ablaze. Homes have been lost already, so people are taking measures to make sure theirs isn&apos;t next.

So I&apos;m watching them spray this goop onto these houses to act as a fire retardant. I&apos;m sure what the reporter meant to say was something like&quot;This gel is basically made from the same water-absorbing polymers as a baby&apos;s diapers, permitting it to hold water for an hour at a time&quot;.

What she actually said was:

&quot;Now, what you&apos;ll find in this gel is the same thing you&apos;d find in a baby&apos;s diaper.&quot;

I spent the next couple minutes laughing as they continued to show footage of people spraying what&quot;you&apos;d find in a baby&apos;s diaper&quot;all over their houses. Too funny. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Exchange last week between me and my friend Catie, who makes a habit of venting to me as often as possible:

Me: So what do you have to complain about today?
Catie (extremely unhappy): I&apos;m on my period. Do you wanna hear about THAT?
Me: Oh. ... Gee, well, um, I have to go... lift weights. What?

She didn&apos;t get it *and* I got to hear all about her period. Am I not blessed?

This is less &apos;heard&apos; and more &apos;saw&apos;, but it&apos;s funny regardless. I finally managed to find a job late last month working in a bookstore a few towns over. Besides being the community bookstore, it also serves as the college store for the local university, Wesleyan, and supplies most of the textbooks and Wesleyan clothing for the students. Not too long ago, the merchandise manager recieved a large shipment of brand-new hats for the college crew team and, against her wishes, they were put out for sale. Why was it against her wishes? The limited space on the hat won&apos;t allow for &apos;Wesleyan Crew&apos;, so it was shortened to simply read &apos;WESCREW&apos; in giant red lettering. To date, they&apos;re the best selling items in the store.

Wow. MRFH has been bested. This is easily the greatest movie review site in existence.

Best quote:

&quot;And although 99% of the time, [other movie critics] had really nice things to say about the movies they reviewed (and they use lots of great adjectives and punctuation!!!), sometimes they were really mean, like to Meg Ryan movies and stuff.&quot;

Also:

&quot;Anyway, the point is that sometimes I don&apos;t see or hear the things in the movie all that well, and I don&apos;t remember what I&apos;ve seen. So sometimes my movie reviews seem kind of confusing to people who have seen the movies because what I am talking about doesn&apos;t seem related to what they watched.&quot; Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2) 
Post by admin on Oct 3, 2003, 6:35pm

Some more quotes... this site is too funny. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because he seems so clueless, or so really messed up, or that he doesn&apos;t call any movie by its actual name (my favorite was&quot;Hannibal: A Love Story&quot;).

On A.I.:
&quot;On a scale of four or five stars, I give A.I. ten stars, five for Spielberg and five for Kubrick. Hooray!!!&quot;

On A Knight&apos;s Tale:
&quot;WHEN I was a child, I was taken to a doctor who asked me why I sometimes hurt small animals... my parents kept me away from small animals, primarily by locking me in my room and feeding me a steady diet of Ho-Ho&apos;s and Kool-Aid through a little slot in the door for about two years.&quot;

Same film:
&quot;This is the sweatiest, manliest, most appealing film I&apos;ve seen in years, and it deserves to be awarded every major cinematic honor.&quot;

Again, about Heath Ledger:
&quot;He is amazingly handsome, with a strong, jutting jaw; a proudly furrowed brow; haunting, lovely blue eyes; a rich, strokable mane of blonde hair; a powerful torso, which we see naked in one scene, probably the greatest scene I have ever seen in all my life; a lithe but still imposing frame; manly biceps; beautiful eyes, and his hair, and his jaw, and his hair, and his torso, and his hair, and oh oh god ohgodohgod.jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj&quot;

On Fight Club:
&quot;I would like to point out that I won&apos;t be talking about Fightin&apos; Club. I&apos;ll be writing about it .&quot;

Again, Fight Club:
&quot;All the best film reviewing spots are currently being given to women and minorities, and even after my review of last year&apos;s Blade, with Wesley Snipes as a vampire-killing vampire halfbreed, I have been unable to find steady work.&quot;

On Die Another Day:
&quot;LET&apos;S face it: England&apos;s on a roll. First they won the Falklands War, then they successfully killed that troublemaking princess, and now a new James Bond movie - Die Another Time!&quot;

On Shaft:
&quot;speaking of which, what the heck happened to Siskel? He hasn&apos;t been on in ages!&quot;

On Star Wars: AOTC:
&quot;You know, ha ha, the word&quot;Clone&quot;is in the title, so I will make a funny pun of it. Well, what if I do that with some movie you like, like&quot;You have to be Patient to watch The English Patient&quot;? See how that feels? Hurts, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;

On the Oscars:
&quot;The big winner was, of course, the musical Chicago directed by Wisconsin native Rob Marshall, which proves that there is a God, and that He is probably a gay man.&quot;

 Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2) 
Post by poolman on Oct 3, 2003, 11:45pm

Wow. Just WOW. I love this site.

On Freddy Vs Jason:
&quot;In Freddy vs. Jason, the screenwriters come up with a brilliant way to get both monsters together. What if it wasn&apos;t just teenagers who were having sex, drinking a lot, and even smoking pot, but actually teenagers on Elm Street doing all of these things? These two monsters are drawn to them like moths to wool, with Freddy killing them in their sleep and Jason getting them while they&apos;re awake. It helps to think of this in pro wrestling terms.&quot;

(This incident is edited slightly to remove names.)

One of my room mates broke one of his guitar strings the other day, so he replaced the whole set (apparently that&apos;s a good idea), and when he was done came out to the living room and asked my other room mate if he wanted the old strings to kill anyone with.

In my ongoing effort to totally freak these guys out, I said,&quot;Oh, I could use that. I have a couple enemies.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m not giving them to you.&quot;

&quot;You were going to give them to him.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m fairly certain he won&apos;t kill ME with them.&quot;

I sprained my knee or strained a tendon or something in the Turkey Trot I ran in yesterday, but since I was the only woman running and I finished, I won. I went to the hospital this morning, and was telling the nurse what happened. After he gave me a mock stern look about hurting myself in something called a Turkey Trot, I pointed out that I DID win a turkey! His response was&quot;Yeah, the most expensive turkey your health insurance ever paid for!&quot;

On the counting-my-blessings side, as I was waiting for the doctor in the ER a man died from cardiac arrest. I could hear his wife crying from my room. It really, really, really put things into immediate sharp perspective.

Everyone have a wonderful Thanksgiving, and count those blessings!

Couple quotes for youse guyse (particularly because quoting one`s self is so humble).

[This one was during the second of two Christmas eve sermons I did, this one being at 11:00pm where I was very tired and was a little punchy doing the same sermon for a second time.]

ME: And then the angels, who were so excited to finally announce the Messiah`s birth, burst out from the heavens singing at the top of their lungs. It knocked the poor shepherds to the ground scared for their lives... and this is where the term ``Shepherd`s pie`` comes from...

[Pause, then laughter and some accusing glares at a Christmas eve poop joke.]

I&apos;ve been meaning to post this one for a bit... hubby sent it to me. Some are okay, but some are hysterical. This just seemed the right forum for it.

What NOT to do at Return of the King (or other LOTR movies)
1. Stand up halfway through the movie and yell loudly,&quot;Wait... where the hell is Harry Potter?&quot;
2. Block the entrance to the theater while screaming:&quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!&quot;- After the movie, say&quot;Lucas could have done it better.&quot;
3. Play a drinking game where you have to take a sip every time someone says:&quot;The Ring.&quot;
4. Point and laugh whenever someone dies.
5. Ask everyone around you if they think Gandalf went to Hogwarts.
6. Finish off every one of Elrond&apos;s lines with&quot;Mr. Anderson.&quot;
7. When Aragorn is crowned king, stand up and at the top of your lungs sing,&quot;And I did it.... MY way...!&quot;
8. Talk like Gollum all through the movie. At the end, bite off someone&apos;s finger and fall down the stairs.
9. Dress up as old ladies and reenact&quot;The Battle of Helms Deep&quot;Monty Python style.
10. When Denethor lights the fire, shout&quot;Barbecue!&quot;
11. In TTT when the Ents decide to march to war, stand up and shout&quot;RUN FOREST, RUN!&quot;
12. Every time someone kills an Orc, yell:&quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m Tolkien about!&quot;See how long it takes before you get kicked out of the theatre.
13. During a wide shot of a battle, inquire,&quot;Where&apos;s Waldo?&quot;
14. Talk loudly about how you heard that there is a single frame of a nude Elf hidden somewhere in the movie.
15. Start an Orc sing-a-long.
16. Come to the premiere dressed as Frankenfurter and wander around looking terribly confused.
17. When they go in the paths of the dead, wait for tense moment and shout,&quot;I see dead people!&quot;
18. Imitate what you think a conversation between Gollum, Dobby and Yoda would be like.
19. Release a jar of daddy-long-legs into the theater during the Shelob scene.
20. Wonder out loud if Aragorn is going to run for governor of California.
21. When Shelob comes on, exclaim,&quot;Man! Charlotte&apos;s really let herself go!&quot;

There was a show on last night which featured a wood chipper. Not the backyard variety, but the big kind that chips whole trees and has treads to make an M-1 tank envious. The thing is two stories tall not counting the crane and can chew through hundreds of trees a day, yet they actually said this, I swear:

&quot;...it does not harm the forest.&quot;

Except for the hill that was clearcut, trampled with a 20 ton machine, and covered in wood chips to choke out any remaining signs of life in an appaling mockery of resource management, yeah, it&apos;s pretty environmentally friendly. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

I wanted to make this my new signature line, but it was a bit too long. So I share it with you here:

&quot;Most moviegoers are like people who go to a restaurant without taking their stomachs. They buy something. They taste it. They react to how it tastes. They compare it to other things they&apos;ve tasted. And then, they let go of that experience, and they go on to the next plate. They never digest the film. Thus, they come away malnourished.&quot;-- Jeffrey Overstreet Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

I went to a nice Italian restaurant the other day with my whole family. The place is decorated heavily with Catholic statues, images, and whatnot. Most people find it somewhat unnerving. Anyway, my grandmother was sitting at the head of the table facing away from a short glass case holding several statues of Jesus. Now, the one in particular sitting directly behind my grandmother must have been a factory second, because all he needed in his outstreched hands to look like a rapist was a rag and a bottle of chloroform. So I told my grandmother,&quot;Don&apos;t look now, but Jesus is sneaking up on you.&quot;

Why God Never Received Tenure at a University

1. Because he had only one major publication.
2. And it was in Hebrew.
3. And it had no cited references.
4. And it wasn&apos;t published in a refereed journal or even submitted for peer review.
5. And some even doubt he wrote it himself.
6. It may be true that he created the world but what has he done since?
7. The scientific community has had a very rough time trying to replicate his results.
8. He rarely came to class, just told students to read the book.
9. He expelled his first two students for learning.
10. Although there were only ten requirements, most students failed his tests.
11. His office hours were infrequent and usually held on a mountain top.

&quot;What&apos;s your problem, sir?&quot;the receptionist inquires.

&quot;It&apos;s my penis.&quot;He says quite loudly, gaining disapproving looks from the others in the room.

The receptionist leans towards him and says&quot;You really shouldn&apos;t say that in a full room of people.&quot;

&quot;Well what should I say?&quot;The man asks.

&quot;Well, you could say it&apos;s your ear and then tell the doctor your real problem when you&apos;re alone in the examination room.&quot;She replies.

&quot;Ohhh...&quot;the man says with a smile and a conspiritorial nod. He promptly leaves. Ten minutes later he returns and marches to the receptionist&apos;s desk.

&quot;Hello, sir.&quot;She smiles.

&quot;I need to see the doctor.&quot;He says with a wink.

Ok, so my girlfriend works at the state mental hospital here in Austin. As you can imagine&quot;I heard the funniest thing today&quot;takes on a whole new meaning for her when she goes to work.

Anyway, this one crazy lady (very small, very shy, they never have violence problems with her) walked over to another patient, put her hands on his head and tried to do the head twist to brake his neck. She&apos;s very puny, so she barely got a head turn out of the guy. A few staff (including my girlfriend) rushed over to pull her away from the other patient. They asked her why she decided to do that. She looked at them very calmly, and in a matter-of-fact manner said:

&quot;He is evil. And must be destroyed.&quot;

Then she just walked off and started watch TV.

i think this may be one of those things which is only funny if you were there, but here goes

last night was a party at my residence at university where all the upper years buy alcohol and the first years just drink. the upper years will generally buy the most disgusting alcohol they can find
two funny things
i went with a few friends to the liquor store
two of them bought 40s of malt liquor called&quot;force 10&quot;when we got to the checkout one asked if they had anything worse than force 10 and the guy said&quot;when the homeless come in they usually buy (some other 40 of malt, i forget the name) if we don&apos;t have any, we offer them this, as it&apos;s the next cheapest. they&apos;ll walk out and say they just won&apos;t drink anything
we all found that absolutely hilarious

another funny part
i bought a two litre plastic bottle of stuff called Well&apos;s Ale. i figured several people would work together to drink it
we got to the party and one of my friends grabs the bottle, hands it to ONE first year and says&quot;drink this&quot;
the kid was doing his best on it when i finally stumbled out of the party
i felt really bad for him

I&apos;m doing a group project for my AOE materials class. My job is basically to write up the report. When I was typing in the bibliography yesterday, among our 20-some resources, I listed&quot;The Hobbit.&quot;Just to see if anyone actually reads those things. I&apos;ll let you know how it turns out.

I was tempted to list Mithril as one of the candidate materials, but I think that may be a bit too obvious. And one hell of an expensive propeller shaft. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Be careful. They do.

We think this prof would get a kick out of it. He has a pretty good sense of humor.

Our advisor doesn&apos;t get named on the report. Sucker! He shouldn&apos;t waste his time with such a low level undergrad course. (BTW, he reviewed our rough draft today and didn&apos;t notice it.)

Are you speaking from experience on the name thing? It does sound embarassing.

Right now my biggest concern is finding a creative way to say that we didn&apos;t want to bother with doing some calculations (we ruled out steel because of that). Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2) 
Post by lissa on Apr 15, 2004, 9:31pm

Yeah, the name thing was out of personal experience. My former advisor had written one of the books we cited. His first name was Harold. We typed Farold. Oops. (We also spelled his last name wrong too.)

Even worse was when said advisor was at my Master&apos;s defense. I&apos;d misquoted one of his pubs. OOPS. But not only was HE on my committe, his two co-writers were on my committee too!!!!

&quot;I don&apos;t remember writing that. Did you write that, Michael?&quot;
&quot;No! I would never write that. Are you sure you didn&apos;t write it, Harold?&quot;
&quot;Nope. Chunshan?&quot;
&quot;Me? Oh no!&quot;

It was like that scene in the Lion King, where the hyenas are denying that they know Simba is Mufasa&apos;s son and then look over....&quot;Ed???&quot;

So many funny things happen daily around here, but most of them you have to see to believe.

*Me, acting like a psychopath at Quiz Bowl practice and then answering a question about a mental institution.

*A game at church, where two girls sat in two chairs with a blanket stretched over the chairs, so it looks like three. A guy walks in, doing a male-supermodel strut, sit down in the&quot;middle chair&quot;, and... the two girls stand up. Priceless. Fabio was thwarted. (He has Fabio-like hair, but much better.)

*Painting the youth room at church. One wall was magenta, the next light blue, the third yellow... and the fourth red. Never mind.

Yesterday I found out that I placed in the top three of a rather prestigious (in this state) writing contest. I&apos;m supposed to attend their Spring conference to discover which place I actually won. (And I get to read my entry... yadda yadda yadda...)

Anyway, aside from certificates and trophies, first place wins $50, second is $30, third is $20. However if I understand correctly, it&apos;s going to cost me $45 to attend the conference, plus $18 for lunch, plus maybe $10 in gas to get there and back. So, best case scenario is that I only end up about $23 in the hole! Woohoo!!!

 My Mood: Depressed 
 I would probably be listening to: Linkin Park - Crawling 


Had another dream last night. Something about a torture wheel, a frenzied crowd, and guessing &apos;A Popular Word or Phrase&apos;. I didn&apos;t really understand it; it sounds more like something Torequemada and his little clique of bullies would be into.

Those guys are jerks. At school today they started pushing around this girl in my Religious Education class, Joan, calling her a heretic and a witch. She was pretty upset. I think she went off to cry in the bathroom, while Torquey and his friends drew devil horns on her locker in magic marker. I think everyone in class wouldn&apos;t mind seeing them get their asses kicked, but I think they&apos;re all afraid they&apos;ll get picked on next. 

It looks like that cute girl Antionette is going to the Spring ball with Julius Scaliger 

I wish I would have asked her out. I don&apos;t think she knows who am I though 

I wrote a poem about how I feel to try and make me feel better. It&apos;s not very good, I dont think.

 Sitting alone at night in secret study;
it is placed on the brass tripod.
A slight flame comes out of the emptiness and
makes successful that which should not be believed in vain. 

Pretty stupid, huh?

My best friend Christine (OMG *hugs*) says its pretty good, but she&apos;s always saying stuff like that to make me feel better.

I wish Linkin Park were around now instead of 500 years in the stupid future. I predicted pretty much all of their first album in a dream last month, and I try and remember as much of it as I can when I&apos;m feeling down like this. I even tried to write out some of the music and find someone to play it, but it didn&apos;t sound the same. 14th Century France sucks.

Most of the rest of the class are going off travelling over the summer as well; everyone was talking about where they&apos;re gonna go. I have to stay in stupid school though if I want to be a doctor. I wish my parents would understand that I need to just do my own thing for a little while like everyone else in my class. Instead I have to do stuff with leeches all summer.

Its not fair 

I&apos;m gonna go try to remember some more Linkin Park songs. Maybe that will make me feel better.

 I would probably be listening to: Linkin Park - In The End 

I hate being misunderstood. Its hard enough being 17 years old in 14th Century France, you know. No-one &apos;gets&apos; what I&apos;m about.

I saw some of the guys from class this evening, talking about their summer trips. I tried to help them out a little by suggesting they maybe get a ship and sail West across the Atlantic till they hit something. Would they listen? They just accused me of trying to get them to sail off the edge of the world! Then they started pushing me around, and calling me &apos;Nostra-DAME&apos;, because they know I hate that. 

I was just trying to help them out, you know 

I wish I could live in the future. I&apos;d go and see Linkin Park live every day. They understand my pain, even if no-one else does.

I just wish someone would be my friend 

I&apos;m so tired of rejection. I&apos;m going to go cry into my pillow for a while.

Someone who&apos;s more experienced at cooking than I am, tell me--is it normal for your food in the oven to burn a hole through aluminum foil? I was roasting some chicken with aluminum foil on top (who wants to baste?), and when I checked it some liquid had bubbled through and crusted on the outside. The aluminum ripped like tissue paper at that spot.

The chicken was delcious anyway. McCormack should bottle aluminum powder. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

A joke I heard...

A woman walked into a general store and saw a huge brass rat standing by the door. She rather liked it and asked the store owner if it was for sale.

&quot;$50 for the rat, and $200 for the story that goes with it.&quot;

The woman decided to buy the rat, sans story. As she was driving home, she noticed that every rat in town began to follow her car. She was on a bridge and stopped, throwing the rat out the window into the water. All of the rats jumped into the water after it.

She went back to the store and briskly walked up to the owner. The owner asked,&quot;Still want to know the story?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot;replied the woman.&quot;I want to know if you have a brass man.&quot;

Joke time...

A Briton, a Canadian, and an American have all committed a horrible crime and are sentenced to be whipped 10 times.

The American is the first to be whipped. But first, the Whipmaster asks him&quot;What is your favorite movie?&quot;. The American responds&quot;Star Wars&quot;. The Whipmaster says&quot;Ok, that&apos;s a good movie, so I&apos;ll let you have one wish before you get whipped.&quot;. The American asks to have a piece of cloth strapped to his back to soften the blow. He gets his wish, but the cloth rips during the whipping, and the American feels all the pain.

The Briton is next. The Whipmaster asks what his favorite movie is and he replies&quot;Jaws&quot;. The Whipmaster agrees that it is a good movie and allows him a wish before getting whipped. The Briton asks to have a pillow strapped to his back to soften the blow. He gets the pillow, but it gets torn from the whip and the Briton feels all the pain anyway.

The Canadian is last. The Whipmaster asks him what his favorite movie is and he replies&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. The Whipmaster exclaims&quot;Hey, that&apos;s my favorite movie too! Because we have the same favorite movie, you get two wishes before you get whipped.&quot;

The Canadian says bravely,&quot;I wish to be whipped 100 times.&quot;The Whipmaster is confused but accepts it and asks the Canadian what his other wish is. He responds,&quot;I wish to have the American strapped to my back to soften the blow.&quot; Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

This didn&apos;t happen today, but it&apos;s still one of the funniest things I&apos;ve heard in a long while.

I was riding in my sister&apos;s car (which is pretty old and was in bad shape when this happened), and we were gonna make a turn, and she turned on the turn signal. The car would struggle to made the turn signal noise, and in between efforts, the car would make wheezing noises. It sounded like somebody had to manually work the turn signal by pulling on 2 ton weights inside the car. It sounded like:

click-click...wheeze...click-cli...wheeze...

and so on in a similar fashion. It made me laugh so hard. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

They gave me one this morning actually.

Backstory: Last night, youngest offspring had a nightmare and called for backup. (Me.) Said she was sure that one of the Terminators was either in the bathroom or the basement. I explained how Arnie has other things on his mind in California and besides, he was the Kindergarten Cop, so no worries. Besides, I tell her, the bathroom is waaaay too small for such an entity. She replies that the&quot;liquid Terminator&quot;is a shape-shifter and can become anything or fit anywhere. In fact, she says, -I- could be one.
So I explain that of any shape for a Terminator to take, it&apos;s extraodinarily unlikely that one would be desperate enough to change into my doppelganger. She accepts this. So I get her a glass of water, tuck her in, kiss her gently on the forehead and whisper,&quot;I&apos;ll be back.&quot;

You should have heard the scream.

Anyway, as of this morning, I&apos;m the&quot;Mominator&quot;.

A short story:

So I finally convinced my girlfriend that before the final Star Wars movie is released to theaters, she had to watch all of the earlier ones with me, starting with the originals so she doesn&apos;t break up with me before we get to the good ones. We watched Star Wars a couple days after the DVD set was released, then TESB last weekend. Today, at long last, came time for RoTJ. Now, as we&apos;re lying there on the couch, we come to the scene where the ewoks have just captured the rebels and are planning to cook them for dinner. At this point, the girlfriend turns to me and asks,&quot;Why doesn&apos;t C-3PO just order the ewoks to let them go?&quot;

Now I, of course, give her the stock answer:&quot;Well, uh... you heard him, it&apos;s against his programming to impersonate a deity.&quot;To which she responds with annoyance,&quot;No, it&apos;s because he&apos;s a punk.&quot;

Yes she did. I ask you, has there ever been a more perfect woman?

My&quot;boss&quot;, Pastor Steve, has an ongoing fued with me. I guess fued is too strong of a word, but we&apos;re always looking for verbal and joke practical superiority in all situations. I got him good the other day.

He called me to let me know he was going to be late to our monthly meeting night at church, and told me to let everyone know he&apos;d be along presently.

This gave me an opportunity.

I went into the meeting and quickly thinking of how to spring a great lie while being unable to keep a smile off my face, I decided to make humor part of the lie.

&quot;Hey, did you guys hear what happened to Steve?&quot;I said, with a half-grin.

&quot;No&quot;&quot;No, what?&quot;

&quot;You didn&apos;t hear?&quot;I said, as if hearing this news should&apos;ve been commonplace by now.

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;Steve was bitten by a squirrel.&quot;I had to improvise a bit to where I was leading up to.

&quot;What?&quot;&quot;Really?&quot;&quot;Where was this?&quot;

&quot;He didn&apos;t say, but they couldn&apos;t catch the squirrel, so he had to drive over to the hospital to get rabies shots. So he&apos;s going to be a few minutes late.&quot;

At this point, everyone&apos;s buying it... grownups highly amused and also slightly shocked that this has happened to their beloved pastor.

Steve walks into the meeting about ten minutes later, as I&apos;m biting my lip trying to keep from laughing out loud. He then gets hit with questions like:

&quot;So where&apos;s the damage?&quot;

&quot;Where&apos;d he bite you?&quot;

&quot;How many shots did you have to get?&quot;

Poor Steve. Quite bewildered. It&apos;s gone down as the day I gave him rabies.

-------

Also, today, we were throwing around the idea of getting an electronic sign out in front of the church to post sermon titles and upcoming church events.

&quot;That&apos;d be so cool,&quot;I said.&quot;You just know I&apos;d hack into it and the next week would be a message saying, &apos;This Sunday: See a man of the cloth go The Full Monty!&apos; I bet we&apos;d get a lot of new people for that.&quot;

The idea was nixed. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

We&apos;re having a great time, playing old-school Smash Brothers and drinking (because I didn&apos;t get enough at Lissa&apos;s... yeesh), until it happens to come up in conversation that I&apos;m writing movie reviews online now. At which point he turns, stares at me incredulously for maybe two seconds, and then busts out with,&quot;Who the [very emphatic expletive deleted] wants to know what YOU think?!&quot;

And he wonders why I don&apos;t tell him in the first place...

I did a splendid rendition of&quot;Lady Marmalade,&quot;since I&apos;m the whitest girl to ever memorize and execute Li&apos;l Kim&apos;s rap part perfectly. Then Braxton picked up the mic and let it go with&quot;It&apos;s My Life&quot;by No Doubt. He sounded like... like... Gwen Stefani.

THE INFAMOUS TWINKIES PROJECT! Yay! I always knew that those little things were evil...

This happened a couple of years ago, but it is still funny. One of my Aunt-and-Uncles went to Kentucky Fried Chicken for lunch and ordered a dozen chicken nuggets. The clerk informed them that those did not come in a size of one dozen. They only came four, six or twelve to an order. 

Here&apos;s another hilarious bit. I only wish I had written this.
 http://www.heavenly-creatures.net/luminati/archives/003615.html 
&quot;I never dreamed slowly cruising on my motorcycle through a residential neighborhood could be so incredibly dangerous! Little did I suspect ...I was on Brice Street - a very nice neighborhood with perfect lawns and slow traffic. As I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me. It was a squirrel, and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to brake or avoid it-it was that close.
I hate to run over animals, and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but a squirrel should pose no danger to me. I barely had time to brace for the impact.
Animal lovers, never fear. Squirrels, I discovered, can take care of themselves! Inches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing on his hind legs and facing my oncoming Valkyrie with steadfast resolve in his little beady eyes. His mouth opened, and at the last possible second, he screamed and leapt! I am pretty sure the scream was squirrel for,&quot;Bonzai!&quot;or maybe,&quot;Die you gravy-sucking, heathen scum!&quot;The leap was nothing short of spectacular ... as he shot straight up, flew over my windshield, and impacted me squarely in the chest.
Instantly, he set upon me. If I did not know better, I would have sworn he brought 20 of his little buddies along for the attack. Snarling, hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I was dressed only in a light T-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was doing some damage!
Picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and leather gloves, puttering at maybe 25 mph down a quiet residential street, and in the fight of his life with a squirrel. And losing...
I grabbed for him with my left hand. After a few misses, I finally managed to snag his tail. With all my strength, I flung the evil rodent off to the left of the bike, almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw. That should have done it. The matter should have ended right there. It really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have headed home. No one would have been the wiser.
But this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary angry squirrel. This was an EVIL MUTANT ATTACK SQUIRREL OF DEATH !
Somehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands and, with the force of the throw, swung around and with a resounding thump and an amazing impact, he landed squarely on my back and resumed his rather antisocial and extremely distracting activities. He also managed to take my left glove with him!
The situation was not improved. Not improved at all. His attacks were continuing, and now I could not reach him. I was startled to say the least.
The combination of the force of the throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Valkyrie can only have one result. Torque. This is what the Valkyrie is made for, and she is very, very good at it. The engine roared and the front wheel left the pavement. The squirrel screamed in anger. The Valkyrie screamed in ecstasy.
I screamed in ... well ... I just plain screamed.
Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a slightly squirrel-torn-t-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, and roaring at maybe 50 mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet residential street on one wheel and with a demonic squirrel on his back. The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder.
With the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on the handlebars and try to get control of the bike. This was leaving the mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash into somebody&apos;s tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured out how to release the throttle ... my brain was just simply overloaded. I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little effect against the massive power of the big cruiser.
About this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient attention to this very serious battle (maybe he is an evil mutant NAZI attack squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got INSIDE my full-face helmet with me. As the faceplate closed part way, he began hissing in my face. I am quite sure my screaming changed intensity. It had little effect on the squirrel, however. The RPMs on The Dragon maxed out (since I was not bothering with shifting at the moment) so her front end started to drop.
Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a very raggedly torn T-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, roaring at probably 80 mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy squirrel&apos;s tail sticking out of the mostly closed full-face helmet.
By now the screams are probably getting a little hoarse. Finally I got the upper hand .. I managed to grab his tail again, pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I could. This time it worked... sort-of. Spectacularly sort-of, so to speak.
Picture a new scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do some paperwork. Suddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a torn T-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing only one leather glove, moving at probably 80 mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody murder roars by and with all his strength throws a live squirrel grenade directly into your police car.
I heard screams. They weren&apos;t mine... I managed to get the big motorcycle under control and dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign of a busy cross street. I would have returned to fess up (and to get my glove back).
I really would have. Really. Except for two things. First, the cops did not seem interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment.
When I looked back, the doors on both sides of the patrol car were flung wide open. The cop from the passenger side was on his back, doing a crab walk into somebody&apos;s front yard, quickly moving away from the car. The cop who had been in the driver&apos;s seat was standing in the street and was aiming a riot shotgun at his own police car. So the cops were not interested in me.
They often insist to&quot;let the professionals handle it&quot;anyway. That was one thing. The other? Well, I could clearly see shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery from the back seat. But I could also swear I saw the squirrel in the back window, shaking his little fist at me. That is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car. A somewhat shredded patrol car ... but it was all his.
I took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made a gentle right turn off of Brice Street, and sedately left the neighborhood. I decided it was best to just buy myself a new pair of gloves. And some Band-Aids.&quot;

*rimshot*

Anyway, I guess this one qualifies on a technicality. The building I work in has a restroom on the 1st floor that I sometimes use before going to lunch or at the end of the day. And unlike the one upstairs in our office, this restroom has those automatic flush urinals without the levers- look ma, no hands. But as I settled myself in front of one today and began to let nature take its course, I heard something unexpected: an electronic BEEP! noise. Well. That&apos;s not so strange in and of itself, but what did strike me as odd is where the noise seemed to be emanating from: namely, my groinal region. Hmmm. Now, as you no doubt realized immediately, the sound was actually being made by the urinal&apos;s sensor, conveniently located in the same vicinity. But let me tell you, in the second or two between hearing the noise and figuring this out, blind instinct led me to only one inescapable conclusion:

My penis was beeping.

And my male brethren, I ask you- what does a man do in a situation like this? Crazy thoughts flitted through my head- was it trying to tell me it was fully cooked and ready to be served? Should I try checking the time and temperature? Did I need to cut the red wire? Or was it simply an&quot;all systems nominal&quot;beep? All these things and more crossed my mind before comprehension dawned, and thank God it did or I&apos;d still be in there, wondering if it was trying to send me a message in morse code. (Like,&quot;Hey, a little more careful with the zipper there, buddy.&quot;) So friends, I warn you here and now: if your little general ever starts making strange noises, don&apos;t panic! It&apos;s probably just all a big misunderstanding.



 But if it starts turning strange colors , well, that&apos;s when you should probably see a doctor...

Because I gave the teaser on the Idiots on Parade thread....

Okay. So, I get up the other morning, it&apos;s a nice enough morning, take a shower and kiss Duckie goodbye and all that. And I think,&quot;I should water the plant on the step before I forget.&quot;So I fill the pitcher I use and step outside to quick do that, and then head back in.

Click.

Click.

Oh, shoot.

Yup. I&apos;d locked myself out. At 7:15 in the morning. Wearing NOTHING but a robe. (No underwear or bra, even.) Wet hair. Teeth unbrushed. No shoes. And no cell phone.

Well. Whose door do you knock on at 7:15 AM? I&apos;m kind of looking around, hoping that one of my neighbors will magically appear. And then... I see one! He&apos;s across the common ground, working in the garden in the back. I don&apos;t know him, but I&apos;m desperate, right? Right. So I pad across the the common ground, clutching my robe around me (and for some reason, still clinging to my pitcher). I get over there and explain my problem, so grateful that there&apos;s someone there!

One problem. He doesn&apos;t speak a WORD of English.

Oh, shoot. Again.

Well, fortunately, he speaks Mandarin Chinese. And so do I! But the problem is, I last spoke Chinese 10 years ago. I can&apos;t remember the word for house. I can&apos;t remember the word for phone call. I can&apos;t remember anything of any practical use at this point, and he doesn&apos;t seem to understand that I want to make a phone call. Finally, he points to the front of the house, and I catch the word&quot;son&quot;, and I get that he wants me to go around to the front and he&apos;ll get his son.

So I do. And he does.

His son is a little bit older than me- nice guy. Speaks perfectly good English. Phew! I explain my dilemma (feeling incredibly foolish as I stand there in my robe), and ask if I can use his phone. My mother-in-law lives 5 miles away and has a spare key to our place (thank GOD!). He very graciously allows me to use his phone- which is really nice since he and I have never spoken before.

I can&apos;t remember my in-law&apos;s phone number. And they&apos;re unlisted.

I call Duckie. His cell phone is off. I call my mother. She doesn&apos;t have the number written down. But for some reason, I can remember the phone number of my brother-in-law and his wife, and again, thank god, she works a lot from home. She&apos;s home and gives me the number. I call my mother-in-law, who says she&apos;ll be right over. (phew!)

Kind of an anti-climatic ending- I did get back in the house, but man. What a morning that was! Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Sweet idea. Tying in slightly, several months ago I went to visit a friend in NYC, and his sister took us to a restaurant her company did some design work for... real artsy-fartsy place. Well, I excuse myself and go to the restroom at one point, and what do I find? A movie projector on the ceiling, showing a film on the floor of the lavatory right in front of the toilet. Thank God it wasn&apos;t anything I really wanted to see, or it would have been a loooooong wait for the next guy who needed to go.

Some days, not often, but some days I think we all have a conversation that we&apos;re 100% sure no one has ever had in all of history. Here goes mine for today.

We have two wedding dresses, see, from our April wedding. The first dress, ordered online from China (we thought it was coming from England, as both countries look very similar on a map), came to us far too small and too late to send it back and get a replacement. They also refused to accept it back for a refund when I mailed it back to China, so it came back to me again, this merry little wedding dress crossing the Pacific twice and never once being worn. We also have my wife&apos;s replacement wedding dress bought after the first one freaked us out so.

Being a newly married couple that likes eating two or three times a day, we&apos;re going through our stuff and posting it on eBay for sale. Hello, two wedding dresses! Caramel puts them up for bidding the other day, and proceeds to watch them like a hawk. I mean, every freaking minute she&apos;s logging on to eBay, obsessing over the people&quot;watching&quot;but not&quot;bidding&quot;, and sweating blood and tears over minute details of posting. I also neglected to say that one of the dresses she took a picture of was posted with the picture *sideways*. It&apos;s the wedding dress for the lazy bride!

Anyway, that brings you up to speed on today&apos;s quote, a conversation really, as she calls me from work:

HER: Justin! Log onto eBay! Quick!

ME: Um... okay. Why?

HER: You&apos;ve got to bid on those dresses, now!

[Now, her thinking is that if the dresses don&apos;t get a high enough bid -- she hates using the&quot;reserve&quot;-- she&apos;ll have me fake buy it. But she also wants me to fake bid on it to drive other people into a shopping frenzy. I shared with her my suspicions that eBay probably doesn&apos;t condone this type of manipulation, but I&apos;m just a guy and what do I know?]

ME: Babe, you have four days left on them. Why do you need me bidding on them?

HER: It&apos;s the weekend! People buy more on the weekend! Put the bidding on each at $75.

ME: I don&apos;t want two wedding dresses. In fact, I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve already paid for both of these this year, plus some extra fancy shipping for one of them to take a cruise to China and back.

HER: Please... log on right now.

ME: [checking my computer] My password doesn&apos;t work for some reason.

HER: [clacking of a keyboard on the phone] Oh yes it does. There you go! I bid for you.

ME: Thank you. Tonight, I&apos;m going to sell you your own bed if you want some place to sleep. Talk to you later! *click* Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Anyway, I&apos;m sure everyone is familiar with a certain derogatory epithet for Italian-Americans that begins with a&quot;w&quot;and ends with a&quot;p&quot;. However, my great-uncle recently explained the origins of that word to us- it stands for&quot; W ith o ut p apers, a reference to when Italians used to come through Ellis Island without official documents granting them U.S. citizenship. Obviously it&apos;s not cool to use that word now, but I thought it was interesting to learn that the origin of the word, while not flattering, wasn&apos;t quite as volatile. So that&apos;s one to grow on!

In England, in addition to flipping the bird, we have a&quot;cussing gesture&quot;where you stick two figures up at someone in a v-sign (as seen in the BBC show, Young Ones if you want a point of reference ).

This originates from middle ages Britain where anyone caught attempting to assassinate soldiers with a bow and arrow had those two fingers chopped off. By sticking those fingers up, you were basically taunting the soldiers that you could quite easily have a crack at them with a bow...

Not so much a funny quote as a funny situation.

So, my normal beard status fluctuates between a full goatee (moustache and chin action) and just the chin bush. I also usually only shave twice a week -- Sunday and Wednesday -- because shaving annoys me. A couple weeks ago, I let my time between shaving days go a little too long, and I had a full-fledged beard going. Caramel was at first a bit put off, but then found out that my beard was really soft (because I&apos;m just cool that way).

She thus demanded, in no uncertain terms, that I grow a full beard. Well, okie, I&apos;ve done it before, and less shaving for me!

So we continued life for another week or so until yesterday, when Caramel looks at me and says I look&quot;kinda evil&quot;with the beard, and it needs to go. I asked her what I should do with it, and she said she didn&apos;t care.

Heh.

Understandably, I was a bit frustrated by feeling like I was my wife&apos;s pet hair doll or something, and I felt the need to make a statement.

So this morning, I did indeed do something to my beard. I shaved it in the classic Civil War Burnside style, like so, only not nearly as bushy .

I think she about went into shock when she saw me. Admittedly, I now look like a slightly violent redneck, but it got the point across that she won&apos;t be telling me how to style my hair any more, and I&apos;ll go back to normal tomorrow.

But today! I&apos;m living it up! Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

So today I was chatting with my son&apos;s teacher and she tells me he&apos;s been doing great the past few weeks... except....
Except what? I ask.

It seems that yesterday, the class (he goes to a charter school) was visited by no less than the Senate Majority Leader for the state of Wisconsin. Said politician spent some time chatting about this and that, and somehow the subject of duck hunting came up. Mr. Senator has recently tried duck hunting and just hasn&apos;t had much luck and doesn&apos;t know why.

Spawn of Mutant 1 raises his hand and says,&quot;Maybe it&apos;s because you never stop talking.&quot;

This may not be as funny if you weren&apos;t there and couldn&apos;t hear the inflection, but good Lord... funniest thing I&apos;ve heard all month, easy.

So Lady Luck comes home after a hard day of work and grad school classes at 10:00. My friend and I are getting in the Hallowe&apos;en spirit by watching Teen Wolf, but he leaves and L.L. grabs some leftover nachos, a glass of the terrific wine Lissa and Duckie gave us as a housewarming gift this weekend (thanks again, guys!), and plops down beside me on the floor. I unpause the movie, which just happens to be at the dance scene, and we idly discuss the atrocious fashion and musical choices for a while. Then the following exchange occurs, re: Scott, the main character...

 Me:&quot;Look at how scrawny he looks. You should see him in his basketball uniform.&quot;
Lady Luck:&quot;Oh man, his nose looks sorta funny too. He kind of looks like Michael J. Fox though, doesn&apos;t he?&quot;
Me [gaping in disbelief]:&quot;.....&quot;
Lady Luck [wincing]:&quot;He IS Michael J. Fox, isn&apos;t he?&quot;
Me: [laughter to the point of choking] 

It was just one of those moments where someone says something stupid and realizes a millisecond later -- by the outrageous guffaws you&apos;re trying vainly to supress -- just how inane it is. I don&apos;t know, maybe you had to be there to see the flash of comprehension on her face or the instant reddening, but... heh heh. Classic.

Then the second, slightly less funny moment occured just minutes later, when Chubb entered the picture and Lady Luck commented on his, well, chubbiness.

 Me:&quot;He kind of looks like a younger John Goodman.&quot;
Lady Luck:&quot;YEAH HE DOES!!!&quot; 

(I mean, yes, he does, but... damn, was that enthusiastic!)

Then we both had a hearty laugh about the guy with his underwear showing in the end and called it a night. It&apos;s the little moments that I love the best.

I was at a conference in Houston last week, and a bunch of us went out to a bar with a couple of our professors. Some of the guys wanted to talk with the girls from Rice University a few tables over, so one of them snagged a towel from the bar and started acting like a waiter for the girls. He took drink orders and everything. Had them completely fooled. Then one of our professors walked over to him, slapped him on the back of the head, and said,&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting for my beer for 20 minutes, and here I find you chatting up these girls?!

I was over at a friend&apos;s house the other day. My friend&apos;s thirteen-year-old daughter was there, telling us a couple of knock-knock jokes. My buddy pipes up:

&quot;HEY!!! Wanna hear the funniest knock-knock joke ever?&quot;

His daughter replies,&quot;Sure!&quot;

&quot;Okay, but you have to start it for me! Say &apos;Knock Knock&apos;!&quot;

&quot;Ummmm, okay. Knock Knock.&quot;

&quot;Well I played it at my friend&apos;s house, but it has one of those words in it.&quot;
&quot;Those words?&quot;
&quot;Y&apos;know, one that you told me I shouldn&apos;t ever say.&quot;
Curious, since this isn&apos;t a game I would have connected with profanity, I ask,&quot;Which word specifically?&quot;

FACTS ABOUT CHUCK NORRIS:

Chuck Norris&apos;s tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried.

Chuck Norris recently had the idea to sell his urine as a canned beverage. We know this beverage as Red Bull.

Rather than being birthed like a normal child, Chuck Norris instead decided to punch his way out of his mother&apos;s womb. Shortly thereafter he grew gigantic biceps.

Chuck Norris is responsible for 12 gold records and six academy award winning movies. He never goes to the award shows, however, because he finds Hollywood to be beneath him. Which it is.

The original theme song to the Transformers was actually&quot;Chuck Norris -- more than meets the eye, Chuck Norris -- robot in disguise,&quot;and starred Chuck as a sarcastic comic book fan/crimefighter who defended the earth from drug-dealing Decepticons and could turn into a Delorean. This was far too much awesome for a single show, however, so it was divided.

Chuck Norris was the fourth wise man. He brought baby Jesus the gift of&quot;hardcore awesomeness.&quot;Jesus wore it proudly to His dying day. The other wise men, jealous of Jesus&apos; obvious gift favoritism, used their combined influence to have Chuck omitted from the Bible. Shortly thereafter, all three died of roundhouse kick-related deaths.

To prove it isn&apos;t that big of a deal to beat cancer, Chuck Norris smoked 15 cartons of cigarettes a day for 2 years and acquired 7 different kinds of cancer, only to rid them from his body by flexing for 30 minutes. Beat that, Lance Armstrong.

Chuck Norris once shot a German plane down with his finger by yelling,&quot;Bang!&quot;

Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet, until Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked her into a glacier.

Chuck Norris frequently signs up for beginner karate classes, just so he can&quot;accidentally&quot;beat the crap out of little kids.

Chuck Norris will take your virginity. If you&apos;re thinking to yourself,&quot;That&apos;s impossible, I already lost my virginity,&quot;then you are dead wrong.

Chuck Norris can make any woman and most men climax by simply pointing at them and saying&quot;booyah.&quot;

When Chuck Norris plays Oregon Trail, his family does not die from cholera or dysentery, but rather roundhouse kicks to the face. He also requires no wagon, since he carries the oxen, axles, and buffalo
meat on his back. He always makes it to Oregon before you.

Chuck Norris sold his soul to the devil for his masculine good looks and unparalleled martial arts ability. Shortly after the transaction was finalized, Chuck roundhouse kicked the devil in the face and took his soul back. The devil, who appreciates irony, couldn&apos;t stay mad and admitted he should have seen it coming. They now play poker every second Wednesday of the month.

Chuck Norris replaced Angel for one scene and nobody noticed.

Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.

Upon viewing your CD and record collection, Chuck Norris will not only laugh at you, but the laughter will cause your eyes to bleed. Once blinded by this, he will roundhouse kick you and you will thank him for it and mean it.

Chuck Norris has every copy of National Geographic in his basement. He also has the ability to lift every single one of them at once.

Chuck Norris once tried to sue Burger King after they refused to put razor wire in his Whopper Jr., insisting that that actually is&quot;his way.&quot;

Chuck Norris ruins the endings of Harry Potter books for children just for the heck of it. When they start crying, Chuck calmly says,&quot;I&apos;ll give you something to cry about&quot;and roundhouse kicks them in the face.

Chuck Norris once went to a fraternity party, and proceeded to roundhouse every popped collar in sight. He then drank three kegs, chided their musical tastes, and pooped on their floor, just because he&apos;s Chuck Norris.

Chuck Norris doesn&apos;t have normal white blood cells like you and I. His have a small black ring around them. This signifies that they are black belts in every form of martial arts and they roundhouse kick the crap out of viruses. That&apos;s why Chuck never gets ill.

If you can see Chuck Norris, he can see you. If you can&apos;t see Chuck Norris, you may be only seconds away from death.

The chief export of Chuck Norris is pain.

It&apos;s at this point, in her showing-me-the-plates-tour, that she turns the plate over. In big bold letters:

The ones I look at the backs/covers of go more like this:

CAPTIVE OF PASSION

Clarissa was a lonely child of rich parents, sought by many, loved by few. Then she found herself a prisoner of the Sheik of Bangamor - a man known for his dark secrets and hidden passions. Now will she find escape - or a throbbing passion greater than any she has ever known? Feel your pulse quicken as you find out in this incredibly passionate novel by Barbara Valerie St. John, author of&quot;Prisoner of Lust.&quot;

This being the kind you get on those Zebra/Harlequin ones with the woman leaning back in a very uncomfortable position while the man holds her against his hairy chest and leans toward her heaving bosom.

Yeah, there are the&quot;softer&quot;and more&quot;hardcore&quot;romance novels, apparently. The softer ones can be identified by one or more of the following on the cover/back:

* The word&quot;wedding&quot;
* The word&quot;bride&quot;, often preceeded by the word&quot;reluctant&quot;
* A baby. Babies are freaking EVERYWHERE in these books.
* Italian anybodies.
* The word&quot;daddy&quot;

I used to amuse myself and Siblings 1 and 2 while I was in college by trooping down to my local Borders and writing down the funnier romance titles. Apparently some people will buy anything if it suggests it contains a man who is rich, foreign or ideally both. Actual titles from memory:

In the Spaniard&apos;s Bed
The Billionaire&apos;s Bride
Sleeping with the Sheik
The Italian Count&apos;s Lover

No doubt coming soon:

I Married an Al Qaeda Operative
The Sultan of Brunei&apos;s New Mistress
Loving Prince Charles
El Presidente&apos;s Baby Affair

The twin stories always bugged me. Like, even though they&apos;re complete opposites no one EVER figures it out, and even though they&apos;re in their 20s/30s, they still wear their hair the same and are the same weight.

Except boy and girl twins. You can&apos;t even tell they&apos;re related.

Am I the only one who finds the idea of sleeping with someone while pretending to be your sister creepy? Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Caramel and I were on a shuttle from our hotel that went to the casino in Canada (penny slots RULE), and these three middle-aged, large guys board.

They are drunk. Really, really drunk.

And they are loud. Really, really loud.

And they are horny. Really, really horny.

Now, not trying to sound stuck up or anything, but I honestly haven&apos;t spent a lot of my life around drunk people, so I kind of find them fascinating in a horrible way when I witness them. This trio might&apos;ve been the pentultimate drunk idiots in the world, with very little exaggeration.

Everyone on this shuttle was thinking dirty thoughts aimed at them as these three couldn&apos;t stop shouting and yelling and -- most importantly -- hooting like nincompoops at anything female with breasts.

One of the guys actually wolf whistled at a girl getting off the bus. Another guy saw a girl in the street and boomed,&quot;DRIVER! BACK UP! WOOOOOO! WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!&quot;

Caramel leans over and murmurs,&quot;Yes, and if she had a look at these, she&apos;d be off and running in .5 seconds flat.&quot;

I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m typing this... it wasn&apos;t that funny and I&apos;m not giving great quotes, but it just stunned us that people could be this drunk, this idiotic, and this -basic- all at the same time. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

This one comes from Sibling 1, an architecture major at WSU. I should start by explaining that she has this shirt she made with three little podlike one-eye-stalked aliens on it.

She was in an animation lab and discussing a project with her partner when he pointed to her chest and said,&quot;Hey, you should animate those!&quot;

He quickly added,&quot;the little one-eyed aliens!&quot;

Fortunately, she understood what he meant.

Yeah, religion and Da Vinci Code stuff is always bound to bring out a heated discussion, but I thought this was (from my perspective) not just true but pretty funny enough to pass on. From a blog entry I read today:

Is it possible to put all this aside and just enjoy the story as a thriller, an enjoyable yarn? I honestly have no idea how people can take that approach.

Catholic writer Mark Shea tells an anecdote about a college bull session among students at Central Washington University over The Da Vinci Code. Even if its just fiction, a student opined, its still interesting to think about.

To which another student replied: Your mothers a [prostitute]. And then, to the first students stunned incredulity, he added, And even if thats just fiction, its still interesting to think about. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

There is going to be a bit of exposition to explain this quote, but I work in a toy store. In this store, we sell little rubber chickens whose sole purpose is to amuse all by laying a rubber egg when squeezed. So, one day, a little boy and his father comes in and the boy starts playing with the chicken. Only half interested, the father asks the boy:&quot;What came first, the chicken or the egg?&quot;

Without blinking, the little boy said:&quot;The chicken.&quot;

&quot;Why the chicken?&quot;asks the father.

Then, in the most deadpan, &apos;I-know-this-for-a-fact&apos; way, the child said:&quot;Because God doesn&apos;t lay eggs.&quot;

The following was written by Warren Ellis, an extremely talented (if sometimes insufferable) comics writer known for his... let&apos;s say eccentric approach to superheroes.

*********

 It occurs to me that an awful lot of trouble in Gotham City could have been averted a long time ago if Batman had just ripped the Jokers nipples off.

I mean, treatment doesnt work, does it? They stick the Joker in the nuthatch, he comes out again and does the same things.

A man with the nipples ripped off him does not make the same mistakes twice.

Criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot, and need the nipples ripped off them.

I mean, whos going to argue?

Batman, Ive heard disturbing reports that you ripped the Jokers nipples off.

Choke on [censored], Commissioner Gordon.

okay.

I mean, crime in Gotham City doesnt exactly seem to be affected by a man dressed as a bat flapping around the place. But no one disobeys a man wearing a necklace of human nipples.

Im Batman isnt cutting it in the striking-fear-into-their-hearts stakes. But Im Batman and Im here for your nipples is an entirely different proposition.

Criminals would see the error of their ways after a man in a black leather pervert suit had their nipples off with the edge of a Batarang, you mark my words. Or a Bat-Denipplizer.

Im off to ring DC Comics.

Front page of the news site had this article linked:

&quot;Hotel Porn Gets Conservative Activists Hot and Bothered&quot;

However, due to the space in the column, it was broken up into two lines, which completely changed how I read the title:

&quot;Hotel Porn Gets Conservative
Activists Hot and Bothered&quot;

At least I found this amusing... Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Last night, as we began watching the Simpsons episode Brother From Another Series , featuring Sideshow Bob&apos;s brother Cecil-

Me: You know, I just think it&apos;s so cool how they got David Hyde Pierce to do the voice of his brother... such an inspired casting choice, you know?
Lady Luck: Huh? Oh, yeah... definitely. Really neat.

[15 minutes later]

Lady Luck: Wait, wait, hold on- the guy who does Sideshow Bob&apos;s voice... is that the guy from Frasier ?
Me: ............


I&apos;m prepared to argue strongly for this being the funniest thing ever uttered by a human being. But maybe you had to be there.

Some things get funnier from a distance. Like the following things my bus driver said very loudly this afternoon:

&quot;Oh, [censored] !&quot;
&quot;Think, man, think!&quot;
&quot;Don&apos;t look! Seriously, don&apos;t look!&quot;

Don&apos;t people have any internal editors or anything? Particularly when they are driving a bus full of increasingly nervous university students? Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2) 
Post by poolman on Sept 14, 2006, 8:52pm

I once, and I swear upon Justin&apos;s beard this is true, got on a bus when I was a teen coming home from my girlfriend&apos;s house. It was late, probably the last bus of the night, and it was really dark out. I was with a buddy coming back with me, and we got on the empty bus and went all the way to the back.

Well, the driver was on a few minutes&apos; stop to match up the schedule, so he powered down the bus while we waited, and started reading a book. Meanwhile, my friend and I, on a mostly dark and empty bus, just started tapping. Tapping. Hitting the seats. Stomping a bit...

We weren&apos;t trying to be obnoxious, we were just having fun doing this little rhythmical thing that just spontaneously grew out of nothing, without speech. We WERE Stomp for just a moment in time. It was great fun.

Suddenly the driver leaps up out of his seat, wheels around towards us, and snarls&quot;If you little f***ers don&apos;t stop that RIGHT F***ING now, I&apos;ll tear your arms off and stuff &apos;em up your A**ES!&quot;.

Well, colour us stunned.

We just stopped. Mid hit. Hands and feet still in the air, ready to strike a next beat that would never come. We just stared, jaws agape at this guy. We turned to look at each other and calmly, without a word, without fear, stood up and got off the bus.

The driver, sensing repercussions (seeing as all the buses are numbered, so it&apos;d be EASY to report him) immediately begged us to get back on, and apologized. We didn&apos;t even look back. Just walked on home.

So maybe this belongs under the heading&quot;A Threatening Thing I Heard Fifteen Years Ago&quot;. Sorry. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Ever done it twice in the same week?

Last weekend while visiting my nephews and niece, Caramel and I brought presents for them. Charlie, my almost-3-year-old nephew, was blown away by 99-cent toys that arrived in abundance and was jittering in pure joy. Then he saw the next present (I think it was bubbles) and he uttered,

&quot;OH MY GRACIOUS!&quot;

To hear this come from the mouth of a toddler is by far one of the most hilarious things I&apos;ve ever heard. We&apos;re wondering if he&apos;s channeling the spirit of a 62-year-old lady in there.

==================

Prepare for a stupid pun. So I&apos;m talking with some folks online, and we&apos;re having an intense discussion revolving around squirrels (of course).

For the past few months I&apos;ve been in the employ of that mega corporation that everybody loves to hate, Wal-Mart. Needless to say, I&apos;ve been witness to many odd/spectacular/just plain gross/hilarious things. One of the more interesting things I&apos;ve been a witness to happened just the other day. Sorry if it seems crude, but it is Wal-Mart, afterall.

I was finished my shift, and was picking up a couple of snacks. So, I pick up a package of licorice and was just walking away when I overheard a couple who were talking.

Guy:&quot;So, when&apos;s she supposed to have the baby?&quot;
Gal:&quot;She already had the baby, and it had chlamydia because she&apos;s a dirty b****!&quot;

I completely froze when I heard this. It was either that, or I&apos;d bust out laughing. I opted for the former.

The other day I was driving my kids to their Dad&apos;s house and stopped the car on a country road.
Me: Look in the tree there!
Daughter: Oooh, a bald eagle! (Tis true. We get them out here in the winter.)
Me: There&apos;s good eatin&apos; on one of those.
*Long, shocked silence in the back of the car*
Me: What&apos;s the big deal? They taste just like Blue Heron!

I bought both of Mitch Hedberg&apos;s comedy CDs -- hilarious stuff, an absolute must-listen -- and particularly enjoyed this joke:


When you go to a restaurant on the weekends and it&apos;s busy so they start a waiting list, they say,&quot;Dufresne, party of two, table ready for Dufresne, party of two.&quot;And if no one answers they&apos;ll say the name again:&quot;Dufresne, party of two.&quot;But then if no one answers, they&apos;ll move on to the next name.&quot;Bush party of three.&quot;Yeah, but what happened to the Dufresnes? No one seems to care. Who can eat at a time like this? People are missing. You people are selfish. The Dufresnes are in someone&apos;s trunk right now, with duct tape over their mouths. And they&apos;re hungry. That&apos;s a double whammy. We need help.&quot;Bush, search party of three. You can eat once you find the Dufresnes.&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course they will. It&apos;ll be like a giant meadow with green grass to turf up and warm breezes to keep them comfortable, and sofas all over for sleeping on, and lots of bunnies to chase-&quot;

&quot;That doesn&apos;t sound very nice for the bunnies!&quot;

&quot;Well sweetie, greyhound heaven is where bad bunnies go.

&quot;So it&apos;s... bunny hell?&quot;

&quot;Yep. &apos;Fraid so.&quot;

&quot;Well... what about bad greyhounds?&quot;

&quot;Oh, if there were any, they&apos;d go to bunny heaven.&quot;

Justin- My Husband used to be the youth pastor at our church and, quite frequently, people who called on the phone asked him to speak to&quot;a real pastor,&quot;&quot;someone more important,&quot;and a few times&quot;anyone else.&quot;Mind you, Husband has an MDiv and the &apos;real pastor&apos; was ordained sometime when dinosaurs roamed the earth, so he actually doesn&apos;t even have a Masters degree. Ironically (or not) the reason Husband had to quit this gig was because he was making about a third of what the janitor made, and needed to find a full time job.

Yeah, I&apos;ve gotten the&quot;so, when are you going to become a real pastor?&quot;line often enough that I rebut with,&quot;Only when enough children watching me in a movie theater clap and my fairy godmother hears it.&quot;

I suppose that&apos;s why a lot of churches call their youth pastors&quot;directors&quot;or somesuch. Doesn&apos;t matter to me, much. I do suspect that my pastor is secretly trying to groom me to eventually take over his position, which is why I start out each week telling him why adult ministry is the pits. It&apos;s good for his self-esteem, too. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

A conversation between a co-worker and I earlier this week, complaining about a new work procedure:

CW: I can&apos;t believe this. It&apos;s like we&apos;re stuck in a horror movie or something.

Me: Yep. A bad one. On endless loop.

CW: We should fire the director and get a new one.

Me: Yep. *pause* Get that guy from Chicago. Because darn it, we need more Richard Gere tap-dancing numbers!

Then at that very moment, my silver-haired boss walks by, stops, looks at us, then breaks into a mini tap-dance. I was giggling for the rest of the day. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Aside: I work in a drive-through liquor store (I know!), and sometimes people tip us. Last night a guy&apos;s change was $4.90. He told us to keep it, started to drive away, then changed his mind and started backing up . Who backs up in a drive through?!?!? He&apos;d decided that it was too much and wanted his $4 back, ignoring the fact that the woman behind him had naturally started to pull forward. My co-worker&apos;s leaning out the window, yelling at him to stop . . . Finally stopped about 20 cm away from the next vehicle&apos;s front bumper. And now I can feel my blood pressure going up.

Do you happen to live anywhere near a powerplant??? I went to college near one (fun times!) and because of the massive amounts of steam that got released from the cooling towers the local area was plagued with some pretty serious mold/fungi issues. There was no real impact on me (that I&apos;ve noticed... yet...) except that the mold was killer on my allergies, but the doctor actually told me that the mold in the area was directly linked to the powerplant. In any event- maybe it&apos;s something they put in there for folks who live within a certain distance of one and doesn&apos;t really pertain to you? here&apos;s hoping!

So me charming wife has declared that we are using&quot;too much electricity&quot;, which, for you guys out there, translates to&quot;she&apos;s gonna stalk you from room to room, turning out the lights the second your foot leaves that room&apos;s boundaries.&quot;

Day one, and it&apos;s getting a bit annoying, as the bruises on my shin from bumping into household furniture attest. I&apos;m sick of finding myself shrouded in inky blackness, where my only hope is to curl up in a ball and hope against hope that the Boogeyman is elsewhere for the evening.

So I decide to be proactive, and declare to her that we should go the full hog and just get rid of all our light bulbs forever. Screw Thomas Edison; the Olivettis are going high tech:

&quot;We&apos;ll just invest in a couple pairs of night vision goggles,&quot;I suggest in earnest.&quot;Those suckers only run on AAs, and if any burglars come in, we&apos;ll have the drop on them!&quot; Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2) 
Post by coccatino on Aug 10, 2007, 8:21am

Justin- 1. switch to compact flourescent bulbs. They cost more, but they last longer, and use less electricity. So long term- they save money.
2. unplug things that you aren&apos;t using. Particularly things like cell phone chargers or powerstrips that aren&apos;t in use- chargers use the same amount of electricity when they are plugged in whether they are actually charging anything or not. I always left mine pliugged in until i found this out. Also- TVs suck energy even when they are off, so if you have one that doesn&apos;t get used as often (we have one in our kitchen that we barely watch) leave it unplugged until you&apos;re actually about to watch it.
We made these changes at my house and our bill is seriously almost $20 less a month. I was shocked. And Husband leaves the lights on constantly, still. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Maybe I&apos;m the only one who&apos;ll find this funny, maybe you had to be there, but boy, I just had the laugh of a lifetime. Sorry for the long writeup, but I think it&apos;s worth it.

I decided to walk into downtown Milwaukee this morning for breakfast. There&apos;s a 50&apos;s style diner (called the Michigan St Diner) that I&apos;ve gone by dozens of times and have been meaning to go into, and there&apos;s nobody around right now, so I thought I&apos;d go down and check it out.

Inside, it really is a mockup of a classic 50&apos;s diner. Red bar stools, black and white tiles everywhere, the older style sugar and napkin dispensers.... it looks like something out of Happy Days. There&apos;s even these statues of Elvis and Marilyn Monroe in the window... kinda cheesy, but fun.

So I walk in, sit down, and start reading a paper. Across from me there&apos;s this cute lil&apos; old grandpa with two young grandsons, probably both younger than 8. It almost looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting. This friendly but worn looking grandfather flanked by these two young boys, all out on a Saturday morning to have breakfast together. I mean, I almost wanted to take a picture.

My breakfast comes after a while, and while I&apos;m eating and reading, I&apos;m keeping half an ear on what the kids and granddad are saying to each other. Mostly it&apos;s the elder reminiscing about his younger days, and the kids adding goofy little tidbits here and there.

Suddenly, one of the boys looks up from his breakfast and says,&quot;Granddad, these eggs make me burp&quot;. Granddad, without missing a beat, looks over at him, and with all the wear of his years and gentle strains on his patience showing, sighs, and says:

&quot; Everything makes you burp&quot;.

Well, anyone who knows me knows what happens next. I absolutely bust a gut laughing at this. I mean, I couldn&apos;t hide it if I tried. The granddad looks over at me, and he starts cracking up too. He said something like&quot;I&apos;m serious, you should have heard this kid in the car on the way over!&quot;. Which of course gets another laugh out of me.

I swear, if I go hide in my room and don&apos;t see another soul all day, I&apos;ll still go to bed happy that I heard the funniest thing ever today. Good laugh, indeed. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

As far as funny gym stuff goes:

When we got finished burning all those calories she would take me to Del Taco (Imagine Taco Bell, but actually GOOD) and order the one pound burrito and fries. Buh?????

2. I have actually got finished doing a good work out and had a cigarrette outside when I was finished. When I was in the Army those last few months I would finish running 3-4 miles and then have a smoke afterwards. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Not only can you get some very good, very independent music from them, but I got a real kick out of the automated email they sent to let me know that my order had been shipped. Along with a receipt for my order came this message:

 &quot;Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with
sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.

A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make
sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing.

Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over
the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that money
can buy.

We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
Portland waved&quot;Bon Voyage!&quot;to your package, on its way to you, in
our private CD Baby jet on this day, Tuesday, September 25th.

I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did.
Your picture is on our wall as&quot;Customer of the Year.&quot;We&apos;re all

After the many, many letters flowed in demanding he be fired, he wrote in his next column that he was very sorry, and would never have written such things if he knew beer drinkers could read.

A man who I DO NOT KNOW who works in my office building and commonly makes odd chit chat in the elevators and throughout my pregnancy asked me very awkward and invasive questions a lot and who, apparently, has not seen me since my return from maternity leave, just walked up to me in the hall, put his hand on my stomach and said &quot;awww, it&apos;s flat! No more baby!&quot; He walked away as if this were a normal thing to do before I had time to even process the event and respond.
I feel violated. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Or you could try finding out where he works and reporting him for sexual harassment. I&apos;m not sure which I&apos;d go with, under the circumstances. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

I think it&apos;s just generally creepy for anyone to feel a pregnant woman&apos;s stomach unless they are related to said woman. In which case it&apos;s not only okay to feel for kicks, but also to draw a hemisphere of continents on her belly with a sharpie.

But seriously, that&apos;s just not right. I had a little Japanese kid come up to me in Kyoto and stick his finger into my butt crack, and I needed serious counseling afterward. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

That kind of stuff, the worst that&apos;s ever happened to me:

I had tagged along as moral support to a doctor&apos;s visit, but we had to wait for the office to open from their lunch hour. We were talking and minding our own business. This woman comes down the hallway, looks at me, and walks past, so my back is to her.

Then I feel this hand on my shoulder and, as I turn around, the woman is like smelling my head,&quot;You smell warm and sweet. What perfume are you wearing?&quot;Two inches from my face.

I&apos;m in total shock, and it&apos;s a narrow hallway, in a medical building - what if the chick&apos;s crazy?&quot;I&apos;m... not wearing any perfume.&quot;She shrugs and walks off. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

So last night, the spawn and I are sitting around a table at the fast food restaurant establishment of our choice, and my son--bless his heart--is regaling us with his usual stream-of-consciousness monologue. At one point, he starts a sentence thusly:&quot;And one time...&quot;
&quot;At band camp,&quot;I interject reflexively.

My daughter, my sweet 14 year old unspoiled daughter&apos;s head snaps around and she blurts,&quot;American Pie?! You&apos;ve seen American Pie?!&quot;

Equally startled, I stare at her.&quot;Have you ???&quot;

&quot;I can&apos;t believe you watched that!&quot;she gasps.
&quot;I can&apos;t believe you did!&quot;I gasp right back.
&quot;That&apos;s so wrong on so many levels! I mean, you&apos;re a Mom !&quot;

You know, one time, in a past life called High School, I had a co-op job at Lista. I made tool cabinets. It was the most boring and mind-numbingly dumb job I ever had, and I hated it.

I usually played my gameboy at lunch. One time (at band camp...), the guys I sat with called me up on it, saying it was rotting my brain. I said it&apos;s a strategy game, and thus enhancing my brain, plus hundreds of years ago they SAID books rot your brain and NOW people who read a dozen books a week are geniuses. They argued &apos;were you alive hundreds of years ago?&apos; I said &apos;Have you ever read any story set in or before the Dark Ages, SUCH AS DON QUIXOTE?!&apos; They said &apos;Once again, reading, rots your brain.&apos; They all ganged up on my example and backed behind the lead dumbass who brought up the point I wasn&apos;t alive back then. I&apos;m pretty sure I wasn&apos;t alive in World War II either, but I&apos;m always pretty sure IT HAPPENED.

Now I&apos;m a Mechanical Engineer with a starting salary of 63,000 a year out of school. They&apos;re still making tool cabinets. Who won that battle?

Okay, this isn&apos;t a quote, but it was pretty hilarious.

I woke up this morning, toddled over to my computer and started working on today&apos;s update, which was going to be Shalen&apos;s Conan the Barbarian review. I get all the pictures formatted, then go to open her Word document...

...which doesn&apos;t contain a review, per se, but her resume.

So that leaves me with a few questions:

(1) Am I a bad person for wanting to post that resume as her review?

(2) Is she trying to tell me that she&apos;s quitting MRFH?

(3) Should I mention her experience as an&quot;experienced dolphin and manta ray trainer&quot;? Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2) 
Post by spiderdancer on Apr 23, 2008, 1:51pm

&quot;This move was so bad I&apos;m quitting MRFH. And for some reason I&apos;m sending the resume to the boss I&apos;m quitting, not the folks I want to hire me.&quot;

Or maybe I&apos;ve just sent so many resumes in the last month and a half that it was instinctive. Looking for a decent job in the current labor market sucks. Please see blog entry, with direct quotes from hostile craiglist posters who don&apos;t want any inexperienced applicants and are not gentle about saying so:

Similarly, this past weekend I was playing Scrabble with my father-in-law, uncle-in-law, cousin-in-law, and her husband, and I realized that the most points I could conceivably get that turn would be to combine the&quot;A-N-G&quot;I had in my letters with a&quot;W&quot;that was already on the board.

Man: Never mind, what do you have on Ecuador? (My thoughts: Nothing. At this point, my mind just has static.)
Can you guys make any sense of this? Because this was a couple years ago and I still don&apos;t get it. Apart from being on the Planet Earth, what do Siberia and Ecuador have in common? Help, please?

 Strawberry Gush (Coming Soon!)
Bite into a Strawberry Gush Glop and a sudden burst of liquid strawberry flavor gushes into your mouth from all directions. Drench your mouth with butt-loads of intense strawberry flavor. 

I stared at the screen, re-read it a few times and was absolutely speechless. Finally, noticing my state of suspended animation, my boss ambled over, read the screen, thought a moment, then said,&quot;Butt-loads of intense strawberry flavor? Butt-loads? &quot;

I couldn&apos;t stop laughing.

no lie, I just had the following conversation with my 28 year old sister

her: what&apos;s a square foot?
me: seriously?
her: yeah, like how do you figure out the square footage of a room that&apos;s 20ft times 30ft (please note, these were her exact words, she said TIMES)
me: it&apos;s 600
her: how did you figure that out?
me: just like you said- 20 times 30 = 600
her: that&apos;s not right
me: yes it is
her: that&apos;s way too much
me: square footage is area- the area of the room, which is the length multiplied by the width... so if the room is 20 feet across and 30 feet wide, the area is 600 square feet.
her: whatever, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s right. bye.


these are the kinds of things that she feels the need to call me AT WORK with during the day. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Yeah, my sister almost named her son Austin Scott something that starts with S. Luckily for him she changed it to Nelson. I thank the powers that be that my mother didn&apos;t give me a middle name starting with&quot;I&quot;, as my maiden initials would have been HIV. Oh I shudder to think.

I heard a lot of bad/strange things in school. We had a Sandy Dick (the parents needed to be tied up and whipped for that), and a Galaxy Sinkhorn among others. But hands down I have never, and will never see a name to beat the name of a guy my husband went to A School with in Great Lakes.

This might be more of a&quot;you had to be there&quot;situation, but it was just too bizarre to not mention.

Tonight my wife takes me out to Outback Steakhouse to celebrate the end of the semester (aced that final!), and we get this PoolMan-looking waiter at our table.

He&apos;s a little friendly.

A little... too friendly.

You ever have one of those waiters who seems desperate for human connection, who wants to make everyone love them, and who has to chat at least for three minutes every time they come to the table? Yeah, that was this guy. Seriously, he had to comment on EVERYTHING.

&quot;You want water to wet your whistle? Sure thing, pardner!&quot;

&quot;Oh look at it out there. Is that snow? I think it&apos;s snow. You guys better be careful driving back! Don&apos;t slip and slide, is what I&apos;m saying!&quot;

When I was done eating:&quot;Hey, you didn&apos;t eat all your green beans? Were they not good? Are you ducking your veggies, well, are you? Heh heh, what do you think little lady? Bad hubby, huh?&quot;

And at least three times while eating we&apos;d look up and he&apos;d be standing there, staring and smiling at us like a serial killer in an alleyway. My wife knew I was just about ready to throw myself at him for how insanely annoying he was being -- really, much like that hyper waiter in Office Space -- but I held back somehow.

I know I&apos;m not doing a good job with this story, but really... I&apos;ve just never had a waiter be that personally intrusive and obnoxious.

At the end, my wife asks me,&quot;Should we talk to a manager? That guys was way too intense.&quot;I said no, and as we walked out, we heard an employee call him&quot;Manager Eddie&quot;.

The moral of this story: managers are creepy and are possibly alien infested. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

I&apos;m going to share with you guys something that&apos;s just to bizarre to keep to myself, but since it&apos;s an inter-office memo of my wife&apos;s company, I&apos;m summing it up without names.

So a month ago, my wife tells me that a guy at their Cleveland branch died in a car accident -- this guy was apparently well-liked, and my wife&apos;s boss was broken up about this, crying at her desk when she heard the news.

Today, the vice president of the company sends an e-mail to say, in effect:

1. The guy&apos;s wife informed the company as to his death on Thanksgiving.

2. The company sent out an e-mail to all its employees in a tri-state area letting them know this.

3. The company looked for an obituary notice or article about the car accident and couldn&apos;t find any of those things.

4. They hired a private investigator to check it out -- it turns out there was no accident. The company kept thinking that maybe the guy died under different circumstances, although reports from the guy&apos;s neighbors said that they saw him shoveling snow a couple days ago.

5. A former employer of this guy went over to the guy&apos;s house to express condolences to his family, when the guy answered the door, told him to leave and slammed the door in his face.

6. The company is now telling employees to stay the heck away from this guy, as he and his wife are obviously disturbed in some way.

I just thought that was incredible... a guy faked his death, and badly, to get out of work or something. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

So yesterday my fiesty 96 year-old grandmother (who has clogged arteries and a bad heart anyway) had to have surgery on her leg, which she broke on Sunday. My grammy, normally a sweet little lady that bakes treats and watches her&quot;stories&quot;all day will, once in the hospital, berate whoever is within earshot to the point that they will pray for a quick and merciful end.

My mom called today after having stayed overnight with her in the hospital to tell me how she has been doing. The conversation then something like this:

Mom: Yeah she&apos;s doing real good. Started breathing on her own right after the surgery and the doctors are really impressed, since she&apos;s in pretty bad health these days.

Me: Is she raising Cain yet?

Mom (without even a pause): Oh yeah she&apos;s mad. Already trying to talk her way out of the hospital, even though her leg&apos;s in a cast and hanging up in the air. She was fussing at me, saying she needed to get back home and cook the food in her fridge before it&quot;rurns&quot;. I feel sorry for Priscilla&quot;. [my aunt whose turn it is to stay with grandma]

Me: Oh wow she is feeling good, then.

Then Mom went on to tell me about a conversation between her and grandma&apos;s doctor that went something like this:

Doctor:&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have operated on her if it wasn&apos;t absolutely necessary. Her heart is in such bad condition I was afraid she might not make it. I can&apos;t believe another doctor tried to talk her into heart surgery last year. It would be way too risky. The children made the right decision not to go through with it.

Grandma, from across the room:&quot;Ain&apos;t nobody a-gonna touch my heart, neither!&quot;

Mom: It wasn&apos;t our decision.

Hubby:&quot;How many out of ten US residents died at 60 years old in 1999?&quot;

Me:&quot;Uh........3?&quot;

Hubby:&quot;No, it&apos;s 8. Wow.&quot;

Compliments of the day,

I am Attorney Pete Balmer,of the Ami Feder Chambers United British Kingdom.This mail is written and intended to solicit your assistance to be presented as NEXT OF KIN to my Late Client Dr Paul Poolman .

My Deceased Client Dr Paul Poolman , Left a Deposit of Funds amounting to US $ 8,000,000.00 (Eight Million us Dollars Only) with the bank and unfortunately lost his life in a fatal accident sparing none of their lives some years ago with no clear beneficiary as Next of Kin except some vital documents related to the Deposit which is still in my possession. The Governing Body of the bank has contacted me on this matter and I am yet to provide the Next of Kin to lay claims to the Fund. Under a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as the Next of Kin so that my late Clients&apos; Fund will not be confiscated by the bank. For the sake of transparency on this matter, you are free to make immediate contact to me for further information details related to this matter.Thank you so much for your anticipated acceptance while I expect your prompt
response.

Best Regards,
Pete Balmer Esq.
 
 

I am soooooooo tempted to write back and play dumb.&quot;Wow, even though my name is Poole, Dr Poolman named me as his Next of Kin? How do I cash in on this absurd coincidence?&quot;

I actually did try it... and I&apos;ve gotten about 12 emails from Apple trying to sell me iPods and iMacs and all manner of Apply stuff. But over the course of probably more than a year, that&apos;s not exactly a lot, and Apple is actually a pretty reputable company. I haven&apos;t had any inheritance offers or anything! So I&apos;m going to have to try another one.

I had a fun conversation with my family some time ago. One of my&quot;fake&quot;grandmas, Laura, (I love her to death) was baiting my brother into a debate about history. They both have very different views about stuff, so it&apos;s always amusing to listen to them talk. I was happily licking ice-cream, watching the two of them jabber, until I eventually zoned out. Later, Laura snapped me out of Lala land, and judging from the coming verbal exchange, they were still miffed at each other.

Laura: So Zach, what flavor ice cream are you eating?
Me: Lime-sherbet.
Brother: That stuff tastes stupid.
Laura: Tastes stupid? What kinda flavor is that? Exactly what duz&quot;stoooopid&quot;tastes like, hm?
Brother: I dunno. Hey Zach, lick Laura&apos;s face and see what stupid tastes like. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

So my wife and I are eating at a steakhouse the other night, and about midway through our meal we notice that our table has this rather large button affixed to the end of it. By the time our waiter came over, he sees me holding back my wife&apos;s hands, twitching toward it.

He sizes things up.&quot;You want to know what happens when you push the button, don&apos;t you?&quot;

&quot;YES.&quot;

He hits the button and stands back. Literally five seconds later, a guy just RUSHES out of the kitchen right for our table, stopping short when he saw the waiter.

&quot;They wanted to know what it did,&quot;the waiter said. The kitchen guy just rolled his eyes.

&quot;Does he sing? Like an oompa loompa?&quot;my wife asked. The kitchen guy went back to the kitchen.

Now, you CANNOT finish a meal at a table where there&apos;s a button that summons an instant kitchen guy and not feel the incredible pull of temptation to be slamming that thing every two seconds. We had a major in-booth wrestling match to keep hands away from the thing.

But on the way out... I&apos;m ashamed to say that we quickly hit the buttons on about four tables as we quickly walked away. The kitchen door exploded behind us. Re: A Funny Thing I Heard Today (pt 2)

Earlier this week I was in a bakery downtown Elsewhere. I was completely lost in thought, but in no hurry. I was the only customer and the two ladies who worked there were engrossed in a conversation. I just stared at the bread for a while.

I woke up when one of the ladies turned to me and said,&quot;Women, huh!&quot;From her tone, I inferred the conversation really must have been on the saucy side. I just mumbled something about not having eavesdropped, and she grinned,&quot;I don&apos;t believe you!&quot;I have no clue what they&apos;d been talking about.

A couple of hours later:

Interesting conversation Number 2: To set the scene, Ritchie has been diligently getting his uniform together, currently in the process of ironing said uniform after I spent a couple of hours sewing a patch on it for him:

Me: Woot! It&apos;s now 12:01 Eastern time. Payday! Oh and it&apos;s April 1st. April Fool&apos;s Day!

So my in-laws came over yesterday. While to some people this would be cause for concern, my in-laws are genuinely great and we love having them over. This particular visit, they brought boxes full of old toys. My mother-in-law used to teach young children, I think kindergarteners, so she has lots of old supplies that she&apos;s now passing on to us for Baby Luck and second kid. I go to the back of their SUV, grab a box, take a step toward the house... do a double take, and look back inside the trunk at the box labeled, exactly as written,&quot;ASS WOOD BLOCKS&quot;. i ask my father-in-law if there&apos;s something I should know; he looks, chuckles and tells me I&apos;ll have to ask his wife. So we bring the box inside, I set it down and turn to my mother-in-law and say,&quot;Do you mind my asking what that first word means?&quot;She looks at me blankly and replies,&quot;&apos;Assorted.&apos; Why?&quot;

Oh, to be that innocent. So if anyone needs blocks made of rare wood taken from the fabled ass tree, we&apos;ve got you covered.
