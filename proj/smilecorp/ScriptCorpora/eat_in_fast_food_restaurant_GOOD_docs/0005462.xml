Unusual Dining in Missouri
 
 Jefferson City, Mo.— When was the last time you stopped at a franchised fast-food restaurant? An hour ago? Yesterday? Did everyone in the car have the same thing they had last time, and the time before that? Don’t get me wrong; the drive-thru lanes of the world serve a good function, and they do a fine job of it. But—you knew there was a “but” coming—sometimes a major change of pace and atmosphere is needed. That’s where Missouri’s other, more interesting restaurants come in. Something different, out of the ordinary, is usually close by.

For starters, get off the ground and reach for the sky. Missouri’s two, rooftop, revolving restaurants give a whole new meaning to “dining with a view.” In downtown Kansas City, ride the elevator to Skies , on the 42nd floor of the Hyatt Regency Hotel . As it slowly revolves, guests are surrounded by 72 windows with continually changing sights of Kansas City. Across the state, at the Millennium Hotel in downtown St. Louis, the Top of the Riverfront offers mesmerizing views of the Gateway Arch, Mississippi River and Busch Stadium, from 28 floors above street level.

Back on the ground, but still very high up, the Blue Heron Restaurant , at the Lake of the Ozarks, sits on a towering bluff, with a 180-degree view of the lake below. Start your evening with a cocktail beside the pool, on the large outdoor patio at the edge of the bluff. From there, the sunsets are spectacular.

 Bothered by heights? Ok, let’s go the other way. How about eating inside a cave? Outside of Richland, the Cave Restaurant serves steaks, barbecue, seafood and Italian fare. Located beside the Gasconade River, eight miles north of I-44, at exit 150, this full-service restaurant is one-of-a-kind in Missouri. It is part of the Cave Resort , built in the early 1920s, which includes four cabins with full kitchenettes.

For an entirely different view of the Lake of the Ozarks, make reservations for Celebration Cruises , a luxurious 80-foor yacht offering restaurant-style lunch and dinner cruises; a children’s menu is available. Continuing the on-the-water theme, the 700-seat Showboat Branson Belle , on Table Rock Lake in Branson, treats guests to an unforgettable journey. Each two-hour lunch and dinner cruise includes live entertainment and a three-course meal. The Belle operates March-December.

Getting our feet back on solid ground, Missouri is home to numerous out-of-the-ordinary eateries. Since there are far too many to cover here, let’s talk about some of the shining examples many folks would call “unique.”

In the village of Arrow Rock , the J. Huston Tavern has been serving meals to travelers along the Santa Fe Trail since 1834. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the historic brick tavern boasts the original wood floors and maintains the flavor of the 1800s. The regular dinner menu includes steaks, seafood, and pasta. A rotating lunch menu includes sandwiches, salads, and pastas.

 Fritz’s Railroad Restaurant resides in Kansas City’s Crown Center shopping complex. At Fritz’s, you place your order, via telephone, from your booth. A server brings the drinks, but—here’s the unique part—the food is delivered by train, on the overhead track. A mechanical arm slides your order off of the train onto a platform above you, and then safely and easily lowers your food to your table.

 You might need to duck when you visit the home of the “throwed rolls,” Lambert’s Cafe , in Sikeston and Lambert’s II , in Ozark, just south of Springfield on the way to Branson. Yes, from across the room the waiter will (if you wish) throw you a delicious roll. This nationally famous eatery is known for generous portions and their“pass-arounds,”constantly brought to you by servers carrying pots of fried okra, fried potatoes, macaroni and tomatoes, black eyed peas, sorghum and honey; included free with any meal.

The Farmer’s Gastropub is a Springfield eatery dedicated to fresh, local, sustainable, and natural organic dining and drinking. The menu is dictated by the ingredients available from local farmers. The concept combines the traditions of an English pub (short for public house), with the science of gastronomy (the relationship between food and cooking): hence the name, Gastropub.
 
If the places like the Gastropub are your style, there are many farm-to-table restaurant choices in Missouri for the locavore (one who eats foods grown locally whenever possible). Bowood Farms’ Osage Café and Niche , both in St. Louis; Jones Heritage Farm and Market in Cape Girardeau; Justus Drugstore, a Restaurant in Smithville; Blue Bird Bistro in Kansas City; and The Clarksville Station Restaurant in Clarksville are just a few.

For a special treat, drive over to the Wheel Inn, 2103 S. Limit St. (Highway 65, across from the state fairgrounds), in Sedalia. This family diner has the look and feel of the 1960s, but the real attraction is their house specialty: the gooberburger. This delightful hamburger—a luscious taste sensation, believe it or not—consists of two seared beef patties (singles are available), topped with mayo, pickles, onion and warm peanut-butter sauce. Don’t knock it ‘til you try it—it’s yummo.

While we’re on the topic of unusual menu items, we can’t overlook the Candlestick Inn , perched on a bluff 300 feet above Lake Taneycomo, overlooking the fantastic Branson Landing shopping district. What’s so unusual, you ask? You can feast on Rack of French Elk, brisket of bison, grilled wagyu cattle, and wild boar sausage—there are plenty of“normal”menu items as well. The view from the back porch seating area is breathtaking.

 Fitz’s American Grill&amp;Bottling Works may be the only restaurant in America where you can watch a vintage root beer bottling line in operation while you enjoy your meal. The equipment, dating to the early 1940s, is easily viewed from the main dining room. Fitz’s, located on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis, serves a menu of hamburgers, pizza and pasta, sandwiches and wraps, salads and entrees. You can enjoy your meal indoors or on the patio.
 
On Old Highway 71, south of Joplin, stop in at the Undercliff Grill and Bar . This restaurant, which is in fact built under a cliff (the back of the room is the dirt and rock side of the hill) specializes in hand-cut steaks, burger baskets, nachos and a Philly cheese steak. You might say this spot is off the beaten path (five miles south of I-44, exit 11); but if you’re visiting the area, it’s a must.

Dine in a brothel? Why not. Lula Belle’s Restaurant , in the quaint river town of Hannibal, occupies a building that housed a brothel during the early 1900s. The restaurant offers a fine dining experience, known for exquisite gourmet food preparation and tantalizing wine selection. The upper rooms of the brothel have been converted into an upscale bed and breakfast inn.

In the Laclede’s Landing district, along the Mississippi River in St. Louis, The Royal Dumpe transports you to 16th century England for an evening of medieval madness with King Henry VIII and his bevy of lovely wenches, who happily serve you a feast fit for a king. Reservations are required.

 Mel’s Hard Luck Diner , in Branson, is modeled after Mel’s Diner from the T.V. show, Alice. At this traditional’50s-style diner, don’t be surprised to hear the servers singing show tunes as they deliver meals—some past employees have “been discovered” and are now appearing in Branson shows. Mel’s serves classic American eats, from eggs and hash browns to burgers, fries and milkshakes.

A roaring great time and yummy four-course dinner (vegetarian meals are available) can be had at Dolly Parton’s Dixie Stampede , in Branson. While enjoying dinner, families are treated to a live, up-close experience featuring 32 magnificent horses, a stampede of longhorn steers, stunts and special effects.

So, when you have time to actually “stop” for a meal, rather than in and out in 15 minutes, try some of the not-so-fast-food establishments found all over Missouri. You and your significant other can experience a special evening, or the entire family can enjoy a great time while eating together. A restaurant is always a great place to get to know your family all over again.
