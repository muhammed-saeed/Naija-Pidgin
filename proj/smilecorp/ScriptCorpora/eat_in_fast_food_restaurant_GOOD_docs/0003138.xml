 Introduction 

One 
of the goals of the Friends of Science Society is to educate the public through 
dissemination of relevant, balanced and objective technical information on the 
scientific merit of the Kyoto Protocol and the global warming issue. The science 
of climate change is complex. Unfortunately, politics and the media has affected 
the science. Climate research institutions know that they must present scary 
climate forecasts to receive continued funding - no crisis means no funding. The 
media presents stories of climate disaster to sell their products. Scientific 
research that suggests climate change is mostly natural does not receive much if 
any media coverage. These factors have caused the general public to be seriously 
misled on climate issues resulting in wasteful expenditures of billions of 
dollars in an ineffective attempt to control climate. This document gives an 
overview of climate change issues as determined by a comprehensive review of the 
state of climate science.

 
The 
graph above shows the temperature changes of the lower troposphere from the 
surface up to about 8 km as determined from the average of two analyses of 
satellite data. The best fit line from January 2002 to August 2011 
indicates a decline of 0.01 Celsius/decade. The sharp 
temperature spikes in 1998 and 2010 are El Nino events. Surface temperature data 
is contaminated by the effects of urban development. The Sun&apos;s activity, which 
was increasing through most of the 20th century, has recently become quiet. The 
magnetic flux from the Sun reached a peak in 1992. The high magnetic flux 
reduces cloud cover and causes warming. Since then the Sun has become quiet, 
however it continues to cause warming for about a decade after its peak 
intensity due to the huge heat capacity of the oceans. So we expect the warming 
to peak at about 2002. The green line shows the CO2 concentration in the 
atmosphere, as measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The ripple effect in the CO2 curve 
is due to the seasonal changes in biomass. There is a far greater land 
area in the northern hemisphere than the sout h that is affected by 
seasons. During the Northern hemisphere summer there is a large uptake of CO2 
from plants growing causing a drop in the atmospheric CO2 
concentration. 

 The data are obtained from microwave sounding units (MSUs) on the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&apos;s satellites, which relate the 
intensity or brightness of microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the 
atmosphere to temperature. The MSU data set represent the temperatures of a 
layer of the atmosphere that extends from the surface to approximately 8 
kilometres (5 miles) above the surface.  The data is from the 
University of Alabama in Huntsville and Remote Sensing 
Systems.  

 
 The Science in 
Summary 

The history of the Earth tells us that the 
climate is always changing; from warm periods when the dinosaurs flourished, to 
the many ice ages when glaciers covered much of the land. Climate has always 
changed due to natural cycles without any help from people.

The United 
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a political 
organization promoting a theory that recent minor temperature increases may be 
caused largely by man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. CO2 is an infrared 
gas, and increasing concentrations can potentially increase the average global 
temperature as the gas absorbs long-wave radiation from the Earth and emits the 
absorbed energy. However, the warming ability of CO2 is limited because much of 
the absorption spectrum is near or fully saturated. When CO2 concentrations were 
ten times greater than today the Earth was in the grips of one of the coldest 
ice ages. The climate system is dominated by strong negative feedbacks from 
clouds and water vapour which offsets the warming effects of CO2 
emissions.

The history of climate and CO2 concentration shows that 
temperature changes precede CO2 changes and can not be a significant driver of 
climate. Temperature changes over different time scales have been well 
correlated to solar cycles, cosmic ray flux and cloud cover. Recent research 
shows that cosmic rays act as a catalyst to create low clouds, which cool the 
planet. When the Sun is more active, the solar wind repels the cosmic rays, 
reducing low cloud cover allowing the Sun to warm the planet.

Computer 
model results presented in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report predict that global 
warming will cause a distinctive temperature profile in the atmosphere of 
enhanced warming rate in the upper atmosphere at 8 to 12 km altitude over 
the tropics. The predicted temperature profile is the result of an expected 
increase in water vapour in the upper atmosphere which would amplify a CO2 
induced warming three fold. The computer models are programmed to forecast a 
constant water vapor relative humidity with increasing CO2 resulting in a large 
water vapor feedback. Actual temperature data shows no such enhanced warming 
profile. Therefore, the comparison of observed data to computer models 
proves that no such water vapour induced warming amplification exists, so CO2 is 
not the main climate driver. In atmosphere layers near 8 km, the modelled 
temperature trend from 1980 is 200 to 400% higher than observed. Weather 
balloon data shows that specific humidity has fallen 9% since 1960 in 
the upper troposphere (400 mbar pressure level) where the models predict 
the greatest feedback.  Adding CO2 to the atmosphere 
replaces a significant amount of water vapour, the most important greenhouse 
gas, resulting in only a small increase of the greenhouse effect. 

An analysis of satellite data shows that clouds cause a strong negative 
feedback on temperature, but climate models assume that clouds cause a positive 
feedback. Modelers assumed that all cloud changes are caused by temperature 
changes which results in them inferring a positive feedback. But changing cloud 
cover can also cause temperature changes. Scientists can now separate these two 
effects. The correct analysis shows that clouds cause a strong negative 
feedback, so if temperatures increase, cloud cover increases, reflecting solar 
energy back to space and greatly reducing the warming effect of CO2 
emissions.

Several planets and moons have warmed recently along with the Earth, 
confirming a natural sun caused warming trend. Over longer time periods, as the 
solar system moves in and out of the galactic arms the cosmic ray flux changes, 
causing ice ages and warm ages. A comparison of temperature and solar activity 
proxy data suggests that solar effects can explain at least 75% of the surface 
warming during the last 100 years.

CO2 is plant food and the increase in 
the CO2 concentration may have increased the global food production by 15% since 
1950 resulting in huge benefits for people. For Canada, any CO2 warming effect 
would also benefit us by reducing our space heating costs and making a more 
pleasant climate.

The IPCC predicts that global average temperatures 
will increase by 0.17 to 0.38 o C per decade to the end of the century 
depending on the rate of CO2 growth in the atmosphere and other assumptions. The 
projections assume that no action is taken to limit CO2 emissions. However, 
these predictions are unrealistic because they falsely assume that the recent 
temperature changes are driven solely by CO2 and that the Sun has little effect 
on climate. A recent study of past climate change used by the IPCC has been 
shown to be wrong due to the use of a faulty algorithm, and the inappropriate 
selection of data.

The land temperature record is contaminated by the 
urban heat island effect. Fully correcting the land temperature record would 
reduce the warming trend from 1980 to 2002 by half. The IPCC historical CO2 
record may be incorrect due to inappropriate adjustments to the ice core data, 
and ignoring direct historical CO2 measurements. The IPCC selects and adjusts 
data to conform to its CO2 warming hypothesis and ignores alternative climate 
theories. This is the wrong way to do science. Many scientists strongly disagree 
with the IPCC conclusions.

The sea level data shows no increase in the 
recent rate of sea level rise, and no such increase is expected over the next 
hundred years. There has been no detected increase in severe storms and there is 
no reason to expect an increase in the number or intensity of hurricanes 
resulting from any warming assumed to be from human caused CO2 
emissions.

Any increase in temperatures due to human caused CO2 
emissions will likely be beneficial to human health. The CO2 fertilization 
effect will increase the rate of forest growth and CO2 induced crop yield 
increases will reduce the pressures to cut down forests for farmland expansion. 
This will greatly benefit animals by slowing habitat destruction.

The 
benefits of CO2 emissions greatly exceed any likely harmful effects. Several 
authorities who have studied solar cycles have warned that the Earth may soon 
enter a cooling phase as the Sun is expected to become less active. The 
atmosphere may warm because of human activity, but if it does, the expected 
change is unlikely to be more than 0.5 C, and probably less, in the next 
100 years.
 
 Greenhouse Gas 
Effect

 




This graphic from Trenberth et al 2009 here , 
shows the exchange of energy among Space, the Sun, the atmosphere and the Earth. 
Greenhouse gases are primarily water vapour, carbon dioxide and ozone. 
Greenhouse gases are mostly transparent to incoming solar radiation, but absorb 
outgoing long wavelength radiation. The absorbed energy is then transferred to 
cooler molecules or radiated at longer wavelengths than the energy previously 
absorbed. This process makes the Earth warmer than it otherwise would be without 
the greenhouse gases (but with the atmosphere and clouds) by about 33 degrees 
Celsius.


Water vapour and clouds together account for over 70% of the total 
current greenhouse effect. However, in terms of changes to the greenhouse effect 
due to human activities, water vapour is generally considered a feedback and not 
a forcing agent. Computer simulations show the a uniform 2.8% change in water 
vapour has the same effect as a 100% change in CO2 concentration. (See the 
water vapour feedback section for further information.)

Optical depth is a measure how transparent the atmosphere is to longwave 
radiation. More greenhouse gases reduce the transparency of the atmosphere 
to longwave radiation from the surface.

See here for a discussion of CO2 versus 
water&apos;s contribution to the greenhouse effect.



                                      Absorption Spectrum 
 








The graph at the left shows the 
absorption spectra of the greenhouse gases. Where the black shading extends from 
0 to 1, it indicates that at that wavelength the energy is fully absorbed. 
Adding more gas of that type will not absorb any more energy as that wavelength 
is fully saturated. Comparing the CO2 and H2O absorption spectra shows that much 
of the CO2 spectrum overlaps with that of water. Parts of the CO2 spectrum are 
already fully saturated. Adding more CO2 will result in ever diminishing effects 
as more of the available wavelengths become saturated. The temperature response 
to adding CO2 to the atmosphere depends on the amount of positive and negative 
feedbacks from water vapour, clouds and other sources. The temperature effect of 
increasing CO2 concentration is approximately logarithmic. This means if 
doubling the CO2 concentration from 300 ppm to 600 ppm, a 300 ppm 
increase, causes the temperature to rise by 1 o C, it would take 
another 600 ppm increase to add a further 1 o C temperature gain. See here .

 
 
 
 Climate Is Always 
Changing 

The Earth&apos;s history shows that the climate has 
always been changing, over both short-term and long-term time scales. These 
changes have sometimes been abrupt and severe, without any help from humans. 
Climate temperature reconstructions are determined from a variety of sources, 
such as from tree ring width studies and ocean floor sediments. During the 
last 2 billion years, the Earth has alternated between cool periods like today, 
and warm periods like when the dinosaurs roamed the planet. The figure below on 
the left is a temperature reconstruction of the Earth over 2 billion years. 
Temperatures over this time frame are determined by mapping the distribution of 
ancient coals, desert deposits, tropical soils, salt and glacial deposits, as 
well as the distribution of plants and animals that are sensitive to climate, 
such as alligators, palm trees&amp;mangrove swamps. See here for further information .

Climate is always changing, as the history 
of Europe&apos;s temperature over the last thousand years shows in the graph

The temperature history shown at the left was 
published in the first IPCC report in 1990, based on Lamb&apos;s estimated climate 
history of Central England.
Clearly, human activity could not have had a 
significant effect on the temperature changes before 1900. These changes are the 
result of natural processes.

temperature graphs since 1880 .

 

 
 CO2 - Temperature 
Correlation 
 
The temperature of the Earth has 
warmed slightly, about 0.7 degrees Celsius, over the last hundred years. Over 
this time, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased, mostly due to the 
increased use of fossil fuels. However, the Sun has increased in intensity since 
1900 which may have induced much of the observed warming since then. Scafetta 
and West estimate that the Sun may have caused 10 to 20% of the increase in CO2 
during the last century. (See page 2 of their paper here .) A short-term correlation does not imply that the CO2 increase caused the 
temperature increase. Causation can be inferred if there is a correlation over 
several cycles of CO2 concentration changes, with the CO2 change preceding the 
temperature change. The actual climate history shows no such correlation, and 
there is no compelling evidence that the recent rise in temperature was caused 
by CO2. Temperatures have been variable over time, and do not correlate to CO2 
concentration. When CO2 concentrations were 10 times higher than they are now we 
were in a major ice age. As a greenhouse gas, CO2 is vastly outweighed by 
(natural) water vapour and clouds, which accounts for over 70% of the greenhouse 
effect. Human-related CO2 emissions soared after 1940. Yet most of the 20th 
century&apos;s world-wide temperature increase occurred beforehand. See here for a graphic of the carbon cycle.

The CO2 annual growth rate to June 
2011 is given 
below.
                                      







The actual increase of CO2 
concentration averaged 0.5% per year since 
1990.






 

  

                          

 
 CO2 
Changes Follow Temperature Changes 
 
Fischer et al. (1999) 
examined records of atmospheric CO2 and air temperature derived from Antarctic 
Vostok ice cores that extended back in time across a quarter of a million years. 
Over this immense time span, the three most dramatic warming events experienced 
on earth were those associated with the terminations of the last three ice ages; 
and for each and every one of these tremendous global warmings, Earth&apos;s air 
temperature rose well before there was any increase in atmospheric CO2. In 
fact, the air&apos;s CO2 content did not begin to rise until 400 to 1,000 years after 
the planet began to warm. Ice cores provide a detailed record of local 
temperature and CO2 concentrations. A study by Caillon et al. (2003) finds that 
the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years. The 
authors measured the isotopic composition of argon40 and CO2 concentration in 
air bubbles in the Vostok core during the end of the third most recent ice age 
(Termination III), 240,000 years before the present. The argon40 isotope is 
found to be an excellent proxy for temperature.

            Vostok Ice Core Data over End of Third Ice Age 
BP
       The CO2 and Argon 
(Temperature) Age Scales are Shifted 800 Years
 









The CO2 concentration shown 
by the black line is plotted against age in years before present (BP) on the 
bottom axis, and the Argon40, a temperature proxy, shown by the grey line is 
plotted against age on the top axis. The age scale for the CO2 has been shifted 
by a constant 800 years to obtain the best correlation of the two data sets. The 
correlation shows that temperature changes precede CO2 concentration changes by 
about 800 years.

These findings confirm that an increase in CO2 has never 
initially caused an increase in temperature during a deglaciation. Temperature 
increases cause the oceans to expel CO2, increasing the CO2 content of the 
atmosphere. When temperature is at its maximum in each cycle and starts to fall, 
CO2 concentrations continue to increase for another 800 years! As CO2 
increases, temperatures fall. This is the opposite of what one would expect if 
CO2 were a primary climate driver. The ice core data proves that CO2 is not a 
primary climate driver. One must invoke reverse time causality to claim the ice 
core data shows CO2 causes temperature change, like suggesting actions taken 
today can affect the conquests of Mongol leader Genghis Khan. Logic demands that 
cause must precede effect. Increases in air temperature drive increases in 
atmospheric CO2 concentration, and not vice versa.
See here for more 
information. See here for a graph of 
Vostok ice core data. See here for 
the Cailion et al (2003) paper.
 
 Sun Activity Does Correlate with 
Temperature 

Numerous papers published in major peer-reviewed 
scientific journals shows the Sun is the primary driver of climate change. There is a very strong correlation between the Sun activity and temperature.

Early in the nineteenth century, William Herschel (1738-1822), 
discoverer of Uranus, found that five periods of low number of sunspots 
corresponded to high wheat prices when the temperatures were cold. (Cold climate 
reduces the supply of wheat causing its price to rise.) See here .

E. 
Friis-Christensen and K.Lassen have shown that the length of the mean 11 year 
Sunspot cycle correlates to the northern hemisphere temperature during the past 
130 years. The length of the Sunspot cycle is known to vary with solar 
activity, whereas high solar activity implies short sunspot cycle length. See here 
for further information. 

See here for an updated 
plot based on Friis-Christensen and Lassen&apos;s methodology.

Here is a 
correlation of the sunspot cycle length, global temperature and CO2 
concentrations.
                      Sunspot Cycle Length Temperature and 
CO2 
 









The 
red squares on the graph represent the sunspot cycle lengths. One point is the 
cycle length from the time of the maximum number of sunspots to the time of the 
maximum number of sunspots of the next cycle, and the following point is the 
cycle length from the time of the minimum number of sunspots to the time of the 
minimum number of sunspots of the next cycle. The sunspot cycles are back 
filtered using weighting 1,2,3,4 applied to each cycle point, both min to min 
and max to max. This assumes that the current cycle has the most effect on 
temperature (weight 4), and previous half cycles affect current temperatures in 
declining amounts, but future cycles have no effect on the current temperature. 
The temperature curve in blue used the HadCRUT3 land and sea data to 1978, the 
MSU satellite data from 1984 to 2006, and the average of the datasets for 1979 
to 1983. This eliminates much of the urban heat island effects. The temperatures 
are unfiltered annual. The CO2 concentrations (ppmv) from 1958 to 2007 are 
derived from air samples collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. CO2 
concentrations prior to 1958 are uncertain.

Note that there is a 
correspondence between sunspot cycle length and temperature. Both the 
temperature and the cycle length curves begin to rise at 1910, and temperatures 
fall after 1945 to 1975 when the cycle length curve falls, and both curves rise 
again after 1975. Temperatures have been increasing since 1980 faster than 
can be explained by the sunspot cycle length, indicating a possible human CO2 
contribution. The recent increase of the cycle lengths explains why there has 
been no warming since 2002. Temperature changes are expected to follow Sun 
activity changes due to a time lag resulting from the large heat capacity of the 
oceans.

N. Scafetta of Duke University, Durham, NC and B.J. West of the 
US Army Research Office, NC studied the solar impact on 400 years of the 
Northern Hemisphere temperatures since 1600. They find good correspondence 
between temperature and solar irradiance proxy reconstructions up until 1920 as 
shown on the graph below.

               Northern Hemisphere Temperature vs 
Solar Irradiance 400 years 

 









The 
temperature curve is derived from proxy records to 1850 by Moberg et al. [2005], 
and from instrumental surface temperature data from 1850 to about 1980. The 
surface temperature record includes the urban heat island (UHI) and land use 
changes effects. The Northern Hemisphere MSU lower troposphere record is shown 
from 1979 in blue, which eliminates most of the UHI effects. Two different solar 
irradiance proxy reconstructions are shown: Lean, 2000; Wang et al., 2005. Both 
curves merge the ACRIM satellite data since 1980 with the proxy data. By 
assuming ACRIM, the solar activity has an increasing trend during the second 
half of the 20th century. This graph is modified from the version created 
by Scafetta and West, which uses the contaminated instrument record after 1979 
instead of the satellite data. See the original version here .

Note the low solar activity 
periods occurring during the Maunder Minimum (16451715, the Little Ice Age) and 
during the Dalton Minimum (17951825).

Note the excellent correlation 
from 1600 to 1900 when humans were unlikely to effect climate. During the 20th 
century one continues to observe a significant correlation between the solar and 
temperature patterns: both records show an increase from 1900 to 1950, a 
decrease from 1950 to 1970, and again an increase from 1970 to 2000.

A 
divergence of the curves from the Scafetta and West original graph indicates 
that the Sun is responsible for 56% using Lean 2000, and 69% using Wang 2005, of 
the northern hemisphere warming from 1900 to 2005. The authors estimate the 
error at 20%.

There are two solar composites available from satellite 
data. The ACRIM is obtained directly from the satellite data, while the PMOD 
assumes that Nimbus7/ERB satellite data covering the ACRIM gap (19891992) are 
still significantly corrupted and require additional severe adjustments. The 
ACRIM data shows higher solar irradiance during solar cycle 22 - 23 than the 
PMOD data. Using the PMOD data and the original graph, the Sun likely has 
contributed 50% of the surface warming from 1900 to 2005.

The authors did 
a similar analysis using the Mann and Jones 2003 temperature reconstruction. 
This temperature history shows little variation before 1900 and shows a hockey 
stick shape. This reconstruction has been severely criticized for several 
reasons. See The IPCC Hockey 
Stick section of this essay. The authors found that the Mann and Jones 
2003 reconstruction (when compared to the Lean 2000 data) results in an 
unphysical zero response time to solar forcing. The ocean&apos;s large heat capacity 
should result in a time lag of surface temperatures with respect to long time 
solar changes of several years, so this reconstruction cannot be 
correct.

The authors&apos; analysis shows the Sun has contributed 50 to 69% of 
the surface warming depending on the reconstructions utilized. The remainder may 
be due to CO2, UHI and land use changes. The authors compare the Sun&apos;s 
irradiance to the Northern Hemisphere land surface temperatures, which are 
contaminated with the urban heat island effect. The global MSU satellite 
temperatures, which are not contaminated by the UHI effect, have increased by 
half as much as the North Hemisphere temperatures since 1980. If the Scafetta 
and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results 
would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of 
the last century. See more about the UHI effect later in this essay here . See here for the 
November 2007 article.

A group of NASA and university scientists have 
found convincing evidence of a link between the Sun activity and climate by 
comparing the records of the historical water level of the Nile River to the 
number of auroras observed in northern Europe and the Far East between 622 and 
1470 AD. Auroras are bright glows in the night sky following solar flares, and 
are an excellent means of tracking solar activity. See this link for 
further information .
     
A study by WJR 
Alexander et al, published June 2007 compared hydrometeorological data to solar 
variability. The study looked at rainfall, river flow and flood data. The 
authors conclude that there is &quot;an unequivocal synchronous linkage between these 
processes in South Africa and elsewhere, and solar activity.&quot; The study included 
an analysis of the level of Lake Victoria, which has been carefully monitored 
since 1896. In the early 1960s a dramatic rainfall increase significantly raised 
the lake level, and the level since then has been falling at about 29 mm per 
year. The decline has been removed from the data plotted below. The plot 
shows two periods of strong correlation between lake level and sunspot number, 
corresponding to periods of high levels of volcanic 
dust.

 Longer term, here is a correlation of a solar proxy to a 
temperature proxy for a period of 3000 years. Values of carbon-14 (produced by 
cosmic rays hence a proxy for solar activity) correlate extremely well with 
oxygen-18 (temperature proxy). The lower graph shows a particularly 
well-resolved time interval from 8,350 to 7,900 years BP. 

 

The above graph summarizes data obtained 
from a stalagmite from a cave in Oman, as reported in the paper, Neff, U., et 
al. 2001.
 

Recently, Tim Patterson, an adviser to the FOS, has studied 
high-resolution Holocene climate records from fjords and coastal lakes in 
British Columbia and demonstrates a link between temperature and solar cycles.

 








The spectral analysis shown here 
is from sediment cores obtained from Effingham Inlet, Vancouver Island, British 
Columbia. The annually deposited laminations of the core are linked to the 
changing climate conditions. The analysis shows a strong correlation to the 
11-year sunspot cycle.

 Sun and Cosmic Rays 

During 
the 20th century the Sun has continued to warm and may have contributed directly 
to a third of the warming over the last hundred years. The change in solar 
output is too small to directly account for most of the observed warming. 
However, the Sun-Cosmic Ray connection provides an amplification mechanism by 
which a small change in solar irradiance will have a large effect on climate.

A paper by H. Svensmark and E. Friis-Christensen of the Center for 
Sun-Climate Research of the Danish National Space Center in Copenhagen has shown 
that cosmic rays highly correlate to low cloud formation. Changes in the 
intensity of galactic cosmic rays alter the Earths cloudiness. 

An 
experiment in 2005 shows the effect of cosmic rays in a reaction chamber 
containing air and trace chemicals found over the oceans. Electrons released in 
the air by cosmic rays act as a catalyst in making aerosols. They significantly 
accelerate the formation of stable, ultra-small clusters of sulphuric acid and 
water molecules, which are the building block for the cloud condensation 
nuclei.

Danish scientists reported in May 2011 that they have succeeded for the 
first time in directly observing that the electrically charged particles coming 
from space and hitting the atmosphere at high speed contribute to creating the 
aerosols that are the prerequisites for cloud formation. In a climate chamber at 
Aarhus University, scientists have created conditions similar to the atmosphere 
at the height where low clouds are formed. This artificial atmosphere was 
irradiated with fast electrons from ASTRID Denmarks largest particle 
accelerator. The experiments show that increased radiation from cosmic rays 
leads to more aerosols. In the atmosphere, these aerosols grow into actual cloud 
nuclei in the course of hours or days. Water vapour concentrates on the nuclei 
forming small cloud droplets. See the news release here .

A team of 63 scientists published results in August 2011 of a much more 
sophisticated experiment which investigated the effects of cosmic rays on 
cloud formation. The CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) experiment at 
CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva show big effects of 
pions from an accelerator, which simulate the cosmic rays and ionize the air in 
the experimental chamber. The CLOUD experiment is the most rigorous test of 
the Cosmic Ray hypothesis yet devised. The experiments show that cosmic rays 
strongly enhance the formation rate of aerosols by up to ten fold, and confirms 
the earlier results from the Danish experiment. The aerosols may grow into cloud 
condensation nuclei on which cloud droplets form. See the CERN press release here .

The graph below shows the aerosol particle concentration growth in the CLOUD 
chamber. In an early-morning experimental run at CERN, starting at 03:45, 
ultraviolet light began making sulphuric acid molecules in the chamber, while a 
strong electric field cleansed the air of ions. As soon as the electric field 
was switched off at 04:33, natural cosmic rays raining down through the roof 
helped to build clusters at a higher rate. When CLOUD simulated stronger cosmic 
rays with a beam of charged pion particles starting at 4:58 the rate of cluster 
production became faster still. The various colours are for clusters of 
different diameters (in nanometres) as recorded by various instruments. The 
largest (black) took longer to grow than the smallest (blue). See here . 
The CLOUD results also show that trace vapours assumed until now to account for 
aerosol formation in the lower atmosphere can explain only a tiny fraction of 
the observed atmospheric aerosol production.

 

 

 Coronal mass ejections from the sun cause a large decrease 
in the cosmic ray count, which are called Forbush decrease. These dramatic, 
short term cosmic ray decreases can be used to confirm the cosmic ray 
effects on clouds. The magnetic plasma clouds from solar 
coronal mass ejections provide a temporary shield against galactic cosmic rays.
 
 A study by Svensmark et al in 2009 shows that the decease in cosmic 
rays have a large effect on the amount of aerosols, cloud cover and the liquid 
water content of clouds. The authors conclude &quot; From solar 
activity to cosmic ray ionization to aerosols and liquid-water clouds, a causal 
chain appears to operate on a global scale.&quot;  

The figure below shows the evolution of fine aerosols particles in the lower atmosphere (AERONET),  cloud water 
content (SSM/I), liquid water cloud fraction (MODIS), and low IR-detected clouds 
(ISCCP), averaged for the 5 strongest Forbush decreases in the period 
1987-2007. The red dashed line shows the average cosmic ray count percent 
change. The lowest aerosol count occurs 5 days after the Forbush minimum, and 
the cloud water content minimum occurs 4 days later.  The 
response in cloud water content for the larger events is about 7%.

 The broken horizontal lines denote the 
mean for the first 15 days before the Forbush minimum of each 
of the four data sets.

Data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project and the 
Huancayo cosmic ray station shows a remarkable correlation between low clouds 
(below 3 km) and cosmic rays. There are more than enough cosmic rays at high 
altitudes, so changes in the cosmic rays do not effect high clouds. But fewer 
cosmic rays penetrate to the lower clouds, so they are sensitive to changes in 
cosmic rays. 

              Cosmic Rays and 
Low Clouds 
 






The blue 
line shows variations in global cloud cover collated by the International 
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project. The red line is the record of monthly 
variations in cosmic-ray counts at the Huancayo station.

Low-level clouds 
cover more than a quarter of the Earth&apos;s surface and exert a strong cooling 
effect on the surface. A 2% change in low clouds during a solar cycle will 
change the heat input to the Earth&apos;s surface by 1.2 watts per square metre 
(W/m 2 ). This compares to the total warming of 
1.4 W/m 2 the IPCC cites in the 20th century. (The IPCC does not 
recognize the effect of the Sun and Cosmic rays, and attributes the warming to 
CO2.)

Cosmic ray flux can be determined from radioactive isotopes such as 
beryllium-10, or the Suns open coronal magnetic field. The two independent 
cosmic ray proxies confirm that there has been a dramatic reduction in the 
cosmic ray flux during the 20th century as the Sun has gained intensity and the 
Sun&apos;s coronal magnetic field has doubled in strength.

                Cosmic Ray Flux Since 1700
 
 









Changes 
in the flux of galactic cosmic rays since 1700 are here derived from two 
independent proxies, 10Be (light blue) and open solar coronal flux (dark blue) 
(Solanki and Fligge 1999). Low cloud amount (orange) is scaled and normalized to 
observational cosmic-ray data from Climax (red) for the period 1953 to 2005 (3 
GeV cut-off). Both scales are inverted to correspond with rising temperatures. 
Note that high cosmic ray flux around 1700 is at the end of the Little Ice Age. 
Also note the increase in cosmic ray flux after 1780 at the time of the Dicken&apos;s 
Winters.





The graph below shows a correlation between the 
cosmic ray counts and the global troposphere temperature radiosonde data. The 
cosmic ray scale is inverted to correspond to increasing temperatures. High 
solar activity corresponds to low cosmic ray counts, reduced low cloud cover, 
and higher temperatures. The upper panel shows the troposphere temperatures in 
blue and the cosmic ray count in red. The lower panel shows the match achieved 
by removing El Nino, the North Atlantic Oscillation, volcanic aerosols and a 
linear trend of 0.14 Celsius/decade.
 
The negative correlation between cosmic 
ray counts and troposphere temperatures is very strong, indicating that the Sun 
is the primary climate driver. H. Svensmark and E. Friis-Christensen published 
the above graph in a paper October 2007 in response to a paper by M. Lockwood 
and C. Frohlich, in which they argue that the historical link between the Sun 
and climate came to an end about 20 years ago. However, the Lockwood paper had 
several deficiencies, including the problem that they used surface temperature 
data that is contaminated by the urban heat island effect (see below). They also 
fail to account for the large time lag between long-term solar intensity changes 
to the climate temperature response.

See the Svensmark rebuttal of the 
Lockwood paper here , 
and a critique by myself here .

Over 
the 20th century the Sun has increased activity and irradiance intensity, 
directly providing some warming. The graph below from here shows the rising solar flux during most of the twentieth 
century.

                        Open Solar Flux 
 

When the Sun is active it has a higher number of sun spots 
and emits more solar wind - a continuous stream of very high-speed charged 
particles. The increased solar wind and magnetic field repels cosmic rays that 
otherwise would hit the Earth&apos;s atmosphere, resulting in less aerosols in the 
lower atmosphere thereby reducing low cloud formation. The low clouds have a 
high reflectivity and have a strong cooling effect by reflecting sunlight back 
into space.

In summary, the process is:
More active Sun --&gt; more Sunspots --&gt;more solar wind --&gt;less cosmic ray --&gt;less aerosols --&gt;less low clouds --&gt;more sun light to the surface --&gt;global warming.

The theory of CO2 warming implies that the arctic and 
Antarctica should be warming about the same, and the polar regions should be 
warming more that the rest of the Earth. However, Antarctica has not warmed 
since 1975, which is a big problem for the CO2 theory. The ice covering 
Antarctica has even higher reflectivity than low clouds, so fewer low clouds 
cools Antarctica, while fewer low clouds warms the rest of the planet. 
(Greenland&apos;s ice sheet is much smaller and is not so reflective.) This 
Antarctica temperature trend is strong evidence that the Sun, not CO2, is the 
primary climate driver.

        Antarctica and North America Temperature 
Trends 
 










The 
top curve is the North American surface temperature and the bottom curve is the 
Antarctica (64 S - 90 S) surface temperature over the past 100 years. The 
Antarctic data have been averaged over 12 years to minimize the temperature 
fluctuations. The blue and red lines are fourth-order polynomial fits to the 
data. The curves are offset by 1 K for clarity, otherwise they would cross and 
re-cross three times.




The cosmic ray flux is not only 
influenced by the solar wind, it also varies with the position of the solar 
system in the galactic arms. The solar system passes through the arms of the 
Milky Way galaxy roughly every 140 million years. When the solar system is in 
the galactic arms the intensity of cosmic rays increases, as we are closer to 
more supernovas that give off powerful bursts of cosmic rays. The variations of 
the cosmic ray flux due to the solar system passing through four arms of the 
Milky Way galaxy during the last 550 million years is ten times greater than 
that caused by the Sun. The correlation between cosmic rays and temperatures 
over 520 million years by N. Shaviv and J. Veiser was shown previously. Below is 
a similar graph based on their work, but with the times of the galactic arm 
crossings shown.

    Cosmic Ray Flux and Temperature Changes with Galactic Arm 
Crossings 
 


















Four 
switches from warm hothouse to cold icehouse conditions during the 
Phanerozoic are shown in variations of several degrees K in tropical sea-surface 
temperatures (red curve). They correspond with four encounters with spiral arms 
of the Milky Way and the resulting increases in the cosmic-ray flux (blue curve, 
scale inverted). (After Shaviv and Veizer 2003)



Temperature 
changes over this time range can not be explain by the CO2 
theory.

              CO2 Concentrations 500 
Million Years 
 




 The 
graph shows CO2 concentration over the last 500 million years. The CO2 does not 
correlate with temperature. Note when CO2 concentrations were more than 10 times 
present levels about 175 million years ago and 440 million years ago, the Earth 
was in two very cold ice ages.

 Milankovitch Cycles 

The 
Earth-Sun orbital changes are the principal causes of long term climate 
change. During the last 800,000 years, eight periods of glaciations have 
occurred. Each ice age lasts about 100,000 years with warm interglacial periods 
lasting 10,000 to 12,000 years. Milutin Milankovitch (1879-1958) 
identified three major cyclical variables which became recognized as the 
major causes of climate change. The amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth 
depends on the distance of the Earth to the Sun and the angle of incidence of 
the Suns rays upon the Earths surface. The Earths axis tilt changes on a 
40,000-year cycle, the precession of the equinox changes on a 21,000-year cycle, 
and the eccentricity of the Earths elliptical orbit changes on 
a 100,000-year cycle.

The Earth&apos;s axis tilt (also known as obliquity of the 
ecliptic) changes from 22 to 24.5 degrees over a 40,000-year cycle. 
Summer to winter extremes are greater when the axis tilt is greater. The 
precession of the equinox refers to the Earth&apos;s wobble as it spins on its axis. 
Currently, the north axis points to the North Star, Polaris. In 13,000 years it 
would point to the star Vega, then return to Polaris in another 13,000 years, 
creating a 26,000-year cycle. When this is combined with the advance of the 
perihelion (the point at which the Earth is closest in its orbit to the 
Sun), it produces a 21,000-year cycle. The variation of the elliptical shape of 
the Earth&apos;s orbit around the sun ranges from an almost exact circle 
(eccentricity = 0.0005) to a slightly elongated shape (eccentricity = 0.0607) on 
a 100,000-year cycle.  The Earth&apos;s eccentricity varies primarily 
due to interactions with the gravitational fields of other planets. The impact 
of the variation is a change in the amount of solar energy from closest approach 
to the Sun (perihelion, around January 3) to the furthest distant to the 
Sun (aphelion, around July 4). Currently the Earth&apos;s eccentricity is 0.016 
and there is about a 6.4 percent increase in incoming solar energy from July to 
January. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter occurs during the closest 
approach to the Sun. The graph below shows the three cycles versus time. The 
vertical line represents the present, negative time is the past and positive 
time is the future. See here .

 

Analysis of deep-sea cores shows sea temperature changes corresponding to 
these cycles, with the 100,000-year cycle being the strongest.

These 
solar cycles do not cause enough change in solar radiation reaching the Earth to 
cause the major climatic change without an amplifier effect. A plausible 
amplifier is the Suns varying solar wind that modifies the amount of cosmic 
rays reaching the Earths atmosphere.

The rate of change of global ice volume varies inversely with the solar 
insolation due to orbital changes. The graph below compares the June solar 
insolation anomaly north of 65 degrees latitude to the rate of change of global 
ice volume over the last 750,000 years. Reconstructions of global ice volumes 
rely on the measurement of oxygen isotopes in the shells of foraminifera 
from deep-sea sediment cores. The records also in part reflect deep ocean 
temperatures. Two ice records are shown; SPECMAP and HW04.

 

The ice melting and sublimation rates are very sensitive to 
summertime temperatures. The strong correlations and the absence of a large time 
lag demonstrate essentially concurrent variations in the change of ice volumes 
and summertime insolation in the northern high latitudes. Both ice volume 
reconstructions therefore support the Milankovitch hypothesis and show that the 
Sun is the dominant climate driver. The graph is from a paper by G. Roe here .


 Heating of the 
Troposphere 

Computer models based on the theory of CO2 
warming predicts that the troposphere in the tropics should warm faster than the 
surface in response to increasing CO2 concentrations, because that is where the 
CO2 greenhouse effect operates. The Sun-Cosmic ray warming will warm the 
troposphere more uniformly.

The UN&apos;s IPCC fourth assessment report 
includes a set of plots of computer model predicted rate of temperature change 
from the surface to 30 km altitude and over all latitudes for 5 types of climate 
forcings as shown below.

                     Computer Model 
Predicted Temperature Change 
 













   The six plots show predicted temperature changes due to:
       a) the Sun
        b) volcanic activity
        c) anthropogenic CO2 and other greenhouse 
gasses
        d) anthropogenic 
ozone
       e) anthropogenic sulphate 
aerosol particles
        f) all 
the above forcings combined

The rate of temperature change is shown by 
the colour in degrees Celsius per decade.

It is apparent that plot c) of 
warming caused by greenhouse gasses is strikingly distinct from other causes of 
warming. Plot f) is similar to plot c) only because the IPCC assumes that CO2 is 
the dominant cause of global warming.

The computer models show that 
greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over 
the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected 
to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the 
surface.

However, the Hadley Centre&apos;s real-world plot of radiosonde 
temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced 
global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from 
the observational record. This shows that most of the global temperature change 
can not be attributed to increasing CO2 
concentrations.

Warming? What Greenhouse Warming? by Christopher Monckton 

The graph 
below compares the global annual temperatures of the troposphere to the surface 
measurements. The lower troposphere measurements from the University of 
Alabama in Huntsville (LT UAH). It measures the temperature of the troposphere 
up to approximately 8 km. The HadCRUT3 curve is the Land and Sea-Surface 
Temperatures data set from UK Met Office. The GISS curve is the surface 
temperatures from the Goddard Institute of Space Studies. The three curves are 
scaled so that the average of the first 5 years are the same.

 

The graph below compares the annual temperatures of the troposphere to the 
surface measurements in the tropics. The lower troposphere measurements 
from the UAH is from 20 degrees North to 20 degrees South, and the 
surface temperatures from the GISS is from 24 degrees North to 24 degrees South.
 

A 
comparison of the records show that the surface has warmed faster than the 
troposphere, the opposite of what is predicted by the theory of CO2 warming. 
Observations agree with the Sun-Cosmic ray warming theory.

The response 
of the troposphere temperatures in the tropics is sometimes called the 
fingerprint of the CO2 contribution to warming.

 
This graph shows two analyses of Microwave Sounding 
Unit (MSU) satellite temperature measurement data of the troposphere over the 
tropics from 20 degrees North to 20 degrees South. The UAH analysis is from the 
University of Alabama in Huntsville and the RSS analysis is from Remote Sensing 
Systems. The two analyses use different methods to adjust for factors such as 
orbital decay and inter-satellite difference. The overall trend lines 
to June 2011 shows increasing temperatures at 0.07 C/decade for UAH and 
0.13 C/decade for RSS. However, since January 2002, the temperatures have been 
declining at 0.09 C/decade for UAH and 0.21 C/decade for the RSS data. The IPCC 
projections do not agree with the data.
 
 Stratospheric 
Cooling 

The graph &quot;HadAT2 Radiosonde Data 1979 - 1999&quot; in 
the previous section shows that the stratosphere (above 16 km) has cooled, which 
might appear to indicate a greenhouse gas effect. However, stratospheric cooling 
is predicted to occur due to both greenhouse gasses and ozone depletion. The 
ozone concentration in the stratosphere has declined from 1970 until 1995, and 
has not declined at all since then due to the implementation of the Montreal 
Protocol, which limits the emission of ozone reducing CFCs. See here . The 
stratosphere temperatures are given below from here .

 
The lower stratosphere 
temperature has not declined at all since 1995 (when the ozone levels are stable 
or slightly increasing), so the data does not indicate any greenhouse gas 
cooling of the stratosphere. In fact, it appears that there has been a slight 
warming of the lower stratosphere since 1995, the opposite of what is predicted 
by computer models of the greenhouse gas effects. The stratosphere cooling 
indicated by the radiosonde data is caused by the changing ozone concentration, 
not by greenhouse gasses.

 
 Warming on Other 
Planets 

If the Sun is the primary driver of climate change, 
one should expect to see evidence of recent warming on other planets. As the 
Earth has warmed over the last 100 years, so too has Jupiter, Neptune, Mars and 
Pluto.

Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. Its most distinctive 
feature is the great Red Spot, which is a huge storm that has been raging for 
over 300 years. A new storm, called Red Spot Jr. has recently formed from 
the merger of three oval-shaped storms between 1998 and 2000. The latest images 
from the Hubble Space Telescope suggests that Jupiter is in the midst of a 
global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit 
on different parts of the globe. The new storm has been rising in altitude above 
the surrounding clouds, which signals a temperature increase. See here from 
Space.com.

 

Neptune is the furthest planet from the Sun (Pluto is now a dwarf planet) and 
orbits the Sun at 30 times the distance from the Sun to the 
Earth.
   
                                                  Neptune Warming 
 












In 
the recent article, Hammel and Lockwood, from the Space Science Institute in 
Colorado and the Lowell Observatory, show Neptune has been getting brighter 
since around 1980; furthermore, infrared measurements of the planet since 1980 
show that the planet has been warming steadily from 1980 to 2004.

In the 
figure, (a) represents the corrected visible light from Neptune from 1950 to 
2006; (b) shows the temperature anomalies of the Earth; (c) shows the total 
solar irradiance as a percent variation by year; (d) shows the ultraviolet 
emission from the Sun. All data has been corrected for the effects of Neptune&apos;s 
seasons, variations in its orbit, the apparent tilt of the axis as viewed from 
the Earth, the varying distance from Neptune to Earth, and changes in the 
atmosphere near the Lowell Observatory.

See here 
for more information .

There is also strong evidence of global warming 
on Neptune&apos;s largest moon, Triton, which has heated up significantly since the 
Voyager spacecraft visited it in 1988. The warming trend is causing Triton&apos;s 
frozen surface of Nitrogen gas to turn into gas, making its atmosphere denser. 
See here .

A 
recent study shows that Mars is warming four times faster than the Earth. Mars 
is warming due to increased Sun activity, which increases dust storms. The 
study&apos;s authors led by Lori Fenton, a 
planetary scientist at NASA, says t he dust makes the atmosphere absorb 
more heat causing a positive feedback. Surface air temperatures on Mars 
increased by 0.65 C (1.17 F) from the 1970s to the 1990s. Residual ice on the 
Martian south pole, they note, has steadily retreated over the last four 
years. Thermal spectrometer images of Mars taken by NASA&apos;s Viking mission 
in the late 1970s were compared with similar images gathered more than 20 years 
later by the Global Surveyor.

The demoted planet Pluto is also undergoing warming 
according to astronomers. Pluto&apos;s atmosphere pressure has tripled over the last 
14 years, indicating rising temperatures even as the planet moves further from 
the Sun. See here for further information.

 CO2 Greatly Increases Plant and 
Forest Growth 
 
CO2 is a major plant fertilizer. The increase 
in CO2 emissions have caused increased crop yields and faster growing plants and 
forests, thereby greening the planet. Estimates vary, but somewhere around 15% 
seems to be the common number cited for the increase in global food crop yields 
due to aerial fertilization with increased carbon dioxide since 1950. This 
increase has both helped avoid a Malthusian disaster and preserved or returned 
enormous tracts of marginal land as wildlife habitat that would otherwise have 
had to be put under the plow in an attempt to feed the growing global 
population. Commercial growers deliberately generate CO2 and increase its levels 
in agricultural greenhouses to between 700 ppm and 1,000 ppm to increase 
productivity and improve the water efficiency of food crops far beyond those in 
the somewhat CO2 starved atmosphere. CO2 feeds the forests, grows more usable 
lumber in timber lots meaning there is less pressure to cut old growth or push 
into &quot;natural&quot; wildlife habitat, makes plants more water efficient helping to 
beat back the encroaching deserts in Africa and Asia and generally increases 
bio-productivity. See here 

 Bigtooth Aspen Growth Response to Enhanced CO2 and 
Temperature 
 

Jurik et al. (1984) exposed 
bigtooth aspen leaves to atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 325 ppm and 1935 ppm 
and measured their photosynthetic rates at a number of different temperatures. 
At 25C, where the net photosynthetic rate of the leaves exposed to 325 ppm CO2 
is maximal, the extra CO2 of this study boosted the net photosynthetic rate of 
the foliage by nearly 100%; and at 36C, where the net photosynthetic rate of 
the leaves exposed to 1935 ppm CO2 is maximal, the extra CO2 boosted the net 
photosynthetic rate of the foliage by a whopping 450%. These results are similar 
to studies of many other plants.

             Young Eldarica Pine Tree Growth Response to 
CO2 
 

Young Eldarica pine trees 
were grown for 23 months under four CO2 concentrations and then cut down and 
weighed. Each point represents an individual tree. Weights of tree parts are as 
indicated. See 
here .

                            Wheat Yield Response to 
CO2 
 

















This 
graph shows the response of wheat grown under wet conditions and when the wheat 
was stressed by lack of water. These were open-field experiments. Wheat was 
grown in the usual way, but the atmospheric CO2 concentrations of circular 
sections of the fields were increased by means of arrays of computer-controlled 
equipment that released CO2 into the air to hold the levels as specified. 
Average CO2-induced increases for the two years were 10% for wet and 23% for dry 
conditions.

Since atmospheric CO2 is the basic &quot;food&quot; of nearly all 
plants, the more of it there is in the air, the better they function and the 
more productive they become. For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere&apos;s CO2 
concentration above the planet&apos;s current base level of slightly less than 400 
ppm, for example, the productivity of earth&apos;s herbaceous plants rises by 
something on the order of 30% (Kimball, 1983; Idso and Idso, 1994), while the 
productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50% (Saxe et 
al., 1998; Idso and Kimball, 2001). Thus, as the air&apos;s CO2 content continues to 
rise, so too will the productive capacity or land-use efficiency of the planet 
continue to rise, as the aerial fertilization effect of the upward trending 
atmospheric CO2 concentration boosts the growth rates of nearly all plants.

A 2003 study using 18 years (1982 to 1999) of satellite 
observations shows that global net primary plant production increased 6% 
over 18 years. The largest increase was in tropical ecosystems. Amazon rain 
forests accounted for 42% of the global increase in net primary production. See here .

The world&apos;s 
population is 6.6 billion and increasing at 1.18% per year. People will 
require increasing quantities of food and more natural ecosystems will be lost 
to crops and pastures. The resulting loss of habitat may result in species 
extinctions if crop yields are not significantly increased. Unfortunately, the 
rate of increase of crop yields is declining as crops are approaching the 
genetic yield limits. Increasing crop yields on existing farmlands would help to 
save lands for nature. If crop yields fail to increase, humans will suffer more 
frequent famines. Fortunately, the increase in CO2 concentrations will 
substantially enhance crop yields and is essential to prevent or delay the 
destruction of habitat and animal species, and may allow us to produce 
sufficient agricultural commodities to feed the growing population. Any action 
taken by us to slow or reverse the increase in CO2 concentration in the air may 
result in more frequent famines and species extinctions.

Climate Change (IPCC) presents projections of climate change, which are based on 
computer models. The projections given in the Summary for Policy Makers are 
based on six scenarios, which include different assumptions of population 
growth, economic growth, technological change and CO2 emissions. The scenarios 
assume that no climate change mitigation actions are taken, and they do not 
assume implementation of the Kyoto protocol. The IPCC does not assign any 
probability or likelihood to any of the scenarios, and the middle scenarios 
should not be interpreted as the most likely. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) 
used the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) projections of greenhouse 
gas emissions that was used in the Third Assessment report (TAR). The emission 
projections are converted to CO2 concentration projections in the TAR 
using the Bern climate-carbon cycle model (BERN-CC; Joos et al., 2001) that 
accounted for the climate-carbon cycle feedback (AR4 Ch 10, pages 750 
and 790). The Bern-CC model gives a range of CO2 concentration at the 
beginning of 2100 for the A2 emissions scenario of 735 ppm to 1080 ppm, with the 
best estimate reference value of 836 ppm. Coupled climate-carbon 
cycle models simulate a range of CO2 concentrations for the A2 emissions 
scenario of 730 to 1020 ppm by the beginning of 2100. These results shows that 
there is a large uncertainty of the projected CO2 concentrations even for a 
given emissions scenario due to uncertainty in future changes in the carbon 
cycle.


The CO2 concentrations from the Bern-CC model were used as inputs to the 
IPCC AR4 climate models to calculate the projected warming of each emission 
scenario. The initial growth rate of the projected CO2 concentrations range 
from 0.48 %/year to 0.56 %/year. The CO2 concentrations of the six projections 
increased from 367 ppm at the beginning of year 2000 to a range of 540 ppm 
to 958 ppm at the beginning of year 2100. The table below shows the 
AR4 projections. The CO2 concentrations are the reference Bern-CC model values 
given here .

The temperature changes &quot;Best Estimate&quot; given in the second column are 
from the average surface temperatures in the period 1980 to 1999. The &quot;Best 
Estimate&quot; from 2006 given in the fourth column is reduced by 0.3 o C 
to account for the actual temperature change to 2006 from the average of 
1980-1999. The average CO2 growth rates of the last two scenarios at 0.82 and 
0.96 %/year appears to be unrealistic considering the actual CO2 growth rate 
1990-2006 is 0.5%/year, and fossil fuels are expected to become more expensive 
as it becomes increasingly difficult to replace depleting oil and gas reserves. 
Note that the CO2 growth rate of the A1FI scenario increases from 0.51%/year in 
the 2000-2010 decade to 1.20%/year by 2060. The CO2 concentration projections 
corresponding to the six emission scenarios are shown below.

 

The graph below compares the actual CO2 concentrations as measured at Mauna 
Loa, Hawaii to the IPCC CO2 reference projections of the Burn-CC model for the 
period January 2000 to January 2010. The uncertainty in the CO2 projections is 
greater than the range shown here. The Low IPCC projection is from the B2 
emission scenario, and the High IPCC projection is from the A1B emission 
scenario. The average IPCC projection is the average of the six scenarios. The 
actual annual CO2 growth rate in 2007 and 2008 were both 0.49%.

 

The IPCC temperature projections for the A2, A1B and B1 scenarios are 
displayed below.

 

Kevin Trenberth is head 
of the large US National Centre for Atmospheric Research and one of the advisors 
of the IPCC. Trenberth asserts &quot;. . . there are no (climate) predictions by IPCC 
at all. And there never have been&quot;. Instead, there are only &quot;what if&quot; 
projections of future climate that correspond to certain emissions scenarios. 
According to Trenberth, GCMs &quot;. . . do not consider many things like the 
recovery of the ozone layer, for instance, or observed trends in forcing agents. 
None of the models used by IPCC is initialised to the observed state and none of 
the climate states in the models corresponds even remotely to the current 
observed climate.&quot; However, Scott Armstrong and Kesten Green audited the 
relevant chapter in the IPCC&apos;s latest report. They find that &quot;in apparent 
contradiction to claims by some climate experts that the IPCC provides 
&apos;projections&apos; and not &apos;forecasts&apos;, the word &apos;forecast&apos; and its derivatives 
occurred 37 times, and &apos;predict&apos; and its derivatives occur 90 times&quot; in the 
chapter. Consequently, it is not surprising that the public has this 
misimpression that the IPCC predicts future climate.
 
 Computer Models 
Fail 

The computer models predict that the 20th century temperatures should have 
increased by 1.6 to 3.74 Celsius, while the actual observed 20th-century 
temperature increase was about 0.6 Celsius. A model that fails to history match 
is useless for predicting the future.

The IPCC Third Assessment Report 
projected a surface temperature increase from 1990 to 2100 of 1.4 C to 5.8 C, 
corresponding to 0.13 C/decade to 0.53 C/decade. The IPCC low estimate 
corresponds to the actual temperature warming rate as measured by satellite 
data.

The IPCC assumes that the Sun has little effect, even though 
observational evidence clearly shows the Sun has a significant effect on 
climate.

The models assume the 20th century temperature rise is caused 
by CO2 increases, and parameters are set in the models to make the temperature 
rise in response to the CO2. The direct effect of increasing CO2 concentration 
on global warming is very small. All the models amplify an initial increase in 
temperature due to CO2 by employing water vapour and clouds as a large positive 
feed back. However, there is no evidence that water vapour and clouds provides a 
large positive feed back. They may provide a negative feed back.

The 
amount of solar energy the Earth recieves depends on the Earth&apos;s albedo, or 
reflectivity. The greater the albedo, the more sunlight is reflected and the 
less solar energy is absorbed by the Earth. Project &quot;Earthshine&quot; being done at 
the Big Bear Solar Observatory measures the Earth&apos;s albedo by observing the 
amount of sunlight reflected by the Earth to the dark side of the Moon and back 
to Earth. The process is shown below.

 

The results show that the Earth albedo has 
gradually fallen up to 1997, likely causing most of the global warming through 
1998. Since 2001 the albedo increased rapidly, which has stopped the warming and 
resulted in the current global cooling. The recent dimming of the Earth is 
likely due to increased low cloud cover. The albedo is shown below.
 













The 
blue lines are the observed earthshine data for 1994-1995 and 1999-2003. The 
black line is the reconstructed albedo from partially overlapping satellite 
cloud data with respect to the mean of the calibration period 1999 to 2001. The 
vertical red line shows the cumulative climate forcing of the increase in 
greenhouse gases over the 20th century of 2.4 W/m2 according to the IPCC. Note 
that the change of the albedo&apos;s climate forcing in W/m2 is much greater than 
that due to greenhouse gases. Current climate models do not show such large 
albedo variability. See an article by Anthony Watts here for further information. See the project Earthshine site here .

Climate 
models utilize large grid blocks to simulate climate, which are too large to 
include thunderstorms or hurricanes, so they use parameterization to account for 
these. These parameterizations ignore real-world transfers of energy, moisture 
and momentum that could significantly alter the results and severely limits the 
usefulness of climate model projections. Computer models employ approximations 
to represent physical processes that cannot be directly computed due to 
computational limitations. Because many empirical parameters can be selected to 
force a model to match observations, the ability of a model to match 
observations cannot be cited as evidence that the model is realistic and does 
not imply it is reliable for forecasting climate. See the Fraser 
Institutes Independent 
Summary For Policy Makers .

Atmospheric methane concentrations have 
been declining in recent years. Methane is a significant greenhouse gas. Climate models assume that methane 
concentrations increase with temperature, and it is not known why its 
concentration is declining. Aerosols play a key role in climate, with a 
potential impact of more than three times that of CO2 emissions, but their 
influence is very poorly understood. Aerosols exert an overall cooling 
effect on climate but estimates of the effect vary by a factor of ten. Models 
used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report assume aerosols have a large cooling 
effect, thereby attributing a large warming effect to CO2.

Only 2 of the 
23 models used by the IPCC account for varying Sun intensity, and these models 
do not assume the Sun affects the cosmic ray flux and cloud formation. Only 2 of 
the models account for land use changes.

Computer models predict warming 
at the north and south poles to be symmetrical, but there is a warming trend at 
the North Pole but not at the South Pole. They also predict that the polar 
surface regions will warm more than the surface at the tropics. Winter 
temperatures will warm more than summer temperatures; night-time temperatures 
will warm more than day-time temperatures. Therefore, according to the CO2 
warming theory, winter nights in the arctic will warm, but there will be little 
summer day time warming in the tropics.

A team of four researchers from 
three American universities led by David Douglass compared the troposphere 
temperature trends in the tropics predicted from climate models to actual 
satellite and radiosonde observations. In a paper published in December 2007 by 
the Royal Meteorological Society, Douglass et al analysed the simulation results 
from 22 climate models at the surface and at 12 different altitudes. The 
simulation results were compared to the temperature trends determined from two 
analysis of satellite data and four radiosonde datasets for the period January 
1979 through December 2004.

              Computer Model Temperature Trends versus 
Observations 
 
The above 
diagram shows the comparison of temperature trends from 1979 through 2004 of 
climate models and actual satellite and radiosonde observations, expressed as 
degrees Celsius per decade versus altitude and atmospheric pressure. The left 
panel shows four radiosonde results as IGRA, RATPAC, HadAT2 and RAOBCORE. The 
thick red line shows the mean of the 22 computer model results, and the models&apos; 
2 times standard error of the mean are shown as the two thin red lines. Temperature trends from three surface measurement datasets are identified in the 
legend by Sfc and are plotted on the left axis. The RSS and UAH analysis of 
satellite data are plotted on the right panel at two effective layers: T2lt 
represents the lower troposphere with a weighted mean at 2.5 km, T2 represents 
the mid troposphere with a weighted mean at 6.1 km altitude. A trend is the 
slope of the line that has been least-squared fit to the data. Synthetic model 
values corresponding to the effective layers of the satellite data are shown in 
the right panel as open red circles.

An essential place to compare 
observations with greenhouse computer models is the layer between 450 hPa and 
750 hPa atmospheric pressure where the presence of water vapour is most 
important, and is called the &quot;characteristic emission layer&quot;. In this layer, the 
observations are all outside the 2 times standard error test. The radiosonde and 
satellite trends are inconsistent with the model trends at all altitudes above 
the surface. Douglass et al. conclude that Model results and observed 
temperature trends are in disagreement in most of the tropical troposphere, 
being separated by more than twice the uncertainty of the model mean. In layers 
near 5 km, the modelled trend is 100 to 300% higher than observed, and, above 8 
km, modelled and observed trends have opposite signs. Therefore any projections 
of future climate from the models are very likely too high, and these 
projections should not be used to form public policy. See the paper &quot;A 
comparison of tropical temperature trends with model predictions&quot; here .

A technical paper published by R. McKitrick, S. McIntyre and C. Herman 
in Atmospheric Science Letters, August 2010 shows that the climate model 
temperature trends of the mid-troposphere, using 57 runs from 23 climate 
models, are four times larger than observations from satellites and weather 
balloons.

discussion by D. Stockwell and see the technical paper here .

 While air temperature may fluctuate from 
year to year as heat is transferred between the air and oceans, if CO2 is 
causing global warming by the IPCC hypothesis, the ocean heat content must 
increase monotonically provided there are no major volcanic eruptions. Ocean 
heat content is a much more robust metric than surface air temperature for 
assessing global climate change because the ocean&apos;s heat capacity is greater 
than that of the atmosphere by many orders of magnitude. For any given area on 
the oceans surface, the upper 2.6 m of water has the same heat capacity as the 
entire atmosphere above it! According the IPCC models, all major 
feedbacks are positive so there is no mechanism that would allow the heat 
content of the Earth to decline.    

Heat accumulating in the climate system can be measured on a 
global scale from 2003 by the ARGO array of 3341 free-drifting floats 
that  measure temperature and salinity in the 
upper 2000 m of ocean. The robotic floats rise to 
the surface every 10 days and transmit data to a satellite which also determines 
their location as shown below.
 
 

Dr. Craig Loehle, Ph.D. has analyzed the ocean heat content 
for a linear trend over 4.5 years of data from mid-2003 to the end of 2007. 
The data shows an annual variation because most of the oceans are in the 
southern hemisphere. To eliminate the annual cycle, a model was fit with slope, 
intercept, and sinusoidal (1-year fixed period) terms using nonlinear 
least-squares estimation. The linear component of the model shows a decline 
of 0.35 x E22 Joules/year. (The graph shows the recalibrated data, after the 
data from certain instruments with a cool bias were removed. Initial Argo 
results showed strong cooling.) The Argo heat content is shown below. See his 
paper here .

 

William DiPuccio compared the projected ocean heat content of the 
GISS climate model to two analyses of the ARGO heat content data. The projected 
heat content of the GISS model was adjusted to include only the upper oceans for 
comparison to the ARGO actual data. He also calculated a lower limit by scaling 
the net global anthropogenic radiative flux to ocean surface area. The 
observed ocean heat content trends were calculated by Josh K. Willis of NASA&apos;s 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Craig Leohle of the National Council for Air 
and Stream Improvement, Inc. Loehle&apos;s calculations have a smaller margin for 
error than Willis, because Willis only uses annual average data.

 

The heat deficit shows that from 2003-2008 there was no positive 
radiative imbalance caused by anthropogenic forcing, despite increasing levels 
of CO2. Indeed, the radiative imbalance was negative, meaning the earth was 
losing slightly more energy than it absorbed. The figure reveals a robust 
failure on the part of the GISS climate model.

William DiPuccio says, &quot;Since the oceans are the primary reservoir 
of atmospheric heat, there is no need to account for lag time involved with heat 
transfer. By using ocean heat as a metric, we can quantify nearly all of the 
energy that drives the climate system at any given moment. So, if there is still 
heat in the pipeline, where is it? The deficit of heat after nearly 6 years of 
cooling is now enormous. Heat can be transferred, but it cannot hide.&quot; See his 
paper here .

Below is a graph which compares ARGO era (2003 to Q1 of 2011) 
the ocean heat content of the top 700 m from the National 
Oceanographic Data Center to the projections of the GISS climate model. The NODC 
OHC dataset is based on the Levitus et al (2009) paper which describes various 
adjustments and corrections to the data. The NODC data includes the ARGO data as 
described above and data from expendable bathythermographs. The GISS model 
projection is discussed here . 
The NODC data is here , 
and the graph is from here .

 

Note the enormous discrepancy between the measurements and the 
climate model projections. 

One of the most important parameters in determining climate 
sensitivity in climate models is the amount of heat they transfer to the oceans. 
The following graph by Dr. Spencer compares the Levitus observations of ocean 
warming trends during 1955-1999 to 15 IPCC 4AR climate model runs.

 

Note that the climate models exhibit wildly different trends, with 
the deep ocean cooling just as often as warming. The green curve is the Levitus 
actual observation to a depth of 700 m. Most of the models produce too much 
warming in the layer to 700 m. Many models produce unexpected ocean cooling 
below 100 m while the surface warms. None of the models even remotely match the 
observations. The weak ocean warming in the 700 m layer suggests low climate 
sensitivity, even if all the warming was due to CO2 emissions. See here .

Many important inputs to climate models are very uncertain and 
real world observational evidence does not support them, so it is foolish to 
rely on their projections to make expensive policy decisions.

listing the success of models is here .
 
 Water Vapour 
Feedback 

 Relative 
humidity is the fraction of water vapour in a small parcel of air relative to 
the total amount of water vapour the air could contain at the given temperature 
and pressure. All the General Circulation Models, also known as 
Global Climate Models (GCM), just set various 
evaporation and precipitation parameters to achieve approximately the 
result:    R elative 
humidity = constant. 

Box 8.1 of 4AR Chapter 8 page 632 states:

 The radiative effect of absorption by water vapour is 
roughly proportional to the logarithm of its concentration, so it is the 
fractional change in water vapour concentration, not the absolute change, that 
governs its strength as a feedback mechanism. Calculations with GCMs suggest 
that water vapour remains at an approximately constant fraction of its saturated 
value (close to unchanged relative humidity (RH)) under global-scale warming 
(see Section 8.6.3.1). Under such a response, for uniform warming, the largest 
fractional change in water vapour, and thus the largest contribution to the 
feedback, occurs in the upper troposphere. 

The assumption of constant relative humidity is not correct. Here is a 
graph of global average annual relative humidity at various elevations in the 
atmosphere expressed in millibars (mb) from 300 mb to 700 mb for the period 1948 
to 2008. [Standard atmospheric pressure = 1013 mb. 1 mb = 1 hectopascal 
(hPa)] The data is from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory here . 

 

  This graph shows that the relative humidity has been 
dropping, especially at higher elevations allowing more heat to escape to space. The curve labelled 300 mb is at about 9 km altitude, which is 
in the middle of the predicted (but missing) tropical troposphere hot-spot. This 
is the critical elevation as this is where radiation can start to escape without 
being recaptured. The average relative humidity at this altitude has 
declined by 20% (or 9.4 percentiles) from 1948 to 2008! 

 Doubling the amount of CO2 would increase 
temperatures by only about 1 degree Celsius if nothing else changed according to 
the IPCC. But the amount of water vapour will change in response to a CO2 
induced temperature increase. Warmer air can hold more water vapour, so if 
relative humidity remains constant, the amount of water vapour increases with 
increasing temperatures. More water vapour, being a powerful greenhouse gas, 
would cause a further temperature increase, which is called a positive feedback. 
Most of the IPCCs projected warming is due to this water vapour 
feedback. 

 But the above graph shows falling relative 
humidity where the IPCC says changing water vapour content is most important. If 
relative humidity declines with increasing CO2 concentrations, the amount of 
water vapour in the upper troposphere may not increase, but might decline 
instead, resulting in a negative water vapour feedback. 

 Here is a graph of specific humidity, or 
the actual water vapour content, in grams of water vapour per kilogram of air, 
at the 400 mb level (about 8 km altitude). 

 

 This shows that the actual water vapour 
content in the upper troposphere has declined by 13% from 1948 to 2010at the 400 
mb pressure level. The climate models predict that humidity will increase in the 
upper troposphere, but the data shows a large decrease; just where water vapour 
changes have the greatest effect on global temperatures. 

 The NASA water vapour project (NVAP) uses 
multiple satellite sensors to create a standard climate dataset to measure 
long-term variability of global water vapour. The Heritage NVAP merges data from 
several satellites and radiosonde water vapour products. The graph below was 
presents at the GEWEX/ESA Due GlobVapour workshop March 8, 2011 here . 

 

 The graph shows a significant decline in 
global water vapour in the atmosphere layer from 300 to 500 hPa, about 6 to 9 km 
altitude. The total water vapour amount from satellite data is shown 
below. 

 

 Greenhouse gases absorb long-wave 
radiation, making the atmosphere opaque at those wave lengths. Optical depth is 
a measure of how opaque the atmosphere is to long-wave radiation, and so is a 
measure of the strength of the greenhouse effect. Dr. Ferenc M. Miskolczi 
has developed a program called High-resolution Atmospheric Radiative Transfer 
Code (HARTCODE) that uses thousands of measured absorption lines and is 
capable of doing accurate optical depth calculations. The calculations are 
independent of any greenhouse theory and contain no assumptions on how the 
greenhouse effect works, other than the fact that greenhouse gases absorb and 
emit radiation. 

 Water vapour is the most important 
greenhouse gas. HARTCODE simulations show that a uniform 2.8% change in water 
vapour has the same greenhouse effect as a 100% change in CO2 concentration. 
This is shown in the following graph. 

 

 The graph shows that increasing the CO2 
concentration to 200% of the current value increases the optical depth by 1.32%, 
and increasing the amount of water vapour by 2.77% increases the optical depth 
by the same amount. Therefore, a 2.77% reduction in water vapour can completely 
offset the effect of CO2 doubling. 

 The 
radiation balance is determined at the top of the troposphere. The HARTCODE was 
used to determine the effect of changes of water vapour at the upper atmosphere 
versus near the surface. The graph below shows that changing the water 
vapour content at the 300 400 mb level has 41 times the effect on out-going 
long-wave radiation (OLR) as the same change near the surface. So only water 
vapour changes in the upper atmosphere matter. 

 

 Miskolczi used HARTCODE to compute the 
optical depth from 1948 to 2008 using the measured CO2 content at Mauna Loa, 
Hawaii and the global average water vapour content from the NOAA Earth System 
Research Laboratory. The optical depths are calculated for each greenhouse gas 
and summed line-by-line across the electromagnetic spectrum. The resulting 
optical depth curve is a measure of the total greenhouse gases by effect over 
the last 61 years. The result is given below. 

 

 The blue line of the graph shows the 
optical depth of the atmosphere with changing CO2 and water vapour content. The 
green line is the linear trend of this data which indicates an insignificant 
trend. The pink line is the effect of increasing CO2 with water vapour held 
constant. It shows a small upward trend. The difference of these trends is the 
water vapour feedback. Recall that the IPCC assumes that water vapour provides a 
large positive feedback, which implies that the green line would be 
increasing much steeper than the pink line. The HARTCODE results shows the 
opposite. It shows a large negative feedback, where the changing water 
vapour offsets most of the warming effect of CO2.  

 The results show that the 
total effective amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere has not 
significantly increased over the last 60 years. 

 The IPCC 
claims that the warming over the last half century was due to an increase in the 
quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmophere. But the HARTCODE result shows 
that CO2 replaces water vapour as a greenhouse gas, so it can&apos;t be 
responsible for global warming. 

Here is the GCM error of specific humidity as reported by the IPCC&apos;s 4AR, 
Chapter 8-Suppl page 54:

 

This chart shows the multi-model mean fractional error, expressed as a 
percent (i.e., simulated minus observed, divided by observed and multiplied by 
100). The observational estimate is from the 40-year European Reanalysis (ERA40, 
Uppala et al., 2005) based on observations over the period 1980-1999. The model 
results are from the same period of the CMIP3 20th Century 
simulations.

Note that the chart shows that the model&apos;s errors in 
specific humidity at the altitude where the largest contribution of the feedback 
is predicted to occur is between 20% to 40% too high! If the specific 
humidity were corrected in the models at this critical altitude, the positive 
feedback would change to a strong negative feedback.

 The strength of the greenhouse effect is undetermined in the 
current theory utilized by climate models. Parameters are just set to match the 
current temperatures. A new greenhouse effect theory by 
Ferenc Miskolczi shows that the current greenhouse effect equations are 
incomplete because they do not include all the necessary energy constraints. 
When these constraints are included in a new theory, the strength of the GHE is 
determined analytically. The new theory presented in Miskolczi&apos;s paper shows 
that the atmosphere maintains a saturated greenhouse effect, controlled by 
water vapor content.  There is a near infinite supply of 
greenhouse gases available to the atmosphere in the form of water vapor from the 
ocean to provide the greenhouse effect, but the atmosphere takes up only a 
portion of the water vapour it could hold due to energy balance 
constraints.   Adding CO2 to the 
atmosphere just replaces an equivalent amount of water vapour to maintain an 
almost constant greenhouse effect and has negligible effect on global 
temperatures. See  here  for 
more information. 


 Cloud 
Feedback 

 

 Climate models are limited by our understanding of cloud formation. 
While scientists have a basic understanding of cloud formation, the details 
controlling how bright they are, how dense and how large they become is poorly 
understood. We lack the detailed understanding of clouds required to make 
accurate climate models. Clouds have a major role in climate by reflecting 
sunlight back into space, trapping heat, and producing precipitation.

As 
the Earth warms, there is more evaporation from the oceans, therefore more water 
vapour in the atmosphere available for cloud formation. But low clouds reflect 
sunlight back into space resulting in a strong cooling effect, negating most of 
the initial temperature increase.

Researchers at the University of 
Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) reported in August 2007 that individual 
tropical warming cycles that served as proxies for global warming saw a decrease 
in the coverage of heat-trapping [high altitude] cirrus clouds, says Dr. Roy 
Spencer, a principal research scientist in UAHuntsville&apos;s Earth System Science 
Center.

 &quot;All leading climate models forecast that as the 
atmosphere warms there should be an increase in high altitude cirrus clouds, 
which would amplify any warming caused by manmade greenhouse gases,&quot; he said. 
&quot;That amplification is a positive feedback. What we found in month-to-month 
fluctuations of the tropical climate system was a strongly negative feedback. As 
the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease. That allows more infrared 
heat to escape from the atmosphere to outer space.&quot;

&quot;While low clouds 
have a predominantly cooling effect due to their shading of sunlight, most 
cirrus clouds have a net warming effect on the Earth,&quot; Spencer said. With high 
altitude ice clouds their infrared heat trapping exceeds their solar shading 
effect. If computer models incorporated this enhanced cooling effect due 
to such a reduction of high clouds, &quot;it would reduce estimates of future warming 
by over 75 percent,&quot; Spencer said.

See the UAH News article 
here , and a report in ScienceDaily 
here . The paper abstract is here .


The modelers only do crude analysis of feedback from satellite data. 
They observe that low clouds tend to decrease with warming and assumed that 
the warming caused the low clouds to decrease. But cloud changes also 
cause temperatures to change. When a cloud moves to block the Sun, 
temperatures fall. The amount of clouds can change in response to a 
general ocean circulation change. So cloud changes are sometimes a cause of 
temperature change, and sometimes an effect of temperature change. The 
false assumption that all cloud changes are the effect of temperature changes 
led modelers to vastly over estimate the feedback from clouds.

Dr. Roy Spencer has developed a method to separate cause and effect of cloud 
variability. His technique is to plot quarterly average temperature and 
net flux readings from satellite data on a graph. These averages are plotted 
every day allowing the time evolution to be visualized. He found that the 
plots have two types of patterns a set of linear striations with a common 
slope, and superimposed slower random spiral patterns.

To understand these patterns, Spencer has developed a simple computer model 
where he can specify the amount of feedback, and can input radiative forcing 
that might be caused by random cloud changes. The model shows that the slope of 
the linear striations corresponds to the feedback in the climate system. These striations are due to changes in evaporation and precipitation which 
causes temperature changes. The temperature changes cause cloud changes, which 
is the cloud feedback signal we are looking for. The spiral patterns are caused 
by radiative forcing that might be due to changing the low cloud cover which 
varies the solar radiation warming the surface.

Spencer has analyzed the temperature-radiative patterns of the NASA Terra 
satellite. The Terra data starts in March 2000, and its 
temperature-radiative plot is shown below.

 

The plot shows two types of patterns; linear striations and random spiral 
patterns. The usual interpretation of this data by climate modelers would be to 
use the best fit line which shows a slope of 0.7 W/m2/C, which is a very high 
positive feedback. The actual feedback should be determined by the slope 
of the linear striations, which is 8 W/m2/C, which is a very high negative 
feedback. A value of 3.3 W/m2/C corresponds to no feedback. (No 
feedback means if the temperature of the atmosphere were uniformly 
increased by 1 C and nothing else changed, the top of the atmosphere would 
radiate 3.3 W/m2 more radiation to space.) The feedback is observed to 
occur on shorter time scales in response to evaporation and precipitation 
events, which are superimposed upon a more slowly varying background of 
radiative imbalance due to natural fluctuation in cloud cover changing the rate 
of solar heating Earths surface.

The satellite data shows that over short time scales, clouds provide strong 
negative feedbacks. Spencer also analyzed the radiative flux and temperature 
variations from climate models used by the IPCC to determine if the short term 
negative feedback found in the satellite data is also applicable to long term 
feedback. He found that the short term linear striations and the spiral 
patterns show up all 18 climate models that he analyzed. Spencer says the slopes 
of the linear striations do indeed correspond to the long term feedbacks 
diagnosed from these models response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
forcing. This strongly suggests that the short term negative feedback 
shown in satellite data also applies to long term global climate change.

The feedback estimate for a hypothetical doubling of carbon dioxide, using 
the Terra satellite data gives a climate sensitivity of 0.46 C.

See here for a more detailed discussion of cloud feedbacks.

 Aerosols 

Aerosols are a suspension of fine particles in the atmosphere and include 
smoke, oceanic haze, smog, etc. The most significant aerosols from human sources 
that affect climate are sulphate and black carbon aerosols. Sulphate aerosols 
are primarily from the burning of fossil fuels and generally cause a cooling 
effect by reflecting solar radiation. Black carbon aerosols are from burning of 
biomass, and generally have a warming effect as it absorbs solar radiation.

Three recent papers discussed below show that change in aerosols account for 
a much larger portion of recent climate change than assumed in climate computer 
models, implying that the effect of CO2 is much less than what the climate 
models show. The sun is likely the main cause of the global warming of the 20th 
century with aerosol changes providing a significant contribution. When one 
combines the effects of aerosols with the Sun, ocean cycles and the urban heat 
island effects, there is no climate change left for CO2 to explain.

A paper published in Journal of Geophysical Research in June, 2009 shows that 
changes in the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere over the 20th century has 
had a much larger impact on global temperatures than they are given credit for 
in the climate computer models. Martin Wild of the Institute for Atmospheric and 
Climate Science, Zurich, Switzerland, shows that the increase of sulphate 
aerosols from fossil fuels caused a global solar dimming effect from the 1950s 
to the 1980s and contributed to global cooling. Air pollution control measures 
have reduced sulphate aerosols from the 1980s to the 2000s, resulting is solar 
brightening which significantly contributed to global warming. Air pollution 
controls allowed more solar radiation to warm the surface. However, on a global 
basis the effect of aerosols has been stable since 2000 and there has been no 
global warming this century. Wild says satellite data and Earthshine 
observations both show a stable planetary albedo after 2000. See here .

A paper published in the journal Science in July, 2009 reports that 
a careful study of satellite data show the assumed cooling effect of aerosols in 
the atmosphere to be significantly less than previously estimated. Gunnar Myhre 
of the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo, 
Norway, states that previous values for aerosol cooling are too high by as much 
as 40 percent, implying the IPCC&apos;s model sensitivity for CO2 are too high. The 
main anthropogenic aerosols that cause cooling are sulphate, nitrate, and 
organic carbon, whereas black carbon absorbs solar radiation. Myhre argues that 
since preindustrial times, black carbon soot particle concentrations have 
increased much more than other aerosols. See here .

NASA research published in Nature Geoscience in April, 2009 suggests 
that much of the atmospheric warming observed in the Arctic since 1976 may be 
due to changes aerosol particles. Scientists led by Drew Shindell of NASA found 
that the mid and high latitudes are especially responsive to changes in the 
level of aerosols. The research suggests aerosols likely account for 45 percent 
or more of the warming that has occurred in the Arctic during the last thirty 
years to 2005. (Arctic temperatures have been falling since 2005.) Since 
decreasing amounts of sulphates and increasing amounts of black carbon in the 
Arctic both encourage warming, temperature increases can be especially rapid. In 
the Antarctic, in contrast, the impact of sulphates and black carbon is 
minimized because of the continents isolation from major population centres. 
Antarctica temperatures have not increased over the last 30 years. See here .

A study published in March 2007 uses the longest uninterrupted satellite 
record of aerosols in the lower atmosphere, a unique set of global estimates 
funded by NASA. Satellite measurements show large, short-lived spikes in global 
aerosols caused by major volcanic eruptions in 1982 and 1991, but a gradual 
decline since about 1990. By 2005, global aerosols had dropped as much as 20 
percent from the relatively stable level between 1986 and 1991.

Since 2005 China has had a major effort to install state-of-the-art 
desulphurisation in its coal-fired plants installing more such units than the 
rest of the world combined. At the end of 2008, 66% of the Chinas coal-fired 
power plant capacity is equiped with flue gas desulphurisation. Today 75% of all 
desulphurisation systems are being installed in China. See here . 
The reduction of aerosols, especially over China, allows more sunlight through 
the atmosphere to warm the Earth&apos;s surface, contributing to global warming.

China&apos;s SO2 emissions have declined 14.5% from 2006 to 2009 according to the 
2009 report on the state of the environment in China. See here .

 

Many studies have shown that aerosols associated with biological activity 
provide a negative feedback to climate change. An initial warming stimulates 
production of marine phytoplankton. These micro-organisms emit greater volumes 
of dimethyl sulphide, or DMS. The DMS is oxidized in the atmosphere creating 
acidic aerosols that function as cloud condensation nuclei. Tiny water droplets 
form around these aerosols leading to the creation of more and brighter clouds 
that reflect more incoming solar radiation back to space, thereby providing a 
cooling effect.

Land plants emit greater amounts of carbonyl sulfide gas in response to 
CO2 fertilization and temperature rise, which is transformed into sulfate 
aerosol particles, which have a cooling effect. See here  for 
more information.
 
 Climate Sensitivity 

 Climate sensitivity refers to the 
equilibrium change in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of 
the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Since pre-industrial times, atmospheric CO2 
has increased from 280 ppmv to 385 ppmv. There are many estimates of climate sensitivity. When the Earth 
warms, it emits more infrared radiation to outer space. This natural cooling 
effect amounts to an average of 3.3 Watts per square meter for every 1 deg C 
(W/m2/C) that the Earth warms. This is often expressed in the reciprical 
form as a gray body Earth sensitivity of 0.30 C/(W/m2) as given here . According to 
the IPCC, a doubling of CO2 concentration would cause a radiation flux forcing 
of 3.71 W/m2, assuming no feedbacks. Therefore, a doubling of CO2 would cause 
3.71 W/m2 / 3.3 W/m2/C = 1.1 Celsius global surface temperature increase, 
assuming no feedbacks. This sensitivity assumes that the amount of water vapour, 
cloud cover, vegetation and ice cover does not change. There is 
little scientific back-up for the CO2 radiation flux forcing numbers used 
by the IPCC. Miskolczi calculates a no feedback climate sensitivity of 0.48 
C. 

 There is a wide range of estimates of the 
climate sensitivity with feedbacks. The IPCC assumes that clouds and water 
vapour cause a positive feedback, while other scientists say that clouds and 
water vapour cause a strong negative feedback. 

 Since 
pre-industrial times, atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppmv to 385 ppmv. 
Humans have not caused all of this increase. Scafetta and West has estimated 
that the Sun has caused 10 to 20% of the CO2 increase. Using 15%, humans 
have caused an estimated 90 ppmv increase in CO2, or a 32% increase from 
the pre-industrial value. 

 The table below 
shows estimates of climate sensitivity from various sources. The climate 
sensitivity is shown as temperature change in degrees Celsius per doubling of 
CO2 concentration (C/CO2X2), and as temperature change per radiation flux 
(C/W/m2). The last column shows the estimated global surface temperature change 
from pre-industrial time to now due to the human caused increase in atmospheric 
CO2 of 90 ppmv.

 The Miskolczi estimate is based on a 
greenhouse theory with energy constraints that fully determines the strength of 
the greenhouse effect. It predicts the increasing CO2 concentrations would 
reduce the quantity of water vapour in the upper troposphere. In fact, the water 
vapour relative humidity has declined 21% from 1950 to 2007 at 9 km 
altitude. 

 The Idso and Spencer estimates are based on 
temperature change observations, but do not take account of the effect of 
reduced water vapour in response to increasing CO2, and so are likely too high. 
(The Spencer article presents a climate sensitivity estimate of 8 W/m2/C, which 
is the reciprocal of the 0.125 C/W/m2 shown in the above 
table.) 

 The Schwartz and Chylek estimates both 
assume that the Sun has no effect on the temperature increase, and attributes 
the 20th century temperature change to CO2, modified by aerosols. This 
assumption greatly over-estimates the climate sensitivity due to CO2. The 
estimates also rely on the surface temperature record, which is contaminated by 
the urban heat island effect.  
 
 The IPCC determined climate 
sensitivity by two methods: 

 comparing short term temperature variation with the 
 radiation emission from the top of the atmosphere from satellite data, 
 and by interpreting indirect clues from the 
 geological record 

 Climate 
sensitivity estimates used by the IPCC assumed that observed 
temperature variability caused the observed cloud variability. 
But causation also flows in the opposite direction with cloud variability 
causing temperature variability. A temperature change caused by cloud 
variability would be incorrectly interpreted as a positive feedback. This 
error causes the estimates to have a built-in bias toward high climate 
sensitivity. We know that the Sun can cause a change in lower cloud cover which 
cause a temperature change. The IPCC does not consider possible climate change 
from the Sun as its mandate is to investigate man-made climate change. The analysis of indirect clues from the geological record is 
very uncertain. The IPCC 4AR give a range of climate sensitivity of 2 to 4.5 
C/W/m2, with a best estimate of 3 C/W/m2. 

 The following 
chart from a presentation by Dr. Richard Lindzen shows prediction results from a 
number of climate models and satellite data. The horizontal axis shows the 
change in sea surface temperatures per year as measured over various time 
intervals. The vertical axis is the change in outgoing longwave radiation at the 
top of the atmosphere as predicted by several climate 
models. 

 A positive 
correlation (slope from bottom left to top right) indicates that there is a 
negative feedback loop in SST change such that the hotter the sea gets the more 
heat is radiated away to space, which reduces the temperature rise. A negative 
correlation (slope from top left to bottom right) indicates that there is a 
positive feedback loop in that the atmosphere inhibits heat loss to space, which 
increases the temperature further. 

   

 The first 
correlation labeled ERBE is the actual data as measured by the Earth 
Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) satellite. The slope of the line indicates a 
strong negative feedback which offsets the initial temperature rise. The eleven 
other correlations are from climate models. They all show negative correlations 
corresponding to positive feedbacks, which amplifies the initial temperature 
rise. All the models have the feedback in the wrong direction, confirming that 
the models are fundamentally wrong. 

 In the following 
graph, each climate model&apos;s predicted climate sensitivity is plotted versus 
the slope of the correlations shown above, which correspond to the amount of the 
temperature feedback. The curved black line shows the relation between the 
feedback and the climate sensitivity to doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere. The large errors in the feedback factors cause a large range of 
predicted equilibrium climate sensitivities. The model results show the climate 
sensitivity could range from 1.3 degrees to over 5 degrees Celsius considering 
the range of feedback factors. But the ERBE satellite data tells a completely 
different story. It shows a climate sensitivity of 0.4 to 0.5 degrees Celsius. 
This small temperature change would not cause any problem and it there is no 
reason to be concerned about our CO2 emissions. See here or here for further information. 

 

 The ERBE determined climate 
sensitivity may be too high because it was calculated from short term 
temperature variations. It does not account for the long term reduction in water 
vapour content in the atmosphere as shown in the  Water Vapour Feedback  section, so the long term 
climate sensitivity may be even less than that indicated here. 


 The IPCC Hockey 
Stick 

The IPCC published the &quot;Hockey Stick&quot; graph from Mann, 
Bradley and Hughes (MBH 1998), in its Third Assessment Report, which shows 
little change in temperatures for hundreds of years then a sharp increase 
recently in the last hundred years. This temperature history was given bold 
prominence in the IPCC reports, distributed to all Canadian households and used 
to support major policy decisions involving the expenditure of billions of 
dollars. The IPCC argues that there was little natural climate change over the 
last 1000 years, so that the temperature change over the last 100 years is 
unusual and likely caused by human activities. A senior IPCC researcher said in 
an email &quot;We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.&quot; Christopher Monckton 
says &quot;They did this by giving one technique, measurement of tree-rings from 
bristlecone pines, 390 times more weighting than other techniques but didn&apos;t 
disclose this. Tree-rings are wider in warmer years, but pine tree rings are 
also wider when there&apos;s more carbon dioxide in the air: it&apos;s plant food. This 
carbon dioxide fertilization distorts the calculations. They said they had 
included 24 data sets going back to 1400. Without saying so, they left out the 
set showing the medieval warm period, tucking it into a folder marked &quot;Censored 
Data&quot;. They used a computer model to draw the graph from the data, but two 
Canadians [Ross McKitrick and Stephen McIntyre] later found that the model 
almost always drew hockey-sticks even if they fed in random, electronic &quot;red 
noise&quot; because it used a faulty algorithm.&quot; The MBH 1998 report was never 
properly peer reviewed before the IPCC used it in their publications. 
See here for comments from 
Christopher Monckton .

McKitrick and McIntyre say in their paper &quot;the 
dataset used to make this construction contained collation errors, unjustified 
truncation or extrapolation of source data, obsolete data, incorrect principal 
component calculations, geographical mislocations and other serious defects. 
These errors and defects substantially affect the temperature index. The major 
finding is that the values in the early 15th century exceed any values in the 
20th century. The particular hockey stick shape derived in the MBH98 proxy 
construction a temperature index that decreases slightly between the early 
15th century and early 20th century and then increases dramatically up to 1980 
is primarily an artefact of poor data handling, obsolete data and incorrect 
calculation of principal components.&quot; See here for 
their paper .

The IPCC hockey stick is shown below, along with the 
corrected version. The error ranges are not shown here.

 
The dispute over the hockey stick caused the 
United States Congress to decide to investigate the matter. The US National 
Research Council (NRC) held public hearings and prepared a report in 2006 for 
the US House of Representatives Committee on Science. The NRC Report made 
no criticism of the McKitrick and McIntyre papers. The report concludes 
&quot;strip-bark samples should be avoided in temperature reconstructions.&quot; These 
strip-bark Bristlecone/Foxtail samples are responsible for the sharp increase in 
the graph in the twentieth century, but the growth spurt is not related to 
temperatures. It also confirmed that Mann&apos;s algorithm, which used non-centered 
principal component analysis, mines for hockey stick shapes from random red 
noise data as previously shown by McKitrick and McIntyre, and notes that 
&quot;uncertainties of the published reconstructions have been underestimated.&quot;

Meanwhile, the US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and 
Commerce had independently commissioned a study from Edward Wegman who is 
chairman of the NAS Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics and a Fellow 
of the Royal Statistical Society. The Wegman Report states &quot;Overall, our 
committee believes that Manns assessments that the decade of the 1990s was the 
hottest decade of the millennium and that 1998 was the hottest year of the 
millennium cannot be supported by his analysis. It also states &quot;In general, we 
find the criticisms by [the McKitrick and McIntyre papers] to be valid and their 
arguments to be compelling. We were able to reproduce their results and offer 
both theoretical explanations (Appendix A) and simulations to verify that their 
observations were correct. The study also studied the social network of the 
group of scientists who publish temperature reconstructions. The study found 
that they collaborate with each other and share proxy data and methodologies, so 
that the &quot;independent&quot; studies are not independent at all. See the Wegman Report here .

Both 
of these reports were public six months before the IPCC began the release of the 
Fourth Assessment Report; however, the 4AR makes no mention of the Wegman 
Report, gives only one citation of the NRC Report, and ignores the findings and 
recommendations of the reports.

David Holland wrote a comprehensive 
history and discussion of the hockey stick affair. See Holland&apos;s paper - 
&quot;Bias and Concealment in the IPCC Process: The &apos;Hockey Stick&apos; Affair and its 
Implications&quot; published by &quot;Energy&amp;Environment&quot;, October 2007 here .

David 
Holland says &quot;it is scandalous that the WGI Chapter 6 authors ignored most of 
its [NRC Report] substantive findings. Despite the clear analysis in 
Wegman et al. showing the lack of independence between the various temperature 
reconstructions, the authors of AR4 WGI Chapter 6 persisted with their reliance 
on a spaghetti diagram of reconstructions in Figure 6.10(b) to continue to 
justify the claim that Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the 
second half of the 20th century were likely the highest in at least the past 
1,300 years.
  
 Urban Heat 
Island Effects 

The urban heat island effect is caused by 
the heat-retaining properties of concrete and asphalt in urban areas that 
artificially increase local temperatures. It is the effect that humans have on 
local surface temperature so that the temperatures in or near urban centres are 
warmer than rural areas.

                  Surface 
Temperature Trends in 47 California Counties 
 
This graph shows the size of the effect on surface temperatures 
and the problems associated with objective sampling. The surface temperature 
trends determined from ground stations for the period 1940 to 1996 were averaged 
for each county. The trends were grouped by county population and plotted as 
closed circles along with the standard errors of their means. The straight line 
is a least-squares fit to the closed circles. The points marked &apos;&apos;X&apos;&apos; are the 
six unadjusted station records selected by NASA GISS for use in their estimate 
of global temperatures. Note that 5 of the 6 selected stations are in populous 
counties. Note also that extrapolating the straight line to a county population 
of 10,000 gives a temperature trend of zero. See here .

Here 
is an example of a weather station used by 
the IPCC to record temperature rise.

                     Temperature Trends of Major City 
Sites and Rural Sites 
 















 Peterson 
(2003)  is an influential study cited by IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 
purporting to show that the urbanization effect is negligible.

The 
IPCC relied heavily on this flawed study, where Peterson states &quot;no 
statistically significant impact of urbanization could be found in annual 
temperatures.&quot; However, Steve McIntyre using Peterson&apos;s data shows that &quot;actual 
cities have a very substantial trend of over 2 deg C per century relative to the 
rural network - and this assumes that there are no problems with rural network - 
something that is obviously not true since there are undoubtedly microsite and 
other problems.&quot; Peterson uses two lists of stations in his study, one labelled 
Urban and one labelled Rural. However an analysis of the lists shows that the 
Urban list includes many rural sites and the Rural list includes many urban 
sites. These results are discussed in a Climate Audit article here .

Most scientist agree 
that many temperature station measurements are contaminated by urban heat island 
effects, but they argue that the major global temperature indexes are adjusted 
to correct for these effects. There is an &quot;Urbanization Adjustment&quot; to correct 
for the effects of urbanization, a &quot;Time of Observation Bias Adjustment&quot; to 
correct for changed to the time of day when measurements are taken, and there is 
a &quot;Coverage Adjustment&quot; to account for the loss of measurement stations. These 
adjustments are intended to produce a record of what the temperatures would be 
if nobody lived near the measurement stations. If the adjustments were adequate, 
there should be no statistically significant correlation between the temperature 
record and social economic indicators.

Ross McKitrick and Patrick 
Michaels published a paper in 2004 in which they analyse the pattern of warming 
over the Earth&apos;s land surface compared to local economic conditions. They found 
a statistically significant correlation between the adjusted temperature data 
and economic development, meaning that the adjustments are not adequate to 
remove the urban heat island effects. They conclude &quot;If the contamination were 
removed, we estimated the average measured warming rate over land would decline 
by about half.&quot;

Dutch meteorologists, Jos de Laat and Ahilleas Maurellis 
using different testing methodologies came to similar conclusions. They showed 
that there is a statistically significant correlation between the spacial 
pattern of warming in the adjusted temperature data and the spacial pattern of 
industrial development. They concluded it adds a large upward bias to the 
measured global warming trend. They also show that climate model predictions 
show no correlation between temperature and industrial development.

The 
IPCC acknowledges the correlation between the warming trends and social economic 
development, but dismisses it as a mere coincidence, due to unspecified 
atmospheric circulation changes. This nonsense claim contradict the IPCC 
widley advertised claim that recent warming can not be attributed to natural 
causes, and the Laat and Maurellis research shows it to be 
false.

McKitrick and Michaels published an updated paper in December 2007 
using a larger data set with a more complete set of socioeconomic indicators. 
They discussed two types of contamination; anthropogenic surface processes, 
which are changes to the landscaped due to urbanization or agriculture, and 
inhomogeneities, i.e. equipment changes, missing data, poor quality control, 
etc. They showed that the spatial pattern of warming trends is tightly 
correlated with indicators of economic activity. They present a battery of 
statistical tests to prove that the result is not a fluke or spurious 
correlation. They conclude &quot;The average trend at the surface in the post-1980 
interval would fall from about 0.30 degrees (C) per decade to about 0.17 
degrees.&quot; Removing the net warming bias due to urban heat effects in surface 
temperature data could explain as much as half the recent warming over 
land.

                            Bias of IPCC Temperature Data 
 
The graph above is from the McKitrick and Michaels 
December 2007 paper. Each square is colour-coded to indicate the size of the 
local bias. Blank areas indicate that there was no data available. See the 
Background Discussion on the paper here .
 
An audit by researcher Steve McIntyre reveals that NASA has made 
urban adjustments of temperature data in its GISS temperature record in the 
wrong direction. NASA has applied a &quot;negative urban 
adjustment&quot; to 45% of the urban station measurements (where adjustments are 
made), meaning that the adjustments make the warming trends steeper. The urban adjustment is supposed to remove the effects of 
urbanization, but the NASA negative adjustments increases the urbanization 
effects. The result is that the surface temperature trend utilized by the 
International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is exaggerated. See here . 

The website www.surfacestations.org was created by 
Anthony Watts in response to the realization that very little physical site 
survey data exists for the entire United States Historical Climatological 
Network (USHCN) of surface stations. Volunteers do hands on site 
surveys to photograph and document all 1221 USHCN climate stations in the USA. 
As of February 2009, 854 of 1221 stations have been examined in the USHCN 
network. Each site is assigned a site quality rating 1 through 5 based on the 
Climate Reference Network Rating Guide. Only 11% of stations are in suitable 
locations, 69% are within 10 m of an artificial heat source. Below is a picture 
of a poorly situated station.

  

 The graph &quot;Surface and Troposphere Temperature Trends&quot; 
presented in the Heating of the Troposphere section of this essay shows 
temperature trends of the land, of the land and sea, and of the troposphere in 
the tropics. The land surface temperature trend has the highest rate of increase 
because it is contaminated by the heat island effect. The land and sea surface 
temperature trend is lower than the land trend because the sea temperature data 
does not have any heat island effect. The troposphere shows the lowest rate of 
temperature increase. We know that the CO2 theory of climate change requires the 
troposphere to warm faster than the surface, but the opposite has happened. It 
is illogical to believe that CO2 is the primary temperature driver and 
concurrently believe that the surface measurements used to the IPCC are 
accurate. If the surface temperature data were fully adjusted to remove the 
effects of urbanization by reducing the warming rate by half, it would closely 
match the troposphere warming trend.

 
 Falsified Historical CO2 
Measurements 

The 
IPCC uses a CO2 concentration history that shows a low pre-industrial CO2 
content which increases during the industrial era. The IPCC may have used 
corrupted CO2 data in its analysis of climate change. Their conclusions and 
projections of climate change are all based on the assumption of low CO2 
concentrations in the pre-industrial atmosphere based on ice core studies. 
Unfortunately, ice cores do not form a closed system. In the highly compressed 
deep ice, CO2 combines with liquid water to form gas hydrates, or clathrates, 
which are tiny crystals. When the ice core is brought to the surface, the 
pressure falls causing the clathrates to decompose to the gas form, exploding in 
the process as if they were microscopic grenades, forming tiny cracks in the 
ice. Other cracks are formed by the ice decompression. Gas escapes through these 
cracks as the ice core is brought to the surface, but since CO2 forms clathrates 
at lower pressures than other gases, CO2 is preferentially lost leading to 
depletion of CO2 in the gas trapped in the ice core. Consequently, the measured 
CO2 concentration from deep ice cores is less than the CO2 concentration of the 
originally trapped air.

 








The graph on the left shows the 
IPCC history of CO2 concentration in air.





Data from 
shallow ice cores such as from Siple, Antarctica, show that the CO2 
concentration of pre-industrial ice (from depths too shallow for clathrate 
formation) are much higher than that measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii in 
1960. 


  Actual Siple, Antarctica Ice Core and Mauna Loa Data 
 







Note that the measured 
concentration declines with increasing load pressure and 
depth.





 Shifted Siple, Antarctica Ice Core and Mauna 
Loa Data 
 




 As the 
actual measurements show ice deposited in 1890 AD is 328 ppm, not the 290 ppm 
required to fit the IPCC human caused increasing CO2 concentration and global 
warming hypothesis, the average age of air was arbitrarily decreed to be exactly 
83 years younger than the ice in which it was trapped.

The corrected 
ice data were then smoothly aligned with the Mauna Loa record, and reproduced in 
countless publications as a famous Siple curve. Only thirteen years later, in 
1993, glaciologists attempted to prove experimentally the age assumption, but 
they failed.



       CO2 
Measurements between 1800 and 1955 
 





IPCC modellers ignored the direct 
measurements of CO2 concentration indicating that the 19th century CO2 
concentration was 335 ppm.

The encircled values were arbitrarily selected 
by Callendar for estimation of 292 ppm as the average 19th century CO2 
concentration.

from Holocene lake deposits in Denmark, showing that 9400 years ago CO2 
atmospheric level was 333 ppm, and 9600 years ago 348 ppm, falsify the concept 
of stabilized and low CO2 air concentration until the advent of industrial 
revolution.
See here for more 
information .

Recently, Ernst-Georg Beck has summarized 90,000 
accurate chemical analysis of CO2 in air since 1812. The historic chemical data 
reveal that changes in CO2 track changes in temperature, and therefore climate 
in contrast to the simple, monotonically increasing CO2 trend depicted in the 
post 1990 literature on climate change. Since 1812, the CO2 concentration in 
northern hemispheric air has fluctuated exhibiting three high level maxima 
around 1825, 1857 and 1942 the latter showing more than 400 ppm.

 








Between 1857 and 1958, the 
Pettenkofer process was the standard analytical method for determining 
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and usually achieved accuracy better than 3%. 
These determinations were made by several scientists of Nobel Prize level 
distinction. Following Callendar (1938), modern climatologists have generally 
ignored the historic determinations of CO2, despite the techniques being 
standard textbook procedures in several different disciplines. Chemical methods 
were discredited as unreliable choosing only few which fit the assumption of a 
climate CO2 connection.

Ernst-Georg Beck calls the falsification of the 
CO2 record &quot;The greatest scandal in the modern history of science&quot;.

 No 
Consensus 

Author Michael Crichton warned of the dangers of 
&quot;consensus science&quot; in a 2003 speech. He says &quot;Consensus is the business of 
politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens 
to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by 
reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is 
relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great 
precisely because they broke with the consensus.&quot;

In an open letter to 
Prime Minister Stephen Harper, 61 prominent scientists called for an open 
climate science review. The letter states &quot;Observational evidence does not 
support today&apos;s computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust 
model predictions of the future. Significant advances have been made since the 
protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern about 
increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know 
today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would 
have concluded it was not necessary. Global climate changes all the time due to 
natural causes and the human impact still remains impossible to distinguish from 
this natural &quot;noise.&quot;&quot;

The Petition Project was organized by the Oregon 
Institute of Science and Medicine.
The petition states in 
part:
 &quot;There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of 
carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the 
foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth&apos;s atmosphere and 
disruption of the Earth&apos;s climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific 
evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial 
effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.&quot;

So 
far (May 2009) the petition has received 31,478 signatures. Signatories are 
approved for inclusion in the Petition Project list if they have obtained formal 
educational degrees at the level of Bachelor of Science or higher in appropriate 
scientific fields. All of the listed signers have formal educations in 
fields of specialization that suitably qualify them to evaluate the research 
data related to the petition statement. Many of the signers currently work in 
climatological, meteorological, atmospheric, environmental, geophysical, 
astronomical, and biological fields directly involved in the climate change 
controversy. See here .

The Heartland 
Institute has conducted an international survey of 530 climate scientists in 
2003. The survey asked if the current state of scientific knowledge is 
developed well enough to allow for a reasonable assessment of the effects of 
greenhouse gases. Two-thirds of the scientists surveyed (65.9 percent) 
disagreed with the statement, with nearly half (45.7 percent) scoring it with a 
1 or 2, indicating strong disagreement. Only 10.9 percent scored it with a 6 or 
7, indicating strong agreement. See here for the full survey 
results .

In an Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations, and the head of states of many nations dated December 13, 2007, titled 
&quot;UN Climate Conference Taking the World in Entirely the Wrong Direction&quot;, more 
than 100 specialists from around the world, many who are leading scientists, 
state that &quot;It is not possible to stop climate change, a natural phenomenon that 
has affected humanity through the ages.&quot; The letter states than recent climate 
changes have been well with-in the bounds of known natural variability. It 
further states that climate models can not predict climate, that there has been 
no global warming since 1998, that the IPCC has ignored much significant new 
peer-reviewed research that has cast even more doubt on the hypothesis of 
dangerous human-caused global warming, and attempts to cut emissions will slow 
development, and is likely to increase human suffering from future climate 
change rather than to decrease it. See here for the letter as published by the National Post.

A report to the US 
Senate lists 400 qualified scientists from around the world who dispute the 
claims by IPCC and others, that &quot;climate science is settled&quot; and that there is a 
&quot;consensus&quot;. See here .

There 
is no consensus on whether or to what degree human activities are causing the 
problem, or even whether there is a problem. Global cooling, widely predicted 
in the 1970s, would have been much more dangerous than warming.
 
 Effects of 
Warming 
 
The IPCC and related groups have suggested several 
adverse effects of global warming. Real world data shows that these claims are 
mostly false. They ignore the huge benefits of warming and of CO2 emissions on 
plant growth.
 
     Global Sea 
Level Rise 

There has been no change in the rate of sea level 
rise in the last 100 years as shown below.
              Sea Level 
Data 
 






 

 



Mean global sea level (gsl) (top), with its shaded 95% confidence 
interval, and mean gsl rate (bottom), with its shaded standard error interval. 
Adapted from Jevrejeva et al. (2006). See here from 
CO2science .

The IPCC AR4 estimates that &quot;Global average sea level 
rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The 
rate was faster over 1993 to 2003, about 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm per year.&quot; It also 
states &quot;There is high confidence that the rate of observed sea level rise 
increased from the 19th to the 20th century.&quot;


Since August 1992 the satellite altimeters have been measuring sea level on a 
global basis. The University of Colorado at Boulder provides data from a series 
of satellites. Tide gauge calibrations are used to estimate altimeter drift. The 
global sea level rise with the seasonal signal removed is shown here . It 
shows a trend from 1992 thru March 2009 of 3.1 mm/year. Below are graphs of 
global, Pacific ocean and Atlantic ocean sea levels, with trends from 
January 2004 to March 2009, seasonal signals included.

 

 

 

Note that there has been a significant flattening of the trend since 2004. 
The global sea level rise since January 2004 of 1.52 mm/year is less than 
half of the overall trend from 1992 of 3.1 mm/year. The trends since January 
2004 of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans are 0.15 mm/year and 0.37 mm/year, 
respectively. The slowing of the sea level rise is consistent with the current 
lack of global warming.

Dr. Nils-Axel Morner, who has spent a lifetime in the study of sea levels, 
says There is a total absence of any recent acceleration in sea level rise as 
often claimed by IPCC and related groups.. Read his fascinating interview &quot; Claim That Sea Level 
Is Rising Is a Total Fraud &quot; June 22, 2007 EIR Economics 33.

Dr. 
Morner says the global sea level has been rising at 1.1 mm/year from 1850 to 
about 1940, then no increase to 1970. The IPCC uses a tide gauge in Hong Kong 
that shows 2.3 mm/year of sea level rise. The tide gauge is located where the 
land is known to be subsiding, so the record should not be used. Satellite 
altimetry data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission measures the sea level relative 
to the centre of the Earth (rather than relative to the coast) since 1992.


                  Satellite altimetry of 
TOPEX/POSEIDON 
 
The graph above 
from Morner, 2004, shows the original satellite sea level data from 1992 to 
early 2000. Other than the effect of the 1997/98 El Nino, the data shows no sea 
level rise.

The satellite data shows no increase, but the IPCC adds a 
&quot;correction factor&quot; to the satellite data to make it agree with the tide gauge 
data at 2.3 mm/year. This data is presented as satellite data, but Morner says 
&quot;it is a falsification of the data set&quot;.

              Satellite Altimetry Data 
of TOPEX/POSEIDON Tilted Back to Original Level 
 
The graph above from Morner, 2005, shows the satellite 
altimetry sea level data from 1993 to 2003 tilted back to the original level by 
excluding the tide-gauge factor. It shows variability around zero plus ENSO 
events.

See here 
for Dr. Morner&apos;s Memoradum paper , which was presented to the United 
Kingdom&apos;s House of Lords.

Satellite altimetry Topex/Poseidon data is 
adjusted by the University of Colorado for NASA to match the rate of sea level 
rise measured by a set of 64 tide gauges. Any difference between the raw 
satellite measurement and the tide gauge measurement is assumed to be the sum of 
satellite measurement drift error and the vertical land movement at the tide 
gauge location. A separate estimate of the land movement is made mainly by using 
&quot;doppler orbitography and radiopositioning integrated by satellite&quot; (DORIS) data 
at the tide gauge location. The raw satellite data is tilted by applying the 
satellite measurement drift as determined by the tide gauges. See here  and here for a description of how satellite data is calibrated from a set of tide 
gauges.

 

The graph above shows the sea level trends from January 2002 to April 2011. 
Note that most of the sea level rise in this period is located in an area north 
of Australia. The average of five tide gauge stations&apos; trends from the 
north coast of Australia using annual data is 17.7 mm/year from 2002 to 
2009. However, the tropical Pacific ocean sea level was decreasing at up to 16 
mm/year.

A famous tree in the Maldives shows no evidence of having been 
swept away by rising sea levels, as would be predicted by the global warming 
advocates. A group of Australian global-warming advocates came along and pulled 
the tree down, destroying the evidence that their theory was false.

The 
&quot;INQUA Commission on Sea-Level Change and Coastal Evolution&quot; led by Dr. Morner, 
prepared as estimate that the global sea level will rise 10 cm plus or minus 10 
cm in the next 100 years. Dr. Morner has since revised his estimate to 5 cm per 
100 years after considering data of the Sun activity suggesting that the warming 
trend may have ended and the Earth may be headed into a cooling trend.

It 
seems increasingly likely that a warming will increase precipitation and ice 
accumulation in the Polar Regions, and thus slow down or even reverse the 
ongoing sea level rise.
See here update 10.

The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of 
sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. 
This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 
1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.
See here for an analysis of sea level rise by the Proudman Oceanographic 
Laboratory. The following graph shows the rate of sea level change since 
1905 using the highest quality long record tide gauges.

  
Comparison of the global mean rates of sea level change 
calculated from nine long-record stations with those calculated from 177 
stations averaged into 13 regions. The shaded region indicates 1 S.E. These records are from regions which do not experience high rates of Glacial 
Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) and which are not significantly affected by 
earthquakes. The comparison shows that over the common period of the two 
analyses (1955-1998) there is very strong agreement between the two global 
means.


Wppelmann et al used global positioning satellite (GPS) stations to correct 
tide gauge data for vertical land movements. In a 2007 paper, Wppelmann et al 
analyzed data from 160 GPS stations that were within 15 km of tide gauges to 
determine the vertical movement of the tide gauges. They determined that the 
global average sea-level rise from January 1999 to August 2005, after correcting 
the tide gauge data by the vertical land movement, was 1.31 +/- 0.30 mm/year. 
Note that this estimate is 58% less than the estimate reported (1993 - 2003) in 
the IPCC AR4. See here from World Climate Report, and the study abstract here .

The movie &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; (AIT) suggests that the Antarctic ice sheet 
could melt, but in fact the temperature of Antarctica has been declining over 
the last 25 years by 0.11 Celsius per decade. There has been no significant 
melting during previous warm periods when temperatures were warmer than 
today.

           Antarctica Temperatures 1979 - 2006 MSU Data Set (Latitude -90 to 
-70) 
 








This graph was created from the 
MSU Data from www.CO2Science.org.

Antarctica ice sheet has been growing 
in thickness by 5 mm/year (1992 to 2003) according to a recent mass balance 
study. This net extraction of water from the global ocean, according to Wingham 
et al., occurs because &quot;mass gains from accumulating snow, particularly on the 
Antarctic Peninsula and within East Antarctica, exceed the ice dynamic mass loss 
from West Antarctica.&quot;





A similar story is found in 
Greenland. The warmest period was not the last quarter century. Rather, as 
Vinther et al. report, &quot;the warmest year in the extended Greenland temperature 
record was 1941, while the 1930s and 1940s were the warmest decades.&quot; In fact, 
their newly-lengthened record reveals there has been no net warming of the 
region over the last 75 years. A study of the Greenland ice sheet by Johannessen 
et al. found that below 1500 meters, the mean change of ice sheet height with 
time was a decline of 2.0 0.9 cm/year, qualitatively in harmony with the 
statements of Alley et al.; but above 1500 meters, there was a positive growth 
rate of fully 6.4 0.2 cm/year. Averaged over the entire ice sheet, the mean 
result was also positive, at a value of 5.4 0.2 cm/year, which when adjusted 
for an isostatic uplift of about 0.5 cm/year yielded a mean growth rate of 
approximately 5 cm/year, for a total increase in the mean thickness of the 
Greenland Ice Sheet of about 55 cm over the 11-year period, which was primarily 
driven by accumulation of increased snowfall over the ice sheet.

A 
recent study 
by Zwally et al. 2007 found the Greenland ice sheet have experienced a net 
accumulation of ice which is producing a 0.03 0.01 mm/year decline in 
sea-level.


 
    Severe 
Weather 

The IPCC claims that global warming will result in 
more severe weather. This doesn&apos;t make any sense, as most storms are caused by a 
difference in temperatures of colliding air masses. If CO2 warms the Polar 
Regions there will be smaller temperature differences, and less severe storms. 
All other things being equal, a warmer world should have fewer, not more, severe 
storms.

Unlike most storms, hurricanes are caused by difference in 
temperatures between the sea surface and the storm top.

Researchers 
Knutson and Tuleya examined a suite of climate models and found that they 
virtually unanimously projected that in a CO2-enhanced world, the middle and 
upper troposphere will warm at a faster rate than the surface, especially over 
the tropical oceans. More warming aloft than at the surface makes the atmosphere 
more stable and less conducive to storm formation. Thus, Knutson and Tuleya 
reported that the model-projected vertical stability increases in the future 
would temper (but not totally cancel out) the increase in storm intensity by 
rising sea surface temperature.

However, researchers Vecchi and Soden 
found that the climate models almost unanimously project that there will be an 
increase in the vertical wind shear during the hurricane season which also acts 
to inhibit tropical cyclone formation. The combined result is that any increase 
in hurricane intensity will be so small as to be undetectable. 
Incidentally, the actual vertical wind shear of Atlantic hurricanes have been 
declining since 1973, the opposite of the trend predicted by the climate models. 
See here .

There is absolutely no evidence of increasing severe storm events in the 
real world data. Here is a graph of hurricane intensity for the USA.
 

For the North Atlantic as a whole, according 
to the World Meteorological Organization, &quot;Reliable data ... since the 1940s 
indicate that the peak strength of the strongest hurricanes has not changed, and 
the mean maximum intensity of all hurricanes has decreased.&quot;

Gulev, et al 
(2000) employed NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data since 1958 to study the occurrence of 
winter storms over the northern hemisphere. They found a statistically 
significant (at the 95% level) decline of 1.2 cyclones per year for the period, 
during which temperatures reportedly rose in much of the 
hemisphere.

&quot;Global warming causes increased storminess&quot; makes for 
interesting headlines. It also violates fundamental scientific truth and the 
lessons of history.

Global hurricane activity has decreased to the lowest level in 32 years. The 
Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is the combination of a storm&apos;s intensity and 
longevity. See here .

 

The graph above shows the last 4-decades of Global and Northern Hemisphere 
ACE through June 30, 2011. Global hurricane activity has continued to sink to 
levels not seen since the 1970s. Note that the year indicated represents the 
value of ACE through the previous 24-months for the Northern Hemisphere (bottom 
line/gray boxes) and the entire global (top line/blue boxes). The area in 
between represents the Southern Hemisphere total ACE.

 

The graph above shows the la st 4-decades of Global Tropical Storm and Hurricane frequency 
12-month running sums through June 30, 2011. The top time series is the number 
of tropical cyclones that reach at least tropical storm strength 
(maximum lifetime wind speed exceeds 34-knots). The bottom time series is the 
number of hurricane strength (64-knots+) tropical cyclones. The global frequency 
of tropical cyclones has reached a historical low.

During the past 60 years Northern Hemisphere ACE undergoes significant 
interannual variability but exhibits no significant statistical trend. The 
northern hemisphere 2008 ACE was 85% of the 2005 ACE as shown in the stacked bar 
chart below.
 
 

Most thunderstorms occur in the tropics, but most tornatoes occur 
in the USA. Less than 1% of thunderstorms in the USA spawn tornadoes. Tornadoes 
requires directional wind shear, a change of wind direction with height. Wind 
shear occurs when cold and warm air masses collide. This never happens in the 
tropics so tornadoes never occur there. The graph below shows that the averate 
USA temperatures have increased since 1960 while the number of strong (F3 to F5) 
tornadoes have declined. See here from Dr. Roy Spencer.

An outbreak of tornadoes in 2011 in the USA was caused by 
unseasonably cold spring weather. Dr. Spencer writes &quot;An unusually warm Gulf of 
Mexico of 1 or 2 degrees right now cannot explain the increase in contrast 
between warm and cold air masses which is key for tornado formation because that 
slight warmth cannot compete with the 10 to 20 degree below-normal air in the 
Midwest and Ohio Valley which has not wanted to give way to spring yet. ... 
global warming causes FEWER tornado outbreaksnot more.&quot;

 

Dr. Indur M. Goklany prepared a study which examines whether 
losses due to such events (as measured by aggregate deaths and death rates) have 
increased globally and for the United States in recent decades. It puts these 
deaths and death rates into perspective by comparing them with the overall 
mortality burden, and briefly discuss what trends in these measures imply about 
human adaptive capacity. Globally, mortality and mortality rates have declined 
by 95 percent or more since the 1920s. The largest improvements came from 
declines in mortality due to droughts and floods, which apparently were 
responsible for 93 percent of all deaths caused by extreme events during the 
20th Century. See here .

The most telling graph is the first one in the paper below:

 

The chart displays data on aggregate global mortality and mortality 
rates between 1900 and 2006 for the following weather-related extreme events: 
droughts, extreme temperatures (both extreme heat and extreme cold),floods, 
slides, waves and surges, wild fires and windstorms of different types (e.g., 
hurricanes, cyclones, tornados, typhoons, etc.). It indicates that both death 
and death rates have declined at least since the 1920s. Specifically, comparing 
the 1920s to the 20002006 period, the annual number of deaths declined from 
485,200 to 22,100 (a 95 percent decline), while the death rate per million 
dropped from 241.8 to 3.5 (a decline of 99 percent).
 
    Warming is Good 
for Your Health 

 The health benefits of a warmer planet 
are many times greater than any harmful effect . The positive health effects of heat have been well 
documented over the past quarter century. The early studies of Bull (1973) 
and Bull and Morton (1975a,b) in England and Wales, for example, demonstrated 
that even normal changes in temperature are typically associated with inverse changes in death rates, especially in older people. That 
is, when temperatures rise , death rates fall , while when 
temperatures fall , death rates rise .

Speculations on the 
potential impact of continued warming on human health often focus on 
mosquito-borne diseases. Elementary models suggest that higher global 
temperatures will enhance their transmission rates and extend their geographic 
ranges. However the histories of three such diseases - malaria, yellow 
fever, and dengue - reveal that climate has rarely been the principal 
determinant of their prevalence or range. Human activities and their impact on 
local ecology have generally been much more significant. It is therefore 
inappropriate to use climate-based models to predict future prevalence.
 
    Warming Effects on 
Animals
 
As indicated previously, both higher temperatures 
and CO2 concentrations enhance plant growth, especially for trees. This 
increases the habitat available for many animals. The bulk of scientific studies 
show an increase in biodiversity almost everywhere on Earth that is not 
restricted by habitat destruction in response to global warming and atmospheric 
CO2 enrichment.

The global warming alarmist has picked the polar bear as 
its poster animal. Time magazine has told its readers that they should be 
worried about polar bear extinction. The data however, does not support reasons 
for concern. In the Baffin Bay region between North America and Greenland, 
temperatures have been declining and the polar bear population has 
declined. In the Beauford Sea region the temperature has increased and so 
has the polar bear population. In other areas the polar bear population has been 
stable. So the trend of polar bear populations relative to temperature have been 
opposite to what Time would lead its readers to believe.

There has been 
recent warming in the western arctic as a result of the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation, which periodically shifts the climate in the western arctic by 
changing ocean currents. These cycles have occurred over thousands of years. No 
evidence exists that suggests that both polar bears and the conservation systems 
that regulate them will not adapt and respond to the new conditions. Polar bears 
have persisted through many similar climate cycles. See here for an article by Dr. Mitchell Taylor, 
Polar Bear Biologist.
 
 Kyoto Protocol - Misallocation of 
Funds 

Of all the major problems of the world, climate 
change is one of the least important because funds spent to reduce CO2 emissions 
will have an insignificant effect on climate. Computer model projections show 
that full implementation of the Kyoto Protocol may result in temperature 
reduction of an undetectable 0.06 Celsius by 2050 at a cost of about 
$1,000,000,000,000 US. See here . (This estimate assumes 
the sun has no effect on climate. Since the sun has a major effect, the 0.06 
Celsius estimate is likely high by a factor of 2 or more.)

The Copenhagen Consensus (directed by 
environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg) analysed the major challenges facing the world 
and produced a prioritized list of opportunities responding to those challenges. 
Submission by 24 United Nations ambassadors and other senior diplomats were 
reviewed by economists and determined that the top priority for addressing major 
world challenges would be given to communicable diseases, sanitation and water, 
malnutrition, and education. Ranked toward the bottom of the 40-category list 
were issues relating to climate change and the Kyoto Protocol.
 
 An Inconvenient 
Truth 

Al Gore&apos;s movie &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; (AIT) is 
grossly misleading about climate change. Nearly every major statement made in 
the movie is one-sided, exaggerated, or plainly false. This movie has had a 
large effect on public opinion even though most scientists agree it is 
misleading.

Some of the problems with AIT are:

Implies that, 
during the past 650,000 years, changes in carbon dioxide levels largely caused 
changes in global temperature, whereas the causality mostly runs the other way, 
with CO2 changes trailing global temperature changes by hundreds to thousands of 
years. Never mentions that global temperatures were warmer than the present 
during each of the past four interglacial periods, even though CO2 levels were 
lower.

Presents images showing what 20 feet of sea level rise would do to 
the worlds major coastal communities. There is no credible evidence of an 
impending collapse of the great ice sheets. We do have fairly good data on ice 
mass balance changes and their effects on sea level. NASA scientist Jay Zwally 
and colleagues found a combined Greenland/Antarctica ice loss sea level rise 
equivalent of 0.05 mm per year during 1992-2002. At that rate, it would take a 
full century to raise sea level by just 5 mm.

Presents the hockey stick 
reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere temperature history used by the IPCC, 
according to which the 1990s were likely the warmest decade of the past 
millennium. It is now widely acknowledged that the hockey stick was built on a 
flawed methodology and inappropriate data.

Assumes a linear relationship 
between CO2 levels and global temperatures, whereas the actual CO2-warming 
effect is logarithmic, meaning that the next 100 ppm increase in CO2 levels adds 
only half as much heat as the previous 100 ppm increase.

Claims that the 
rate of global warming is accelerating, whereas the rate has been constant for 
the past 30 years to 2002roughly 0.17C per decade, and no warming from 2002 
through 2006.

Claims that Lake Chad in Northern Africa is drying up due 
to global warming. The lake is the water source for 20 million people, and it 
has an average depth of only 1.5 to 4.5 meters. It has actually been dry 
multiple times in the past: in 8500 BC, 5500 BC, 2000 BC and 100 BC. The lake 
has shrunk in size due to a rapidly expanding population drawing water from the 
lake, the introduction of irrigation technologies and local overgrazing. These 
causes are neither global nor warming, and are utterly independent of CO2. In 
addition, Africa as a continent experienced a dramatic shift towards dryer 
weather in the end of the 19th century that is not generally attributed to 
CO2.

Distracts views from the main hurricane problem facing the United 
States: the ever-growing concentration of population and wealth in vulnerable 
coastal regions, which is partly a consequence of federal flood insurance and 
other political subsidies.

Blames global warming for the decline since 
the 1960s of the emperor penguin population in Antarctica, implying that the 
penguins are in peril, their numbers dwindling as the world warms. In fact, the 
population declined in the 1970s and has been stable since the late 
1980s.

Never explains why anyone should be alarmed about the current 
Arctic warming, considering that our stone-age ancestors survivedand likely 
benefited fromthe much stronger and longer Arctic warming known as the Holocene 
Climate Optimum.

Presents one climate models projection of increased 
U.S. drought as authoritative even though another leading model forecasts 
increased wetness. Climate model hydrology forecasts on regional scales are 
notoriously unreliable. Most of the United States, outside the Southwest, became 
wetter during 1925-2003.

Blames global warming for the record number of 
typhoons hitting Japan in 2004. Local meteorological conditions, not average 
global temperatures, determine the trajectory of particular storms, and data 
going back to 1950 show no correlation between North Pacific storm activity and 
global temperatures.

Claims that global warming endangers polar bears 
even though polar bear populations are increasing in Arctic areas where it is 
warming and declining in Arctic areas where it is cooling. In fact 11 of the 13 
main groups in Canada are thriving, and there is evidence that the only groups 
that are not thriving are in a region of the Arctic that has cooled. Polar bears 
have survived the Holocene Climate Optimum and the Medieval Warm Period, both 
periods were significantly warmer than today&apos;s climate.

Warns that a 
doubling of pre-industrial CO2 levels to 560 ppm will so acidify sea water that 
all optimal areas for coral reef construction will disappear by 2050. This is 
not plausible. Coral calcification rates have increased as ocean temperatures 
and CO2 levels have risen, and todays main reef builders evolved and thrived 
during the Mesozoic Period, when atmospheric CO2 levels hovered above 1,000 ppm 
for 150 million years and exceeded 2,000 ppm for several
million 
years.

Blames global warming for the resurgence of malaria in Kenya, even 
though several studies have found no climate link and attribute the problem to 
decreased spraying of homes with DDT and anti-malarial drug 
resistance.

Claims that 2004 set an all-time record for the number of 
tornadoes in the United States. Tornado frequency has not increased; rather, the 
detection of smaller tornadoes has increased. If we consider the tornadoes that 
have been detectable for many decades (category F-3 or greater), there actually 
has been a downward trend since 1950.

Cites Tuvalu, Polynesia, as a place 
where rising sea levels force residents to evacuate their homes. In reality, sea 
levels at Tuvalu fell during the latter half of the 20th century and even during 
the 1990s.

Neglects to mention that global warming could reduce the 
severity of winter stormsalso called frontal storms because their energy comes 
from colliding air masses (fronts)by decreasing the temperature differential 
between colliding air masses.

Ignores the large role of natural 
variability in Arctic climate, never mentioning either that Arctic temperatures 
during the 1930s equalled or exceeded those of the late 20th century, or that 
the Arctic during the early- to mid-Holocene was significantly warmer than it is 
today.

Ignores a study by University of Missouri professor Curt Davis 
that found an overall Antarctic ice mass gain during 1992-2003.

Neglects 
to mention that NASA satellites show an Antarctic cooling trend of 0.11C per 
decade since 1978.

Calls carbon dioxide the most important greenhouse 
gas. Water vapour and clouds are the leading contributors and account for over 
70% of the greenhouse effect.

Claimed that ice cap on Mt. Kilimanjaro is 
disappearing due to global warming, though satellite measurements show no 
temperature change at the summit.

The decision by the British government to distribute the film 
&quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; to schools has been the subject of a legal action. The 
British High Court found that the film was false or misleading in 11 respects.

In order for the film to be shown, the High Court ruled in October, 2007 
that teachers must make it clear to their students that:
  1.) The 
film is a political work and promotes only one side of the 
argument.
  2.) Nine inaccuracies have to be specifically 
drawn to the attention of school children.

The inaccuracies are listed here .


Al Gore and the IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Price &quot;for their efforts to 
build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to 
lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change&quot;. 
Irena Sendler was considered for the prize for saving 2500 children and infants 
from the Nazi Warsaw Ghetto and the extermination camps during World War II. She 
was not selected. See her story here .

 
 Warnings of Global 
Cooling 

Nigel 
Weiss, Professor Emeritus at the Department of Applied Mathematics and 
Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge says that throughout earth&apos;s 
history climate change has been driven by factors other than man: &quot;Variable 
behaviour of the sun is an obvious explanation,&quot; says Dr. Weiss, &quot;and there is 
increasing evidence that Earth&apos;s climate responds to changing patterns of solar 
magnetic activity.&quot; The sun&apos;s most obvious magnetic features are sunspots, 
formed as magnetic fields rip through the sun&apos;s surface. &quot;If you look back into 
the sun&apos;s past, you find that we live in a period of abnormally high solar 
activity,&quot; Dr. Weiss states. These hyperactive periods do not last long, 
&quot;perhaps 50 to 100 years, then you get a crash,&quot; says Dr. Weiss. &apos;It&apos;s a 
boom-bust system, and I would expect a crash soon.&quot;
 
In addition to 
the 11-year cycle, sunspots almost entirely &quot;crash,&quot; or die out, every 200 years 
or so as solar activity diminishes. When the crash occurs, the Earth can cool 
dramatically. These phenomenon, known as &quot;Grand minima,&quot; have recurred over the 
past 10,000 years, if not longer. In the 17th century, sunspots almost 
completely disappeared for 70 years. That was the coldest interval of the Little 
Ice Age, when New York Harbour froze, allowing walkers to journey from Manhattan 
to Staten Island, and when Viking colonies abandoned Greenland, a once verdant 
land that became tundra.
 
In contrast, when the sun is very active, 
such as the period we&apos;re now in, the Earth can warm dramatically. This was the 
case during the Medieval Warm Period, when the Vikings first colonized Greenland 
and when Britain was wine-growing country.
 
No one knows precisely 
when a crash will occur but some expect it soon, because the sun&apos;s polar field 
is now at its weakest since measurements began in the early 1950s. Some predict 
the crash within five years, and many speculate about its effect on global 
warming. Several authorities are now warning of global cooling because the sun 
has entered a quiet period.

A Russian Academy of Sciences report in 
August 2006 warns that global cooling could develop on Earth in 50 years and 
have serious consequences.

David Archibal presentation titled &quot; The Past 
and Future of Climate&quot; here presented to the Lavoisier Group&apos;s 2007 
Workshop in Melbourne, Australia, shows a forecast of global temperatures 
based on a detailed analysis of sunspot cycles. He expects the next sunspot 
cycle (24) to be weak resulting in the start of a long cooling trend. The 
forecast shows a 1.5 o C drop in global temperature from 2007 to 2025. 
He warns &quot;...this will have a large and negative effect on Canadian grain 
production...&quot;.

On July 1, 2008, the Space 
and Science Research Center , a solar research organization, issued a formal 
declaration on climate change: Global warming has ended - a new climate 
era of pronounced cold weather has begun.
