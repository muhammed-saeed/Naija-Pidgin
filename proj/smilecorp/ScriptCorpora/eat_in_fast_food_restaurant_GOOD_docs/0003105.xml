 Burger King 
 By TOM STIEGHORST Business Writer , March 23, 1994 By late this summer, Burger King should begin airing new television commercials in yet another attempt to light a fire under the burger-buying public.

 Home Of Whopper? Maybe Not Miami 
 ANTONIO FINS Business Writer , October 29, 1998 Burger King has hired a real estate firm to explore moving the hamburger chain&apos;s corporate headquarters out of its current Miami home. &quot;We see many advantages to remaining in South Florida, but, like any smart business, we will use this opportunity to evaluate all our options,&quot; CEO Dennis Malamatinas said in a statement.

 By TOM STIEGHORST, Business Writer , April 24, 1991 Burger King`s incompetence as a national franchiser has cost two owners of seven Broward County outlets more than $250,000, the franchisees charge in a federal lawsuit in Miami.

 John Tanasychuk: I&apos;ll pass on the Burger King bacon sundae 
 By John Tanasychuk and Sun Sentinel , June 14, 2012 Did Burger King really need to bring a bacon sundae to its menu board? Judging by the media attention this thing is getting, Burger King knew exactly what it was doing when it introduced the bacon sundae as part of its new barbecue-inspired summer menu.
