Restaurant Description
 For over 25 years we have been bringing you, our guests, our best family recipes. We are honored to serve you and continuously strive to bring you excellent and authentic New Mexican cuisine. Your feedback is always welcome at Frank&amp;Lupe&apos;s. We are a family and you are part of the Frank&amp;Lupe&apos;s family.
Frank&amp;Lupe&apos;s is as close to perfect TexMex cuisine in the Scottsdale area. The original Frank&amp;Lupe&apos;s in Socorro, NM. The AZ location is a little place that is tucked away amongst art galleries and off the beaten path of the typical tourist route in Scottsdale (corner of Indian School&amp;N. Marshall Way). Like most others have been introduced to Frank&amp;Lupe&apos;s, you will probably come across it&quot;by accident&quot;your first time and will go back every time you have a hankering for excellent Mexican food at reasonable prices. The service is really good and the outdoor seating area in the back is very comfortable and enjoyable. The chips are done there and made of corn. The food at Frank&amp;Lupe&apos;s Old Mexico is consistently tasty. The atmosphere is what you would expect in a TexMex joint. Get there early for lunch as it is usually busy - Keep the patio in mind for dining, especially in the nice weather!

  The locals love it, they must love BLAND food. I had steak tacos. Three measly strips on a tortilla with nothing else inside came on my plate. No taste to the food and overpriced. You are better off cooking at home or going to Del Taco if you want so
