Description:

 RELATED APPLICATIONS 

 [0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of PCT patent application
 number PCT/IB2009/000045 filed on 14 Jan. 2009, the content of which is
 incorporated in its entirety herein.

 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

 [0002] The present invention relates to a method and system for ordering,
 preparing, managing and pricing food and beverages.

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

 [0003] On the consumer side of the food retail industry, choice of which
 products are consumed depends on many factors and circumstances. Often,
 consumers rely on individual, &quot;subjective&quot; preferences for choosing what
 they eat or drink. Often, however, the choice depends on &quot;objective&quot;
 criteria, externally imposed. For example, many people base their
 everyday choices on specific medical needs, for example that of avoiding
 dairy products, due to an allergy. Diets, or controlled nutritional
 regimes, are also very popular among the public. However, conforming
 nutritional habits to diets or controlled nutritional regimes can be
 problematic. In other instances, consumers perform their choices on the
 basis of budgets, allowances or ability of purchase in general.

 [0004] On the supplier side of the food retail industry, suppliers have
 tried to facilitate consumer choice, or to influence consumer behaviour,
 in a number of manners, including by providing nutritional or other type
 of information regarding their products. For example, supermarkets sell
 ready-to-eat meals with labels listing their nutritional contents. It is
 known that ingredients must always be listed on the packaging of
 industrially produced food and beverage products, according to local
 legal requirements. Restaurants or fast food outlets have traditionally
 been less attentive at the problem of supplying food/beverage information
 to consumers, but they often allow a degree of flexibility to consumers
 at the moment of choosing a dish or meal unit for consumption (for
 example many sandwich shops allow the substitution of white bread with
 granary bread on items included in their menu, or pizza restaurants often
 allow personalization of pizzas by letting consumers choose their own
 toppings).

 [0005] From the above, it is clear that there is a degree of rigidity in
 the existing ways by which food and beverage products are produced and
 commercialised, both on the &quot;offer&quot; and on the &quot;demand&quot; sides of the
 business. Pre-packaged food and beverage products have often been seen as
 providing a response to the consumers&apos; need for information about the
 quality and quantity of the products that they consume. However, by
 definition, pre-packaged foods are not customisable, should they not
 fulfil a consumer&apos;s requirement. On the other side, many fast food
 outlets or restaurants have often tried to provide a response to the
 consumer&apos;s need for customization. However, it is known that fast food
 outlets and restaurants fail to provide adequate information about food
 and beverages selected or chosen by consumers. They also fail to respond
 quickly and efficiently to consumer customization requests.

 [0006] There is a need, therefore, to improve both the consumer and the
 retailer experiences leading to commercial transactions in the food
 retail industry. There is also a need to offer improved, advanced tools
 and methods for better matching the &quot;offer&quot; and the &quot;demand&quot; sides of the
 food retail business.

 [0007] It is thus an aim of the present invention to provide a system and a
 method for ordering, preparing, managing and pricing food and beverage
 products, which solve or at least mitigate the problems found in the art.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 

 [0170] The nutritional principle values for a predetermined amount of each
 food item are assumed herein to be known to those skilled in the art, and
 will not be indicated herein.

 [0171] The above being assumed and referring to FIG. 1, numeral 1 generally
 designates a system for calculating the nutritional value of at least one
 dish.

 [0172] The system 1 comprises an Internet station 2 of a user/consumer, a
 network connection 3, a point of sale 4, a server 5 in which a main
 processor 5A and a database of nutritional principles 5B are configured.
 It shall be noted that while the Internet station 2 may be the home or
 office of the user/consumer, such Internet station 2 may also be located
 at or near the point of sale 4. Particularly, the Internet station 3
 comprises all hardware and software elements required for displaying the
 data transmitted through the network connection 3 on a graphical
 interface. The network connection 3 is a TCP/IP based Internet
 connection.

 [0173] Preferably, the server 5 of the system 1 also incorporates: [0174] a first module 6 designed to store a plurality of records into the
 database 5B and retrieving such records in response to user/consumer
 requests transmitted through the Internet station 2; [0175] a second
 module 7 associated with the first module 6 and the main processor 5A,
 such second module 7 being designed to transmit a graphical element 13 to
 the Internet station 2.

 [0176] The first module 6 and the output module 7 can be implemented by a
 Web-based technology, such as Java, Flash languages and the like.

 [0177] Particularly, the first module 6 is designed to store a plurality of
 records into the database 5B and retrieving them in response to
 user/consumer requests transmitted through the Internet station 2.

 [0178] The second module 7 is designed to transmit the graphical element 13
 through the network connection 3 to the Internet station, for it to be
 displayed on the graphical interface of such Internet station. The
 graphical element 13 is processed by the processor 5A in response to
 user/consumer requests.

 [0179] In this embodiment, the records stored in the database 5B comprise: [0180] a plurality of food items A1, . . . , An, [0181] the value of at
 least one nutritional principle associated with each food item of said
 plurality of food items A1, . . . , An for a predetermined amount &quot;q&quot; of
 the food item, [0182] a plurality of dishes P1, Pn and at least one food
 item A1, . . . , An that can be associated with each dish of said
 plurality of dishes P1, Pn.

 [0183] Therefore, the records in the database 5B include the value of at
 least one nutritional principle associated with each food item of the
 plurality of food items A1, . . . , An for a predetermined amount &quot;q&quot; of
 the food item.

 [0184] For instance, also referring to FIG. 3, the records in the database
 5B may include: [0185] food item A1=milk, that can be associated with
 the dish P1, the values of nutritional principles VN (1, 1)=fats and VN
 (1, 2)=lipids calculated for the predetermined amount &quot;q&quot;, i.e. 1 g of
 milk; [0186] food item A2=cookies, that can be associated with the dish
 P1, the values of nutritional principles VN (2, 1)=fats and VN (2,
 3)=carbohydrates calculated for the predetermined amount q, i.e. 1 g of
 cookies; [0187] food item A3=strawberries, that can be associated with the
 dish P2, the values of nutritional principles VN (3, 1)=fats and VN (3,
 2)=lipids calculated for the predetermined amount &quot;q&quot;, i.e. 1 g of
 strawberries, etc.

 [0188] In other words, the records include both the dishes P1, Pn, with
 which the various food items A1, . . . , An are associated, and the
 values of the nutritional principles that form each food item A1, . . . ,
 An, such values of the nutritional principles being calculated for the
 amount &quot;q&quot; of one gram of the respective food item A1, . . . , An.

 [0189] In one embodiment, the graphical element 13 is representative of the
 summation of the nutritional value calculated for each food item A1, . .
 . , An of each selected dish P1, . . . , Pn as a function of the amount
 Qi selected by the user/consumer, to obtain in real time the summation of
 the nutritional value of the selected dish or dishes, as explained in
 greater detail with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.

 [0190] It shall be further noted that, once the user/consumer has selected
 the dish or dishes, the first module 6 and the second module 7 are
 operably designed to accept electronic payments and allow the dish or
 dishes to be collected at the point of sale 4.

 [0191] For this purpose, the point of sale 4 comprises an Internet station,
 which is designed to receive the data processed through the server 5.

 [0192] In this embodiment, the Internet station of the point of sale 4 is
 designed to both receive the selected dishes and check the payment status
 and manage the time of collection of these dishes by the user/consumer.

 [0193] Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown the flow chart of the method
 for calculating the nutritional value of at least one dish P1, . . . Pn.

 [0194] This method includes the steps of: [0195] selecting 8 at least one
 dish Pi from said plurality of dishes P1, . . . Pn, [0196] selecting 9 one
 or more food items Ai that can be associated with said at least one
 selected dish Pi, [0197] associating 10 an amount Qi with each selected
 food item Ai, if necessary [0198] accessing said database 5B to acquire
 the value of at least one nutritional principle associated with each
 selected food item Ai.

 [0199] This method comprises the additional steps of: [0200] calculating
 11 the nutritional value &quot;VNtoti&quot; as a function of the amount Qi of each
 food item Ai of each selected dish Pi, and [0201] displaying 14, for each
 nutritional principle, the graphical element 13 representative of the
 summation Î£i of the nutritional value calculated for each food item
 Ai of each selected dish Pi, step 12.

 [0202] Therefore, with this method the graphical element 13 may be used to
 display on the graphical interface, in real time, i.e. upon selection of
 the dishes, the food items and relevant amounts, the summation of the
 nutritional value calculated for each food item A1, . . . , An of each
 selected dish P1, . . . , Pn as a function of the amount Qi selected by
 the user/consumer.

 [0203] The method further includes the step of having the option of
 selecting additional dishes 15 and, in the affirmative case (YES branch),
 the steps 8 to 11 as described above are designed to be repeated. If the
 user/consumer does not want to add any additional dish (NO branch), the
 method proceeds to steps 12 and 14.

 [0204] Advantageously, also referring to FIG. 3, the graphical element 13
 comprises a plurality of sectors, each 13A of which defines an area 13B
 delimited by a perimeter 13C.

 [0205] In this embodiment, the area 13B of each sector 13A is associated
 with the value VNtoti of each nutritional principle calculated for each
 food item Ai of said at least one selected dish Pi. In other words, the
 area 13B of each sector 13A represents the sum of the total energy value
 VNtoti of one of the nutritional principles in the selected food item Ai
 of one or more of the selected dishes Pi. In one embodiment, the area 13B
 of each sector 13A may change according to the value of this sum, which
 means, for instance, that the higher the value of the calculated sum the
 greater the area 13B covered by the respective sector.

 [0206] Such change allows the user/consumer to assess at a glance the
 amount of nutritional principle for the selected amount Qi of the
 selected food item Ai.

 [0207] In one embodiment, the area 13B of each sector 13A of the graphical
 element 13 changes according to a linear function with the value of said
 sum. Otherwise, one sector of the plurality of sectors 13A of the
 graphical element may be arranged to change, whereas the other areas 13B
 of the remaining sectors have a fixed, constant and predetermined value.

 [0208] By this arrangement, the total content of certain nutritional
 principles in the selected dish Pi may be advantageously highlighted, to
 monitor those that are deemed to be more important for the diet of the
 user/consumer.

 [0209] Furthermore, the sectors 13A of the graphical element 13 are grouped
 close to each other so that a gap is provided between each pair of
 perimeters 13C. Such gap between the perimeters 13C is preferably less
 than one fifth of the value of the perimeter 13V of the sector 13A with
 the smallest area 13B. In other words, the spacing between the sectors
 13A that compose the graphical element 13 is less than 1/5 of the value
 of the perimeter of the sector with the smallest area, i.e. the sector
 13A that represents the minimum nutritional value, according to the
 selected amount Qi.

 [0210] In order to assist the user/consumer in determining the overall
 nutritional value VNtoti of each food item Ai of the selected dish Pi, an
 acronym representative of the nutritional principle (not shown) is
 displayed inside said perimeter 13C, i.e. within the area 13B of each
 sector of the plurality of sectors 13A.

 [0211] Furthermore, in a further step of the present method, for each
 nutritional principle, the nutritional value VNtoti of each food item Ai
 of each selected dish Pi is compared with a predetermined nutritional
 value of the same food item. If the nutritional value VNtoti is higher
 than the predetermined nutritional value, then the sector 13A of the
 graphical element 13 for such nutritional principle will be changed.

 [0212] For example, if the nutritional value VNtoti of the selected dish Pi
 is higher than the indicated Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), then the
 user/consumer will be promptly informed by an aesthetic characterization
 of the sector 13A associated with that nutritional principle which has,
 for instance, exceeded the suggested limits of the Recommended Daily
 Allowance.

 [0213] Such aesthetic characterization preferably consists in causing that
 sector to flash with a predetermined frequency to create a blinking
 effect.

 [0214] It shall be noted that while the plurality of sectors 13A of the
 graphical element 13 are embodied as circumferences, they might also be
 formed with other similar shapes.

 [0215] Still referring to FIG. 3, which shows a possible embodiment of the
 graphical element 13, the user/consumer is also allowed to choose from a
 plurality of dishes P1, . . . , P7, e.g. being part of breakfast, lunch
 and/or dinner. FIG. 3 shows that each dish P1, . . . , P7 is composed of
 one or more food items A1, . . . A9 which in turn contain at least one
 nutritional principle v1,1, . . . , v9,3.

 [0216] For instance, if for breakfast the user/consumer wishes to select: [0217] the dish P1, with which the food items A1, milk and A2, cookies,
 are associated, [0218] the dish P2, with which the food item A3,
 strawberries, is associated, and [0219] the dish P3, with which the food
 item A4, cornflakes, is associated, and wishes to set, for each food item
 A1, . . . A4, a given amount, Q1, . . . Q4 respectively, then the system
 will display the graphical element 13 through the output module 7.

 [0220] Each sector 13A of the graphical element 13 relates to the sum of
 the nutritional values

 [0221] VNtot calculated for each food item A1, A4 of the selected dishes
 P1, P2 and P3, as a function of the selected amount Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.

 [0222] Then, the system may calculate the nutritional value VNtot,
 considering that the storage module 6 has been used to save the values of
 the nutritional principles associated with each food item A1, . . . A4
 for a predetermined amount of the food item, in the records of the
 database 5B.

 [0223] For example, the overall value VNTOT1 of the nutritional principle
 VN1, such as fats, as exemplified in FIG. 3, for the selected dishes P1,
 P2 and P3 and as a function of the indicated amounts Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4,
 can be calculated using the following formula:

 VNTOT 1 = i Qi * VN ( i , 1 ) ##EQU00001##

 which means :

 VNTOT 2=Q1*VN(1,1)+Q2*VN(2,1)+Q3*VN(3,1)+Q4*VN(4,1)

 [0224] This also applies to the overall value of the other nutritional
 principles VN2, lipids, or VN3, carbohydrates, or VN4, proteins, etc.

 [0225] It should be noted that the calculation of the value VNTOTi of a
 general nutritional principle VNi may be also expressed for dishes Pi
 belonging to breakfast, lunch and/or dinner.

 [0226] In the remainder of this section, we will generally refer to &quot;Meals&quot;
 to indicate a set of dishes or food or beverage items or products that a
 user or purchaser wishes to order for consumption. &quot;Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Lunch&quot;
 and &quot;Dinner&quot;, as used in FIG. 3, are examples of &quot;Meals&quot;. We will also
 generally refer to &quot;Recipes&quot; to identify a single food or beverage unit
 or product or item that may be consumed alone or in conjunction with
 other units or items to form a &quot;Meal&quot;. Therefore, according to this
 definition of &quot;Recipes&quot;, the dishes P1, . . . Pn described above are
 examples of &quot;Recipes&quot;. Each &quot;Recipe&quot; is generally associated to a set of
 instructions for the preparation thereof, either by cooking or by
 assemblage (this latter term referring to mixing, stirring, coupling or
 any other operation not involving the use of heat). We will also
 generally refer to &quot;Ingredients&quot; to identify the individual components of
 each &quot;Recipe&quot;. Thus, according to this definition of &quot;Ingredients&quot;, the
 food items A1, . . . , An described above can be taken as examples of
 &quot;Ingredients&quot;. Further, the &quot;Ingredients&quot; category will be divided into
 &quot;Single Ingredients&quot; and &quot;Compound Ingredients&quot;, the former referring to
 unprocessed materials, for example as received by a supplier, for example
 row leaves of baby spinach, and the latter referring to materials that
 have been processed (in any of the ways detailed above) in a store,
 outlet or restaurant. Each &quot;Recipe&quot; can comprise one or more
 &quot;Ingredients&quot;. If more &quot;Ingredients&quot; are present in one &quot;Recipe&quot;, they
 will be assembled, cooked or prepared into the &quot;Recipe&quot; according to an
 associated set of instructions.

 [0227] In the following section the total quantities of &quot;Ingredients&quot; Qi,
 as described above are referred to. The nutritional values for a given
 quantity (for example 1 gram) of &quot;Ingredient&quot; VN(i, k) will also be
 referred to, as defined above, where the index &quot;i&quot; refers to the
 &quot;Ingredients&quot; and the index &quot;k&quot; refers to the nutritional principles
 (e.g. k=2 for lipids, k=3 for carbohydrates, etc . . . ), as illustrated
 in FIG. 3.

 [0228] FIG. 4A represents an embodiment of a system 1000 configured in
 accordance with the present invention. We will now describe in detail the
 system 1000, which in this instance is used to run, manage and operate a
 fast food retail outlet. It will be recognized, however, that the system
 1000 can be used in any kind of restaurant or food and beverages outlet,
 or other retail unit.

 [0229] The system 1000 involves the use of remote ordering devices as well
 as in-store ordering devices. To order a meal remotely, a user (or
 purchaser) has access to a user desktop 30, a user smart-phone 31 or a
 user laptop 32. The user desktop 30, smart-phone 31 and laptop 32 are all
 equipped with a web browser 33. The web browser 33 is capable of
 accessing Internet 34 content, as known by the public. The content
 accessed by remote users of the system 1000 is made available by a remote
 user interface 35, which interacts with a &quot;Front-Office Order Placement
 Engine&quot; (FOOPE) 40, which is the kernel of the system 1000, as it will be
 described later. The remote user interface 35 allows a customer to input
 an order remotely. To order a meal in-store, a user (or purchaser) has
 access to in-store user terminals 36, each comprising input and output
 devices which could be of any type known in the art. In this embodiment,
 the terminals 36 are equipped with touch-screens, which are particularly
 convenient for this purpose (the touch-screens are not shown in FIG. 4A).
 Alternatives to touch-screens are however possible, for example the input
 operations can be performed via ordinary mice or keypads, and the output
 operations can be performed via ordinary monitors or printers. The
 in-store terminals 36 are used to output content made available to them
 by an in-store user interface 38, which also interacts with the FOOPE 40,
 as shown in FIG. 4A. In this embodiment, the in-store user terminals 36
 display the content of the in-store user interface and are connected to
 the FOOPE by a Local Area Network (LAN) connection 37, but it is evident
 that other methods of connection could be used, for example via a
 Wireless LAN, as it is known in the art.

 [0230] The FOOPE 40 of the system 1000 shown in FIG. 4A is provided on a
 server programmed to execute a series of operations, as it will be
 described below. One or more programming languages are used for
 programming the operations performed by the FOOPE 40, for example &quot;C&quot;,
 &quot;C++&quot; or &quot;Visual Basic&quot;, as it is common in the art. Other
 object-oriented programming languages are also possible, especially
 because of their convenient handling of data by virtue of programming
 features like encapsulation and inheritance. Further, the FOOPE 40
 operates in connection with an ingredient manager application 41, which
 can reside in the same server of the FOOPE 40, or can reside in a
 different computer. In this embodiment, the ingredient manager
 application is installed in a secondary computer 45. The ingredient
 manager application 41 is effectively an interface between the FOOPE 40
 and a system database 42. The system database 42 is the repository of all
 the information that is necessary for the FOOPE 40 to perform its
 operations, as it will be described in detail later. The system database
 42 can fulfill any information request generated by the FOOPE 40. A
 request for information generated by the FOOPE 40 is transmitted to the
 ingredient manager application 41, which interrogates the system database
 42. The ingredient manager application can also be accessed directly,
 i.e. independently of the FOOPE 40, for example by an administrator of
 the system 1000 if he needs to input records into the system database 42.
 The information stored in the system database is capable of fulfilling
 any information request elaborated by the FOOPE 40. Nutritional
 information ingredient by ingredient, as described hereinbefore, is one
 particulat type of information that can be stored in the system database
 42. However, the system database can store other information as long as
 the information generally relates to attributes or properties of the
 products or ingredients produced and or sold in the restaurant.

 [0231] The FOOPE 40 is programmed to process an initial proposed order
 instruction, which is input by the user via the remote 35 or in-store 38
 user interfaces. The order is generally for a meal or for a single dish
 or drink. The instruction for a proposed order can be accompanied by an
 instruction that the order should not be processed by the FOOPE 40, in
 which case the proposed order is simply passed to the &quot;Back-Office Order
 Fulfillment Engine 50&quot; (BOOFE) for implementation. Like the FOOPE 40, the
 BOOFE 50 is also provided on a suitably programmed server. A single
 server machine can be shared between the FOOPE 40 and the BOOFE 50.
 However, in FIG. 4A, the FOOPE 40 and BOOFE 50 are implemented on two
 different servers, respectively the FOOPE server 60 and the BOOFE server
 70.

 [0232] The FOOPE 40 is generally used to process the proposed order
 instruction and to provide a proposed order output to the user in
 response to an order being instructed or placed. The FOOPE 40 requests
 the ingredients manager application 41 to locate records of food or
 beverage meals, recipes or ingredients constituting or comprised in the
 order, in the system database 42. The FOOPE 40 then calculates one or
 more output parameters to be returned to the user via for example one of
 the in-store terminals 36 or the remote connection devices 31, 32, 33, as
 the case may be. One or more of the parameters computed by the FOOPE 40
 can be dependent on the quantities of the meals, recipes or ingredients
 specified by the user in his order (for example a nutritional parameter
 expressing the total grams of proteins included the order or in part of
 the order, for example a single dish or drink or even a single
 ingredient). Other parameters can, however, be independent from such
 quantities (for example a nutritional parameter expressing whether the
 order is suitable for vegetarians--this will just depend on whether any
 meat is present in the order). The FOOPE 40 is therefore responsible for
 generating an output comprising one, two or multiple parameters
 associated with the order. As we have already seen, such output will
 contain qualitative and quantitative attributes or characteristics or
 other general properties of the food and beverage items or meals, recipes
 and ingredients comprised in, or constituting, the order. We will
 describe later in more detail examples of calculations and operations
 performed by the FOOPE 40. It is however pointed out at this stage that
 these calculations can be basic (for example comprising sums and
 multiplications, e.g. for calculating the total proteins of a meal, as
 described hereinbefore) or could encompass more sophisticated calculation
 algorithms. The degree of complexity of the FOOPE 40 calculations is not
 part of the present invention, which instead is defined by how the FOOPE
 40 interacts with the other elements of the system 1000 and by how the
 system 1000 interacts with the end user. The output parameter or
 parameters generated by the FOOPE 40 can be default parameters of general
 interest (for example &quot;vitamins&quot; and &quot;fats&quot;), or they could be chosen by
 the user for example from a list provided to the user on the in-store
 user interface 38. In this way, the system engages even more with the
 user by allowing him to monitor his selection of parametes. For example,
 a certain user may be interested in finding out how many calories there
 are in a proposed meal, but also he would like to know whether any onions
 are present in the proposed meal, because he would like to avoid them.
 Another user may need to monitor the total intake of iron connected with
 the proposed order, because of a medical condition.

 [0233] As it has been described in detail at the beginning of this section,
 the output generated by the FOOPE 40 can be conveniently represented by a
 graphical element 13.

 [0234] The information generated by the FOOPE 40 is visualized to the
 in-store user at one of the in-store terminals 36, or to a remote user
 via the Internet 34. FIG. 10 shows an example of a screen display as seen
 by an in-store user at one of the terminals 36 in response to a proposed
 order for a meal.

 [0235] The feedback and information received about the order allows the
 user to decide whether to maintain the proposed order or whether to
 change it. If the proposed order is changed, a new output is or may be
 calculated by the FOOPE 40, and then displayed. The decision can be
 facilitated by a number of decision instruments that can appear in the
 screen display, as shown in FIG. 10, where a bar-chart is used for
 comparing the quantity of proteins provided by the order with a
 recommended daily allowance (RDA). The comparison is drawn on the basis
 of percentage RDA.

 [0236] When an order is finalized by the user by sending a corresponding
 instruction to the FOOPE 40 via the user interface, the FOOPE 40
 transmits the finalized order to the BOOFE 50. The BOOFE 50, in turn,
 makes the finalized order available to the staff of the fast food outlet
 through the in-store staff terminals 54. The content of the screens
 displayed at the in-store staff terminals (which, like the user
 terminals, are integrated input/output devices, in this case
 touch-screens) is provided by an in-store staff interface application 52,
 which runs in the BOOFE 50 server and which interacts with the BOOFE 50.
 It will also be noted that the BOOFE server 70 is connected to the system
 database 42 via the ingredients manager application secondary computer
 45. This connection allows information from the system database 42 to be
 used by the BOOFE when necessary. The in-store staff interface 52 is
 active on the staff terminals 54 by means of a LAN 53 which connects the
 back-office server 70 with the terminals 54. A characteristic of the
 BOOFE 50 is that it comprises a prioritization algorithm, which is
 designed to guide the store staff in determining which order--if many
 have been passed to the BOOFE 50 by the FOOPE 40--should be fulfilled
 first. Based on the orders loaded in the BOOFE 50, and on the fulfillment
 priority established by the priority algorithm, member of staff will
 select the next order to be fulfilled or prepared, and thereafter will
 prepare or cook food and beverage items according to the order and
 deliver them to the user or purchaser. The delivery can be in-store or
 remote delivery can be arranged in the usual ways.

 [0237] A customer of the fast food outlet running the system 1000
 experiences the &quot;front office&quot; part of the system, which allows the
 customer to retrieve at &quot;till&quot; level information about proposed orders
 via one of the user terminals 36, and to make a decision on what to
 consume based on that information. A member of staff of the fast food
 outlet experiences the &quot;back office&quot; part of the system, which allows the
 staff member to fulfill orders on the basis of information that can be
 retrieved form the system database 42, like recipes for the order. The
 staff member, if authorized, can also access the ingredient manager
 application to update any records or to create new records or attributes
 for the ingredients, meals or individual dishes. In an embodiment, the
 system database comprises records of the quantities of ingredients stored
 in the fast food restaurant and these records are automatically updated
 in the database 42 when an order is fulfilled; when an ingredient becomes
 unavailable, the user interface will not allow the user to select the
 unavailable ingredient. When the ingredient is re-stocked, the staff
 member or an administrator will reset the corresponding record in the
 system database 42 to the quantity re-stocked.

 [0238] FIG. 4B shows a variant of the system represented in FIG. 4A. In
 this alternative embodiment 2000, the system database 42 is replaced by
 two separate databases: the ingredients database 43 and the stock
 database 57.

 [0239] In order to describe the operations of the FOOPE 40 and the BOOFE 50
 of this system 2000, it will be necessary to first describe the basic
 characteristics of the ingredients database 43 and of the stock database
 57.

 [0240] The structure of the ingredients database 43 of FIG. 4B is
 represented in FIG. 5A. The data stored in the ingredients database 43
 are organized according to a hierarchy or levels. Each record is
 essentially a data structure, as is known in the art of computer science.
 This guarantees efficient access to the data by dedicated applications
 (for example the ingredients manager application 41 as described above).
 Since the products sold by the fast food store are categorized as meals,
 recipes or ingredients, conveniently the ingredients database 43 has also
 records representative of meals recipes and ingredients. In other words,
 the ingredients database 43 is structured in a way that reflects the way
 the store or restaurant is organized. This feature of the ingredients
 database will be clearer later.

 [0241] At the top-most hierarchical level, the &quot;meal&quot; data structures or
 records 100 are found. Each record represents a &quot;meal&quot;, i.e. lists the
 individual components making up the meal. A &quot;meal&quot; record therefore
 reflects an order for a meal, as established by a user or purchaser of
 the system 2000. The &quot;meal&quot; records 100 is at the top-most hierarchical
 level in the ingredients database 43 since the meal records can comprise
 many items, for example cooked items (for example a soup), assembled
 items (a sandwich), beverage items (orange juice), dessert items, snack
 items, fruit pots etc . . . As it is evident, many combinations forming a
 meal can be stored at the &quot;meal&quot; level. The menu of the fast food outlet
 running the system 2000, which comprises many combinations of products
 for consumption (these combinations are often called meal deals in the
 fast food industry), can be represented in the ingredients database 43 at
 the &quot;meal&quot; level.

 [0242] The second level in the data hierarchy is represented by a group of
 &quot;recipe&quot; records or data structures 110. Each record is representative of
 a food or beverage item or dish which is cooked, prepared, assembled or
 otherwise manipulated at the fast food outlet.

 [0243] These records are particularly useful to represent individual
 dishes, as the name &quot;recipe&quot; suggests.

 [0244] The third level in the data hierarchy is represented by a group of
 &quot;ingredient&quot; records 140. Each record represents an ingredient. The
 ingredient records are further divided into records representing compound
 ingredients 120 and records representing single ingredients 130. The
 difference between single and compound ingredients is that the latter
 category of ingredients requires cooking, or some sort of preparation, or
 manipulation, in-store, whereas the former category of ingredients is
 actually used raw (i.e. for example &quot;as supplied&quot;). It is important to
 notice that a distinction can in principle be drawn between compound
 ingredient records and recipe records, since the latter records are
 generally suitable for representing a finished item, i.e. ready for
 consumption, like a dish, as cooked, assembled or prepared in-store,
 whereas the former are generally suitable for representing an un-finished
 item, i.e. generally not ready for consumption without further
 preparation.

 [0245] The distinction between compound and single ingredients, however,
 could be based on other than the nature or preparation of the physical
 ingredient. This distinction could also, conveniently, be based on how
 the restaurant sources the ingredient and on how the ingredient can be
 better represented or modeled in the ingredients database. For example,
 if a fast-food outlet uses caramelized red onions (in nature, a compound
 ingredient since it requires preparation, mixing etc . . . ) to prepare
 some of its dishes or food items, and if this ingredient is externally
 sourced (i.e. it comes ready to use from a supplier), this could be
 classified in the ingredients database 43 as a single ingredient rather
 than a compound ingredient. If, instead, caramelized red onions are
 produced or cooked in store, but are generally used as an ingredient for
 sandwiches, this ingredient will be better represented in the ingredients
 database 43 as a compound ingredient. If the fast food outlet intends to
 sell caramelized red onions as a side dish, then caramelized red onions
 could be represented in the ingredients database 43 as a recipe, rather
 than as a single ingredient. It is also not excluded that there may
 exists, in the ingredients database 43, two or even three different
 records for caramelized red onions: one in the recipe group, one in the
 compound ingredient group and perhaps one in the single ingredient group,
 if all three of them are necessary (this could be the case if the fast
 food serves caramelized red onions as a dish on its own and as an
 ingredient for its sandwiches, sometimes sourcing the ingredient
 externally and sometimes preparing the ingredient in-house).

 [0246] The fourth level in the data hierarchy is represented by a pool of
 &quot;attribute&quot; records 150. Each attribute record represents a certain
 characteristic of an ingredient. If we consider one characteristic
 described by one attribute record of the attribute records 150, for
 example a &quot;positive&quot; attribute such as &quot;containing uncooked meats&quot;, this
 characteristic will be inherited by all recipes containing that
 ingredient and by all meals containing that recipe. The attribute records
 occupy the last level in the hierarchy of data, as they are not
 independent entities, i.e. they do not have a meaning unless they are
 associated with a record belonging to the ingredients group 140, as
 described above.

 [0247] Further, it is clear that the nutritional values VN(i, k) as
 described hereinabove, are just a particular form of attributes, and
 attributes that will be inherited by the recipes and the meals in the
 same way as described above for the descriptive attribute &quot;containing
 uncooked meats&quot;. However, it is also clear that these nutritional values
 VN(i, k) will have to be used in conjunction with specified quantities of
 the ingredients, so that total nutritional values can be calculated as it
 has been illustrated in detail above.

 [0248] FIG. 5B shows a tree diagram that illustrates the convenience and
 capability of the ingredients database. As explained before, the user of
 the system 2000 enters a proposed meal order. In the case of FIG. 5B, the
 proposed meal order entered by the user is represented by &quot;My lunch&quot; 101.
 &quot;My lunch&quot; is a preferred lunch combination of the purchaser and consists
 in this case of one Parma ham sandwich and a cup of orange and passion
 fruit juice. The &quot;My lunch&quot; combination could be already stored in one
 record in the meal group of the ingredients database 43, or it could be
 personal to the customer. Let us say that in this case the combination is
 already present in the database 43. In the ingredients database 43, the
 default value for the quantities for &quot;sandwiches&quot; and &quot;juices&quot; are one
 piece for &quot;sandwiches&quot; and one cup for &quot;juices&quot;. At the time of inputting
 a proposed order, the user has an opportunity to decide whether to place
 the order according to the default quantities, or whether he would like
 different quantities. Once the quantities of the proposed order are
 known, the FOOPE 50&apos;, via the ingredients manager application 41&apos;,
 interrogates the ingredients database 43. When the corresponding record
 is located, it is loaded into the FOOPE 50 for processing, according to
 any specified quantities. If the customer inputs a &quot;My lunch&quot; combination
 that is new, i.e. not stored already in the database, a new meal record
 101 can be entered when the FOOPE 50 retrieves the recipes associated
 with the new &quot;My lunch&quot; combination. In this case the recipes would be a
 recipe 111 for the preparation of a Parma ham sandwich, and a recipe 112
 for the preparation of a cup of orange and passion fruit juice. The new
 record could be entered automatically by the FOOPE 50&apos;, via the
 ingredients manager application 41&apos;, or it could be entered manually by a
 member of staff via the ingredients manager application 41&apos;. The FOOPE
 50&apos;, in collaboration with the ingredients manager application/interface
 41&apos;, is then able to descend further into the hierarchic data structure
 of the ingredients database 43, since the recipes for the Parma ham
 sandwich and orange and passion fruit juice comprise ingredients. The
 Parma ham sandwich recipe record, for example, indicates that the
 sandwich is prepared with pita bread 131, caramelized red onions 121,
 Parma ham 132 and baby spinach 133. The FOOPE 50&apos; therefore accesses the
 records of these ingredients 131, 121, 132, 133. In the case of the
 compound ingredient needed for the preparation of the Parma ham sandwich,
 50 grams of caramelized red onions 121, the FOOPE 50&apos; is further pointed
 to the records of the corresponding single ingredients forming said
 compound ingredient: salt 134, dark soft sugar 135, balsamic vinegar 136
 and sliced red onions 137. The quantities of the single ingredients are
 inferred from the meal quantity imposed by the customer. For example, the
 quantities above would double if the user ordered two Parma ham
 sandwiches. The FOOPE 50&apos;, in connection with the ingredients manager
 application 41&apos;, follows a similar information-browsing path in the
 ingredients database for all the other items comprised in the meal.

 [0249] When the FOOPE 50&apos; and the ingredient manager application 41&apos; have
 retrieved all the information regarding the combination &quot;My lunch&quot;, the
 FOOPE 50 will be ready to compute the overall output information
 regarding &quot;My lunch&quot; 173. The result of this computation is shown in FIG.
 5B.

 [0250] It should be noted that a number of possible information retrieval
 optimization strategies can be used by the ingredients manager
 application 41&apos;. For example, following the creation of a new combination
 &quot;My lunch&quot; in the meal records, the results of the computation above
 could be stored in the &quot;My lunch&quot; record. If &quot;My lunch&quot; is requested
 again by a user of the system, the results of the computation of the
 FOOPE above 173 would therefore be readily available at &quot;meal&quot; level. If
 a new, unusual or personalized combination is entered by a customer, the
 system may be configured to store the new computation at &quot;meal&quot; level, or
 at &quot;recipe&quot; level. The offer of the fast food outlet can therefore be
 made even more flexible and still be accompanied with detailed
 information regarding the products ordered by customers. Preferred meal
 combinations, represented by corresponding records in the meal group 100
 of the ingredients database 43, could form the fast food outlet&apos;s main
 menu, and could have ready nutritional information available at &quot;meal&quot;
 level. If, however, the customers want to customize their orders and
 still be able to get detailed information like the one that is pre-stored
 for each menu combination, they will be able to do so with this system
 2000, due to the structure of the ingredients database 43.

 [0251] The structure of the stock database 57 of FIG. 4B is represented in
 FIG. 6A. The stock database 57 is intended to furnish a picture of the
 stock of all food and beverage items or products or meals, recipes and
 ingredients available in store and available for sale to customers of the
 fast food outlet running the system 2000.

 [0252] There are three parallel groups of records, comprised in the stock
 database 57, respectively representing &quot;grab&amp;go;&quot; recipes (take-away
 units) 200, compound ingredients 210 and single ingredients 220. These
 are the three categories of stocked items according to the business model
 of the fast food outlet. However, it is clear that the stock database
 would be structured differently, if the restaurant kept different goods
 or product combinations in stock. Each group of records has an associated
 pool of attributes (230, 240, 250) that can be assigned to the records in
 order to reflect and describe the status of the stock of the ingredients
 or &quot;grab&amp;go;&quot; units kept in the store.

 [0253] FIG. 6B represents the data structure of the records of FIG. 6A. We
 can see that the fast food outlet provides Parma ham sandwich recipes 201
 on a &quot;grab&amp;go;&quot; basis. Each grab and go batch is described by a set of
 attributes. For example a stock of Parma hand sandwiches, stored in a
 &quot;grab&amp;go;&quot; refrigerator of the fast food outlet, is characterized by a
 &quot;day produced&quot; 261 attribute, a &quot;hour of production&quot; 262 attribute, a
 &quot;minimum quantity&quot; 263 attribute (which means a minimum number of pieces
 that should always be in stock i.e. ready to be grabbed by customers), a
 &quot;best before&quot; date attribute 264, a &quot;profit margin&quot; attribute 265
 indicating how much profit is to be made for each sandwich to remunerate
 the operation of the preparation of the sandwich itself, a &quot;discard&quot;
 attribute indicating how much food is discarded due to the preparation of
 the sandwiches and a &quot;discount&quot; parameter indicating whether the stocked
 sandwiches should be offered at a reduced price (for example because the
 use by date is approaching). The fast food outlet also stocks compound
 ingredients, ready to be sold as such or as part of recipes made to
 order. Caramelized red onions 211 are one such ingredient. As it can be
 seen from FIG. 6B, the attributes describing the batch status are the
 &quot;production date&quot; 270, &quot;production hour&quot; 271, &quot;quantity produced&quot; 273,
 &quot;minimum quantity&quot; 273 of ingredient (that should always be present
 in-store), &quot;best before&quot; date 274, &quot;profit margin&quot; 275, &quot;discard&quot; 276 and
 &quot;discount&quot; 277. Since compound ingredients can be sourced externally, it
 will be possible to add the attributes of &quot;purchase date&quot; 268 and &quot;price
 of purchase&quot; 269, if caramelized red onions are sourced from an external
 supplier. Single ingredients will not be prepared in-store. They can only
 be sourced externally--for example ready-to-eat salads or leaves are
 single ingredients. As a consequence, any stored batch of a single
 ingredient can be described in term of the following attributes:
 &quot;quantity purchased&quot; 280, &quot;minimum quantity&quot; 281 of ingredient (that
 should always be present in-store), &quot;best before&quot; date 282, &quot;profit
 margin&quot; 283, &quot;discard&quot; 284, &quot;discount&quot; 285, &quot;purchase date&quot; 278 and
 &quot;price of purchase&quot; 279. Single ingredients will not be prepared
 in-store. Therefore, for this class of ingredients, the attribute
 &quot;production date&quot; will not be applicable.

 [0254] The &quot;profit margin&quot; for a Parma ham sandwich (30%) is higher that
 that for caramelized red onions (25%), to account for the burden of the
 respective operations of preparation (greater when preparing a sandwich).
 This is why, for baby spinach, an ingredient that is just unpacked,
 washed and stored when it is received from a supplier, a &quot;profit margin&quot;
 of only 20% is used. It is also clear that the &quot;discard&quot; margin for baby
 spinach will be the lowest between the &quot;discard&quot; margins shown in FIG.
 6B, since only a small part of the quantities of baby spinach received
 from the supplier will be wasted.

 [0255] Moving back to FIG. 4B, it can now be explained how this system 2000
 differs from the system previously described 1000.

 [0256] It can first be noted that, in this arrangement 2000, the FOOPE 40&apos;
 and the BOOFE 50&apos; have been implemented on the same server 80. The
 ingredient manager application 41&apos; (which is here implemented on a
 different secondary computer, although this secondary computer is not
 shown in FIG. 4B) interfaces with the ingredients database 43 as well as
 the stock database 57. The ingredient manager application 41&apos; is
 therefore able to transmit to the server 80 preliminary information about
 the stock availability at the fast food outlet. This information can be
 made available to the purchaser at the moment when he wants to place an
 order, at the in-store user interface 36&apos; or the remote user interface
 35&apos;. Therefore, items, meals or ingredients that are not available, are
 made &quot;invisible&quot; to the purchaser, who cannot select any unavailable food
 or beverage meal, dish or ingredient. The BOOFE 50&apos; is connected to, and
 operates in conjunction with, a stock manager application 51&apos;, which runs
 on a different secondary computer (the secondary computer is not shown in
 FIG. 4B). The stock manager application 51&apos; can access both the
 ingredients database 43 and the stock database 57. When the BOOFE 50&apos;
 receives an order that needs to be fulfilled, it transmits the order to
 one or more staff terminals. Upon the order being picked up by the staff
 for preparation and delivery, the BOOFE 50&apos; informs the stock manager
 application 51&apos; that the order is being fulfilled. The stock manager
 application 51&apos; thus accesses the records of the stock database
 associated with the order and updates the relevant fields to take into
 account that the meal, dishes or ingredients in the quantities specified
 in the order have or are going to be removed from the restaurant since
 they have been sold. Since the stock manager application 51&apos; is also
 connected to the ingredients database, which, as described before,
 contains information on how to cook a recipe or how to prepare a compound
 ingredient or assemble a certain meal, these various instructions can be
 made readily available to the staff of the fast food outlet when a
 certain stock needs to be created. Therefore, the connection and
 cooperation between the stock manager application and the ingredients
 database is an important feature of the &quot;back-office&quot; operations
 performed by the staff of the fast food restaurant.

 [0257] The ingredient manager applications 41 and 41&apos; of the systems 1000,
 2000 can be used by the staff or by administrators of the fast food
 restaurant to create meals, recipes and ingredients flexibly and
 conveniently. Once the system 2000 is in place, it will be easy for the
 restaurant to vary its menus, cuisine, recipes and meal deals. It will
 also be easy and convenient for the restaurant to monitor supplies and to
 assess the performance of suppliers. It is also clear that the system
 2000 allows purchasers and users to be involved in the creation of
 personalized recipes. These can be stored in the ingredients database for
 other customer to use later.

 [0258] The stock manager application 51&apos; is used by the staff of the fast
 food outlet to create, keep, monitor and maintain records of the stock of
 the shop. Since the stock records can be created down to the ingredient
 level, the restaurant will be able to manage the stock more efficiently.
 For example, the system 2000 can be used to monitor the popularity of a
 certain ingredient. If that ingredient is very popular with consumers,
 the stock can be increased. In other words, the system is able to operate
 flexibly and provides management tools for a tailored offer of food and
 beverage items. The system 2000 will also be capable of reacting quickly
 to any change of behavior of the consumers, as the recipes and stocks are
 easily re-defined.

 [0259] Further advantages of the systems 1000, 2000 will be described
 below. We will now describe a typical consumer experience and vendor
 experience leading to a commercial transaction.

 [0260] FIG. 7 is a flow diagram representing a method of ordering a dish
 using the system of FIG. 4B. When a consumer requires an order to be
 created 300, various options are given. In the &quot;Tailor made&quot; option 301,
 the consumer goes through a series of successive choices that allow him
 to build up a personalized dish or meal at the moment of ordering. In the
 &quot;Chef proposal&quot; option 302, the user can choose between a number of ready
 available combinations (meals). In the &quot;My order&quot; 303 option, the user
 can input a personalized request that was prepared earlier by the
 consumer and which is stored in a magnetic or loyalty card of the
 consumer. In the &quot;Secret&quot; option, the purchaser is allowed to buy only a
 subgroup of recipes or ingredients relative to certain typologies of
 food, like desserts and coffees. It is envisaged that with the system of
 the present invention 1000, 2000, a consumer would be able to decide
 which subgroup of items or recipes he wants to order from, for example
 only dishes containing &quot;asparagus&quot;. FIG. 7 illustrates a decision process
 based on the &quot;Tailor made&quot; option 301. The customer chooses what type of
 meal he would like to have, among a number of possible choices: breakfast
 305, sandwich 306, salad 607 or soup 308. Each choice determines a path
 comprising further choices. In the second tier of choices, all relative
 to the previous choice of soup 308, the alternatives are: vegetable stock
 312, miso broth 311, Thai stock 310, meat stock 309b and curry stock 309.
 The stock manager application 51&apos; has informed the customer that the
 curry stock is not available. Nevertheless, the user chooses the
 vegetable stock 312. The next tier of alternatives includes rice 313,
 barley grains 314, brown rice 315, noodles 316 and pasta 317. Brown rice
 is not in stock and the noodles are discounted. The user nevertheless
 prefers the barley grains 314 selection. The next tier of alternatives
 includes prawns 318, chorizo 319, poached chicken 320 and beef 321. Like
 above, the customer selects an item which is not discounted. The final
 round of alternatives includes baby spinach 326, corn 325, mange tout
 324, sliced red onions 323 and grated mixed nuts 322. The consumer
 receives a warning that grated mixed nuts are not suitable for his diet,
 and this time he selects a discounted item, baby spinach. The &quot;no grated
 nuts&quot; requirement of the consumer was stored in the loyalty card, like
 the &quot;My order&quot; selection 303. The loyalty card can easily be read for
 example by one of the in-store terminals 36 of the system 1000.

 [0261] Any consumer individual preferences defined individually by the
 consumers could be stored in media like magnetic fidelity cards (e.g.
 &quot;low-calories meal avoiding cheeses&quot;). Many other types of media (hence
 media/reader solutions) are however available. The readers would be
 supplied for example at the system terminals 36, as it is know in the
 art. For example, near field contact cards/readers could also be used.
 RFID technology could also be used. When sets of alternative choices are
 proposed in tiers like in FIG. 7, the system 1000, 2000 could therefore
 be designed to take into account any individual or personal user&apos;s
 requirement. The databases could therefore be interrogated while taking
 into account these personal requirements (e.g. excluding high calories
 ingredients and cheeses).

 [0262] The system 1000, 2000 can be used in a &quot;trial and error&quot; fashion:
 the user proposes an order; information regarding the proposed order is
 fed back to the user/consumer; the consumer may wish to change the
 individual ingredients comprised in the order.

 [0263] The system 1000, 2000 can be used in a &quot;query&quot; fashion: the user
 inputs certain requirements; solutions or choices are given to the
 consumer only if they satisfy the consumer requirements; and the consumer
 chooses his meal or unit for consumption. When the order is placed, the
 nutritional and/or other characteristics of the order are displayed, as
 explained previously.

 [0264] In FIG. 7, it is possible to see how the consumer can make an
 informed decision about what he is about to eat or drink, as a whole
 meal, or about a sub-group of units belonging to the meal. If the
 consumer is not satisfied with the order entered, he can start the whole
 procedure over 329 or he can re-select an ingredient at any one of the
 tiers above 330. Eventually, an order is created 340.

 [0265] The process illustrated in FIG. 7 is underpinned by the provision of
 an ingredients database 43 with the structure described above. Key
 elements of the system 2000 can be seen as: the &quot;granularity&quot; of the
 information about the composition of meals and recipes, down to the
 ingredient level, as represented in the ingredients database 43; and the
 interaction or cross-correlation of the information stored in that
 databases 43 with the information made available by the stock database
 57.

 [0266] FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of a method of preparing a dish, meal or
 compound ingredient using the system of FIG. 4B. There are three
 categories of actions that the staff of the fast food restaurant can
 select to perform: the fulfillment of an in-store or web-derived
 customized order 403, the replenishment of a minimum quantity ingredient
 401 or the replenishment of a minimum quantity &quot;grab&amp;go;&quot; stocked item.
 When the operator has selected the operation that he wants or must
 fulfill (it will be remembered that these are made available at the user
 terminals by the BOOFE 50&apos;), the ingredients database 43 will provide all
 the necessary information about the sequence of actions to be performed
 according to a recipe 404. Although the stock may have been checked at
 the moment of placing the order, the diagram of FIG. 8 includes a further
 stock check operation 415, 405. In this way the operator is informed, or
 again informed, in the event that an ingredient is missing, i.e. is not
 in stock. If no ingredient is missing, the order proceeds to fulfillment
 407 and the stock database 57 is updated. The order is then served or
 delivered 410. If an ingredient is missing, the case may be that a
 compound ingredient simply needs to be replenished to be able to fulfill
 an order. If this is the case, the requested operation is logged by the
 BOOFE 50&apos;. If the compound ingredient is sourced from a supplier, the
 case may be that the only action possible is to inform the staff that an
 order needs to be placed with the supplier for the missing ingredient as
 soon as possible 409.

 [0267] FIG. 9 is a schematic representation of a system 3000 with multiple
 food and beverages order fulfillment stations (OFSs) 510, 520, 530, all
 depending on a central food and beverages order placement station (OPS)
 500.

 [0268] The OPS comprises a user interface 501 for interaction with
 customers, a FOOPE 502, an ingredient manager application 503 and an
 ingredients database 543 of the kind described above.

 [0269] Each OFS comprises a staff interface 511, 521, 231, a BOOFE 512,
 522, 532 and a stock database 557a, 557b, 557c, again according to the
 corresponding stock databases described above. The ingredients manager
 application 503 is connected to the three stock databases 557a, 557b,
 557c and the three stock manager applications 513, 133, 523 of respective
 OFSs 512, 520, 530 are connected to the central ingredients database.

 [0270] In this way, an order can be placed centrally with the central
 ordering station 500 by placing the order through a user interface 501.
 The order is analyzed and output information is generated by the FOOPE
 502 in collaboration with the ingredient manager application 503 and the
 ingredients database 543. In this embodiment, the user interface, the OPS
 and the ingredients database are implemented all on the same central
 ordering server. In the event that an order cannot be fulfilled based on
 the stock of one of the OFSs, the OPS will try to place the order with an
 alternative OFS that has informed the OPS that the order can be
 fulfilled. In case more than one OFS can fulfill the order, the central
 OPS is programmed to choose which OFS should be entrusted with the order.
 The choice may be based on criteria depending on the location of the user
 or, for example, on the age of the stock of perishable product, thereby
 making a cost saving.

 [0271] FIG. 10 is an example of a screen 360 displayed at an in-store user
 terminal of the system of FIG. 4A. In this example, a customer has chosen
 to build his own salad, which is labeled &quot;My Salad&quot; 368. In the system
 database 42 of the system 1000 of FIG. 4A, there is a recipe record
 corresponding to &quot;My Salad&quot;. The recipe record contains sets of
 instructions for assembling or preparing the dish resulting from the
 final order of the customer. From FIG. 10 we can see that the Customer
 has not yet completed the order, but he is only at &quot;Step 2&quot; 359 out of a
 total of seven steps 369 required for completing the order. As discussed
 in the description of FIG. 7, the method of ordering &quot;My Salad&quot; 368 will
 have been programmed in the FOOPE server 60, and the program will
 cooperate with the ingredient manager application 41 which acts as an
 interface to the system database 42. The completed order will result in a
 &quot;front-office&quot; output, for the benefit of the customer, and in a
 &quot;back-office&quot; output, for the benefit of the staff of the fast food
 outlet operating the system 1000. The front office output will be
 described in detail below and is represented in FIG. 10. The back office
 output will consist in a set of instructions that allows any operator of
 the fast food outlet to easily prepare and build the personalized salad
 ordered by the customer. In addition, if there is available a stock
 database, like the one of the system 2000 of FIG. 4B, the operator of the
 fast food outlet will also be able to update the stock information based
 on the personalized order placed by the customer.

 [0272] Before describing the so-called front office output of FIG. 10, the
 interaction of the customer with the in-store user terminal will be
 described. The screen 360 of FIG. 10 displays a number of available
 choices in relation to &quot;Step 2&quot; 357 of the ordering process. &quot;Step 2&quot;
 relates to the choice of ingredients predominantly bringing carbohydrates
 to the overall nutritional content of the salad. The screen is a
 touch-screen, and the customer can interact with it by means of a
 touch-screen cursor 358. The screen shows six carbohydrates choices:
 brown rice 361, pasta 362, pasta salad base 363, barley grains 364, rice
 noodles 365 and rice salad base 366. The customer has chosen pasta salad
 base 363, this choice being highlighted in FIG. 10. Each ingredient
 choice is accompanied by a respective quantity 373, 376, 379, 382, 385,
 388. The ingredient quantities are adjustable by means of
 increment/decrement buttons 375, 378, 381, 384, 387, 390.

 [0273] Returning to the front office output illustrated in FIG. 10, it will
 be noted that when the quantity of an ingredient is adjusted by the
 customer, a corresponding price for the quantity of ingredient is
 displayed. For example 60 grams 379 of pasta salad base will cost
 .English Pound.1.32. More selections of ingredients 367 are also
 available, although not shown in FIG. 10. The customer can quickly
 compare prices 374, 376, 379, 385, 385, 388 of different quantities 373,
 376, 379, 382, 385, 388 of different ingredients. He can adjust these
 quantities, and consequently the corresponding prices, for example having
 in mind a target o desired price. The interface 360 also shows the
 aggregated total cost 372 of the selections across the steps 369
 necessary to build the personalized salad, in this case .English
 Pound.3.52. The total calories 370 of the salad, as of &quot;Step 2&quot;, are also
 outputted. In addition, a special parameter called Food Secret Rating 371
 is displayed. In this case this is a five star system of classifying a
 dish or a meal, according to a certain algorithm based on the
 nutritional, price and other characteristics of the ingredients comprised
 in the dish or meal. The screen interface 360 comprises also a graphical
 representation of the nutritional content of the current ingredient
 choices. The monitored nutritional parameters are in this case five:
 proteins 394, carbohydrates, 395, fiber 399, saturated fats and
 unsaturated fats. Male and female nutritional parameter reference values
 are expressed in percentage. In this case, the male 392 and female 391
 nutritional parameter reference values are simply set to 100%. This
 percentage indicates the percentage of recommended intake for a meal, in
 this case lunch. Therefore, the customer will be able to compare,
 according to his/her sex, the nutritional content of the salad, as this
 is being ordered at the ordering point, in respect of recommendations
 relative to consuming the salad for lunch. Absolute reference values are
 not visualized in this embodiment, but that could be implemented. Since
 male and female customers will have different absolute recommended meal
 intake values, the graphical elements representing, as a percentage, the
 nutritional contents of the salad have different lengths. For example the
 length of the bar 398 representing the total proteins of the salad (as of
 &quot;Step 2&quot;) compared to the reference value for a male consumer 392, is
 different from the length of the corresponding bar 396 for a female
 consumer. The same can be said for the bars 397, 399 representing the
 fiber content of the salad and for the other bars illustrating the
 content of the other nutritional parameters, such as fats or
 carbohydrates. The interface 360 also contains an indication 355 of the
 suitability of the salad associated with a medical or taste condition of
 the customer. In this case, this indication 355 concerns the presence of
 any dairy products in the salad. The interface 360 shows that the salad
 is, so far, free form dairy products. If dairy products are not desired
 in the dish, step 5 will be by-passed.

 [0274] The customer gathers information form the interface 360 and makes
 decisions based on this information. For example, a customer may want to
 bring the fiber content of the proposed salad within the reference limit
 391, 392. The customer can do so by acting on the increment/decrement
 button 381 of the selected ingredient 363 to decrease the quantity of
 pasta salad base to be consumed, or he can remove his selection
 altogether and select a different ingredient.

 [0275] The information to be provided by the front office output can be
 fully decided by the customer, or all or part of it can be decided by the
 fast food outlet. When customers are allowed to decide (wholly or
 partially) the information content to be displayed to them while they
 select the ingredients to be included in their dish or meal, they can do
 so taking into account their own taste requirements, for example a
 customer may not want to consume onions, or other requirements, for
 example a medical requirement such as an allergy given by a certain
 ingredient or type of food to be avoided.

 [0276] FIG. 11 is an example of a screen displayed at an in-store staff
 terminal of the system of FIG. 4B. A member of staff, an operator, can
 interact with the touch-screen via the cursor 563. He can filter the list
 of items displayed by the interface 560. To do this, there are provided
 filter buttons 564, 565, 566, 567, 568 to filter the ingredients
 alphabetically. In FIG. 11, two lists are shown: one relates to &quot;compound
 ingredients&quot; 569 and the other relates to &quot;grab&amp;go items&quot; 570. As
 discussed for FIG. 8, and as seen for FIG. 10 above, the screen 560 can
 also comprise a list of made-to-order or personalized items such as &quot;My
 salad&quot; described above; in this case the staff interface 560 will show a
 list of &quot;placed orders&quot; in addition to the lists of &quot;compound
 ingredients&quot; and &quot;grab&amp;go items&quot;.

 [0277] In FIG. 11, it can be seen that the attention of the operator is
 drawn to a certain number of items which require action. The items
 requiring action 576, 577, 579, 581 are highlighted with an underline and
 a &quot;star&quot; symbol. All items of the list of &quot;placed orders&quot;, if this is
 included in the interface 560, would require action, i.e. the physical
 preparation of the ordered dish or meal. Returning to the embodiment
 illustrated in FIG. 11, when the operator decides to go ahead with an
 action, he will move the cursor 563 to select an ingredient or item
 requiring attention and will then press the &quot;Fill&quot; button 561 to receive
 information or instructions regarding actions to be performed in respect
 of the selected task. In particular, he will receive a recipe or a set of
 instructions for preparation and/or assemblage of the order. When the
 actions have been completed, he will return to the staff terminal and
 press the &quot;Exit&quot; button 562 to return to the screen 560 currently shown,
 so that the next task can be chosen. The selection of the tasks to be
 performed can be left to the initiative of the operator, or priority can
 be imposed on each task.

 [0278] The staff interface 560 of FIG. 11 includes a list of compound
 ingredients 571 and a list of associated quantities 572. Reading from the
 list of associated quantities, it can be seen, for example, that there
 are currently 800 grams of barley grains 583 currently stocked at the
 fast food outlet. There is also indicated, in said list, a minimum amount
 of barley grains 584 that should be available for sale at any moment (300
 grams). Minimum amounts of compound ingredients are ingredient
 attributes, as discussed above in relation to FIG. 6B. The &quot;broth mix&quot;
 ingredient 576 is currently available, but there are only 100 grams
 thereof 585 stocked. The interface 560 shows that 300 grams of broth mix
 586 should always be available at the shop. Since the available quantity
 is lower that the minimum quantity, the &quot;broth mix&quot; ingredient is
 highlighted to indicate that action is required to replenish the quantity
 of available ingredient. Another ingredient, cinnamon sugar 577, has run
 out (a null quantity 587 is associated thereto). Its minimum quantity is
 100 grams 588. When the operator has finished preparing, for example, 300
 grams of cinnamon sugar, the amount currently available of cinnamon sugar
 will be updated by the operator in the stock database 57, via the stock
 manager application 51&apos;, as described above. This new information will be
 visualized in the staff interface 560. Cinnamon sugar is very simple to
 prepare, as it requires cinnamon to be simply mixed with white sugar. A
 recipe says that 50 grams of cinnamon should be mixed with 250 grams of
 sugar to obtain 300 grams of cinnamon sugar. The recipe is stored in the
 ingredients database and is retrieved by the interface 560 via the
 ingredients manager application 41&apos;. The recipe is visualized by the
 operator when he selects the cinnamon sugar ingredient 577 in the
 interface 560 of FIG. 11. The operator can input in the interface 560
 that he is intending to prepare 300 grams of ingredient. When he has
 finished the preparation and hits the button &quot;Exit&quot;, the BOOFE 50&apos; will
 translate the action in an update of the stock database via the stock
 manager application 51&apos;. In this case, 250 grams of sugar will be
 subtracted to the value of the record for the ingredient &quot;white sugar&quot;,
 and 50 grams will be subtracted to the value of the record for the
 ingredient &quot;cinnamon&quot;. &quot;White sugar&quot; and &quot;cinnamon&quot;, according to the
 definition of single and compound ingredients given hereinabove, are two
 single ingredients. Nevertheless, they will have minimum quantity values
 associated to their respective records in the stock database. This
 information could also be included in the staff interface 560, in an
 additional list of &quot;Single ingredients&quot;. Single ingredients will be
 replenished by regular supplier deliveries or special deliveries of
 single ingredients could be instigated by the operator. A single
 ingredient will not have a recipe or recipes associated, but could have a
 set of instructions to instigate delivery from a supplier (e.g. supplier
 contact and instructions on how to place an order). Wilted spinach 578 is
 available in sufficient quantity 589 (1000 grams), the minimum quantity
 thereof 590 being just 300 grams.

 [0279] The staff interface 560 of FIG. 11 includes also a list of &quot;grab&amp;go items&quot; 573 and a list of associated total quantities 574. In this
 case, as natural, the quantities of grab&amp;go items are expressed in
 units or pieces rather than grams, as for the compound ingredients.
 Reading from the list of associated quantities, it can be seen, for
 example, that the prawn and guacamole sandwich 580 and the summer berry
 cake 582 are currently well stocked, with respectively 12 and 13 pieces
 593, 597 available to be grabbed from the grab&amp;go fridge of the fast
 food outlet (the minimum quantity is 10 pieces in either case 594, 598).
 There is only one feta and mango salad left 579, when its minimum
 quantity is five pieces 592. The operator should therefore soon prepare
 new units of feta and mango salad 579, and he will do so in the usual
 way, i.e. he will visualize a recipe and/or instructions from the
 ingredients database 43 and will then accordingly be updating the stock
 database via the BOOFE 50&apos; and stock manager application 51&apos;. The crunchy
 vegetable sandwiches 581 are also below their minimum quantity 596 (five
 pieces): only three 595 are currently present in the fridge and therefore
 action is required from the operator as described above.

 DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS 

 [0280] Reference has been made in the description above to dishes; however
 it is clear that wherever the term &quot;dish&quot; has been used, this could have
 been replaced by a more general definition such as &quot;consumable unit&quot;,
 which includes, for example, simple or mixed drinks or beverages.

 [0281] With reference to FIG. 4A, the in-store user terminals could be
 replaced by a single in-store ordering kiosk equipped with a card reader.
 A customer of the fast food outlet will use a loyalty card in conjunction
 with the reader to interact with the system 1000. In particular, the
 customer&apos;s loyalty card will store information about a preferred meal of
 the customer and it can be used to order the meal in one single action,
 for example by swiping the card into the reader to upload an order into
 the system 1000. The loyalty card can also store personalized nutritional
 requirements of the user, for example a daily recommended intake of
 calories that has been prescribed by a doctor, or in relation with a
 medical condition of the customer. The information wanted by the customer
 is then retrieved by the FOOPE 40 in cooperation with the system
 database, as described before.

 [0282] The ordering kiosk can be equipped with a label printer which can
 print a label with the information calculated or retrieved by the FOOPE.
 In this case, the customer will be able to stick a personalized label to
 the meal he ordered when the meal is delivered to him. The kiosk can
 therefore implement an order by order label printing service.

 [0283] The concept of order by order label printing service can also be
 implemented directly at one of the terminals 35, by integrating a label
 printing machine with such terminals and therefore with the system.

 [0284] It will also be possible for a customer to use the system of FIG. 4A
 as a computation tool, for example to analyze a proposed order, without
 necessarily finalizing the order.

 [0285] With reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the ingredient manager
 application and the stock manager application can be accessible to the
 staff of the fast food outlet, or the access can be reserved to a manager
 of the fast food outlet if it is intended that the manager should be the
 only role who can create ingredients and recipes in the ingredients or
 system database or can alter the database records, for example by adding
 or removing any of the data structure fields describing the status of a
 certain stock of a single or compound ingredient, or of a &quot;grab&amp;go;&quot; meal.

 [0286] In FIG. 5A, the pool of attributes of the ingredients database could
 also contain pricing records relative to specific quantities of
 ingredients. Discount information can also be included, for example to
 define that all meals including the ingredient &quot;duck&quot; should be
 discounted proportionally to the quantity of duck used. Therefore, a
 sandwich or a soup including duck as an ingredient will be discounted
 proportionally to the quantity of duck used for preparing them.

 [0287] In FIG. 5B, the &quot;My lunch&quot; information output 173 has been
 calculated for the whole proposed meal 101. However, it would be possible
 to calculate an equivalent information output for a sub-group of
 ingredients or consumable units comprised in the meal 101. For example,
 an equivalent calculation could be performed for the Parma ham sandwich
 or orange and passion fruit juice only. Alternatively, if necessary,
 individual ingredients could be taken out from such calculation, for
 example Parma ham 132. The sub-group could be customer-defined--for
 example a customer could require that &quot;calories&quot; and &quot;proteins&quot; be
 calculated only for the food-items but not for the beverages included in
 a meal.

 [0288] In FIG. 9, the three stock databases could be not connected to the
 ingredient manager application. This arrangement would be appropriate if
 any order fulfillment station will be able to fulfill any order
 irrespective of the status of their stock (for example a situation in
 which all ingredients are prepared to order and the supply of basic
 ingredients is constant).

 [0289] In FIG. 10, the increment/decrement buttons could be absent, if the
 fast food outlet intends to offer only quantities of ingredients which
 are cannot be modified interactively by the customer.

 [0290] It will be appreciated from the above that the system and method of
 the present invention obviates prior art drawbacks.

 [0291] Although the present invention has been described hereinabove with
 reference to specific embodiments, it will be apparent to the skilled
 person in the art that modifications lie within the spirit and scope of
 the present invention.
