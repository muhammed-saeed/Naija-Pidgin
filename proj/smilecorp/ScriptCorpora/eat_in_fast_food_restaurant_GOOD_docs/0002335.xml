ALHAMRA&apos;A RESTAURANT (YEMEN): UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

by DAO 

This Restaurant has everything! And you don’t have to speak a single word of Arabic to get a good meal. The Alhamra’a Restaurant looks like a McDonald&apos;s Restaurant from the outside and like a Kebab shop in the entrance. Don’t let that fool you. This is a large complex that includes the following:•Fast Food (shwarmas, etc.)•Full Service, but fast restaurant•Family orientated restaurant•Lovely garden area with a large fountain•Dinning hall for large events•Prayer area•Clean Toilets and wash area•Hygienic cooking areas/staffAbove all it has great food! And the best part is this:Where the cashier is located is one real example of every food item and drink they do, covered up. They do this every day. You can see what they make, as they make it, and the price is written on each one. Look closer at the 2nd picture. Great food, great prices and the staff could not be more friendly. They...
 
Arabic Cuisine: General view

by Mel_H 

Arabic cuisine has its roots in tent cookery.Nomadic tribes could use only transportable foods such as rice and dates, or ambulatory stock like sheep and camels in their recipes - which tended to be rough sketches rather than strict formulae.Originally, the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on a diet of dates, wheat, barley, rice and meat,with a heavy emphasis on yogurt products, such as laban.The nomadic Bedouin influence is broadened by other cuisines from the Arab world, notably from Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.Arabian cuisine today is the result of a combination of richly diverse cuisines, incorporating the Levant Cuisine,Egyptian Cuisine and the distinctive Cuisines of the Arabian Gulf&amp;Yemen and The North African Arab countries resulting in a highly diverse food and drink culture.The Levant countries primarily Syria and Lebanon `s contributions,have been the...

Local Arabic cold drinks

by Mel_H 

I `m often asked about Syrian/Arabic cuisine from foodie travellers on the forums so here you go ....Kindly note that i`ll be writing about food and drink from the levant , mainly Syrian of which some are common or found in other parts of the Arab world too as the cuisine varies accordingly.The levantine consist of mainly Syria /Leb./Jor.... All photos here on the travelogues were taken by me earlier on as i `m merely transfering them from my past blogs about Arabic culture which i no longer contribute to and have discontinued.Local cold drinks or juices associated more so with the fasting month of Ramadan and available throughout the year are Laban or Laban Airaan which is a yoghurt based drink , Kamaredeen an apricot based drink and Tamar Hindi made from tamarind as well as Jalab made from blackberries,it helps to know the names and constituents just incase you visit during this period...
 
Any restaurant in the Middle East: Privacy Issues

by JohnniOmani 

Once again I cant give a correct description about a specific location because I want to make this tip about being in a restaurant with men and women. The Middle East restaurant scene may seem complex due to different seating areas but if you follow the rules and have a heads up from the locals then your experience may be one of your favorite aspects of the Middle East. Women generally sit with their family members in the family room and men are strongly discouraged from sitting in the area if you are travelling by yourself. If you meet some locals and they invite you to accompany them in the family room then that is perfectly acceptable and chances are you will have your meal paid for. In general, ask the waiter or deskman where you should sit and take your lead from the local single men.
 
Oddly enough it is very...

by EricJS 

Oddly enough it was very difficult to find restaurants that specialized in Arab cuisine. Oriental and Indian restaurants outnumber all others (at least that was the state of things when my parents left in 1995). In general, the style and taste of the oriental restaurants is close to American Chinese and Japanese, but with slightly different flavors and better quality. No strange un-meat-like meat here and the portions are twice as big! There are also many great Indian, Philipino, Thai and Korean places to eat.
 
Eating Cheap...

by coceng 

If you are like me, travel cheap&amp;eating cheap or you just don&apos;t care to find a restaurant around The Middle East, you might as well sample some street breads as featured on my photo on the left.Get yourself a bottle of mineral water&amp;buy 1 or 2 of those breads&amp;munch away !Definitely would give you some energy that you need.Err, maybe that would give you an upset stomach ?Certainly not to me !Photo was taken in Beirut.
 
several: Hamah, Syria

by call_me_rhia 

BREAKFAST-&quot;the bakery&quot;, but it&apos;s not called like this, since the sign is only in arabic. It sells gigantic chocolate croissants and cakesDirections: sharia al quwatli. As u leave the Cairo hotel, turn left and walk about 3 blocks. It&apos;s the shop with the fake marble frontFULL MEALS AND SNACKS-&quot;al Marakheb Bridge restaurant&quot;is a nice restuarant on the river facing the norias. Great mezzes and nice cups of chai. They might also serve full meals.Directions: al Marakheb Bridge on the orontes river, near sharia abu al feda, where the microbuses depart.
