 Grapes Lower Blood Pressure 
 Posted on October 30, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
A new study in the Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences claims flavonoids in grapes may help LOWER blood pressure and REDUCE heart muscle damage . Especially in individuals consuming salt-heavy diets; Reuters reports.

 Favonoids are superstars ! And they’re NOT limited to grapes. Many foods, like broccoli and other green vegetables, are potent sources of flavonoids and healthful compounds like vitamins E, A, C and K and fiber, folate, lutein and lycopene.

And previous research has determined eating flavonoid-rich plant foods ENHANCE heart health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood flow and according to Dr. Fuhrman, you can eat broccoli and grapes everyday , in unlimited quantities!

 Do You Take Your Health For Granted? 
 Posted on October 30, 2008 by Guest Blogger 
 Editor’s Note: This is a guest post from Scott Wharton of HealthandMen and does NOT necessarily represent the opinions of DiseaseProof or Dr. Fuhrman. 

Do you take your health for granted? Chances are if you&apos;re reading this right now, you don&apos;t. However I was heading home late last night and I noticed a billboard for a wellness radio show and for some reason it got me to thinking about how many people probably drive by that everyday and think,“Why?”

When you go to the grocery store the first section that is in most markets is the produce. Perhaps one of the most important sections of the super market, filled with the healthiest items in the store. How many people pretty much bypass this section almost all together and go about buying the same things they bought the last time?

How many people give no thought to simply eating healthy food and fill their shopping cart with the same garbage each and every time? You&apos;d be surprised. Sure they might buy some canned vegetables, but that’s only because they feel that they have to have a vegetable on their dinner plate and don’t really want that vegetable for its nutritional value.

Most people don&apos;t become health conscious until the errors of their ways catch up to them and they suffer a heart attack or a simple cholesterol test show dangerous levels. They go about their daily lives and have the mentality that they feel healthy so they must be healthy.

Health insurance rates for men are normally higher than women&apos;s rates. One reason is because men can be ignorant. They brush off minor aches and pains and don&apos;t get regular check-ups. Those minor aches and pains could be symptoms of bigger underlying issues and sometimes it&apos;s not caught until it&apos;s too late.

I think women are more health conscious for various reasons. One is the fact that women are generally more self-conscious about their weight and often do research on what they can do about it. When they research they learn all sorts of things that they never knew before and they start becoming more aware of their personal health. Also, most women are not as stubborn as men and normally get themselves checked out when they feel something isn&apos;t right.

It goes back to the mentality that I feel fine, so I must be fine. There are also people that just don&apos;t care. They live for the moment and live unhealthy lifestyles. They may be happy, but it can create hardships for themselves and other people in the long run when they are beating up their bodies from the inside out. You don&apos;t have to be paranoid about your health, just be aware.

Over 500 years ago English philosopher, Sir Francis Bacon said&quot;Scientia Potentia Est&quot;, which translates to today&apos;s&quot;Knowledge Is Power&quot;and in U.S. Military leadership they teach&quot;Know yourself and seek self improvement&quot;. These are words to live by in both a moral sense and health sense.

Don&apos;t take your health for granted and encourage others to do the same.

 High Fat Diet Worsens Sleep Apnea 
 Posted on October 24, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
A new study suggests individuals eating diets HIGH saturated fat are MORE likely to develop severe symptoms of sleep apnea .

The research appears in Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine . Reuters reports:
 Among 320 adults they assessed, those with severe symptoms of sleep apnea generally ate diets higher in cholesterol and artery-clogging saturated fat. While obesity does raise the risk of severe sleep apnea, the findings were not explained by the study participants&apos; weight.
 
The results, say the researchers, suggest that eating habits may contribute to the increased risks of heart disease and stroke seen in people with sleep apnea.

&quot;This unhealthy diet may be one reason why sleep apnea contributes to a greater risk of cardiovascular disease,&quot;senior researcher Dr. Stuart Quan , of Harvard Medical School in Boston .
 
But researchers insist MORE studies are needed to better understand the relationship between POOR diet, sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.

Like how bad food and obesity increases heart risk!

 Surprise, Bad Food Causes Heart Attacks! 
 Posted on October 22, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
A new study by McMaster University claims people eating a diet rich in meat and junk food are MORE likely to have heart attacks than people eating mostly fruits and vegetables.

The research appears in the journal Circulation . Reuters reports:
 People who ate more fruits and vegetables had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack compared to people who ate little or none of these foods, they found.
 
People eating a Western diet had a 35 percent greater risk of heart attack compared to people who consumed little or no fried foods and meat.
 
Not a shocker! The link between saturated fat and heart attack is WIDELY accepted. Luckily a PLANT-based diet has been shown to prevent and reserve heart disease .

But this guy had to learn the hard way. His butter-based diet nearly killed him!

 Stop Thief, Don&apos;t Eat those Nuts! 
 Posted on October 16, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
Thieves made a DUMB mistake! These dopes stole 660 pounds of hazelnuts . The problem is they’re full of hydrogen phosphate gas, used to extend self life, making them poisonous! German authorities have warned them NOT to eat them; Reuters reports.

I find that HILARIOUS, but don’t let it distract you. Nuts are SUPER foods; pistachios lower cholesterol , nuts and seeds promote weight-loss , cashews make bones strong and almonds fight free radicals and reduce inflammation . Nuts, eat some!

 Me Man, Me Eat Fat! 
 Posted on September 29, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
Men get a bad rap. Just look at sitcoms. Male characters are depicted as chubby oafish slobs, basically CAVEMEN in flannel shirts. Like these guys from According to Jim ; via YouTube .

Now, AOL Men’s Fitness Center feeds into this Neanderthal nonsense with an article promoting the“healthful”benefits of saturated fats ; like beef, pork chops, cheese, butter and sour cream. Get a load of this:
 For years you&apos;ve heard that eating saturated fat is like pouring superglue into your arteries. But the fact is, this forbidden fat actually increases your HDL (good) cholesterol, which helps remove plaque from your artery walls, decreasing your risk of heart disease. So quit depriving yourself and start eating these eight foods -- without guilt. 
Make NO mistake. Eating copious amounts of saturated fat from animal products is NOT healthy ; via Plos Medicine . For example, this guy ate a diet loaded with clarified butter and his heart was so COATED with dangerous fat, he needed emergency surgery to save his life!

A fat-based diet is DEADLY advice without an air of authority. It’s journalistically irresponsible, because many men are already looking for an excuse NOT to cut back on meat, dairy and other saturated fats.

Dr. Fuhrman wanted to weigh in. His thoughts:
 AOL is promoting cancer, heart disease and dementia by promoting the consumption of red meat, butter and dark meat poultry as healthy and not disease promoting. It shows the pervasive influence and web-presence of the pro-animal fat crowd, in spite of a plethora of irrefutable scientific findings proving otherwise. 
The bulk of evidence is IRREFUTABLE; red meat, butter and saturated animal fats are linked to cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia. And thousands of scientific studies agree! Burying your head in the sand does NOT change facts.

Guys, if you’re striving for optimal health, you MUST restrict unhealthy foods. Research links the consumption of dairy products with prostate cancer and eating meat with prostate cancer ; via CAT.INIST . So, AOL Men’s Fitness Center is promoting getting prostate cancer—which can make you IMPOTENT—not exactly good advice for men!

Okay, I’m NOT an expert, but I am a guy. I watch football, lift weights and play fantasy sports, but I also do Yoga , avoid meat or dairy and I LOVE of salads . Does this make me any LESS of a man? No! So, take Dr. Fuhrman’s advice and don’t be another knuckle-dragging modern caveman.

 Woman Goes Raw, Drops 160 Pounds 
 Posted on September 29, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Angela Stokes used to weigh 300 pounds , fed up she switched to a raw food diet. No more meat, animal products or processed foods, just LOTS of fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds. She lost an AMAZING 160 pounds; CNN reports.

Kudos to Angela, great job! Plants foods promote healthy bodyweight and disease-prevention and cutting saturated fats—found in animal foods— helps lower cholesterol and maintain heart health ; from Health magazine.

Now, raw food diets DO help people consume MORE fruits and vegetables, but raw food isn’t the ONLY answer. Eating cooked foods in fine, Dr. Fuhrman explains low-temperature cooking and steaming can actually enhance the nutrient-quality of vegetables .

Nevertheless, Angela’s accomplishment is STILL a great ambassador for vegetable-based diets!

 Pistachios Lower LDL Cholesterol... 
 Posted on September 16, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
Nuts are powerful foods! Study after study shows nuts not only lower cholesterol, but also protect against age-related diseases ; like heart disease and cancer. And now, new research by Pennsylvania State University claims PISTACHIOS can lower cholesterol.

It appears in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . WebMD reports:
 First, participants spent two weeks on a standard American diet rich in full-fat cheese, oil, and butter and lacking pistachios.
 
Next came a month on a low-fat diet without pistachios, another month on a healthy diet that included one daily serving of pistachios, and a third month eating a similar diet with two daily servings of pistachios, with two-week breaks between each type of diet.

Participants got all their food, packaged into appropriate serving sizes, from the researchers. And they stuck to their assigned diets pretty well, the study shows.

Average LDL levels fell when participants ate pistachios -- not enough to get their LDL levels into the optimal range, but enough to get it out of the&quot;borderline high&quot;category.

LDL cholesterol level dropped by 9% during the month that participants ate a daily serving of pistachios and by 12% when they had two daily servings of pistachios.
 
This story first broke in May, with researchers suggesting that one or two handfuls of pistachios can LOWER cardiovascular risk by reducing LDL or&quot;bad&quot;cholesterol levels; via HealthDay News . Dr. Fuhrman recommends walnuts for heart health too.

And, other nuts, like pecans and almonds, help strengthen bones, improve glucose control and provide key vitamins and minerals . That’s why I’m NUTS!

 Cancer-Risk, Hotdogs of Doom... 
 Posted on August 28, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
This is fitting. Amidst the Maple Leaf deli meat killing spree The Cancer Project has released a TV commercial attacking hotdogs as a cancer-risk. See for yourself:
 
 

Finally, a gutsy ad! Hotdogs are not your friend. In fact, Dr. Fuhrman considers processed meats one of the WORST meat options —along with red meat. Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the PCRM and head of The Cancer Project , defends the commercial . Via CBS News :
 Check the label of a name-brand hot dog, and chances are fat provides around 80 percent of total calories, more than double what&apos;s often advised. What&apos;s more, saturated fat and trans fat - the fats most strongly linked with artery-clogging - are common ingredients, in some cases providing at least half the fat content.
The hot dog council called the new ad an alarmist scare tactic, but the promoters, a group called The Cancer Project, defend their campaign.

Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, called the ad&quot;a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern.&quot;Barnard also heads The Cancer Project, an offshoot of his anti-meat advocacy group.

Hot dogs may be considered as American as apple pie, but Barnard said it&apos;s time to change that tradition.

&quot;Children are born with no traditions whatsoever,&quot;he said.&quot;You or I might think a hot dog, that just goes with baseball ... We can always change our traditions to be healthful.&quot;

The new ad is based on an analysis of five studies in adults by scientists working with cancer research groups not affiliated with Barnard&apos;s.

Their report last November said eating 50 grams a day of processed meats for several years increases colorectal cancer risk by 21 percent. That equals about one hot dog a day or two deli slices of bologna or five slices of bacon.
 
There’s a hotdog council! I’d love to see their cholesterol numbers. Now, despite the wiener consortiums self-preservation exclamations, processed meats DON’T support health and DO increase cancer-risk, but don’t take my word for it. Remember this post: News from The Cancer Project .

 Health Points: Monday 8.24.08 
 Posted on August 25, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Many of the treatments used to address obesity appear to increase prostate cancer-risk in men. Michelle Rizzo of Reuters explains: 
 In a population-based, case-control study, the researchers matched 1,001 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 with 942 age-matched cancer-free controls from King County, Washington.
 
No overall association was observed between the risk of prostate cancer and the current or past use of statin treatment. Duration of statin use was also not associated with prostate cancer risk.

&quot;We also found no evidence that use of a statin was associated with risk of developing more aggressive subtypes of prostate caner,&quot;Stanford said in an interview with Reuters Health.&quot;Overall we found no support for the current hypothesis that statin use may reduce risk of prostate cancer.&quot;

However, the results do suggest a significant increase in the risk of developing prostate cancer associated with current statin use and with longer durations of use among obese men (defined as a body mass index of 30 greater).
 
 New research suggest feeding kids fatty diets—including foods like ice cream and milk— may up their odds of becoming obese later in life . Via the NewScientist : 
 A team led by Linda Bartoshuk at the University of Florida in Gainesville surveyed 1300 people, 245 of whom had a history of ear infections, and found that among the over-30s, those who had suffered from ear infections were twice as likely to be obese as those with no such history. A subsequent analysis of four US medical databases confirmed the link. Those who had suffered from ear infections also rated fattier foods as 18 per cent more pleasurable than the others.
 
Infections may damage the chorda tympani taste nerve, which is stimulated at the front of the tongue and passes through the middle ear to the brain, says Bartoshuk. She says that the nerve normally inhibits some of the creamy sensations of fatty foods, as part of a response that inhibits tactile sensations that would otherwise make us gag. But nerve damage would lower this inhibiting effect, making foods seem creamier and so more pleasurable.
 
 Here’s more on that research claiming that Yoga eases the physical and mental symptoms of menopause . Reuters reports: 
 The postures, breathing and meditation included in the yoga intervention were&quot;aimed at one common effect, i.e. &apos;to develop mastery over modifications of the mind&apos; ... through &apos;slowing down the rate of flow of thoughts in the mind,&apos;&quot;the researchers explain.
 
Women in the yoga group also listened to lectures on using yoga to manage stress and other yoga-related topics, while those in the control group heard lectures on diet, exercise, the physiology of menopause, and stress.

After eight weeks, women in the yoga group showed a significant reduction in hot flashes, night sweats, and sleep disturbances, while the women in the control group did not, Dr. R. Chattha, of the Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana in Bangalore, India, and colleagues found.
 
 Alabama is going to extreme measures to decrease obesity. They’re going to charge state employees for being fat . More from Phillip Rawls of BusinessWeek : 
 The state has given its 37,527 employees a year to start getting fit -- or they&apos;ll pay $25 a month for insurance that otherwise is free.
 
Alabama will be the first state to charge overweight state workers who don&apos;t work on slimming down, while a handful of other states reward employees who adopt healthy behaviors.

Alabama already charges workers who smoke -- and has seen some success in getting them to quit -- but now has turned its attention to a problem that plagues many in the Deep South: obesity.

The State Employees&apos; Insurance Board this week approved a plan to charge state workers starting in January 2010 if they don&apos;t have free health screenings.
 
 No surprise here. A new study has determined that exercise and limiting television time helps kids stay fit and trim . Amy Norton of Reuters reports: 
 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children devote no more than two hours per day to watching TV and playing video games.
 
Experts also encourage children to exercise regularly; some groups, including the AAP, recommend that boys move enough to take 13,000 steps each day, while girls should strive for 11,000. Another common recommendation is for children and teenagers to get at least one hour of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week.

For the new study, researchers at Iowa State University in Ames looked at whether there were weight differences between children who met or did not meet recommendations for&quot;screen time&quot;and exercise.

They found that among 709 7- to 12-year-olds, those who did not meet either recommendation were three to four times more likely to be overweight than their peers who met both guidelines.
 
 The push for mandatory HPV vaccinations is making more and more researchers question their widespread use . Elisabeth Rosenthal of The New York Times explains: 
 Both vaccines target the human papillomavirus, a common sexually transmitted virus that usually causes no symptoms and is cleared by the immune system, but which can in very rare cases become chronic and cause cervical cancer.
 
The two vaccines, Gardasil by Merck Sharp&amp;Dohme and Cervarix by GlaxoSmithKline, target two strains of the virus that together cause an estimated 70 percent of cervical cancers. Gardasil also prevents infection with two other strains that cause some proportion of genital warts. Both vaccines have become quick best sellers since they were licensed two years ago in the United States and Europe, given to tens of millions of girls and women.

“Despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials, we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer,”Dr. Charlotte J. Haug, editor of The Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association, wrote in an editorial in Thursday’s issue of The New England Journal.“With so many essential questions still unanswered, there is good reason to be cautious.
 
 Sad news ladies, it appears that in some states, women&apos;s life expectancy is dropping . Via Chris Sparling of That’sFit : 
 According to the data, women&apos;s life expectancy saw a significant decline in 180 counties between 1983 and 1999. The cause for this precipitous drop? The folks at Women&apos;s Health attribute it to chronic diseases associated with obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure.
 
Here is a quick look at the U.S. counties that have experienced the greatest drop (numbers measured in years of average decline in female life expectancy):

 Pulaski County, VA - 5.8
Radford, VA - 5.8
Dolores County, CO - 3.3
Montezuma County, CO - 3.3
San Juan County, CO - 3.3.
East Feliciana Parish, LA - 3.2
St. Helena Parish, LA - 3.2
West Feliciana Parish, LA - 3.2
Callaway County, MO - 3.0
Danville, VA - 3.0 
 
 Rocker Ted Nugent calls vulgar and displeasing to look at . Its over at TheRockDose , take a look: 
 Ted Nugent has never been one to beat around the bush so why should he stop now. Honestly I respect the man for the way he is willing and quick to speak his mind, but sometimes he’s a bit too blunt about things. Old Uncle Ted was on Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations show on The Travel Channel where he was exploring the elements of Southwestern cuisine and stopped by Ted Nugents ranch in Texas. Anthony and Ted were speaking on many things to include Obesity. The Nuge’said“Obesity is a manifestation of a cultural depravation in its most vulgar and displeasing-to-look-at form. And it’s suicide as a lifestyle.”Nugent also added“It all comes back to the horror, the soullessness of a trend in America that is the abandonment of parenting. Somebody’s got to go,‘You can’t eat that. You’re way too fat.‘”
 
While I can understand what Ted is saying, Obesity is more than just an image issue. The last part of his statement is true that it may lead to certain and early death, but I think someone needs to give this guy a lesson in tact.

 More on Treadmill Stress Tests... 
 Posted on July 31, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Last month NBC ’s Tim Russert suffered a fatal heart attack at age 58, shocking the country. He recently passed a stress test, so how could this happen? In a post Dr. Fuhrman explains why stress tests fail to determine heart attack risk . Here’s an excerpt:
 A stress test is not an accurate test for determining the risk of a heart attack. A stress test only identifies obstructions, it doesn&apos;t identify vulnerable plaque—the plaque that is likely to throw a clot. A stress test can only detect a blockage of more than 80% and the propensity of plaque to rupture has nothing to do with the amount of obstruction…

…Stress tests are big money-makers for doctors. They identify those people with large blockages who qualify as candidates for costly angioplasty or bypass surgery. However, drugs and medical procedures reduce risk only slightly.
 Now, Jane E. Brody of The New York Times talks to Dr. Todd D. Miller , a cardiologist and co-director of the Mayo Clinic’s Nuclear Cardiology Laboratory in Rochester, Minn., about the shortcomings of stress tests . Take a look:
 Mr. Russert’s treadmill test may have put him in the low-risk category, Dr. Miller said,“but that doesn’t mean no risk.”

“Maybe 3 patients in 1,000 with a low-risk test will die from heart disease within a year,”he said.“Among those deemed at high risk, more than 3 patients in 100 would die within a year.”

Furthermore, when the stress test is used for people who are at low risk for heart disease, an abnormal finding is most often a false positive that prompts further testing that is far more costly, Dr. Miller said.

The stress test’s main advantages are its rapidity and low cost—one-fifth to one-quarter the cost of more definitive and often more time-consuming tests like a nuclear stress test, CT coronary angiogram or standard angiogram. Medicare pays about $150 for a standard stress test, though hospitals typically charge three to four times that when the test is done on younger patients.
 Criticism for stress tests is not new. In 2007, Karen Dente, M.D. , a medical journalist based in Brooklyn, New York, stated that as stress-testing and coronary angiograms may no longer be the true gold standard for detecting coronary stenosis. Via Medscape :
 &quot;Conventional stress-testing and angiogram gives you no information on whether a plaque is going to rupture,&quot; David DuBois, MD , an attendee at the symposium and emergency medicine specialist from Pinehurst, North Carolina, told Medscape.&quot;[With these tests] there are a lot of false-positives and false-negatives,&quot;he said.


One of the hottest current discussions in the evaluation of acute coronary syndromes is centered around the use of computed tomography coronary angiography.&quot;CT technology is advancing at a very fast rate,&quot;said Amal Mattu, MD , associate professor and program director of emergency medicine residency at the University of Maryland , explaining the technology&apos;s improved detection in plaque composition and remodeling compared with conventional diagnostic tests.

&quot;If you have a radiologist that can give you an accurate reading with the new 64-head multidetector CT scans, you can detect occlusions better,&quot;according to Dr. Dubois. But we are still a long way from having the new technology replace standard coronary angiography for the detection of large coronary stenoses, he said.&quot;It is not going to change the [current] practice any time soon.&quot;
 Sadly, this information can’t help Tim Russert , but doctors and patients should now take note that traditional testing procedures might be lulling us into a false sense of security by not revealing crucial life-saving data. Tags: Blood Pressure , Cardiovascular Disease , Cholesterol , Research

 Study: High Apoprotein B Not Good 
 Posted on July 23, 2008 by Joel Fuhrman 
 Dr. Fuhrman talks about the new research on lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins as risk markers for myocardial infarction —via The Lancet. 

This study reveals that the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is more predictive of heart attack occurrence compared to cholesterol levels or cholesterol ratios. That means that a high ApoB (Apoprotein B) is not good and a better indicator of risk compared to LDL cholesterol.

Keep in mind that a calculated LDL is not as accurate as a direct LDL and the type of LDL measured in Apoprotein B is even a better predictor. Also the LDL particle number is still likely the most accurate test for heart attack risk.

In spite of all these numbers and their potential to predict risk, the bottom line is that all of them go down with a vegetable-based diet and go up with sloppy eating habits. But not only that, the high-nutrient diet, contains positive benefits to reduce risk of heart disease not reflected in these numbers, so the numbers are not as predictive compared to a qualitative index of one’s diet such as my Menu Aggregate Nutrient Density Index (MANDI Scores) and a tape measure around ones’waist.

In summary, to predict one’s risk of heart disease, or to give someone assurance they are not at risk, it is important to consider:

 Waist measurement or waist fat accumulation (body fat) MANDI Scores Exercise tolerance Non-medicated systolic blood pressure The blood risk markers noted above

 Vytorin, Going Down the Toilet 
 Posted on July 22, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 A clinical trial has determined that the cholesterol-lowering drug Vytorin fails to help people with heart disease AND increases their risk of cancer. Alex Berenson of The New York Times reports:
 The scientists who reported on the trial, called Seas, cautioned against panicking over the cancer findings, saying that even well-designed clinical trials sometimes produce chance results. A review of two other, much larger trials did not find a similar risk, they said.

Vytorin and Zetia, a companion drug, are prescribed each month to almost three million people worldwide and are among the world’s top-selling medicines.

But other cardiologists and epidemiologists said that the cancer risk could not be so easily dismissed.

The findings of the Seas trial will heighten concerns about Vytorin’s safety and effectiveness, said Dr. Steven Nissen, a former president of the American College of Cardiology and a longtime critic of Vytorin. Six months ago, a fourth clinical trial, called Enhance, also failed to show that Vytorin benefited patients, leading a panel of top cardiologists to recommend using Vytorin and Zetia only as a last resort.

Since that recommendation, Vytorin and Zetia prescriptions have plunged, though the drugs remain among the largest sellers for Merck and Schering- Plough, which jointly sell them. The drugs had combined sales of $5 billion last year.
 These drugs have been sinking for months. Take a look:

 Ways to Lower Your Cholesterol... 
 Posted on July 11, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 I was reading That’sFit and found this link to Jonny Bowden’s Simple Ways to Improve Your Cholesterol—Now , on Remedy Life . Here are Jonny’s 5 tips:

 Eat more fiber. Lose weight. Exercise. Choose cholesterol-lowering foods. Take your supplements. 
I was a little skeptical at first because Jonny has popped up on low-carb blogs— we all know how kooky those are —but his tips are right on point; especially when he suggests eating healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, cereals, and legumes.

As for taking supplements, Dr. Fuhrman sells his own , so that’s a good place to start. Also, Jonny recently provided the Well blog with his list of super foods . If you skip the canned sardines and canned pumpkin, it’s pretty good too. Via Well :

 Beets Cabbage Swiss chard Cinnamon Pomegranate juice Dried plums Pumpkin seeds Turmeric Frozen blueberries

 More Doctors Bashing Statins for Kids 
 Posted on July 10, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Dr. Fuhrman wasn’t the only doctor to blast The American Academy of Pediatrics’recommendation to give statins to young children . Tara Parker-Pope of The New York Times found more . Here’s a mini-round up from the report:

 “What are the data that show this is helpful preventing heart attacks?”asked Dr. Darshak Sanghavi, a pediatric cardiologist and assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.“How many heart attacks do we hope to prevent this way? There’s no data regarding that.” “To be frank, I’m embarrassed for the A.A.P. today,”said Dr. Lawrence Rosen of Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, vice chairman of an academy panel on traditional and alternative medicine. He added:“Treatment with medications in the absence of any clear data? I hope they’re ready for the public backlash.” “It will open the door for pharmaceutical companies to heavily advertise and promote their use in 8-year-olds, when we don’t know yet the long-term effect on using these drugs on prepubertal kids,”said Dr. Alan Greene, a pediatrician in Danville, Calif. “When you have a kid whose cholesterol looks like an overweight 65-year-old, what do you do?”said Dr. David Ludwig, director of the childhood obesity program at Children’s Hospital in Boston.“The committee had to balance the risks of treating children with powerful drugs, about which there is limited long-term data, with the risks of not treating children with unprecedented cardiovascular disease risk factors.” 
Good to know there are SOME sane minds out there. Tags: Cholesterol

 My Thoughts on Giving Children Cholesterol Drugs 
 Posted on July 9, 2008 by Joel Fuhrman 
 Dr. Fuhrman responds to The American Academy of Pediatrics’recommendation to give young children cholesterol-fighting drugs . 

Clearly the medical profession and the drug companies form a coalition that economically monopolizes the health delivery to Americans. The effect is a health care system dependent on drugs, instead of encouragement of rationale lifestyle habits. When you consider that most antibiotics (which are highly toxic and already linked to later life cancers in scientific studies) prescribed to children are given for inappropriate reasons and viral illnesses in which they have no value, you could almost say that most pediatricians spend a large portion of their time delivering toxic medications to fragile children without justification. The harm they do may be much greater than anyone ever imagines. Now it gets even worse.

We have a nation of overweight parents, addicted to processed foods and convenience foods, who are poisoning themselves and creating a nation of overweight, diabetic and cancer-prone children, and the answer of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association is to recommend a more aggressive use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Why don’t we just give all these kids gastric bypass surgery instead? Besides nobody knows the long-term risks of statins taken since childhood. This is just another example of the failure of health care in this country and that things will continue to worsen in the future as we continue to place drugs as the focal point of health care interventions.

I say—our health is tied to our country’s fertile soils with access to micronutrient rich produce never so available in recent human history; fresh fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts and other natural foods that are infinitely more effective than drugs. We have an unprecedented opportunity to be healthier than ever before and we can better use our resources educating and motivating our country to eat healthier and utilize less medical care and drugs, not more.

 Kids on Cholesterol Drugs: American Academy of Pediatrics Goes Bonkers! 
 Posted on July 7, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Why bother teaching kids to eat right. Let them eat all the junk they want and then prescribe them meds just like their fat parents. Get this. The American Academy of Pediatrics is now recommending giving children as young as 8 cholesterol-fighting drugs . The Associated Press reports:
 Several of these drugs are approved for use in children and data show that increasing numbers are using them.

&quot;If we are more aggressive about this in childhood, I think we can have an impact on what happens later in life ... and avoid some of these heart attacks and strokes in adulthood,&quot;Daniels said. He has worked as a consultant to Abbott Laboratories and Merck&amp;Co., but not on matters involving their cholesterol drugs.

Drug treatment would generally be targeted for kids at least 8 years old who have too much LDL, the&quot;bad&quot;cholesterol, along with other risky conditions, including obesity and high blood pressure.

For overweight children with too little HDL, the&quot;good&quot;cholesterol, the first course of action should be weight loss, more physical activity and nutritional counseling, the academy says.

Pediatricians should routinely check the cholesterol of children with a family history of inherited cholesterol disease or with parents or grandparents who developed heart disease at an early age, the recommendations say. Screening also is advised for kids whose family history isn&apos;t known and those who are overweight, obese or have other heart disease risk factors.
 Well, if it wasn’t official before. It sure is now! American medicine has gone nucking futs! No doubt, drug companies have their hands in this—it reeks of their stink. Now, I also read about this on the Well blog. Check this out:
 The guidelines give no guidance on how long a child should stay on drug treatment. But they do say the first goal should be to lower bad cholesterol levels to less than 160 milligrams or possibly as low as 110 milligrams in children with a strong family history of heart disease or other risk factors like obesity.


Because statins have been around since only the mid-1980s, there is no evidence to show whether giving statins to a child will lower the risk for heart attack in middle age.
 Clearly there is plenty of merit behind this recommendation—give me a break!

 Low HDL Linked to Poor Memory, So Go Nuts! 
 Posted on July 1, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 A new study associates HDL cholesterol—good cholesterol—with bad short-term memory in middle-aged adults . Reuters reports:
 The researchers examined the relationship between blood fats and memory using data on 3673 individuals, who were an average of 55 years old when tested between 1997 and 1999.

Short-term verbal memory was assessed at the outset with a 20-word free recall test. Memory deficit was defined as recalling no more than four words. Memory decline was defined as a reduction of two or more words between the first test and a second test, performed in 2002-2004.

The results are reported in the medical journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.

Compared with a high HDL level, low HDL was associated with memory deficit during both tests. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, illnesses, and medication use, those with low HDL were 27 percent and 53 percent more likely to have a memory deficit on the first and second test, respectively.
 Fret not, nuts and seeds are a great natural way to boost your HDL cholesterol. Dr. Fuhrman explains in Nuts&amp;Seeds Protect Against Heart Disease . Here’s a bit:
 Perhaps one of the most unexpected and novel findings in nutritional epidemiology in the past five years has been that nut consumption offers such strong protection against heart disease. Several clinical studies have observed beneficial effects of diets high in nuts (including walnuts, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts) on blood lipids.1 A review of 23 intervention trials using nuts and seeds demonstrated convincingly that eating nuts daily decreases total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.2 Not only do nuts and seeds lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol, they can help normalize a dangerous type of LDL molecule (the small, dense LDL particles that damage the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels).3


Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols with potent antioxidant and other cancer chemopreventive activities that are found in berries, nuts (especially walnuts), and seeds.4 Walnuts can reduce Creactive protein and harmful plaque adhesion molecules, two significant markers of inflammation in arteries. The result is improved, and even restored, endothelial function (which includes the elastic property of arteries that allows dilation when necessary to meet an increased demand of blood).According to the researchers, walnuts are the first food to show such cardiovascular benefits.5
 See, going nuts is a good thing!

 Tips to Lower Your Cholesterol 
 Posted on June 20, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Jacki Donaldson of That’sFit dishes some tips for lowering your cholesterol . Have a look:

 Cut down on saturated fat and trans fats and eat good fats in moderation -- they still have lots of calories. Limit calories -- eating too much can lead to weight gain, which increases your risk of high cholesterol. Eat sparingly all high cholesterol foods, like egg yolks, shrimp, and organ meats. Consider a Mediterranean-style diet, which is low in saturated and trans fats and allows for a healthy intake of unsaturated fats from fish and nuts. Maintain a healthy weight. Get 30 to 60 minutes of exercise most days of the week -- while it won&apos;t lower your cholesterol on its own, it can keep your weight down and reduce other cardiovascular risks. 
 Dr. Fuhrman’s not keen on the Mediterranean diet , but they’re decent suggestions. Actually, here’s a great tip from Dr. Fuhrman, Lower Your Cholesterol Naturally :
 Though saturated fat is the most heart-disease-promoting substance in animal products, it is not merely saturated fat and cholesterol in animal products that is the problem. Animal protein raises cholesterol too. Those who cut out red meat and instead eat plenty of chicken and fish do not see substantial changes in their cholesterol levels or a profound reduction in cardiac events.1

If you are looking for maximum protection from heart disease, your diet must receive 90 to 100 percent of its calories from unrefined plant foods. If you choose to include a small amount of animal products in your diet, white meat chicken and white meat turkey are better choices, but if you have more than one or two servings a week, you are not going to see optimal results. One serving of a non-polluted fish a week, and one serving of white meat fowl is the maximum amount of animal products permitted. Any more than that will prevent the huge drop in cholesterol level and heart disease risk observed from eating a plant-based diet style.
 The exercise tip is funny. 60 minutes a day would be a vacation for me! Continue Reading... Tags: Cardiovascular Disease , Cholesterol

 Pomegranate Juice Good for the Little Man 
 Posted on June 11, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 New research claims that drinking pomegranate juice can help with erectile dysfunction . Chris Sparling of That’s Fit passes it along:
 Pomegranate juice has for quite some time been touted for its antioxidant properties. Citing heart health as a primary benefit of its ability to help prevent free radical damage, many people made the switch to this more expensive juice in recent years…

…A University of California study revealed that drinking a glass of pomegranate juice every day helps erectile dysfunction. It turns out that the same antioxidant properties that help ward off free radical damage also prevent circulatory issues, thus offering a wee bit of help to the fellas who need it.
 I drink a shot of pomegranate juice everyday, but not for this reason! Now, Dr. Fuhrman is a big fan of pomegranates. Take a look:
 Not only are pomegranates good for your heart and blood vessels but they have been shown to inhibit breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, leukemia and to prevent vascular changes that promote tumor growth in lab animals.1


Pomegranates&apos; potent antioxidant compounds have also been shown to reduce platelet aggregation and naturally lower blood pressure, factors that prevent both heart attacks and strokes.2 Pomegranates contain high levels of flavonoids and polyphenols, potent antioxidants offering protection against heart disease and cancer. A glass of pomegranate juice has more antioxidants than red wine, green tea, blueberries, and cranberries.

Pomegranate juice has also been found to contain phytochemical compounds that stimulate serotonin and estrogen receptors, improving symptoms of depression and improving bone mass in lab animals.3

Given the fact that pomegranate juice is so rich in heart protective compounds and there are animal studies to support the beneficial findings in human studies, it makes the results of these recent investigations understandable and believable. Pomegranate is a powerful food for good health.
 So, why not give these pomegranate inspired recipes a try: Got Pomegranate?

 High Cholesterol, High Risk of Parkinson&apos;s Disease 
 Posted on June 7, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese According to a new study having high cholesterol increases your risk of Parkinson’s disease . Reuters reports:
 While it&apos;s well established that high cholesterol increases heart disease risk,&quot;the association between serum cholesterol level and neurodegenerative diseases risk has been debated,&quot;write Dr. Gang Hu, of the National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland, and colleagues.

The researchers examined this relationship in a cohort of 24,773 Finnish men and 26,153 women between the ages of 25 and 74 years. A total of 321 men and 304 women developed Parkinson&apos;s disease during an average follow-up of 18 years, the researchers report in the medical journal Neurology.

Compared to people with the lowest cholesterol, those with the highest had an 86 percent greater likelihood of developing Parkinson&apos;s disease.
 Keeping tabs on your cholesterol is important. Dr. Fuhrman talks about it in Can Cholesterol Be Too Low?

 Salt, Not a Big Deal? 
 Posted on June 5, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 This sounds a little nutty, but a new study claims that a low-salt diet might not be heart healthy after all . More from Randy Dotinga of HealthDay News :
 &quot;No one should run out and buy a salt shaker to try to improve their cardiovascular health. But we think it&apos;s reasonable to say that different people have different needs,&quot;said study author Dr. Hillel W. Cohen, an associate professor of epidemiology and population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.

The study, published online in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, doesn&apos;t confirm that a low-salt diet itself is bad for the heart. But it does say that people who eat the least salt suffer from the highest rates of death from cardiac disease.

&quot;Our findings suggest that one cannot simply assume, without evidence, that lower salt diets &apos;can&apos;t hurt,&apos;&quot;Cohen said.

Cohen and his colleagues looked at a federal health survey of about 8,700 Americans between 1988 and 1994. All were over 30, and none were on special low-salt diets.

The researchers then checked to see what happened to the volunteers by the year 2000.

Even after the researchers adjusted their statistics to account for the effect of cardiac risk factors like smoking and diabetes, the 25 percent of the population who ate the least salt were 80 percent more likely to die of cardiac disease than the 25 percent who ate the most salt.
 Yeah, I wouldn’t start downing the salt anytime soon. Dr. Fuhrman is no fan of salt. Here are his thoughts on salt and health:
 For maximum disease prevention, sodium levels should be held to the levels that are normal to our biological needs—under 1000 mg per day. High-sodium diets lead to high blood pressure, which causes an estimated two-thirds of all strokes and almost half of all heart attacks. According to the National Institute of Health. Consuming less sodium is one of the single most important ways to prevent cardiovascular disease.1 The most commonly cited behaviors that lead to maximal health and disease prevention and reversal are: not smoking; maintaining a healthy, slim body weight; eating a high-nutrient-dense diet rich in vegetables and fruits; and limiting trans fat and saturated fat. But avoiding excess sodium ranks right up there alongside them. Excess sodium consumption is a primary killer in our modern toxic food environment, but it is all too often overlooked by most people until it is too late to do anything about it.


Natural foods contain about .5 mg of sodium per calorie or less. If you are trying to keep the sodium level in your diet to a safe level, avoid foods that have more sodium than calories per serving. It would be impossible to consume too much (or too little) sodium if a person just ate a healthful diet of real food in its natural state.

If your daily intake of whole natural foods consists of about 2000 calories, your daily intake of sodium will be less than 1000 mg. By comparison, the average adult sodium intake in the United States is around 4000 mg for every 2000 calories consumed. Americans are not alone in their dangerous over-consumption of sodium. Most of the world’s population consumes 2300–4600 mg of sodium each day (1–2 teaspoons of salt).

I suggest that you should not add more than 200–300 mg of extra sodium to your diet over and above what is in natural foods. That allows you to have one serving of something each day that has some sodium added to it, but all other foods should have only the sodium that Mother Nature put in them.
 I think what the research is should say is that a crappy diet without salt isn’t that much better than a crappy diet with salt.

 Antibacterial wipes could actually spread disease . More from MedHeadlines : 
 
 Using surveillance of hospital staff to observe the ways the wipes are used routinely, researchers discovered hospital workers were using the same antimicrobial wipe on many surfaces, from bed rails to monitors, tables, and keypads. One wipe was frequently used to wipe down several surfaces or to wipe down the same surface repeatedly before being thrown away.

The research team then replicated the disinfecting methods they’d observed for laboratory analysis. The lab findings showed that some wipes were more effective than others at removing bacteria from hard surfaces but they did not kill them. When the bacteria-laden wipe was used repeatedly on one surface or on several, it spread the bacteria instead of eliminating it.
 
 Tyson Foods has been ordered to pull its antibiotic-free label . The Wall Street Journal reports : 
 The Agriculture Department, which detected the flu in samples tested at its Ames, Iowa, laboratories, said the H7N3 strain of influenza isn&apos;t dangerous to humans. Although the Tyson flock of 15,000 chickens is being destroyed, regulators aren&apos;t blocking U.S. consumers from eating chicken raised in Arkansas, the largest poultry-producing state after Georgia.


The Tyson label has been a point of contention and confusion since it was cleared by the Agriculture Department in May 2007. As the department was moving to rescind the label, Tyson officials tried to beat regulators to the punch by announcing earlier this week that it was&quot;voluntarily&quot;withdrawing the label.

Removing the label quickly is a logistical and financial headache for Tyson, which said Tuesday that the Agriculture Department&apos;s June 18 deadline is&quot;unrealistic.&quot;Tyson says it has&quot;several months&quot;of chicken labeled&quot;antibiotic-free&quot;in storage.
 
 South Korea is planning to restrict U.S. beef . The Associated Press reports: 
 
 Agriculture Minister Chung Woon-chun said earlier Tuesday that Seoul had asked the U.S. to refrain from exporting any beef from cattle 30 months of age and older, considered at greater risk of the illness.


Presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan said the president told a weekly Cabinet meeting that&quot;it is natural not to bring in meat from cattle 30 months of age and older as long as the people do not want it.&quot;

The spokesman also expressed hope that the United States would respect South Korea&apos;s position following large-scale anti-government protests over the weekend.
 
 Exposing young children to smoke increases their risk of serious infection . Reuters is on it: 
 The risk of being hospitalized was greatest among babies 6 months old and younger, but the increased risk persisted up until the children were 8 years old, Dr. M. K. Kwok of the University of Hong Kong and colleagues found. Children who were premature or low birth weight were particularly vulnerable.


The findings suggest that secondhand smoke exposure may not only be harmful to children&apos;s respiratory tracts, but to their immune systems as well, Kwok and colleagues say.

Hong Kong banned smoking in public places in 2007, but babies and children may still be exposed to secondhand smoke at home, the researchers note in their report in the journal Tobacco Control. While the danger smoke exposure poses to children&apos;s developing respiratory systems is well understood, less is known about its effects on overall infection risks.
 
 New research claims that fat cells release hormones to make us fatter . Regina Nuzzo of The Los Angeles Times report: 
 
 Scientists previously thought that fat cells were relatively passive and inert. Now they have evidence that fat cells are metabolically active, continuously communicating with the brain and other organs through at least 25 hormones and other signaling chemicals.


For example, fat cells seem to release hormones that inform the brain how much energy is left and when to stop (or start) eating, guide muscles in deciding when to burn fat and tell the liver when to replenish its fat stores.

All this cross talk can be a mixed blessing in the body, however. A healthy population of fat cells, for example, helps the immune system fight off infection by releasing chemicals that cause mild inflammation. But an overactive group of fat cells might keep the inflammation permanently in the&quot;on&quot;position, eventually leading to heart disease.
 
 Asthma is being linked to heart disease and stroke in women . More from Reuters : 
 Adult-onset asthma, like other inflammatory diseases that disproportionately affect women such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, may be a relatively strong risk factor for heart disease and stroke, Dr. Stephen J. Onufrak from the US Department of Agriculture, Stoneville, Mississippi told Reuters Health.


Onufrak and colleagues used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to examine the association of asthma with the risks of heart disease and stroke according to gender.

They found that, compared with their counterparts without asthma, women with adult-onset asthma had a 2.10-fold increase in the rate of heart disease and a 2.36-fold increase in the rate of stroke.

There was no association between childhood- or adult-onset asthma and heart disease or stroke in men, or between childhood-onset asthma and heart or stroke in women.
 
 Gout is being tied to an increased risk of heart disease mortality . Amy Norton of Reuters explains: 
 
 Researchers found that among 9,100 middle-aged men at higher-than- average risk of heart disease, those with gout were more likely to die of a heart attack or other cardiovascular cause over 17 years.


The findings should give men with gout extra incentive to have a doctor assess their cardiac risks, lead researcher Dr. Eswar Krishnan told Reuters Health.

And if they have modifiable risk factors -- like high cholesterol, high blood pressure or excess pounds -- it will be particularly important to get them under control, noted Krishnan, an assistant professor at Stanford University School of Medicine.
 
 Crabby McSlacker of Diet Blog offers up 7 tips for beating exercise boredom . Here are two: 
 Give Yourself Permission to Do Less. 
If you&apos;re struggling to exercise at all, bribe yourself with a mini-workout--it&apos;s better than none. You may not need to, once you get going, but the&quot;permission&quot;should be sincere. It&apos;s not the end of the world to shave off 10 minutes of cardio or skip a few strength training exercises. Check your routine for duplicate exercises that work the same muscles --you may be able to alternate rather than doing them all every time. If the thought of an easier workout gets you out the door, it&apos;s well worth doing&quot;less&quot;sometimes.


 Change Routes and Routines. 
Another obvious tip, but one we don&apos;t do often enough. If you exercise outdoors and have found the&quot;best&quot;route available for your run or walk, it can be tempting to just stick to it until you are totally sick of it but don&apos;t even realize it. Find new routes, or if there are none, revisit rejects that seemed too hilly or busy or boring--they may make a good change of pace even if they&apos;re not perfect.

 Bacon: Bad Just Got Worse! 
 Posted on June 2, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Now I’ve seen it all. Someone actually figured out how to bacon MORE unhealthy! Presenting, canned bacon. Via MREdepot.com :

 
 Please don’t tell me our soldiers are actually eating this garbage! Just look at bacon’s poor nutrient scores. From Dr. Fuhrman’s Food Scoring Guide: 

 

 And remember this report linking stomach cancer-risk to processed meats, like sausage, smoked ham, and bacon . Here’s a bit:
 A review of 15 studies showed the risk of developing stomach cancer rose by 15 to 38 percent if consumption of processed meats increased by 30 grams (1 ounce) per day, the Karolinska Institute said in a statement…

…The institute said processed meats were often salted or smoked, or had nitrates added to them, in order to extend their shelf-life which could be connected to the increased risk of stomach cancer, the fourth most common type of cancer.
 And of course Dr. Fuhrman is no fan of over-consuming animal products:
 Today the link between animal products and many different diseases is as strongly supporting in the scientific literature as the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.
 I wonder who gets up in the morning and says,“Gee, I could really go for some canned salt and fat!”Yuck Tags: Cancer , Cardiovascular Disease , Cholesterol , Hurtful Food

 Exposure to lead as a child could lead to a life behind bars . Amanda Gardner of HealthDay News reports: 
 &quot;I never would have thought that we would be seeing these effects into the later 20s,&quot;said study co-author Kim Dietrich, a professor of environmental health at the University of Cincinnati.&quot;I&apos;m actually quite astounded and quite worried about this. Although lead levels have been going down in this country, a large proportion of the population now in their 20s and 30s had blood levels in this neurotoxic range.&quot;

Childhood lead exposure has been linked with anti-social behavior, lower IQ, attention deficits, hyperactivity and weak executive control functions, all of which are risk factors for future delinquent behavior (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, in particular, is a risk factor for adult criminal behavior). Studies have also related sales of leaded gasoline or high atmospheric lead levels with criminal behavior.
 
 TreeHugger takes a look at some natural resources we’re running out of—and fast! Check it out: 
 Peak Corn: Blame Earl Butz. Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford&apos;s Secretary of Agriculture brought in the Farm Bill that dramatically increased the amount of corn produced in America. He encouraged farmers to&quot;get big or get out,&quot;and to plant crops like corn&quot;from fence row to fence row.&quot;Further billions in subsidies to farmers encouraged production, and soon America was awash in cheap grain, and with it cheap meat.


 Peak Dirt: Really, Peak Dirt- the world is losing soil 10 to 20 times faster than it is replenishing it. Drake Bennett in the Boston Globe tells us that dirt is complicated stuff, made from sand or silt, then years of plants adding nutrition, bugs and worms adding their excrement, dying and rotting.
 
 Some parts of California have serious drinking water issues; mercury and lots of it . More from EMaxHealth : 
 California Water Service Company reports high levels of mercury in water making it useless for drinking. Every attempts of purifying the water, such as boiling it, are useless, because the pollution level is high.


Mercury is much more dangerous when drinking than when breathing. However, boiling the water leads to mercury release into the air, so the pollution and health risk still exists.

California Water Service Company is now notifying residents about health concerns. Sheriff&apos;s Office itself is investigating the case to find out the reasons of why mercury level is so high.
 
 Parenting.com offers up 8 ways to be a happier mom . Here’s a couple I liked: 
 Get enough sleep: Most of us know that money can&apos;t buy happiness, but who knew that a good night&apos;s sleep just might? That&apos;s a key finding of that University of Michigan study.&quot;Making $60,000 more in annual income has less of an effect on your daily happiness than getting one extra hour of sleep a night,&quot;says study author Norbert Schwarz, Ph.D., a professor of psychology.


Take the long view: Having a sense of perspective will also improve your attitude.&quot;It gives you more patience, and it certainly awakens you to the preciousness of the moment, which is fleeting,&quot;says M.J. Ryan, author of The Happiness Makeover. She remembers the times when her daughter wanted to sit on her lap and watch a video.&quot;Yes, I had other things to do. But I said to myself, &apos;How long will this last?&apos; I&apos;m grateful for that time with her.&quot;
 
 The intestinal super bugs are coming and our antibiotics can’t stop them . The Associated Press reports: 
 The germ, resistant to some antibiotics, has become a regular menace in hospitals and nursing homes. The study found it played a role in nearly 300,000 hospitalizations in 2005, more than double the number in 2000.


The infection, Clostridium difficile, is found in the colon and can cause diarrhea and a more serious intestinal condition known as colitis. It is spread by spores in feces. But the spores are difficult to kill with most conventional household cleaners or antibacterial soap.

C-diff, as it&apos;s known, has grown resistant to certain antibiotics that work against other colon bacteria. The result: When patients take those antibiotics, competing bacteria die off and C-diff explodes.
 
 New research has determined that“silent”heart attacks increase dementia risk . David Douglas of Reuters explains: 
 Dr. Monique M. B. Breteler told Reuters Health that her group had previously found that men, but not women, with a silent heart attack are more likely to have a stroke than men who had a recognized heart attack or those who had not had any heart attack.


To examine whether this might also be the case for dementia and so-called cerebral small vessel disease, Breteler of Erasmus University, Rotterdam, and her colleagues examined data for more than 6300 participants in a population-based study.

At the start of the study, from 1990 to 1993, the subjects were classified as having a recognized heart attack, not having a heart attack, or having had an unrecognized heart attack based on EKG tracings. They were followed for the occurrence of dementia, of which there were 613 cases by 2005.
 
 No surprise here. The FDA seems some potential delays over drug safety . Reuters is on it: 
 The Food and Drug Administration gained new powers in March to require distribution limits or other restrictions on the sale of new medicines.


&quot;That&apos;s taking a considerable amount of time more for every application. That will go away in time,&quot;Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA&apos;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in an interview with Reuters.

At present, the process is adding days or weeks to reviews of drugs that need the additional safety measures, she said.

Woodcock has worked at the FDA for more than two decades. In March, she returned to a previous post running the agency&apos;s drugs division after taking other leadership responsibilities.
 
 New research claims that thinking about death makes us more likely to buy junk food . NewScientist reports: 
 Social psychologists have already shown that thoughts about death can spur buying behaviour. For example, in the months following 9/11 shops in the US noted a spike in purchases of luxury products, canned goods and sweets.


To better understand the link between thoughts of mortality and the urge to consume, Naomi Mandel at Arizona State University, Tempe, and Dirk Smeesters at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, asked 746 students to write essays on one of two topics: their death or a visit to the dentist. Each participant also completed a questionnaire designed to evaluate their level of self-esteem.

They found that subjects with low self-esteem who wrote about death ate more cookies, when given the opportunity, and bought more items from a hypothetical shopping list compared to those who wrote about the dentist. In people with high self-esteem, thoughts of death had little effect.

 Dopey About Heart Attacks... 
 Posted on May 28, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese According to a new study most people don’t know the symptoms of a heart attack . Reuters reports:
 Symptoms can include nausea and pain in the jaw, chest or left arm. But the research team said shorter hospital stays and a move to outpatient treatment have decreased the amount of patient education on the subject.

Kathleen Dracup and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Nursing said they looked at 3,522 patients in the United States, Australia and New Zealand who had previously suffered a heart attack or had undergone a procedure, such as angioplasty, for heart disease.

They found that 44 percent of them scored poorly on a true-false test measuring how savvy they were about symptoms.
 Here’s an idea. Try not to have one in the first place. Remember, only you can prevent heart attacks.

 Bulking Up on Heart Disease 
 Posted on May 27, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese New research claims that athletes who“bulk up”increase their chances of developing heart disease . Joene Hendry of Reuters reports:
 &quot;Our work demonstrates a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, an established cardiovascular risk factor, among retired National Football League (NFL) linemen,&quot;said Dr. Marc A. Miller, of Mount Sinai Medical Center, in New York. Football linemen are position players commonly of large body size.

A clustering of heart disease and diabetes risk factors including high blood pressure, low levels of &apos;good&apos; cholesterol, high levels of blood lipids (fats), and elevated blood sugar and body weight make up the metabolic syndrome.

When Miller and colleagues compared metabolic syndrome rates among 510 retired NFL players, they found that nearly 60 percent of linemen had metabolic syndrome, compared with 30 percent of those playing other positions.

Moreover, greater than 85 percent of the linemen were obese, as opposed to half of the non-linemen, the researchers report in The American Journal of Cardiology.

 Lower Cholesterol, Lower Prostate Cancer-Risk 
 Posted on May 22, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Here’s more prostate cancer news. A new study has determined that men who lower their cholesterol cut their risk of prostate cancer . Steven Reinberg of HealthDay News reports:
 &quot;Prostate cancer is controlled by the male hormone testosterone. The main molecule that forms testosterone is cholesterol,&quot;said Dr. Murugesan Manoharan, an associate professor of urology at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study.&quot;So it is known that prostate cancer is related to testosterone, and testosterone is related to cholesterol.&quot;

The study&apos;s inference is that by lowering cholesterol, you also lower PSA, which in turn may reduce the risk of prostate cancer, Manoharan said.&quot;Obviously this is a very small study and does not confirm anything, but it is a very good start that could lead to something more at a later point,&quot;he said.

The results of the study were expected to be presented Wednesday at the American Urological Association annual meeting, in Orlando, Fla.

For the study, researchers collected data on 1,214 men taking cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. The researchers found that PSA levels were lower after starting the statins, and the drop in PSA was proportional to the drop in cholesterol.
 Too bad the study used statins to lower cholesterol—stupid. Instead, try this: Lower Your Cholesterol Naturally .

 Heart Health: Aspirin a Miracle? 
 Posted on May 15, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese “With very few exceptions, nobody is predestined to have a heart attack. Heart disease is easily preventable, but not by taking aspirin,”explains Dr. Fuhrman, but a new study links taking aspirin with lower blood pressure . Ed Edelson of HealthDay News reports:
 The new report is the first study to show the drug&apos;s benefit -- although only when taken at night -- with prehypertension, defined as blood pressure just below the 140/90 level. Prehypertension is a known warning sign of future risk of heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular problems.

Why aspirin should do its good work for blood pressure at night but not in the daytime is not clear, Hermida said. Research indicates that it can slow the production of hormones and other substances in the body that cause clotting, many of which are produced while the body is at rest.

The three-month study included 244 adults diagnosed with prehypertension. A third of them were advised to follow general rules of hygiene and diet designed to reduce blood pressure, another third were told to take a 100-milligram aspirin tablet every night at bedtime, and the final third were told to take the same aspirin dose on awakening.

Researchers monitored blood pressure levels at 20-minute intervals from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and at 30-minute intervals at night before the trial began and three months later.

Systolic blood pressure (the higher number in the 140/90 reading) dropped 5.4 points and diastolic pressure by 3.4 points for those taking aspirin before bedtime. No drop in blood pressure was found in those taking morning aspirin or following the general guidelines.
 Dr. Fuhrman doesn’t agree with all the mumbo-jumbo surrounding aspirin and heart health. He talks about it here:
 Five studies to date have examined the effects of daily or every-other-day aspirin use for primary prevention for periods of four to seven years.1 Most participants were men older than 50 years. Meta-analysis of the pooled data from all of the studies show that aspirin therapy reduced risk for coronary events by 28 percent, but with no decrease in mortality. In other words, aspirin use did not result in longer life. There was no reduction of death due to heart attack or stroke.


Based on this unimpressive data, and in spite of pooled data that shows for most adults, aspirin therapy causes more harm than good,2 most Americans take it for granted that taking an aspirin every day will prevent heart disease.

Advice on aspirin for prevention against heart attacks and stroke must be based on each individual’s cardiac risk. For those at very high risk, with known risk factors such as the conventional, high-saturated fat, low-nutrient diet, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and overweight, the benefits of aspirin may outweigh the risk. But for those of us who eat healthfully, exercise and don’t smoke, taking aspirin will increase our risk of cerebral hemorrhage and other bleeding complications.

For healthy people, the risks outweigh the benefits. That is why, in contrast to typical physician recommendations aimed at reducing risk, I recommend that people eliminate their risk factors. Daily aspirin consumption is for those satisfied with mediocrity and willing to gamble with their lives.
 I know a few people that take aspirin daily and all of them are overweight, out of shape, and take aspirin as a result of previous heart trouble. Seems like an ineffective easy way out to me.

 Have a Healthy Heart! 
 Posted on May 14, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese How do you keep your heart healthy? Well, for a long time Americans have turned to drugs. Has it worked ? Tara Parker-Pope of The New York Times investigates:
 While doctors still advise patients to diet, exercise and stop smoking, the medical community has adopted an almost singular focus on cholesterol-lowering drugs as the fastest and best way to battle heart disease. Americans spend $18 billion a year on cholesterol-reducing drugs, making them the nation’s biggest-selling class of drugs.

Clearly, drug treatments have played a role in the health of American hearts. Since 1950, age-adjusted death rates from cardiovascular disease have dropped 60 percent, a statistic praised by government health officials.

Average blood pressure and cholesterol levels are dropping, partly because of drug treatments. But drugs don’t get all the credit. A sharp drop in smoking has had a huge impact on heart health. And major changes in diet have also played a role. Surveys of the food supply suggest that consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol has decreased since the early 1900s. Medical care has also improved.

But an important lesson from the last 50 years is that when it comes to improving heart health, it is important to look beyond the medicine cabinet.

Just a few small changes—eating more fish, vegetables, nuts and fiber—can have a major impact on your risk for heart problems. For some people, drinking moderate amounts of wine may offer additional benefits. Even a 55-year-old man who is about 20 pounds overweight and does not exercise regularly will have a heart-disease risk far below average if he regularly consumes fish, nuts, fiber and vegetables and drinks moderate amounts of wine.
 Okay, it makes sense that drugs would make an impact, but, are they really the best option? Dr. Fuhrman has his doubts. He points out some the drawbacks of drugs:
 When resorting to medical intervention, rather than dietary modifications, other problems arise, reducing the potential reduction in mortality possible, as these individuals are at risk of serious side effects from the medication. The known side effects for various statins (the most popular and effective medications to lower cholesterol) include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.
 So, what’s the answer? America’s got it half right. You do need to change your diet, but for OPTIMAL health you’ve got to make a profound change—not just a few small changes. More from Dr. Fuhrman:
 When you drop body fat, your cholesterol lowers somewhat. But when you reduce animal protein intake and increase vegetable protein intake, your cholesterol lowers dramatically. In fact, when a high-fiber, high-nutrient, vegetable-heavy diet was tested in a scientific investigation, it was found to lower cholesterol even more than most cholesterol-lowering drugs.1


The cholesterol-lowering effects of vegetables and beans (high-protein foods) are without question. However, they contain an assortment of additional heart disease-fighting nutrients independent of their ability to lower cholesterol.2

In areas of the world where people eat a diet of unrefined plant foods, people have total cholesterol levels below 150, and there is zero incidence of heart disease in the population.3

The average cholesterol level in rural China, as documented in the massive China Cornell Project, was 127 mg/dl. Heart attacks were rare, and both cancer and heart disease rates plummeted as cholesterol levels fell, which reflected very low animal product consumption. The lowest occurrence of heart disease and cancer occurred in the group that consumed plant-based diets with less than two servings of animal products per week.
 I think most people approach health and nutrition too cavalierly. You need to be vigilant. It’s a fulltime job. You can’t go half-assed—know what I mean?

 Wednesday: Health Points 
 Posted on May 14, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 A new study claims air pollution raises the risk of deep vein thrombosis—blood clots . More from WebMD : 
 Harvard researcher Andrea Baccarelli, MD, PhD, and colleagues in Italy studied 870 people diagnosed with DVT from 1995 to 2005. They compared their particulate air pollution exposure in the year before their diagnosis to that of 1,210 matched people without DVT.

They found that DVT risk goes up 70% for every 10 microgram-per-cubic-meterrise in particulate air pollution above 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air (the lowest pollution level measured in the study).

The U.S. EPA standard for particulate air pollution is 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air. However, it&apos;s likely that fine and very fine particles cause most of the health risks linked to particulate air pollution.
 
 Surprise-surprise, drugs alone don’t lower heart disease risk for overweight Americans . Via HealthDay News : 
 The simple truth, experts say, is that pounds must also be shed to keep cardiovascular trouble away.


&quot;There is a debate out there about whether this generation is going to live as long as their parents, and the truth is they probably won&apos;t,&quot;said study author Dr. Gregory L. Burke, director of the division of public health sciences at Wake Forest University School of medicine in Winston-Salem, NC.

&quot;My ultimate worry is that we&apos;ve seen a 50-year decline in cardiovascular disease mortality, but if you begin to look at recent trends, it&apos;s beginning to plateau,&quot;he added.&quot;And my fear is that because of the increase in obesity we&apos;re going to begin to see a reversal of that trend where heart disease rates begin to go up.&quot;
 
 The tornados that blew through the Midwest are leaving toxic lead in their wake . The A ssociated Press reports: 
 On Saturday, a tornado with the second-strongest rating killed six people, destroyed a 20-block area, and blew dust off mountains of mining waste, or chat piles.


&quot;You can look at the chat piles and see that a lot of the material has blown off,&quot;said John Sparkman, head of the Picher housing authority.&quot;We went up on a chat pile an hour and a half after the tornado hit, and you could see dust blowing fine material all over the place from that vantage point.&quot;

Long-term exposure to lead dust poses a health risk, particularly to young children.
 
 Kevin McKeever of HealthDay News reports that hypertension and cholesterol are being associated with eye disease . Take a look: 
 The two conditions appear to increase one&apos;s risk for retinal vein occlusion, a condition that leads to vision loss. It results from one or more veins carrying blood from the eye to the heart becoming blocked and causing bleeding or fluid build-up, according to background information in the report published in the May issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.


The Irish study found that people with high blood pressure had more than 3.5 times the risk of developing retinal vein occlusion than those without it. People with high cholesterol levels had an approximately 2.5-fold higher risk of retinal vein occlusion.

The findings come from an analysis of 21 previously published studies involving 2,916 people with retinal vein occlusion and 28,646 people without the condition. It found that 63.6 percent of patients with retinal vein occlusion also had hypertension, compared with 36.2 percent of people without the eye condition. High cholesterol levels were more than twice as likely to be found in those with retinal vein occlusion as those without (35.1 percent vs. 16.7 percent).
 
 Fairbank Farms has recalled some of its ground beef products . EMaxHealth is on it: 
 Fairbank Farms is issuing a voluntary recall of selected ground beef products produced at its Ashville, N.Y., facility and sold through Price Chopper, Shaw&apos;s, BJ&apos;s, and Wilson Farms retail outlets and C&amp;S Wholesale distributor.


The affected product may contain small pieces of hard plastic. All recalled products have either a&quot;sell-by&quot;date of 05/13/08, 05/15/08, or a&quot;Julian date 124&quot;on the package&apos;s label.
 
 United States obesity rates continue to bloat at an alarming pace . Megan Rauscher of Reuters reports:
 
 New research shows&quot;alarming levels&quot;of obesity in most ethnic groups in the United States, principal investigator Dr. Gregory L. Burke, of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina told Reuters Health. The study also confirms the potentially deadly toll obesity exacts on the heart and blood vessels.


&quot;The obesity epidemic has the potential to reduce further gains in U.S. life expectancy, largely through an effect on cardiovascular disease mortality (death),&quot;Burke and colleagues warn in the latest issue of Archives of Internal Medicine.

Among 6,814 middle-age or older adults participating in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, or&quot;MESA&quot;study, researchers found that more than two thirds of white, African American and Hispanic participants were overweight and one third to one half were obese.
 
 We know cigarettes are bad for your health, but cigarettes butts are bad for the environment . From the Better Planet Blog : 
 The question is loaded and points to a really interesting diagnosis: What IS the biggest environmental problem on the planet? The answer is subjective, of course. If you are talking about global warming then coal plants are the biggest problem on the planet. If you are talking about natural resource preservation then deforestation is the biggest problem. Insert water for life sustainability and disease, or plastics for waste. To be sure, cigarettes are no one’s friend: Neither health nor the environment. In fact, in terms of litter, they are the biggest source of it: More than two billion pounds of cigarette butts are discarded worldwide–more than two pounds for every person in China. I use that country as an example because as I traveled from Beijing southward along the Silk Route, people still smoked a lot–everywhere. In Southeast Asia too people light up.


Smokers’waste is rather easy to calculate. Figure out how many cigarettes are smoked and you’ll find out how many butts are tossed. You can’t recycle‘em. One thing I’d like to know is the emission factor, or pollution due to smoking.
 
 Thanks to Rae for finding this one. Research has determined that popular shampoos contain toxic chemicals . From NaturalNews : 
 The experiments were conducted with the brain cells of rats and they show that contact with this ingredient called methylisothiazoline, or MIT, causes neurological damage.


Which products contain this chemical compound MIT? Head and Shoulders, Suave, Clairol and Pantene Hair Conditioner all contain this ingredient. Researchers are concerned that exposure to this chemical by pregnant women could put their fetus at risk for abnormal brain development. In other people, exposure could also be a factor in the development of Alzheimer&apos;s disease and other nervous system disorders.

The chemical causes these effects by preventing communication between neurons. Essentially, it slows the networking of neurons, and since the nervous system and brain function on a system of neural networks, the slowing of this network will suppress and impair the normal function of the brain and nervous system.

 Living to 100 
 Posted on May 6, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Do you want to live forever? I do. I plan on sticking around for as long as possible and Dan Buettner of The Huffington Post has compiled a list of nine healthy habits that’ll help get you to 100 . Take a look:
 For the the last five years, I&apos;ve been taking teams of scientists to five pockets around the world where people live the longest, healthiest lives. We call these places the Blue Zones. We found a Bronze-age mountain culture in Sardinia, Italy, that has 20 times as many 100-year-olds as the U.S. does, proportionally. In Okinawa, Japan, we found people with the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. In the Blue Zones (Sardinia, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; Loma Linda, Calif.; and the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica), people live 10 years longer, experience a sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease and a fifth the rate of major cancers.

 Move naturally: Be active without thinking about it. Identify activities you enjoy and make them a part of your day. Cut calories by 20 percent. Cut calories by 20 percent: Practice&quot;Hara hachi bi,&quot;the Okinawan reminder to stop eating once their stomachs are 80 percent full. Plant-based diet: No, you don&apos;t need to become a vegetarian, but do bump up your intake of fruits and veggies. Drink red wine: In moderation. Plan de Vida: Determine your life purpose. Why do you get up in the morning? Down shift: Take time to relieve stress. You may have to literally schedule it into your day, but relaxation is key. Belong/participate in a spiritual community. Put loved ones first/make family a priority. Pick the right tribe: The people surrounding you influence your health more than almost any other factor. 
 These are fantastic suggestions. Be active, eat plants, and relax—perfect! You won’t get much argument out of Dr. Fuhrman:
 Increasing the consumption of vegetables, legumes, fruits, and raw nuts and seeds (and greatly decreasing the consumption of animal products) offers profound increased longevity potential, due in large part to broad symphony of life-extending phytochemical nutrients that a vegetable-based diet contains…

…Centenarian studies in Europe illustrate that those individuals living into their hundreds were likely to have consumed a plant-based diet consisting of fewer than 2000 calories per day. Multiple studies have confirmed that the thinnest people live the longest…

…As we condition our muscles and gain strength, our bones thicken and strengthen along with the muscle. Without regular exercise along the way, your bone structure can deteriorate as you get older. Some people survive with weak bones, but their quality of life suffers when they are immobilized by arthritis and osteoporosis…

…A safe and satisfying work environment, a happy marriage, a satisfying social and/or family life, and activities you enjoy are all related to positive health outcomes. Emotional wellness starts right here your finger tips end. As you respect and appreciate the value in the world around you and develop interests in other people and in such things as art, music, entertainment, sports, nature, and physical activity, you can respect yourself more for your ability and desire to appreciate the value of things not yourself.
 Okinawans are fascinating people. These avid plant-eaters live a long-long time. In fact, they made John Robbins’s list of longest-lived people in his book Healthy at 100 . Check it out: 
 
 Abkhasia: Ancients of the Caucasus, where people are healthier at ninety than most of us are at middle age. Vilcabamba: The Valley of Eternal Youth, where heart disease and dementia do not exist. Hunza: A People Who Dance in Their Nineties, where cancer, diabetes, and asthma are unknown. The Centenarians of Okinawa: Where more people live to 100 than anywhere else in the world. 
Now, for the flipside, primitive people like Inuit Greenlanders and Kenyan Maasai have short life expectancies —why? Too much meat in their diets. More from Dr. Fuhrman:

 Inuit Greenlanders, who historically have had limited access to fruits and vegetables, have the worst longevity statistics in North America. Research from the past and present shows that they die on the average about 10 years younger and have a higher rate of cancer than the overall Canadian population.1


Similar statistics are available for the high meat-consuming Maasai in Kenya. They eat a diet high in wild hunted meats and have the worst life expectancy in the modern world. Life expectancy is 45 years for women and 42 years for men. African researchers report that, historically, Maasai rarely lived beyond age 60. Adult mortality figures on the Kenyan Maasai show that they have a 50% chance of dying before the age of 59.2
 I guess the same can be said about us; between all the fast food, beef jerky, potato chips, cheese pizza, and no exercise, Americans start dying at middle-age. We’d learn a lot from our foreign neighbors.

 Health Points: Wednesday 
 Posted on April 30, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 A new study challenges the“fit but fat”theory . Lindsey Tanner of the Associated Press reports: 
 The new study involving nearly 39,000 women helps sort out the combined effects of physical activity and body mass on women&apos;s chances of developing heart disease, said Gulati, who wasn&apos;t involved in the research.

The study by Harvard-affiliated researchers appears in Monday&apos;s Archives of Internal Medicine.

Participants were women aged 54 on average who filled out a questionnaire at the study&apos;s start detailing their height, weight and amount of weekly physical activity in the past year, including walking, jogging, bicycling and swimming. They were then tracked for about 11 years. Overall 948 women developed heart disease.
 
 Nicholas Bakalar of The New York Times wonders if drinking lots of water is healthy . Take a look: 
 Numerous claims have been made about water—that it prevents headaches, removes dangerous“poisons,”improves the function of various organs and is associated with reduced risk for various diseases. But none of these is supported by scientific evidence. The authors were not even able to find a study leading to the“eight glasses a day”rule, whose origin remains unknown.


The researchers, in the June issue of The Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, say some studies have found evidence that drinking extra water helps the kidneys clear sodium, and long-term sodium retention might increase the risk of hypertension, but no clinical significance for the phenomenon has been established. Water also helps clear urea, but urea is not a toxin.
 
 Apparently, nap time is good for us . Dennis Drabelle of The Washington Post explains: 
 
 I never used to be a napper. In fact, daytime slumber was virtually beyond a congenitally wired type like me. My buddies would catch 40 winks on the long bus ride home from our high school, but for me that was out of the question. With age, however, my metabolism has changed. After the double whammy of a late-morning run and lunch, I&apos;m pretty much a goner. I lie down and nod off in much the same way that Marlene Dietrich fell in love in that old song of hers: because I can&apos;t help it.


While it lasted, though, my nap resistance put me in sync with the American way of sleep: Do it all at once and strictly at night. Traditionally, we&apos;ve begrudged ourselves naps. They may be forced on toddlers, recommended for pregnant women and tolerated among senior citizens with nothing better to do, but they&apos;ve been frowned upon for worker bees in their prime. Recently, however, sleep scientists have discovered advantages to napping, which they view not just as solace but also as something akin to brain food. No longer written off as a cop-out for the weak and the bored, the nap is coming into its own as an element of a healthy life.
 
 According to Jane E. Brody of The New York Times you name it and exercise can help it . Take a look: 
 If only the millions of others beset with chronic health problems recognized the inestimable value to their physical and emotional well-being of regular physical exercise.


“The single thing that comes close to a magic bullet, in terms of its strong and universal benefits, is exercise,”Frank Hu, epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, said in the Harvard Magazine.
 
 Pennsylvania is moving closer to a statewide ban on smoking . From The Pittsburgh Post Gazette : 
 A House-Senate conference committee claims it&apos;s getting closer to adopting a bill that would ban smoking in most Pennsylvania workplaces, but it can&apos;t seem to close the deal.


The deeply divided six-member committee had planned to meet today to vote on compromise legislation to prohibit people from lighting up in most workplaces and public places.

But late yesterday, the chairman called off the meeting, saying the bill still isn&apos;t ready despite months of negotiations.

Sen. Stewart Greenleaf, R-Montgomery, a staunch critic of smoking, said the delay should only be for&quot;a short period,&quot;meaning, probably, a few days.
 
 Health insurance premiums are shooting up, while income crawls . HealthDay News is on it: 
 According to an analysis of government statistics being released Tuesday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the average dollar amount employees must pay per year for family health coverage went up by 30 percent from 2001 to 2005. During that time, incomes increased by just 3 percent.


&quot;Nationally, insurance premium costs are going up ten times faster than people&apos;s incomes,&quot;said RWJF spokesman Michael Berman.&quot;And in some regions, the gap is even greater. So what we&apos;ve tried to do with this report is highlight for the nation&apos;s leaders what families already know; that it&apos;s getting harder and harder to afford health insurance in America.&quot;
 
 New York City will soon become more bicycle-friendly . TreeHugger passes it on: 
 Perhaps because Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s plan for congestion pricing in New York City has failed, the Big Apple is now trying to make up for it by becoming more bicycle-friendly. As it is, 112,000 New Yorkers bicycle on an average day, an increase of 10% over the last decade. The proposal, which is part of a new Department of Transportation strategic plan, hopes to double that number by 2015, as well as

 Add 200 miles worth of new bicycle lane between 2007 and 2009 Install 37 bicycle shelters and 5,000 bike parking racks by 2011 Install 15 additional miles of protected on-street bike lanes by 2010 and 30 miles from 2011 to 2015 
 
 The FDA has rejected Merck’s new cholesterol drug . Bill Berkrot of Reuters reports: 
 The company declined to discuss details in the so-called not approvable letter from the Food and Drug Administration. It would not comment on whether the agency had asked for further data or new clinical trials.


The drug, which was expected to be called Cordaptive, combines long-acting niacin with a new drug that prevents the flushing side effect common to niacin -- an uncomfortable sensation of burning in the face and neck that leads many patients to discontinue taking it.

Analysts widely expected the drug to be approved, especially after a committee of European regulators last week recommended it be cleared for sale there.
 
 Honda has invented a“walking assist device.” Big ups to Elijah for finding this one: 
 It&apos;s far from the only strength-boosting exoskeleton out there, but Honda&apos;s so-called&quot;walking assist device&quot;is one of the few that you can actually take for a test spin -- if you happen to be attending the Barrier Free 2008 trade show in Osaka, Japan next week, that is. Apparently employing some of the same technology developed by Honda for its ASIMO robot, the walking assistant is able to obtain information from hip angle sensors to help keep its wearer upright, with the device&apos;s motors also able to increase the wearer&apos;s natural stride. That, Honda says, should make the device ideal for the elderly or those with weakened leg muscles, although we&apos;re sure they could find at least a few other buyers if it ever actually hits the market at a reasonable price.
 
 Jacki Donaldson of That’s Fit passes along 10 quick cures for stress . Check them out: 
 What follows are 10 of the tips for sabotaging the stress in your life, every one somehow related to nutrition and fitness.

 Eat a healthy breakfast Eat more fiber Eat oatmeal Eat almonds Drink black tea Hydrate Stretch Exercise Do yoga Sleep 
 
 Mike Howard of Diet Blog has got broccoli’s back . Take a look: 
 Broccoli also contains the phytonutrients sulforaphane, indoles, kaempferol and isothiocyanates (they&apos;ll be a test later). These difficult-to-pronounce compounds have significant anti-cancer and other health effects. Here&apos;s what the literature says about it:

 Men who ate more than a serving of either broccoli or cauliflower each week almost halved their risk of developing advanced-stage prostate cancer Broccoli appear to have a unique ability to eliminate Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) - a bacteria responsible for ulcers. It has even been shown to eliminate Helicobacter when resistant to antibiotics. Crucifers, including broccoli provide significant cardiovascular benefit. Those who diets most frequently included broccoli, tea, onions, and apples-the richest sources of flavonoids-gained a 20% reduction in their risk of heart disease. 
 
 The Government Accountability Office claims the White House undermines the EPA . More the Associated Press: 
 The administration&apos;s decision to give the Defense Department and other agencies an early role in the process adds to years of delay in acting on harmful chemicals and jeopardizes the program&apos;s credibility, the Government Accountability Office concluded.


At issue is the EPA&apos;s screening of chemicals used in everything from household products to rocket fuel to determine if they pose serious risk of cancer or other illnesses.

A new review process begun by the White House in 2004 is adding more speed bumps for EPA scientists, the GAO said in its report, which will be the subject of a Senate Environment Committee hearing Tuesday. A formal policy effectively doubling the number of steps was adopted two weeks ago. Tags: Cholesterol , Exercise , Healthy Food , Hurtful Food , Research , Toxins

 The DASH Diet is Good... 
 Posted on April 16, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Okay, I go to admit. I couldn’t remember what the DASH diet is, so, I ran it through Wikipedia and here’s what came up :
 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension or the DASH diet is a diet promoted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (part of the NIH, an organisation part of the government of the USA) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium, and it also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also&quot;rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein and fiber.&quot;


The DASH diet is based on NIH studies that examined three dietary plans and their results. None of the plans were vegetarian, but the DASH plan incorporated more fruits and vegetables, low fat or nonfat dairy, beans, and nuts than the others studied. Not only does the plan emphasize good eating habits, but also suggests healthy alternatives to&quot;junk food&quot;and discourages the consumption of processed foods.
 Doesn’t sound too bad—pretty Fuhrman-friendly—maybe that’s why the DASH diet has been shown to cute the risk of heart disease . Ed Edelson of HealthDay News reports:
 The DASH -- Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension -- study, reported in the same issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, is the first to look at the diet&apos;s effect on the incidence of heart disease and stroke, said study author Teresa T. Fung, an associate professor of nutrition at the Simmons College School for Health Studies in Boston.


&quot;Previously, the benefits that were reported were for hypertension [high blood pressure],&quot;Fung said.&quot;No previous study looked at cardiovascular endpoints such as heart disease and stroke.&quot;

The study reported on 88,517 female nurses aged 34 to 59 who started with no evidence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes in 1980. In the 24 years that followed, the one-fifth of women in the group whose diets were most similar to that recommended in DASH -- low in animal protein, moderate in low-fat dairy products and high in plant proteins -- were 24 percent less likely to develop coronary heart disease and 18 percent less likely to have a stroke than the one-fifth of women with the lowest DASH scores.

While the study was not the kind of carefully controlled trial that gets the highest regard in research, it carries a message, Fung said.&quot;This report actually shows that those people whose diet resembles the DASH diet reduce the risk of actual cardiovascular disease,&quot;she said.
 Now, I’m certainly not going to abandon my nutritarian lifestyle for the DASH, but, the benefits of cutting salt, limiting saturated fat, and eating lots of fruits and veggies are truly undeniable. From Dr. Fuhrman’s book Eat for Health :
 As the consumption of animal products, saturated fat, and processed foods drops down to low levels in a population’s diet, heart disease goes to lower and lower levels, reaching less than one percent of the total cause of death. Eating a diet lower in saturated fat and higher in fruits and vegetables dramatically reduces the occurrence of the clots that cause heart disease and embolic strokes. However, hemorrhagic strokes are not caused by atherosclerosis—the buildup of fatty substances in arteries—and the resultant clots. These strokes are caused by a hemorrhage or rupture in a blood vessel wall that has been weakened by years of elevated blood pressure as a result of chronic high salt intake. The weakened wall ruptures and lets blood flow into and damage brain tissue…


…When a diet is high in fatty animal products and high in salt, the thickened blood vessel walls caused by the unhealthful, heart-attack-promoting diet actually protect against the occurrence of this more uncommon cause of strokes. In medical studies, higher cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of other strokes…

…A recent study looked at the effects of a diet with more fruits and vegetables combined with a low saturated fat intake. It showed a 76 percent reduction in heart-disease-related deaths for those consuming more than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day and less than 12 percent of calories from saturated fat, compared to those with less vegetation and more saturated fat.1 Even this small increase in vegetation and mild reduction in saturated fats showed a dramatic reduction in heart-disease-related deaths.
 I’ll think of the DASH as just that, a short little burst of health, but eating a vegetable-based nutrient-dense diet—THAT’S FOR THE LONG HAUL!

 Atherosclerosis and High Blood Pressure: Organ Trouble 
 Posted on April 14, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese It seems plaque build up in the arteries not only harms the heart, but other organs too . Theresa Waldron of HealthDay News reports:
 &quot;Atherosclerosis is usually associated with plaque formation in arteries,&quot;said study author Rita K. Upmacis, an associate research professor in pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York City.&quot;But using a mouse model of atherosclerosis, we have demonstrated that the effects of this disease are more widespread, affecting . . . the heart, liver and lungs.&quot;


The finding, scheduled to be presented this week at the American Chemical Society annual meeting, in New Orleans, centers around the availability of nitric oxide (NO), an important gas within the body that relaxes blood vessel walls and helps prevent atherosclerosis. Certain substances in plaque remove NO and create a toxic substance known as peroxynitrite, which hampers the function of enzymes necessary to the health of blood vessel walls.
 And high blood pressure isn’t exactly doing your brain any favors either . More from Will Boggs, MD of Reuters :
 High blood pressure is associated with worse brain function than normal blood pressure in people aged 60 and older, according to a report by doctors at Howard University Hospital in Washington, DC.


&quot;Optimal control of blood pressure may be beneficial in attenuating the risk of cognitive decline as the population ages,&quot;they conclude.

Dr. Thomas Olabode Obisesan and associates used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to investigate whether abnormal blood pressure is independently associated with lower cognitive function in men and women between 60 and 74 years old at study entry.
 I’m not doctor, but, I think the solution is clear. Try eating a diet that prevents both heart disease and high blood pressure. Dr. Fuhrman explains:
 When you eat to maximize micronutrients in relation to calories, your body functions will normalize; chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol melt away; and you maintain your youthful vigor into old age. Heart disease and cancer would fade away and become exceedingly rare if people adopted a lifestyle of nutritional excellence. But in the here and now, what is exciting to so many people is that when your diet is high enough in micronutrients, excess weight drops off at a relatively fast rate. It’s like you had your stomach stapled. You simply don’t crave to overeat anymore. In fact, it becomes too difficult to overeat when you eat your fill of high-micronutrient food.
 And hey, just think about how GREAT you’ll feel!

 Vytorin Bad, Statins Good? 
 Posted on April 1, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Vytorin is a bust, so, doctors are urging people“to turn back to statins.” Yeah, great idea! More from the Associated Press :
 Millions of Americans already take the drug or one of its components, Zetia. But doctors were stunned to learn Vytorin failed to improve heart disease, even though it worked as intended to reduce three key risk factors.


&quot;People need to turn back to statins,&quot;said Yale University cardiologist Dr. Harlan Krumholz, referring to Lipitor, Crestor and other widely used brands.&quot;We know that statins are good drugs. We know that they reduce risks…&quot;

…The study tested whether Vytorin was better than Zocor alone at limiting plaque buildup in the arteries of 720 people with super high cholesterol because of a gene disorder.

The results show the drug had&quot;no result. In no subgroup, in no segment, was there any added benefit&quot;for reducing plaque, said Dr. John Kastelein, the Dutch scientist who led the study.
 Why are we so caught up with statins? It’s not like statins are some miracle. They’ve got loads of problems. Dr. Fuhrman explains:
 The known side effects for various statins (the most popular and effective medications to lower cholesterol) include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.
 Alright damn it! Let’s talk side effects. Here are the know side effects of eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. More from Dr. Fuhrman:
 The cholesterol-lowering effects of vegetables and beans (high-protein foods) are without question. However, they contain an assortment of additional heart disease-fighting nutrients independent of their ability to lower cholesterol.1 They fight cancer, too. Cancer incidence worldwide has an inverse relation with fruit and vegetable intake.2 If you increase your intake 80%, the risk of getting cancer drops 80%.
 Now here’s a novel idea. Put down the cheeseburger, toss the statins out the window, and go for a jog—sheesh!

 MSN Health: Bad Foods for Cholesterol 
 Posted on March 31, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese “Saturated fat is the element of the modern diet that shows the most powerful association with high cholesterol and premature death from heart attacks,”explains Dr. Fuhrman. And, MSN offers up 5 Foods That Feed Cholesterol :
 
 
 Whole-milk Dairy Products: Saturated fat, which clogs arteries and increases LDL levels, is the No. 1 cholesterol-boosting culprit.

 
 
 Processed Meats: Bacon, sausage, liverwurst and the like are also wonderful sources of artery-clogging saturated fat.

 
 
 Fast-Food Fries: The main source of trans fats are partially hydrogenated oils, and that’s exactly what most fast-food restaurants are still using to cook their fries.

 
 
 Tropical Oils: Palm kernel and coconut oils are two of the fattiest of oils—100 percent of the bad-for-you saturated variety.

 
 
 Baked Goods: All baked goods—even those that are homemade—are high in saturated fats, thanks to the butter and shortening.
 No doubt, these are terrible foods. Here’s a montage of Dr. Fuhrman railing against them. Take a look:
 Milk/Dairy Fat 
Besides the link between high-saturated-fat foods (dairy fat) and cancer, there is a body of scientific literature linking the consumption of cow&apos;s milk to many other diseases.


 Bacon/Animal Fat 
Today the link between animal products and many different diseases is as strongly supporting in the scientific literature as the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.

 Fried Food 
Never eat browned or overly cooked food. Burnt food forms harmful compounds. If by accident something is overcooked and browned, discard it. Avoid fried food and food sautéed in oil.

 Cooking Oil 
While hydrogenation does not make the fat completely saturated, it creates trans fatty acids, which act like saturated fats. Evidence is accumulating to implicate the harmful nature of these man-made fats in both cancer and heart disease.

 Baked Goods 
Baked goods, cold breakfast cereals, pretzels, and other snack foods, we are getting heart-disease-promoting trans fats and a high dose of acrylamides. Acrylamides are toxic, cancer-promoting compounds produced when foods are baked or fried at high temperatures.
 Yeah, I think MSN is right on target with this list—don’t you agree?

 Food Scoring Guide: Silent, Invisible Damage 
 Posted on March 17, 2008 by Joel Fuhrman We continually are being told that heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even dementia are inevitable consequences of aging. So it is not surprising that most people assume that we have to expect these things as they are. We also are told that they are primarily the result of genetics and, therefore are beyond our control. The statistics seemingly bear this out. Over 90% percent of elderly Americans require medications for high blood pressure or other heart conditions. But these diseases are not the consequence of aging; they are the consequence of consuming a low-nutrient diet over time.

We don’t see the harm as we hurt our bodies in tiny increments, day after day, by eating a low-nutrient diet. Children, teenagers, and young adults“seem”to get away with years of poor nutrition. But after enough time goes by, the damage is easily seen. Then, we blame it on aging.

 Food Scoring Guide: Key to Superior Health and Your Ideal Weight 
 Posted on March 14, 2008 by Joel Fuhrman When you eat to maximize micronutrients in relation to calories, your body functions will normalize; chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol melt away; and you maintain your youthful vigor into old age. Heart disease and cancer would fade away and become exceedingly rare if people adopted a lifestyle of nutritional excellence. But in the here and now, what is exciting to so many people is that when your diet is high enough in micronutrients, excess weight drops off at a relatively fast rate. It’s like you had your stomach stapled. You simply don’t crave to overeat anymore. In fact, it becomes too difficult to overeat when you eat your fill of high-micronutrient food.

The mistake of focusing on the“importance”of protein in the diet is one of the major reasons Americans have been led down the path to dietary suicide. For too long, we have equated protein with good nutrition and have thought that animal—products in spite of the fact that they are deficient or devoid of most micronutrients—are highly favorable foods simply because they are rich in complete proteins. This miscalculation has cost us dearly. By favoring a dairy- and meat-heavy diet, instead of one rich in fruits, vegetables, and beans, we have brought forth an epidemic of heart attacks and cancers.

 Five Cholesterol-Fighting Foods 
 Posted on March 4, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese MSN offers up a list of foods that fight cholesterol . I liked these three. Check them out:
 
 Oatmeal: You’ve seen the commercials with people proclaiming dramatic drops in their cholesterol numbers thanks to a daily serving of this hot cereal. Those great results are due to the high levels of soluble fiber found in oatmeal.

 
 Almonds: Studies have found that eating just a quarter cup of almonds a day can lower your LDL by 4.4 percent, according to dietitian Leslie Bonci, who is also the director of sports nutrition at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.“Eating nuts, especially almonds, which are high in good-for-you monounsaturated fat, is better than simply eating a low-fat snack like pretzels,”says Bonci.

 
 Soy: Soybeans, soy nuts and edamame, plus any products made from soy (like tofu, soymilk, etc.) can help to reduce the production of new cholesterol.
 HealthandMen rounds out the rest of the list . Take a look:
 Fish: Another no brainer. Omega 3 fatty acids.


 Red Wine: Red wine contains Flavanols which have anti-inflammatory properties that help to lower cholesterol and fight heart disease. Once again, moderation.
 I’m a little leery of these two. Here’s what Dr. Fuhrman has to say about fish:
 Choose fish over other animal products, but be aware that the place where it was caught, and the type of fish, matters. Don&apos;t accept recreational fish from questionable waters. Farmed fish is safer. Never eat high-mercury-content fish. Don&apos;t eat fish more than twice a week, and if you have a family history of hemorrhagic stroke, limit it further to only once a month.
 And now, Dr. Fuhrman talks about wine:
 A few years ago the University of California’s Berkeley Wellness Letter reported on new research about the so-called heart-healthy“benefits”of alcohol consumption. Previous studies had led to a recommendation that moderate consumption of red wine—but not other alcoholic beverages—helped reduce the risk of heart attack. What did the new research reveal?


If we were to rely on the Berkeley Wellness Letter for this information, the latest news would be that moderate consumption of any alcoholic beverage—red or white wine, even beer and spirits—can be heart-healthy. Unfortunately, their latest news is still woefully out-of-date. More recent studies show that even moderate alcohol consumption is linked to significantly increased incidence of atrial fibrillation,1 a condition that can lead to stroke, and to higher rates of breast cancer.2,3

Alcohol is not actually heart-healthy. It simply has anti-clotting effects, much like aspirin.
 I think MSN might want to revisit their list—got to look at the whole picture—you know?

 Plaque Rupturing Cholesterol 
 Posted on February 28, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Last October, Dr. Jung San Huang of the Saint Louis University School of Medicine determined that cholesterol contributes to atherosclerosis; i.e. artery plaque . Reuters was on it:
 Cholesterol is known to promote plaque build-up in blood vessels, which raises the risk of heart attack, and other cardiovascular problems. Now, new research suggests that cholesterol does this by reducing the activity of a chemical called transforming growth factor (TGF-beta).


&quot;The finding that cholesterol causes atherosclerosis (plaques) by attenuating TGF-beta responsiveness in...cells could lead to the development of novel and effective therapies for atherosclerosis,&quot;senior investigator Dr. Jung San Huang told Reuters Health.
 I know, not exactly new news, but important nonetheless. Now, get this. New research claims that total cholesterol is linked to the risk of plaque rupture . More from Reuters :
 In individuals without symptoms who have thickened walls of the carotid arteries, two major arteries located on each side of the neck that provide blood and oxygen to the brain, the total blood levels of cholesterol are strongly associated with the presence a lipid, or fat-based,&quot;core within plaque, which have a vulnerability to rupture, researchers report.


&quot;We know that a lipid core, made up of fatty dead tissue deposits, within an atherosclerotic plaque puts the plaque at risk for causing an adverse clinical event, such as a stroke if the plaque is in the carotid artery or a heart attack if the plaque is in the coronary artery,&quot;lead investigator Dr. Bruce A. Wasserman told Reuters Health.

To identify factors associated with a lipid core, Wasserman of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, and colleagues examined subjects taking part in a study of atherosclerosis, also referred to as hardening of the arteries. All of the subjects were free of cardiovascular disease and were among participants with the thickest carotid artery walls, as determined by ultrasound.
 Okay, here’s a no-brainer—lower cholesterol! Not sure how? Dr. Fuhrman offers up some advice for getting your cholesterol down. Check it out:
 A vegetable, fruit, nut, and bean-based diet has been shown to be the most effective cholesterol-lowering dietary approach in medical history. This newsworthy data with the potential to save millions of lives has been ignored by the mass media. With this dietary approach, most patients drop their total cholesterol below 150 and LDL below 100, without the need for medications. In areas of the world where people eat a diet of unrefined plant foods, people have total cholesterol levels below 150, and there is zero incidence of heart disease in the population1…


…The dietary program I recommend for heart-disease reversal utilizes natural cholesterol-lowering therapies instead of drugs, which eliminates the risks of drug side effects. And because my dietary program is richer in fiber and nutrients than the typical vegetarian diet, my patients achieve spectacular reductions in cholesterol, body weight, and blood pressure. Fortunately, this approach also can help those who already have heart disease. They can avoid future heart attacks and reverse and remove atherosclerosis.
 And trust me, not only is Dr. Fuhrman’s approach effective—it’s delicious! Oh, and for more on cholesterol, don’t forget about Wednesday’s post Low Cholesterol and Cancer-Risk .

 Low Cholesterol and Cancer-Risk 
 Posted on February 27, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese “Low cholesterol as a result of eating healthfully does NOT place one at higher risk of cancer,”exclaims Dr. Fuhrman in response to a recent Reuters report that low cholesterol has been linked to stomach cancer-risk . From the report:
 Some studies have linked low cholesterol levels to higher death rates from cancer in general, Dr. Kouichi Asano, of Kyushu University, Fukuoka, and colleagues explain in the International Journal of Cancer.&quot;With respect to gastric cancer, a limited number of studies suggest this inverse association, while others do not.&quot;


The researcher looked into this in a study involving some 2,600 residents of Hisayama, Japan, who were followed for 14 years.

Gastric cancers developed in 97 subjects. After accounting for age and gender, stomach cancer rates rose significantly with descending cholesterol level. For example, among subjects with the highest cholesterol levels, the gastric cancer rate was the equivalent of 2.1 cases per 1000 persons per year; among those with the lowest cholesterol, the rate was 3.9 per 1000 person-years.
 I talked to Dr. Fuhrman at length about this study and he thinks it’s a bunch of hooey. He goes on to explains why you shouldn’t worry about low cholesterol and cancer if you’re consuming a superior diet. Take a look:
 Low cholesterol levels around the world in healthy populations are linked lower rates of all cancers and that was confirmed in the China-Oxford-Cornell Study. That means if you eat a cardio-protective diet that earns you a low cholesterol level. That is indicative of a lower risk and protection against multiple cancers.


Cancer is a disease with a slow doubling time. It is in the body on the average of 8-12 years prior to diagnosis in the U.S. and 12-18 years prior to diagnosis in areas without modern screening and detection. Having cancer and having cancer even when it is not yet diagnosed lowers cholesterol levels. Having very low cholesterol, on a diet that you would expect to generate a high-cholesterol, is suspicious and it could potentially be a sign of an undiagnosed or early cancer.
 Take my cholesterol numbers for example:

 
I’m not worried about getting cancer from low cholesterol—are you?

 Super-Size that Organ Damage 
 Posted on February 26, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese If you ever see me eating fast-food, odds are I’ve got a gun pointed to my head. A quick burger and fries is a bad idea, and now, a new study has determined that fast food can stress the liver . ABC News reports:
 In a new study, 18 slim, healthy Swedish men and women took on a fast food diet, eating meals from popular chains twice a day for four weeks while refraining from exercise.


At the end of the experiment, blood tests showed evidence that the subjects eating fast food had liver damage. They also had gained an average of 16 pounds.

The subjects were eating&quot;an outrageously high amount&quot;of calories, said Keith-Thomas Ayoob, associate professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Ayoob said the calorie intake was almost double the average daily caloric intake of most Americans, which is about 2,700 calories.

Studies have shown that a diet high in fat and calories—the magic recipe for delicious, greasy fast food—puts people at greater risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes, both of which can lead to cardiovascular diseases and heart failure.
 How can a boardroom of fast-food executives live with themselves? I guess they just call the tobacco execs for support.

 Looking for a healthy heart? Sure you are! Get some cranberries then, because they’re being linked to good heart health . More from EMaxHealth : 
 A recent review of scientific research suggests cranberries may offer a natural defense against the development of this dangerous disease. Researchers feel that many of these results are due to the fact that cranberries contain a greater concentration of antioxidants than other commonly consumed fruit and that these nutrients may be working together to offer even greater benefits.

The report conducted at Tufts University, and published in Nutrition Reviews, found that cranberries offered a range of different benefits that work to promote cardiovascular health. These benefits include effects on cholesterol as well as on blood pressure and the development of blood clots, all established risk factors for heart disease.
 
 Smoking is not doing India any favors. It could kill 1 million people by 2010 . Muneeza Naqvi of the Associated Press reports: 
 One in five of all male deaths and one in 20 of all female deaths between the ages of 30 and 69 will be caused by smoking, said the study, conducted by a team of doctors and scientists from India, Canada and Britain and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.


&quot;The results we found surprised us, because smokers in India start later in life and smoke fewer cigarettes or &apos;bidis&apos; than those in Europe or America, but the risks are as extreme as in the West,&quot;said Prabhat Jha of the Center for Global Health Research at the University of Toronto, the lead author of the study.
 
 Surprise! Fast food isn’t good for you—or your liver. A new study claims eating a lot of fast food spikes liver enzymes . WebMD is on it: 
 On average, the students gained 14 pounds, added 2.6 inches to their waistline, and padded their body fat percentage by 3.7% during the study.


Blood samples provided by the students throughout the study show a spike in levels of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT). ALT levels rose quickly -- typically within a week -- after the students started the fast-food diet.
 
 I don’t eat tuna, but if you do. You might want to check out the“tuna calculator.” It helps you decide how much tuna to eat. See it at ParentDish : 
 Tuna is one of those annoying pregnancy foods that might be really, really good or really, really bad for the baby.


Instead of driving yourself crazy (like I did!) trying to guess the proper amount to ingest without putting increasing your mercury level to the point of now return, you can use the handy dandy Tuna Calculator that will give you a suggested weekly serving based on your weight.
 
 Cloned meat makes a lot of people nervous—myself included— one food producer is prohibiting cloned animal products . The Seattle Times reports: 
 PCC Natural Markets is prohibiting suppliers from using cloned animal products in their food. It also wants them to disclose where ingredients are from and what they mean by terms such as&quot;natural flavors.&quot;


These moves come months after the Seattle chain eliminated high-fructose corn syrup from its eight stores and began identifying the countries of origin for its meat, seafood, peanuts and fresh and frozen produce.
 
 Some people think red wine is a magic potion for your heart. Well, it turns out its no better than other alcohols . From the Dairy Reporter : 
 According to the research, red wine and alcohol consumption were found to have virtually identical impact on health, with one drink of either substance helping to reduce the work rate of the heart.


The findings, which are published in the February edition of the American Journal of Physiology, Heart and Circulatory Physiology, could challenge the perception that polyphenol content of red wine is responsible for cardiovascular benefits.

Red wine has been linked to extended survival rates of mice and prevented the negative effects of high-calorie diets, in other testing, due to the presence of the polyphenol, resveratrol.
 
 Sandi Doughton of The Seattle Times asks the question,“ Does our lack of sun put your health in danger? ”Here’s a bit: 
 &quot;You&apos;re in a dark, gloomy place,&quot;said Bruce Hollis, a leading vitamin D researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina.&quot;In the winter, you could stand outside naked for five hours and nothing is going to happen.&quot;


Increased use of sunscreen has turned a seasonal shortfall into a year-round condition for many people. A recent survey in Britain found 87 percent of adults tested during winter, and more than 60 percent in summer, had subpar vitamin D levels. Doctors in many parts of the world—including California—report a resurgence of childhood rickets, soft bones caused by lack of vitamin D.
 
 Look, cigarette companies up to no good—big surprise. It seems the“tobacco giants”are in cahoots . The AFP reports: 
 Tobacco giants Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco actively collude with cigarette smugglers to gain a foothold in lucrative developing markets, campaigners alleged on Wednesday.


&quot;Transnationals benefit in a number of ways from the illicit trade in tobacco,&quot;said Kathyrn Mulvey, director of international policy with the lobby group Corporate Accountability International (CAI).

 Food Scoring Guide: Weight Loss and Cholesterol 
 Posted on February 14, 2008 by Joel Fuhrman When you drop body fat, your cholesterol lowers somewhat. But when you reduce animal protein intake and increase vegetable protein intake, your cholesterol lowers dramatically. In fact, when a high-fiber, high-nutrient, vegetable-heavy diet was tested in a scientific investigation, it was found to lower cholesterol even more than most cholesterol-lowering drugs.1 As you eat more vegetables and fewer animal products, the nutrient density of your diet will go up automatically. Vegetables not only contain adequate protein, they have no saturated fat or cholesterol, and they are higher in nutrients per calorie than any other food. You can achieve your ideal weight and slow the aging process with a high phytochemical intake. So eat more vegetables!

The cholesterol-lowering effects of vegetables and beans (high-protein foods) are without question. However, they contain an assortment of additional heart disease-fighting nutrients independent of their ability to lower cholesterol.2 They fight cancer, too. Cancer incidence worldwide has an inverse relation with fruit and vegetable intake.3 If you increase your intake 80%, the risk of getting cancer drops 80%.

 Congress onto Jarvick-Lipitor Ad Deal 
 Posted on February 12, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Here’s more on the congressional investigation into Lipitor’s advertising campaign featuring Dr. Robert Jarvik ; pioneer of the artificial heart. Stephanie Saul of The New York Times reports:
 The demand for records was made in letters mailed Thursday to nine advertising firms thought to be involved in Dr. Jarvik’s advertising campaign for Lipitor, the cholesterol medication that is the world’s top-selling drug.


The letters from Representatives John D. Dingell and Bart Stupak, both Michigan Democrats, said the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its subcommittee on oversight and investigations were investigating“false and misleading statements and the use of celebrity endorsements of prescription medications in direct-to-consumer advertising.”

The committee released a copy of Dr. Jarvik’s contract with Lipitor’s maker, Pfizer, revealing that the company agreed to pay Dr. Jarvik, a pioneer in artificial hearts, a minimum of $1,350,000 over two years for serving as celebrity pitchman for Lipitor.
 For background on this whole Jarvick-Lipitor mess, check out Jarvik on the Hot Seat . It kicked up a good comment stream. Take a look:
 Paige: &quot;For many people like me, diet and exercise aren&apos;t enough.&quot;


 Me: Same here! The other commercials that REALLY annoy me are the Vytorin TV ads, the ones with the family and food. Makes me insane! Grrrrr!
 Speaking of Vytorin, Julie Upton, RD of Poked&amp;Prodded is less than impressed by Vytorin’s hard-to-swallow claims . Here’s a bit:
 You’ve probably heard about the study that says that the popular cholesterol-lowering drug, Vytorin, might not slow the progression of heart disease.


You probably also know the drug’s annoying ads that go“Cholesterol. It can come from…barbecued ribs and from your Grandma Barbie.…Cholesterol comes from two sources: food and family….”

Soon, however, you may stop seeing those ads, because Vytorin seems to be no better at preventing the buildup of arterial plaque than first-generation statin medications like Lipitor and Zocor or its less expensive generic, simvastatin. The results are making many nervous statin-takers wonder if their medication is actually reducing their odds of developing coronary artery disease.
 I often wonder. Who watches these commercials then runs out and asks their doctor to prescribe them—nuts!

 Here’s a good question, does diabetes cost the USA more than wars and disasters ? Take a look. Liz Szabo of USA Today reports: 
 Uncontrolled diabetes wreaks havoc on the body, often leading to kidney failure, blindness and death. A new study shows that the nation&apos;s unchecked diabetes epidemic exacts a heavy financial toll as well: $174 billion a year.

That&apos;s about as much as the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism combined. It&apos;s more than the $150 billion in damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.

The incidence of diabetes has ballooned—there are 1 million new cases a year—as more Americans become overweight or obese, according to the study, released Wednesday by the American Diabetes Association. The cost of diabetes—both in direct medical care and lost productivity—has swelled 32% since 2002, the report shows.

Diabetes killed more than 284,000 Americans last year, according to the diabetes association.
 
 Much to my personal delight, Yoga is growing in popularity. Katie Zezima of The New York Times investigates a boot camp for Yoga teachers . Check it out:
 
 In May 2006, Sue Jones started YogaHope, an organization that teaches yoga at eight Boston-area women’s homeless shelters, substance-abuse treatment programs and domestic-violence safe houses, as well as two programs in Seattle. The focus is on teaching restorative yoga, and though many teachers have completed at least 200 hours of training, it is not a requirement.


Driven by a sometimes missionary zeal and a sense that yoga has become an exclusive pursuit, a small but growing number of yoga practitioners are forming organizations that teach yoga in prisons and juvenile detention centers in Oakland, Calif.; Los Angeles, Seattle and Indianapolis. They are working with the addicted and the homeless in Portland, Ore., and with public-school students in New York City.

Though concern about the cost of yoga is an issue (studio classes can cost $20 for a drop-in session, though some offer free or low-cost classes taught by less experienced teachers), most of the practitioners are motived by a desire to introduce yoga to those who might need it most, but wouldn’t think to do it on their own.
 
 Okay gym nuts. Health and Men passes on some“ stop and go super sets ”for you to try next time you’re working out. Have a look: 
 Stop-and-go pushup 
Assume a pushup position. Brace your core and lower your chest to the floor. When you’re halfway down, pause 2 seconds before continuing. Then, when your chest is 2 inches from the floor, pause again for 2 seconds before pushing halfway back up. Hold for 2 more seconds, then straighten your arms. Do eight reps.


 Stop-and-go split squat 
Stand with one foot 3 feet forward and hold a barbell across your shoulders. Rise on the ball of your back foot, then bend at the knees. When halfway down, pause for 2 seconds. Pause again when your back knee is just off the floor. Push halfway up, pause again, and return to the starting position. Do six reps with each leg.
 
 Its seems the United Kingdom is all set to pony up millions for anti-obesity campaign . Tim Castle of Reuters is on it: 
 The campaign, to be launched in the summer, will form part of a wider strategy including aspects like food labelling, urban design and the promotion of exercise.


Department of Health officials said it will use simple messages -- such as the&quot;five pieces of fruit and veg a day&quot;slogan -- and be based on research into what actually works to make people change from unhealthy lifestyles.

&quot;Tackling obesity is the most significant public and personal health challenge facing our society,&quot;said Health Secretary Alan Johnson as he launched the 372 million pound cross-government strategy.
 
 Okay, this is a little weird—to say the least— evidently some people believe you can treat sleep apnea with a didgeridoo . From the CBS Early Show : 
 &quot;A didgeri-what?&quot;you ask. While aborigines in Australia have been playing this long wooden trumpet for centuries, it&apos;s just recently been redefined as a modern-day medical device. Researchers reporting in the British Medical Journal evaluated 25 people with sleep apnea--a breath-stealing condition caused by flabby throat muscles--and found that those who took 4 months of didgeridoo (DIH-jeh-ree-doo) lessons had about 31/2 times less daytime sleepiness than the folks who didn&apos;t blow their own horns. The newly minted musicians also snored significantly less. Credit this uncommon cure to vibrations that exercise tissue in the mouth and throat, says researcher Milo Puhan, Ph.D.&quot;When these muscles are strengthened, the tongue has less tendency to obstruct the airway.&quot;


If huffing on a wooden tube to treat your sleep apnea sounds a tad too weird, then you probably aren&apos;t familiar with the alternatives. The most commonly prescribed option is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which involves spending every night hooked up to a machine that pumps air down your throat to keep it from collapsing. The other approach is surgery, and that&apos;s only 30 to 60 percent effective. Now are you ready to toot the didgeridoo? You can pick up a beginner-friendly model for about $80 at L.A. Outback (laoutback.com). And don&apos;t worry; it&apos;s intuitive to learn, says co-owner Barry Martin. You purse your lips and blow into it with the beat.
 
 Diet Blog hardly has a glowing endorsement for“ Slim Coffee .”Jim Foster thinks it’s nothing but a big scam: 
 It must be so tempting for unscrupulous entrepreneurs:


Find an obscure weight loss product from somewhere overseas. Re-brand it. Hype it up. Create an infomercial. Make millions.

This time it&apos;s Slim Coffee. The claims are impressive:&quot;Reduce appetite. Clinically tested. Lose 5 pounds per week&quot;. All from drinking coffee with a few supplements added (or so they say).

The makers of Slim Coffee have been pursued by the FTC - resulting in a $923,000 settlement.
 
 A new study explains just how traffic pollution damages the heart . Here’s more from Andy Coghlan of the NewScientist , look: 
 Previous studies had suggested that people living in polluted areas are more at risk of heart disease. For example, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year showed that women in 36 American cities were more likely to develop heart disease if the air they breathed was rich in particles measuring 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter - known as PM2.5s - which are present in car exhaust fumes.


It now seems that a greater hazard may be posed by so-called&quot;ultrafine&quot;particles, about a dozen times smaller at 0.18 micrometres wide. The latest study in mice has shown that they clog up arteries with fatty atherosclerotic deposits, and chemically alter&quot;good&quot;cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, reducing its beneficial effects.
 
 Yippee! More Yoga news! The Los Angeles Times looks at one man’s effort to make Yoga a professional&apos;s sport . Janet Cromley reports: 
 How does yoga help a professional athlete&apos;s game? 
Yoga improves balance in the body and works the smaller muscles that normally wouldn&apos;t get worked. It also improves range of motion, whether that means swinging a golf club, throwing a baseball or shooting a basketball. It builds stamina through breath control and teaches techniques for relaxing in tense moments. Most important, yoga gives you confidence that your body will do what you want it to do when you need it to.

 Cholesterol: Well Blog Encounters a Loon 
 Posted on January 23, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese The shortcomings of cholesterol-lowering medications are all over the news lately, but rather then continue the beat down. Tara Parker-Pope of The New York Times Well Blog wants to know, is it possible to lower your cholesterol without drugs . Here’s a bit:
 In fact, many doctors think dietary changes are too difficult for most of their patients. While they typically encourage better eating and a diet low in saturated fat, they also prescribe cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins as a faster way to lower bad cholesterol.


But many people can’t tolerate statins and their side effects. Others simply don’t want to take a pill every day or shoulder the cost of a prescription. For those patients, dietary changes may be a better option.

In 2006, The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported on a study of 55 patients with high cholesterol who, over the course of a year, started eating a diet rich in soy proteins, fiber and almonds. All those foods may have cholesterol-lowering properties. Twenty-one patients managed to lower their cholesterol by 20 percent or more by the end of the year. The researchers noted that whether the patient was motivated and actually stuck with the diet most of the time was key.
 Kudos to Tara! There needs to be more talk about this, because as Dr. Fuhrman explains, dietary intervention is the best way to lower cholesterol and prevent and reverse heart disease. Check out this excerpt from Cholesterol Levels and Heart Attacks :
 Make no doubt about it: lowering your LDL cholesterol below 100 offers powerful protection against heart disease. The evidence is overwhelming today that heart attacks, which kill half of all Americans, are entirely preventable. Heart disease is a condition that is preventable and reversible through aggressive nutritional intervention and cholesterol-lowering.
 Now, in this post Dr. Fuhrman points to some specific foods that have well-documented cholesterol-lowering properties. I’ve clipped this snippet from Ideal Cholesterol 199? Have a look:
 A vegetable, fruit, nut, and bean-based diet has been shown to be the most effective cholesterol-lowering dietary approach in medical history. This newsworthy data with the potential to save millions of lives has been ignored by the mass media. With this dietary approach, most patients drop their total cholesterol below 150 and LDL below 100, without the need for medications. In areas of the world where people eat a diet of unrefined plant foods, people have total cholesterol levels below 150, and there is zero incidence of heart disease in the population.1
 Okay, one last excerpt. In this post Dr. Fuhrman points to the landmark China Study ; which illustrated the rarity of heart attacks in plant-food eating rural Chinese. From Can Cholesterol Be Too Low :
 Clearly, if we attempt to rival the low cholesterol of populations that eat mostly natural plant foods and do not have heart disease, we are always looking at total cholesterols below 150 mg/dl. The average cholesterol level in rural China, as documented in the massive China Cornell Project, was 127 mg/dl. Heart attacks were rare, and both cancer and heart disease rates plummeted as cholesterol levels fell, which reflected very low animal product consumption. The lowest occurrence of heart disease and cancer occurred in the group that consumed plant-based diets with less than two servings of animal products per week.
 Alright, now this is where I feel for Tara. In the comments of her post she encountered the persistent of lunacy of the low-carb consortium. Here’s the comment and Tara’s response from the Well Blog :
 Commenter: Alternatively, you and Jane Brody could look at the growing mountain of evidence that the diet you think is“healthful”is actually the problem…evidence which includes Brody’s own health!
 Or you could read the most important book on diet in the last century,“Good Calories, Bad Calories”by Gary Taubes.

But you won’t; you’ll keep passing out the same old misinformation.

Nor will you publish this comment.

 Tara: Of course I will publish your comment, and I think your point, if you strip away the personal attacks, is a good one. Nutrition writers like myself certainly have been complicit in confusing people’s notions about what constitutes healthful eating. (Although I’m curious about what I’ve written that offends you so.) I’m not sure I agree that Gary Taubes has written the most important book on diet (I’m a fan of Pollan as readers of this blog know). However, Mr. Taubes has certainly raised many important issues in his work. I agree, as Mr. Pollan writes, that the culture of nutritionism—viewing food as a sum of its nutrient parts—has been largely detrimental to the nation’s health.
 Tara, I feel for you. This nonsense and its lemming-like supporters pollute the information super highway. Before I go any further, here’s Dr. Fuhrman dropping the hammer on Gary Taubes’“most important book on diet in the last century.”From Nutrition Science and Gary Taubes :
 Amazing how stupid people are. Gary Taubes is a known Atkins&apos; devotee and nutritionally naïve and led by the Atkins&apos; crowd. Now he has his own book. All I can say is that this makes me look like a genius comparatively when I am only stating the obvious. All I can say is: Health = Nutrition / Calories .


Your health is predicted by your nutrient intake divided by your intake of calories. Health = Nutrition / Calories, or simply H = N/C, is a concept I call the nutrient-density of your diet. Food supplies us with both nutrients and calories (energy). All calories come from only three elements: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Nutrients are derived from non-caloric food factors—including vitamins, minerals, fibers, and phytochemicals. These non-caloric nutrients are vitally important for health. Your key to permanent weight loss is to eat predominantly those foods that have a high proportion of nutrients (non-caloric food factors) to calories (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins).
 I think Tara did a great job handling this over-zealous loon and luckily for her he wasn’t as radical as most of them. Just get a load of these vitriolic comments from one of DiseaseProof ’s low-carb blog-trolls. Oh! Despite the different names, it’s all the same person:
 RN: “STOP lying to people. NOW! Support your contention NOT SUMMARIES of summaries The blind leading the blind…I can and WILL argue this all day because I UNLIKE Dr. Fuhrman CAN back up my views.”


 Susan: “FUHRMAN FRAUD.”

 Razwell: “Persons who claim&quot;paradise health&quot;by following a certain diet are CHARLATANS.”
 What does all this prove? That no matter how much you back up your claims the crazies, the cultists, and the sensationalists will do their best to disrupt your day—just another day in the life of a health-blogger!

 More on Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs 
 Posted on January 23, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Last week we learned that many popular cholesterol-lowering drugs fail to deliver. Dr. Fuhrman is no fan of cholesterol medications. Take statins for example:
 When resorting to medical intervention, rather than dietary modifications, other problems arise, reducing the potential reduction in mortality possible, as these individuals are at risk of serious side effects from the medication. The known side effects for various statins (the most popular and effective medications to lower cholesterol) include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.
 Now, some doctors have come to the defense of popular medications. Tara Parker-Pope of The New York Times looks at What That Cholesterol Trial Didn’t Show . Here’s a bit:
 “I think this study is being interpreted wrong,”said Dr. Paul D. Thompson, director of cardiology at Hartford Hospital, who personally uses Zetia and (like most of the doctors quoted in this article) has consulted with makers of cholesterol drugs.


He pointed out that Vytorin users did experience a larger drop in cholesterol than the Zocor users. The disappointment was that the decline didn’t translate into a bigger benefit in arterial health.“It didn’t show harm,”Dr. Thompson said.“There were no more cardiac events, no more side effects. There was just no change.”

The fallout from the study was not limited to Vytorin. It has led to a whole new set of questions for scientists about cholesterol drugs. Is lowering LDL, the“bad”cholesterol, all that counts? Or must a drug also raise HDL, the“good”cholesterol, and fight inflammation?

Adding to the confusion, the Vytorin makers dragged their feet on releasing the results, issued the findings in a press release rather than a medical journal and made a lot of people mad.
 Okay, this makes me ask…Actually, I’ll shut up. Dr. Petrillo was very eager to drop the hammer on this report. Brace yourself, she’s shot out of a cannon! Check it out:
 Here&apos;s an idea. Stop gorging on cheeseburgers and you won&apos;t have to take Zocor or Zetia or Vytorin ! Drug reps love to promote these&quot;combo&quot;-type medications with the argument that you&apos;re getting two meds for the price of one and attacking the condition in two different ways. But with asparagus as your sword and broccoli as your shield, you will attack high cholesterol without putting expensive drugs with uncertain effects into your body.


According to this recent study, while Vytorin users saw a greater decrease in cholesterol than Zocor users, there was no difference in plaque formation in the coronary arteries between the two groups. Don&apos;t just prevent plaque formation! Reverse it by following a high-nutrient-density diet and exercising and you won&apos;t need to rely on pills! Cholesterol comes from animal products (even the ads for the cholesterol drugs acknowledge this), so, to avoid blockages in your coronary arteries, fewer animal products, more veggies, less pharmaceuticals, more exercise, less cow, more kale!
 “Asparagus as your sword and broccoli as your shield.”Perfect! Especially since I just saw the movie 300 —yes, I’m a little behind on the times—here’s the perfect amalgamation of phytonutrients and battle. Enjoy:

 
This is Sparta! Oops. I mean…these are Phytonutrients!

 Mevacor, The FDA, and Consumers 
 Posted on January 22, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese You remember the news about the over-the-counter statins right? A bizarre concept indeed! In case you need reminding, here’s some of the article from HealthDay News . Steven Reinberg reported:
 For the third time in seven years, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has been asked to recommend making Merck&amp;Co.&apos;s statin drug Mevacor available over the counter.


But with groups such as the American Medical Association, Public Citizen and Consumers Union lined up against it, experts think Merck&apos;s proposal is likely to be rejected once again when the panel meets on Thursday.

&quot;The third time is not the charm,&quot;said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.&quot;It&apos;s time to move on.&quot;

Merck&apos;s proposal is being presented to a joint meeting of the FDA&apos;s Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and its Endocrinology and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee. The FDA does not have to follow the advice of its advisory panels, but it usually does.
 Now, let’s ignore the fact that Dr. Fuhrman thinks taking statins are a bad idea . How would the average person know when to take these? I mean it’s not like popping a Tylenol! The FDA seems to agree...kind of; FDA Weighs Cholesterol Drug Mevacor . Here’s a bit:
 The government is questioning if too many of the wrong people will take cholesterol-lowering Mevacor if it&apos;s sold without a prescription, days before Merck&amp;Co. makes its third try to move the drug over the counter.


Merck says selling a low dose of this long-used medication on drugstore shelves, next to the aspirin, could get millions of people at moderate risk of heart disease important treatment that they otherwise may miss.

A preliminary Food and Drug Administration review released Tuesday agreed that nonprescription Mevacor would be&quot;a reasonably safe and effective&quot;option—if consumers used it as directed.

But when Merck tested if consumers could judge who was a proper Mevacor candidate, only 20 percent answered all the questions completely correctly—50 percent if researchers counted people who said they&apos;d check some things with their doctor before purchasing, concluded FDA&apos;s lead medical reviewer.
 What do you think?“If consumers used it as directed.”I’m not sure consumers can be trusted. How many people do you know who take handfuls of Tylenol every time they have a headache?

 ParentDish meets The China Study 
 Posted on January 15, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese T. Colin Campbell’s China Study is a big deal here at DiseaseProof . It’s really drives home the point that a vegetable-based nutrient-dense diet is the way to go. In this video Dr. Campbell talks all about it:

 
Now, if you’re a parent or aspiring to be one, I suggest you give ParentDish a look. It’s a great blog. In this post Kristin Darguzas talks about her recent discovery of The China Study . Here’s a blurb:
 I read the China Study. It&apos;s not written by an animal rights activist, nor by anyone who could be called insane by any stretch of the imagination. It&apos;s written by an extremely intelligent and respected nutritionist and researcher who presents his studies in a logical, methodical, terrifying way. And as I read the last page, I realized, oh no. I don&apos;t think I can eat dairy anymore. For me, this book is one of those soul-altering books that has changed the way I see the world, permanently.


Among some of the startling ideas in the book include the suggestion that the Dairy Industry&apos;s marketing board has been&quot;educating&quot;children with completely false information on the healthiness of cow&apos;s milk for decades, that animal meat causes cancer, that the knowledge (ie. a plant-based diet) is there to prevent heart disease but it&apos;s routinely ignored because...well, there is money to be made.

Dr. T. Colin Campbell suggests that he has the answers to America&apos;s obesity problem. I tend to believe him. My Dad says it&apos;s total hoey, there&apos;s a new fad every day... he&apos;d also refuse to read it. My Mom just read it and says she won&apos;t be eating meat again. )
 For more on The China Study , check out this interview with T. Colin Campbell over at Raw Vegan Radio . Here are a couple great quotes:
 “We’ve had inklings and pretty good evidence to show, for example, that consuming vegetables and fruits and grains could help to prevent heart disease. And then it came about that also in the more recent years it was shown also to be associated with prevention of cancer as well.”


“It turns out that plant-based diets not only help to prevent these major diseases, these chronic degenerative diseases like cancer and heart disease, but also consuming that kind of diet, low in fat, low in salt, low in sugar, consuming that kind of diet also can be used to keep under control diabetes, and it can be used to control obesity to a great extent if its done right. Certainly a lot safer way to keep bodyweight down than the really rather silly Atkins nonsense that crept into our vernacular over the last few years.”
 I love how the phrase“silly Atkins nonsense”just rolls off the tongue, but seriously, if you’re unfamiliar with The China Study , check it out. From The China Study website :
 If you’re looking to enhance your health, performance and your success read The China Study immediately. Finally, scientifically valid guidance on how much protein we need and where we should get it. The impact of these findings is enormous.

 Zetia...Failed 
 Posted on January 15, 2008 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese No surprise here. A recent clinical trial has determined that the cholesterol drug Zetia failed to show any medical benefits . Alex Berenson of The New York Times reports:
 The results will add to the growing concern over Zetia and Vytorin, a drug that combines Zetia with another cholesterol medicine in a single pill. About 70 percent of patients who take Zetia do so in the form of Vytorin, which combines Zetia with the cholesterol drug Zocor.


While Zetia lowers cholesterol by 15 to 20 percent in most patients, no trial has ever shown that it can reduce heart attacks and strokes—or even that it reduces the growth of the fatty plaques in arteries that can cause heart problems.

This trial was designed to show that Zetia could reduce the growth of those plaques. Instead, the plaques actually grew somewhat faster in patients taking Zetia along with Zocor than in those taking Zocor alone. Patients in the trial who took the combination of Zetia and Zocor were receiving it in the form of Vytorin pills.

Dr. Steven Nissen, the chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, said the results were“shocking.”Patients should not be prescribed Zetia unless all other cholesterol drugs have failed, he said.
 You guessed it! Dr. Fuhrman is no fan of taking needless magic pills. Here he talks about something all physicians should remember. Take a look:
 In the first pharmacology lecture that I head in medical school, the physician impressed on us that all drugs are toxic and we should never forget this. We were taught that medications work because of their pharmacologic properties—properties that enable the substance to interfere with, block, or stimulate an activity of the body. Drugs typically modify the way the body expresses the signs and symptoms of disease, but in chronic disease states, they do not undo the damage or remove the disease.
 I’m curious. How do drug-makers market around this debacle? That’s the real magic!

 Over-the-Counter Statins? 
 Posted on December 14, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese I guess the news about the “ideal cholesterol”level is fueling this fire. Merck really-really wants the FDA to approve the first-ever over-the-counter statin . Steven Reinberg of HealthDay News reports:
 For the third time in seven years, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has been asked to recommend making Merck&amp;Co.&apos;s statin drug Mevacor available over the counter.


But with groups such as the American Medical Association, Public Citizen and Consumers Union lined up against it, experts think Merck&apos;s proposal is likely to be rejected once again when the panel meets on Thursday.

&quot;The third time is not the charm,&quot;said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.&quot;It&apos;s time to move on.&quot;

Merck&apos;s proposal is being presented to a joint meeting of the FDA&apos;s Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and its Endocrinology and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee. The FDA does not have to follow the advice of its advisory panels, but it usually does.
 I mentioned it the other day, but it bears repeating. Dr. Fuhrman is no fan of statins, especially their side-effects. He points them out in his book Cholesterol Protection for Life , check it out:
 The known side effects for various statins include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.
 In general, Dr. Fuhrman feels doctors should not be too quick to prescribe medications for diseases and conditions that can be treated without. He explains why:
 In the first pharmacology lecture that I head in medical school, the physician impressed on us that all drugs are toxic and we should never forget this. We were taught that medications work because of their pharmacologic properties—properties that enable the substance to interfere with, block, or stimulate an activity of the body. Drugs typically modify the way the body expresses the signs and symptoms of disease, but in chronic disease states, they do no undo the damage or remove the disease.
 Unfortunately our society suffers from magic pill syndrome. So I doubt this will resonate.

 Ideal Cholesterol 199? 
 Posted on December 13, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Alright, I’m convinced. This nation has gone loony-tunes! First, New Jersey went off the deep end with mandatory flu injections , and now, a new government report insists that a total cholesterol level of 199 is ideal . What! Mike Stobbe of Associated Press reports:
 Results from a national blood test survey found the average total cholesterol level was 199. Doctors like patients to have total cholesterol readings of 200 or lower…


…The survey collects data in two-year intervals. The new results are based on a national sample of about 4,500 people 20 and older from 2005-06. The new 199 level compares with 204 in 1999-2000…

…Researchers also found that the percentage of adults with high cholesterol, of 240 or higher, dropped to 16 percent, down from 20 percent in the early 1990s.
 The report cites the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs as the main reason for the reduction. Yeah—because that’s a good! In case you forgot, Dr. Fuhrman is no fan of using medicine to lower cholesterol. Take statins for example:
 When resorting to medical intervention, rather than dietary modifications, other problems arise, reducing the potential reduction in mortality possible, as these individuals are at risk of serious side effects from the medication. The known side effects for various statins (the most popular and effective medications to lower cholesterol) include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.
 But what about this“ideal”cholesterol level, is a score of 199 really healthy? Okay, you decide. In Eat to Live Dr. Fuhrman discusses the cholesterol levels of populations consuming a plant-based diet. Here’s an excerpt:
 A vegetable, fruit, nut, and bean-based diet has been shown to be the most effective cholesterol-lowering dietary approach in medical history. This newsworthy data with the potential to save millions of lives has been ignored by the mass media. With this dietary approach, most patients drop their total cholesterol below 150 and LDL below 100, without the need for medications. In areas of the world where people eat a diet of unrefined plant foods, people have total cholesterol levels below 150, and there is zero incidence of heart disease in the population.1
 I guess if you’re consuming the standard American diet 199 is healthy—relatively speaking—it’s probably a miracle you’re surviving at all. Okay, let’s cut to the case. Here are the total cholesterols levels of people following Dr. Fuhrman’s nutrient-dense diet. Look:

 Me : 142 Brian : 106 Charlie : 169 Charlotte : 130 Claudia : 134 Joseph : 148 Mike : 136 
These are numbers worth bragging about! Dr. Fuhrman will tell you himself, flirting with a total cholesterol number around 200 is by no means ideal. In fact, Dr. Fuhrman explains the lower your cholesterol, the better! From Can Cholesterol Be Too Low :
 Typically, those individuals promoting the myth that low cholesterol levels are dangerous and the topsy-turvey&quot;science&quot;that saturated fat and high cholesterol are not bad, but good, are those individuals and health advisors advocating diets high in animal products, such as the Atkins devotees. Unfortunately, this advice is not merely incorrect; it is dead wrong for hundreds of individuals who heed such dangerous advice and die of heart attacks every day.


When it comes to coronary artery disease, there may be no such thing as lowering total blood cholesterol levels too far. Another recent study, published in the journal Circulation, found that the arteries in male patients with a total cholesterol level as low as 155 mg/dl benefited significantly from cholesterol-lowering medication as well.1 Both regression of atherosclerosis and a dramatic reduction in heart attacks were seen in the group treated.

While some research in the past has raised questions about the safety of very low cholesterol levels, no danger has been proven in larger, more dependable investigations.
 So, in the event that someone—so overjoyed by their 199 score—decides to streak gleefully naked down your street. Politely hand them a towel and a copy of Eat to Live .

 Fat Ballin&apos; 
 Posted on December 6, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese “Bulking up is dangerous to one&apos;s longevity,”Dr. Fuhrman replied when I asked him about the immense size of football players,“Linebackers often eat in a way that radically shortens their lives.”And it’s starting younger and younger. Check out this New York Times report :

 Two studies this year, one published in The Journal of the American Medical Association and another in The Journal of Pediatrics, found that weight problems among high school football players—especially linemen—far outpaced those of other male children and adolescents.


Now coaches and researchers fear that some young athletes may be endangering their health in an effort to reach massive proportions and attract the attention of college recruiters…

…Another study of 650 football players in Michigan youth leagues from ages 9 to 14, published last month in The Journal of Pediatrics, found that 45 percent were overweight or obese, with the problem more prevalent among linemen, who are typically the biggest players on the team.

“That’s staggering,”said Robert M. Malina, a professor emeritus of kinesiology at Texas and the lead author of the Michigan study.“Youngsters are already being rewarded for being big and overweight before playing big-time football.”
 It’s sad if you ask me, but, I don’t blame the kids. I blame the league. They must redirect the trend! Encourage teams to stress athleticism and speed and not motionless mountainous size. That’s why my favorite NFL players are guys like this:
 
 Terrell Owens 
Dallas Cowboys
Height: 6-3 Weight: 218 Age: 33
 
 
 Bob Sanders 
Indianapolis Colts
Height: 5-8 Weight: 206 Age: 26


 
 Torry Holt 
St. Louis Rams
Height: 6-0 Weight: 190 Age: 31

 
 Rodney Harrison 
New England Patriots
Height: 6-1 Weight: 220 Age: 34 These dudes are lean, quick, and agile. They’re not massive. They’re functionally or“deceptively strong.”That’s my fitness goal. Not to be Goliath, but rather, a fit and healthy David. Especially since, as Dr. Fuhrman points out, leaner people live longer. From Eat to Live :
 In the Nurses Health Study, researchers examined the association between body mass index and overall mortality and mortality from specific causes in more than 100,000 women. After limiting the analysis to nonsmokers, it was very clear that the longest-lived women were the leanest.1 The researchers concluded that the increasingly permissive U.S. weight guidelines are unjustified and potentially harmful…


…Dr. I-Min Lee, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said her twenty-seven-year study of 19,297 men found there was no such thing as being too thin. Among men who never smoked, the lowest mortality occurred in the lightest fifth.2 Those who were in the thinnest 20 percent in the early 1960s were two and a half times less likely to have died of cardiovascular disease by 1988 than those in the heaviest fifth. Overall, the thinnest were two–thirds more likely to be alive in 1988 than the heaviest. Lee stated,“We observed a direct relationship between body weight and mortality. By that I mean that the thinnest fifth of men experienced the lowest mortality, and mortality increased progressively with heavier and heavier weight.”
 Hopefully aspiring football players and the NFL awake up and put the health and longevity of athletes ahead of winning championships.

 Harmful, Harmful Cholesterol! 
 Posted on October 3, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese A new study shows us why cholesterol isn’t exactly health-promoting . David Douglas of Reuters is on it:
 Cholesterol is known to promote plaque build-up in blood vessels, which raises the risk of heart attack, and other cardiovascular problems. Now, new research suggests that cholesterol does this by reducing the activity of a chemical called transforming growth factor (TGF-beta).


&quot;The finding that cholesterol causes atherosclerosis (plaques) by attenuating TGF-beta responsiveness in...cells could lead to the development of novel and effective therapies for atherosclerosis,&quot;senior investigator Dr. Jung San Huang told Reuters Health.

Huang of Saint Louis University School of Medicine and colleagues note that TGF-beta performs a variety of beneficial anti-inflammatory and other functions and that this chemical is believed to protective against the development of atherosclerosis. The new findings appear in the Journal of Cell Science.

In a series of experiments, the researchers found that cholesterol weakened the response of TGF-beta in all cell types studied. Cholesterol also led to the rapid breakdown of the chemical.

 Saturated Fat: Watch It! 
 Posted on September 11, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Dr. Fuhrman is no fan of saturated fat. Just ask him. He’ll tell you firsthand. Saturated fat is bad news, and, the respected medical community agrees. From Lower Your Cholesterol Naturally :
 There are literally hundreds of respected scientific studies that demonstrate that as animal products increase in a population&apos;s diet, cholesterol levels soar and the occurrence of heart disease increases proportionally with the increase in animal product intake.1 Saturated fat is the element of the modern diet that shows the most powerful association in these medical research studies with high cholesterol and premature death from heart attacks.2
 Dr. Fuhrman also points out that saturated fats are a major contributor to cancer. He talks about it in Eat to Live , and, he lists the foods most packed with saturated fat. Take a look:
 Some naturally occurring fats are called saturated fats because all the carbon are single bonds. These fats are solid at room temperature and are generally recognized as a significant cause of both heart disease and cancer. Saturated fats are found mainly in meat, fowl, eggs, and dairy. Coconut and palm oil are largely saturated and are also not desirable. The foods with the most saturated fat are butter, cream, and cheese.
 Now, if all this isn’t daunting enough. New research claims that even a small splurge on saturated fat isn’t good for you —surprise-surprise. Kathleen Doheny of HealthDay News reports:
 A recent study by researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia found just that reaction after 14 trial participants, all healthy and between the ages of 18 and 40, ate just one piece of high-fat carrot cake and drank a milkshake.


That fat-laden feast compromised the ability of the participants&apos; arteries to expand to increased blood flow, the researchers found. The sudden boost in what&apos;s known as saturated fat hampered the effects of so-called&quot;good&quot;cholesterol, the high-density lipoprotein or HDL, from doing its job -- to protect the inner lining of the arteries from inflammatory agents that promote the build-up of fatty plaques. It&apos;s this plaque that, over time, clogs blood vessels and causes heart disease.

&quot;Saturated-fat meals might predispose to inflammation of, and plaque buildup in, the vessels,&quot;said study leader Dr. David Celermajer, Scandrett professor of cardiology at the Heart Research Institute and the Department of Cardiology at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.

Celermajer&apos;s team had the volunteers eat two meals, spaced one month apart. Each meal consisted of a slice of carrot cake and a milkshake. But, in one case the foods were made with saturated fat, and in the other case the meal was made with polyunsaturated safflower oil, a much healthier choice.
 Really makes you wonder how so many charlatans work up the gall to hock dangerous high-protein, high-saturated fat diets—shame on them! Dr. Fuhrman elaborates in the Short and Long-Term Dangers of High-Fat Diets :
 These high-proteins strongly forbid refined carbohydrates, junk food, and the nutritionally depleted white pasta, white rice, and bread that most Americans consume in large quantities. That is the good part. They also frequently recommend that the dieter consume hundreds of dollars of nutritional supplements each month, Sure, the supplements are better than nothing on such an unbalanced diet, but they do not make it safe…


…High-fat diets are unquestionably associated with obesity, and eating meat actually correlates with weight gain, not weight loss, unless you radically cut carbs from your diet to maintain chronic ketosis.1 Researchers from the American Cancer Society followed 79,236 individuals over ten years and found that those ate meat more than three times per week were much more likely to gain weight as the years went by than those who tended to avoid meat.2 The more vegetables the participants ate, the more resistant they were to weight gain.
 I guess as is the case with a lot of dietary woes, emotional attachments to food just keep sucking people in—boohoo, just put the burger down and get on with your life!

 Tuesday: Health Points 
 Posted on September 11, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Obesity may be ballooning up everywhere, but, not so much in Arkansas . Andrew DeMillo of the Associated Press reports: 
 Four years ago, Arkansas became the first state in the nation to track the number of overweight students in its schools. School officials say it has helped improve the state&apos;s childhood obesity rate.

A new report released Monday shows that while obesity is still a problem, the obesity rate in Arkansas&apos;s school children isn&apos;t rising.

State health officials said last year&apos;s mandatory BMI—body mass index—screenings showed that 20.6 percent of tested schoolchildren were overweight, while 17.2 percent were risk for being overweight, about the same figures as the previous year.
 
 Here’s a cool veggie slideshow Dr. Fuhrman sent over the other day. Check it out, it’s over at MSN : 
 
 Elena Conis of The Los Angeles times investigates the fear many parents of keeping plastics away from their infants . Take a look: 
 More and more consumers -- new mothers are leading the pack -- are expressing concern about potentially toxic chemicals in plastic products. Baby blogs are abuzz with warnings about chemicals in baby bottles and toys. Retailers say that demand for glass baby bottles is higher than it&apos;s been in decades and that shoppers are snatching up bottles and training cups made from plastics without bisphenol A. California lawmakers have taken notice: Last week, the state Legislature passed a bill to ban certain phthalates in plastic items meant for children younger than 3.


Recent widely publicized studies have shown that plastics are not only ubiquitous in the environment (marine researchers have shown that plastic debris outweighs zooplankton in remote parts of the Pacific), but are found in the bodies of nearly all Americans too. Scientists have hypothesized that chemicals in certain plastics may be linked to such conditions as asthma and even obesity. But most of the research, and the strongest evidence, points to effects that certain plastics chemicals appear to exert on the reproductive system. Findings are still considered preliminary (existing studies are small and few), but reports are enough to make consumers ask: Are plastics safe?
 
 Could our bodies be assimilating to junky diets ? Nicholas Wade of The New York Times takes a look at some interesting new research: 
 Researchers studying the enzyme that converts starch to simple sugars like glucose have found that people living in countries with a high-starch diet produce considerably more of the enzyme than people who eat a low-starch diet.


The reason is an evolutionary one. People in high-starch countries have many extra copies of the amylase gene which makes the starch-converting enzyme, a group led by George H. Perry of Arizona State University and Nathaniel J. Dominy of the University of California, Santa Cruz, reported yesterday in the journal Nature Genetics.

The production of the extra copies seems to have been favored by natural selection, according to a genetic test, the authors say. If so, the selective pressure could have occurred when people first started to grow cereals like wheat and barley at the beginning of the Neolithic revolution some 10,000 years ago, or even much earlier.
 
 Yuck! Apparently a popular brand of“salmon-spread”is reportedly contaminated with Listeria . More from the Associated Press : 
 Jensen&apos;s Old Fashioned Smokehouse Inc. is recalling two smoked-salmon spread products because they may be contaminated with bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes.


The recall includes 480 7-ounce plastic tubs of Jensen&apos;s Seattle Style Wild Smoked Salmon Spread Lemon Dill and Onion and 132 7-ounce plastic tubs of PCC brand Smoked Salmon Spread allnatural.

The products were distributed in Western Washington retail stores, the Seattle company said.

The Jensen&apos;s wild smoked-salmon spread in question is coded&quot;sell By 10/14/07 and 10/15/07&quot;and the PCC brand Smoked Salmon Spread all-natural is coded&quot;sell By 9/29/07.&quot;

The company said no illnesses have been confirmed.
 
 A new study has determined low levels of vitamin D are linked to pregnancy risk . Thomas H. Maugh II of The Los Angeles Times is on it: 
 Some researchers have suspected that low levels of vitamin D contribute to the disorder, which is characterized by soaring blood pressure and swelling of the hands and feet, but the new study is the first to examine its role directly.

Pre-eclampsia affects as many as 7 percent of first pregnancies and can progress to eclampsia, which produces seizures and often-fatal complications of the liver, kidneys, lungs, blood and nervous system. Eclampsia causes 15 percent of maternal deaths during pregnancy and as many as 70 percent of such deaths in developing countries.

Epidemiologist Lisa M. Bodnar and her colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh School of Health Sciences studied blood samples taken from women and newborns early in pregnancy and just before delivery. They identified 15 women who suffered pre-eclampsia and compared them with 220 who did not.
 
 According to the Associated Press the Food and Drug Administration wants to add nutrition symbols on food labels . Read on: 
 The Food and Drug Administration opened a two-day meeting to collect comments from food companies, trade groups, watchdog organizations, medical experts and its overseas counterparts on the topic. Any action is likely years away.


Some food manufacturers and retailers already have begun labeling foods with symbols to indicate how nutritious they are. PepsiCo uses the“Smart Spot”symbol on diet Pepsi, baked Lay’s chips and other products. Hannaford Bros., a New England supermarket chain, uses a zero to three-star system to rate more than 25,000 food items it sells. And in Britain, the government has persuaded some food companies to use a“traffic light”symbol. That ranking system relies on green, yellow and red lights to characterize whether a food is low, medium or high in fat, salt and sugar.
 
 Where’s the beef? Hopefully not on your plate! Reuters reports a whole bunch of beef patties are being recalled due to E. coli . Take a look: 
 Fairbank Farms, a U.S. ground beef producer, said on Wednesday it is voluntarily recalling beef patties sold to Shaw&apos;s Supermarkets in New England because of concerns about bacterial contamination.


Fairbank Farms said the patties could have been purchased by consumers in that area on Wednesday between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m.

 Cholesterol, Statins, and Choice 
 Posted on August 22, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese I was at the gym the other day and I overheard a couple of middle-aged tubby guys complaining about their cholesterol. To make a long story short, one was listening attentively while the other bragged about his statins—made me cringe. Why? Well, in Cholesterol Protection for Life Dr. Fuhrman talks about their side-effects, pretty scary stuff. Check it out:
 When resorting to medical intervention, rather than dietary modifications, other problems arise, reducing the potential reduction in mortality possible, as these individuals are at risk of serious side effects from the medication. The known side effects for various statins (the most popular and effective medications to lower cholesterol) include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.
 Now, I doubt my two tubby guys will heed a warning like this. After all, they belong to a gym and are still fat. But I guess they represent the millions of people that just aren’t willing to do the hard work. They’d rather pop a pill and continue eating poorly . Recently New York Times reporter Jane E. Brody was faced with this very decision—guess what she did? See for yourself:
 Now it was time to further limit red meat (though I never ate it often and always lean), stick to low-fat ice cream, eat even more fish, increase my fiber intake and add fish oils to my growing list of supplements. But the latest test, in early June, was even more of a shock: total cholesterol, 248, and LDLs, 171.


My doctor’s conclusion:“Your body is spewing out cholesterol and nothing you do to your diet is likely to stop it.”I was not inclined to become a total vegetarian to see if that would help. The time had come to try a statin, one of the miraculously effective cholesterol-lowering drugs.

By studying the effects of statins in thousands of people who already had heart disease or were likely to develop it, researchers finally proved that lowering total and LDL cholesterol in people at risk was both health-saving and life-saving. I’ll know by fall if the low-dose statin I now take nightly will do the trick, or if I’ll need a higher dose.
 Wow. That quote from the doctor is amazing. Talk about throwing in the towel. Brody is no better. I mean why wouldn’t she at least try ratcheting up her diet further? My guess is she’d be pleasantly surprised by the results, and, it’s a lot better than being saddled with statins for the rest of her life. According to Dr. Fuhrman superior nutrition would set her straight. From Eat to Live :
 A vegetable, fruit, nut, and bean-based diet has been shown to be the most effective cholesterol-lowering dietary approach in medical history. This newsworthy data with the potential to save millions of lives has been ignored by the mass media. With this dietary approach, most patients drop their total cholesterol below 150 and LDL below 100, without the need for medications…


…In areas of the world where people eat a diet of unrefined plant foods, people have total cholesterol levels below 150, and there is zero incidence of heart disease in the population.1
 A couple years ago when I was sick with gastritis and my doctor wrote me a bunch of prescriptions, I made a choice. I said I could either be beholden to drug companies for the rest of my life, or, I can beat this thing on my own terms. For me, the carrot was mightier than the prescription pad.

 Dumb Science: Isolated Vitamins NOT Magic Pills 
 Posted on August 20, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese If you spend most of your time reading health news, you’ll soon realize that for every good piece of science, there’s a broad confederacy of junk science. Take this one for example. A new study has determined that taking vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene supplements won’t prevent heart disease in high-risk women . Carolyn Colwell of HealthDay News reports:
 &quot;Antioxidants are clearly not the magic bullet for heart disease prevention,&quot;said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, the study&apos;s principal investigator and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital, in Boston.&quot;We didn&apos;t see an overall benefit or risk for these vitamins and cardiovascular disease.&quot;


The study shows that vitamins C, E and beta-carotene supplements are no substitute for conventional cardiovascular medications with proven results, added Dr. Nanette K. Wenger, an associate professor in the division of cardiology at the Emory University School of Medicine.

Women patients, in particular, seem to&quot;love their antioxidants, and sometimes, for some reason, stop life-saving medications and start taking them,&quot;added Wenger, chairwoman of the data safety and monitoring board for the study.

The findings also mean&quot;we have to redouble the efforts on conventional prevention&quot;such as healthy diet, exercise, weight control and avoiding tobacco, Manson said.&quot;One problem is that occasionally, if there is an expectation of benefit from popping a pill, people are less vigilant about controlling established risk factors and much more difficult lifestyle modifications,&quot;she added.
 Okay, I’m not a doctor, I have no medical background, and honestly, I’m not that bright, but even I know that adding vitamins to a rotten diet isn’t actually going to help improve your health. To quote some farmer,“Y’all can put a pig in a dress, but, it’s still a pig.”When I asked Dr. Fuhrman about this study, he pretty much had the same reaction:
 People that still think that individual vitamins like C and E and beta carotene are an answer to improvements in health, should put away their typewriters and white out, and take a ride in their Edsels. But, there is lots of worthless research being done out there.
 On a side note, and maybe it’s because I’m too young, but I had to Google Edsels . Okay, back to the junk science at hand. In his work Dr. Fuhrman makes it crystal clear that vitamins and pills alone aren’t the way to superior nutrition. The basis of our health and longevity can be found in the fruits, vegetables, seeds, and legumes around us—eat them! More from Eat to Live :
 When you eat mostly natural plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and beans, you get large amounts of various types of fiber. These foods are rich in complex carbohydrates and both insoluble and water-soluble fibers. The fibers slow down glucose absorption and control the rate of digestion. Plant fibers have complex physiological effects in the digestive tract that offer a variety of benefits, such as lowering cholesterol.1
 And that’s only the tip of the iceberg!

 Low Cholesterol and Cancer, Linked? 
 Posted on July 26, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Admittedly, I don’t know much about this. But apparently some scientists believe if cholesterol is too low, there’s an increased risk of cancer. Take this study for example. New research provides evidence for a link between low LDL levels and cancer risk . More from EurekAlert :
 The authors of the study, published in the July 31, 2007, issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), set out to understand how and why statins cause side effects, particularly damage to the liver and muscle cells. The study findings support taking multiple medications rather than high-dose statins to minimize those side effects. The researchers did not expect to find the increased cancer risk (one additional incident per 1,000 patients) from low LDL levels, and additional studies have already begun to investigate this potential risk further. A key component in future studies will be to confirm the risk and to identify whether the risk may be a side effect of statins or just low LDL.


“This analysis doesn’t implicate the statin in increasing the risk of cancer,”said lead author Richard H. Karas, M.D., F.A.C.C., professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.“The demonstrated benefits of statins in lowering the risk of heart disease remain clear; however, certain aspects of lowering LDL with statins remain controversial and merit further research.”

The researchers found one additional incident of cancer per 1,000 patients with low LDL levels when compared to patients with higher LDL levels. In their evaluation of randomized controlled statin trials published before November 2005, the researchers looked at 13 treatment arms consisting of 41,173 patients.
 (via The Diabetes Blog ) 
 Now, as an Eat to Liver I know my vegetable-based diet is working to reduce my cholesterol to disease-proofing range. So naturally, this research doesn’t make much sense to me. In order to clear this up—and basically shoot down this study—I dug up this post: Can Cholesterol Be Too Low? Here’s an excerpt:
 There was some controversy years ago about striving for lower, protective cholesterol levels after some studies in the eighties noted that depression, suicide, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, and death from other causes, were higher in some groups with very low cholesterol groups. Larger, recent investigations studying larger populations did not confirm these questionable findings.


When investigators looked more carefully at the individual characteristics of the studied populations they were able to explain the earlier findings. This issue is complicated because these studies evaluated individuals who were eating the modern American diet, rich in saturated fat and other components of animal products that raise cholesterol, and low in plant derived anti-oxidants, phytochemicals, and essential fatty acids that improve cholesterol ratios. Those who demonstrated very low (ideal) cholesterol levels, while following the traditional, modern, cholesterol-promoting diet, may actually have a compromised health status or undetected chronic disease.

For instance, we know cancer causes less cholesterol production in the liver. Low cholesterol may be associated with cancer, but does not cause it. Researchers showed that cholesterol starts to fall up to 8 years prior to a person dying of cancer, and that those with the greatest drop in cholesterol in a 4 year period without dietary improvements to lower cholesterol were those most likely to develop cancer.1 The low cholesterol did not cause the cancer; the cancer caused the low cholesterol. Those who work to lower cholesterol by avoiding saturated fats, eating a high nutrient diet with lots of raw vegetables, cooked green vegetables, and beans do not have a pathological condition causing their low cholesterol. They earned it.

This is why in rural China where the diets are nearly vegetarian, the average cholesterol levels are low and you see lower cancer rates, not higher. Those with the lowest cholesterol in the China study actually had the lowest cancer rates as well. Obviously, there is a difference between one who has a low cholesterol because his dietary style earns it, and one whose cholesterol seems unjustifiably low on a modern heart-disease-promoting diet that almost everyone in the west eats.
 Now in my humble—and very layman—opinion, the above study is just the kind of junk science that misinforms people and leads them down the path of disease and premature death. Consider this: Increased Risk of Cancer Associated with The Atkins Diet .

 What Doctors Don&apos;t Know 
 Posted on July 23, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese The Cardio Blog is all over research suggesting many doctors aren’t worried about patients&apos; out of whack cholesterol . Take a look:
 61% of doctors stated they don&apos;t feel frustrated when they are unable to lower cholesterol levels in their patients, despite understanding the severe health risks that go along with it. Are they not taking it seriously? Is it that they just don&apos;t expect their patients to take it seriously? Whatever the issue, make sure you have a doctor that takes a personal interest in you and your health.
 Now I respect doctors—heck, I work for one—but sometimes what they don’t realize is truly amazing. Dr. Fuhrman provides an example in Eat to Live :
 I see about twenty to thirty new patients per week, and I always ask them,“Which has more protein—one hundred calories of sirloin steak or one hundred calories of broccoli?”When I tell them it’s broccoli, the most frequent response I get is“I didn’t know broccoli had protein in it.”then ask them,“So where did you think the calories in broccoli come from? Did you think it was mostly fat, like an avocado, or mostly carbohydrate, like a potato?”


People know less about nutrition than any other subject. Even the physicians and dietitians who attend my lectures quickly volunteer the answer,“Steak!”They are surprised to learn that broccoli has about twice as much protein as steak.

 Pistachios for Your Ticker 
 Posted on June 19, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Back in April, HealthDay News reported that pistachios may help take a bite out of cholesterol , and now, The Cardio Blog passes on information linking pistachio consumption to heart health . Here’s more:
 Do you have high cholesterol? Apparently pistachios may help, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition. This challenges the long-held notion that only a diet low in fat will help combat cholesterol, since pistachios have moderate amounts of fat. True, it&apos;s a healthy fat but it&apos;s a at nonetheless. If you&apos;re concerned about your cholesterol, however, it&apos;s recommended that you get between one and two handfuls a day -- no more than that and certainly not in ice cream form.
 Not exactly new news to Dr. Fuhrman, he believes that both nuts and seeds are vital parts of the human diet. From Nuts and Seeds Are Excellent Foods :
 Nuts and seeds are a natural part of the diet of homo-sapiens. They are perfectly adapted to the taste and ability of humans to pick, dry, store, and crack. No wonder study after study shows raw nuts and seeds not only lower cholesterol, but protect against common diseases of aging. I recommend almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios, macadamias, filberts, and walnuts; and sunflower, sesame, flax, and pumpkin seeds. These delicious natural foods are high in nutrients and healthful unsaturated fats.
 I got to agree with Dr. Fuhrman on this one. Check out this sampling of nuts and seeds in my house right now:

 
Yup, there’s raw almonds, cashews, peanuts, sunflower seeds, and ground flaxseed in there—yum!

 Kids and Heart Disease 
 Posted on May 14, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese It’s kind of an obvious point, but, I don’t think a lot of people realize this. Heart disease—which reeks havoc on millions of adults—starts young. According to Dr. Fuhrman the seeds of cardiovascular disease are sown way before adulthood. He talks about it in Disease-Proof Your Child :
 There is considerable evidence that the lipoprotein abnormalities (high LDL and low HDL) that are linked to heart attack deaths in adulthood begin to develop in early childhood and that higher cholesterol levels eventually get“set”by early food habits.1 What we eat during our childhood affects our lifetime cholesterol levels. For many, changing the diet to a plant-based, low-saturated-fat diet in later life does not result in the favorable cholesterol levels that would have been seen if the dietary improvements were started much earlier in life.


As a result of the heart-unfriendly diet, blood vessel damage begins early. Not only does the development of coronary atherosclerosis develop in childhood, but earlier development of atherosclerosis and higher serum cholesterol levels in childhood result in a significantly higher risk of premature sudden death relatively early in life. Sometimes the effects of childhood dietary abuses can be seen relatively early, with premature death or a heart attack at a young age.
 And now, it seems there is a movement to test children early on for the risks of heart disease . Karen Pallarito of HealthDay News reports:
 Obesity, inactivity and cholesterol are closely linked, and data from the latest U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) finds that 17 percent of U.S. teens are overweight. Just one in four high school students packs enough physical activity into their day, and 12 percent get little or no daily exercise, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


So, measuring kids&apos; cholesterol in a really detailed way may make sense.

&quot;There is growing scientific evidence indicating that cholesterol levels in childhood and adolescence have an effect on the development of plaque in the arteries, which is a clear indication of cardiovascular disease risk,&quot;explained study leader Ian Janssen, an assistant professor in the School of Kinesiology and Health Studies at Queens University in Ontario, Canada.
 We’ve seen these types of initiatives before. A couple years ago the American Heart Association announced plans to target the very young.

 Nutritional Wisdom: Dangers of the Atkins Diet 
 Posted on May 3, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
I admit. It’s easy to poke fun at the low-carb lifestyle. What can I say? I’m a sucker for low-hanging fruit. But truth be told, Dr. Fuhrman makes it pretty clear that carbohydrate restrictive diets—like the Atkins Diet—are no way to achieve optimal long-term health. You only have to check out these posts to see why:

 The Physician and The Student How a High-Protein Diet Works Increased Risk of Cancer Associated with The Atkins Diet Short and Long-Term Dangers of High-Fat Diets What Happens When You Tell The Truth About Atkins Examining Dr. Atkins&apos; Death—UPDATED Dangers of High-Protein, Low-Carb Diets 

But despite all this, millions of people pledge allegiance to a fad diet centered on animal fat. A huge concern for Dr. Fuhrman because—as he points out in the posts above—any diet where the majority of calories come from animal products increases your risk of cancer, heart disease, and a whole host of life-shortening maladies.


As you’ve seen, I’m quick to knock low-carb living. And so is Dr. Fuhrman, but, he’s smarter than me—yes, a little brownnosing here—so when he takes Atkins-type diets to task, he really exposes them for the over-hyped danger zones that they are.

Curious to hear what that sounds like? You’re in luck. Because it just so happens this week’s episode of Nutrition Wisdom is on that very subject. Here’s a bit I transcribed from the show. In it Dr. Fuhrman talks about how dangerous an Atkins-type diet can be for children and others. In fact, it can have deadly consequences. Take a look:
 In recent years with the skyrocketing popularity of the Atkins Diet, there’s been a proportional skyrocketed increase in sudden cardiac death in young women. That parallels the increase in ketogenic diets. Right now we know that sudden cardiac death means irregular heart beat, as in cardiac arrhythmia. There has to be a warning on the Atkins Diet! There must be a warning that severe carbohydrate restriction—restricted ketosis—when you go into ketosis because of severe carbohydrate restriction, as a weight control method. There could be a traumatic increase in sudden death.


There was an important study in the Southern Medical Journal about a sixteen year-old girl who died after two weeks of following an Atkins Diet . They found that she was in profound acidosis, with about a twenty point base deficit because undeniably keto-acidosis caused acidosis in the blood. In other words, you can become highly acidic. We get dramatic lowering of potassium levels, especially when you first start out on the diet.

The continual denial of the dangers by the people who embrace and promote this ketogenic diet—it’s understandable why—because people are often economically invested with their egos and their food preferences into this diet. But, the risk of carbohydrate restriction ketosis is very powerful and with a lot of studies done on children who were put on ketogenic diets for seizure disorders and they use this for people who have seizures that are retractable—meaning they can’t be helped any other way—and they warn the parents of these children that it increases the risk of kidney stones, kidney failure, increases the rate of infection, and sudden cardiac death, including cardiomyopathy and cardiac-arrhythmias. For example, one study following children put on ketogenic diets—like an Atkins-type diet—they showed fifteen percent developed cardiac enlargement and dilated cardiomyopathy. Of course the diet had to be stopped.

Another study followed 129 children and found that seventeen developed severe complications and four people died out of the 129; two of sepsis because of the increased risk of infection, one of cardiomyopathy, and one of lipoid pneumonia. The point is when doctors are very careful they know these are dangerous diets, and they advise people of the dangers, but if a person wants to try it it’s their right. But the claims made by the Atkins people, for example, Atkins himself used say prevent breast cancer with butter, reverse heart disease with fillet mignon, it’s all the lying and misinformation and lack of telling people the risks of a diet that has such a great amount of dangers.
 
Lying? Of course they’re lying. There are millions of dollars at stake here. Can’t let unsightly truths get out—politicians have known this for years, but fortunately the truth does eek its way out every once and a while. For example, get a load of this study in European Journal of Clinical Nutrition . Dr. Fuhrman emailed it to me the other day. Apparently prolonged consumption of a low-carbohydrate–high-protein diet is associated with an increase in total mortality . Read on: 
 
 Subjects methods: 
Follow-up was performed from 1993 to 2003 in the context of the Greek component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition. Participants were 22 944 healthy adults, whose diet was assessed through a validated questionnaire. Participants were distributed by increasing deciles according to protein intake or carbohydrate intake, as well as by an additive score generated by increasing decile intake of protein and decreasing decile intake of carbohydrates. Proportional hazards regression was used to assess the relation between high protein, high carbohydrate and the low carbohydrate–high protein score on the one hand and mortality on the other.


 Results: 
During 113 230 persons years of follow-up, there were 455 deaths. In models with energy adjustment, higher intake of carbohydrates was associated with significant reduction of total mortality, whereas higher intake of protein was associated with nonsignificant increase of total mortality (per decile, mortality ratios 0.94 with 95% CI 0.89–0.99, and 1.02 with 95% CI 0.98–1.07 respectively). Even more predictive of higher mortality were high values of the additive low carbohydrate–high protein score (per 5 units, mortality ratio 1.22 with 95% CI 1.09–to 1.36). Positive associations of this score were noted with respect to both cardiovascular and cancer mortality.
 
But sadly, this won’t phase the low-carb lemmings of the world. They’ll just yammer on and on about how much weight they lost and how great it feels not to give up their emotional attachments to fatty foods.“Whaa-whaa-whaa! Why can’t I eat steak wrapped in bacon and fried in butter every night—but I want it!”

 Pistachios, Cholesterol, and Health 
 Posted on May 1, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese High cholesterol, not exactly a ticket for extended health and longevity—but don’t take my word for it! I’m just a blogger. According to Dr. Fuhrman, keeping your cholesterol down is a good idea, especially if you plan on living a longtime. From Disease-Proof Your Child :
 Heart disease begins in our youth and is not easy to reverse. No one should eat more than five grams of saturated fat a day. Over this level, disease rates climb.


All food derived from animals contain cholesterol and tend to be high in the thick, heavy fats called saturated fats. Most plant foods are very low in saturated fat, except for some tropical plant oils like palm and coconut oil that are naturally saturated.

Reducing the consumption of animal foods reduces the consumption of cholesterol and saturated fat. Low intake of cholesterol and saturated fat leads to a leaner body, clean arteries, and reducing risk of developing heart disease and many other diet-related diseases such as stroke, breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, and obesity.
 So then, how do you keep your cholesterol within a healthy range? Expensive medications and invasive procedures? Well, Dr. Fuhrman wouldn’t recommend this approach. He talks about it in Invasive Cardiology Procedures and Surgeries Are Not Effective :
 Bypass surgery and angioplasty only attempt to treat a small segment of the diseased heart, usually with only temporary benefit. Since atherosclerotic plaque blankets all the vessels in the heart, bypassing or removing the most diseased portion, still does not address all the shallow and non-obstructive lipid deposits. The major burden of disease is left intact and therefore the potential for a deadly heart attack is largely unaffected. The vast majority of patients who undergo these interventions do not have fewer new heart attacks or longer survival. The procedures themselves expose the patients to more risk of new heart attacks, strokes, infection, encephalopathy, and death. In addition, the symptomatic benefits erode with time.
 Apparently pills and drugs aren’t really miracle workers either. Dr. Fuhrman elaborates in his book Cholesterol Protection for Life :
 When resorting to medical intervention, rather than dietary modifications, other problems arise, reducing the potential reduction in mortality possible, as these individuals are at risk of serious side effects from the medication. The known side effects for various statins (the most popular and effective medications to lower cholesterol) include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.
 Okay, if medications and procedures don’t cut the mustard, what does? Well, it seems wholesome natural food will do the trick. Just check out this report. HealthDay News reports that pistachios have similar heart-healthy effects to leafy green vegetables . Pretty cool, right? Robert Preidt has more:
 &quot;Pistachio amounts of 1.5 ounces and three ounces (per day) -- one to two handfuls -- reduced risk for cardiovascular disease by significantly reducing LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) cholesterol levels, and the higher dose significantly reducing lipoprotein ratios,&quot;study author Sarah K. Gebauer, a graduate student in integrative biosciences at Penn State, said in a prepared statement.


The multi-week study, which received funding from the California Pistachio Commission , concluded that three ounces of pistachios a day reduced LDL levels by 11.6 percent, total cholesterol levels by 8.4 percent, and non-high density lipoproteins (non-HDL) by 11.2 percent. Levels of non-HDL are considered reliable predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
 This is great news, but hardly new news. Dr. Fuhrman has been talking about the healthful properties of nuts and seeds for years. More on that from Nuts and Seeds Are Excellent Foods :
 Nuts and seeds are a natural part of the diet of homo-sapiens. They are perfectly adapted to the taste and ability of humans to pick, dry, store, and crack. No wonder study after study shows raw nuts and seeds not only lower cholesterol, but protect against common diseases of aging. I recommend almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios, macadamias, filberts, and walnuts; and sunflower, sesame, flax, and pumpkin seeds. These delicious natural foods are high in nutrients and healthful unsaturated fats.

 Meat: Grill, Fry, or Broil it? 
 Posted on April 25, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese It seems neither. A new study claims that grilled, fried, or broiled meat contain toxins called&quot;advanced glycation end products&quot;(AGEs). And, Robert Preidt of HealthDay News reports that AGEs can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, like diabetes and vascular disease . Here’s more:
 Grilled, fried or broiled animal products such as meats and cheeses contain a class of toxins called&quot;advanced glycation end products&quot;(AGEs), which have been linked to inflammation, insulin resistance, diabetes, vascular and kidney disease, and Alzheimer&apos;s disease, say a team from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City…


…&quot;AGEs are quite deceptive, since they also give our food desirable tastes and smells,&quot;senior author Dr. Helen Vlassara, professor of medicine and geriatrics, and director of the Division of Experimental Diabetes and Aging at Mount Sinai, said in a prepared statement.

&quot;So, consuming high amounts of grilled, broiled or fried food means consuming significant amounts of AGEs, and AGEs in excess are toxic. People should be given information about AGE intake and be advised to consider their intake in the same way they would think about their trans fats and salt intake. They should be warned about their AGE levels the way they are about their cholesterol levels or cigarette smoking,&quot;Vlassara said.
 Dr. Fuhrman makes it pretty clear. Too much meat and other animal products can contribute to serious health problems, namely cancer and cardiovascular disease. Here are couple posts that highlight this connection:

 The Meat-Disease Connection Animal Fat and Cancer 
Okay, back to cooking foods. Does it really matter how we prepare our food? Be it animal or vegetable-based. Well for starters, Dr. Fuhrman doesn’t thinking frying is a good idea. He explains why in Disease-Proof Your Child :
 Water-based cooking is the preferred way to cook because you can avoid cancer-causing acrylamides that are created when foods are browned by baking or frying.


Never eat browned or overly cooked food. Burnt food forms harmful compounds. If by accident something is overcooked and browned, discard. Avoid fried food and food sautéed in oil. Experiment with low heat cooking to prevent nutritional damage to the food and the formation of dangerous heat-generated compounds.
 Now, recently I asked Dr. Fuhrman if acrylamides show up in other foods, like cooked meats, specifically barbecued meat. No surprise here, his answer was yes. Actually, he pointed out that acrylamides form in all foods. Check out this study from the Scandinavian Journal of Nutrition , it sheds some light on the development of acrylamides :
 The exact chemical mechanism(s) for acrylamide formation in heated foods is unknown. Several plausible mechanistic routes may be suggested, involving reactions of carbohydrates, proteins/amino acids, lipids and probably also other food components as precursors. With the data and knowledge available today it is not possible to point out any specific routes, or to exclude any possibilities. It is likely that a multitude of reaction mechanisms is involved. Acrolein is one strong precursor candidate, the origin of which could be lipids, carbohydrates or proteins/amino acids. Acrylamide is a reactive molecule and it can readily react with various other components in the food. The actual acrylamide level in a specific food product, therefore, probably reflects the balance between ease of formation and potential for further reactions in that food matrix. There are indications in support of that the Maillard reaction being an important reaction route for acrylamide formation, but lipid degradation pathways to the formation of acrolein should also be considered.
 At this point it kind of seems like a basic math equation. If too many animal products are bad and eating overly cooked food is also bad, then putting the two of them together has got to be really bad, right? Well, it sure seems that way. In Disease-Proof Your Child Dr. Fuhrman considers barbequed meat (and cheese) one of the worst foods you can eat for health and longevity. From the book:
 Worst Seven Foods for Health and Longevity 

 Butter Cheese Potato Chips and French Fries Doughnuts Salt Sausage, hot dogs Pickled, smoked or barbequed meat 

Foods high in saturated fat and trans fat are consistently associated with high cancer rates. Cheese and butter typically contain over ten times as much saturated fat as fish and white meat chicken and turkey.


Add the carcinogenic potential from heated and overcooked oils (usually trans containing) delivered in doughnuts and fries with the powerful cancer inducing properties of carbohydrates cooked at high heat (acrylamide formation) and you have a great cancer potion.
 So, will people heed these warnings and cut back on the amount of animal products they eat and be careful not to dangerously cook their food? My guess, probably not, especially with this kind of rhetoric kicking around the blogosphere. Like LivinLaVidaLowCarb’s ringing endorsement of frying meat in butter —sadly, I’m not kidding. Proceed with caution:
 I agree with the advice to shun the fried foods specifically because of the breading. But if you want to fry up your meat in a pan full of butter, then knock yourself out. It’s a healthy way to enjoy that succulent protein-loaded food.


While it’s nice to bake, broil, and especially grill meats, don’t fall for the illusion that cooking these ways is any healthier than cooking meat in fat. Avoid the trans fats, of course, but you shouldn’t worry about saturated fats as long as you are livin’la vida low-carb.
 Take a moment to note that butter is also on Dr. Fuhrman’s list of the seven worst foods. Okay, it gets worse. Check out this quote from Carbohydrate Addict, apparently this Atkins dieter thinks grilled-cheese is fabulous —sigh. Here it is:
 I think one of the reasons Atkins was so perfect for me was because I was on low fat/low cholesterol for sooooo many years. All of the forbidden foods suddenly became okay to eat without guilt and my cholesterol is finally FABULOUS. I&apos;m still on a high when I eat them! Egg salad, bacon, chicken wings, mac and cheese, grilled cheese.... YUM!
 Yum? For bacon and egg salad? Whoa! What a world we live in. Reading rants like this makes me think about the opposite. What does eating a lot of fruits and vegetables do for us? Well, when you’re talking health and disease-prevention, Dr. Fuhrman explains they’re the best! From Fruits and Veggies vs. Diabetes and Colon Cancer :
 While fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of nutrients, the consumption of vegetables is more helpful in reducing cancer because they contain much higher amounts of cancer-protective compounds-- especially green vegetables. Among these green vegetables, the cruciferous family has demonstrated the most dramatic protection against cancer. Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, bok choy, collards, arugala, watercress, and cabbage) contain a symphony of phytonutrients with potent anti-cancer effects. Isothiocyanates (ITCs), which are perhaps the best studied, have been shown to provide protection against environmental carcinogen exposure by inducing detoxification pathways, thereby neutralizing potential carcinogens.


These vegetables also contain indole-3- carbinol (I3C). Indole-3-carbinol has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer by decreasing estrogen activity. Important recent studies have shown that cruciferous vegetables and the compounds they contain can do the following:

 Halt the growth of breast cancer cells1 Dramatically reduce the risk of colon cancer2 Prevent the replication of prostate cancer cells and induce death of cancerous cells3 Inhibit the progression of lung cancer4 
 And here’s more, from Is Heart Disease Totally Preventable ? Take a look:
 The Eat to Live vegetable, fruit, nut, and bean-based diet has been shown to be the most effective cholesterol-lowering dietary approach in medical history. This newsworthy data with the potential to save millions of lives has been ignored by the mass media. With this dietary approach, most patients drop their total cholesterol below 150 and LDL below 100, without the need for medications.


During the two years that the Eat to Live vegetable, fruit, nut, and bean-based diet has been under research study by the University of Southern California, patients have shown an average weight loss of forty-nine pounds, the most sustained weight loss ever recorded in a medical study in history.

In areas of the world where people eat a diet of unrefined plant foods, people have total cholesterol levels below 150, and there is zero incidence of heart disease in the population.5

 Garlic and Garlic Supplements 
 Posted on February 28, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese New research claims garlic and garlic supplements don’t reduce cholesterol . Thomas H. Maugh II of The Los Angeles Times reports:
 In an editorial accompanying the paper in the journal, Drs. Mary Charlson and Marcus McFerren of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City wrote that the authors&quot;convincingly demonstrate that raw garlic and two popularly used supplements do not reduce cholesterol.&quot;


The study did not rule out the possibility that garlic has some other beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, Gardner said, but those potential effects need to be studied in similar trials.
 This is kind of a no-brainer. Dr. Fuhrman will tell you, the key isn’t taking supplements or eating small amounts of healthy food in conjunction with the standard American diet. You need a total diet over all, not just putting a pig in a dress—or should I say putting a garlic supplement in a Chalupa.

 Seven Secrets of Longevity 
 Posted on February 13, 2007 by Joel Fuhrman From the March 2004 edition of Dr. Fuhrman’s Healthy Times : 

A careful study of long-lived people and long-lived populations around the world—combined with a comprehensive understanding of animal experiments effecting animal life span—makes it clear that decisive action must be taken if we wish to retard aging and protect ourselves against the diseases of aging. (Check out Animal Fat and Cancer and Animal vs. Plant Foods and Heart Disease in Pictures .) 

With so many conflicting theories and ideas swirling about, it is not surprising that there is mass confusion in the general population about what is healthy and what is not. However, there is nothing confusing about the scientific evidence regarding health. Health excellence, high-level mental and physical performance as we age, disease prevention, and longevity all are linked to certain well-documented behaviors. In short, health is the result of healthful living, and healthful living involves seven key concepts.

The human body has a built-in capacity for healing and rejuvenation. This inborn process can be inhibited by a variety of influences, such as personal habits and the environment. The best and most effective methods for renewing health are to follow the requirements of proper diet, wholesome environment, appropriate activities, and adequate sleep.

The idea that you can purchase health or longevity by taking Growth Hormone, DHEA, testosterone, estrogen, or IV vitamin drips has not been backed up by animal or human studies. You simply cannot purchase longer life from a health food store or from an anti-aging physician who dispenses hormones. Food choice is the single most important factor effecting human health, and it is easily within our control. Good food choices, in combination with other important health factors, give you your best possible chance for a long and rewarding life.

The seven key concepts in longevity are listed below. Your best health insurance is to keep these guidelines in mind and to put them into practice. The finest health care in the world is proper self care—learning to live so healthfully that you can safely avoid hospitals, doctors, drugs, and surgery.

Today, many people in our society mistakenly think heart disease and cancer are the result of living longer—a natural consequence of aging. (A similar misconception is the notion that disease is largely genetic and beyond our control.) Healthy populations around the world see no heart disease or cancer in their eldest. Plus, there are no strokes in populations consuming natural food diets with no added salt.

Disease is not caused by aging. Disease is caused by those negative influences that stress the body over the years and lead to eventual cellular dysfunction and breakdown. Water dripping on a rock over thousands of years may eventually wear a hole in the rock. But it is not time that makes the hole; it is the water hitting the rock over and over. In a similar way, we create the diseases of aging through our behavior. Fortunately, we can just as easily create a long, hundred year life span, free of serious illness from birth to a gentle death.

 Here&apos;s more from this DiseaseProof miniseries: 

 Secret 1: Eat Fewer Calories and Live Longer Secret 2: Prevent Deficiencies with Plant-Based Nutrition Secret 3: Regular Exercise Pays Big Health Dividends Secret 4: Avoid Toxins, Including Medication Secret 5: Get Sufficient Rest and Sleep for Recovery Secret 6: An Emotionally Satisfying Environment is Vital Secret 7: Fast When You are Under the Weather Seven Secrets of Longevity: In Conclusion

 Heart Disease a Sneak Attack? 
 Posted on February 5, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Okay, I know, it’s a bit of a hack move, but let’s talk about the Super Bowl commercials. Specifically the one where the guy in the heart suit gets his butt kicked. Now I realize its supposed to be light hearted, but the American Heart Association seems to be sending the message that things like high blood pressure, diabetes, and being overweight just sneak up on you, and, when you least except it—WHAM—you have a heart attack. If you didn’t see it, here it is:

 
Sure, the ad is encouraging people to help beat their risk of developing heart disease, but the way its presented really seems to imply that there’s nothing you can do about it, other than just hope that these bad things don’t happen—which in my opinion is the bad attitude that lands millions of people in the hospital with chest pains every year. What do you think? Maybe I&apos;m wrong on this. Personally, I think the commercial with the bunny clicking the mouse was the best.

 Pomegranates, Atherosclerosis, and Diabetics 
 Posted on February 1, 2007 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese The pomegranate is a bad mama jama and I mean that in the cool Shaft way. According to Dr. Fuhrman pomegranate juice can help lower blood pressure and reduce in atherosclerotic plaque buildup? Not to mention, it’s a powerful anti-oxidant and has strong anti-cancer effects. He discusses pomegranates at length in Pomegranate Power . Have a taste:
 Recent medical research completed in 2004 studied heart patients with severe carotid artery blockages. They were given an ounce of pomegranate juice for a year, and not only did their blood pressure lower by over 20 percent, but there was a 30 percent reduction in atherosclerotic plaque…1


…Pomegranates’potent antioxidant compounds have also been shown to reduce platelet aggregation and naturally lower blood pressure, factors that prevent both heart attacks and strokes.2 Pomegranates contain high levels of flavonoids and polyphenols, potent antioxidants offering protection against heart disease and cancer. A glass of pomegranate juice has more antioxidants than red wine, green tea, blueberries, and cranberries.
 Here’s some more good PR for pomegranates. Apparently a new study has revealed pomegranate juice also reduces the risk of arthrosclerosis in diabetics . The Diabetes Blog is on it:
 The results of this study suggest that the antioxidants found in pomegranate juice may be beneficial in reducing these heart-related risks associated with diabetes. The sugars in pomegranate juice are attached to unique antioxidants, which actually make these sugars protective against atherosclerosis. Researchers examined the effects of drinking a concentrated pomegranate juice that is the equivalent to about a 6-ounce glass of freshly squeezed pomegranate juice for three months in 10 healthy adults and 10 adults with type 2 diabetes (who were not dependent on insulin therapy).
 Perhaps the only knock against pomegranates is they can be hard to find. Take my farmers market for example, unfortunately they only have them a fraction of the year—argh! Anyone else have difficulty tracking down fresh pomegranates?

If you’d like to know more about pomegranates, check out these previous posts. They deal with pomegranates and prostate health. Take a look:

 Cholesterol Levels and Heart Attacks 
 Posted on January 23, 2007 by Joel Fuhrman Adapted from the revised version of Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection for Life : 

There is irrefutable evidence that high cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Make no doubt about it: lowering your LDL cholesterol below 100 offers powerful protection against heart disease. The evidence is overwhelming today that heart attacks, which kill half of all Americans, are entirely preventable. Heart disease is a condition that is preventable and reversible through aggressive nutritional intervention and cholesterol-lowering.

The latest recommendation from most medical authorities and medical organizations such as the American College of Cardiology is to lower LDL cholesterol level below 100. This is in accordance with what has been observed for years in epidemiology studies. People in countries who ate a more simple plant-based diet did not have heart attacks and those populations are always found to have much lower cholesterol levels than was thought to be acceptable in the past. For instance, the average total cholesterol in rural China was 127 and the average LDL was below 80. Heart attacks in rural China were exceedingly rare. The same thing was observed in multiple interventional and population studies, such as the Harvard Health Study; those with LDL’s below 100 were not observed to have heart attacks. Medical authorities are now finally in agreement that much lower cholesterol levels are needed to be truly protective.

It would be foolish for anyone not to maintain an LDL cholesterol below 100 or total cholesterol below 150 mg/dl. Less than 10% of the adult population in America, however, actually has cholesterol levels that meet these newest recommendations, designed for more significant reduction in cardiac deaths.1

Recent medical trials reinforce the importance of maintaining LDL levels below 100 for significant protection and have led medical authorities to recommend cholesterol-lowering drugs to the vast majority of Americans.

When resorting to medical intervention, rather than dietary modifications, other problems arise, reducing the potential reduction in mortality possible, as these individuals are at risk of serious side effects from the medication. The known side effects for various statins (the most popular and effective medications to lower cholesterol) include hepatitis, jaundice, other liver problems, gastrointestinal upsets, muscle problems and a variety of blood complications such as reduced platelet levels and anemia.

 Invasive Cardiology Procedures and Surgeries Are Not Effective 
 Posted on December 25, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman From Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection For Life : 

Bypass surgery and angioplasty only attempt to treat a small segment of the diseased heart, usually with only temporary benefit. Since atherosclerotic plaque blankets all the vessels in the heart, bypassing or removing the most diseased portion, still does not address all the shallow and non-obstructive lipid deposits. The major burden of disease is left intact and therefore the potential for a deadly heart attack is largely unaffected. The vast majority of patients who undergo these interventions do not have fewer new heart attacks or longer survival. The procedures themselves expose the patients to more risk of new heart attacks, strokes, infection, encephalopathy, and death. In addition, the symptomatic benefits erode with time.

Since these mechanical interventions do not address the cause of the disease and only treat the symptoms it is not surprising that the patients undergoing bypass and angioplasty experience disease progression, graft shutdown, restenosis, and more procedures because their heart disease continues to advance. The vast majority of these treated patients needlessly die prematurely from heart disease because their disease remains essentially untreated.

Using surgical and high-tech interventions as a substitute for a healthful diet is doomed to fail. When extensive coronary artery disease is present and surgical/high-tech intervention occurs, we still leave the vast bulk of plaque essentially untreated because atherosclerosis is a dietary-induced disease and is spread all over the heart, not only in those areas visualized by angiograms and then treated. When we combine these marginally effective or ineffective medical interventions with the wrong dietary advice given by most doctors and dieticians (to reduce fat and cholesterol and eat less red meat and more chicken and fish) we get predictable future cardiac tragedies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that following the typical dietary recommendations of the American Heart Association to hold cholesterol to less than 200 mg per day and to reduce dietary fat to less than 30 percent doesn&apos;t work. These diets fail to realize that the nutritional cause of heart disease is not simply a question of eating less fat. Moderation kills, because heart disease still advances.

Heart attacks result from a defect in the plaque wall which leads to a thrombus (blood clot). Even a small coating of vulnerable plaque, invisible to cardiac testing, can cause a heart attack and typically does. The important point to remember is this: Individuals without major blockages of their great vessels, with only 30 to 50 percent stenosis (narrowing), are even more likely to develop a fatal cardiac event, (compared to those with more significant blockages) yet these individuals are not even shown to have heart disease with a stress test or angiography. Stress testing only identifies blockages that obstruct greater than eighty-five percent of the vessel lumen. A normal stress test is meaningless and does not mean you do not have significant heart disease or won&apos;t shortly have a heart attack.

Even coronary catherization (angiography) does not identify those smaller non-occluding atherosclerotic deposits, and therefore interventional strategies do not treat patients with shallower lesions, in spite of the fact that these are the people who suffer the most heart attacks. It is not the extent of the blockage that determines risk; it is the vulnerability of the plaque or its propensity to rupture.

Seventy to eighty percent of all myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) are caused by plaque that is not obstructive or visible on angiography or stress tests.

When athromas (lipid deposits) first develop on the wall of a blood vessel, the walls remodel outward, preserving the lumen. These are the most vulnerable or lethal plaques and they do not obstruct or encroach on the blood flow. These heart attack prone lesions have dangerous characteristics that are not revealed by cardiac testing. A normal test by your cardiologist means very little in reassuring you about your risk of a future heart attack.

Inflammatory cells, and a large lipid core of cholesterol in the plaques is characteristic of the most dangerous lesions. The breakage or rupture of these vulnerable lesions causes heart attacks. Cardiac surgery and angioplasty does not address one&apos;s risk of a later heart attack, as it does not remove or reduce the probability that these unrecognized vulnerable plaques will rupture and create a clot. Most people think going to cardiologists and radiologists to get evaluated to see if they have a significant coronary blockage will enable an intervention at an early enough point to save their life; they are dead wrong. Angioplasties and stent placements as well as cardiac surgery treat symptoms, not the disease.

The good news is symptoms, as well as blockages, easily melt away with nutritional excellence, without any cardiac intervention. The risks and complications of cardiac interventions and bypass surgeries are simply not necessary when people adopt an effective nutritional strategy. Instead of expensive and invasive medicine, we need doctors to educate and motivate patients to take charge of their own health. While our population is committing suicide with their knives and forks, they run to doctors expecting to be saved. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to escape from the biological laws of cause and effect. Good health has to be earned, it can&apos;t be bought.

Compelling data from numerous population and interventional studies show that the combination of a natural plant-based diet and aggressive lipid-lowering will prevent, arrest, and even reverse heart disease. Only via nutritional excellence can you address all the invisible, but potentially dangerous plaque throughout your coronary arteries. Unlike surgery and angioplasty, the dietary approach addressed in this book does not merely treat your heart, but rejuvenates all your blood vessels and protects your entire body against heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolisms, venous thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease, and vascular dementia. It is your most valuable insurance policy to secure a longer life free of medical tragedy.

In the 20th century, the average American diet shifted from one based on fresh, minimally processed vegetable foods to one based on animal products and highly refined, processed foods. As a result, Americans now consume far more calories, fat, cholesterol, refined sugar, animal protein, sodium, and alcohol and far less fiber and plant-derived nutrients than is healthful. Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer have skyrocketed.

Heart attacks and strokes kill more than half of the modern world today and are the largest killers of both men and women. But, the promising news is that these common causes of death are avoidable and can be effectively reversed through aggressive nutritional intervention.

By adopting a program of superior nutrition in conjunction with the judicious use of cholesterol-lowering nutritional supplements with proven cardio-protective effects, you can actually lower your cholesterol more than cholesterol-lowering drugs. It is possible to achieve an LDL cholesterol level below 100, get significantly more benefits, (almost total protection from heart attacks) and none of the risks associated with conventional drugs and invasive procedures to prevent and treat heart disease.

When it comes to your health and your heart, do not be satisfied with mediocrity. This is critical information and the most important decision you may face in your life. I encourage you to make the decision to protect yourself from the possibility of future tragedy. Tags: Cardiovascular Disease , Cholesterol , Healthy Food , Hurtful Food

 Not Everyone Gets It 
 Posted on December 15, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman From Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection For Life : 

 What if my family, my friends and my doctor think this is not right? 

Keep in mind that nutritional excellence is not for everyone. Some people will choose to smoke cigarettes, eat unhealthful, or pursue other reckless habits. Dangerous habits are powerfully addicting and some people would risk their lives rather than fight them. They have the inalienable right to live their life the way they choose. The problem is that most people have not been given a choice. They haven&apos;t been told clearly by authorities and their physicians that they have a choice to get well and enjoy life without serious illness and the real threat of an early death. Watered down, ineffective advice sells out every person hoping for life-saving answers and real help. Giving people what is socially and politically acceptable, rather than what works, causes millions to die needlessly.

I have seen people violently reject this information. This is a physical manifestation of a subconscious process. Our brains are designed to dim awareness to information that causes us anxiety; information that would require people to take action and make changes in their lives. Almost any change can be anxiety provoking. Some people may fear the loss of some beloved food, rejection of their peers or some other irrational consequence. In response, to these subconscious objections many people will chose to ignore or degrade the importance of this message. This may be even more apparent in people who don&apos;t think they have imminent health issues. Don&apos;t let this happen to you.

Unhealthy foods are a slow-working poison. Many ailments related to food take years to develop; these ailments often won&apos;t display visible symptoms until they are well advanced. The only visible issue for most people is their excess weight.

Studies have shown that most overweight people routinely underestimate the extent of their obesity. They don&apos;t see themselves as overweight. Consequently, it is not too difficult to imagine how so many can ignore the evidence. They don&apos;t see what it has to do with them.

People do the same with their heart disease risk factors. They ignore the threat upon their lives from high cholesterol and they don&apos;t act to protect their lives, often until it is too late.

The decision to ignore this information happens on a subconscious level. A multitude of other diets promise weight loss and good health without changing the way you eat. This promise alone is enough to keep people from doing the work to change; it gives our subconscious minds a way out. The allure to the subconscious mind does not have to be logical, and when the mis-information about nutrition is popular or supported by a celebrity, all the more alluring.

The good news is that you do have control over your health and your weight. You are not at the mercy of your genes or your subconscious mind. And you do not have to get the diseases other Americans (including your doctor) do. Heart diseases, strokes, cancer, dementia, diabetes, allergies, arthritis, and other common illnesses are not predominantly genetic; rather they are the result of incorrect dietary choices.

Disease and a premature death are not inevitable. They are however the inevitable consequence of eating a disease-causing diet that Americans and other modern societies eat. We dig our graves with our knives and forks. On the other hand, we have an unprecedented opportunity in human history to use science to live longer and achieve health unobtainable by prior generations. We are only given one body in this lifetime, so take proper care of it. I urge you to become an example of excellent health which will encourage others to take your lead.

 Cold Weather, More Clothes, and Comfort Food 
 Posted on November 21, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese I once heard a chubby comedian say,“Men are like lasagna, we dress in layers.”And for a longtime this was my dress code; two layers of t-shirts, polo-shirt with t-shirt underneath, button-down shirt over t-shirt. Yup, I seldom left the house wearing only one layer. So you can imagine how much I dreaded the warmer summer months. How I’d yearn for winter!

But winter does have its drawbacks. Sure you can cover up those extra pounds with a little more clothing, but for many snuggling into a turtleneck and sweater, also means gobbling up more calorie-rich comfort food, especially around the holidays. Jane E. Brody of The New York Times insists this can be the beginning of a continuous weight-gaining cycle :
 Then there’s the coming holiday season, replete with the stress of too much to do, high-calorie temptations at every turn and, it seems, not enough time to expend those extra calories.


The inevitable result for many of us? A few extra pounds that we must struggle to lose when the weather warms up and the days get longer next spring. Unfortunately, though, too often those pounds remain, only to increase further the next winter, and the next, until they undermine our health as well as our psyche.
 For help preventing the cold weather weight-gain Brody enlists the aid of Dr. Michael D. Ozner, who as it turns out is a major advocate of the Mediterranean diet. Now, while you won’t hear Dr. Fuhrman singing the praises of Mediterranean diet anytime soon, Ozner does make a couple useful suggestions that might help you avoid winter/holiday weight-gain.

For starters, Ozner is not big on red meat, claiming it contains too much saturated fat , which can lead to an increased risk of cancer, heart attack, and stroke . He also encourages people to avoid processed foods because many of them are loaded with saturated fat , sugar, salt , trans fat , and high-fructose corn syrup . Dr. Fuhrman would definitely agree. Dr. Ozner’s recommendation to get plenty of exercise is another sound piece of advice. Although I can’t say the same for his tip about adding whey to food, according to Dr. Fuhrman whey isn’t exactly a wonder-food .

 Monkeying with Calorie Restriction 
 Posted on October 31, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese If you thought yesterday’s post about calorie restriction was interesting , you’ll love this report—it’s got monkeys! Everyone loves monkeys. Especially a healthy looking social monkey and an overweight lethargic grumpy one—the primate odd couple!

 The New York Times introduces us to Canto and Owen, two rhesus monkeys on totally different sides of the calorie restriction spectrum. Canto who eats 445 calories a day is healthier and much younger looking than his buddy Owen who consumes 885 calories daily— Owen doesn’t appear happy about it . Some scientists believe the plight of Canto and Owen sheds serious light on the benefits of calorie restriction for humans . Michael Mason reports:
 Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have been tracking the health of small groups of calorie-restricted dieters. Earlier this year, they reported that the dieters had better-functioning hearts and fewer signs of inflammation, which is a precursor to clogged arteries, than similar subjects on regular diets.

In previous studies, people in calorie-restricted groups were shown to have lower levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, and triglycerides. They also showed higher levels of HDL, the so-called good cholesterol, virtually no arterial blockage and, like Mr. Linksvayer, remarkably low blood pressure.

“Calorie restriction has a powerful, protective effect against diseases associated with aging,”said Dr. John O. Holloszy, a Washington University professor of medicine.“We don’t know how long each individual will end up living, but they certainly have a longer life expectancy than average.”

Researchers at Louisiana State University reported in April in The Journal of the American Medical Association that patients on an experimental low-calorie diet had lower insulin levels and body temperatures, both possible markers of longevity, and fewer signs of the chromosomal damage typically associated with aging.
 Anyone else want a pet rhesus monkey now?

 Health Points: Monday 
 Posted on October 23, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 You remember last month’s post about the infamous“freshmen fifteen?” Well it turns out it might not be the fifteen after all. According to Marilyn Marchione of the Associated Press it’s more like the freshmen five or seven : 
 Doctors say it is good news that the number of pounds gained is less than the widely believed 15, but bad news that&quot;Generation XL&quot;kids seem to be learning patterns of gradual weight gain that could spell trouble way beyond graduation.
 
 Okay fellow gym rats, how many of you get stiff or sore from working out? It certainly happens to me from time to time. Jeannine Stein of The Los Angeles Times explains the right stretches can help get you right : 
 Your stiffness and soreness might be due to the fact that although weight-lifting increases the size of the muscle, it does nothing to make the muscles more flexible, according to Suzanne Martin, an Alameda-based physical therapist, Pilates instructor and author of the book&quot;Stretching.&quot;For that, you need to stretch.
 
 Man, the PR people for trans fat got some work to do. The news is never good—rightfully so of course. Naila Moreira of The Boston Globe takes a look at the costly debate surrounding replacing trans fats : 
 But a now-ponderous stack of research has shown that trans fats raise heart disease risk four to five times more sharply than do saturated fats. Trans fats both raise&quot;bad&quot;cholesterol, or LDL, and cause&quot;good&quot;cholesterol, or HDL, to drop, while saturated fats only raise LDL. Moreover, trans fats are linked to ailments such as diabetes and dementia, said Walter Willett, chairman of the department of nutrition at Harvard University&apos;s School of Public Health.
 
 Wait, macaroni and cheese aren’t good for you? Virginie Montet of the AFP reports poor nutrition and lack of exercise are just two of the factors why U.S. children are overweight : 
 Scientists pointed to numerous factors that contribute to 32.7 percent of boys under 10 and 27.8 percent of girls being overweight: massive portions at meals, the&quot;energy density&quot;-- calories per gram -- of food eaten, children being drive rather than walking to school, and ethnic group, among others.
 
 Last week the AFP reported that obesity has seriously fattened up Australia’s health budget . Well, surprise-surprise America’s budget isn’t faring to well either. Take a look at what the AFP is now reporting: 
 Obesity -- which affects one in every three Americans -- and the illnesses associated with it cost the United States some 90.7 billion dollars a year in health care costs, a University of Pennsylvania researcher said.
 
 I don’t think this will alarm too many Eat to Livers, but we have an egg salad crisis . The Associated Press reports suspected contamination caused a particular brand to be recalled from seventeen states: 
 Ballard&apos;s President David Ballard said the company has temporarily suspended producing egg salad while it investigates the contamination. Consumers can return the 12-ounce containers of egg salad for a refund.
 
 One thing’s for sure, news about obesity is never good. Research shows obese post-menopausal women have an increased risk of breast cancer . Virginie Montet of the AFP reports: 
 &quot;There is an overwhelming number of studies that show a link between obesity and breast cancer,&quot;Cheryl Rock of the University of California, San Diego said at the annual conference of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO).

 Dramatic Reversal of Heart Disease 
 Posted on September 11, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman From the May 2006 edition of Dr. Fuhrman’s Healthy Times : 

Dramatic reversal of atherosclerotic heart disease is the norm in my medical practice. Not a week goes by when I do not see a patient whose heart problems, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels have normalized. The results I see are so effective because my recommendations are ideal for maximizing human longevity. The following stories show the power of diet and lifestyle changes.

 John Pawlikowski 
John recently returned to my office for a routine follow-up visit. He is now 84 years old and in excellent health. His cholesterol level is 142 with an HDL of 86. He is 5’10”, weighs 152 pounds, and he is muscular and fit.

He is a dramatically different man from the one who walked into my office 13 years ago suffering from advanced heart disease. At that point in his life, John was facing a major health crisis. Based on chest pains and the abnormal results of a stress test and cardiac catherization, he had been advised to undergo bypass surgery immediately.

I assured him that if he did exactly what I asked of him, his heart disease would melt away rapidly, and he would live a long life—free of heart disease—without the interference and intervention of cardiac surgeons and cardiologists.

In a few weeks, John’s chest pains lessened, and in a few months they disappeared. His cardiologist was so impressed with the results that he told John he no longer needed surgery and advised him to keep following my advice.

John lost about 60 pounds in the first year after coming to see me, and he has maintained his present weight for over 10 years. He has been free of any further heart problems, and he is on no medication. He has not had any medical problems in the past 13 years.

 Bruce Heimlich 
Bruce was not a patient of mine. He introduced himself after a lecture I gave in San Francisco, and we have corresponded since then. At the time, Bruce was 49 years old and weighed 225 pounds. He had tried many diets to lose weight, including the vegetarian one he was following when he found out that he had a significant blockage of his right carotid artery (ultrasound showed over 80 percent occlusion). Bruce read my book Eat to Live and decided not to undergo surgical treatment. Within one year, he lost 75 pounds. He repeated the test to evaluate the blockage in his carotid arteries, and the ultra-sonographer was shocked to see that no plaque or disease could be found. The atherosclerotic plaque obstructing the lumen of the blood vessels had disappeared completely.

 The Meat-Disease Connection 
 Posted on August 11, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Dr. Fuhrman’s position on the consumption of animal products is pretty clear, meat and diary dairy products leads to disease like heart disease and cancer. Even“healthy”choices like fish and chicken put you at risk. Take a look at this section from Eat to Live :
 There is a relationship between animal protein and heart disease. For example, plasma apolioprotein B is positively associated with animal-protein intake and inversely associated (lowered) with vegetable-protein intake (e.g., legumes and greens). Apolioprotein B levels correlate strongly with coronary heart disease.1 Unknown to many is that animal proteins have a significant effect on raising cholesterol levels as well, while plant protein lowers it.2

Scientific studies provide evidence that many animal protein’s effect on blood cholesterol may be significant. This is one of the reasons those switching to a low fat-diet do no experience the cholesterol lowering they expect unless they also remove the low-fat animal products as well. Surprising to most people is that yes, even low-fat dairy and skinless white-meat chicken raise cholesterol. I see this regularly in my practice. Many individuals do not see the dramatic drop in cholesterol levels unless they go all the way by cutting all animal proteins from their diet.
 According to Dr. Fuhrman white meats are no savior either:
 Red met is not the only problem. The consumption of chicken and fish is also linked to colon cancer. A large recent study examined the eating habits of 32,000 adults for six years and then watched the incidence of cancer for these subjects over the next six years. Those who avoided red meat but at white meat regularly had a more than 300 percent increase in colon cancer incidence.3 The same study showed that eating beans, peas, or lentils, at least twice a week was associated with a 50 percent lower risk than never eating these foods.

Chicken has about the same amount of cholesterol as beef, and the production of those potent cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are even more concentrated in grilled chicken than in beef.4 Another recent study from New Zealand that investigated heterocyclic amines in meat, fish, and chicken found the greatest contributor of HCAs to cancer risk was chicken.5 Likewise, studies indicated that chicken is almost as dangerous as red meat for the heart. Regarding cholesterol, there is no advantage to eating lean white instead of lean red meat.6
 The correlation between disease and consumption of animal products seems very clear. Even newer research warns of heighten stomach cancer risk associated with eating processed meats, like sausage, smoked ham, and bacon . Reuters reports:
 A review of 15 studies showed the risk of developing stomach cancer rose by 15 to 38 percent if consumption of processed meats increased by 30 grams (1 ounce) per day, the Karolinska Institute said in a statement.
 These foods possess cancer-causing additives outside of meat’s normal cancer-causing agents:
 The institute said processed meats were often salted or smoked, or had nitrates added to them, in order to extend their shelf-life which could be connected to the increased risk of stomach cancer, the fourth most common type of cancer.
 If this information spooked you, you might want to consider Dr. Fuhrman’s advice,“The best bet for overall health is significantly limit or eliminated all types of meat—red and white.”

 Health Points: Wednesday 
 Posted on August 9, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 This is kind of a no-brainer, but as Marilynn Marchione of the Associate Press reports sugary drinks have helped bloat American waistlines : 
 An extra can of soda a day can pile on 15 pounds in a single year, and the&quot;weight of evidence&quot;strongly suggests that this sort of increased consumption is a key reason that more people have gained weight, the researchers say.

&quot;We tried to look at the big picture rather than individual studies,&quot;and it clearly justifies public health efforts to limit sugar-sweetened beverages, said Dr. Frank Hu, who led the report published Tuesday in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
 
 UroStream reflects on how good it feels when patients trust their surgeon : 
 Patients must be able to trust their surgeon. Lest you trust your surgeon completely, you should not allow her/him to approach you with a scalpel. That has been my personal policy, though I concede that I have never required any surgery yet. Patients meet me, talk to me, discuss medical issues with me, and I formulate a plan that sometimes involves surgery. And when the patients agree, there are brief moments when I am amazed that they will trust me to operate on them. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I don&apos;t doubt my abilities (I even admit to being secretly quite proud of my skills), but I find this trust almost overwhelming.
 
 Health Check Blog relays a study explaining the importance of a healthy diet and exercise for preventing Alzheimer&apos;s disease : 
 Exercise regularly, eat fruits and vegetables, control your blood pressure and lower your cholesterol. It may sound like a prescription for avoiding heart disease, but this checklist also serves as a guide for preventing Alzheimer&apos;s. According to a new study out of Sweden, people can gauge their risk for the brain-wasting condition by their lifestyle habits in middle age.
 
 Take a look at the trailer for the new movie Fast Food Nation . For more on the movie check out this previous post: One Nation Under Big Macs 

 If you’ve ever been interested in a pet parasite read this Jewish fishworm story . Larry Zaroff of The New York Times explains: 
 Enter Dr. Earl Lipman, a close friend of Bob’s and an outstanding internist and diagnostician, who identified the culprit over the phone.

Earl asked,“Does Rita make her own gefilte fish?”

“Yes.”

“Does she ever taste the raw fish before adding salt?”Earl continued.

“Yes.”

“She most likely has a fish tapeworm.”

The fish tapeworm—a beast, stubborn as a dog with a beef bone—is reluctant to move, tightly gripping the wall of the small intestine with its two suction cups. The worm requires a powerful purging medicine to persuade it to leave its cozy cave and exit the gut into the light.

 Fatty Facts 
 Posted on July 28, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman From Dr. Fuhrman’s book Disease Proof Your Child: 

 Saturated fat has the most powerful causative relationship with heart disease and cancer. Besides sugar, butter and cheese contribute the most calories to children’s diets in America. The food with the highest saturated fat content in the American diet is butter and cheese. 
Cheese consumption has tripled in American in the last thirty years, and cheese is included as part of almost every meal. It’s melted on burgers and chicken breasts, sprinkled on salads melted over bread and pasta. It’s not surprising that cheese gives us more (artery-clogging) saturated fat than any other food.

Heart disease begins in our youth and is not easy to reverse. No one should eat more than five grams of saturated fat a day. Over this level, disease rates climb.

All food derived from animals contain cholesterol and tend to be high in the thick, heavy fats called saturated fats. Most plant foods are very low in saturated fat, except for some tropical plant oils like palm and coconut oil that are naturally saturated.

Reducing the consumption of animal foods reduces the consumption of cholesterol and saturated fat. Low intake of cholesterol and saturated fat leads to a leaner body, clean arteries, and reducing risk of developing heart disease and many other diet-related diseases such as stroke, breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, and obesity.

 Treating Diabetes: Scientists Warming To Plant-Based Diet 
 Posted on July 27, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese Dr. Fuhrman advocates a plant-based diet because it is the most optimal diet-style for diabetes reversal , weight-loss , and the prevention of heart disease . Sally Squires of The Washington Post explains many scientists are beginning to acknowledge its superior advantages as well :
 People with Type 2 diabetes are advised to limit carbohydrates because of worries that too many carbs could overtax the body&apos;s dwindling insulin production and lessen its ability to process glucose.

Now some scientists are asking if a very-low-fat diet rich in healthy carbohydrates—whole grains, beans, fruit and vegetables—might be another option.
 This prompted scientists to conduct a study comparing the standard dietary advice from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the vegetable-based diet-style of Dr. Dean Ornish:
 The four-month trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health, studied 99 people with Type 2 diabetes. Half were asked to follow the standard dietary advice from the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The other half were asked to adhere to a very strict, low-fat vegan diet devoid of meat, fish, eggs, dairy or any other animal products.

Both groups improved blood sugar control and LDL cholesterol levels. Both lost weight, but the vegan group shed an average of 15 pounds, compared with six for the ADA group. As in the Ornish study, the vegan group showed no harmful changes in either HDL or triglyceride levels.
 The results of the study demonstrate the overall efficiency and effectiveness of a“vegan”or a plant-based diet. Additionally 20 percent of participants following the vegetable-based diet for a year were able to cut or eliminate their insulin and other glucose-lowering medication.

Squires concludes her report with these three recommendations for those trying to overcome diabetes through diet: 
 Eat more plant-based foods. The more variety, the better. Groups that recommend eating more beans, vegetables (without added fat), fruit (sans added sugar) and whole grains include the American Heart Association, the National Cancer Institute, the Institute of Medicine, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the American Diabetes Association, the American Cancer Society and the American Institute for Cancer Research.

 Easy on the fat. Gram for gram, fat contains more than twice the calories of protein or carbs. Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for diabetes, heart disease and some types of cancer. Whatever fat you eat, make it healthy. Skip saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol found in whole milk dairy products, fatty meat and poultry with the skin. Reach instead for fish, healthy oil such as canola or olive oil, healthy margarine, nuts, avocados and seeds.
 
Get plenty of exercise. The Diabetes Prevention Program—a large federally funded study of people who were just a step shy of developing diabetes—found that brisk daily exercise (yes, walking is fine) played an important part in preventing diabetes. The study found 30 minutes daily was required, but that can be broken into 10-minute increments.

 American Heart Association Recommendations Are Dangerous 
 Posted on June 28, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 From Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Eat to Live : 

The typical dietary advice, represented by the American Heart Association&apos;s guidelines, is still a dangerous diet. It is not likely to protect you from having a heart attack and does not allow heart disease to reverse itself. Moderation kills. The fact is that such dietary advice still allows heart disease to advance in the overwhelming majority of patients.

 WARNING: Do not merely comply with these overly permissive recommendations of the American Heart Association, or you will most likely die of a heart attack. 

 Total fat intake should be restricted to no more than 30 percent of total calories. Cholesterol intake should be less than 200 mg daily. Salt intake should not exceed six grams of sodium chloride daily. 


Just to highlight a small difference between the American Heart Association guidelines and my recommendations: My diet have lass than 300 mg of cholesterol and six grams of sodium chloride per week! More than a dozen studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with coronary artery disease who follow an American Heart Association step one or step two diet have their condition worsen.1 No study has ever shown that the patients who follow an American Heart Association diet can reverse or stop worsening of coronary artery disease.

In contrast, numerous studies have documented that heart disease is reversible for the majority of patients following a vegetarian diet.2 Most often diets, such as the Ornish program, are no even optimal diets, as they do not sufficiently limit processed grains, salt, and other low-nutrient-density processed foods. Nevertheless, they are still effective for most patients.

The medical literature continues to refer to the diet recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program as &quot;low-fat.&quot; By worldwide standards it should be called a high-fad diet, but more important, it should be called a low-nutrient-density-diet--one with a dangerously low level of plant-derived nutrients. As a result of following this almost worthless advice, heart disease patients usually eat a diet that derives over 80 percent of its calories from processed foods and animal products.

No matter how poor patients&apos; diet, most claim that they are already on a low-fat diet. They believe that eating a chicken-and-pasta-based diet is in some way healthy merely because they eat less red meat. Yet chicken is almost as dangerous for the heart as red meat; switching from red meat to white meat does not lower cholesterol.3 Such conventional diets simply do not lower cholesterol sufficiently and do no contain adequate heart-protective factors such as fiber, antioxidants, folate, bioflavonoids, and other phytochemicals.

Another real problem with these so-called low-fat diets is that they are often low in fiber and phytochemical-rich vegetation and may not be carefully designed to include enough of the cardioprotective fats. For example, multiple studies have shown the protective effects of consuming walnuts, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. A study of 34,192 Californian Seventh-Day Adventists showed a 31 percent reduction in the lifetime risk of ischemic heart disease in those who consumed raw nuts frequently.4The ideal diet for heart disease reversal, then, is free of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol; rich in nutrients and fiber; and low in calories, to achieve thinness. However, it should contain sufficient essential fatty acids, so it is important to add a small amount of nuts and seeds, such as walnuts and flaxseed.

 Vegetables Deliver Protein with Micronutrients 
 Posted on June 26, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 From Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Disease Proof Your Child : 

When you eat to maximize micronutrients, your body function will improve; chronic illnesses like high blood pressure, Type II diabetes, and high cholesterol will likely disappear; and your youthful vigor will last into old age. Heart disease and cancer, the major killers of modern societies, would fade away and be exceedingly rare occurrences if the population adopted a cancer-preventive diet style and lifestyle. And we would hardly ever see any overweight children.

Maintaining a population of normal-weight individuals can be efficiently accomplished only by eating more high-nutrient foods, foods with higher nutrient-per-calorie ratio. The foods with the most nutrients per calorie are vegetables and beans. Vegetables are also very rich in protein and calcium. Most vegetables have more protein per calorie than meat and more calcium per calorie than milk. Nobody can consume too little protein by eating less animal products and substituting vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds.

The focus on the importance of protein in the diet is one of the major reasons we have been led down the wrong path to dietary suicide. We were taught to equate protein with good nutrition and have though animal products, not vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, are our best source of protein. We bought a false bill of goods, and the dairy-and-meat-heavy diet brought fourth a heart attack and cancer epidemic.

If we hear something over and over since we were young children, we just accept it as true. For example, it is myth repeated over and over that plant proteins are &quot;incomplete&quot; and need to be &quot;complemented&quot; for adequate protein. In fact, all vegetables and grains contain all eight of the essential amino acids (as well as the 12 other nonessential ones).1 While some vegetables have higher or lower proportions of certain amino acids than others, when eaten in amounts to satisfy one&apos;s caloric needs, a sufficient amount of all essential amino acids are provided. Because digestive secretions and sloughed-off mucosal cells are constantly recycled and reabsorbed, the amino acid composition in the bloodstream after meals is remarkably complete in spite of short-term irregularities in their dietary supply.

It is interesting to note that peas, green vegetables, and beans have more protein per calorie than meat. But what is not generally considered is that foods that are rich in plant protein are generally the foods that are richest in nutrients and phytochemicals. By eating more of these high-nutrient, low calorie foods we get plenty of protein, and our bodies get flooded with protective micronutrients simultaneously. Animal protein does not contain antioxidants and phtyochemicals, plant protein does. Plus, animal protein is married to saturated fat, the most dangerous type of fat.


 Protein Content From Selected Plant Foods Food Grams of Protein Almonds (3 oz) 10 Banana 1.2 Broccoli (2 cups) 10 Brown Rice (1 cup) 5 Chickpeas (1 cup) 15 Corn (1 cup) 4.2 Lentils (1 cup) 18 Peas--frozen (1 cup) 9 Spinach--frozen (1 cup) 7 Tofu (4 ounces) 11 Whole wheat bread (2 slices) 5 



Even a professional body builder who wants to build one-half pound of extra muscle per week only needs about an extra seven grams per day over a normal protein intake. No Complicated formulas or protein supplements are needed to get sufficient protein for growth, even in the serious athlete. Exercise increases hunger, and as the athlete consumes more calories to meet the demands of exercise, they will naturally get the extra protein they need. Many world-class athletes thrive at world-class competitions on vegetarian and vegan diets.

When you reduce or eliminate animal protein intake and increase vegetable protein intake, you lower cholesterol radically. Vegetables, beans, and nuts and seeds are all rich in protein, and they also have no saturated fat or cholesterol. But the clincher is that they are higher in nutrients than any other foods. We must structure our diets around the foods that supply the most micronutrients.

The cholesterol-lowering effects of vegetables and beans (high protein foods) are without question. When adult subjects are feed a vegetable-based diet, cholesterol levels drop radically, much more than with the most powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs.2 These foods also contain an assortment of heart disease-fighting nutrients independent of their ability to lower cholesterol, and they fight cancer, too.

 Eat to Live: Knowledge Motivates Change 
 Posted on June 22, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 Adapted from Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection For Life : 

When I began my medical practice as a specialist in nutrition, I focused my attention on individuals who were looking for nutritional intervention as a means of reversing their medical conditions to recover their health and avoid taking medication or having invasive surgery. The inevitable outcome was that when my patients were committed to superior health through nutritional excellence, they were able to reduce and eventually stop their dependency on medications for high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and a host of other conditions. Spectacular disease reversals were the norm, not the exception.

I found that when people ate a diet comprised of the most nutritious and powerful &quot;anti-cancer&quot; plant foods their cholesterol dropped more powerfully than it could from the typical cholesterol-lowering medication. Their diabetes went away. I soon said, &quot;Let&apos;s not just treat your diabetes and control it. Let&apos;s get rid of it and make you non-diabetic.&quot;

The focus was never on caloric restriction; rather, it was on eating more high nutrient food, and as a result, eating less of everything else that was not a high nutrient food.

Besides reversing chronic disease and preventing heart disease and cancer, I found that my patients were able to reach their ideal weight with ease. No calorie counting, no complicated formulas, pills or unfulfilled promises. The basic plan is simple: just take the healthiest foods and make them taste great and eat as much as desired. My patients dropped the weight they could not lose before, and they achieved these results relatively quickly.

The traditional viewpoint is often stated that if you lose your weight too rapidly it won&apos;t stick and you will gain it all back. I have never advocated that people be in a race to lose their excess weight. I see no reason, however, to eat unhealthy foods or to eat when you are not hungry under some notion that losing weight slower would be better. The reality is that your body just drops its unhealthy weight relatively quickly and naturally when you eat so well under the Eat to Live program.

The permanence of the results can be attributed to the fact that the program is knowledge-based. Knowledge motivates the change, not willpower. The Eat to Live diet-style supplies spectacular results in the weight loss arena that are permanent because once a person becomes a nutritional expert and experiences the results, they Eat to Live forever. The secret is to gain the education first. You must do the work; read Eat to Live , or gain the knowledge on line from my membership services, but you must study and understand the science. If the preponderance of evidence and logic does not make perfect sense to you, don&apos;t do it. The more you learn, the easier it becomes to eat this way for the rest of your life.

 The Glossary of Cholesterol 
 Posted on June 20, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 From Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection For Life : 

 FATS 
Fat is one of the three macronutrients (along with protein and carbohydrate) that supply calories to the body. Fats provide 9 calories per gram, more than twice the number provided by carbohydrates or protein.

Fats provide the &quot;essential&quot; fatty acids, which are not made by the body and must be obtained from food. Fatty acids provide the raw materials that help control blood pressure, blood clotting, inflammation and other important body functions.

Fat is essential for the proper functioning of the body. Healthy skin and hair are maintained by fat. Fat helps in the absorption and transport through the bloodstream of the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Fats perform vital and valuable role in the body. For example, fats:

 Are a part of all cell membranes. Make up part of the material that insulates nerves and increases the efficiency of nerve conduction. Make up an integral part of certain hormones that regulate blood pressure, clotting and inflammation. Are the major component of brain tissue and are necessary for emotional well being. The energy or calories that one consumes in excess of the body&apos;s needs is mainly stored as fat (adipose). Eating too much fat, just like eating too much carbohydrate and too much protein (the three sources of calories), can lead to excessive storage of body fat, weight gain and obesity. Too much fat, as well as too many calories in general contribute to coronary artery disease and other heart-related problems. 

Like certain vitamins and minerals, there are also certain fats that are essential to humans. Eliminating fat completely from one&apos;s diet can lead to an essential fatty acids deficiency with negative health consequences. Therefore, a heart-healthy diet should aim to include dietary fats in a balance with other nutrients to provide essential fatty acids to meet daily energy needs and other metabolic needs of the body. Emphasis should be placed on minimizing or eliminating saturated fat and trans fat intake.

 SATURATED FAT 
Some naturally occurring fats are called saturated because all the carbon atoms are single bonds. These fats are solid at room temperature and generally recognized as a significant cause of both heart disease and cancer. Saturated fats are found mainly in meat, fowl, eggs, and dairy. The foods with the most saturated fat are butter, cream, and cheese.

Saturated fat raises your LDL-cholesterol level more than anything else in the diet. Eating too much saturated fat and cholesterol is the main reason for the high number of heart attacks seen in North America and other countries.

 UNSATURATED FAT 
These fats are a mix of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. Eating unsaturated fats lowers cholesterol when substituted for saturated fats, but excessive amounts may promote cancer and obesity. Examples of unsaturated fats are the fats in nuts and seeds such as flax seeds, sunflower seeds, macadamia and pistachio nuts, almonds, walnuts, cashews, as well as avocados and olives.

 POLYUNSATURATED FATS 
Are fats with more than one double bond in the carbon chain. Like monounsaturated fat, these natural fats are also found in their natural state in raw seeds such as sesame, sunflower as well as in corn and soybeans and are essential for normal body development and function.

 MONOUNSATURATED FATS 
Are fats with only one double bond in the carbon chain. They are liquid at room temperature and thought to have health benefits. The supposed health benefits of these fats appear when these fats are used in place of dangerous saturated fats. Monounsaturated fat is found in avocados, olives, almonds, peanuts, and most other nuts.

 HYDROGENATED FAT 
Hydrogenation is a process of adding hydrogen molecules to unsaturated fats which makes plant oils that are liquid at room temperature, solidify. An example is margarine. These fats are also called TRANS FATS. The hardening of the fat extends its shelf life so that the oil can by used over and over again to fry potatoes in a fast food restaurant or be added to processed foods, such as crackers and cookies. While hydrogenation does not make the fat completely saturated, it creates trans-fatty acids, which act like saturated fats. These fats raise cholesterol and increasing evidence is accumulating demonstrating the harmful nature of these man-made fats and their relation to both cancer and heart disease. Avoid all foods whose ingredients contain partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils.

 CHOLESTEROL 
Cholesterol is a waxy fat produced by the body and found in animal foods such as meat, fowl, dairy, and eggs. Eating cholesterol does raise blood cholesterol, but ironically not as much as eating saturated fats and trans fats. The amount of cholesterol in plants is so negligible that you should consider them cholesterol free.

 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) 
LDL cholesterol is the bad guy that promotes the plaque that leads to blockages and heart attacks. Thus, the more LDL-cholesterol you have in your blood, the greater your risk of heart disease.

 HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) 
HDL cholesterol is the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol and carries cholesterol back to the liver for removal from the body. So a higher HDL helps keep cholesterol from building up in the walls of the arteries. Individuals with a total cholesterol/HDL ratio above 4 are considered to have an exceptionally high risk of heart disease. So, the higher your HDL-cholesterol, the better. However, those with exceptionally low LDL cholesterol do not have to worry about their HDL level. You don&apos;t need the garbage collectors when there is no garbage.

 DHA FAT 
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long chain omega 3 fat that is made by the body, but can also be found in algae and fish, such as salmon and sardines. DHA is used in the production of anti-inflammatory mediators that inhibit abnormal immune function and prevents excessive blood clotting. DHA is not considered an essential fat because the body can manufacture sufficient amounts if adequate short chain omega-3 fats are consumed (flax, walnuts, soybeans, leafy green vegetables). However, because of genetic differences in the enzyme activity and because of excess omega-6 fats, many people, who do not consume fish regularly, are deficient in this important fat.

 ARACHADONIC ACID (AA) 
AA is a long chain omega 6 fat produced by the body, but also found in meat, fowl, dairy and eggs. Products formed from excessive amounts of this fatty acid have the potential to increase inflammation and are disease-causing. They may increase blood pressure, thrombosis, vasospasm, and allergic reaction. They are linked to arthritis, depression, and other common illnesses.

 TRIGLYCERIDES 
Triglycerides comprise the largest proportion of fats (lipids) in the diet, in the adipose tissue, and in the blood. Immediately after a fatty meal, triglycerides rise in the bloodstream. We store triglycerides in our fatty tissues and muscle as a source of energy, and gradually release and metabolize it between meals according to the energy needs of the body. Only a small portion of your triglycerides is found in the bloodstream. High blood triglyceride levels are reflective of increased body fat stores. High triglycerides further promote and contribute to atherosclerosis in people with high cholesterol.

 Veggies Protect Your Heart 
 Posted on June 19, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
Dr. Fuhrman contends a vegetable-based nutrient-dense diet is essential for protecting against and reversing heart disease. In Cholesterol Protection for Life Dr. Fuhrman advises people to center their diets on health promoting foods and to limit staples of the typical American diet:
 Vegetables, beans, fruits, nuts and seeds are nature&apos;s nutrient-rich natural foods. Your meals need to revolve around these foods, not grains, oils or animal products.

Limit the amount of processed foods, refined breads, and pastapreferably to not more than once a week. 

The health protective effects of vegetables are exemplified in a new study published in the July issue of the Journal of Nutrition . Mice fed a vegetable-rich diet received a 38 percent reduction in atherosclerosis risk. Kathleen Doheny of HealthDay News reports:
 After 16 weeks, they assessed the animals&apos; health and found those who ate the vegetable-rich diet had lower total cholesterol levels, lower levels of the so-called &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a 7 percent lower average body weight.

&quot;The mice who consumed 30 percent of their diet as vegetables developed atherosclerotic plaques that were 38 percent smaller than those of the mice who consumed no vegetables,&quot; Michael Adams, a professor of pathology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine said. 

Researchers believe this has strong implications for human health as well:
 The study is &quot;interesting and encouraging,&quot; said Alice Lichtenstein, director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Lab and Gershoff Professor of Nutrition Science and Policy at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center, Tufts University, Boston, and chair of the nutrition committee for the American Heart Association.

&quot;The observation has been made in humans that people who eat fruits and vegetables have less coronary artery disease and less heart disease,&quot; she said. But to her knowledge, no one knows the mechanism.

&quot;It may be a direct effect, or people eating a lot of fruits and vegetables may have a diet [that is also] healthy in other ways.&quot;

As for advice, Adams said boosting vegetable and fruit intake is always wise. &quot;The average consumption in this country of green and yellow vegetables and of fruits is two to three servings a day. If people just ate 2 or 3 more servings a day, odds are they would be much healthier for it.&quot; 

This isn&apos;t the first time health professionals have noted the advantages of a diet rich in unrefined plant matter. In Eat to Live Dr. Fuhrman explains numerous authorities have already cited the benefits of high intake of fruits and vegetables:
 After years of examining the accumulating evidence, eight top health organizations joined forces and agreed encourage Americans to eat more unrefined plant food and less food from animal sources, as revealed in the new dietary guidelines published in the July 27, 1999, Journal of the American Heart Association. These authorities are the Nutrition Committee of the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, the American Dietetic Association, the Division of Nutrition Research of the National Institutes of Health, and the American Society for Clinical Nutrition.

Their unified guidelines are a giant step in the right direction. Their aim is to offer protection against the major chronic diseases in America, including heart disease and cancer. &quot;The emphasis is on eating a variety of foods, mostly fruits and vegetables, with very little simple sugar or high-fat foods, especially animal foods,&quot; said Abby Bloch, Ph.D., R.D., chair of the American Cancer Society. Based on a culmination of years of research, these health experts&apos; conclusion was that animal-source foods, with their high levels of saturated fat, are one of the leading causes of heart disease, cancer, strokes, diabetics, obesity, etc.all the major chronic diseases that cost 1.4 million Americans their lives each year (more than two-thirds of all deaths in the United States).

 Lower Cholesterol Radically 
 Posted on June 16, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 From the revised version of Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection for Life , now available! 

We know that populations worldwide with very low cholesterol simply do not have heart attacks. For example, in rural China where the average total cholesterol was found to be 127 and very little animal foods are consumed, less than 5% of the population suffered from heart attacks. These findings, from the China Project, suggest that even small intakes of foods of animal origin are associated with significant increases in plasma cholesterol concentration, which are associated, in turn, with significant increases in heart disease mortality rates.1

By comparison, in the United States more than 40 percent of the population dies of heart attacks. It is a simple fact that if you eat American-style food you will die an American-style death. Don&apos;t expect to escape from the biological laws of cause and effect. The Standard American diet is also responsible for our relentless epidemic of obesity and cancer. This book is all about taking charge of our own health destiny through excellent nutrition and not waiting helplessly until a major disease strikes.

In the famous Framingham study, 35 percent of heart disease occurred in those with total cholesterol levels in the range of 150 to 200 mg/dl, but no heart disease deaths occurred in those whose total cholesterol levels were below 150 mg/dl.2

Multiple dietary intervention trials have taken place in our country with diets suggested by the American Heart Association that only offer small improvements over what Americans usually eat. These moderate, politically-correct dietary recommendations have failed to show substantial benefits. Therefore, most medical authorities and physicians place no importance on dietary modifications and instead rely almost exclusively on medications since the &quot;typical&quot; dietary recommendations do not lower cholesterol effectively. Certainly, the &quot;ideal&quot; cardio-protective cholesterol ranges cannot be achieved with traditional dietary recommendations.

The vast majority of people are not aware that the proper diet can heart-attack-proof their body. They do not know that there is a more effective option than the American Heart Association&apos;s dietary guidelines. I have no problem with people choosing to eat a diet that places them at risk of heart disease, or people choosing to smoke or to not exercise, that is their right. However, at the very least they should be correctly informed of the dangers of their choices and not have doctors, dieticians and health authorities let them think they are doing all they can to protect themselves.

Unfortunately, economic and political forces make it difficult for Americans to be clearly informed that heart disease is nutritionally-induced by our outmoded and incorrect dietary model. For example, six of the eleven members, including the chairman, of the USDA&apos;s Dietary Guidelines Committee in the year 2000 had financial ties to the meat, dairy, and egg industries. Not surprisingly, the foods these industries produce figure prominently in government dietary recommendations in spite of their documented links to increased health risks. Similar problems exist in recommendations by non-profit health organizations who receive funding from industry. Sadly, even the American Heart Association advocates a diet that actually has been shown to increase heart disease.3 The researchers concluded that &quot;the response to the AHA diet is too small to have any value in the clinical management of adults with high cholesterol&quot;

Another problem is that in America, we have been told that compared to the standard American diet, the Mediterranean diet lowers heart disease risk about 30 percent, the Asian diet lowers heart disease risk about 35 percent and the Polynesian diet lowers heart disease risk and so on. I am not satisfied with just reducing my risk somewhat. I want more for myself, my family, and my patients.

My point of view is this--let&apos;s use modern nutritional science to the fullest extent and not be satisfied with reducing our risk by 20 to 50 percent; let&apos;s reduce our risk by as close to 100 percent as possible. It is possible for you to live a long life with your intellect intact until an uneventful death, without strokes, heart attacks, cancer or dementia. Only nutritional excellence, not drugs can offer all these protective features.

In this day and age, we can use the best features of diets from around the world, and we can use a variety of great-tasting regional recipes. If we understand the precise qualities of each of these diets that account for the benefits and avoid the worthless parts, we can get radically better results. The fact is, every heart disease death is a tragedy, because it simply did not have to happen.

 Dr. Fuhrman Discusses Cholesterol Protection for Life 
 Posted on June 15, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 Dr. Fuhrman talks about the new edition of his book Cholesterol Protection for Life , now available! 

 Cholesterol Protection for Life is based on clinically proven natural methods. The results seen in my medical practice with these methods have been reproduced by scientific studies and reported in peer-reviewed medical journals as well. My goal is to enable you to achieve the recommended cardiac protective cholesterol levels, while eating delicious food, and enjoying life without a dependence on medications. The approach is two-fold: Combine the most powerful dietary program with the strongest natural cholesterol reducers.

First, I have developed an eating plan that is described in this book that will dramatically lower your cholesterol. This nutritional information provides the education to take control of your health. My dietary program, also explained in greater depth in Eat To Live , provides a formula that has been adapted for thousands to:

 Lower cholesterol Lose weight Boost immune function Lower high blood pressure Reverse Adult Onset (Type 2) Diabetes Achieve normal bowel function Reverse and prevent autoimmune diseases Maintain one&apos;s youthful vigor and age slower 

The second part of the Cholesterol Protection for Life plan describes nutritional supplements that can add to the cholesterol lowering effect of the right diet. I usually combine a few natural cholesterol-lowering substances with many of my patients who do not find that dietary excellence is sufficient to bring their cholesterol levels down to the most favorable range.

If you follow my dietary recommendations and also take the recommended natural cholesterol-lowering agents, you will see a huge difference in your cholesterol levels after just one month. Then, as time progresses, you will continue to see further improvement. Regular exercise (always discuss your exercise plan with your physician) can provide additional benefits to you.

The health benefits from implementing Cholesterol Protection for Life can start now--if you begin both parts of this program today.

Having a truly protective cholesterol level that will keep heart disease away is within your control. Please let me know about your results.

 Lower Your Cholesterol Naturally 
 Posted on June 13, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 Adapted from the revised version of Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection for Life , now available! 

There are literally hundreds of respected scientific studies that demonstrate that as animal products increase in a population&apos;s diet, cholesterol levels soar and the occurrence of heart disease increases proportionally with the increase in animal product intake.1 Saturated fat is the element of the modern diet that shows the most powerful association in these medical research studies with high cholesterol and premature death from heart attacks.2

Though saturated fat is the most heart-disease-promoting substance in animal products, it is not merely saturated fat and cholesterol in animal products that is the problem. Animal protein raises cholesterol too. Those who cut out red meat and instead eat plenty of chicken and fish do not see substantial changes in their cholesterol levels or a profound reduction in cardiac events.3

If you are looking for maximum protection from heart disease, your diet must receive 90 to 100 percent of its calories from unrefined plant foods. If you choose to include a small amount of animal products in your diet, white meat chicken and white meat turkey are better choices, but if you have more than one or two servings a week, you are not going to see optimal results. One serving of a non-polluted fish a week, and one serving of white meat fowl is the maximum amount of animal products permitted. Any more than that will prevent the huge drop in cholesterol level and heart disease risk observed from eating a plant-based diet style.

Books touting the benefits of high-protein diets for weight-loss are very popular because they appeal to the many Americans who are looking to maintain their addiction to high-fat, nutrient-inadequate, animal foods. These consumers form a huge market for such topsy-turvy, scientific-sounding quackery. All animal products are severely deficient in fiber, phytochemicals, and antioxidants--and contain too much saturated fat, cholesterol, and arachadonic acid.

As animal product consumption goes up in a country or population, so does heart attacks; as animal product utilization goes down, so does heart attacks. One cannot prevent or reverse heart disease while one continues to consume significant amounts of animal foods.

 IT IS BOTH THE HIGH CONSUMPTION OF REFINED FOODS AND THE HIGH CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL FOODS THAT RESULT IN SERIOUS DISEASES IN AMERICA AND OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. 

In some countries, such as Mozambique, the Fiji Islands, and Guatemala, where few refined foods are eaten and animal products account for less than 10% of the calories consumed, their populations are virtually free from heart disease.

 Guidelines to lower your cholesterol naturally that can save your life 

 Restrict or eliminate animal products: A few ounces of white meat turkey, once a week and a small piece of fish once a week is the maximum one should consume if seriously looking for cardiac reversal or protection and only these animal products, low in saturated fat should be eaten. If eating animal products, only eat 4-6 ounces of white meat turkey or white meat chicken per week, using them as a condiment in soups or a vegetable dish or sandwich. Low mercury fish such as tilapia, flounder, sole or scrod are also permitted in the range of 4-8 ounces per week. Non-fat dairy or an egg white omelet may also be consumed once per week.

 Eliminate all processed grains and sweeteners: No white flour, white rice, processed breakfast cereals, sugar or other sweeteners. Instead, use one serving of whole grains daily such as brown rice, millet amaranth, oats, and barley. If using pasta occasionally, use whole wheat, bean or lentil pasta, not white flour pasta.

 Do not use oil: Instead, use nuts and avocado to flavor dressings and sauces. Oil is a high calorie food, with the vast majority of nutrients lost. In comparison, the use of raw nuts and seeds such as flax, walnuts, and sunflower seeds have shown remarkable protective effects for both heart disease and cancer. When you consume your fat in nature&apos;s protective package, (nuts and seeds) in place of extracted oils, you get the lignins and flavonoids and other valuable nutrients that support excellent health.

For example, flax seed oil is also oil and just like other oils it contains 120 calories per tablespoon. Ground flax seeds contain lignans, flavonoids beneficial fibers, sterols and a host of other beneficial substances and only has 30 calories per tablespoon. Eat the food not the extracted oil. Excessive amounts of oil are not favorable. Even too much of the benefical oil in flax is linked to higher rates of prostate cancer.4

 Report: Adults Who Take Statins Tend to Raise Kids Who Take Statins 
 Posted on June 5, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
Eating and exercise habits tend to pass from parents to children. So, it appears, do the resulting medical problems. According to Reuters some doctors are prescribing cholesterol controlling statins to children . Debra Sherman reports:
 Cholesterol is making inroads in kindergartens on piles of pizza and burgers, and children as young as 10 are taking statin drugs along with their vitamins to stay healthy.
Poor diets and lack of exercise are the same factors behind rising childhood obesity, and can lead to health problems later in life, notably heart disease, doctors said.

&quot;Genetics play a role, but this is more a lifestyle problem,&quot; said Dr. Steven Nissen, interim chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic.

Bad cholesterol builds up plaque on artery walls that narrows arteries and blocks blood flow to the heart. High cholesterol also is linked to other health problems, such as strokes.

Nissen said he occasionally prescribes hugely popular cholesterol-lowering statins -- by far the world&apos;s biggest selling class of drugs -- to children when changes in diet and exercise fail to do the job.

&quot;I&apos;ve treated children as young as 10 with them. I&apos;d have to have a compelling reason to do that. Safety data is limited,&quot; he added.

 Choosing to Eat to Live 
 Posted on May 31, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Here&apos;s a recent discussion from Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s Member Center : 

 Forum Member: 
I went to a little health fair at the local Y two weeks ago and the did a non-fasting cholesterol test, blood pressure test and they checked our carotid arteries (very cool to watch blood pumping through veins).

I&apos;m 50 years old and my results are as follows

Total cholesterol = 188
HDL= 88
TRG= 117
BP= 140/94
Pulse rate= 76

The carotid test showed a BB size white spot of plaque on both sides.

My question is this

Is that plaque left over from my Fatkins days (went from Atkins right to you) or is it an indication of a build up from me straying into the SAD (Standard American Diet) foods these past fours months after being 80-100% on your plan for a year?

My dad had the carotid operation and died at 74 from heart problems and lots of strokes. (This is why I started your program in the first place.)

I&apos;ve been having a hard time getting back on your diet 80-100% of the time, it&apos;s been more like 60% (fruit in A.M., salad at lunch, but I lose it by dinner).

Please advise.

 Dr. Fuhrman: 
The plaque is a result of your old diet and maybe from the one you have been on lately too. Moderation really doesn&apos;t accomplish much and in most cases the disease still advances, just at a slower rate. I guess you are just going to have to bite the bullet and eat great tasting healthy food and get well.

What is interesting is that my daughter and I are in Ontario, California and just went to an Italian restaurant in Rancho Calabunga or some town that sounds like that. In any case, we were commenting on that we can&apos;t get food that we like the taste of in a restaurant because everything is too heavily seasoned with salt or hot spices and it simply does not taste as good as the stuff we make at home. The point is that we like our home-based healthy cooking the best. With time you can learn that you do not lose pleasure to gain excellent health. I believe you gain pleasure. In any case, your health is worth it.

 Forum Member: 
Thanks that&apos;s just what I needed to hear. I have been feeling worse and worse lately (knees hurt, swollen ankles, migraines are back) and I guess I was just too stubborn to admit to myself that the best way to health is your way. I really was feeling so much better when sticking to plan 100%. I guess what I wanted to hear was that the plaque was waning, not waxing. I also wanted to let you know that after I wrote to you I found your VHS tape and sat down and watched it again.

By the way was the non-fasting cholesterol test very accurate or should I ask my doctor for a full test when I go for my next visit?

 Dr. Fuhrman: 
It may be off about 5 per cent, but it does not matter. Just let it go for now and get yourself in great health.

 Research: Mice Healthier with Japanese Diet 
 Posted on May 25, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
The standard American diet&apos;s (SAD) streak of defeats continues. According to the Associated Press researchers from Tohoku University determined the traditional Japanese diet (touted as the reason for low levels of obesity in Japan) is healthier than the American diet. Kozo Mizoguchi reports :
 A nutritionist created two menus comprising 21 typical foods from the United States and Japan, according to reports of the study seen by The Associated Press.

Each meal, freeze dried and mixed into powder, was given to eight mice for a period of three weeks, the reports showed.

The American menu included hamburgers and fried chicken, while the Japanese menu included sashimi, or raw fish, and rice porridge.

The study found that several genes that work to break down cholesterol and fat were 1.5 times more active in the mice which received the Japanese menu as opposed to those fed with American food.

The study also found that the level of cholesterol was 10 percent higher in the American-food fed mice. 

But Mizoguchi reports the future is uncertain:
 Health experts, however, are worried about rising rates of obesity, especially among young people who prefer fast food. Tags: Cholesterol , Healthy Food , Obesity , Research

 Howard Stern On Trans-Fat: The Transcript 
 Posted on May 23, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Yesterday I mentioned Howard Stern ranted about trans-fat. Here&apos;s what he actually said.

Stern mentioned that over the weekend he read the article in The New York Times by Nicholas D. Kristof, entitled Killer Girl Scouts . Kristof argues, and Stern agrees, that high trans-fat content in food is no less a threat to Americans than Iranian dictators and terrorists organizations.

Here&apos;s the discussion from the Stern show:
 
 Howard Stern 
You know, I just want to start off by saying, I got a say a right on to a guy in The New York Times this Nicholas D. Kristof dude, who writes for The New York Times. He said in an article yesterday, an opinion piece, exactly what I&apos;ve been saying for years. Here we&apos;re talking about the terrorists and killing us, and of course the horrible situation at the World Trade Center, but even more what&apos;s killing us is Girl Scout cookies and McDonalds and things like that. Because, this guy was talking about his daughter going around selling Girl Scout cookies, and he happened to look at the back of the box and the trans-fat that&apos;s in these cookies, the hydrogenated vegetable oil, that clogs up your arteries leading lots of cholesterol. It&apos;s estimated to kill 30,000 Americans annually and probably more. And what happens is the more of these fat people who eat all this crap, continue to eat it, they end up in the hospital and the taxpayers end up paying all the bills, its draining the economy, fat is draining the economy. Girl Scout cookies have more of this trans-fat, then McDonalds. And you say well if Iranians were running around this country handing out this food that kills us we&apos;d have them all arrested.

 Robin Quivers 
If they were throwing it at us.

 Howard Stern 
And then it brings up an unbelievable point that in the country, in one of the Scandinavian counties, I think it was Copenhagen, is that a country?

 Robin Quivers 
I think that&apos;s a city.

 Howard Stern 
Is that a city? Alright, in Denmark I&apos;m thinking, that&apos;s the country. In Denmark they passed a law that said, you can not have more than 2% of fat in food be trans-fat.

 Robin Quivers 
So that&apos;s against the companies they have to make sure.

 Howard Stern 
That&apos;s right. And the result of all that is you walk into a McDonald&apos;s in Copenhagen and you order a large meal like chicken nuggets and French fries, you get 0.33 grams of trans-fatty acids. If you walk into a McDonald&apos;s in the United States and you order the same meal, you get 10.1 count of grams from trans-fat.

 Robin Quivers 
That&apos;s interesting. I wonder what the other stuff tastes like.

 Artie Lange 
S*#!$%

 Howard Stern 
I don&apos;t know about that. It&apos;s a matter of the fry oil. It doesn&apos;t have to be bad oil. It could be olive oil or something. The KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) provided almost 25 grams of trans-fat, but Denmark, Russia, and Wiesbaden, Germany, none! Negligible.

 Robin Quivers 
So it can be done. Why are they trying to kill us?

 Howard Stern 
Prowl a supermarket and you see Pop Secret butter microwave popcorn has 5 grams of trans-fat per serving, Keebler Chips Deluxe cookies have 1.5 grams of trans-fat per cookie, Drakes Yodels and Ring Dings have 2 grams, a Denny&apos;s Carrot Cake has 3 grams, again if this stuff was being sold by a terrorist nation, they would all be under arrest, we would be bombing them right now for killing us.

 Robin Quivers 
But I said if they were throwing it at us and then you called them terrorists, we would shoot them.

 Howard Stern 
Right, 33,000 people alone a year, they know for sure, die from this, but you know it&apos;s higher.

 Robin Quivers 
Answer my question, why these companies trying to kill people?

 Howard Stern 
I don&apos;t know.

 Artie Lange 
Those KFC dinners are insane. You get a big thing of mashed potatoes with gravy, coleslaw, and a lot of fried chicken. And 12 year olds eat it.

 Howard Stern 
The Bush administration should follow the Danish model and curb the use of trans-fats. And the guy goes on, there&apos;s lots of risk we take in life, brain tumors happen to people, you can&apos;t do anything about that, plane crashes, foreign leaders like in Iran who want to produce nuclear weapons, you got North Korea, that stuff is hard. This is easy...

...Fix this! Fix the s*!# we eat. I mean it literally is clogging our country up. It&apos;s bad news.

 Robin Quivers 
I want to now fly in a McDonald&apos;s hamburger from Sweden or Denmark and one from here and see what they taste like.

 Artie Lange 
Did you ever have fast food overseas Robin? You do a lot traveling.

 Robin Quivers 
No! I don&apos;t eat fast food here.

 Howard Stern 
Yeah it would be almost a sin to travel all that way just to eat McDonald&apos;s. 

 UPDATE: According to Dr. Fuhrman there&apos;s a reason why Howard Stern knows a thing or two about nutrition:
 Howard Stern and Robin Quivers have discussed my Eat To Live diet-style on the air a few years back, they were very impressed with what they found out about it and they obviously had both read the book.

 Refined Foods Raise Your Cholesterol 
 Posted on May 18, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 Adapted from Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Cholesterol Protection For Life : 

Once you start eating larger amounts and bigger portions of fruits and vegetables, you will naturally not have as much room for other food like processed or refined food (fake, man-made foods). These foods are lowest in nutrients and will sabotage your long term health. Processed foods are implicated in the scientific literature in the causation of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

When you take the whole wheat berry and process it into white flour to make white bread or pasta, more than 90% of the fiber and vitamin E, as well as more than 75% of the minerals, are lost. Your body breaks down the carbohydrate into simple sugars and the physiologic response is not much different than if you had consumed cotton candy. White pasta, white rice and white bread are just like sugar; because their fiber has been removed, these nutrient deficient foods are absorbed too rapidly. This, in turn, will raise glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels in your blood. Refined grains are undesirable and will sabotage your weight-loss and cholesterol-lowering efforts.

All refined sweets are low in nutrients and fiber and are rapidly absorbed. These refined sweets include sugar, honey, corn syrup, molasses and corn sweeteners. They all contain insignificant amounts of nutrients (per calorie) and no fiber. More and more studies offer evidence that the consumption of these sweets and white-flour products are a significant cause of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer.1

Getting thinner is extremely important to maximally lower your cholesterol and protect yourself from heart disease and cancer. As you get closer to your ideal weight, your weight loss will gradually slow down and then stop. Your body is a very intelligent &quot;machine&quot; and when you eat correctly, it will achieve its ideal weight.

In addition, if you consume a diet that contains 90-100% nutrient-dense food, you can practically disease-proof your body. Superior nutrition has such a powerful effect on the body&apos;s ability to defend itself against illness that it can force genetics to take a secondary role; therefore, our genetic weaknesses can remain at bay.

 The Haggis and Butter Diet? 
 Posted on April 13, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 The Scotsman reports fad diets like Atkins and processed convenience foods are taking Scotland by storm. With more and more Scottish citizens adopting these diet-styles, health correspondent Lyndsay Moss says Scottish bones could be at risk .
 A balanced diet including calcium, vitamin D and other minerals is vital for healthy bones, which are less at risk of fracture.


But the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) warned that many Scots could be putting their bones at risk due to food fads and because they are eating more processed foods than before.

The charity said regimes such as the low-carbohydrate Atkins diet and the cabbage soup diet could mean people are not getting a nutritional balance. 

Bone health is one of the less-discussed aspects of low-carbohydrate diets. A great place to find out more about it is at AtkinsExposed.org , which addresses bone health several times. Here are some highlights:
 &quot;Some high-protein, very-low-carbohydrate, weight-loss diets are designed to induce ketosis. When carbohydrate intake or utilization is insufficient to provide glucose to the cells that rely on it as an energy source, ketone bodies are formed from fatty acids. An increase in circulating ketones can disturb the body&apos;s acid-base balance, causing metabolic acidosis. Evidence suggests that even mild acidosis can have potentially deleterious consequences over the long run, including low blood phosphate levels, resorption of calcium from bone, increased risk of osteoporosis, and an increased propensity to form kidney stones.&quot; Read more . &quot;Urinary excretions of calcium and acids are correlated positively with intakes of animal and nondairy animal protein but are correlated negatively with plant-protein intake.&quot; Read more. &quot;The concern with bone health arises from the fact that muscle protein has a high sulphur content. When people eat too much of this meat protein, sulfuric acid forms within our bodies which must somehow be neutralized to maintain proper internal pH balance. One way our bodies can buffer the sulphuric acid load caused by meat is with calcium borrowed from our bones.&quot; Read more . &quot;Despite having some of the highest calcium intakes in the world, the Inuit also have some of the worst rates of osteoporosis.&quot; Read more .

 Fight Fire With Veggies 
 Posted on March 31, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
The image of rough and tough firefighters swapping war stories over tofu burgers and steamed greens may seem alarming, but for members of Firehouse 2 in Austin Texas it&apos;s vegan or bust. Deborah Bluementhal of The New York Times explains what prompted these &quot;dinosaurs&quot; to abandon their carnivorous ways:
 A routine cholesterol test left Specialist Rae, 37, shaken. The American Heart Association ranks anyone with a level of 240 or more high risk; Specialist Rae&apos;s hit 344.

&quot;I was floored, scared,&quot; he said. &quot;I had no clue.&quot; 

Spooked by the outcome of his test. Specialist Rae asked fellow Firefighter Esselstyn for advice. Esselstyn, 43, a former professional triathlete explained that meat isn&apos;t necessary for optimal health. Esselstyn a vegan had good reason to make his claim:
 Firefighter Esselstyn knew through his father&apos;s work that a strict vegan diet would help. His father, Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn Jr., had been a general surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic and still conducts research there.

Dr. Esselstyn&apos;s 12-year trial with patients with what looked like terminal heart disease showed that a very-low-fat, plant-based diet with cholesterol-lowering medicine could bring striking improvement.

Heart disease &quot;never need exist,&quot; Dr. Esselstyn said, but if it does, &quot;it never need progress.&quot; 

How could someone with a bad ticker drag me out, Esselstyn explains. This concern attracted other members of Engine 2 to veganism as well. The switch seems to be working. Recently Specialist Rae achieved a cholesterol score of under 200.

Austin is taking notice of their herbivorous firemen. Shouting terms of endearment as the red engine drives by. A local eatery even named a sandwich after them, &quot;The Engine 2 Veggie Sandwich.&quot; They even have their own goofy website promoting their diet, with links to several articles about their efforts.

You might recognize the name of one of the firefighters. Firefighter Esselstyn&apos;s father Caldwell B. Esslestyn Jr., M.D. is a leading advocate of a consuming a vegetable-based diet to prevent and reverse heart disease. Dr. Esseltyn&apos;s work has been discussed here before.

 Frankenpork 
 Posted on March 27, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
Gina Kolota of The New York Times reports that cloned pigs may be the nutritional holy grail . Recently researchers from three major universities genetically modified a group of swine to make pork that&apos;s rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

Harvard professor of clinical medicine Alexander Leaf says: &quot;People can continue to eat their junk food,&quot; Dr. Leaf said. &quot;You won&apos;t have to change your diet, but you will be getting what you need.&quot; 

The article glosses over the important point: even with beneficial omega 3 fatty acids pork meat still contains saturated fats and cholesterol. This is from Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Eat to Live , in which he discusses the risk of heart disease as it relates to the consumption of animal products: Poring through nation-by-nation mortality data collected by the World Health Organization, I found that most of the poorer countries, which invariably consume little animal products, have less than 5 percent of the adult population dying of heart attacks.1 The China Project confirmed that there were virtually no heart attacks in populations that consume a lifelong vegetarian diet and almost no heart attacks in populations consuming a diet that is rich in natural plant foods and receives less than 10 percent of its calories from animals. 

For more of Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s thoughts about meat, read his post from Friday .

 European Research: Restricting Animal Products Reduces Weight Gain, Cancer 
 Posted on March 16, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
In Eat to Live Dr. Fuhrman warns against eating regular quantities of animal products, refined grains, and oils, urging you instead to get most of your calories from vegetables, fruits, legumes, seeds, and raw nuts: Vegetable and fruits protect all types of cancers if consumed in large enough quantities. Hundreds of scientific studies document this. The most prevalent cancers in our country are mostly plant-food-deficiency disease. Raw vegetables have the most powerful anti-cancer properties of all foods.


Research shows that those who avoid meat and diary have lower rates heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.1 

Studies have confirmed that individuals consuming a vegetarian diet (one based on plant matter and not dairy or refined grains) live longer than non-vegetarians and almost never get heart attacks.

With this in mind, consider this recent weight loss study from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition . The eating habits of 22,000 people, meat eaters and vegetarians, were tracked over five years. In the end results found that all participants gained a few pounds, but individuals who adopted a vegetarian or vegan diet gained the least. Reuters reports:
 &quot;The weight gain was less in the vegans than in the meat-eaters and somewhere in between in the other groups,&quot; said Tim Key, of Britain&apos;s Cancer Research UK charity and the University of Oxford, who conducted the study.

&quot;The lowest weight gain was in people who changed their diet to eat fewer animal products,&quot; he told Reuters. 

In addition to stressing the importance of physical activity for sustained health, the study also comments on the link between diet and cancer:
 [The study] also showed that diet is second only to tobacco, as a leading cause of cancer, and, along with alcohol, is responsible for nearly a third of cancer cases in developed countries.

 Knock Out Obesity and High Cholesterol with Veggies 
 Posted on March 15, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
In Eat to Live Dr. Fuhrman calls obesity &quot;the number one health problem in the United States.&quot; If the current trend continues by the year 2030 all adults in the United States will be obese. The National Institutes of Health estimate that obesity is associated with a twofold increase in mortality, costing society more than $100 billion per year.1 Of course, regular readers of this blog know pretty well what he recommends as a solution: a healthy diet rich with vegetables, fruits, legumes, seeds, and raw nuts.


Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s approach was shown in a study to reduce LDL cholesterol 33% , making it the only nutritional approach shown to be more effective than statins.

Now there&apos;s news of a milder nutritional intervention that has been getting some milder--but promising results. A study published this month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that eating nutrient rich foods like tofu and oatmeal help lower cholesterol. Beth Duff-Brown of the Associated Press reports: Jenkins, Canadian research chair in metabolism and nutrition at Toronto, and Dr. Cyril Kendall, also of the University of Toronto, studied 55 middle-aged men and women who had high cholesterol and were at risk for heart disease.


The participants were already on a heart-healthy diet. They were then prescribed a diet that included more specific foods, such as raw almonds, tofu and other soy foods, viscous fibers such as oatmeal, barley, okra and eggplant, and plant sterol-enriched margarine.

After a year, the group who stuck faithfully to the new eating plan lowered their cholesterol by an average of 29 percent. Jenkins said the rate was comparable to results from participants who had taken a statin drug for one month before starting the diet, as well as general studies of patients on such drugs.

 Childhood Obesity: Growing In The Wrong Direction 
 Posted on March 2, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
Obesity is rapidly becoming one the nation&apos;s worst epidemics. A dangerous trend considering the variety of diseases linked to obesity, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The growing number of overweight children is especially concerning. This article on KidsHealth.org discusses the issue and provides tips to help kids beat the bulge:
 Overweight children are at risk for serious health conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol - all once considered exclusively adult diseases. But overweight children may also be prone to low self-esteem that stems from being teased, bullied, or rejected by peers. Overweight children are often the last to be chosen as playmates, even as early as preschool. Children who are unhappy with their weight may be more likely than average-weight children to develop unhealthy dieting habits and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, and they may be more prone to depression, as well as substance abuse. 
Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Disease Proof Your Child is devoted to helping parents keep their children free of disease through proper nutrition. In the book he offers this stern warning about childhood obesity:
 Obesity is the most common nutritional problem among children in the United States. On in three kids in America are overweight, and the problem is growing. The number of children who are overweight has more than doubled during the past decade. Social forces, from the demise of cooking to the rise of fast food, as well as dramatic increases in snack food and soda consumption, have led to the most overweight population of children in human history. Added to this dietary disaster is television, computer, and video technology that entertains our youngsters while they are physically inactive. Unless parents take a proactive role in promoting and assuring adequate nutrition and an active lifestyle, you can be sure the children of American will continue this downward spiral into obesity and ill health. Obese children suffer physically and emotionally throughout childhood and then invariably suffer with adult heart disease, and a higher cancer incidence down the road.

 Grapefruit a &quot;Great Fruit&quot; 
 Posted on February 21, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
In today&apos;s New York Times Nicholas Bakalar reports that research in an upcoming edition of The Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry show ruby red grapefruits are useful in controlling cholesterol: Researchers tested 57 patients ages 39 to 72 who had undergone coronary bypass surgery and had found that Zocor, or simvastatin, was ineffective. They divided them randomly into three groups.

Each group consumed the same diet, except that one ate one red grapefruit daily, the second ate one white grapefruit, and the third ate no grapefruit at all. None took lipid-lowering drugs during the test.

After one month, there were no differences in the heart rate, blood pressure or weight of the three groups. Antioxidant activity in both white and red groups was increased compared with the group that ate no grapefruit.

But the group that ate red grapefruit every day also had significantly decreased blood levels of triglycerides.

 But My Cholesterol is Fine 
 Posted on January 19, 2006 by Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; Pugliese 
 Written by Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s colleague Dr. Steven Acocella, MS, D.C., DACBN, Board Certified Clinical Nutritionist, and a Diplomat of the American Clinical Board of Nutrition. 
 Excess weight, especially in middle age dramatically increases the risk of developing heart disease, stroke and other morbid conditions even in the absence of more established indicators of risk such as smoking, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) concludes that excess weight itself puts people at greater risk for significant health problems. This massive study followed over 17,000 men and women ages 31 to 64 over an average of 32 years. Each participant was assigned to one of 5 groups based upon risk factors independent of weight that included past or present tobacco use, elevated blood pressure and elevated cholesterol. The low-risk group never smoked and had normal cholesterol levels and blood pressure. The moderate-risk group didn&apos;t smoke but had either slight elevations in cholesterol or blood pressure. The intermediate-risk group had either high cholesterol, high blood pressure or currently smoked. The elevated-risk group and high-risk group had any 2 or all 3 three of these risk factors, respectively. The results were alarming.

The incidence of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart attacks and diabetes were observed as well as hospitalizations and deaths related to these conditions. The body mass index (height to weight ratio) was calculated for each participant and compared health status to BMI for each group. The study evidenced that individuals with no cardiovascular risk factors as well as for those with 1 or more risk factors who were overweight in middle age had a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and mortality from heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes than those who were of normal weight. In fact, the risk of death from heart disease was an ominous 43 percent higher within the low-risk group (no risk factors) for overweight and obese individuals as compared to those of normal weight.

I often hear overweight people proudly stating that their cholesterol numbers and blood pressure readings are normal intimating that in some way their weight is less of a problem. I have literally had patients say that although they know they&apos;re overweight it&apos;s &quot;OK&quot; because their cholesterol is fine. Not fine. This perception may grant some overweight people a false sense of security when it comes to their health. This fool&apos;s paradise is often fostered by the barrage of drug commercials, other media messages and even uninformed health professionals that overemphasize some risk factors while understating the importance of attaining a healthy weight, especially in middle age.

This important study clearly demonstrates that just because those lab results are great, excess weight alone puts you at almost double the risk for an untimely death.

 Vegetarian Diets are Not All Created Equal: An Example 
 Posted on January 13, 2006 by Joel Fuhrman 
 From Dr. Fuhrman&apos;s book Eat to Live :

A patient came in for his yearly checkup. He was not overweight and had been following a vegetarian diet for years. I did a dietary review of what he ate regulary. He was eating &quot;healthy&quot; flaxseed waffles for breakfast, lots of pasta, whole-wheat bread, and vegan (no animal products) prepared frozen meals on a regular basis.

I spent about thirty minutes pointing out that he was certainly not following my dietary recommendations for excellent health and presented him with some menu suggestions and an outline of my nutritional prescription for superior health, which he agreed to follow.

Twelve weeks later, he had lost about eight pounds and I rechecked his lipid profile, because I didn&apos;t like the results we received from the blood test taken the day of his checkup.

The results speak for themselves:
 2/1/2001
Cholesterol 230
Triglycerides 226
HDL 55
LDL 130
Cholesterol/HDL Ratio 4.18

5/2/2001

Cholesterol 174
Triglycerides 57
HDL 78
LDL 84
Cholesterol/HDL Ratio 2.23

 Can Cholesterol Be Too Low? 
 Posted on December 30, 2005 by Joel Fuhrman 
Typically, those individuals promoting the myth that low cholesterol levels are dangerous and the topsy-turvey &quot;science&quot; that saturated fat and high cholesterol are not bad, but good, are those individuals and health advisors advocating diets high in animal products, such as the Atkins devotees. Unfortunately, this advice is not merely incorrect; it is dead wrong for hundreds of individuals who heed such dangerous advice and die of heart attacks every day.

When it comes to coronary artery disease, there may be no such thing as lowering total blood cholesterol levels too far. Another recent study, published in the journal Circulation, found that the arteries in male patients with a total cholesterol level as low as 155 mg/dl benefited significantly from cholesterol-lowering medication as well.1 Both regression of atherosclerosis and a dramatic reduction in heart attacks were seen in the group treated.

While some research in the past has raised questions about the safety of very low cholesterol levels, no danger has been proven in larger, more dependable investigations. The new reports, documenting the effectiveness in saving lives with more substantial cholesterol lowering, fuels an ongoing debate about how aggressively to treat heart disease patients whose cholesterol levels are better than average and whether aggressive cholesterol lowering is valuable even in young healthy adults without signs of heart disease.

In the past, it was thought to be good enough to have a cholesterol level better than average. Until recently, doctors advised their patients to strive for a total cholesterol lower than 200 mg/dl. Eventually, this advice was found to be lacking and now we know that it is not very good to be average in a population that ubiquitously develops atherosclerosis. On autopsy, almost all American adults demonstrate significant coronary artery disease (2) and even 78% of young trauma victims who died before the age of 35 demonstrated significant atherosclerosis on autopsy.3 If you eat American food, you will inevitably develop American diseases. It is rare that someone can escape from the biological laws of cause and effect.

Clearly, if we attempt to rival the low cholesterol of populations that eat mostly natural plant foods and do not have heart disease, we are always looking at total cholesterols below 150 mg/dl. The average cholesterol level in rural China, as documented in the massive China Cornell Project, was 127 mg/dl. Heart attacks were rare, and both cancer and heart disease rates plummeted as cholesterol levels fell, which reflected very low animal product consumption. The lowest occurrence of heart disease and cancer occurred in the group that consumed plant-based diets with less than two servings of animal products per week.

There was some controversy years ago about striving for lower, protective cholesterol levels after some studies in the eighties noted that depression, suicide, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, and death from other causes, were higher in some groups with very low cholesterol groups. Larger, recent investigations studying larger populations did not confirm these questionable findings.

When investigators looked more carefully at the individual characteristics of the studied populations they were able to explain the earlier findings. This issue is complicated because these studies evaluated individuals who were eating the modern American diet, rich in saturated fat and other components of animal products that raise cholesterol, and low in plant derived anti-oxidants, phytochemicals, and essential fatty acids that improve cholesterol ratios. Those who demonstrated very low (ideal) cholesterol levels, while following the traditional, modern, cholesterol-promoting diet, may actually have a compromised health status or undetected chronic disease.

For instance, we know cancer causes less cholesterol production in the liver. Low cholesterol may be associated with cancer, but does not cause it. Researchers showed that cholesterol starts to fall up to 8 years prior to a person dying of cancer, and that those with the greatest drop in cholesterol in a 4 year period without dietary improvements to lower cholesterol were those most likely to develop cancer.4 The low cholesterol did not cause the cancer; the cancer caused the low cholesterol. Those who work to lower cholesterol by avoiding saturated fats, eating a high nutrient diet with lots of raw vegetables, cooked green vegetables, and beans do not have a pathological condition causing their low cholesterol. They earned it.

This is why in rural China where the diets are nearly vegetarian, the average cholesterol levels are low and you see lower cancer rates, not higher. Those with the lowest cholesterol in the China study actually had the lowest cancer rates as well. Obviously, there is a difference between one who has a low cholesterol because his dietary style earns it, and one whose cholesterol seems unjustifiably low on a modern heart-disease-promoting diet that almost everyone in the west eats.

 Pomegranate Power 
 Posted on December 22, 2005 by Joel Fuhrman 
Pomegranate juice is a rich source of phytochemical compounds shown to benefit the heart and blood vessels. It not only lowers cholesterol, but lowers blood pressure and increases the speed at which heart blockages (atherosclerosis) melt away.

Recent medical research completed in 2004 studied heart patients with severe carotid artery blockages. They were given an ounce of pomegranate juice for a year, and not only did their blood pressure lower by over 20 percent, but there was a 30 percent reduction in atherosclerotic plaque.1

The data was measured by IMT technology. IMT stands for Intima Media Thickness. It has been shown in medical studies that the thickness of the plaque in a specific place in the neck has an excellent correlation with coronary artery atherosclerotic burden. The control group who did not receive the juice had their arteries close off even further. IMT thickness increased 9 percent.

Not only are pomegranates good for your heart and blood vessels but they have been shown to inhibit breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, leukemia and to prevent vascular changes that promote tumor growth in lab animals.2

Pomegranates&apos; potent antioxidant compounds have also been shown to reduce platelet aggregation and naturally lower blood pressure, factors that prevent both heart attacks and strokes.3 Pomegranates contain high levels of flavonoids and polyphenols, potent antioxidants offering protection against heart disease and cancer. A glass of pomegranate juice has more antioxidants than red wine, green tea, blueberries, and cranberries.

Pomegranate juice has also been found to contain phytochemical compounds that stimulate serotonin and estrogen receptors, improving symptoms of depression and improving bone mass in lab animals.4

Given the fact that pomegranate juice is so rich in heart protective compounds and there are animal studies to support the beneficial findings in human studies, it makes the results of these recent investigations understandable and believable. Pomegranate is a powerful food for good health.5

Summary Features of Pomegranate

1. Most powerful anti-oxidant of all fruits
2. Potent anti-cancer and immune supporting effects
3. Inhibits abnormal platelet aggregation that could cause heart attacks, strokes and embolic disease
4. Lowers cholesterol and other cardiac risk factors
5. Lowers blood pressure
6. Shown to promote reversal of atherosclerotic plaque in human studies.
7. May have benefits to relieve or protect against depression and osteoporosis

I recommend all my patients who have heart disease, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure to incorporate pomegranate juice into their diet and, for the above reasons I have added pomegranate concentrate to my cholesterol lowering formula, LDL Protect .

 A New Way of Addressing Heart Disease 
 Posted on December 19, 2005 by Joel Fuhrman 
More than 1.5 million people will have a heart attack this year with about 1 million deaths due to heart disease. This amounts to another needless death every 30 seconds. In 1997 the direct medical costs attributed to heart disease came to 59 billion--more than any other medical condition. Drugs, medical procedures and surgery are the recommended approach to deal with heart disease in America. As a result, the demand for high-tech expensive, but largely ineffective, medical care is high, causing medical costs and insurance rates to skyrocket. The medical answer to heart disease is both financially devastating and futile. An entire industry has blossomed to attempt to deal with the dangers of heart-disease-causing food. It wouldn&apos;t be so bad if patients were told there was another option that was more effective and could reverse heart disease and protect their life with certainty. If good information was distributed to all patients, then they could choose which road was right for them.

If all the physicians in America gave patients this information, we would have a new major problem. The patients would get well, the doctors and hospitals would lose most of their business and the drug companies would lose billions. People would have to be re-trained for new careers as a multi-billion dollar industry would lose almost all of its customers. Not a likely scenario. Nevertheless, my goal is to recruit an army of heart-disease-proof individuals, who will be winners in the war against unnecessary heart disease deaths.

High cholesterol and resultant heart disease is a far too common problem--but it is both preventable and reversible. The risk of cardiovascular disease, resulting in a heart attack or embolic stroke, is directly related to your cholesterol level.

Today&apos;s cardiac protective recommendations are:
-LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl
-Total cholesterol below 150 mg/dl

Unfortunately, less than 10% of adults in the United States meet this requirement and heart disease and stroke kill more people than all other causes of death combined.

 Dramatic cholesterol lowering results, without drugs
 
In my medical practice, I have helped thousands of patients successfully lower their cholesterol levels without drugs . I recommend that my patients lower their cholesterol through natural methods whenever possible, using prescription drugs only when absolutely necessary because of their potentially serious side effects. Almost all of my patients prefer this judicious approach and it is very rare that they are not able to achieve these protective levels naturally.

Hundreds of my patients have dropped their cholesterol into the favorable range and protected themselves against heart disease, without drugs, using my methods.

Just for an example, in one day, last month I had five patients who dropped their LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl. Don&apos;t forget, this was just one day in my practice!

Not only did all these individuals have dangerously high cholesterols, but each patient also reported numerous health problems. Peggy suffered from chronic anemia, Eugene was tired all the time, Keith had chronic heart burn and allergies, and Maria had become severely ill from a statin drug prescribed to her by her prior physician. These four patients needed help and they realized that prescription drugs were risky and not the answer. They all returned to my office between 6 and 8 weeks after their first visit and this is what we found.
