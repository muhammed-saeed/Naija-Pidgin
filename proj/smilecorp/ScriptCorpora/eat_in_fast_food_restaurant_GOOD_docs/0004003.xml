 There&apos;s a Weirdo Raising My Children 
 
 My family has told me from the day I was born that I was a
little strange. Possibly not even from the planet Earth. I never really
understood why they thought that. I just did what I did, liked what I liked and
said what I said. 
 I did come out of the womb rocking my head back and forth
and never stopped. I’m sure that looked a bit strange to grown ups. Head back
and forth…that is how I put myself to sleep until my self conscious pre-teen
years when I feared rocking my head back and forth on a pillow would give me a
bald spot. These days if you rock your head back and forth someone somewhere
thinks you need medication. No medication for me and no bald spot thankfully,
but still considered a little weird by polite and normal society’s standards.
However, I have always been pretty good at hiding my brand of odd. (Until
Facebook that is. The cat is out of the bag but only just a little). I mean, I
can interview for a job, I can put someone at ease, I don’t mouth breathe
unless I have a cold and I can hold a conversation with a doctor, a lawyer, a
butcher, a baker and/or a candlestick maker. So I may be a Martian, but I damn
well have taught myself how to fit into Earthling society. 
 What makes me a weirdo? Hell I don’t know. It’s just a
stupid label I’ve been given because I occasionally voice an odd thought that entered
my brain. My brain either is missing a chip or has an extra one embedded in it
from my birth planet. What’s the big deal that I have a mental ritual I have to
perform in order to keep people who’ve left my house from getting into a car
accident? It only takes 30 seconds out of my day. Not such a big deal to me. So
what that I wish there was a computer that could calculate how many times I’ve
said the word,“the”in my lifetime. You have to admit that would be pretty
cool. And I don’t think it’s so odd that I’ve spent time wondering what it’s
like to a be an ant on a tortilla chip trying to figure out how exactly to
start chomping into that sucker. 
 Some weirdos prefer to be called“eccentric”. As if that is
the high class superior version of weird. Not me. Apparently I’m just a good
old fashioned weirdo. And that’s cool with me. Besides, you have to be British
to be eccentric. And you usually have to have a hairdo out of the Helena Bonham
Carter catalogue of hairstyles as well as a set of teeth out of a rusty old tool
shed. And you must own a lot of purple-ish fringy scarves. Not to mention you
typically emanate an odor that can only be described as‘lavender fields of
chocolate curry covered patchouli mothballs’. It’s an odd smell and fitting for
the best of the eccentrics out there. Oh, and let’s not forget the
disproportionate amount of cat hair covered clothing whether there’s a cat (or
15) in the picture or not. 
 So, eccentric in my book is too specific. That label won’t
work for me. Not a big fan of strange either because I think of the word
stranger, and I don’t know a movie with the word stranger in it that turned out
well. Strangers on a Train. Not a happy ending for Farley Granger but he did
ask for that so my sympathy is limited. When a Stranger Calls. Yeah. Ruined the
lives of every babysitter that watched it in the late 70’s. Not a scarier opening
to a movie is in existence. Gives me the heebie jeebies just thinking about
it.   More recently, The Strangers.
Don’t have to see that one to know the outcome is not good. The movie poster
art tells me all I need to know. 
 Freak. I can take or leave freak. I tend to think of Circus
oddballs with unusual body shapes and circumstances when I think of freaks, but
I can sometimes find it endearing. 
 Bizarre. Bizarre goes a little beyond eccentric, strange,
freakish, odd and weird to me. If you’re bizarre, you’re usually doing things
that even aliens would find bizarre. Joaquin Phoenix on David Letterman a few
years back. Bizarre. I don’t care how he explains it now, he made Andy Kaufman
antics seem like a chat with Morley Safer. Fellini’s Satyricon. Classic foreign
film and bizarre as hell. Even after taking a film theory class where we
discussed it, I still don’t get it. So if I’m being called bizarre, I fear I’m beyond making
sense anymore.   
 People can call me names, but I personally don’t think I’m
all that odd. My head just drifts into the clouds quite a bit. But I come back
to Earth just as often as I leave it. So I think what my family should really
be labeling me as is“balanced.”That’s’a nice and appropriate term. And my
balanced ass likes to march to my own tune. It may be a tune with the word“poop balls”in it. But it’s mine and I’ll take it over marching to no tune at
all.

 What Knockers! My History of Breastfeeding 
 
 So
I’ve just hit a huge, MAJOR milestone in my life as a mother, and my life
period. I’ve put the boobies away for good and weaned my last child. Oh it was
not easy. Not easy at all. My 3 year old daughter was not giving up the mommy
milk (mimmies in her words) without a vicious fight. A scratching clawing
fight. More on that later. 
 This
end to an era is bittersweet no doubt. On the one hand, I have longed for my
freedom at home. It’s been years since I’ve been able to sit on the couch
without a babe climbing into my lap to catch a comforting sip. On the other
hand, I will never do this again. I feel I am letting go of my baby and pushing
her to grow up. I mean she really is just a baby. 3 year olds have the maturity
level of 3 year olds. Which is still quite baby-ish. 
 During
my early twenties, when my breasts were far more popular than I was, I only saw
them as a source of attention from men and a source of income from men who
liked to tip bartenders with comely young bouncy flesh orbs.   I never met a tight fitting low cut
t-shirt I didn’t like. Well wait. I take that back. Yes I have. It was white
and inside a dark bar with bar lighting, and my white bra glowed in the dark. Talk
about getting the hell out of Dodge fast! But for the most part, if it was
cotton, tight and wide open at the neck, I was a fan.Which is one of the
reasons I threw a colossal fit when one of the bars where I worked changed the
dress code so that all employees had to wear ugly, unflattering, beige and
green baggy ass, man cut t-shirts with crew neck collars. I put in my two weeks
notice in record time. 
 My
next move was to a bar where the dress code was“no jeans”. Well hell I could
deal with that. A year and a half into that gig, I mistook a Kiwi for an Aussie
and ended up married 9 months later. You have to fast forward 3 years to get to
the breastfeeding. So 3 years later, I was 40 weeks pregnant, larger than Kevin
Federline post Britney and thinking,“When this baby comes out, I’m actually going
to give breastfeeding a shot. Why not?”You could not have told me that
pre-pregnancy. I mean breastfeeding was for groovy hippies without a care or
worry in the world…right? I didn’t mind bouncing the boobs in a form fitting
top, but unleashing them on the world to feed a baby? Just couldn’t see that
for myself. 
 But
some little mommy voice kept knocking on my conscience’s door saying,“How can
it hurt to try? If it doesn’t work, you have back up. If it does work, then
presto! Cheap food.”So I got over my inhibitions and fears about it and gave
it a try. 
 My
firstborn latched on like one of those creepy leach-lipped fish you see
suctioned on the side of a fish tank. Once he got a hold of it he wasn’t
letting go. What the hell? It took me awhile to figure out how to unlatch the
baby jaws of death. Just poke a little finger in their mouth and wiggle it
around until they let go. I guess at least he liked it but damn little man. I’m
not going to lie, it was ridiculously uncomfortable at first and I was not
convinced anything was coming out. 
 By
day 3 I was sore, had a cracked nipple and wanted to drop kick, bitch slap, and
karate chop every member of La Leche League who ever said,“If it hurts, you’re
not doing it right.”Bullshit. My tender nipples that have rarely seen the
light of day are now the sole life source for a hungry infant with twice the
suction of a fucking Dyson. That’s why it hurts! Here’s a sentence you can add
to your Womanly Art of Breastfeeding,“Kiss my ass!” 
 Now
before my crunchy friends disown me, please know those thoughts came from me
when I was sleep deprived and pissed off at nature for making the natural seem
impossible. But I kept giving it a good fight because Boss Hog took a shine to
it. 
 Through
all of this I was getting antsy to see some real milk because all I had
produced at that point was colostrum and I kept thinking my son was not really
getting enough to eat. I wanted to see some real evidence dammit! This is the
part where my conscience spoke up again, but this time she said,“Be careful
what you wish for because girlfriend, you’ve got no idea what’s about to happen
here.” 
 Man
was my conscience ever correct. The books sure don’t prepare you for the milk
invasion. It’s like nothing I ever imagined. Men, I’d like you just to envision
how your testicles feel on an average day. Now, pretend some nature fairy
replaced the testicles you have come to know and love with a couple of medicine
balls filled with liquid. After you stop crying, you eventually have to get up
and walk. You would need a special apparatus to hold those monsters in place so
that you could resume what’s left of your life. Enter exhibit A–The Nursing
Bra! 
 Gotta
have a nursing bra when your milk arrives. And it’s absolutely pointless to buy
one during your pregnancy. Your boobs double and triple in size…so wait til the
babe comes out and the milk comes in! My fitting was a real trip. Oh they had
some cute bras with leopard prints but they were in size G…too small for me.
Yeah that’s right. I skipped right over G and went straight to J. 36 J. I was
like,“Come again?”What the hell does J stand for Jupiter? Jugs? Jeez O’Pete? 
 This
was the ugliest piece of undergarment clothing I had ever laid my eyes on and I
was about to pay fifty bucks for it. Ugh! But I did because I had no choice.
Looking at my post partum body with that thing on was depressing. I looked like
all the before photos from weight loss supplement ads. And I felt like I
belonged on the Benny Hill show as one of the body doubles for the melons! All for the good of the babe…right? 
 2 weeks
into my new role as provider of everything to my baby, I was starting to get the
hang of it.   A little shocked the
first time my baby quickly unlatched and I realized my breasts were actually garden
hoses with 3 sprinkler settings to them. The quick unlatch brought out the jet
stream for sure. A nodding off baby, more of a light spray. All of the things I
didn’t know about breastfeeding but had to learn on the fly was mesmerizing to
me. The whole process was pretty awesome, but the most amazing thing was
watching my baby grow strictly from food produced from my body. I was beginning
to like Mother Nature again.     
 One
of the down sides to all of this breastfeeding was a lack of alone time and sleep.
Who better to get up in the middle of the night to feed fussy hungry baby than
the parent with the food? Oh sure I could pump and let daddy feed, (and I did)
but who wants to pump when they don’t have to? Pumping is the biggest, most
boring, time consuming pain in the ass. And my breast pump (lovely enduring
thing that it was) always spoke to me during pumping sessions. Sometimes it
would say,“Aflac! Aflac!”Other times it would say,“RedRum”“RedRum”. As
annoying as it is to hear your breast pump do its best Insurance Goose (or is
it a duck?) impression, it was much preferable to its creepy kid from The
Shining impression. 
 Sleep
deprivation, obnoxious breast pump and ugly bra aside, the breastfeeding
children thing became something I was really good at. So I kept doing it. I
made a goal of 1 year with my firstborn and exceeded it by 2 months. When my
second son was born, breastfeeding was a piece of cake. No cracked nipples
thank goodness, but I was still sleep deprived and being stalked by the little boy
in the Shining kid’s mouth thanks to my Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump. 
 Boy
number 2 got the same 14 months of momma’s milk as Boy number 1. Then I took a
4 year break while we decided if we’d have any more children, and while I lent
my jabber jaws of a breast pump to my sister-in-law. 
 When
baby number 3 came along, I was practically schooling the lactation consultant
the hospital sent to my room. The one who came the second day of my stay took
one look at me and said,“Yeah, you’re good. Do you need anything?”Yes, a
spare set of nipples would be nice. (I mean, I was experienced but the nipples
still get sore when attacked by ravenous newborns.) 
 This
time around I thought I’d let my baby nurse a little longer. I’d just play it
by ear but definitely be done by age 2. Over the age of 2 would be beyond my
comfort level. At her 18 month check up, I still fed the little thing on demand
and asked her pediatrician if she’d ever let up. The doctor explained to me
that breastfeeding to her was her lovey. Some babies and toddlers had blankets
or Teddy Bears or pacifiers. My daughter’s lovey just happened to be attached
to my body. And she told me not to be surprised if she wanted to nurse until
she was 2½to 3. Oh Hell no. I was missing my autonomy desperately; there was
no way I was getting near the 2½mark let alone 3. That’s just crazy talk! 
 But
2 came around and sweet baby had zero interest in letting up.   Occasionally I’d say no, and it would
turn into a fight to the death. (The death of my freedom.) I just couldn’t say
no to her. She’d bawl and cry and I felt horrible. I’d say to my husband,“Okay…she’s clearly not ready, we can continue for a bit longer and I’ll wean
her by the time she is 2½.”Yeah, dream on sucker. This one ain’t weaning
until she is good and ready, and I had the claw marks on my upper chest to
prove it. 
 I
always had an excuse why I couldn’t wean. Work stress, baby not feeling well,
too tired, etc. But the main reason was it felt cruel to me to wean her when
she was still not ready. I personally was ready but stuck it out a bit longer for
her. When she turned 3 last month and I still couldn’t see an end in sight, I
knew I’d need to make that end come. (I am having a surgical procedure next
month and cannot have a big ass 3 year old all over the mimmies!) 
 So
I prepped her verbally one day. Just talked about it all day long. When night
came, she didn’t even ask for them. Just went straight to sleep. She has fussed
a few times since then and is still asking on occasion, but I’m not going back
now. 
 In
the words of all those useless Bachelors and Bachlorettes,“It’s been a long
journey but very rewarding.”Only I really mean it. Much easier for me to say
that now that I’m done. A few weeks ago you would have gotten the stink eye
from me if you made even one innocent little remark about my breastfeeding…I
was so over it. I spent 5½years of the last 10 breastfeeding. That’s a lot of
work for a 40 year old set of cans. But I gotta say, I’m impressed with their
durability. They are not too shabby for all they’ve been through. What knockers
indeed! Posted by Meredith at 10:35 PM 2 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Links to this post

 When Dead Animals Attack! 
 
 &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a person lying on their bathroom floor in possession of a wretched case of food poisoning, must be in want of a quick death.&quot; 
 November 11, 2011. Many were excited about this date and hoped to give birth or get married. I guess because having 6 number ones in a row brings good luck?? Never heard that before. Sure I suppose it’s kind of cool to write out 11-11-11. But after the 30 th email I sent that day for work with the date 11-11-11, I was over its very minor coolness. I understand 7-7-7 when that day came and went 4 years ago. Because lucky number 7 right? But I’ve never heard of lucky number 11 and for me it’s turning out to be a real shit number. You see, on 11-11-11 my food tried to kill me for the 3 rd time in my life. 
 Let me take you back to Jr. high school and a very nasty Domino&apos;s Pizza my mom had ordered us for dinner. It had sausage on it, it had pepperoni on it, it had green pepper on it. And about 5 hours later so did our living room couch, chair and floor. My 2 older brothers and I all got sick at the same time. I suppose it could have been a stomach virus, but with the way that green pepper was flying through the air, I’m convinced we had a killer pizza. My poor mother. It should have been easier on her considering we were all teens and should have been able to make it to the bathroom in time for some of the chucking, but sometimes when your food attacks you, you don’t have the strength to sprint to another room. Sucks big time. I could not eat pizza for many years after that episode. People thought I was un-American. How do you not eat pizza Meredith? Because even the smell of it brought back memories of wishing for death. So no thanks, I’ll pass. When I did give in and started eating pizza again, I spent another few years pulling all toppings off so I just had the crust and tomato sauce. I got grief for that one too. I don’t know why. Why should anyone else care if I ate naked pizza for a few years? 
 Food poisoning episode number 2 took place in November of 1996 when I was 24 years old. I waited tables at night and shared a rental with my mom and brother during that year. I left my job early because I just wasn’t feeling right. The moment I got home I had the most violent puking I had ever had in my life. Coupled with the“rain”of terror coming out my backside, I thought I was dying. I was wishing for death out loud and became completely bonkers and incoherent. All of this was in only a matter of a few hours. My terrified mom who was probably channeling Ellen Burstyn’s character in the Exorcist didn’t know whether to call a priest or an ambulance. Thankfully she chose ambulance or I would be ashes on top of someone’s fireplace today. When the head EMT arrived he asked (like they all do), &quot;What seems to be the trouble?&quot; Are you freaking kidding me!? What seems to be the trouble? A volcano just erupted inside my body while lava guts are spewing out of my gob and my ass and you want to know what seems to be the trouble? &quot;Uh Mister, can&apos;t you take a guess?&quot; Is what I would have asked, had I been able to speak. There was no &apos;seems&apos; to be trouble...this was full on trouble! I could not hold my head up or even open my eyes fully. They had to carry me out on a stretcher and hurry me to the hospital. They could not get an IV going because my veins were being difficult due to the extreme dehydration. They kept sticking me and sticking me all over my arms on that bumpy ride. 
 Finally, once I made it to the hospital, they were able to get the IV going through my hand. Those poor ER nurses and docs that night were in bed pan hell. They opened the door ever so slightly, just enough so that a forearm with an aerosol can attached to its hand could reach in and spray disinfectant. No one wanted to be my caregiver that night. Can’t say I blame them. Not a pretty sight (or smell) in my ER room. My mom peeked her head in to check on me at one point and said,“Meredith, don’t ever let anyone tell you your shit doesn’t stink. Because they’re lying.”True story. I will never forget lying on that cold bed in that cold room whimpering in misery alone while my ever so precious and dear mother practiced her stand up routine. Ba da bum! Good one mom. If I had the strength to lift my middle finger, I would have enthusiastically. A tearful look of desperation from my deathbed had to suffice. No, I wasn’t mad at my mom. She was trying to make me laugh. Something I find impossible to do when my body turns on me and decides to expel every single ingredient that ever entered my mouth. I’m quite sure there was a piece of brussels sprout in my vomit, and I hadn’t eaten a brussels sprout in 11 years. (My 7 th grade Home Economics teacher made me eat one if I was going to get an A in her class. Torture.) 
 So the fluids and medicines in the IV finally started working and I went into a calm haze for a few hours. Some Dr. talked to me about Salmonella and told my mother she did the right thing by bringing me to hospital when she did because I would have eventually died at home otherwise. Gee whiz–thanks undercooked chicken. Clucking bastard. They cleaned me up and I was sent home. Now I cook my chicken to a nice boingy burnt finish. And pretty much put on a hazmat suit whenever I have to handle the raw stuff. However, thanks to those beautiful already cooked rotisserie chickens they sell everywhere now, I rarely have to handle the raw stuff. I truly can’t believe I ever ate meat again after that nightmare. 
 But I did. And on 11-11-11, a dead piece of it turned on me again. Of course these days the plants are turning on people too. Spinach, tomatoes, cantaloupe. Maybe I need to just stick with Pop Tarts–nobody gets food poisoning from them. Perhaps a bigger ass and a bad cholesterol reading, but not food poisoning. 
 I ate an all beef burrito at a little strip mall Mexican restaurant. Mexican food is my absolute favorite. Chips, salsa, guacamole, beans, cheese, non-psychotic beef, queso. The list of deliciousness goes on and on. But the beef burrito was very odd. It was a tortilla filled with beef only. No cheese, no spices, no sauce, no tomatoes, no onions. Nothing but ground up cow parts and a few tasteless toxins (I would find out later). 7:00 pm was the first hint of my near hellish future. You know that feeling. Just a little odd flutter in your gut that makes you put your hand on your stomach, wince a little and start the prayers. Something like this,“Oh no, please God. No. No no no. Don’t let this be what I think it is. Please let this be just a little upset stomach. One round on the potty should get my belly right….right? Oh please oh please oh please.”For me, those prayers fell on deaf holy ears.  
 You don’t need details about the next 10 hours. Because there is not a single one of you that doesn’t already know what those details entail. But I will tell you I traveled (usually in crawling style) from my bed, to the bathroom floor, to the hallway floor, back to the bathroom floor, back to my bed, back to the bathroom floor, back to the hallway floor and so on until it was 4:30 in the morning. That is when the retching stopped. But it wasn’t over yet. It’s not the puking that dehydrates you. It’s the other foul stuff that I can’t seem to bring myself to spell out in words. And that bullshit (there you go!) went on throughout the day. By Sunday morning, I was as pitiful as a legless zombie. Moaning rather than talking, crawling rather than walking. My husband had had enough and scooped me up to take me to the hospital. One IV and a magic bag of fluid later, and I was almost not pitiful anymore. If my husband had told my mom’s joke from 15 years ago, I would have chuckled a bit.  
 So what I have I learned from all of this havoc that has been wreaked to my insides? Bacon. Bacon is where it’s at. Bacon has never turned on me and it never will. Don’t say“Huh uh, you had sausage and pepperoni on that Domino’s pizza liar!”Because then I will be forced to say,“You’re right. Sausage and pepperoni. Not bacon. I didn’t say pigs, I said BACON! Ya useless wanker.”  The end. Posted by Meredith at 9:07 PM 4 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Links to this post

 By the Breaking Dawn&apos;s Early Twilight 
 
 Oh, say can you see, Breaking Dawn at midnight on November 17, 2011? 
 Nope, can’t say that I can see it. That’s because I’ll be busy that night. I’ll be washing my hair. But in my family, I am in the minority. A little hair scrub would never get in the way of my Twilight obsessed family members who are of both the male and female persuasion. Oh I tried the obsession for a bit. But things took a turn for the worse when I was in the middle of the 3rd book Eclipse. More on that in a minute. First a bit of a warning for the Twilight lovers in my life: 
 I will be taking the piss out of Twilight in this blog much like I do in Facebook status updates. But remember, I’m just having fun at the phenomenon’s expense. I mean no real harm. I have my obsessions too cough cough Russell Crowe cough cough. And some might say,“Geez Meredith, Russell hasn’t looked like Maximus in 10 years, so what the hell can you really say about R-Pat and his ironing board face?”To which I might say,“That’s a teeny tiny good point but Russell and his 47 and a½year old love handles could squash R-Pat with his big toe on a bad day.” 
 The pissing match I have created between the vampire du jour and the Gladiator is beside the point. The point is that since this isn’t“my”phenomenon, I am going to poke fun of it until I’m as bored with the poking fun as I was with the first 20 minutes of the movie New Moon (never did finish it.) 
 Okay–so what do I have against Twilight? Well let me start at the beginning. It was 2008 and I knew nothing about Twilight. Not a thing. The movie came and went, people were talking and I just ignored the noise. I was busy carrying my 3 rd child and dealing with a chronically constipated 4 year old. Anyone who has ever had a chronically constipated child knows how much time that takes out of your life. So I paid no attention. After my daughter was born, Twilight was on DVD. I rented it out of a slight curiosity and was absolutely shocked by how much I enjoyed it. I immediately called my niece who was a fan and asked her all about it. She had all the books. Maybe they were my sister’s books. I can’t remember, but I wanted to read them. I was going to become part of the Twilight culture, and was excited about it. 
 I read the first book quickly, even read in the dark with flashlight so as not to wake a sleeping infant. Devoured New Moon immediately after. Thought it was a bit slow and Bella started to get on my nerves but I enjoyed it enough to want to keep going. Maybe Bella would develop a personality in the 3 rd book. By the time I got to the middle of Eclipse, my interest really started to wane. I was so over Bella whining about wanting Edward to turn her into a vampire that I kept flipping the book off. I mean really Bella? You want to give up food and drink and live off animal blood for the rest of your life? Which will be a very freaking long time–especially for the already immortal Edward who has to share that very long life with your humorless ass. 
 So the annoyances in the 3 rd book brought back memories of annoyances from the 2 nd book that I tucked away due to my momentary lapse into Twilight frenzy. Poor pitiful Bella falling apart in the woods in New Moon because her cold dead boyfriend who knows nothing of the meaning of inflection, dumped her so that she could have the life a teenager should have.   I so could not relate to this character at all. Get over it like the rest of us had to when we got dumped as teenagers. Do like we did–date older guys who go to rival schools. Or in your case, younger werewolf guys who are in rival families. Most importantly, get your ass up and live woman! You think Scarlett O’Hara would ever lie in bed and whimper for half a year? Hell no.‘Cause she knows tomorrow is another day. And she isn’t going to waste her time pining over Rhett (boy did she ever screw that one up.) or Ashley. And certainly not a flat faced dead fucker. 
 Speaking of flat-faced dead fuckers, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I don’t get it. Forget the actor behind the character. Let’s be nice and leave him out of it. Let’s just talk about the character. Edward. What do Bella and all of those team Edward freaks see in him? So he gets a little sparkly in the sun, big deal. So does Liberace, who also happens to be dead, and you don’t see droves of teenagers fighting over his sheet music. If it’s not the sparkles, maybe it’s the cool skin. Perhaps Bella has a fever and the only prescription is the teenage Snow Miser. Nah, that can’t be it. No one’s attracted to cold hard flesh. Oh wait…. 
 Hmmm. Maybe it’s his obsessive love for her. Do we want the one we love to be obsessed with us? I can’t speak for anyone else, but I have 3 ones that I love who are obsessed with me and I haven’t had a peaceful People magazine reading enhanced bathroom break in years! So I don’t believe that one either. Ahhh. It’s immortality. As miserable as she is for only being on the planet for 18 years, she wants to live forever and make all the other immortals long for the day they could get hit by a car and not get back up. I swear if I had to spend an eternity with Bella, I’d be looking for the nearest stake. As I said in a recent Facebook status update, Bella’s about as much fun as a Laundromat with empty candy machines and only Fingerhut magazines to read. Ehhh - you might as well throw in an“out of order”Ms. Pacman arcade game while you’re at it…to enhance the fun.   
 I finished Eclipse feeling very unsatisfied and never even read a page of book 4…Breaking Dawn. Didn’t care anymore. I got nothing out of this love story but bad jokes and boredom drool. Although I do dig the werewolf part of the love triangle. It’s not the abs, (well maybe it’s a little bit of the abs) it’s his sense of fun. Jacob actually wanted to do things other than watch Bella sleep. Of course he needs a good vigorous shake to snap him out of his Bella stupor but I’ll cut him some slack due to immaturity. (And I’ll pretend no one told me he imprints on Bella and Edward’s half fanged baby) Yikes. 
 In short Twilight, I tried. It didn’t work, no hard feelings. Let’s just go our separate ways and cling to those few memories we had together when I was immersed in book 1&amp;2. Those were fun times…right? We just weren’t meant to be. Besides, I have been swept away by your more violent and entertaining cousin The Hunger Games. Now Katniss is a heroine I can get behind. March 2012–I will be watching. Posted by Meredith at 10:35 PM 3 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Links to this post

 The Only Thing We Have to Fear is...Well Lots of Things 
 
 With fear as my guide how can I know What it is here that frightens me so He’s got a grip on my gut with ultimate force A grip that steers me way off course I want to scream at him to back away But his grip on me gets tighter each day I’ve become a prisoner to this frightening creature Who has taken my will and become my teacher But I’m learning nothing Nothing but more fear 
 Words from my early twenties when I was in a little darker of a mood. Those words were light compared to some of the other things I jotted down in my lonely, pretentious twenties. But have no fear (hehehe). I’m not about to get deep on ya-all. Fear can be a subject of great depth, no doubt. There are many facets to it. It is the cause of great harm but can also serve a purpose like keeping most people from jumping into Niagra Falls. It’s the subject of endless quotes, anecdotes, books and speeches. But I’m not here to delve into the subject on a great level. Nope. I just want to poke fun of phobias and commiserate with others. Some of which are a real laughing matter. (Well depending on who you ask. My snake-phobic mother would probably not laugh if we hid a rubber snake in her bed. In fact, it might just kill her. So nobody ever do that okay?) 
 This past weekend we had a 50 th birthday party for my brother-in-law. He has a tremendous fear of dolls and clowns. Since it is so much fun to torture someone with a doll/clown fear, my brother bought him a book titled,“Scary Ass Dolls.”Hard to believe he left that book behind when he flew back home. Did my brother really think he’d ever take a peak at that book? Of course not, it was all about the delivery. We could throw the book away for all anyone cared. Spending the money was all about the expression on his face when he opened his gift. (It was not pretty, but it was pretty funny!) 
 I get it though…I really do. Dolls can be real freaky. And they have their ardent fans and collectors. I will never understand someone who wants to collect something that constantly looks at you with wide botox eyes and keeps an expression of“What me? Of course I didn’t throw little Timmy down the stairs. It must have been Fido.”Huh uh. Never trust a doll. They will turn on you. Holly Hobbie and Raggedy Ann are okay I guess. They are cloth like. It’s those antique-y little cracked porcelained skinned things that make me want to run for the hills. 
 In the 1968 Roger Vadim movie Barbarella, Jane Fonda takes on an army of dolls who yap and snap their teeth while drawing blood with their bites. I hated that movie. And I’m not particularly afraid of dolls. But that whole scene was a freaking nightmare. They didn’t really move very fast, but much like zombies, their slow moves added to their creepiness. Never mind that the movie was a complete mind fuck anyway. Add a few psycho snapping dolls and you got a total freakfest. 
 From The Twilight Zone, to Karen Black being chased by the shark-toothed Zuni Fetish doll to Chucky and that damned Poltergeist clown, dolls have had a bad reputation on the small and large screen. And it’s no wonder, they will, (as we’ve seen time and time again,) turn on you in an instant! As a side, if you are afraid of dolls, you are a“pediophobe.” 
 It’s only natural to move from dolls to clowns.   Coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. It has got to be one of the most common fears. And is it ever a legitimate fear. Let’s face it, if you are making a living by painting your face beyond recognition, you have GOT to be hiding something. I’ve seen Paul Stanley post the Kiss make-up phase. Yikes. He was definitely hiding something there. I sure wish he’d hide it again. That scalpel happy face looks right at home in one of Jim Henson’s movies and it ain’t pretty. At the very least he should apply the star to his right eye again. No worries Paul, with all that botox you have injected, no chance of that star ever falling. Can I say yikes again? 
 Back to clowns…I know there are some lovely clowns out there. Red Skelton for instance. He was the right kind of clown. He could sing, dance and make you laugh with general silliness. I loved him when I was a child. Never once did I think Red would kidnap me, turn me into mincemeat and eat me for breakfast. I was even okay with Ronald McDonald. Sure he has been poisoning me since I was old enough to chew a French fry, but I can live in denial on that because I love his large sized fountain diet Cokes. How does he do it!? The Hamburglar is way creepier than Ronald anyway. He spoke gibberish and walked a little Nosferatu-ishly. I could really have done without him. However, I do often wonder what happened to him. Ronald seems to be the only McDonald’s character to have survived the 80’s. 
 So many poor clowns out there just want to make people, especially children laugh. But all they do is make them cry. And wish they’d never asked for that damned balloon animal in the first place. Then John Wayne Gacy came along and took all the dignity the clowns were clinging to, away completely. So. Not. Fair. Poor Bozo. He was a nice clown. His ratings had to suffer after all the bad clown press. Before Gacy, the clown world had Pagliacci to thank for their bad rep. Pagliacci was one of those Italian clowns with the poofy white holiday decoration collar and the cone hat with the ball on the end. Just kidding. I have no idea what the hell Pagliacci looked like. Truth be told, all I really know about Pagliacci is what I saw in the movie The Untouchables and the Seinfeld epidsode with crazy Joe Davola. Sigh. I’m not as worldly as I’d like to be. The only foreign clown I know, I know from an American movie and an American TV show. I think Kim Jong-il is a clown though. Does that count? 
 Although I can see why some people have doll and clown phobias, I’m not really worried about Raggedy Ann or Bozo. I have a bigger fear of bears. Oh why is that? Probably has to do with the fact that those carnivore fuckers will maul you in a second. Forget about camping while on your period. You’re just asking for trouble.   You may as well make a sign that says,“Hey Smokey, I dare you to try to put out this cigarette. Go on…coward! People = Number 1. Bears = Number 11. Right behind the Hyenas.”Now nothing pisses a bear off more than being told they are lowly compared to a hyena. I can’t say I blame them. Hyenas are nature’s assholes. They are weasels with a little bit of power. I can’t like them. And thanks to The Lion King, I don’t like Whoopi Goldberg or Cheech anymore either. 
 But bears freak me out. I think they are just amazingly beautiful creatures. But I have had nightmares about them for over 20 years. As much as I loved Grizzly Adams in his day, I just can’t get on board with the bear whispering. Uh newsflash Grizzly, ummm, you may think the bears are your friends but Werner Herzog will tell you differently. (Or he’ll let you hear the audio he did not share with the rest of us in Grizzly Man.) Wild animals will turn on you as quickly as dolls and clowns. I promise. I will keep my camping in New Zealand where I only have to tend with hedgehogs and Kiwi birds. P.S. a fear of bears is called Melissophobia. Don’t ask me where that name came from. 
 Which brings me to my final phobia of the blog. Ligyrophobia: Fear of loud noises. I can actually condense this fear into a certain type of loud noise. Popping sounds. I hate latex balloons (because they can pop), opening champagne (I have never opened a bottle), those teeny little sperm shaped fireworks that you throw at people’s feet on the 4 th of July, and I hate Pillsbury biscuits. I carefully pull the paper back waiting for the damned can to pop but nothing ever happens. It’s like a Jack-in-the-Box. Then I have to start banging it against the kitchen counter never knowing when the thing is going to make the loud pop. I HATE IT! It is a nerve-wracking experience every single time. I just don’t like sudden loud noises. Never been a fireworks fan, never will be. Never been a skeet shooter, never will be. Never been a storm chaser, never will be. Never been the guy who shoots the pop gun to start a Track and Field race, never will be. I like my loud noise planned. I’ve been to a Metallica concert more than twice. I expect and welcome loud noise there. (And I realize just how badly I’ve dated myself.) My point is, at the target range or the racetrack, I am prepared. But don’t be blowing shit into my eardrums…I can’t take it. 
 See, I told you I wouldn’t get deep. We all have our phobias. Some are very serious and some are comical. My question is, is FDR correct when he says,“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself?”Hell if I know. What I do know though is that whenever I hear the recording that plays his famous speech, I get the heebie jeebies because it sounds all ancient and spooky-like. See–sometimes fears come in the most innocuous places. Speaking of phobias–anyone know the scientific term for fear of Gary Busey’s teeth?

 By George, I think He&apos;s Screwing With Star Wars Again 
 
 Anyone who knows me well knows that I am a die-hard movie fan. I could happily go to the cinema every single weekend. I used to think that I could only ever love another who was as movie crazy as I was. Until I fell in love with a die-hard rugby fan and had his babies. Then I realized,“you know, thank goodness I didn’t marry a movie fan, because who would take care of these children so that I could continue my movie obsession?”So it all worked out. 
 Anyway, my favorite film going experience in my entire 39 years of film going experiences occurred at the end of May in 1983. Yep, that’s when Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi premiered at this amazing old theater called the“Eastwood”on the East side of our town. The Eastwood Theater was the Margo Channing of movie theaters, it had it all until the scheming Eve Harrington’s of the theater world   (AKA multiplexes) came in and invalidated the one-screen movie houses. But they could not top the original - great sound, an amazing 70mm screen and a projectionist who knew how to frame a film. This was the place to see a movie in our town in the 70’s and early 80’s. 
 So my dear mother bought us tickets to the midnight premiere of Return of the Jedi even though it was a school night. My memories may be deceiving me a bit, but I’m almost positive it was a Thursday night at the end of the school year. I was a fifth grader. We had to stand in a line that wrapped around the parking lot, but we weren’t worried about getting in because my smart mother bought our tickets in advance. She didn’t want to crush her beyond excited children who would never forgive her if she failed us on this one. A Princess Leia and a Darth Vader stood in line ahead of us, which just added to our anticipation. It was the first time I had ever seen people wear costumes to a movie. (This was 5 years prior to my Rocky Horror Picture Show phase.) Today, the geeks come out in costumed droves for movie premieres! Not unusual at all. 
 After we took our seats and got through the previews, the famous 20 th Century Fox logo and musical intro appeared on screen, which gave me instant chills. People were already cheering when John Williams’musical masterpiece filled the theater with its glorious sound. Every seat was filled and every eye was glued to the enormous screen. The beauty of 1983 was that you were not ever going to be interrupted with a telephone ring tone during a movie. Sure you’d hear whispers and whiny children as much as you do now. But no flashing lights or sounds from mobile phones. It was fantastic. A true escape from the outside world. The only noise in that theater that night was cheering every time one of our beloved characters made their Return of the Jedi debut. 
 Darth Vader was first. He was the ultimate villain that we all loved to hate, and he got a nice round of applause. C3PO and R2D2 were second. Applause. Lando and Chewbacca were next. Applause. Leia freed Han. Applause. Luke performed a Jedi mind trick on that serpent faced Bib Fortuna. Applause. The whole gang was back together. It was like a family reunion only this one would end with the untimely yet not so tragic death of Boba Fett. Didn’t see that one coming. Jabba’s lair segment was as entertaining as a movie could get. From the annoying but comical little runt, Salacious Crumb to the ferocious head heavy monster the Rancor, George Lucas got it right. All of the characters were fun to watch. Even the dumb looking blue Babar on keyboards, a clear sign Lucas was running out of character ideas, was tolerable. Miles more tolerable than some of the creations to come in the future of the series. 
 The movie had great battle scenes in the beginning, middle and end. The special effects were amazing and there wasn’t one drop of CGI. Nope. Just a lot of talented people from Industrial Light&amp;Magic. And magic they made. The great battle to destroy the almost complete new Death Star is one of the best achievements in special effects I have ever seen, and it stands the test of time in my humble opinion. Lando and that fishfaced guy (who even C3PO and his &quot;6 million forms of communication&quot; cannot understand) in the Millennium Falcon, with help from the great Admiral Ackbar, destroyed the new Death Star and brought the excitement to its peak. Speaking of Admiral Ackbar, I am convinced he is Tori Spelling’s biological father. Look at the photos if you don’t believe me. Candy Spelling isn’t talking, but I have a sneaking suspicion about what she was doing and who she was doing it with during the late summer of 1972. 
 So Darth Vader turned good, Luke and Leia turned out to be siblings, Han and Leia confessed their love, Chewbacca made some new Ewok friends, and C3PO and R2D2 remained“best friends”. All was well on the Moon Endor when the credits rolled. It was a perfect blast. 
 BUT, apparently George Lucas can’t stop tinkering with his toys. And because he can’t stop tinkering with his toys, he is adding more crap to the new blue ray edition of Episode VI. In the original, Darth Vader watched as the Emperor tried to destroy Luke with his lightning bolt fingers. You could see the inner struggle within Darth as he turned to look at his son dying, then back at the Emperor, then back at his son and so on until he stood up, reached for the Emperor and tossed him over the rail to his death. Vader did not need to utter a word for the audience to get the power of that scene. But Mr. Lucas doesn’t agree. He has added a couple of“No’s”for Darth Vader to howl before and after he reaches for the Emperor. Sigh. It doesn’t fit. It doesn’t make sense and it’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard of. 
 I understand, George is probably salivating over all of the advances in film technology. So I say,“Create something new George! Leave your Sci-Fi masterpiece trilogy alone!”Sure some of the fight scenes seem a little cheesy when compared to The Matrix style of fighting that populates current films. And poor Luke does look a bit sloppy with that light saber when you compare his moves with the moves of the characters in the prequels. Whereas CGI Yoda in Episode II is flyin around like a little green Jackie Chan, Luke looks like a 9 year old determined to be the kid who splits open the birthday party piñata during his final fight with Darth Vader. But none of that should matter. It doesn’t mean George should replace Mark Hamil with Andy Serkis in front of a green screen. (Although after seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I’m sure George is tempted.) 
 I can accept (although with a tiny bit of grumbling), the additions of other creatures, and even the musical changes in both Jabba’s palace and during the celebration on Endor. I can accept (with a larger amount of grumbling), the replacement of old Anakin with young Anakin at the end of that same Endor celebration. However, the addition of these“No’s”makes me want to slap George over the head with my giant Rancor doll. I wish he’d just leave well enough alone. Accept that at the time, 1983, this was the best that cinema had to offer in action, adventure and special effects. It is not a 21 st century movie, and it never will be. And that’s okay. Someone tried remaking Psycho once and look how well that turned out. So George, I thank you and appreciate all you have done for the world of movies. Please be satisfied with your accomplishments and please, I implore you, listen to Paul McCartney when he says, &quot;Let. It. Be.&quot;

 When Celebrities Had Talent 
 
 On the morning of the vulgar Kardashian wedding exhibition that is sure to saturate the news this weekend, I am sitting here longing for the time when the only weddings that made the news were Royal weddings, Kennedy weddings or Elizabeth Taylor weddings. Interest in those weddings made sense to me. The fascination with these talentless celebrities of the Reality TV age though completely baffles me. I don’t get it. What is so interesting about a spoiled girl with a big bum who garishly flaunts her material possessions and her boyfriends for hungry US Weekly readers while having no claim to fame other than her father was friends with a famous ex football player turned movie star turned wife killer and her mother is married to an Olympic athlete turned crypt keeper look-a-like? (huh eh huh eh huh…that’s me panting. Should have taken a breath while writing that sentence.) Really though, I want to know. Because I think the whole thing is BORING. 
 Perhaps as I approach middle age, I am turning into one of those out of touch old“bitties”. You know, those old people who yell at you for acting your age or for walking too close to their overly manicured lawns. I don’t think so though. I may be a teeny bit out of touch with some things but I still got some spunk dammit. I just think what passes as entertainment today is as dull as those rusty old toe nail scissors on the top shelf of my bathroom closet that will surely cause my big toe to fall off from gangrene if I try to use them again. Dull and harmful. Harmful to our brain cells that are just trying to cling to this life of“fast, cheap and out of control”! 
 Back to sounding like an old fart who complains (while shaking his fist) about“you kids today!”I really miss when a celebrity was a real star. Talent and moxie and interesting looks and did I mention talent? Now anyone (and when I say anyone, I mean a16 year old boy) with a video camera and a Dorothy Hamill haircut can cut a youtube video and become Beatle-esque in his mania. The kid looks like he needs a babysitter yet is all over the magazines on fancy balconies vacationing with his Disney girlfriend. Not that I read“those”magazines. I just accidentally walk past them when I am visiting my mother’s. And then a light wind blows past so that the page turns again and again. I can’t figure out why my mom’s house is so breezy but before I know it, I’ve gone through the entire magazine…accidentally. 
 I’m not really sure what started all of this famous for nothing crap. Was it MTV’s 90’s show The Real World? Was it the Bee Girl in the Blind Melon video? Was it Survivor? Was it George Hamilton’s tan? Maybe it was Clara Peller’s“Where’s the Beef?”She was a huge celebrity for that 30 seconds of TV time. She was likable at least. But I only say that because she was a funny old lady. For all I know she was a real bitch. I guess it doesn’t matter. What matters is that the Elizabeth Taylors and Paul McCartneys of the world have been replaced by the Kim Kardashians and Justin Biebers. In fairness to Justin, at least he tries to sing. I mean he is singing songs. He’s not just walking around L.A. while a video camera catches his every shallow move. 
 Speaking of Elizabeth Taylor. Sure the tabloids loved her. Sure she flaunted her jewels and her fancy lifestyle. BUT she still had talent, class and real beauty. Okay, well maybe the cheating with your friend’s husband is classless but Debbie forgave her, we can too. She wasn’t just a pretty face mugging for any camera. She was a true actress. Just watch Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf if you want to see acting at its best. The woman had it and her philanthropy only made her more appealing. So when I read an editor to Life&amp;Style magazine (consider the source Meredith…consider the source) call Kim Kardashian“our people’s princess,”on CNN’s entertainment page that shares space with ads promoting aid for starving children, I can’t help but hope that every camera malfunctions so that we get badly framed and blurry photos for all the celeb rags. Since that won’t happen, I will do the mature thing and take a black pen to all of the magazine photos that will be at my mom’s house and give her and the wedding party gapped snaggle teeth and black eyes, and I’ll place moles in unappealing places. I hold the power with my black pen you Kardashians!! I used to do that all the time when I was a child. Take black pens to People and Cosmopolitan magazines. Everyone was ugly by the time I got through with them. Occasionally I gave them black eyeliner and red marker lips to try to make them pretty, but mostly I desecrated their Herb Ritts shots. In fairness to me, I did wait until my family was finished reading them before I wielded the black pen of destruction. I’m pretty sure poor Cheryl Tiegs got the worst of it back then. But at least Cheryl was a legitimate model who had every right to be in those magazines. 
 I’m hard on the Kardashians. They may be lovely people for all I know. But my mother is lovely people too. And if I had to see her at every single grocery store check out aisle, and hear about her every time I turned on the boob tube or read about her every time I opened up my yahoo page, I’d be sick of her too. Kim…oh Kim. You are a pretty girl with a smoking voluptuous figure, but I wish you’d give up the“reality”job and get a“real”job. And soon....please.
