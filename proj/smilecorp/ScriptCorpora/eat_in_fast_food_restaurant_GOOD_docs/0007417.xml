Culver&apos;s: Cheese Curds and Butterburgers
 
 
A popular snack food in Wisconsin is fried cheese curds. Cheese curds are the byproduct of the cheese making process, and until recently could only be enjoyed where the production happens. Now, at last, lovers of these wonderful balls of magical cheesy goodness can enjoy them locally, at Culvers, in Florence, Kentucky.

Beyond the Fried Cheese Curds, Culvers reputation grew around the Butterburger. A bit of research revealed that the name“Butterburger”stems from the grilled butter bun, but the burgers remain the star attraction, made from fresh, never-frozen 100 percent U.S. beef, and topped with your choice of condiments and Swiss, cheddar or American cheese. They are served with a side, and cheese curds are the obvious choice, but there&apos;s also the option to choose such items as French fries or a side salad, that&apos;s composed of a variety of crisp greens, carrots, tomato, cheese, croutons, and choice of dressing.

Order at the counter, like a typical fast food restaurant, but notice that the expansive menu mounted on the wall offers some atypical fast food choices, like fish, shrimp, chicken and pot roast. There are also 8-snackpak meals for under $4.

After you order, fill your drink cup, and sit back and relax. The restaurant has a variety of booths and tables, and you can angle yourself to watch TVs with the sports or shows for the kids. Additionally, patio seating invites guests to enjoy fresh air under large, shady umbrellas.

Save room for dessert and enjoy Culvers custard in a cone, as part of a scrumptious sundae, or stirred in with candy or cookies as a Culver’s Concrete Mixer.

 HelloCincinnati Tip: Culver’s is located on a busy highway, and exiting can be tricky. Be sure to follow the signs that direct drivers to a traffic light, rather than risking a dangerous crossing over five lanes.
