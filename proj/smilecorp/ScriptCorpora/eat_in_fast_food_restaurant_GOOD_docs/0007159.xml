 Posted: Sat Jan 31, 2004 10:19 am     Post subject: National Fast Food/Restaurant Coupons B1G1 FREE Hello,
I just signed up for this forum because i happen to be searching for Clorox bleach coupons. I thought I would let everyone know what I have available. I ususaly sell these on auction sites and do very well. I am open to trading them though. I do not have a wish list put together yet, seems like a lot of work! I don&apos;t have a lot of time for cutting out coupons but I like to find ones I especially use regularly.

I HAVE:
All my coupons are BUY 1 GET 1 FREE or 50% OFF 1
I have almost all the major fast food chains. They are accepted nationwide. I have saved tons of money using them myself. I usualy have every one listed below at any given time.
