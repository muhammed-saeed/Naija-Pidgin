Barbie Takes On Menu Labeling
 In March 2010, Congress passed a national law requiring chain restaurants with 20 or more outlets to list calories and other nutrition information on menus and menu boards. The FDA has proposed menu labeling regulations, which should be final in 2012. You should start seeing nutrition information in most chain restaurants soon.

Americans eat out more than ever before; eating out provides one-third of the calories in American’s diets. And, studies link eating out with obesity. Without clear, easy-to-use nutrition information at the point of ordering, it’s difficult to make informed and healthy choices.

States and localities can support menu labeling and enhance its effectiveness by conducting campaigns and education programs to encourage healthy eating at restaurants and the use of the available nutrition information.

Also, menu labeling at chain restaurants is a good start, but cities and states could expand access to nutrition information to more restaurants. A good next step is to provide menu labeling on state or local property, such as in cafeterias in government office buildings, publically funded hospitals, state universities, road-side rest stops, and state park concessions.
