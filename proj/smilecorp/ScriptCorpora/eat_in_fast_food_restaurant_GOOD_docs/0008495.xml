 Silent Hill: Shattered Memories Hidden Bonuses 


 Telephone Numbers Mementos Haunted Objects Camera Ghosts UFOs 


 Bonus Item Overview 

There are multiple types of bonus items: mementos, haunted objects, camera ghosts, and UFOs. These are all optional things that aren&apos;t directly useful to Harry, but they reveal additional details about the game&apos;s world, and they reflect the current playing style (and ultimately the ending). All of them are located in the exploration parts and other safe areas, so don&apos;t worry about looking for them during the icy death nightmares.

Mementos are various trinkets that can be picked up. They are all hidden in various kinds of containers. To view the mementos that have been collected, go to the pause menu, and choose the mementos option. (With the Wii controls, press the Remote&apos;s 1 Button.)

Haunted objects can be triggered simply by being touched. They cause the flashlight to flicker and make extremely noticeable humming noises, which grow the loudest when the cursor is pointed directly at them (like with the enemies during icy death nightmares).

Camera ghosts can be photographed with the mobile phone&apos;s camera function. They appear as unmoving, shadowy apparitions that leave scratchy distortions on the screen, but they don&apos;t make loud static noises at first. Successfully photographing a camera ghost is sufficient; saving the snapshot afterward isn&apos;t required.

UFOs are the small flying saucers, and they&apos;re associated with the series&apos; running joke with space aliens. After finishing the game at least once, when replaying the game with the same profile, United Fruitcake Outlet (UFO) signs will replace some billboards in the first chapter. To enable the UFO challenge, dial the UFO telephone number (555-3825) as soon as the mobile phone becomes available. The UFOs are similar to camera ghosts, except they are fully visible, and they disappear after Harry enters and then leaves their areas, making them easy to miss forever. As with camera ghosts, successfully photographing a UFO is enough; saving the snapshot afterward isn&apos;t mandatory. Photograph all 13 flying saucers and then finish the game to get the UFO ending.
