Great food, great place

Provided by Judy&apos;s Book 

The Pad Restaurant is a local fast food restaurant with two locations in Topeka . The Pad is clean and the help is friendly. There is a wide selection of menu items, including several different kinds of sugar free pie. The food is very affordable. The hamburgers are the best in town. This is casual and a great place to take your family.

The Pad Has Great Food

Provided by Judy&apos;s Book 

We love this restaurant! It is a little higher than the &quot;average&quot; fast-food place but the quality is much better than &quot;average&quot;! The pad has a great salad bar with wonderful soups. One of the nicest things we enjoy about The Pad is the cleanliness! I feel it is the cleanest fast-food restaurant in Topeka !
