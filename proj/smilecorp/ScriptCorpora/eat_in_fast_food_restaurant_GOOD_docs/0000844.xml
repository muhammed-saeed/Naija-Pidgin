Rude, Rude, Rude, by any standard
 I came by the Popeye’s around 6:00 today and ordered popcorn shrimp and a large mashed potatoes. I waited a long while for my order and when I arrived at my destination, ready to eat, I found that I was not given cocktail sauce in the shrimp, napkins, or a spoon for my mashed potatoes. I was not asked if I would like any of these items, and based on my past experiences at other Popeyes I have never had to ask for cocktail sauce or a spoon. I called at 6:15 and spoke with a manager, I explained the situation to her and she asked if I could come back right now and I said no and she said that I could come back by and get a replacement of my meal and she was very nice. Note, she did not write my name down. I asked her if I needed to write anything down and she said no. I come back, receipt in hand at about 8:40 and I am told that nobody there took that phone call and they denied it. When I spoke to the manager she told me that there was a new girl and she probably messed up. When I brought that up to her, they still denied that I called, even though I wouldn’t have known that otherwise. I noticed that the same people were there from 6:00 too. They said that all they could do was give me napkins, condiments, and a spoon even though it was clearly their fault and they did so very rude like. The manager did not even talk to me or tell me sorry for my experience, she avoided the situation like the plague. They literally gave me a bag with a spoon, napkins and cocktail sauce and seemed very agitated that I would even bring up my experience with them. I couldn’t believe it, she did not handle the situation properly at all, by any company’s standards. And I had to ask for my receipt back so that I could call corporate. Link To Review
