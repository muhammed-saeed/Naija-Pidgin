 Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan .

 Understand 

 Baku , also known as Baky or Bakı , is the largest city in the Caucasus and the capital of Azerbaijan . Baku is on the coast of the Caspian Sea on the southern tip of the Absheron Peninsula. There are three major divisions in Baku: İçəri Şəhər (the ancient city), the Soviet built city, and the newest part of the city. The population as of January 2003 was 2,074,300.

 Climate 

A curious fact about Baku is that its average year-round temperature (14.2°C/57.6°F)) matches the average temperature of the entire landmass of the earth to within a tenth of degree. Summers are hot and humid, winters cool, wet and breezy. However, seasonal temperature excursions are less than in many continental regions at this latitude (about 40 degrees north) owing to the presence of the Caspian Sea.

 Get in 

 By plane 
 Fortress gate in Baku 
 Heydar Aliyev International Airport [1] ( IATA : GYD ) is situated 25 km (15 mi) from Baku city center. It is served by major airlines including Aeroflot, Austrian Airlines, BMI, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways, and a whole host of smaller airlines. The least expensive way to get between Baku and Europe is via Aeroflot, with inexpensive flights to/from Moscow daily. Air Baltic also offers flights with good prices from/via Riga.

Bus N16 runs between the airport and Samed Vurgun Park, in the heart of Baku. The trip costs 1AZN and takes over an hour.

Minibus 135 runs between the airport traffic circle (15-min walk from the airport) and the 28 May Metro Station. The journey takes an hour and costs 0.40AZN.

Getting a smooth ride from the airport to town can be a hassle. The lowest price you can get for a taxi to the center should be around 15 Manat (old Lada, unmarked taxi). Be aware that there is one single taxi company that is allowed to officially do business at the airport. This monopoly drives up the price to nearly 50 Manat and many times it leaves you with no other options, especially when arriving at late hours. Police occasionally force out all cab drivers trying to do business on the fringes of the airport, leaving you stuck with a high fare. Taxis don&apos;t have meters so you must negotiate in advance. If you are not finding a reasonable price, go out of the airport, past the taxi stand, and ask the cabbies in the far end of the parking lot. Be cautious since the majority of Baku cabs are unmarked. Don&apos;t let the cab driver renegotiate the price with you. It is a common trick to ask for much more on arrival to your destination. You are not obligated to pay what they demand.

For 5 Manat you can take a cab from the airport to Metro Azizbeyov. From there it&apos;s four to six stations to the city center - but only from 6AM until midnight.

 By train 

Overnight trains are avalible from Russia and Ukraine on a regular basis. Moscow (60 h) has departures three times a week, there is also a once-weekly train leaving Saint Petersburg (70 h) on Sundays. Other cities with less frequent connections include Novosibirsk (80 h) and Yekaterinburg (75 h). Kiev (68 h) has a service leaving every Saturday, with carriges added from several other cities. Also, on some occasions there is a direct train from the Belarusian city of Brest (81 h) which also stops in Minsk (76 h). However, it is important to note that the border between Russia and Azerbaijan is closed for non-CIS nationals for the forseeable future. So unless you&apos;re a resident of a former Soviet country then this journey is impossible.

Now, there are still ways of getting here by train for a westerner. There is an overnight sleeper from Tbilisi in neighboring Georgia leaving three times a week. Journey times is 17 hours. The train makes stop-overs in Lankaran , Sheki , Xachmaz and Ganja . A journey in second class from Tbilisi will set you back 58 laris.

Domestic trains are very cheap, most journeys cost less then 3AZN which makes it cheaper then staying in an hostel.

 By bus 

Buses run between Baku and Lankaran (departs: 11:50AM, 3PM, 4PM, 5PM), Sheki (hourly, 4AZN, 7-hr trip). International buses also operate from destinations in Iran , Turkey and from Tbilisi. A common rule of thumb for bus rates in Azerbaijan seems to be about 1AZN per hour ride. Example: Agstafa is about 7 or 8 hours away from Baku. About 8AZN.

 By minibus 

Minbuses operate between Baku and Sheki (6 hr), Lankaran (5 hr), Xachmaz (3 hr), Saatli (5 hr), and Imishli (4 hr).

 By ferry 

The phone number of the sea terminal ( Daniz Vagzal ) is 994 12 447 7314.

Ferries operate between Baku and Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan , (Irregularly, approximately every 7-10 days), and Turkmenbashi , Turkmenistan (steerage bed, US$50, 2-day trip, bring food).

Make sure you have appropriate visas before embarking, if necessary.

 By bike 

Baku is a great town to get around in by bicycle. Except for the up-town, the city, including old town ( İçəri Şəhər ) and down-town is fairly flat, and though there are some streets that are dangerous to ride, there is almost always a safe, fast route to your destination.

While there are no separate bike lanes on the streets, and cars and cyclists often share narrow streets of Baku, the city is very bike-friendly. While cycling on the street, be very careful watch out for other cyclists, always keep closer to foot-walk side of the street, and show other traffic where you are going (e.g., by holding out your hand) in order to avoid accidents and smoothen the traffic flow.

A pleasant way to cover a lot of ground is to rent a bicycle. Make sure to get a good lock (or two), and to use it. If you are looking for a city (road), mountain or trekking bicycle, then there is a bicycle rental shop at the city centre called MyBike ( address : Asef Zeynalli Street, Ichari Shahar ). If you want to know the best routes, you should get a copy of the beautifully designed Baku by Bike plan, which is available at all bike rental points of MyBike. Bike costs about 10-20AZN per day (approximately, AZN 1 = €1, as of 2012).

A passport or identity card must be shown and a refundable deposit is required. While this service is quite convenient, be sure to bring ID or passport and contact information, including hotel phone number, to speed up the paperwork.

 By bus/minibus 

Buses and minibuses cost 0.20AZN per person and can take you to almost any place within Baku. Destinations are usually posted on the front and the right side of the bus.

 By metro 
 Baku metro 
The metro goes many places throughout Baku and it costs only 0.20AZN. It is the least expensive way to get around Baku besides walking. Ask a cashier or attendant. You must obtain a Bakı Metropiliten Kart (2AZN refundable deposit) and load it like a normal metro pass. Alternatively, you can use a Azerbaycan Sosial Kartı like the ones on some Azerbaijani ATM cards. The metro workers will be more than happy to help if spoken to in either Azeri or Russian, and some may understand English.

Be careful when transferring trains at the transfer stations (28 May and Jafar Jabbarli) as the signage is not easy to spot.

There have been reports of people being arrested while taking photographs of the metro station.

 By train 

The Baku electric train runs through several parts of Baku and the surrounding area including Sumqait. 1AZN.

 On foot 

It is possible to get around Fountain Square, the Boulevard, and the old city by foot, but the entire city cannot be covered on foot.

 Talk 

English and Russian are spoken in many places throughout Baku, but it wise to still either bring an Azeri phrase book and/or brush up on your Azeri/Turkish/Russian before arriving. However, about 80% of population at least understands Russian, and about half the people under the age of 35 will speak at least a little English.

English is well catered for in most shops, restaurants and bars as a result of 15+ years of expats from the oil industry. Very easy to make yourself understood with little local language skills.

 Drink 
 
 A Cultural Note 

Although tea houses ( çay xanalar ) in Baku usually allow Western women to enter, in the regions, it is often forbidden for females to enter such establishments. Women drinking in Baku is a la mode, but it is taboo for women in the regions of Azerbaijan to consume alcohol.
 
 Tea Houses ( Çayxanalar ) 

There are many outdoor tea houses ( çayxanalar ) that serve tea and sweets to people in their own individual nooks. Going to them can be a great way to get a sense of the local culture. If you are adventurous, try challenging a local Bakuvian to a game of backgammon (nard) or dominoes.

 Cafés 

There is a good selection of cafés dispersed throughout Baku. Expect to pay Western prices for your coffee.

 Internet 

Internet cafes in Azerbaijan are called &quot;internet klubs&quot; and they are found throughout Baku. Some coffee houses provide wireless internet, but they are quite rare in Baku. Recently public wi-fi service was implemented the central areas. One &quot;klub&quot; with fast internet downtown is VIP, U.Bunyadzade 3. They also have a lot of games you can play.

 Post office 
 Azerpost Office 
Azerbaijan Post locations are dispersed throughout Baku. Mailing an international letter generally costs 0.8AZN.

 AZAL 

As Azal seems to be in a permanent state of flux as to where their offices are located, pop into a travel agent and ask about tickets very carefully before buying anything. In some cases, like Naxcevan or last-minute flights, you WILL ABSOLUTELY have to go this every-moving central office during a few random opening times in order to get your tickets processed. One travel agent who can guide you buy phone is reachable at +994 55 4201220 or +99412 5551320 or 5981619.

 Stay safe 

Baku is considered a safe city, nevertheless common sense is useful as in all other big cities. Homeless people do not harass or attack people and are very safe to be around. The biggest problem in Baku is driving. Many drivers do not obey rules and speed.

 Emergency contact numbers 

 Ambulance: 103 Fire: 101 Gas Emergency 104 Speaking Clock 106 Police: 102 

You must speak in Azeri, Turkish or Russian to communicate your needs. It would be a good idea to memorize key phrases before coming to Azerbaijan - see the Talk section for phrasebooks.

 Safety tips 

The roads can be treacherous at night due to unseen potholes and dimly lit cars. Most areas in and near the downtown are mostly safe. Try to stay away from the outskirts.

 Get out 

 The Petroglyphs of Gobustan are nearby to the South, and date back as far as the 12th century BCE. The invading armies of Alexander the Great and Trajan also left some interesting grafitti. 

 A ferry departs daily from Baku across the Caspian Sea to Turkmenbashi , Turkmenistan . This ferry has become somewhat of a sleeper hit with backpackers on the Silk Road, but is very uncomfortable and should only be taken by adventure-seekers. 

 A ferry depart irregularly to Aktau in Kazakhstan (every 7-10 days maybe). Docks are located 2 km to the west of the old town. It is difficult to get tickets! 

 Sheki , which is a 7 hour bus ride to the north, is a beautiful city in the Caucasus mountains with lots to see and do. 

 Buses take international travelers onwards from Baku to Iran and Georgia . 

 The Baku Airport is one of the few in the world offering flights to Nakhchivan and travelers heading that way should book a flight from here. 

 Go and enjoy the oil baths of Naftalan . 

 Relax by the Caspian in Nabran , Azerbaijan&apos;s biggest tourist destination for international travelers and a coastal city close to Xachmaz .
