 Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed is a patented hose-end feeder that really takes the guesswork out of feeding because it automatically dilutes and applies concentrated liquid plant food evenly and accurately, with no mixing, no measuring and no mess. The starter kit comes complete with one refill bottle of LiquaFeed plant food . Makes plant feeding as easy as watering! Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed is a patented hose-end feeder that really takes the guesswork out of feeding because it automatically dilutes and applies concentrated liquid plant food evenly and accurately, with no mixing, no measuring and no mess. Just attach the sprayer to your hosepipe, turn on the tap and water your plants. It has 3 spray settings, making it ideal for use all around the garden. Simply screw a bottle of LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food into the sprayer and it becomes an automatic feeder. Turn the switch to FEED and away you go, feeding all your garden plants. The feed The Miracle-Gro formula is carefully balanced to provide plants with all the essential nutrients required for optimum growth and flowering. It works fast - plants are greener and faster growing within 2 weeks, and Miracle-Gro helps plants to be more resistant to drought by developing a strong root system. No mixing, no measuring, no mess! Forget about mixing and measuring. One convenient ready-to-use refill bottle will feed the average sized garden of 40 sq.m and will take around 20 minutes to empty, depending on water pressure. The refill bottles have leak-proof closures that cannot drip concentrate while being fitted into the LiquaFeed sprayer and there&apos;s no risk of over-feeding or burning your plants because the concentrate is evenly dissolved throughout the feeding process, from full to empty.

 Fast Food Panic! 

 Advantages: Fun, mini games are good
 Disadvantages: Repetitive, bad tutorials


...The thought of playing a restaurant simualtion game may not appeal to many if anyone at all, but something about the unique look of this title, Fast Food Panic, on the Nintendo Wii certainly intrgiued me so I ended up buying it for 15 and my opinions on the title are very mixed. Although very very far from being the worst Wii title I have played, this is not something I can see lasting a long time but there are certainly a heap of fun elements in there. Obviously its not a 100% realistic simulation as that would make for a very dull title indeed so everything is cranked up. The graphics and basic presentation are good for wii standards and it all looks colourful, vibrant and interesting. However in the main game there are some flaws and my biggest bug bear starts the second you load the game. Straight...
