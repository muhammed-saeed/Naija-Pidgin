Welsh traders and shoppers adjust to 5p bag charge

Most of the traders and shoppers on Machynlleth High Street support the new law, but there is still an air of rebellion

The sun is out, the market is packed but there is an air of rebellion among the stallholders on Machynlleth High Street in mid- Wales .

&quot;It&apos;s a ridiculous, stupid law,&quot; says David Parry, vender of all kinds of household goods – pots of paint, rope, cigarette lighters. &quot;I&apos;m going to find a way round it. We all will.&quot;

From Saturday, Wales will become the first country in the UK to force retailers to charge for single-use carrier bags.

From the largest supermarkets to the most modest corner store or market stall, shopkeepers will be compelled to charge customers at least 5p for the convenience of taking their goods home in a disposable bag.

&quot;I&apos;m not going to charge customers who are spending £10 an extra 5p for a bag to put the goods in,&quot; says Parry. &quot;I&apos;ll just knock 5p off the price of the goods. I don&apos;t think the government should be treating us like children. People should be able to choose how they take their goods home.&quot;

 David Cameron may have talked tough on single-use bags this week, warning retailers that he may introduce new laws if supermarkets do not take action to reduce their usage.

But the Welsh assembly has got in already. The first minister, Carwyn Jones, has been meeting shopkeepers and shoppers to explain why his country is leading the battle against the bags.

Jones called single use bags a &quot;blight on our landscape&quot; and a &quot; waste of natural resources&quot;. His government believes that last year Welsh people took home an average of 273 bags per household from supermarkets alone.

It says local authorities spent £1m clearing them up and expects the charge to reduce usage by 90%. The money raised will not swell government coffers – instead, retailers will be expected to pass proceeds on to good causes or environmental projects.

In Wales it is not just the supermarkets being targeted. Corner shops, butchers, bakers, hotels, cinemas, hairdressers — every retail premise in short — comes under the law. And it is not just plastic bags that must be paid for but also ones made of paper or even plant material. All waste energy, the Welsh government argues.

There are some exemptions. Tony Riley, who has a fruit and veg stall on Machynlleth market, is confused. &quot;I&apos;m selling loose produce so I&apos;m exempt, aren&apos;t I?&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t think I have to charge, do I?&quot;

He is partly right — food such as fruit, vegetables, fish and meat can be placed into a throwaway bag. But if that bag is put into a carrier bag, that second bag must be paid for. And if someone puts another item into the first bag, say a box of teabags, that would incur a charge.

Many shoppers in Machynlleth – an environmentally aware kind of town – support the law.

&quot;I think it&apos;s great,&quot; says Roy Brookes, who was carrying the goods he had bought in a rucksack. &quot;We have to try to reduce waste and help the environment.&quot; Some stallholders already only provide recycled bags or re-usable ones. &quot;This can only be a good thing,&quot; says Liz Barnes, on the Fresh and Local co-operative stall.

But David Thorne on the Thorne and Son butcher&apos;s stall says he needed to double bag his products to stop blood dripping everywhere. &quot;Where does that leave me? I won&apos;t pass on the charge. It&apos;s not fair – they are targeting the poor old customers again at a time when times are hard.&quot;

He was glad to hear there will be a three-month &quot;settling in&quot; period to allow retailers to get used to the new legislation during which time enforcement action will be avoided. The government argues that it is not trying to make life harder for hard-up consumers but help them to change their habits.

Down at the Spar store, the manager, Chris Richards, was waiting anxiously for the notices that will explain the charge to customers. &quot;They should have arrived from head office by now but there&apos;s no sign of them,&quot; he says.

The Spar has been charging customers 2p a bag (which is donated to charity) for the past year. &quot;I don&apos;t think people will like paying 5p to start but they&apos;ll get used to it,&quot; says Richards. &quot;I think it&apos;s good we are doing things like this for the environment. Anyway, it&apos;ll be an interesting few weeks.&quot;

To charge or not to charge – two examples from the Welsh government

1. You could have loose apples, potatoes and pears in one bag and not have to charge. If you then placed a box of tea bags in there too, you would need to apply the charge.

This is to prevent a loophole in the law. A person cannot put an apple in one bag with lots of other shopping, a potato in another bag with lots of other shopping, a lettuce in another etc and get all their single-use carrier bags for free.

This is also to encourage people to think about their behaviour and habits when using single-use carrier bags. The exemptions are there to ensure food safety and protect the consumer from potential cross-contamination from reusable bags.

2. If you went to a fast food restaurant and purchased a packet of fries and a burger then the fries can be placed in a free bag as they are only part-wrapped and you would not be expected to place these in a reusable bag as there could be some food safety risks. If the burger is also placed in the bag, then the bag would be charged for. This is because it is safe to place wrapped food into a reusable bag and the purpose of these regulations is to change customer behaviour every time they shop and in every situation.

Years ago my mum used to take a shopping bag with her everywhere she went, and the greengrocer would just tip stuff into it. Why is it always so unecessarily complicated whenever the words green or recycling are used?
And who gets the 5p?The Assembly govt is imposing this law so why didn&apos;t they just impose a 5p bag tax? With all proceeds going to whatever - you could involve the public with an annual online vote.
Asking around in my small town, apart from the Co-op none of the people on the till could tell me what will happen to all the money charged for bags. For a lot of shops it&apos;s just an extension of the &apos;bag for life&apos; racket, then.
Yes of course we should all be educated into not using as many plastic bags, but this is just another example of empty gesture, soundbite politics, surely? Like towns declaring themselves &apos;FairTrade&apos;. Sounds and feels good, means very little.

Well the first comment is nothing but ignorant, although understandable given the general lack of reporting of issues here in Wales.

It&apos;s a good policy, poorly executed, but it will work out fine.

I think this is just another way to hit shoppers. What is stupid about this is - they know people cant reuse carrier bags as they often forget to take them when popping out to the shops or to even do a weekly shop - do people who run households seriously have enough time to remember this kind of thing when they have children to raise?

Id also like to point out, that whilst the idea of trying to get people to re-use carrier bags is a great one, this policy, like every other under this government, is really just a way of stealth taxing. If a family has 10 bags of shopping a week and forgets to bring their bags they saved the week before, it is going to be an extra 50p on the journey. If that&apos;s once a week- that is £25 a year - right when the people of this country are desperate.

I recycle all my carrier bags - so how is it fair to make me buy a new one each time?

I realise that this is not just about stealth taxation of the poor for the rich (as everything else this government does). It is also a genuine green initiative but the reality is if you take the average carrier bag and its contents, a carrier bag is nowhere near as bad for the environment as the packaging of the goods within - such as tins, cardboard, plastics etc.. yet this is not tackled strongly enough.

All this is to Cameron is another stealth tax on the poor - and a great soundbite for the rich of the country to make sure the &quot;poorple&quot; pay for the mistakes of the rich and stupid!

As cornerswell says, people used to take shopping bags with them as standard. We&apos;ve just got lazy. I think so long as plastic bags are fully biodegradable they could be free, but shops should be discouraged from using ones that aren&apos;t. Maybe keep the charge for them and don&apos;t charge ones who use, eg, corn starch bags? The butcher quoted in the article is right. Our local butcher uses biodegradable bags precisely for this reason. He only runs a small business, in a rather poor area. If he can do it, anyone can. (and he&apos;s no lefty greeny either!)

Most people take the car when they do their &quot;big shop&quot;. So keep the shopping bags in the car . Simples.

When I go shopping in the local High Street I take strong linen bags with me. Two were bought from the CPRE and two from the British Trust for Ornithology. I like to carry round free adverts for both organisations - even if the bags contain a few bottles of wine! Plastic carriers are just not strong enough for the job.
I do my bulk shopping on-line and it is delivered in BIO DEGRADEABLE carrier bags. I `whip` the bags into the hall and unload them at my leisure. Without bags the trays are taken into the kitchen. It takes ages to unload them and the van sits outside - engine running with pollution coming out of the exhaust pipe! The driver sits and wastes time. On each delivery I return the carriers for recycling! They weigh practically nothing BUT the other surplus packaging on what I buy fills a huge rubbish sack each week. Just one example. A pizza is placed on a polystrene tray [which can not be recycled] then shrink wrapped in polthene and placed in a cardboard box. I can never understand why the pizza can not be put on a cardboard tray with a printed slip/collar before being shrink wrapped. Packaging would be less than 1/4r the current system and would ALL be recyclable. Plastic - biodegradeable - carriers are the least of the problems? Another example is egg boxes. Ones made out of papier mache can be recyled - polystrene one can not. Is there any real logic in any of this? Pringles `tubes` can not be recycled but if they were made of plastic they could be!

Future PM and Royhaines have it: plastic bags are part of the problem/solution, but excessive packaging by manufacturers is also a key issue.

WELL DONE TO WALES. Great! hope. Cost nothing to carry a tupperware like containers for your fish,meat even cheese, counters staff would marveled at it. Be bold Wales embrace it. Find solutions.
No dripping, no summer hovering insects, better for the fridge. NO MORE HEDGE ROWS with plastic bags full of left over lunch rubbish in it. Baby birds eat bits of it and dye.
WHY the average person do not take their refuse with them and dispose it correctly? ??????
I have been making fabric bags for years now. Charity shops are bursting with old curtains and off cuts materials. Please do as I do, make it and offer to your friends,sell it if you want.... HELP. It is a personal decision. But not many people understand it. People are lazy and careless. Sad very sad. The Government is Right to act. It U R G E N T.
The other big one is plastic bottles. Mineral water companies like UK Nestle own Highland spring water and many others, should spearhead it. Selling their water to punters that carry their own containers like beer companies do, barrel it, or set up fountanis across the land. STOP manufacturing disposable plastic bottles please. Or perhaps UK should change its roof tiles for plastic bottles instead. Certainly will last well over 100 years. Would be great, how lovely.... (not).THIS LAND IS OVER SATURATED with it. When will Joe Blogg will wake up for it?

Everywhere i go i have a spare bag with my keys phone and money. it took a little to get into the habit but a spare bag is very easy. if i&apos;m on my bike i will likely have several.
If you use 10 bags you are not walking, you are also not just popping into shops on your way for a loaf and some milk, it&apos;s a full weekly shop. I echo the fact that if having children makes this too hard to remeber (not sure why) then keep them with the loyalty card in the car.
recycling and reusing are different and not interchangable.
you might not think you pay for you bag&apos;s at the moment but you really do, it&apos;s just the cost is spread over everthing as a base line cost and i&apos;m subsidising you at the moment.
So you don&apos;t want to pay £25 a year don&apos;t. it&apos;s a tax you can easily avoid.
If you find this inconveniant and don&apos;t see any benefit for your kids future there are lot&apos;s of choices, including having your food delivered and passing them back the bags immediatly. added bonus it saves on your time and transport.

big supermarkets give extra loyalty points for reusing bags- really i think the prospect of paying an extra £25 a year might be the kick you need to change your behaviuor... isn&apos;t that what it&apos;s there for?

I reuse all my free carrier bags for rubbish so does adding that advice on the bag exempt them as not being single use bags. The amount of plastic in these is miniscule and as Future PM says thers far more plastic (that isn&apos;t recycled because it is mixed with incompatable materials) in the goods packaging. Far better to regulate the packaging of goods. This is just a stealth tax to bail out the good causes the government have robbed.

At last! A sensible use of taxation! Hats off the Welsh, tax doesn&apos;t encourage things, it discourages them.

Maybe you could teach George Osborn a lesson re: Recovery and the 20p VAT rate.

They do oddly enough. And if slippage occurs, increase the tax- This tax has been a roaring success in Ireland, the change has removed the blight of bags caught in trees and fences, stores also supply recycleablebags.
What is the problem with this, some people are incapable os seeing past the words green and tax and thus their prejudice actually prevents them from accepting something which is actually good

Walking through Newmarket as a visitor one day I saw that the local library was selling some good kid&apos;s books (which they shouldn&apos;t be doing anyway). I bought 15 excellent books. I handed the money over and the bloke started doing something else. I asked if I could have a bag to put the books in and was told that Newmarket was a bag free town. Brilliant! He could give me some elastic bands...

OK, Wales is BOTTOM in most of the league tables, education and health are cases in point. BUT, we will have fewer bags to add to the fewer affordable dwellings. Tinkering with some obscure powers under a little know Act while all the devolved powers are not being used effectively, if at all, smacks of desperation to be seen to be doing something, anything at all in fact.

Scrap the Wales Acts, we want to come home to the UK.

The coop to what seemed like little fanfare (http://www.waark.com/2011/09/coop-composting-carrier-bags/) launched a plastic bag which is compostable. They&apos;re brilliant to go into the caddies but I&apos;m a little worried that they don&apos;t have holes for kids/animals who get their heads stuck in them.

They cost 6p from the coop and are given out free if they&apos;re out of normal bags - I buy them because they&apos;re cheaper than normal compostable ones and I don&apos;t litter up my kitchen with manky disolving plastic bags which end up looking like mouse bedding.

I wish they were standard everywhere.
