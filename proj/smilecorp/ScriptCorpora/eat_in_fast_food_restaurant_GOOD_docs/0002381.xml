Behind Staten Island store, bleach whitewashes the misfit toys

STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Somewhere there’s a little girl wishing Santa will bring her a Barbie Peekaboo Place Playset for Christmas.

Just like the brand-new one that was tossed in the Dumpster behind the CVS Pharmacy on Arthur Kill Road in Eltingville Monday afternoon.

Barbie’s Playset wasn’t alone. This Dumpster overflowed with boxes of brand-new toys—toy tableware, an Adventure Play Tent, even brand-new pairs of flip-flop sandals and packets of red, white and blue flag-colored napkins.

There were enough toys to put smiles on several kids’faces, especially kids growing up in a family that can’t afford to smile, let alone shell out a few bucks for Barbie play stuff or a new tent.

Passersby spotted the Dumpster filled with pristine toys in unopened boxes and stopped. Most were Good Samaritans with charity on their minds.

&quot;Christmas is coming, a lot of kids could have them,&quot; said Ann Scamardello, who lives behind the store in Armstrong Gardens and wanted to take the discarded toys to a local church.

One strong whiff of bleach quickly put an end to Ann’s charitable impulse.

And one look at the surly CVS employee marching up to the Dumpster and dumping two jugs of Clorox on the discarded toys killed any thoughts I had of grabbing Barbie’s Peekaboo Playset and making some little girl’s day.

Let’s just say we didn’t have a charitable conversation.

&quot;How come you don’t donate this  stuff?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;They won’t let us,&quot; he said, pouring bleach on anything remotely resembling a box with a toy.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;It’s not up to us.&quot;

I’m no expert on the fine art of pouring bleach on toys in a Dumpster, but it looked pretty plain to me that this CVS store manager was taking it upon himself to destroy somebody else’s plan to grab what had been the store’s discarded markdowns and turn them into a charitable cause.

Waste not, want not, was clearly not in this guy’s vocabulary.

&quot;So no one will take it,&quot; he said.

Customer service at your service.

&quot;We don’t make those decisions,&quot; an assistant manager inside the store said a few minutes later as he stocked frozen food.

&quot;That’s corporate.&quot;

Of course it’s corporate. Who else takes perfectly brand-new toys they can’t sell, tosses them in a Dumpster, then soaks them with bleach so some needy kid can’t have them either?

That’s so corporate, Gordon Gekko would be proud.

&quot;He was following policy by insuring the items were not removed from the Dumpster,&quot; says CVS Pharmacy’s corporate spokesman Mike DeAngelis.

DeAngelis says people have been known to take toys out of the Dumpster, hurt themselves on the toys, then go back and sue CVS for damages.

In corporate lingo, that’s called &quot;creating a liability&quot;—taking products out of a Dumpster which may or may not be safe.

&quot;If it’s been thrown away, we don’t want anyone to get hurt,&quot; DeAngelis says. &quot;We have to protect the liability of the store.&quot;

People have also taken toys out of the Dumpster and returned the toys in a scam to get money back, DeAngelis says, although every time I’ve tried to return something without a receipt, I’ve been told to get lost.

&quot;We as a company do make in-kind product donations to charities on a regular basis,&quot; DeAngelis adds. &quot;In 2009, we gave products worth a total of $46 million to charity. We have more than 7,000 stores nationwide, many of which have relationships with local non-profits.&quot;

In other words, CVS can afford to toss all the Barbie Peekaboo Place Playsets and Adventure Play Tents they want in the Dumpster without batting a corporate eyelash toward little Susie or tiny Timmy.

But what a waste of bleach.

&quot;DeAngelis says people have been known to take toys out of the Dumpster, hurt themselves on the toys, then go back and sue CVS for damages.&quot;

What, they can&apos;t hurt themselves on toys that have been soaked in bleach? Give me a break.

Typical corporate nonsense.

I worked at a fast-food restaurant years back and it was the same thing. At the end of the night if we had left over food we had to dispose of it, instead of perhaps giving to the homeless.

If the corporate buttonheads were looking to CREATE a liability risk, dousing childrens&apos; toys with liquid bleach seems like a good way to go about it. If they did this on the advice of their lawyers, the company needs new lawyers.

This is for the geniuses that work there,...donate the toys to a needy charity or a church that has a giving tree for the holidays! (Newsflash...no one will sue)....grateful parents and kids alike will cry tears of happiness to have something like a new toy for the upcoming holiday season. Also, I really don&apos;t appreciate the sight of an overflowing dumpster, it looks absolutely horrible and makes anyone driving through the neighborhood think the same. Someone should contact the corporate office and make a stink....

I&apos;m not sticking up for CVS, because I don&apos;t really know the whole story here, but I know that sometimes stores are ordered to throw out toys that have been recalled, so maybe thats what happened. I can see why they would&apos;nt want people taking them.

if someone gets hurt from a toy, they sue the manufacturer, not the store that sold the toy. If the toys were recalled, they should be sending them back to the manufacturer.

Yeah there was a recall on the red , white and blue napkins. If someone picked up a toy and used it think about what they could possibly sue for ?? Now think about someone picking up that same toy doused with bleach, lawyers will be lining up for blocks to take that case. I bet CVS will no longer bleach their throwaways.....

Maybe they figured the toys are going to end up in the garbage sooner or later, so the did it sooner. CVS in the mean time have inflated prices on everything else.

My friend worked as a cook for the BOE and she told me they also throw out good food all the time. She said they have to bleach it and mix it in with other garbage because the homeless will come and take it. They even wanted them to put holes in the milk cartons. Im pretty sure they can find a soup kitchen somewhere to take some of the food.

It is also very easy to drop these things off at a Goodwill or Salvation Army store and not leave your name. I work downtown Brooklyn and leave things all the time in the Goodwill store. Also Target makes 3 donations a week to that store. They come with their Target truck and drop the stuff off. Why cant a worker of CVS do the same.

Salvation Army won&apos;t take toys. It&apos;s against their policy because they cannot possibly track all the recalls. I&apos;m not sure about Goodwill, but it&apos;s probably the same story.


It seems to me it would be really easy for CVS and other stores to give to a charity and just have the charity sign an affadavit absolving CVS of any liability.

CVS and any other store that does this should be ashamed of themselves. Hopefully with this article, the policy will change and in this case these toys can go to needy kids. How helpful it would be if other stores like supermarkets donated all of their unsold food to local food banks. With the economy the way it is, there are more and more people that need help.

If someone, including a private sanitaion worker, gets sick or overcome by the fumes, the &quot;corporation&quot; might get a big surprise.

Stellar reporting once again. So, it &apos;looked plain to you&apos; the manager &apos;took it upon himself&apos;?!? Did you ask? You know, like a reporter would? Follow up with a call to corporate? Maybe you should go to TMZ.

And you&apos;ve never been able to return or exchange an item without a receipt? One of the most asinine statements I&apos;ve ever heard. It might not work with a car, or a house, but an unopened and tagged Monopoly game will get you a credit or exchange.

It is a shame that these toys were just thrown away and ruined with bleach when someone could have used them...BUT sad to say, in this day and age where suing is the norm....how can you blame them? If they were recalled toys or if someone takes them and gives them away and someone gets hurt with them, they ARE going to sue CVS. Someone put &quot;newsflash...they won&apos;t sue&quot;......give someone a chance and a child that got hurt with a toy and it won&apos;t matter if they got it through charity or not. They will sue. That being said, the toys should have been disposed of out of sight and pouring bleach on them is just another safety liability...not smart.
