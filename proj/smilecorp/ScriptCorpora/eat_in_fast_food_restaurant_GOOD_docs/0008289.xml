		Welcome to allmyapps
 
We are sorry to inform you that the web browser you&apos;re using (Microsoft Internet Explorer 6) is not compatible with the allmyapps service. To be able to use allmyapps.com service, you need either to upgrade to a newer version of Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 8 or even 7 are ok) or switch to another web browser (like Firefox or Google Chrome for example...).

Thank you for your understanding. We hope to see you soon on allmyapps!

The allmyapps team
