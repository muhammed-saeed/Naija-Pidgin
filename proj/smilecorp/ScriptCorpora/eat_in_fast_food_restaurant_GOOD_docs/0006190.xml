Correction...If you maintain a 90 percent capacity gallup lets you keep your desk. If you fall below 95 percent capacity during a 4 week period your 35 hour wage drops to that of a 20 hour team member. MORALE SUCKS AT THE 108 AND OLD MILL LOCATION SINCE THEY BROUGHT IN NEW MANAGER. SHE DOESNT HAVE A CLUE

F**ck all you people!! You (general&apos;you&apos;) scream and invoke&apos;do not call&apos;lists (which don&apos;t apply to pollsters) and think it&apos;s perfectly alright to be an asshole to a 16 year old tracker. They sit there, with tears running over their faces, while you call them cunts and faggots and losers and they are still nothing but polite to you assholes./ They are KIDS! Trying to earn a dime and get tuition paid. That&apos;s right..Gallup pays their tuition if they make 85% capacity. When you&apos;re a douche they lose their tuition.
Gallup is an ass as well. They abuse and take advantage of minors. That&apos;s the nature of the game. George Gallup would puke if he knew what has happened to his company.
The cliftons are as dumb as a box of rocks. They won&apos;t realize until Gallup collapses under their mismanagement. It&apos;s tragic.
When you people are dicks, you&apos;re picking on children. Hope you&apos;re happy,Asswipes.

As a gallup Employe I would say im tired of people assuming we are telemarketers, its stupid and selfish.... Right now im working on G1K and City of Hope, and City of hope is where I get my monies. I call and say, Hi my name is ****** and im with gallup polls, have you herd of us before? Well we dont sell anything, and I get a lot of hangups from selfish bastards all over the us. Without polls..THERE WOULD BE NO STATISTICS..
 whit on April 11, 2012 for 402-952-4444 
I just got a call from them. Asked me if I was interested in doing a survey so they can put together informations based off of all the data they collect from people taking these surveys. It wasn&apos;t your average, boring, everyday telemarketer survey. It was related to every day life..if we&quot;dissaprove&quot;or&quot;approve&quot;of the way Obama has been running our country etc.
Its actually a beneficial phone call IMO.

Jeez Bob,
Paranoid much?
I work for Gallup Polls. The computer generates random numbers. Mostly we get&quot;the number or code you have dialed is invalid....&quot;or one of 100 other invalid number messages. When we get a person we&apos;re pretty much shocked.
We ask if there&apos;s safe water where you live, and if Obama&apos;s health care insurance requirement is constitutional IYO, and whether, in the last twelve months, there has been a time when you didn&apos;t have enough money for food, or healthcare, or shelter.... It&apos;s called the national health and well being index and we do it EVERY DAY. People want to know, and allocate funds according to it and Gallup trackers are abused every day, all day, by people who think their precious 8 minutes is more important than national well-being. Yes, we are paid very well, but we take the abuse because we believe in the mission.
Check your meds, bob.

Hey Bob you are an idiot! You have been watching to many James Bond movies or watching to much Bill Mahrer. As a Gallup employee i cannot for the life of me know why we or anybody would want to here your views or opinions. You no doubt have the size of a brain equivelant to that of a BB in a boxcar.

Something to keep in mind about all these continuing bothersome calls for surveys, so called charities and so called charity pickups despite asking them to remove you from their list:

Call centers have sprung up in my town that make use of the survey and the charity loophole around the do not call list;they have been a headache for law enforcement, emergency services, neighboring businesses and residential areas. When I ask any patrolling officer in town about these call centers, they are quick to state their frustrations about the criminal activity that some of these call centers have brought into the area. Several law enforcement agencies regularly visit some of these call centers looking for warrant arrests etc. I have heard from sources including from frustrated employees that work for these call centers complaining about the drug activity, vandalism of cars and neighboring businesses, break-ins and theft, drinking while on the job, smoke breaks are actually marijuana breaks, drunk driving, very dangerous driving, tons of tossed out litter of empty liquor containers, trash, food etc. I’ve even heard that the mangers are also involved in criminal activities and have even preyed on their legitimate employees who are simply trying to eek out a living on horrible wages. Also the operators are untrained in a very high turn around, poorly managed and dysfunctional work environment.

Also realize this when you call a companies’customer service line and get horrible service from the call center that’s been hired by the company. One time while on a call with our bank’s customer service, the operator was so loopy that it required ending the call and calling again to try and get someone else to help, think about that when you call a companies’customer service and the conversation gets odd, off the wall and obtuse–you may be talking to an operator that’s drunk or on something. After 6 months of getting a different and wrong answer to our ongoing problem each time we called our bank’s call center, we gave up and closed the account.

With so little police left in our town due to cutbacks, they can’t always respond to vandalism and break-ins when it’s witnessed as they have their plate full responding to the major emergencies, this allows the criminal activity free reign, the neighborhood becomes the hood. Some insurance companies require proof of private security patrols before they will honor a claim due to vandalism or theft leaving the neighboring businesses off guard and uncovered. These businesses also have the added cost to hire private security, install security systems/monitoring, upgrade lighting etc. Then there are the dangers and headaches to the nearby businesses employees such as their cars being vandalized or broken into. Some businesses simply give in, pickup and move out of town.

One of my neighbors owns a call center and he requires that his operators are bonded, but I guess there’s no laws requiring this–there should be. Right now in my town it seems like anybody can start up a call center and hire questionable labor for cheap without much regulation.

I my efforts the past several years to try and get something done, I am most struck by the fact that there’s no real help, everyone is more worried about being sued than dealing with the obvious problem - you are on your own....

Marketing via phone is not new, what is new is the universal sense of entitlement that the internet has bestowed upon anyone that can post to a public site.

All the animosity and plans to screw any legitimate results of polls only show how utterly childish you are.

Dear Stupid American Public:

There are a few things that I&apos;m not allowed to say over the phone, so I&apos;ll say them here.

1.) If you rudely just hang up on me, chances are extremely high that you will called back the very next day. Take the time to at least be polite enough to hear us out and then calmly tell us you dont want to do it. I dont want to waste my time talking to idiots like you, but i have to in order to get paid and go to school.
2.) Your all mighty no call list is a joke. Seriously, I laugh every time someone tells me they are on the no call list because it doesn&apos;t mean ANYTHING.
3.) Spanish speaking americans (or illegals that somehow got a phone and I now have to call): LEARN ENGLISH! At the very least, say&apos;no english&apos;instead of sitting on the phone in complete silence. I&apos;m not calling from the immigration office about deporting you. quit being so paranoid.

Signed,
Not ignorant american public

Karen, As a fellow employee of the Gallup Organization (Taking for granted that you are still employed there) I feel as if you mislead or overstated the fact that Gallup interviewers are trained for weeks before being allowed to work on projects.
G1k is a track that Gallop does 1000 surveys a day on and after 2 days of 4 hours each of classroom training employees are put on the phones to do interviews. If you refer to this as specialized training than your and my definition of specialized training seems to differ. At any rate the survey is only about 10 minutes long and does provide a valuble service to the citizens of the country.

 Christian (that&apos;s my name) on August 13, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
It was actually kinda fun. Gallup called and I had already seen this site. They said they were doing a gallup poll in conjunction with USA today. I said&quot;OK&quot;They had called me on my cell, which is all I have. (Who doesn&apos;t get the unlimited plan now?)
It was a political poll, mainly. The girl asked me if I would vote for a Jew...a lesbian...a black person...a morman (sp?)....
among other equally inflammatory things. Can you imagine the abuse they get, asking such things?
Then yesterday I logged on and in my newsfile...&apos;according to a gallup poll... 46% of Americans don&apos;t think most members of congress deserve to be re-elected, Americans will vote for a gay-or-lesbian before an atheist....&apos;, and such. I recognized the questions right away and knew I was included in the results. We all want to know what everyone thinks. Otherwise there would be no debates or commentators in the media. I LIKE being included. I have 5 minutes to say what I think. The girl asked me very politely if I would rather she call back another time, (I had told her I was doing yard work). I said,&quot;
no, go ahead&quot;. She said she&apos;d be as fast as possible, and she was. I don&apos;t get everyone&apos;s complaints. All you have to do is say you&apos;re too busy. No need to get nasty.

I too am on the DNC list - I was with my family during my father&apos;s open heart surgery when I got this call on my CELL PHONE - unfortunately in my line of work they have to be able to contact me to handle whatever catastrophe of the day - needless to say I don&apos;t think they like the opinion they got -
 STL on August 7, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
Actually, the DNC list is for telemarketing companies ONLY. They are asking questions so it&apos;s a&quot;research marketing&quot;company. I do&quot;research marketing&quot;for Enterprise rent-a-car and people have complained but there are actual hours and sometimes if you DO sign something it&apos;s in the contract to be reseached by a survey company for customer satisfaction ratings. At least that&apos;s how it is for ERAC.

I&apos;ve gotten calls from these people as well, I&apos;ve never answered because I didn&apos;t know the number, but yeah. That&apos;s about all I can say related to it if people are saying they are on the DNC list...
 Chuck B on August 3, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
Since Gallup is POLLING survey, they do not have to abide by the DNC list, but they MUST remove you if you request. We received a call about 5:30 today. I can&apos;t hear, my wife was asleep. Caller ID showed GALLUP POLL.

GALLUP: If you think I&apos;m gonna respond to your queries, you can forget it. I don&apos;t respond to polls, or telemarketers, or fake opportunities... Just give up, ok? Thanks.

Received a call. I know polls are important so I answered. I could have said no. The questions were not invasive and I reponded as I felt about the question. I could have hung up but I chose to answer and I was not at all alarmed by any question. repeating.... polls are important. It is our way of expressing our concerns.
 Mistie Ann on July 2, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
I actually don&apos;t mind taking part in a poll as that&apos;s just how I was brought up. The problem I have is, they&apos;ve called me two days in a row only to say absolutely nothing for several seconds then hang up! (Actually, that&apos;s not 100% accurate. When I answered the first call, I could hear two women were in the middle of a conversation with each other before I was hung up on.) It seems to me, these people don&apos;t have the sense God gave a turnip green anymore!
 Karen on July 1, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
Dear Katbee,
I am a gallup interviewer/tracker and I run the poll you are talking about. It&apos;s called G1K and you have to have special training to do it.
First, the numbers are generated randomly, by computer, that just puts together all possible phone numbers from a given zip code. 50% of the time we get non-working numbers. Cell phone companies have assigned prefixes not available to landlines, so are identifiable as cell phones. We ask if you have a landline, and if it is listed. We do that to get a better idea of our cell-phone owners demographic. More and more people have ONLY cell phones. We&apos;re finding out how many. Your name shouldn&apos;t be asked until after you&apos;ve given gallup permission to call again at the end. THEN we ask for a first name so we can ask for you. If you refuse we just type in&apos;female&apos;or&apos;male&apos;. If the interviewer asked for your first and last name he was new. The bank Q&apos;s are to find out what banks are most trusted, if at all, in your area. Nothing more. When we do projects for businesses, we say so right up front and tell you that the business supplied the number. G1k is NOT a client project, nor sponsored by anyone other than gallup. Further, a gallup interviewer isn&apos;t allowed within 50 feet of a phone until after weeks of training and a signed-in-blood confidentiality agreement. Also, no non-employee is allowed in the call center. Not even family. Gallup NEVER sells numbers or names and when we say, on G1k, that we don&apos;t have a list, it&apos;s because we don&apos;t have a list.

 Gallup interviewer on May 6, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
Kat, I just reread your concerns and I can also explain the following. The Gallup Health and well being survey is funded by Gallup themselves as they compile the information and market it to whoever is interested such as city, state and local governments as a source of information. The only reason they ask for your name is if perhaps Gallup ever would like to hear your opionions and views at a later date they can ask for you. (I as a practice do not ask for last names and only first names to not cause a concern for the other on the line.) The only time I ask for a full name and address is if the occupant on the line agrees to a mail out survey. Gallup does not provide your name or personal information (name, address etc ) to anyone ever. Again hope this helps alleviate any concerns you have for doing the interview. You can also call Gallup at anytime and talk to a representative for further explanation if needed. Thanks Gallup Interviewer.
 Anonymous on May 6, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
I am a gallup interviewer and I can answer your questions Kat. The survey you took part in is our Gallup Health and wellness survey. The reason for the first question about Obama is just a question that they chart day to day. The other questions regarding health, wealth and physical well being are just standard questions.The last questions after asking about the area you live in are extra questions that if you said a particular bank that was on the list than a few general customer service questions would follow up. If you go to Gallup.com and find the health and wellness tab you can see the tracking for this survey. Gallup is conducting this survey 1000 times a day for the next 5 years and has been conducting this survey for the last 3 and 1/2 years on going. In response to your view about the Gallup interviewer being pleasant and friendly you are correct for the most part as we try to be but I will be the first to tell you that every bunch has one bad apple in it from time to time just don&apos;t let that one bad apple taint your view of Gallup. TY and I will look for your response if you have any more questions.
 Katbee on May 6, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
If there&apos;s an interviewer from Gallup reading this could you please answer a few questions, just to make me feel a little better about my taking the poll?
I received my first Gallup Poll call last night and almost didn&apos;t take it as I was making dinner and talking to my granddaughter on my landline but decided at the last minute it might be interesting. Turned out it was, Brian was nice, polite and relaxed with a nice sense of humor. He stayed on subject and made me laugh, all in all I&apos;m glad I took the call. I&apos;m familiar with Gallup as I&apos;m fairly political and when I happen to hear&quot;The most current Gallup Poll say&apos;.....&quot;I generally listen so I knew it was a respectable company. After hanging up (of course) I found myself feeling a little uncomfortable as I felt I&apos;d given too much personal info for a non-personal call. This wasn&apos;t Brian&apos;s fault, I&apos;m a fairly intelligent person and should have questioned the&apos;why&apos;s and where for&apos;s&apos;of the call and him calling on my cell phone was a trigger that I should have questioned more as I only use it for emergencies or if I&apos;m away from home. I had ask him about calling my cell and could he call me back on my landline. I remember thinking he might be in training as he said yes but then I heard someone else tell him no and he apologized. My cell phone ( a tracfone) only showed Name Unknown then the usual info, #, time and date. He did mention it was called?,( darn, not enough coffee yet) I think he said it was called randomly and he didn&apos;t know it was a cell?
Seems I could go on and on with the call itself but I would like to ask a couple of questions just to feel better about a few things? I know you won&apos;t be able to give specific answers but some general info will help as I&apos;ve got some bells going off after reading the posts here. Thanks ahead for any help.
I was ask mostly health and political questions with a few financial ones thrown in, also the one about President Obama a couple of times so I&apos;d thought it was a mostly political questionnaire until one about the name of my bank came up, then I was ask if I&apos;d mind being ask a few more questions, what was my name and was I listed in the phone book. These weren&apos;t consecutive, there would be completely different subjects in between so the bells didn&apos;t go off loudly in my head until we&apos;d hung up and I&apos;d gone over it by myself. I wasn&apos;t told who was having this done or why, just questions and because the only times I&apos;d heard about Gallup was mostly politically and the points seemed to be political I was alright until the question about the name of the bank came up, then my name and was I listed in the p.b. and a few others but after reading from the posts below the bells going off in my head are mostly about the bank they keep referring to is also mine and several mentioned the calls being on their cells, some mentioned specifically being a tracfone, also mine. The idea that either of these paid for an anonymous poll is just hitting me as plain wrong, or that tracfone allowed their bank of #s to be used for a poll ( can&apos;t think of any other reason but to get more minutes used as they are mainly a prepaid phone). I don&apos;t mean to sound paranoid and I know this might but this and then being ask for the name of my bank felt odd then finding the bank it&apos;s self here doesn&apos;t feel any better but even they don&apos;t have my cell #. This is all feeling very negative which is a little disappointing as it had be a good call.
One last thing, if it&apos;s all about random calls, why would I be ask if I would mind answering more questions, ask for my first and last name and if I was listed in the phone book? This was actually the reason I&apos;ve found myself on the site, to see if anyone else had been ask these things also or had I really screwed up. Sort of wish I&apos;d never looked it up as now I have more questions to be uncomfortable about. So, it&apos;s about being ask my name and name of my bank and being listed in the phone book, all in a random, non-specific poll of which I still can&apos;t tell you the subject of the poll it&apos;s self. And about tracfone and my bank showing up on this page, where there&apos;s no reason for my being connected to either except this survey. My bank is regional, not a national well known kind of place, so it&apos;s not like a Chase where you wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see the name in a survey.

And now I&apos;m going to hush and get off here. If anyone could answer this it would make for a better day for me anyway and again, thanks for any help. Kat

 Anonymous on April 7, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
My first time submitting to this site, but let&apos;s face it -- no one sets a career goal of working in a call center. May be a good entry-level job while going to school to get some money and benefits or for retirees whose careers are behind them, but having worked in call centers in the past in the early days of my career, I know from firsthand experience that most employees would jump ship for a few extra cents per hour. As evidence that most people who work in these types of environment are unhappy with their work is the typical annual turnover often exceeds 100% per year and those that stay with the job for a longer period of time have litte, if any, alternatives. I can&apos;t support Gallup or other similar organizations that make calls that annoy people, but we should have pity on those people that have no other alternatives but to make those calls.
 Gallup interviewer on April 7, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
Your very high opinion of yourself and your Let them eat cake attitude is a very good example that all the college degrees earned and collected do not make one better than any other. I would think that in today&apos;s society of entitlements that one would not be criticized for working a 40 hour job in doing an honest days work. I am not defending Gallup nor do I feel the need to do so. I am just very taken back by such a supposed well educated individual like yourself who claims to be can make such a statement as previously posted. And for the record I am very happy with my job and the service it provides to the community. Thankyou for your time and have a great day.

Your comment is an example of why it is important to make good life decisions and get a good education. My comments pointed out the math mistake made by another Gallup employee NOT my math skills (I hold a degree majoring in engineering with a minor in math). You seem to suggest the my daughter should have aspirations to be a cashier where the cash register makes thee decisions for her. My daughter is pre-med and aspires to create a professional career.

Given the vitriol expressed by many of the Gallup employees it appears that these employees are not very pleased with their choice of employment -- perhaps they should seek other employment.
 Gallup interviewer on April 6, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
Lets do some math... If you are paid 14.00 an hour and you are expected to produce 6.5 interviews an hour , that breaks down to 2 dollars and 15 cents an interview. I understand the concept may be very difficult for such an astute mind like yourself. May I suggest that you work with your daughter by putting it in terms that you and she may relate to. If someone comes in and buys 3 gallons of gas at 3 dollars and 45 cents a gallon and wants to add on a pack of cigs at 5.00 a pack while she is working at the local quick pic just teach her to read the cash register on how much change to pay back to that customer. You also may want to suggest add on sales like a piece of Beef Jerky or a lottery ticket to increase that sale, it is good for business.

Although Gallup calls are very annoying, they have a positive benefit. I use their calls as an example to my daughter to get a good education so she won&apos;t have to work in a call center making annoying calls. For example, the post from a Gallup employee...

To many of you are overly suspicious. There are no little black helicopters circling over your house. This is just a job that we do to make an honest living. 14.00 an hour with a quota of 6.5 interviews an hour breaks down to 2.15 cents an interview. And let me tell you its not worth the 2.15 cents to put up with some of your responses. My time is much to valuble for that.

... who believes that $14.00 per hour divided by 6.5 calls per hour is 2.15&quot;cents&quot;per interview (repeated twice in the post so it is not a typo). Perhaps a bit more time studying basic math would get this person a better job. The answer is $2.15 per interview. Or, if the math is correct, their time is worth about 14 cents per hour.

Given the profanity shown by some of these Gallup employees and the lack of concern about the people they call, I will never contribute to any of their surveys. Gallup must be proud of these employees who use such language when referring to the people who make it possible for them to earn a living. I received a call from Gallup shortly before 9PM which woke my sick child. I realize that Gallup and other such companies are exempt from the DNC regulations, but I have a no solicitation message on my phone that they do not respect -- they are soliciting responses to survey questions and should respect my wishes and hang up when they receive the message. That message is there for a reason - their calls are disturbing and very annoying. Perhaps is each solicitor should give their personal home telephone number so we can call them during dinner time or when their children may be sleeping.

I would like to address the topic of being called inspite of being on the Federal No Call List. The following are exempt from the no call ruling. Non profit organizations, Polling companies any body as long as you are not being sold anything. So please if you happen to be called by a Gallup just ask them not to call you any longer and remove you from the list . You would be amazed at how effortless it is to accomplish this . I have however had very irritated clients on the phone that after a brief explanation of what and why we are calling are good sports to do the survey, that after the end take time and thank me for giving them the time to voice their opionion and value their views. The one thing I do not suggest is picking up the phone and just shouting QUIT CALLING ME ! Dosent work folks expect a return call at later date without having a chance to explain reason we are calling.

 Gallup interviewer on March 27, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
In response to the question about why Gallup does not leave a message on your answering machine? That is not possible nor do I really think that you would want that. Gallup comes up on your caller ID and there is no call back number only availability is out going calls not incoming. Also you are not being called by the same interviewer , as your number does come up random. Gallup&apos;s main calling hours are 1500 (3pm cst ) to 2100 (9 pm) . Mind you the latest Gallup calls is 9 pm your time due to time changes. Also client confidentiality does not permit Gallup to leave messages regarding bank accounts etc. Their are some relationships where one member of a couple has a bank account for various reasons that the other spouse has no record or idea of having. Gallup doesnt want to cause any problems by violating that arrangement. One note of interest is that Gallup also does an adult beverage survey that is rather fun and short. If given a chance to participate in that one I encourage you to give it a try. That one is random digit dial meaning we have no name or anything just a phone number. Thankyou for giving me a moment to explain the business a little. I will gladly monitor this site as there are a lot of misconceptions regarding the business of telephone interviewing/polling.
 SC on March 26, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
How about leaving a message with who you are and what the call was about and leave a call back number? The thing I hate most about getting calls from numbers that I do not recognize is that they never leave a message. If you feel the call is important enough to make the call in the first place it&apos;s important enough to leave a message.

^^^Amen, Interviewer! I don&apos;t get why people have a problem spending 3 minutes improving customer service at a business they&apos;re a customer OF. If people tell me nicely that they&apos;re not interested, I shrug, tell them to have a nice evening, put them in as a refusal, and move on. If they&apos;re rude to me, I shrug, tell them to have a nice evening, and put them right back in the dialer...and move on.
Being rude to someone who is just doing their job is pretty pitiful.
Another tip people... the dialer will automatically keep putting your number back in as long as you don&apos;t answer or it gets a machine or voicemail. Only a live interviewer can take it out.
 Gallup interviewer on March 26, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
Ok people lets get something straight. First of all Gallup is not a government run organization. All you braniacs that are upset about Gallup having your information can blame your bank. Gallup has no other information about you other than a client supplied name and phone number. Gallup has no account numbers, balances , any classified information nor do they want that. Your banks pay a very large amount of money to acquire the services of a reputable organization like Gallup to get a read on the customer service you receive. If you choose not to answer a three or four minute survey , that is ok as we just move on to the next number. It is my hope that the next rude contact that I get that hangs up after spouting profanities gets caught in a line at your local bank receiving the customer service you deserve.

Take my name off your calling list. PNC bank should get involved and get this annyoing caller to STOP!!!!! They always say they represent this bank, but I doubt any reliable bank would have someone like this calling all the time. LET ME ALONE!
 Gallup Employee on March 14, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
You are why working at Gallup is so fucking frustrating.

First of all, what possible&quot;scam&quot;can occur from knowing what branch you visit? There is nothing someone can gain from that.

Secondly, file a fucking complaint. Your bank is the one that hires Gallup, not the other way around. Gallup could care less which branch you visit. We call because the company you do business with pays us to.
Don&apos;t like it? Then go to a different bank and get treated like shit.
I for one would like the fact that my bank spends all this money to know how its customers feel and are always looking for ways to improve.

Americans are so weary about everything these days. Calm the fuck down and unplug your phone and internet while you&apos;re at it. You&apos;re such a fucking idiot.
 Lisamb41 on March 13, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
I received a call from these people on a Sunday wanting to know why I visited a PNC Bank at Buckey Lake, Ohio Branch location. I live in Lewis Center, Ohio which is in Delaware county, Buckeye Lake, Ohio is over an hour away from me. Then she proceeded to ask me, if my account was a joint account and why would a family member use my account at that location. I don&apos;t care if they are reputable or not, that&apos;s scam i will be filing complaints with my local bank. I don&apos;t know why it&apos;s any of their business which branch location that I use. She was lying because i told her that i have no reason to go to a bank that far when there is one 5 minutes from me she hung up on me. Beware of these people, sound like fishing scams not surveys..:)

After the first hang up you continue to call back. You may have the right to go around the&quot;DO NOT CALL REGISTERY&quot;however, you also think we should take two or three minutes out of our day for you. Multiply this by the amount of people that do these types of surveys and I could spend an entire week on the phone wih you survey companies. Most of do not mean to be rude, however when you keep calling back and you do not take a hint, especially after being asked not to call again and how I did not wish to participate. The GALLUP ORG is no different than any of the others. So of course we are all tired of the calls no matter how important (YOU) may think the survey is. I think that my personal time at home is more important. So in the future when you continue to call people that have made it very clear not to call. Please Please Please quit being so suprised that we are going to be rude the next time you call. Take a hint and do not waist your time or mine.

thanks

I, too, received a call at home for my husband, who is in the hospital. The caller said they wanted to survey him on the hospital that he is in. I asked what it pertained to and they wouldn&apos;t tell me. I suppose, HIPPA being what it is, they probably weren&apos;t allowed. I said he was IN that hospital and would be for at least two more weeks. She said she would put in that the respondent is ill and no one would call again. Se said,&quot;I hope your husband feels better soon, goodbye&quot;and no one has called back. That was ten days ago. Considering what a grouch I was to her she apparently kept her word. It was worth the minute it took to answer. When a loved one is ill, any time the phone rings your heart skips beats.

Yeah its way less work to google a phone number and type a comment out about how you don&apos;t answer the phone rather than just answering your phone and taking 10 seconds to listen to why we&apos;re calling and THEN decide if you&apos;re interested or not.
You sure beat the system sleepwalker.
Fucking dumbass.
 The Sleepwalker on February 22, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
Hey Gallup,
IF someone does not answer your calls, it&apos;s probably because they don&apos;t want to be bothered by, are could care less, about your survey. Maybe you should consider limiting
the number of times you annoy your client-supplied victims, because thats what it is after the third or fourth time you call. Constant harrasment by telemarketers does not make
a good name for your fairly large company nor the client,
whoever they are, that supplied you with your list. Thank God for Google, your calls will continue to be ignored by
The Sleepwalker
 vansch on February 18, 2011 for 402-952-4444

Gallup will ALWAYS show up as GALLUP POLL on your caller id. If it doesn&apos;t it&apos;s not really them
 Edward Jackson on February 17, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
Well, as annoying as unknown callers are. The Gallup poll is important for your community to get money for services you need. I, as a rule, blow whistles in ears of callers, with unknown numbers. Not, because I am being mean, but to keep them from bothering me. If you are a legit company, you will put your number on the phone...
 unknown on February 16, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
I worked at Gallup recently and its funny to read these comments because more of you are speaking up and saying rude things on here then doing it over the phone to the interviewer. I have more people excited to do a Gallup poll then mad about it. Yes it is annoying that we call people&apos;s number 5 or 6 times and we only get answering machines or you pick up and hang up without saying a word. I know from my experience when you take the time to hang up the phone without saying anything it makes me want to hit call back later and let the next interviewer call you.
I am only in college, but I still understand what the mission is of getting people to speak up about their opinions. When we call and say for example,&quot;Hi my name is _____. I am calling on behalf of the Gallup Poll, how are you doing today?&quot;wouldnt you take the time to be courteous and say something back instead of going into dick mode. When we call cell phones we have screener questions to make sure you are of age for one and that you represent the area we are trying to call because we dont want to call you on your cell phone and your house phone and not get different opinions for different people. For the people who are being whiney babies about getting called and you being on the DO NOT CALL LIST..listen to what we have to say when you ask us about it before yelling because when you yell you look like a dumbass.
The DNC does not apply to you because we are not going to sell anything and yes the numbers are randomly dialed. I cant even call my friends who i know would do a survey anytime. It seems that the younger generation who are 19-25 are more willing to do the surveys and they dont really care if we call them on their cells. yes they ask and i tell them and i say would you like to continue with the survey..you have every option at that time to say no i would not like to take part, but thank you for calling.
Also on our health and well being surveys we ask for the person with the most recent birthday and then sometimes the computer will generate a question asking whether you agree or disagree with the way barrack obama is running our country today..its a simple agree or disagree and you all know what you think your name is not linked to this either is your phone number, but if you really do not feel comfortable answering that question you can refuse it. the questions we ask are not that intrusive because more than likely you tell your co-workers, friends, random servers at a restaurant or bartenders these exact things and more than likely they do not care. least when i am asking someone and they say there issues i listen and i make conversation. we want your opinions we dont want your money. i have my own money and i am going to college to make more money. we dont want your identity either because funny story we all have an identity and gallup didnt just hire us we had to go through a background check and also had to do several interviews to make sure we were the right fit of people for who they wanted calling people.

for all the people who do not want to be bothered if you nicely say that to the interviewer that your household would not like to participate then the interviewer will refuse you out. if you just hang up you are going back in and also if you just dont answer you will continue to get calls.
ps we dont call 3-4 times a day unless you say to call back later today..quit exaggerating. and if you have time to bitch on this website then you obviously have enough time to do a survey.

God AB you act like youre the only person in the world. Do you think the Gallup CEO really wanted to spend the 5 minutes to read your long,&quot;clever&quot;and just plain bitchy e-mail? You act like when Gallup calls you a puppy dies. Just dont answer the fucking phone when you see its a Gallup number. Or better yet, answer it, take the 2 minute survey and move on with your life.
But youre probably right, spending time writing a winey email to the CEO was a much better use of your time.
 Gallup on February 6, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
We read it, AB.
We can&apos;t remove client-supplied numbers from the dialer. If we call from a client-supplied list and THEN you tell us to remove it, we can.
Gallup is a fairly large company with centers all over America and in several foreign countries. We&apos;re the oldest. most accurate, public opinion pollsters in existence. That&apos;s why everyone hires us for their customer satisfaction interviews. It&apos;s also why people perk their ears when they hear,&apos;according to a Gallup poll...&apos;. The last thing we want to do is annoy our respondents. If you ask us to remove your number from a specific center, the interviewer will do that.
 AB on February 6, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
I sent the following email to the email addresses provided above. Hope they go through.... If not, I will find one that does. I will send this same email EVERYTIME I get a call from here on out. The only way to get this to stop is to do something about it - not yell at Gallup through this website - since I am sure they don&apos;t read it! Anyway - here&apos;s the email!

I do not like your survey call, I do not like them not at all. I do not vote, I do not buy, I do not travel I will not fly. I do not want to talk to you, I do not want to here or there, I do not want to any where. I do not want to take your call, I do not want it Jane and All!!!

This is my attempt at humor, one time only.... Please remove my number from your internal do not call list. Do not add any more numbers associated with my name to your company.

Number to remove is 262-909-1633, it is a personal cell in which you do not offer me any compensation to pay for my minutes to speak with you. It is not my responsibility to carry enough minutes to accept a phone call in which I did not initiate. If you have an ability to compensate me for my time to take your survey, I will be more than happy to. Please send me notice via mail which would include all information supporting such compensation. Otherwise, it is encouraged, demanded, requested and any other word you can think of that you remove my number immediately from you list. I find it absurd that you would call me at noon on a Sunday, at 6 am and 9 pm through the week and any other time in between. Have I made myself clear? If there is any question as to the intent of this email, it is to further request that no one from Gallup, associated with Gallup, has the word Gallup any where near their physical body ever, ever contact me again.

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this very important matter at hand. I know what you&apos;re thinking...this person had the time to write this email.... going on and on about not calling, even taking the time to make a little joke with a Dr. Seuss book, but this person can&apos;t take time out of their busy schedule to answer one little survey? That is what you are thinking right? Well, the obvious answer is that I DON&apos;T WANT TO TAKE YOUR SURVEY!!! Unless of course you pay me....money motivates all!!! Obviously - it motivates you - you get paid to call and harass me.... I get paid to do my job..... but luckily doing my job, does not mean I have to take your phone call. Of course when I say your phone call, I don&apos;t mean yours exactly since I seriously doubt the CEO of Gallup is actually going to call me? But hey - maybe its a small company, maybe you are short handed... what to I know, maybe the VP, the CEO and everyone else at Gallup has nothing better to do than to call me. Crap, that means I&apos;m important! Ok - tell you what Jane/James....whoever. If you, the VP or CEO, want to take time out of your busy schedule.... Call me. Leave me a message, I&apos;ll call you back and take your blessed survey from you personally - no one else. Then, will we be done? Will that be all? Or will I have to keep sending ridiculous emails to you - only to have to continually change my email address since you will block this one.... just as I am trying to do with your phone number! Better yet....in the market for enhancement pills? Wow, once you get on those mailing lists....it&apos;s impossible to get off!!! Care to try?

Ok - there you have it....please take my number as posted above, off of your list. Please remove it from the auto dialer, please just let me have my peace as I live out the rest of my life.

Kind regards,
Ms... AB

 karen on January 27, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
I work for Gallup. Some of these letters are full of falsehoods. We do the&apos;famous&apos;polls but we also do customer surveys for various clients. The clients supply the names and numbers of the customers. We don&apos;t buy or sell them.When a customer says they don&apos;t want to take a survey, we code in&apos;refusal&apos;and the number is taken out of the loop. If we get a machine or no answer, we code that in and someone else tries later. If a customer tells us to call back later, we put that in and if they give us a day or time, that&apos;s when the number will come up. We can not call after nine in a given time zone, nor before ten a.m. We can&apos;t just put in a random number to be dialed. If a person isn&apos;t on the client&apos;s list the computer won&apos;t dial it. No one wants to waste time doing a survey with someone who doesn&apos;t want to do it. Once you take the 6 minutes to complete the survey, the number goes out of the loop. I don&apos;t understand why a person wouldn&apos;t want to have their say on how a company they do business with treats their customers. Someone is going to speak for you in the sample. It might as well be you as someone who feels differently.

The best way to avoid being called is to unplug your phone and crouch in a corner avoiding any kind of contact whatsoever.

You people are pathetic. If the phone ringing is seriously that much of a hassle then get rid of it and go live on a fucking island somewhere.

How iin the world can these people get by with all this calling EVERY day at EVERY hour of the day? It&apos;s so frustrating when you have an elderly person in your home who is very sick and needs rest, they even call while the home health nurse is here. ! There should be some way or someone who could stop this, it&apos;s almost like some sort of abuse.

Well I just got my first call from these fine morons. I don&apos;t care as much that telemarketers are calling. However it really irritates me when they cannot bother to leave a message at the least. In my opinion, if you cant leave a message, then piss off. And by the way folks, I used to work in telemarketing, and most firms use auto-dialers which essentially dial every possible number, regardless of the National DNC list. They really don&apos;t need to buy your numbers, all get dialed sequentially.

How rude got a call from the gallup company today...they wanted me to do a survey asked them to get me there manager had a nice chat...aparently since they are not considered telemarketers they are allowed to call anyone. They randomly call number out of a data base that&apos;s how they call everyone known number. Since she called me I let her have it called her every name in the book and she had the nerve to tell me not to talk to her like that and I said whatever your the one calling me so I will say whatever I feel comes to mind so maybe next time you would like twice about call me at this number...
 JRC on January 14, 2011 for 402-952-4444 
Gallup makes their money off of your answers, and if they don’t obtain data from a sampled number they have to statistically account for that discrepancy, which is why they keep calling. You can email them and they will stop. Personally I think these random sample polls of 1000 people or less are in no way representative of an entire population, or as Mark Twain once said:“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”
 Anonymous on January 6, 2011 for 877-242-5587 
Gallup doesn&apos;t pretend to be your bank. US Bank is one of the few major banks that actually cares what its customers think, so it pays to hear customers feedback on how they can improve on anything. If thats such a fucking hassle, close your account, go to a different bank and treated like the piece of shit that you are.

I am furious, these jerks called me and pretended to be my banlk, and ask personal info about my bank account I just opened. I would like to know how my bank already released my personal info to telemarketers? this same bank branch talked to my MOM, when she went into the bank for her own account. They felt it was ok to discuss my info with her also.
I am closing my US Bank account tomorrow!

No actually Gallup does not have an auto dialer, thatd be illegal. We can push a number just fine. Gallup just chooses not to leave voicemails because there is not return phone number to call us back at. Just another ill-informed American ranting on this forum.
 kritterbite on December 17, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
they hate my answering machine which makes you push a number. Actually what this means is that they are an auto dialer, and your phone number was bought off a list. auto dialer computers can&apos;t push the number to leave a message. Let your answering pick it up. they will give up!
 sunny on December 15, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
To Don and Lindz:

You both have really stupid strategies.

Lindz: If any company (not just them) has business with you, they need to hear from you that you are not interested. This is the only sure way to make the phone calls stop. Otherwise, how are they supposed to know that you don&apos;t want to talk to them and aren&apos;t just really busy?

Don: When I worked in telemarketing (the worst job ever), we would call people twice as much when they did that.

You don&apos;t need to be rude. Odds are the person you are talking to has never called you before, even if someone else from the organization has. Just tell them politely that you&apos;re not interested and you can all move on with your lives. When you act like a jerk, you&apos;re not accomplishing anything.

And another note: at my company, it was understood that anyone who was rude to you never got taken off the list. It was the only relief we had that the jerks got more and more phone calls:)
 nor on December 13, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
First I want to state that there is no reason for profanity, name calling, threats, cursing, not to mention lewd, gross and obscene comments toward anyone. That is flat out discussting. As for the calls, Gallup and any other organization for that matter, if you are told to stop calling and remove the number you called from your list then you need to do so immediately be it yourself, your supervisor whatever but STOP CALLING THE PERSON AFTER YOU ARE TOLD TO DO SO, PERIOD. By not doing so you&apos;re only being rude and disrespectfull to the party you called you&apos;re also asking to get yelled at because it&apos;s really annoying to tell some one more than once to stop calling. Thank you to TIRED OF SOLICITORS for your information since they have been calling my cell phone which they should not be doing, I&apos;m going to reach out to the Gallup contacts that Gavin and Ralph posted (thanks guys) and if that doesn&apos;t work, I&apos;m going to report them to the FTC via the link posted by Joe (thanks by the way) immediately.

All this effort over all this time and what good has it done? None. It&apos;s time for some new tactics, isn&apos;t it? Look at all the other websites out there fighting the Gallup organization, too. Apparently, all efforts are useless. Someone needs to come up with something that will get results. I&apos;d like to see a class action against them myself (among other things). How about petitioning Congress and Senate? There has got to be something more effective against these pests.

Gallup is used by companies to judge the service of their employees...I am an employee of one of those companies and our pay depends on those surveys...or being terminated due to lack of service that we give. I do not like calls at home either just make it a point when you give out your number at a store/bank/service area to request the internal do not call list and that will end these calls to you. I am not here to judge anyone just to give information! Have a great day!

Actually the Gallop Organzation is the Nebraska Call and Training Center located here in the heart of the 1-800 call center capital of the US and is part of Gallop Poll, Inc. They are not technically telemarketing calls because they are hired by other companies to call their customers and ask them to complete a survey for that company. However, Nebraska state telecommunications laws state that no outbound business calls can take place before 8am or after 8pm and can not be made on Sundays that originate or terminate within the borders of Nebraska.. so if you live in Nebraska or the call center calling is physically located inside Nebraska any type of outbound business call is not allow and is actually a felony offense and yes, the State of Nebraska via the State Attorney General&apos;s Office does prosecute for violating this law. You can file a complaint via the website.
The Gallup Organization only calls people whose phone number the company hiring them, gave to them... so if they are calling for your bank, you might want to review your bank&apos;s privacy policy, most likely by doing business with that bank, you actually gave them permission to share your information with 3rd party vendors and so this company did not violate your privacy and neither did your bank since you gave them permission. If you don&apos;t like getting these calls, then tell the company that hired them that you want to opt out and not to share your information with their vendors.

They&apos;ve called me at least once a day this entire week. I wasn&apos;t home or able to get to the phone when they&apos;ve called before, but tonight it was 9pm and I made a point to get to the phone to tell them to stop calling. I have a 2 year old daughter and a 5 week old daughter I was trying to get to bed. They asked how I was doing and I told him it&apos;s 9pm what the heck are you calling so late for and what is this call regarding. He replied with&quot;it&apos;s a survey and we can call up until 9pm.&quot;I told him to remove my number from his list, that I have 2 small children I am trying to put to bed at this time and it&apos;s rude to call so late. They better not call again.

They call every night, and I&apos;m already in bed as I have to get up early to go to work. This is very annoying. I don&apos;t appreciate getting woke up. I refuse to answer. Can&apos;t they get the message. We&apos;re on the don&apos;t call list too.

I now have received 3 calls from this phone number 402-952-4444 in a period of 10 days. After finding out that the Gallop Organization isn&apos;t a telamarketer but is a&apos;survey&apos;company, I DONT GIVE A SHIT IF THEY DONT FALL UNDER THE THE CATAGORY OF A TELEMARKETER....I AM SICK OF GETTING CALLS THAT WASTE MY TIME...WHO WANTS TO BE WORKING UNDER A VEHICLE AND THE PHONE RINGS,WE PULL OURSELVES OUT FROM UNDER IT TO ANSWER THE CALL THINKING IT&apos;S THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE, AND HERE IT&apos;S JUST ANOTHER DUMBASS WHO WANTS ME TO TAKE MY TIME TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS WHICH ONLY ADVANTAGES THEIR COMPANY OR AFFILIATES??? THESE PEOPLE ARE UNIMPORTANT AND NEED TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A NUISANCE JUST AS TELEMARKETERS ARE!!!

I keep getting all these calls from teh Gallup Org even tho we are on the DNC. I finally answered it today and they were asking telemarketing questions about Wells Fargo! They were asking for my husband and not me, so they said they&apos;d call back later and hung up before I got a chance to tell them to not call again. I redialed the number and after a long recording, there was an option to leave a message. I gave my name and phone number and said I request that they take me off their calling list, that they are harrassing us with these incessant calls 2 or 3 times a day.

There needs to be a modification to the FCC&apos;s laws to include bastards like the Gallup Org. that are really acting as telemarketers, but have figured out how to get around the DNC.
 Anonymous on October 20, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Yes, your bank hires Gallup to do customer service surveys. Ask your bank if you dont believe me, if its that big of a deal to you then switch to a bank that doesnt give a shit what its customers think. Seems to me like its only helping the customers get good service.
 Anonymous on October 19, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
I really did not like being called about my recent visit to the bank. The fact that you knew where I banked and my cell phone number. Where did you get my information? Did the bank give it to you. Are you spying on me or what? How did you know I went to bank.? This is not right! You are violating my privacy. My cell phone was on a no call list. That apparently does not mean a thing to your organization at all.
 Deb on October 18, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Why don&apos;t you try answering your phone?
They called me last week, I answered and he was just calling for my bank to see how I was treated at my branch. I politely declined and haven&apos;t received a phone call since. It&apos;s really not that hard. It takes much less time to just answer it once then continue to let them keep calling.

Oh, and by the way, Mrs.&quot;Anonymous&quot;, you are definitely a dick sucking punk. I can tell by what you say. You whine. You defend the indefensible. You feel sorry for yourself. Just like a weak bitch. So far as your feelings toward Gallup or Gallop or whatever you&apos;re calling yourselves today, you have made the mistake that all skanky whores make--you&apos;ve fallen in love with the ones who are fucking you. You&apos;re in love, but they&apos;re just fucking. Hell, I bet your ass is so stretched out you could shit a Buick. You suck so much dick, when someone asks you how that ice cream tastes, you say&quot;sperm&quot;. And how about that chili, how does that taste?&quot;Sperm.&quot;Well, what about that hot dog?&quot;Sperm&quot;. And of course you never cut up hot dogs or sausage before you eat them. Eat my shit, you worthless bitch, and enjoy.

To paraphrase what Mickey Rourke says in Sin City: I love telemarketers, because you can say anything you want and you don&apos;t have to feel bad. When I&apos;ve had a bad day, had a fight with the girlfriend, have a hangover, you&apos;d think that&apos;s the last time you&apos;d want a telemarketing call. Not me. I hear the phone ring, I see that it&apos;s from an 800 or 888 or 877 number, and I know who it is. With a grin I pick up the phone, wait for the chump to confirm it...and then I take a giant shit all over them. It&apos;s a good life. And you call so many times during the day I am always assured of a steady diet of shit receptacles. So keep calling. You are keeping me from beating my dog. And you know what? When you complain about how I speak to you, or you hang up and call back, I just enjoy it all the more. I just wish I could get you in person, so I could shit directly in your mouth. That would be better. Of course, given the opportunity I could easily beat the living shit out of any number of you. But I&apos;d rather degrade and humiliate you. And you poor bitch-ass punk motherfuckers on this forum whining about people being rude to you, it just confirms that my actions and those of people like me are not in vain. It works. You are all a bunch of shit-eating bitches. But you keep calling back. I can only assume that means you like the taste. Bye now, you fucking weak cowards.
 Get Wise on September 24, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
This is not the Gallop Poll your mother knew. This is a collection agency using a Gallop Poll look a like ( like Gallop Poll Inc.) name. The better business bureau lists a Gallop Poll Inc located in a constantly busy phone nbr in San Francisco. They do not have a web page so you will always find the real Gallop Poll when you Google.... how clever. I know this is confusing but that is what they want you to be so they can hide behind a false front of the real Gallup Poll company. THEY ARE A COLLECTION AGENCY.

You&apos;re other option is to keep receiving calls from Gallup and ignoring them and then bitch about how rough your life is on a forum. Believe it or not, a ton of people love doing surveys and helping out companies they do business with, we can&apos;t reach them without sifting through you assholes first so do yourself and us a favor and pick up the phone and take the time to get your number removed the proper way and get on with your life

Obviously Gallup can still physically call&quot;private&quot;numbers, since we&apos;re not a telemarketer. Posting you don&apos;t want to be called on this does absolutely nothing. Try answering the phone, staying on the phone for an entire 30 seconds, let the interviewer finish their sentence and verify what theyre calling about. Then if you are not interested say so and magically you won&apos;t be called back. Gallup doesn&apos;t make money by calling people, they make it by people finishing surveys, we don&apos;t want to call and talk to people who don&apos;t want to do them anymore than you want to be called. Its a simple task really to get taken off. Patience is key.

That is just completely wrong. Check your facts before you post something that is so grossly incorrect. This is a posting dedicated to the Gallup POLL. Strictly a market research company...not a debt collector, I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about
 wake up on September 21, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
This is not&quot;the Gallup Org&quot;you are thinking of. It is The Gallup Organization INC which is a collection agency hiding behind a fake survey name. The collection agency hdqt in San Francisco is trying to locate a person at your phone number for debt collection. They are using voice recognition software to identify persons in your house and the info you give them is used to identify a person could be living in your house. Go to the Better Business Bureau and look up The Gallup Org..... you&apos;ll catch on.
 Current Employee on September 17, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Ok first of all, no market research is not telemarketing. Telemarketing is the selling, soliciting or promoting of a product or service. Surveys don&apos;t fall under that category at all. Look it up and learn the facts first.

Second, I&apos;m an 18 year old full time college student who works 20 hours a week whenever I want to. No schedule to follow or certain times to come in. I make over $250 a week after taxes and my entire college tuition is paid for by Gallup. If that&apos;s a&quot;sleazy, obnoxious&quot;job then what do you call working at some shitty fast food restaurant for minimum wage and no benefits. Most of Gallup&apos;s employees are students of some kind and there is absolutely no comparison to other jobs 16-22 year olds can get. Also, many full time interviewers make over $60,000 a year with no college degree. I&apos;d say that&apos;s a pretty good option if college isn&apos;t for you.

The only thing that sucks about this job is having to talk to you rude, and inconsiderate people all day long. Do you think we choose to call you right when you sit down to dinner? No. We make no money if you don&apos;t do the survey. Therefore we have no desire to keep you on the phone if you don&apos;t have time right now. If you have kids or care about people at all, I would think you could take 2 to 10 minutes out of your day once in your life, if you don&apos;t believe in the cause then look at it as helping pay for someone&apos;s education so maybe they can get a&quot;real&quot;career down the road. No, most of us don&apos;t aspire to be a telephone interviewer but it beats a lot of other jobs and in this economy I&apos;ll take what I can get.
 slowyouroll on September 15, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
Just received 2nd call ever. I never answered the first time but I had googled it and saved the number in my phone. When they called just now, I was curious what they wanted so I answered. Girl asked me if I banked with my current bank- told her yes- she asked me if I had visited the bank recently- told her no (because I haven&apos;t) and she said&apos;Ok then, thank you.&apos;

That was the end of the call. Will they call me again? Probably, but now I know who they are and what they want and I can choose not to answer the phone. Yes, it&apos;s annoying but it&apos;s not something to cry over.
If you choose to not answer your phone, I don&apos;t understand why people are so angry that they keep calling. You know it&apos;s them- don&apos;t answer it!
Pick up the phone and hang it up. Turn the ringer off. Or throw your phone in a lake, if you can&apos;t handle the ringing.

Also, for the ignorant assholes that claim to be former/current employees of this company, that are writing on this forum- you are not helping your cause whatsoever.
What you are doing- market research- is telemarketing.
Using the telephone to conduct market research, or for marketing purposes, is TELE-MARKETING.
Sure, there may be a loophole somewhere, or a thin grey line that allows you to be excluded from the DNC list but you work in a call center. The average human will consider you to be a sleazy, obnoxious, rude asshole *which based on most of the comments from the previous/current employees sound, that&apos;s exactly how you sound. Even if Gallup is a legit company and has honorable intentions, you&apos;re bothering people when they&apos;re busy, eating, sleeping, whatever. I worked in a call center when I was in college and it&apos;s shitty work. You know it&apos;s shitty work. All call centers pay what seems like&apos;a lot&apos;to people who won&apos;t make much more than that anywhere else.
Lifted from the company website-

Telephone Interviewers are paid for the number of interviews they complete. Part-time Gallup Interviewers in Lincoln average $9.75 to $12.50 per hour or more. Full-time Interviewers average $14.00 to $18.00 per hour or more.

While that&apos;s above the national minimum wage, that&apos;s not going to get you very far after a certain age. Especially on the west coast.

Stop having a shitty attitude to the very people that you&apos;re calling- and that are essentially paying your salaries and understand the point of view on the opposite end of the line. I did the work for months to pay rent and tuition and I got the hell out and never looked back.

There are better jobs out there, find one.

 Gallup Employee on July 23, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Although I appreciate your positivity, Gallup is no way a government organization. For some reason it&apos;s hard for people to understand that Gallup doesn&apos;t just do one thing. Like any other company Gallup has hundreds of clients. They range from hospitals, to banks, to retail stores or health and wellbeing companies even USA Today or CNN. They are not&quot;always about the census&quot;or&quot;always about politics&quot;The topics vary heavily and over half of the time we have specific information from a company that you do business with that is interested in your thoughts on how they can improve the customer service. It&apos;s a great way to improve your experiences at places you visit frequently so when they call listen to what they have to say and then decide if you want to take part in it or not.
 calavier on July 23, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
The Gallup Organization called me, and I wasn&apos;t around to answer the phone, however, they are a government organization which asks questions that would go on the Census, however, they are optional, that&apos;s why they call. The are not a telemarketing company, therefore, the do not call list does not prevent them from calling
 suejuly on July 18, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
Gallup called me on a Sunday afternoon at home. The questions were all over the place - they didn&apos;t seem to follow logically. The young man HAD to follow his script no matter what I said to him - and had to announce all the choices on multiple choice questions even tho the answer was obvious to me and i had already answered it. I have no idea what possible usefulness this survey could lead to.

Will All Telemarketing Calls Stop If I Register?
#
If I register my number on the National Do Not Call Registry, will it stop all telemarketing calls?

No. Placing your number on the National Do Not Call Registry will stop most telemarketing calls, but not all. Because of limitations in the jurisdiction of the FTC and FCC, calls from or on behalf of political organizations, charities, and telephone surveyors would still be permitted, as would calls from companies with which you have an existing business relationship, or those to whom you’ve provided express agreement in writing to receive their calls. However, if you ask a company with which you have an existing business relationship to place your number on its own do-not-call list, it must honor your request. You should keep a record of the date you make the request.
 Annoyed with People on July 9, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Kid- You are exactly what&apos;s wrong with America. Stay on the phone for 10 seconds and we would screen you out. Of course we don&apos;t ask for opinions from 10 year olds, that&apos;s usually the 1st or 2nd question we ask and then you&apos;d never get called again, but you are so impatient you probably just keep hanging up, oddly enough we don&apos;t have telepathic powers and can&apos;t determine your age based on your hangup rate so we will continue to call until you tell us.

 Former Interviewer on July 6, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
I think it&apos;s really important that people read more of these posts before you post something else here.

Many people have commented on things that are easily preventable.
1) If you receive a call from Gallup, answer when you can and politely decline the interview. If you do not want to use your minutes on your phone, either ignore with the calls you will be receiving for a week or take a second to answer and decline.

2) Gallup is not a part of the do not call list. There were ways described in previous posts to have your number removed. Gallup IS NOT a telemarketing company.

3) You&apos;re talking to a real person who does this for their job. They have feelings and empty wallets. There is absolutely no need to scream, curse, or be rude to them. They&apos;re just doing the job&quot;to help you be heard.&quot;
Interviewers do their best to get through the survey as quickly as you allow them to and will usually give a good estimation of how long the survey will take.

4) Sometimes Gallup does get the wrong information from the companies who pay to have the survey or follow-up done. If it is incorrect, be clear about it and the interviewer&apos;s job is to code the survey so it can be taken care of.
This doesn&apos;t happen too often, though.

5) The interviewer doesn&apos;t have control over when you are called unless you have given a specific call back time.
Chill out. Seriously. If it&apos;s bad timing, just tell them to call again later or take 2 seconds to confirm you are the person they are wishing to speak to and then ask to not be called again.

Gallup was created for your benefit, people. Take advantage of it and do something nice for someone else while you&apos;re at it.

Again......
GALLUP IS NOT A PART OF THE DO NOT CALL LIST.
So please stop saying that you are on the DNC list...it really doesn&apos;t mean anything in this situation and they&apos;ll just keep calling! :)
 I am the end of the world on July 5, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Listen up you fucks,

First of all, I want to make something very clear. It’s not gallop, it’s not gallap. It’s Gallup. Retards. If you’re going to complain about a specific company, make sure you intelligent enough to spell the company’s name right. You’re the reason we have the‘no child left behind’law. But to be fair, those of you who did, in fact, graduate high school, probably are not smart enough to understand what I’m saying anyways.

This will solve all your problems:

If you don’t know what Gallup is, look it up. It’s probably something easy like www.gallup.com.

It would be pointless to leave a message because it’s an outgoing call center. For those of you who are not smart enough to know what I’m talking about, it means Gallup doesn’t accept incoming calls.

Gallup calls throughout the day. Not everyone eats at 6:30. Or has to put a child to bed. Don’t get angry. Gallup doesn’t know your schedule.

Oh, and to all of you who think you can get Gallup shut down, there’s a reason Gallup has been running for 50+ years, it’s because the FDA doesn’t give a shit and if they haven’t shut Gallup down now, they probably won’t. It&apos;s Because Gallup isn’t doing anything wrong.

And to all of you, who these calls honestly piss you off to tears, then you should probably disconnect the phone and spend the day coloring where you can’t be harmed.
 You&apos;re all assholes on July 5, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
You&apos;re all assholes. There is a simple life lesson here. Do unto others as you would have done unto you. If you are nice to me, I will be nice to you. If you&apos;re an asshole to me, I&apos;ll be an asshole to you. Yell at me, cuss at me, beep the phone in my ear, blow a whistle, hang up on me...do what you will. You will just go back in the system and get called back. Over and over and over and over again. So be a bitch to me. It&apos;s cool. I&apos;ll talk to you tomorrow!

You are all the people we laugh at on a daily basis. You&apos;re all ignorant. Gallup does all kinds of things besides political surveys. Dozens of companies hire us to do their customer satisfaction surveys, banks included. If youd just stay on the phone for 30 seconds you&apos;d realize we don&apos;t ask any personal information.
We don&apos;t take you off our list unless we know you&apos;re the person we&apos;re looking for. In other words answering the phone and screaming only makes us laugh and puts you back in the system to be called back. Take the 30 seconds to actually talk to us and you&apos;ll be taken off much quicker. Dumbasses.
 Ignorance abound on July 5, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Do research before you slam down your caps lock and start raging.

1. The&quot;Do not call list&quot;does not apply to polling companies.

2. If you do not want to participate, communication is key. Not answering your phone, slamming it down, or being rude is not going to stop the calling. You need to answer and then communicate to them that you are not only uninterested, but would like to be removed.

3. They aren&apos;t out to get you, they are a legitimate company.

It takes a little self control and some 3rd grade logic to be removed from the calling list.
Yet it takes the intellect of an adult to realized that taking a poll is a civic duty, and a privilege.

I just received a call (which I didn&apos;t answer) from this number at 11PM. Now, I have no problem taking a survey;in fact, I&apos;d even like to participate. However, is 11PM appropriate? Unless they&apos;re performing a study on how many political-minded individuals stay up after 11PM, I can&apos;t find the logic behind this call.
 norma1047 on June 23, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
Received a call - and simply let them know that I wasn&apos;t interested in a survey call to my cell phone. It&apos;s a privacy issue for me. I&apos;m not talking to anyone who phones my cell. They need to send e-mail or paper surveys so that they can be confirmed prior to discussion. The organization who is paying them for surveys is wasteing their money when the call goes to an intelligient person.

Companies pay big bucks to hire companies such as&quot;gaullup&quot;as some of you say to take surveys of their clients/customers to make sure that they are meeting the needs for everyone! Take the time to take the survey. What&apos;s 5 mins? Sometimes is means someones job!
 Julie on June 7, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
They have called my cell phone twice in three days. I talked to them the first time and said No! I didn&apos;t want to be part of a survey. Why are they calling me? How did they get my number?
 James on June 7, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
These people are annoying pests. Caller ID says&quot;Gallop Poll&quot;They have called us 4 times wanting us to participate in a survey. We continue to tell them, We don&apos;t do surveys! and they continue to call back!
 Former Employee on May 30, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Just Reading through here I want to clear a few things up:

Yes.&apos;Tis True,&apos;tis true. O god I love saying this. Gallup is NOT on the DO NOT CALL LIST.

Why? They are NOT TELEMARKETERS.

AND AlSO, They DO, do BANK SURVEYS!

I don&apos;t know how scammers work, but gallup Does do bank surveys. However, they dont ask any personal acct. info (numbers,pins,etc.) They might have you confirm a few things, Like name, if you visited, and that you have an acct.

Seriously, gallup doesnt call ppl because they like to talk to stupid fucks like you all, they get paid by banks and newspapers to gather the publics opinion.
If you dont believe me, I don&apos;t care. I quit thier b/c people like you made me want to cry everytime I left! Literally.
 Former Employee on May 30, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
1.Gallup has never sold anything, and it is most unlikely that they ever will. They do market research.
2. Since they do not sell anything, thier employees aren&apos;t trying to scam or hassle you.
3. Because they aren&apos;t trying to fuck with you, it would be nice if you would treat them as human beings and just say no thanks if they call.
4. Because people have a problem with being civil, they often hang up or cus then, without giving the caller to explain thier purpose, hang up right away.
5. Because Gallup was asked to call that person by that person&apos;s bank the must code (code is what the put into thier computers) this as a&quot;call back&quot;.
6.Because people are so fucking rude the first time, the often get called back over and over.
7. Because people are so hateful on the first call, thier 2nd,3rd, or 4th calls aren&apos;t mutch better.
8. Because people are so fucking rude, people who work at Gallup often leave the night getting paid very little,
9.Because rather than pay by they hour, Gallup pays by the number of surveys they complete in a night.
10. Because people were so rude, I quit gallup after working too many nights after not being able to pay my bills when I got 94 cents for an hour.
11. Okay, that 94 cents an hour only happened once, but I was barely making minimum on average.
12. I hope you that if you get called you take the survey, help some poor kid (literaly) and live the rest of your life in peace. (or atleast say&apos;no thank you, I would not like to take part in this survey&apos;).
p.s. Must responses are on a scale of 1-5 or 1-10, just give the goddamn number. (it will make your survey much, much shorter)

o, and colin dragon is a real worker.
 Kathy on May 28, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
They have called me twice this week. What really irritates me is that they won&apos;t leave a message. If I knew that they wanted to know if I was happy with a service I received, I would not have a problem talking to them. Since they won&apos;t tell me, I won&apos;t tell them!!

I use to have unlisted number. I kept getting calls on my unlisted number. I asked the caller how he got my number. He sd if a number is unlisted the way they get all number is to call consequtive numbers. I.E. 624-1234 624-1235 624-1236, etc. FYI what I learned.

 Former Gallup Interviewer on May 6, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
Tips on Gallup poll calls.

1) If they ask your name, tell them your name. Interviewers have to code for call backs if they don&apos;t reach the person they have on the screen. So if you don&apos;t give them your name, they will have to put you down for a call back.

2) Don&apos;t hang up on interviewers. For two reasons. First of all, its liable to get you called back anyway cause the surveys is most likely almost done (usually how it goes). And secondly because you have probably ruined some poor person&apos;s night by sucking up their dialing time without getting a complete. Keeping on quota can be a VERY stressful proposal, so please, don&apos;t do that to them. If you are pressed for time, ask how long it will be. If you don&apos;t want to do it...just say so.

3) Gallup interviewers have ZERO desire to hassle you. They don&apos;t want to talk to you if you don&apos;t want to do a survey, I promise you. They make their living on COMPLETED surveys. Anything else is time wasted.

Again... if you don&apos;t want to do a survey... say this:&quot;Thanks for calling, but I&apos;m not interested in doing telephone surveys. Please don&apos;t call back. Nothing personal!&quot;. The interviewer should have no problem with this and you should not get called back. If you are especially adamant, ask them to give your number to one of their supervisors for permanent deletion. They will comply. There is no reason to get mad. It accomplishes nothing.

Other fun facts:

You will get called for 2 reasons:

1) A client gave Gallup your number because they want a follow up. Generally these are randomly selected from eligible individuals, such as a person who had visited a specific bank branch within a specific time frame.

2) Your number was randomly selected. There is a random number generator, which picks an area code (depending on interviewer time, and time zone of area code, and time of day) then generates a random 7 digit number and plugs it in.
This is how the public opinion and political polls are done. On rare occasions only specific regions or counties will be called when a specific issue that is related to only that area is of interest.

3) If you do a Gallup poll, your number will be blocked for at least 6 months. So if you really want to be sure you don&apos;t get called back, take a few minutes out of your day to help some poor sap out.
 Joe Shmoe on May 4, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
The DNC does not apply to Gallup because they do not sell anything. In fact it does not apply to any company that does not sell anything. Gallup is its own organization and is not affiliated with the Us government. Gallup adheres to all TCPA telemarketing laws and Is allowed to call once a day to number until that number refuses 5 times or asks to be taken of the Gallup list. A law has been passed to allow telemarketers to call cell phones. Banking and private companies pay Gallup to do market research for them. They do not buy personal information. You should read the fine print on the DNC and the fine print from your banks and other companies. From a telemarketing god.

Called by 402-952-4444 (they identified themselves as) PNC tonight, referancing a Clark and the number 3175 Gallup. PNC is my new bank name, just changed to that name and I am having problems to say the least with the transition to this new bank name. Caller on the other end asked if I used 3175 Gallup or Clark office and after answering no, hung up on me. My phone is on the national do not call list and unless this is in regard to identity theft, they really should get this right. My next step is to file charges with the local authorities as I have already reported them to the National Registry.
 Duke on April 27, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
I was just talking to my girlfriend on my cell phone, and I got a call from this number, at 8:30 (PST). I&apos;m glad that I didn&apos;t switch over. I didn&apos;t recognize the area code, and I seldom take calls from area codes that I don&apos;t know.
 GPF aka&quot;Superhiway&quot;on April 14, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
They called on my home number but I had it forwarded to my cell. So I didn&apos;t get the correct NAME displayed on the screen since the cell phone shows the number ONLY, along with a city name on occasion.

But I&apos;m assuming it was Gallup as others have stated. I WILL answer the next time they call because I&apos;ve always wondered how they select the people that answer these so-called&quot;Gallup Polls&quot;. If it&apos;s not a poll regarding political questions, then I will kindly tell them that&apos;s the only poll I will answer questions about. I hope the ask me what I think of the&quot;HALF Term Governor, Sarah (&quot;I can see Russia&quot;) Palin&quot;. I&apos;ll certainly have some extended comments about THAT woman.

 Student on March 28, 2010 for 877-242-5587 
I am 19 years old. I was employed at Gallup for three months, trying to make some extra money for college.

I was doing the g1k (political survey). To keep my minimum wage, I needed to complete two of these per hour. And that could mean up to 70 dials. To dial, I simply pressed the enter key. I had no idea who I was calling, whether it was a landline or cell, or even what state they were in.

For Gallup to remove a number from their system, it must have three refusals OR be removed by a manager (I bet you didn&apos;t know...employees are not capable of doing that at our computers.) Also, Gallup employs thousands of people. All across the country, on all different schedules. It is prohibited to save a number unless the survey participant asks for a call-back. So the idea that they are calling to pester you, or to scam you into giving away personal information is misguided and ridiculous.

Most people I worked with were between 18 and 25...most were employed there for tuition reimbursement or because they could not find another job compatible with their school schedule. But that didn&apos;t stop you from screaming at the person who called you...did it?

And people like you, who unleash your frustrations and threats on an anonymous voice over the phone, day after day...are the reason that I quit.

I hope to never again encounter anyone like you.

 Tasuki on March 21, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
As for people saying Gallup never does bank surveys, well, you&apos;re a moron. They&apos;ve been doing customer satisfaction surveys for YEARS. Certain spammers can make it so the caller ID says things to make them seem legit, but Gallup will not try to sell you anything, talk about payments or ask for any personally identifiable information. I&apos;ve been to the hospital so many times through the years that even I knew at the age of 16 what Gallup does! If you don&apos;t want to do an f-ing survey, ask to be taken off of the list. Its that easy. But really, its your bank or hospital that you need to contact, because you could end up on a sample list again. I have a high regard for them because the surveys they do make your visits to the bank or the hospital more pleasant, as in, the surveys grade those places and help improve things if they&apos;re not going so well.

For all you DNC flag wavers, you need to be more educated about the law. If you are a customer somewhere, like a cell phone provider or a bank, or have purchased something from a company, your number can be called for sales and surveys by those companies. And the DNC list also doesn&apos;t apply to market research firms, which includes Gallup, as they are not selling anything. Telemarketing and market research are NOT the same. And with jobs being so hard to come by, I figured people would be more empathetic to call center workers, but apparently not. Everyone is trying to make a living, and everyone needs to chill.

Also, another little FYI: picking up and hanging up without answering will not stop them from calling you again. If you are so against doing a survey, answer and politely ask to be removed from the calling list. Its not that hard to be courteous to people, even when you feel they aren&apos;t being courteous to you. They are just trying to do their jobs.

I have been receiving calls from this number for three days but never answered because I did not recognize the number and no message was ever left, however, I did answer yesterday when they called. The guy said he was part of the Gallup Poll and I was actually eager to answer his questions at first because I thought it was a political phone call. It wasn&apos;t. He wanted information on my experience with my bank. No thanks.

People are so stupid sometimes. This is a company that is trying to make things better for us all! If they are calling you on your cell phone it is because YOU obviously gave your cell phone number out on something. GROW THE HELL UP PEOPLE!
 Amanda on February 22, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
I received a phone call from them and they are taking a survey about the hospital stay that my husband whom has cancer had. I found him actually very pleasant and very understanding and all they want to do is help. They take the answers from the surveys and convey them to the companies to try to make things better for US! People just need to take 5 minutes out of there day and actually do this. About 2 weeks later I received a letter from the hospital saying that they had received my comments and suggestions and they were going to do all they could to make future stays for not only my husband but other cancer patients easier and Thanked me for my time to take the survey. Seriously people this may be you in the future and if it wasnt for people like me who actually take 5 mins to answer the questions, your service would be less than average. Stop txting for 5 mins and do something good.
 Amber on February 16, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
I just got a call from this number asking whether I made a phone call to the Wells Fargo Customer Service Center recently and spoke to&quot;Joe.&quot;

I actually did, but said I didn&apos;t speak to a Joe because it was a woman.

Then the caller said thanks and hung up. WEIRD.

I further request you make readily available a registration on your web page for those of us who are unwilling or unable to participate in your surveys thank you in advance for your cooperation

I also have my number on the&quot;Do not call list&quot;, and realize that Gallup is not selling anything. If I wanted to give them my opinion I&apos;d call them back. Why don;t they leave a message, and why doesn&apos;t their name show up on caller ID? What are they trying to hide?
 Go away Gallup on February 13, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
They called and asked if they could ask questions. The first several were about politics and satisfaction with life but they quickly turned to specific medical questions and even asking if I had a doctor. What is Gallup&apos;s true mission, to obtain personal information about citizens for government use? I hung up on them and find their&quot;poll&quot;to be an invasion of privacy.
 Fumin&apos;on February 5, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
People, WAKE UP!!! Scammers can put ANYTHING as their caller ID. There&apos;s a really widespread scam where a-holes POSE as a big bank, knowing many people will indeed be that bank&apos;s customers. Then they phish for information under the guise of doing a&quot;customer survey,&quot;This sounds EXACTLY like that. Since when has Gallup done polls about customer satisfaction? They do political stuff. If your bank wants to contact you, they&apos;ll do it via your email or within your statement mailing. It&apos;s hilarious but sad to see all the comments from people who say things like&quot;Of course Gallup does banking polls! My wife answered one last week!&quot;

AND, since the science of polling is tied to where you live, it&apos;s completely unlikely they&apos;d be calling cell phones. Best thing is to report it to the FDA as a possible scam outfit.

 New mom @ her wits end on January 29, 2010 for 402-952-4444 
Sorry, I don&apos;t do polls. They&apos;ve called THREE nights in row, the first time they called I said no thank you, and asked that my number be removed form their list. It&apos;s not random, same company called my home phone 3 nights in row, how can you call that random?
I was polite and nice in making it known that I didn&apos;t want to participate, now or ever. It isn&apos;t the end of the world, but when you have a new child,&amp;you have a schedule a brand new schedule to be exact that you&amp;your new child have just gotten used to&amp;everyone you know who has your PERSONAL number all know when to call your home and when not to call your home. I explained this to the caller, but I shouldn&apos;t have had to explain it. I haven&apos;t been to this bank people are talking about, my personal home number is on the DNC list for a reason. I understand that it isn&apos;t the&quot;end of the world&quot;but I went out of my want to make sure my personal home number was on the DNC, I make sure not to give out my personal home number for this reason. Getting calls at odd hours of the night especially after you asked not to be contacted is annoying and it&apos;s not right.
I don&apos;t want to participate in polls I sad that to the woman, I asked not to be contacted ever again and it&apos;s like they have it out for me now. If you don&apos;t have children then you don&apos;t understand, especially when you&apos;re a new mom, and you&apos;ve got a schedule. I am very much a personal person, I do not under any circumstances give out my home number to any company, the companies I do business with have my cell numbers. Personal friends and my family are the only people who know my home number.
Maybe the first call was random, but these last two nights.. haven&apos;t been&quot;random&quot;.

 Henry on December 23, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Oh lord, must I explain everything? Ok, the reason that are calling about a bank visit is to simply see how satisfied you were with your experience, and how the teller did their job. As far as the military thing, they are required to speak to some&quot;cell phone only&quot;house holds, so they have to ask if you have a landline. Now if you DO have a landline, but DO NOT make and recieve calls on it because its only for FAX, MODEM, OR BUSINESS PURPOSES, then they&apos;ll do the survey with you. These are called screeners. Thats all.
 Henry on December 23, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Wow, I am shocked at some of the comments on here. I get it, some people don&apos;t like participating in polls, however it&apos;s not the end of the world if they call you, and if you actually help the person out by completing the survey! If it absolutely bothers you that much, tell them you&apos;re the only one living in the household and therefore the only one they can talk to, and that you don&apos;t want to participate, and not to call. To Cara...actually it IS a random digit dialer...do you know how many number combinations there are? And they aren&apos;t calling every number in your area, heck most people never recieve a call from them. About the PNC bank call. They do a short 4 minute call following up on how the service was and how the teller performed at his/her job on your last visit...and the quicker you answer the poll the quicker it goes, sometimes only 2 or 3 minutes. We&apos;ve all heard polls and surveys before, and more likely than not, we&apos;ve refered to them at some point too! These people are just the employees, paid to make the calls, in order to make a paycheck and feed their families...isn&apos;t that what alot of us do? They&apos;re not trying to sell you something or scam you out of something, they&apos;re only doing a survey. So the next time you get a call from one of these people that one of these comments said should&quot;burn in hell,&quot;realize that its only a person, not much different than you and I trying to make a living. Some of them are college kids, trying to make money to pay for an education, so that they can better their lives....which in turn affects ours believe it or not! I understand the frustration with them calling your cell phone. However, if theres a better time for them to do the survey, say on the weekends, or after 7 or 8 when its free to talk, why not help that individual out? Wouldn&apos;t you appreciate a little help if you were in their shoes? If its just not your thing, be polite to them, they don&apos;t want to upset people. Doing the survey might not only make you feel good about helping out a fellow american, with much the same values as yourself, but it may actually be interesting and fun to do. Like I said, alot of people never even get called by them because they are calling random numbers, unless its a survey following up on a recent bank or heathcare experience. Give them just a moment of your time, its not much to ask for. Not only that, but then they&apos;ll be done calling you. If they do call at a really inopportune time, like a death in the family, which we&apos;ve all had and know what it feels like, tell them you&apos;re going through something and you&apos;d appreciate them not calling. That is if you don&apos;t feel like saying there has been a recent death in the family. They&apos;ll probably get the hint and with cross off your number due to it. Good day all, and be kind to one another. Lets show the world that Americans aren&apos;t rude, or off putting! And I&apos;m not just talking about as far as answering the Gallup Poll or any other polling company. I just mean in general!

If your a Bush Republican or a Obama Democrat it&apos;s probably best people like you do not do the survey. They already get enough of the&quot;standard MSM&quot;responses. So, do us all a favor&amp;keep up the attitudes.

Gallup called for a banking survey tonight. Caller identified himself as Ryan and clearly explained the purpose of the call at the beginning and end. Call took about 13 minutes instead of 10 and some of the questions seemed repetitious. But it wasn&apos;t that bad of a survey, and they did not ask for any personal information other than the name of my bank.
 aaw on December 13, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Got a call from this number and they asked for the parent or gardian of my fifteen year old daughter. I dont understand why. If someone knows why they know my kids name please tell me.
 Daisuki on December 8, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Get privacy directing. Problem solved. If you have privacy directing, you can set it up to not receive calls from unlisted numbers, or calls from certain area codes, etc. Most phone companies have the option to block numbers, area codes, etc. The only one who wouldn&apos;t block unlisted numbers for me was virgin mobile.

Why so angry about Gallup though? Half of the statistics we see are from their polls. I&apos;m sure half of the people complaining will tell me about the president&apos;s approval rating, but do they realize that, that information comes from Gallup polls? I enjoy the surveys, but whatever lol. I got a lot of calls this year from them in regards to a few hospital stays, but honestly, I had no issue because after giving a lot of low scores, the hospital asked what should be improved, etc. In fact, because of those surveys, the hospital gave me a discount. Not saying it&apos;ll happen every time, but the customer satisfaction surveys are important. Market research is an incredible tool, but understandably annoying. I have an unlimited phone plan so it doesn&apos;t cost me any more or any less to do stuff like surveys. Don&apos;t say&quot;I don&apos;t have time&quot;if you really mean&quot;i&apos;m not interested,&quot;because they will reschedule the call.

Unfortunately, Ska is right. The DNC does not apply to market research, or client list telemarketing (which means you buy stuff from a company, they have the right to call you and try to sell you more stuff). They can&apos;t make market research illegal because it is an important tool, especially come election times. You say people work for a living? Call work is work too. One thing I have learned is that you cannot be bitchy to people who are on the phone, because you don&apos;t know who the person is on the line, what they&apos;re dealing with in their own life, and they&apos;re just trying to make ends meet with their call center job. I&apos;ve know people who&apos;s last option was a call center, because of their emotional state made it difficult to do other jobs. You don&apos;t know them, so be polite about stopping the calls. Picking up then hanging up right after is considered a&quot;no answer&quot;and the number will be called again.

Anyway, I&apos;m surprised people think Gallup is some sort of fake company or telemarketing. Turn on CNN or pick up a USweekly some time, and the National Gallup Poll will make appearances with different subjects including Afghanistan, the economy, the 2010 census....they&apos;ll even have stats about cell phone usages, opinions about bank mergers, etc. Gallup did a huge survey right before WWII to get opinions about going to war with Germany and Japan. If you take any classes in business marketing in college, you&apos;ll learn about George Gallup. There was even a calling center in Japan! Its been around for ages. Ok, so if you don&apos;t like it, just ask politely to be removed from Gallup&apos;s databases. Its simple. You&apos;ll stop getting the calls if you just pick up the first time.

Really, though, I find it interesting that those of us who are incredibly interested in public trends and politics have no issues with Gallup, but I guess that&apos;s what Gallup is all about, that is, public opinion!
 ska on December 8, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
The national do not call list does not apply to market research companies. If you want the calls to stop, answer the phone when they call and asked to be permanently removed. When companies hit answering machines, they will call back at a different time to see if they can get a hold of you. For crying out loud, answering ONCE could end a series of phone calls. The companies DO have the ability to resolve your number, and make it so the auto-dialer will NOT call the series of numbers again. Auto-dialers just randomly pick a series of numbers and then call them, so people get fax machines, modems, disconnected numbers, etc.

Before getting upset about the DNC, remember to do some research on the law before getting so angry. The DNC does not apply to market research (which is NOT telemarketing, Gallup NEVER sells anything) and it doesn&apos;t even apply to certain types of telemarketing. It mostly applies to random dialing, cold calling to sell things, etc.

If you are getting a lot of calls to do bank or hospital surveys, call the BUSINESS for which the survey is being done, and ask to not be put on client samples. Otherwise, just answer the phone and ask to be removed completely. Sometimes you might get called again, but just stay calm and ask to be removed again. These companies have no way for you to call back, and cannot leave a message because what would be the point of doing so?

Our household does NOT respond to unknown callers, especially if they cannot leave a message so don&apos;t waste your time calling!

In my opinion it should be illegal for this or any company to call my phone without my permission. I pay for phone service for my own use and for those I want to hear from. I no longer answer my home phone, everyone who calls leaves a message or doesn&apos;t get through to us. My cell phone I will not answer anything that is not in a area code and number I recongnize. Stop wasting your time and my time I am not answering your call.

I don&apos;t appreciate getting any kind of call on my phone from someone that I did not give my number to. I pay for this phone for my own personal use not the use of surveys and telemarketers. Random number dialing should not be allowed and does not excuse these annoying calls. The good news is I don&apos;t answer any call that comes up blocked or from a number I don&apos;t recognize.

I received a call from them on my cell phone at 4:40PM. I was in a noisy area so couldn&apos;t make-out everything he had to say. He did say he was with a survey and wanted to ask a few questions about the US Military. Normally I would have hung-up but since I support our military, I wanted to answer the questions. He first wanted to know if he caught me on my cell phone, and then wanted to know if I had a land-line and if I only used it for fax or internet connections. I told him I also received phone calls on the land-line. He then hung-up never asking any question about the military. I found this call very strange and disturbing.

I did not pick up either time. I&apos;m on the DNC, and did not recognize the number, so why bother.

I have a set of speakers on my laptop and have a hard rock station streaming quietly in the background until these calls come in - then I simply crank up the volume and set my phone in front of the speaker. I wait about 30 seconds and then hang up and turn down the noise. It&apos;s actually fun - I may get a police whistle soon and try that as well.

How to stop calls from this number.

There’s a lot of misinformation on this page, so here is some factual information if you received a call from 402-952-4444:

Who is calling? The calls come from Gallup, the well-known survey and polling company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. They want to ask you questions as part of one of their surveys.

Are they trying to sell me something? Absolutely not. They just want to ask you questions for their survey.

Can I get them to stop calling me? Sure, it’s simple. Gallup really isn’t trying to annoy you, so just send a polite e-mail to them at galluphelp@gallup.com asking them to block your phone number. Be sure to include your phone number. They’ll block your number so it can’t be called by anyone at Gallup again. They’ll even send a polite response letting you know when the block is in place. The only down side is that, when you hear public opinion polls reported in the news, you’ll know that your opinion couldn’t be included. Much like you can’t complain about who won an election if you chose not to vote, but the choice is up to you.

What kind of questions do they ask? While Gallup is most famous for political polls, they conduct surveys on lots of different subjects like current events, health issues, leisure activities, consumer habits, etc. You may be asked questions on a variety of subjects during your one call. It’s a great way to let your voice be heard, and our leaders, like the general public, DO listen. You can see the results of many of the surveys on Gallup’s Web site, www.gallup.com

They asked about my bank. Is that legitimate? Yes, several of Gallup’s clients are banks who employ Gallup to conduct customer satisfaction surveys on their behalf. Bank employees may receive bonuses or other incentives based on the quality of service you report. Better service for you–more money for them–everyone wins. Don’t worry, though, your bank didn’t give Gallup any of your account details, and the interviewer won’t ask for any financial details. They just want to be sure you were treated well the last time you visited the bank.

How did they get my phone number? It depends. In the above example of a customer satisfaction survey, the company with whom you did business provided your name and phone number. In the case of other surveys, your number may have been randomly generated by computer. This random selection process is important for many surveys, since the random nature of the sample group allows Gallup to generalize the results to the entire population.

Why did they call my cell phone? Since many Americans, especially young Americans, are dropping their land line phones in favor of cell phones (nearly 15% last I heard), it’s important that Gallup reach cell phone users to include the opinions of that demographic group in their surveys.

Why do they call me when I’m on the National Do Not Call Registry? The National Do Not Call Registry applies to any plan, program, or campaign to sell goods or services through interstate phone calls. Since Gallup interviewers are conducting polls and opinion surveys - not selling anything - the registry does not apply to these calls. You’d probably be surprised at the number of inquiries Gallup receives from people on the Do Not Call Registry who want to be sure they are still eligible to participate in surveys and make their opinions known. In fact, they get way more requests from people who want to volunteer for the surveys than from people who want to have their numbers blocked–but they’ll be happy to block your phone number if you send them an e-mail as explained above. For factual information on the National Do Not Call Registry, please visit https://www.donotcall.gov/faq/faqdefault.aspx 

I have questions or comments for Gallup. How can I contact them? First, try their Web site, www.gallup.com. There’s lots of interesting information there. Or, send them an e-mail at galluphelp@gallup.com . They read all reasonable e-mails and do their best to respond in most cases. Of course, they don’t bother with obscene or rude e-mails–they have delete keys on their keyboards, just like you do.
 DC on June 17, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
It seems that organizations like Gallup are exempt from the do not call list. Also, cell phone numbers are now available nationwide to these organizations.
 Calls Stopped! on June 16, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Yes, this number does belong to Gallup. After 3 days in a row getting calls from Gallup, I requested they stop and they did! This is what I did.

I never called Gallup on the phone. I looked up (402) 952-4444 online and found it belongs to The Gallup Org.

1. Went to their Contact page on gallup.com &gt; click here &gt;&gt; http://www.gallup.com/ContactUs/Default.aspx 

2. Entered my name, email address, and phone number (all required if you want them to stop)

3. Entered this message &gt;&gt; I started receiving calls from (402) 952-4444 on my cell phone for a survey, no doubt. After searching online, I have found this number belongs to the Gallup Organization in Omaha, NE. I realize the Gallup Organization doesn&apos;t have to abide by the National Do Not Call Registry since they are a survey company, but I&apos;m on the National Do Not Call Registry because I DO NOT WANT to receive unimportant phone calls like these. How do I get you to STOP calling me? Please remove my number from your lists.

Two days later, I received this email from Gallup &gt;&gt; We coordinated with our long distance provider to have your phone number (my # removed for privacy) permanently&quot;blocked&quot;so it can never be dialed by anyone at Gallup again.

I have not had another call from Gallup.
 Disappointed in my countrymen on June 6, 2009 for 877-242-5587 
Alright you people... you are the reason the rest of the world hates us. These are polls you hear about on the national news. This isn&apos;t some giant conspiracy to get your info or sell you anything. Gallup DOESN&apos;T know who you are. They don&apos;t know your name, your address, anything. It is a random digit dialer that puts 10 numbers together and dials it. They call fax machines, businesses, disconnected numbers, etc.

It takes real people to make polls happen. They aren&apos;t harassing you. They aren&apos;t telemarketers, which makes them exempt from the DNC list. If you wish to no participate, simply say,&quot;I would not like to participate in this survey. Have a good night&quot;and hang up the phone.

This isn&apos;t rocket science, and the fact you don&apos;t know who the Gallup polls are and what impact they have in this country is pretty pathetic.

 MVGEO on May 7, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
How do they get your number ?? I answered the call and went along with it. I was mislead as to the nature of the survey, FIRST I was made to beleive it was a&quot;Cell Phone&quot;survey, I was asked if I had a landline, if I used my cellphone for business or personal use, I was even asked if I was talking on a cell phone. Then he started asking me political questions about Obama performance approval and what is the biggest problem the US faces, at that point I terminated the call.
 Jim on May 6, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I would like to make a suggestion to everyone who reads this list.

Give them bad answers and skew their results, for example answer NO or YES or alternate YES?NO to everything.

We pay for our telepone not them and they are not abiding by the do not call list, so I say mess with them !!!
 Annoyed on May 6, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I started getting these calls last week on my mobile even though I&apos;m on the DNC List. Since they are doing a survey rather than marketing, they are exempt.

I called the toll-free Princeton, NJ number (make them pay for the call) 800-888-5493 and they transferred me to the Omaha, NE center from which the calls originate. There, I actually managed to talk to a real person. Evidently, my mobile phone number was randomly generated to participate in a survey. Since I never answered the call, the computer kept calling back.

Gallup entered my phone number in their&quot;blocked&quot;list. That should stop the calls.

By the way, I did get a toll-free number to Omaha, NE as part of the conversation. I recommend everyone call it to request getting on the blocked phone number list.

This 402 number appeared on my boyfriend&apos;s recent calls, but for some reason, i couldn&apos;t figure out who he was with at the exact moment, because he must have used someone else&apos;s phone....anyways, as pointless as this comment is, i&apos;m still pissed off at the fact that his phone is off and i have no idea who he is with right now. Seeing this 402 number just wasn&apos;t helpful in my situation. Funny thing is, HE made the call to that survey number, and he never received an incoming call from that number........suspicious?? i know.
 mjr on April 16, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
They called said survey gallup Poll to my 13 year old son about alcohol. number is on do not call list and was asked not to call again and remove from list. The next day he gets the same call again. this pisses me off.

I agree with just about everyone else here. I do not appreciate being harrassed at home and work by companies like this.
 AB on April 7, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I recd a call today no vm too.
I agree with some of you as well. This is a reputable company trying to get information for their legit surveys.
Get real people, if you know its a # you arent recognizing DONT ANSWER and stop your dam complaining....winers!

 CJofCA on April 5, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Received a call yesterday on my cell, no VM. Called again today so I answered. She started into her pitch (after the computer connected her). I interrupted and told her to remove my number and asked if she understood. She said yes and launched into her pitch again so I hung up. We&apos;ll see if they call back. Anyone have the personal cell numbers of their executive board? I&apos;d like to give them several calls in the middle of the night.
 Tammy on March 30, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I received one of these calls on my cellphone late last night. All telemarketers that call my cell, which you know who they are by the phone numbers, I answer it by saying&quot;hello&quot;. This connects you to the person. If you dont say hello the phone is silent. I guess your voice prompts them to get connected to the call or something. I have a airhorn close to my cell at night at all times. After saying hello and actually hearing a humans voice, I blow them with the airhorn. This always makes them hang up and have not received a call back from most of them. If I do, then the next blast is longer. This really seems to work!
 Coco on March 24, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I received 6 calls in one day from 402-952-4444! Seriously isnt that considered stalking? They werent decent times either... 5am, 8am, 1pm, 8pm, 11:30pm. Seriously That isnt fair. Almost midnight and they are still calling me?! So rude. I dont even know how they got my cell number but it sucks.
 Hammer on March 21, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I think they should be charged a heavy fine for calling people on the personal cell phones. I&apos;d say more but it would have to be censored.
 santa barbara on March 20, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Call 1(800) 788-9987 and ask to be removed from their call list.

how many times do i need to keep telling this company to stop calling my cell phone? thankfully they dont have my house phone. I&quot;ve been on a DNC list for quite some time now. How long does it take for them to get the message NOT TO CALL ?
 None on March 12, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I recieved a call from this number, but did not accept their call. They did not leave a voice mail.
 Anonymous on March 10, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Also, it might not be a random poll. It could be a call on behalf of your bank, possibly Lexus or toyota financial, a hospital you visited, etc...

these companies pay gallup to collect customer satisfaction information. if you don&apos;t have to enough patience and time to help better the exact business you are a customer of, then you obviously don&apos;t care. so just say you don&apos;t want to do it and to&quot;Hard refuse&quot;you and tell them a person who used to work at Gallup says that.

Don&apos;t say&quot;i don&apos;t have enough time right now&quot;or just hangup, because you WILL be called back when your # recirculates. Again, the only way to get your # off the list is to tell them to remove it from the database aka, a&quot;hard refusal&quot;
 Anonymous on March 10, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
LOL at all of you foolish people. Do some research or some logical thinking before you look so dumb. I used to work at gallup and i find it hilarious all of the things people say. You all think you&apos;re too good or too important to take a phone call, as if 10 seconds if your time is just&quot;too much&quot;while you&apos;re sitting and watching T.V.

Anyway, people, use your brain.

They are NOT TELEMARKETERS. They are a well respected company that is payed millions of dollars by Census and other companies to collect information to BETTER your life. That&apos;s right, it&apos;s not a scam, it&apos;s to COLLECT INFORMATION.

I laughed so loud at the people saying&quot;they are up to no good&quot;&quot;they just don&apos;t understand&quot;

Let me inform you uneducated people.

1. It&apos;s a random digit dialer in specific areas. therefore, they don&apos;t know your name. The system. If you don&apos;t answer, the system WILL keep calling you until you either
A. Take the survey/poll
B. Outlast the survey (don&apos;t answer for the time they call you, could be 6 months)
or C. TELL THEM TO TAKE YOU OFF THE LIST!!!!!!! WOW, SOUNDS LOGICAL RIGHT?? hMMMM

2. The census bureau needs this information to better our lives. if we don&apos;t report back how we are living, how will they know what to work on? Makes sense doesn&apos;t it?

3. None of this information you give is linked to you personally, it&apos;s an anonymous poll in YOUR AREA.

So people, let&apos;s use some logical, simple grade school problem solving. Answer your damn phone politely, tell them to take you off the list politely, and bam, you won&apos;t get a call again because your number is erased from the database. Simple enough right? Then again this is america and everyone is sooooooo lazy. good grief
 annoyed on March 7, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
If I don&apos;t answer the first time and you don&apos;t leave a message, you&apos;re telling me that its not even important to you to have called me in the first place. So calling me another 8 times is just a waste of your time and an annoyance to me.
 vic on March 7, 2009 for 402-952-4444

 EverEddie on March 4, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Got two cell phone calls from 409-952-4444 in early March, 2009. Answered neither call, so they showed as&quot;missed calls&quot;.
 Solution on February 23, 2009 for 877-242-5587 
Folks, Email GallupHelp@gallup.com to request that you get your number permanently&quot;blocked.&quot;I got a quick response from Gallup, and they said they&apos;d coordinated with their long distance provider to have my phone number blocked so it can never be dialed by anyone at Gallup again. They also offered to send me Gallup&apos;s Respondent&apos;s Bill of Rights. Also was home when a live person from Gallup called (before I got the email response) and asked her to take me off, which she did so graciously. So, it can work.
 Jim on February 21, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Gallup called me on February 21, 2009. They indicated that they were doing a survey and it would be recorded. Initially the questions were of a political nature, which is what I expected and which I was willing to provide my input on. Then the caller transitioned into asking personal medical questions. That was an invasion of privacy, so I terminated the call. I don&apos;t what these guys are up to, but it&apos;s clearly no good.

 Marilyn on February 12, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
Gallup continues to call all throughout the day never saying anything or leaving a message when I do not answer. This has been happening for about 2 months. How does one avoid this if you have already listed your telephone number with the DNC registry? I feel since I am responsible for paying my telephone bill, I should be the one to determine who calls me in this manner and the telephone company that I faithfully pay each month should be able to assist me in getting this stopped.

I&apos;m sure someone has pointed this out...someone must have figured this out or known about it...
The DO NOT CALL list has nothing to do with surveys, really. The DO NOT CALL list is only supposed to take you off of telemarketers&apos;lists...
Survey people are NOT telemarketers. They&apos;re not trying to sell you anything. They&apos;re trying to collect information for polling data.
 CF on February 8, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I have just recently been getting this strange number on my phone. The fact that they associate themselves with the US Government REALLY bothers me and makes me want to call someone concerning fraud!! This is Sunday afternoon, and I just got a call! Are you Serious, people?!!! They ask if they have reached me on my cell phone, and I respond, DO NOT CALL ME AT THIS NUMBER!! What can we do about this annoying problem???
 Kristin on February 7, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
I received a call on my CELL and answered the first time. Finding out it was a survey, I said&quot;not interested&quot;and hung up. They have continued to call EVERY DAY since for over a week straight! I have not answered and don&apos;t know if I should to tell them to stop! It wastes my minutes!!
 HeleninFLA on February 5, 2009 for 402-952-4444

Have a nice dayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
 HeleninFLA on February 5, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
The calls started after I opened up a checking account with Wachovia Bank.
You never know who gave out your phone number and other information. Or for that matter, they gave your phone number for a price! Yes, your information was sold!
 Atlanta Furstrated on February 2, 2009 for 402-952-4444

 Travis on January 29, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
They called my cell, and I told them I would participate, but this is a cell phone and they would need to take it off of future lists. Then they told me that they were TRYING to reach people on their cell phones! I ended the conversation and wrote a complaint to the state department whom they were conducting the poll for. I am going to try and contact gallup.
 Jerry on January 29, 2009 for 402-952-4444 
It doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re on the DNC list. They have the right to call you. You should just do the survey. I can&apos;t believe people flip out over getting a lousy phone call. Jeez.
 Mr. Mac on January 14, 2009 for 402-952-4444

Gallup Org. doesn&apos;t take no for an answer and won&apos;t stop calling now , calls coming in at 9pm-9:30pm every night. Employees have accents and don&apos;t understand english to well either.
 J on December 3, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
Anyone can go to Gallup.com and click on contact us to relay your message for them to stop calling. Put down the 402-952-4444 number or whatever number is calling down so they know what branch is calling you and can put you on their do not call list.

Cannot find any such Gallup organization company in Washington D.C. or Omaha, NE and the HQ in New Jersey is closed down. Lincoln , Ne has 2 different branches but according to the Omaha BBB all complaints go to New JerseyBBB which is closed so why can&apos;t the OmahaBBB take any complaints on a company in their territory seems a little suspicious.

I might actually consider picking up now, tho, now that I know it&apos;s the Gallup poll people. I wonder what their current poll is about? Has anyone answered&amp;found out? (I thought I saw someone on here say it was about the red cross?)

I have been calls four times by them in the past I can&apos;t remember how many years. They are just taking customer service polls for my area hospital that I seem to be going to often. I believe in not good, but great customer service. How will they know what they did or didn&apos;t do if you do not just answer a few questions. It&apos;s your chance to speak out!
 Anonymous on November 25, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
They called and asked if I had made a recent transaction at my local bank down the street. What kind of survey asks about which banks you go to?!? It made me concerned about an attempt at identity theft and accessing my personal records.
 Bats on November 13, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
I just get a bit put off when any caller doesnt leave a voice message, if it was important enough to call me then leave a message and Gallup didnt,
As far as the person with so little life they are flaming and insuting people on here, well, duh, my guess is they work for Gallup, they get a pay check from making annoying calls to people.
 S on November 11, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
We are on the&quot;Do Not Call&quot;list so I have sent a complaint about them to the FTC.

Please stop calling!
 Ralph on November 10, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
No need to rant and rave! A simple, polite e-mail to Gallup will get your phone number blocked so you never receive another call from them. You&apos;ll find they&apos;re very polite and helpful if you are the same. Send your phone number and a request that it be blocked to galluphelp@gallup.com 

Gallup isn&apos;t selling anything - they&apos;re asking for your opinion. Did you listen to the news prior to the recent election to find out who was leading? These phone calls were the source of those numbers. Gallup also conducts customer satisfaction surveys for lots of companies, including banks, car manufacturers, hotels, hospitals, etc. While you may find the calls annoying, many people are happy to answer a few questions that will improve service at these companies.

In any case, the National Do Not Call Registry doesn&apos;t apply to pollsters, so they&apos;re allowed to call unless you ask them to stop. And all you have to do is send the e-mail mentioned above.
 Alicia on November 8, 2008 for 402-952-4444

 NJ from PA on November 7, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
I think we probably have to answer and tell them&quot;Put me on your DO NOT CALL list&quot;That&apos;s supposed to stop them from calling. I&apos;ll try it and see what happens. So far, they&apos;ve called my home during the day so I haven&apos;t been able to tell them off yet.
 poupee on November 2, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
Just got that call...If I do not recognize a number, I don&apos;t answer. If they call me right back, I may decide to answer...maybe it&apos;s important. My point? If you ain&apos;t in my circle and I didn&apos;t authorize you to call me...please don&apos;t. But I agree with the person who said to give them a unique story. LOL! Anyway, be nice when telling the stories cause after all the poor callers are only doing their jobs.

If enough people complain they will take action.

I&apos;m thinking possible class action suit for harrassment (I&apos;ve told them several times to stop and remove my number to no avail). Any lawyers out there want to make some cash?
 Anon on October 20, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
Actually Telemarketers and Surveys are not the same thing so in the bylaws of the Do Not Call act it is technically fine for them to call as long as they are not soliciting any type of service or product. As long as the company is legit and actually doing a survey and not someone running a scam.
 sheesh on October 7, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
Aaron you ignorant foreigner go home , foreigners are more rude than Americans that&apos;s a FACT. DNC listed phone numbers means DO NOT CALL LIST for telemarketers and surveys it&apos;s against the LAW to call our numbers. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS WE ARE SPELLING HERE? Who wants to do a STUPID survey anyways. Obviously you don&apos;t have a real life working for a survey company.

Gallup shows on the caller ID. Caller asks for Patricia. I have had this number for years and there has never been a Patricia here or anyone else calling for Patricia. I ask to be removed from the list and do not call again but they keep calling and it is after 800pm.
There is no privacy in this country anymore. In fact, I do social survey research myself at times, but if someone declines to participate, the ethical thing to do is to not call them again.
 Kris on September 18, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
I have had at least two calls a day from this number for a week straight. Anyone trying to reach me knows, if you&apos;re name doesnt come up on my phone when you call and I do not recognize the #, I never answer. Never. If you want me to call you back you gotta leave a message. Pretty simple - I ignore these folks just like I do any other # I do not know.

I&apos;m fed up with these incessant nuisance calls. The caller said they got my cell phone ( I&apos;ve been called by this number dozens of times.) by random dialing. Who would believe my cell phone is that much more random than any other of our six phones in the household? Clue: People are not that ignorant.
 Katie on July 30, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
I went on their web page, clicked on contact us. emailed and asked to be removed from their calling list. They responded that day and said they would remove me. we will see, havent received any more calls yet.
 C-lo on July 29, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
The number is close to 404 which is an Atlanta area code so when I see it I just answer thinking it&apos;s a business/personal call. Not going to make that mistake again. This was my cell phone as well. I asked how they got the number and the girl said it was randomly generated.

My history so far:
First call, they hung up after like 2 seconds of answering.
Second call, not realizing who it was I made the mistake of going into the survey, was in one of those moods so I went throug with it. The survey was all about the banking crisis and listed 5 banks and wanted to know how I feel about them 1 to 7 scale....and so on. (Commerce, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wachovia, Wells Fargo)

I objected to receiving anymore phone calls from them as that was a question I was given in regards to future phone calls...have yet to get another phone call so far. Did anyone get this option? I doubt it means they&apos;ll call again but will see.

If they want our&quot;opinion&quot;and want to burn our cell phone minutes, maybe you should pay us!!!

My caller ID kept showing this number and I thinking Gallup may be the Gallup Polls I am so used to hearing about, I finally picked up. It wasn&apos;t actually Gallup, it was someone calling from PNC Bank. So maybe gallup is doing some sort of survery (read:sales leads) for the bank?
 Todd on June 24, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
The Do not call registry was not intended to protect you from being bothered by people you don&apos;t want to talk to. It was to protect people from being solicited to buy things from companies they don&apos;t have a relationship with. Gallup is not selling anything;they are conducting surveys. If you don&apos;t want them to call you again, then answer the phone when they call and ask them to put your number on their internal do not call list.
 Anonymous in FL on June 15, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
Yes, this company - Gallup, according to my caller ID, keep calling me 2 days in row without even leaving any message.
Actually, today, while my answering was on, I heared 2 guys talking along with kid&apos;s voice in the background, seems the caller did not know his conversation has been recorded.
I am also registered Do-not-call, and am going to file my complaint against this caller.

To the idiot who says Gallup is not a telemarketer;You&apos;re right technically. But anyone who is not an aquaintance, is not invited to call, and constantly harrasses you at YOUR home on YOUR phone when told not to is just as bad. So get that hampster in your head running and, while you&apos;re at it, your head out of you ass. These people are what the NDNC list was created for and intended to stop. The clown congress person or senator who got them exempted because the CEO is his/her brother-in-law is just as bad also. Complain to the feds till they listen!
 Virginia in VA on March 26, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
Comments from NOTATELEMARKETER Feb. 25 are most disturbing and insulting. I, too, am on the national do not call list and understand that Gallup is not a telemarketer, but a poll taker--not covered by DNC. DUH!
HOWEVER, these daily, and sometimes multiple times daily calls to my cell phone while I am going through the grief of my husband&apos;s death are inexcusable. I answered them once, thinking it was someone who needed information about my husband. Finding out that it was a political polster, I told him I was unable and unwilling to talk with them because my loved&apos;one had just died and to take my number off their call list. I was assured that would happen.
their next call was less than 24 hours later. They continue to call. Enough is enough!
 Mr. Winfield on March 12, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
yeah, this number just called me too. I&apos;m also on the Do Not Call List. Kind of rude. They called. Rang once or twice, and hung up. I&apos;m sure when you call back, they&quot;have&quot;you. So I recommend not calling them back. I hate Gallup. They are very annoying. I even hate seeing the building here in Omaha.

I just want to know how they got my cell phone number. I just got rid of a bill collector calling my cell asking for Alejandro. I had to finally yell to get it through their head that no theres no Alejandro here, I&apos;m not Alejandro, I&apos;m not spanish, I don&apos;t have a man named Alejandro, this is my number so stop calling. Never heard form them again, so now this...........

Is there a way to get them to stop calling me? They always wake my husband up during the day. When he answers they ask for me and he is too sleepy to remember to ask to take us off of their list.

Got several calls on Saturday/ Sunday on my cell pjoe. They called again today and said&quot;sorry for the trouble&quot;.
 John in PA on January 28, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
I received a call today with a 2 sec voice mail hang-up. I cut and pasted the number in my ATT Callvantage web console that comes with the voice over IP calling product and now completely block the number from connecting with me in the future. System greeting:&quot;The AT&amp;T;CallVantage Service number you dialed is not taking calls from this number.&quot;Callers get system greeting, can&apos;t leave voicemail, your phone doesn&apos;t ring. Done!

I rec&apos;d two calls on my cell phone, didn&apos;t answer as I didn&apos;t recognize the number. Glad I found this site, now I know not to answer.

This # is for Gallup Polls.
 Don Dillion on January 21, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
I get calls from 402-952-4444, what I do is pick the phone up as soon as I read my caller ID and know it&apos;s someone I do not wish to speak to, then I immediately hang up. I hope this annoys them tremendously!
 Lindz on January 11, 2008 for 402-952-4444 
They have called my cell phone 4 times within one week! It&apos;s so annoying! I am not going to answer my phone. When are they going to give up?!
 Susan on December 12, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
Hey Gallup, why don&apos;t you go call your GRANDMA!!!!

hahaha... that&apos;s excellent.... I&apos;m gonna give the next one of these people who calls me some great stories... Maybe if everyone made up their answers to these stupid surveys, people would stop hiring this company to annoy people who have asked to not receive phone calls !!!!
 Mark on December 4, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
I realize that they don&apos;t have to abide by the Do Not Call List since they are a survey company, but do they really get that great of information from people? I&apos;m on the DNC List because I DO NOT WANT to receive unimportant phone calls like these. If you call me anyways, do I suddenly decide I&apos;m happy that you are bothering me? I either try and waste their time asking stupid questions or I just give them really weird answers that should hold a special place in their reports ( Gay Illegal Immigrant Communists for McCain Unite! )
 Jeni on November 30, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
Wouldn&apos;t be such a big deal if they weren&apos;t calling my cell phone, are THEY going to pay for the minutes?
 Anonymous on November 23, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
stop callen me
 Nathanael on September 20, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
Since they are a survey company, the DNC rules do not apply to them and they can call. They are not selling things, just ask you to take a survey.
 Alize on September 15, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
STOP CALLING ME !!!!!
 Eva on September 14, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
I&apos;m also on the DNC list and I get calls fron this&quot;Gallup&quot;company, that&apos;s really annoying.
 Kim on September 13, 2007 for 402-952-4444 
I received a call from 402-952-4444, I picked up and it was Gallup. They asked me to take a survey. I told them I wasn&apos;t interested and to ake me out of their list.
 Lamont on September 12, 2007 for 402-952-4444
