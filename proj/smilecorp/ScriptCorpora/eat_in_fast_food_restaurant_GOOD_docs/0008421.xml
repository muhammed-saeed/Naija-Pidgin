What to write for&quot;reason for leaving&quot;on application when unjustly fired?
 I worked at a fast food restaurant for 2 years and I got fired for a dumb reason. We were not allowed to use paper cups but china mugs which everyone uses. The mugs get cleaned in the dishwasher but the dishwasher uses the same water for every cycle and i found this unclean. So i used the cups and i got in trouble. My manager said if i want to use a cup, i have to pay for it. My next shift i pay for my cup and drink out of it. Then my managers calls me in her office and fires me for using the paper cup. Now I&apos;m trying to apply for a MUNICIPAL job. I don&apos;t know what to write down for&quot;reason for living&quot;I want to make it something interesting so the employer is curios about me. I thought of a couple of things which i could write,&quot;unjust policy&quot;or&quot;misunderstanding of policy&quot;What should i write down?

 Lie...I will get back to this in a moment.

The employer is not allowed to give a negative reference if they are a reputable company. If they do, they could be liable. If you want to test this, have a friend call from XYX company verifying past employment. They should ask start date, end date, positions worked, ending pay, and finally ask, is there anything else you can tell me about this person. If they give any negative feedback, get an attorney that works on % of return from case.

If no negative feedback to a friend, you know the company knows they can&apos;t give negative feedback. So back to my original advice, lie and stick to that lie in the interview.

Search internet for&quot;good reasons for leaving a job&quot;. Use those reasons.
