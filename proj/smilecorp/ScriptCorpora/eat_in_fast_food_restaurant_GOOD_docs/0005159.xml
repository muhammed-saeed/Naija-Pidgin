This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on Hbrary shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world&apos;s books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that&apos;s often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book&apos;s long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

AMUSEMENTS. 



nnO trace out the origin of amufements, it appeari 
^ that it would be neceffary to go back to tho 
earlieft age» of the world. For, mankind, being 
expofed to a variety of fatiguing labours,^ which 
exhauft both the mind and the body, have at al! 
times exercifed their ingenuity in devifing means 
tQ difpel melancholy, and to revive the deprefled 
(pirits. 

The remedies pointed out by nature for this puf- 
pofe, are reft, proper nourifliment, and cheerful- 
nefs : each day indeed exhibits in the fame indivl- 
4ual a new being, in good or bad fpirits, according 
%o the impreflions made on the animal ceconomy by 
reft, a change of food, and various other circum«

&apos;a AMUSEMENTS 

The mind is loo intimately conneflecl with the 
body not to participate in the evils by which it is 
affefted ; but to the former, reft alone is not fuf- 
ficieni : to revive its powers, and to exhilarate the 
rpirits by a proper ftimulus, a change of obJe£ls, 
ainufing converration, agreeable news, and whtr 
things of the like kind, are necefTaryk 

Every one knows that the fpiriis arc depreHed by

The latter comparifoA has been employed by 
Seneca, who fays, — *• the mind of man is like 
thofe fields, the fertility of which depends on their 
being allowed certain periods of reft, at the proper

long and too affiduous labour exhaufts the mind, 
thrawin&apos;g it into a kind &apos;of languor ; but, that by 
relaxation it is revived, and rendered fitter for re- 
fuming its occupations. 

• How often are people difficulted by problems 
merely of an amufing nature, the. whole folution of

that great prince — the wonder of his age. She 
came, fays the fcripture,&lt;o try his wifdom, by pro-

Of FraSions. 

£. Befides the application of the common rules 
to whole numbers, with which every body is ac- 
quainted, it is fometimes indifpenfably neceflary 
to perform the fame operations with fra£liona]l 
numbers. 

A FraQion is one or more parts of a whole. 
Every fra6lion is expreflfed by two charaflers, 
placed one above the other, with a line between 

them, in this manner : -, ?•,&amp;c. The upper 

chara&amp;er, which is called the numerator^ exprefles 
how many parts are takeiuof the ^whole ; and the 
other, called the denominJ|^, denotes the quality 
of thefe parts. Thus the fraflion i fignifies that 
the whole is. divided into fourths, and that 3 of them 
are taken. 

It hence follows, that a fraQion is greater accord- 
ing as the numerator is greater ; and, on the other 
hand, lefsv as the denominator is greater. | Thus 
T&gt;-^ ; i&lt;i* 2y * neceffary-&apos;iprfequence all 
fraftiftns, the two charafters of which are equal, 
denote exaftly the fame vahae : | =2: 7 c= y = f&amp;c. 

3. To reduce a whole number to a fraQion, which 

ifaall have a determinate denominator, we muft mul- 
tiply the whole number by the given denominator, 
and place the produ6): above the latten Thus 8, 
reduced to a fradion, having 3 for its denominator^

cube, is 2 X 2 X 2, andfoon. Hence it is evideift 
that, to obtain any power whatever of a given quanti- 
ty, it muft be multiplied by itfelf as many times lefs 1, 
as are equal to the number which denotes that power.

INTRODUCTION. ^ 13 

The pbwer of any quantity is expreflfed fpraetimes 
algebraical ly, or numerically, by the figure which 
denotes its degree, as in the following examples: 
fl*, a^t a^, a*,&amp;c. 4*, 4*, 4&apos;, 4*,&amp;c. 

1 1 • An algebraic charafter is fometimes accom- 
panied by two figures, as 2^&apos;. The firft of thefe 
is called the coefficient, and the fecond the exponent: 
the former denotes how many times the quantity is 
added to itfelf ; and the fecond indicates the power. 
Thus, the value of ^, being fuppofed equal to 3, we 
fhall have 2^3 =1 54. 

12. By the root of a quantity, is meant a number 
which being multiplied one or more times by itfelf, 
will give that quantity. There is therefore ^Jifuare 
root, cute root,&amp;c. 

The different roots of quantities may be ex/i^&gt;eflbd 
by the following figns : ^, ^, (/, in this manner 
t/tf, i/a, t/^, y/16, ^27. 

13. We {hall now (hew how to extras the fquare 
&apos; root of any quantity ; that is to fay, how to find 

a number, which being multiplied by itfelf, will 
give that quantity, if it be a complete fquare, or at 
leaft the greateft fquare which it contains. 

EXAMPLE I. 

. Let the number, the fquare root of which is 
required, be 1 156. Firft divide this number from 
right to left into periods of two figures, and then 

. procc^ as folio w5,» : . .

64. Then multiply the la(l numbjar by the fecood 
root 4, and the produ^ wjlftje 3^6, As there is^ 
no remainder, it is a proof that 1156 is a perfeft 
fquare, the root of which is ^. Had the laft pro- 
duft been too large to be fubtrafled, it would havt 
been neceffary to diminifh the laft figure in the rootj 
in order to make it Imall enough for that purpofe.. 

EXAMPLE II-. 

What is the Square Root of the Number 214369? 

As in the preceding example, we mud firft divide 
the number into periods of two, from right to left, 
and there will be as many figures in the root as there 
are periods.

muft be placed after the firft root 4, and alfp after 
8 the divifor ; then multiply 86 by 6, and fubtra£L 
the produfl gt6 from 543. Place the remainder 
27 under 516, and bring down the nejtt period 60^ 
Take, as the divifor of 276, the double of the two 
roots already found, which is 92* Divide 27 by

alfo after 92. Then multiply 923 by 3, and if 
the produft 2769 be fubtrafted from the&quot; number 
2^6^f there will be no remainder. The truth of 
thi|i operation Ihay be proved by fquaring 463 ; 
that is to fay,^ by multiplying it by itfelf*

Of Equations. 

1 4. As certain queftions cannot be eafily refolved 
without fome knowledge of analyfis and equations, 
we fliall here give a (hort explanation of them, and 
fuch as may he eafily underftood. 

By equations is meant the appUcation of numeri- 
cal&apos; and algebraic rules to the foUition of different 
que ff ions, which may be propofed refpeCling 
quantity. 

The firft and moft difHcult thing in analyfls, is to 
comprehend properly the flate of the queflion, and 
the relation which the known quantities bear to the 
unknown, in order that they may be clearly ex- 
prelTed in an equation. 

Every equation is compofed oF two memt)^s, 
fcparated by the ftgn =^ ; and each member may 
conCft of feveral terms. An example of the whole 
may be feen in the following ^qvations : 
7=3+4; 8 — 5=2 + 1; 3x4 = 12; 1 = 3. 

There may be equations alfo conlifting of alge- 
braic quantities alone, or in which arithmetical 
quantities are mixed with algebraic ones, as in the 
following : 
j(-J-^ = «i * — _yz=&lt;i+f; 3a— ^ = 4^ — 2*.

General Rules in regard to Equations. 



^r 



RULE I. 

^S. Any quantity may be tranfpofed froni one 
member of an equation to another, without dei 
ranging the equation, provided that the figns be 
changed. 

Thus, as 12 — 3 =: 9, we may write 12 my 
-+- 3. For the fame reafon if a — x-^ ^b zzzd — jv#. 
we fhall have a ^y — rfssr^-— 3^. 

This method of operation, in regard to equations^ 
is called tranfpofition^ and i$ employq^. when iris 
neceffary to free one member of an equation from 
any quantity connefted with it either by addition or 
fubtraftion. 

RU/LB II» 

16. When an unknown quantity is involved in 
an equation either by multiplication or divifion, it 
may be difengag«i from it, in the firft cafe, by divi- 
fion ; and in the fecond by multiplication. 

For example, if %k -^z 3, then x = - ; and if Z 

. 3 3 

s=: 0, then y ri ^a^ 

This metl^od of difengaging an unknown quantity 
will be more eaflly comprehended, if we- give deter- 
minate values to the quantities « and b. If we sup- 
pofe, for example, that h =5 12» and a = ^jl^ ^^^ 
equations above mentioned will be recUH^Sa to the; 
following, X =r y = 4, y:=zi 24.

Of Ration and Proportions. 

18. Relation or Rdtio is what refults from the coi»-^ 
parifon of two quantities. As two quantities may b# 
compared with each, other two ways, ratio is diflin*^ 
guiilxed into two kinds, arithmetical ^pd geometrical., 

Ariikmetical relation y is that- of two quantities, 
compared with each other by fubtjjtftion^ 

GeometricaJ relation ^ is that of two quantities €om« 
pared with each other by divifion. 

Thus, for example, the arithmetical ratio of i9 
to 4 is 8 ; and the geomeCric«l« ratio of the iame 
quantities, is 3; fot |2 — ^ 4=2; 8, and V z=n 3. 

19. Proportion is an equality oi ratios. As there 
are two kinds of ratio^ tlwe are alio two kinds of pro- 
J)orti»u,^ .arithmetical and geometrical : the firft con- 
fifts in an equality of differences,, and the (^cond la 

n equality qf quotieats^

The firft and laft terms of each of thefe proportions 
are called the extremes ; and the other two, the means.

is the confequent of that which precedes it, tooA tht

When a^continued proportion has more than thi:ee 
terms, it is called a progreffion. Thus -r- t • 3 • 5 ••

arithmetical proportion are, known, we may«eafily 
find the fourth; for if the unknown tQrra be an ex- 
treme, it will be found by fubtrafting the other ex- 
treme from the fum of the means ; smd if it be one 
of the means, by fubtra£liiig the other mean from 
the fum of the extremes. 

If a . b *r c . Xt or if 4 • 4f ••• 3 . 8, .

It hence follows alfo, that if two terms, as a and ^, 

are given, a third arithmetical proportional to them 
may be eafily found, in order to form an arithmetical 
progreflion. For if we fupjpofe the required term tp

X^onfequently, to find a third arithmetical propor- 
tional to two given terms, we muft fubtraf); the firft 
from double the fecond. Thus, the third arithme- 
■^tical proportional to 3 and 7, will be 14 — 3 = 1 1 ; 
and indeed ••• 3 . 7 . 11.

i2tt&amp;of Three. 

27. The Rule of Three /v&amp;an of^eration by which, 
when three terms of a geometrical proportion arc 
known, a fourth, not known, may be found ; and 
it is called Jire3 when the fimiiar&apos; terms increafe 
in the fame ratio. For ej^ample ; if four men per-* 
form fix yards of work in a certain time, it is evi^ 
dent that a greater number muft perform more in 
the fame time. Oil the other hand, if the fimilar 
terms, inilead of increafing in the fame ratio, muft 
decreafe, the rule is called inverfe^ as is the cafe 
in the following example ; if four men perform a 
certain work in eight days, a greater number bl men 
muft perform it in a time proportionally lefs. 

The rule of three di^reS, and the ,rule of three 
inverfe, may be exprefled by the following for* 
mulae : 

Men Men Yards Yards 






Men Men Days Days

The rule of three is compound or fimple, accord- 
ii\g as the terms are compound or fimple; For 
example, the above two formulas exprefs each the 
fimple rule of three. But if it were required to 
divide the profits of a commercial company among 
feveral partners^ who have advanced certain capitals*

for different periods of time, it would be neceffary 
to multiply the capital of each partner by the time, 
which would render the rul€ the compound rule^ of 
three. 

As the rule of three is only the application of thd 
formulae of Theorem ift (23), it is needlefs to 
enlarge farther on this fubje£t.

ARITHMETIC. 



ARITHMETIC and Geometry, according to 
Plato, are the two wings of the mathematician; 
and, indeed, the objeft of all mathematical quef^ 
tions, is to determine the ratios of numbers or of 
magnitudes. It may even be fald, toi:ontinue the 
comparifon of the ancient philofopher, that arith* 
metic is the mathematicians right wing ; for, it is 
certain, that geometrical determinations would ofteil 
a^fibrd very little fatisfa£lion to the mind, if tlie 
ratios, thus determined, could not be reduced to 
numerical ^ratios. This juftifies the common prac«^ 
tice of beginning with arithmetic. 

This fcience prefents a wide field for fpeculatioft 
^d curious refearch ; but in the prefent fele&amp;ioHf 
we iKall confine ourfelves to fuch things as are beft 
calculated to excite the curiofity of thofe who have

Of our Numerical Syjltm^ and tht different kinds 

of Arithmetic. . 

It has been generally obfervcd, that all the nations 
with which we are acquainted, reckon by periods of 
ten ; that is to fay, after having counted the units/ 
as far as ten, tney begin again by adding units to a 
ten ; when they attain to 20, they add units as far 
as 30, or three tens, and fo on in fucceflion, till 
they come to 100, or ten tens ; of ten times a 
hundred they form a thoufand,&amp;c. Did this arif&amp;from neceflity ; was it occafioned by any phyfical 
caufe ; or was it merely the effeft of chance ? 

No one, after the leaft refleftion, will be inclined &apos; 

to afcribe it to chance. It is not only probable, but 

might almoft be proved, that this fyftem derives its 

origin from our phyfical conformation. All men 

have ten fingers, a very few excepted, who by fome 

lufus naturce have twelve. Tfhe firft men began to 

reckon on their fingers. After having exiynufied 

them&quot; by counting the units, it was neceffary for 

them to begin and to count them again, till th^y 

had exhaufted them a fecond time ; then a third 

thne, and fd on. Hence the origin of tens ; which, 

being confined to the fipgers, could not be ca,rried 

beyond the number of ten without forming a new 

tdtal, called a hundred ; then another, confifting of 

ten hundreds, called a thoufand,&amp;c. 

A&apos;&apos;&lt;;urious confequence hence follows ; which is, 
that if nature,&apos; inllead of 10 fingers, had given us 



IN ARITHMETIC. «9 

ta, our numerical fyftem would have been different. 
I After lo, inftead of faying ten plus one or eleven, 
we fliould have afcended by fimple denominations 
to twelve, and fliould have &apos; then counted twelve 
plus one, twelve plus two,&amp;c. as far as two dozens. 
Our hundred would have been twelve dozens, a 
thoufand twelve times twelve dozens,&amp;c. 

A fix fingered people, in all probability, would 
have had an arithmetic of this kind, which indeed 
would not have been inferior to that now in ufe, or

&apos; This method of numeration would have been as 
expeditious, and even more fo than that now unK 
Verfally received. The number of charafters, 
which would have been encreafed only by two, to 
exprefs ten and eleven, would have been as little 
turthenfome to the memory, as the prelent charac- 
ters; and this fyftem would have poffeffed fome 
advantages&apos;, which ought to give iis reafon to regret 
that it was not originally adopted. 

This, however, woUld no doubt havebceri the cafe,

by which it can be divided without a remainder 
JBefides, in this fyftcm the periods of numeration 
would have had the advantage of being divifiblc^ 
the firft from one to twelve, by a&gt;3, 4, 6; the 
fecond, from one to a hundred and forty-four, by 
^» 3* 4» ^» 8, 9, 12, 16, 94, 36, 48, 72 ; whereas, 
in our fyflem, the firft period from one to ten has 
only two divifors, ft and 5 ; the fecond from, one 
to a hundred has only feven, viz. 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 
25. 50, confequently frafiions would have lefs 
frcqucmly occurred in iiumerical operatiqns. 

But what would have been particularly convenient . 
in this mode of numeration, is, that it would have 
introduced into all meafures the duodecimal divifions 
and fubdivifions. Thus, as the foot is divided into 
12 inches, the inch into if lines, and the line into 
twelve points ; the pound, in the like manner, would 
have been divided into 12 ounces, the ounce into 12 
drams, the dram into 1 2 grains, or other denomln 
nations at pleafure ; the day would Have bee^ 
divided into it portions, called hours; the hour 
into 12 others, which would have been equal to iq 
ininutes ; and each of thefe into 12 inferior parts; 
tnd fo on in fucceffion. 

Should, it be afked,&apos; what would have been the 
advantage of this diviPion, we might reply as fol- 
lows : Jt is well known that when it is neceflary 
to divide any meafure into 3, 4, or 6 parts, a whole 
number of meafures of the lower denomination can« 



1 M Ml 



IN ARITHMITKJ. 31 

not always be found, or are found only by chance. 
Thus, the third or tenth of a pound avoirdupois 
does not always give an exa£l number of ounces ; 
and the third of a pound fterling does not give an 
exa£l number of fliillings. The cafe is the fame 
with the bufliel, ,and the greater part of other mea- 
fures. Thefe inconveniences, which rendqf calcu- 
lations complex, would not have occurred, had the 
duodecimal progreflion been univerfally adopted. 

Steviii, a Dutch mathematician, propofed to adapt 
the divifions and fubdiviijons of all meafures to 
the fyftem of numeration fince adopted by the 
French, making them to decreafe in decimal pro* 
grefBon. Thus, the fathom .would have contained 
10 feet, the foot 10 inches, the Inch 10 lines,&amp;c. 
This method,* however, though attended with fome 
advantages, is lefs perfe£l than the duodecimal, as 
it gives rife to a greater number of fra£lions. 

A great many fyftems of arithmetic have been 
propofed, fuch as the binary, ternary, quaternary,&amp;c ; and d^ven the duodenary ; but there is no greal^ 
reafon to believe that any of them will ever be ad- 
mitted into practice. 

But we fhall add nothing farther on the fubjeft ; 
for, as ufeful recreations are the obje£k of this coU 
leflion, we mult exclude from it every thing top 
complex, or of too frivolous a nature.

Of fomt Properties of Numbers. 

Undj^ this head, we do not comprehend thoTe 
properties of numbers which engs^ged fo much the 
attention of the ancients, and to which they afcribed 
fo many myfterjous virtues. Every one, whofe 
mind is not tinfiured with credulity, muft laugh to 
think of the good canon of Cezene, .father Bungo, 
coIIeClittg into a quarto volume, entitled De myjlcriis 
numerorum^ all the ridiculous eonceits. which 
Nichomachus, Ptolemy, Porphyrius, and fevenki 
more of the ancients, childifhly publiThed in regard 
td numbers. How could it enter the minds of 
teafonable beings to afcribephyfical energy to things 
purely metaphyiical ? For numbers are mere con- 
ceptions of the mind, and confequently can have no 
influence in nature. 

None, therefore, but old women, or perfons of 
weak minds, can believe in the virtues of numbers. 
Some entertain a notion, that if 13 perfons (it at the 
fame table, one of them will die in the courfe of 
the year ; but there is more probability that one 
will die in the fame time, if the numbor be 24. 

The feries 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 is of fuch a nature,

have .twos, threes, or fours, in the produ3. 

For exatnple, if it be required that the produft 
fhall contain only twos, we mull multiply 9 pri* 
vately by 2, which will giv€ 18 for the multiplier 
of the feries. If we multiply the fame number by 
3,&apos; we (hallhave 27 ; if by 4, we fliall have 36,&amp;c. 

If the feries, therefore, lie multiplied. fucceffively 
by 18, 27, 36, the produQs will be compofed of 
twos, threes, fours,&amp;c, 33 may be eafily proved 
by trial. 

If the number 37 be multiplied by any of thfe

by 3, which makes 21, and 30 multiplied by 3 which 

makes 90 ; the fum total being one and eleven tens,

cxpreffed only by three units. 

It will not then appear aftonifhxng that 37 multi-

plied by 6, fliould give the double of thefe three 

units ; and fo of the reft. 

The number 5 has this peculiar property, that 

when multiplied by an odd number, the produQ: 

will always terminate with 5 ; and if multiplied by 

VI even number, will terminate with a cipher,

The number 9 has this property, that the fum.of 
the figures of every number, of which it is a muUi« 
pie, form% a multiple of 9. 

Thus, the produ£l of 17 multiplied by 9 is 1531 
and the sum of thefe figures i + 5 -4- 3 =: 9. In 
the like manner, the fum of the figures S^yj^ which 
is the produA of 753 multiplied by 9, is equal to 
^7, a multiple of 9. 

This will not appear aftonifliing when we refleO, 

 

&apos;that twice 9 is equal to 18, three times 9 = 27,&amp;c; 
where it is evident that the tens and units of the pro* 
iiuft are always reciprocal complements of 9. 

If we take any two numbers whatever, one of 
them, or their fum, or their difference, will always 
be divifible by thrcfe. This may be fo eafily proved, 
that it is needlefs to illuftrate it by examples. 

Every fquarc number muft neceffarily terminate 
with two ciphers, or by j, 4, 5; 6, 9; and this 
may enable us to determine, at one view, whether 
a numerical quantity be a fquare or not. (loj

S ; in the fecond it is 4 ; it is 2 alfo in the thirds 
whidi goes on decreafing, and 3 in the fourth. 

From this definition of arithmetical progref&amp;on^ 
ihe following confequences may be deduced. 

ift. Any term of an arithmetical progreffion, is 
equal to the firft» plus the common .difference taken 
as many times as there are terms before it. (92) 

2d. The fum of the extremes, is -always equal to 
the fum of any Itwo terms equally &apos;diftant from 
th^m ; or double the mean term, if the progref&amp;on 
contains an odd number of terms. (21) 

3rd. If the fum of the extremes be multiplied 
by half the number of terms, when the terms are 
even, or the mean by the whole number of terms 
when the latter are odd, the produfl: will be the fum 
of the progreffion.

pROB. Hi. A merchant being confiderdbly indebi^ 

one of his creditors ^ to whom he owed 1 86o/» 

offered to give him an acquittance^ on condition 

of his agreeing to pay the whole fum in tumlvc 

monthly inftallments ; that is to fay ^ lOo/. the 

firft month, and to increafe the payment by a 

certain sum eachfucceeding month to the twelfth 

inclufive, when the xohole debt would be dif 

charged. By what fum was the payment of each 

month increafed? 

In this problem, we hav€ given the firft term 

100, the number of the terms 12, and their fum 

i860 ; but thfe common difference of the terms \t 

unknown. 

This difference may be found in the following 
manner : As the fum of the extremes, in an even 
arithmetical progreffion, is equal to the fum total, 
divided by half the number of terms, if the fum 
total i860 be divided by 6, or half the number of 
terms,&apos; we fliall have 310 iot the fum of the firft 
and laft term, from* which if we fubtraft 100, the 
firft&apos;term, the rAnainder a 10 will be the laft term ; 
but the laft term is always equal to the*firft and the 
common difference ta^ken as many tinies as fhe^e are 
terms before it. If we, therefoire, deduft the firft 
term 100, from 210 the laft, and- divide 110, the 
remainder, by 11, we fhall have 10 as the required 
difference. Thtf firft term being 100, the fecoad 
therefore will be 110, 4be third 12O9&amp;c. (fii)

\0 AMUS£i^£NT4: 

Prob* IV. A gentleman employed a bricklayer to 
Jink a welly to the depth of 20 yards^ and 
agreed to give him ^tl, for the whole; but the 
bricklayer happening to die when he had com^ 
pleted only 8 yards ^ how much was due to his 
heirs? 

To imagine that two fiths of the whole fum were 
due to the workman^ hecaufe 8 yards are two fifths 
of the whole depth, would be erroneous ; for as the 
difficulty muft increafe arithmetically as the depth, 
it is natural to fuppofe thM the price ihould increafe 
in the fame ratio. 

To refolve this problem, therefore, 20I, or 400 

. {hillings, muft be divided into Jtwenty terms in 

. arithmetical progreffion; and the fum of the iirft 

eight of thefe will exjprefs what was due to the 

bricklayer for his labour. 

But 400 (hillings, may be divided into twenty 
terms in arithmetical progreffion a great many dif« 
ferent ways, according io the value of the firft 
term, which is here undetermined : if we fuppofe 
it, for example, to be 1 fliilling, the progreffion 
livill be 1, 3, 5, 7,&amp;c, the laft^term of whichrwill 
be 39 ; arid confequently the fum of the firft eight 
terms will be 64 fhillings. 

But to refolve the problem in a proper manner,

^2. Of Geometrical Progrefiontt^ HS^an Explafuu 
tion of their principal Properties. 

If there be a feries of numbers, each of. which 
is the produft of the preceeding by a comnion mul- 
tiplier (18), thefe numbers form what is called a 
geometrical progteflion. Thus, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,&amp;c, 
form a geometrical progreflion; foY.the fecond is 
the double of the firft, the third the double of the 
fecond, and fo on in fucceflion. The terms 1, 3, 
9» 27, 81,&amp;c, form alfo a geometrical progreffion, 
each being the triple of the preceding.

i|ft AMUSEMEN-^S 

Progreffions may be either increafing, as the t^O-d 
above mentioned, or dccreafing as the two following 
16, 8,4,48, i; 81, 27, 9,3, 1. 

The principal property of geometrical progreffion 
is, that if we take any three following terms what^ 
ever, as 3, 9, 27, the produft 8i of the extremes 
will be equal to the fquare of the mean 9. In like 
manner, if we take any foiir following terms, ai 
3, 9, 27, 8t, the produft 243, of th6 extremes, 
will be equal to that of the two means, 9 and 27. 

In the laft place, if any number of terms what« 
ever of the feries be affumed, as 2, 4, B, 16, 32, 
64, the produft of the extremes, 2 and 64, will be 
equal to the produft of any two terms equally diftant 
from them, as 4 and 32, or 8 and i6. If the num. 
ier of terms be odd, it is evident that there will be 
only one term equally diftant from the two extremes ; 
and in that cafe the fquare of that term will be equal 
to the prodirtHM^tke extremes, or of any two terms 
whatever equally diftant from them, or from the 
mean. (23, 24) 

Between geometrical and arithmetical progreffion, 
there is a certain analogy, which defer^es here to 
be mentioned, and which is, that the fame refults 
are obtained in the former, by employing multipli- 
cation and divifion, as are obtained in the latter by 
addition and fubtraftion. When, in the latter, wc 
take the half or the third, we employ in the fornier 
extraftion of the fquare, cube,&amp;c» root&amp;« 



J 



IN ARITHMETIC. j^ 

^us, to find an arithmetical mean between twa 
tinmbers, for examples and 12, we muil add- the 
two extremes together, iind take the half of 15 their 
[am, which is 7I ; but to find a geometrical mean 
between two numbers, we tnuft multiply them to- 
gether, and extraft the fquare root of their produfl : 
for example, if a geometrical mean between 3 and 
t2 be required, we muft ext raft the fquare root -of 
their produS 36, which will give 6 ; and, indeed, 
*rr 8 = 6 : 12. (23) 

A geometrical progreSion may decreafe in infinu 
ium, without ever coming to o ; for it is evident 
that any part of a quantity whatever, greater than o 
can never become o* A decreafing geometrical pro* 
grel&amp;on may be continued, therefore, in infinitum^ 
fince to find the following term, nothing will be 
lieceffary. but to divide the laft term by the exponent 
or common ratio. We fliall here give two examplcf 
of decreafing geometrical progrefiions* ^

The fum of an increafing geometrical progreflioii„ 
continued ad infinitum^ is evidently infinite; but 
that of a decreafing geometrical progreffion, whatr 
ever be th^ number of terms fuppofed, is always 
finite. Thus, the fum of the terms, continued in

Of karmonicdl ProgrtJJion^ 
Three mimbers are in hannonical proportion, 
when the firft is to the laft as the difference between 
the firft and the fecond is to the difference between i 

the fecond and third. Thus the.nunibers 6, 3, a 
are in harmonica! proportion ; for 6 is to&amp;&apos; as 3, the 
difference between the two firft nurtibers, is to 1, 
the difference of the two laft. Thi»kind of relation 
is called harmonica!, for a reafon which will be feen 
hereafter. 
When three numbers in decreafing harriionical 

 proportion are givert, it is cafy to find a fourth ; 

^ nothing is iieocffary bat to find af third harmonica! 
to the two laft, and this will be th&apos;e fourth tcrAi Re- 
quired. In KIce manner, the third and fourth majr 
be employed to find a fifth, and fo on in fuecefton : 
this will form what is called a harmonica! progref- 
Cojti, which by the above method may be always 
continued decreafmg.

and the apj&gt;lication of it to a few problems, which 
may ferve ^as a rule for the felution of all others of 
the famfe kind.

46 AMUSEMENTS 

Any peribn, however, of commott fertfc may 
readily perceive, that Achilles wiU foon come up^ 
witti the tortoife. In what then coofifts the fophifxn ? 
It may be explaii^ed as follows : 

Achilles, indeed, would never overtake the tor- 
toite, if the intervals of time, during which be is 
fuppofed to be ,walkng the firft furlongs and then the* 
tenth, hundredth;&apos;and thoufandtb parts of a furlong, 
which the tortoife has fucceflively advanced before* 
him, were equal; but if we fuppofe that he ham 
walked the firft furlong in 10 minutes, h^ will re-, 
quire only one minute to walk the tenth of a fur- 
Ipng, and ^V of a minute . to watk the hundredth^&amp;c. The intervals of time, therefore, whiclv 
Achilles will require to pafs over the fpace gained 
by the tartoife during the preceding tipie, will go 
on decreafing in the following manner: 10, 1» rVt 
rijf% iVvir*&amp;c; and this ferits- forms a fub&lt;-decu-

pROd II. If ih£ hour ana minute hands of a clack 
both begin to move exaQly at noon^ at what 
points of the dial-plate will they be fuccefjively ^ 
in conjunSion^ during a whole revolution of the, 
twelve hours ? 

This problem, qonfidered in a certain manner^ 
is in nothing different from the preceding. tThe/ 






ft 



minute hand acts here the part which Achillas did 
in the former; and the hour hand, which moves 
twelve times flower, that of the tortoife. In th^ 
laft place, if we fuppofe the hour hand to be begin- 
tiing a fecond revolution, and the minute hand to be 
beginning a firft, the diitance which the one has 
gained over the other will be a whole revolution of 
the dial -plate. When the mitiute hand has made 
one revolution, the hour hand will have made one 
twelfth of a revolution, and to on progreilively. 
To refolve the problem, therefore. We need only 
apply to thefe data the method employed in the 
former cafe, and we fliall find* that the interval from 
noon to the point where the handft come again into 
Conjun£lion will be tV of * whole revolution ; or, 
what amounts to the fame thing, one hour and -^y 
of an hour. They will afterwards be in conjunct

the fum of all the terms of a double progreffion,

employing 7 hours each day, is the . fame thing 
z^ to travel 30 times 7 hours, or 210 hours. The 
queftion therefore may be changed in the following 
manner: If 210 hours are required to travel 230 
Lsagues, Jiow many hours will be requifite to travel 
600 leagues ? When the number of hours which 
anfwer the queftion have been found, the required 
number of days may be found by dividing thefe 
hours by 10, as the traveller employs 10 hours 
each day. We rnvfi therefore find the fourth term 
of the proportion the firft three of whi^h are as 
follows :

The Rule of Tare. 

By ^e &apos;is coiiiindnjy meant the we^t of the 
.caft) box Off ba^,. ip which goods are coniaio^* 
«iid which beitig fubtra£led^ wbea» known,^ from the 
grofs weight, leaves the real weight of tjbe good), 
called the net weight. In g^nefal^ (^n aliowance is 
•made for it, ^t the rate of fo much per hundred 
weight;, and the quantity tp be -deducted is found 
by the Rule cA Three, as in the Coll^wjng example : 

A merchant pur chafes a hale of cotton^ weighing 
7 cwt. including the package^ and is allowed at 
the rate oJ\6 per cwU of tare : h$w much, ought 



64 AMtJSEMEI^TS ^ 

&apos; to be &quot;&quot;deiluSed, wt that account^ from the grofs 

weight of the baU of cottomf^ 

As the merchant purchafes the goods by the net 
iv&lt;eight,the feller muft give him 16 pounds over and 
abovif each tfw%. ; that is to fay, for each 1 ia pounds, 
lie mnft give him 128. We mufti^ therefore^ mASt 
the following proportion : * - &apos; &apos; -- 

ia8 : 119 :: 700 : x* (93) . 

The fourth term will exprefs the number of 

^ . ... .t&apos; •••. 

pbunds for which the merchant ought to pay« 

JH/iouni^ 

&apos;A merchant pur chafes goods to the ammount of looot^ 
&apos; to be paid at the end of a year/ but the vender 

offer J to abate 10 per cent, for ready money : how 

much muft the buyer pay dovm f 

It might heref be fuppofed, that the abatement 
ought to be as many times lol. as 10a is contpiihed&apos; 
in idoo ; that is to fey, that lool. ought to be&apos;di^- 
dufiied, fo *that the merchant would have to pay 
only 900I. 

But it is to be obferved, that the vender ought td 
allow the purchafer only lo per cent, on what he 
will really receive ; that is to fay, that every 1 i-O&apos; 
pounds which the merchant has to pay, ought to be 
reduced to lOQ. We have, therefore, the foUow*^ 

,&gt;1 * w » «... 

ing proportion : 

aio 1 100 :: 1000 i, fim 



IN ARITHMETIC. gj[ 

This is Hie only true method of eltimating dif- 
count ; for if the vender received. only 900I. ready 
money, this fum, at 10 per cent, would produce* 
at the end of a year, no more than 990!. confe- 
quently it would be much betted for him to give a 
year&apos;s credit and receive loool. 

Of Combinations and Permutations^ 

Before we enter on this fubj^ft, it will be neccffary 
to explain the method of conflrufling a kind of 
table, treated of b/ Pafcal and others, called the 
arithmetical triangle; which is of great ufe to fiiorten 
calculations of tnis kind. 

Firft form a band A B of ten equal fquares, and 
below it another C D of the like kind, but fliorter 
by one fquare on the left, fo that it (hall contain 
only nine fquares; and continue in this manneri 
always making each fucceflive band a fquare fhor!er« 
We (hail thus have a feries of fquares, difpofe4 lA 
vertical and horizontal bands, and termiuatiog ^ 
^ch extremity in a (ingle fquare, fo as to form 3 
triangle, on which account it has been called th/e 
arithmetical triangle. 

The numbers with which it is to be filled upif^ 
muit be difpofed in the following manner :

Application of the dQ^rine of combinations to games 
of chance and to probabilities » 

« 

Though nothing, on the firll view, feems more fo* 
reiga to the province of the mathematics, than games 
of chance, the powers of analyfis .have, as we may 
.fay, enchained this Proteus, and fubjefted it to cal- 
culation ^ it. has found means to meafure the dif- 
. ferent dt^rees of the probability of certain events, 
and this fias given rife to a new branch of mathoi. 
matics, the principles of which we fliall here qx* 
rplain. ^: 

When an event can take place in feveral different 
ways, the probabily oi&apos;it^ h^peping in a certain de« 
terminate manner; is greater when, in the whole of 
the ways in which it can happen, the greater num* 
ber of them determine it to happen in that manner. 
.In a lottery, for example, every one knows that the 
probability of obtaining a prize is greater, accord* 
ing as the number of the prizes is greater, and 
as ^e whole &quot;number of the tickets is lefs^ 
The probability of an event, therefore, is in the 



,.:--.-rB»Sm^Katt^ 



rfftA- 



y€ AMUSEMENTS 

compound ratio of the number of cafes in which it 
can happen taken direftly, and of the total number 
of thofe in which it can be varied, taken inverfely ; 
confequently it may be expreffed by a fra6lion, hav- 
ing for its numerator the number of the favourable 
chances, and for its denominator the whole of the 
chances. 

Thus, in a lottery containing loob tickets, 25 

of which only are prizes, the probability of 

- obtaining a prize will be reprefented by t^I^t^* or 

^V; if there were 50 prizes, the probability would 

be double ; for in that cafe it would be equal to y^ ; 

. but if the number of tickets, inftead of 1000, were 

2006, the probability would be only one half of the 

former, or xV ; 3ind if the whole number of the 

tickets were infinitely great, the prizes remaining 

the fame, it would be infinitely fmall, or o ; while, 

on the other hand, it would become certainty, and 

ht expreffed by unity, if the number of the pf izes 

were equal to that of the tickets. 

Another principle of this theory, the truth of 
which may be readily perceived, and which it is ne- 
ceffary here to explaih, is as follows : 

A perfon plays an equal game when the money 
ftaked&apos;^ or rilked, is in the dircft ralio of this pro- 
bability of winning ; for to play an equal game, is 
nothing elfe than to depofit a fum fo proportioned to 

I 

the probability of winning, that, after a great many 
thrpi^Sj;. the player may filUl himfelf nearly at par ; 



v.v 



IN CHANCES.* 77 

but for this purpofe, the Aakes muff be propor- 
tioned to the probability which each of the players 
has in his fayouT. Let us fuppofe, for example, 
that A bets againft B on a throw of the dice, and 
that there are two chances in favour of the former, 
and -one for the latter: the game will be equal, if, 
after a great number of throws they feparate nearly 
^vithout any lofs. But as there are two chances in 
favour of A, and only one for B, after 300 throws 
A will have won nearly 200, and B 100. A, 
therefore, ought to depofit 2 and B only 1 ; for by 
thefe means A, in winning 200 throws, will get 
SOD ; and B, in winning 100, will get 200 alfp. 
In fuch cafes therefore it is faid, that there is two 
^0 one in favour of A. 

Prob, I. In toffing up^ what probability is there 
of throwing a head fiveral times fucccffivdy ^ or a 
tail; or^ in playing with fever al pieces^ what pro ^ 
bability is there, that they will all come up heads at 
&apos; one throw ? 
As this game is well knowti^ it is needlefs here 

to give any explanation of it ; we Ihall therefore 

proceed to analyze the problem* 

ift. It is evident that, as there is no reafon why 

ahead (hould come up rather than a tail, or a tail 

fban dt head, the probability of one of them coming 

np is equal, ta |, or an equal bet may be taken on 

eitlier fide. 



78 AMUSEMENTS 

But, if any one fliould bet to bring heads fuc- 
ceffively in two throws, to know what in this cafe 
ought t6 be ftaked on each fide, we niuft obferve, 
that all the combinations poflible of head and tail, 
which can take^place, in t^vo fucceffive throws with 
the fame piece, are* head^ head; kead^ tail; iailj 
head^ tail, tail; one of which only gives head, &apos; 
head. Here then there is only 1 cafe in 4 favour- 
able to the perfon who bets to throw a head twice 
in fuc^effion ; the probability therefore of this event 
will be only ^ ; and he who bets that it will take 
place, ought to, depofit only a crown, while his 
antagonift depofit^ three : for the latter has three 
chances of winning, whereas the former has only 
one. To play an equal game, the money depofited 
by each ought to be in this proportion. 

It will be found, in like manner, that he who 
fhould bet to bring a head, fof example^ three times 
fucceffively, would have in his favour only one 
of the eight Cojnbinations of head and taily which 
might refult from three fucqeffive throws of the 
fame piece. The probability therefore of this event 
would be T ; while that of his adverfary would be 
i, and -tonfequcntly to play an equal gsqpe, he 
ought to bet only 1 to/. 

It is needlefs to go over all the other cafes ; for 
it may be readily feen that the probability of throw* 
ing a head four times fuccelfively would^ be, onljr 
xVf and fo on. We fcall f^y nothing faitber there* 



IN CHANCES, 79 

fore on the different combinations which might 
refult from head and tall ; as in all fuch cafes the 
following general rule may be employed. 

When the probability of two or more individual 
events *re known, the probabihty of, their taking 
place all together may be found,&gt;y muhiplying 
together the probabilities of thofe events confidered 

individually. 

Thus, the probability of throwing a head, con- 
Cdered individually, being expreffed at each throw 
by f , that of throwing it twice- fucceffively, will 
IqL X i z=ii; that&lt;jf throwing it three times 
fucceffively, will be i x ^ X I = i. a^d fo on. 

2d. The probability of throwing &apos;a\\ heads or all 
tails with two, three, or four pieces, n»y be de- 
termined in the fame manner. When two pieces 
are employed, there are 4 combinations of head and 
tail, only one of which-is both A&lt;:ads; when three 
pieces are toffed up, at the fame time, there are 8» 
one of which only is all heads; and fo on. The 
probability, therefore, in each of thefe, cafes, is 
firailar to thofe already examined. ^ . 

It may he feen, indeed, without the help of 
analyfis, that thefe two queftions are abfolutely the 
fame, as may be proved in the following manner. 
To tofs up the two pieces A and B at the fame 
time, or to throw up the one after the other, whea 
A tlic firft has had time to fettle, is certainly the 

E4 



» 

I 



8o AMUSEMENTS 

fame thing. Let us fuppofe then, that when A 
the firft has fettled, inftead of tofling up B, the 
fecond, A, is taken from the ground, in order to 
be tofTed up a fecond time : this will certainly be 
the fame thing as if the piece B had been employed ; 
for by the fuppofition they arc both equal and fimi- 
lar, at leaft in regard to\he chance of ?i head or 
a tail coming uppermoft ; confequently to tofs up 
the two pieces A, T&gt;, at once, or to tofs up twice 
fiicceffively tlie piece A, is the fame thing. 

3d. If it. were afkcd, how much a perfon might 
bet to bring a head at leaft once in two throws, it 
may be found by the above method that the chance 
is 3 to 1. In two throws there are ^ four combina- 
tions, three of which give at leaft one A^fl^, while 
there is only one which gives two tails ; and hence 
it follows that there are three combinations in favour 
of the perfon who bets to bring a head once in two 
throws, and only one again ft him. 

Pr6b. II* Any number of dice being given, tot deter^ 
mine the probability of throwing with them an af-^ 
Jignei number of points. 

We here fuppofe that the dice are of the ufiial 
kind, that is to fay, having fix faces marked with 
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This being pre- 
mifed, we ftiall analyze f6me of the firft cafes of the 
problem, that we may proceed gradually to thofe 
which are more complex. - ~. 



IK CHANCES. . 81 

\fl. It is propofed to throw a determinate pointy 
for example 6, with one die. 

As the die has fix faces, one of which only is 
marked fix, and as any one of thefe may come up 
as readily as another, it is evident that there are 5 
chances againft the perfon who undertakes to throw 
6: at one throw,, and only 1 in his favour. To 
phy an equal game he ought^ therefore, to bet no* 
more than tto g. 

2 J, Let it be propofed to throw the fame point 6^ 
with tzvo dice^ 

To analyze this cafe, &apos;it mull firff be obfervcd 
that two dice give 36 different combinations ; for 
each of the faces of the die A, for example, may 
combine with each of thofe of B, which will pro- 
duce 36 combinations. We muft neXt examine in&quot; 
how many ways the point 6 can be thrown with 
two dice. ift. It will be found that it can be 
thrown by 3 and 3 ; 2d. By throwing 2 with the 
die A, and 4 with the die B, or 4 with A and a 
with B, which, as. may be readily feen, forms two 
diftinfl: cafes ; 3d. By throwing 1 ^ith A and 5 
with B, or 1 with B and q with A, which Hke- 
wrfe forms two cafes : thefe are evidently all the 
ways that can be found. Confequently, there are 
5 cafes favourable in the 36 ; and, therefore, the 
probability of throwing 6, with two dice, ir -fyl 
and that of not throwing it |^ ; hence it appear*

tbat the money ftaked by the players ought to be in 
the ratio of thefe two fractions. 

By analyfing the other cafes it will be found* 
that of throwing 2 with two dice, there is 1 chance 
in 36 ; of throwing 3, there are 2 ; of throwing 4, 
there are 3 ; of throwing 5, there are 4 ; of throw-

that in 216 different throws po&apos;flible, wkh three

ing 4, 6 of throwing. 5, and fo on; as may be

When once it is known in how many ways any 
point can be thrown with a certain number of dice, 
it will be eafy to determine the probability of 
throwing it. Nothing will be neceflary but to 
form a fraftion, having for its numerator the num- 
ber of ways in which the point can be thrown, 
and for its denominator the number 6, raiCed to 
that power denoted by the number of dice ; for ex-* 
ample, the cube of 6, or 216, for 3 dice ; the bi« 
quadrate, or 1296, for 4; andfoon. 

Thus, the probability of throwing 13 with 3 dice 
is -5T-V ; t^*^^ ^f throwing it with 4 is ttVt- 

Various other queftions of the like kind mighC 
be propofed, fome of which we fliall here ana* 
lyze, 

Prob. III. TVhen twa perfons are pldying, to deter&apos;- 
mine the advantage or di/advantage on the fide of 
tfie one who undertakes to throw a certain Jace^ 
for example^ that marked 6, in a certain, number 
. of throws. 

Let- us fir ft fuppofe that the perfon undertakes 
it at one throw. To determine the probability of 
his fucceeding, we muft confider, that he who holds - 
the die has only qne chance of winning, and that 
there are five of his lofingr confequently to ua- 
dertake it at one throw, he aught to bet only 1 to 5. 
There is, therefore, great difadvantage in under- 
taking on an even bet to throw 6 at one throw. 



f r^&apos; n — i 



IN CHANCES. 85;. 

To. detennine the probability of throwing at leaft 
one face marked 6, in two throws, with the fame 
die ; we mull obfeiFve, as has been already faid in 
regard to tof&amp;ng up, that this is the fame thing as 
to undertake to bring one face marked 6, by throw-*^ 
ing two diife at the fame time. In this cafe, he 
who holds the dice has only 11 chances,, or com- 
binations, in his favour ; for he may bring 6 wkh 
the f firft die, and 1,2, 3, 4, or 5, with the fe-, 
cond; or 6 with the fecond die, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 
or 5, with the firft; or 6 with each die. But there 
are 25 chances, or combinations&apos;, again ft his win* 
ning, as may be feen in the following table :

Hence it may readily be concluded, that he 
who undertakes to throw a&amp;with two dice, ought • 
to bet only it to 25; -and confequently, that there 
is a difad vantage in undertaking it on an even 
bet. ( . 

We muft here obferve that 36^ or the whole of 
the chances poflible with one throw of two dice, 
i^ the fquare of the given number 6, the number 
of the faces of one die; and that 25, the nuniber 
^f the chances unfavourable to the perfon who un« 



$6^ AMUSEMENTS&apos; 

dertakes te throw a detenninate fsice, is the fquare 
of the number 6 diminilhed by unity, that is of 5 ; 
for this reafon, the number of the favourable chances 
in the prefent cafe, is the difference of the fquares 
of 36 and 25, or of the fquare of the number of 
the faces of tKe die, and of that of the lEaces of the 
fame die lefs i. 

To determine the probability of throwing a 6 in 
three throws of the fame die ; we mufi, in like mian- 
ner, confider, that this is the fame thing as to; un-^ 
dertake to bring at leaft one 6 by throwing three 
dice; but of the 216 different combinations pro- 
duced by 3 dice, there are 125 in which there is^ 
no 6, and 91 w^here there is at leaft one 6 : con- 
fequently, he who bets on throwing one 6, either m 
three throws with one die,, or in one throw witE 
three dice, ought to bet no more than 91 to 125 ; 
and it would be difadvantageous to. undertake it oa 
an equal bet. 

We muft again obferve, that 91 is the difference 
of the cube of the number of the faces of one die,: 
viz.&apos;&quot; 216, and of 125 the cube of the fame number 
diminifhed by unity, that is to fay of 5. Hence- 
it may be feen, that to determine, in general, the- 
probability of throwing any affigned face in a cer- 
tain number of throws, or in one throw with a^ 
certain number of dice, Ve mudraife 6, the num« 
ber of the faces of one die, to that power indicated 
by the number of throws given, or of the -dice to 



IH CHAVCEs:. By 

|}e thrown at once, and chat we muft then raife to 
the^ame power 6 lefs unity, that is to fay ^, and 
fubtrafi it fr&lt;Hn the former : the remainder, and 
this power of 5, will be the refpeftive number of 
chances for winaing or lofing. 

For example, if a perfon fliould bet to bring at 
leaft one 3 with four dice ; we muft raife 6 to the 
biquadrate or fourth power^ which is 1296, and 
fubtra£l from it 625, which is the fourth power of 
■5.: the remainder 67 1 will be the number of chances &apos; 
favourable for winninjg ; and 625 will be thofe of 
lofmg : confequemly^ there will he an advantage ia. 
laying an even bet* 

There will be ftill more advantage in undertakings 
,onan even bet, to throw a determinate point, for 
example 3, in five throws, or with five dice; for 
if we deduft the fifth power of 5, which is 3125,. 
from 77769 the fifth power of 6, the remainder 
4651 will be thennmber of the favourable chances^ 
aad 3125 that of the unfavourahfe. 

Confequently, to play an equal game, he who.

of any number ever fo little greater than unity gO&apos; 
on always increafing, thofe of a number ever fo 
little lefs go on always decreafing ; confequently . 
the confecutive powers of ^ will go^ on always 
decreaGng. Let us conceive -^^ raifed to fiich a 
power, that it fliall be equal to | ; now it will be 
found that the twenty^foUrth power of ^^ is a little 
greater than | ;^and that the twenty-fifth power o£ . 
the fame fraHion is a little lefs than | ;: a perfoa 
may then lay an even bet, with forae a^antage, 
that another will nothring fixes in 24 throws, but • 
au even bet cannot be laid with advantage that fixes&gt;wiJl not come up- in 25 throws. Confequently 
there is a difadvantage in laying an even bet to 
bring fixes in 24 throws ; and, on the other hand,, 
he who lays an even bet to throw fixes in 25 throws^ 
does fo with advantage. 

Prob. v. WkatprobabiRty is there of throwing a, 
determinate doublet ^ for txample two threes^ at 
cne throw J zvith two or more dice? 

To determine the probability in this cafe, we 
mud confider, that in undertaking to throw two 
threes with 2 dice, there is only 1 favourable chance* 
i# the 36 given by 2 tii«e. Whence it follows.

that the perfon who undertakes it, ought to bet only 
1 ^o 35 ; if 3 dice were propofed, we (hould find 
that the bet ought to be 16 to 216 ; for the number , 

of chances or combinations poflible with 3 dice is ^ 

2x6; but when it is required to tliraw two threes 
with 3 dice, it may be done 16 different ways ; Jor &apos; ! 

of the 36 combinations of the. dice A and B, all 
thofe in which there is only one 3, as 1, 3 ; 3, 1 ;&amp;c. which are 10 in number, by combining with 
the face marked 3 of the die C, will confequently 
give two threes. Befides, the . combination 3, 3 of ^ 
the dice A, B, by combining^ with one of the fix 
faces of the third C, will alfo give two threes ; 
and hence there are 16 different ways of throwing 
two threes with 3 dice, which gives i6 favourable 
chances in 216. Confequently, the probability of 
throwing two threes with 3 dice, is -5^ ; and there- 
fore the perfon who undertakes it, ought to bet no 
inore than 16 to 2x6, or nearly 2 to 27. 

If the probability of throwing two threes with 
4 dice be required, we fhaH find that it is ex- 
preffed by tVtVJ f^r, of the 1296 combinations, 
arifing from the faces of 4 dice, there are 150 
which give 2 threes, 20 which give 3 threes, and 
1 which gives 4, making altogether 171 throws, 
in which there are either 2, 3, or ^4 threes. Con- 
fequently, a p^fon ought to bet no more than 19 
to 144, or about t to 7 1, on throwing, at leaft ft 
threes with 4 dice* - • &apos;&apos; 



&apos;

In the laft place, if the probability of throwing 
any doublet with ten dice, or more, at one throw,- 
be required ; it will be eafy to determine it by the 
fame method of calculation. For in the cafe of an 
indeterminate doublet, it is evident that the proba- 
bility is fix times as great as when a particular 
doublet is afligned ; and therefore nothing wilk be 
iiecefliry but to multiply the above probabilities by 
6. The probability therefore with 2 dice, is 7V or 
i; with 3 dice, Vtt = i&apos;y with 4 dice&apos;iil = 
4 ; fo that there is an advantage in laying an even 
bet, to bring at lead one doublet with 4 dice. 

Prob. VI. Two pafons dcpojit a cerUin Jum

\ certain number of games, for example 3, fhaii . 

. have the whole; one of them has got two games, 

and the other one; but being unwilling to continue 

their play, they refolvc to divide thejiakt, in what 

manner muji this be done? 

 This, problem is one of the firft which engaged 
the attention of Pafcal, when he began .to ftudy the 
. calculation of probabilities. He. propofed it to^* 
M. de Fermat, a celebrated geometrician of that 
period, wfio refolved it by a different method, viz, 
that of combinations. We fliall here give both*

chance might give him ; confequently, when they 
give over playing, the ftake ought to be divided 
according to the probability each had of winning. 

Cq/e 1. . 

This proportion may be determined by the follow- 
ing mode of reafoning. Since the firft player wants &apos; 
olie game to be out, and the fecond two, it may be 
readily perceived that if they continued their play,&quot; and 
if the fecond won one game, he would want, in the 
fame manner as the firft, one game to be out ; and 
if both players were equally advanced, their hopes 
of gaining the whole would be equal : in this fuppo- 
fition, therefore, they would have an equal rigfit to 
the ftake, and confequently each&apos; ought to have an 
equal {hare of it. It is evident therefore, that if 
the firft wins the game about to be played, the whole 
ftake will belong tp him; and if he lofes it he wijl 
be entitled only to one half. As the one cafe is as 
probable as the other, the firft has a right to^he half 
of thefe fums taken together; but together they 
make -I, the half of which is ^. Such is the por- 
tion of tht ftake belonging to the firft player, and 
confequently that belonging to the&apos;fecond is only ^,

ihould lofe one, fo that the fecond (hould want only 
two games to be out, ^ of the money would belong 
to the former, fince they would then be in the fitu- 
ation alluded to in the firft cafe. But as both thefe 
events are equally probable, th^ firft ought to have 
the half of thefe two fums taken together, or the 
half of J, that is to fay i : the reniainder, -^^ will 
be what ought to belong to the fecondit

« 

It wijl be found, by reafoning in the fame man- 
ner ; if we fuppofe two games wanting to the firft 
player, and three to ihe fecond, that on. ceafing to- 
play they ought to divide theftake in fuch a manner^ 
that the firft may have y^, and the fecond ■^•. 

Ca/i 4. 

If they had agreed to play four games, and if the 
firft wanted only two games, while the fecond 
wanted four, the ftake ought to be divided in fuch 
a manner, that the firft might have H, and the 
fecond -j\. 

We fhall now explain the fecond method of re- 
folving queftions of this- kind, which is that of com- 
binations. ^ 

To rpfolve^ for example, the fourth cafe, in 
whicih we fappofe that the firft player, wants two 



lU CHANCES. 93 

games to be out, and the fecond four, Jo that both 
together want fix games ; if we fubtra£l unity from 
that fum, we (hall have 5, which indicates, that we 
muA take thefe five fimilar letters aaaaa. favoura- 
ble to the firft player, and the five followigg, bbbbb^ 
favourable to the feCond. Thefe muft be combined 
together as feen in the following table, where, of 32 
combinations, the firft 26, towards the left, where 
a occurs at leaft twice, indicate the number of 
chances favourable to the firft, and the 6 laft, to- 
tyairds the right, where a is found at moft only once, 
indicate the number of chances favourable to the 
fecond.

Thus the hope of the firft player will be to th«t 
of .the fecond, as 26 to 6, or as 13 to 3. 

To refolve the cafe in which we fuppofe that one 
of the players has won three games, and the other 
none ; as, he will be the winner who fooneft gets,

and of the fquare of the Tame number diminifhed 
by unity, that is to fay of j. 

If a third die be added, we {hall find, by the like^ 
analyfis, 4hat, of the fii6 combinations of three

the amount may be known. It will here be proper 
to name the perfon who lends him a number of 
guineas equal to the number thought of, and to beg

care, as he may readilly fall into an error, efpecially 
the firft time. 3d. Then fay to the perfon : ** I do

I fhould not have been able to put into my hand a 
number of pieces* equal to the remainder*&quot; The 
perfon tlien fuppofing that the refult of the oalcula^

of the number thought of, will imagine that it ifr 
neceffary to know the la ft number, in oMer to guefs 
the refult ; but &apos; this idea is falfe ; for, in the cafe 
which we have here fuppofed, whatever be the num- 
ber thought of, the remainder muft always be 5. 
The reafon of this is as follows : the fum, the hal£ 
of \s4iich is given to the poor, is nothing elfe than 
twice the number thought of pitis 10 ; and when the 
poor have received their part, there remains only ^ 
the number thought of plus 5 ; but the number

If one or more of the numbers thought of, be 
greater than 9, we muft diftinguifli two cafes : that 
in which the number of the numbers thought of is 
odd, and that in which it is even. 

In the firft cafe, alk th^ fum of the firft and the 
fecond; of the fecondand third; the third and the 
fourth ; and fo on, to the laft ; and theii the fum of 
the firft and the laft. Having written down all 
thefe fums in order, add together all thofe, the places 
of which are odd, as the firft, the third, the fifth,&amp;c. ; make another fum of all thofe, the places o( 
which are even, as the fecond, the fourth, the fixth,&amp;c. fubtraft this fum from the former, and the re« 
mainder will be the double of the firft number* 
•Let us fuppofe, fpr example, that the 5 following 
numbers are thought of, viz. 3, 7, 13, 17, 20, 
which when added, two and. two as above, give 
10, 20, 30, 37, 23 : -the fum of the firft, third and 
fifth is 63, and that of the fecond and fourth is 57 : 
if 57 be fubtrafted from 63, the remainder 6 will 
be the double of the firft number 3. Now if 3 be 
taken from 10, the firft of the fums, the remainder 
7 will be the fecond number ; and by proceeding in 
the fame manner, we may find all the reft. 

In the fecond cafe, that is to fay, if the number 
of the nqmbers thought of be even» yoo muft aik

add together thofe whidi ftand in the even places^ 
and form them into a new fum apart * add alfo thofe 
in the odd phtces^ the firft excepted, and fubtraCt

the double of the fecond nmnber ; and H* the {ecatid 
number, thus found, be fubtrafled from the fum of 
the firft and fecond, you will have the firft numl&gt;er; 
if it be taken from that of the fecond and third,, it 
will give the third ; and fo of the reft. Let the 
numbers thought of be, for example, 3^ 7, 13, 17 : 
4he fums formed as above, are i&amp;, 20, 30, 24; the 
fum of the fecond and fourth is 44, from which if 
30, the third, be fubtra6led the remainder will he 
14, the doable of 7 the fecond namberx The firft 
therefore is 3, the third 13, and the fourth 17*.

Proe. y. The game of the ring^ 

This game is nothing elfe, than an application of 
one of the methods employed to tell feveral numbers 
thought of, and ought to be performed in a company 
not exceeding 9, in order that it may be lefs com- 

xplex. &apos; Defire any one of the company to take a ring^ 
apd to put it on any joint of whatever finger he may 
think proper^ The queftion then is, to tell what 
perfon has the ring, and on what hand, what fic^- 

^^r, and what joint. 

For this purpofe, you muft call the firft perfon 1, 

.the fecpnd 2, the third 3, and fo on. You mu^ 
alfo denote the 10 fingers of the two hands» by tbe 

.following numbers of the natural progreffion 1, 2^ 
3&gt;4» 5»&amp;c. beginning at the thumb of the- right, 
and ending at that of the left, that by this order the 
numbei: of the finger may at the fame time indicatie 

&apos; the hand. In the laft place, the joints muil bq denoted 
by 1, 2, 3, beginning at the points of the fingers. . 
To render the folution of this problem more ex- 
plicit, let us fuppofe that the fourth&apos; perfon in the 
company has the ring^ pa the fixth finger, that is ta

fing the perfon which, in this cafe will gi&lt;re 8- bid 
him add 5 to (his double, and multipl5^ the fum by 
5, which will make 65 ; then tell him to add to -this 
■produft the numbet denoting the finger, that is ti&gt;fay 6, by^which mearts you will have 71 ; and, in 
the lafl place, de{ire him to multiply the lad num- 
ber by 10, and to add to the produft the number of 
the joint 2* The laft refult will be 712: if from, 
this nicmber you dedufl: 250, the remainder will be 
462 ; the firft figure of which, on the left, will d«i- 
note the perfon ; the next the finger, and confe* 
quently the hand, and the laft the joint. 

It muft here be obferved, that when the laft re- -

in the prefent example had the number of the finger 
been io» yOu muft privately fubtraS, from the

tailing them firfi, fecond, and third. Then take 24 
Counters, and give one of them to the firft peiibn, 
CWoto the fecond, and three to the third* Place 
the remaining 18 on the table, and th^i retire, that

the tMiigs propofed, without your obferving them. 
When the diftribution has been made, defire the

tng counters, as many as he has already ; the one 
who has the fliilling to take twice as many as he has

the counters left can be only 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7*

his own mind, which will form a certain num-

2d. Then defire him to proceed backwards, and 
to count the above number, beginning with the 
hour which he thought of. 

Let the hour thought of, for example, be 8, and 
that touched be 3 : as 12 added to 3 makes 15, de- 
fire the perfon to count that number, in a retrograde 
order from the hour touched, beginning with 8 the 
hour thought of; counting 8 on the hour 3, 9 on 2, 
10 on 1, and fo on, by which means 15 will fall 
upon the hour of 8. 

The perfon will be furprifed to find that he has

Prob. XX. Two ptrfons agree to take alternately 
numbers less than a given number^ for example 11, 
and to add them together till, one of them has 
reachtd a certain Jum^ fuch as 100/ by what 
means can one 0} them infallibly attain to thai 
number before the other ? 

The whole artifice of this problem Confifts in im- 
mediately making choice of the numbers i, 12, 23, 
34^ and fo oil, or of a feries which continually in- 
4:reafes by 11, up to 100. 

Let us fuppofe that the firft perfon, who knows 
the game, makes choice of 1 ; it is evident that his 



IN CHANCES. 125 

adverfary, as he muft count lefs than 1 1 , can at moft 
reach 11 by. adding lot^^it. The fir ft will then 
take 1, which will make 12 ; and, whatever number 
the fecond may add, the firft will certainly win, 
provided he continually adds the number which 
forms the complement of that of his adverfary to 1 1 : 
that is to fay, if the latter takes 8, he muft take 3 ; 
if 9, he muA take 2, and fo on. By following this 
method, he will infallibly attain to 89 ; and it will 
then be impoffibfe for the fecond to prevent him 
from getting firft to 100 ; for whatever num- 
ber the {^oni takes, he can attain only to 99 ; aftef 
which the firft may fay : *&apos; and 1 makes 100.*&apos; If- 
the fecond takes 1, after 89, it would make 90 ; and 
bis adverfary would finilh by faying : &quot; and 10 make

^ I. Of the proportion between the males and tht 

females. 

Many people imagine that the number of the fe* 
males born exceeds that of the males ; but it has 
long fmce been proved that the contrary is the cafe. 
More boys than girls are born every year ; and 
fince the year 1631, a fmall interval excepted, we 
have a regifter of births in regard to fejc, and it has 
never been obferved that the number of the females 
born ever even equalled that of the males. It is 
found, by taking&apos; a mean or average term in a great 
number of years, that the Bumber of the males born 
is to that of the females, as 18 to 17. This pro- 
pbrtion is nearly that which prevails throughout alt 
France; but, to whatever reafon owing, it feems 
at Paris to be as 27 to ss6. 

This kind of phenomenon ij obferved not only 
in Englafkd and France; but in every other coun-» 
try. We may be convinced of the truth of it by 
infpefling the calendars,, which, at the commence, 
nhenit of every year, give a table of the births thai 
have taken place in moft of the capital cities of Eu-. 
rope ; it will there be feeu, that the number of the 
males bbrn always exceeds that of the females ; anft* 
confequently it may be conUdered as a general law 
of Miatafe. 

i Wedfay here obferve a ftriking inftance of the 
i^riidom of Provideacei, which has thus providel

for the prefervation of the human race. Men, in 
confequence of the aftive life for which they are 
naturally deftined by their ftrength and their cou- 
rage, are expofed to more dangers than the female 
fex; war, long fea voyages, occupations laborious 
or prejudicial to health, and diffipation, carry ofiF 
gjreat numbers of the males ; and it thence rcfults, 
that if the number born of the latter did not exceed 
that of the females, the males would rapidly de* 
creafCj , and foon become extinft. 

$ II. Of the mortality of ike human race^ accord-^. 

ing to the different ages* 

In tins refpeft there is apparently a confiderablc 
difference between large towns and the Country; 
but this arifes from the women iri toWns rarely 
Xuckling their own children ; and confequently the 
greater part of their child|sen &quot;being put out to nurfe 
in the country, a&amp;it is in the period of childhood 
that the greateft mortality prevails, it is moft appa- 
rent in the country. To make an exaft calcula^ 
tion, it ought to be founded on the deaths which 
happen in the towns, as well as in the country ; and 
this M. Dupre de St. Maur endeavoured to do, by 
comparing the regifters of three parithes in Paris, 
and twelve in the country. 

According to the obfervations of this author, in 
23994 deaths, 6454 of them were thofe of children 
not a year old. After carrying his refearches oxk

Such then is the condition of the human fpecies, 
that, of 24000 children born, fcarcely one half oi 
them attain to the age of 9 ; and that two thirds are 
in their grave before the age of 40. About a fixth 
only remain at the expiration of 62 years ; a tenth 
after 70 years ; a hundredth part after 86 ;. about 
a thoufandth part attain to the age of 96 ; and fix uwr 
feven individuals to that of 190. 

By means of this table we may afcertain, pretty 
nearly, what probability there is of a new-born chiM 
attaining to a certain age ; for this probability mufl: 
be to the contrary probability, as the number of thofe 
who attain to that age is to the number of thofe who 
die before it. 

For example, as 4564 ftands oppofite to .60, it 
indicates that as, of 24000 children bom, there re*

main no more than the above number of indivicluals 
at the end of 60 years, 19436 tnuft have died ; the 
probability therefore of a child attaining to the age 
of 60, is to the probability of its not attaining to it, 
as 4564 is to 19436. In this cafe, the proportion 
of thofe living to thofe dead, is nearly as 1 to 4 ; 
from which we may conclude, that the chance Is 4 
to 1 that a new-born child will not attain to the age 
of 60. 

If the probability of a perfon, of any determinate 
age, living to another age, be required, for exam« 
pie, that of a child of eight years &quot;of age attaining 
to the age of 60 ; we muft compare the number of 
thofe who attain to the age of 60, with that of thofe 
who attain to the age of 8 ; and the difference 7691 
Vrill give the number of thofjB who die between 
thefe two periods. We ftall then have this ana- 
tegy : as 4564 is to 7691, fo is the probability, that 
ft child of 8 years will attain to the age of 60, to 
llie probability of its not attaining to it. If 7691 
be divided by 4564, it will be found that the forv 
Uier* Contain* the latter nearly twice ; said we may 
therefore fay, that the chance is almoft 2 to j , that 
« cUM of 8 years of age will not liveio4faat of 6b«

among that number. . 

§ IV. Of the proportion of the iirihs and deaths to 
the whole number of the inhabitants of a country-^ 
The conftquences thence deduced. 

As it would be difficult to number the inhabitants 
of a country, and much more fo to repeat the enu- 
meration as often as it might be necelTary to afcer- 
tain the population, means have been devifed for- 
accomplifliing the fame objeft, by determining the 
proportion which the- births and deaths bear to the 
whole number&quot; of the inhabitants ; for, as regifters 
of births and deaths are regularly kept in all the 
civilized countries of Europe, we may judge, by 
compa/ing them, whether the population has in- 
creafed or decreafed : and, in the, latter cafe, can 
examine the ci^ufes which have produced the dimi- 
nution. 

&quot;X. 

The proportion of the births to the whole popu- 
lation in three generalities of France, which differ 
from each other as much by the nature as the form 
oJF the foil, give the mean ratio of i to 25^ , with- 
ciut including the large towns ; fo that in this 
country we may reckon 51 inhabitants for two 
births. - 

But as, in towns of any magnitude, there are 
feveral claiTes of citizens who fpend their lives in 
celibacy, and who contribute either nothing or very 



IK^OLITICAX ARITHMETIC. I45 

little to the population, it is evident that the pro« 
portion between the births and the effe£live inha- 
bitants, muft be more confiderable. It has been 
^fcertained by various cdmparifons that the propor-&apos; 
lion, nearellthe truth, is that pf 1 to 28; and it is 
this ratio whicH ought to be employed, in order to 
deduce from the births, in a large city, the number&lt;&gt;f the inhabitants. ^ 

But there is reafon to believe that, in regard to 
cities of the firft clafs, or capitals, fuch as London, 
Paris» Amfterdam,&amp;c. which are frequented hy 
multitudes of ftranjers, inyited thither either by 
pleafure or bufinefs, and where great luxur}&apos; pre- 
vails, which increafes the number of thofe who 
live in voluntary celibacy, the above proportion 
muft be raifed, and carried at leaft to that of t to 
30 or 3 1. &apos; 

» 

^ ^» Offomt othtr proportions t in regard to tKt 

inhabitants of a country. 

We may deduce, by approximation, from the 
obfcrvations of various authors in England, France, 
Holland, and Germany : 

ift. That the number of the inhabitants of ft 
country, is to that of the families, as 1000 to 2£2f ; 
fo that 2000 inhabitants give, in general, 44^ i^« 
milies. 

H

2d. That the number of the male children, ex- 
ceeds that of the female ; and that this excefs coij- 
tinues for more than 14 years, according, to the 
proportion of nearly 30 to 29. After 14 years 
however, the number of the females exceeds that 

* * • 

of the males, in the proportion of about 19 to 1^ 
on account of the coniiderable decreafe of the males 
by war, navigation, laborious occupations, and in- 
temperance.* 

3d. That the number of the marriages, is annu- 
ally to that of the inhabitants,, as 1 to 11 2, 

4th. That the proportion of married men or wi- 
dowers, to the number of wives or widows, is 
nearly as 1425 to 140; and the whole number of 
tbisclafs, is to the whole of the inhabitants, as g^- 
to 126. , ^ 

* 5th. That the number of widowers is tp that^ of 
widows, nearly as 1 to 3. This at leaft is the pro- 
portion deduced, from the enumeration of ^he peo- 
ple made in Holland and iii England. And h 
ought not to Appear aftonifhing, if jc be confidered 
that moft men marry at a later period of life than 
the women, and that their laborious* occupations, 
the maritime and land wars in whicjh they are en- 
^gaged, and .the diverfity of the climates which they 
frequent for the fake of commerce, muft increale 
the number of the widows in the bills of mortality, 

6th. That, admitting tha abov^ proportion of 
widowers isA^^x^oyft^ it follows that, apiong 6ji 



IN POLITICAL ARITHMETIC* ^^jff 

inhabitants there are 118 married coaples ; from 7 
io 3 widowers; from sn to 22 widows; and the 
reft are compofed of qhildren, perfons in a itate of 
celibacy, domefticsj and paflei^ers : 

7th. That 187P married couplies produce annual* ^ 
ly 357 children ; for a town having 10000 inhabitants 
^oul4 contain that number of married couples, and 
give annually 3^7 births; fit)m which it is concluded^ 
that 5 married couples, of all ages, give annually, one 
with another, one birth* 

^8th. That the number of fervants is to the whol^ 
number of inhabitants, nearly as^ 13610 1535 ; w1II|h 
is a little more than the eleventh part. The.iunm- 
ber of male domeftics is nearly equal to that of the 
female ; being in the proportion of 6j to 69 ; but 
it . is probable that, in large cities, where great 
luxury prevails, the proportion mull be difterent. 

The above obfervations will enable us to folve the 
following problem, and may ferve to facilitate the 
folution of others relating to the fanje fubjefl. 

Prob, I. The age of a man being given^ fuppoji

9544 ; then find in the fame t^hle the uumber op- 
pofite to 45 ; which is 7008, and make the latter 
number the numerator of a fra^ion, having for its 
denominator the former number. This fraftion 

► -Jfrr ^H cxprefs the probability of a pcrfori of 39 

. attaining to the age of 45. 

The demonftration of this rule will be evident to 
tliofe who underftand the theory of probabilities. 

pROB« II. A young man, aged 20, borrows loooA 

* fo be paid with the intereft when he attains to the 

^g^ ^f^5 : but in cafe he dies before that period^ 

the debt to be cancelled: what/urn ought the lender 

to receive at the propofed term of payment ? 

It is here evident, that if it were certain that the 
young man would live to complete his iwenty-fifth 
year, the fum to be paid would be the capital increaf- 
ed with 5 years intereft, which we Oiall fuppofe to be 
at the rate of 5 per cent, or 1850/. But on account of 
the rifle which the lender runs, by the chance of the 
borrower dying before the time of payment, the fum 
ought to be increafed in the inverfe ratio of the pro- 
bability of his being alive. But this probability is 
exprefled by the fra£lion fH^T ; a^ therefore the 
above fum muft be multiplied by this frafiion in&lt;i&gt;verted, or by t^tti which will give nearly 13&amp;9/. 
that is fay, about 79 more for the ri&amp;of lofing 
the money, which certainly caimot be accounted 
ufurious. 



IN P6LITICAL AHITHMETIC* «49 

Prob. III. AJlatt^ or an individual^ having oc^^ 
cqfion to borrow a fum of money on an annuity i 
what inierefl ought to be given for the different 
dges^ the legal interefi being 5 per cent? 

The vulgar, who are accuftomed to burthenfome 
loans, entertain no doubt that an annuity, at the rate 
10 per cent, for the age of 50, is a good bargain; 
and that this method of borrowing is advantageous to 
the Jlate ; but they are egregioufly miftaken, for it 
appears by the tables of Pariceux, calculated from 
the foregoing data, that 10 per cent, ought not to be 
given before the age of 56 ; according to the fame 
tabIe«iio more than 6\ per cent, ought to be given 
for the age of 20 ; 6| for the age of 25 ; 6|- for that 
of 30; 7^iox ^oi %\ for 50; laat 56; iixirat 
60 ; i6|- at 70 ; 27^ at 80; and 39rff at 85. 

It is therefore a great miilake to imagine that, on 
account of the great number of perfons who fink 
money in thefe loans, on annuities, made by govern- 
ments, the latter are foon freed from paying a part of 
the annuities by the death of a part of the ao- 
nuitants. The flow increafe of annuities in ton- 
tines is a fufficient proof of the falfity of this idea ; 
befides, the greatnefs of the number of the perfons 
is precifely the caufe, why the extlnSion of the an- 
nuities takes place more in conformity to the laws of 
probd&gt;ility already explained. A lucky chance, at

i^6 AMUSEMENTS &apos; 

the end of a few years, may free a perfoi^ from the 

• « 

payment of an annuity, eftabliflied on the fife of a 
man 30 years of age ; but if this annuity were ihared 
out on 300 diiFerent lives, the ages being nearly the 
fame, it is^ certain that he would not be liberated 
from it before nearly 65 years ; and after ^2 or 33, 
nearly one half of the annuitants would be living. 
This Pariceux has clearly fecwn by examining the 
lifts of the tontines. ^

MAGIC SQUARES. 



A Magic fquare is a feries of figures arranged in 
the cells of a fquare, in fuch a manner, that 
the figures in each band, whether vertical » hori- 
zontal or diagonal, form exaftly the fame fum. They 
are divided into two kinds : odd and even. 

Thefe fquares have been called magic, becaufe the 
ancients afcribed to them great virtues, and becaufe 
this arrangement of numbers formed the bafis and 
principle of feveral of their talifmans. 

One fquare, containing unity, was according to 
them the fymbol of the Deity, on account of his 
unity and immutability ; for they obferved that this 
fquare, by its nature, was fingle and immutable; 
the produft of unity by itfelf being always unity. 

A fquare containing four divifions or cells, was 
the fymbol of imperfeft matter, on account of the^ 
impoffibility of arranging figures in it fo as to form, a 
xnagic fquare^ i&gt;H 4 



^Jf* AMtr5£M£NTS 

The^fquare with 9 divifions, was copfecrated to 
Saturn ; that with 16 to Jupiter ; that with 25 to 
Mars ; that with 36 to the Sun ; that with 49 to 
Venus; that with 64 to Mercury j and that with 
81, to the Moon. &apos; 

-Thpfe who can find any relation between the ar- 
rangement of numbers and the planets, muft be in- 
deed not a little vifionary ; but fuch was the fpirit 
. of the myfterious philofophy of lamblichus and 
Porphyry, and of all their difciples, who were flaves

Prob» ii» AfatJur^ on Ais death-hed^ gave orders 
in his xvillf that if his zvife^ wlio was iken pregnanty

0nly -y, and the mother |. As the vndow however 
was delivered of itoins^ a boy and a girl^ what 

Jhare ought each to have of the property left by the 

father f 

The only diffi#ulty in ^this problem is. to deter- 
inine what would bave^bcen the; will of the teftator,, 
liad he forefeto that his wife; would be delivered of 
twins. It has generally beeti , explained in the fol- 
lowing manner : As th^ teilator defired that in cafe 
his wife brought forth a Ibrt, he fliouid have two 
thirds of his pro&apos;pehy, and the&apos; mother one third, it 
hence follows that his intention was to give his fqn* 
&apos;d&apos;tum double to that ^f the mother; and as be de»

iire3, ill the otker eafe, that if the brought forth a 
daughter » the mother flibuld have two thirds of 
his property, and the daughter one third, there it 
reafon to conclude that he intended the (bare of the 
mother to be double that of the daughter. Confer 
-qUcntly, to unite thefe two conditions, the heritagb 
xnuft be divided in fuch a manner, - that the fon may 
have twice as much as the mother» and the mother 
&quot;twice as much as the daughter* 
V If a, therefore, be fuppbfcd to reprefcnt tho 
father&apos;s property, and x the ihare of the daughter^ 
thejnftx will expreft that of the mother, and ^xthat 
of the fon. But, as atl thefe (hares together are 
equal to the father&apos;s property, we Ihall have the* 
following equation : 

;c + 2;r + 4* = ^

And by divifion .;v = -. (16)

PAUNGENESY. 



t 



PALINGENESY is a chemical operation, by 
means of which a pknt or an animal, as fooie 
pretends can be revived from^its aihes. This, if 
true^ would no doubt be one of the noblell fecrets 
of chemiftry and philofophy. If fomc authors are 
to be believed, feveral learned men of the 17th cen* 
tury were in poffeffion of it ; but at prefent as this 
pretended (ecret, in confequence of the great pro- 
grefs&apos;made in chemiftry, is confidered as a mere chi- 
mera, we fttall here confine purfelves to examining 
the foundation of thofe principles, which have in« 
ducecT foine refpefiable authors, fuch as the Abb6 
Vallemont, and others, to believe in the poHibility 
of this procefs* 

According ta the good Abbe, nothing is fimpler 
and eafier to be explained. We are indeed told^ 
feys he, by Father Kircher, jthat the feminal virtue 
of each mixture, is contained in its falts ; and thefe 
falts, unalterable by their nature, when put in mo&gt;Uoa by heat,, rife in the veSel through the liq;uor

* .in which they are dfffufed. Being then at liberty 
to arrange themfelves at plcafure, they refume their 
primitive difpofition, and place themfelves in th« 
order in which they would be placed by the effeft of 
vegetation, or the fame as they occupied before the 
body to which they belonged had been decompofed 
by the fire : in a word, they form a plant, or the 
phantom of a plant, which has a peifeft refemblancc 
to the one deftroyed. 

Tliis reafoning is worthy of an author who -could 
believe, that he who robs another of his money, 
can exhale corpufcules different from thofe exhaled 
by a man who carries his own, and thereby make 
the divining, rod turn towards the places where he 
has pajOTed, or remained fome time. Does it not 
flicw great weaknefs to believe, that the mere im- 
morality of an a£lion can produce phyfical effe£ls ? 
It would indeed be offering an infult to our rea- 
ders, to attempt to fhew the folly and abfurdity of 
the above reafoning oT the good Abbe, and of Fa- 
ther Kircher. Let us therefore only examine the 
fafts which he relates. 

An Englifli chemift, named Coxe, afferts^ that 
having extrafted and diffolved the elTcntial falts of 
fern, and then filtered the Hquor, he obferved, after 
leaving it at reft for five or fix weeks, a vegcta- 
tion of fmall ferns, adhering to the bottom of the 
veffcl. 

The fame chemift having mixed northern pot-aih 



IN PALINGENESY. 175 

With an equal quantity of fal ammoniac, faw, fome 
time after, a fmall foreft of pines and other trees, 
with which he was not acquainted, riling from the 
bottom of the veffel. 1 

The following faft the author thinks conclufive. 
The celebrated Boyle, though not very favourable 
to palingenefy, relates, that having diffolved in 
water fome verdegris ; which, as is well known, is 
produced by combining copper with the acid of vi- 
negar, and having caufed- this water to congeal &quot;By 
means of artificial cold, he obferved at the furface 
of the ice fmall figures, which had an exa£l refem« 
blance to vines. 

Notwithftanding thefe fafts, and feveral others 
mentioned by the Abbe Vallemont, if the partifans 
of palingenefy can produce none more conclufive, 
it muft be confefled that they fupport their preten- 
fions by very weak proofs. Every true chemift fees 
in thefe phenomena, nothing but a fimple ramified 
cry fiallization,. which may be produced by means 
of different well-known compofitions : the moft 
beautiful of thefe cryitallizations, called improperly 
vegetations^ are produced by the combination of bo* 
dies from the*animal kingdom. 

The laft experiment related by Boyle might oc. 
caficn more embarraflTment ; but as it is the only 
one, of a great many, made with the effential falts 
of a variety of plants,, that fucceeded, there can be 

14

- 176&lt;AMUSEMENTS , 

HO doubt that the figures he&amp;w were the mere tSkA 
of chance;, for how many other philofophers, wbo^ 
made the fame attempt, faw nothing but what is 
ufually exhibited by the furface of frozen water, 
which fometimes forms ramificaiions exceedingly 
complex ? 

The partifans of palingenefy quote, however, 
other authorities, to which they attach great impor« 
tance* We are told by Sir Kenelm Digby, on the. 
report of Querceran, phyfician to Henry IV. of 
^ France, that a Pole fliewed twelve glafs veffels, her- 
metically fealed, each containing the falts of difie* 
rent plants ; that at firft thefe falts bad the appear- 
ance of aflies, but that when expofed to a gentle and 
moderate heat, the figure of the plant, fuch as a rofe 
for example, if the veffel contained the alhes of a 
rofe, was obferved gradually to rife up, and that 
as the veffel cooled the whol^ difappeared. Sir 
Kenelm adds, that Father Kircher had affured him,, 
he bad performed the fame experiment, and that he 
communicated to him the fecret ; but it had never 
fucceeded. The dory of this Pole Is related by va-^ 
rious other authors, fuch as Guide la Broife, in bis 
book on the Nature of Plants. 

In the laft place, we are told by Kircher himfelf« 
in his Jrs Magnetica, that he had a long«necked 
phial hermetically fealed, containing the alhes of a 
plant, which he could revive when he thought pro- 
per, by jneans of heat» and tbat he Ihewed this

The procefsy indeedr at taught by Rircher, is fo 
complex and tedious, that it would require no fmalf

the emperor Ferdinand purchafed it from a chemifty

brezenfty of; Negropont was a mere impoftor, wa- 
need only read the Tec/mica Curio/a^ or the Jocjo^

the impudence* to pretend that he could.&apos; puU oul^ 
the eye of any animal, and in the Courfe of a. fe\«

The authority* of F^^her Schott will certainly be

^vtTj little weight with thofe who have read Vat 
works. 

In regard to Kircher, however celebrated he may 
have been in the arts and fclences, we Ihall&apos; not he- 
fitate to reje6l his teilimony ; for he was a man of a 
vivid imagination, paffionately fond of every thing 
(ingular and extraordinary, and who had a ftrong: 
propenfity to believe in the marvellous. What can 
be expefted frx)m a man of fuch a charafter ! He 
often thinks he fees what he does not fee; and he 
does not deceive others, becaufe he is iirfi deceived&apos; 
himfelf.. 

Some go ftill farther, and aflert that an animal 
.may be revived from its afhes. Father Schott, in: 
his Phyjica Curiofa^ even gives the figure of a fpar- 
row thus revived in a bottle. CafiFarel, in his Un^ 
heard of Curiofities^ believes in this fa3, and con^ 
fiders it as a proof of the poffibility of the general 
i«furre£lion. of bodies. This pretended rewval 
howeyer is a. chimera, flill more ridiculous than 
the former; and which at prefent it would be 
ridiculous to attempt ferioufly to refute. 

In a word, what reafonable man can with Kircher 
believe, that if the afhes of a plant be fcattered on 
the ground, plants of the like kind will fprihg up 
from them, as he fays he frequently experienced ? 
Who can admit as truth, that if crabs be burnt and: 
then diftilled, according to a procefs given by Dig-

of the fize of a grain of miHet, which muft be nou- 
riflied with ox&apos;s blood, and then left to thetnfelves 
in fome Aream ? Yet we are toldi by the Englifli 
knight, that this he himfelf experienced. It is 
therefore impoflible to clear hirh from the charge of 
impo&amp;ure, unlefs we fuppofe that, by fome means 
or other he was led into an error. However this 
may be, it is certain that Digby, with great zeaf, 
and a confiderable (hare of knowledge, had a jtrong 
propenHty to^all the vifions of the occult and ca-

mainder be filled \rith a compofition made of one 
part of white wax, twelve parts of hog&apos;s lard, and 
one or two of clarified linfeed oil. This oily dom^ 
pound, when cold, will entirely conceal the hifide 
of the jar ; but when brought xfear the fire, if done 
with dexterity, it will diffolve, and by (haking the 
lid, under a pretence of haftening the operation^ 
the cpmpound may be made to fall down into the 
bottom of the exterior jar» The rofe in the intc^ 
rior one will then be feen, and the credulous fpec- 
tators, who muft tkot be fuffered to approach too- 
near, will be furprifed and aftoniflied. When youi 
wifli to mate the rofe difappear, remove the jar 
from the fire, and by a new flight of hand make the 
diflblved femi-tranfparent wax flow back into the* 
interval between the jars. By accompanying thijr 
manoeuvre with proper words, the gaping, fpefkators^ 
win be more eaCly deceived ; and will retire firmly 
|)crfuaded, that they have feen one of the moft ciw 
rious phenomena that&apos;can be exhibiied by the uni- 
ted efforts of chemiftry and philofophyr 

t^alingcnefy ; or the art of retnving tie dead^ awf 
making the image of a dcx:taftd pcrfon appear in

A juggler at- Venice took a glafs jar, and haviogt 
poured water into it, told the coxppany, of whom

i formed&apos; one, that he would make thft imaige oi 
9ny deceafed perfon. we might name appear in.it. 
One of the company deiired &apos; that he might fee his 
grandfather, and aflually beKeved that he diftin* 
guilhed his image in the jar. 

To explain the c^fe ot this phenomenon, we 
muft obferve,. that concave minors differ from plane 
ones by producing different effefts. 

The image of an objefl placed before a vertical 
plane mirror appears behind it, at a difianqe equal 
to that which is between it and the furface of the 
mirror, in the fame pbfition and. of the fame fize ;. 
but an objje£): placed before a. concave mirror, he* 
yond the focus of its concavity, appears inverted 
before the mirror,, and fmaller than it really is^ 
By a natural confequence therefore, an inverted 
obje£l,. by means of iiich a mirror^, mull appear in 
its proper pofition.. 

This being, the cafe, if an inverted objefi be 
concealed, at a proper difiance from the bottom of a 
box, furnifhed with a concave mirror, the objeft 
will appear in its natural pofition, towards a fmall 
aperture made in the box near the focusof refleftioij. * 

Now if feveralinverted figures be arranged round 
a circle, fupported in an horizontal* manner ou&apos; a 
pivot, like* the card of a mariner&apos;s compafs, by the 
help of a&quot; magnet or thread the circle may be turned- 
round at pleafure, fo as to prefent to the mirror any 
of the figures, which will of courfe appear in thelar*

ing the age, the chara£ler and ph^ogpomy of the; 
perfon who is to appear; and by thefe means the 
conjaror has it in his power to produce a figure cor«.

rr^HE ancients feem to have confidered founds 
•*• under no other point of view than that of 
mufic ; that is to fay, as affe£ting the ear in an a- 
greeable manner : it is even very doubtful whetheir 
they were acquainted with any thifig more than 
melody, and whether they had any art fimilar to 
that which we call compofition. The modems, 
however, by attending to the philofophy of founds, 
have made many difcoveries in this department, fo&gt;much neglefted by the ancients ; axud bence hjis a- 
rifen a new fcience, dillinguiflied by the name of 
acouftics.. Acouftics have for their objeft the na- 
ture of founds confidered, in general, both in a 
mathematical and pbilofophical view* This fcience 
therefore comprehends mufic, &apos;which confiders the 
ratios of founds, fo far as they are ^greeabl^ to the 
ear, either by their fuccefliotni^ which conAitutc^ 
melody;^ or by their fimultaneiety, which forms 
harmony. We fliaH here give a brief account of 
every thing mofi curious and interefting in regard 
to this fcience.

Definition of found; how diffuftd and tranfmtted 
to our organs of hearing; experiments on this. 
fubjeB ; different ways of producing founds 

Sound is nothing elfe but the vibration of the 
particles of the air» occafioned either by Tome fud« 
den agitation of ^ certain mafs of the atmofphere/ 
violently comprefTed or expanded, or by the com- 
munication of the vibration of the infenfible parts of 
a hard and elaftic body. 

Thefe are the two heft known ways of producing 
found. The ejiplofion of a piftol, or of any other 
kind of fire aims, produces a report or found, be-&apos; 
caufe the air or elafljic fluid, contained in the gun- 
powder, being /uddenly dilated, &apos;.comprefles the ex- 
ternal air with great violence : the latter in confe- 
quence of its elaflicity, r^-a3s on the furrounding 
atmosphere, and produces in its moleculae an ofcil- 
latory motion, which occafions the found, and which 
extends to a greater or lefs diAance, according to 
the intenfity of the caufe. that gave rife to it* 

The other method of producing found, is to ex- 
cite in an elaftic body, vibrations fufficiently rapid 
to occafion, in the furrounding parts of the aip^ a 
fimilar motion. Thus, an extended ftring, when 
ftnick, emits a found ; and its ofcillations, that is 
to fay its motion backward and forward, may be 
diftinftly feen. The elaftic parts of the air ftruc k 
by the ftring, duving the time it is. vibrating;^ 9x:e

themfelves put into a ftate of vibration, and com* 
xnunicate this motion to the neighbouring ones. 
Sach alfo is the mechanifm by which n bell pro- 
duces its found : when flruck, its vibrations are 
fenfible to the hafid which touches it. 

That air is the vehicle of found, may&apos; be proved 
by the following experiment : if a bell be fufpend- 
ed in the receiver of an air-pump, the found of it 
decreafes in proportion as the air is exhaufied, and 
at laft becomes totally infenfible when a com|&gt;lete 
vacuum has been formed. 

Sound always ceaies when the vibrations of the 
foborous body c^fe, of becofne too weak. Thia 
mky be proved alfo by an experimeiit j for when 
the vibrations of a -fonorous body ar€l damped by 
any foft body, the found feems fuddenly to ceafe • 
10 a piano^forte therefore the quills are furnifhed 
with bits of cloth, that by touchittg the firings 
when they fall down, they may damp their vibra* 
tions. On the other hand, when the fonorous body 
is, by its nature, c^ipaWe of continuing its vibra-

With foand : the velocity of found is very mode-

ner. 

Let a cainiion be placed at the diftance of feveral 
Ifaqufand yards, and let an obferver, with a pendu* 
ium that vibrates feconds, o# rather half fecohdSi 
put the pendulum in motion, as foon as he fees 
the flafli, and then coujit the number of feeonds or 
half feeonds which elapfe between that period and 
tlie moment when he hears the explofion. It is 
evident, that if the moment when the flafli is feen 
be considered as the fignal of the explofion, tiothing 
will be ncceflary, to obtain the number of yards 
which the found has paffed over in a fecond or 
half fecond^ but to divide the number of the yards, 
between the place of obfervation and the cannon^ 
by the number of tbc^ feeonds or half feeonds which 
have been counted. 

Now the momeait wben the flalh is perceived

How founds may be propagated in every dire&amp;ion^ 
without confufion. 

This is a very fingular phenomenon in the pro- 
pagation of founds ; for if feveral perfons fpeak at 
the feme time, or play on inftruments, their diffe- 
rent founds are heard fimultaneoufly, or all together, 
either by one pcrfon, or by feveral perfons, with- 
out being confounded in pafling through the fame 
place in different direSions. &apos;Let u&amp;endeavour to 
account for this phenomenon. 

The moleculae of the air oontiguous to the.fo- 
norous body receive .from- it an ofciliatoryi arid vi- 
bratory motion, which; in confeqiience of •their 
elafticity, is fucceffively * tranfmitted to^ a certain

certain tone is emitted, in an apartment, it cannot 
be repeated but by thofe firings of the inftruinent 
which are in unifon with it. Sounds of greater 
intenfity cannot be propagated with more velocity, 
though the vibrations of the aerial moleculae which 
tranfmit them be ftronger, becaufe they are always 
ifochronous, ]ike thofe of pendulums more or lefs 
^removed from the vertical line, or firings more or 
lefs bent. 

Of echoes: how produced; account of iht mofk re* 

niarkable echoes^ and offome phenomena refpeSing 
thein* 

Echoes are well known ; but however common 
&quot;this phenomenon may be, it muft be allowed that 
the inanner in which it is produced, is involved in 
confiderable obfcurity; and that the explanation 
given of it does not fufficiently account for all the 
circumfiances attending it. 

All philofophers almoft have afcribed the forma- 
tion of echoes to a reflexion of found, fimilar to 
that experienced by light, when it falls on a po- 
• iiOied body ; but, as D&apos;Alembert obferves, this ex- 
planation is falfe ; if it were not, a polilhed furface 
would be neceffary for the produ&amp;ion of an echo ; 
but it is well known that xhis is not the cafe. 
Echoes indeed are frequently heard oppofite to old 
walls, which are far from being polithed; Bear

(hapelefs inaiTes of rock, and in the neighbourhood 
of forefls, and even of clouds. This reflexion of 
found the;-efore is not of the fame nature as that of 
light. 

It is evident however, that the formation of an 
echo can be afcribed only to the repercuffion of 
found ; fdr echoes are never heaard^ but when found 
is intercepted and iQade to rebound by one or more 
obftacles. 

Sound, as already faid, is propagated in every 
dire£Uon by the vibration of the particles of the 
air ; but if any column of air refts^gainft fome ob*^ 
&apos;ftacle that prevents the dire£l movement of the elaf^ 
tic globules, Which ferve as the vehicle of foundi 
it muft rebound in a contrary direction, and ftri* 
king the ear» if it meets with one in the lipe of 
repercuflion, convey to it a repetition of the fame

that organ at the fame inftant.

ihall not fucceed the dire6l found, till after one 
twelfth of a fecond ; and as found moves at the rate 
of about 1142 feet in a fecond, and confequently 
about 95 feet in the twelfth of a fecond, it thence 
follows that, to render the reverberated found dif- 
tingui(faable from the direQ. found, . the obftacle 
malt be at the di&amp;an^e of no more than about 48^ 
feet. . &apos; 

There are fingle and compound echoes. In the 
former, only one repetition of the found is heard ; 
intheiatterj there are 2, 3, 4, 5,&amp;c. repetitions. 
We arer even told of echoes that can repeat the fame 
word 40 or 50 times. ! 

Single echoes are thofe where there is only one 
obftacle; but double, triple, or quadruple echoes, 
give us reafon to fuppofe. fevcral obflacles idifpofed 
in fuch a manner^ that the different refl.e6ted founds 
ilrike the ear at times fenfibly different.

pronounte fevcral words before the repetition of the 
firft has reached the ear.

Provide two heads or bufts, ftiadeof pafteboard^

a diftance from each other as you may think pro* 
per. Then convey a tube of tin-plate, an inch in

the pedefta! on which it refts, and below the floor- 
itig, till it reach the mouth of the other figtire,^

The fecret of the magic mirrbr, as it is called^ 
depends on the fame theory. The conftf uftiori of 
this mfarror is as follows :

196 AMUSEMENTS 

Fix, in a vertical pofition, a concave mirror, two 
feet in diameter, and of fuch a degree of curvature, 
that the focus of the rays which fall upon it, in a 
parallel dire£lion, may be at the diftance of twelve 
or fifteen inches, from the refltfting furface; At this 
diftance place a fmall figure, but in fuch a madner, 
that its head may be exa£lly in the focus. 

This mirror muft be placed at the diftance of 8 or 
to feet from a wall oppofite to if, and parallel to its 
furface : the wall muft have in i an aperture, equal 
to the furface of the mirror, concealed by a very 
fine curtain, that the found may eafily pafs throught 
it. Provide alfo a fecond mirror of the fame form, 
with a fimilar figure, and place it behind the wall at 
the diftance of two or three feet from it, and oppo- 
fite to the former, with the figure in its focus. It 
may be readily conceived, that when a perfon only 
whifpers into the ear of the fmall figure beliind the 
wall, a perfon {landing near that placed iti the focus, 
of the oppofite mirror, will hear very diflindly the 
words whifpered into the car of the former. In 
this inanner, the perfon who alks a queftion, ftanding 
near the firft figure, hears the anfwer which h 
whifpered into the ear of. the other behind the 
wall. 

In order to conceal entirely the apparatus, which 
produces this effeft, and to render it much more ex- 
traordinary, the pretended concave magic mirror 
may be covered with a piece of gauze^ which wiO

The Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, at 
Paris, for the year 1692, fpeak of a very remarkable 
echo ia the court of a gentleman&apos;s feat, called le 
Genetay, in the neighbourhood of Rouen. If is 
attended with this fingular phenonienon, that a per- 
fon who fings or fpeaks in a low tone does not hear 
the repetition of the echo, but only his own voice ; 
while, on jLhe other hand, thofe who liften hear only 
the repetition of the echo, but with furprifing va-^ 
nations ; for the echo feems fometimes to approach 
and fometimes to recede, and at length ceafes when 
the perfon who fpeaks removes to fome diftance in 
a certain direftion. Sometimes only one voice is 
heard, fomotimes feveral, and fometimes one is 
heard on the right and another on the left. An ex- 
planation of all thefe phenomena, deduced from the 
femi-circular form of the court, may be feen in the 
abore colte3ion. 

Experiments re/peSing the vibrations of mujical 
firings^ which form the bafis of the theory of 
mufic. 

If a ftriBg of metal or cat-gut, fuch as is ufed for 
mufical inftruments, made fall at one of its extremi- 
ties , be extended in a horizontal dire£lion over a

fixed bridge, and a weight be fufpended from the 
other extremity, fo as to ftretch it ; this firing, when - 
firuck^ will emit a found produced by reciprocal 
vibrations which are fen&amp;ble to the fight. 

If the part of the firing made to vibrate be iborten- 
cd, and reduced to one half of its length, any perfon 
who has a mufical ear will obferve, that the new 
found is the o£lave of the former ; that is. to fay, 
twice as (harp. 

If the vibrating part of the firing be reduced to 
two thirds of the original length, the found it emits 
will be the fifth of the firft. 

If the length be reduced to tbree^fourths^ it will 
give the fourth of the firft. 

If it be reduced to f , it will give the third major j 
if to i, the third minor. If reduced to f , it will 
give what is called the tone major ; if to y^, the 
tone minor; and if to ih ^^^ femi-tone, or that 
which in the gamut is between mi and Ja or Jf 
smdJoL 

The fame refults will be obtained if a firing be 
faftened at both ends, and -|, I, and -J of it be fuc- 
ceffively iiitercented by means ef a moveable

Such is the refult of a determinate degi-ee of&apos;ttn- 
fion applied to a ftring, when the length of it has 
been made to vary. Let us now fuppofe that the 
length of the firing is conftantly the fame, but that 
^ts degree of tenfion is varied. The foltewing is 
what we are taught by experiment on this fub. 
jetl: 

If a weight be fufpended at one end of a firing of 
a determinate length, made faft by the other, and if 
the tone it emits be fixed, when another weight qua- 
druple of the former is applied, the tone will be the 
otlave of the former ; if the weight be nine times as 
heavy, the tone will be the octave of the fifth ; and 
fo on ; fo that the tones will become acute in the 
ratio of Ae fquare roots of the weights. 

The fize of the firings has an efiefl in regard to- 
the tones, as well as the different lengths of the 
firing, and the weight by which it is ftretched; for 
it is proved by experiment, that a firing twice as 
fmall in diameter as another, every thing elfe being 
the fame, emits a tone which is the o3ave of that of 
the other ; and that if the diameter is only a third of 
that of the other, the tone is the oQave of the fifth 
of that other ftring, following the order of the diatonic 
fcale. / 

.We may thence conclude, that the tones of the 
iftufical firings are in the direft ratio of the fquare 
root of the weights by which they are ftretthed, 



.*_,» 



MUSICAL STRINGS. 201 

aad in the inverfe ratio of the lengths and diameters 
of thefe firings. . , &apos; 

Confequehtly, to bring into unrfon ftrings which 
differ in length and diameter, and which arc flretched 
J)y different weights, the compound ratiio thence re- 
fitting rauft be cxaftly the fame, in oi:der that the 
frequency of the vibrations in one may be compen- 
fated by the flownefs of another. Thus two firings 
of the faraefize, the lengths of which are as 2 to i, 
and the flretching weights as 4 to 1 , ^ill have their 
vibrations ifochronous^ that is to fay, they will be iti 
u&apos;nifon : two ftrings, the idiameter^ of which arb as 
2 to 1, and the&quot; lengths as 1 to 2, ftretchedby equal 
weights, will be in linifon alfo, as well as thofe 
which,; being of equal lengths, have their diameters- 
as 2 to 1, and the flretching weight as 4 to 1. 

We may Conclude therefore, that two firings, the 

&apos;diameters pf which are as 3 to 2, and th^ fengths as 

1 to 3, cannot be in unifon, unlefs the weighty, by 

which they are flretched^ be; to each other i^ the fame 

ratio as 1 to 4. . 

To determine the number of the vibrations^ made by a 
Jlring of a given length and Jize, whenjiretchtdby 
a given weight. 

A very ingenious^ metliwd, invented by M. Sanveuir, 
for finding&apos;the number of thefe vibrations, *naay be 
feen in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, 
for 170C. Having obferved, when tvro organ-pipes,

very low and Having tones very near to each otker^ 
were founded at the fame time, that a ferics of pul- 
fations or beats were heard in the founds ; and by re- 
fleding on the caufe of this phenomenon, he found 
that thefe beats arofe from the periodical meeting of 
the coincident vibrations of the two pipes. Hence 
he concluded/ that if the number of thefe pulfation^,, 
which took place in a fecond, couM be afcertained 
by a ftop watch, and if it were poflibte alio to de« 
termjne, by the nature of the confonance of fehe two 
pipes, the ratio of the vibrations which they made 
in the fame time, he fiiould be able to afeertain the 
real number of the vibrations made by each* 

We fliall here fuppofe, for example, that two 
organ-pipes are exaftly tuned, the one to mi flat, and 
the other to mi : it is well known, that as the inter- 
val between thefe two tones is a femi-tone minor, 
exprcffed by the ratio of 24 to 25, the higher pipe 
Will perform 25 vibrations while the lower performs 
only 24 ; fo that at ^ach 25th vibration qi tlie for^ 
mer, or the 24th of the latter, there will be a pulfa- 
tion ; if 6 pulfations therefore are obferved in the- 
covirfe of 1 fecond, Mfe ought to conclude, that. 24, 
vibrations of the one and 25 of the oth^r tftke pl^ce 
in ihe tenth of a fecond : and confequently that the 
one perforoAS. 240 vibrations, andc the. othei^ 250, in 
the courfe of a fecond. , 

M. Sauveur.made experiments according to thii. 
idea, and found that an open organ^-pipe, 5 feet in. 



MUSICAL STRINGS. 203 

length, makes 100 vibrations per fecond ; confe- 
qu^ntly, one of 4 feet, which gives the lower triple 
oftave, and the loweft found perceptible to the ear, 
would make only ift^; on the other hand, a pipa^ 
of one inch lefs tV» being the fliorteft the found of 
which can be diftinguifhed, will give in a fecond 
6400 vibrations. The Kniits,* therefore, of the 
ffoweft and the • qdickeft vibrations appreciable b)r 
the ear, are according to M. Sauveur, i2iand 6400. 

We fliall not enlarge further on thefe details, but 
proceed to a. very curious phenomenon rcfpeftin^ 
ftrings in a ftate of vibration. 

Make hti a ffring by both its extremities,, and by 
means of a bridge divide it into aliquot parts, for 
example, j on the one fide and t on the other, andi 
pat the larger part, that i* to fay the f in a ftate of 
vibration ; if the bridge abfolutely intercepts all com* 
fnunication from« the one part to the other, thefe f 
of the firing, as is well known, will give the tone of 
the fourth of the whole firing ; if f, be intercepted^ 
the tone will bethe tierce major. 
, But if this bridge only prevents the ^holie of the* 
ftring from vibrating, without intercepting the com^ 
munication of motion from the one part to the other,, 
the greater part will then emit only the fame found&apos; 
as the lefs, and the -J of the firing, which in the 
former cafe gave the fourth of the whole firing, will 
give only the double oflave, which is the tone pro- 

K 6 



« 



204 &apos; AMUSIMENTS ON 

per to the fourth of the firing. The cafe is the fame 
if this fourth be touched : its vibrations, by_ being 
communicated to the other three-fourths, will make 
them found, but in fuch a manner as to give only 
this double o£lave. 

The following reafon, which may he rendered 
plain hy an experinjent, is afligned for this pheno- 
menon: when the bridge abfolutcly intercepts all 
communication between the two parts of the firings 
the whole of the largell part vibrates together; and 
if it be i of the whole firing, it makes, agreeably 
to the general law, 4 vibrations in the time that the 
wh&lt;^e firing would make 3 : its found therefore i» 
the fourth of the whole firing. 

But in the fecond cafe, the larger part of the 
firing divides itfelf into 3 aliquot parts,, each o£ 
which is equal to tbe lef«, and all thefc di[lin£l Jior- 
tions perform their particular vibrations; for if bits 
of red paper, for example, be placed upon all (he 
points of divifion. and bits of white paper in the 
middle of each divifion, the former will remain mo- 
tionlefs, but the latter will drop off as foon as. the 
firing begins to vibrate,. 

. If the part of the flring immediatefy mgde to 
vibrate, inflead of an aliquot part of the remainder, 
be only ^ of it, the whole ftring will then divide 
iifelf into feventh parts, and will emit only that tone 
which belongs to ^ of its length. 
If the Icfs part of the firing be incomm^nfurablft 



&apos;t 



to tbe greater, the found will abfolutely be difcor- 
4ant, and will almofl immediately ceafe.^

In a word, if you have an experienced ear, you 
will be able to diftinguilh tliefe different founds, 
either in the refonance of a firing or in that of any 
other fonorous body, and even in the voice* 

Another, method of making this experiment, 

Sufpend a pair of tongs by a woolen .or cotton

ing the extremities of it around the f^re-finger of 
each hand, put thefe two fingers im&lt;5 your ears. If 
the lower part of the tongs be then flruck, you will 
€rfl hear a, loud and grave found, like that of a large

nied by feveral others, more aeiite, among which,^

fuddcnlyt by means of a foft body, the found of the 

former. 

Molt people have heard the glafles on a table 
emit a found when a perfon near them has been 
finging with a ftrong and a loud voice. The llrings 
of an inftrument, though not touched, are often 
heard to found in confequence of the fame caufe, 
efpecially after fwelling notes long continued. 

In a manner fomewhat fimilar, the diverfity of 
tones agitates, in various ways, the fibres of our 
bodies, excites the paflions, and produces in the 
fout fenfations fo different. 

On the harmonical founds heard with, the principal 
found: Whether they have, their four€e immediately 
in the fonorous hody^ or exijl inr the air or the 
organ f 

It is very probable that the principal foiuid is the 
only one that derives its origin immediately from 
the vibrations of the fonorous body. Philofophers 
of eminence have endeavoured to difcover whether, 
independently of the total vibrations made by a body, 
there are alfp partial vibrations ; but hitherto they 
have been able to obfprve only fimple vibrations. 
3e(ides, bow c#n it be conceived that the whole of 
a firing ibould be in vibration, and that during its 
motion it fhould divide itfelf into two or three, parts 
that perform alfo their difiia£l vibrations ?

It mufi then be faid, that thefe harmonica! founds 
of bftave, twelfth, feventqepth,&amp;c. are in the air, 
or the organ: both fuppofttions are probable; for 
(ince a determinate found has the property of put« 
ting into a Hate of vibration bodies difpofed to give 
its oSave, its twelfth,&amp;c. we miiR allow that this 
found may put in motion the particles of the air, 
fufceptible of vibrations of double, triple, quadru* 
pie, and quintuple velocity. What however ap- 
pears moft probable in this refpeft, is, that thefe vi- 
brations exift only in the ear : it feems indeed to be 
proved by the anatomy of this organ, that found is 
tranfmitted to the foul only by the Vibrations o£ 
thofe nervous fibres which cover the intierior part of 
the ear ; and as they are of different lengths, there 
are always fome of them which perform their vibra- 
tions tfochronous to thofe of a given found. But, 
at the lame time, and in confequence of the property 
above mentioned, this found mu ft put in motion 
thofe fibres fufceptible of ifochronous vibrations,* 
and even thofe which can make vibrations pf dou- 
ble, triple, quadruple,&amp;c. velocity. Such, in our 
opinion, is the moft probable explanation tha( can 
be given of this fmgular phenomenon.

of order. 

This., reafontng&apos;will ibe ifuf&amp;ciently proved by an

When the vibrations of two founds are performed 
in fuch a manner, that three of .the one correfpond 
to one of the other, thefe give the (impleil rela- 
tion next to thofe above-mentioned. Who does 
not know that the concord moft agreeable to the 
ear is the twelfth, or the offave of the fifth? In that 
refped: it even furpafles the fifth. 

Next to the fifth, is the double o£lave of the 
fifth, or the feventeenth major, which is expreile^

twelfth,; is the moft agreeable. . i i 

The fourth^ expreifed by J, the third minor, ex-

But it appears that all the other founds, after 
thefe relations, iare too complex for the foul to per« 
ceive their order. 

The following very ftrong objcaion, however, 
may be made to this reafoning. How can the

hitherto be^n faid, may therefore be more ingenious 
thaa folid. 

We cannot help acknowledging, that we are 
rather inclined to think fo; and it appeaffs to us, 
that the celebrated experiment oh the refonance of 
bodies, may ferve to account, in a ftill more plau- 
fible manner, for the jpleafure arifing from concords ; 
,becaufe, as every found degenerates into mere noife 
when not accompanied with its twelfth and its feven- 
teenth major, befides its oftaves, is it not evidenf, 
that when we combine any found with its twelfth, 
or its feventeenth major, or with both at the fame 
time, we only imitate the procefs of nature, by 
giving to that found, in a fuller and more fenfibie 
rdanner, the accompaniment which nature itfelf 
gives it, and which cannot fail to pleafe the ear, on 
account of the habit it has acquired of hearing 
them together ? This is fo agreeable &apos;to truth, that 
there are only two primitive concords, the twelfth 
and the feventeenth major ; arvd that the reft, as the 
fifth, the third major, the fourth and the fixth are 
derived from them. We know alfo, that thtjfe two 
primitive concords, are the moft perfeft of all, and 
that they form the moft agreeable accompaniment 
that can be given to any found, though, - on the 
harpfichord for example, to facilitate the execution, 
the third major and the fifth itfelf, which, with the 
o6lave, form what is galled perfeft harmony, are

Tubftituted in their ftead. But this harmony is per- 
feft only by reprefentation, and the moh perfeft of 
all,, would be that in which the twelfth and the 
fcventcenth were combined with the fundamental 
found and its oftaves. Rameau therefore adopted 
it as often as he could in his chorufes. We might 
enlarge farther on this idea ; but what has been al- 
ready faid will be fuflficient for every Intelligent • 
reader. 

Some very extraordinary things are related in re- 
gard to the effefts produced by the mulic of the 
ancients, which on account of their fingularity we 
Ihall here mention. We (hall then examine them 
more minutdy, and (hew that, in this refpeQ, the 
modern mufic is not inferior to the ancient. 

Agamemnon, it is faid, when he fet out on the 
expedition againft Troy, being defirous to fecure 
the fidelity of his wife, left with her a Dorian mu- 
fician, who by the eflFeft of his airs rendered fruit- 
lefs, for a long time, the attempts of yEgifthus to 
obtain her afFeftion; but that prince having dif. 
covered the caufe of her refiftance, got the mufician 
put to death, after which he triumphed, without 
difficulty, over the virtue of Clytemneftra. 

We are told alfo that, at a later period, Pytha- 
goras compofed fongs or airs capable of &apos;curing the 
moft violent paflions, and of recalling men to the 
paths of virtue and moderatiqp : While the phyfician 
prefcribes draughts for curing bodily difcafes, an 



I 



MUSICAL TON£J&lt;Bi^&apos; 

able mulictan might therefore prefcribe an air for 
rooting out a vicious pallion. 

The Itory of Timotheus, the direflor of the muflc 
of Alexander the Great, is well known. One day, 
while the prince was at uble, Timotheus performed 
an air in the Phrygian talte, which made fuch an im- 
preffion on him, that being already heated with wine, 
lie flew to his arms and was going to attack his gucfts, 
had not Timotheus immediately changed the llile of 
his performance to the Sub-Phrygian. This change 
calmed the impetuous fury of the- monarch, who 
refumed his place at table. This was the fame 
Timotheus who at Sparta experieneol the humiliaB 
tion of feeing publicly fupprclfcd four ftrings which 
he had added to his lyre. The fevere Spartans-thought 
that this innovation would tend to eflfeminate their 
manners, by introducing a more extensive and more 
.variegated kind of mullc. This at any.ratc proves, 
that the Greeks were convinced that mafic had a pe- 
culiar influence on manners; and that it was the 
duty of government to keep a watchful eye over 
that art. 

Who indeed can doubt that mufic is capable of , 
-producing fuch an eSeft ? tet us only interrogate 
ourfelves, and examine what have been our fenfa- 
tions on hearing a raajeftic or warlike piece of muCc, 
or a tender and pathetic air fung or played * 
preffion. Who does not feel that the latter

Tnuqh to melt the Ibul and difpofe it to pleafare, as 
the former to roufe and exalt it ? Several fafts in re- 
gard to the modern mufic place it, in this refpeft, on 
a level with the ancient. 

The modern mufic indeed has had alfo its Timo- 
theus, who could excite or califi at his pleafure the 
moft impetuous emotions. Henry III. king o€ 
France, haying given a concert on occafioil of the 
marriage of the Duke de Joyeufe, Claudin le Jeune, 
a celebrated mufician of that period, executed cer- 
tain airs, which had fuch an elFeft on a young noble- 
man, that he drew his fword and challenged every 
one near him to combat;- but Claudin, equally pru- 
dent as Timotheus, inftantly changed to an air ap- 
parently Sub-Phrygian, which appeafed the furious 
youth. 

What fhall we fay of Stradella, the celebrated 
compofer, -whofe mufic made the daggers drop from 
the hands of his affaflins ? Stradella having carried 
offthemiftrefs of *i Venetian mufician, and retired , 
with her to Rome, the Venetian hired three de- 
fperadoes to affaffinate him ; but fortunately for 
Stradella they had an ear fenfible to harmony. Thefe 
affaffins, while waiting for a favourable opportunity 
to execute their purpofe, entered the church of St. 
&apos; John de Latran, during the performance of an ora- 
torioi&apos; compofed by the perfon whom they intended 
to deftroy, and&quot; were fo affefted by the mufic that&apos;tbey 
abandoned their deCgn, and even waited on the mu- 



f ,

fician to forewarn him of his danger. Stradella, 
however was not always fo fortunate ; other aflafTins, 
who apparently had no ear for mufic, ftabbed him 
fome time after at Genoa: this event took place 

aboiit the year 1670. 

Every body almoft has heard that mufic is a cure 
for the bite of the tarantula. This cure, which 
was formerly, confidered as certain, has by fome 
been contefted ; but, however this may be, Father 
Schott in his works gives the tarantula air, which ap- 
pears to be very dull, as well as that employed by 
the Sicilian filhermen to entice tKe thunny fifli into 
their nets. But it is probable that fifh are no great 
connoifleurs in mufic. 

Various anecdotes are related refpe&amp;ing perfons 
whofe lives have been prefervcd by mufic effefting a 
fort of revolution in their conftitutions. A woman 
being attacked, for feveral months, with the vapours, 
and confined to her apartment, had refolved to ftarve 
hcrfelf to death : flie was however prevailed on, but 
not without great difficulty, to fee a reprefentation 
of the Strua Padrona^ at the conclufion of which 
flie found herfelf almoft cured ; and renouncing her 
melancholy refolution, was entirely reft ored to health 
by a few more reprefentations of the like kind. 

There is a celebrated air in Switzerland, called 
Ram des Vaches^ which had fuch an extraordinary* 
efie£l on the Swifs troops in the French ff^rvice^

that they alvrays fell into a deep melancholy whea 
they heard it ; Louis XIV. therefore, forbade it ever 
to be played in France, under the pain of a fevere 
penalty. We are told of a Scotch air, which has a 
fimilar effefl on the natives of Scotland. 

Mod animals and even infers are not infenfible to 
the pleafure of mufic. There are few muficians 
perhaps who have not feeti fpiders fufpend them- 
felves by their threads in order to be near the inftru- 
ments. We have feveral times had that fatisfaftion. 
We have feen a dog/ who at the adagio of a fonata 
never failed to fiiew figns of attention, and fome 
peculiar fenfation by fowling. 

The moll fingular faft, however, is that men- 
tioned by Burney in his Hiftory of Mufic. This 
author relates, that an officer being ihut up in the 
Baftille, had pertniffion to carry with him a lute, 
on which he was an excellent performer; but he 
had fcarcely made ufe of it for three or four days, 
when the mice ifTuing fropi their holes, and the 
fpiders fufpending themfelves from the cieling by 
their threads, affembled around him to participate 
in his melody* His averfion to thefe animals made 
their vifit at firft difagreeable ; and induced him to 
lay afide this recreation ; but he foon was fo ac« 
cuftomed to them, that they became a fource of 
amufement. 

We have learned from perfons worthy of credit,

Greek fongs on the oxen» which the Greek farmers

-Thofe who have feen, at Bartholomew fair, in 
Smithfield, two elephanis follow exaflly the meafure

they were kept, and humour all their variations, by

difficulty in believing what BufFon has faid refpefting 
the fingular tafte of thefe animals for harmony. 

In a word, without deciding whether the fables of 
Amphion and Arlon may not, in fome meafure be 
founded on truth, we know that , the noify found 
of trumpets, and the harmony of. military inflru- 
ments, excite the courage of foldiers, and the ar- 
dour of horfes ; and the dire£lors of caravans take 
care to be accompanied on their march, -by per-

to wind inftfuments, fuch as&quot; the flute ; for the 
found was afcribed to the interior furface of the tube. 
The celebrated Euler firft reftified this error, and U 
xcfults from his refearches : 

ift. That the found, produced by a flute, is no- 
thing elfe than that of the cylinder of air contained 
ill it. 

ad. That the weight of the atmofphere, which 
comprefTes it, afls the part of a ftretching weight. 

3d. That the found of this&lt;;ylinder of air, is ex- 
aftly the fame as that which would be produced by 
a firing of the fame mafs and length, extended by 
a weiglit equarl to that which cdmprefles the bafe of 
the cylinder. 

This faft is confirmed by experiment and calcu- 
lation ; for Euler found that a cylinder of air of 7I 
Rhinlandilh feet, at a time when the barometer is at 
a mean height, muft give z-JoUut ; and fuch is 
nearly the length of the open pipe of an oi^an which 
emits that found. The reafon of its being generally 
made 8 feet, is becaufe that length is required at 
thofe times when the weight of the atmofphere is 
greater. 

Since the weight of the atmofphere produces, in 
regard to the founding cylinder of air, the fame ef- 
feft as that produced by the weight which ftretches 
a firing, the more that weight is increafed, the more 
will the found be elevated ; it is therefore obferved 
that during ferene, warm ^f eather, the tone of wind

inftruments is I&apos;aifed ; and that during cold and 
ftormy weather it is lowered. Thele inftruments alfo 
become higher in proportion as they are Tieated ; 
becaufe the mafs of the cylinder of heated air be- 
coming le/s, while the weight of the atmofphere re- 
mains unchanged, the cafe is exaftly the fame as if 
a ftring fliould become lefs, and be flill ftretched by 
the fame weight : every body knows that fuch a 
firing would emit a higher tone. 

But as ftringed inftruments muft become lower, 
becaufe thq elafticity of the ftrings infenfibly &apos; de- 
creafes, it thence follows that wind and ftringed in- 
ftruments, however well tuned they may be to each 
-other, foon become difcordant. 

A very fingular phenomenon is obferved in re- 
gard to wind inftruments, fuch as the flute and 
huntfman&apos;s horn : With a flute, for example, when 
all the holes are flopped, if you blow faintly into 
the mouth aperture, a certain tone will be produced ; 
if you blow a little ftronger, the tone inftantly rifes 
to the oftave, and by blowing fucceflively with more 
force, you will produce the twelfth or fifth above the 
oftave; then the. double oftave or feventeenth major.

as thofe called the voice ftop» flute ftop,&amp;Cv? A 
coniplete defcription, therefore of an organ, and of 
its conIlru£lion, would be fufEcient to occupy a 
large volume. 

The ancients had hydraulic organs, that is to fay, 
organs t^e found of which was occafioned by air 
produced by the motion of water. Thefe machines 
were invented by Ctefibius. of Alexandria, and his 
fcholar Hero. From the defcription of thefe hy* 
draulic organs, given by Vitruvius, in the tenth 
book of his archite£lure, Perrault conftru6led one 
which he depofited in the king&apos;s library, where the 
Royal Academy of Science&apos;s held their fittings* 
This inftrument indeed is not to be compared to the 
modem organs ; but it is evident that the mechanifm 
of it has ferved as a bafis for that of ours. St .Jerome 
fpeaks with enthufiafm of an organ which had twelve 
pair of bellows, and which could be heard at the 
diftance of a mile. It thence appears that the me- 
thod employed by Ctcfiblus, to produce air to fill

fimplc ; that is tp fay, for a pair of bellows.

A defcription of this machine may be found in the 
Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for the year&gt;773- 

Of a new injirument cdlUd the Harmonica, 

This inflj-oment was invented in America by Dr. 
Fraoklin, who gave a difcription of it to father 
Beccaria, which the latter publifhed in his works, 
printed in 1773. 

It is well known that when the finger, alittls 
moiftencd, is rubbed againft the edge of a drinking &apos; 
glafs, a fweet found is produced ; and th»t the tone 
varies according to the form, fizc, and thicknefs of 
the glafs. The tone may be raifed or lowered alfo 
by putting into the glafs a greater or lefs quantity of 
water. Dr. Franklin fays that an Irifhman, named&apos; 
Pucfceridge, firit conceived the idea, about twenty 
vears before, of conftrufting an inftrumettt with 
feveral glafles of this kind, adjufled to the various 
(ones, and fixed to a ftand in fuch a manner, that 
different airs could be played upon them. Mr. 
Puckcridge having afterwards been burnt in bis 
hoiife, along with (his inftrument, Mr. D&apos;elaval 
conftrnfted another of the fame kind, with glaffes 
better cliofen, which he applied to (he like purpbfe. 
About fourteen or fifteen years ago, an Englifh

I on this inftrument, which however did not lojig 

continue in vogue : at prefent it is confined to ca* 
binets among other mufical curiofities. 

A juggler, fome years ago, to Ihew his dexterity, 
placed on a table eight glaifes of the fame fize, which 
had all the fame.tone, and boailed that he could tune 

f them in an inftant by pouring water into .them, fa 

as to play an air with the utmoft precifion. •* Thofe 
who tune violins or organs,&quot; faid he, &quot; are not fo 

I dexterous as I; fincethey often labour for a quarter 

of an hour, and try the fame pipe or ftring twenty • 
times, before they can bring it to the proper tone.** 
While he pronounced thefe words he poured water 
into the eight glafles ; then ftrikihg them one after

On what is called afalfe voice. 

A fine voice is certainly preferable to every in- 
firument whatever* Unfortunaielyt many perfbn^ 
have only a falfe voice ; but, in general, this does 
not arife from any defe6l in the organs of the voice^ 
which are almoft the fame in all mankind : it origi* 
nates from the ears, owing to an inequality of 
ftrength in thefe organs, or to fome want of delicacy 
or tenfion, in confequence of which, as they re-^ 
ceive unequal impreflions, we neceflarily hear falfe 
founds, and the voice^ which endeavours to imitate 
them, becomes itfclf falfe. On this fubjeft Dr.. 
Vandermonde made a vfery fimpleexperimeht, which 
he relates in his Effay on Improving the Human 
Mind» and which may be repeated on children who 
pronounce with a falfe voice,, in order that a remedy^ 
may be Applied at that tender age when the organs- 
are ft ill fufceptible of modification. 

The experiment, as he defcribes- it, is as follows : 
** I made, choice,&quot; fays he,. ** of a clear day, and 
having fixed of! a fpacious apartment,. I took up my 
ftation in a place judged moft convenient for my 
experiments* I then ftopped one of the ears of the 
child who was to be the fubjeft of them, and made 
her recede from me» till flie no longer heard the. 



4b^a4 of a fjppeatiiig ^y&apos;atcb which I held in my hand^ 
or at Mft until the found ef the bell produced % 
&apos; very weak impreflion on her organs of hearing* I 
then defired hef to reniain in that place,- and imme« 
4iately going up to her unftopped her ear, and 
Aopped the other, taking care to caufeher to fliut 
her mouth, left the found, fhould be communicated 
to the ear through the euftachian tube. I then re- 
turned to my ftation, and making my watch again 
ftrike, the child was quite ^furprifed to find that ihe 
heard tolerably well ; upon which I made a fign to 
her to recede again till (he could fcarcely hear the 
found.&quot; It refults from this experiment, that in the 
ears of perfons who have a falfe voice, th^e is an 
inequality of flrength, and the means of remedying 
this defe£l in children, is to afcertain by a fimilar 
mode, which ear is the weakeft. ** When this has 
been discovered, nothing better can be done, in 
my opinion,&quot; fays Dr. Vandermonde, *• than to 
ftop up the other as^ much as poffible, and to take 
advantage of that valuable opportunity of frequently 
exercifing the weak ear, but in fuch a manner as 
not to fatigue it. The one thus made to labour 
alone will be ftrengthened, while the other will aU 
ways retain the fame force. The child&apos;s ear (hould 
from time to time be unftopped, in order to make it 
fing, and to difcover whether both ears have the 
fame degree of fenfibility.&quot; This natural defe£l may 
be then corre£led, and any perfon may be made to

acquire a true voice, provided the means pointed 
out by Dr. Vandermonde be early eitiployfed. 

Perfons who have a falfe voice, in confequence of 
fome inequality in the ears, may be compared to 
thofe who fquint ; that is to fay who, iii order to 
fee an objeSi diffin&amp;ly, do not turn equally towards 
it the axis of . both eyes, becaufe they have not the 
fame vifual powers. It is probable ,that the former^ 
if they had early accuftomed tbemfelves to make ufe 
of only one ear, would hear diftinftly different 
founds which they would have imitated, and would 
not have contra£led a £alfe voice. 

Of the Speaking Trumpet^ and Ear Trumpet. 

As the fight is aflifted by telefcopes and micro- 
fcopes, fimilar inftruments have been devifed alfo 
for aflifling the faculty of hearing. One of thefe, 
called the fpeaking trumpet, is employed for con- 
veying found to a great di fiance: the other, called 
the ear trumpet, ferves to magnify to the car the 
leaft whifper. 

Sir Thomas Morland, among the moderns, be- 
ftowed the moft labour in endeavouring to improve 
this method of enlarging and conveying found ; and 
on this fubjeft he publifhed a treatife, entitled De 
Tuba Steniorophenica, a name which alludes to the 
voice of Stentor, fo celebrated among the Greeks 
for its great ilrength. The following oblervalio^s 



MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS. 2^^ 

on this fubjeft are in part borrowed from that curi- 
ous work. 

The ancients, it would feem, were acquainted 
with the fpeaking trumpet, for we are told that 
Alexander had a horn, by means of which he could 
give orders to his whole army, however numerous. 
Kircher, on the authority of fome paflages in a m?i- 
nufcript, preferved in the Vatican, makes the dia- 
meter of Its greateft aperture to have been feven 
feet and a half. Of its length he fays nothing, 
and only adds, that it could be heard at the diflance 
of 500 ftadia, or about 2^ miles. 

However this may be, the fpeaking trumpet is 
noticing elfe but a long tube, which at one end is 
only large enough to receive the mouth, and which 
goes on increafing in width to the other extremity, 
bending fomewhat outwards, , The aperture at the 
fmall end mull be a little flattened to fit the mouth ; 
and it ought to have two lateral projeftions to cover 
part of the cheeks. 

Sir Thomas Morland favs, that he caufed feveral 

inftruments of this kind to be conftru&amp;ed, of dif- 

, - &apos; , . &apos; 

ferent fizes, viz. one of four feet and a half ia 

length, by which the voice could be heard at the 

dlftance of 500 geometrical paces ; another 16 feet 

8 inches, which conveyed found 1800 paces; and 

a third, of 24 feet, which rendered the voice audibia 

at the diftance of 2500 paces.

The rcafon of this phenomenon is as follows: 
As the air is an elaftic fluid, fo that every found 
produced in it is tranfmitted fpherically around the 
fonorous body, when a perfon fpeaks at the mouth 
of the trumpet, all the motion which would be com- 
municated to a fpherical mafs of air, of four feet 
radius, for example, is communicated only to a cone, 
the bafc of which is the wider extremity of the 
trumpet. Confequently, if this cone is only the 
hundredth part of the whole fpbere of the fame 
radius, the effeft will be the fame as if the perfon 
fhould fpeak a hundred times^ as loud in the open 
air : the voice muft therefore be heard at a diHance 
a hundred times as great. 

The ear trumpet, an inftrument exceedingly ufe^ 
ful to the deaf, is nearly the reverfe of the fpeaking 
trumpet : it colle6b, in the auditory paflage, all the 
found contained within it ; or it increafes the found 
produced at its extremity, in a ratip which may be 
faid to be as that of the wide end to the narrow end* 
Thus, for example, if the wide end be 6 inches in 
diameter, and the aperture applied to the ear 6 lines, 
which, in furfaces gives the ratio of i to 144, the 
found will be increafed 144 times; or nearly fo; 
for we do not believe that this increafe is exa£lly in 
the inverfe ratio of the furfaces; and it muft be aU 
Iqwedy that in this refpe£l acouftics are not fo far 
advanced as optics.

chefe fmall plates of iron or filings will be attacked 
and ditfolved by the acid of the vitriol, while its 
copper will be precipitated and depofited in the place 
of the iron diifolved. If the bit of iron be too large 
to be entirely diflblved, it will be fo completely co- 
vered with cupreous particles, that it will feem to 
be converted into copper. Tliis is an experin^ent 
commonly fliewn to thofe who vifit copper mines. 
In Savoy I have feen a key become entirely of a

REMARK. 

In this cafe there is no real tranfmutation, but 
only the appearance of one. The iron is not 
changed into copper: the latter, held ih folution 
by the liquor impregnated with the vitriolic acid, 
is only depofited in the place of the iron with 
which the acid becomes charged, while it aban- 
dons the copper. Every time indeed that a men- 
ftruum, holding any fubftance in folution, is pre- 
fented to another fubftance which it can diflblve 
with more facility, it abandons the former, and

becomes charged with the fecond. This is fo 
certain, that when the liquor which has depofited 
the copper is evaporated, it produces cryftals of 
green vitriol ; which, as is well known, are formed 
by the combination of the vitriolic acid with iron. 
This procefs is indeed praftifed, on a large fcale, 
in the mine which I vifited. The liquor in quef- 
tion, which is nothing but a pretty ftrong folution 
of blue vitriol, is put into catks, or large fquare 
refervoirs ; pieces of old iron being then immerfed 
in it, are at the end of fome time converted into 
a fort of fediment, from which copper is extrafted. 
The liquor, thus charged with iron, is evaporated- 
to a certain degree, and wooden rods are immerfed 
in it, which become covered with cryftals of green 

vitriol. &quot; V 

This experiment may be made alfo by diflblving 
copper in the vitriolic acid, and then diluting the 
folution with a little water. This is a new proof 
that the liquor only depofits the copper with which 
it is charged.

and much better, by pouring into the liquor a fo-

REMARK* 

It is by a fimllar effeft that hard water decom- 
pofes foap, inftead of diffolving it, atid fuffers to 
be depofited a greater or lefs quantity of calcareous 
earth. The manner in which this is done,, is as 
follows : 



• t 



AMUSEMENTS. 24I 

Water, in general, is hard only becaufe it holds 
in Iblution felenite or gypfum (JEi combination of 
vitriolic acid with calcareous earth), which it has 
diflblved in its paffage through the bowels of the 
eaftth, pr which has been formed by the water firft 
becoming impregnated with vitriolic falts, and af- 
terwards in its courfe meeting with, and diflblving, 
a portion of calcareous earth. ^ 

On the other hand, foap is an artificial combi- 
nation of fixed alkali with oil, or with fome other 
greafy fubftance, and which have no great affi- 
nity. 

When foap therefore is diflblved in water im- 
pregnated with felenite, the vitriolic acid of the 
latter having a greater tendency to unite with the 
fixed alkali, flian with the calcareous earth, which 
enters into the compofition of the felenite, aban- 
dons that earth, and combines with the fixed aU 
kali in fuch a manner, that the foap is decompofed ; 
and, as the oil is immiscible with water» it is dif^ 
fufed through it in the form of white flakes, while 
the calcareous earth of the felenite falls to the 
bottom. .

the zaffer it^ blue colour ; then dilute the foiution, 
which is very acrid, with common water. If you 
write with this liquor on paper, the charafters will

expenfive, and nothing is ](ie(;eflary but to immerfe

To prepare this liquor^ diflblve Roman alum pul* 
verifed, in two glafs-fulls of very pure water, anA 
when the Water is faturated« decant it from oflF the 
alum, whicfi may have remained undiffolved at the

made according to the fize of the.paintings to be 
fixed, provided care be taken to incrcafe.the ingre- 
dients in the proper proportions ; it is however to 
be obferved, that it muft not be ufed when too old, 
as in that cafe it would weaken the fplendor of 
the painting. 

Put the liquor, thus prepared, into a veffel of 
lead, or of any other fubflance, fo large that the 
painting may be immerfed an it, and heat it in a 
balneum marise,. taking care that the fi(h-glue be 
well diflblve&apos;d ; for before the liquor is heated, ef- 
pecially if the weather be cold, it will depolit itfelf 
at the bottom. Place in each corner of the bafon 
a bit of lead, in fuch a manner, that the liquor 
may rile over it no more than a line at moft, and 
then lay hold of the painting, keeping it in an ho- 
rizontal pofition, and immerfe it gently into the 
liquor. The pieces of lead, placed in the veffel, 
will prevent it from finking too deep. The time 
employed in immerfing and taking out the painting, 
ought not to exceed a fecond. 

The painting muft be taken out horizontally, and 
be depofited in the fame pofition in fome place 
where it can reft on its two borders, which it will 
do if fupported by two chairs. If the above pro- 
cefs be properly followed, it will be found that all 
the tints have retained their original freflinefs and 
primitive colour. Crayons fixed in this manner 
will bear even to be covered with a varniih, which 



may fupply the place of glafs. To lay oii this var« 
liifli, the following method is to be employed. 

When the painting is fixed and dry, apply over 
it, with a foft brufh, a ftratum or two of melted 1 

fi/h-glue, mixed with about a third of fpirit of wine, 
and fufficiently ftrong that when cold it may form ^ 
a fort of jelly. Wh^n this preparation is dry, ap* 
ply that varnifli ufed* for varnifliing prints, which 
will produce the fame tfft&amp;as on paintings in dif- 
temper. 

Crayon paintings fixed in the above mariher ard 
attended with this advantage that they may be re- 
touched ; for the traydns will make an impreflion 
as before t fome ftrengthening touches may even be 
added with colours ih diftemper. This method em« 
ployed for crayons, may be ufed alfo for fixing 
chalk drawings*

To direQ a /warm of ^ees at pleqfurei 

It is well known tliat the femak bee is the queen 
of the hive, and that the fate jof -the whole fwarm 
depends, in fome meafure, upon her alone. The 
dillinguiihing chara£lers of this mother bee are, that 
flie has very Ihort wings : it is difficult for her to 
fly, and therefore flie feldom goes abroad; except 
when fhe quits the hive to form a new colony. Oa 
that occafion, the bees, like faithful fubjefts, follow 
her to whatever place flie may have chofen, and for 
this reafon, if a perfon, can get poffeflion of the 
queen bee, he is fure of being able to dire£l the 
fwarm at his pleafure. In that cafe, nothing is 
neceffary but to confine her by means of a hair, or 
a very fine thread of filk, made gently faft around 
her corflet ; the bees, attentive to all her aftions, 
will furround her, go backwards and forwards, flop 
and feem obedient to the will of him who com- 
mands the mother bee, by merely following th^ 
xpovements of their queen. 

This was the charm, or rather the fecret, by whicb 
Mr. Wildman, who had ftudied the inftinft of bees, 
and whio thus took advantage of their attachment 
for their queen, was able to make a fwdrm pafs from 
one hive to an ::ther at pleafure. Having full confi* 
dence in the fuccefs of his experiments, he pre- 
feiUed himfelf one day to the Society of arts, with 
three fwariijs of bees which be brought along with

and returned to their hives ; hut on blowing hi&amp;whiftle a fecond time, they returned to occupy their

Pound this charcoal in a mortar and reduce it to

Method of reviving old writing. 

It is often neceflary to confult old charters, titles, 
deeds, and manufcripts, written many centuries 
ago, cither to gratify curiofity, or to clear up feme 
important point in law ; but as the writing is feme- 
times fo much effaced as to be fcarcely legible, a 
Benedi3ine invented a liquor, which will make old 
manufcripts appear as frefli as if newly written* 
The procefs for preparing this liquor, which, may- 
be eafily applied, is as follows : 

Having provided a pot, capable of containing 
three quarts of water, take fome white onions, 
fr^ed from the exterior thick (kin, and cut them 
into fmall morfels ; put fuch a quantity of them 
into the pot as to occupy three fourths of it ; then 
£11 up the remaining part with water, and add three 
gall-nuts well pounded. Boil the whole tor an hour 
and a half, and throw into the mixture about the 
fize of a nut of rock alum; Strain the mixture 
through a piece of cloth, fqucezing the onions 
ftrongly to exprefs the juice, and preferve the 
liquor, which, wheacold, will have the appearance 
of orgeat. 

When you intend to ufe this liquor, expofe it to 
heat, whiih will render it clear ;^ then dip in it a 
bit of rag, and apply it to the writing waich you 
wi(h to revive ; if you then hold tlie writing near 
the. fire, that the liquor may make a ftronger im- 



4 



sec^ietS, 293 

preffion, you will haye the pleafure of feeing the 
charafters revived in their full luftre. If there be 
only a few words of the writing effaced, it will be 
fufficient to heat a littlje of the liquor in a filver 
fpoon, and to apply it as above. . 

Another procefs, ftill fimpler, confifts in putting 
three or four pounded gall-nuts into a certain quan- 
tity of fpjrit of wine ; heating the mixture and ex* 
pofing to the vapour of it the writing which you 
^i(h to revive. 

Old papers or parchments, the writing of which 
cannot be read, or can be read only with diflSculty, 
may be immerfed alfo in water in which copperas 
has been diffolved : if tiiey are then fufFered 10 
dry, the copperas will make the writing re-appear 
with as much frelhnefs as if it were new. 

Method of taking off the Imprejfion of any 

Drazving. 

The impreflion of any drawing mjay be taken offi 
by placing a piece of glafs over the original, and 
then tracing out all the outlines with a bit of foft 
ted chalk ; but as red fchalk makes no mark upon 
glafs, it muft firft be rubbed over with gum water, 
to which a little vinegar has been^added : when the 
gum is&apos; dry it will be fit for drawing on. Without 
vinegar, ried chalk would not mark on the gum; 
b\^t if you rub the glals with the white of an egg, 



f 



/-&gt;§94 .AMU5IKG 

inftead of gum, there will be no need of vinegar* 
When the drawing has been traced out on the glafs, 
if you apply to it a piece of moiftened paper, pref- 
iing it ftrongly down, and immediately remove it, 
left it (hould adhere to the glafs, you will find im- 
printed on it the drawrtig made with the red chalk* 
By thefe means, you may obtain an exaft outline of 
any drawing, or print, which you wifli to copy. 
This refemb lance, however, will be reverfed ; and 
for that reafon, to give it the fame appearance as the 
original, it m^ll be re- copied* 

To take off the imprejion of Old Prints. 

Take Venice orWindfor foap, which muft he cut

(lone, or a flat bit of free ftone, or fine fand well 
moiftened. Whatever figures have been drawn on 
this glafs, may be effaced by a wet cloth, in the 
fame manner as from a &quot;flate ; and bf fides this ad*

may be placed below it, which the fcholars ought 
to follow till their hand is properly formed. What

meet with fo much encouragement for his valuable 
diCcoveries, as the inventor of foftic of thofe frivo- 
lous ornaments, which are as changeable as the 
pljafcs of the moon. 

We have long heard of the means invented to 
fecurc people from the fatal effe£ls of fliipwreck.. 
All the European journals have extolled, in the 
mod enthufiaftic firain, the perfon who devoted ht$ 
labour to a matter of fo much utility ; but,.notwith- 
{landing his valuable refearches, his name is now 
feldom repeated. Yet. how many unfortunate vie* 
tims of a treacherous element might be ftill in exiit- 
ence, had they provided themfelves with preferva- 
tives fo eafy to be obtained ? 

The Abbe de la Chapelle, being on the point of 
undertaking a long voyage, employed himfelf * in 
endeavouring to £nd out a method by which the 
feamen might be faved, if by one of thofe unfor« 
tunate events, too common at fea or in rivers, they 
Ihould he obliged to abandon their veffel, and to 
commit themfelves to the waves, in order to attempt 
reaching the fliore by fwimming. 

With this view he invented a kind, of fwimming 
drefs, to which he gave the name oi/caphanietm 
It is a fort of jacket compofed of pieces of cork,&lt;:over6d on each fide with cloth, and failened round

the body by means of leather thongs, which paf)i 
between the thighs and over the (houlders. 

That the body of the fwimmer may be in equili* 
brium with an equal volume of water, a jacket of 
this kind ought to contain about ten pounds of 
cork. &apos; &apos;^ 

The inventor of this, apparatus tried it in the 
Seine during thejbathing feafon. Having put it on» 
he committed himfelf to the moft rapid part of the 
river, where he kept his body in an upright pofture, 
with his head above water, and To much at his eafe, 
that he could make ufe of a bottle and a glafs which 
h« held in his hands. 

The fcaphander, - which may be procured at a 
ijnall expence, is fufceptible of farther improve- 
ment, according to the tafte and ingenuity of thofe 
who may choofe to fuperintend the conftruftion of 
it; Befides the utility of it in cafes of ihipwreck* 
it will enable people to bathe, without danger, in 
places of a lake or river more falutary than at the 
edges, where one is frequently furrounded with 
filthy and difgufting water. 

This happy invention brings to our remembrance 
another, fomewhat fimilar, for the purpofe of tranf* 
porting infantry over rivers, where there are no 
bridges, and which cannot be forded. It confifted 
of a fprt of drefs which fupported the foldier ex- 
ceedingly well in the water. The inventor, whq 

^^as an officer, mside a trial of it himfelf, and having:

Hydrojtatic Balance^ ^ 

This balance is an inftrument invented for the 
purpofe of determining the fpecific gravity of bodies* 
Theconftruftion of it is founded on a theorem of 
Archimedes, which fhews, that a body placed in 
water, lofes as m0K:h of its weight, as is equal to 
Aat of the volume of the liquid difplaced by it ; 
from which it follows, that if we take the weight 
ef the body in water from its weight in air, the dif- 
ference will be the weight of a mafs of water equal 
to that part of the folid which is immerfed. This 
balance therefore is of great utility for determining 
the degrees of every kind of alloy ; the quality and 
richnefs of metals, ores, and minerals,, and the 
|)ropoitions of every mixture whatever^ 

Abfolute gravity is fo peculiar to a body, that it 
IS always the fame, being proportioned to the quan* 
tity of matter it contains ; but the fpecific gravity 
is the ratio of the weight of two bodies, having the 
fame volume. Thus, if a piece of cork weighs the 
hundredth part of a piece of lead of the fame 
iw)lume, we may fay that the fpecific gravity of 
cork is to that of lead as i to loo.^ 

To determine the fpecific gravity of a liquid,.

GRAVITY* J ^2^ 

take a folid body of any form at pleafure, and 
bring it into equilibrium in the air at the arm of the 
hydroftatic balance, in order to afcertain its abfoliit^ 
gravity ; then immerfe it entirely in the liquor, by 
which means the equilibrium will be immediately 
deftroyed ; and what you are obliged to add to re- 
llore it will be exaftly the weight of the volume of 
the liquor difplaced by the immerfed body. If the 
body be a cubic inch, and if after, immer&amp;on it 
has been neceffary to add 4 drams, youmaycoii- 
elude that a cubic inch of the liquor weighs 4 
drams. In experiments of this kind, the greateft 
care muft be taken that the folid and the liquor in 
which it is immerfe*d do not vary in their denfitjr 
during the operation ; for in that cafe the refult 
would not be accurate. It is oi\ the fame principlesL 
that areometers, for determining the dififerent fpecific 
gravities of liquors, are conftrufted. 
f Of the ancient philofophers, Archimedes leemt 
to have made the greateft . prpgrefs in the ftudy of 
hydroflatics. Having obferved one day- while 
bathing, that as he immerfed his body more or lefs» 
it difplaced a greater or lefs volume of water, h« 
was fo ftruck with this phenomenon, though appa*

This ^reat man, according to Vitruvius^ had been 
requefied by that prince to find out the quantity of 
filver contained in a crown of gold which he had&apos; 
ordered to be made ; but in relating this faft, Vitru- 
vius does not tell us the quantity of the gold, nor 
inform us of the reafoning which Archimedes em- 
ployed to difcover the deception of&apos; the goHfmith. 
We may howev^er fuppofe, that the crown weighed 
fio pounds; that when irartierfed in water it-dif-- 
placed 1 3 ; that a maf s of pure gold of fhe fame 
weight as the crown difplaced only 12, and that a 
mafs of filver difplaced 18. From thefe data it will 
be found, by employing the-rule of allegation, the 
principles of which we have already explained, 
that the goldfmith had mixed with the gold of the

Secret Writing by means of Giphers.&apos; 
There are feveral methods of carrying on a 
fecret correfpondence by writing, fo that no perfon 
into whofe hands the letters may fall fhall be able to 
read them. The mo ft ufual, and at xhe fame time 
the eafieft, confifis in employing, inftead of common 
ink, different kinds of liquids, which leave no fen- 
Cble traces on the paper, but which have the pro- 
perty of becoming vifible when expofed to heat, 
when immerfed in water, or when befprinkled with 
fome powder. Refprfting thefe procefles, -we hive 
already fpoken. The other method is that called com- 
monly writing in ciphers. It may be varied almaft 
without end ; and though it cannot be deQionfirated 
that it is impofEhle td decyphcr it, the operation 
* for that purpofe may be rendered fo tedious and 
laborious, as to make it exceedingly difficult. 
&apos; This method in general conGfts in fubftitutlng, 
for the letters of the alphabet, different figns agreed 
upon by the perfons who correfpond. When the 
figns which denote the fame letters afe always inva- 
riably the fame, it is certain that they may be eafily 
dccyphered, efj^ecially if the writing be in a known 
language ;&apos; but When they are changed in flich a 



.manner, tliat the fame may denote dlfFerent letters, 

tnr that the fame letter may be indicated by diiferent 

iigrns, the combinations which muft be made 

* . . &apos; &apos;i* 

in order to afcertain their relation become fo 

difficult, that it is almoft impoflible to difcover theif 

« meaning. 

Thofe who write in cyphers,- have always befyre 

them an alphabet of this kind agreed upon by the 

parties, which enables them to tranfcribe their letters, 

and to write the anfwers. This alphabet is called 

the key ; and it is often fo difficult to be difcovered, 

that it requires long and tedious combiiWtions. The 

.following examples will be fufficient to give an idea* 

of this method of correfponding i a ciphers. ; 

Tk€ MyJUrious ^Dial - Pl^U^ or the Prudent 

Secretary. 

Trace out on a fquare piece of pafte-board a Ibrt 
of dial-plate, accurately divided into twenty-fix 
equal parts, in which you muft infcribe the twenty. 
{bur letters of the alphabet, and the two confonants 
J and V. Over this diaUplate place a circular 
piece of pafte-hoard, made to move on the centre 
of the former, and of fuch a fize, that the lines by 
which the former is divided, being prolonged, Inay 
mark out upon it an equal number of divifions s 
in thefe divifions infcribe alfo the letters of the aU 
phabet ; but it is to be obferved that it is not necef&lt;-

fary to arrange them in their proper order as in the 
former. 

It may readily. ))e conceived that when the movc- 
ible- circle has been placed in fuch a manner, that 
one of its divifions or letters correfponds withone 
of the other, all the reft of the divifions will corref- 
pond alfo. 

When you intend, by means of this inftrument, 
to write a letter in ciphers to a correfpondent, who 
muft be provided with one exaftly fimilar, arrange 
the moveable circle in fuch a manner, that the divi- 
fions of both parts fhall ftand exa31y oppofite to 
.each other ; and that your correfpondent may 
arrange his inftrument in the fame way, write at the 
head of the firft line the letter Of with that corref. 
ponding to it in the oppofite divifion ; for example 
am^ which will enable him to decypher your 
letter. 

Thus, if the moveable circle is difpofed in fuch 
a manner, that w of the firft correfponds to o, and 
^ to r ; inftead of we^ you muft write or, and you 
muft continue in this manner, in regard to the letters 
which compofe all the words you have occafion to 
write. 

The perfon to whom you write will employ the 
index a m^ as already explained, to enable him to

Circle, as they occur in his letter, he will decypher 
it fpeedily, and with great eafe. 

Writing in Ciphers ^ which appeats to be a piece of 

Mufic^ 

This fingular method of writing in ciphers, is the 
fame in principle as that above defcribed : but with 
this diflference, that inftead of letters, the interior, 
circle ought to contain in its divifions mufical 
notes, different from each other both in figure and 
pofition. 

The perfon who writes, muft take care to put at 
the head of his letter fome charafter of the alphabet, 
with the correfponding noce, in order that this rtgn 
may ferve as a key to point out the iiianner in which, 
the two parts of the inftrutn€nt ought to correfpond. 
By thefe means niufical notes may be fubfiituted 
for all the letters of the alphabet, fo as to exprefs 
every thing neceifary to be tranfmitted to your cor« 
refpondent.

This method is tjoth eafy and expeditious : nothing 
is rteceflary but to provide a piece of paper, cut out 
with fquare holes in regular order, according to the 
direftion of the lines, and correfponding to thofeof

Baits for Catching Fijh. 



In order to attrafl fifh when angling, baits madd

approach coloured objefts through curiofity. Some 
people tie a bit of fCirlet rap* to the hook, and rub 
it over with petroleum; and others highly extol 
heron-oil. To ottain the latter, the flcfh of the 
heron is cut fniall, and pounded in a mortar ; it is 
then put into a long rtecked bottle, clofely corked^ 
and preferved for two or three weeks in a warm 
temperature ; the flefh, by putrefying, is converted 
into a fubftance that approaches near to oil, which 
is mixed up with honey, bread and a little mufk^ 
Moil fi{h, and particularly &quot;carp, are faid to be very 
fond of this bait. Artificial infefts are much ufed

obje^ which appear at thefe different periods. 
. Thofe who fifh in frefli water, employ cheefe 
fiMtetimes as a bait, and prefer that which emits the 
ftrongeft fmell. The putrid livers and flelh of 
animals of every kind are likewife ufed. 

Small, long, flender worms, of a white or pale 
yellow colour, with &quot;a red head, contained in fmall 
cells found in the roots of the water iris, are faid to 
be excellent bait for trout, tench, carp, and various 
other kinds. 

Eartk worms, as well as thott engendered in meati 
are of great fervi^e^ 

To procure the latter^ and alinoft at every feafon^ 
a dead cat, or bird of prey, muft be expofed to the 
flies, and when the worms become very livdy it 
ought to be buried in moift earth, as much flieltered 
from the froft as poffible. The worms may be taken 
•out according as they arc wanted. As thefe worms 
are mqtamorphofed into flies towards the month of 
March, recourfe muft then be had to.other animals

countries, that they do much mifchief, particularly 
among the game. 

In the country, efpecially during a fall of fnow, 
the catching of crows may afford excellent amufe- 
mcnt. One method of cJtching them is as follows. 
Scrape nux vomica^ and having rolled fmall morfels 
of flefli in it, fcatter them ahout on the ground : 
the crows, attrafted by the flefh, will devour it, but 
they will foon after become intoxicated, and fall 
down as if dead. They will however recover from 
their intoxication, and if not fpeedily caught mvf 
fly away, 

Nux vomica is a mortal poifon to dogs, which 
cannot be cured but by making them, fwallow 
vinegar. 

As crows are exceedingly voracious, and fond of 
large beans, if a certain quantity of them ftuck 
through with fmall pins and needles be fcattered 
about on the ground, from which the fnow has been 
removed, their inteftines will be fo lacerated by 
them that they will foon die. 

Crows may be caught alfo by putting bits of flefli 
or beans into paper cornets, and then rubbing over 
the edges of the cornets with bird-lime : the cornets 
adhering to the heads of thefe animals ^vill fo Wind- 
them, that when they attempt to fly off&quot;, they will 
fall into the hands of thofe who are waiting to catch 
them. P a

BALLOONS. , 317 

There are two kinds of balloons, and two 
methods of filling them: one is by heating, and 
thereby dilating, the air contained in them ; the 
other is by filling them with inflammable air, which 
is much lighter than atraofpfceric air. 

The firft kind are made of linen, and the fecond 
of filk, done over with gum, when intended for 
experiments on a large fcale ; but if they are def- 
tined merely for amufements, it will be fufficient to 
make the former of paper, and the latter of gold 
beaters leaf: that we may not deviate fron^the ob- 
jeft of this work we ihall here fpeak only of fmaU 
4)alloons. 

Paper Balloons, : 

As it is necelTary that thele balloons fliouU be 
exceedingly light, filk paper, which is very thin, 
and at the fame time not brittle, and which weighs 
no more than a dram^er fourth of a fq^uar^ foot, is 
employed : the leaft fize that can be given to them, 
is four feet in diameter, otherwife they would be&apos; 
fpecifically heavier than the atmofphere, and would 
not rife. In order to give them a fpherical form, 
when feveral flieets of this paper have been cemented 
to the ends of each other, they muft be cut into the 
fhape of a fpindle, like thofe pieces ufed&apos;for cover- 
Vig terreftrial globes. 

When cut into this fliape, join them two and two^

3^8 AIR 

?nd cut off, at one extremity the length of about 
i&apos;2 or 1^ inches ; then cement them all together into 
one fpherical body, and border the aperture with a 
ribbon, leaving the ends, that you may fufpend 
from them the following landp. 

Conflruft a fmall baiket of very fine wire, if the 
balloon is fmall, and lufpend it in the aperture, fo 
that the flame of a few leaves of paper, wrapped 
together and dipp,ed in ol!, may heat the infrde of 
it. Before you kindle the paper, fufgend the baU 
loon in fuch a manner, that it may in a great mea- 
fure be exhaulled of air, and as foon as it ha^ been 
dilated, let it go, together with the wire baftet, 
which will ferve it as ballaft. Balloons of this kind 
will fometimes go the diftance of two or three 
leagues, fupported in the air at a very high elevation, 
as long as the paper continues burning. This amufe- 
ment ought never to be prafiifed when there is reafon 
to apprehend that there are any combuftibles in the 
neighbourhood, which the balloon may fet on fire ; 
though in general fuch balloons do not fail till the 
flame is extinguiQied. * 

Balloons of Gold-beater* s Leaf.&apos; 

Thefe balloons may be made much fmaller than 
thofe of paper, not only becaufe they are much 

* These experiments ought never to be performed when 
corn is on the ground, even though there may be none jj^ 
be neighbourhood, T. 



BALLOONS. ^ 319 

lighter, bulk for bulk ; bur becaufe the inflammable 
air, with which they are filled, has lefs weight than 
air dilated by heat ; yet they ought never to be lefs 
than a foot in diameter. 

The gofd-beater&apos;s leaf ought to be doubled^ and 
when cut into. the proper form, as above, fhould be 
cemented together with fi(h gliie, in fuch&apos; a manner, 
as to leave no other aperture than a.fmall tube for 
introducing the inflammable air. You may eafily dif- 
cover whether the pieces have been clofely cemented, 
by introducing into it atmofpheric air, which will not 
fail to efcape if it finds any vent. Nothing is then 
neceflary but to fill the baUoon with inflammable in- 
Head of atmofpheric air, whic^ is fpecifically heavier 
than the former, in the proportion of 8 to 1 . For this 
purpofe^^you muft employ a large glafs flaflc, which, 
beOdes-&apos;fhe common neck, has one alfo in the fide- 
Adapt to the upper neck a bent tube, the lower end 
of which muft be placed in a bafon of water to cool 
&quot;the gas in its paffage through it. Over the orifice 
of the tiibe place an inverted funnel, and infert the 
tube of it into the orifice of the. balloon. When 
every thing has been thus arranged, introduce into 
the flaik, through the lateral neck, four or five 
drams of the filings of very pure iron, and a fuflS- 
cient quantity of fpirit of vitriol, mixed with one 
third of water. The inflammable air, extricated by 
the effervefcence, will pafs throngh the tube and th«

.320 AIR 

.water into the funnel, by which means it will be 
conveyed into the balloon, and, being much lighter 
than atmofpheric air, will gradually expel the latter 
from it, and affume its place : the balloon will thus 
become fufiiciently light to rife fpontaneoufly into 
tbc-atmofphere. 

The apparatus above defcribed, is fufficient for 
filling balloons i2 or 15 inches in diameter; but. if 
they are large, like thofe of Blanchard or Pilatre-de- 
Rozicr,&amp;c, the apparatus muft be of a proportion- 
able frae. 

As the form of balloons is a matter of indifference, 
provided the air they contain, added to the weight 
of the fubilance whicfi confines it, be lighter than 
an equal volume of atmofpheric air, they may be 
made to reprefent Sying dragons, winged horfes,&amp;c. But in thefe cafes, the .amufement th^y afford 
is of ihort duration, as they foon get out of fight : 
to render this amufement agreeable, they ought to 
maintain themfelves at fuch a moderate elevation , 
that they can be eafily diftinguiflied. « 

To colleB the Injlammable Air of the MarJIies, 

Take a common bottle full of water well corked, 
end haviog niziic a rpund hole in the cork, introduce 
into it the tube of a glafs funnel, feven or eight 
inches in diameter, in fuch a manner, that the water 
in the bottle can iffue from it only through that tube«L 
Invert the bottle in the ftagnaut w^er, which covers&lt;\ 

%Mae tnarfli, and A^r the mud round tb^ funnel by 
means of a-fliarp poifilted Stick, or rod of iron : in- 
flammable air, havingtbe fame qualities as that above 
fneationed, will then rife iato the bottle. 



THE MAGNET. 

The magnet is a metallic done, generally of a 
greytfh or a blacki(h colour, t:ompa£):, an4 exceeds 
ingly ponderous, which is found for the noft 
part in iron mines. It aiFefis no peculiar form, and 
externally has nothing that diflinguiihes it from the 
meanefi pit&gt;du6lions of the bowels of the earth. 
But its property of attrafling.or. repelling iron, and 
pf pointing to the north, when at freedom, to move&gt;gives it a diftinguiflung rank among the (nofl fingular 
pbje3t of^ nature. 

This done, ftri£lly fpeaking, is only a fort of 
iron ore, but belonging to that clafs called popr^^ 
^ecaufe it contains but &apos;^ fmall quantity of n*etaL 
Me^alluiigifts have indeed been able to extra£l iron 
from it; hut, befides its being difficult of fufion, 
the metal is ii\ fuch fmall quantity, that i^ woul^ 
l»t pay foi the labour of working it; 

P5 



&quot;rr&apos;^^T-^iill^ 



Why then is not every kind of iron ore magnetic ? 
This is a queftion which, in my opinion, has never 
yet been anfwercd* The reafon of this, no douht^ 
is fome peculiar combination of the iron with cer- 
tain heterogeneous bodies. It is not improbable that 
it may contain fome principle, which does not enter 
into the compofition of the oAer ores of that metal ; 
but it is nor impojible&apos;that chemiftry may one day 
difcover in what the combination confifts. 

The firft difcovery of the fecrets of nature does 
not always unveil all their wonders. In general, 
we are able to penetrate into caufes and efFefls only 
by deep refcarch, and repeated experiments. Such 
))as &apos;been the cafe with the magnet : only one qua. 
lity, that of attrafling iron, was at firft obferved in 
it ; and it was not till towards the i4th century that 
its other properties, and particularly that of turning 
towards the poles, and of communicating its virtue

one of the moft important of modern times, gave 
rife to the invention of the mariners compafs, 
without which it would have been impoffible tq 
undertake long fea voyages. 

But the magnet, like many other extraordinary 
things, has given rife to ridiculous tales and fables 
filled with falfehoods and abfurditics^ We aretoJd, 
for example, that Mahomet&apos;s coffin, faid to be of 
iron, is fufpendfed in the air by the attraftive virtue

Who have been at Mecca and Medina, is founded on 
what Pliny relates of the architeft Dinocrates, who 
propofed conftrufting at Alexandria a temple arched 
with magnets ; in order that he might fufpend from 
them the tomb of Arfinoe, the fifter of Ptolomy, 
whom that prince wifhed by thefe means to immor- 
talife; the death of Ptolemy, and that of Dino* 
crates, prevented the execution of this chimerical 
projeft. 

Among thefe fables ought to be clafled what is 
related by Serapion, who pretends that the magnets 
found in great abundance in the bowels of the earth, 
ftojfi veffels in full fail, and attra£l the nails with 
which they are conftrufted, fo as to make theta 
drop out. 

Various authors have afcribed to it, virtues ftill 
more marvellous, by pretending that it has the power 
to expel demons ; and it is not long fince fome en- 
thufiafts maintained tfiat the magnetic fluid, the 
nature of which will perhaps never be known, is 
able to cure different maladies. 

Famianus Strada however advances a ftlll greater 
abfurdity, when he tdh us, that by the virtue of 
this mineral, it is poffible to correfpond with our 
friends, even when at a great diftance. This rifi* 
culous fi6);ion, revived a few years ago, is indeed 
founded on fo&quot;^e probability ; for we are taught by 
experience, that by means of a magnet two friend*,

.i &apos; even when feparatcd by a ^partition half, a .foot 

thick ; but this. is irapoffible at a greater diflance, or 
beyond the fphere of the magnetic attraftion. 

It is certain that the magnet has long been em- 
ployed in various amufements, more or lefs agree- 
able, and which to fome have appeared to border on 
the marvellous. As a proof of this, we (hall men- 
lion a faft related by St. Auguftine, who tell us, 
that being one day at the houfe of a bij(hop, named 
Severus, he faw him take a magnet, and hold it 
below a filver plate^ containing a bit of iron, which 
exaQly followed sj) the movements of the hand that 
held the magnet, and put it into motion : he then 
adds, that at the time he was writing, he had before 
him a vcjflel filled with water, placed on a table^ 
and that a, needle fufpended on the water moved 
from one fide to the other, according \o themotioj^ 
5 wliich he gave to a magnet under the tabj,e. 

We are informed by Baptifla Porta in his Magi0 
naturalise that fome jugglers of his time took ad-, 
vantage of thi$ property of the magnet to impofe on 
the credulity of the populace, by having a bafon 
inCcribed round the edge with different Words, whicji 
i^arwtA as anfwers to quellions propofed to th^ra bj^

and are the refult of a difibrem application of tlie 
fame principles. 

DircSion of the Magnet. 

A magnet, or magnetic needle, fufpended freely 
on a pivot, always dire£ls one of its ends towards 
the north, and the other towards the fouth. The 
magnetic matter which, according to the opinion of 
. vaiious philofophers, flows without intermiflion 
from the one pole of the earth to the othej*, gives 
this direftion to the magnc, or magnetic needle. 
Huygens accounts for it, by confidei ing the fmall 
particles of the magnetic matter as fo many fmall 
dartSy and the pores of the magnet compofed of a 
multitude of fmall tubes, the interior furface of 
which is furnifted with inclined flexible parts, 
always ready to rife up and oppofethe return oi the 
magnetic matter. 

Magnetic Attra&amp;ion. 

If the north pole of a magnet, or magnetic har of 
iron, be prefented to the fouth pole of a magnetic 
needle, the needle will be attra&amp;ed, and join itfelf 
to the magnet. The magnetic fluid, which iffucs 
with great velocity from one pole of each cf thefe 
bodies, finds freeingrefs into that of the other. . 
&apos; On the other hand, if the fouth pole of a magnet 
be prefented to the fame pole of a magnetic needle, 
the latter recedes, turns round, and becomes agi- 



ON MAGNBTS. 327 

tated, until it prefents to it the north pole. The fame 
thirig takes place when the north pole of the magnet 
is prefented to the fame pole of the needle : it re- 
cedes, in like manner, and at la ft prefents to it the 
fouth pole. Thus the poles diftinguiflied by diffe- 
rent names, attra3 each other, and thofe of the fame 
name repel each other : the former are called friendly 
poles; the other hoflile poles. Thefe effefts cai^ 
neither be prevented nor even dimini{hed by the 
interpofition of any body, except iron. 

Communication of the Magnetic Virtue* 

If a needle, or a thin plate of well tempered fteef, 
be drawn gently over the north or. fouth pole of an 
armed magnet, or magnetic bar of iron, moving it&apos; 
from the one end to the other, always in the fame 
dire3ion ; this needle or plate will alfo become a 
magnet, having poles, and the fame virtue as the 
magnet itfelf. 

If the needle be afterwards moved in a contrary&lt;Hre£lion, bver, the fame pole of the magnet ; it will 
immediately lofe its virtue ; but if you continue to 
move it in the fame dircflion, it will refume its vir- 
tue, with this difference, that the fouth pole becomes 
the north pole, and the north one the fouth. 
* Needles, or plates of fteel, rendered magnetic by 
the above procefs,* will retain their virtue for feveral 
years, though it gradually decreafes ; but this de-&gt;preafe is often ^ccafipned by ncglefting to keep

them always in the direAion of the ma^netM? .flui(^ 
which proceeds f/om oi^e pole to the other, or by 
their acquiring ruft,, which lefTens their magnetic 
laroperty : it may, however, be reftorefl by poliihingi 
juxd again fubjefling them to the fame operation. 

DectintUion of the Magnetic Ncedk. 

• We have already (hewn, that a magnetic needJe, 
freely fufpended, alwajs direfls itfelf towards the 
poles ; but this direction varies feveral degrees, and 
this variation is called the needless dech&apos;nation. 

The declination is not the fame in every part of 
the globe ; and it even varies at different times in 
the fame place ; fometfmes it is eaft, and fometimes 
weft. The cat.fe of this variation has ntvtt yet been 
difcovered, and it would be ufelefs to enlarge on it 
here, as it has no relation with philofophical amufe- 
ments, the fingul.»rity of which depends 0»ly M 
tbeunagnetic virtue. 

Inclination of the Magnetic Needle. 

The inclination of the needle* Is the tendency i| 
has, when fufpended, to deprefs itfelf ^Qwards the 
poles. A fteel rod fufpended on an axis, in the 
fame manner as a balance,, and brought into perfieft 
equilibrium before the magnetic virtue is commuai* 
cated to it, does not preferve that equiUhriura after 
it has been rendered magnetic. It feems th^ep t9 b^ 






ON MACNETSi 329 

riiore ponderous on the fide towards the nearefl; pole^ 
and it inclines towards it in proportion as the lati^ 
tude increafes ; at London, for example, it incline* 
about 60 degrees towards the north ; if the fam« 
needle were removed to the equator it would be 
in equilibrium, and placed beyond it it would in- 
rline towards the fouth. 

The fame effeft takes place when a needle is held 
lufpended in a firnilar manner above, or is placed 
by the fide of a magnetic bar of iron : if it be placed 
towards the middle, or what reprefents the equator 
of the bar, it will remain in a horizontal pofition 
parallel to the bar ; and it inclines or approaches itt 
more and more, according as it is removed from 
that place, and advanced towards either of the poles 
of the magne^c bar.;.fo that if the bar be much 
longer than .the needle,, when &apos;the extremity of the 
needle comes near that of the bar, it will place 
itfelf in a vertical dire6Uon, that is to fay, perpen» 
dicular to the bar. It muft here be obferved, that ia 
this experiment, the axis muft pafs through the 
needle in a horizontal direftion, when it is placed 
above the bar, in order that by thefe means it may 
have full liberty to incline itfelf. 

On*the Choice of Magnets* 

Thebeft, and moft valuable magnets, are thofe 
which, being of equal fize, are capable, after they 
have been armed, of raifing the greateft \^eight :

the difference between them is fo great, that the at- 
traftive force of (bme is a hundred times as great as 
that of others. It is very common to find mag- 
nets which, when -armed, can raife five or fix times 
their weight: but their llrength is rarely increafed 
fo much as to be able to raife a hundred times 
their weight. 

Whatever ftrength thefe armed magnets may have, 
they are fcarcely of any ufe for communicating the 
magnetic virtue. Bars of iron or artificial magnets, 
communicate the magnetic virtue much better, and 
by their help a very great number of bars of fteei 
may be rendered magnetic, which could not eafilf 
be done by the heft magnet. For the method oi 
communicating the magnetic virtue to bars of every 
fize, we are indebted to Mr. Knight, who made 
known his procefs to the Royal Society.

the two extremities be filed exaftly fquare. After 
they have \&gt;ttn thus prepared, bring them to a red 
heat throughout in the fire, and then temper them,

fame time, every nQceffary precaution to prevent 
them from being bent. v • 

When thefe bars are well tempered, they muft be 
again polifhed by means of a grindftone, and by 
applying them afterwards to a ftone of a fofter 
nature. 

Before they are tempered, care muft be taken to 
mark, by a notch with a file, that fide of the bar 
^ dellined to become the » north, in order that there 
may be no miftake when they are magnetifed. 

When this operation is finifhed, join the twelve 
bars together, by means of two rings of copper, 
taking care- to feparate them by a fmall wooden 
rule, and to place fix on the one fide of it, and fix 
on the other, in fuch a manner, that their extremis 
ties may be in alternate order, that is to fay, a north 
and a fouth.always placed together. 

When they are thus arranged, and well fattened 
together by means of the copper rings, poliih them 
again by a cutler&apos;s wheel and emery. Then mark 
the order in which they are arranged, that you may 
be able to place them in the fame manner when they 
are magnetifed ;. and it is of eflential importance 
that the ends of none of them proje£l beyond the 
Other. 

Caufe to be made alfo two plates of foft iron, of 
the fame breadth as the bundle of bars, which may 
cover all their extremities, and let them be half an 
inch in thicknefs ; Thefe plates will adhere llrongly

to the magnetic bars, and contribute to preferve 
their virtue longer. To one of thefe plates may be 
affixed a hook, for the purpofe of fufpending from 
It fome weight, which, will tend to&apos;increafe ih 
magnetic force, provided the burthen it has to fup- 
port does not gradually increafe as the force b 
augmented. 

Remove the rings which keep the bars together, 
and arrange them end to end, fix of them at a time 
in the fame line, and in fuch a manner that fimilar 
poles may ifot correspond ; then draw a good artu 
ficial magnet along the whole line, obfcrving that 
the fide of the magnet which ought firft to pafs 
over it muft be of tlie fame, name as the pole cor« 
refponding with the extremity of the line ; that i^ 
to fay, if the fouth pole, for example, firit prefents 
itfelf, the fouth pole of the magnet muft be the firft 
drawn over the bars. 

When the artificial magnet has been drawn ovef 
them ten or twelve times, backwards and forwards 
alternately, the fame operation&apos; muft be performed 
on the other fide of them. 

Then take one of thefe bars, and try to fufpend 
.from one of its extremities another of them, by pre* 
fenting their contrary poles to each other ; if one of 
ijbem raifes another, and the latter a third, they are 
fufficiently Qiagnetifed; and by forming them into 
a bundle, they may be employed for communicating 
iQ^^netic virtue to the other fix«.

As the latter fix will have more ftrength thaa 
the former, they ought to be ufed for magnetifing 
the former . a fecond time ; if, notwithftanding this 
precaution, you find that, they continue weaker, it 
will be of no avail to endeavour to magnetife them 
farther^ as the defi&lt;:iency muft be owing either to 
the quality of the fleeli or to fpme fault in the 
temper* 

When you are well aflured that the bars have 
been fufEciently magnetifed^ they muft be bound 
clofely together in a bundle as before, and armed 
with their platel above mentioned* 

Such magnets are fufiicient for communicating 
the magnetic virtue to bars of eight or ten inthes * 
m length ; but for bars of eighteen or twenty inchesi 
the bundle employed ought to confift of a greater • 
number* 

It is to be obferVed, ifl. That wh^n a bundle is . 
formed, there muft always be an even number of 
bars, divided into two equal portions by a flip of &apos; 
Wood, two lines in thicknefs* 2ndj That thebar^ 
on the one fide muft lie in a contrary dire&amp;ion to 
thofe on the other ; that is to fay,, if the one have 
always their fouth poles turned upwards, the others 
muft haVe theirs turned downwards. ,

Bar of Steel, without the htlp of a natural or gjt 
nrtifieial magnet* 



\ 






^34 AMUSEMENTS 

Provide a plate of untempered fteel, about three 
inches in length, three or four lines in breadth, and 
half a line in tliicknefs. Then take a fliovel and a 
puif of tongs* (the more they have been ufed, and 
the larger they are, fo much the better) ; hold the 
fliovel vertically between your two knees, aifd fix 
in it the plate of fteel in fuch a manner, that the ex* 
tremity deftined for the north pole may be turned 
downwards : in order that it may not be difplaced, 
it will be proper to* tie it to the fliovel with a filk 
firing. Then take the tongs, and, holding them 
nearly in a vertical direftion, rub the plate with their 
extremities, proceeding always from the bottom up- 
wards. When this operation has been performed 
twelve or fifteen times, on both fides of the plate, 
it will have acquired fufficient magnetic virtue to 
raife fmall nails by its lower extremity. This dif- 
covery was made by Mr. Canton. 

It may be readily conceived that when fix or eight 
plates have been magnetifed, they may be formed 
into a fmall bundle, for communicating the magnetic 
virtue to larger xm^s, which may be employed ta 
give the like property to others of ftill greater fize. 

How to Lifcovtr the Poles of a Magnet. 

If a magnet he held horizontally over a piece o{

two places almoft diametrically oppofite to each 
other, where the filings are more crowded, and 
where the fmall oblong fragments ftarid on their 
ends, as it were, while in every other part they lie 
on their fides. 

This experiment will enable you to difcover the 
poles of the magnet. Every magnet indeed has two 
poles, or two oppofite points, which, as we fliall 
fhew hereafter, poffefs difierent and peculiar pro- 
perties. One. of thefe points is called the north 
pole, and the other the fouth ; becaufe, if the mag- 
net be freely fufpended, the former \yill turn of 
itfelf towards the north, and the other confequently 
will point towards the fouth. Thefe points mull be 
afcertained in a magnet, before any experiments ar^ 
made with if. 

The produBio7i of New Poles in a Magnet^ and one 
Pole Changed into Another. 

If a. magaet, or a magnetic bar, be cut through 
in a dire6lipn perpendicular to its axis ; that part of 
it towards; the north pole of the magnet, or bar, 
will acquire a fouth j)ole, arid the other will acquire 
a north pole. . . 

, The poles may eafily be changed by the following 
experiments. If you prefent to a needle, freely

. • Tteee circumftiinces occurred to excite the afto- 
nilhment of the fpe6lators, who were attra£led in 
great numbers by the celebrity of this animal, ift. 
He continued to give pertinent and proper anfwers&gt;even when his mailer retired from the exhibition- 
#Qom» or defircd all thofe to retire who were fuf- 
pe£led of making figns to the dog to indicate the 
anfwer. 2nd, He returned anfwers equally proper 
when blindfolded, to prevent him from obferving

lingular paradoxes : At firft no perfon in company 
agreed with him in opinion, yet after a variety of 
objeBions, anfwers and replies, he was always aU 
lowed in the end to be right. 

To prove that the epithet given to this learned 
animal, was not altogether misapplied, we (hall herd 
relate a kind of converfation which took place be*

in company.

had interrogated him, he replied, that the Pontui 
Buxinus had no arches, and he exprefled this very 
clearly by placing his foot on a cypher* The 
fiilor then faid that the preceding year he had made 
a very happy voyage, in fix weeks, from the Pontus 
£uxinus to London-bridge. The fpaniel, finding 
nothing very wonderful in fuch a voyage, placed 
his foot on different letters, forming a very laconic 
anfwer, which fignified, when explained by hh 
mailer, that fome navigators had made a voyag^of 
600 leagues in half a d^. ** That- is impoffible,&quot; 
faid the failor, &quot; no air balloon has ever yet been 
able to traverfe fuch a fpace in fo&amp;ort a time.&quot; 
•• I do not fay,&quot; returned the fpanilel, by the help 
of his interpreter, &quot; that an air balloon Wad em- 
ployed for that purpofe: I fpeak of a voyage by

The failor then faid^ that by fea it was ftill hoft 
impi&apos;flible, becaufe as the faftefl failing veflel wettt 
at the rate of no more than about five leagues per 
hour, it could never make a voyage of 600 league 
in half « d&amp;y. 

The animal pcrfifted in maintaining its affcrtion, 
and the failor was goi:^g to lay a confiderable bet, 
&quot;when the fpaniel and his maAer added, that they 
had performed this voyage in a country where they 
had kindled fire with ice.

addrefling the animal, faid ; &apos;* Tell us, my friend, 
•is it not true that a fire can be kindled with a piece 
of ice, if it be cut into the form of a lens, fo as to

Animal, which was blindfolded, nodded with his 
head, to (ay yes ; as if he had fully comprehended 
the queftion prc^ofed to him. 

*• The dog, on this point, is right&quot; faid the fax-

not,&apos;* replied the dog by the mouth of his mafter« 
•* if it be in a country where in half a day there ar^e 
360 hours.&quot; *&apos; In what climate,&quot; faid the failor, 
much furprifed, and beginning to perceive the 
truth of his reply. The fpaniel mentioned the 
frigid zone. &quot; In that zone,&quot; faid bis mafter, ** the 
days indeed are of different lengths, from 24 hourft 
lo fix months. If Captain Cook,&quot; added he, ** when 
he failed beyond the polar circle baH followed a 
parallel, where die day was only a month long, he 
might, in half a day confiding of 360 hours, have 
traverfed the fpace of 600 leagues.&quot; 

The faiior being defirOus to difficult the fpaniel

plied, that it was at the pole ; adding, that in the 
fame place the fun was always on the meridian, be- 
caufe every point of the horizon was fouth to the 
inhabitants, if any, at the pole. 

A lawyer, who was prefent, difputed a long time 
againil the fpaniel, becaufe the latter pretended that 
a man who died at noon, might fometimes be the 
iieir of another, who died the fame day at half aa 
liour after twelve. Though various laws were 
quoted from the Digefia and the Juftinian code, 
Vhich declare that the heir muft fiirvive the teftator, 
the fpaniel proved that the aCFertion was perfeftly 
agreeable to thefe laws ; hecaufe the perfon who 
died at noon might, in certain circumftances, have 
furvived him who died at half after twelve : this 
would be the cafe if the firft died at London, and 
the other at Vienna.

made to move undej his feet by means of ropes, 
indicated to^him the cxaft moment when he ouscht

inativeor negative anfwer by the motion of his head, 
according as his matter or any confederate altered the

jl* COOLING &apos;OT 



THE COOLING OF LIQUORS. 

« 

In warm countries, fuch as India, Perfla, and 
other parts of Afia, it is ncceJTary, on account of 
the great heat, to dcvife means for cooling thofe 
liquors ufed as beverage. Of all the methods 
hitherto employed, the moft natural is, to furround 
the veflels containing the liquor with ice ; but as it 
is often impoflible to procure it, the veflel with^thc 
liquor to be cooled may be hnmerfed in water, in 
which fonfie fal ammoniac has been diflblved : as 
this fait, of all thofe foluble in water, is that which 
cools it moft, it is exceedingly proper for cooling 
any kind of liquor ufed for drinking. 

As the deamefs of this fait, however, may often 
prevent it from being employed, recourfe may be 
bad. to the Indian method, which confifls merely 
in wrapping wet cloths round the bottles containing 
,the liquor ; expofing them to a current of air, and 
moiftening the cloths as they become dry. This 
procefs ^ill render the liquor fuflSciently cool to 
moderate the ftifling heat which we fometimes ex* 
perience in our own climates. 

This curious phenomenon is produced by the 
evaporation of the water with which the cloths are 
moiftened; the more evaporable therefore liquors

are, the mort cold they produce. Water inclofed 
ia the bulb of a fmall thermometer, ,may be con* 
gealed by wrapping round it a rag dipped in.etber^ 
the evaporation of which will be accelerated if it be 
^itated in a circular manner. 

According to Chardin, there are fome cities in 
Perfia and Egypt, where the chief branch of trade 
confifts in the fale of veflels ^ made of a kind of 
porous earth, which promote the evaporation of a 
fmall quantity of water contained in them, and main- 
tain coolnefs by means of the conftant moifture 
which prevails on their exterior furface. Travellers, 
by meians -of thefe vefTels, are always enabled to 
have the pleafure of drinking cool water. 

By obferving wh^t fubftances, when mixed with 
ice, produce the gr^ateft degree of cold, it has been 
found poflible to freeee mercury. This experiment 
•proves what before was only fufps^led, tjiat mer- 
cury is a metal folid by its nature, but fufible at fp 
Jow a temperature, th^t it always h^ ja fiiflfiqient 
.^gree of heat to remain in a ftate. of fufion.

ASTRONOMICAL PARADOXES, 



The heavenly bodies are never feen in the place 
.where they really are : for example, the whole face 
of the fun is fecn above the horizon after he M 
fet. 

Though this has the appearance of a paradox it is 
a truth acknowledged by all aftronomers, and which 
philofophers explain in the following manner : 

The earth is furrounded by a fluid, to which we&apos; 
give the name of atmofphere. As the light by 
which we fee the heavenly bodies, does not reach 
our eye but by continually paffing from a rarer into 
a denfer medium, it muft neceflarily come to us 
in a curved line. But as the apparent place of the 
objefts will be to us in the prolongation of a tan«

gent to this curv^, w^e muft therefore fee them- 
nearer the zenith than they really are ; and this dif- 
ference, between the real and the apparent place, 
will be greater the nearer the body is to the horizon, 
becaufe the rays then pafs through a greater fpace of 
the atmofphere. 

Aftronortiers have found, that when the body is 
on the horizon, this refraftion is about 33 minutes j 
therefore when the upper limb of the fun is in the 
horizontal line, fo that if there were no atmoCi 
phere he would feem only beginning to peep over 
the horizon, he appears to be elevated 33 minutes^ 
and as the apparent diameter of the fun is lefs than 
33 minutes, his lower limb will appear to touch the 
horizon. Thus the fun is rifen in appearance, 
though he is not really fo, and even when he is efin 
tirely below the horizon. Hence follow feyeral 
curious confequences, which it is proper to be re- 
marked. 

ift. More than one half of the celeftial fphere is 
always feen, though, in every treatife on the globes, 
it is fuppofed that we fee only the half ; for, bcndcs 
the upper hemifphere, we fee alfo a band round the 
horizon of about 33 minutes in breadth,- which 
belongs to the tower hemifphere. 

2d. The days are every where longer, and the 
nights (horter, than they ought to be, according 
to the latitude of the place ; for the apparent rifing

«f the fiin precedes the real riftng, aad the apparent 
fettiiig follows the real fetting ; therefore though 
the quantity of day and night ought to be equally 
balanced at the end of the year, the former exceeds 
the latter in a confiderable degree. 

3d. The effe£l of refra£lion» above defcribed^ 
ferves alfo.to account for another aftronomical para- 
dox, which is as follows : 

The moon may be feen eclipfed even totally and 
centrally, when the fun is above the horizon. 

A total and central eclipfe of the mooo cannot 
take place, but when the fun and moon are dirtily 
cppofite to each other. We.here fuppofe that the 
reader is acquainted with the caufes of thefe pheno- 
mena, an explanation of which may be found in 
every elementary work on aftrononiy. When the 
centre therefore of the moon, totally eclipfed, js in 
the rational horizon, the centre of the fun ought to 
be in the oppofite point ; but by the effeft of re- 
fraSJon thefe points are raifed 33 minutes ^bove. the 
horizon. The apparent fcmi- diameter of the fua 
and moon, being only about 15 minutes, the lower 
limbs of both will appear elevated about j8 
minutes. 

Such is the explanation of a phenomenon which 
muft ts^ke plaic at every central eclipfe of the 
moon ; for there is always Ibme place on the earth 
where the mooo is on the horizon at the middle gf 
the eclipfe. 



PARADOXES* 347 

4th. Refradion enables us to explain ajfo a very 
common phenomenon, viz, the apparent elliptic 
form of the fun and moo^ when on the. horizon ; 
for the lower limb of the fun correfponding, we 
Ihall fuppofe with the rational hprizon, is elevated 
23 minutes by the efFcft of refraftion; but the 
upper limb being really elevated 3P minutes -this 
being nearly the apparent diameter of that lumipary 
at its -mean diftancesj is elevated in appearance by 
refraSion no^ more than 28 minutes above its real 
. altitude ; the vertical diameter, therefore, will ap- 
pear (hortened by the difference between 33 and 28, 
that is. to fay 5 minutes; for if the refraftion of 
. the upper limb were equal to that of the lower, the 
vertical diameter would be neither lengthened nor 
fhortened. The apparent vertical diameter will thua 
be reduced to 28 minutes. But there ought to be 
no fenflble decreafe in. ihe horizontal diameter, for 
the extremities of this diameter are carried only a 
little higher in the two vertical circles pafling 
througb them, and which, as they meet only in the 
zenith, are fenfibly parallel. The vertical diameter 
then being contra£led, while the. horizontal dia- 
meter remains the fame, the refult muft be, that 
the diflcs of the fun and moon will apparently 
have an elliptical -form.

earth, enlightened by a centrarUlumination, that is

to fay, by an illumination the centre of which is 
vifible; for if there were no refraftion,. the centre 
of the fun would not be feen till it corre/ponded 
with the plane of the rational horizon ; but as the 
jrefraflion raifes it about 33 minutes, it will begin 
to appear when it is in the plane of a circle parallel 
lo the rational horizon and 33 minutes below it. 

There is therefore a central illumination for the 
whole hemifphere, plus the zone comprehended 
between that hemifphere and a parallel diflant from 
^t 33 niinutes ; and there is a complete illumination 
from the whole di(k of the fun to thefame hemif- 
phere, and the zone comprehended between the 
border of it ajid a parallel about 18 minutes belo;^ 
the horizon.

Animal Magnetifm, which Mefmer and his dupes 
found means to bring into fome credit, exifts no 
longer but in the imagination of a few quacks, firice 
a learned commiflion applied the torch of reafon 
and accurate invefligation to its pretended wonders. 

ExtraB from the Report of the Commijjioners ap* 
pointed by Louis XVL to examine Animal 
Magnetifm. 

On the 12th of March 1784, this prince appointed 
Meffrs. Borie, Lallin, Darcet, and Guillotin, mem- 
bers of the faculty of Paris, to examine the animal 
magnetifm, praftifed by M* Deflon, and to give in 
a report to him on the fubjeCl ; and in confequence 
of a requeft made by thefe phyficians, his Majefty 
appointed five members of the Academy oF Sciences, 
Meffrs. franklin, Leroi, Bailly, de Bory, and La- 
voifier, to afiift them in this&quot; examination. &apos;As M, 
^ory died when the cominiffioners begab their 



.^$&gt;AKXMAt 

labours, his Majcfty made choice of M. MajSaoik^ 
member of (he faculty pf. medicine, to^fucceed 
him. 

Explanation of the DoQrine of Animal Uagnetijm. 

The agent which M. Mefmer pretends to have 
difcovered, and .which he has made known under 
the name of animal magneiifm, is a .ftuid diffufed 
throughout the whole uni vei fe ; it is the means of 
a mutual influence between the celeftial bodies, the 
&apos;earth and animated beings ; it is continued in fuch 
a manner as to leave no vacuum ; its fubtkty is be- 
yond all compariixm; it is capable of receiving, 
propagating and communicating all the impreflions 
of motion, and is fufctptible of a &apos;flux and reflux. 
Animal bodies experience the efFefts of this agent, 
and it is by infinuating itfelf in o the fubftance* of 
the nerves that it immediately affefts them. The 
human body, in particular, polTe/Tcs properties 
analogous to thofe of the magnet, and it has alfo 
its diflFerent and oppofite poles. 

The aftion and virtue of animal magnetifm may 
be communicated from one body to other bodies, ^ 
either animate or inanimate, and even at a confider- ! 

ftble diftance, without the aid of any intermediate 1 

hoAy ; it is increafed and reflefted by glafs ; it is 
tcommunicated and propagated by found ; in a word, 
this virtue may be accumulated,&apos; concentrated, and 
fC»iiimti^» Though the fluid be univerfal, ^U 



MACKETISM. B5.i 

animated bodies are not equally fufcepttblfc of it ; 
there are fo^ie even, though few in number, of a 
nature fo hoftile to it, that their jirelence alone de« 
Aroys all the effe6l$ of it in other bodies. 

Animal magnetifm can cure immediately all di£&gt;cafes of the nerves, and others it cures mediately.; 

it ftrengthens the afiiqn of m^dic^ines, andjt excite 

,and dire3s falutary cures in fuch a manner, that they 

-may be overcome. By its means, the phyficiap 

can afcertain each individual&apos;s flate of health, and 

can fpeak with certainty refpefiing the origin, 

rtiature, and progrefs of the moft complicated dif* 

.esries ; he can prevent their increafe, and be able to 

cure them without ever expofing the patient to d^aa- 

gerous efie£ls, or difagreeable confequences, wliat* 

ever be the ^ge, the temperature, or the fex. In 

animal magnetifm, nature prefents an univer&amp;l 

-tnedium for curing and preferviqg mankind. 

Such is the agent which, the commifliooers were 
charged to examine, and fuch the properties war- 
ranted by M. Deflon. This phyficiw, when he 
explained to the commiffioners the .do£lrine and 
nature of animal magnetifm, taught them alfo the 
pfafiife, and made them acquainted with the poles, 
by (hewing them the method of touching the pa- 
tients, and of conveying to them the joii^etic 
iluld.

Defcriphon of the Treatment* 

After having procured information refpefting the 
theory and praBice of animal magnetifm, it was 
neceflary to fee its effefts : for this purpofe, the 
commiflioners attended, and each of them feversrf 
times, to obferve the manner in which M. Deflon 
treated his patients. In the middle of a large haH 
* they faw. a circular box made of oak, raifed to the 
height of a foot, or a foot and a half, which was 
called the tub; the upper part of this box was 
pierced with a great number of holes, from which 
proceeded iron branches, having moveable dbows. 
The patients were placed in rows around this tufc, 
each oppofite to one of the iron branches, which by 
means of the elbow could be applied direftly to the 
difeafed part. They were all united to each other 
by a rope that vf^nt round their bodies ; and fomc- 
times they formed a fecond chain, by laying hold of 
each others hands: that is to fay, by each applying 
the thumb&apos; between the thumb and fore- finger of the 
next perfon.&apos; 

In a comer of the h^U ftood a piano- forte, on 
which various airs were played in diflFerent time ; 
and thefe airs were fometimes accompanied with th6 
voice and finging. 

All the magnetifed perfons held in one of their 
hands an iron rod, about ten or twelve inches io 
length. 



M. Deflon declared to the commiflioners, ift* 
That this rod was the conduftor of tnagnetifm ; 
that it poiTefled the property of concentrating it at 
its point, and of rendering its emanations more 
powerful. 2d, That found, according to the prin- 
ciples of Mefmer, was alfo a condu£lor of mag* 
netifm : and to communicate the fluid to the piano- 
forte, nothing was neceffary but to bring the iron 
rod near it ; thofe who touched the inftruraent fur» 
niflied it alfo, and the magnetifm was tranfmitted by 
the founds to the furrounding patients. 3d, The 
rope which went round the patients, as well as the 
joining of hands, was deftined to increafe the efie^s 
by communication. 4th, The infide of the tub was 
Conftru6led in fuch a manner, as to concentrate the 
magnetifm ; it was a large refervoir, from which it 
was propagated by means of the iron branches fixed 
in it. 

Method of Executing and Dire3ing the Magnetifm^ 

The patients arranged in great numbers, antl in 
feveral rows, around the tub, received the magnetifm 
at the fame time by all thefe means : by the irod 
branches which tranfmitted to them the magnetifm in 
the tub ; by the rope twifted round their bodies ; 
by the joining of hands, which communicated to 
them that of their neighbours ; and by the found of 
the piano^forte, or of an agreeable voice. The 
patients were magnctifed alfo dire£lly by means of

the finger, and of an iron rod moved before ihe 
face, or behind the bead, and on the diieafed parts, 
always obferving the diftin&amp;ion of the poles : the 
perfon who performed the operation a6led upon 
them alio by the look, and by daring at them; 
but they were magnetifed in a particular manner by 
applying the fingers to the hypochondriac region, 
and fometimes continuing to do fo for feveral 
hours. 

EffeBs ohferved on the Patients* 

The patients exhibited a highly varied piClure» 
according to their difierent ftates* Some of them 
were calm and tranquil, and experienced. nO ^fie^ 
Whatever ; others coughed, fpat, and felt fome flight 
pain, a local or a univerfal heat, and fits of perf- 
piration ; others were agitated and tormented with 
convulfions, which \ftx^ remarkable for their num* 
ber, their duration, and violence. As foon as one 
convulfion began, feveral ^others manifefied them- 
felves. The commiflioners faw fome which lafied 
ihree hours ; they were accompanied with the ex- 
pefioration of a turbid vifcous liquor, forced up 
by the vfolence of the efforts. Sometimes ilreaks 
of blood came up; and one young man in psurticu-^ 
lar, one of the patients, threw up a great deal of 
it. Thefe convutfions were chara£leriled by fudden 
and involuntary movements of all the limbs, or 
c6ntra£kion of the throat, f ubfultus of - the byr

,pocho)i(}ria and the epigaftrion uneafine&amp;i a wild» 
nefs of look, piercing cries, weeping, hiccup, and 
immoderate laughter ; they were preceded and foU 
lowed . by a ftate of languor and reverie, a fort of 
dejeftion, and even lethargy. The leaft unexpe£ted 
noife produced in the patients a tremor, and it was 
obferved that changing the tone and meafure of the 
airs, played on the piano-forte, had an influence on 
them; fo that by livelier tunes they were more 
agitated, and the vivacity of their convulfions was 
renewed. 

A hall, lined with matting, &apos;had been at firft def. 
tined for patients affli£led with thefe convulfions, 
and on that account was called the chamber ofcrifts; 
but M. Deflon does not think proper to make ufe of 
.it, and all the patients, whatever be their fymp*. 
toms, are colle£led together in the public halU 

Nothing can be more aftonifliing than the appear* 
ance exhibited by thefe convulfions: none but 
thofe who have feen them can fofm. any idea of 
them, and thofe who fee them are not a little fur. 
prifed at the profound tranquility of one part of the 
patients, and the agitation experienced by another ; 
the various fymptoms which are repeated, and the 
fympathetic emotions produced. Some patients 
Attach themfelves to each other cxclufively ; rufli 
towards each other, laugh, addrefs each other in an 
affeElionate tone, and mutually foften each others 
crifes. They are all fubje6l to hfan who magnetifes ;

though in an apparent flate of .ftupor the found of 
his voice, a look, or a fign, is fufScient to route 
them from it, and in confequence of thefe conilant 
efFefis, it is impol&amp;ble not to acknowledge fome 
great power by which the patients are agitated and 
fubdued; and of which he who magnetifes feems 
to be the depofitory. 

Conclujion, 

The commiflioners having afcertalned, that this 
animalo-magnetic fluid cannot be perceived by any 
of our fenfes ; that it has no aSion either on them, 
or on the patients fubjefked to it ; and having aC- 
fured themfelves that preffure and touching occafioti 
changes feldom favourable in the animal economy ; 
and, in the lafi place, having demonllrated by deci^ 
five experiments, that the imagination without mag^ 
netifm produces convulfions, and that magnetifm 
without the imagination produces nothing, have 
unanimoufly concluded, in regard to the queftioa 
^of the exiftence and utility of the magnetic ULuidi, 
that nothing proves its exiftence ; that the violent

 WEIGHTS &apos;FOR BALANCES.

with which any number of pounds, from one to 
&apos; &apos;any determinate number, may be weighed in tha 
fmpiejk manntr.

Though thfSi on the firft view, may appear to 
belong to mechanics, it may be readily feen that it 
it nothing but an arithmetical problem ; for the 
queftion may be reduced to dus. To find a feries 
(rf numbers, beginning with unity, and which added 
or fubtrafied faora each other in every manner 
ppflible, (hall form all the numbers from unity, up 
to any number required. 

This queftion may be refolved two ways, viz. 
by addition alone, or by addition combined with 
fubtraClion. In the fiirft cafe, the feries of weights^ 
which anfwers the problem, is that of the numbers 
increafing in a double prpgreffion ; in the fecond» 
that of the triple progreffion. 

Thus, for example, if we have weights equiva- 
lent to 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 pounds, we may weighs 
by means of thefe, any number of pounds up to 
31 ; for with 2 and 1 we can form 3 pounds ; with 
4 and 1, 5 pounds; with 4 and 2, 6 pounds; with 
4, 2 and 1 , 7 pounds ; Sec* With one more weight 
of 32, we can weigh 63 pounds; and fo on^ 
doubling the laft weight and dcdufting unity from 

that double. &apos; 

But if weights in the triple progreffion be em* 
ployed, as 1, 3, g, 27, 81, by means of thefe we 
can weigh any number of pounds from 1 to 121 ; for 
^ with the fecond lefs the firit^ that is to fay, putting 
the firft iflto one fcale and the fecond into the 
^hfir, we make 2 pounds ; by putting botb wXq the 



BALANCBSfc %g§ 

fame fcale we form 4 pounds ; by putting 9 into 
the one fide, and* 3- + 1 into the other, we form 
j pounds ; 9 on the one fide and 3 on the other, 
will give 6 pounds ; 9 + 1 on the one fide and 3 
on the other, will make 7 pounds ; and fo by dif- 
ferent tranfpofitions, we may proceed in this man« . 
ner to the weight above mentioned. 

It is here evident that the lad method is fimpler 
than the other, as it requires a lefs nfumber of dif«&gt;ferent weights. 

Thefe two progreffions are, in this refpeft, moit 
advantageous than any arithmetical progreffion that 
could be tried ; for if weights in the natural aiithw 
metical progreffion 1, 2, 3, 4,&amp;c, were employed, 
to weigh 120 pounds Would require 15: and t&lt;&gt;weigh 121 pounds, with weights in the following 
arithmetical progreffion 1, 3, 5, 7,&amp;c, would re« 
quire 11. As no other but the triple progreffion 
would make up all the ntimberrpoffible, from the 
weight of one pound to the greateft refulting from 
the whole oi the weights, the triple progreffion is 
therefore the moft advantageous. 

It is evident that the folution of this problelh is of 
confiderkble utility in the ordinary affairs of life, 
fince it affords the means of weighing any number 
of pounds, with the lei^ft number pollible of different 
weights.

fire, the learned were much divided in their opinions 
on this fubje£l ; but of all the champions in favour 
of perpetual lamps, none has made greater efforts to 
obtain credit to their exigence, than Fortunio 
JJceti, in his book entitled De Reconditis Antique^ 
rum fLucernis. 

If we ^an believe this author, nothing was more 
coxfinion among the ancients than perpetual lamps. 
-The lamp of Demofihenes, that which burnt in 
the tcn^ple of Minerva at Athens, the Veftal fire at 
Home, all fumilh him with fo many proofs of the 
poflibility of un-extinguifliable fire. One cannot 
help fmilipg to. fee £o much learning fo badly em« • 
jployed : fqr who is there who does not know that 
thefe fires were called perpetual merely becaufe it 
was a point of religion to preferve them from being 
extinguiflied, and to.fupply them with continual 
&apos;aliment. 

The other partifans of perpetual lamps, while » 
they laugh at the fimplicity of Liceti, fupport their 
reafoning on fafts which feem to carry with them a 
little more weight ; they are as follow j

LAMPS* 361 

1. Tie Lamp of Tulliola. &apos; 

•The tomb of Tulliola, the beloved daughter of 
Cicero, and whofe death coft him fo many, tears, 
was difcovered, it is faid, under the pontificate o£ 
Paul III. It is pretended,, that in this tomb there 
was a lamp aftually burning, but which became ex- 
tinguiflied on the admiffion of air. , 

2. Tht Lamp of Olyhiusn 

4k 

fiut it is the lamp in the tomb of Olybius, which 
above all others, fupplies the partifans of perpetual . 
lamps with one of their ftrongeft arguments. 

In the year ijbo, as we are told, fome peafants 
digging the eaxtfa to a coniiderable depth at Atefta, 
in the neighbourhood of Padua, came to a tomb^ 
in which they found two earthen urns, one within 
the other. The latter, it is added, containing. a 
1)urning lamp, placed between two phials, one filled 
with liquid gold, and the other with liquid filver. 
Both thefe urns were omainented with Latin in- 
fcriptions. 

Such is the manner in which fevcral authors relate&apos; 
this curious difcovery. But what follows is ilill 
ftronger : Liceti gives a letter of one Maturantiuy, 
who tells his friend Alphenus, that he had got pof- 
felfion of this incomparable treafure. ** Both the

and the phials, have fallen into my hands, and are 
now in my poHeflion. If you (hould fee them you 
would be aftonilhed : I would- not part with them 
for a thoufand crowns of gold.&quot; This is no doubt 
the language of a man who believes he po^efles a 
valuable rarity. We do not however know that it 
exifts in any colleflion. 

It appears, that in this cafe, as at the tomb of 
Tulliola, an accident prevented enlightened people 
from beinjg; witnefles to the phenomenon ; for we 
read in the credulous Porta, that as t,he peafants 
who found this treafiire handled it too roughly, the 
lamp broke in their hands, and was extinguilhed. 

3. Tht Lamp of Pallas^ tUJon of Evandcr. 

We are told alfo, that about the year 800 of the 
Chriflian a:ra, the tomb of the famous PallaSi the 
fon of Evander, killed as is well known by Tumua, 
was found at Rome. 

Withm it was a burning lamp, which confe- 
quently muft have burnt nearly 2000 years, fince 
it was ihut up in the year 1170 before the Chriftian

placed on hOs related in to vague a manner, and 
accompanied with incoherent and romantic circum- 
ftances ? None of thefe {a£ls are fupported by any 
other teftimony, than that of men who lived a long 
time after ; no perfon, whofe authority is of any 
weight, aflertft that he a&amp;ually Jaw them. But in 
difputes refpe£ling things which are contrary to the 
common laws of nature, they muft at Jc^ft be cer- 
tified by enlightened men, above all fufpicion of 
credulity or ignorance. 

The tale refpeCling the tomb of Tulliola, is as old 
as the year 1345 ; a peripd when all Europe was 
iunk in the groffeft ignorance. A b«dy is (add to 
liave been found in it, and in that cafe it could not 
be the body of Tulliola ; for the Romans in the 
time of Cicero always bui:nt their dead. In confe* 
quence of this and (imilar circumftances, fonae 
authors have cojBije£lui1ed» that the tpmb alluded to, 
was that of the wife of Stilico; but the Chriftians 
aiever placed, lamps in their tombs* The account 
therefore of a lamp found in this tomb has every 
appearance of a fifiion. . . . 

But what fliall Hire fay of jhe tomb of Olybius, 
and the lamp with two^phials, one filled with fluid 
gold, and the other with fluid filver ? This double 
urn w?is found by peafants, who according to feme 
\authors« handled the lamp contained in the &apos;fecond 
urn fo clumfily, as to break it ; and yet Maturan. 
tius pretends that he hs4 it in his poifeflion. Who

faw the lamp^ burning ? What eyidence have .we 
that thie peafants faw it in that ft^te ? and whqfe 
tfeftimony in this cafe would be admii&amp;ble ?. Some 
vapour exhaled from a place fliutup for fo many- 
centuries might eaiily impofe. on rude and ignorant 
people. 

The ftory of the t*mb of Pallas» the fon of Evan- 
der, is fcarcely worthy of refutation. To fliew the; 
impofture, nothhig is ncceffary but to read the 
Latin infcription, faid to have^been contained on 
it, which is as follows •. 

Filius Evandri Pallas quern lancf a Turni 
Militis occidit, more suo jacet hie. . 

Who will be fo weak as to believe, that thcfe vcrfes 
were written in the time of Eneas ? One needs only 
to have feen the language of the twelve tables, to be 
able to judge how little refemblance the ancient 
language of the Romans, and that confequently of 
the period of the Kings of Alba, bore to thefe 
Latin verfes. In regard to the lamp of Venus, we 
(hall obferve that thofe who have fpoken of it, do 
not fay that it was not fupplied with new aliments 
What feems to occafion the greateft difficulty, is, 
that it could not be extinguiflied, either by wind or 
by rain ; but in this there is nothing wonderful, 
fince our oilmen felt flambeaus which have the fame 
property. Befides, even admitting that this lamp 
was perpetual, and inextinguifiiable, who is fo i^^o- 




gW , P£AP£TCrAL 

lanc as not to know, that the Pagan prielts were the 
greateft of impoflors, and tfaa^ they might employ 
Aany artifices to fupply the lamp with new aliraent ? 

The lamps of CafBodorus may be explained with 
equal eafe; they were lamps which, like thofe of 
Cardan, fupplied thcmfclves with oil by means of 
a icfervoir ; and Cafliodorus only meant to fay, that 
thefc lamps lafted a long time, in comparifon of the 
common lamps of that peridd, which ftood fre« 
quently in need of having oil poured into them. 

Thefe refleftions did not efcape feveral ingenious 
philofophcrs, and particularly Ottavio Feifrari, to 
whom we are indebted for a curious and learned 
work, Pe VeUruM Lucernis/eptdcralihus. AH thefe 
authors overturn the arguments of Liceti, and fully 
fhew that the fa£ls adduced in favotur of perpetual 
lamps, reft on a weak foundation ; and that they 
abound with abfurditics and contradi£lions. They 
even ridicule the wcaknefs of this learned man, who * 
by an excefs of creduUty^ almoft beyond fcelief, 
finds in the lamp of the tomb of the necromancer 
Merlin, dcfcribed by the poet Ariofto» a proof of 
perpetual lamps* 

We (hall conclude this article with the following 
very juft refle£lu&gt;ns of Ofiavio Ferrari^ above men- 
tioned, which naturally fuggeft therafelves to the 
mind. If the fecret of preparing perpetual and in* 
extinguifhable fire, had been known to the ancients^ 
would an art fo ufefiil have remained buried in

oblivion ? But even admitting that It might be Ipft 
for want of philofophical and chemical knowledge. 
is it poffible that Pliny, who enumerates the common 
inventions, as well as thofe moft celebrated, fliould 
fay nothing of this perpetual fire, a thing fo won- 
derful ? When Plutarch makes mention of the lamp 
of Jupiter Ammon, becaufe it burnt a whole year, 
is it to be fuppofed that he would obferve filence re* 
fpefting lamps, in comparifon of which the former 
was a contemptible trifle. 

We mull therefore fay, that both hi (lory and 
found criticifm oppofe every idea of fuch an inven- &apos; 
tion having ever exifted. We fliall now examine 
how far it is confiftent with the principle&apos;s of philo&lt;fpphy. 

Qn the Phyfical Pojibiltty of making a Perpetual 

Lamp* 

Having proved the weaknefs of all the fa£l$ 
brought as proofs in favour of perpetual lamps, it 
remains that we fhould examine, how far they are 
ppflible, according to the principles of found philo- 
fophy. 

To obtain a perpetual lamp, it would be, nccef- 
fasy to have as follows : 

ift. A wick which could not be confumed. 

2d. Some aliment which could not be confumed, 
or a fubftance which, after having ferved as aliment 

R4

368 perpitual 

to the Ere, fliould return into the veiTel without 
Ipfing its inflammable quality. 

3d. It would be neceflary alfo, that the flame 
fhouid be able to exifta longtime in a place ab/b- 
lutely clofe, and of fmall dimenfions ; for fuch 
were the tombs in which fthefe perpetual lamps are 
laid to have been found. 

But all thefe things are impoflible, as will be feen d 

by what* follows. &apos; 

§. I. hnpoffibility df having a Perpetual wick. 

The curious properties afcribed to the amianthus, 
which are in part real, are welj known. We will 
not deny that a wick, capable of lafting for a very 
h)ng time, might be made by means of this fub- 
flancc : but we muft pofitively aflert, that it would 
not be perpetual ; for however much its incombuf- 
tibility may have been boall&apos;ed of, this property is 
not abfolute ; the fire would at length deftroy it, as 
it does every other body. It is very true, that cloth 
made of the amianthus, when thrown into the fire, 
may betaken out found and entire, but not abfolute- 
ly fo ; for it is obferved that each time it is expofed 
to the fire, it lofes fome of its weight. It would 
therefore be at length confumed, and perhaps in a 
Ihort time, if it were only made, red hot and then 
cooled, or if it were left a confiderable time in a 
very ftrong fire. A wick of amianthus would con- 



.. LAMPS* .369 

iequehtly at the end of a certain time be CQlbpletely 
deftroyed. - t •.. &apos; 

Some have tried to make wicks of bundles of 
gold threads, exceedingly fine ; hut it has never 
heen poflible to light them, and even if this could 
Jbte done, another inconvenience v^ould- prevent 
their being of any ufe : they would be fufed by the 
flame, and confequently wQuld be rendered unfit 
for anfwering th^.^intended purpofe. ^ 

r 

§. II. Impojffibility of procuring IndeJiruSibU AH* 
ment for the perpetual lamps. Pretended recipes 
for making IndeJlruSible Oil* 

But w^ ihall even fuppofe a wick abfolutely un. 
alterable to have been found, and that it does not 
become choaked up with fuliginous matter, from 
the combuilible fubftance by which it is fed ; this 
iiowever would be only one fmall part of what is 
iJyeceiTary for obtaining a perpetual lamp : feme kind 
of aliment which fliall experience no diminution, 
or which having ferved^ to maintain the flame with* 
out experiencing any alteration, may return by a 
perpeiuid circulation, into the^ veflel from which it 
iffued,. wiU.a]rQ be requifite. Is all this poffible ? 

Let us now hear the alchemists, or the partifans 
of perpetual lamps. We (hall be entertained with 
their ideas refpe£ling the manner in which an oil, 
fuch 9&amp;. thefe lamjps would require^ might be oh* 
tainedi . R A

for that valuaUe oil, which would put us in poffef* 
fion of perpetual lamps. This is the. noble fecret 
with which Liceti pretends that Olybius was ac« 
quainted 4 but the metals are as incapable of pro* 
dacing oil as the amianthus. 

It may however be faid, that if it were poflible 
to reduce gold to a liquid ftate, we might perhaps 
obtain an incombuftible oil, as gold is unalterable 
in the fire. But beiides the impoffibility of con* 
verting gold into a liquid, how do we know that it 
Vould be tndefirudible?

what quantity of air is confumed in a certain time 
l^y the combuftion of i^ taper of certain dimenfions ^ 
fo that we may eafily predifl in what time the flan^ 
will infallibly be extingui/hed. 

^efides, it is well known that the cavities of the 
ancient tombs were exceedingly fmall ; and, to 
increafe the difficulty, it is faid that the perpetual 
Is^mps burnt in the veflels in which they were in« 
clofed. Such at lead was the cafe with that of 01y« 
bius ; but if this veffel had been three feet in dia« 
meter, which by no means appears, it is certain that 
a lamp could not have exifle^ in \\. two hours, 
without corrupting the whole of the air it contained, 
and without being extjnguifhed. 

Wie (hall not enlarge farther on this fubjefi, as it 
would be wafling time to accumulate arguments to &apos; 
combat this diimera of perpetual lamps.

«s to improve geography and navigation, to deter- 
jnioe the annual revolution of the fun, and to avoid 
falling into error and confufion. Gnomonics, or the 
art of conftru£ling fun-dials, is deduced from this 
fcience ; it makes us acquainted with the equality

On a horizontal plane raife perpendicular to it a

plate having a hole in it, nearly about a line in 
breadth, and defcribe from the bottom of the ver- 
tical needle, or from the centre of the hole in tho

both in the forenoon and afternoon, the points of the 
fame circle which are touched at thefe different 
periods by the extremity of the Shadow of the flyle, 
or by the centre of the light pafling through the hole 
in the plate ; draw a ftraight line through thefe two 
points, and divide it into two equal parts. When 
this is done, draw a ftraight line from the middle 
of the latter to the centre of the concentric circles, 
by which means you will have a meridian traced out 
with the utmoft precifion.

Then fix the flyle in* the bottom of the wmdow, in

To find the fecond, peceflary for marking its direc-

many times lefs one as the moon is days old, in 
order to obtain the hour as it would be indicated by 
the fun. 

For example, if you find that the fliadow of the

four^filths of an hour, which are equivalent to foi^r

This &apos;table, which conflfls of two columns, ex&lt;-

t HYGROMETERS; 

To meafure tlu Moijlure and Drynefs, of the air ; 
Jhort account of the principal Hygrometers in* 
vented for this purpojt : their Fault s._ 

Air is fufceptible not only of acquiring a greater 
or lefs degree of heat, but alfo of becoming more 
or lefs moift. It is therefore one of the objefts of 
natural philofophy to meafure this degree of moifture, 
efpecially as that quality of the air has a great influ- 
ence on the human body, on vegetation, and on a 
great many more of the efFeSs of nature. This 
has given rife to the hygrometeY^ which is an in- 
ftrumcnt proper for meafuring the huihidity of the 
air. 

But it muft be allowed, that the inftruments hi- 
therto invented iof this purpofe, have not been 
attended with that accuracy which there was reafon 
to expeft. We have hygrometers indeed which 
indicate that the air has been more or lefs moift ; 
but they have often this fault, that they fliew a 
greater degree of moifture than really exifts in the 
atmofphere : befides, they are not comparable ; that 
is to fay-, it is not pofTible by their means to compare 
the moifture of one day, or of one place, with that 
of another. It may however be proper to d^fcribe

thcfe different hygrometers, were it only that their 
utility may be tried and examined. 

1. As fir wood is very fufceptible of participating 
in the drynefs and moifture of the atmofphere, fome 
have conceived the idea of applying this property 
to the conftrudioA of an hygrometer. For this 
purpofe, a fmall, very thin fir board, is placed acrofs 
between two vertical immoveable pillars, fo that the 
fibres Hand in a horizontal direction ; for it is in the 
lateral direction, or that tranfverfal to its fibres, that 
fir and other kinds of wood are extended by raoif- 
tiTC. The upper edge of the board ought to have a 
fraall rack, fitted into a pinion, conneftcd with a 
ivheel, and the latter with another wheel, having 
on its axis an index* It may be eafily perceived 
that by thefe me^nSf the leail motion communicated 
by the upper edge of the board to the rack, by its 
rifing or falling, will be indicated in a very fenfible 
manner by the index ; confequently, i£ the motion 
of the inde:^ be regulated in fuch a manner, that 
from e?ctreijac drynefs, to extreme moifture, it may 
make a complete revolution, the divifion^ of this 
circle will indicate how much the prefent ftate of 
the.9tmpf|&gt;he)re is diftant from either of thefe ex*, 
tremes^. 

This invention is ingenious, but it is not fufii- 
cient. The .wood retains its moifture a long time 
after the ^ir has loft that with which it was charged ; 
bjefideSy thq board gradually becomes lefs fenfible to 



w 



the imprei&amp;ons of the air, and therefore produces, 
little or no efie£l. 

2. Sufpend a fmall circular plate by a fine ftring*, 
or piece of catgut, faftenedto its centre of gravity, 
and let the other end of the ftring be attached to a 
hook. According as tlie air is more or lefs moift, 
you will fee the fmall plate turn round, in one di* 
re£lion, or in another. 

The hygrometers commonly fold, are conftruEled^ 
on this principle. They confid of a kind of box, 
the fore part of which reprefents a building with 
two doors* On one iide of the metal plate which 
turns round, ftands the figure of a man,, with an 
umbrella, to defend bini from the rain, and on the 
other a woman with a fan. The «4&gt;pearance of the 
former of thefe figures indicates damp, and that of 
the oth^r dry weather. This pretended hygr&lt;Hneter 
can ferve for no other purpofe than to amufe chiU 
dregi; for the philolbpher muft obferve that, as 
the variations of humidity are tranfmitted to this 
inftrument only by degrees, it will indicate moif- 
ture or drought when the ilate of the atmofphere is 
quite contrary. 

3. Some have tried to confirud; a hygrometer^ 
by .making fad a piece of catgut at one extremity, 
winding, it backward3 and forwards over different 
^ullieSp and fufpending from its other extremity a 
fmall weight, behind which is placed a graduated, 
fcale. Others difpofe the extremity of tbp catgut 



/

in fuch a manner, as to caufe it to move an index 
round a graduated plate, the different degrees ol 
which indicate the drynefs or moifture of theat- 
ifiofpherc. This inftrument however is fubjeft 
to the fame inconveniences as that before mentioned, 

4. Put into one fcale of a balance any fait that 
aUra6ls the moifture of the air, and into the other a 
weight, in exa£l equilibrium with it. The fcale 
containing the felt will fink down during damp 
weather, and thereby indicate that fuch is the fiate 
of the atmofphere. An index, to determine the 
different degrees of drought or moifture, may be 
eafily adapted to it. 

This inftrument however is worfe than any of the 
reft; for a fait immerfed in moift air becomes 
charged with a great deal of humidity ; but lofcs it 
very flowly when the air becomes dry : fixed alkali 
of tartar even imbites moifture till it falls in delU 
futum, that is to fay, till it is reduced to a liquid or 
fluid ftate. 

5. Mufic may be employed to indicate the dry ^ 
nefs or moifture of the jadr. The found of a flute 
is higher during dry than during moift weather, and 
the ftring of a violin exhibits the fame phenomenon ; 
but neither of thefe can fliew the immediate ftate 
of the air in regard to drynefs or humidity. 

From what has been here faid, there is reafon to 
conclude, that no comparative hygrometer has ever 
•yet been invented.

SNAILS. 381 

SNAILS/ 

That part of animals which has tlie external. .ap« 
pearance of the head, ought not always to be confi«« 
dered as the head, but that part only containing 

« 

the brain, which is the general organ where all the 
fenfible parts that concur to &apos;promote animal life 
te minate. There are fome animals- indeed which 
prefent in their anterior pan certain organs, which 
might be taken for heads ; but which however are 
fo only in appeaiance; Such are all in&amp;£lsi in the 
ftate of larvae: nature has placed in: the! anterior 
part of their body a round ring, in the form of a 
head, which they employ while in that fiate to re- 
ceive and mafticate their food ; and for that.purpoib 
this organ Is aimed iwidi : a Ikihd of forcepa, ;in &apos; the 
fame manner 4$wthe! reab h^d of r beetles. When 
the animal is transfbhned into a chryfolite, this titig 
detaches itfi^lf from it entirely ; and « it is then fden 
that it is .not a real but a falfe head, united by 
&apos;nitiire to the phyfical conftraCHon of th^ i|ife£l in 
the ftate of larva. Th^ cafe is th^ fame with fnails,: 
in this aftonifliing animal the brain, from which the 
nerves proceed, is plac/^d in the hind part of the 
~ neck, where . it&apos; has the appearance of a grey ring, 
and the apparent head, which, in its natural pofition, 
19 about five lines diftant from this ring, is nothing 
eUe than a prolongation gf the neck or anterior 




gS« 8NAI1S« 

extremity of the animal, in which nature has placed 
the organs of maflicaiian« feeing and feeling* 

According to thefe principles, which are the fruit 

of mature refle^on on the internal flxudure of fnails^ 

4he leprodudion of the pretended head of theCe 

animals does not exhibit to the enlightened ob« 

ferver^ either that.fingularity or importance whicA 

fome have attached to it* The objeflof this phe« 

nomenon is only aa extremity which, though it 

feeros a head to the eyes of the vulgar, is fur fr6tii 

uppearing fo to the eye&amp;of the philofophic ob« 

fervin&apos;. To cui off thereibre tfao anterior extremity 

y:^ fnailf , is the fame iMiig, in iregard to the hea4« 

«s to cut o£P the .pofteridT extfemky) or the end of 

*die tail of a falsmander, which will be £sen to be

But if , this fikppo&amp;d iicad /fafe cdt off when the 

smima] cotitraSs itfelfi the bnahiri^ebig then.kfe 

liihM from the extnemky; and as we may lay in its

deftrbying the animal. On the other band, if the 

apparent head be cut off when the animal is fully 

extended, the operation fucceeds, and reprodu£lion 

takes place. My curiofity has been feveral times 

excited by the fingulafity of this phehomenon, and 

1 have repeated the experiment with fo muchXuc* 

cefs, that I confider it as eftabliOied on truth. m&gt;It follows from what has been here faidi ill« 

That&apos; in organifed bodies in general, both animal 

and vegetable, reprodu3ion does not take place, but 

Jn parts merely acceflbry, and never in thofe which 

have an immediate connection with their exiftence* 

or which are eflential to life ; becaufe, in cutting 

oiF the latter, the fources of reprodu£libn are de* 

ftroyed. 2d« That in mixt beings, the faculty of 

reproduflion is always in the inverfe ratio of their 

perfeflion and fenfihility $ that is to fay, the more 

complex the orgainic parts of an animal, and the 

ftronger its powers of fenfation^ the lefs are its 

means of reproduction. Hence it happens that birds 

and quadrupedes, which arc very perfeft, and have 

great fenfiblity, produce only paas void of fenfa^ 

tion, fuch as the feathers, claws,&amp;c ; and as there 

is little animal perfe&amp;ion in worms and fnails, the 

want of fenfation in which is fupplied by muf* 

cular irritability^ they have the property of repro&lt;« 

ducing even irritable extremities, provided the 

brarn, which is the fource of all the fenfible parts^ 

remains untouched* In the laft place, animals 



— •&quot;»p^~— &quot;l^&quot;^^

lefs cotnplex in their organization, and which con- 
, lift only of a repetition of Cmilar parts, much more 
irritable than fenfible, reproduce themfelves entirely 
in every part of their body cut off, and are revived 
as we may fay in each portion oLthem^as is the 
cafe in regard to polypes. 

By the help of thefe principles, deduced from 
the real theory of rejH&apos;odu£lions, general as well as 
^)articular, we may be readily convinced, that if an 
animal cannot reproduce thofe of its parts which are 
immediately conne£led with the principle of fenfa- 
tion, much lefs will it reproduce a rc^l head ; that is 
to fay, the organ of the brain, from which is derived 
the principle that forms the eflence of animal life.
