 Free Bag of AvoDerm Pet food
 Breeders Choice Pet Foods are now carried at Petco. This is new for that company. If you go to their web site, you can request up to 3 free coupons for trial bags, which I think is the 3 lb size. Here is the link to the form:

Also in August CAT FANCY magazine (on page 29) there is a coupon for a 3 lb. bag of Avo Derm cat food. Expires 9/30/02.

I don&apos;t have dogs but I would bet that a similar coupon is in DOG AND KENNEL, which is the sister publication to CAT FANCY. Reply With Quote 07-18-2002,  02:15 PM #2 8Dalejrsgirl
