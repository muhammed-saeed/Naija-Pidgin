All 11 episodes
A behind-the-scenes look at the equipment, technology and danger that went into the making of this incredible series.
Part 1: Pole to Pole
Follow the sun as it touches the lives of creatures across the planet, bringing a fresh understanding of how the world is interconnected. From African herds migrating hundreds of miles in search of water to desperate animal hunts, &quot;Pole to Pole&quot; examines how the seasons produce the greatest spectacles on Earth.Part 2: Mountains
Tour the planet&apos;s mightiest mountain ranges and meet the rare animals that inhabit them. From a never-before-seen hunt by snow leopards on the treacherous slopes of the Himalayas to a family of pumas struggling to survive the unstable weather of the Andes, &quot;Mountains&quot; reveals life on the planet&apos;s highest peaks.Part 3: Deep Ocean
Explore the depths of the planet&apos;s oceans and discover some of this mysterious world&apos;s most spectacular species. From light shows performed by squids to the blue whale, the largest animal to ever exist, &quot;Deep Ocean&quot; investigates the waters that cover two-thirds of the Earth&apos;s surface, yet remain largely unknown.Part 4: Deserts
Voyage to the world&apos;s harshest environments and learn how life manages to keep a precarious hold in every desert. From the llama-like guanacos of Chile&apos;s Atacama Desert that survive by licking dew from cactus spines to lions that scour arid Namibia for antelopes, &quot;Deserts&quot; unravels the secrets behind survival in unimaginable conditions.Part 5: Ice Worlds
Venture to the poles of our planet and find the harshest wild lands, where seasonal change is extreme. From emperor penguins defying the coldest conditions on Earth to the polar bear emerging from hibernation with her new cubs, &quot;Ice Worlds&quot; explores an ecosystem in which few could survive.Part 6: Shallow Seas
Dive into the planet&apos;s shallow waters where sunlight reaches the seabed and find an explosion of life. From the rarely seen cooperation between snakes and fish hunting for food to the journey of a humpback whale and her newborn calf traveling thousands of miles in search of food, &quot;Shallow Seas&quot; explores the rarely seen sights of the world&apos;s mighty oceans.Part 7: Great Plains
Trek to the Earth&apos;s largest land habitats, where vast open spaces play host to the biggest groups of animals in the world. From the 2,000 mile migration undertaken by three million caribou in the Arctic tundra to a pride of 30 starving lions hunting elephants, Great Plains reveals the most impressive migrations and boldest hunts on the planet.Part 8: Jungles
Delve deep into this ecosystem, beyond the flourishing plant life, and find an environment that tests each animal&apos;s survival skills. From the elaborate mating rituals of New Guinea&apos;s birds of paradise to the territorial battles of chimpanzees, &quot;Jungles&quot; examines an environment that occupies only three percent of the planet and yet is home to more than half the world&apos;s species.Part 9: Fresh Water
Follow rivers as they course from mountain to the sea, nourishing unique and dramatic wildlife. From the world&apos;s deepest lake inhabited by the only species of freshwater seal to a stunning look at the world&apos;s highest waterfall, &quot;Fresh Water&quot; offers a unique perspective on the secret lives teeming in our purest waters.Part 10: Seasonal Forests
Investigate these temperate regions and find some of the most elusive creatures and well-adapted plant life on Earth. From the giant sequoia tree ten times the size of a blue whale to the trackless Siberian forests where just 40 Amur leopards remain, &quot;Forests&quot; brings to life a seemingly familiar world that remains largely unexplored.Part 11: Caves
Descend into the only habitat not directly driven by sunlight to discover some of the most peculiar creatures on Earth. From Borneo&apos;s Deer Cave where five million bats roost to cave swiftlets that build nests from saliva, &quot;Caves&quot; digs deep into an underground world few people have ever explored.Note: HD DVDs can only be played on a HD DVD player.

It has been $180 since then.It is hard to find reviews anywhere. I called American Lawn Mower Company for more information, and the CSR told me it is a new product this year.It has similar specs, so I am hoping it is similar in performance to the Toro Power Curve, the SnowJoe and the Greenworks (wider swath at 20 inches) at a much lower cost. I have an Earthwise cordless electric mower that I love, so I thought I would give the company a try again.By the way, we know that an electric snow blower can&apos;t hold a candle to your 5-stage, 405 cc Snow Monster, but for alot of folks these do just fine, without the hassle of gas, oil, maintenance and starting problems. Of course there is a cord to get in the way, but I&apos;ll live with that.

While I really have DSL at home, I have maintained my Earthlink unlimited dialup account as a backup for years. I agree the $21.95/month for 7 email accounts is expensive, but that is the cost of having a necessary backup and there are family issues that keep me on it when I would have otherwise gone a cheaper route.
The link above offers a year commitment at $14.95/month. (first month free)
It also offers a prepay 12 months for $150.00 = $12.50 per month.I believe the offer is intended for new business, but I was able to obtain the same offer via the account billing on line chat AFTER I logged into my billing email account. I told them truthfully that I had attempted to get the offer on line, but had difficulity as an existing customer. The agent first tried to sell me a year at the higher price. I indicted I was trying to do the $150.00 offer. After verifying the offer, the agent agreed and took care of it by repricing my Earthlink unlimited dialup pricing and then processed the year at the $150.00 as advertised.ADDED BONUS (IMO): I was paying $1.95/month for double the email capacity on each of two email addresses. This agent in the effort to upsell offered me 6 times normal email capacity for the same $1.95/month per email address. While this may be expensive to some, the new arrangement to me is a substancial savings.I placed the order on my Citi Dividend Rewards MC card. That card includes a 5% CashBack on utilities including internet service this calendar quarter. That will result in a savings of $1.00 per email address.YMMV depending on the agent you get. Historically, Earthlink has set up such promotions for a limited time and then not had them for existing customers. How long the offer will stay up this time is uncertain. Will they have a better one? Maybe...unknown.

Four DVDs
Four hours of bonus features including digitally restored NASA film highlights, mission clips, and astronaut interviews.
Part 1: Ordinary Supermen
NASA selects seven men to become the first astronauts, all test pilots who are prepared to risk their lives. No one has ever survived a vertical launch on top of a rocket, but it&apos;s believed to be the only way to put an astronaut into earth orbit. NASA and America&apos;s first astronauts, the Mercury Seven, are on a journey into the unknown. Six of the men ride into space, each launch taking NASA further forward in their quest to conquer the cosmos.Part 2: Friends and Rivals
Nine new astronauts arrive at NASA. Their mission? Test all of the procedures required to land men on the moon and bring them safely back to earth. Each Gemini mission launches two men into space, leading to some of NASA&apos;s greatest moments: Ed White&apos;s spacewalk, the first orbital rendezvous of Gemini 6 and 7, and Neil Armstrong&apos;s first space docking.Part 3: Landing the Eagle
The Apollo program is set to achieve the ultimate prize of the Space Race, landing men on the moon. But a fire breaks out in the pressurized capsule of Apollo 1, resulting in the deaths of three beloved astronauts. However, NASA rebounds, launching men into deep space and landing Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon.Part 4: The Explorers
Apollo 13 puts the astronauts to the ultimate test, returning a damaged spacecraft back safely to earth. Apollo 17 sends man for the longest mission yet to the surface of the moon, but it&apos;s the last lunar mission for generations. Now, it&apos;s time for a new phase in the program: converting an unused Saturn V rocket, NASA launches Skylab, America&apos;s first space station.Part 5: The Shuttle
For its first 20 years, NASA launches capsules carrying a maximum of three people. But new requirements for a bigger cargo bay prompt a breakthrough in spacecraft design. The development of the re-usable shuttle leads to a revolutionary approach to space travel. Meanwhile, the pioneers of NASA&apos;s manned programs are leading the way into the modern era of the space age. Part 6: A Home In Space
One of the most complex instruments ever built, the Hubble Space Telescope is expected to transform our understanding of the Universe. But once it is in orbit NASA discovers a serious problem, a defective main mirror. NASA sends a team of astronauts to fix the problem in its greatest and highest profile mission since the Apollo era. It gives NASA the confidence to begin construction on the International Space Station. Related Categories:

Bought the Dexter DX-4001 for $177.30 at Home Depot.
I used the 10% off Lowes coupon at HD. Buy these at B&amp;M;so you can use coupon.
According to the in-store brochure these are normally $299.
Lowes has them but they are around $249 and are
a special order (nullifys coupon).
It may look like a normal price on their website but
I think it may be a mistake (not showing as a special).Just got done installing, looks sharp.
Unfortunately, wasps are still coming in the house from the chimney.

by William Gibson (Author), Yoko Ono (Author), Barry Eisler (Author), Jake Adelstein (Author), and othersSoftcover version is $11.99Product Description:
In just over a week, a group of unpaid professional and citizen journalists who met on Twitter created a book to raise money for Japanese Red Cross earthquake and tsunami relief efforts. In addition to essays, artwork and photographs submitted by people around the world, including people who endured the disaster and journalists who covered it, 2:46: Aftershocks: Stories from the Japan Earthquake contains a piece by Yoko Ono, and work created specifically for the book by authors William Gibson, Barry Eisler and Jake Adelstein. The primary goal, says the book&apos;s editor, a British resident of Japan, is to record the moment, and in doing so raise money for the Japanese Red Cross Society to help the thousands of homeless, hungry and cold survivors of the earthquake and tsunami. The biggest frustration for many of us was being unable to help these victims. I dont have any medical skills, and Im not a helicopter pilot, but I can edit. A few tweets pulled together nearly everything all the participants, all the expertise and in just over a week we had created a book including stories from an 80-year-old grandfather in Sendai, a couple in Canada waiting to hear if their relatives were okay, and a Japanese family who left their home, telling their young son they might never be able to return.&quot; If you&apos;d like to make a donation to aid the victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, please visit the Japanese Red Cross Society website, where you can donate via Paypal or bank transfer (watch out for the fees, though!) or the American Red Cross Society, which accepts donations directed to its Japan Earthquake and Pacific Tsunami fund (but only accepts donations made with U.S.-issued credit cards). And of course, if you like the book, please tell your friends, and tell them to give generously as well! Thank you! Japan really does appreciate your help!5.0 out of 5 Stars (27 Reviews) Tags: 246   Aftershocks   Stories   from   the   Japan   Earthquake   Free   Kindle   eBook   Amazoncom   Staples coupons: 50% off select case paper, labelers, flash drives, dvds,Charmin,Sustainable Earth,HP OJ 4500, bus cards Staples coupons for 50% off select case paper, P-Touch labelers, flash drives, HP dvd 50 packs, Charmin Basic, Sustainable Earth products, HP Officejet 4500, Premium Business cards

Amazon.co.uk Review
Not only is Planet Earth one of the most jaw-dropping, ambitious, nature documentaries the BBC has ever produced, its now taken on another role: as a superb demonstration disc for the strength of and Blu-ray.
Spread over a good ten hours, the series charts life and nature in dozens upon dozens of differing locations around the earth. Diligently and warmly narrated by Sir David Attenborough, Planet Earth calmly goes close in on its subject matter when required, and then pulls out some stunning perspective shots that are simply breathtaking. Its hard to come up with the right superlatives to do the photography on the programme any kind of justice, and that its married to such fascinating subject matter is all the better. And if you think the original broadcast of Planet Earth was something special, or you were gobsmacked by the picture quality on DVD, just wait until you see it in 1080i HD glory. Particularly some of the broader shots here are all but without parallel, and its a real reward for those who have invested ahead of the crowd in high definition technology. Presented over five discs, and matching wonderful content to spot-on visual presentation, Planet Earth is now not just a landmark in nature documentary film making. Its also a chartermark of quality for just what HD DVD and Blu-ray can offer. A stunning release, in more than one sense. --Jon Foster Thanks anya618 Tags: Amazonuk   Planet   Earth   Complete   BBC   Series   Blu   rayRegion   Free   for   shipped   Buy:Maxfield&amp;Oberton 216 Piece Rare Earth Magnetic Buckyballs Sets Green Edition(2-Pack) $37 http://www.buy.com/prod/maxfield-oberton-216-piece-rare-earth-ma...

The story begins in Los Angeles one evening at 7:07 p.m. A talent agent (Gena Rowlands) gets into the back of a taxi driven by a sullen, chain-smoking young woman (Winona Ryder), and over the course of their bumpy conversation, Rowlands&apos;s character becomes convinced that the cabby would be perfect for a particular part in a movie. Meanwhile, at that very moment, taxi drivers in New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki are all having unique encounters with a variety of fares, breaking through that invisible social barrier between the front and back seats of their cars, often to absurd or touching effect. Among them are cabby Roberto Benigni&apos;s ranting confessions to a priest, Armin Mueller-Stahl&apos;s relinquishing of the wheel to a stunned Giancarlo Esposito, and Isaach De Bankol&apos;s relentless discussion of sight and sex with an angry, blind woman (Beatrice Dalle). What emerges is a chain of brief intimacies (not always welcomed by the characters), like a number of matches lit simultaneously across the globe, flickering brightly for a few short moments. This popular work by Jarmusch helped confirm his reputation as a fiercely independent filmmaker of rare perception, rigor, and classical sensibility matched with original thinking. --Tom KeoghProduct DescriptionFive cities. Five taxicabs. A multitude of strangers in the night. Jim Jarmusch assembled an extraordinary international cast of actors (including Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Batrice Dalle, and Roberto Benigni) for this hilarious quintet of tales of urban displacement and existential angst, spanning time zones, continents, and languages. Jarmuschs lovingly askew view of humanity from the passenger seat makes for one his most charming and beloved films. # Actors: Winona Ryder, Gena Rowlands, Lisanne Falk, Alan Randolph Scott, Anthony Portillo

Plant Picker knows that the sun is more intense in the summer than in the winter!This app includes a database of plants for your home and garden including a description, photograph, and interesting facts for the plants!How it Works
1) Add a new location to track.
2) Take pictures of that location throughout the day. Cameras have sophisticated ways of measuring light conditions so they can take a properly exposed photo. Plant Picker uses this to your advantage by measuring the light conditions to help you select the perfect plant!
3) Plant Picker goes to work! Plant Picker uses the light samples from the photographs to find which plants will thrive at that location.The features of this full version include:

It must have been quite a baffling experience for first-time viewers: the swirling abstract graphics, the weird electronic sound effects courtesy of the BBC&apos;s Radiophonic Workshop, the very oddity of the show&apos;s title. This really was groundbreaking TV. &quot;I think you&apos;ll find there&apos;s a very simple explanation for all of this&quot;, says schoolteacher Ian Chesterton (William Russell) condescendingly, shortly before being taken on board the TARDIS and transported to an alien planet. For audiences, too, this was something entirely unfamiliar, yet obviously appealing: Doctor Who ran for almost 30 years and remains one of the BBC&apos;s most popular shows. His later incarnations were all eccentric in their different ways, but William Hartnell&apos;s original Doctor is an irascible and distinctively alien character, not at all happy having to put up with ignorant 20th-century humans. The &quot;Unearthly Child&quot; of the title is his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), temporarily attending school on Earth. She is conspicuously different from her classmates and attracts the attention of two of her teachers who resolve to find out why. After an encounter with her mysterious grandfather they are whisked away on an adventure to a different time and place where angry cavemen are trying in vain to learn the secret of fire. Thus the show&apos;s trademarks are established from the outset: the Doctor and his more or less reluctant human companions, the mechanical unreliability of the TARDIS, the cliffhanger ending of each episode. It was a formula that rarely changed but that allowed apparently limitless variation, the only constraint being the BBC&apos;s budget. In later years the show tried vainly to compete with blockbuster special effects movies; but its original low-key incarnation relied more on inventive scenarios and good writing--qualities that are just as important now as then. --Mark WalkerThe Daleks (sometimes called &quot;The Dead Planet&quot;) is the second-ever Doctor Who serial. First broadcast between December 1963 and February 1964, the seven-episode story ensured the program&apos;s success by introducing the Doctor&apos;s most iconic enemies. Five hundred years after a nuclear war has devastated the planet Skaro, the Doctor (William Hartnell), Barbara, Ian, and Susan materialize in a petrified forest where the pacifist, and decidedly camp, Thals face starvation. Our heroes visit a nearby city, the home of the last remaining Daleks, terrifyingly cold-blooded mutants encased in armed, pepper-pot-like shells, and become involved in a desperate battle for survival. Given a nightmarish atmosphere by Tristram Cary&apos;s surreal electronic score, The Daleks proved the template for many a future Doctor Who adventure. Hartnell&apos;s Doctor is a surprisingly self-serving hero and the ambitious storytelling, which reflects the Cold War fears of the time, belies a tiny budget. The remastered picture sometimes looks digitized, but this story, remade for the cinema as Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) and starring Peter Cushing, is still both an effective, if at times unintentionally hilarious, entertainment and an essential piece of television history. A superior sequel, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, was screened in late 1964. --Gary S DalkinOne of the rarest of the early Doctor Who series, with William Hartnell as the crusty old Doctor, Edge of Destruction is entirely based in the TARDIS, which has stopped somewhere between worlds and times. The Doctor blames Ian and Barbara, the two teachers who came aboard in search for answers about his granddaughter, Susan, assuming they have committed sabotage in an attempt to return to their own time. They, in turn, in spite of recent shared escapes from Cavemen and Daleks, have no particular reason to trust his sanity. Something is causing one after another of them to act with violent irrationality, and the clock is ticking towards their destruction... This is a claustrophobic two-episode plot in which the series examines closely some of its more beloved assumptions. --Roz Kaveney

*This release is REGION FREE and will play in U.S. BD playersNot only is Planet Earth one of the most jaw-dropping, ambitious, nature documentaries the BBC has ever produced, its now taken on another role: as a superb demonstration disc for the strength of and Blu-ray.
Spread over a good ten hours, the series charts life and nature in dozens upon dozens of differing locations around the earth. Diligently and warmly narrated by Sir David Attenborough, Planet Earth calmly goes close in on its subject matter when required, and then pulls out some stunning perspective shots that are simply breathtaking. Its hard to come up with the right superlatives to do the photography on the programme any kind of justice, and that its married to such fascinating subject matter is all the better.And if you think the original broadcast of Planet Earth was something special, or you were gobsmacked by the picture quality on DVD, just wait until you see it in 1080i HD glory. Particularly some of the broader shots here are all but without parallel, and its a real reward for those who have invested ahead of the crowd in high definition technology.Presented over five discs, and matching wonderful content to spot-on visual presentation, Planet Earth is now not just a landmark in nature documentary film making. Its also a chartermark of quality for just what HD DVD and Blu-ray can offer. A stunning release, in more than one sense. --Jon Foster Tags: Planet   Earth   Blu   Ray   shipped   Amazon   Region   Free   20 Pieces 8mm Super Strong Rare-Earth RE Magnets $1.99 + Free Shipping 20 Pieces 8mm Super Strong Rare-Earth RE Magnets $1.99 + Free Shipping

Emerging from the war-torn shadows of Englands Dark Ages, an idealistic mason, Tom Builder (Rufus Sewell, The Holiday) sets out on a quest of erecting a glorious Cathedral bathed in light. But when that light threatens to illuminate the dark secrets of ambitious Bishop Waleran Bigod (Ian McShane, 2005 Golden Globe Best Actor, TV&apos;s Deadwood) and the battling progeny of King Henry, Queen Maud (Alison Pill, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) and King Stephen (Tony Curran, Ondine), theyll stop at nothing to keep those secrets safe. The epic miniseries event also stars Matthew MacFadyen (Frost/Nixon) as Prior Philip, Hayley Atwell (Love Hate) as the beautiful noblewoman Aliena and Donald Sutherland (TV&apos;s Dirty Sexy Money) as Bartholomew.

Following the similarly monumental achievement of The Blue Planet: Seas of Life, this astonishing 11-part BBC series is brilliantly narrated by Sir David Attenborough and sensibly organized so that each 50-minute episode covers a specific geographical region and/or wildlife habitat (mountains, caves, deserts, shallow seas, seasonal forests, etc.) until the entire planet has been magnificently represented by the most astonishing sights and sounds you&apos;ll ever experience from the comforts of home. The premiere episode, &quot;From Pole to Pole,&quot; serves as a primer for things to come, placing the entire series in proper context and giving a general overview of what to expect from each individual episode. Without being overtly political, the series maintains a consistent and subtle emphasis on the urgent need for ongoing conservation, best illustrated by the plight of polar bears whose very behavior is changing (to accommodate life-threatening changes in their fast-melting habitat) in the wake of global warming--a phenomenon that this series appropriately presents as scientific fact. With this harsh reality as subtext, the series proceeds to accentuate the positive, delivering a seemingly endless variety of natural wonders, from the spectacular mating displays of New Guinea&apos;s various birds of paradise to a rare encounter with Siberia&apos;s nearly-extinct Amur Leopards, of which only 30 remain in the wild.
That&apos;s just a hint of the marvels on display. Accompanied by majestic orchestral scores by George Fenton, every episode is packed with images so beautiful or so forcefully impressive (and so perfectly photographed by the BBC&apos;s tenacious high-definition camera crews) that you&apos;ll be rendered speechless by the splendor of it all. You&apos;ll see a seal struggling to out-maneuver a Great White Shark; swimming macaques in the Ganges Delta; massive flocks of snow geese numbering in the hundreds of thousands; an awesome night-vision sequence of lions attacking an elephant; the Colugo (or &quot;flying lemur&quot;--not really a lemur!) of the Philippines; a hunting alliance of fish and snakes on Indonesia&apos;s magnificent coral reef; the bioluminescent &quot;vampire squid&quot; of the deep oceans... these are just a few of countless highlights, masterfully filmed from every conceivable angle, with frequent use of super-slow-motion and amazing motion-controlled time-lapse cinematography, and narrated by Attenborough with his trademark combination of observational wit and informative authority. The result is a hugely entertaining series that doesn&apos;t flinch from the predatory realities of nature (death is a constant presence, without being off-putting). At a time when the multiple threats of global warming should be obvious to all, let&apos;s give Sir David the last word, from the closing of Planet Earth&apos;s final episode: &quot;We can now destroy or we can cherish--the choice is ours.&quot; --Jeff Shannon Tags: Planet   Earth   Blu   Ray   3399   Amazon   wFS   Antec EarthWatts EA650 650W Continuous Power ATX12V Ver.2.2 / EPS12V version 2.91 SLI Certified $50AC AR FS@NewEgg LINK$5 off w/promo code EMCZNNW24, ends 1/3/11 Features

Its compact shape also allows for less breakage, so they&apos;ll last longer. Comes in a set of 20, with 13 different bright, bold colors (some colors will be repeated). The National Crayon Recycling Program takes pure, non-toxic wax Crayola-brand crayon donations from restaurants and schools to save more than 45,000 pounds of old and broken crayons from landfills.

I was at my local Aldi&apos;s today and I saw two Earthwise 14&quot; electric chainsaws (model #CS30014) marked down from $39.99 to $29.99. So it seems like at most it should be $39.99. Either way not a bad deal.
The next cheapest I can find is at Amazon for $59.99
http://www.amazon.com/Earthwise-CS30014-14-Inch-Electric-Chain/dp/B001JF2CYMBefore anybody goes and fights about electric vs gas, as long as you aren&apos;t a lumberjack cutting down huge trees this should be fine to clean up around the yard and cut small logs. I have a Craftsman electric chainsaw that is great at cutting logs to shorter lengths for me to split into fire wood.Besides for $30 even if it doesn&apos;t work it&apos;ll make a great Halloween prop.

Product Description
Planet Earth From the makers of The Blue Planet: Seas of Life, with an unprecedented production budget of $25 million, comes the epic story of life on Earth. Five years in production, over 2000 days in the field, using 40 cameramen filming across 200 locations, shot entirely in high definition, this is the ultimate portrait of our planet. A stunning television experience that captures rare action, impossible locations and intimate moments with our planet&apos;s best-loved, wildest and most elusive creatures. From the highest mountains to the deepest rivers, this blockbuster series takes you on an unforgettable journey through the daily struggle for survival in Earth&apos;s most extreme habitats. Planet Earth takes you to places you have never seen before, to experience sights and sounds you may never experience anywhere else. Wild China An exotic fusion of natural history and Oriental adventure, &quot;Wild China&quot; is a series of journeys through four startlingly different landscapes, each based around the travels of a real historical character. With splendour, scale and romance, Wild China lifts the veil on the world&apos;s most enigmatic and magnificent country, delving into its vibrant habitats to reveal a land of unbelievable natural complexity. Journey across China from the glittering peaks of the Himalayas to the barren steppe, the sub-Arctic to the tropical islands, through deserts both searingly hot and mind-numbingly cold and see, in pioneering images, a dazzling array of mysterious, beautiful, wild and rare creatures. Galapagos The inspiration for Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution, the Galpagos Islands are a living laboratory, a geological conveyor belt that has given birth to and seen the death of many species of plants and animals. As the western islands rise up from the sea offering a chance of life, the eastern islands sink back beneath the waves guaranteeing only death. Between the two are the middle islands; fertile, lush land in its prime that contains an incredible diversity of life. Nowhere else on the Earth are the twin processes of creation and extinction of species so starkly apparent... see it all unfold before your eyes in this stunning series filmed entirely in high definition from the BBC and the National Geographic Channel. Ganges A sumptuous series that tells the story of the most extraordinary river in the world - the Ganges. Human life and nature bustle along her river banks, in a kaleidoscope of colour and energy. From man-hunting tigers to giant lizards, here the wildlife is as diverse as the people. Traversing from the peaks of the Himalayas through frenetic cities to the teeming Delta where the river meets the sea, this is a vibrant and colourful look at how the Ganges shaped the wildlife, culture and beliefs of India.
