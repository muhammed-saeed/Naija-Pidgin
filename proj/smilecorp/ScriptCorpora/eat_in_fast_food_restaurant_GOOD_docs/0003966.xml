 Understanding Fast Food
Cooking Systems 
 
 Fast
food is a huge sector of the catering industry with annual sales
estimated to be more than£7 billion. Because of the high
volume nature
of fast food service, the equipment not only has to be quick, it has to
be very robust. Heavy-duty equipment is the best choice, medium-duty is
suitable where business is brisk, but not frenetic, but light-duty
equipment is unsuitable in all but very small fast food operations. 
 Often
equipment is designed and manufactured around a specific fast food
concept or menu item where there are global volumes of equipment to be
sold, but while designed with a specific purpose in mind, creative
caterers are always finding additional uses. 

 Pressure fryers 
 Pressure
fryers are most commonly associated with fried chicken restaurants.
Coated chicken pieces are lowered into the fry tank and a lid closed
and locked into place to form an airtight seal. Moisture is immediately
released from the food which rapidly builds up the air pressure. The
pressure causes rapid tumbling of the food and transfers heat faster
from hot oil to the food. 
 Pressure has the effect of
increasing the
temperature of the food and oil and because the heat transfer is faster
than in a normal fryer, the frying temperature is higher than in a
normal deep-fat fryer. A further effect of the pressure is to rapidly
seal the outside of the chicken, keeping moisture in and excess grease
out. This along with the flavour coating is what makes southern-style
fried chicken so crisp and moist compared to chicken cooked in a
standard deep-fat fryer. 
 Because it is not possible to
inspect the
food as it is being fried, the fryers are computer programmed according
to the product being cooked. The programme can do multi-temperature
cooking during the pressure cycle, to a rapid seal of the food at
first, then a gentler cooking temperature. In a typical chicken
operation, the start oil temperature will be 180 deg C for the first
burst of heat to seal the chicken, then will lower to 145 deg C to cook
the chicken safely through. 
 Most pressure fryers have an
automatic
pressure release and audible signal at the end of the cooking cycle to
tell the cook that the chicken is finished. More advanced models will
also have automated basket lift. 
 Pressure fryers have in-built
filtration systems and a cool spot to collect food debris from frying
prior to filtration. 

 Conveyor
ovens 
 Conveyor
ovens are a cooking tunnel with heating elements above or above and
below with a constantly revolving belt of steel mesh or slats passing
through it. There will be a tray in front of the conveyor for loading
foods and a tray at the rear for received the cooked food. While
popular for high volume pizza production, they can do a wide range of
foods, including steaks, chops, fish, ribs and can gratin dishes such
as lasagne. They can also be used for a flame-grilled production of
burgers. The heat is controllable, but usually it is the speed setting
on the conveyor belt that controls the length of time the food is
subjected to heat. 
 Power source can be gas,
electric or infra-red
and they come as double-decks or triple-decks for high volume
production. The cooking tunnel can be as short as 50cm or more than
twice that length on big ovens. Some also feature a split conveyor belt
with individual speed settings for each half of the conveyor belt so
that two cook times can happen during the same pass-through. 

 Impingers 
 An
impinger is a conveyor oven with a difference. Pressurised hot air is
jetted at food items on the conveyor as it moves through the oven.
Because the jets are positioned to reach the top and bottom of each
food item, the cooking temperature is uniform. The air nozzles apply
hundreds of independent heat jets to the product and the movement of
the conveyor spreads heat uniformly. 
 Manufacturers of impinger
ovens
say the food cooks faster and at a lower temperature because of the
forced hot air. Moisture content is also increased as the hot air
rapidly seals the surface of the food. 

 Rotisseries 
 Rotisseries
are usually associated with chicken, but can also do rolled legs of
lamb, pork and rib beef. They can be sited indoors in a well ventilated
area in view of the customer powered from mains gas or electricity or
outside through a power cable or LPG. 
 They are available in two
configurations–the meat skewered horizontal or hung
vertical. The
horizontal is seen mostly in retail environments, while restaurants go
for the vertical type. While the look to be energy inefficient with the
heat radiating outwards, the curvature of the radiants is designed to
focus the heat on the meat. This also makes for a cooler working
environment for staff. 
 Profits are high on rotisserie
chicken and
the cooking smell of it is a huge selling point, but they are messy to
clean and staff need a strict clean-down routine at the end of a shift. 

 Burger Grills and delivery
systems 
 Burger
grills are compact conveyor grills, usually upright with a gravity feed
system, similar in design to vertical toasters. The table-top versions
will run from a simple 13-amp socket, yet production on even the
smallest grills will be at least one burger a minute. 
 There should
be a means of adjusting the speed of the conveyor and for the thickness
of burger. There should be a fat collection system and a catching tray.
Because of the smoke and cooking smells that come from cooking burgers,
adequate kitchen ventilation is necessary. Burger conveyor grills are
only suitable for frozen burgers, not fresh or chilled. 
 They can be
used in conjunction with burger bun toasters, which operate in much the
same way, but can toast top and bottom of a bun in 18 to 35 seconds,
depending on power. 
 When burgers have been
assembled and put in
colour coded containers, they can be held in burger box chutes. These
are the working bridge between the kitchen and the service team front
of house with back loading and front unloading. Burger chutes can have
from five to 10 or more angled channels so that kitchen staff can keep
every channel topped up for fast dispense at the counter and may be
stacked. They should have heat and light lamps above for enhancing the
display and keep the burger package warm and can have additional
under-box heating.
