Badly Behaved Children (and their parents!)--what do you do?
 Posted by: Carolyn on Mar 29, 99 at 11:34 AM Posted in: United States Jump to last reply Add a Reply Share with a Friend Report Abuse 
In our travels lately, we have noticed that many, many (not all) children don&apos;t know how to behave on an airplane, in a restaurant or hotel, at a pool, etc. Allow me to vent: I don&apos;t remember my children being so ill-behaved; moreover, if they did misbehave, we spoke to them immediately and the problem was solved. Our recent trips to Florida and California have been marred by such children, especially on airplanes, with parents who seem to ignore or encourage rude,loud behavior. The last straw was the couple behind us on a flight last weekend who chose to diaper their 2-year-old at their seats; it was not a wet diaper, but a dirty one, and the odor was soon all over the section. It was all I could do to restrain my husband. I do remember how difficult it is to travel with an infant; that&apos;s not what I&apos;m talking about. How do you handle these situations?

Hey Carolyn,

I know what you mean. Kids now are so bad! If I were you, I&apos;d just tell the kids straight out to stop yelling or better yet..tell the parents. I have done so in the past. The kids/parents get mad but so what! They need to control their brats!
 Report Abuse Rob on Mar 29, 99 at 04:16 PM 
Has anyone noticed that very few people want to accept responsibility for their actions or their kids actions? Considering that adults get drunk and attack flight attendants....what&apos;s a little baby shit? Anyway, please vent ....not that it will do anything but make you feel a little better. We own a B&amp;B in New Orleans and had several tennis pros&amp;their wives rent our place for a weekend. Other friends of theirs (with a 10 year old girl&amp;her 18month old sister) came into town and were staying at another B&amp;B. All the pros and their wives were in their 30s and of course wanted to &quot;play&quot; in New Orleans. They left the 10 year old here at my place to baysit her 18 month old sister. Guess how long before the 10 year old freaks out and is scared? Guess who babysat til 1:00am? Guess who got an earful when they returned at 1:00am. Do you think they gave a damn? No, not at all and were, in fact, indignant that I confronted them. I used to say I thought kids were pretty good in gumbo...but Mom&amp;Dad would&apos;ve been delicious!

I&apos;ve learned to ignore them (the parents and the kids)unless it gets so extreme that I say something to the parents - who invariably don&apos;t care or truly don&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;. The other thing I do (which produces far greater personal satisfaction) is to COMPLIMENT the parents and kids I encounter in my travels when I see kids who behave as we wish they all would.
 Report Abuse Petra on Mar 29, 99 at 10:50 PM 
Thank you for stating that not all children misbehave in public. I am sorry that you have had this experience and I think these parents give all of us a bad reputation. As a mother of two, who travels quite often, I am extremely proud of my children when they travel. They are very well behaved and quiet and have been since we began traveling. Unfortunately, I have encountered more rude adults in my travels than rude children. Once on a cross country flight, a flight attendant accused me of putting a dirty diaper in the galley trash. My son had been asleep the entire flight and I had never even gotten up from my seat. Even the passengers behind me spoke up in my defense, but this flight attendant continued to berate me for the rest of the flight. (Another flight attendant took me aside after the flight and explained that there had been no dirty diaper in the galley after all). I also had to deal with a drunken man on a flight to the Carribbean. He was drunk before take-off and continued drinking throughout our flight. He was vulgar and rude and I had to explain to my children that they should try to ignore him. I also sat next to a older gentleman on a flight who insisted on swearing and screaming at everyone because he was afraid of flying. My point is, there are rude children and there are rude adults. I suppose we have to learn to take it all in stride. Is this enough of an issue to start an argument over, or do we just try to let these things go. I am sorry for your experiences, just as I am sorry for mine. My choice is to not let them bother me and to look forward to the joys of being on vacation!
 Report Abuse stephanie on Mar 29, 99 at 11:41 PM 
Owen&amp;Petra, so very nicely said. I appreciate your comments as another mother of very small children who travel a lot and are very well behaved. It IS sad that the bad ones spoil it for everyone else.

We&apos;ve had nothing but good experiences traveling with our kids, and the people around us have been nothing but kind and understanding.

I try to remember that if I&apos;m going to use public transportation of any sort, or go anywhere public, that I have to share that space with many different people. I can&apos;t decide who else travels on that plane or control what they do. Though THEY TOO should be considerate of the fact that they are sharing the space with others.

We know all too well that airplanes are very small places where children can begin to feel cooped up and feel a lack of control of their environment. Same goes for the parents. There is nowhere to sit a child in &quot;time out&quot; on an airplane. However, I believe that it starts at home. Good behavior and parenting at home should carry over to other situations including travel.

Is it just me or are kids more spoiled, selfish, and disrespecting than before, and parents less willing to follow through with discipline and limitations with their children now than before?

Anyhow, I also try to remember when I&apos;m flying that I&apos;m going on a vacation and that I&apos;m fortunate to be doing so. (And I also pray frequently to make it &quot;there&quot; and for a safe landing!) We have the power to pick our battles, to choose happiness or not.
 Report Abuse Mike on Mar 31, 99 at 05:17 AM 
Grrrrrrrrr that&apos;s what I say about noisy ill behaved rugrats on planes and running all over motels etc. Children are just so vile on the whole. I will never understand why anyone would ever want one of these incrediably noisy, smelly, disruptive, whiny, demanding, ill tempered midgets. Why do you people even want to own one of these things? I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be attacked for staying the truth here but the fact is when Dear Abby asked her readers in a secret poll a few years ago how many people would choose not to have children again if they could to those who already had them in reality, about 75% said they would NOT have the kids if they could live it over. That says alot.

Hey Mike, were you born an adult?

What a lot of people don&apos;t realize is that many parents are held hostage by their kids in public. There is a damned if you do and damned if you don&apos;t element to correcting your children in public. In any situation, if your child is acting up, half of the people around would vote for you to nip it in the bud; however, half of the people would give you a dirty look if you say or do anything. Kids pick up on that, and can use it to get what they want. As a parent, I have found that if you show your children you are not afraid to tell them that they will be grounded (or not get that treat they want)in public -THEN FOLLOW THROUGH, you&apos;ll have very few problems.
It seems there is a level of intoleration toward children - badly behaved or otherwise. That&apos;s a shame!

Mike, you ask why do any of us want to own one of these things? First, I am expecting a child in a few weeks, and last time I checked, I am not going to the store to purchase her. Second, she is not a thing. A thing is an item that can be discarded. Maybe you were lacking something in childhood and were commonly referred to as a thing...

How about if we all ignore &quot;Mike&quot; and any postings by people who employ his tactics? The tone of his message and it&apos;s confrontational qualities are suspiciously similar to messages posted last year on this forum. Fodor&apos;s was ultimately able to deal with the problem and the &quot;trash&quot; postings stopped but COMPLETELY ignoring cretans like this is usually an effective tactic. They (he) are looking for a fight - let&apos;s not lend any credibility to their argument by responding.
 Report Abuse martha on Mar 31, 99 at 03:33 PM 
Until I read that his screed was part of a pattern of obnoxious behavior, I assumed that Mike was just satirizing crotchety adult behavior. Wow.
I think Carolyn&apos;s original question is a good one, and the vehemence of the posts responding to it illustrates the problem. Yes, children need some accommodation, and yes, adults can be plenty obnoxious. But when adults are being hideous, you can decide whether to deal with them and do so. When a child is misbehaving, talking to them is usurping a parent&apos;s role (or what should be a parents role, tho&apos; many seem to have abandoned it), and the parent&apos;s response is likely to be to turn on you rather than insist the child shape up. Sometimes parents just don&apos;t realize that what the kid is doing bothers you, amazing as that can be in some cases. But a lot of parents seem to tolerate much wilder behavior than my siblings and I were ever allowed to indulge in. Reprimand their precious spawn and you&apos;re the bad guy. Now you&apos;ve got two problems instead of one.
 Report Abuse April on Apr 1, 99 at 02:57 AM 
Well maybe Mike wouldn&apos;t have that attitude if more parents would &apos;parent&apos; their children. I had one kid kick the back of my airplane seat throughout a nine hour flight although we repeatedly asked the mother to DO something. The other day in a line-up several kids in different families ran around and yakked, loudly, the whole time. What were the parents doing all the while? Ignoring or encouraging the behaviour as if they had to win their child&apos;s approval and admiration. (No I did not act like this at that age.) It&apos;s not a dislike of children I&apos;m talking about, but rude behaviour by anyone. Maybe it&apos;s time to stop avoiding the issue - maybe the next time you should not hold your husband back!

There is a film all about people travelling in Europe called &quot;Two for the Road&quot; (made in the late 60s starring Audrey Hepburn) that shows just how children traveling often are. Check it out at a video store to see what I have seen in real life many many times both with strangers kids and relative&apos;s kids. This kid in the film is like the ones I have so often seen: screams that she is hungry then refuses to eat then says 2 minutes after leaving the resturant that she&apos;s hungry. Demands very toy and candy in sight and has temper tamptrums until she gets them.
Constantly interrupts adults who are trying to talk. Shreaks, cries and shouts at unbelievable volume levels. Jumps up and down kicking and twisting for very long time periods. And does all this in public with neither she/he nor the parents caring one twit. The parents just sit there smoking, watching tv or talking on the phone and meanwhile others including many strangers have to live with this hellion in their midsts.
Why do you people with children think everyone else should like to have their trips
invaded by something like this?
 Report Abuse ilisa on Apr 1, 99 at 08:45 AM 
This may come as a surprise, Opal, but there are many parents that do not think other people should have their trips invaded by rude, ill-behaved children. To lump all parents into one category is very irresponsible.

Is this a travel forum or a hate forum? I usually enjoy this site, but this is terrible. While we are on this topic I have a queation. Is there a changing table on most airplanes? I have never needed to change an infant on a flight, but the last time I used a the bathroom on one it was a tiny little closet. As far as unruly children are concerned, have you ever offered to help? Often parents feel helpless and are doing the best that they can. An airplane is a confined area, and options are minimal. I have been lucky when traveling with my small children. I usually fly when they will sleep. I also bring food and books to help keep them busy. If a child is in pain(ears) unfortunalty there is not alot you can do to stop the crying. That&apos;s the breaks. Children are our Future, let&apos;s try and be more positive.

Several of the parents who have posted on this site refuse to acknowledge that some kids are not just being kids--they&apos;re being obnoxious. Perhaps they could all wear Whitney Houston pins when they travel. Then, when some brat is kicking the back of your seat for hours, you can ask the Whitney Houstonite to change seats with you.
I&apos;ll be wearing a Judith Martin (&quot;Miss Manners&quot;) pin. Mike will probably go for an Ezzo/Babywise pin.

We just got back from a cross country trip (Baltimore to SF and back) and were lucky to have both flights filled with well-behaved families and even shared our row with a charming 3rd grade boy traveling between his divorced parents&apos; homes. I emphasize with parents traveling - to a point. When our kids were little we were &quot;lucky&quot; that they were quite well-behaved. Of course we tried not to put them in a position where they&apos;d be prone to causing problems: no &quot;grown up&quot; restaurants or resorts. Some people are so silly to think that little Jennifer and Taylor are going to be smitten as they are with elegant surroundings. Kids could care less. They want PB&amp;J, or grilled cheese sandwiches (on Wonderbread, not some 9-grain wonder with thick chewy crust). We simply waited until they were old enough to appreciate it AND to appreciate that others got a kick out of their grown-up manners. Sure, it meant more vacations at Grandma&amp;Grampas, or just the beach (not the Caribbean), but we have some great family times to remember. And now that they are older and have been on more sophisticated trips too, I think they will know how to travel with their own kids someday.

I knew I&apos;d be sorry if I opened this one up and read it, and I&apos;ll probably be sorry if I ANSWER too, but here goes!

Nineteen years ago when I had my first child and starting taking her out in public, the first thing I noticed is that NEVER have I EVER had another job at which so many perfect strangers felt free to comment and critique my performance! I don&apos;t actually mind, because I enjoy chatting with people (obviously), but people seem to be very opinionated where children are concerned, and also I think some of them have selective memories. My mother-in-law, for example, used to tell me that her children NEVER fought, she didn&apos;t understand WHY mine would argue, etc!

I think that the reason many, many children may not know how to behave is that many, many adults don&apos;t know how to either. I am FAR more often annoyed in public places by the behaviour of boorish, selfish, obnoxious adults than by that of children. I am FAR better able to tolerate a child kicking my seat on a plane than I am sitting behind some long-haired adult who has reclined his seat into my lap (although I don&apos;t really like to sit near either). I am FAR more annoyed by drunken adults around the pool than by rowdy children--and why sit close to the edge in any case if you don&apos;t want to get splashed?

Really, though, I wish everyone would remember that on this crowded little planet we should learn tolerance and respect for each other, whatever age we are, and then maybe everyone would behave more pleasantly in public. This isn&apos;t really an age issue, but rather involves learning how to behave suitably in all the various circumstances in which we find ourselves.
 Report Abuse Dee on Apr 6, 99 at 02:19 PM 
Wow! Obviously a touchy subject. Having just come back from a cruise with 5 adults and 6 kids (ages 10 thru 18), I can identify with both sides of this story.
There were times I was extremely proud of my two, not because they behaved like Miss Manners graduates, but because they looked soooo good compared to their older cousins! I was mortified by how my nieces and nephews acted from the moment we got on a plane, all through the cruise, and on the way home. And yes, I let them and their parents know. (You can imagine how well received I will be at the next family gathering!) And I encouraged and praised mine everytime I saw behavior that was appropriate and thoughtful.
But in fairness, I also saw my adult family members acting in embarassing ways, too. I suspect I must be getting to be an &quot;old fogey&quot;, well on my way to becoming a cranky old woman!
Travel with kids is never easy.

Children will be children, but it is never too early to teach them manners. But then again, the children who don&apos;t have manners usually have the type of parents who have NO clue when NOT to bring their kids. These are the people who are insulted if their 4 year old twins are not invited to a black-tie, adults only, Saturday night wedding. These are the people who think that WHATEVER their kid does is adorable, despite how it affects others (sticky fingers all over your luggage, pulling food out of your grocery cart). Maybe this is why the saying &quot;the apple doesn&apos;t fall far from the tree&quot; is so popular. The only exception to the behavior rule should be for kids with special problems. And in that case, please figure out BEFORE you leave the house whatever it will take to keep your kid amused. Contrary to what Amy says, it is not my job to entertain someone else&apos;s kids. May sound cold, but I travel for business and do not need Sunny Delight all over my laptop.
 Report Abuse Warren on Apr 8, 99 at 12:48 PM 
I had ten years of childless time to spend with my wife on travel to many exotic places, and saw a variety of good and bad behaviors exhibited by children and adults alike. I am also a teacher who has seen a wide range of attitudes about respect and responsibility in adolescents. Speaking from experience, now that I am helping to raise three children (ages 4,2, and 1), I&apos;ve found that parents can avoid most of the offending behaviors with a little planning and foresight, but that many are just lazy or sloppy. We pick and choose which vacations to take our kids on based upon their chances for an enjoyable experience (either being left behind or taking them), but feel compelled to take one child no matter what based on her night terrors that only my wife and I can ease, so remember always that their are circumstances that you are not aware of, so tolerance is the key. Remember, time is relative, and a plane flight is a mere moment in time that can be quickly forgotten once you deplane. In other words, deal with it, file it away in your worst experiences cabinet, and get over it. I can&apos;t understand why people prefer to wallow in their percieved misery rather than focus on something positive. And Mike, I hope you somehow find your way onto the next &quot;flight 800&quot;.

I&apos;ve followed this fascinating thread for the past week without adding my own two cents worth (posting, &quot;this is why God invented business class,&quot; hardly seemed to be much of a contribution). But then I was reminded of two cross-country flights I made recently.

Like most business travelers, my instructions to my corporate travel agent are succinct and to the point: put me as far forward in the plane as possible. The chance of encountering an infant increases exponentially as you move toward the rear of the cabin. On a flight from LA to Washington, however, I found that the seat behind mine was occupied by a boy of perhaps eight or nine, clearly unaccompanied, definitely fidgeting, loud irritating video game at the ready. Having endured a child pounding his feet into the back of my seat a few weeks earlier, I began scouting the plane for an alternate seat.

But something remarkable happened on this flight. The guy in the seat next to the young boy began talking to him. They talked about the aerodynamics of the 777, the difference between nimbus and cumulus clouds, and the latest video games. They talked from LA to the Great Plains, and then the child fell asleep. Their conversation resumed after lunch and, when the plane touched down at Dulles, they were still finding common points of interest.

I made a point of seeking out and thanking that Good Samaritan on the bus back to the terminal, and he said it wasn&apos;t the first time he had befriended an unaccompanied child on a flight. &quot;I used to hit the attendant call button the first time a kid misbehaved,&quot; he told me. &quot;But what&apos;s the stewardess going to do? Bind and gag a five-year-old? I tried talking, and it worked.&quot;

A few weeks later, I found myself seated next to a mother and daughter on another long flight. The child started jumping up and down as soon as the plane took off. The mother seemed to accept that as standard behavior. Words were exchanged and I was told that &quot;they&apos;re all like that at that age.&quot; And so I tried talking to the girl, using the games on my laptop as a diversion. Soon the little girl (aged 5 as it turned out) was captivated. Incredibly, this annoyed the girl&apos;s mother, who now wanted her daughter to &quot;come be with mommy.&quot; Ten minutes later, the girl was jumping in her seat again. Out came my laptop as a diversion. This time, the mother cut me off at the pass: &quot;I&apos;ve carefully taught my daughter not to talk to strangers,&quot; she said, curtly. &quot;Don&apos;t try to undermine that.&quot;

I wish there were a clear-cut moral to the story -- one passenger intervenes and spares a dozen fellow passengers from five hours of hell; another passenger intervenes and gets a lecture on pedophilia - but there isn&apos;t. I like to think that most parents would prefer that their children sit quietly on board a plane, but are simply resigned to tantrums. Perhaps they&apos;re afraid to discipline their children in front of observers (I recall reading about the arrest of a woman bringing a child back from a Russian orphanage after purportedly being observed enroute striking the child).

What&apos;s that refrain from &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;? &quot;Why can&apos;t they be like we were, perfect in every way; oh, what&apos;s the matter with kids today?&quot;
 Report Abuse ellen on Apr 8, 99 at 07:10 PM 
Again, why can&apos;t parents anticipate the fidgit factor and provide enough of their own distractions? No five year old is going near my laptop! I recall driving from NYC to Orlando with my parents when I was 5 -the OLDEST of 3 of us. My mom had a bag of distractions with her--from coloring books to pipe cleaners. I think the problem here is that most parents today are so used to dumping their kids in front of a video, the tube, or a nanny, that they haven&apos;t a clue how to entertain them for five minutes without the help of Barney. Sorry, if you can&apos;t manage your own children for 5 hours, you get no sympathy here.

After reading the thread on the Europe posting about &quot;fat&quot; passengers, which turns into a discussion similar to this one, I&apos;m bringing it back up again...any further suggestions/comments?

 Report Abuse Karen on Jun 30, 99 at 07:02 PM 
Well . . . I was going to say, too bad we can&apos;t just do what a friend of mine does with his cats when they jump up where they&apos;re not supposed to go -- squirt them with water from a water pistol. He&apos;s able to get them off the kitchen counter from across the room and, other than being a little wet and peeved, no harm is done.

Having said that, I would say that the best workable solution is probably what was already mentioned -- keep the kid distracted and interested in something. Given the short attention spans of alot of kids, have a variety of things to do -- play cards with them; read to them or give them books to read on their own; hand-held video games (with the noise turned off or with the use of headphones); travel-size etch-a-sketch; play Mad-Libs with them; there&apos;s all sorts of portable games that can entertain them and be fun for both of you.

I have also seen beautifully behaved kids too, not just holy terrors, but I&apos;m sad to say more of the latter. One example, of the latter, was in a local restaurant not too long ago. There was a group sitting near us consisting of 2 young couples and one little girl (about 4 years old). The parents were basically ignoring her and she spent alot of time running up and down the aisles of this busy restaurant, whipping around corners at breakneck speed, while the poor waitpersons were trying to dodge her while carrying fully-loaded trays of food and drinks; she was so short that sometimes they couldn&apos;t see her until the last minute. Their waitress kept bringing the little girl back to the table and asking the parents to keep an eye on her, but they would just laugh, agree to do it and then proceed to ignore her again. Every once in awhile they would tell her to stay seated or she&apos;d get no dessert and she&apos;d throw a tantrum and they&apos;d relent. The poor waitress was so busy trying to round up the little girl, that she was unable to give very decent service to the rest of her customers, us included. (Having been a waitress before I felt very sorry for her and gave her a good tip anyway, figuring it was combat pay!). I think restaurants should have a policy that small children must be accompanied by their parents (or whatever adult they are with) when they are away from the table. It is too dangerous to everyone involved to let them run around like that. If they collide with a waitperson carrying a tray, that tray (and hot food and drinks) could fall on the kid or fall on another customer. Not to mention the waitperson could fall and injure themselves in the process. The term &quot;family-friendly restaurant&quot; shouldn&apos;t have to be synonymous with &quot;beware of wild animals on the loose!&quot; My hairdresser&apos;s shop has a policy that if a customer brings a child who is under a certain age there must be another adult present to watch them. It goes on to say that they love children, but that they are not equipped to babysit and there are too many hazards in the shop that could hurt those children. They were afraid at first that they might lose some customers, but their fears were unfounded.

Someone earlier said it seemed that kids are more spoiled and rude today than they used to be. I think that is true to a certain degree, but I have my own opinion as to why that is (just from what I&apos;ve observed with my friends and family). The kids I&apos;ve seen that are the rudest are the ones that have parents who both work very long hours and only have a small amount of &quot;quality time&quot; to spend with them. I&apos;ve been told (by those parents) that they don&apos;t want to spend what little time they have with their kids disciplining them -- they want to have fun and interact in a meaningful way. (In all fairness, this doesn&apos;t seem to apply to those parents who have still managed to provide good childcare, either through a nanny or a caring relative, who takes the time to teach and train the child.) They throw money at them in place of their time. At the same time that they&apos;re giving them all this money, they aren&apos;t teaching them how to save and spend it responsibly -- it&apos;s just &quot;ask and ye shall receive&quot;. If the kid throws a tantrum, they bribe him to be quiet -- thus they&apos;ve taught him that if he throws a fit he&apos;ll get a reward. I&apos;ve seen very polite and wonderful people with very rude and ill-mannered kids; it&apos;s not always rude parents raising rude kids. I think they mean well but don&apos;t have the time or patience to teach a child to be polite and well-behaved.

An example of kids that are wonderful to be around . . a friend of mine has three little boys that are alot of fun and are usually very well-behaved in public and to the guests in their home. They say please and thank you (and are reminded to do so if they forget) and they even write thank-you notes for the gifts we give them (we got a particularly gushing and effusive one from the 13-year old for his last birthday gift -- I almost wanted to frame it!) I&apos;ve watched her with them. She&apos;s very firm, very consistent (they never get to get away with being rude or cruel to others) but she still maintains a sense of humor with them. She doesn&apos;t hit or &quot;scare&quot; them into behaving but she does follow through if she says they&apos;ll be grounded, get no dessert, etc. Yes, they do test the limits periodically (they&apos;re not total saints or angels all the time), but she&apos;s made it very clear -- with her actions and her words -- that tantrums will never get them what they want (and will only get them punished on top of that). And above all, she respects them in return and treats them the way she wants them to treat others. I sure hope I&apos;m as patient and consistent as she is when I become a parent. It&apos;s gotta be the hardest job out there and I have nothing but admiration for those who do it well. Part of it is &quot;luck of the draw&quot; too. Some kids have better temperments than others, it&apos;s all part of being human. some are shy, some outgoing; some hyper, some calm.

My advice is to learn to breathe deeply and count to ten (yes, it sucks that it has come to this). Or, sedate yourself (name your poison). Or, have some drinks and see if the parents of the offending child mind if you use colorful expletives and wild profanity around them. Or, use a friend of mine&apos;s quote &quot;control your children...or I will&quot;.

Was I a hellion as a child? Yes. Did I act out in public or in enclosed areas? No. Why? Because my Mom would &quot;tan my hide&quot;. Did sitting me down and logically explaining to me why some action was wrong change further actions? No. Most children today have are not disciplined. And, babysitters are not used anymore. &quot;Time outs&quot;? Give me a break. Most children do not have a developed sense of remorse. Like an animal that doesn&apos;t know why the flame burns the nose, but it has learned not to get near it.
 Report Abuse Cindy on May 25, 00 at 03:33 PM 
I promised I wouldn&apos;t revive this thread, but I can&apos;t help it.

I have three young children. I have a few thoughts based on my experience for people who are annoyed by children misbehaving in public.

Please understand that a parent with a child who is &quot;melting down&quot; has very few options. Striking the child is out. Strangers will really let you have it for that, and hitting a child never stops them from crying. Time-outs are impractical; where can you give a kid a time-out on a plane? Taking away privileges, bribing, distractions? Sometimes they work, but usually not. Sure, it would be better to plan differently and prevent the outburst, but that is just hindsight. Obviously, I am the last person who wants my kid to lose it in public. It is humiliating, and I am still scarred due to certain child-related debacles years ago.

So what can you child-free folks do to help when a child is simply misbehaving? You&apos;ll be surprised by this suggestion, but talk directly to the kid. Don&apos;t talk to me. Telling me &quot;You really should do this and that and the other thing&quot; doesn&apos;t help when I&apos;m trying figure out how to get some control over the situation. Just look the kid in the eye and, using a normal adult authoritative voice (not one of those sing-song Sesame Street voices), say something like, &quot;Honey, you should go sit down. You might get hurt if you run around in here,&quot; or &quot;Excuse me. Could you please stop kicking my seat. It is keeping me awake.&quot; No kidding; this is really helpful. A few times, someone has done this to one of my kids. And do you know what? My kid straightened up mighty quick. That is because they are surprised, they are not used to tuning out authoritative non-parental adults, and they are embarrassed. They never forget it, particularly after I lecture them about it afterward. I think the chance that the parent will take you to task is minimal. And so what if they do? Maybe they&apos;ll learn something.

I know. It&apos;s not your job to discipline my kid. But just know that there are parents out there who really do want their kids to behave, and some of us welcome all the help we can get.
 Report Abuse lisa on May 25, 00 at 05:19 PM 
Cindy -- That is the most rational, thoughtful, helpful suggestion on this topic that I&apos;ve seen in a long time. And you are right -- kids are usually so surprised that a stranger is speaking to them that they just sort of stare quietly for a while. And I do think it helps make kids aware of the effect that their actions have on others, which ultimately makes them more empathic and at an earlier age. However, not all parents welcome having strangers speak to their children. One similar technique that some friends of mine (who also have three kids) have found works wonders is this -- when their child is acting up, for example, in a grocery store or restaurant -- the parent will either pick the child up or kneel down -- so that the parent and the child are at the same level -- and the parent will point to other people nearby in the store and say in a normal tone, &quot;Look, Janie, look at all the people staring at you. All those people are listening to you and it&apos;s bothering them. They can&apos;t do their shopping because you&apos;re making so much noise. They&apos;re wondering what&apos;s wrong with you and it&apos;s embarrassing me.&quot; For some reason, it seems to help quiet the child. They said they learned this technique in Japan (before they were married), where they observed that the primary way that Japanese mothers got their children to behave was by pointing out to the child the effect the child&apos;s behavior was having not only on other strangers nearby, but also on the parent (focusing on the embarrassment factor). It&apos;s honest, it&apos;s direct, and it makes the kid think for a minute. I&apos;m not saying it works with all kids or in every situation (nothing does), but it&apos;s one more tool to add to the woodshed.

Good heavens! You would change a soiled diaper in your airplane seat in front of God and everyone? You would funk up half the plane because you can&apos;t figure out how to change a diaper in a restroom?

It is not easy, but here&apos;s how I do it. For small babies, you bring extra blankets for this purpose and lay them on a few blankets on the floor, or you use a stiff changing pad on top of the toilet. (There was one attached to my diaper bag). For larger kids, you stand them up and do the best you can.

Many years ago, the movie theatre patrons behind me changed their baby&apos;s soiled diaper right there in the theatre. They left the dirty diaper on the floor. I can still remember the film -- it was &quot;Quest for Fire.&quot; The smell was awful. Was that you?

To Cindy: Why should other passengers &quot;parent&quot; your child and tell them to sit down or stop kicking the seat? That&apos;s YOUR job. Sounds like you are handing off the responsibility for your children&apos;s behavior and discipline to those around you, which is what most people here are complaining about - parents who refuse to &quot;parent.&quot;
 Report Abuse Cindy on May 25, 00 at 08:50 PM 
I am not asking that anyone parent my child for me. I am talking about situations in which the parent is trying but failing, or isn&apos;t trying. In that situation, victims of the child&apos;s behavior have limited choices. One choice (the most popular choice) is to suffer in silence, maybe with a few glares. Another choice is to attack the parent. Rarely effective.

Another choice that I think is underutilized is to treat the kid the way you might treat an adult who is doing something that you don&apos;t like and that they clearly shouldn&apos;t be doing -- just inform them that what they are doing bothers you. If someone were smoking in a theatre, I would ask them to stop. If a child has his or her feet on the back of my seat in a theatre, I just ask them to remove their feet. If you don&apos;t want to be assertive in this fashion, then don&apos;t. But the original post asked what you can do when the situation has already gotten pretty bad. Parents are not perfect, and sometimes they blow it. Under those circumstances, I think my solution is a decent one.

I think that a major problem is that parents just don&apos;t discipline their children anymore - it&apos;s not &quot;politically correct.&quot; Has anyone ever read the book &quot;To Train Up A Child&quot;? I have several friends who have raised their children this way and they are the happiest, most well-behaved children that I&apos;ve ever been around. I also have friends who use the passive method (i.e. &quot;Johnny, don&apos;t do that.&quot; &quot;Johnny, don&apos;t do that.&quot; &quot;Johnny, don&apos;t do that.&quot; Johhny continues and the parents just ignore him or give him &quot;time out.&quot;), and their children are poorly behaved and generally whiners.
 Report Abuse Mom24 on May 26, 00 at 10:00 AM 
I think today&apos;s parents tend to be their kids &quot;buddy&quot; instead of being a parent. Kids need to be taught discipline, manners and socialization skills. Another problem I see is parents who are totally oblivious to their kids when they get around other adults. I knew someone who was so busy yakking that she ignored her kid. No wonder the poor kid started whining and carrying on. As for parents flying with children, if your kid can&apos;t behave in public you should not expose others to your unruly child. If you are flying make sure you take the first flight out as kids get crankier later in the day and delays are much more likely. And use a car seat on the plane, that prevents the littler ones from kicking the back of the seat and is much safter than just having them belted in. Let your child run around before you board the plane to work off excess energy. And if some kid is kicking the back of your seat either say something to the parents or the flight attendants. Don&apos;t sit there and stew.

I wouldn&apos;t have had my baby ALONG in a movie theater! But no, I don&apos;t think it is incumbent on parents to pack a BLANKET that they are willing to put on the FLOOR of an airplane bathroom--where I often hesitate to place my feet--so they can avoid the possibility of offending.

Hey, all of you whiny parents that want to excuse the poor behavior of your kids and yourselves...boo hoo...I&apos;m a parent myself and can fully relate to how kids can take over if you allow them to. I&apos;m embarrased at my generation (early 30&apos;s) who all want to be friends with their children and not be a PARENT to them. That&apos;s not what a child is looking for from you. Did all of you forget how you were raised? Yeah, I was a pain in the ass when I was a kid, but know what, there were consequences for my screw ups and eventually I learned that the misbehaviors weren&apos;t worth the punishments. I&apos;d have been on my way to the E.R. if I were dancing on the walls of American Indian ruins in AZ as I have witnessed kids do many times in front of their parents. I have a million other examples of that type of behavior, as well. Older adults just look at this parental neglect (and that&apos;s what it is) and shake their heads. If you love your children as I do, you care enough to try to make them be considerate human beings instead of indulging them with their every whim. You&apos;re really preparing them well for the rest of their lives . On the other side of this, my hats off to all of those who teach their kids manners and give them discipline...they&apos;ll appreciate you more than the kids who laugh with their friends at what chumps their folks are...

And there was a baby in the balcony that screamed and cried on and off throughout the whole play. A play..not a movie with live actors. Actors who I am sure heard this baby crying loud and long and often. No one removed this baby when it cried and this happened at the play that started at 8pm and ran till almost 11pm (with intermission). We were in the main floor but at times we couldn&apos;t even hear the dialogue it was so bad. There were no ushers at the theatre although I don&apos;t know if that would have helped.
Our tickets were $20 each plus tax and we missed much of the play because of this infant and its inconsiderate parents.

Sorry everyone but the problem is worldwide! Over here in England much the same seems to happen all over the place, restaurants and all sorts of public area&apos;s. Attitudes from pupils in schools also show that the problem is not going to go away. Yes, it&apos;s the parents, but it&apos;s also our society today. How many restaurants etc are &quot;family&quot; orientated? They offer play areas and such for the children to indulge in whilst waiting for their meal and whilst waiting for their parents to finish their meals. What happened to learning to sit and talk and WAIT for their food and wait whilst others finished their meals. In trying to give our children more freedom to become themselves - or whatever the excuse was - we seem to have turned them into &quot;I don&apos;t have to - I know my rights - get a life&quot; monsters. Having said that when you come across some nice, polite children all faith in humanity returns and there may be hope for the future. Meantime, I will keep trying with my two and thank the people who take time to comment on their good behaviour (and smile at my glares and growls when they step out of line)and continue to take them out and teach them to become and remain socially acceptable.

To the B&amp;B person that watched the 2 children until 1 am, you should have called the police, even if its bad for business. Most states have laws that children under 12 may not babysit younger siblings. In Delaware that&apos;s call child neglect. Do you think this is the last time these sperm and egg donors will do this to their offspring (notice they aren&apos;t father and mother). Regarding the airline stuff, I would complain to the flight attendant if I was that bothered by children sitting near me with crap in their pants for hours or being very noisy, kicking my seat etc. You should of course try to reason with the parents first. You could always ask the flight attendant to move them to the back of the plane or the baggage hold or something. Have fun.

How can we expect children to be well behaved, courteous and disciplined when the majority of them spend their days being kenneled like dogs in daycare? Instead of valuable time with their parents, they spend wasted hours parked in a center with overworked, underpaid caregivers whos basic mission is to keep them all alive until Mom or Dad picks them up?

These daycare children arent allowed the privilege of spending time with a PARENT who loves them and cherishes them, who teaches them, who enriches them.

I honestly do not understand these people who care so callously about their childs wellbeing. I have had 3 children and I could never ever part with them for so many hours a day, trusting a virtual stranger to care for my children in the same manner as I would. I see so much of this. I see sad, disconnected, ill-behaved kids with no routine to their lives, no comfort of home and parents, kids that are afraid to attach to anyone or is it that they are unable? I dont blame the children ever, I blame the parents for their neglect. To me, its abuse to leave a child in a center for 8+hours a day.

So where would children learn any type of discipline or manners or learn that behaviors have consequences? Raising children isnt all that difficult of a task, all it takes is commitment, love, and TIME. You cant raise them, teach them, influence them, soothe them if you arent the one with them.

WildHoney,

I suppose you make a good point, but it really only applies to a perfect world. Let&apos;s face it: it is really hard to make ends meet on one salary. No kidding. Plus, the areas you can afford on one ordinary non-professional salary are often not the safest places to raise kids. There are also a lot of single-parent homes, and of course they have to use daycare. Throw in the precarious position a family is in when relying on one breadwinner, and the near total lack of a meaningful economic safety net should something go wrong, and you have a lot of parents working.

I wish all kids had a committed parent at home also. I also wish all kids had good healthcare. I wish all kids had good schools. But that is not the world we live in right now. So instead of being hostile toward working parents, I just thank my lucky stars that I have the opportunity to stay home with my kids. It took us years to get ourselves in a position to make it possible. I sure am the envy of my working mom friends, because trying to be a good mom and good employee at the same time is no picnic.

Second, bring a NEW surprise, but quiet, toy. Keeps them occupied. Third, sup early so your family will interupt fewer people. Fourth, ask for seating away from the center of the room. Fifth, have good manners and leave with a badly behaved child. I have had to do this once. As an aside, let us also hold adults to good behaviour.

When they are decorating cupcakes to surprise Dad...I am there. When they desperately need the latest McDonalds toy gimmick...its me who shares Happy Meals with them. When they misbehave...I discipline/teach them. When they question one of life&apos;s many mysteries....I answer them. When they come home from school hot and hungry and tired...I am the one with lemonade and muffins and an ear to listen intently to them.

Now, unless you are a single mom or your husband is disabled, I cant see any reason at all why you and your husband cant make the same sacrifices and adjust your finances to allow you to be your child&apos;s mom. It seems financially impossible until you sit down with the calculator and work it up. For us, it was an investment in our children&apos;s wellbeing. Money well spent, or in this case not spent. Its been 8 wonderful yrs and we havent starved or had our home/car repossessed yet. By the way, we live in a great metropolitan area in the Southeast and my husband earns $60k a yr as an engineer. It just takes good sense, commitment to your family.

Even if we had to live in a mobile home...we would do what was right for my kids and no caregiver can do more for them than I do. I am the one they want and need, not a stranger being paid to keep them safe.

For the record: I quit my job when 3 months into my first pregnancy. It was a conscious decision between my husband and I, we couldnt fathom the idea of daycare, this was AFTER we visited 4 centers to see what they were like as I had a job that pulled in over $35k/yr. We took a serious cut in income, we adjusted our spending habits. We consolidated debts, we cut up credit cards. Sold the new car and bought a 4yr old used mini van. That was 9 yrs ago. Guess what? We havent starved yet, our mortgage gets paid on time each month, we dont shop for clothes at Good Will, and we have even squeaked in a vacation or two.

Whats more important than how we pay bills and spend less money is the fact that our life is very good! We have a strong marriage and 3 very happy children. And I am very happy to know that my children have spent the first years of their life with ME. I was there for all of it. Good and bad, I was there. Our home is a safe and secure, loving constant for them. Not just the place they sleep and change clothes when daycare is closed.

Childhood years are a small amount of time in relation to our entire lifetimes, and believe me...I will go back to work when my time of mothering them is past. I will have no regrets that I missed out on precious, irretrievable and formative years of my childrens lives. And hopefully, my children will understand and appreciate that I was here with them instead of working in a law office.

Dont give me that self-centered whiney argument that your children are kenneled everyday cuz you have to work to pay for the groceries. That just is NOT the case in 90% of daycare children families. I live in suburbs of a major city and I see the kinds of cars and very well dressed parents that are dropping off babies and toddlers at 3 different daycare centers that I pass while I am carpooling my children to school. These are not parents who look to be working so they can pay the next electric bill or for the weeks grocery money.

Just as my husband and I made a decision to be the very people that raise, teach, love, support, influence, and guide our kids, other parents make the decision to gamble with the wellbeing of their children by placing them in daycares, pretending that the caregivers making $7/8 per hour will love their child in the same soft, gentle, loving, nurturing, patient way that they themselves do. Yeah right.

Do you not ever wonder about the influences that are imposed on your kids by virtual strangers? If you were 3-4yrs old, what would you prefer...time spent at home with YOUR mom, YOUR toys, YOUR bed, YOUR siblings, YOUR yard, YOUR pals, YOUR pet...or time spent in an institution where you are not nurtured and cherished, but just kept safe/fed until your parents come and get you?

I was only saying that if parents dont take the time to raise their children, then how can these children possibly have any manners or understanding of consequences to behaviors in social settings?

Mom:

I beg to differ when you say its nearly impossible for a family to live on one salary. Its all relative to the amount of that one salary and the commitment the parents make to having a parent home with the kids. My husband is in engineering, when I quit working he was making just under $50k. He took on consulting/networking jobs on the side when we needed more cash. When my son needed independent speech therapy at $160/week, I took a part-time evening job just to make that money for a year. It was as important to my husband that I was home with the kids as it was to me. We live in a very comfortable and SAFE suburb of a capitol city in a southeastern state. Our home cost $85k in 1990 and we have not moved yet. We like our 1990 sized mortgage payment. While its only 1700sq.ft, its a great house in a great neighborhood.

ROFL @ Julie who claims that kids who stay home with parents are the most ill-behaved. Too funny. What statistics do you have that prove this? Talk to some elementary teachers and they will tell you differently. I never said kids raised by their parents dont act up, I said that those parents are not afraid to discipline/teach and correct them. My kids are certainly not spoiled brats who think the world revolves around them. I have not taught them that. I have taught them to be grateful, appreciative, honest, and compassionate. They are good kids who know that me and their Dad loved them more than we loved the new cars or the new furniture, or the fastest computers, or the trips to WDW or the big new house under construction. How dare you make such a statement condemning parents who have committed and sacrificed EVERYTHING for the wellbeing of their children.

I never said that daycare be abolished. I only wish that it was used judiciously in situations already mentioned here that dictated the need for daycares.

It sounds like you are teaching your children lots of important things. That is good.

While you are at it, please don&apos;t forget to teach them other important things: how to avoid being judgmental, sanctimonious and condescending. Also, you might mention to them that it is exceptionally crass to disclose one&apos;s income, financial position, and the value of one&apos;s home to a huge number of strangers who really don&apos;t even care.

Good luck with that. It appears that this will be a daunting challenge for you.

Thanks for the clarity.

I implore you...ask your daughter if she prefers her kennel, oops...I mean daycare institution over her own home and mom on a daily basis. Ask her straight out if she prefers your paycheck and the material things it buys over your mothering and nurturing and spending time with her. Dont you dare tell me you dont have a way to be there with her and adjust your budget. No one said the options would be easy,you think it was easy for me to give up almost half our income and clip coupons and shop garage sales and drive a used van? You have just chosen to push your daughter off on on someone else for 8+hours a day. So sad. Think of what you spend on daycare, extra medical bills associated with the germs that are continually rotated thru the center, your wardrobe/drycleaning/lunches, your transportation. YOu know...if you dont work, its quite possible you can make do with one car even. There is always a way, you just have to be enlightened enuf to see it or seek it out.

I didnt start this thread, but I am perfectly within my rights to reply to it without being harshly directed by you, a guilty working mom, to take my comments somewhere else to share with other very unhappy, guilty working parents and be attacked by them.

I only offered up my opinion here thats its these indulgent parents who already suffer the severe guilt of not being with their kids except for dinner/bath/bed/forced to for illness and its these parents who dont discipline their children or teach them appropriate ways to behave or give them CONSTANT and CONSISTENT routines/disciplines (how can you possibly do that when a stranger takes care of your kids 8+hrs a day?) or make them behave becuz they dont want to be percieved by their kids as harsh and mean. Its those children kenneled in daycares that I feel are the spoiled ones allowed to kick the seats on airplanes, run thru shops, airports, lobbies uncontrolled, cry and whine loudly till they are appeased, make nasty and inappropriate scenes in restaurants and shopping centers...all without a parent making it clear to them that they either stop or there will a consistent and fair consequence. Perfect example: 3 days ago I took my children to Burger King for lunch. Sitting near us were 2 moms in business suits with babies in high chairs. Must have been the rare lunch outside the daycare. The moms just chatted on in their own world, the babies smeared ketchup, hollered, spilled drinks, threw food, kicked, touched people walking near them. Never once did one of those moms intervene in the childs behavior or take a moment to acknowledge the kids presence. We are talking about kids about 1yr old. This is what leads to kids who have no clue how to restrain or behave or control themselves. They are never TAUGHT these things. Its anything goes until you get the ketchup on Mommy, then your hand is slapped. I tell you...it was sickening, depressing and sad and I wanted so badly to tell these spoiled moms just that. Instead, I packed up my childrens trash, and played with them at a nearby park...cherishing them even more.

ilisa...take your guilt and your request for me to pay your bills and shove it hon. You are not a victim that needs rescuing. You are just self-centered and selfish and obstinate. Good luck to your daughter. Maybe she is better off in the kennel. Oh and in reply to you stating that you do all the things I do during a routine day of mothering/teaching/nurturing just that you do them in the evenings...why do you think your daughter only needs that stuff part-time? Do you only require part-time love and attention? ilisa...have a chat with your little girl and see what she feels about Mommy dumping her every morning while Mommy goes to work.

You are prime example of why daycare was established, and a stark contrast to others who use daycare when its not needed. Congrats to you. By the way, it would be my opinion that daycare did not mold your children or teach them to be restrained and behaved or help with their good grades...that all came from YOU. Kudos to you for making the system work. I never condemned daycares as a whole, only the parents using it for misguided, selfish reasons.

Everybody, I don&apos;t know what WildHoney is talking about. She makes it sound like staying at home is the perfect existence. I chose to stay home, and I feel like I miss out on plenty. I worry about who will hire me once my skills have 15 years of rust on them. I worry about what will happen if something happens to my husband or his job. My kids make me crazy sometimes. I guess if your goal is to claim working moms are scum, I guess you have to build staying home into something it isn&apos;t. I&apos;m not whining, and maybe everything I said is obvious, but I just thought you all might appreciate hearing from someone who isn&apos;t apparently about to lose her mind.

And WildHoney, maybe you can get a decent house in a nice area for under $100,000 in the South where you are, but you&apos;ll be in a pretty undesireable area if you try to find that where I am. Also, if your husband is an engineer, of course you can afford to stay home. If your husband was a teacher making $25,000, you&apos;d be singing a different tune, and you&apos;d probably be doing it from your job outside of the home.

It is all very simple. If you communte 1 hour each way, work 8, and the kids sleep 10, that leaves 4 hours each day to parent your kids, if you work full time. Face it, someone else is raising your kids. Maybe people should be a little more content with less (yes, you can raise a family on one income--our parents did it) Get real, people. The other aspect of this is, the kids are getting horrible fat from too much sitting, (the easiest way to tend them). Pretty selfish if you ask me. I know that a single parent has not choice (absent any family that may be willing to help out) but the parents I know just want two cars, vacations, &quot;things&quot; that they think are necessary.

I dont know about you, but my children were all planned conscious decisions, not accidents. If we couldnt afford the homes where we were at that time, we would have moved somewhere that we could afford. Just in case you think I live in the sticks, I am 10 miles from Duke University. If my hub only earned $25k as a teacher, I would not have children until we had saved enuf money and paid off debts to allow one of us to still stay home and raise our children. Daycare was not an option to us, I was not going to have babies that I myself could not care for. Whats the point? I can tell you, if my husband couldnt support his family while being a teacher, he would not teach, simple as that.


Elizabeth: Attitude has everything to do with how you percieve your situations. I am saddened to hear that staying home with your kids is more of a burden and a personal loss to you than it is a joy. I too have a college degree that is becoming rusty but I dont worry about finding a job because I have confidence and self-esteem. I have also stayed current in my field by taking night classes occasionally. If you stay home with the children, but only resent doing it...they may as well be in the daycare. I sure havent been bored staying home with my kids. When my sons went to preschool, I took a part-time job at the same church preschool working as a teacher assistant. We came together, we left together, it was perfect. Elizabeth, there are many options for you to still feel good and valuable personally if mothering doesnt do it for you. Its not your kids fault that you are unhappy and resentful for having made a choice to raise them.

As far as what my children are doing this morning while I have been cleaning house and browsing on the computer... 2 other moms on my block and I whos kids are great pals often take on the other children, allowing each mom to have some quiet time during the summer. Today was one of my mornings off this summer. Thanks for being so concerned about what my kids were doing. I am assured that they are having a blast at our neighborhood pool playing with their pals.

We have had 4 vacations in 8 yrs, and 2 of those were to visit family. I would love to plan a vacation with you today my dear, but we are saving money this summer for a backyard hot tub this fall. Its been 2 long years that we have saved $ and will have close to enuf by Sept. But you go ahead and plan your vacations, ilisa I am sure that your daughter will grow up thinking that all the neglect was worth the trip to WDW.

Lucky you, Wild Honey, you live in the South where housing costs are reasonable. Now take your husband&apos;s $60K salary, and try to buy a house in San Jose, where $80-$90K software engineers are living in homeless shelters. How about the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, where my brother-in-law was just transferred from (relatively) low-cost Cincinnati -- after MONTHS of searching he just bought a home (an 1800 sq. ft. rambler in immediate need of a new roof and kitchen (no, not granite countertops -- those circa 1950s appliances don&apos;t work anymore) for $400K. The Virginia suburbs are worse from what I hear. My own stay-at-home sister just dropped $400K on a modest, old rambler in a nice (not tony) Chicago suburb, but she can afford it -- her husband is a dot.com executive who never sees the kids.

So, Wild Honey, why don&apos;t you just count your blessings quietly instead of rubbing everyone nose&apos;s in it? Not everyone is fortunate enough to live in an affordable place, or be married to a breadwinner who makes enough money to support them in reasonble means with just one income. Take your negative energy and channel it towards getting better daycare choices for those less fortunate than you (or perhaps mandatory sterlization for those who don&apos;t share your values?)

All of my friends have kids and work. They barely ever see their kids. And when they do, they feel compelled to take them on to the beach as often as possible, to the movies, and out to eat alot. These kids are overindulged and brats. But is it really the kids fault? Oh, did I forget, all these people are in debt up to their ***. So, so much for the 2 people have to work to make it mentality. Oh, I also forgot, these marriages are holding on by a thread. Why? Well lets start with no quality time for the kids, which then means no quality time for the marriage. It is very hard in this day and age, but you have to make choices on what is important, and what are priorities in your life.

That $400K in the Maryland suburbs is in a close-in suburb of DC. My brother-in-law decided that it was important not to commute more than 30 minutes to his demanding job with long hours so he could spend more time with his kids (his wife, incidentally, stays at home); good public schools are also important. Further out suburbs in Maryland mean a hellacious commute, but housing costs are marginally cheaper (but schools are not as good). Easy choices, huh?

I was going to by-pass this thread, but the comments by &quot;Wild Honey&quot; were just too much for me.

I am an only child, and both of my parents worked full-time my entire life. Most people such as &quot;Wild Honey&quot; look at this and automatically think, &quot;spoiled brat&quot;. Sorry, you would be wrong.

My parents both came from large families who &quot;sacrificed&quot;. My father decided he enjoyed the comforts of life - newer home, new cars, regular vacations. These were things he never experienced as a child. Also, such things as going out to nice restaurants, seeing plays, experiencing cultural activities. He and my mother determined that I would know these things and enjoy them. However, I was raised as though I was one of 7 children - I was NEVER allowed to be whiny, ALWAYS had to be respectful of those older than me, ALWAYS taught to &quot;think about the other guy&quot;. I was NEVER allowed to kick a seat in front of me, talk out loud in a movie theater, run wild anywhere but in a park (maybe), or touch other people&apos;s property. Was I a wonderful, no-fault kid? Heck no - but I wasn&apos;t allowed to get away with much. Oh, and trips to ANY fast food restaurant were few and far between. (Dad HATED them and thought they were a waste of time and money)

My discipline, teaching, socialization, nuturing, and caring ALL came from my parents. And you know what else? So did my independence. People I know who were raised in households where mommy was always there to handle &quot;emergencies&quot; grew up having to depend on others. I learned to take care of myself. Today that translates into my being able to travel anywhere in the world I want to, solo, without fear.

And, just so you know, my parents did this in the &apos;60s when leaving your child in daycare was (almost) equivalent to child abuse.

Yes, maybe my parents might have been able to &quot;get by&quot; on one salary. But they didn&apos;t - it was their choice. Do I feel as though I was neglected and pushed away? Hardly! (said with a hardy laugh!) I ALWAYS knew that my wellbeing came first in my parents eyes. They may not have given me every little thing my heart desired, but they gave me the greatest gifts a parent can give a child - their values, their caring, their encouragment, and their love.

(Oh, and when I was older and got sick, mommy didn&apos;t have to stay home with me then, either. She knew I had the sense to know how to handle having a simple cold or flu without crying for &quot;mommy&quot; all the time)

Enjoy your time with your kids. But don&apos;t condemn others for the decisions they make with theirs - it&apos;s really NOT your place to do so!

Most of the people I know who are working are doing so so they can afford the luxuries like hot tubs, European vacations, SUV&apos;s and bigger more expensive homes to impress their friends and relatives! PBS did a show a while back on the dangers of &quot;Affluenza.&quot; Basically the show stated that we Americans have too much stuff, spend too much, ruin the enviroment by all this stuff etc. Look at all the garage sales people are having to get rid of stuff, storage lockers that are springing up to hold our stuff etc. Look at all the stuff you have in your own house that you bought because it was the latest and greatest and now it sits there collecting dust! We are truly spoiled and our kids are suffering because of it! Our kids are getting fatter, less respectful, shooting each other etc. Mothers are working 40+ hours a week, just to pay the mortgage on the big, expensive house to impress everyone. I really think this country needs to get a clue! People in Africa and other countries are STARVING and we throw away food. Diseases are running rampant and people don&apos;t have water! Think about this, when you die how do you want to be remembered?

My wife has completely lost it. She has decided that she isn&apos;t going to work, so she is constantly busting my hump to make more money. And all the while, she is spending her days flaming everyone in a travel lounge while I am slaving away at this boring, life-draining, pathetic little job she made me take. A travel lounge, can you believe that? We don&apos;t even travel, for heaven&apos;s sake!

Oh sure, I had dreams once. I wanted to be a schoolteacher so that I could be a positive influence on children. If I could just make a difference in the education of one child, that would make my life worth living. Maybe one of my students would win the Nobel Prize, all because of me.

But noooooo. WildHoney decided I didn&apos;t make enough money as a schoolteacher, so that wasn&apos;t good enough, so now I am chained to my desk doing pointless work for my pointless boss. She won&apos;t admit it, but I sure would like a vacation now and then. And some savings. And I&apos;d like to get out of this dump that she won&apos;t clean up because of her internet addiction. Nice suburban community my behind!

But no, that will never happen because my wishes mean nothing around here. I have to work so hard that the kids barely know me. Our oldest son Noach is totally bent, and if I have to listen to the two of them fight all the time about who gets to go on the computer and start trouble . . . well, you just might read about it in the papers. So don&apos;t you let her tell you that our lives are perfect, that everyone else is a bad parent, and anyone who disagrees with her is an idiot. I know better.

ENOUGH!!! This has really turned into an ugly debate! If you &quot;ladies&quot; and I use the term loosely, because real ladies do not insult, snipe and flame each other, want to debate either move it off board or find another forum. This is a &quot;Travel Forum,&quot; not a debate forum on wohm/sahm. Please respect the rest of us who come here for TRAVEL advice! Thank you.

Oh, quit your whining, Dad. At least you get to get out of this house all day long. Look at what I have to put up with. Day in and day out. 24/7/365, always claiming she&apos;s the perfect mom. I&apos;m 16, and I think she&apos;d still be nursing me if she thought anyone would be impressed.

Don&apos;t you people listen to a word my mom says. I wish she would get a job so I could have just even a small break from her. &quot;We have everything we need,&quot; she says. &quot;Material things aren&apos;t important,&quot; she says.

Yeah, right. So then how come I don&apos;t have any decent clothes, or a bike, or summer camp, or even any friends? And a college fund? HA! Oh, who cares. I&apos;m going to die from scurvy anyway, what with all of the beans and rice I get around here. That&apos;s all I have learned how to cook. My mom sure doesn&apos;t do any cooking around here. She&apos;s always on that darn computer, just typing away. I practically have to push her out of the way to use the computer for my homework.

But some day, I&apos;ll get a chance to run my own life. And I am going to make some serious coin so that my family doesn&apos;t have to suffer the way I did. And Mom&apos;s not getting a dime!

Uh, oh. Gotta go. Dad just got home, and he&apos;s yelling because Mom didn&apos;t make dinner. Again. Just 748 days until I can get away from that woman.

Hate to jump in here and break up all the fun......this question may have already been answered somewhere in the muck of this thread but WHERE THE HECK ARE KIDS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEIR DIAPERS CHANGED ON AIRPLANES????

One can barely wipe their own a** without smearing the mirror much less change a toddlers diaper in the cube they call a toilet. C&apos;mon!

The last time I flew I sat at the front of the plane and had to tolerate the putrid odor an ADULT left in the toilet as it wafted through the front of the plane. What would you rather smell? A toddler turd or a full-grown man&apos;s funk?? Sorry guys, you may not like this but if my 2 year old (well-behaved 2 year-old, I might add) has a poopy diaper on an airplane she will have it changed on the spot! Deal with it or prove your poop doesn&apos;t stink. Gimme&apos; a break.

Sorry to interrupt the important discussion going on here.

ENOUGH OF THIS VITRIOL!

But first...

JULIE:

I am a six-foot-two, overweight father. I&apos;ve changed a baby in the can of a Fokker 100, which is the smallest bathroom imaginable. Get a grip and just do it.
 Report Abuse Pilot on Jun 30, 00 at 05:50 PM 
This is your captain speaking. Any passengers found changing soiled diapers at their seats will be cited for interfering with the flight crew. According to FAA regulations, if you cannot figure out how to change a diaper in a small restroom, and if you cannot bring the necessary equipment with you, you will no longer be permitted to fly and you are a sad, inconsiderate, helpless excuse for a parent. Please attempt to ignore other odors in the cabin, but handling of fecal matter will not be permitted.

I guess I could figure out how to use one of those handy lap trays......hmm...less bending.....hmmm

With all due respect, Julie: shouldn&apos;t a 2 year old already be well on the way to being &quot;pottie-trained&quot;?? A lot of these types of problems would go away if parents wouldn&apos;t keep their kids in diapers (and keep &quot;Huggies&quot; and &quot;Pampers&quot; in the big bucks) until they were ready for the 1st grade!

Dear Jus, Julie&apos;s problem is not that her two-year old is in diapers. That is fine. Let&apos;s not start debating potty training, because it varies greatly depending on the child. No, Julie&apos;s problem is that she seems quite willing to behave as though she is in a trailer park and not a commercial airplane surrounded by business travelers.
