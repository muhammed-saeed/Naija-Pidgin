 Don&apos;t eat there!!!!. There isn&apos;t really much to say except when you walk in and you are greeted by teenage shop lifters.....

Watch out they might try to steal your credit card or who knows what else.... And yes it is very easy to get a table there even when they are busy.. what does that tell you????

This was my favorite place going in the past ...now I just lose my taste for going there ...knowing they hire teenagers with out checking references. Doesn&apos;t anybody have standards any more?????? …

 Not for Those Who Like Mexican Food. It was easy to get a table - this may be due to any of the following issues: The waitress did not explain that their&quot;cheese dip&quot;is the same goop served on nachos at little league concession stands or that our itemized receipt would include charges of $0.75 and $0.25 for salsa and lettuce, respectively. The price of menu items was not low enough to justify nickel-and-dime&apos;ing us for what amounted to a pinch of condiments.

The decor in the Restaurant consisted of several clever adaptations of well-known paintings modified to include iguanas as well as generally festive, bright appointments giving a tropical cantina atmosphere. This in no way prepared me for entering the men&apos;s restroom. Imagine a high school boys&apos; locker room - musty, warm, humid, with a reek of urine and no shortage of stains and peeling paint to identify the source of said reek. Had I gone to the restroom before ordering I would have paid for my drink, left, and saved myself from overpaying for disappointing food.

The dishes served should not have been called&quot;Mexican&quot;and barely warranted the title&quot;Tex-Mex&quot;. Enchilada sauce looked and tasted similar to seasoning available in a can or at a fast-food restaurant rather than having the texture and flavor one would expect to accompany a $10 dish - I realize $10 is cheap, but compared to authentic Mexican restaurants the price is quite high.

If you&apos;re looking for a place to take a large group of youngsters for food without the risk of flavor or texture and an opportunity to pay dine-in prices for concession-stand quality food, The Salty Iguana is for you. …

 Fascinating Decor. Great margaritas! Favorite place for cheese dip, especially the white cheese dip. Good place to take the family. We&apos;re going today for our granddaughter&apos;s 17th birthday.
