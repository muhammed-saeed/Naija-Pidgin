 ★★★☆☆ Good play area 
Anonymous 3 Mc Donald&apos;s 
 
They have a nice indoor playarea and my 2yrs old daughter loves to play there. There are may seats for parents around the playarea&amp;they keep the place very clean.

 ★★★★☆ As Good As Any McDonald&apos;s 
by kemeers at Citysearch 4 Mc Donald&apos;s 
 November 18, 2006 
I try not to eat fatty fast food, but every once in awhile I get a craving for McDonald&apos;s. Maybe it stems back to my childhood days when it was a real treat to get a Happy Meal and join other kids in the Playplace, but I think they&apos;ll always have me hooked for a meal at least twice a month. I live in Towne Lake so this is the McDonald&apos;s I visit. I usually get a hamburger Happy Meal (not much has changed since childhood!) and it tastes consistent with other McD&apos;s and is usually always hot/warm and given with a friendly smile. I would have to say McDonald&apos;s is my favorite fast food restaurant and the location in TL satisfies my craving every time!

Pros: Hamburger Happy Meal, Diverse Menu, Friendly Service

Cons: Mostly Unhealthy Choices
