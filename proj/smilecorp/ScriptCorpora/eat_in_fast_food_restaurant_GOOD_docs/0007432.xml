A new study links proximity to fast-food restaurants with increased obesity rates among children and pregnant women, Reuters reports. Released by the American Association of Wine Economics and conducted by researchers at Columbia University in New York City and the University of California-Berkeley, the study assessed obesity rates among 3 million ninth-grade students in California and more than 1 million pregnant women in Michigan, New Jersey and Texas. Researchers found that the presence of a fast-food restaurant within one-tenth of a mile of a school was associated with a 5.2 percent increase in that school&apos;s obesity rate. Among pregnant women, the presence of a fast-food restaurant within the same distance of their home was associated with a 4.4 percent increase in the probability of gaining more than 44 pounds during pregnancy. The report adds support to a December 2008 study suggesting that youth who attend schools within a half-mile of a fast-food outlet eat less fruit and vegetables, consume more soda and are more likely to be obese than their peers attending schools located farther from such restaurants. Noting the strong correlation between fast-food access and obesity rates, the researchers suggest designating fast-food-free zones near schools as a means to curb childhood overweight and obesity. A spokesperson for the National Retail Federation said that it would &quot;be a dangerous precedent to limit the types of legitimate, important businesses and where they are located in a city&quot; and suggested instead that parents limit when and where children can eat such foods (Gervitz, Reuters, 3/14/09; Currie et al., American Association of Wine Economics working paper, February 2009).
