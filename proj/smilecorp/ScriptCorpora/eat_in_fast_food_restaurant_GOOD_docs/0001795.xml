 Police say that Amber Harvey, 26, rammed her wheelchair through the front door of an Elkhart, In., Taco Bell after employees working the drive-through refused her service. Get Weird News Alerts Sign Up Submit this story digg reddit stumble 
Restaurant employees refused to serve a woman who rolled up to the drive-through in a wheelchair -- so she allegedly took out her anger on the front door.

Police in Elkhart, In., charged 26-year-old Amber Harvey with criminal mischief early Sunday morning after she allegedly used her wheelchair to ram her way through a Taco Bell entrance, leaving shattered glass scattered across the sidewalk, ABC-57 reports .

Employees told authorities that Harvey attempted to purchase food at the restaurant&apos;s drive-through, but without a car, attendants denied her service. A frustrated Harvey, who later told police that &quot;she was angry with employees for not serving her due to her not being in a vehicle in the drive through,&quot; proceeded to destroy the front window, according to FOX-28 .

Experts say she executed quite the demolition.

&quot;You have to hit it pretty hard, it&apos;s tempered glass,” Jim Sumption of Action Glass Company told the local television station. &quot;But, if you hit it just right it will shatter and fall to the ground…the corner of [the wheelchair] or something hard hit it.&quot;

Sumption, who repaired the glass that Monday, estimated the work cost around $325.

&quot;Cars through store fronts, underage kids driving cars through store fronts and just all kinds of crazy stuff,&quot; Sumption explained. &quot;This is the first time I&apos;ve seen anything like this.&quot;

 This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program Pd9 76 Fans 10:54 PM on 11/17/2011 As a disabled individual, who needs to use a wheelchair when suffering exacerbations, I can tell you that opening self-closing doors is virtually impossible without assistance. Most wheelchair access is designed so poorly that it&apos;s unusable. Ramps are so steep that they are not navigable by a lone individual. While I agree that property damage is an inappropriate response, unless you are in such a condition shut up. You have no idea what you are posting about.

 eyedzervit 97 Fans 02:51 PM on 11/16/2011 They have every right to refuse service to someone at the drive up who is not in a car. BUT... I don&apos;t see why some sort of empathy couldn&apos;t have been displayed by Taco Bell. The poor woman was in a wheelchair. TRY OPENING A HEAVY DOOR WHEN YOU&apos;RE IN A WHEELCHAI AND YOU&apos;RE ALONE. They could have gone around to get her and help her get in the front door to order inside. A commonsense employee would have said &quot;I&apos;m sorry, we can&apos;t serve you at the drive thru but so and so will come to the front door to help you inside&quot;. Unfortunately these people aren&apos;t paid to have commonsense and empathy.
I have a mother in a wheelchair and I know how difficult it can be to maneuver around many places. Odds are she went to the drive up window because getting inside was too hard for her alone.
They&apos;ll win, and she&apos;ll have to pay. But they might lose in the court of public opinion. eyedzervit: They have every right to refuse service to someone at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/eyedzervit/taco-bell-wheelchair_n_1095119_118550330.html History  | Permalink  | Share it This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program bopperkiki 12 Fans 03:43 PM on 11/16/2011 Banks won&apos;t serve you at their drive-through if you are not in a car. bopperkiki: Banks won&apos;t serve you at their drive-through if you are http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/bopperkiki/taco-bell-wheelchair_n_1095119_118561791.html History  | Permalink  | Share it eyedzervit 97 Fans 04:11 PM on 11/16/2011 I understand that. That is not the point. The point I&apos;m making is how much effort would it have been for one of the employees to offer to help her get inside. You know that was the problem. For a person in a wheelchair it probably did seem much easier to just go to the drive up. I bet a bank employee would have the commonsense and empathy to say come around to the front door and one of the employees will help you get inside.
People just don&apos;t get how hard it is to get around in wheelchairs even with the new laws about accessibility. Whatever happened to empathy in our society? All of you young people will someday be in wheelchairs too and you&apos;ll be wishing young people would hold a door open for you and not just say go away.
She was wrong for bashing the door down. But I can see where the level of frustration in a wheelchair bound person would ignite something like this. eyedzervit: I understand that.

 This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program roald 205 Fans 04:36 PM on 11/16/2011 I saw nothing in the article or the linked articles that suggested that she tried to go in the front door or even gave the person in the restaurant an opportunity to make the offer. I saw nothing that indicated the restaurant door was or was not automatic or difficult to open.

The policy exists because of the risk that someone will hit a person not in a vehicle. roald: I saw nothing in the article or the linked articles http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/roald/taco-bell-wheelchair_n_1095119_118573285.html History  | Permalink  | Share it eyedzervit 97 Fans 05:50 PM on 11/16/2011 And I see nothing that says someone tried to help her or it was an automatic door. Doors into these places like are typically not automatic. It&apos;s impossible for a person in a wheelchair to open a heavy restaurant door all by themselves. That&apos;s a given. I escort my mother in her wheelchair everywhere she goes and I know it&apos;s impossible for these people to pry open a door while sitting in a wheelchair. MY POINT: wheelchair bound people live a very frustrating life. AND I can see how they&apos;d become frustrated in general and find it easier to simply go up to the drivethrough. AND that if would be nice if someone had offered to help her inside. HAD the employees attempted to help her it would have been in the article in defense of themselves.
I help my wheelchair bound mother everywhere and can see how they become frustrated and lose it. I&apos;ve seen the disregard and rudeness given to them. Very few people will offer to help. Most kids will plow right on through an open door oblivious to the wheelchair bound person. We don&apos;t know what happened to this woman at the door and you can&apos;t say you do.
ALSO... every drive up window I&apos;ve BEEN to says that they cannot accommodate &quot;walk ups&quot; at the drive through. That is the standard language. Was she a walk up? NOPE. Really I &apos;m just wishing there could be more empathy for our handicapped people out there. eyedzervit: And I see nothing that says someone tried to help http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/eyedzervit/taco-bell-wheelchair_n_1095119_118588407.html History  | Permalink  | Share it This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.
