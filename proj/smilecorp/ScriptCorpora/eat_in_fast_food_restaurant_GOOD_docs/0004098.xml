 By Althea Chang Pin It

Saving Money Dining Out
Early bird specials may be harder to come by these days, but retirees on a budget can still enjoy the occasional restaurant outing without breaking the bank thanks to senior discounts at many nationwide chains.

Chain restaurants may not advertise their discounts, but they may be willing to do give you a deal if you ask for one. Here are some popular restaurants offering deals for retirees as young as just 50 years old.

Be sure to bring identification with your birth date on it, however. Regardless of how old (or young) you look, some restaurants may want you to prove your age before giving you the deal.
