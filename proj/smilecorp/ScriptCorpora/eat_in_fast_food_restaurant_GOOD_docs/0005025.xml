Why do cops get on here&amp;lie for about thay don&apos;t drink beer on duty&amp;speed on not on a call?
 And also thay speed if thay are not going on a call. I am a professional driver. I see lots of speeding, blowing stop signs, and every other driving infraction perpetrated by cops. I have lost count of the number of times I have seen a cop break numerous traffic laws, and then turn into the drive-thru at a fast-food restaurant.

I have my doubts (serious doubts) that an emergency call would dispatch a cop to the drive-thru line at McDonald&apos;s.
Yes, Also thay get there food free at McDonalds And KFC And 80% off at dennys Also i seen 2 officers drink beer while working FORT WORTH -- Police officer Eric Martinez was on duty with officer Jesus Cisneros and drinking during an unauthorized undercover bar detail in the hours before Cisneros crashed into a car, killing a mother of two, according to civil service records released Thursday.Martinez drank up to three beers while visiting three south Fort Worth bars with Cisneros before riding as a passenger in Cisneros&apos;city vehicle to The Pour House

 People like you must have either a very limited IQ, or a very poor education that doesn&apos;t give you a basis for Intelligent reasoning.

To begin with, I don&apos;t lie, and I have no reason to lie to a bunch of strangers, or YOU for that matter on this silly web site. I have been a police officer for nearly 40 years, and I don&apos;t drink on duty, although I have on two or three occasions, when my assignment required me to&apos;blend in&apos;with people at bars. Some departments do not have a specific prohibition against drinking on duty, but almost all have rules against intoxication, by alcohol or drugs.

Now, I am sure that there are Police officers who drink on duty, and ones who work while drunk, Just like there are drunken airline pilots or bus drivers or doctors. All of those also place people in jeopardy when they drink on the job, all are problems, and all get caught and corrected, eventually.

Now, I am sure that you are offended that the officers you saw broke traffic laws. What did they do precisely? Is your problem that they did it? Or, is it that they got away with it? have you ever broken a traffic law? Have you ever gotten away with it? I realize that doesn&apos;t make it right. Two wrongs never equal a right, but let&apos;s get real, the police are people, just like you, and people make mistakes.

As far as speeding when not going to a call, quite often police are going places urgently when you see them going fast. Actually, ideal&quot;patrol speed&quot;is about 20-25 mph, so you can observe what is happening around you.

I think you are a little jealous of the police, because they got away with something that you didn&apos;t. Did you get fired for drinking on a job? Or, was it a speeding ticket?

Police should not break traffic laws, nor should they drink on the job. They should not drive while intoxicated and harm people. I can guarantee that the police WILL NEVER do that, when you have robots for police officers instead of humans. When officers get caught&apos;breaking the rules&quot;they get far worse punishment than the general public will. You might get a speeding ticket, whereas they might get a week without pay. Do yourself a favor, grow up and stop complaining about the police, unless you could do better. If you an do it better, take the test, I&apos;d be happy to work with someone who is squared away.

 Maybe&quot;thay&quot;(they) personally don&apos;t. Maybe&quot;thay&quot;don&apos;t know any officers that do. Did you ever think of that?

Does it happen? Sure, news reports stating those things do. However, it is rare and unfortunate when it does and if caught, they will be severely punished. the so called thin blue line does not exist when it comes to issues like unauthorized alcohol and illegal drug use.

 I personally dont. Whether you believe me or not, I honestly dont care, it is immaterial.

I dont speak for all cops, as I constantly tell lilah. I speak for myself.

And, speaking for myself, I must ask, why do you ALWAYS post the same exact question?

 I can&apos;t speak for others, it is rare, but I don&apos;t do that, so your question does not have any bearing on me at all
