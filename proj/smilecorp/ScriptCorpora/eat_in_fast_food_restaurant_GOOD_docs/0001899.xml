View Full Version : Gratuities 
 Somebody 06-15-04, 09:26 AM I was just curious as to policies with other agencies on gratuities. I was just reading a comment in another thread about a place giving discounts, but didn&apos;t want to hijack. :)

Anyway, I know there are places (like gas stations, restaurants, fast food joints) which give discounts, free drinks, or some other&quot;Public Safety&quot;benefit. Now, most every agency I have been in contact with has strict rules against gratuities and gifts (for obvious reasons). My question is, how strict is yours?

Is it really an issue eating at a McDonalds which gives a PS discount? Or stopping by a 7-11 which gives cops free coffee, for example?

I haven&apos;t had that issue at my current agency (yet) but I saw it a bit more at my last one. I suppose this is more of an ethics question than policy, but what the heck, discuss :p 
 Oldbillplod 06-15-04, 10:04 AM We get discounts had various places, usually food outlets, we get two for one at the cinemas and free bus and train travel.
A lot of companies give discount for electrical items, holidays, mortgages etc.
We actually have a website where companies only give discount to police so its not such a major issue here.
However I once had an Inspector (who we used to call the smiling assasin) who told an old lady that she couldnt give us the box of biscuits she had bought for us after we helped her out as that would be like excepting a bribe.
Still he did have the I.Q of a daffodil. Scruit 06-15-04, 10:59 AM I can see how larger gifts could be considered to put the officer in a position of being expected to return the favor... But free coffee at the gas station? The worst I see there is some may ask questions if that cop gives a warning instead of a ticket when the gas station owner is pulled over?

Still, there was that old security camera footage of the cop enjoying a coffee and shooting the shizzle with a gas station clerk and a guy walked in and tried to rob the place with a knife, not even noticing the officer - even looking at the officer long enough to tell him to stand back. Well, of course, he gets proned out at gunpoint. They call in the paddy wagon and the officer goes back to drinking his coffee...

(Dunno if that coffee was discounted or comped, but still... For law abidiging citizens it&apos;s never a bad thing to have a cop around... I&apos;d give out free coffee if it was allowed and it meant officers would routinely linger in my store...) 
 Toeknee112 06-15-04, 11:10 AM Very strict here. We cannot take ANY gratuity. NJTPD 06-15-04, 11:56 AM In my dept. it is not allowed its strickly outlined in our policy&amp;procedures manual. Then you have companies that sponors some of our police events and tell us to come to them directly for discounts. Its a double edge sword and you just have to know not to take advantage of people . Even at the coffee shop i leave a tip just in case... hawkman 06-15-04, 01:18 PM We don&apos;t have anything here when it comes to gas station or food policeys. Some places give discounts or make it free, while others charge full price. I tend to go to the ones that give me a free fountain drink b/c it saves money. But, our gas stations are spread out so far here, some times its just who ever I&apos;m closer too.

We have to go to the county next door for fast food anyway (Sonic and McDonalds), they both give 50% off. Other wise all we can eat is at one of two steak houses (no discount and expensive to boot), and one of two pizza joints. Every were else it is not safe for us to eat at including one of the pizza joints. 121Traffic 06-15-04, 02:36 PM I can see how larger gifts could be considered to put the officer in a position of being expected to return the favor...

Not that I have a real opinion on this yet...

But I think that this is what agencies worry about with the free coffee, etc. It is like the store is getting extra protection and attention by giving out these&quot;gratuities&quot;. This gas station got robbed, but had a cop inside. What if the gas station down the street that DOESN&apos;T give out free coffee gets robbed? Critics would say that since the one station gave out free coffee, they were in a way&quot;paying&quot;for extra protection.

Eh I&apos;m probably not wording this well, and it&apos;s not that I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint, it is just what I have heard from some administrators and ethics instructors... hwpd 06-15-04, 03:26 PM Our Police department&apos;s officers get gratitutes from some places in town. Such as 7/11 any drink(coffee, coke, slurpee) is free. Mcdonalds sometimes gives 50% discount, 100% discount(free) or no discount food. Subway always gives our officers 50% off.

In my opinion, free/reduced price meal is nice, but the thing is police doesnt do anything special to recieve those discounts. It is their job to protect and to serve. Therefore I think we should pay for what we get, it&apos;s just the store that woudn&apos;t take our money :). Why for example Joe Smith who is a banker cannot get a free slurpee? Why is Susan Smith who is a nurse cannot get a free slurpee? you see my point?
Altough I&apos;m not complaining about it... If they give us discounts and free food... oh well.. be it :D ngcsubutterbar 06-15-04, 03:35 PM this may have changed, hopefully it has, county/city my professor worked for had the normal no gratuities policy, but they didn&apos;t enforce it much when their chief sat next to them taking free food. Strijder 06-15-04, 04:18 PM Not sure of their policy, but the local officers I&apos;ve ridden with have paid for their food every time. But then, they&apos;ll only go to a select few places since there was an issue with a fast food restaurant not too long ago. JBU2010 06-15-04, 05:17 PM My local agency here in Texas is somewhat different. Policy says that officers may receive discounts or free items if the store/restaurant/establishment gives them to the officer. The officer cannot directly ask for&quot;his or her discount&quot;. Most places just give it to them automatically and it&apos;s a done deal. Coastie 585 06-15-04, 07:31 PM My PD is similar to JBU. I even get a discount when I eat on a ride. :D And im only an Explorer. lol

My PD does not care. They even have a bulletin board specifically for&quot;Off-Duty&quot;Jobs, and LEO Specials. Here is an example of one I say last week:

Got a squad car?? GET FREE RENT!!
At Jefferson Commins..bla bla bla...

They pretty much live theye, which would cost about 600$ a month. Saving them that money. But Jefferson Commins is one of the WORST college dorms here in Tally. lol

Thats probably why it has been there for a few weeks. Toeknee112 06-15-04, 07:35 PM My PD does not care. They even have a bulletin board specifically for&quot;Off-Duty&quot;Jobs, and LEO Specials. Here is an example of one I say last week:

I think that&apos;s sad. Coastie 585 06-15-04, 07:36 PM Thatks alot friend. :rolleyes: Toeknee112 06-15-04, 07:45 PM Hey! No problem young man! Coastie 585 06-15-04, 07:46 PM lol. I love this place. Toeknee112 06-15-04, 07:49 PM Feel the love! :D michiganstud 06-15-04, 07:56 PM My PD is similar to JBU. I even get a discount when I eat on a ride. :D And im only an Explorer. lol

Yeah, I have a LEO friend in Georgia, he works for a department that the ENTIRE department (large) is issued a take home vehicle. The complex he lives in gives him free rent for parking his car there, but he also has to go around in uniform to all the tenants passing out flyers monthly from the complex. Odd, but they like the visibility I guess.

I would do it if I could!!! Coastie 585 06-15-04, 07:56 PM I have a question..

I see some of you saying, NO Gratituity(sp?) When it comes to gass, and some saying it is ok. Do any of you have police gas pumps? We have about 3 over here, And if you do have to pay for your own gas, do you get Re-Imbursed(sp?) for the gas money? ngcsubutterbar 06-15-04, 08:12 PM There is a pump at the training center, but it&apos;s used for the 20 odd cars at the facility, and it&apos;s trainers. I think there is one downtown for the city maintence people. The deputies are issued Fuelman cards. Orleander 06-15-04, 08:14 PM If the city gave a cop a house in a crappy neighborhood, thinking his precense would deter crime, would that be OK. Coastie 585 06-15-04, 08:16 PM That is what my PD is doing. Like I said, Jefferson Commins is not a good place. I am supprised they need a cop living there, There are a couple there on calls daily. :) Norm357 06-15-04, 08:19 PM If the city gave a cop a house in a crappy neighborhood, thinking his precense would deter crime, would that be OK.

HUD has a program where they will sell you a house, dirt cheap, in a crappy neighborhood. I don&apos;t know of any officer that has taken them up on it. Norm357 06-15-04, 08:24 PM I have a question..

My wifes dept uses the county pumps. hwpd 06-15-04, 09:47 PM in reference to gas pumps
Our officers get a credit card from the city to buy gas. They can buy gas at any gas station with that card. They used to use city pump, but the city finally said that the city pump is for garbage trucks and other city vehicles. They said all police officers should get premium gas, this way it makes the car a bit faster, that&apos;s why they introduced those credit cards. AKA fuelman cards.

in reference to cops living on campus.
We have officers in our department that live on school campus(in portable building) they live there for free, and school gets a cop car parked near the school most of the time. oscarmitre 06-15-04, 10:08 PM If the city gave a cop a house in a crappy neighborhood, thinking his precense would deter crime, would that be OK.

In my state they used to do exactly that. Because they used to supply housing at a heavily discounted rental rate in rural areas (we can be posted anywhere in the state) they used to dump our members alongside the most difficult families or in bad areas. It didn&apos;t work. Just caused huge problems for the cops and their families. One of our members had his loungereoom firebombed (see thread on the Molotov Cocktail). They dropped the policy (not that they admitted it was a policy). Bishop22 06-17-04, 12:37 PM Not a cop but discount on lunches (McD&apos;z, Subway, etc.) would be cool. NYC is expensive... corporal716 06-17-04, 01:02 PM Where I worked there were a lot of places that gave 1/2 price meals to cops. There was one place the Sheriff told us we could not go beacause we know it was half price. He even put out a memo about it. Someone showed the restaurant owner the memo and he got mad.

The owner went to the Board of Supervisors and said the Sheriff was taking business away from him and that he could charge any price he wanted as long as it did not exceed the amount shown on the menu. The board agreed and convinced the Sheriff to recall the memo. ngcsubutterbar 06-17-04, 04:24 PM wow that&apos;s some investment, losing money to gain police presence. mcsap 06-17-04, 05:51 PM We get beverages gratis at most of our local convenience stores but only if it is their policy to do so . I make it a point to get around to them all over the week so nobody is&quot;left out&quot;. McDonalds sometimes gives a discount , same with Subway. I NEVER ask for it if they don&apos;t give it to me, I just pay up and leave.

I remember an episode of real TV show where a Texas Constable was DEMANDING that he get a discount or a freebie and got quite outraged when the clerk wouldn&apos;t give it to him. I heard he ended up getting fired. greenlead 06-17-04, 06:43 PM We have gas pumps and a car wash at our city garage.

Most of the restaurants here give discounts. I see nothing wrong with it, officer presence deters crime, and it gives the owner a chance to say&quot;Hey, I support you guys!&quot;.

Some of the housing projects, apartments complexes, and developments give discounts to officers. This, as well as the take-home program, helps those neighborhoods fight crime. Coastie 585 06-18-04, 09:04 PM Nicely put Green. :)
