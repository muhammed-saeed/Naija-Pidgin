Little Tavern franchising update
 Posted on January 11, 2011 by dinerman 
 Back in 2009, I posed about the “rebirth of Tavern” . I emailed the current owner of the“Little Tavern”name Nov 2009, and got an email back today, with this announcement. The information’s just about the same as the last message, but now there’s a website for the“new”Little Tavern Shops. 

“Thanks for posting notice 0f the rebirth of little tavern and our commemts
thereto. As to the responses you had regarding same. I note as follows;
We are working hard to arrange the first New Liitle Tavern Operation in
Balto. Co. Md. and will proceed there after to other Md Area’s and DC.

Facilities, Free Standing or Shop Center Location’s. However we still are in the
