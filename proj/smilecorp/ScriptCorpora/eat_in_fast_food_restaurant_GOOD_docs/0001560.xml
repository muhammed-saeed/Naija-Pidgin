 Social Security scare talk 
Although we generally support President Bush&apos;s &quot;ownership society&quot; philosophy, we think the administration is right to back off the notion that converting a small portion of an individual&apos;s Social Security savings to personal investment accounts will be enough to save the program. It will take a lot more than that.

 Intimidating justice 
Judges have been the victims of murder and murder plots before, but the execution-style killings this week in Chicago of the husband and mother of federal court Judge Joan Lefkow was apparently a first - the first time, at least in modern times, that a U.S. judge&apos;s family has been the target of assassins.

 Congressmen are disappointing 
I can honestly say that Lindsey Graham and Gresham Barrett are two of the worst congressmen I have ever had, and I&apos;m sorry to say that I voted for both of them. They voted themselves a raise that went into effect this past January, and voted for $87 billion for Iraq last year. I&apos;ll bet that they vote another $80 billion for Iraq this year.Frank Fanning, North Augusta, S.C.
