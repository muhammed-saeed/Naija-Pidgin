New ketchup packets coming to a fast-food restaurant near you

Posted at: 09/19/2011 2:30 PM

 A new kind of ketchup packet is coming to a fast-food restaurant near you.

The new Heinz&quot;Dip and Squeeze&quot;packets will begin replacing the traditional rectangular ketchup packets at Wendyâ€™s, Chick-fil-A and Dairy Queen restaurants. McDonald&apos;s and Burger King are testing the packets.

Just as the name says, you can dip for fries or squeeze for extra ketchup on your burger.

The red, bottle-shaped packets hold three times as much ketchup as traditional packets.
