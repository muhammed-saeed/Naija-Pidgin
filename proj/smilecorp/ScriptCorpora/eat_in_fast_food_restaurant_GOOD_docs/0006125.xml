The food here is pretty good. We love the homemade potato chips and the fried pickles. The price isn&apos;t too bad, and it is well worth it to be able to sit outside in that atmosphere. The peach tea is good as well.

I Love the Fickle Pickle!! The atmosphere is great, the food is great, and the chocolate gingerbread cookies are out of this world (and addictive!). If you&apos;re in Roswell you have to stop by.

Locals are not fickle to pick the Fickle Pickle. The prices are reasonable. Service is fantastic and the food is fulfilling. Many homemade sandwiches to select and enjoy!

 ★★★★★ Just great! 
by magggss at Citysearch 5 Fickle Pickle 
 August 06, 2010 
I recently moved to the area and was looking for a little home style deli like the one back home I loved so much and stumbled upon this place. The food was amazing, the people are super friendly and the prices were really good. I will definitely be back, I can&apos;t wait to try the dinner menu!

We love going to Fickle Pickle and sitting outside on the patio. My fav is the fried green tomato sandwich. I can&apos;t wait to try the newly introduced breakfast!

Pros: great food, great atmosphere

Cons: can run out of seating indoors


 ★★★★☆ Darn Good Breakfast 
by fkrower at Citysearch 4 Fickle Pickle

I can&apos;t believe that this place isn&apos;t packed for breakfast. I have been there often over the past two weeks with my kids and we have sampled just about everything. Try the Fried Green Tomato Scramble. The waffle is a favorite of my daughter&apos;s and the boy really likes building his own egg sandwhich.

Great muffins and better service can get you in and out the door fast. Personally, I like sitting with the kids and chatting with the staff while rush hour passes by.

What else can I say, give it a shot. Tell them Frank sent ya ;-)



Pros: Great Fast Breakfast

Cons: I ain&apos;t got none


 ★★★☆☆ Wonderful Lunch, Very Sad Breakfast 
by California Dreamin at Citysearch 3 Fickle Pickle 
 May 10, 2010 
Fickle Pickles patio is so casual and conducive to relaxing over an inexpensive meal, and I love the family-friendly atmosphere. Its location in a beat-up old Victorian style house right on Canton in downtown Roswell is perfect. Be aware that you order at the counter like at a fast food restaurant, and the food is brought to you. But like a fast food restaurant, cream for the coffee is the mini-plastic container variety. Cant beat the burgers, tuna melt, roasted veggie sandwich, and, of course, the famous chicken salad with dried cherries on a croissant. Score if theres not a line when you order! Really great place to pick up a quick take-home dinner, especially the Cobb salad.

But Yikes! Something has gone terribly wrong with FPs new breakfast. The Belgian Waffle arrived white, almost raw. And its fruit accompaniment was a sliced banana. The Fried Green Tomato Scramble was supposed to be three eggs, but was only about a tablespoon of scrambled egg pellets which arrived on a limp, underdone slice of fried green tomato. The sausage patty was more like a flavorless, very thin piece of cardboard. Stick with lunch and dinner at Fickle Pickle!

Pros: Perfect Patio, Very Fast Service

Cons: New Breakfast Needs Help!


 ★★★★★ Great casual sandwiches and soups 
by scootermack at Citysearch 5 Fickle Pickle 
 December 12, 2009 
Really good food, great soups and sandwiches. The cute setting of an old house makes for some pretty close seating, so keep that in mind if you&apos;re planning a meeting.

Pros: Tasty food, casual atmosphere

Cons: Little crowded sometimes


 ★★★★☆ Awesome Sandwiches! 
by Tait at Citysearch 4 Fickle Pickle 
 October 20, 2009 
I wouldn&apos;t go there again on a busy weekend, however this place is a must when visiting downtown Roswell, GA!

Pros: Best sandwiches, with great prices.

Cons: Parking/seating


 ★★★☆☆ Great little hidden resturant 
by rsmithdawgs at Citysearch 3 Fickle Pickle 
 October 12, 2009 
Tasty food at great prices, however, seating is limited and parking is evern more so.

Pros: Great prices, tasty food

Cons: parking


 ★★★★☆ great food, nice casual eatery 
by grasshopper72 at Citysearch 4 Fickle Pickle

Great for families and casual dates. Really good food, nice house. Everything seems clean and well done. Prices are really good, to often fresh and inventive means over priced, not here. Everything is in line with market prices and obviously home made. Only downside is parking - it&apos;s a giant pain, even more than normal in downtown Roswell.

Pros: Food, dessert

Cons: parking


 ★★★★☆ Great food-limited seating 
by llhrnc at Citysearch 4 Fickle Pickle 
 July 27, 2007 
The food and service are always excellent, but there is limited seating and parking is always a problem.

Pros: great fried pickles

Cons: seating and parking are a problem


 ★★★★★ Best Sandwich Shop 
by kemeers at Citysearch 5 Fickle Pickle 
 February 22, 2007 
As far as sandwich shops go, I&apos;d have to say this is one, if not THE, best one I&apos;ve been to. I went with a girlfriend and we sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a glass of red wine while we waited for our food to arrive. I am a vegetarian and they had a few veg-only choices; I had the roasted vegetable sandwich. Huge slices of vegetables were roasted and placed on grilled sourdough w/ goat cheese. Whatever meal you choose at the Fickle Pickle, you MUST try the cajun fried pickles - I can definitely say they&apos;re the best fried pickles I&apos;ve ever tasted. Great location, great food and great service - A+ for The Fickle Pickle.

Pros: Everything tastes great; Great service; Great location

Cons: None


 ★★★★★ Tickled with the Pickle 
by mommyonthemove at Citysearch 5 Fickle Pickle 
 July 23, 2006 
The Fickle Pickle was great! I am from up north and thoroughly enjoyed this great taste of the south. The fried pickles are a must to start out with, and you can&apos;t leave without getting some of the mocha cookies, or carrot cake cookies if you&apos;re not a chocolate fan. I enjoyed the fried green tomato sandwich, and I heard great things about everything else that the others in my party ordered. I only wish we had one in Chicago!

Pros: everything was awesome

Cons: might get crowded when everyone discovers it!


 ★★★★★ wonderfully consistently charming 
by sjeystad at Citysearch 5 Fickle Pickle

We love this place. The food is always excellent. The atmosphere is charming for sure. I almost hate to write such good things, as next time we won&apos;t find a table for sure! If you have not tried it, you must. It is all yummy.
