 D&amp;S Market Place

Fresh and Consistant
 
Everything I have ordered at D&amp;S has been delicious! Extremely fresh and reasonable with consistently fast and run by polite people. Sandwiches are abundantly full of turkey, avocado, sprouts, tuna fish or whatever you&apos;re craving... all inside a couple nice pieces of soft bread. Enjoy!

Bad
 
Attention to detail: 0 Ordered 5 sandwiches all the same. They managed to get every one of them wrong. Reordered them and they delivered again the wrong sandwiches.

Best deli lunch fast food in midtown
 
Number one thing, it&apos;s always packed, means the food is fresh and moves. They give you want you want, and delivery is sooo quick. As well, when you are there, they have an amazing great system. From breakfast, to deli sandwiches, to burgers, and steak sandwiches, including their fries are great! And the folks are very friendly.

best value and quality
 
The guys working there are always nice. where else can you get a cheeseburger deluxe with fries for 6 bucks. Everything is made fresh and made to order. our office favorites are the Philly cheese steak sandwich and their chicken sandwiches. i just got their spicy tuna salad melt...and i think i will be returning.

Remarkable Deli
 
This is a fantastic Deli. Compared with other Delis, the food quality is perfect while having an ample choice and the location (including the restroom) is notable. A pity they do not provide dinner but it seems focussing on breakfast/lunch is quite a good idea.

Best New York City Deli!
 
What a place. Breakfast was wonderful and the price could not be better. Upstairs dining is great with a view of the street. Coffee was great. Buffet looked yummy.
