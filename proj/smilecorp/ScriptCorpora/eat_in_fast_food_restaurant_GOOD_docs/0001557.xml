Singapore, Salad Shop Interior Design by Asylum
 October 16th, 2010 - Posted in Restaurant Interior Design 
 

Located in Singapore, this is the healthy fast food restaurant ‘The Salad Shop’. For herbivores, carnivores and everything else in between’ is the mantra of The Salad Shop by Asylum . Passersby outside the restaurant are allowed glimpses of the interior through massive cutout shapes os forks and spoons on a plywood feature screen. While cement screed flooring and plywood fittings accentuate the organic space, graphic printed stools and customized scenic fabric lampshades breathe a sense of freshness into the environment. - via -
