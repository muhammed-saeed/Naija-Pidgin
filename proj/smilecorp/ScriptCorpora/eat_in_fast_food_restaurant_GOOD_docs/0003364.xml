		McDonald&apos;s: McBusted 
 July 2,
2003 

 By  Larry Barrett and Sean
Gallagher 

   

 The most important shareholders&apos; meeting in
McDonald&apos;s history was about to start. It was early May 2003 and several
hundred stockholders and analysts were wedged into the Hyatt Lodge ballroom on
the sprawling McDonald&apos;s Oak Brook, Ill., campus. Chief Executive Officer Jim
Cantalupo looked on as Ronald McDonald bounded around the room in full makeup
and oversized red shoes. The&quot;Chief Happiness Officer&quot;was shaking
hands, smiling and doing something called&quot;the Ronald dance&quot;to a
compilation of feel-good, McDonald&apos;s-themed songs. 

 Just six months into his tenure, Cantalupo
surely knew he was going to have to do some pretty fast dancing of his own to
restore investors&apos; faith in an American icon. 

 Shares had tumbled in March to $12.38, a
nine-year low, after the company registered its first unprofitable quarter
ever, losing $343.8 million in the final three month period of 2002. It said it
would absorb $810 million in charges for the quarter and confirmed it would
close 719 restaurants worldwide. Included in the $810 million charges was a $170
million write-off related to the discontinuation in December of a global,
real-time digital network called Innovate, which represented the most expensive
and extensive information technology project in the company&apos;s history. 

 That $170 million was just part of the $1
billion that McDonald&apos;s expected to spend on Innovate when it conceived the
project in January 2001, according to executives and consultants involved in
the project. Innovate was designed to allow McDonald&apos;s management, at some
point in the near future, to see just how many billions of burger patties, buns
and chicken nuggets were being consumed at any or all stores at any time of the
day. For instance, they could see if the restaurant at South Cooper Street in
Arlington, Texas, was handling customer orders at its cash registers within the
three-minute service goal, and even if drive-through service was faltering as a
result. 

 Further out, Cantalupo&apos;s successors would be
able to see if the oil in the fryer at a restaurant in Leicester Square, London,
was turning out sticks of potato at the proper temperature and time. Anyone
authorized to know could even connect from anywhere in the world to see if the
carbon dioxide in a soda tower in any store in the network had fizzled out. 

 Such was the ambition of McDonald&apos;s in trying to
use technology to return to its roots: the speediest, most consistent service
in the fast-food industry. 

 But the fact the billion-dollar project failed
before it even got off the ground shows the difficulty of turning even a simple
business such as flipping burgers into a&quot;real-time enterprise.&quot;In
fact, to date, McDonald&apos;s attempts to use technology to put its products in the
hands of hungry consumers faster have been largely unsuccessful. 

 The company&apos;s failure to find a way to improve
customer service is compounded by a lack of creativity: the company hasn&apos;t
introduced a home-run menu item since it rolled out Chicken McNuggets in 1983.
The Big Mac, McDonald&apos;s signature sandwich, is 35 years old. 

 Cantalupo told shareholders that McDonald&apos;s top
priority now was not to Innovate, but to improve the quality of the products
and service it provides in existing stores. No longer can it expect growth from
the breakneck pace of expansion that defined its business in the 1990s. 

 If anything, McDonald&apos;s past success created a
sense of arrogance and ambivalence that enabled it to operate in a vacuum,
unencumbered by the realities of evolving consumer taste and the realities of
the digital economy. 

 Yet it was that fast growth that led headquarters
to want to create a means of controlling the key quality that makes a fast-food
chain successful: consistency. But how could top executives really know what
was going on in the stores? McDonald&apos;s opened more than 1,700 new restaurants a
year in the past 10 years, taxing its outdated data collection systems and
making enemies of franchisees who complained that McDonald&apos;s was cannibalizing
its older stores for the sake of top-line growth. 

 To improve its existing restaurants, McDonald&apos;s
now thinks it needs a more&quot;relevant&quot;menu featuring more healthy
options. But it also knows it must improve the sluggish service that has sent
many customers elsewhere during their lunch breaks. 

 A Web-based network that shipped information
instantly around the world might have done that. It would at least have given
executives the ability to monitor, and possibly affect on a minute-by-minute
basis, the company&apos;s ability to get a consistent product to customers as fast
as possible. Founders Richard and Maurice McDonald, and Ray Kroc, the
distributor of a five-spindled milk shake maker called the Multimixer, who
built McDonald&apos;s into a global powerhouse, would have understood. If connected
to every key piece of equipment in every store, the real-time digital network would
have allowed McDonald&apos;s to better serve customers by using information and
communications technologies to monitor the quality of the oil used to make
french fries, or ensure that each bun was toasted to the proper level of
crispiness. 

 Moreover, it would have given McDonald&apos;s
executives a bird&apos;s-eye view of the entire system at any minute of the day.
Identifying which locations were selling the most McGriddles breakfast
sandwiches or premium salads would have been as simple as logging onto a
browser at the corporate headquarters, according to staff inside McDonald&apos;s
information systems organization. Sales, service time, staffing, supply-chain
data, vendor locations, equipment repair orders and every other data item that
McDonald&apos;s currently tracksusing an aging homegrown system that often
delivered the data to decision-makers in a week or morewould be had in seconds
through a Web browser. 

 To make this system work through the public
Internet or even a Web-based private network, McDonald&apos;s was looking at a huge
costand it may not have been practical. After all, if $1 billion was to have
been spent in the first five years just designing and implementing Innovate,
the company would have spent hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars more
maintaining the network each year as more and more functions and application
were added. From a pure financial standpoint, there&apos;s little wonder that
Cantalupo canned Innovate almost as soon as he got on the job. 

 &quot;There&apos;s no question the $1 billion would
have only been a starting point,&quot;says Andrew McAfee, an assistant
professor at Harvard Business School and a specialist in large-scale corporate
information systems implementations.&quot;These projects are hard to break
into bite-sized chunks. Over and over again, companies take a monolithic
approach to these implementations, telling themselves that they&apos;re going to
spend a lot of money without seeing any real returns until that magical day
when they flip the switch and go live five years down the road.&quot; 

 Though the company had shown little to no
excitement or expertise in large-scale information systems implementations when
Innovate was initiated, its executives thought they could do a Wal-Mart-like
makeover of their core technology infrastructure. 

 What they found out was that their expertise in
developing and mass-producing cheeseburgers and french fries had little
relevance to the world of software integration and implementation. 

 INTO THE FRYER 

 McDonald&apos;s challenge is painfully obvious from a
May visit to a franchise on Midwest Road in Oak Brook, only a few miles from
where Cantalupo spoke to stockholders. 

 In a restaurant last redecorated in the 1980s,
among faux black marble wall tiles and fraying brown leatherette booth benches,
a manager repeated the same phrase to customers as their orders were finally
filled:&quot;I&apos;m sorry about the wait.&quot;With only three customers at the
counter, an order for a single Extra Value Meal took more than seven minutes to
fill. 

 As the result of a process reengineering the
company forced on its restaurants in the late 1990s, the quality and speed of
service is, as Cantalupo acknowledges, at an unacceptable nadir. The restaurant
built on the&quot;15-second burger&quot;now finds itself losing its share of
customers because of slow and sometimes shoddy service. 

 The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI),
which surveys more than 65,000 customers, has tracked McDonald&apos;s lackluster
service performance for the past nine years. The study measures customer
expectations, perceived quality, perceived value, customer complaints and
customer loyaltyscoring each company on a scale of 1 to 100. 

 In 1994, the first year of the study, ACSI
respondents gave McDonald&apos;s a score of 63, well below competitors such as
Wendy&apos;s (71) and Burger King (66), as well as Yum Brands&apos; Pizza Hut (69) and
KFC (67) units. In 1995, McDonald&apos;s managed to score a 65the highest level it
would attain during the nine years of pollingbefore slipping back to a 61 in
2002. Meanwhile, its leading competitors have consistently scored from the
mid-60s to low-70s over this same period. 

 Taking a closer look, every fast-food restaurant
points to its drive-through window as the benchmark for its service
performance. 

 The most recent data collected by QSR Magazine,
a quick-service restaurant trade publication, shows that McDonald&apos;s
drive-throughs took 162.7 seconds to fill an order between June 7 and July 28
of last year. That&apos;s slightly faster than the 165.8-second average of the top
five burger-centric fast food restaurants. 

 However, random secret shoppers hired by
McDonald&apos;s and other independent watchdogs, such as QSR Magazine, report that
orders can take between five and 10 minutes to fill and actually take longer
during nonpeak operating hours. 

 Now, say Cantalupo and McDonald&apos;s President and
Chief Operating Officer Charlie Bell, the technology efforts of the company
will be focused on improving its customers&apos; experience; speeding up the trip
through the drive-through or to the counter, and making the trip more
convenient so that Quarter Pounder lovers will come back again. 

 This summer, the company begins its rollout of
credit- and debit-card payment systems to about a quarter of its U.S.
restaurants. These systems will require no signature for purchases, reducing
the time it takes for a credit card transaction to go through to roughly the
same time as a cash transaction. McDonald&apos;s hopes that taking credit cards will
boost its flagging salesVisa found in a study of credit card use in
quick-service restaurants that customers spent 30% to 50% more when they used a
credit or debit card than when they spent cash. 

 But restaurants need to configure their
point-of-sale systems to take electronic payments before these systems can be
installedaccording to one integrator familiar with the McDonald&apos;s trial, it
costs $12,000 for each McDonald&apos;s location to be configured to handle the
technology. 

 Cantalupo says the company also plans to test
kiosks that allow customers to punch in their own orders at the drive-through
or while waiting to get to the countertheoretically cutting down on the wait
in line and reducing order-errors by cutting McDonald&apos;s minimum-wage employees
out of that part of the transaction. And, says Bell, the company will focus on
other basics of good servicelike having clean bathrooms.&quot;We&apos;re going to
have the cleanest bathrooms in the business,&quot;he declared at the
stockholder&apos;s meeting. 

 Having clean bathrooms was always a tenet that
Ray Kroc insisted be at the forefront of McDonald&apos;s image. He would often tell
McDonald&apos;s insiders that kids can&apos;t tell the difference between the quality of
one cheeseburger or another but mothers would always know and remember which
bathrooms were clean and which weren&apos;t. 

 But information systems don&apos;t scrub toilets and
they don&apos;t fry potatoes. 

 THE SPECIAL SAUCE 

 The McDonald brothers first conceived of what
would become known as the fast-food or quick-service model shortly after World
War II when they mapped out the layout for their original restaurant in San
Bernardino, Calif., on a tennis court. The idea was simple: take the mass
production, assembly-line system used for manufacturing cars and replicate it
in a burger restaurant. 

 They installed large grills in their kitchen to
cook up burgers in large volume and incorporated what they would call the Speedee
Service System. This wasn&apos;t a system that relied on technology but common
sense. It eliminated menu items that required utensils or dishware, replacing
them with the nine-item menu that would become the foundation of the McDonald&apos;s
dynasty. No dishes. No forks. Paper wrappers and cups and a few napkins. 

 Managers, who often owned the stores they
managed, would write down orders on pads of paper and pass them back to the
kitchen. More often than not, the burgers and fries would be waiting under heat
lamps. Inventory was something that managers handled by intuition and
experience. Often, managers would jot down how much milk or cheese or beef they
would need for the next week on the back of the order forms they filled out
when taking customer orders at the register. 

 The registers weren&apos;t computerized and certainly
weren&apos;t linked to the kitchen. They simply facilitated the transaction. 

 Next, they divided the actual food preparation
into specific jobs for different workers. One fellow worked the grill, cooking
the patties. Another&quot;dressed&quot;the burger with a precise amount of
ketchup and mustard before wrapping it and sending it down the line. Another
worker was in charge of mixing milk shakes and pouring sodas. Yet another
employee would work the register, collect the money and deliver the meal to the
customer. 

 Over the years, McDonald&apos;s franchisees and
corporate executives came to discover that many of the same problems that
originally hampered the McDonald&apos;s brothers&apos; California restaurant were still eating
away at their profit margins. 

 Turnover of employees has been and always will
be one of the biggest problems facing McDonald&apos;s operators. In fact, McDonald&apos;s
claims that one in 10 Americans has worked at a McDonald&apos;s at one time in his
or her life. Since the pay is mostly minimum-wage level or slightly above,
McDonald&apos;s typically attracts teenagers and other relatively inexperienced or
unskilled laborers. The fast-food industry attrition rate has been pegged at
more than 100%, placing a premium not only on being able to hire and train new
employees quickly, but to also make the assembly line method of building
burgers extremely easy to understand and quick to pick up. 

 One feature of Innovate was supposed to fix much
of that by streamlining the delivery of employee training and benefit data
through the system. Using the Internet to convey training information, such as
how to clean fryers or use the point-of-sale system, McDonald&apos;s hoped to
leverage their existing training system across this platform. 

 But helping with human resources was just a
small part of the $1 billion, five-year grand plan. McDonald&apos;s provided few
details about Innovate. However, current McDonald&apos;s information technology
managers, who spoke on condition of anonymity; former McDonald&apos;s Chief
Information Officer Carl Dill, who worked at the company from 1982 to 1998; and
software consultants close to the project confirmed McDonald&apos;s lofty
intentions. 

 According to those individuals, an Oracle
enterprise resource planning system, which can handle most day-to-day business
functions, would serve as the hub. The Oracle software would run on Sun
Microsystems Sun Fire Unix servers, replacing the company&apos;s homegrown IBM
mainframe general ledger accounting system, and enhancing or replacing virtually
every major back-office system in place at McDonald&apos;s used for finance,
supply-chain management and human resources. 

 But the innovation didn&apos;t stop there. Innovate
also would have monitored the temperatures of cooking and freezing appliances,
as well as the exact usage of food and packaging supplies. The theory was that
by working closely with suppliers and store managers, the company could improve
the consistency of the productfor example, all burgers would be cooked at the
exact same temperature and flipped at the exact same intervals at any
restaurant in the world. 

 In the process, McDonald&apos;s hoped to
instantaneously collect and send data to stores from the corporate office
simply by punching a few keystrokes. If a store in Seattle wasn&apos;t moving people
through the lines or drive-through as fast as others in the same general area,
McDonald&apos;s could ask the local manager to add another employee or two to the
lunch shift to improve service time. If one store wasn&apos;t moving as many McRib
pork sandwiches as others in the area, the corporate office could double-check
to make sure the restaurant had all the proper signage and marketing resources
in place. 

 McDonald&apos;s hoped to be able to let its
executives and managers see at any time of day how sales of any product at any
store were proceeding, where backup supplies sat anywhere between its stores
and its suppliers&apos; plants, and manage its stores accordingly. If there was a
run on salads in California, replenishing supplies could be rerouted from
trucks originally destined for Iowa. This would give McDonald&apos;s the power to
react to customer demand quickly, and draw substantial financial rewards from
the resulting efficiency. 

 Monitored remotely and, eventually, managed
remotely, the system would take a lot of the responsibilities away from
individual store managers. 

 Scheduling of crew members would be simplified
because the system would tell managers exactly how many customers ordered Big
Macs or Quarter Pounders between noon and 2 p.m. every day of the week. Predicting
the likely volume of salesnot only total sales, but also specific product
saleswould make it easier for a manager to pick and choose the specific
employees he or she wanted working the different spots on the burger assembly
line. 

 Eventually, McDonald&apos;s technology managers and
consultants say, the Internet-based network would have linked all of the
company&apos;s 30,000-plus restaurants and 300-plus approved vendors 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, to the back-office system at its corporate office in Oak
Brook. This would have given McDonald&apos;s executives a complete, instant picture
of the company&apos;s operations around the world, and, in theory, the ability to
act quickly when necessary to adjust the deployment of promotions and supplies
to meet demand. 

 While McDonald&apos;s already collects sales data
from many of its stores on a daily basis, the company&apos;s decade-old financial
reporting systemsbuilt on IBM&apos;s CICS transaction service and DB2
databaseweren&apos;t built with real-time business intelligence in mind. Different
units within McDonald&apos;s used different tools to get at that data, from batch
reports to data warehouse tools. McDonald&apos;s Canada, for instance, uses IBM&apos;s
Visual Warehouse tools to analyze marketing and promotional programs. Depending
on the location, McDonald&apos;s can only cull this data in a matter of days or
weeks. But with Innovate, executives would be able to analyze data from all
over the world from their Web browserit would give them a dashboard for
driving McDonald&apos;s business. 

 Taking it a step further, McDonald&apos;s may have
eventually moved in lockstep with its car-making brethren by using the system
to replace human workers, one of the most expensive and complicated components
of the model. Indeed, McDonald&apos;s 2002 corporate payroll topped $3.1 billion.
Some McDonald&apos;s stores already have installed machines that fill and distribute
soda to the service line. Eventually, the cooking, wrapping and frying of
burgers might have been handled by machinery, taking the troublesome and
unpredictable element of human crew members out of the equation altogether. If
every McDonald&apos;s restaurant in the chain eliminated just one minimum-wage
worker from each shift, each store could save $82.40 a day. It might not seem
like much, but taken across McDonald&apos;s 30,000-plus restaurantsthose owned by
McDonald&apos;s and those run by franchiseesthe automation of one job could save
about $900 million a year systemwide. 

 McDonald&apos;s also hoped to extend this detailed
flow of data to the kitchen itself, checking to ensure that the consistency of
products was maintained remotely. Though officials declined to confirm it,
several sources close to the company say Innovate eventually would have
incorporated Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) technology that would
have monitored every significant piece of equipment in each store. Every piece
of food storage and preparation hardware would be monitored and managed
remotely, ensuring consistency in the products worldwide and reducing the
employees needed to staff a typical McDonald&apos;s. 

 SNMP is the standard method used to monitor and
manage network equipment like routers, hubs and servers from network management
systems such as Hewlett-Packard&apos;s OpenView and Computer Associates&apos; Unicenter.
It provides a common way to pass status information from intelligent devices
back to a monitoring system over a network. With the addition of simple
electronic monitoring devices, a network connection, and an SNMP management
information base (a piece of software that interprets the data from the device
for the monitoring system), that&quot;intelligent device&quot;can be nearly
anythingincluding a freezer, a fryer, or a soda dispenser. 

 For instance, instead of reacting to a freezer
that had malfunctioned overnight, the manager would be alerted instantly by the
system to the problem. The system would also tell the manager which freezer
repair technicians were in the area and approved by McDonald&apos;s and provide the
technician with any historical data about the freezer or other McDonald&apos;s
equipment in need of repair. Early notice to an assistant manager at 10 p.m.
could be the difference between a $3 fuse and losing hundreds or thousands of
dollars&apos; worth of perishable products left unrefrigerated overnight. 

 Taking Innovate to its outer limits, the folks
in Oak Brook would have been able to track the exact temperature of the oil
used for french fries in any store connected to the network. How much syrup and
carbon dioxide was in each soda tower would have been monitored. 

 McDonald&apos;s knows that consistency and speed are
the cornerstones of its business. The impact could range from the superficial
to the disastrous. 

 If french fries in one restaurant had too much
oil or cook even two minutes longer than those at another restaurant, its
customers are going to know the difference. If a 16-year-old crew member isn&apos;t
cooking the beef patties long enough at the prescribed temperature of at least
140 degrees, an E. coli bacteria breakoutand millions of dollars in lost sales
and legal settlements, to say nothing of potential loss of human lifecould and
has happened. 

 In 1993, an E. coli outbreak at Jack in the Box
restaurants claimed the lives of four children. McDonald&apos;s also could use this
technology to make life easier for its franchisees by automatically generating
historical temperature logs for food safety reports required by the Food and
Drug Administration. And it also could alert owner-operators in the event of an
unusually large voided transaction at the drive-through window point-of-sale
system (suggesting that a crew member might be pocketing money instead of
putting it in the register). 

 McDonald&apos;s wasn&apos;t the only quick-service chain
at least thinking about the potential of SNMP. In 2001, Burger King began a
trial of SNMP-based monitoring in restaurants in England with equipment from
Opto 22, a Temecula, Calif.-based systems integrator. Network-based monitoring
is common in European grocery chains concerned with stock spoilage and strict
local health regulations. 

 &quot;This wasn&apos;t a new idea by any means,&quot;says Michael Disabato, a senior analyst at Midvale, Utah-based Burton Group and
former information technology manager at McDonald&apos;s.&quot;We were talking
about this 10 years ago. But when we first proposed this, [McDonald&apos;s
executives] just laughed at us. Because it came from the technology group and
not the operations people, it wasn&apos;t taken seriously. This was a recurring
problem at McDonald&apos;s.&quot;
