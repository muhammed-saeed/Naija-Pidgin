Tips on what to eat (and what to avoid)

With the variety of wonderful things to eat out there, it&apos;s no wonder that a large percentage of our society is overweight. However, food is necessary, and you don&apos;t have to give up all good things to maintain a healthy weight. The key to weight loss is moderation and a diet that includes all of the nutrients essential for life, energy and health.

Maintaining a Healthy Diet

It can be so tempting when you&apos;re on your lunch break to run to the nearest fast food restaurant and order a burger and fries. While that might satisfy you now, chances are, you&apos;ll be hungry again later; the food you just ate isn&apos;t rich enough in nutrients to sustain your body as long as it should.
 
Try bringing a healthy lunch instead, or at least choose fast food options that are better for you, like a salad or even a wrap. Don&apos;t fall into the trap of thinking that because it has lettuce it&apos;s healthy for you, though. Read the nutrition facts on every food label or on restaurants&apos; websites to make sure that you&apos;re really getting something good and not just more empty calories.

Food nutrition facts are listed on the side of just about every box and package in the supermarket. They list the nutrients – fat, carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals, etc. – and tell you exactly how much of each is in each serving, as well as how many calories. Nutrition facts are a helpful tool in deciding what&apos;s best to eat, and they can also help you lose weight and lower cholesterol.

Nutrition Guides

If you want to go on a diet, don&apos;t pick one of the many fad diets that don&apos;t work and don&apos;t take your health into account. Instead, use a nutrition guide, such as the USDA&apos;s Food Pyramid, to help you craft a diet that will facilitate healthy, lasting weight loss .

Nutrition guides list the recommended amount of food from each food group that you should be eating in a day. There are four food groups – dairy, protein, grains, and fruits and vegetables. The recommended amounts vary depending on the age and weight of the person in question, but as a general rule, you should be eating 5 to 12 servings of fruits and vegetables, 1 to 2 servings of protein, up to 3 servings of dairy, and up to 5 servings of whole grains in a day. Don&apos;t forget, water is important for your health, as well — 6 to 8 glasses per day is the recommended amount.

If you&apos;re confused about which foods help you lose weight and foods that lower cholesterol, consult a dietician or doctor, someone who specializes in human nutrition. They can help you find a personal diet that will help you maintain a healthy weight and get the nutrition required for your fitness level.
