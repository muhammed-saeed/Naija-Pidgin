Survey Shows Most On-The-Go Foods Are Being Consumed At Home
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the popularity of on-the-go foods is more about convenience than portability, as most consumers (72%) say they consume on-the-run meals in the home. According to a survey conducted online by InsightExpress, 9 out of 10 consumers purchase portable convenience foods. The study also found that convenience foods, defined as ready-to-eat/easy-to-prepare and portable, have become so popular that Americans are eating them at nearly every meal, with 3 out of 10 reporting they are purchasing more convenient food products this year than last.

The most common locations to eat on-the-go foods include: At Home (72%), In the car (44%), At the office (39%), At a recreational activity (17%) and At school (14%). Despite their intended portability, consumers select on-the-go foods based upon reduced preparation time (70%), individual packaging (34%), and taste (28%). Nearly 3 out of 4 (72%) shoppers say that portable foods act as a replacement for the meals or foods they used to eat.

With increasing daily time pressures and with more than half of consumers stating that on-the-go food is sometimes used as a meal replacement, this category continues to have enormous potential, said Lee Smith, President and COO, Insight Express.

 
Low-Carb&amp;Nutritionally Pulsed Bars Driving Growth Of Snack&amp;Granola Bars
Better-for-you, portability and dieting benefits are converging in food and beverage products with the Snack/Granola Bars category leading the growth, according to the latest Food-To-Go Shoppers Report from Information Resources, Inc.

The Snack and Granola Bars category has the best average growth rank of all food and beverage categories with estimated growth of $200 million or more and estimated growth rates of +20% or more, according to the report. Traditionally, bars consumers have come from households with kids. Bars have created an easy-to-consume, healthier breakfast or snack alternative to match the increasingly busier lifestyles of Americans today. However, with the growing interest in wellness and nutritionally enhanced foods, adults are also getting into the bar category. This activity is being driven by either dieting, in the case of low-carb- seeking consumers, or healthier living, in the case of more fitness-focused consumers. Wellness bar growth is strong with the more adult oriented, low carb or nutritionally pulsed bars combined accounting for 38% of what is now almost a $2 billion dollar category. While over a 5-year span, the overall Snack/Granola Bars category has enjoyed a +17% composite annual growth rate, the wellness segment has achieved +32% composite annual growth rate. Low-carb brands have grabbed 13% share in the current year; other nutritionally pulsed bars (+energy, +protein, +fitness, or +diet/low-sugar) account for 25% share.

 
Study Shows Teens Want Healthy, Sweet Snacks&amp;Fast Foods
According to BuzzBack Market Research&apos;s recently published Teen Health&amp;Nutrition study, teens want healthy, sweet snacks and fast foods whose brands are easily recognized.

Highlights from the survey include: Teen Eating Behavior (Full Meals) Teen boys eat more full meals (2.3) per day vs. teen girls (2.0). Teen Snacking Behavior Teen boys snack more times per day (3.3) vs. teen girls (3.1). Top five snacks: 1.potato/tortilla chips (63%), 2.cookies (55%), 3.chewing gum (47%), 4.fresh fruit (47%), 5.ice cream (47%).

Criteria for what to eat: fresh (74%), easy/fast to prepare (71%), &quot;on the go&quot; food (61%), extra energy food (58%), vitamin source food (56%). Try more new food products. females (60%) vs. males (51%). Motivators for trying new food products. curious about it (71%), offered a new flavor (67%), looked appetizing (63%), convenient to prepare/eat (54%).

The study reveals opportunities for more gender-specific advertising and marketing, and product development opportunities to create healthier, quick meals and snack options, according to Carol Fitzgerald, President, BuzzBack Market Research.

 
More Attractive Coupon Offers Motivating Shoppers
Marketers continued to fine-tune promotional tactics during 2003, distributing fewer, but more attractive coupon offers. Consumers responded favorably to more attractive coupon offerings, pushing average redemption rates upward, according to CMS, a provider of promotion management solutions.

The average face value of manufacturers coupons offering to consumers increased 4.9% to .85. The percentage of coupons requiring multiple purchases decreased 1.0% and the average expiration period remained stable at 3 months. Marketers increasingly reached out to specific consumer groups, such as Hispanics, with more targeted offerings versus national mass coupon drops.

Retailers are increasingly turning to coupon promotions, ranging from simple offers to double the face value of manufacturers coupons to collaborating with manufacturers on store-specific promotions. Some are even using trade dollars to create their own coupon booklets, which may feature manufacturer-branded products along with their own private labels.

Coupon redemption patterns continue to be influenced by the consumers search for deals. Many shifted some of their grocery spending from conventional supermarkets to mass merchandisers, dollar stores and warehouse clubs. But many warehouse clubs do not yet accept manufacturers coupons, said Bob Carter, President, CMS. As a result, redemption of manufacturers coupons fell 3% to 3.5 billion coupons; but consumers still managed to save $2.8 billion.
