South Beach Wine&amp;Food Festival Cheap Seats: Tickets Under $100

 Pin It 
 
 Lesley Elliott At $225 per ticket, The Grand Tasting Village requires a major financial commitment. 
​ Although the South Beach Wine&amp;Food Festival is still a month away, the time to get those tickets is now. Indeed, some of the more popular events are sold out. You&apos;ve already missed the meaty Burger Bash, BBQ&amp;The Blues hosted by Food Network&apos;s &quot;Iron Chef&quot; Michael Symon, and Paula Deen&apos;s annual Sunday brunch (although it may not be the same now that she has to watch her diet). Many of the &quot; New York Times Dinner Series&quot; are also off the table, as well is your chance to mingle with Antonio Banderas, who is appearing at the festival on behalf of his winery in Spain.

So what&apos;s still available, and more importantly, affordable? The &quot;Grand Tasting Village&quot; should be upped to at least the size of a regional municipality for the $225 per ticket price. And &quot;Best of the Best&quot; better be the damn best; at the bargain cost of $350, we are thinking that everything should be topped with caviar or foie gras. Festival for the rest of us? Here&apos;s our round up of events that are priced under $100, get the cheap seats while you can.
