Oregon hospital costs hit $7.5 billion a year

Published: Saturday, January 16, 2010, 9:25 PM   Updated: Saturday, January 16, 2010, 9:25 PM 
 By Bill Graves, The Oregonian The Oregonian 
 Follow 77 Tweet Share close Digg Stumble Upon Fark Reddit Share Email Print Faith Cathcart/The Oregonian Registered Nurse Kim Graffwallner sets up an IV for Monica Ruiz, 29, in the emergency room of Legacy Good Samaritan. Ruiz, who suffers severe back pain from a car crash, has no health insurance in her work as a fast-food restaurant cashier. The hospital’s charity care, most of which is provided in the emergency room, climbed 108 percent between 2004 and 2008. 
Oregon hospitals are bracing for a tough year after investment losses, increases in charity care and expansion debts have pushed their costs to an average $2,800 per patient per day.

 View full size Collectively, Oregon’s 58 community hospitals in 2008 saw $7.5 billion in operating costs–about the same the state’s general fund spends on schools, universities, prisons, police and social services, according to the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems in a report summarizing hospital costs and trends.

While inflation in the Portland area climbed by 13 percent between 2004 and 2008, Oregon hospital costs climbed 40 percent, the report shows.

Oregon insurance companies blame rising hospital costs as the primary reason their premiums have climbed by double digits in recent years to an average of $13,378 a year for family coverage.

Health advocates and economists say rapidly rising health care costs in Oregon offer more evidence of the need for health reform at both the state and national levels.

Health care is commanding an ever greater share of the economy, said Laura Etherton, health policy advocate for Oregon State Public Interest Research Group. 

&quot;The bottom line is these costs aren&apos;t sustainable,&quot; she said, &quot;and we ought to be able to get better quality at lower costs.&quot;

Congress will try to bring rising costs under control by combining Senate and House health care reform plans into a final bill. Oregon&apos;s new Health Authority also is looking at changes, including collecting claims information to shed more light on hospital costs and results.

Hospital costs can crush families hit with serious injuries and illnesses. Paul and Jean Solomon, both 62-year-old Portland area residents battling serious diseases, say they spend $2,000 a month to hospitals, though their bills total about $9,000.

Paul Solomon, who has leukemia, diabetes and heart problems, gets disability pay and qualifies for early Medicare, he said. His wife, who has multiple sclerosis, collects Social Security. They devote the majority of their income to hospital bills, but still face close to $100,000 in medical debt, he said.

The couple sold their house, have no other debts, and are now burning through their retirement savings, said Solomon, a former bank fraud investigator.

 View full size &quot;I owe (hospitals) more money than I&apos;ll ever earn in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m embarrassed...But I made a decision. I chose life.&quot;

All but two of Oregon&apos;s hospitals are nonprofit, but they can still pay their executives high salaries, invest in new buildings and state-of-the art equipment and keep money that exceeds their costs. Their earnings above expenses are called margins, and their collective margin dropped from 6 percent of revenue and investment income in 2004 to 1 percent in 2008, the association reported.

With Oregon unemployment at 11 percent, thousands of Oregonians have lost their jobs and their health insurance.

Consequently, hospitals must rely on a shrinking pool of commercially insured patients to offset growing losses in charity care, bad debt–unpaid bills of people deemed able to pay–and payments from Medicare and Medicaid government insurance programs that they say fall short of their costs.

&quot;If nothing changes, hospitals are very definitely in trouble in Oregon,&quot; said Kevin Earls, vice president for policy for the hospital association.

Hospital executives say they also are getting hit by increasing costs for supplies, equipment, prescription drugs and nurses. Salem Hospital , for example, shifted to a $35 million electronic medical records system. The new system is improving quality, but not yet bringing efficiency savings, though it is expected to in time, said Aaron Crane, chief financial officer.

 View full size Many Oregon hospitals have expanded in recent years, adding wings and high-rises and filling them with expensive high-tech equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging scanners and surgery robots.

&quot;There is a reasonable argument that hospitals are over-extended in a number of different areas and ways,&quot; said David Rosenfeld, associate editor for The Lund Report , an online health care watchdog report. &quot;They are investing heavily in cardiac care and oncology (cancer care). These traditionally are large money makers.&quot;

John McConnell, health economist for Oregon Health&amp;Science University , said that for Portland newcomers in recent years, &quot;the way to find your way to the closest hospital was to look for a crane.&quot; Those expansions have &quot;to be clobbering some of them,&quot; he said. &quot;We all pay for it through higher premiums.&quot;

OHSU, for example, built its Center for Health and Healing, which primarily supplies ambulatory services and day surgery, and the five-floor Peter O. Kohler Pavilion, with more beds for cancer and cardiac care.

Hospital finances has been the surge in charity care, most of which is provided in hospital emergency rooms.

On one Monday evening this month, th e Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center emergency room in Northwest Portland hums with an orderly bustle as nurses and doctors in scrubs move between curtained examining cubicles and work stations filled with glowing flat screens.

Nearly all of the 15 examining berths have patients, and the emergency room is on track to see the typical 100 by day&apos;s end. Most of the patients are older, averaging age 60, and their most common ailment this afternoon is weakness and a shortness of breath.

In Room 12, lies Monica Ruiz, 29, whose eyes tear with pain from a back injury she got in a car crash five years ago. Her back always hurts, she says, but this afternoon it flared into excruciating pain. Like a growing number of patients showing up at Good Samaritan and other Oregon emergency rooms, Ruiz gets no health insurance for her work as a fast-food restaurant cashier.

That&apos;s part of the reason Oregon hospitals, including Good Samaritan, saw their charity care costs double between 2004 and 2008 to $561 million, according to the hospital association. Bad debt also climbed 56 percent to $422 million during that period.

Because more people are losing their jobs and insurance, more resist coming to the emergency room until they have no choice, says Jennifer Thornburgh, a nurse and emergency room manager.

&quot;People are being very careful about what they are being seen for and are not rushing to the hospital for every complaint,&quot; she says.

That may be one reason there are no patients this afternoon across the hall in the ambulatory care unit, where people are treated for less serious injuries and illnesses.

Even people with insurance are having trouble paying their rising deductibles and copays, said Terry Smith, chief executive officer for the Providence Health System , which operates eight hospitals and employs 17,000 workers in Oregon.

Consequently, Providence hospitals are seeing their charity and bad debt costs accelerate, he said. In 2000, those costs added up to about $8 million; this year they&apos;re going to exceed $80 million, he said.

Economic hardship also is driving more people to put off care, such as elective hip replacement surgery, when they have a choice, said Pamela Vukovich, chief financial officer for Legacy Health. People are deciding &quot;just to be in pain longer,&quot; she said.

Nationally, the recession curbed health spending in 2008 to the slowest pace in 48 years, according to a report by the Department of Human Services. Spending on health care was up 4.4 percent in 2008 from the previous year, totaling $2.3 trillion.

Hospitals in Oregon operate more efficiently than most in the country, with shorter stays and fewer admissions per capita, the hospital association reports. The average stay in Oregon hospitals, for example, is 4.2 days, the third lowest in the country behind Idaho and Wyoming.

Still, Oregon hospitals over the last year made cuts in staff, equipment purchases and building expansions to reduce expenses. Salem Hospital announced in October it is making $9.3 million in cuts, about a third from labor costs, after experiencing losses for the first time in nine years.

 Cascade Healthcare Community , which operates hospitals in Bend, Redmond and Prineville, reduced labor expenses 5 percent last year by cutting 75 positions and reducing all salaries by 5 percent between February and November. Some positions have since been added back.

OHSU Hospital also made cuts in staff and put a two-year freeze on capital spending.

Oregon hospitals expect to see only a slight increase in admitted patients this year, but they also expect those patients will be older and sicker and more of them will be uninsured. They can also expect to see continuing political pressure for reform.

Health care advocates and economists say making hospital costs clearer and changing pay incentives to reward prevention and discourage unnecessary procedures could help bring hospital costs under control.

&quot;We are doing things to patients that are not necessarily helping people,&quot; McConnell said.
