Electric Griddles

 Electric Griddles are for fast paced, rapid heating and cooling environments. Electric models tend to heat up a bit quicker and have less cold zone areas than traditional gas models, making electric models a great way to go when you need to cook evenly on all parts of your cooking surface. They come in thermostatic control only, meaning every one of these models are able to be set to a specific temperature.
