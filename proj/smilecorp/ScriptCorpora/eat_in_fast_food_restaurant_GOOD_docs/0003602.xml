 Jack In The Box Introduces Self Service Kiosks? Near my house there is a Jack In The Box&amp;went to get food for dinner and noticed there was a kiosk machine near the registers. There was a gal next to it insisting that we use the machine to input what we wanted.

First thing I thought, OH my this machine is great but isn&apos;t it going to replace YOU (refers to the gal next to the machine)

I managed to follow along the glitzy touch screen and the womans voice guiding us as I bounced around from screen to screen.

The machine takes cash&amp;credit cards

Upisde, you do NOT have to give your first name and do not have to repeat it 2-3 times if the cashier just did not grasp your name.

 I came across such device at a Taco Bell years ago down in Irvine, CA. The way I see it, it&apos;s a computerized twist on those machines they have in Japan where you look at the plastic model dishes, select and pay the vending machine, get your receipt stub, and go in to be served by the staff. Personally, I like them since you don&apos;t have to repeat as you&apos;ve mentioned. I&apos;m sure it helps cut cost overhead for the franchise. Instead of two cashiers taking orders, have two kiosks and one worker to bring the food out.

 Guess it depends on how one views it. You figure now you need field techs to maintain such systems so it&apos;s a job elsewhere.

 Re: Jack In The Box Introduces Self Service Kiosks? So maybe it would be a decrease of entry level jobs (fast food cashier), but increase in high tech computer programming and repairs. So, were do the people with limited reading skills fit in, or sight impaired, etc. Unless it is like at the airport, where there are backup people to help with the kiosks. __________________

 Re: Jack In The Box Introduces Self Service Kiosks? Perhaps vocational training? Ultimately, isn&apos;t this just society progressing? College used to be for the elite, now it&apos;s available to everyone who wants it.

Going back to topic, a self service drive through kiosk would be great, no more deciphering garbled voices on a bad speaker box.

 When that happens, I like to do my human beat box routines.

 Sorry, I was not clear in my posting. When I asked about limited reading ability, I was speaking about the customers. What happens to customers who have limited reading ability, or sight? Is there a&quot;live person&quot;for backup to help people who are not wanting to use a machine?
Pushing the public into the computer age is just fine, if you do not mind losing customers in the process.

 And in the meantime, people are paying more for mainland products to be shipped over here. Especially milk, which as I understand, is not properly refrigerated during its open sea journey. That&apos;s one aspect of standard of living I&apos;d like to see corrected in the near future!

 I would guess the staff that&apos;s bringing out the order would have the secondary function to assist customers with the kiosks. What I&apos;ve noticed at places that do employ self-service kiosks, they don&apos;t do away with the traditional checkout all together, but they do significantly remove the number of them.

 It&apos;s not like the local producers could do it for less. That&apos;s why they went out of business.

 Thirty years ago, people were skeptical about bank ATMs for the same reasons you give. And look at where we are today. Everybody uses ATMs now. Young, old. College grad, high school dropout.

It&apos;s not a matter of&quot;if&quot;fast-food eateries will use self-service kiosk technology, but&quot;when.&quot; __________________

I dunno if its ALL locations or its a test run but its STILL sits right off to the right at the counter. Haven&apos;t seen much activity even with the free 2 tacos incentive if you use the machine.

 Yes, but banks also offer a walk up counter. That was my question about kiosks for fast food, would there also be a walk up counter option? If both options are available, then perfect for everyone. __________________

 I don&apos;t see why not. Automated technology has not progressed to the point that human labor is not needed to cook the food and to clean the dining area. Self-service kiosk systems may also need occasional downtime in order to be serviced and maintained. So nobody&apos;s talking about totally eliminating human cashiers. There may be less of a need for cashiers, which would save the restaurants money. Or they could turn that cashier into someone who helps out in the kitchen, which would speed up service.

As far as vending machines go,.... uh yes. Having not lived as a hermit, I am aware of the existence of pre-packed/ready-to-consume food&amp;drink vending machines. The self-service kiosks for a fast food restaurant (which takes orders from the customers and relays them to the kitchen) are quite a different animal, though. And as of April 2009, such machines are far from being in the majority of restaurants in this country. But I believe that as the technology is improved and fine-tuned, its use and acceptance will quickly grow in the next few years. __________________

 There are advances in touch-screen technology already available that make them accessible to the blind/visually-impaired, but they aren&apos;t used in many settings yet, besides voting machines. __________________

 More and more bank ATMs out there accomodate the blind. Those audio headphone jacks and braille keypads aren&apos;t just there for looks.

But why would this ever be an issue with fast-food kiosks? Once again folks, nobody&apos;s talking about doing away with all human cashiers. Assuming a restaurant is open for walk-up customers, there will be a live person working there who can assist a blind patron or anybody else with special needs. __________________
