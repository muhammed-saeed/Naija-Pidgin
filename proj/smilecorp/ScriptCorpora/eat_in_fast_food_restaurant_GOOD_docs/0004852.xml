The Really Big Guide To Secret Menu Items
 By Meg Marco on February 26, 2007 6:20 PM Short URL: http://con.st/239708 
 UPDATE: We&apos;re looking to update this list. Click here to help! 
Not content ordering from the menu? Need to have that extra little bit of class that comes from &quot;knowing the chef&quot;?

Here it is, your guide to secret menu items. Sure, it&apos;s not the secret rib eye at Nobu, but it&apos;s something. Before reading this please note that this article has not been fact-checked. This report is based purely on reader suggestions. We are posting them entirely without confirmation and are not going to try to order any of this crap in order to confirm its existence. We would die of heart disease, be broke, and our ass would be the size of Texas. This is the internet, the internet is not fact-checked, and these are your secret menu items. Enjoy.



 Taco Bell: Everything Taco Bell makes is comprised of a few basic ingredients, so they&apos;ll likely make anything they have the stuff for, which is probably pretty much anything they&apos;ve ever served. Examples to attempt: Cheesy Gordita Crunch, Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes, Encharito.

 Wendy&apos;s: A tipster tells us, &quot;order a &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, It would otherwise be called a Classic Quadruple, were it on the menu.&quot; Reader bringafajita suggests trying to get a &quot;Quarter Pound Double Stack with Cheese.&quot; FishingCrue tells us to try &quot;Everything&quot; (lettuce and tomato) on a Wendy&apos;s Double Stack, sometimes it&apos;s even free. If they look at you like you&apos;re crazy, tell them there&apos;s a button for it. A double stack with everything, add bacon is a decent sandwich for somewhere south of 2 bones.&quot;

 Chipotle : Chipotle will, like Taco Bell, make anything they have the ingredients for. Unlike Taco Bell, this is an official policy. Some suggestions: Nachos, Quesadilla, Individual Tacos, Taco Salads, Tiny Bean Burritos Using Taco Shells, Fresh Cilantro on Your Tacos, whatever you can think of.

 Subway: Subway will still make the &quot;pizza sub,&quot; and many other former menu items. Also, they can&apos;t sell &quot;broken cookies,&quot; so they may give you some for free.

 Jamba Juice: Jamba has an entire secret menu of &quot;unhealthy&quot; smoothies named after things that would involve copyright violations were they to be included on the menu. The ones we know of:White Gummi Bear, Red Gummi Bear, Green Gummi Bear, Raspberry Dreamin&apos;, Pineapple Dreamin&apos;, Sourpatch Kid, Tropical Tango, Pacific Passion, Berry Depressing, Now and Later, Peanut Butter and Jelly, Apple Pie, Fruity Pebbles, Rainbow Sherbet, Strawberry Shortcake, Push Pop, Skittles, Andres&apos; Surprise, and Lemonade Lightnin&apos;. (Thanks, ronaldscott !) 
 
 In-N-Out Burger : Has their &quot;secret&quot; menu posted on their website , but a tipster writes in: &quot;Not only can you get an animal style burger but you can also get animal style fries which are amazing. It&apos;s fries piled with onions, cheese and sauce and they come with a fork.&quot; In addition, we hear several voices calling from the mist, whispering that the secret menu doesn&apos;t stop at 4 x 4. , but may, in fact, go on to infinity. Or at least to 100 x 100...
 (Thanks, xapplexjuicex!) 

 Starbucks: Starbucks will make you absolutely anything you want no matter how insane it is, according to our tipster.
 &quot;Baristas might try and tell their customers that no, we can&apos;t do that with the blenders. This is a lie. Starbucks corporate policy is that the customer is ALWAYS right (even when the request is stupid). If you really insist that you want your iced soy latte blended, the baristas HAVE to do it. If they continue to refuse, ask to speak to a manager and either they&apos;ll realize they&apos;re about to get in trouble and will fill your request, or the manager will come out and politely tell the barista to make the customer happy.

Absolutely any concoction that you can think of (involving any type of milk, syrup, coffee, etc.) will be made for you. The limits to Starbucks &quot;secret menu&quot; are merely the limits of your imagination. You can even bring supplements from home and ask the barista to please include that in your drink.&quot;
 
Well, damn.

 Dairy Queen: Reader Falconfire says: &quot;I couldn&apos;t even begin to tell you the list of Dairy Queen secret menu items. Lets put it this way, there is a huge book every DQ has to have, you want it, it&apos;s in there. It may not be listed as a item, but the instruction on how to make it and what to use are in there as well as how it is rung up. About the only thing they cant make is seasonal items, since they usually require a ingredient not carried normally.&quot;

 Chili&apos;s: According to Reader Elara , they no longer have chili on the menu (what?) but if you ask them, they&apos;ll bring you a cup.

 Blimpie: Attention veggie-lovers: Reader VeryFancyBunny says: &quot;Blimpie used to have a sandwich called the &quot;Cheese Trio&quot; on the menu. They took it off years ago (at least around here), but I&apos;ve been able to order it with no problem. Otherwise, all their sandwiches involve meat.&quot;

 Burger King: Try the &quot;mustard whopper,&quot; a whopper with mustard rather than mayo, from Reader dwneylonsr , and the &quot;veggie whopper&quot; from VeryFancyBunny , which is just a whopper with the meat omitted. Reader sixtoe suggests attempting to get the &quot;Bull&apos;s-Eye BBQ Burger.&quot;

 Popeye&apos;s: mullenite suggests ordering the &quot;Naked Chicken,&quot; which is chicken with no breading. Sounds very Atkins.

 TGIFriday&apos;s: Readers junkmail and mullenite tell us that TGIF have a &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; policy that says they&apos;ll make anything you want with the crap they&apos;ve got in the kitchen.

 Denny&apos;s: Speaking of Five Easy Pieces , Reader weave says: &quot;Don&apos;t expect a secret menu at Denny&apos;s. I went in there and asked for a grilled cheese sandwich and they were baffled. They finally decided to give me Moons over My Hammy and toss out the ham -- and charge me the full price for it.&quot; Did she hold the ham between her knees?

and finally, at Arby&apos;s: sixtoe likes the &quot;French Dip.&quot;

Thanks to everyone for sharing their knowledge of the wild and woolly world of nationwide chain restaurants. You are the heroes. Let your indigestion be a mark of your bravery.

Did we forget something? If you&apos;d like to suggest an item for this guide, email tips [at] consumerist [dot] com. Put &quot;Secret Menu&quot; in the subject.

I’m a former Starbucks Barista, and I can tell you that what you say is mostly true, but the main limit is the Health Code, which pretty much forbids the company (in most places) from using stuff people bring from home.

Also, there’s some stuff they REALLY can’t put in the blender, due to health code, and if they do, they can get in serious trouble, depending on the state codes.

Examples of stuff I was asked to do, but couldn’t:

Cut a lemon up (due to type of store food service license)

Use a customer’s Rice milk in making an iced latte (we gave her shots over ice instead, and she added the rice milk)

Steam a customer’s goats milk (not allowed at all, if you see a barista steaming something that a customer brought in, please report it to health officials)

Toast a bagel

Microwave a bagel (these may have changed at stores that now have the breakfast sandwhiches, as they require a modified food service permit, at least in IL)

Blend a cookie into a drink

Things I was asked to do that I did:

make an“iced cappuccino”(a cappuccino is made from steamed and foamed milk, and when it is iced, it makes a kind of disgusting sludge, as compared to an iced latte, which is made with cold milk, some markets will not allow this, as it’s considered to be“insanitary”)

steam milk above a certain temperature or below a certain temperature (just not allowed by the health code where i worked)

I could name dozens of things from both categories, but i think you get the gist of things.

Okay, okay so I love secret menus, don’t get me wrong, Animal Style fries made my adolescence lovely (occasionally lol). BUT the post about Starbucks..if someone tells you that they can’t make something…youre going to ask to see their manager? Has anyone ever worked in customer service here? My goodness. I work at a Chipotle-style burrito place called Qdoba and people ask us to put stuff on the Quesadilla press all the time. I’m not a bitch, but we can’t do that..it’ll ruin the machine. If I said no and someone asked to see my manager I think I’d be a little peeved. I think secret menus are fun but let’s not make those of us who make minimum wage’s lives hell because youre bored!
Okay, there’s my rant..sorry(:

I have only seen it at about 5 Jamba locations, but some folks know how to make a Big Sandy.

It is simply a Mango Mantra, with a Heart Happy boost and the“secret”part is the 1 oz shot of wheat grass they put in it. It tastes green and sweet at the same time. If you get it with two ounces, it’s named a Hank, since I am the only one who gets it that way.

If you can post this, maybe word will get around, so the rest of the stores can make it, too. It’s still kind of hard to find.

Thanks,

Hank

Can’t you order a captain 52 or something like that at in-n-out in order to get the fries on the burger?

Denny’s…I didn’t want bacon, sausage or ham with my order, so I asked If I could have some hash browns. The girl said yes, but then came back and said I HAD to choose a meat. She couldn’t even give them to me for a few extra cents or whatever. I didn’t want them enough to order them as a separate item.

One thing to keep in mind for the secret menus is that you have to know how to make it yourself in some cases (in particular ingredients). I know that any jamba juice nearby asks me what goes n the“specialty”drinks

The Starbucks thing is mostly true. I managed a Starbucks up until 5 months ago, and we will blend anything you want together (and charge you for it). However it is against company policy to blend anything we don’t sell in the store. This is a food safety issue and quality concern. Also if you like mixing syrups and keep it within the amount normally put in a drink, they shouldn’t charge extra, i.e. A Venti latte gets 6 pumps of syrup, it doesn’t matter if you mix and match. However if you mix and get more than 6 pumps they are supposed to charge for the additional syrup. If you choose just one syrup you can get unlimited pumps though.

I have in fact ordered the Matterhorn at Baskin Robbins, its not on the menu, but most stores have old training guides lying around from when it was

At Starbucks, is brown sugar (the one with molasses, not the unbleached kind) reserved for the cereal only (as conveyed by the cashier|baritsa)? Or, is it possible to have ~1.75 teaspoon of brown sugar for a small Americano (with chocolate&amp;bit of steamed milk)?

Jack-in-the-Box will also make anything you want as long as they have the ingredients.

I personally like to order a Jumbo Jack with an egg on it.

Chili’s never took chili off the menu; I don’t know how this idea got started. It’s there, listed with the soups, like it always has been.
 bender123 August 19, 2011 12:45 PM 
Heres one…Taco Johns: Super hot sauce. Just ask for“green sauce”or“super hot”and you get a fresh cup of pureed jalapenos to put on your tex-mex fare.

If you like Capn’Crunch with Crunchberries, try this: At Starbucks order a Strawberries and Cream frapp, add +1 shot of hazlenut and +1 toffeenut. Hollyyyyy Crunchberries! Awesome drink!
 mistersmith August 19, 2011 2:31 PM 
In-n-Out does NOT go past 4×4 now. Those frat boys that got the 100×100 ruined it for everyone, it’s now policy to top out at 4. No matter how nicely you ask.

I used to work at a TGI Friday’s and remember delivering chicken parmesan to a customer when it was not a menu item. The manager visited the table to make sure the customer liked it. They also carry all the crap to make any of your discontinued favorites from the menu, as far as I know. Try ordering the orange chicken last featured in like 1999. I bet they crank it out.

Why is the consumerist telling people how to kill themselves faster and cheaper?

because this is America and there is freedom of speech?

just like you have the freedom to read the site or go elsewhere. But you are here, aren’t you?
