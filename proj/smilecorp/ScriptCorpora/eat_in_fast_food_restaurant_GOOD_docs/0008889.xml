RE: Home-Cooked Meals Your Family Will Love

From:  A lexandra &quot;Ma&quot; Fitzpatrick 

 

 

 

Dear Health-Conscious Parent,

 W e all want what&apos;s best for our children. 

And nothing is more important than making sure they have proper
 nutrition everyday.

But the stresses of daily life - work, errands,
 outside obligations and more - can make fixing dinner into a dreaded
 chore that we never get around to completing. 

When
you add the &quot;convenience&quot; of fast food restaurants, the results can be
sobering -- kids growing up on french fries, processed foods and
unhealthy, sugary drinks aren&apos;t getting the nutrition they need, and
worse, can face dire health complications down the line as unhealthy
eating habits become ingrained. 

Who has time
to make dinner when there is so much else to do during the day?

And how
 can you hope to convince kids who have been living on fast food and
 cola that they need to eat their veggies?

It can seem like a hopeless
 task to bring healthy mealtimes back to your family&apos;s dinner table, but
 it doesn&apos;t have to be that way....

 

Imagine
 being able to cook meals that your kids will rave about, again and
 again.

Picture being able to give kids healthy choices because YOU know
 how to get them excited about eating healthy- turning the foods they though they hated into foods they can&apos;t wait to eat.

And
 imagine how proud you&apos;ll be when your kids start picking up on those
 healthy eating habits and start making healthful choices on their own!

You
 can make more than just food in the kitchen...

You can make memories that
 your family will cherish for a lifetime.

Cooking together lets everyone
 contribute and share an enjoyable moment.

What&apos;s even better -- being
 able to eat the result! You&apos;ll have more interaction with your kids,
 and teach them some great habits along the way.

Never
 worry about having to stop at a fast food restaurant just to get your
 kidss to eat.

With my recipe book, you&apos;ll have the makings of a great
 dinner at your fingertips each and every night.

These fast, simple
 recipes have all the nutrients parents want their kids to have, and all
 the flavors that kids love to eat - it&apos;s a win-win for everyone!

 

 These are the same recipes I cook at home every day:  Everything I&apos;ve included in my recipe book is something I&apos;ve personally
fed my family. 

 And as the mother of 3 boys, I know how picky kids can
 be. 

 These recipes are Kid-tested and Mom-approved so you never have to
 worry that your child won&apos;t enjoy his meal. 

 I&apos;ve
included recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so you can be
prepared no matter what time of day it is. 

 And I&apos;ve chosen recipes that
 are inexpensive and simple to make... 

 You don&apos;t have to be a gourmet chef
 to whip up a delicious meal. All you need is a little time, a few simple
 ingredients, and the recipes that I&apos;ll give to you first-hand.  

 In
fact, these recipes are so simple that you can let your children help
you - and what better way to teach the importance of healthy foods than
to have everyone pitching in in the kitchen? 

 Enjoy your time together
 and create a delicious meal that everyone can be proud of!
