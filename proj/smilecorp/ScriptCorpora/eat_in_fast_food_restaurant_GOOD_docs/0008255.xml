A Creative and Artistic Take on the Traditional Restaurant Sign

At Best Menu Boards all of our illustrations and lettering were originally hand painted and designed. Take a look through our gallery  to see the menu boards we have created for past clients. If you don’t see exactly what you’re looking for, don’t worry! You can use our design studio  to custom design your own menu board so that you get exactly what you need. We specialize in marketing your brand and business. Feel free to contact us to learn more about our customizable menu boards.

Ensure your Restaurant Menu Board is Functional

Since we’re the most creative menu board manufacturer we have designed unique, no-smudge chalkboards, so you never have to worry about someone spilling on or rubbing up against your chalkboard. We use Zig Posterman Markers , a unique, durable liquid chalk marker which we include for free with all of our menu boards. These liquid chalk markers allow you to write your menu items and daily specials on your menu boards with the look of chalk. However, they are much more functional than traditional chalk because they don’t smudge and are water-proof. Our liquid chalk markers easily wash off with ammonia based window cleaner.

 Browse our gallery  to take a look at our products, illustrations and designs. Then, contact us to order a best menu board today!
