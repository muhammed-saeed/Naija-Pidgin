WORTH THE WAIT.

This is my favorite burger of all time. It&apos;s just perfect. The bun, the meat, the cheese, everything. Fries are optional. I get two burgers and a shake.

Worth the calories.

NOM NOM NOM.

There&apos;s a burger war brewing, and I&apos;m on Shake Shack&apos;s side! My west coast friends love themselves some In&amp;Out burgers, but I&apos;ll take Shake Shack any day!

Tasty burgers and crispy crinkle cut fries in an outdoor setting make me feel young again.

I came here in February, shivering in the 28 degree weather. I had not thought too much about it until I recently saw that Kate Hudson and Ginnifer Goodwin movie, where practically every on screen meal takes place here! I began to crave Shake Shack!! Product placement works!

Real hefty burger to enjoy with outdoor seating.
Note: 4.5 stars

First time having Shake Shack, yes indeed, a NY native and a Shake Shack virgin for so long?! Well, with this amount of time, there&apos;s plenty of hype heard about the magnificence that are the almighty Shake Shack burgers.
Got to the park stand by 11:20a and already there&apos;s a line. So heads up for those who think lunch hour doesn&apos;t start at 11a-ish. Waited about 20 minutes and got my order very smoothly. Even with such crowds and rush of orders, the cashier was quick and friendly.
Next, waiting for the food took a little over 10 minutes due to the high volume rush. Note, some corporate workers may have a sheet of orders to bag. One sure did today, got an excel sheet with names, numbers, and what have you to order.
With the condiment stand off to the left of the food pick up spot, I prepped up the napkins, straws, and ketchup revving to go. Once the little alert remote vibrated, time to pick up the food. The food received was very delicious to look at and so comfortably warm. Again, the worker that dispersed the orders was friendly too.
I got the shack stack - cheeseburger with a portobello and lettuce tomato, shack burger - cheese, lettuce and tomato, arnold palmer - lemonade/iced tea mix, and a regular non-sweetened iced tea.
The shack burger looked like any regular burger, but much prettier. Better organized and displayed.
I ate the Shack stack and it was good. Extra cheesy and smooth with the Shake Shack sauce. BUT, with so much hype heard about Shake Shack, this burger wasn&apos;t the greatest thing in the burger universe though it is one of the saltiest in aftertaste. Perhaps I should&apos;ve gotten a different one, definitely willing to partake Shake Shack again.
The drinks were nothing special. Regular unsweetened iced tea, sugar is at the condiment stand. The arnold palmer mix wasn&apos;t too pleasant at first, but it plateaued to an okay taste after the 2nd sip - especially helpful with such a salty Shack stack.

Overall, definitely a spot to grab a burger for lunch. Don&apos;t know how I forgot to try their fries - so irregular to not have a side with a burger. Well, definitely a next time and looking forward to chugging down a shake and a different burger. Very good, but not great, yet worth a try - 4.5 stars!

Shake Shack has all the components of a cult burger revolution: exciting, yet convenient location--Madison Square Park; outrageous line length, often boasting an assortment of odd characters, whether in front or behind; and a &quot;special sauce.&quot; Aside from these few aspects, they do have shakes. And fries. Moving on.

The secret sauce is more tart than the standard &quot;Thousand Island&quot; sorts of cryptic spreads for an American staple such as the iconic hamburger. They are keeping it straightforward with Cheddar, though. To round it all out, the bun is extremely soft and buttery. Our meat was juicy and offered a touch of juiciness.

On the whole, I figured the burger was not anything super unique, but it is certainly worth the wait. Now, as I analyzed the burger as an entity, I found that it was indeed above par, meaning superior to fast food, but for the experience, you pretty much can&apos;t beat a meat and bun combination from Shake Shack.

No one is gonna read this review, but I wanted to put my two cents out there. Unfortunately, it has lost its &quot;local&quot; feel, with it being spread around town nowadays, but you honestly won&apos;t get more of a true New York burger experience unless you get to this specific location, the original.

Oh, it was a little odd seeing a woman assisting her small boys in peeing into a bag right next to the Shack Shack line. Perhaps she reminded them to &quot;shake.&quot; I found it to be pretty unappetizing. Fortunately, I had already downed my burger.

I like this place as much as the other guy.  Definitely a nice backyard style burger with fresh toppings.  It is worth the wait if you have the time and want the full experience with a bunch of your closest friends.

Tip 1:  Visit this place when it forecasts rain.  You can get to the front of the line with only slight drizzle.

Tip 2:  Check out the cool park with the strange &quot;musical&quot; artwork nearby

Tip 3:  Enjoy ... sure it&apos;s fast food, but good quality and worth the calories.

The original shake shack in nyc, I remember when you couldn&apos;t go here without waiting an hour to order!  Since they have opened up more restaurants around the city, I have found that it is less of a wait, but still great quality food.

The experience is always wonderful for me, because I have met with countless friends in madison square park to enjoy beautiful days.

The food:
Their highlights are their milkshakes and burgers.  There is a burger for everyone: the best ones in my opinion are the shack stack, shroom burger, and cheeseburger, depending on your mood.
Their milkshakes are sweet and filling.  I love their vanilla and strawberry the best, but my friends also go for the chocolate/vanilla.
They also have custards which they change up during the week and are a big hit as well!

To note: there is a &quot;B&quot; line which is a shorter line, but you cannot get burgers, shakes, or fries, so I&apos;ve never stood in this line!!

Went here with a friend of mine on his recommendation and got the Shack Stack and a &quot;Black and White&quot; (chocolate/vanilla) milkshake.

The Shack Stack is nominally just a normal burger with a cheese-stuffed deep-fried mushroom in the middle. However, the whole, in this case, is better than the sum of its parts. The patty is juicy but doesn&apos;t overwhelm the rest of the burger. The mushroom provided both a crispy (fried outside) and creamy (melted cheese in the middle) texture, and the rather-heavy taste of the patty and mushroom is complemented by fresh lettuce and tomatoes. A perfectly balanced burger with a nice little twist.

But the best part of the meal is the milkshake. It tasted like a dipped ice cream bar meets a blender (in a good way); chocolate and vanilla blends together in an indescribable way. So I won&apos;t attempt to do so and encourage you to try for yourself! :)

Strangely enough, I&apos;m not a big fan of burgers, but I&apos;d gladly serve a term as the president of the Shake Shack fan club.

When I had my first Shake Shack burger (it the good ole days) it was a strictly NY burger joint. I used to take my out-of-town guests from PA and DC here. Now it has expanded to their towns, so I have nothing to leverage against them anymore =(

I recommend going all out with the &quot;Shake Stack&quot; burger. It&apos;s a cheeseburger with a fried portobello mushroom (that also has melted cheese on it). It is burger perfection. It&apos;s pretty large, so I usually just share the burger with a friend.

PS. Since there are usually ridiculously long lines for the Madison square location, you should BE TECH SAAVY and monitor the shake shack camera to gauge the length of the queue.

When it comes to burgers, Shake Shack never disappoints... and I wish it would so that I wouldn&apos;t keep returning. Thank god I have the self control to limit my visits to twice a year. As far as fries and shakes, I&apos;ve def had better elsewhere, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve had a better cheeseburger. We stood in line in the brutal heat yesterday for close to an hour to get our SS fix but it was worth the wait because we were all very happy/fat campers at the end of our meal. They even gave my little nephew a free ice cream which was sweet. See you next year, Shake Shack!

With 2750 reviews already in the bank, I doubt that mine is going to sway the masses. That said, I went there last weekend with my wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandson. The weather was great (actually a little hot) and the line was long but moved pretty quickly.

The burgers are a little small but insanely delicious. The fries were crisp and hot but nothing special. We had the Shroom Burger, Shackburger and the Smoke Shack. Definitely worth a return visit.

So what is the very first thing I want when I am in NYC???  I want a ShackStack in and around my mouth. This place is all sorts of wonderful.  This location is in beautiful Madison Square Park, and the lines here are absurd.  They opened at 11am and we got there around 11:20am and the line was already long, but nothing was going to stop me from my mission.

I got the ShackStack, and I consider this one of the best burgers I ever had...and this is from a franchise restaurant!?  I know its sounds ridiculous, but the combo of the Shroom Burger and the Cheeseburger is insanely delicious!!  I topped it off with a tasty chocolate shake and we shared a chocolate frozen custard.  It was sensory overload son!

This place needs to migrate and open a location in Chicago.  The closest location to us here is the one in Philly.  One day I might be crazy enough to just hop in my car and drive over there just for a damn burger.  Its that good people, and that is the TRUTH!!!

Visited New York about 3 years ago, and we were told that the Shake Shack is a must when visiting New York, so we headed down there on a cold winter&apos;s afternoon, it was about -6 and the Shack wasn&apos;t very busy, so i ordered a cheeseburger and crinkle fries, and after my first bite i was in greasy melting burger heaven, i have never tasted a burger like this before, the flavour of the patty was great, and the gooey cheese gave it that lovely greasy texture, pure brilliance and remains to this day the best burger i have ever had, the choc milkshake also ranks in my top 3 of all time, i will always have fond memories of New York, and the Shake Shake is one of the reasons why.

Quick! Get to Madison Square Park before Comandante Bloomberg criminalizes the deep fryer!!!

So the posted pictures aren&apos;t very helpful. Imagine a sandwich sized brown paper bag. Two thirds of the bag are soaked through with grease. You have to carry it from underneath lest the bottom fall out. You are running east to get to your apartment because the hot oil is burning your carrying hand. With your other hand, you are stuffing cheese-slathered fries down your gullet. You&apos;re there! Unfortunately, you have to dry one of your hands down the front of your shirt to avoid ruining your new slacks while reaching for your keys. Do you wipe the cheese-covered hand relegating your shirt to bro-cations and mom&apos;s house? Or do you attempt switching the bag to the other hand at the risk of dropping your dinner all over the sidewalk?

This is the type of moral dilemma that one runs the risk of encountering after a visit to the Shake Shack. However, this Morton&apos;s Fork is not the fork you&apos;ll need to tackle SS. The shakes are thick. There&apos;s soft serve out there that isn&apos;t as dense. The Shroom Burger is what you would get if a stuffed mushroom and a Wisconsin mozzarella stick procreated on a bed of hot beef. Round out your meal with cheese fries if you haven&apos;t had enough dairy already.

The tables are always filled, get it to go; the lines are ridiculous, but it&apos;s worth the wait.

preparation//
go early! as in before you&apos;re hungry because there IS ALWAYS a line....4 am or pm

*note* there is an express lane for pre-selected options...or check the 24hr camera to see the wait

ambiance//****
always fun to eat and play at the park...hangout under the benches w/ umbrellas that are reminiscent of a theme park

food//***
the most distinguishing thing about their burger is the BUTTERY buns! ;p however the size leans toward the smaller gourmet portion...so i need two

fries&amp;cookies are pretty standard all-american yummyness

shakes are FILLING...they use real ice cream...and reminds me of hand dipped shakes

~*~

this is a must-visit for the original
*think* johnny rocket&apos;s, but a little less franchised...white castle, but less greasy

yet *hands down* i&apos;m still an in-n-out #1 double double combo girl ;p

Am I allowed to review this place even though I&apos;m not from New York? When my friends and I first got to the famous Shake Shack location, I was really tempted to suggest to eat somewhere else because the line was ridiculously long. The humidity was doing nothing for my hair, and my feet were hurting from touring all day. But of course my friends who are residents of New York insisted that I try this place since I was only visiting for a short while. Also, I secretly really wanted to try this place after seeing Ginnifer Goodwin and John Krasinski have their enlightening conversations here in &apos;Something Borrowed&apos;.

After waiting for about half an hour and starving, I was rather alarmed at how small the burgers were when I picked them up from the window -- I mean, my burger was gone after about 10 bites. Maybe I was just famished from walking all over New York, but the burger was gone rather quickly. Aside from the fact that it was too small for my taste (next time I&apos;ll order 2), the burger was quite juicy and flavorful, and I really enjoyed the ambiance of Madison Square Park. Also, we got lucky as there was a live band that provided good music and entertainment as we ate our kids meal-sized burgers.

As a born and bred Californian, In-N-Out takes cake or should I say, cheeseburger, when it comes to delicious burgers. But I am glad to say that at least I&apos;ve tried Shake Shack during my visit to New York, and I did get cute pictures of the place. Instagram!

I waited in the crazy long line so obviously had high expectations. It&apos;s NYC&apos;s answer to Cali&apos;s in n out. I still prefer in n out but shake shack was a treat on a hot summer day. I tried the Smoke shack which had a delicious chopped cherry pepper with their shake shack sauce. The quality of meat seemed better than in n out and the vanilla shake was to die for. Fries were ok. Definitely try a shake if you come here. I love the outer seating and very organized system. Once you get past the long line your food is out pretty fast. I will def be back to try another shake but not sure if it&apos;s worth the crazy long line.

We waited for the line to die down a bit on the Shack Cam and went to get a burger around 10pm. I&apos;d say by the time we waited in line to order, then waited for the food, we waited almost an hour. I ordered the ShakeBurger and a strawberry shake and my bf ordered the SmokeShack with bacon and, I think, cherry peppers. The burgers were cooked to a perfect medium and were super juicy. I think I read another review saying the individual pieces weren&apos;t the best ever, but the combo of the ingredients made a really good burger - I agree. My only complaints were that the single was a bit small if it&apos;s going to be your whole meal and I wasn&apos;t a fan of the special sauce. The milkshake, however, was AMAZING. Has to be the best shake I&apos;ve ever had. I would drink one of those every day for the rest of my life. Thank god I don&apos;t leave near the Shake Shake!

Just the fact that there&apos;s a Shake Shack Cam = awesome

I was in town for the first time ever and my friend kept raving about Shake Shack. We also went to another location (which I don&apos;t remember) and both times there was a wait but it&apos;s not too long. Totally worth it! The shakes are soooo rich (maybe a bit too much for me, but perfect for a hot day!) and the burgers and fries are yumm-o. I had the Shackburger. The staff are super nice and fast. And I love this location! So cute on a sunny summer evening. Although the birds and squirrels are NOT shy about their love for Shake Shack either...

OMG I can&apos;t believe i haven&apos;t written a review praising Shake Shack!! :D

I can recall the first time I had this delectable burger and amazing fries for the first time. It&apos;s the same feeling I get EVERY TIME i go to shake shack, I get all happy and giddy and jump up and down because we&apos;re going to shake shack! SHAKEEEE SHACKKKK!!! YAYYYY! :D

But sadly I don&apos;t go often because I obviously have work, and the lines are just too long for me to get a quick lunch. But if I happen to find time, which I recommend everyone who hasn&apos;t tried it to get on line no matter how long it is, then yes I will forego the long line, and get me some burger and fries. Seating looks packed at the park, but I haven&apos;t had a problem finding a seat. They also have heat lamps in the winter for those who can&apos;t go a season without them haha.

Gosh I can remember coming here for lunch with my coworker during a rainy day, thinking the line won&apos;t be bad, but it was still quite long! Whatever, soaked or not, I still got my shake shack! :P It&apos;s just THAT good.

What&apos;d Andrew Zimmern say about restaurants with the longest lines? Oh yeah, you GOTTA go. We arrived at Shake Shack around 3:00pm on Wednesday and the line was about 20...that right TWENTY people long. I finally placed my order around 3:25pm and the food arrived about fifteen minutes later.

I&apos;m starting to warm up to their burgers...it&apos;s not quite Pearl&apos;s Deluxe (cough shameless plug /cough)  but it definitely hit the spot. Their (cheese) fries aren&apos;t anything to write home about (seems like plain ol&apos; Ida Ore&apos;s to me).
If you have a sweet tooth then definitely pick up one of the concrete desserts. We ended up sharing a Shack Attack and it was deeeee-licious.

It&apos;s a great location right smack dab in the middle of Madison Square Park. Nice outdoor (only) seating which gives you also get a great view of the famous Flatiron Building across the street. I&apos;m a fan...now if they&apos;d only open a Shake Shack in the Bay Area.

It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve had red meat, but from what I remember, it blew all the other &quot;semi-fast food&quot; burger joints out of the water.

Next time I&apos;m in the city, I&apos;ll have to try the &apos;shroom burger.

Don&apos;t be discuraged by that anaconda of a line!  it&apos;s totally worth the wait!

ShackBurger
- SO JUICY and greasy, and o-so-good...it makes In-N-Out taste like health food

Cheese Fries
- Perfectly cooked fries...and the cheese tastes just like they placed a Kraft&apos;s Singles and microwaved it right on there!  sounds nasty? sure!  but it was SO yummy

Fair Shake
- Vanilla/Coffee shake - super strong and super sweet, perfect caffeine and sugar booster

Everything I tried was totally awesome and i would come here again

This burger was not the best I&apos;ve ever had.  Not even close really.  But Shake Shack gets 5 stars just for being in Madison Square Park.  What a treat it is to dine alfresco in this amazing setting.  The beautiful trees.  The lush grass.  The breathtaking architecture that encompasses the park and the seating area.  You just can&apos;t beat it.  Never mind that the burger is good, but not amazing and that the cheese fries are just comparable to Nathan&apos;s.

There&apos;s a reason that the line is often a 30 minute wait or more.  I ate at 2pm here on a Sunday afternoon, walked around and passed by again at 4pm and the line was even longer.  So just be prepared to wait a while if you plan to eat here.

I ordered the Shake Shack single burger and it was very juicy and delicious. Its not the best burger I ever had but pretty darn good.

However, I give this place three stars because its not worth the long wait. I waited in line for about 40 minutes until I got to the cash register and another 15 for the actual order.

Again I only ordered a burger. Not good.

Stand on the B Line, get the custard in a relatively short amount of time and eat and be happy. Be a sucker, stand on the A line with the tired, hungry masses, wait forever for medicre food that you won&apos;t mind eating because you will be so famished

first big tip---Simon Sez...stand on the B line.

Tip: I love anything chocolate. The chocolate custard ice cream here is supposedly made with Valrohna. if so,they must use a  miniscule amount. Get the VANILLA custard, no other flavor, and you will be very very happy, chocolate lovers!

2nd tip; if you get a pint, for some strange reason you don&apos;t get a full pint. What&apos;s up with that??? If you are a stickler, get your pints of ice cream some where else(Like Sundaes and Cones, which does not sell custard ice cream but has amazing stuff) Apparently servers here don&apos;t know what a pint of ice cream means unless management has instructed servers to rip people off.

1/5 Stars for the squirrel that chose to join us for dinner. Scared my girlfriend.

5/5 Stars for the Shake Shack box that I pushed the squirrel off my table with.

The burgers are ok. They dont really rock my socks off. I mean they are flavorful but more on the salty side.

I thought Cheese fries meant french fries, cheese, onions and maybe some sauce, but instead I got oily fries with a side of nacho cheese. not the business. :\

The line was really long but it went by fast. Getting the food however took a lot longer than the line but at least you know that your burger is made to order and not sitting out.

Their shakes are amazing, but super expensive!

Can easily spend $10 for a meal here.

My wife and I came here for dinner on the first night we arrived in NYC after what was close to a 24 hour flight from Australia. Admittedly i would have eaten anything but after reading and hear so much about Shack Shack I had to make it my first NYC food experience.

I wasn&apos;t disappointed.

I ordered a double shack burger with onion and I couldn&apos;t fault it. The meat was crisp and charred on the outside and pink and juicy in the middle.

Washed down with a Shack meister ale and i was in burger heaven.

The fries weren&apos;t the best but they were good enough.

The free wifi in madison square park was great. after 24 hours with no facebook i was getting a bit edgy

We returned  for dinner again at about 9pm on a Friday night to see a MASSIVE line. I had read reviews and heard about the line and I thought everyone was being a bit over the top, but it gets long and it suxs. We were told it was about 50 minutes wait. We had tickets to a UCB show at 10pm so we jumped on the subway up to the 8th ave Shake Shack which had a much shorter line.

All in all it was an awesome burger. I still think about shake shack (and In-n-out) most days and burgers back in Australia just don&apos;t seem to cut it anymore.

Oh, Shake Shack, I would have you everyday if my waistline allowed. I love this location because you get to sit in pretty Mad Sq Park and consume your yummy food without too many pigeons flying around. So in my opinion Shake Shack is the In n Out of the East Coast...yeah, I went there. I think Shake Shack is a tad bit greasier for better or for worse, but they&apos;re equally as delicious. Also, Shake Shack cheese fries are out of this world!!

Don&apos;t be discouraged by the line - all great things are worth the wait.  ;)

Being a californian... this burger is nearly as good as our pride and joy In n Out. We thought we were having regular burgers in Time Square but did a double take by ordering extra (they were so juicy and good). The only thing I wasn&apos;t really a huge fan of was the fries- you can do without it. Just have an extra burger ;)

Why I rate it a 5 is because it&apos;s not readily available for me and I actually crave it again sometimes- we were in Miami and was sooo bummed that we passed by it and it was closed (we were leaving early the next day). But if I had it regularly- it&apos;s pretty much a descent 4/5. I can&apos;t wait to go back to NYC and have a taste again! The strawberry shake was also delicious!

Edit: Make sure to order an extra burger if you&apos;re hungry they&apos;re kind of small- especially if the lines are long!

The Shroom Burger is really just a fried hunk of cheese. You can&apos;t taste the mushroom, and there&apos;s only a tiny sliver of portabella in there. We split the Shack Attack, and I felt sick from all the cheese. I&apos;d skip on the Shroom burger part next time for sure, but it just looked too good in the Yelp pics to pass up on! The fries aren&apos;t too oily, and the seating area is beautiful. By the way, there&apos;s already a 15-20 m wait if you get there when it opens.

Today I finally tried the famous Shake Shack. Ordered the Double Shack burger with cheese fries and strawberry shake.
I was very curious about what I was to expect from the burgers. There were nothing but great comments about this place from my friends. Though skeptical, I agreed to try it out, and boy did I not regret it at all.

The cheese fries were crispy and DELICIOUS.
Shake was thick, actually tasted like strawberries and were DELICIOUS.
Burgers...were juicy and DELICIOUS. It&apos;s wrapped with potato bread..and you can never go wrong with potato bread....NEVER.

The only thing I did not like was the line. It stretches pretty far and after you order, there&apos;s a small line on the side to pick up your order. It&apos;s a line within a line. Shakeception.

It&apos;s worth the wait though.
If you like tiny little birds and friendly squirrels running around you while you eat, this is also a great spot.

Really juicy, well seasoned burger. Down side, the lines are fucking long as hell. Better drag a partner with you or else you&apos;ll be waiting for a long time before getting that burger. The shakes are good time.

I&apos;m from California, and I have to say that this burger is better than In N Out if you take price and size out of the equation. Shake Shack is delicious, with higher quality ingredients, but  the amount of fat and grease can definitely weigh you down afterwards. Don&apos;t forget to ask for extra pickles and GRILLED onions when you order! As the original location, this place has tourist value. However, the line can become tremendously long, which is a bummer. Use their live web cam to check line length before venturing out!

Also, if you enjoy tarter, less sweet Arnold Palmers (half lemonade, half iced tea), you should try the one here!

History
 
 Established in 2004 

Shake Shack is a modern day&quot;roadside burger stand&quot;serving the most delicious burgers, hot dogs, frozen custard, beer and wine. Shake Shack was born from a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park (MSP) created by Union Square Hospitality Group to support the Madison Square Park Conservancy&apos;s first art installation&quot;I Taxi.&quot;The cart was a success and lines formed daily, so it re-opened for an additional two summers in 2002 and 2003. In July 2004, Shake Shack officially opened. Shake Shack instantly became a beloved NYC institution with a cult following, and for years guests asked us when a Shack would open in their neighborhood.In October 2008, a second Shake Shack opened on the Upper West Side (UWS) of Manhattan. In April 2009, Shake Shack debuted its third location at Citi Field. Shack&apos;s mission is to preserve the culinary traditions of classic American burger stands. Using the freshest high quality ingredients, all the food at Shake Shack is cooked to order.
