Fast Food Restaurant&apos;s Dividend Tastier Than Treasury Notes
 0 comments, 0 called-out + Comment now + Comment now 
 Investors worried about the recent market volatility and heightened risk of another recession don’t need to flee equities altogether. McDonald’s ( MCD – Analyst Report ) provides safety amid the market storm and offers investors plenty of growth opportunities.
 
It also pays a dividend that yields a stellar 2.7%, about 50 basis points above the yield on a 10-year Treasury note.

Earnings estimates have risen steadily for the world’s largest restaurant chain and should continue to rise even if another recession is right around the corner. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.

 Strong July Sales 

Same-store sales continue to rise for McDonald’s as cash-strapped consumers shop for value. In July, global same-store sales rose a stellar 5.1%.

Same-store sales were strong across all geographies too. The U.S. saw a 4.4% increase, driven by popularity of McCafébeverages and core products like Chicken McNuggets and its breakfast line-up. Europe was up 5.3%, led by growth in the U.K., Russia and Germany. The Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa market rose 4.0%, led by performance in China. Overall systemwide sales were up 14%, or 7% excluding currency effects. 

 Second Quarter Results 

McDonald’s also delivered better-than-expected second quarter results on July 22. Total sales were up 16% to $6.905 billion, driven by global same-store sales growth of 5.6%. This came in well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.648 billion. Excluding foreign currency translation, sales were up 8%.

Operating income rose 19% year-over-year as MCD leveraged its selling, general and administrative expenses. Earnings per share came in at $1.35, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. It was a 19% increase over the same quarter in 2010.

 More Growth Ahead 

If there is another recession right around the corner, don’t expect it to drag down McDonald’s earnings. If you take a look at its 5-year price&amp;consensus chart, consensus estimates actually rose throughout the Great Recession, and they have been rising over the last several months as well:
