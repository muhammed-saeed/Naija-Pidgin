Healthy Fast Food Recipes - How to Cook Them

 By Paul Bchara 
 
Love fast food but hate the calories? Here&apos;s an option that gives you the best of both worlds: cook your favorite fast food recipes at home and reduce the fat content in the process! Fast food restaurants often cook with the most fattening and salty ingredients possible to get people hooked. Fortunately, you can cook many of these menu items at home and reduce the salt and fat without reducing the flavor. Here are a few tips on how to do it.

First, instead of deep frying, fry your food in a healthy oil, like olive oil. You can also use a reduced fat oil to further decrease the calories. This will allow you to get that deep fried taste without all the harmful fats that most fast food recipes use. Simply pour a small amount into a skillet and fry it up.

Next, reduce the salt. A high salt intake causes high blood pressure and a variety of other health problems. Reduce the salt in the recipe to help reduce this problem. You won&apos;t even notice the difference. Also watch out for other seasonings high in salt.

Reduce high calories condiments. You can majorly lower the calorie content of your meal by reducing high fat condiments like mayonnaise, ranch, and sour cream. Instead, use a low-fat alternative, or just reduce the amount. You&apos;ll still get the great flavor, but you&apos;ll cut the calories nearly in half!

But how do I cook fast food recipes and dishes at home? It&apos;s surprisingly easy to cook most popular menu items at home. Many of them can be made with common household ingredients. All you need is a cookbook of replica recipes and a little practice and you can be cooking healthy fast food dishes in no time! Give it a try, you can save time, money, and calories!
