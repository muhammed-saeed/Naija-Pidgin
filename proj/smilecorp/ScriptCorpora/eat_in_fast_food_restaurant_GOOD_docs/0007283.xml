 and They
Will Care About Your Business 
 
  Does it seem like 
 we sacrifice customer service when we go to a fast food restaurant? Because its fast food and the servers arent actually serving us, is 
 it ok for them to avoid eye contact, act like they would rather be 
 somewhere else and even treat customers rudely? Maybe if that food was free , Id accept that. But it isnt free; its only supposed to be 
 fast. 

  Recently, I 
 stopped into a fast food, small chain restaurant. They are known for 
 their good, quality food. I walked in and dutifully picked up a menu to 
 peruse before stepping up to the counter. When I was ready, I stepped up 
 to the counter and waited for the unhappy cashier/order taker to finish 
 the task she was doing. When she approached, I said, Hi, as I am wont 
 to do, to which she replied, barely above a whisper, For here or to go? It was then that I saw the sign above her head and, indeed, well above 
 where most peoples eye levels are, unless you happen to be 106 tall, 
 that read: 

   Please 
 inform the cashier Here or To Go
before placing your order. 

  Oops! My 
 mistake! The sign didnt tell me I should not say hello or be nice. It 
 said merely to make the cashiers job as easy as possible. Ok, they gave 
 me the rules and I didnt see them. Ill own that one, I said to myself. 

  But I did have a 
 question about how the menu works. I had a total of three questions, to 
 which all were responded with barely audible grunts, indicating yes or 
 no. 

  When my food was 
 ready, another young lady, who also didnt look happy to be there, put my 
 food into a bag and stepped out away from the counter and looked at the 
 three of us who had stopped in for take out. Again, barely audible, I 
 could hear something that sounded vaguely familiar, like maybe I had 
 ordered what she mumbled. She confirmed with a nod that yes, this was my 
 food. I went to her because she seemed unable to step out of the area 
 assigned to her. I reached for my food and she pushed it into my body and 
 immediately turned away, no thank you or anything! I got the feeling 
 she wanted me gone as quickly as possible. I was and I dont think Ill 
 be back any time soon. 

  Conversely, I 
 have had wonderful experiences in fast food establishments. Last summer, 
 we were coming home from a camping trip and just wanted to get some food 
 fast and hit the road. We stopped at a famous fast food chain restaurant 
 in mid morning. It was the time of morning when they had stopped serving 
 breakfast and were moving into the lunch menu. I really wanted breakfast 
 items and I thought, what the heck, Ill ask! I was pleasantly surprised 
 when the manager on duty said, We have some breakfast still available, 
 what did you have in mind? I told her and she made it clear that it was 
 no problem and she was glad to do it! She made eye contact even though 
 she was busy preparing for the lunch rush and she made us feel welcome for 
 coming in and asking about breakfast. It didnt seem to be a huge 
 inconvenience. Even if they had been out of breakfast, her attitude would 
 have made us order something anyway. 

  I know that 
 working in restaurants can be grueling and sometimes thankless. I know 
 that the fast food industry has its own, unique style of burn-out among 
 servers. But when it turns into blatant rudeness, most of us dont feel 
 compelled to go back for more, no matter how good the food. 

  What is the 
 solution? Its not always possible, nor is it the best answer, to 
 immediately get rid of an employee. I think most people are worth some 
 research. 

  I suggest 
 employee incentives that will make people happy to be working. Give them 
 something to look forward to, like cash incentives, bonuses or gift 
 certificates for outstanding customer service. How will you know if they 
 give outstanding customer service? Watch and listen. If someone comes 
 into work with a bad attitude before they even get on the floor, you can 
 be sure that isnt going to change just because he/she is working with the 
 public. In fact, that almost ensures that the attitude will get worse! Find out whats going on and do a quick pep talk. 

  Value your 
 people. Build them up and make them feel valued and part of the team. I 
 dont believe that the two rude employees I encountered intended to be 
 rude. I believe they just didnt know how their actions were 
 interpreted. I feel strongly that no one has ever taken the time to share 
 customer service skills with them. No one has ever properly trained them 
 and many other hourly employees who work in the fast food industry. 

  The fast food 
 industry is huge and its growing. We should be focusing on improving the 
 quality of service and the quality of the environment in which these 
 people work. Training them properly makes them feel valuable and makes 
 them realize the importance of their jobs. All this, in turn, can 
 translate into greater customer care if you encourage it do so.

 Excellence is an act won by training and 
 habituation.
We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence,
but rather we have those because we have acted rightly.
We are what we repeatedly do.
Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.
