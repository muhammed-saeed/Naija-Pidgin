 T HOW THE GREAT RECESSION WAS BROUGHT TO AN END 1 How the Great Recession Was Brought to an End BY ALAN S. BLINDER AND MARK ZANDI 1 
he U.S. government’s response to the nancial crisis and ensuing Great Recession included some
o the most aggressive scal and monetary policies in history. The response was multiaceted and
bipartisan, involving the Federal Reserve, Congress, and two administrations. Yet almost every one
o these policy initiatives remain controversial to this day, with critics calling them misguided, ineective
or both. The debate over these policies is crucial because, with the economy still weak, more government
support may be needed, as seen recently in both the extension o unemployment benets and the Fed’s

 consideration o urther easing. 
In this paper, we use the Moody’s Analytics model o the U.S. economy—adjusted to accommodate some
recent nancial-market policies—to simulate the macroeconomic eects o the government’s total policy
response. We nd that its eects on real GDP, jobs, and infation are huge, and probably averted what could
have been called Great Depression 2.0. For example, we estimate that, without the government’s response,
GDP in 2010 would be about 11.5% lower, payroll employment would be less by some 8½ million jobs, and
the nation would now be experiencing defation.


When we divide these eects into two components—one attributable to the scal stimulus and the other at-
tributable to nancial-market policies such as the TARP, the bank stress tests and the Fed’s quantitative eas-
ing—we estimate that the latter was substantially more powerul than the ormer. Nonetheless, the eects
o the scal stimulus alone appear very substantial, raising 2010 real GDP by about 3.4%, holding the unem-
ployment rate about 1½ percentage points lower, and adding almost 2.7 million jobs to U.S. payrolls. These
estimates o the scal impact are broadly consistent with those made by the CBO and the Obama administra-
tion. 2 To our knowledge, however, our comprehensive estimates o the eects o the nancial-market policies
are the rst o their kind. 3 We welcome other eorts to estimate these eects.

 HOW THE GREAT RECESSION WAS BROUGHT TO AN END 2 
The U.S. economy has made enormous
progress since the dark days o early 2009.
Eighteen months ago, the global nancial
system was on the brink o collapse and the
U.S. was suering its worst economic down-
turn since the 1930s. Real GDP was alling
at about a 6% annual rate, and monthly job
losses averaged close to 750,000. Today,
the nancial system is operating much more
normally, real GDP is advancing at a nearly
3% pace, and job growth has resumed, albeit
at an insucient pace.


From the perspective o early 2009, this
rapid snap back was a surprise. Maybe the
country and the world were just lucky. But we
take another view: The Great Recession gave
way to recovery as quickly as it did largely
because o the unprecedented responses by
monetary and scal policymakers.


A stunning range o initiatives was un-
dertaken by the Federal Reserve, the Bush
and Obama administrations, and Congress
(see Table 1). While the eectiveness o any
individual element certainly can be debated,
there is little doubt that in total, the policy
response was highly eective. I policymak-
ers had not reacted as aggressively or as
quickly as they did, the nancial system
might still be unsettled, the economy might
still be shrinking, and the costs to U.S. tax-
payers would have been vastly greater.


Broadly speaking, the government set
out to accomplish two goals: to stabilize
the sickly nancial system and to mitigate
the burgeoning recession, ultimately re-


starting economic growth. The rst task
was made necessary by the nancial crisis,
which struck in the summer o 2007 and
spiraled into a nancial panic in the all o
2008. Ater the Lehman Brothers bank-
ruptcy, liquidity evaporated, credit spreads
ballooned, stock prices ell sharply, and a
string o major nancial institutions ailed.
The second task was made necessary by the
devastating eects o the nancial crisis on
the real economy, which began to contract
at an alarming rate ater Lehman.


The Federal Reserve took a number o ex-
traordinary steps to quell the nancial panic.
In late 2007, it established the rst o what
would eventually become an alphabet soup o
new credit acilities designed to provide liquid-


ity to nancial institutions and markets. 4 The
Fed aggressively lowered interest rates during
2008, adopting a zero-interest-rate policy by
year’s end. It engaged in massive quantitative
easing in 2009 and early 2010, purchasing
Treasury bonds and Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to
bring down long-term interest rates.


The FDIC also worked to stem the nan-
cial turmoil by increasing deposit insurance
limits and guaranteeing bank debt. Congress
established the Troubled Asset Relie Pro-
gram (TARP) in October 2008, part o which
was used by the Treasury to inject much-
needed capital into the nation’s banks. The
Treasury and Federal Reserve ordered the 19
largest bank holding companies to conduct
comprehensive stress tests in the spring o
2009, to determine i they had sucient
capital to withstand urther adverse circum-
stances—and to raise more capital i neces-
sary. Once the results were made public, the
stress tests and subsequent capital raising
restored condence in the banking system.


The eort to end the recession and
jump-start the recovery was built around a
series o scal stimulus measures. Tax rebate
checks were mailed to lower- and middle-
income households in the spring o 2008;
the American Restoration and Recovery Act
(ARRA) was passed in early 2009; and sev-
eral smaller stimulus measures became law
in late 2009 and early 2010. 5 In all, close to
$1 trillion, roughly 7 percent o GDP, will be
spent on scal stimulus. The stimulus has
done what it was supposed to do: end the
Great Recession and spur recovery. We do
not believe it a coincidence that the turn-
around rom recession to recovery occurred
last summer, just as the ARRA was providing
its maximum economic benet.


Stemming the slide also involved rescuing
the nation’s housing and auto industries. The
housing bubble and bust were the proximate
causes o the nancial crisis, setting o a vi-
cious cycle o alling house prices and surging
oreclosures. Policymakers appear to have
broken this cycle with an array o eorts, in-
cluding the Fed’s actions to bring down mort-
gage rates, an increase in conorming loan
limits, a dramatic expansion o FHA lending, a
series o tax credits or homebuyers, and the

 use o TARP unds to mitigate oreclosures. While the housing market remains troubled, its steepest declines are in the past. 
The near collapse o the domestic auto
industry in late 2008 also threatened to
exacerbate the recession. GM and Chrysler
eventually went through bankruptcies, but
TARP unds were used to make the process
relatively orderly. GM is already on its way
to being a publicly traded company again.
Without nancial help rom the ederal
government, all three domestic vehicle pro-
ducers and many o their suppliers might
have had to liquidate many operations, with
devastating eects on the broader economy,
and especially on the Midwest.


Although the economic pain was severe
and the budgetary costs were great, this
sounds like a success story. 6 Yet nearly all
aspects o the government’s response have
been subjected to intense criticism. The Fed-
eral Reserve has been accused o overstepping
its mandate by conducting scal as well as
monetary policy. Critics have attacked eorts
to stem the decline in house prices as inap-
propriate; claimed that oreclosure mitigation
eorts were ineective; and argued that the
auto bailout was both unnecessary and unair.
Particularly heavy criticism has been aimed at
the TARP and the Recovery Act, both o which
have become deeply unpopular.


The Troubled Asset Relie Program was
controversial rom its inception. Both the
program’s $700 billion headline price tag and
its goal o “bailing out” nancial institutions—
including some o the same institutions that
triggered the panic in the rst place—were
hard or citizens and legislators to swallow. To
this day, many believe the TARP was a costly
ailure. In act, TARP has been a substantial
success, helping to restore stability to the
nancial system and to end the reeall in
housing and auto markets. Its ultimate cost to
taxpayers will be a small raction o the head-
line $700 billion gure: A number below $100
billion seems more likely to us, with the bank
bailout component probably turning a prot.


Criticism o the ARRA has also been stri-
dent, ocusing on the high price tag, the slow
speed o delivery, and the act that the un-
employment rate rose much higher than the
Administration predicted in January 2009.
