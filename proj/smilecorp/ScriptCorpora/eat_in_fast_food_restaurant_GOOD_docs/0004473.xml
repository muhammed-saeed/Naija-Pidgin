Meh.

My roomates and I stumbled upon this place on our quest for some late night grub.

Ordered chimichanga, carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito, fish tacos. First off..it is quite pricey at $9+ for a 2 taco combo plate (rice and beans).

Second of all the food is just medicore, I don&apos;t know how this place has a 4 star average.

#1 Fried fish for fish tacos was dripping in oil...ew.
#2 Salsa was the only thing that gave the chimichanga any flavor.
#3 Carne asada was dry, salty, and not even cooked to order.

-sigh-

2 Stars. Won&apos;t be back.

The layout -  Once you enter Adalberto&apos;s there are seats to the right, ordering counter on the left, and chips and salsa bar right next to the door. That late night college burrito joint may pop in your head. Clean but not sterile environment clean. Improvements to the building and inside but not new by any means. A welcomed sight.

Hits:
- Late Night. Your standard drive in super late spot when you got that craving or perhaps you just got back in late. Either case this place stays open late.
- Like most Mexican joints in San Diego, the prices are more than respectable. Like most Mexican places however, go for the burrito in sheer terms of having a filling meal. Combinations are ok, but you can stretch out the money more if you dont need variety.
- Chips and salsa bar. Grab a snack while you wait or start loading up on those carrots and peppers.
- Fast service. Perfect for a lunch break without having to call in.

Misses:
- Standard fare. Nothing too new or exciting. Nothing really pops out at you though. There is a certain familiarity with joints like this. Not that its counted against it or anything.
- Daredevils may be searching somewhere else for salsa packing a little heat (though the salsa verde has a nice flavor to it). No exciting chipotle salsa, roasted pepper, etc. Just regular ass salsa. But thats part of the charm i suppose.

You Should Try:
- Srriacha with everything. Im one of those, but seriously, i feel like mexican food and that wonderful dried chile sauce were made for each other.
- 5 rolled tacos with everything is cheap and quick, also tastes great.

Cheap, fast, and greasy.  You get what you pay for, but overall this was not what I had hoped for.

If you are in San Diego, you must eat carne asada fries and a California burrito.  This place does both of those pretty good, but they were not great representations of what this city is known for (or at least, what all the twenty-something kids are raving about) as it is basically fast food.  The fries were kind of lacking in flavor, and the meat was greasy.  The guac was good but not great.. Not very flavorful overall, but nice medium of creamy and chunky, which I liked.

I guess if this place is near where you are, or if you are on a tight budget and just want a lot of junk food for a few bucks, this is a great place.  But if you want to savor your San Diego treats, look for something a little more homemade.

Standard Mexican fare for San Diego. California burrito was acceptable. Their salsa bar is respectable; the red sauce is spicy and more tomato based. The green sauces are ordinary. Nice that it is open pretty late.

I have been faithfully going to Adalberto&apos;s since 1988.  Great place, great food.  Best Carne Asada Burrito I have ever had, and I have had many.  My wife and son love it as well. I now live in Atlanta and when I visit San Diego, Adalberto&apos;s is my first stop.

Inexpensive, fast, and yummy.

Not the best Mexican I ever had but for the price, you can&apos;t beat it.

And the unlimited chips and salsa helped.

I had the Carne Asada burrito and it was delicious. I haven&apos;t been in San Diego in 6 years and there is not any food like this in Virginia that I have found. It is close to the hotel that I&apos;m staying at, Hilton hotel on Harbor Island. I will probably go one more time before I have to leave.

This place makes the BOMB carne asada burritos, mucho tastiness, even better than Santana&apos;s down the street!  Too bad it doesn&apos;t have a drive through... definitely one of my top 3 favorite spots for Mexican!

Just like any-erto... pero este restarante es muy sucio!

I like the salsa bar and cheap prices but this place needs a good cleaning. Dirty tables. Dirty floor. I had to clean off my own table and it kinda ruined my appetite to have to see the sauce drippings and pieces of carne asada left behind from previous patrons. It&apos;s like going to take a shit in a public restroom and seeing the previous person&apos;s streak marks in the toilet. It grossed me out.

I know this will sound high schoolish, but this place is the BOMB!

The best part, other than the food and that it is literally two blocks from my place, it opens late, really late. I think it opens until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. I&apos;ve frequent there many times on a Friday night or weekend between 11-12:00 at night and the place is packed with the people were drinking at the bar next door.

Mexican food to me is the same thing, just wrapped differently. So I tend to stick with my favorite, the Carne Asada chips (nachos). I only get the half size serving because it&apos;s HUGE. The chips, cheese, guacamole, and meat...mmm, mmm, GOOD!

Personally, I haven&apos;t had anything else but the carne asada chips, so this review may not be the best to rely on. Sorry. I&apos;m just thinking that if the carne asada chips are that good, the rest is probably the bomb too. I just haven&apos;t tried others because Mexican food is too heavy for me.

Fast! For burritos anyway - that&apos;s all I&apos;ve eaten here. You&apos;ll order and by the time you find a place to sit they&apos;ll be calling you back to the counter. However, there are down sides to ridiculously fast food, e.g., the ingredients seem less fresh. But, for the speed and the low price and the late hours, this place is definitely a frequent choice. Be careful with the chip stand, sometimes it seems a little sketch.

Holy crap their carne asada fries are so Dank. Got the large. it was fantastic.

Place was very clean when I went. But only two people were working so I could see how this place could require you to wipe down your own table if it&apos;s busy.

Parking is a pain. The lot in front is small but there was plenty of street parking.

Best California burrito in San Diego!

I hate to admit how many places I have tried the Cali burrito, or for that matter how many I have eaten...Adalberto&apos;s is just the best.  They are fast, fresh, and generous in portion size.

They have a salsa bar so grab some salsa sides on the way out!

One of the rare places that opens until 2AM down here.

Food is actually quite good.

Ordered Carneasada burrito and a torta with all the chips and salsa you can carry for $11.04.

Would definitely stop by again when in the area.

Known to me since forever as my sister&apos;s fave place for rolled tacos ever. Last week we decided to face the rapids of Rosecrans at lunchtime to get us a bite of mex.

Even though it&apos;s in Point Loma, it&apos;s got some street cred, someone ran their car right into not too long ago. Just choose your seat carefully.

Perfect place to continue indoctrinating the newly replanted BF from NM in what California style Mex is all about. And while we can&apos;t agree on what kind of chili sauce you is best on enchiladas we unanimously.... unabashedly.... LOVE... this place. That&apos;s right huey we&apos;re talking about full on love...gooey... cheesy... knock your guacs off goodness.

His: adobada burrito
Hers: five rolled tacos with EVERYTHING
Bonus: Decent salsa bar and complimentary chips.

But you ask is it authentic? For what Socal Cali-Mex is YES, YES, YES!

Verrrrry good! I went here looking for some delicious food...oh boy we found it! Get here EARLY this place gets packed quick. The food was great, we didn&apos;t eat the chips because we didn&apos;t want to fill up on those and ignore the food. The parking is horrible...trying to find a spot in this TINY shopping center is hard...esp. since a lot of people now have SUV&apos;s and other uncecessary large cars. All in all I will totally be coming back here!

There is a fallacy, a myth - if you will - on what women do when they are together partaking in &quot;Girl Time&quot;.

FANTASY:  A group of women lounging around in their see-thru nighties, taking turns applying makeup on one another, filing and painting their nails as they talk and giggle about cosmetics, marriage, babies, ideal hubbies, diamond rings, and clothing designers.  Then - making out with each other before falling asleep in one another&apos;s laps.

Sorry, men.  Not the case.  You know what REALLY goes down...?

REALITY: To start off the evening, we gorge ourselves on 2 HUGE orders of some kind of fatty, greasy, calorie-laden, oh-so-good junk like the Carne Asada Nachos from Adalberto&apos;s (OMG - THE BOMB though).  Then when we get home, we lounge about in our stretchy pants/sweats/oversized t-shirts, bellies all hanging out, hair tied up in buns, make-up off, going to town on a whole chocolate cake that we share (eating it directly from the box), drinking bottle after bottle of wine and champagne until we get drunk-obnoxious-loud and laughing big guffaw laughter, analyzing endlessly our men issues and quandries, and sharing celebrity gossip as a movie we&apos;re not watching is playing in the background.

Sorry to burst your bubble boys.  Ya had to learn some time.

I decided to venture away from favourite taco shop in Point Loma, Ortiz&apos;s, and try somewhere else. So off down the hill I trotted to Adalberto&apos;s. I was not disappointed when I ordered my standard Cali Burrito. they&apos;ve got everything right about it. The all important price factor was especially pleasing also.
It gains major plus points for free chips and a great selection of salsa I&apos;m a big believer that you can judge a food place on the quality of their condiments and Adalberto&apos;s passes the test with flying colours (Yes, this is how you spell &apos;colour&apos;).

SORRY ADALBERTOS I&apos;VE HAD BETTER

I don&apos;t know why this place doesn&apos;t just do it for me. I came here last night with fellow yelper Marisol and Vanessa and her BFF Aimee. It wasn&apos;t that far of a drive after our yelp kickball game.

Kudos for free stale chips would be better if they had salsa to come with it. I ordered the California Burrito. Shout out to Marisol thanks buddy you&apos;re the best! The California burrito was...how can I say this?! Okay. The beef wasn&apos;t very tastful as I imagined it to be or maybe I just love Lolitas because they do make it perfect the way I like it.

But I&apos;ll scoop you in on some info: They provide late night service for you inebriated special ones that need to devour some food to sober you up and they take credit card. 3 stars. Peace Yelp Heads!

**We interrupt this review for a special public service announcement.

With an increase of miscommunication at local taco shops, the following information may very well protect you from anguish, confusion and disappointment. Some people are unaware of the golden rule when placing an order at a Mexican food establishment. When ordering, don&apos;t jump around with the details of your order. An order that resembles the following will more than likely end up wrong:

&quot;I&apos;ll take a carne asada taco
1 California burrito
A Bean and cheese burrito with rice
And the California burrito with guacamole&quot;

You notice how that last item is actually a reference to the second item? This is not recommended! A woman who recently placed an order at Adalberto&apos;s in Point Loma used this similar format. While she only wanted THREE items, as a result of her method of ordering, she was given FOUR. Witnessing this strategy in person may cause you to run towards the individual in slow motion screaming, &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; Almost.

In conclusion, stay put on each item until you&apos;ve explained all of the details. Then, move on to the next one and repeat. This way, you won&apos;t leave yourself susceptible to boogers, snot rockets and clumps of hair when you anger the staff by implying that they are morons. Always apologize profusely when THEY make a mistake (the first time around, that is) and claim that retardation runs rampant in your family. If you follow these simple suggestions, your next taco shop visit will hopefully be a pleasant one.

We now return you to your regularly schedule Yelp review.**

Ok, so I&apos;ve tried Adalberto&apos;s Bacon breakfast burrito ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ) and it wasn&apos;t bad. So, I decided that it was time to move on to bigger and hopefully better things - the steak and egg burrito. As soon as I cut it in half to take pictures (steak and egg burrito # 2 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ), I knew that this wasn&apos;t going to be as good as the one that can be found at Dos Brasas ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ). After the first bite, I realized that I was right.

The steak lacked any real flavor and was a bit dry. Surprisingly, the eggs were NOT overcooked which really shocked me. They also went really light on the cheese which didn&apos;t make things any better. It wasn&apos;t terrible but it&apos;s definitely not worth my time or money to try again.

Adalberto&apos;s, that&apos;s the last 5 bucks you&apos;ll ever get from me (at least when it comes to your steak and egg burrito).

Their salsa nor chips aren&apos;t good.

California Burrito:  It is the burrito to die for!! It&apos;s French fries in it. Gosh, it&apos;s DAMN GOOD!!! Carne Asada is so yummy, and french fries and sour cream seal the deal. Soooooooooooo Gooooooood :D

A double fist sized fish taco for $2??? Oh hellz yeah.
&apos;Medium&apos; carne asada french fries that filled the 9x9 take-out container to the rim with fries, guac, sour cream, then COVERED in carne asada steak?
And rolled tacos - not your cheapy taquitos from Trader Joe&apos;s - GOOD strips of carnitas in a real fried flour tortilla, rolled, then once more COVERED w/lettuce, guac, sour cream and salsa?
Aldaberto&apos;s - it&apos;s a small corner of heaven.

San Diego - home to the Padres, the Chargers, Old Town, Sea World...and Carne Asada Fries.  On my latest trip down to the Dago, we drove for eight hours and arrived famished.  The first thing we did when the bellman brought our luggage up to our room?  Asked him where the nearest taco shop was.  (Taco shop is not the same thing as Taqueria, mmmkay?)

Our friendly bellman (Uncle Steve) gave us simple directions to Adalberto&apos;s (and anyone who knows San Diego knows that some of the best Mexican food is available from places ending with &quot;-erto&apos;s&quot;).  Looking over the glossy bright yellow menu on the wall, it was decided that we would share an order of carne asada fries....and of course, we had to add some rolled tacos in there too (you cannot resist)....topping it off with a nice glass (styrofoam to go cup) of Jamaica agua fresca (not Jah-may-kuh, like where Bob Marley is from, but Huh-my-kuh, like hibiscus flower).  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever scarfed Mexican food so fast.  It was delicioso y sabroso.

We didn&apos;t even break the $10 mark.

I LOVE YOU SAN DIEGO!!

FWEE CHIPS!

Unlimited deep fried corn tortilla pieces @ the salsa bar...for Free!

SCORE!

They get 2 stars for free chips and 2 more stars for offering half orders of carne asada fries. I like both Carne asada fries and carne asada chips..so I usually get their half order of CA fries&amp;take advantage of the free chips...It&apos;s like getting two meals for the price of one.

Before I begin, let me say that I have long stood beside Santana&apos;s in the brutal Santana&apos;s-Adal&apos;s War that has raged on Rosecrans for the better part of 20 years.  But let me offer four observations about Adal&apos;s that will never permit my conversion:

1.  The cashier once scooped water out of an open bucket for my cup of water.  Seriously, a bucket?  Next time, send me out back to drink from the hose.

2.  I am fairly certain the squeeze-bottle hot sauce foams when it comes into contact with Earth&apos;s atmosphere.  Origin: unknown!

3.  Not open 24/hours.  I am the kind of guy that absolutely needs my local taco shop to be open at 3:30am.  How many hungry people have been coldly turned away from Adalberto&apos;s late at night?  Too many, too many.  The sun never sets on the public&apos;s need for carne asada.

4.  Sour cream.  It doesn&apos;t belong in carne asada burritos.  It&apos;s guacamole, salsa, and nothing more.  Got it?

Went here last night after band practice, and the food was great.

I ordered fries with shredded chicken (Guacamole and sour cream etc.), which was a nice change from the obligatory Carne Asada fries. The chips were also quite tasty.

I&apos;d say this place is a safe bet for a good Mexican joint in Point Loma.

Easily the best carne asada burrito in greater San Diego.

In 1993 it cost $2.60 (tax included).  In 2001, it was $3.20.

Not bad.

I used to get one of these for breakfast 3 or 4 times a week when I worked across the street in glorious Pt. Loma.

Video games inside and very hot hot sauce. And you can do your laundry next door.

When my Mexican grandmother visited me in SD in 92 or so, she ordered extras to take home.

Go. Eat.

One of the best Mexican food places in the San Diego and probably the SoCal area!!! Ever!!!

You can differentiate between regular mexican food and the americanized mexican food, and this my friends is the real deal. Only my friend&apos;s parents can make better mexican food, but they live in Baldwin Park, which is a bit of a drive to get the some authentic mexican food.

Lots of combos to choose from. Today I had the #8, carne asada tacos con arroz y frijoles. For $8, they fill your plate to the max. Seriously, plenty of food for all around $10 with a drink.

The condiments bar includes free chips, verde y roja salsa, and jalepenos.

Located in Point Loma on Rosecrans blvd, the parking can be difficult to obtain, but there are side streets available for parking as well.

Overall...muy excellente!!!

Adalberto&apos;s, you are the reason why I&apos;m fat.

Honestly, &quot;awesome&quot; doesn&apos;t adequately describe their California burritos. In fact, no lexicographer could ever hope to invent a word that does the California burrito justice; it&apos;s just that good. Seriously, do yourself a favor and try one--you won&apos;t regret it.

To sweeten the deal, they&apos;ve got a salsa bar. Not exactly extensive, but the selections were good enough. They also have some chips that get replaced regularly for your dipping pleasure.

Their horchatas were okay; they seemed a little on the bland side. Still a good drink nonetheless.

Overall, if you&apos;ve got serious munchies, Adalberto&apos;s will undoubtedly satisfy your cravings.

These stars are mainly for Adalberto&apos;s hot sauce. You could tell from the nearly flourescent red color that it was going to be s-p-i-c-y, and yes it was! Just how I like it.

The burrito I got, bean and cheese, was literally just beans and cheese. I guess they are honest, but I&apos;m used to San Francisco-style burritos that are loaded with rice, lettuce, salsa, etc.

San Diego taquerias have the best tortillas, though, and Adalberto&apos;s delivered on that front. I think it was the overload of beans that made me not love the total package.

By far, the BEST Mexican fast food restaurant EVER!!!  I first discovered Adalberto&apos;s in 2004 and before I moved here made trips to San Diego just to eat here!  All the food on the menu is either the best I&apos;ve ever had or at least rivals it.  The service is simple, the food inexpensive, but the quality from a taste factor is par-none.  Sure it has it&apos;s own style and flavor, but outside of an actual restaurant or &quot;chain&quot; you won&apos;t find better food... and even then the food isn&apos;t &quot;better&quot;, just different (i.e. I love Chalupas but that&apos;s not quite &quot;Mexican food&quot;).

The one and only thing that sucks about this place is the parking lot, which is always crowded as it shares with 2 or 3 other businesses in a small plaza.  Then again, where is it was to park on Rosecrans anyways?

Try the California Burrito, you&apos;ll fall in love (and gain 4 pounds, but it&apos;s worth it).
