Going Green: Ways to eat green every meal of the day
 March 19, 2012 | By AMANDA WHEELER | amandawheelerphoto@live.com 
Last week, I looked at some basic ways to eat healthy and green at the same time. This week, I’ll share some more specific ideas for meals and snacks thoughout the day.

On any given day, you can make the decision to eat healthy for your body and the environment. These are just a few ideas:
 
 Breakfast 
Don’t go to a fast food restaurant. It is a fast fix, but it’s not a good way to start the day. Most of the time, the food you get from a fast food joint isn’t good for you. On top of that, you are creating lots of trash—everything is wrapped in paper or plastic, right down to the straws and forks.
Instead of hitting up the drive thru at McDonald’s, schedule a little extra time in the morning grab breakfast at home. Some great options include cereal with pieces of fresh fruit in it or scrambled eggs with toast, fruit and juice. Advertisement 
If you go for juice, check to make sure it’s 100-percent fruit juice and not something fruit flavored with only a little bit of actual juice. 
 Green Tip: If you want muffins for breakfast, instead of buying prepackaged muffins that come in plastic packaging and probably have preservatives in them, make your own muffins.
You can help the environment by investing in reusable silicon muffin cups. Then you can use the cups as often as you would like and you don’t have to throw away paper ones every time you eat a muffin.
If you are in a rush in the mornings, you can make the muffins the night before and reheat them in the morning for a quick breakfast. You can even make a big batch, store them in the freezer and then pop one in the microwave before you leave in the morning.
 
 Snacks 
When eating snacks, they shouldn’t be more than about 100 calories. Don’t worry—there are plenty of low-calorie snack options out there. If you happen to eat a snack with more than 100 calories, don’t stress out—it’s just a rule of thumb. One good snack option is popcorn, especially if it’s air-popped in a home popcorn machine so there are no paper bags to throw away when you’re done. There are fewer calories per serving than in regular microwave popcorn, too.
 Green Tip: Instead of buying snacks that are individually wrapped, buy things in bulk and prepare your own smaller snacks.
When you buy food in bulk, there’s a much higher food-to-packaging ratio, making your purchase better for the environment because there’s less waste going into the garbage can.
For example, instead of buying peanut butter crackers that are pre-packaged into packs of four or six, buy a big box of crackers and make your own peanut butter crackers, which you can take with you in reusable zipper sandwich bags.
If you do buy in bulk and make snacks, remember to maintain portion control. Remember to count your calories and decide how much you are going to eat, make only that much and then put the rest away.
 
 Lunch 
When you are in a rush in the morning, it’s hard enough to remember your breakfast and keys. Sometimes, the last thing you want to do is pack a lunch, too. That is why a lot of people grab fast food for lunch—it’s quick and easy. But it’s also not good for you. It’s best to avoid fast food for lunch, just like you shouldn’t eat it for breakfast. Even fast food salads are often surprisingly full on calories and empty on the kinds of veggies that actually count.
Another option some people use for lunch is bringing a frozen dinner from home. Unfortunately, frozen meals, like lots of pre-made foods, are often extremely high in sodium. Lunch is clearly a tough meal to make healthy, but one easy solution is to make something healthy for dinner, then pack the leftovers for lunch the next day.
Leftover pasta with healthy tomato sauce can be a great lunch starter. Toss in some easy-to-carry fruits and veggies like baby carrots and an apple and you’ve got a filling, balanced and healthy meal.
 Green Tip: Pack your lunches in reusable plastic containers, not disposable containers like sandwich bags. Not only do plastic containers keep things like grapes fresher and tastier, but by reusing them over and over, you prevent yourself from throwing away excess plastic and polluting the earth.
You can also bring something to drink in a reusable water bottle or thermos. Disposable plastic water bottles are actually horrible for the environment—it takes more water to manufacture the bottle than the bottle actually holds, and drinkable water is already available everywhere around us.
 
 Dinner 
After a long day, it’s tempting to grab fast food on the way home or order some pizza for dinner, but it’s important to resist those urges. Instead, make eating homemade dinner a regular habit. There are thousands and thousands of recipes on dozens of easy-to-use Web sites that take just a few minutes to make. You can also get slow-cooker recipes and let your dinner slow-cook all day while you’re at work so it’s ready for you as soon as you get home. And don’t forget to make extra, so you can pack it for next day’s lunch. If you’re making your dinner instead of pouring it out of a box, odds are it will be a whole lot healthier for you. Some basic ways to make sure you’re cooking healthy include using white meat instead of red meat, making sure vegetables are a substantial portion of the meal and making sure to include some carbohydrates like bread or pasta.
 Green Tip: If you cook more than one meal’s worth of meat at the same time, you can actually save energy, which is good for the environment. By cooking the meat all at once (and then refrigerating or freezing the unused portions) you avoid preheating the oven or stove multiple times and you can cook it all in less total time.
Another green idea for dinner is to join the“meatless Mondays”movement. Because it takes more resources to process meat than it does to grow crops, it’s good for the environment when we eat less meat. Many people are starting to have meatless dinners once a week in order to reduce their environmental impacts.
 
It’s difficult sometimes to change behaviors. It takes passion and will power to change your habits, hopefully though with these helpful hints and tricks it does make the idea of eating in a healthy and sustainable way seems like a less daunting task. Anything can become a habit, it just needs repetition and will power.
