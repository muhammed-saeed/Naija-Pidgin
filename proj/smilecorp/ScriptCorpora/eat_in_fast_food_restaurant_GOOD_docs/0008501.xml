Hi - since I printed out a bunch of past Donovan-related articles awhile back for personal use, I thought I&apos;d share some of them. I definitely won&apos;t be posting these all at once, though: I don&apos;t have these saved on my computer like the articles on his wife I posted in the other thread, so I&apos;ll be typing these out by hand. I&apos;ll try to fix my typos as I go along, but some typos I may still miss - sorry in advance. 

From the Chicago Tribune (January 2, 1999)

He always thinks ahead to the next play, the next down, the way things are shaping up and how he can help shape them. The tendency surfaced early, when Donovan McNabb was barely into his teens.

McNabb was a ballboy at the time, fetching towels and water for the basketball team at St. Francis de Sales High School, where his older brother Sean played. Not that it wasn&apos;t fun. But Donovan had some concerns and he is the analytical type.

One day he told his father they needed to talk.

&quot;He came to me and said he didn&apos;t want to grow up being Sean McNabb&apos;s younger brother,&quot;Sam McNabb recalled.&quot;I told him that if he worked hard and took care of business, that would take care of itself.

&quot;Little did I know that I would grow up to be Donovan McNabb&apos;s father.&quot;

Donovan McNabb&apos;s identity crisis indeed has been resolved. The 22-year-old Dolton native and former Mt. Carmel High School standout, who will play his last collegiate game Saturday night against Florida in the Orange Bowl, is simply the best quarterback in the history of Syracuse University.

He has several other identities as well: loving son and brother - he and Sean, 26, are in fact extremely close- avid churchgoer, constant cut-up.

McNabb strolled into the Orange Bowl on Thursday, shower sandals scuffing, a camcorder held up to his face and trained on the television crews. His laughter rambled up and down the musical scale like water tumbling across the keys of a xylophone. It is catching, as are his passes, all 8,389 yards&apos; worth of them.

&quot;He&apos;ll make you laugh so hard you have a headache,&quot;Syracuse offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers said.&quot;He is always in a good mood.&quot;

Exhibit A, offered by Rogers, came on a frighteningly bumpy team flight from Morgantown, W. Va. The players fell completely silent as the prop plane bucked and jerked in the strong wind. Then a mournful bass voice rumbled from the back of the cabin, a cross between Zero Mostel and Motown:&quot;May the Lord protect and defend you...&quot;

It was McNabb crooning&quot;Tevye&apos;s Blessing&quot;, a selection from&quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;that is a fixed part of the pregame chapel service that they Orangemen habitually attend. Needless to say, the rest of the flight went more smoothly.

&quot;He knew how to keep the kids loose at practice,&quot;said Mt. Carmel coach Frank Lenti, who, upon turning his back, sometimes fell victim to McNabb&apos;s gift for mimicry.

But the reinforcing steel of McNabb&apos;s humor is uncommon focus, loyalty and humility.

&quot;He is success-oriented, but not success-driven,&quot;said Bishop H. Daniel Wilson, McNabb&apos;s pastor at the New Christian Valley Full Gospel Baptist Church in South Holland and a close confidant.

&quot;The young people in our church just love him. You would think he would expect a seat in the front row, but he goes and sits in the balcony with them.&quot;

McNabb&apos;s high school friend and teammate Reggie Thompson, a senior strong safety at Western Michigan, said he values McNabb as much off the field as he does for their continuing tradition of summer workouts.

When Thompson became a father last year, it was McNabb who advised him about how to balance personal and career issues.

&quot;If you ever need me, I&apos;ll be there for you,&quot;McNabb told Thompson.

And last August, when Thompson&apos;s daughter turned 1, McNabb played cameraman again, videotaping the festivities.

His mother, Wilma, a case manager for Blue Cross/Blue Shield, said McNabb takes after her and her husband, Commonwealth Edison engineer, in his willingness to express emotion.

&quot;To me, he doesn&apos;t seem as tough as people say,&quot;she said.&quot;I see the softness in him.&quot;

Few defenses have.

McNabb was the backup quarterback as a sophmore for Mt. Carmel&apos;s state champions. The team went to the semifinals in his junior year and lost in an early round when he was a senior, but won the Prep Bowl.

Heavily recruited, McNabb ultimately chose between Nebraska and Syracuse. He opted to go where he thought he could play early and often. It was an unusual destination for a Chicago-area athlete; McNabb is one of only a handful of Midwesterners on the roster. The decision turned out to be prescient.

While demolishing numerous Syracuse offensive records with his versatile option style, McNabb also may have set a new standard for student-athlete time management. Despite starting every game for four years, after redshirting as a freshman, and playing two seasons of basketball, he graduated last spring with a bachelor&apos;s degree in speech communications and already has completed some master&apos;s level work.

He also has done radio commentary for a couple of Syracuse basketball games, something he would like to pursue professionally.

McNabb&apos;s on-time graduation leaves him free to stay off campus next semester and concentrate on being in shape for the National Football League draft. He is being mentioned as a high pick, perhaps by his hometown Bears.

&quot;I don&apos;t think about it unless other people bring it up,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;That would be something special. But whatever happens in April will be a reward for all the hard work I put in and for my parents.&quot;

McNabb acknowledges his family, friends and pastor at every turn. When he briefly considered forgoing his last year of eligibility after his junior season, the McNabbs caucused and deliberated and made a decision by consensus.

After the Orangemen won their last home game this season and emerged from the locker room with freshly minted Big East champion T-shirts, McNabb scrambled into the stands as quickly as he dodges defensive linemen and found his parents and Wilson.

Then, in a moment Rogers still can&apos;t discuss without getting teary-eyed, McNabb headed for the wheelchair section and took time to hug and post for photos with disabled fans.

A bad loss to North Carolina State helped erode McNabb&apos;s Heisman Trophy support, although he did receive votes. He shrugs off the voting as something he couldn&apos;t control, unlike the game that may have undone him.

&quot;I had the opportunity to make plays--I didn&apos;t make them,&quot;he told Rogers after the game.&quot;How are you doing?&quot;

One one occasion this season, McNabb made a 20-yard touchdown run down the left sideline with one shoe off, having been relieved of it by a would-be tackler. Rogers, sitting in the scouting booth, ripped off his headphones in wonder, then called the sideline coaches.

&quot;You&apos;d better enjoy this,&quot;Rogers said.&quot;You&apos;re watching a legend.&quot; Re: Archived Donovan articles

A Family&apos;s Love Leaves Its Mark
SU&apos;s Quiet McNabb Retains His Focus

by Donnie Webb staff writer

Two gleaming trophies the size of gargoyles rest atop the projection-screen television. One is the Most Valuable Player trophy from the Gator Bowl. The other is the Rookie of the Year award for Syracuse University football.

Donovan McNabb will never be lulled into admiring his reflection in the metal, though.

Sam McNabb makes certain of that. He is Donovan&apos;s father and mentor. He also is in charge of the television&apos;s remote control. Sam selects an oldie but goodie from his extensive library of home videotapes and slips it in the VCR. Click.

Donovan McNabb, the sophmore quarterback for the preseason Top 10 Syracuse University Orangemen and budding national star, smiles uneasily. He has reason. It&apos;s a 1989 performance of Donovan playing for the St. Jude Flying J&apos;s.

&quot;This is how we humble him,&quot;Sam says.&quot;Some people call these memorable moments. We call these humbling experiences.&quot;

A 12-year-old kid with oversized shoes clomps into view. The jog is recognizable. The player heads out to the field to take his position as...a defensive back?

&quot;Look how skinny he is,&quot;says Sean McNabb, Donovan&apos;s older brother and closest friend.

&quot;Sean, don&apos;t make me show you,&quot;says Sam.

Donovan resigns himself to the point his father is making with the film. He joins in the fun, though much of it is at his expense. His first instinct is to fight back. He gripes that the cameraman - Sam - never keeps a steady hand. He says his mom, Charlene, gets mad at him for carrying the football&quot;like a Louis Vuitton bag.&quot;He says the Flying J&apos;s had the worst cheerleaders.

His attempts at distraction fail. Donovan then offers a quick disclaimer as a plea for leniency.

&quot;I wasn&apos;t the Donovin Darius type,&quot;he says, referring to the Syracuse safety known for his punishing hits.

Sure enough, the first play is of McNabb attempting - lamely - to make a tackle. He reaches high for the shoulder pads in classic bad form. The ball carrier flicks him off like a bug, and Donovan sprawls out of bounds.

Sean howls with laughter. Donovan laughs, too.&quot;I was going for the ball,&quot;he says. Sam cranks up the volume so everyone can hear the coach yelling at Donovan to stop making arm tackles.

A few plays later, Donovan sees himself make a tackle so powerful, it brings him off the couch with screams of,&quot;Yeah! Yeah!&quot;{ I&apos;d love him to scream this to me, if u catch my drift...but oh well, he&apos;s taken! - GeorgiaEagle }

&quot;It only took him three plays,&quot;Sam says.

&quot;Mark me down - intimidator!&quot;Donovan says.

McNabb revels in the memories as his embarrassment fades. He recites every word the coach barks at him on the videotape. He alerts the gathering to upcoming plays. The family is in stitches, because this isn&apos;t show. It&apos;s just Donovan.

When McNabb sees himself take his turn at quarterback for St. Jude, his eyes light up. His voice becomes that of a television announcer.&quot;The move, the speed, he breaks three tackles...&quot;

He&apos;s not kidding this time. Donovan McNabb showed special gifts as a quarterback even as a 12-year-old. The elusiveness is there. A defender grabs onto his waist, but McNabb runs through the tackle and gallops into the open field. This is what Syracuse fans saw a year ago.

When he rolls out and completes a pass, there is special satisfaction.&quot;Who said I couldn&apos;t throw?&quot;he says.

Parents and Children

Donovan McNabb is a character, to be sure. But he is also a man with ethics. His values are the bedrock of his game, a force that allows the 19-year-old prodigy to play coolly in the heat of chaos.

Some call it a gift. Sam and Charlene McNabb hope it&apos;s because of good parenting.

Each member of the family has lightening wit and ferocious timing. Stumble and be humbled. It&apos;s the kind of intellectual Scrabble that builds quick thinking and toughness. If Donovan can stand in there against his father, mother and brother, standing in the pocket against the Miami pass rush will be a breeze.

The suburb of Dolton, Illinois, rests three miles from the Indiana border, 15 miles southeast of Chicago. The local arteries are clogged with malls, upscale car dealerships and restaurants like Bennigan&apos;s and Outback Steakhouse. Traffic is wretched.

Diekman Court {clearly this writer wants to aid all of Donovan&apos;s Syracuse and Chicago stalkers - GeorgiaEagle} is only a few blocks away from this commercial crossroads. It is a small loop of a street dominated by split-level houses, green lawns. It&apos;s surprisingly quiet.

Sam and Charlene McNabb moved from the South Side of Chicago to the &apos;burbs 12 years ago. Their home is neat, comfortable and unpretentious.

Sam is an electrical engineer with Commonwealth Edison, the area&apos;s power company. He sometimes works 12-hour shifts and is on call during weekends. Charlene is a registered nurse with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois. She rides a commuter train into the city and can put in 50-hour weeks. Sean, 24, lives at home. He works 12-hour shifts hanging doors on Escorts at a local Ford factory.

The family&apos;s work ethic is a legacy instilled by Sam&apos;s and Charlene&apos;s parents, who fled the economically and racially repressed South for jobs and a different life in Chicago. Sam&apos;s father worked himself to death in a steel mill. Charlene&apos;s parents, Charles and Maude Jenkins, worked in factories making boxes and magazines.

Charlene was 16 when she married, was 17 when Sean was born. Her parents insisted she graduate from high school and college. She did. The Jenkinses became mentors for the McNabb&apos;s and second parents for their children.

&quot;When I wasn&apos;t around, they&apos;d raise them,&quot;Charlene says.&quot;When you talk about morals and virtues, they were such a major asset.&quot;

&quot;They made sure we did things right,&quot;Sam says. The McNabbs celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary in October.

Donovan was particularly close to his&quot;granddady&quot;Jenkins, who died in 1994. He was a generous man who gave the grandchildren whatever they wanted.&quot;Spoiled them rotten,&quot;said Charlene. Jenkins brought balance and understanding to the family.

&quot;Granddady&quot;never saw Donovan play football at Syracuse, but he&apos;s always close to Donovan&apos;s heart. Donovan keeps a picture of his grandfather and immediate family beside his bed on campus.&quot;He always taught me to never doubt myself,&quot;Donovan says.

Last season, during a nationally televised game against Miami, Donovan did something that had relatives from California to Mississippi calling the McNabbs. After making a spectacular 17-yard touchdown run on a draw while eluding every linebacker on the field, McNabb stopped dead in the endzone and spoke directly into a television camera:&quot;This one&apos;s for you, Granddady.&quot;

Donovan says he did it because he often talked with his grandfather about the day he would play in the Orange Bowl. His grandfather encouraged Donovan to dream. {end of part 1}

Raising Donovan

Sam McNabb has a good swatch of gray hair for a man in his early 40s. He says he wears the silver ribbons proudly and credits his family with the awards. His wife gets a third of the credit, he says, Sean gets a third, and Donovan gets a third. On second thought, Donovan deserves a half, he says.

Charlene McNabb still laughs at her late mother&apos;s comment on Donovan:&quot;Where did you get this child?&quot;

Charlene and Sam asked the same thing. It was clear from an early age that Donovan was different.&quot;He had his own agenda,&quot;Sam says.

Charlene picked the name Donovan out of a book because she wanted something strong. What she got in return was a child with a strong will and a playful personality bent on mischief.

The calls from teachers began almost from the time Donovan entered elementary school. Donovan says he enjoyed being the class clown and making kids laugh. His parents failed to see the humor when they received reports of class disruptions.

&quot;I was the type of person who always found trouble,&quot;Donovan says.&quot;I was the guy who always got caught.&quot;

Sam says the only way to reason with Donovan at times was to&quot;back him up against the wall and make him understand that it was your way. I always threatened him by saying, &apos;Donovan, I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ll live to be 21.&apos;&quot;

Donovan often didn&apos;t understand his mistakes. He was doing his schoolwork. He was being himself. When his parents lectured him about his behavior, he complained they treated him as if he were&quot;invisible again.&quot;

His parents said he was always pleasant and easy-going. It was just that Donovan enjoyed school because it was an opportunity to have fun in his own way, said Sam.

Charlene remembers that in fifth grade, Donovan decided to explore his&quot;musicalness.&quot;He signed up for band, and Charlene rented a coronet.

The next year, Charlene continued to rent the instrument but noticed during the school year that&quot;we weren&apos;t going to any concerts.&quot;She called the school and learned Donovan had dropped band six months earlier and was&quot;hanging out with the custodian.&quot;

His parents were steamed. They felt Donvan had lied and betrayed them. Donovan had a different explanation.

&quot;He said, &apos;Dad, I didn&apos;t lie. You didn&apos;t ask me,&apos;&quot;Sam says.

Donovan was grounded for a month without television or telephone.

Becoming a Man

The transition to high school was a turning point. Sam saw it as a time Donovan would learn responsibility.

&quot;There was nobody to hold your hand anymore, except his mother,&quot;Sam says.

Donovan attended Mt. Carmel, an all-boys Catholic school on Chicago&apos;s South Side. Its motto is,&quot;You come here as a boy, you leave as a man.&quot;The McNabbs found the message appealing.

The school, built in 1918, has turned out some of the city&apos;s greatest athletes and sports teams. In the last 12 years, Mt. Carmel has won five state football championships. During that span, more than 200 of its players have gone on to play college football, a fourth of them landing in Division I or the Ivy League.

The school&apos;s trophy case is bursting with hardware. Hallways are decorated with newspaper accounts of great moments at Mt. Carmel. In the 1920s and 1930s, Mt. Carmel played in the city&apos;s fabled&quot;Prep Bowl&quot;at Soldier Field and attracted crowds in excess of 100,000.

The school gymnasium, which the local media call&quot;the bandbox,&quot;is straight out of another era. There are only four rows of bleachers on each wall. A narrow track is attached to the second floor, where students sit with their legs dangling over.

The gym is frequently used to shoot commercials because of its nostalgic look. Michael Jordan has done work here. The gymnasium was also featured in the recent film&quot;Blue Chips.&quot;One of Syracuse University basketball coach Jim Boeheim&apos;s cameos in the film was shot at Mt. Carmel.

The legacy of athletes is astounding, even by Chicago standards. Two of its most recent stars are the Arizona Cardinals&apos; Simeon Rice, the No. 3 player taken in April&apos;s NFL draft, and former Kentucky forward Antoine Walker, whom Boston took No. 6 in the June NBA draft.

Chicago Mayor Richard Daley Jr. has his kids currently enrolled at Mt. Carmel.

Donovan McNabb is not the first Mt. Carmel star to migrate to Syracuse. Former Orange head football coach Frank Maloney is a 1958 Mt. Carmel graduate and a former coach at the school.

Students come from all over to attend school. The Illinois Central Railroad tracks run behind the school and deliver nearly 200 of the school&apos;s 800 students every day. One student from Michigan City, Indiana, figured out that to complete his four-year education at Mt. Carmel, he traveled 85,000 miles.

The school is 80 percent white and is surrounded by a mostly black community. A Nation of Islam mosque, university and compound are a few blocks from the school.

Business in the area is struggling. Many of the storefronts are closed.

A sign tacked to a telephone pole in the neighborhood advertises&quot;Divorce in one day, $65.&quot;That the school continues to flourish is a tribute to its tradition. Re: Archived Donovan articles

Coach and Students

Frank Lenti is entering his 13th year as head football coach at Mt. Carmel. He is one of the best-known high school coaches in the country. Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz has tried unsuccessfully to lure him to South Bend.

When McNabb arrived as a freshman in 1990, Lenti knew he had a great athlete. But the coach didn&apos;t know what to make of McNabb&apos;s personality.

&quot;His sophmore year, he would come out to practice, would be dancing around silly-nilly,&quot;Lenti says.&quot;He would be like a 6-foot bowl of Jell-O.&quot;

McNabb played two years behind starting quarterback Mike McGrue, who went on to play fullback at Northwestern.

Lenti jumped all over McNabb, telling him he was twice the athlete McGrue was but only half the man. Lenti at first thought McNabb was disruptive, then figured out, just like McNabb&apos;s parents did, that it was just Donovan&apos;s way. He realized McNabb could serve the team by keeping it loose.

McNabb immersed himself in all sorts of sports. He played basketball, volleyball and track, often running from one practice to the next. Walker, the former Kentucky basketball star, says he was amazed at McNabb&apos;s work ethic and stamina.

&quot;Nobody worked harder than he did,&quot;Walker says.

Frank Kiszka graduated from Mt. Carmel in 1957 and has been working at the school since. He compiles statistics for&quot;The Caravan,&quot;the school&apos;s nickname. McNabb was always a favorite.

&quot;I&apos;ve said all along that he was the best pure athlete to come out of here,&quot;said Kiszka.

Lenti says the secret to McNabb&apos;s success at Mt. Carmel was Sam McNabb. Whenever there was a problem with Donovan, Sam stepped in.

&quot;I think Sam did a great job of keeping a foot on Donovan&apos;s neck whenever he needed to be stepped on,&quot;Lenti says.&quot;He could have been - what&apos;s that Steve Martin line? - &apos;a wild and crazy guy.&apos;&quot;

When colleges recruited McNabb as a senior, Syracuse coaches say Lenti was instrumental in giving the Orangemen a chance. Lenti uses the option game in his offensive package. He keeps a copy of the Syracuse offensive playbook in his home library. He had worked Syracuse camps and clinics in the past. Matching McNabb with Syracuse was a natural.

Lenti has boxes full of framed pictures signed by former players. One of his newest pictures is signed by McNabb. It reads:

To Coach Lenti:

Thanks for all the support that you have given me over my athletic career at Mt. Carmel. I will always be a Caravan. {wonder what their mascot actually looks like? For that matter, what in the world does Syracuse&apos;s mascot look like? -GeorgiaEagle} 

Donovan McNabb

Coming to Syracuse

Syracuse quarterbacks coach Kevin Rogers watched the mob gathering at Manley Field House with awe. At the annual Orange Fest gathering a few weeks ago, hundreds of kids and fans pressed forward with pens and programs. They gathered around the football program&apos;s most identifiable figure, the prodigy quarterback Donovan McNabb. The budding star seemed overwhelmed by the attention.

Rogers saw a sense of helplessness in the 19-year-old McNabb. He saw a kid looking uncomfortable by the adoration. He saw star-struck fans who could never really know McNabb as a person. He saw the star wanting to be just another player. Rogers felt a little sad.

Charlene and Sam say one of their son&apos;s most endearing characteristics is his selflessness.

&quot;He&apos;s not about Donovan. He&apos;s about the team,&quot;Sam says.&quot;It&apos;s a tremendous attribute. It makes my job almost meaningless.&quot;

Sam is forever playing mind games with Donovan just to make sure his son stays focused. The moment Donovan walked into the house this summer, Sam asked Donovan about the Heisman Trophy hype and whether he should win the award.

Even though Donovan finds himself on every short list in the country, he told his father he didn&apos;t know about the Heisman or didn&apos;t care. Sam was pleased. Last season, when Donovan&apos;s star began shooting through the sky, Sam called Syracuse coaches to see whether Donovan&apos;s ego was soaring out of control. He was assured there was no ego to check.

Most who know Donovan know his captivating smile. He&apos;s well-known as a cut-up among the Orangemen. When he accepted the Most Valuable Player award at the Gator Bowl, he had his baseball cap on backward, a no-no in SU coach Paul Pasqualoni&apos;s dress code. In his first start against North Carolina, Donovan broke the tension of the huddle by making a few jokes. It worked.

There is something adorable about the guy. He&apos;s smart. He&apos;s fun-loving. He&apos;s sensitive, though it&apos;s often hidden behind his humor. He&apos;s a guy who smothers his fried chicken in ketchup and barbecue sauce.

Despite his star qualities, McNabb is pretty much a normal teenager. He likes nice clothes. He bugged his parents for years about getting him a car. (He&apos;s got a Pathfinder). McNabb&apos;s closest friends at home look so young, they probably would be carded at a movie theater.

At an NBA summer-league basketball game at Illinois Tech, McNabb and his friends took up positions in the bleachers and draped themselves over one another like puppies. McNabb used his considerable charm to coax a nacho chip from some women who walked by. Sam says the phone never stops ringing whenever Donovan&apos;s in town. Yet Donovan&apos;s celebrity seems comfortably muted at home. This is home to Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Frank Thomas and Ryne Sandburg. There are no preseason magazine covers with McNabb&apos;s picture here. He&apos;s one of many famous alumni at Mt. Carmel.

Few recognized him as Syracuse&apos;s starting quarterback at the basketball game he attended. The few who did greeted him with,&quot;Hey, Superstar,&quot;or&quot;Mr. Heisman.&quot;McNabb shook his head disapprovingly.

That&apos;s not to say Donovan doesn&apos;t like to hang out with the beautiful people. On his first night home, he and his brother attended a huge party thrown by Chicago native Juwan Howard, the star forward of the Washington Bullets. Glenn Boykin, a friend of Sean and Donovan, went along.

&quot;I heard three young guys talking, and one of them said, &apos;Hey Donovan McNabb&apos;s in here,&apos;&quot;Boykin says.&quot;Sean stopped and laughed. He&apos;s like, &apos;That&apos;s my brother!&apos; We didn&apos;t know the people, but they knew who he was.&quot;

It was after 3 a.m. by the time Donovan crawled into bed after the party. He was up by 9 the next morning attending services at the New Christian Valley Full Gospel Baptist Church. A night later, Donovan returned to Mt. Carmel High School, where he talked to the school&apos;s football players.

There are no shrines to the player in the McNabb home beyond the usual team picture or plaques. This is a home where McNabb washed the dishes every other day, took out the garbage and spent Saturdays vacuuming or cleaning.

When he picked Syracuse, Charlene told Pasqualoni they were&quot;taking my dishwasher away.&quot;Donovan promptly announced he was out of the dishwashing business. But whenever he&apos;s home, the dishes are there.

McNabb sees himself through the prism of the men he mimics - Barry Sanders, Charlie Ward or Thurman Thomas. He&apos;s looking forward to the Minnesota game on Sept. 21. McNabb says that&apos;s because he can play on the same field and be like his hero, Warren Moon of the Minnesota Vikings. About the only tribute McNabb pays to himself is his personalized Illinois license plate - D NABB 5. And that was a surprise gift from his parents. {I can only hope that he doesn&apos;t have personalized plates in Philly -GeorgiaEagle.} 

Offensive coordinator George DeLeone says there&apos;s little question the Orangemen have a special person in the program in McNabb.

&quot;It&apos;s all genetics with an athlete like that,&quot;DeLeone says.&quot;The character of the individual comes from the home. The one thing I can bank on, the kid&apos;s been raised the right way. He&apos;s got a great start on life.&quot;

The parenting continues, though Sam says the job is nearly done. Charlene was worried enough about Donovan coming home this summer that she dispatched Sean to drive to Syracuse to pick him up. The two drove home in separate vehicles. When Donovan stayed out late one night, he called his father to let him know he was spending the night at a friend&apos;s house. Sam says he never doubted his kids would be a success. If he and Charlene did their jobs right, there was no way the children could lose.

&quot;I was always looked upon as the bad guy,&quot;Sam says.&quot;I&apos;m proud to the gray hair. I almost feel that mission is accomplished. I&apos;m on Easy Street. I&apos;m enjoying what I&apos;m seeing.&quot;

&quot;Hi - since I printed out a bunch of past Donovan-related articles awhile back for personal use, I thought I&apos;d share some of them. I definitely won&apos;t be posting these all at once, though: I don&apos;t have these saved on my computer like the articles on his wife I posted in the other thread, so I&apos;ll be typing these out by hand. I&apos;ll try to fix my typos as I go along, but some typos I may still miss - sorry in advance.&quot;

I&apos;m glad you guys are enjoying the reading. I&apos;ll try to put up some more reads - maybe not right now, but in the coming days. I don&apos;t think there are many (if any) more articles quite as long as that second one - except for this massive article out of the Syracuse newspaper that I plan to put up soon. (It&apos;s really good - published right as Donovan was finishing his senior season and sealing his legend.) I don&apos;t mind the length from my standpoint - gives my typing skills a chance to get some well-needed exercise, lol. And Destiny, if some more thoughts come to me as I&apos;m typing I&apos;ll insert them as well. Re: Archived Donovan articles

Syracuse Post-Standard (Syracuse, NY)

July 25, 1995


SU ATHLETE&apos;S SEASON NEVER ENDS
Donovan McNabb Wants to Take the Orangemen to a Bowl Game as Their Quarterback and Then Join the Basketball Squad At Point Guard

Donovan McNabb stepped outside the Henninger High School gym into the heavy air of a humid evening and pondered his double life.

In just a few weeks the Syracuse University football team would behin practicing for the September 2 opener at North Carolina. But here was McNabb, one of three strong candidates for starting quarterback, decked out in a purple Midnight Madness summer basketball league jersey.

Dressed for hoops, McNabb was talking about hook routes.

Almost every day, he said, he is throwing passes to SU receivers Marvin Harrison, Sir Mawn Wilson, Jim Turner, Darryl Daniel and Scott Mitchem. He&apos;s not alone - Keith Downing, a sophmore quarterback - is also practicing.

&quot;It&apos;s a group trying to find out who&apos;s ready and who&apos;s not,&quot;said McNabb, a redshirt freshman from Mt. Carmel High near Chicago.

Downing and Kevin Johnson, the third QB prospect, are not spending their summer nights in a hot gymnasium running the court with area standouts such as Bernard Blunt, Adrian Autry and Lazarus Sims. {Kevin Johnson is the same Kevin Johnson who is now the high-strung NFL wide receiver/malcontent currently with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He decided to concentrate on wide receiver when he quickly realized that McNabb was Da Man at QB. ~GeorgiaEagle} 

McNabb is as serious about basketball as he is about football. He was on the SU basketball squad last season, but while former SU fooball player Melvin Tuten gained fame with a dunk in the final seconds of a blowout against Le Moyne College, McNabb redshirted.

The decision, he said, indicates how much the SU coaching staff thought of his ability.

&quot;The one thing I&apos;d like to get clear is I was on the team to play and help the team win,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I would hope (SU coach Boeheim) knows that. I&apos;m not there to play the last 30 seconds or have the crowd chant my name. I&apos;m on the team to show the coaches I can play and help the team win.&quot;

McNabb said Boeheim suggested the idea of redshirting after watching the prize football recruit in one practice session.

&quot;I didn&apos;t want to waste a year where down the road I could help out,&quot;McNabb said. SU&apos;s two point guards - Michael Lloyd and Lazarus Sims - were juniors. Freshman recruit David Patrick had not yet signed.

&quot;In another year, there wasn&apos;t going to be anyone with experience in the program,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;Mike is going to be gone in a year and Z (Sims) will be gone.&quot;

Boeheim can&apos;t count on McNabb, whose immediate priority is on the football field, but the SU hoops coach isn&apos;t counting him out either.

&quot;He&apos;s got the skills, but it&apos;s really up to him,&quot;Boeheim said.&quot;What if they go to a bowl? He wouldn&apos;t be coming back until January 10.&quot;

Sims asked McNabb to play in the Midnight Madness league. McNabb hardly needed prodding. McNabb said the SU football coaches were a little taken aback when they learned what he was doing.

&quot;Coach (George) DeLeone said, &apos;Just don&apos;t sprain an ankle.&apos; I told him I wouldn&apos;t.&quot;

Besides, McNabb said, if he weren&apos;t participating in an organized game, he&apos;d be off at a playground somewhere in a pickup game.

&quot;I&apos;m not real happy abou it (but) we&apos;ve had some kids in (the summer league) before,&quot;DeLeone said. One basketball-playing notable was last season&apos;s starting quarterback Kevin Mason.&quot;Probably, on our team, we could field a couple of competitive (basketball) teams. They&apos;re kids and you&apos;re going to let them do it.&quot;

McNabb said the basketball has helped keep him in shape.

&quot;Running doesn&apos;t cut it,&quot;he said.&quot;Some people go running and then head straight for the buffet table. I like to be active and playing sports is a way to have fun and get in shape. I practice football in the day and then play basketball.&quot;

It&apos;s almost like the football team&apos;s two-a-day practice schedule in August.

In Syracuse&apos;s spring game, McNabb put up numbers far better than Downing or Johnson. He completed 9 of 11 passes for 164 yards. He threw one touchdown pass to Turner and ran for another score.

All that goes out the wondow come August, which he referred to as&quot;the time to get down and dirty and try to win a spot.&quot;

&quot;I want to go in and show the coaches what I can do and that I can handle it,&quot;he said.&quot;I&apos;m used to competing. It&apos;s nothing new.&quot;

Playing two sports isn&apos;t new to McNabb either. After passing for 874 yards and rushing for 633 more in high school, McNabb was rated the No.2 option quarterback in the nation. He also averaged 17 points, six rebounds and four assists on Mt. Carmel&apos;s 25-4 basketball team.

Aside from Tuten&apos;s personal fantasy experience last season, no athlete has played both football and baskteball at Syracuse in 30 years.

McNabb thinks he can, but he won&apos;t if he can&apos;t contribute to both. First, he wants a bowl appearance for the football team, and then,&quot;I&apos;ll go right into basketball.&quot;

&quot;Football would start weightlifting anyway,&quot;he said.&quot;With basketball, I&apos;ll stay in shape and still be lifting. I feel I can help the (basketball) team after practicing with them for one year.&quot;

Some of u Philadelphians may remember this article...

Philadelphia Inquirer (PA)
December 5, 1999

CHILLING WITH MCNABB, JUST A REGULAR GUY HE MAY BE THE FUTURE OF THE EAGLES FRANCHISE, BUT HERE HE&apos;S JUST AS NORMAL AS PIE

He is just Donovan, son of Wilma and Sam McNabb of Diekman Court {Again... stalker alert! And in Philly, no less. I wonder if the McNabbs were ever&quot;visited&quot;by the likes of Sean Young before being mercifully moved to another location by their loaded son? ~GeorgiaEagle} in the middle-class south suburbs of Chicago. He is like any other guy who turned 23 on Nov. 25, as he sits at the back table at the T.G.I. Friday&apos;s restaurant just off South Street with Eagles tight end Luther Broughton and a female friend, picking from the combo platter of buffalo wings, chicken fingers and potato skins.

Looking for dirt? He heaps gobs of ranch dressing on his mozzarella sticks.

&quot;That&apos;s nasty,&quot;Broughton says. {&quot;It sure is,&quot;GeorgiaEagle says.} 

&quot;Ranch,&quot;McNabb explains,&quot;goes with everything - french fries, sandwiches, when you run out of mayonnaise. It&apos;s the bomb.&quot; {O.k. Donovan, you&apos;re my man and everything, but u are grossing me out. Ranch is good on celery sticks, good on carrots, even good on some salads...but that is ALL! Here&apos;s hoping you&apos;ve outgrown your abuse of ranch dressing. ~GeorgiaEagle} 

The Eagles&apos; rookie quarterback, the future of the franchise, is speaking about the frustration of not playing, about whether he ever went to coach Andy Reid and complained before he finally became the starter three games ago.

&quot;Yeah,&quot;McNabb says.&quot;I went into his office, threw my hat on his desk, and said, &apos;Now look, man, I want to play!&apos; Then I lifted his desk, turned it over, and told him, &apos;You&apos;re going to play me, right?&apos;&quot;

Then it&apos;s more comedy, on to an imaginary interplay between McNabb and his parents, after he gets a fictitious tattoo -&quot;a big old cross on my back, outlined with dreads.&quot;

&quot;They&apos;ll say, &apos;Donovan, something wrong with you? You all right?&apos;&quot;he says in a deep, parental tone, enunciating every syllable before switching voices again.&quot;I&apos;ll say, &apos;I&apos;m finding myself.&apos; And I&apos;ll get me some Timberlands, some boxers, some high socks - my game socks, yeah. I&apos;ll be all thugged out.&quot;

He becomes serious for a moment and says,&quot;My brother got his name tattooed on his leg and my mother went offffff. She said, &apos;What&apos;s wrong with you? You don&apos;t know your d**n name?&apos;&quot;

It&apos;s a cold day on South Street, and Donovan McNabb, the future of the franchise, is, well, just a normal guy.

Call it an acute curiosity or, perhaps more accurately, a curse, but it is our nature to want to know every nook of a celebrity&apos;s being. No matter who it is, there is this expectation of the extraordinary, that even going to the store holds some sort of cosmic intrigue. Of course, if you are human, you are just that, quarterbacks included.

Alas, the question is handed to McNabb: What do you do off the field?

He gazes around the restaurant, as though he is buying time to think of some fabulous answer.&quot;Uh, I guess, chill,&quot;he says, defeated.

Her it is in a nutshell: Donovan McNabb is a guy who lives with his older brother, Sean, in a home in Cherry Hill, who likes to bust chops with his friends, play with Akili Smith on the Madden 2000 game for Sony PlayStation, attend Sixers games, watch movies, eat hamburgers, sleep, and chill.

He drives a polished burgundy Chrysler, a dealer&apos;s car, and he takes umbrage at the question: Why no Benz?

&quot;It&apos;s a nice car,&quot;he says, at first apologetically. {Oh, how things change$$$...~GeorgiaEagle} &quot;I like it. One thing I don&apos;t like is when people talk about a person and talk about his money. I can&apos;t stand that. Just talk about the persona and get to know that person, not what he has or how much money he can get.&quot;

He also doesn&apos;t like it when people gawk at him and don&apos;t say hello. (&quot;When we see somebody, we wave or stop and talk. That&apos;s the way I was raised.&quot;) Or when people slap him on the back or punch him in the arm and say,&quot;Good game, kid.&quot;Or when they call him&quot;mister.&quot;(&quot;I look around for my father.&quot;)

He likes his neighbors. He loves children, since, he says, he still is one. (&quot;I&apos;m just out of college. I&apos;m not all the way grown.&quot;)

And he considers himself, regardless of how many times his name is printed or spoken, or the size of his contract, in no way a celebrity.

&quot;See? I do the same things everybody else does,&quot;he says.&quot;It&apos;s just you might see me on Sunday playing football.

&quot;People say, &apos;He&apos;s in the NFL, his head&apos;s going to blow up. He&apos;s a young guy. He doesn&apos;t know what he has.&apos; Man, I know what I have. It&apos;s just I don&apos;t show people. I just take things in stride, know what I&apos;m saying? You won&apos;t see me in flashy cars or flashy clothes. That&apos;s just me.&quot; {While Donovan&apos;s no Michael Irvin, it seems as though he&apos;s gotten flashier since these comments. Just look at some of the stuff he wears to press conferences, and the customized SUV speaks for itself. ~GeorgiaEagle} 

On this icicled day, he wears sweats and a Syracuse pullover. He says this weather is nothing compared with Chicago and Upstate New York. He says he&apos;s not a wimp.

No, Donovan McNabb never did barnstorm Reid&apos;s office. In truth, there were times when the urge came. Not that he had to fight to suppress it. Maybe if he were somebody else, from a different family, he would have at least said something. After all, he was the last of this year&apos;s rookie-quarterback crop that includes Smith, Tim Couch and Cade McNown to get a start, sitting behind Doug Pederson, and the Eagles&apos; offense resembled the dead bulb in a string of Christmas lights.

Then there was the Giants game, when Mcnabb entered on the day&apos;s second series that began at the Eagles&apos; 17-yard line. It lasted all of three plays and had McNabb thinking:&quot;Is that it? Am I going back in there to redeem myself?&quot;

{continued below...} Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by georgiaeagle on Jun 22, 2004, 1:43pm

{continued from above...}


&quot;And,&quot;he says,&quot;as we know, I didn&apos;t go back in there to redeem myself. But you can only be mad for so long. I was definitely mad we lost and the way we lost, but I forgot about it.&quot;

&quot;It was frustrating at times,&quot;he continues.&quot;Early on, I felt I should have been in there, but I never went up to Andy and said, &apos;Am I going to play this week?&apos; or &apos;How much am I going to play?&apos;

&quot;And you know? I didn&apos;t know what I know now. I definitely didn&apos;t grasp the magnitude of the game early on. I&apos;ll be honest, sitting there watching what Doug went through - and a lot of the heat Doug took was unfair - that helped.&quot;

What helped the most in grooming Donovan McNabb occurred last week in defeat. Under a gloomy sky in Washington, McNabb orchestrated two 91-yard drives in the fourth quarter to help tie a game the Eagles lost in overtime.

On those drives, he chased the worry of an entire city, throwing lasers to receivers, galloping for first downs, and proving for the first time he could play in the NFL.

&quot;I&apos;m learning about the game,&quot;he says.&quot;How long till I get it? I can&apos;t say when. But I have confidence. It&apos;s just so hard on a quarterback. One game you throw for 300 yards, then against a team that game-plans you different, you only throw for 150.&quot;

It took John Elway, the future Hall of Fame quarterback who retired last season after leading the Denver Broncos to two straight Super Bowl titles, two years to learn the offense Reid employs, and McNabb sometimes feels as if he is stuck in a maze of mirrors, his face slapping against glass, his brain throbbing from confusion.

Does he like the offense? Yes, then he adds that he&apos;ll like it better when he gets it down cold. In the interim, his wide eyes plead for patience, and he hears the echo of Reid hollering, calling him by his uniform number:&quot;Five, it&apos;s going to be there. You have to trust it, Five.&quot;

The table talk is of the Heisman Trophy, awarded to the top college football player in the nation. Last season, as a senior at Syracuse, McNabb went from being a preseason favorite to win the award to dropping to the middle of the pack to staying at home instead of attending the ceremony. This year&apos;s winner will be announced on Saturday.

&quot;Hey,&quot;McNabb says in that voice, imagining himself bursting through the doors of the Downtown Athletic Club and swiping the Heisman in mid-presentation, then smashing it into a billion pieces.

&quot;I&apos;m going up to take the Heisman and run. &apos;And the winner is...&apos; And they&apos;re going to see me run from behind, grab it and spike it. Nobody&apos;s going to win it. They&apos;re going to say, &apos;Oh, my God, what is he doing there?&apos; { ~GeorgiaEagle} 

&quot;Then they will say, &apos;We knew something was wrong with him.&apos; You know, when somebody does something bad, they always bring something like that up. They&apos;ll say, &apos;He walked funny. He hit that girl with the Pac-Man lunchbox in the sixth grade.&apos;&quot; { ~GeorgiaEagle} 

Running back Ricky Williams won the Heisman last year. This year, the favorite is Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne.

&quot;Yeah, I&apos;m scarred to this day,&quot;McNabb says sarcastically.&quot;Everybody knew Ricky was going to win.&quot;

&quot;Like Dayne&apos;s going to win this year,&quot;Broughton says.&quot;Who do you think?&quot;

&quot;Michael Vick,&quot;responds McNabb, referring to the Virginia Tech quarterback.

&quot;Vick? Wonder Why?&quot;growls Broughton.&quot;He&apos;s a lefthanded Donovan McNabb.&quot;

This irks McNabb.

&quot;He&apos;s a lefthanded Michael Vick!&quot;he shoots back.&quot;I sponsored him during a recruiting trip to Syracuse, and he told me I was his idol. I told him, &apos;Be yourself, man. You don&apos;t want to have people comparing you. Besides, you can&apos;t be me, that&apos;s very tough.&apos;&quot;

&quot;Sure ain&apos;t because of looks,&quot;Broughton needles. {Ok, I agreed with Broughton about Donovan&apos;s abuse of ranch dressing, but this is where I jump off the bandwagon. ~GeorgiaEagle} 

&quot;Hey, I&apos;m about to have a [modeling] book made,&quot;McNabb says.&quot;I&apos;m serious. [Tennessee Titans running back] Eddie George has one.&quot; {I&apos;m surprised that every page of Eddie George&apos;s modeling book isn&apos;t up on eddiegeorge.com. ~GeorgiaEagle} 

&quot;Eddie George is ripped,&quot;Broughton says.

&quot;What are you saying?&quot;McNabb says.&quot;I ain&apos;t ripped? I got a rip. Hold up, let me find it.&quot;

&quot;Just make sure you&apos;re wearing a long-sleeve shirt in the pictures,&quot;Broughton says. {This fool doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about! ~GeorgiaEagle} 

McNabb laughs a laugh from his belly.

This is Donovan McNabb being who he is, enjoying a day off on South Street with his buddy, doing what any other 23-year-old would do. It&apos;s not complicated or cosmic. It&apos;s just life.

Outside, there is a ticket on the winshield of his Chrysler. The parking meter had expired. Oh, well.

McNabb gets to work in the heat of desert

The Eagles quarterback has bought a house in Arizona and hired two experts in fitness to supervise his torture there.

By Bob Brookover

Inquirer Staff Writer


PHOENIX -For Donovan McNabb, it all begins in the searing desert heat.

This is where he comes to simultaneously get away and get ready.

&quot;I look at this more or less as a vacation,&quot;he said.&quot;A vacation where I get to work out.&quot;

Yesterday&apos;s Arizona retreat for the Eagles&apos; Pro Bowl quarterback started a little after 9:30 a.m. For the next 75 minutes, McNabb went through an intense, fast-paced workout directed by Warren Anderson and Tim McClellan, two guys who try to make torture seem like productive fun.

McNabb was joined by a small but hardly select group of other players, including David Barrett, Justin Lucas and Anthony Clement from the Arizona Cardinals. All of them went through the same drills, which are designed to simulate moves, cuts and reactions needed to be successful on a football field.

They hopped, they sprinted, they navigated tackling dummies, they boxed and they chased after tennis balls on an unassuming field that sits behind a giant swim club in the middle of a residential part of the city.

They also sweated profusely.

McNabb, however, was the only one who declined the water breaks. It&apos;s just another way for him to show his mental toughness, which he displayed in abundance last November against the Cardinals when he had perhaps the best individual game of his career despite playing most of it on a fractured right ankle.

For the record, there appeared to be no lingering effects from the injury that forced McNabb to miss the final six games of the regular season and didn&apos;t allow him to play at 100 percent in the playoffs.

&quot;The ankle is not an issue anymore,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I can pretty much do a lot of the things I was doing before.&quot;What has lingered this off-season is that loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC championship game.

&quot;It probably took about two weeks to get rid of it, and then it came back again when somebody would bring it up,&quot;he said.&quot;Then it would take me another two weeks and then it would come back again. No matter how you look at it, it always seems to come up. You try to forget it, but I use it as motivation and inspiration to come out here and work harder.&quot;

Though the stakes won&apos;t be nearly as high, the Eagles will get a shot at immediate revenge when they open the 2003 regular season at Lincoln Financial Field with a Monday night game against Tampa Bay.

&quot;I was excited to see that, but you can&apos;t get overly excited right now,&quot;McNabb said.

Far more exciting for McNabb was Monday&apos;s news that the Eagles had signed safety Brian Dawkins to a seven-year contract. Like all his veteran teammates, McNabb was disappointed when the Eagles did not retain free-agent defensive end Hugh Douglas.&quot;Any guy who gives you 14 or 15 sacks consistently every year, that&apos;s kind of hard to fill in,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I don&apos;t care what combination you&apos;re using. He was one guy you constantly had to double-team.&quot;

McNabb believes the Dawkins signing will help soothe some of the bad feelings about Douglas&apos; departure.

&quot;I think it will calm it down,&quot;he said.&quot;I think with the whole Hugh Douglas thing, it put the locker room in a whole different outlook. If we didn&apos;t sign Dawk, who knows where it would have been in the locker room? It&apos;s good to know that Dawk is there and he&apos;ll be there at least for the duration of my career.&quot;

With that peace of mind, McNabb and his teammates will open their first off-season minicamp Friday at the NovaCare Complex. When that ends, McNabb will return to Arizona for more of his off-season workouts. Late in May, he expects to be joined by wide receiver Todd Pinkston and running back Correll Buckhalter.

McNabb, 26, is convinced that the desert is the best place in the world to get ready for an NFL season. He has been in love with the area since he started working out in Arizona after his rookie season, and he bought a home in the area this off-season.

&quot;It&apos;s quiet out here,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;You don&apos;t have to worry about people being in your business or going out and being harassed as much. You&apos;re able to sit out in your backyard, read a book, and enjoy the good weather. I let my dogs run around in the backyard and I get in the pool.&quot;

But it&apos;s more than the dry heat and relative anonymity that attracts McNabb to Phoenix. He also has faith in Anderson and McClellan, who are independent strength and conditioning coaches who run a training facility called the MakePlays.com Center for Human Performance.

&quot;We do a lot of change-of-direction drills,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;You have to have core strength, and I&apos;m not just talking about your abs. Your hips have to be loose, your lower back has to be loose. It goes beyond the core part of it to things like reaction time.&quot;

What McNabb ultimately wants is the same as every Eagles fan.

He knows the next Super Bowl will be in Houston, and he&apos;d like to be more than a spectator this time. That is the point of this desert madness.

In June, McNabb will marry his college sweetheart, Raquel Nurse, a former point guard and two-time MVP on the Syracuse women&apos;s basketball team. It&apos;s a day he is looking forward to, but he may not let it be an interruption to his off-season routine. He thinks his wife will understand.

&quot;She has a great idea of the way I prepare and the way I do things,&quot;he said.&quot;With her being an athlete, she knows. Obviously, it&apos;s her day and she wants to have a great day with it. I just want to get it over with.&quot;

McNabb wedding reception at Ritz-Carlton in Chicago

Eagle QB will be married Saturday

By JENICE M. ARMSTRONG

armstrj@phillynews.com


WHEN EAGLES quarterback Donovan McNabb has his first dance with his bride on Saturday night, it will be beneath a gigantic, sparkling crystal chandelier.

And when he takes a break from the wedding festivities, he&apos;ll have a view from the magnificent floor-to-ceiling windows in the ballroom on the 12th floor of Chicago&apos;s Ritz-Carlton Hotel.

At this point, many details are still sketchy about the closely-guarded nuptials planned for this weekend between McNabb and his long-time girlfriend Roxi Nurse. McNabb has declined to speak publicly about the much-anticipated affair.

&quot;I&apos;m really private with my social life,&quot;he said earlier this month.

Nurse, who is intensely private, hasn&apos;t returned phone calls.

Still, even with the bride and groom keeping mum, it&apos;s inevitable that some details of the affair would leak out. After all, the McNabb-Nurse nuptials are expected to be the wedding of the summer. Would you expect anything less from a man who signed a 12-year contract worth $115 million last year?

&quot;It&apos;s probably going to be an elegant affair,&quot;speculated Mindy Weiss, the wedding planner who organized Laker Shaquille O&apos;Neal&apos;s lavish nuptials in December.&quot;I&apos;ve found that with any sports wedding that I&apos;ve done... that they&apos;re not afraid to celebrate. They like to celebrate in a big way.&quot;

&quot;It will probably be black tie, tall center pieces, beautiful lighting,&quot;she added.&quot;Because anything on an upper floor with windows has to be lit beautifully. And there&apos;ll be a band as opposed to a deejay.&quot;

A highlight of the evening, no doubt, will be a huge cake by someone like famed baker Sylvia Weinstock, who baked Sixer&apos;s star Allen Iverson&apos;s five-tier wedding cake. According to In Style Weddings magazine, O&apos;Neal&apos;s cake was four layers made in the shape of pillows sitting on a sled and decorated with a crown and tiara.

&quot;They don&apos;t go for the little two-tiered cakes,&quot;Weiss pointed out.

When the partying dies down, out of town guests won&apos;t have to travel far. Some have reserved rooms at the Ritz-Carlton at a discounted rate of $315 per night. (The normal rate is $525 a night.)

It&apos;s a slightly different deal for the ceremony. The wedding will take place earlier in the day about 30 miles away from Chicago in a suburb called Oak Forest. It will be held in McNabb&apos;s home church, New Christian Valley Church, which also has a church in South Holland.

When it opened in 1996, the Chicago Sun Times described the Oak Forest church as having wooden ceilings, lushly padded pews, imported marble and giant movie screens behind the choir.

McNabb on J.Lo, A.I.

By Ashley McGeachy Fox


He laughs easily, and often. Despite obscene wealth, impenetrable confidence and a demanding job, Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb is pleasantly humorous, an everyday sort of guy who, like a lot of us, shops for groceries and adores his spouse.

Although he rarely reveals it, this season of injuries, harsh criticisms and slow starts has wounded even him. McNabb has maintained a strong front, even when the Eagles were 0-2, Rush Limbaugh was criticizing him, and Birds fans were booing. He has played through a sore foot, a bruised thumb and a brutal slump.

At the season&apos;s midpoint, McNabb and the Eagles are 5-3, and very much alive in the playoff hunt. In a rare one-on-one interview during the season, McNabb, wearing a brown-and-tan Reebok sweat suit, sat down Wednesday to talk about this season, his love of basketball, his new wife, and the spoils, and burdens, of being famous.

Question: You&apos;re at the midway part of the season now. What would you like to forget about the first half, and what do you want to remember?

A: Just from my position, I don&apos;t look at it as far as forgetting and remembering. The outlook of the whole deal is that we&apos;re 5-3. We&apos;re in great position, obviously, to make the playoffs and make a run for the NFC championship. Some of the things that could be in the forget department are the things that happened early on in the year, but I use that as motivation and something I can learn from, and I have been learning from them, just from the way that I was playing, the injuries, the whole Rush Limbaugh deal, being banged up every week. It&apos;s something you have to go through as a quarterback. You never think you would go through it all in one year, but I guess it all fell in my department. But I&apos;ve learned from it. I think it&apos;s made me stronger mentally. I think it&apos;s made me stronger as a person, and as a husband.

Q: Since you brought it up, is it different going through a season as a spouse versus as a single guy?

A: I&apos;m still learning. No, really, it hasn&apos;t been hard. I&apos;ve been fortunate to have a beautiful woman that&apos;s been there for me ever since college. She&apos;s been through the good times, the bad times. She was there when I got booed at the draft. She was there when they were cheering me here, and I was voted Pro Bowl here, and booed and talked about on TV. So she has been sort of the blanket in all this. What I mean by that is, when things are down, she&apos;s been the one to provide the positive input and spark to uplift my spirits if I need it, or just to give me the words of encouragement so I can continue on.

Q: Allen Iverson has said that he would love to be in your shoes for a season, to pull a Michael Jordan and give up basketball, but play football instead. Would you switch with him?

A: I would love to play basketball. It&apos;s a long season, but basketball, as a football player, is a big-time hobby. We all do it together. We all played basketball in high school, and we all played basketball in college. A lot of us are great athletes, and we can make things happen. But to say that we can play in the NBA, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s accurate. I&apos;d love to say that. I would love to play in the NBA, but I think my main focus should be here.

Q: Could you see Allen as a quarterback in this league?

A: When I came out of high school, Allen and I were both all-Americans in football. Allen was an all-American in football and basketball. He was an athlete, and they kind of labeled him an athlete because he was able to do so many things. But we&apos;ve talked one on one, me and Allen, and he loves the quarterback position. He supports myself. He supports Michael Vick, Ronald Curry when he was at North Carolina, because those guys are from Virginia. He&apos;s a big-time fan. He&apos;s played football and he&apos;s played the position, so you respect him more for that.

Q: Are we ever going to see you dunk a football over the crossbar again?

A:With all these injuries, I don&apos;t know if I can get close. I don&apos;t know. It all pretty much comes at that particular time. If you&apos;re so excited, your adrenaline&apos;s pumping, you might try it. But I don&apos;t want to be that guy that they keep showing on ESPN or Comcast missing the goalpost and falling flat on my back.

Q: On Monday, during ESPN&apos;s Monday Night Countdown show, they did a piece about one of the players going to the barbershop. Afterward, they ragged you out about your hair.

A: I know. Hey, not everybody&apos;s able to grow their hair like me. I get talked about in the locker room all the time, that&apos;s why I usually have it braided. It was just something to me that it was funny when I saw it... . They [the panel] were talking about it, and were like &apos;Yeah, you know, guys need to come to the barbershop, like Donovan.&apos; I was like, how did I get first mention? Warm me up at least. It was funny. They had my training camp picture. Then he went to Jerry Rice, which really made my hair look great, the way Jerry&apos;s was looking.

Q: Do you have a preference, braids or Afro?

A: I&apos;m having it braided during the week, and also during games. I kind of mix it up. Later on during the week, maybe on Friday, I take the braids out and let my scalp breathe a little bit. Then I get it back in during Saturdays. It was something I was doing during the off-season. I&apos;m having it braided, and then I don&apos;t have to worry about waking up and fixing my hair, or if somebody touches it you have to pick it again. It was just time to change it up.

Q: Do you have a favorite commercial that you&apos;ve done, either by how it turned out or how much fun it was to make?

A:I would probably say the Campbell&apos;s soup commercials because we&apos;ve done them three years running. I enjoyed the Visa commercial. My first shoe commercial, or I would say probably the apparel commercial, the Reebok commercial, with myself, James [Thrash], Jon Ritchie and Pink [Todd Pinkston]. I just love doing them. It&apos;s great marketing. It&apos;s funny because the comment that Warren Sapp made [a few weeks ago] about us really not being marketed because our faces aren&apos;t out there and people pretty much know us by our jersey number and all of a sudden now our face. You want to keep your face out there so people know I&apos;m a human being as well. Although you see me on Sundays or Mondays, and the guy that you see is No. 5, this is me. This is how I look. This is the type of person I am.

Q: Did you agree with what Sapp said, when he made an analogy comparing the NFL&apos;s ownership system to a slave-master system?

A: Well some things I think he probably could have held back. We&apos;re marketing players, but it&apos;s kind of hard when you&apos;re not dribbling a basketball up and down the court and people can see you. Then the NFL has all these rules where you can&apos;t take your helmet off, you can&apos;t wear too many wristbands, your towel has to be so long. There&apos;s just so many laws that they put into the books now that we are kind of like robots.

Q: Is there a spoil of wealth that you&apos;ve allowed yourself?

A: Like going out and splurging on something? No. I get talked about about that as well. People call me cheap, but I think I&apos;m pretty much well-balanced with my money. I don&apos;t go out and just buy things because I like them. I always ask the question of myself, &apos;Do I really need it?&apos; Just because you might be able to go buy it, what are you going to do after you don&apos;t need it and you still have it? So not really.

Q: Is there anything that fame prevents you from doing that you&apos;d like to do?

A:Yeah, just running into a store, going to a mall, going out to dinner with my wife, going to a movie, doing some of the things that the normal people do. But we&apos;re normal. Make sure people know that. But the everyday things, sometimes you just go and you might go to a workout facility or you might go out to eat afterwards, and people are like, &apos;Hey, can I get an autograph,&apos; and you just want some private time to unwind a little bit. It&apos;s fine when people come up, that&apos;s not the problem. But when they want to talk about football, and they&apos;re like, &apos;Well, what&apos;s going on with Andy Reid? Why aren&apos;t you guys doing this?&apos; That&apos;s when it becomes hard.

Q: So do you refrain from going places, and stay home more?

A: No, I still do those things. I walk up and down the grocery store aisles. I take my wife to the movies, or we&apos;ll go eat, or I&apos;ll stop at a fast-food restaurant. I still do those things. And I&apos;m like, &apos;Hey, how are you doing?&apos; and I&apos;ll sign autographs. Those are just things that come with the territory.

Q: Do you have any chores or responsibilities at home you have to do on Tuesday, your off-day?

A: Tuesday is the day I usually relax, but I usually run errands, and have everything set up so I don&apos;t have to worry the rest of the week. My off-day, I take full advantage of it, and I top it off by watching Playmakers [on ESPN] at 9 o&apos;clock.

Q:Still no invitation to be on the show?

A:No invitation. I&apos;m waiting to get invited. They had Snoop [Dogg] on on Tuesday. I&apos;m cheap. I won&apos;t ask for a lot.

Q:What role would you play?

A:I don&apos;t know. Snoop had a great part. He was working with the kids and getting them off the street. I wouldn&apos;t want to get shot like Snoop. You don&apos;t want to be the guy at the club scene, because then people would say, &apos;Look at Donovan.&apos; That&apos;s not me.

McNabb on J.Lo, A.I. (continued from top)

Q: Could you act?

A: Oh, I&apos;m a great actor. I&apos;ve been acting ever since I got here.

Q: Earlier this season a friend of yours, Dallas quarterback Quincy Carter, said he doesn&apos;t talk to you as much now because you&apos;re married.

A: Aw, man. You know, I don&apos;t want people to think that just because I&apos;m married now I&apos;m cutting people off. I&apos;m still the same guy. I don&apos;t have that overbearing wife that wants you off the phone or anything. I know some people like that, but I&apos;m not.

Q:If you had a son, would you encourage him to be a professional athlete?

A: No. I would just be very supportive of everything he wanted to do. And that&apos;s why I really commend my dad, because he was never the guy who threw sports in our faces, my brother&apos;s or mine. If it was something we wanted to do, he was there for us. At times he had to step in and put his foot down and say, &apos;No,&apos; or &apos;Maybe you should do this.&apos; But he never forced anything on us.

Q: If you happened to be in town in February, would you want to see the Vet implosion in person?

A: Yes and no. Yes, not because the Vet is a bad place. We had so many big games there. We played so well there so many times. So many people have played there that are memorable players. Yes because it&apos;s a special thing. No because those cats and rats will be looking to travel home with some of us.

Q:Do you have a CD that stays in your car?

A: Not necessarily. I&apos;m an R. Kelly fan - of his music; make sure I say that. Of his music. He&apos;s from Chicago. I&apos;m very supportive of him, and he&apos;s supportive of me. I listen to all his music. Just some of the latest songs that come out, I try to stay in tune with.

Q:Do you have a preference between J. Lo and Beyonce?

A:I&apos;m tired of both of them. Both are cute girls, but I&apos;m tired of hearing and seeing both of them. We need to bring up Alicia Keys, an Ashanti, some of those beautiful women that are trying to come up.

Q: What about Katz versus Street?

A: Street. Street&apos;s my guy. I don&apos;t know Katz, but Street&apos;s my guy. I remember we set up a program in the Philadelphia area as far as trying to get the kids off the street, and he&apos;s continued to go on and done a wonderful job. Some of his ideas and some of the things he&apos;s done, as an athlete you commend. He&apos;s always tried to involve some of the players, the faces of Philadelphia, reaching out and trying to get the kids involved with some of the community services.

Q: Do you have a preference of who runs against George W. next fall?

A: Bring Bill Clinton back. Big Bill.

Q: What do you think of Gov. Rendell as a football analyst?

A:Are we still on the record?

Q: Yes.

A: Although he wasn&apos;t a big fan of me coming out of college - we went through that whole deal - I think that some of the things he may say on the air as far as football is concerned are good. Some are questionable. I think as a whole he has a good mind as far as what&apos;s going on with sports and some of the things he might like to get done.

Q: When it comes to people criticizing you, whether it be people booing you at the draft or booing in the stands this season, are you a forgive-and-forget guy, or a remember-and-move-forward?

A: I&apos;m more forgive, but never forget. That&apos;s kind of a wide range, and kind of odd, but I never forget the people who have dogged me. I never forget the people who have booed me. I never forget the people who have been in my corner. I never forget the people who continue to back me. To say that I&apos;m down, or Andy&apos;s banged up, no. Things are going to turn out positive. I don&apos;t think you should mention them. I don&apos;t think you should get down, because it&apos;s early in the season. Now that we&apos;re winning, everybody&apos;s like, &apos;Hey, all right, those guys look great.&apos; The same people that were there at the beginning are the people I respect.

Love comes to pass

Philadelphia Inquirer

Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb won one on the road Saturday as he married longtime girlfriend Raquel-Ann&quot;Roxi&quot;Nurse near his boyhood home in suburban Chicago.

McNabb wore a black suit, necktie, spats, and his usual grin during the ceremony in Oak Forest, Ill. For the reception at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago, he changed into a white dinner jacket. Roxi&apos;s strapless gown had a beaded bodice and taffeta skirt.

The 12th-floor ballroom was done up in white with red.

&quot;It was a meeting of two families who really love each other,&quot;observed Susan Yannessa, a guest. The whole room - which included Eagles owner Jeff Lurie and coach Andy Reid - seemed to stop during the mother-son and father-daughter dances.

McNabb&apos;s wicked sense of humor came through in the church. While reciting his vows, he mumbled lawfully wedded wife so the 300-plus worshipers heard something like awfully wedded wife. Roxi took pains to enunciate her version

McNabb will welcome summer as married man

Daily News Staff Report


HIS SUIT is being designed by Ernesto, the custom clothier at 6th and South streets who makes many of his clothes.

And the date for Donovan McNabb&apos;s wedding to longtime girlfriend Roxi Nurse is set for June 21 in Chicago.

But other details about McNabb&apos;s upcoming nuptials are being guarded as closely as an Eagles playbook.

&quot;It could be in Philly, it could be in Syracuse,&quot;he teased earlier this week.&quot;I could be married already and y&apos;all just don&apos;t know it.

&quot;What do y&apos;all need to see me get married for?&quot;McNabb continued.

Yo, Donovan, what&apos;s the big deal? Weddings are social occasions, where you announce to the world that this is the person who you intend to spend the rest of your life with.

&quot;I&apos;m really private with my social life,&quot;McNabb explained.&quot;It&apos;s just something I keep low.

&quot;I&apos;m not about to make the VH1 celebrity weddings show,&quot;he said.

McNabb got engaged last year to Nurse, who works at Villanova University, while the couple was on a two-week Caribbean cruise.

The last time there was this much interest in a local wedding was two years ago when Sixers star Allen Iverson married in an elaborate ceremony at the Mansion in Voorhees, N.J.

To keep things private, only a handful in his inner circle even knew the location. On the day of the event, there were dummy vehicles and alternative wedding sites to move to in case the nuptials were discovered. But even with that, word got out beforehand about the wedding&apos;s location.

&quot;Unfortunately, in [McNabb&apos;s] position, because of his celebrity, no matter what he does, he&apos;s going to have a huge following,&quot;said Lisa Wagner, Iverson&apos;s wedding coordinator.

&quot;Even with the Iverson wedding, there were so many people - good-hearted people - who wanted to come out and wish him well,&quot;said Wagner, whose Denville, N.J., company is called Enchanting Affairs.&quot;At Iverson&apos;s wedding, we had people who were posing as guests, who we caught right at the door.

&quot;When we were setting up, I was in one of the rooms going over linen colors,&quot;she continued. And&quot;there was a gentlemen we caught in one of the rooms. I contacted building security immediately and we had him thrown out.&quot;

These days, it&apos;s not unusual for celebrities to do as Iverson and McNabb and go to great lengths to keep their wedding day hush, hush.

&quot;Without a doubt, keeping such information private is any celebrity&apos;s right, seeing as it is one of the few realms of privacy they can still control - and quite frankly, have a right to,&quot;said Amy Goodman, an assistant editor of InStyle Weddings.

A taste for privacy is something both McNabb and Nurse relish. Since her days on the basketball court, Nurse has stayed out of the spotlight.

But during their undergraduate days together, McNabb and Nurse were both known for their athletic prowess and spent a lot of time at each other&apos;s games and studying together. Friends describe them as being like an old married couple.

Last year, Wilma McNabb, Donovan&apos;s mother, expressed pleasure at her son&apos;s choice, saying:&quot;We&apos;ve known her for a while. Roxi was around before Donovan was &apos;Mr. Donovan, NFL Quarterback.&apos;&quot;

Growing up, McNabb never really gave much thought to how he wanted his wedding to be.

&quot;You visualize you standing there and her coming up and you&apos;re married,&quot;he said, earlier this week.

As the days count down to the first day of summer and the first day of Donovan&apos;s life as a married man, lots of questions remain:

Will the wedding take place at Donovan&apos;s home church of New Christian Valley Church in South Holland, Ill., just outside of Chicago? And will the Bishop Harold Daniel Wilson preside over the ceremony?

What will the colors be? Who&apos;s designing Nurse&apos;s wedding gown? Workers at Suky Rosan in Ardmore, an exclusive bridal retailer who fitted Allen Iverson&apos;s bride as well as WCAU-TV (Channel 10) news anchor Renee Chenault-Fattah, said yesterday that Nurse had not purchased her dress from them. As for how McNabb&apos;s suit will look, he wouldn&apos;t say.

&quot;You kind of want to just unveil it at game time,&quot;he said.

And, finally, will McNabb ease up and let his fans share in his special day - at least just a little?

&quot;Y&apos;all try hard. I give y&apos;all that,&quot;he told a reporter, laughing.

McNabb&apos;s desire for privacy unlikely

Experts: Public scrutiny won&apos;t allow it

By JIM NOLANWed, May. 29, 2002


Donovan McNabb wants his privacy. He&apos;ll probably get it when Larry Bowa converts to Buddhism and finds inner peace.

Right now, Bowa would probably settle for a .500 record.

And McNabb, whose engagement to former Syracuse University sweetheart Roxi Nurse was outed two weeks ago, would probably prefer that the media resurrect the old passing-quarterback vs. running-quarterback debate of last season.

&quot;I like to keep my private life really private,&quot;McNabb told reporters last week, when asked about his impending nuptials, following the first day of Eagles mini camp.

But that is not likely to happen, according to experts in pop culture, public relations and the right to privacy.

They say society&apos;s obsession with celebrity - and in some cases, a celebrity&apos;s carelessness and obsession with stardom - has opened the playing field for inquiries into areas that used to be out of bounds.

Philly&apos;s big celebrities are its sports figures. And the amiable McNabb, like Philly&apos;s other, less gracious superstar, Allen Iverson, generates interest that spills off the field of play.

&quot;It all depends how interested the public is in them,&quot;said gossip guru Richard Johnson, editor of the New York Post&apos;s Page Six.

&quot;Ultimately, the public decides; they let us know if we&apos;re not giving them the stuff they want us to write.&quot;

Johnson noted that many celebrities go out of their way to promote themselves.

&quot;When they go out they insist on stretch limos, red carpets and have to have a whole entourage,&quot;he explained.&quot;Then they get upset if nobody pays attention to them.&quot;

The downside comes when there is a mishap, said New York City public-relations honcho Dan Klores.

&quot;Then it&apos;s more likely to bite you in the behind,&quot;said Klores, who represents top-tier stars Paul Simon and Jay Leno, and local philanthropist Sidney Kimmel among others.

For the most part, McNabb&apos;s fame falls into another category. His football accomplishments naturally attract the public&apos;s eye to other parts of his life, whether he wants them to or not.

&quot;It seems somewhat unfair to say that because a person&apos;s gift lies in acting, basketball or singing rather than, for example, engineering, architecture or computer science, that he or she has somehow &apos;chosen&apos; to give up all of his or her privacy,&quot;legal expert Julie Hindlaw writes in Findlaw.com.

&quot;A celebrity&apos;s private life is not an oxymoron,&quot;Hindlaw wrote in a recent column on supermodel Naomi Campbell&apos;s British court victory over a photo snapped of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.

&quot;Rather, it is something the celebrity can either defend - by keeping the topic off-limits in interviews - or destroy, by making herself a role model for a lifestyle that, in truth, she does not follow.&quot;

To date, McNabb&apos;s public image has largely been defined on the field. But his recent forays into commercial endorsements potentially open up his private life to more scrutiny.

McNabb has done television commercials for Campbell&apos;s Chunky Soup and has endorsement deals with Verizon, Sony PlayStation and a Wegman&apos;s Market in the Syracuse area.

&quot;I think there is sort of an unwritten rule that if you use your image to promote yourself or a product, then your image becomes fair game,&quot;said Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at American University.

A soup commercial may not be an invitation to examine McNabb&apos;s closet. But last winter, the quarterback also appeared in the MTV series&quot;Cribs,&quot;during which he allowed a camera into his South Jersey home for the half-hour show.

According to Klores, that&apos;s a no-no for any celebrity hoping to safeguard his privacy.

McNabb gets a hand at the Palm

By DAN GROSS

grossd@phillynews.com


After the Birds won Sunday&apos;s game following his 4th-and-26 pass to Freddie Mitchell, Donovan McNabb brought 26 family members and friends into the Palm (200 S. Broad) at about 9 that night.

The party, including wife Roxi Nurse and mother Wilma, was seated in the front of the restaurant shortly after arriving. But while waiting by the bar, McNabb signed autographs for a few fans.

Once seated, Palm staff kept fellow diners from approaching the table, but the excited crowd delivered standing ovations and the obligatory&quot;E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!&quot;cheer.

The crew feasted on seafood- platter combinations, including lots of lobster, with McNabb choosing a steak for his entree. The food was washed down with steadily flowing bottles of Vueve Clicquot champagne. No. 5 paid the several-thousand-dollar bill by credit card and, we hear, left a generous tip.

McNabb does it all with a smile (part one)

By Ray Didinger
NFL Insider

The Philadelphia Eagles were filing past head coach Andy Reid, who was standing, arms folded across his chest, deep in thought. The team was riding the crest of an emotional wave that would carry it to an 11-5 regular season and its first playoff berth since 1996, but the coach was concerned.

Reid worried that his players might fall into the trap of enjoying their success a little too much. He had raised the issue in the morning meeting. You&apos;ve done a great job, he told the team, but we still have a long way to go. He said he didn&apos;t want to see anyone letting down or losing focus.

As the players headed to the locker room, several cracked up laughing. Reid shot them a disapproving What-did-I-just-tell-you? look. Donovan McNabb, who was in the middle of the group, making faces and telling a story, spied Reid in the hall.

McNabb immediately stiffened his back, tucked in his chin and marched past the coach like a military-school cadet passing before the commandant. Reid smiled and shook his head.&quot;You&apos;re a beauty,&quot;he said.

&quot;You know the best part?&quot;the coach says now.&quot;We went out that day and had a great practice.&quot;

Ever since he invested the second pick in the 1999 draft on McNabb, Reid has compared the former Syracuse All-American to Brett Favre, with whom Reid worked as an assistant coach in Green Bay. Reid saw two quarterbacks of similar size, both strong-armed with the ability to run and improvise. They also had a certain aura, a natural confidence mixed with a guy&apos;s-guy sense of humor that played well in a football locker room. Other players gravitated to them and, on game day, believed in them.

&quot;They didn&apos;t have to work at being leaders, they just were,&quot;Reid says.&quot;Brett can be the funniest guy on the bus going to the stadium and the most serious guy on the field. Donovan is the same way. He likes to have fun, but he&apos;s all about winning and that rubs off on the whole team.&quot;

Wilma McNabb, Donovan&apos;s mother, heard these stories for years, going back to Donovan&apos;s days in peewee football. It is nice, she says, to hear a coach talk about her son&apos;s sense of humor as a good thing. It wasn&apos;t always that way.

&quot;When Donovan started in organized sports, he was in the fourth grade,&quot;his mother says.&quot;The coaches would tell us, &apos;Your son is always talking and joking.&apos; We heard the same thing from his teachers: &apos;Donovan is the class clown.&apos; We were really upset. We&apos;d say to him, &apos;Why can&apos;t you be serious? What do you want to be, a comedian?&apos;

&quot;I remember riding home after talking to one of his coaches. [My husband] Sam and I were in the front seat, Donovan was in the back. Sam was saying, &apos;Can&apos;t you do something with him?&apos; I said, &apos;You&apos;re his father.&apos; Sam said, &apos;But you&apos;re with him the most.&apos; We were going back and forth. Donovan sighed and said, &apos;Oh, I&apos;m invisible again.&apos; He&apos;d say that because we had these discussions about him all the time and it was like he wasn&apos;t there.&quot;

But as Donovan reached his teens, Sam, an electrical engineer, and Wilma, a registered nurse, stopped worrying. Their son was earning good grades. He excelled in every sport. He wasn&apos;t in any trouble. Maybe Donovan&apos;s way was okay after all. Maybe there wasn&apos;t any reason for him to change.

&quot;When he went to high school [Mt. Carmel, near Chicago], the basketball coach said the same thing, &apos;Donovan acts like a clown,&apos;&quot;Wilma McNabb says.&quot;I told him, &apos;Well, that clown is succeeding.&apos; That&apos;s just Donovan&apos;s way. He wants to have fun. He told me, &apos;Mom, if I can&apos;t have fun doing something, what&apos;s the point of doing it?&apos;

&quot;When people are around him for a while, they understand it. It&apos;s one of those things where they don&apos;t see it until they see it. But all you have to do is look at what he&apos;s accomplished.&quot;

At 24, McNabb already has taken his place among the elite players in pro football. Last year, in his first full season as a starter, he finished second to St. Louis running back Marshall Faulk in the voting for most valuable player. McNabb carried the Eagles to a second-place finish in the NFC East, accounting for almost 80 percent of their total offense, passing for 3,365 yards, and leading the team with 629 rushing yards.

He guided the team to six victories in its final seven regular-season games and a 21-3 win over Tampa Bay in the wild-card playoff round, even though his best running back (Duce Staley) was lost to injury and his starting wide receivers (Charles Johnson and Torrance Small) were so ineffectual both were released in the offseason. It was a one-man offense, yet McNabb made it work.

&quot;He reminds me of Roger Staubach, because he can do everything,&quot;Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi says.

&quot;Donovan is the prototype of the twenty-first century quarterback,&quot;Deion Sanders said after McNabb led the Eagles to a 23-20 victory over Washington, one of three games in which McNabb brought his team from behind in the fourth quarter to win.&quot;That is the future of the NFL, that style. The day of the dropback quarterback is over.&quot;

The victory over the Redskins served as McNabb&apos;s MVP showcase. He completed 19 of 30 passes and rushed for 125 yards, the most rushing yards for an NFL quarterback in one game since 1972. He scored on a 21-yard run, freezing safety Mark Carrier with an open-field move (&quot;Like Barry Sanders,&quot;Carrier said) and dragging two tacklers across the goal line. He broke away on a 54-yard run in the final minutes to set up David Akers&apos;s game-winning field goal.

&quot;People ask me, &apos;What&apos;s the most amazing thing about Donovan?&apos;&quot;says tight end Chad Lewis, who had 69 catches and joined McNabb in the Pro Bowl.&quot;To me, it&apos;s not his mobility or his arm. It&apos;s his poise. Nothing rattles him. He comes into the huddle, and you can see it in his eyes. It&apos;s been that way from the first snap. The harder teams come at him, the calmer he gets. He&apos;s like antifreeze.&quot;

&quot;I just enjoy playing. I love the competition,&quot;McNabb says.&quot;People say, &apos;I was watching the game, and it looked like you were smiling out there.&apos; Yeah, I probably was. I love that feeling, everyone in the huddle looking at me, eyes wide. It&apos;s like, &apos;This is it. Who wants to make the big play?&apos; I love having the ball in my hands in that situation. That&apos;s just me.

&quot;Like when people talk about me joking around. I always did that. I did it in high school, I did it at Syracuse, and so I kept doing it when I came here. People were acting like, &apos;Rookies shouldn&apos;t be doing that stuff.&apos; But I like to mess around with the guys. I hang out with the linemen. I steal some of [defensive end] Hugh Douglas&apos;s candy when he&apos;s not looking. I know not every quarterback is like that, but you have to be yourself. That&apos;s the only way you can be a leader.&quot;

McNabb does it all with a smile (part two)

McNabb led the Eagles in every way imaginable last season. He set club records with 569 pass attempts and 330 completions as the team reversed its 5-11 record from 1999. In the playoff victory over Tampa Bay, McNabb completed 24 of 33 passes and accounted for all 3 touchdowns, passing for 2 and running for another on a quarterback draw.

McNabb knows this season will be an even greater challenge. The expectations for the Eagles are high. Philadelphia&apos;s fans, still giddy from last season&apos;s joy ride, are talking Super Bowl. Marty Schottenheimer, the new head coach in Washington, picked the Eagles as the team to beat in the division. With Staley recovered from his foot injury and newcomers James Thrash and Freddie Mitchell added to the receiver corps, the Eagles have everyone&apos;s attention, which is a mixed blessing.

&quot;We&apos;ll have a tougher schedule, a lot of late starts [for national TV] and night games,&quot;McNabb says.&quot;But that comes with winning. If you&apos;re a good team, you learn how to deal with it.&quot;

At the center of all this is the quarterback who, for all of his fanfare, still has started only 22 regular-season games. He spent the offseason filming commercials and making personal appearances, taking on a national profile that must be validated weekly through the 2001 season. The pressure would be enormous anywhere, but especially in Philadelphia, where a noisy contingent of Eagles fans booed his selection on draft day. They wanted the team to select Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner from Texas, with that second overall pick.

The memory of walking onto the stage that day and being booed (&quot;First time in my life,&quot;McNabb says) still pains McNabb, although the city has tried its best to make amends. When he attended a Philadelphia 76ers playoff game in the spring, the crowd gave him a standing ovation when his picture was flashed on the scoreboard. Everywhere he goes, he is greeted with smiles and handshakes.

&quot;Sometimes it crosses my mind: &apos;This person who&apos;s being so nice to me, was he one of the ones booing me?&apos;&quot;McNabb says.

&quot;Remember the guy last week? It was right over there,&quot;says Sean McNabb, Donovan&apos;s older brother, pointing across the restaurant toward the door.

&quot;Yeah, he said he was a big fan and asked for an autograph,&quot;Donovan says.&quot;I was joking around. I said, &apos;Yeah, I&apos;ll bet you booed me.&apos; He said, &apos;Oh no, not me.&apos; But did you see the look on his face? It was, like, &apos;Guilty.&apos;&quot;

Sean laughed.&quot;Yeah, I&apos;ll bet he was one of them,&quot;he says.&quot;You still gave him the autograph.&quot;

&quot;He seemed like a nice guy,&quot;Donovan says.&quot;I gave him the benefit of the doubt.&quot;

Sean, 29, has shared a Cherry Hill, New Jersey, home with his brother since Donovan&apos;s rookie season. Sean was a food service manager in Boston, but now he works for a job placement firm in Philadelphia. Donovan asked Sean to join him shortly after he signed his seven-year, $54 million contract. He wanted to have someone he could trust, talk to, lean on. Who better than his big brother?

The arrangement worked so well, it is now entering its third year. Donovan rarely leaves the house without Sean. A burly figure, Sean has the look of a professional bodyguard, which, given Donovan&apos;s celebrity status, is a good thing. Sean is a gregarious fellow with a hearty laugh, but he also has a stare that makes strangers tread lightly around his little brother. Wilma McNabb is thankful for their relationship.

&quot;It is a good indication that Donovan is still Donovan; he hasn&apos;t changed,&quot;she says.&quot;The people close to him today are the same people who have been close to him all his life.

&quot;Donovan is very aware of what&apos;s going on. All these demands on his time. Come here, go there. We talked about it. He said, &apos;Mom, we aren&apos;t going to change.&apos; But there are people who will think you changed because you don&apos;t have time to do the things you used to do. They&apos;ll say, &apos;He forgets where he came from,&apos; even if it isn&apos;t true. All you can do is be true to yourself. Donovan is that.&quot;

Wilma helps coordinate Donovan&apos;s appearance schedule. She keeps a calendar with all of his bookings and stays in touch every day. Twice during lunch McNabb went to his Palm Pilot to check on his various appointments.

He had accepted an invitation to speak at the Success Summit Workshop at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. His topic was&quot;Empowering America&apos;s Children.&quot;He also was preparing for the first Donovan McNabb Foundation Gala in Chicago, a three-day event, which would include a football camp, a $150-a-plate dinner, and a basketball game between the Harlem Globetrotters alumni and a team of NFL stars led by McNabb. All proceeds would go to the American Diabetes Association (McNabb&apos;s grandmother died of diabetes, and his father suffers from the disease).

Reid saw this coming last season as McNabb&apos;s star rose and more people tried to hitch a ride. The coach warned his young quarterback not to take on too much. Reid supplied him with an offseason program: two weeks of passing drills alternating with two weeks of free time.

&quot;One of the things that sold us on him was his work ethic,&quot;Reid says.&quot;You always hear, &apos;So-and-so is a hard worker.&apos; But what does that mean? Will that player be willing to do what we ask of him? We&apos;re going to ask a lot. With Donovan, it was never a concern. He practically lived in the coaches&apos; office. He was always in the weight room.

&quot;That&apos;s why you saw the great improvement [in 2000]. People talk about his athletic ability and the plays he makes, but it&apos;s not just about his [natural] ability. What you saw last season was an extremely talented athlete, yes, but also a player who had worked long hours to improve his understanding of this offense. He was reading things [on the field], anticipating things. Each week, you saw him grow.&quot;

Reid deserves credit for bringing McNabb along slowly, for not rushing him onto the field too quickly during his rookie season, when the Eagles were a disheveled mess of a team. Reid started Doug Pederson at quarterback while the Eagles lost seven of the first nine games and the fans and media clamored for him to play the rookie. The coach stood his ground, insisting he would not start McNabb until the youngster had a solid grasp of Reid&apos;s offense.

When McNabb finally took over, it was a bumpy trip. The rookie made mistakes and took a ferocious beating. In a week 14 loss at Dallas, McNabb was hit on the left knee and suffered a sprained ligament. With only two games left on the Eagles&apos; schedule and the team going nowhere, it would have been easy for McNabb to ride out the last few weeks in the whirlpool. But he spent hours working on the knee so he could start the final game, which Philadelphia won 38-31 against the eventual Super Bowl champion Rams. That sent a powerful message about how much he wanted to win.

From that moment on, the Eagles were Donovan McNabb&apos;s team. In 2000, he led them to the playoffs. This season, they are poised to fly even higher.

&quot;I like what I saw in our minicamps,&quot;McNabb says, while signing autographs.&quot;There is a maturity factor. A lot of young guys who weren&apos;t sure of what they could do last season, now they&apos;ve got that confidence.

&quot;That&apos;s all I&apos;m thinking about. Doing commercials, doing appearances, that&apos;s fine, but it&apos;s not the bottom line. It all comes back to football. It all comes back to winning. If we were a five-and-eleven team, who would want me? I&apos;ve been there [5-11], and I don&apos;t want to go back.&quot;

McNabb engages in serious work

WITH SOME professional athletes, getting engaged to be married might be viewed as a significant step toward maturity, a move toward settling down and becoming more serious.

Except, Donovan McNabb always has seemed pretty serious.

Or, as McNabb said yesterday, when asked about the changes wrought by his recent engagement to longtime girlfriend Raquel Nurse,&quot;Who&apos;s to say I was wild in the first place?&quot;

The Eagles quarterback is preparing for his fourth NFL season at a minicamp that began yesterday and ends Friday. McNabb said he didn&apos;t think the engagement had changed his life much.

&quot;I&apos;ve been pretty much doing the same things that I had been doing,&quot;he said.

That was the extent of the insight McNabb offered. Always cautious and guarded, he seemed even more so yesterday, and he clearly was displeased by Saturday&apos;s Daily News front page heralding the news of the impending wedding, for which no date has been set.

&quot;I like to keep my private life really private,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I don&apos;t worry about what you guys are doing in your households... It so happens some news was made. You guys are blowing that way out of proportion.&quot;

Tight end Chad Lewis, married with three children, said teammates weren&apos;t shocked to hear of McNabb&apos;s planned nuptials.

&quot;I&apos;m just happy for him,&quot;Lewis said.&quot;He&apos;s been going out with &apos;Roxie&apos; for 8 years. We all knew it was a matter of time.&quot;

Lewis agreed that McNabb isn&apos;t exactly lacking in maturity and seriousness. Lewis credited McNabb&apos;s parents, Wilma, a registered nurse, and Sam, an electrical engineer.

&quot;He&apos;s got everything under control,&quot;Lewis said of McNabb.&quot;You can tell he&apos;s got great parents. The stability is different [than for an athlete from a less nurturing family]. Even though he might not be 40 years old, he&apos;s grounded.&quot;

Wide receiver Freddie Mitchell said that when McNabb ties the knot,&quot;the whole team&apos;ll be there. We support whatever he does, just like on the field.&quot;

Nurse graduated from Syracuse in 1998, a year before McNabb. She was a basketball point guard who is Syracuse&apos;s career assists leader and ranks seconds in steals. Currently, Nurse works with athletes at Villanova, as assistant director of academic support.

Total Access with McNabb, Douglas
12/24/03

Eisen: Now, last time you were on with us, you said the Eagles were going to the Super Bowl.

Douglas: Oh yes. Most definitely.

Eisen: Do you still feel that even though they finally lost a game Sunday?

Douglas: Well, you know what? I think that if you&apos;re gonna lose a game, you need to lose that one, &apos;cause then you can get it out of your system, because they had ran off, what, nine straight wins?

Eisen: That&apos;d be 10.

Douglas: Ten straight wins?

Eisen: Yeah, right Donovan?

Douglas: Oh well, you know ... yeah. Okay.

Donovan McNabb: It was nine. It was nine.

Eisen: Nine straight wins.

McNabb: But, I like that fact that you said 10.

Douglas: Well, see Rich; there it is. Rich, you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about.

Eisen: Well, was that a right answer, Donovan, for him to say?

McNabb: It was nine. It was nine.

Eisen: Yeah, was it a right answer?

McNabb: Great job. Great, great job there, Hugh. That was excellent right there. I love the way you ran things off with it.

Douglas: Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

Eisen: So Donovan, did anybody come and tell you about Hugh&apos;s Super Bowl prediction for you guys?

McNabb: No, you know what? Hugh and I talk just about every other week and it&apos;s just that, that attitude that we had while we were over here, you know, we can get to that point if we just continue to stay focused and I think the big thing about us is the fact that we&apos;re a confident bunch. We&apos;re a team that continues to stay focused and Hugh knows that. So we&apos;re not going to let anything bother us, even though we lost a game last week. But again, it&apos;s something that we can use to fuel the fire to kind of propel us to this playoff run.

Douglas: Hey Donovan, on a serious note though ... What&apos;s the mood in the locker room right now? Because that was a tight game yesterday, man. And you know, I can see you were a little frustrated, so I mean, what&apos;s the mood in the locker room? What did Big Red go in and say to everybody after that game?

McNabb: Well, he just told us that we had opportunities to win that game. We just have to take full advantage of it. We&apos;re a much better team than they were and you know, it just so happens we didn&apos;t pull it out. And I think the thing that stands out about us, is we&apos;re a little upset right now. We&apos;re a little frustrated, but the only thing we can do is go out on the practice field and try to change things up, and you know, for this weekend to kind of get us going into the playoffs.

Douglas: Hey, you know what? I got another question for you, Donovan. I know this is not your area of expertise because this is a defensive question. But, you know, honestly, on the run, you&apos;ve been getting a little, you know, banged up on the run a little bit. You&apos;re playing the pass great, so I mean, is that a little concern for you going into the playoffs?

McNabb: I don&apos;t think it is. I think, you know, I can only focus on the offensive side and I think with the opportunities that the defense gives us, we have to take full advantage of that. We know that we&apos;re gonna come up with some big plays with them stopping the run, with them in the pass game. But on the offensive side, we just have to be able to execute at all times.

Douglas: Oh, yeah, that&apos;s cool. That&apos;s cool. Didn&apos;t mean to get all serious on you man, but you know.

McNabb: Oh yeah, let me get all philosophical on you too.

Douglas: You know I had to kinda switch gears here, because you know ... you got a little serious at times and then you got to keep it kind of hot.

McNabb: Yeah, I can dig it. I can dig it.

Douglas: Hey, how&apos;s my man Ike [Reese] doing?

McNabb: Ike&apos;s doing good. But let me ask you a couple of questions. ... With [Byron] Leftwich stepping in there making some big plays for you ... Being a young guy, what type of leaders do you have stepping up and just kind of laying the pressure off of him? You know, you got guys like Jimmy Smith, Fred Taylor, my man Kevin Johnson&apos;s down there. You&apos;re down there. A lot of experienced players. I know Mark Brunell ... was his day yesterday. And that&apos;s a beautiful thing that you guys did for him because, I mean, he is one of the top quarterbacks that has played the game and for everything that he&apos;s been through, and what he&apos;s going through right now, it&apos;s kind of tough. I appreciate what you guys did. But what I mean, what are you guys doing to kind of take the pressure off of Leftwich?

Douglas: Well, you know what? Initially, when I first came down here, you know the whole idea was that Mark was going to play and unfortunately, it didn&apos;t work out like that. But, Leftwich really stepped in and he really surprised me. He kind of reminds me of another quarterback that I used to play with way back in the day. A guy by the name of&quot;Five.&quot;You know, man, he came in ... he has a lot of poise for a young guy. Why are you laughing? This is my serious voice. He has a lot of poise for a young guy, and he does a lot of positive things out there on the field. And you know any time you have a running back like Fred Taylor back there toting the rock. I mean, you always have a chance to win.

McNabb: I got my [Mike] Strahan look. I got my Strahan look

Douglas: Oh, I see the lip. I see the lip. But you don&apos;t have the gap. You know what I&apos;m saying. Hey, but Strahan&apos;s my boy though, you know, I was just kidding. Hey Strahan, they just jokes. They just jokes man.

McNabb: [Warren] Sapp too. Sapp be getting all sensitive, man.

Douglas: Yeah, the bulged eyes. Yeah.

McNabb: Yeah, yeah. They just jokes. They just jokes.

Douglas: They just jokes, man. I don&apos;t need to get no phone calls later on tonight.

McNabb: Yeah, I know, right. Yeah, keep doing Campbell&apos;s Soup Strahan.

Douglas: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That&apos;s live. That&apos;s hot. That&apos;s hot. Keepin&apos; it hot. Keepin&apos; it real hot.

Eisen: You guys look like Sapp/Strahan, the way, you know. We don&apos;t really afford the big screen of too many people on this show.

Douglas: We are not. I&apos;m not fat. I&apos;m, I&apos;m not fat. I&apos;m not trying to say that anybody&apos;s fat. I mean, it took years to get this frame man. And I mean ...

McNabb: Argh!

Douglas: It&apos;s still a work in progress. Hey, and it&apos;s still a work in progress, baby.

McNabb: Argh!

Douglas: Hey, we should go to the wide shot, so you can see how chiseled, grrrr, this body is!

Joyner: Hey Hugh! Hey Hugh! You know you going in the wrong direction when you start off as a linebacker and you wind up as a defensive end.

McNabb: Yeah.

Douglas: Hold, up. Wait a minute, man. That was in college. I mean ... and the defense that we ran in college, it was a Split Six defense and as you know, the defense, the linebackers are like defensive ends.

McNabb: The what!

Douglas: It was a Split Six. It was a small school. Hey, everybody didn&apos;t go to a big school. Everybody didn&apos;t do Chunky Soup commercials. Everybody doesn&apos;t have ads ...

McNabb: Not everybody&apos;s football team is still playing, either.

Douglas: Oooohh!

Eisen: Oh wow! Now, you guys were talking about cornrows before. What happened, what happened to Randy Moss&apos; hair this weekend?

McNabb: I like that. I like that. That&apos;s being real gangsta with it. You know what I mean? They let their hair down.

Douglas: Yeah. That was kind of like the Snoop Doggy Dogg look. Hey man, but you were rough on my team like that though, for real though, man. That wasn&apos;t even cool, man. That&apos;s why ya&apos;ll lost yesterday, punk.

McNabb: Hey, why you gotta go there with it? Ouch!

Douglas: Way to hit below the belt there, Donovan!

McNabb: Ouch! Ooouuuch!

Eisen: Alright guys, well listen. We appreciate you, Donovan for coming on. Hey, if you keep asking questions like that, people are going to start thinking you&apos;re part of the liberal media.

Douglas: What?

McNabb: No, they&apos;re not!

Douglas: Hey, what&apos;s up with that Rush Limbaugh thing, man? You know, you should have whipped Rush, man. You should have whipped him behind that comment.

McNabb: Hey, it was overrated. It was overrated.

Douglas: It was?

McNabb: It was overrated.

Douglas: But you know what though? Hey, but you know ... If you were ... you know what, if that had been me, I&apos;d have talked about his problems that he&apos;s having now. Go ahead and say something about him on TV and let everybody hear it, man. Say something about those problems he&apos;s having right now.

McNabb: Naw, I&apos;m being professional about that now.

Douglas: Go on and be petty! Be petty! No, be petty, man, be petty!

McNabb: I&apos;m a professional about that now. You don&apos;t have to worry about me going to try to get back at him. I&apos;m just being professional.

Douglas: Be petty, man. Come on, man. Say something about the addiction. Say something about the Betty Ford.

Joyner: Aww, Hugh. Stop trying to stir the Chunky Soup, man.

Douglas: Naw, man, I&apos;m just saying man, you know. That whole black guy comment, you know ... and being a black guy, such as myself. Being a little militant ...

McNabb: Are you Black? Are you really Black?

Douglas: Hey, that&apos;s just like asking, that&apos;s just like asking somebody is your hairline receding. Is your hairline receding? Why yes, it is.

Eisen: All right guys, listen. Donovan ...

McNabb: All right Hugh, I&apos;ll see you later.

Eisen: We appreciate you joining us here on.

Douglas: See you later Donovan.

McNabb: Hey, your shirt look tight, too!

Douglas: Hey dude, this is a big shirt. It&apos;s Nike. You don&apos;t know nothing about that. You don&apos;t know nothing about that.

McNabb: Naw, Reebok is where it&apos;s at.

Douglas: Naw, Nike&apos;s where it&apos;s at.

Tuesday, December 30, 2003
By David Fleming
ESPN The Magazine

Santa was getting away.

It was only 4 p.m. on a recent Tuesday afternoon yet already I-95 North in Philadelphia was clogged with cars. Up ahead, Santa (aka Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb) and his police escort were slicing through traffic like ball carriers through the Vikings defense; the flashing lights getting farther away by the second. This was it. We had one last chance to keep up. A tiny opening appeared across three lanes of traffic, over on the opposite shoulder between the off-ramp impact barriers and the steal bumper of a dirty delivery truck. A choice had to be made. And so I did what anyone would do while traveling in someone else&apos;s fully insured car: I turned to the driver of our sluggish but game silver minivan -- a brave member of the always above-the-call-of-duty Eagles PR staff -- and screamed: You got room for miles, dude Gun it!

But there was no turning back now.

The engine moaned and swoosh like a jet breaking the sound barrier, we made it through with a tinsel of space to spare on either side. Alas, the silver bullet had had enough. We turned off our hazards and eased back into traffic-unscathed.

Santa wasn&apos;t quite as lucky. When we did catch back up to McNabb, who was making his annual holiday appearance at a home for children in downtown Philly, he was already in full costume. (Minus the bling-bling that his mother, Wilma, made him take off.) And like the rest of his NFL season, Santa&apos;s trip had been quite a wild ride, including a tiny little fender bender between two cars McNabb owns but wasn&apos;t driving. Of all the luck.

Now doesn&apos;t that pretty much sum up 2003 for McNabb?

During his day off, on his way to a charity event for kids, he gets into an accident, with himself no less, and comes out laughing about the whole thing. That&apos;s what he&apos;s always done. In his car, in the locker room, in the huddle, during practice, laughing that thunderous laugh that seems to gain volume on the inhale.&quot;See, I&apos;m the same old Donovan,&quot;he insists,&quot;the same guy I was when we were 0-2, the same guy smiling, working hard, trying anything to make a play -- I&apos;m the same guy.&quot;

Not really.

While talking to McNabb, his family, teammates and coaches for an upcoming profile in The Mag (where Donovan finally opens up a bit about this season and Rush Limbaugh), this is what I discovered: After a slow start, after numerous injuries, after calls for his benching and the circus surrounding Limbaugh&apos;s comments (so utterly ridiculous that to even bother disputing them here would lend them too much credit), after all that McNabb is most certainly not the same. Who could be? He has changed. He has grown. He has become a different person and at the same time a much better quarterback.

&quot;At first I reached a level of extreme disappointment with the Rush situation,&quot;says Donovan&apos;s father, Samuel McNabb, a retired electrical engineer.&quot;And then I reached a level of extreme pride in the way that Donovan handled the situation. This was a hurtful thing for me to see, not just as a father but as a man as well. I lived through this. But to have to watch my child go through this, in 2003, I thought we had gotten beyond all that. But how you handle adversity determines the true outcome of any situation. And no one will ever be able to question Donovan&apos;s character.&quot;

A few feet away from Samuel, Donovan is busy connecting with the kids, handing out gifts and posing for pictures. (Here&apos;s all you really need to know about McNabb: he doesn&apos;t rent his Santa suit -- he owns it.) Periodically father and son make eye contact and nod or smile. It&apos;s obvious that McNabb has leaned heavily on his father this season and if he seems a bit more, well, mature and magnanimous, that&apos;s all from Sam. It was through his father that McNabb seemed to understand the full scope and gravity behind Limbaugh&apos;s statements.

I know McNabb a little bit, having spent a week with him in Arizona while reporting a cover story for The Mag in 2001, and I told him recently that as I watched the Rush situation unfold more than anything he looked sad to me.&quot;Naw, when you say sad, it sounds like boo-hoo I&apos;m gonna start crying or something,&quot;he says, laughing.&quot;No no no, I&apos;m just messing with you. I don&apos;t know about sad. I wasn&apos;t sad as much as I felt betrayed and disrespected.&quot;

And, eventually, angry.

The McNabbs are still amazed that Rush is back on the air and as popular as ever. They wonder, still, if Donovan had continued to struggle, how many people would be thinking, or screaming into a mic, that Rush was right after all.

&quot;I hear he&apos;s making comments about me that maybe we can do a soup commercial together,&quot;says Donovan.&quot;So now I&apos;m the butt of his jokes again? Man, sometimes you just can&apos;t win.&quot;Adds Sam:&quot;Rush is a thing of the past and we hope we never see him again. What is he some kind of activist? Well, what is he activating? If he brings this up again, we don&apos;t know how we&apos;d respond. We hope we&apos;d be professional but we can&apos;t make any guarantees.&quot;

The only thing that seems certain anymore are the passes coming out of McNabb&apos;s healed hand. He&apos;s been on a tear the last two months -- call it &apos;Limball&apos;, back to the style that once prompted Deion Sanders to call him the&quot;prototype for the 21st century QB&quot;--leading the Eagles to eight wins in their last nine games, a third NFC East title and, perhaps, a third trip to the NFC title game. Meanwhile McNabb&apos;s teammates seem inspired by their leader&apos;s own selfless dignity.

Shoot, even McNabb&apos;s interceptions have been impressive. In a 25-16 win at Carolina on Nov. 30, fullback Jon Ritchie tipped McNabb&apos;s first pass right into the hands of safety Mike Minter. A former Raider, Ritchie is accustomed to getting cussed out with a finger in his facemask for such a transgression. McNabb, though, just patted him gently on top of the helmet and told him to&quot;let it go.&quot;On the very next series Ritchie hauled in a critical catch to keep the Eagles&apos; first scoring drive alive.&quot;I don&apos;t think you can underestimate the value of unity earned through hardship,&quot;says Ritchie.

That win put McNabb&apos;s name on the 2003 MVP ballot and placed the Eagles atop the race for home-field advantage in the playoffs.&quot;Things got so bad for a while that when I came home at night I expected my dogs to run into their kennels and hide,&quot;laughs McNabb.&quot;But they didn&apos;t. And I want to let them know I appreciate their support.&quot;

McNabb owns a boxer, Sinbad, and a rottweiler, Diego, who was named after the site of Super Bowl XXXVII. Of course, if his owner continues on his current pace, Diego might just be headed for a name change.

To Houston.

DONOVAN MCNABB
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback

Having a father with diabetes was bad enough, McNabb thought, but my brother, too? Sean? Sean, the older brother, the mentor, the role model? Sean, the one who was the basketball, football and track star in the McNabb family long before anyone was talking about Donovan?

It wasn&apos;t right. But instead of useless questions, McNabb did something about it. His Donovan McNabb Foundation has contributed to many causes, such as children&apos;s hospital programs, but fighting diabetes remains its driving force. Working closely with the American Diabetes Association, McNabb has sponsored kids to attend ADA youth camps, where they play sports and otherwise enjoy the summer camp experience of any healthy kid. McNabb visits the camps and gives a hands-on clinic in catching and throwing a ball. His support has been so significant that a camp in Pennsylvania now bears his name.

&quot;We stress to them the positive things,&quot;McNabb says.&quot;No matter how you look at it, you&apos;re still a kid. You want to live a normal life. You want to be disease-free. You want to play sports. You don&apos;t want to be reminded constantly that you&apos;re different.&quot;

Educating the public about diabetes and encouraging people to get tested remains the greatest focus, with the whole McNabb family getting into the act -- Sean, father Sam and mom Wilma, who runs the day-to-day operations. (Yes, she&apos;s the one who appears with her son in those homey Campbell&apos;s soup commercials.)

&quot;My mom was a nurse,&quot;McNabb says.&quot;She prepared us for being healthy. Now we spend our time reaching out to people with the same purpose in mind. We tell them it&apos;s important to know about yourself and the people around you, and to get tested. [Diabetes] affects a great deal of the African-American community. So when they see what my foundation is doing, they will say, &apos;Here&apos;s an African American who is trying to deal with this disease. Maybe this is something serious. Maybe I should get tested.&apos;&quot;

By MIKE FREEMAN
The Times-Union

LEHIGH, Pa. -- It was in Jacksonville where Donovan McNabb lost his postseason virginity. He was a sturdy, promising quarterback at Syracuse University who blew into town for the 1996 Gator Bowl with the gust of a strong thunder bumper. McNabb threw for one score and ran for another as Syracuse led Clemson 20-0 after just 15 minutes. They went on to 41-0 victory.
&quot;I still remember the Gator Bowl,&quot;he said.&quot;You never forget games like that. It was a bowl game, we won big, and I think a lot of people outside of Syracuse fans saw for the first time what I could do as a quarterback.&quot;

But as he is walking towards the Philadelphia Eagles complex after a recent hot summer practice, no longer the leader of a college team, but the captain of a franchise that has come to embody McNabb&apos;s blue collar work ethic and everyman persona, he is reminded that his blowout bowl bonanza that day eight years ago may not be his most memorable Jacksonville moment.

&quot;Oh, you&apos;re talking about that,&quot;he said.

Yes, that. Flash forward to October of 2002. McNabb is playing against the Jaguars at Alltel Stadium. The thick humidity is steambroiling the field and McNabb, who possessed a queasy stomach coming into the contest, began to feel like someone was karate-chopping his insides after just a few minutes of scrambling in the 90-degree heat. In the middle of calling one play, he leaned his head out of the huddle, and instead of tossing a touchdown pass, he tossed his lunch.

&quot;I remember it was hot that day,&quot;McNabb, chuckling, said in an interview with the Times-Union.&quot;Hopefully, this season I&apos;ll make it back to Jacksonville and it won&apos;t be as hot. I promise you this. If we get to the Super Bowl, there will be no throwing up again on national television.&quot;

If there was ever such a thing as a man on fire, it is McNabb. Three consecutive trips to the National Football Conference title game has left the star quarterback hungrier than ever, and following an offseason in which he worked harder than at any other point in his career, McNabb and the Eagles might be poised to take that final step that has been so elusive thus far.

In terms of McNabb himself, he is bearing the fruits of his grueling offseason regimen. Teammates believe that his accuracy has improved. His coach, Andy Reid, says McNabb&apos;s excellent conditioning could lead to him having his best season ever.

What does McNabb say? It would take a pair of vice grips to pull a self-promoting quote from the quarterback. But by dissecting a few choice words here and there, it is clear as a Terrell Owens touchdown dance that he is confident this is the Eagles&apos; year.

As the NFL begins its season-long trek that will come to a star-spangled hault at Alltel Stadium in February, two things are clear. One, there is probably no quarterback with as much pressure on his broad shoulders as McNabb. The window on an Eagles Super Bowl is closing rapidly and everyone in the organization can hear the clock ticking. As the leader, McNabb will bear the brunt of the always polite and understanding Philadelphia fans, known for their annual booing of Santa Claus, if he and the Eagles eventually fail in their quest to win a championship.

Second, it is a solid bet that McNabb will be making another appearance in Jacksonville, only instead of the Gator Bowl or a regular season NFL game, he would be playing in the biggest contest of all.

Why are the chances good this year for a Philadelphia story? While the Eagles lost running back Correll Buckhalter in the preseason to a torn patellar tendon, an injury that leaves the team dangerously thin at running back, the Eagle offense will still be one of the most potent in football.

&quot;Terrifying,&quot;is how McNabb puts it.&quot;We have the most weapons that the Eagles have had, at least in my era. We have big-time receivers. The kind of receivers that can feed off of each other and can make big plays. We have tight ends that can beat one-on-one coverage and possibly double teams. We have running backs that can make guys miss and pick up big yards.&quot;

The addition of Owens, dynamite on the field and explosive of the mouth, will provide Philadelphia with the ability to make defensive backs jittery. He is a pass-catching force the team has not had since Harold Carmichael dominated secondaries in the 1970s.

&quot;I think that is part of the reason they brought me here, just to kind of open it up a bit,&quot;Owens said.&quot;I know there will be opportunities where they are looking for me to get the ball. At the same time, defenses are going to double-team me and scheme against me. If I can take the top of a coverage off and allow some guys underneath to get open and allow them to operate on the outside to get open, that is a plus for the team.&quot;

Of course, McNabb remains the key, and has been the combustion engine during this current Eagles run, which has featured a wild ride of highs and lows few teams have endured in the modern era of the sport. While the franchise under McNabb has seen great success -- McNabb&apos;s .672 winning percentage leads the three other active quarterbacks with 60 or more starts (Brett Favre, Steve McNair and Brad Johnson are the others) -- it has also tasted the acid bitterness of getting oh-so-close.

It is losing the championship games that led McNabb to take his offseason workout program to another level. McNabb has long possessed one of the more consistent and rabid regimens of any player in football. Part of the reason is his mental makeup. He simply likes to be as prepared as possible, particularly physically. It is also no secret that McNabb has at times battled to keep his weight down.

McNabb felt strongly that he needed to do even more than normal in his already grueling workout routine. It was McNabb&apos;s way of acknowledging that to make that flight back to Jacksonville, McNabb, as a leader of the franchise, may have to work and fight harder than he ever has before.

&quot;I ramped things up this offseason because I want to make sure I&apos;m better than I have ever been,&quot;he said.&quot;Because if I&apos;m better, the team is better.&quot;

&quot;Every year, Donovan improves,&quot;said Buckhalter.&quot;But this year is special. The biggest difference I can see this year in him is where he is putting the football. He&apos;s putting it in better places for the receivers and backs. He&apos;s been making some great passes. His accuracy has improved to the point where I think he might be one of the most accurate quarterbacks in the league.&quot;

McNabb is an unlikely Philly hero. After all, when the Eagles selected him second overall in the 1999 draft, the pick was roundly booed by an army of Eagles fans. Since then, McNabb has won them over by winning and producing, earning a 41-17 record since becoming a starter in 2000. He is also one of just 18 players in NFL history to both throw for over 10,000 passing yards (13,051) and rush for over 2,000 yards (2,239).

McNabb&apos;s routine in the NFL&apos;s off months has become legendary. What did you do on your summer vacation? Go to the beach? McNabb made his yearly journey to Arizona where he spends months refining his body and burning off the pounds. McNabb&apos;s routine is reminiscent of the one wide receiver Jerry Rice has utilized for so many years.

part 2

His workouts in Arizona usually started around 8 a.m. with a long run, maybe six miles or more. That was followed by a several hours of agility drills and speed work, often on the track. McNabb would then drive to a nearby facility and lift weights for two hours.

&quot;To top off the morning, us bigger guys have to visit the steam room to get that excess weight off,&quot;he laughed. The steam room would be followed by drills in the pool.

Then comes lunch.

McNabb usually broke up the workout with a midday trip home around 2:15 p.m. to visit with his wife, college sweetheart Raquel Nurse, and watch a little television.

By 4:30 he was on the basketball court for several hours (with the Eagles praying a jumpshot doesn&apos;t lead to a twisted ankle).

McNabb was home usually at 7. To relax, he often caught a movie before heading to bed, and waking up to repeat the entire day all over again. His so-called day off was Wednesdays, when he restricted his workout to light weighlifting.

&quot;The biggest difference between what I did this offseason and in the past,&quot;McNabb said,&quot;was I worked out longer and I worked out with more intensity.&quot;

McNabb also changed his diet. He thought his eating habits needed adjustment so he went on a highly restrictive program designed by a dietician in Arizona. McNabb said other players, including former Miami Dolphin Ricky Williams, have used it successfully to boost their energy levels and lose body fat.

(After being reminded that Williams flunked several drug tests for marijuana, McNabb was jokingly asked if it was called the pot diet.&quot;No, it&apos;s not that kind of diet,&quot;he laughed.&quot;If you were on that kind of diet you wouldn&apos;t want to work out.&quot;)

While McNabb did not go into great detail about what the diet entailed, he explained that its basic premise consists of sticking to a list of foods he can and cannot eat. It is normally a 12-week plan but McNabb was on it for more than 18. Suffice it to say that all of the good stuff is on the no-no side of the list.&quot;No more candy bars,&quot;he said.

While McNabb may have missed his sugar fix, he says it was worth it. McNabb feels better physically than he has in years.

&quot;My energy level is high,&quot;he said.&quot;I don&apos;t feel as sore in the morning after a tough practice.&quot;

While McNabb has absolute control over his body, he does not have such control over the Eagles&apos; roster. The personnel landscape has changed on the team. The Eagles have risen to one of the premier franchises in the NFL because they have relied heavily on the draft, treated the salary cap with respect, and resisted the temptation of signing aging, big-name free agents that often turn out to be expensive busts.

The team&apos;s strategy changed slightly after last season&apos;s disappointing loss in the conference championship game to Carolina. The franchise signed Pro Bowl pass-rusher Jevon Kearse, who has fought injuries for much of his career, and Owens, to big free-agent bucks. Kearse receives $20 million in guaranteed money over the first three years of the contract, while Owens receives $10.1 million in his first two.

Thus now, instead of being the sole superstar for so long, there are other players that attract the autograph crowd in Philadelphia. This was evident during one of the team&apos;s training camps when tens of thousands of fans showed up one day for a single practice. Eagles officials said it was the largest fan turnout for a training camp day in Eagles history.

So how does McNabb feel about sharing the spotlight?

&quot;I&apos;m never a guy that wants to step on a stage and stick my chest out,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I don&apos;t particularly care about that. People recognize you by first the things you do on the field, and then they recognize you by your face. I always believe in first impressions. I want people, when they get to meet me and know me, to know that I&apos;m just an ordinary person, like them. I care about that sort of thing more than I do about accolades.&quot;

One day late in the Eagles&apos; camp, McNabb was standing on the sideline, chatting with Owens, while the special teams unit was on the field, practicing punt returns. McNabb was so busy talking he failed to notice that one player had been hit hard while running down the field and was knocked in McNabb&apos;s direction.

Owens did see the potential collision, and the end of the season flashed before his eyes. He leaped in the path of the out-of-control player, grabbed McNabb by the shoulder pads, shielded him, and then shoved McNabb out of the way.

&quot;Got to protect No. 5!&quot;said Owens after the close call.

McNabb is on such a mission, it might be the rest of the NFL that needs protection from him.

Thanks for that Destiny - what a great article. (I&apos;ve been off-the-wagon lately in hunting for Donovan articles...I cringe at all the articles I&apos;ve missed! I&apos;m glad you&apos;re holding down that fort. It can get hard trying to keep up with the vast Google output of Donovan articles, especially as the season starts. It gets crazy...)

I especially liked the detailing of his workout/diet regimen - good stuff! Wow that&apos;s alot of exercise he did...whew! Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by destiny5 on Sept 6, 2004, 2:17pm

 its a very nice article. finally we get to read a little bit more about his offseason. i think its weird to read that he also watches tv like everybody else does. i wonder what he is watching 

he works hard in the offseason with the diet and all that stuff. but girls lets be honest.... donovan really needed to lose some weight. he looks much better now than he looked in january. at least thats what i think. Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by georgiaeagle on Sept 11, 2004, 12:30am

ITA that he looks better now than he looked in, say, April. I never got the impression that Donovan was that strict about his diet but I guess that&apos;s changing now. Either T.O. has rubbed off on him, or he realizes more than ever that he has to fight his body&apos;s natural tendencies - especially if he wants to get to&quot;football low&quot;bodyfat.

I know at one point, Donovan admitted to being addicted to&quot;Playmakers&quot;. (I liked that show, myself.) From what I&apos;ve read about his t.v. viewing habits, he seems to watch alot of ESPN - sports, and things like that. Re: Archived Donovan articles

McNabb&apos;s dream come true? He&apos;s very close

January 24, 2005

PHILADELPHIA -- Sam and Wilma McNabb&apos;s son has wanted this for a long time.

He wanted it as a boy in the south suburb of Dolton, night after night in his bedroom with the Sports Illustrated covers taped to the walls.

He has wanted this since his teen years at Mt. Carmel, particularly after a schoolmate, Antoine Walker, went on to win an NCAA basketball title with Kentucky and another, Simeon Rice, won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

He wanted it as a young man playing at Soldier Field in a 1995 prep all-star game.

He wanted it since returning there as a grown man on Jan. 19, 2002, to score Soldier Field&apos;s last touchdown before the place was closed for remodeling.

He wanted it since being on Sports Illustrated&apos;s cover himself in January 2004 after a Philadelphia playoff game.

And now, at 28, Donovan Jamal McNabb finally has it.

Well, almost.

A trip to the Super Bowl is his at last. McNabb quarterbacked the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons 27-10 in the NFC title game here Sunday.

He caressed the conference&apos;s George S. Halas Trophy after the game at Lincoln Financial Field and vowed to the home crowd,&quot;We&apos;ll bring home something else!&quot;

That&apos;s the last goal, the holy grail, crown jewel.

Relieved to get to the big game?

&quot;There&apos;s no relief for me,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I&apos;ll have relief after the Super Bowl.&quot;

Not even a little relief now?

&quot;We&apos;re not done,&quot;he said.

Philadelphia&apos;s fans took the liberty of showering him with brotherly love anyway. They wore green No. 5 jerseys like his and chanted his name with frozen breath as McNabb took a knee on three consecutive snaps to end the game.

One fan held a sign: Red Sox, Mickelson, It&apos;s Our Turn.

The Eagles&apos; turn, he meant, to win a Super Bowl for the first time. As well as McNabb&apos;s turn to get in lineperhaps go to the front of itwith Norm Van Brocklin, Sonny Jurgensen, Ron Jaworski and Randall Cunningham, the great Philly quarterbacks.

Everything is going the Eagles&apos; way so far, McNabb said, and&quot;there&apos;s no reason for it to stop now.&quot;

If it looked on TV as if McNabb was pretty choked up about the whole thing, he denied it.

&quot;I didn&apos;t get choked up,&quot;he said.&quot;I didn&apos;t cry or anything.&quot;

What he mainly felt was satisfaction, if not vindication. In recent years and even weeks, McNabb said:&quot;A lot of people turned their backs on us. They just didn&apos;t have the confidence that we would be able to do it. I think we answered a lot of questions. I think we answered a lot of critics. So maybe people will be happy about the Philadelphia Eagles again. Maybe not.&quot;

He has a Chicago connection in an organization that has had many.

Philadelphia&apos;s first Sunday foe in the NFL was the Bears, back in 1933. (A 3-3 tie.) The first Eagle in an NFL draft was the University of Chicago&apos;s Jay Berwanger. The first time for the Eagles in an NFL title game was 1947 at Comiskey Park against the Chicago Cardinals.

So to have a Halas trophy end up in McNabb&apos;s hands was apt. He married his wife, Raquel, two years ago in Chicago. His mom makes TV soup commercials with him. Philly is his home team, but Chicago is his home.

Asked if his mother had any words of advice before the game, McNabb said yes, short and snappy:&quot;She just said, &apos;Just win.&quot;&apos;

He did. Finally, after going 0-for-3 in NFC title games.

Sleevelessly defying the cold, McNabb played nearly flawless football: no interceptions, two touchdown passes, a 111.1 passer rating.

&quot;We came in with the attitude we go out there, score on the first drive, on every opportunity we come out with points and this game is over,&quot;McNabb said.

&quot;That&apos;s just the confidence we have in each other. We went out, sustained a drive, came out with three points when we should have had seven. The next opportunity, we should have had seven again, but we got another three. We left a lot of points out there on the field, or this game could really have been opened up wide.&quot;

It was close at halftime, but the end result was 27-10 the exact score of the Eagles&apos; loss to the Oakland Raiders in their only Super Bowl appearance 25 years ago Tuesday.

McNabb has waited for this a long time, a Super Bowl shot, and now he has it. He wanted it. He went out and got it.

&quot;It definitely was everything I thought it would be,&quot;he said.

All he wants now is one thing more.

McNabb finally quiets skeptics

Jan 24, 2005

PHILADELPHIA -- They booed him on draft day when his name was called instead of Ricky Williams.

He was called overrated by noted football expert Rush Limbaugh, who accused the liberal media of coddling him because they wanted to see a black quarterback.

He got his team to the NFC Championship Game the previous three years, but left the field a loser all three times, making people wonder if his career would be defined by those failures.

Yesterday, on a frozen field in a biting wind on a national stage, Donovan McNabb bid adieu to any remaining skeptics.

McNabb is playing for a Super Bowl.

Philadelphia&apos;s sixth-year quarterback released tortured Eagles&apos; fans from their decades-long agony by leading his team to a 27-10 win over Michael Vick&apos;s Falcons at frigid Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles are going to the Super Bowl for the first time since January 1981, when thingy Vermeil led Philadelphia to its only previous Super Bowl berth. The Eagles lost that one to Oakland by the same score Philly beat Atlanta.

&quot;We know what happened in the last three years; this close and never being able to pull it out,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;But this year was something special. Everything that&apos;s happened so far has been a special feeling, and there&apos;s no reason for it to stop now.&quot;

The Patriots might have a thing or two to say about that, but that&apos;s a story for two weeks from now. In the meantime, we pay tribute to a quarterback whose elite status is now unquestioned: Six years, four conference championship game appearances, and now a Super Bowl run.

McNabb outdid Vick at every turn. He threw better. Ran more effectively. Managed the game more efficiently. Vick might turn out to be the next great quarterback, but McNabb is already there.

Yesterday, without the injured Terrell Owens, McNabb sprayed the ball around to eight different receivers, going 17-of-26 for 180 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions in conditions entirely ill suited to the passing game. The winds whipped upwards of 35 miles per hour. The temperature was 17 degrees at game time, but closer to zero by the second half.

&quot;I think we answered a lot of questions,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I think we answered a lot of critics, so maybe people will be happy about the Philadelphia Eagles again, maybe not.&quot;

McNabb might get his favorite target back for the Big Show in Jacksonville. Owens, who suffered a sprained ankle and broken fibula in a game against Dallas last month, vows to be back for Super Bowl XXXIX.

But maybe it was better that Owens wasn&apos;t around for this one. Maybe it made McNabb&apos;s accomplishment even more meaningful. He had to rely on a more balanced offense, although having shifty running back Brian Westbrook certainly helped. Westbrook&apos;s 96-yard rushing effort allowed the play-action pass to be more effective, and his team-leading five catches for 39 yards made the short passing game a viable option.

Vick was bottled up by the Eagles&apos; brilliant defense, which limited him to just 26 yards on four scrambles, but McNabb proved more elusive, rushing for 32 yards. One particular scramble midway through the second quarter helped change the game. On third-and-11 from the Eagles&apos; 38, McNabb drifted back to pass. Finding no receiver open, he stepped up in the pocket, and then dodged two Falcons&apos; defenders while scrambling to his right. At the last moment, he spotted Freddie Mitchell near the right sideline. McNabb delivered a 13-yard strike for the first down.

On the next play, he completed a 45-yard pass to Greg Lewis down the left side. Two plays after that, he spotted tight end Chad Lewis in the right corner of the end zone for a three-yard touchdown pass to give the Eagles a 14-3 lead.

&quot;Well, I got out of the pocket, so I gave some people a smile on their faces to let them know I&apos;m running again,&quot;McNabb said of his effective scrambling.&quot;You just have to do whatever it takes to win the game.&quot;

McNabb won it with a signature performance and then got to bask in the postgame celebration. He knows the journey is not complete.

McNabb said:&quot;I think everyone in the Philadelphia area is excited . . . but there&apos;s no relief for me. I&apos;ll have relief after the Super Bowl. We&apos;re going to enjoy it while the time is here, then focus in on what we need to do to win the Super Bowl.&quot;

Only then can there be complete vindication for McNabb.

Beat Bill Belichick, and the legacy will be complete.

from the syracuse university magazine

It wasnt exactly the welcome Donovan McNabb had anticipated. After all, how often is the second pick in the National Football League player draft greeted with a chorus of thunderous boos? Though stung by the rude reception from Philadelphia Eagles fans at those draft-day festivities in New York City five springs ago, McNabb maintained his composure. The former Syracuse University quarterback and three-time Big East Offensive Player of the Year had always been unflappable and resilient. He figured, in time, he would turn the jeers into cheers and earn his share of affection from fans in the City of Brotherly Love. The Eagles would not regret selecting him over the peoples choicerunning back Ricky Williams from the University of Texas. He was certain of that. The fans reaction kind of blind-sided me at first, McNabb says. I hadnt even taken a snap and they were on me. So, yeah, it stuns you. But you learn from playing quarterback that there are times when you are going to get knocked down. The key is to get up and turn a negative into a positive.&lt;br&gt;
McNabb has spent a lifetime doing thaton and off the field. Since becoming Philadelphias starting quarterback before the 2000 NFL season, he has earned four consecutive invitations to the Pro Bowl and guided the Eagles to three straight NFC championship games. He has endeared himself to the Philly faithful with his Houdini-like daring and Rocky-like grit. Eagles fans wont soon forget his magical 4th-and-26 conversion to help win a playoff game last season, or the four touchdown passes he threw while playing an entire half on a fractured leg.

His work away from the gridiron has been every bit as impressive. Through his Donovan McNabb Foundation, the former Orange football and basketball standout has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in search of a cure for diabetes, which afflicts his father, Samuel McNabb. The younger McNabb also has played Santa Claus at a community center at Temple University and hosted youth football camps in Philadelphia and Chicago.

The player who has been immortalized with his own bobblehead doll and has starred in those popular Chunky soup commercials with his mom has remained true to his schools. He established the Donovan McNabb Golden Arm Scholarship Program at his high school alma mater, Mt. Carmel, in suburban Chicago. Two years ago, he donated $150,000 to refurbish the football locker rooms at SU and currently is serving as a member of the Universitys Board of Trustees. Being named to the board was a tremendous honor, says McNabb, who turned 28 in November. Syracuse played a huge role in shaping me and making me the person I am today. This is a way of paying the school back.&lt;br&gt;
Though he holds Orange records for most touchdown passes (77) and total yards (9,950) in a career, he is equally proud to have been part of a football team that had a 100 percent graduation rate, the best in the nation. Thats one of the messages I want to continue to get across to the members of our athletic programs, says McNabb, who holds a bachelors degree in speech communication from the College of Visual and Performing Arts. Very few of them are going to be as lucky as several of us have been and play professionally. Thats why I believe its so important to have a career you can fall back on.&lt;br&gt;
A recent Harris poll placed McNabb among the 10 most popular athletes in America, joining the likes of cyclist Lance Armstrong, golfer Tiger Woods, and New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter. But dont expect fame to inflate McNabbs head. My mom and dad keep me grounded, he says, chuckling. Theyll make sure I dont need a bigger helmet.&lt;br&gt;
Several years ago, NBA great Charles Barkley created a stir when he proclaimed that professional athletes arent role models. McNabb takes a contrary view. My dad told me that as I progressed in sports and started receiving increased recognition, more and more kids would look up to me and emulate everything I did, on and off the field, McNabb says. He said, whether I liked it or not, I would become a role model and it was up to me to decide which kind of role model I would be.&lt;br&gt;
From all indications, Donovan McNabb has become the kind of role model who can turn even the harshest critics into fans. He is someone worthy of following in football and in life.

ON THE SLY

November 19, 2004

Don&apos;t think for a minute that you&apos;ve heard the last of the towel-gate episode involving Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens and a seemingly naked Nicollette Sheridan in the skit preceding the Monday night game on ABC.

Although the Eagles and ABC apologized for showing it before the Eagles went into lockdown and refused to talk about it, sources say the team&apos;s public relations staff liked it the first time they saw it.

They even explained the logistics of how the skit was created, with Owens spending 2 1/2 hours Friday night learning his lines and ABC flying Sheridan to Philadelphia for the shoot.

Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb said he&apos;s married, and his wife wouldn&apos;t let him be involved in anything so racy.

And he joked about the skit.

&quot;I think football is a sexy sport,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I&apos;m pretty sexy.&quot;

 McNabb hopes to follow Williams&apos; footsteps

McNabb hopes to follow Williams&apos; footsteps

By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
February 3, 2005

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Seventeen years ago, the Super Bowl took on new meaning for Donovan McNabb.

He was 11 years old, watching Doug Williams lead the Washington Redskins to a rout over the Denver Broncos. For the first time, McNabb realized how far he could go.

Williams became the first black quarterback to win an NFL title in 1988. McNabb gets his chance Sunday when the Philadelphia Eagles star takes on the New England Patriots.

And he remains grateful to Williams.

``I visualized me being in his shoes, and it&apos;s a reality now,&apos;&apos; McNabb said. ``I&apos;m just looking forward to the challenge of getting on that football field. If I can do some of the things he did in that particular game, I&apos;ll be excited as well.&apos;&apos;

The climate for black quarterbacks has improved dramatically since Williams entered the league in 1978 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, leading them to their first playoff appearance a year later.

There are established black quarterbacks throughout the league. Three of them -- McNabb, Michael Vick of the Atlanta Falcons and Daunte Culpepper of the Minnesota -- led their teams to the playoffs and were voted to the Pro Bowl this season.

And for the first time, two black QBs -- McNabb and Vick -- met in a conference championship game, ensuring one would reach the Super Bowl.

Williams couldn&apos;t help but notice that with three quarterbacks on each team, half of them are black in this Super Bowl. Rohan Davey is the backup for New England, and Jeff Black is the No. 3 quarterback for Philadelphia.

``That&apos;s where the progress is being made,&apos;&apos; Williams said. ``I think that&apos;s where we have to continue, where if a kid is not good enough to be your starter right now, he has an opportunity to improve and maybe one day be the starter.

``When we get to the point where with 96 quarterbacks in this league, and there are at least 25 (blacks), we will have come a long way then.&apos;&apos;

McNabb has answered questions all week about what it means to be just the third black quarterback to lead his team to the Super Bowl. Tennessee&apos;s Steve McNair is the other, reaching the title game five years ago before losing to the St. Louis Rams.

When he takes the field Sunday night and tries to join Williams in the record books, McNabb said other pioneers like Marlin Briscoe, James Harris and Warren Moon will be in the back of his mind.

``It&apos;s a special feeling not only for myself, but for all of the other African-American quarterbacks that are in the NFL, as well as playing on the collegiate level, to know that this could happen to you,&apos;&apos; he said.

McNabb can&apos;t imagine the kind of pressure Williams faced when he led the Redskins to the Super Bowl and was barraged in the days leading up to the game with inane questions like: ``How long have you been a black quarterback?&apos;&apos;

Williams is glad McNabb&apos;s race has not been as big an issue this week.

``I came along when the story wasn&apos;t about the two teams that was in the Super Bowl, as far as what they&apos;ve done during the season,&apos;&apos; Williams said. ``It was more or less about one man, and the color of his skin. I think we&apos;ve gotten away from that. It&apos;s easy to see what race he is. We all know the history. But the most important thing this weekend is the two teams. You&apos;re talking about two of the best teams in the league.

``The Eagles were picked long before the season started to be the team to represent the NFC in this game, and they did not start off with the fact that Donovan McNabb was black. He&apos;s the quarterback of the Philadelphia Eagles.&apos;&apos;

NEW YORK, Jan. 27, 2005

Not Just Donovan McNabb&apos;s Mom

&quot;They call me chunky mom,&quot;Wilma McNabb says.

That is how the mother of Philadelphia Eagles quaterback Donovan McNabb is addressed on the street by fans who recognize her from the Campbell Soup commercials she did with her son.

&quot;They do a lot of that: I better not be close to another fast food restaurant. They say, &apos;That&apos;s not Chunky Soup,&apos;&quot;Mrs. McNabb jokes to The Early Show co-anchor Harry Smith.

Four years ago, an actress played the part of her son&apos;s mother on the commercial.

That only lasted one season, partly a result of Mrs. McNabb lobbying Campbell&apos;s Soup, through the Professional Football Players Mothers Association (she is the vice president), to keep it real.

&quot;People always thought those were the real moms, but it wasn&apos;t. So we&apos;re just really happy they&apos;re using real moms,&quot;McNabb says.

&quot;We went to the taping of the first two Donovan had with the actress and I had seen the script already,&quot;Wilma McNabb says,&quot;I knew the script and I&apos;m pantomiming while she&apos;s doing her thing. And I said, &apos;I can do that.&apos; And I kept saying, &apos;I can do that,&apos; and I talked to the producers of the advertising agency, and I said: &apos;No, really; we could do that; why don&apos;t you use the real moms.&apos; So the next year, they decided let&apos;s give it a try.&quot;

So now, Gladys Bettis, mother of Pittsburgh Steeler Jerome; Louise Strahan, whose son is the New York Giants&apos; Michael; and Kathy Lynch, mother of Denver&apos;s John (formerly of Tampa Bay), also star in soup commercials with their sons.

McNabb is convinced reality has a better effect. By the way, she&apos;s better known to her friends by her middle name, Charlene. Her pal Linda Harrison, mother of Indianapolis Colts&apos; receiver Marvin Harrison, calls her&quot;Star Char.&quot;

In real life as well, McNabb likes to help feed her son and his Philadelphia Eagles teammates.

&quot;Every time they come to Chicago, I have to make sure my team eats, and they eat really a lot,&quot;she says.&quot;We have to have a lot. It&apos;s expected. So I have no other choice, but to feed my team.&quot;

Before the Eagles beat the Bears in Chicago this past October, many of them feasted on macaroni and cheese, red beans and rice, greens and sweet potato pie - much of it homemade by McNabb and delivered to the team&apos;s hotel.

&quot;Donovan loves the red beans and rice,&quot;she says,&quot;And macaroni and cheese is his favorite.&quot;

Asked if she knew when he was a little boy that he was going to become a super star, she says,&quot;Not at all. You just want your children to grow up to be successful college graduates and go on to make their own way in life. But he chose sports and that was a good thing. It kept him busy and kept him focused and in his books. That was the means kind of thing. So, No, I didn&apos;t expect that until we started seeing it coming out of Syracuse.&quot;

Now, McNabb, who used to work as a pediatric nurse, runs the Donovan McNabb Foundation in suburban Chicago and oversees her son&apos;s business along with her husband, Sam McNabb. Her business is Donovan&apos;s business. It&apos;s become her second career. And the multimillionaire NFL quarterback is about to play in his first Super Bowl.

&quot;It seems that it was a long time,&quot;McNabb says.&quot;But when you think about it it wasn&apos;t really that long and that&apos;s the way it happened. Now we&apos;re really ready for it.&quot;

No Chunky Soup ever tasted better than after earning a Super Bowl berth following three straight losses at home in the NFC Championship Game. The Eagles were beaten by Carolina last year (after the 2003 season, 14-3); by Tampa Bay in 2003 (after the 2002 season, 27-10) and by St. Louis in 2002 (after the 2001 season, 29-24).

If you watched last Sunday&apos;s NFC Championship Game, you might have caught a glimpse of a very excited McNabb in Philadelphia.&quot;It was on Sunday a big sense of relief, a big sense of relief,&quot;she says.

The Philadelphia Eagles beat the Atlanta Falcons, 27-10. Now, McNabb is getting ready to head to Jacksonville, Fla., to watch her favorite team play in Super Bowl XXXIX.

Parents provide McNabb&apos;s recipe for success
By Reid Cherner, USA TODAY

PHILADELPHIA According to Sam McNabb, when his wife sees something her son does that she doesn&apos;t like, she&apos;s quick to say it. He pauses and grins.&quot;Then she&apos;ll tell me to let him know it.&quot;

Yet last week Wilma McNabb went right to the source, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, and let him know she was ready to go to a Super Bowl.

&quot;He said, &apos;You&apos;re annoying me,&apos;&quot;says Wilma McNabb, whose face is well known as Campbell&apos;s Chunky Soup mom.&quot;I told him I couldn&apos;t take another NFC championship loss. I just can&apos;t take it. I asked him if I could come and speak to the locker room.

&quot;That was one of those annoying things for him. I don&apos;t want to hurt anybody&apos;s feelings, but sometimes those feelings need to be hurt.&quot;

The Eagles offensive line is charged with protecting its quarterback on the field, and he is full of praise for the guys up front, but Sam and Wilma McNabb clearly have always had his back.

In the Eagles media guide, the quarterback says his parents are&quot;my biggest fans and also my No. 1 critics.&quot;

Talking with the parents bears that out. The McNabbs, who wear their No. 5 Eagles jerseys as they cheer on the team, burst with pride over their son&apos;s accomplishments but expected no less. Sometimes they expected more.

&quot;When he doesn&apos;t do something right, we&apos;re the first ones to tell him,&quot;Sam says.&quot;So much so that sometimes he is ready to put us on a plane and send us back home (to Chicago). We believe in keeping it real.&quot;

After the Eagles defeated the Atlanta Falcons 27-10 Sunday in the NFC Championship Game, Philly&apos;s quarterback said he got terse instructions from his mother before the game.&quot;She said, &apos;Just win.&apos;&quot;

&quot;Obviously we&apos;re close, a tightknit bunch,&quot;he says.&quot;They&apos;re very supportive in everything I&apos;ve been able to do, athletically or anything in life. They&apos;re always there for me, and they continue to keep me humble and keep my head on straight.&quot;

Friends marvel at what the McNabbs have accomplished.

&quot;It is amazing to see how a couple can stick to doing the right things and see how that close unit comes together,&quot;says Tami White, an assistant to Wilma but friends with the McNabbs since she worked with Sam when he was an electrical engineer with the power company in Chicago.&quot;It really helps you to understand what life, family and love is all about.&quot;

&apos;Char the star&apos;

Wilma, 48, a former registered nurse, is executive director of the Donovan McNabb Foundation and vice president of the Professional Football Players Mothers&apos; Association. Sam, 50, is the founder and president of the National Football Player&apos;s Fathers Association.

&quot;They are validation that family is essential to a child succeeding,&quot;White says.&quot;This is the most powerful group of people I have ever known. ... I can&apos;t say enough for what they have done to gain respect for African-American families. Everything coming their way they deserve.&quot;

It was Wilma&apos;s closeness to her son that led to television stardom. The first Campbell&apos;s Soup commercials with the Eagles superstar had an actress playing his mom.

Wilma, known as&quot;Char&quot;to friends (short for her middle name, Charlene), had a different casting suggestion.&quot;I knew the lines because I had previously seen the script. I said I could do that. I just kept begging.&quot;

She was told they didn&apos;t have time to train anyone, a red flag to her bullish personality.

&quot;I said I was able, I was confident. So the next year they decided to use real moms.&quot;

Wilma was joined by Gladys Bettis, Louise Strahan and Lavoyda Urlacher, mothers of Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis, New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan and Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher.

&quot;They call me &apos;Char the Star,&apos;&quot;she says of the ribbing she gets from friends.&quot;I was talking to Brenda Vick (mother of Atlanta quarterback Michael Vick) the other day, and she said, &apos;I just love your commercials. I just laugh.&apos; I said, &apos;I am just clearing the way for you.&apos;&quot;

When she learned Vick&apos;s mom was hesitant to get in front of the camera, Wilma said,&quot;&apos;So I can have yours?&apos; And she said, &apos;You can have mine.&apos;&quot;

White thinks her friend deserves her own show.&quot;She is complete sitcom material,&quot;White says.&quot;Somebody who can do more besides soup. I hope somebody recognizes that.&quot;

In truth, Wilma McNabb never really wanted to be an actress.

She wanted to be a singer.

&quot;Well, I always thought I could sing,&quot;she says.&quot;And I was always telling Donovan, &apos;Please let me do a video.&apos; You know, Milli Vanilli sounded like they could sing, so I would like to make a video. And for Christmas I got a karaoke machine.&quot;

That is when the truth became evident.

&quot;I found out I can&apos;t do it too good,&quot;she says.&quot;Maybe if I got some voice lessons or something.&quot;

Her husband, who rarely misses the chance to give his wife the needle, makes it clear the limelight has not blinded him.&quot;That is my claim to fame I&apos;m still a regular guy,&quot;he says.&quot;I can let them (son and wife) know that I can critique them, I can harass them as much as I can. But once the commercials and games are over, it&apos;s still house rules and all the other things apply.&quot;

But he will break down and admit his wife is pretty good on television and the commercial version is close to real life.

&quot;I get tickled by her acting and how she handles it,&quot;he says.&quot;I could see her in movies or something like that. Some people act, and some people act normal. She acts normal. What you see her say and do is what she would probably say or do. That is what makes the commercials so real.&quot;

Consequently, the camera at games will focus on Wilma and not Sam. The upside is he is able to roam around airports unnoticed while they&quot;are trying to find a fake nose and glasses&quot;for his wife.

His wife will not always own up.&quot;They will say, &apos;Are you Donovan&apos;s mother?&apos; and I&apos;ll say, &apos;Sometimes.&apos; If he did something bad that day, I wouldn&apos;t be his mother.&quot;

Serving soup has been a sidelight for Wilma for just a few years but she has been feeding her son&apos;s teammates since he was a quarterback at Syracuse. She now feeds the Eagles in Philadelphia and when they come to Chicago. This is cause for a little sitcom routine among the McNabbs.

&quot;Every year that Donovan has been in the league, we do an offensive dinner,&quot;Wilma says.

Sam adds,&quot;Not one that offends people but one for the offensive team.&quot;

She narrows her eyes and dryly replies:&quot;Oh, I get it.&quot;

He chuckles as she finishes the story.&quot;We feed them every year,&quot;she says.&quot;They get to bring families because we are a family. I take care of the linemen all the time.&quot;

Parents supplied the drive

The McNabbs are as self-deprecating about their talents as they are serious about what they want to accomplish.

Sam says the fathers association is about&quot;providing a male role model to show that we are as involved in our children&apos;s lives as anyone else.&quot;

Wilma hopes the mothers association can help put their sons&quot;in a good image&quot;while the foundation raises awareness of diabetes Donovan&apos;s grandmother died of diabetes-related complications, and his father has Type 2 diabetes as well as donating money to her son&apos;s alma maters of Syracuse and Mount Carmel High in Chicago.

&quot;We are now preparing for life after football,&quot;she says.&quot;Because the NFL can mean &apos;Not For Long,&apos; you always have to be prepared.&quot;

As the McNabbs are when the spotlight is less than an enviable place to be. They have instilled in their son the character to withstand Eagles fans booing him, as happened with his selection as the No. 2 pick in the 1999 draft, or when they question his ability.

&quot;I am more proud of what he does off the field,&quot;his dad says.&quot;We are most proud of him that he is well-grounded and understands the humbleness and humility that it takes to get from point A to point B.&quot;

That was never more apparent than when ESPN&apos;s Rush Limbaugh said last season that the quarterback was overrated and was being lauded because he was black.

&quot;The way he handled that made me think he was ready for adulthood,&quot;Sam McNabb says.&quot;He was challenged from the aspect of his ability. He was challenged from the aspect of being a man and how he would handle things for the rest of his life.&quot;

Likewise, the son credits his parents with supplying the drive that got him to the top of the NFL.&quot;My parents always told me you have to outwork the person next to you,&quot;he says.&quot;If you always feel that you&apos;re the best at what you do with your work ethic, there&apos;s someone out there working harder than you.&quot;

He sometimes might surprise his parents with the strength of his personality, but they say they are not surprised by the way he turned out.

They believe that living in a house with two parents and his older brother, Sean, allowed him to develop at the proper pace.

&quot;He was never forced to be the man in the household,&quot;Sam says.&quot;He was able to grow up as a child in the household and understand the important qualities growing up, the importance of being a young man.

&quot;Because he had the leadership and role models in his house ... and with the instructions that he was receiving, it was fairly obvious he knew what his responsibilities were and the things that were expected.&quot;

Next task: Spoil the grandchild

Wilma and Sam McNabb are preparing for the third phase of parenting.
Their youngest son, Donovan, might not be as ready.

&quot;We&apos;re in the phase with him of being a counselor,&quot;Sam says.&quot;Before, we were the intimidators.&quot;

The newest phase: interferring with the grandchild.

Donovan McNabb and his wife, Raquel, have a 4-month-old daughter, Alexis, Sam and Wilma&apos;s first grandchild. The elder McNabbs look forward to giving her everything they denied Donovan.

They had exacting standards for their children but plan no such rules for their grandchild.

&quot;My job is to spoil them and then go home,&quot;Wilma says.&quot;Now it&apos;s fun time, and you don&apos;t have to worry about it.&quot;

Her husband boils down being a grandfather to one statement:&quot;What do you want, honey? You name it, and I&apos;ll get it for you.&quot;

And when his son and daughter-in-law object?

Post by karamel850 on Feb 12, 2005, 5:19pm




hey, whats up guys

this is very interesting post from the eddie george site. you would believe it:

i&apos;m new to the group. i&apos;m a huge McNabb fan!!! I live in Jacksonville, Florida and of course the Eagles are here for the Super Bowl. I do not find it hard at all to believe that McNabb has a lot of women. And there are confirmed reports about him having a connection in Phoenix as well as with a LOT of WOMEN a LOT of Them. Yet, i&apos;m very disturbed to even think he could as someone said&quot;play for both sides&quot;. Roxi is not a beauty queen by any means but she must have a beautiful spirit to attract him.

I almost feel sorry for Roxi because she has a lot to deal with. Life as an NFL wife is not all glamour. For the most part women will totally ignore her or even run over her trying to get to him. McNabb is calm, kind, warm hearted, somewhat private you know a Real Gentle Giant. yet its always the quiet type that will shock you with what they will do behind closed doors. I cannot say he&apos;s a bi man. My source who worked out with him in phoenix at McPlays.com says Donovan has a lot of women.

Roxi quitting her job and trying to travel with him will serve its purpose. nevertheless if a man wants to step he will do it. if she is not able to accept the reality that life in the NFL includes her husband having all the P-U-S-S-I in the universe thrown at him willingly then Roxi i&apos;m afraid is well on her way to being known as wife number one..........

lets hope she&apos;s strong and has a high tolerence for the bizaar, wild, disrespectful often repugnant behavior of NFL hoes galore throughout Donovan&apos;s entire career. There are so many VIP parties in Jacksonville this week it would blow anyone AWAY. Every celebrity from tv, film, sports, and music is here throwing parties at ridiculous prices. Superfest downtown is free. Its alot like MardiGras. The clubs and hotel parties have blanketed the 841 square mile infrastructure of the city. And of course the private parties on secluded islands off the coast of Jacksonville (Playboy, Sports Illustrated, Leather and Lace you know the hard core stuff and...on and on and on...) I&apos;m willing to bet you will not see any of those highlights on the Insider or Entertainment Tonight.

The Eagles are staying in Ponte Vedra, Fla at the Sawgrass Marriott Resort and Spa. The city is about 30 minutes from downtown Jax. The resort is the world headquarters for the TPC/PGA Players Championship. The team had media day at the hotel this week. They played golf, had gormet foods, drinks, and deserts. Hootie and the Blowfish performed live music. There were also models and cheerleaders on hand. The women were reported as all smiles. I wonder what the models and cheerleaders were there for..........or is that what they&apos;re calling them this days....

One other thing. Donovan always mentions his mother with her support and committment to him. He will mention his baby daughter Alexis as well. Hell, the man got off the plane at Cecil Commerce Center with a camcorder stating he wanted his daughter to know where her dad played in the Superbowl. Donovan stated he wanted to record each and every moment he could. Not once this entire week of Superfest has he mentioned Roxi. Yet I must admit this, he was wearing a wedding band this week. The media has been all over him for five days and he&apos;s loved each and every minute of it. As of thursday 02/03/05 at 9:30pm the public no longer had access to the players. The team is on lock down now to prepare for the big game. I wish his big fine sexy ass all the luck in the world on Sunday.

LOL - I guess Sam and Wilma are getting&quot;revenge&quot;on Donovan. I&apos;ve read that Donovan had a very close relationship with his own grandparents (Wilma&apos;s parents) and that they would spoil Donovan...over Sam and Wilma&apos;s objections. Now Sam and Wilma can return the favor. 

And little Alexis is already in danger of being spoiled - even without Sam and Wilma. She is being born into amazing wealth - she has it made . Sam and Wilma (who are running Donovan&apos;s foundation - wonder how much they are making? ) can spoil Alexis with more expensive things than Donovan&apos;s grandparents ever spoiled Donovan with.

Yea I have to agree with you here, Destiny. Now that post was very interesting and I was entertained, but at the end of the day I take it with a grain of salt! As tempting as it is to believe this mess, it just doesn&apos;t make sense. Not that I think that Donovan has not&quot;cheated&quot;before...but to do all of this now - while he is married and has such a squeaky-clean media image? Let&apos;s face it - alot of his appeal and his endorsement deals depend upon an upstanding image of a guy who has been&quot;raised right&quot;...and if some of this were to get out, he would have so much to lose.

Of course...Michael Jordan did it (and continues to do it? ). But I don&apos;t think Donovan has the out-of-control ego issues that Jordan has. I don&apos;t think ...

You are so right - on eg.com, everyone cheats, and is on the&quot;down-low&quot;. It&apos;s fun to read but I feel sorry for these women who believe every word. Re: Archived Donovan articles

Oh, and on NFL Total Access (I&apos;m addicted to that show right now ) - Rich Eisen was interviewing Donovan and Rich mentioned that he saw Donovan pushing a baby stroller around the pool of the luxury hotel where alot of the players (and their families) were staying. Donovan was joking that he was doing it to impress people (&quot;see how good of a father Donovan is?&quot;). So the baby was in Hawaii last week, and Roxi had to have been there (although Donovan didn&apos;t mention her).

Oh, I wish I was there at that hotel last week - or at least been a fly on the wall!

Rich asked Donovan what it was like having a newborn in the middle of a busy,&quot;Superbowl&quot;season, and Donovan answered, but I forgot what he said. Donovan has a way of responding to questions without really revealing anything. He didn&apos;t say anything really noteworthy...it was all the same things we&apos;ve heard before. Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by georgiaeagle on Feb 14, 2005, 10:15pm

Oh, and T.O. was also interviewed on the show last week, and he mentioned his girlfriend, Felisha, by name - he mentioned how Felisha was there with him. He and Rich were joking about Felisha going shopping and T.O. giving her his credit card, etc. Seems like T.O. is really serious about this girl - now many athletes aren&apos;t as intensely private as Donovan, but it&apos;s rare that an athlete mentions his girlfriend in the media - especially by name. And she was right there by his side at his birthday party and was seen with him during the Eagles-Minnesota playoff game, etc. I wonder when he&apos;ll propose? 

I like how T.O. allegedly took the day off from Eagles practice and flew to Arizona to beg her to stay with him when she (allegedly) called him to break up with him. That was right after the Dallas game, when T.O. was excused from practice for&quot;personal reasons&quot;. Right after the game, the rest of the team flew back to Philly, while T.O. flew to Arizona to woo Felisha back. As y&apos;all may know, I got this info from eddiegeorge.com, but I believe this - it pretty much fits everything that I publically saw from T.O. at the time. If you recorded the Dallas MNF game, you can go back to the end of that game and notice, as T.O. is being interviewed, T.O. mentions that he is having some troubles in his personal life. I remember this, because I remember immediately wondering what he was talking about. Now I know that he was talking about Felisha trying to break up with him.

And then, a week or so later, Felisha shows up on T.O.&apos;s arm at his birthday party. T.O. starts treating her as&quot;The One&quot;. Soooo romantic...T.O. obviously sees something special in Felisha to have gone through such lengths (skipping practice for such a reason is unheard of! ) to keep her.

And I can imagine that going public with Felisha is also a way of T.O. telling the world (i.e. other women) to back off. Now will this deter many of these women...I kinda doubt it! But at least he&apos;s trying to take a stand...that&apos;s how much Felisha means to him. Re: Archived Donovan articles

I am addicted to NFL Total Access too and saw Rich Eisens interview with Donovan. I thought that it was hilarious because Rich wanted Donovan to elaborate on who was in the stroller, but he really didnt want to pry. Youre right GeogriaEagle, Donovan really didnt share any more information than we already knew. Rich did ask him if he ever confused the babys late-night/early morning crying with Andy Reids screaming at him. It was kind of funny in a corny way.

I also enjoyed Richs interview with T.O. I thought that it was interesting that T.O. recommended The Notebook as a must-see movie. Every time I see a T.O. interview, I just laugh because the media makes him out to be such a terrible person, but he always comes across as a regular person whos just living his life as he sees fit. I cant really fault anyone for doing that.

I Hope You All Appreciate Beauty Of McNabb

February 14, 2005

Donovan McNabb needs a rest. He needs to return to his home and put his head on a pillow and sleep off the great season and long, wonderful post-season he had and not wake up until he hears the shrieks of joy from his baby daughter.
McNabb needs to take the time to get his mind and body and soul back together to lead the Eagles on another Super Bowl chase in 2005.

He deserves it. He earned the winks.

Surely, McNabb is aware of all the hubbub back here in Philadelphia since the Super Bowl. He is a smart young man, an aware fellow, and when he stepped off the practice field in Honolulu and reporters swarmed him with questions of&quot;What happened?&quot;well, McNabb could only tell the truth.

&quot;Nothing happened,&quot;he said.

See, there are no excuses with McNabb, nor should there be any. In six seasons with the Eagles, he&apos;s taken the team to five playoff appearances, four trips to the NFC Championship Game, four NFC East titles and one Super Bowl. Along the way, McNabb has earned five Pro Bowl bids and is on the kind of course that lands players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

And yet, it is not enough.

Not for you. Not for me.

Not for him.

The Eagles are in a Super Bowl-or-bust mode these last several seasons, a mindset that will continue as long as McNabb is of healthy body and mind. He is a wonderful quarterback, a tremendous leader, a role model on and off the field and the target -- it goes with the territory, I know -- of much praise and much criticism.

Weaker men have fallen prey to such pressure. It is a torturous existence, if you allow it to be. McNabb is, in a sense, a prisoner of his own fame and fortune. He is a normal guy who has abnormal talents and earns great sums of money playing the game of football.

I&apos;ve avoided the hysteria of the Why Didn&apos;t The Eagles Run The Two-Minute Offense? story from the Super Bowl. I understand why so many people want an answer, as if to blame something or someone will make the defeat any easier to digest. I happen to think that the reaction has bordered on a massive overreaction -- the Eagles lost because they turned the ball over four times, not because they worked in a more judicious fashion offensively while trailing 24-14.

I heard the other day on sports talk radio in Philadelphia -- I can listen for about five minutes before I want to throw up -- that a fan said the Patriots&quot;were ripe for the picking at that point&quot;and it kind of amazed me. Ripe for the picking? With a 24-14 lead? This makes no sense.

My theory is twofold. One, I think the Eagles use a lot of personnel packages and wanted to make sure they were all on the same page on every play. The first objective there was to put the football in the end zone, and they did that. True, time was winding down, but the Eagles put the biscuit in the basket, so to speak.

Second, I don&apos;t think McNabb was in any way ill. He was exhausted. Everybody was exhausted. When you are forced to throw 40-plus passess against a team that drains you mentally as the Patriots do and when it happens on such a grand stage, yes, it&apos;s knocks you out. It was a 15-round bout. It was a Thrilla in JacksonPhilla.

No illness. No choking.

Just exhaustion. McNabb gave everything he had to try and win the Super Bowl.

And that&apos;s that.

Would it have been better for the Eagles had they scored more quickly? Absolutely. The Eagles were trailing by 10 points and needed scores.

But they were playing a Patriots defense that preys upon offenses that make mental errors. They put the football in the end zone. They gave themselves a chance at the end, even though the onsides kick didn&apos;t work and New England pinned the Eagles deep with little time remaining (criticism that the Eagles threw the ball over the middle on that final drive doesn&apos;t hold water with me. New England didn&apos;t permit passes to the sidelines.)

What I prefer to point out is that McNabb threw three touchdown passes and gained 357 yards in the air against a defense that made Peyton Manning look mortal and completely bamboozled a powerful Steelers offense.

The Eagles learned lessons in the Super Bowl. Many of them. They need to be far closer to perfect than they were last Sunday, that much is clear. They have to handle the hype and dictate to the team on the other sideline. They have to be the aggressor, not the team playing catch-up late in the game.

And they will win a Super Bowl with McNabb. Of that I am completely confident. McNabb is a special talent and a special person. I can give you countless experiences I have had with McNabb that provide the knowledge that he&apos;s the one in command here. He&apos;s the one who will win Super Bowls for the Eagles before it is all said and done.

He is not an easily-defined quarterback. That is part of what makes him so great. He can run if needed. He keeps plays alive with his legs. He has great awareness of pressure and of coverages. He passes the ball from the pocket very, very well.

Prior to Sunday night&apos;s Pro Bowl, the ESPN talking heads threw out this question: Who would you rather have, Donovan McNabb, Daunte Culpepper or Michael Vick?

It is one of those fun, sports-geek questions we like to answer, and I&apos;d easily go with McNabb. He is the complete package with a winning pedigree who completed a season in which he threw 31 touchdown passes and just 8 interceptions, the first time in NFL history a quarterback has thrown more than 30 scoring passes and less than 10 interceptions.

I watched McNabb struggle early in the Pro Bowl. Receivers dropped his first three passes and then he threw a couple of bad passes and called it a night. He looked wiped out, as did New England&apos;s Tom Brady. It was a long, long season for both men.

I liked this ditty from Adam Schefter from NFL.com from last week. Schefter was at the Pro Bowl and he witnessed, first hand, the magic of McNabb.

This is what Schefter wrote:

&quot;After one afternoon at the pool of the players&apos; hotel, it&apos;s not hard to deduce that Eagles Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb might be the most well-liked and well-respected player in the league. Players congregate to him as if he&apos;s a magnet. His voice booms throughout the pool area as if it&apos;s on a PA. And nobody laughs more and frowns less, even if his team didn&apos;t come through in Super Bowl XXXIX.

&quot;Players have surrounded McNabb all week, and treated him like the football royalty he is.

&quot;And McNabb&apos;s Wednesday had a special ending to it. He watched Falcons tight end Alge Crumpler&apos;s North Carolina basketball team tumble to Duke and teased the former Tar Heel unmercifully. More laughs for McNabb. They keep coming, at a time when some players might not be able to shake off the previous weekend&apos;s performance for months on end.

Kudos to McNabb for moving on.&quot;

These are the kinds of things the public doesn&apos;t see. These are the things that McNabb has been doing since he walked in off the campus of Syracuse University and made the Eagles his team.

He is still the captain of this ship, one that took us all on a merry ride in 2004. There will be more of it in 2005, and 2006 and beyond. McNabb is the quarterback, in the prime of his career, and that&apos;s good enough for me.

I believe this, too: It&apos;s good enough for 99.9 percent of all Eagles fans. I just hope the .1 percent get it right before McNabb&apos;s career is over.

So to McNabb, I say good night. Sleep well. Enjoy the family. Love life and all that comes with it. We all sure look forward to the day in late July when you come bounding onto the field in Bethlehem, PA to the chants of E-A-G-L-E-S, EAGLES! and training camp is on and the Eagles start the climb up the ladder once again.

I am addicted to NFL Total Access too and saw Rich Eisens interview with Donovan. I thought that it was hilarious because Rich wanted Donovan to elaborate on who was in the stroller, but he really didnt want to pry. Youre right GeogriaEagle, Donovan really didnt share any more information than we already knew. Rich did ask him if he ever confused the babys late-night/early morning crying with Andy Reids screaming at him. It was kind of funny in a corny way.

I also enjoyed Richs interview with T.O. I thought that it was interesting that T.O. recommended The Notebook as a must-see movie. Every time I see a T.O. interview, I just laugh because the media makes him out to be such a terrible person, but he always comes across as a regular person whos just living his life as he sees fit. I cant really fault anyone for doing that.
 
 


So you&apos;re a Total Access junkie too? Thanks for filling in the details of the Rich Eisen-Donovan&quot;small talk&quot;- your memory is much better than mine, lol. Yea that was about the gist of it.

You are so right concerning T.O. The media falls all over itself trying to portray him a certain way (whatever sells the papers, lol). There seems to be more&quot;sides&quot;to him, though - one minute he can seem pretty brash, but then at other times, he seems so soft-spoken and&quot;laid-back&quot;. Yep he&apos;s a regular person but a pretty&quot;high-maintenance&quot;one, lol!

Btw, I think NFL Total Access may be even more interesting now that it&apos;s the offseason...it seems like they may take the time to spend more&quot;off the field&quot;time with many of the players. Chad Johnson was on there this week - he was supposed to stay the full week, but it looks like they kicked him off the show early when he ran out of&quot;rides&quot;to show off, lol.

You know what? I believe it! Do you? My gut just tells me that these women are only reporting on what they saw. The behavior depicted in these posts is the type that you have to&quot;see to believe&quot;(coming from&quot;nice guy&quot;Donovan) - it&apos;s just incredible. But, I believe it!

Should we feel sorry for Roxi? She seems to have the perfect life, the perfect man and all - it just so happens that her&quot;Mr. Perfect&quot;likes to have his d*ck sucked by other women! Re: Archived Donovan articles

Here is the latest bag of goodies from over there...

 &quot;WHAT UP EVERYONE!!! Shouts out to Sexyone....yes, I made it back safely - thanks for asking. Okay well let me start the mess....

Donovan McNabb: Looking a hot mess LITERALLY, pretty large in the stomach, must be all that Chunky soup! He was so drunk that he kept stumbling on people. I HEARD him tell girls&quot;I am getting my d*&amp;$ sucked tonight and I am f&amp;*$% some of you before I leave&quot;. This ain&apos;t second hand stuff - FROM HIS DRUNK A$$ MOUTH DIRECTLY, I heard it all and I wasn&apos;t drunk!

Oh, and I guess all of my nice feelings I wrote about T.O.&apos;s love life were for nothing. According to the same thread, he and Felisha broke up again in Hawaii and he basically kicked her off the island (or she left on her own, either one).

Darn, for some reason I wanted this relationship to work - I think he needs in his life a nice, stable relationship with a nice woman. Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by destiny5 on Feb 18, 2005, 12:25pm

GE... i just read the latest. wow... shocking and disgusting thats all i can say about it. if its true then donovan should be ashamed for all that 
he is disrespecting the mother of his child.

i feel sorry for roxi. she was/is standing by his side, having his baby and he treats her so bad. sorry, i had to say it like that. she should leave his ass she is a beautiful young woman and she deserves better than that. maybe she should have left him after the sharon reed story in 2002. i am pretty sure that you all heard of that. to me this just proves that the people who seem to have the perfect life arent as happy and lucky as we all think. i remember that my dad pretty much did the same things to my mom. in some way she was like roxi. she knew about it and just took it. never said one word to him. she was hurt because she really really loved my dad and all he did was treat her wrong. thank god... my mom left my dad and has a new man by her side who really loves her.

maybe this also shows that there is no perfect man out there. nobody is perfect.... sad but true. Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by georgiaeagle on Feb 21, 2005, 8:58am

Well, as far as the possibility of Roxi leaving Donovan...I dunno. She possibly married him with knowledge of Sharon Reed and his other&quot;activities&quot;. Or maybe she thought he was going to stop when the ring went on their fingers? It&apos;s possible.

Some women learn to&quot;excuse&quot;their men&apos;s extramarital activities by telling themselves that it&apos;s just empty, mindless sex that their man is having with other women - they learn to think like their man (or buy into what their man is telling him). A man&apos;s doggish sex-drive has nothing to do with love, or so these men say. 

It can be hard to actually leave a man - threatening to leave is one thing, but to actually go through with it is pretty tough for many women. And let&apos;s face it - the allure of being the wife of a megastar, multi-millionaire athlete can be a powerful thing to let go.

Roxi is better off than many of these athletes&apos; wives in that she has a college degree and she has shown that she is very much capable of earning her own way in life. But at the same time...she&apos;s basically been&quot;Donovan&apos;s girl&quot;since she was 18 years-old - that&apos;s been her identity her entire adult life. She doesn&apos;t know anything else. (Donovan could have very well have been her first boyfriend ever - very possible.) She&apos;s in love, and he has a hold on her psychologically...especially since Donovan has so much charisma and other nice qualities.

From these posts, it sounds like Donovan may have been pretty drunk when he was going around that club saying all that. Remember how we were saying that Donovan is always pretty much is on a&quot;natural high&quot;? It&apos;s just built into his personality. Donovan is the type that may not need to be drinking, period . He&apos;s already so&quot;up&quot;. Put a little drink into a guy like Donovan and he is floating in outer-space. Re: Archived Donovan articles

amen sista 
its extremely hard to leave a man. especially when you really love that man and in some way depend on him. roxi is married and has a daughter with donovan and she is dating him for 10 years. could leave 10 years behind like that?

i remember that i talked about this with my mom and she told me that she didnt leave him because she wanted me and my brother to grow up with our real dad and she was afraid of being alone. she thought that this would be the best thing for us. if roxi knows about the things donovan does (if its true) then she probably feels the same way my mom felt.

i think that when you really really love someone.. you dont have the desire to have sex with other people. at least thats how i feel. i am in love right now and i cant imagine having sex with another guy or other guys. oh... hell no!! thats nasty! when youre single you can do whatever you wanna do but when you are in a relationship and you sleep with other people.... just think about all the diseases out there!!

Oh, my fainting heart. Great find, Destiny! You beat me to posting these pics - I found this site the other day and I had planned to post the Donovan and Brian pics whenever I got the chance. Seems like we went&quot;babe&quot;hunting at the same time, lol.

The Brian Westbrook pic -- OHHHH MYYYY GOD! I hate to use the Lord&apos;s name in vain, but I can&apos;t help myself, lol. Could Brian look any hotter? For a sweet guy like Brian to open his shirt and show this&quot;bad boy&quot;side of him...it&apos;s just an amazing experience. I look at that pic and want to scream! Hot hot hot!

I also appreciate the open shirt on Donovan...although he now doesn&apos;t excite me as much as Brian. I remember when I was scouring the Internet for shirtless pics of Donovan, lol. Finally...a little something. Re: Archived Donovan articles

You make great points - Lord knows I agree with you on that last part. At least I want to agree...I&apos;d like to think that I wouldn&apos;t be seriously tempted to have sex with other people while in a serious relationship. Many women, like you and I, feel this way. With men...that may be another story. Men may be wired differently, I&apos;m afraid - some men like to say that it&apos;s&quot;in their nature&quot;to want to have sex with many women. It&apos;s a tendency of men that&apos;s difficult to deal with - it&apos;s hurtful, very hurtful to think that the man you&apos;re in love with even wants to cheat on you, much less go out and do it! I don&apos;t like it when a man I&apos;m with even looks at another woman - it&apos;s a big insecurity I have. But who am I to prevent them from just looking at other women whom they find attractive...it&apos;s&quot;harmless&quot;, supposedly. I just hate it. 

I think it&apos;s very admirable of your mom to act upon what she thought was best for you and your brother. There may be pluses and minuses to staying in a bad relationship for this reason. If the dad is a good dad to the children, but&quot;just&quot;a lousy, cheating husband - then maybe the sacrifice is worth it, but sometimes, it&apos;s just not worth it.

But I think we can all see that Donovan has a lot of good qualities (at least that&apos;s what most people who have dealt with him in life have said about him), plus he is obviously a good provider for his family - Roxi may be willing to put up with his (alleged) cheating for these reasons. It would be tough for me. Re: Archived Donovan articles

Then again, both of these accounts can be true. It&apos;s just that the person on TO.com saw one side of Donovan, and the ladies of eg.com saw the other, hornier side. Re: Archived Donovan articles

More Donovan dirt from eg.com (I&apos;m copying most of the thread here)...

 ~Supastarr,

~HAHAHAHA.....no - I saw no male&apos;s in towels! McNabb is definitely not someone I want to see in only a towel.....his large sweaty self made everyone turned off. I thought he was about to throw up on some poor girl and he couldn&apos;t even stand up straight.

~hey ladyt, how was hawaii, I know you probally seen alot, yea Iheard about mcnabb towel episode in his suite....with his nasty self...lol

~What&apos;s this about a McNabb towel episode?? Would y&apos;all mind throwing some more crumbs at us peasants?

i wish one of us could post that pic. oh lord knows i would print that pic out and look at it the whole day. my boyfriend probably wouldnt like it but that doesnt matter! its actually a kinda weird to see brian show his body like that. he always seems to be so quiet and eveny shy and then BAM that picture.

to be honest with you... that donovan pic does nothing for me. i actually only look at the brian pic. wow.... i cant get over his body. can you tell me why he is hiding that body all the time? come on brian.... knock us out with that stomach!

LOL - I&apos;m feeling you on this post. I mean, Donovan is a big, thick dude...but his body just can&apos;t hang with Brian&apos;s. And Donovan&apos;s calves remind me of my calves - and that&apos;s not nessessarily a good thing. 

Right - and Donovan is not the eg.com ladies&apos; vision of an ideal man. Donovan&apos;s not vain enough, shallow enough, pretentious enough, and doesn&apos;t have enough&quot;street cred&quot;. And Donovan is not supported by one of the board&apos;s&quot;queens&quot;. When certain&quot;popular&quot;people over there give their opinion on a player, the rest of the masses usually follow along.

Although some ladies disagreed with me and defended Donovan when I posted that I was tired of Donovan&apos;s media machine, and how&quot;strongly&quot;that Donovan was being marketed to the masses. That&apos;s just because they dislike me more than they dislike Donovan. If you ever want to hear something nice about Donovan on that board, all I have to do is post something negative - that will get people disagreeing with me just for the sake of disagreeing with me. It&apos;s reverse psychology. 

And you&apos;re right about his look this past season - WTF was that? When I first had a crush on him in 2003 - his &apos;fro was under control, and he had a nice goatee - not that Muslim beard. His look this past season was wilder, that&apos;s for sure. And you&apos;re so right about Donovan looking about, 10-20 years older just because of that beard.

But it&apos;s all good. I like the fact that he kinda does his own thing - he doesn&apos;t feel the need to groom himself within an inch of his life to feed his vanity or to please us ladies. Re: Archived Donovan articles

you are so right girl... i gotta take care of my health these days! that means... everytime i see him on tv i am going to freak out!! 

halle berry is very pretty but like you said she really is overrated. although i have to be honest and say that she did an amazing job in&quot;monsters ball&quot;. i have to give her that. all her other movies were just bad.

yeah i remember how eaglegene dissed michael vick. poor mike!

Ok, I&apos;ll go ahead and diss Halle if u want me to 

I haven&apos;t seen&quot;Monster&apos;s Ball&quot;- I really need to see this movie (along with a zillion other movies I need to&quot;catch up&quot;on...). But the one or two scenes that I did see of this movie...I wasn&apos;t that impressed w/ Halle&apos;s acting. Maybe I need to see these scenes again (along with the whole movie), I dunno.

Halle puts a lot of effort and energy into her acting, but her overall skill level is not that good. A lot of times I end up thinking,&quot;Poor thing - she&apos;s trying sooo hard - but she&apos;s not quite getting it down&quot;. There are times when she is good, though - I think she was very good in the HBO movie&quot;Introducing Dorthy Dandridge&quot;.

I remember the&quot;Queen&quot;disaster - Halle was sooo desperate for that role that she bugged the h*ll out of the producers - she wouldn&apos;t give up even though they just didn&apos;t think she was right for the part. They had another actress in mind for that part (I believe it was Jasmine Guy). Well, she finally wore the producers down and they gave her the role. And when the miniseries aired on t.v. -- she was awful, just awful! The producers shouldn&apos;t have ever let that desperate woman talk them into giving her that role - the role should have stayed with Jasmine Guy! Re: Archived Donovan articles

Looks like the Kid Capri site is arranged such that you can&apos;t&quot;steal&quot;the photos. They made it impossible to get the address and post the pics here.

Donovan really gets around, doesn&apos;t he? Hanging with Kid Capri? I see that Terrell Davis (that fine hunk of chocolate, yum yum) met Kid Capri too.

Soup to Nuts, McNabb&apos;s Mom Has the Whole Package

Michael Wilbon
Associated Press
Feb. 2, 2005

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It used to be that the Tuesday of Super Bowl week, Media Day, was the day the stars came out - or were born. But the Patriots claim they&apos;re so team-oriented they don&apos;t have any stars. And we already know everything we need to - or want to - about the Eagles&apos; Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens. Their stories, since Labor Day, have been told to death. So there was only one star with a story worth telling here Tuesday: McNabb&apos;s mom.

You don&apos;t have to be an Eagles fan to identify with her - or identify her. You don&apos;t even have to care about football. If you like mothers and soup, you&apos;ve got to have a warm feeling for Wilma McNabb, the retired registered nurse who has become the soup-serving den mother for the Eagles and anybody who needs a trip down memory lane. Would you want another helping of T.O.&apos;s busted leg or a bowl of Mrs. McNabb&apos;s Chunky Soup?

She&apos;s the most popular person associated with the Eagles this week, more in demand than the tight end, Jeff Thomason, who walked in off the street when Chad Lewis got injured. She may be more in demand than her son when you consider that Wilma McNabb has appeared on or is about to appear on&quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live,&quot;&quot;Ellen,&quot;CBS&apos;s&quot;Early Show&quot;and&quot;NFL Total Access.&quot;Not even the Philly fans can boo Wilma McNabb. advertisement

&quot;I&apos;ve got two celebrities I&apos;ve got to keep grounded,&quot;Sam McNabb said of his son and wife.&quot;I guess I&apos;m Common Sam, the regular guy in the family.&quot;

&quot;Her schedule is crazier than mine,&quot;Donovan said of his mom&apos;s Tuesday activities, which included a Campbell&apos;s Soup news conference that was preceded by more than a dozen radio interviews.

Buccaneers defensive star Simeon Rice went to high school in Chicago with McNabb and has known Sam and Wilma at least half of his life.&quot;Man, Mrs. McNabb has got it going on,&quot;Rice said during media day.&quot;She&apos;s off the hook right now. She&apos;s got the number five (her son&apos;s jersey number) with all the stones on it. And she&apos;s got the super limited edition Donovan McNabb jersey. I love it. You know, though, I wanted to do that for my mother.&quot;

And that&apos;s the appeal of McNabb&apos;s mom selling Campbell&apos;s Chunky Soup. Isn&apos;t that what we all want for our mothers? Don&apos;t we all want them to be celebrated for doing something so particularly momish?&quot;She&apos;s acting,&quot;Sam McNabb said,&quot;but she&apos;s not acting because that&apos;s her. It&apos;s who she is anyway. It&apos;s not a role, it&apos;s her, looking after everybody, making sure everybody is OK and doing the right thing. She&apos;s a natural. She loves it.&quot;

You wonder why somebody didn&apos;t think of it earlier, especially at a time when so many sponsors employ phony pitchmen or endorsers that it makes your skin crawl. But how could anybody find fault with somebody&apos;s mom, a former nurse no less, making sure guys eat their soup?

For a year or so, Campbell&apos;s used an actress. That was before Wilma McNabb spoke up and said,&quot;I can do that.&quot;So Campbell&apos;s let her.

&quot;I told her she&apos;s a rookie until her second year,&quot;Donovan said.&quot;I&apos;d say, &apos;Sit down, rookie&apos; or &apos;Go get me something to drink, rookie&apos; or &apos;You&apos;ve got to pick up the check for dinner tonight, rookie.&apos; Now she&apos;s the key veteran who&apos;s running things.&quot;

Actually, she always was.

Wilma and Sam McNabb got married not long after high school and have been married 32 years. They have two sons, Sean, who&apos;s in the mortgage business in New Jersey, and Donovan. Wilma started high school at Mercy, an all-girls&apos; Catholic high school on the South Side of Chicago, but transferred to Morgan Park, where she met Sam.&quot;She&apos;s the looser one now,&quot;Donovan said,&quot;but she was the disciplinarian. She&apos;d pop you in the back of your head if you did something wrong. And she&apos;d pop you in your lip if you said something you weren&apos;t supposed to say. She started the whuppins but never finished them. She&apos;s a bag of tricks. She gave you a different look every time.&quot;

Asked if Donovan&apos;s use of the word&quot;pop&quot;was an exaggeration, Wilma said:&quot;&apos;Popped&apos; is probably a pretty good way of describing it. With a fist. Is old-school a fair way of describing my philosophy on raising children? Oh, yes, it is. It&apos;s fair.&quot;

Donovan went to no-nonsense Mt. Carmel and Sean went to no-nonsense St. Francis, Catholic schools in Chicago where the priests back in the day would put on boxing gloves and take a kid with too much lip to the ring for a little dust-up. Sam, laughing, said Wilma reminds him of the&quot;Aunt Polly character from Tom Sawyer.&quot;

Wilma and Sam, who retired from his career with Commonwealth Edison in Chicago, have seen virtually every Eagles game since Donovan was drafted from Syracuse. Their mission was to raise two responsible young men. Sports - even though Donovan was a two-sport star and played with Rice and NBA star Antoine Walker in high school - was secondary, if that. So the notion that she would be on television endorsing, well, anything was the farthest thing from Wilma McNabb&apos;s mind.

&quot;Never, not ever,&quot;she said Tuesday.&quot;It&apos;s unbelievable. Sometimes, it&apos;s overwhelming. But I love it. It&apos;s fun. I try not to be celebrity-acting. It&apos;s just a lot of fun. I think what people see of me in the commercials is who I am. I&apos;m just a big mom, someone who is very supportive.&quot;

Her commercial shoots - the last one was in Philly - usually last one day, from six to eight hours.&quot;It&apos;s really pleasing to see her accomplish this,&quot;Sam said.&quot;I have such a batch of mixed emotions this week. I&apos;m ecstatic for Donovan ... to have envisioned this for your son and then to see it come true. It&apos;s a major accomplishment and achievement. And then for my wife to have this ... I joke with them, &apos;Is there room enough in our household for the both of them?&apos;&quot;

Wilma McNabb&apos;s news conference was about 15 minutes from beginning. People were filing into the ballroom at the convention center downtown, many with cameras and notebooks. More than a few mothers wearing jerseys were coming just to tell her how much honor she had brought to mothers everywhere. Her son Donovan was nowhere to be seen; probably he was preparing to attend Eagles practice. Sam stood nearby, on the sidelines, one might say. He&apos;s a distinguished man with a great smile. I asked why Donovan&apos;s dad hadn&apos;t attracted any endorsement attention.&quot;I&apos;m open,&quot;he said, smile beaming.&quot;I&apos;m open.&quot;

Yea, I noticed that there were two pics of Donovan - I figured that they were taken at two different times, but I didn&apos;t look at them all that closely until now. Your observations are spot on - the first pic seems to be the most recent one because of his face-hair. (he doesn&apos;t have the entire Muslim beard though - just the Muslim goatee, lol) Donovan looks several years younger in the second pic. So you think his attitude has changed? What do you mean? I&apos;m interested in hearing what you mean.

And yea, I&apos;ve always thought that Todd Pinkston was handsome - he&apos;s adorable! I remember saying this after I watched one of his press conferences on the Eagles web site. He may be skinny, but he&apos;s tall - taller than Donovan, even. He seems to be a nice, country gentleman. (He and T.O. have the cutest Southern accents )

Thanks for declaring Terrell Davis my man. Those words are sweet music to my ears! He used to have a home in Atlanta, I&apos;m not sure if he still does or not. He went to the University of Georgia right around the same time that I was in college at Georgia Tech. The University of Georgia (UGA) and Georgia Tech are longtime rivals - we hate each other! Or at least we&apos;re supposed to hate each other, but I can&apos;t bring myself to hate Terrell Davis. I don&apos;t remember Terrell&apos;s time at the University of Georgia, because I just wasn&apos;t following football at all back then. Not college football, anyway. I never went to any of the games. See what I missed out on? I should have gotten out more...maybe I could have met Terrell at some party or something. (I knew some people who went to UGA.)

This is a nice article by Michael Wilbon. Wilbon is Chicago born and bred - that&apos;s probably why he was able to give those interesting details about the Catholic schools that Wilma, Donovan, and Sean attended. That&apos;s funny about the priests getting out the boxing gloves, lol. Shoot - I wonder if Wilbon himself went to one of these Catholic schools?

Seems like Catholic schools are pretty popular with the Eagles. Westy went to an all boys Catholic high school in Maryland.

I went to a Catholic elementary school from kindergarden through 8th grade (that had both girls and boys) - so I&apos;m a bit familiar with that old-school discipline. But I think the Catholic schools down here in the South are a watered-down version of the ones in the big Northern and Mid-Western cities. I never saw a priest put on boxing gloves down here, lol. The nuns were pretty strict, but they didn&apos;t hit people or anything. They might have gotten sued down here for that, lol. Oddly enough, most of the nuns who taught at our school came from an Order in...Philadelphia! Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by destiny5 on Mar 31, 2005, 10:20am

to answer your question if donovans attitude changed... i would say HELL YEAH!!
what i mean with that is that he changed his whole look. at least thats what i think. his style is more hip hop. you know... his hair is braided, he wears sean john and all that, holds up the peace sign all that! no smile on his face and we all know that donovan is usually laughing on every picture. he is laughing in the second picture! look at this style in the second pic. you cant compare it to the second pic! to me it shows that donovan changed with the years. yeah... we all grow up and find out who we are and everything but i dont know. GE i hope you know what i mean! 

 Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by georgiaeagle on Apr 4, 2005, 3:05am

Ahhh - now I think I know what you mean. Good point! Great observation. From those two pics it does appear that he&apos;s changed his&quot;attitude&quot;. And over the years he has become more&quot;hip hop&quot;, in some ways. I wonder what&apos;s that about? Has his style changed for real, or is he being influenced by something?

I guess I&apos;ve noticed kind-of the same&quot;change&quot;- seems like in the past, he wasn&apos;t as materialistic and&quot;bling bling&quot;. And he has said that he wouldn&apos;t let the money change him in that regard. But I see some of the things that Donovan has bought and some of the things he wears, and I wonder if he has forgotten that promise to himself, lol. Like that big, customized, SUV he has...does he actually drive that thing? Around Philly ? I was just kinda surprised to see that Donovan had gotten that type of vehicle. It seems too&quot;showy&quot;for the style of guy I thought he was. And I remember watching the&quot;Fan Show&quot;that featured a tour of his house, the one you told me about. (The&quot;home tour&quot;actually turned out to be a just tour of the baby&apos;s room and of his enormous closet!) The closet had an insane number of clothes - and it looked like he had brought 50 pair of the same shoes. I remember thinking,&quot;why would someone have the need to have 50 pairs of tennis shoes that all look more or less the same?&quot;Seriously, it looked like a&quot;White Sale&quot;at Footlocker or something. Can we say, Conspicuous Consumption? LOL

With Donovan&apos;s $$$$$, I guess things aren&apos;t as bad as they could be, but he&apos;s certainly changed from the guy who said that he wasn&apos;t interested in showy clothes and rides and things.

But you&apos;re right - usually you get less &quot;hip-hop&quot;as you get older, but Donovan is doing the opposite, lol. It might be pressure to&quot;fit in&quot;and to avoid being critisized by certain people, or it could be just him - who knows? I think in the black community there is this pressure to be a certain way...especially for people under 35 or so. At least that&apos;s the way I see it...maybe I&apos;m wrong. People like Tiger Woods get criticized for not being&quot;black enough&quot;- maybe Donovan is doing all this to avoid that tag? Re: Archived Donovan articles

 McNabb to sit out season 
By Mike Clay, Sports Editor, The Keystone
www,channelcincinnati.com

McNabb broke the hearts of Philly fans on Wednesday when he announced he would sit out the upcoming season and might retire for good.
First, it was Barry Sanders unexpectedly walking away from the National Football League. Then, last year, Ricky Williams announced his early retirement from the league. Now, the plague has hit Philly.

Philadelphia Eagles pro-bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb announced Wednesday evening that he plans to sit out the entire 2005 season and is considering retirement. McNabb, who threw for 3,875 yards last season for the Eagles and led the team to the franchises first Superbowl appearance since 1981, phoned from Chicago to inform coach Andy Reid of his decision.

Williams, former Miami Dolphins runningback who shocked the football world when he walked away from the game at age 27 after the 2003 season, said that McNabb had spoken to him about retirement a few days after the Eagles fell to the Patriots 24-21 in Superbowl XXXIX.

Donovan told me back in February that he was going to take a year off and maybe even retire for good, Williams said via satellite hookup from Tokyo on Wednesday. I guess Im a little bit surprised that hes doing it, but he told me back then he was thinking about making a change after the season and I do know where he is coming from.

McNabb has been in the spotlight of the league since entering as the overall number two draft choice in the 1999 rookie draft, but retiring at the age of 28 coming off a year in which you fell three points short of a Superbowl title?

I was completely surprised, Reid said Wednesday. My main thought process was to try to get Don to come back here, sit down, talk about some things and see if we can get this thing back on track. He obviously chose to go another direction.

McNabb, who notified Reid Wednesday, plans to file retirement papers today or Friday with the NFL.

I have no idea what Im going to do, said McNabb in a brief statement. Who knows? I just know it is going to be fun. I dont feel like I have to explain myself to anyone. I dont want to do it anymore. If people really care about me, that would be enough for them.

Well, Donovan, you can forget about anyone in Philly caring about you now. Unless, of course, this article was an April Fools Day joke. Re: Archived Donovan articles

 Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by georgiaeagle on Apr 20, 2005, 10:06pm

Yea, Tiger is pretty much the stereotype of&quot;not black enough&quot;. So are the Gumbel brothers - Bryant and Greg - they were pretty much the #1 stereotype until Tiger came along.

I really don&apos;t agree with the mentality of someone not being black enough - at least not for the same reasons that some people do. Some people look at manner of speech, taste in music, etc. - I think that&apos;s kinda ridiculous. Sometimes it gets to the point where a kid (or an adult) is afraid of speaking proper English for fear of being teased about being&quot;too white&quot;. The way we limit ourselves sometimes is crazy.

good points GE .
we really limit ourselves with the whole&quot;not black enough&quot;thing. it shouldnt be wrong to talk in proper english. too many people think that when you are black you have to talk&quot;ghetto&quot;. you know what i mean? a few days ago i saw.... who was it ..... i believe it was this guy who did the&quot;yeah&quot;song with usher. something liljohn? i dont know... well what i wanted to say was that i had to change the channel. the way he talks is so annoying to me. all he said was&quot;WHAT!&quot;,&quot;you know what i am saying&quot;,&quot;word&quot;,&quot;thats how its going down boy&quot;. i could continue with this forever!

 Hamilton pulls for McNabb (February 5, 2005)

Hamilton football fans, Donovan McNabb feels the love. The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback knows he&apos;ll have a strong cheering section in the Southern Ontario city which is also known as the home town of his wife, Roxy Nurse.

&quot;Everyone is going to be watching,&quot;McNabb said this week.&quot;We have the Nurse family that is obviously well represented out there.

&quot;Hamilton has been part of my life through marriage and we have a big fan base out there. It is going to be exciting for them on Super Bowl Sunday.&quot;

McNabb met Nurse while both attended Syracuse University. Nurse, an outstanding high school player in Hamilton, was on the women&apos;s basketball team while McNabb played for the Orange in both football and hoops.

 Mount Carmel prepared McNabb 

Sunday, October 3, 2004

Mike Daigler laughs at the notion that if Donovan McNabb had gone somewhere other than Mount Carmel High School he might be the quarterback at Soldier Field today, leading the Eagles or some other NFL team against the Chicago Bears.

&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot;said Daigler, who was McNabb&apos;s backup quarterback at the all-boys parochial school on Chicago&apos;s South Side.&quot;Coach Frank (Lenti) always tells people, I&apos;m the one who taught Donovan all he knows. It&apos;s not true, but it is funny.&quot;

Daigler graduated from Mount Carmel in 1995, one year after McNabb, and went on to Notre Dame. He is now a history teacher and student activities director at Mount Carmel, which has a student body of 750.

McNabb went on to Syracuse University, where he earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in speech communications and minored in African-American studies. He&apos;s now in his sixth year as quarterback of the Eagles, but his allegiance to Mount Carmel remains strong.

&quot;Mount Carmel prepares you not only for college, but for life and the responsibilities it carries,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;For a lot of us who went there, we went in with an open mind and came out with an idea of what we wanted to do in life.&quot;

It&apos;s been 10 years since graduating from Mount Carmel and McNabb now donates thousands of dollars each year to his alma mater. In 2000, he established the Donovan McNabb Golden Arm Scholarship, awarded to students with a 2.5 grade-point average or better based on essays they submit about their lives.

&quot;We&apos;re very grateful for what Donovan has done for this school,&quot;said Father Carl Markelz, the 42-year-old principal at Mount Carmel.&quot;Obviously, he is a tremendous quarterback. But first and foremost he is an excellent human being. His parents (Sam and Wilma) were very instrumental in his guidance and direction.&quot;

Sam McNabb, a retired electrical engineer, and his wife, Wilma, a registered nurse, still live in Chicago. Sam recently started Seado Enterprises, an information and referral program that assists high school football players in their pursuit of colleges. He is also founder of the NFL Fathers&apos; Association. Wilma, who appears in Campbell&apos;s Soup commercials with Donovan, oversees her son&apos;s endorsements and is vice president of the NFL Mothers&apos; Association.

Wilma McNabb planned on treating the Eagles to a buffet dinner at their hotel this weekend.

&quot;It&apos;s always special when you have an opportunity to come home and even more when you get a chance to play at Soldier Field,&quot;said McNabb, who played his final high school game there.&quot;Soldier Field to me was one of the best stadiums in the NFL and the Bears were a team I wanted to play for growing up. All I hear is how come I wasn&apos;t drafted by them, which was not my decision.&quot;

In visits to Soldier Field as the Eagles quarterback, McNabb has gone 2-0, completing 44 of 73 passes for 471 yards and two touchdowns. A calm influence

It was in South Chicago that McNabb&apos;s ability to play quarterback became evident. Under Lenti, Mount Carmel ran a veer triple option and McNabb played it to perfection.

&quot;In the offense we ran, the quarterback makes a lot of quick decisions on the run,&quot;Daigler said,&quot;so you had to show composure. If the team was a little panicky, he&apos;d calm the players down by cracking a joke in the huddle. But Donovan also had a real competitive edge to him.&quot;

Simeon Rice, now a defensive end with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was two years ahead of McNabb at Mount Carmel. He remembers a hard-nosed sophomore backup who made things happen when he took over for the starter late in a lopsided game.

&quot;Back then we couldn&apos;t wait for our No. 1 QB to come out of the game so we could see Donovan do some crazy feats,&quot;said Rice, a 1992 graduate of Mount Carmel.&quot;Man, he could run the football.&quot;

McNabb said his evolution from an option quarterback at Mount Carmel and Syracuse to a pocket passer with the Eagles has not been as dramatic as people suggest, saying Andy Reid&apos;s West Coast offense has never restricted his running ability.

&quot;Coach Reid has given me the green light ever since I started running this offense of doing what I&apos;m capable of doing,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;People are seeing that I can sit in the pocket and pass the ball. I guess I erased that whole theory of me not being a pocket passer.&quot;

Perhaps, but it is McNabb&apos;s ability to escape the pocket that makes him more versatile than most quarterbacks.

 Re: Archived Donovan articles 
Post by destiny5 on May 1, 2005, 6:07am

McNabb enters today&apos;s game with the NFL&apos;s third-best quarterback rating (122), behind only the Vikings&apos; Daunte Culpepper and the Jets&apos; Chad Pennington. He already has thrown for 931 yards and eight touchdowns. The best?

&quot;He is the best quarterback in this league,&quot;Rice said.&quot;He came to a team that wasn&apos;t good at all, almost last in the NFC in offense, and took them to the championship game three times with no big players on his offense.

&quot;He&apos;s better than Peyton Manning. Better than Tom Brady. He kept that team alive. Now he&apos;s got some guys to throw to and people are noticing.&quot;

Terrell Owens certainly has. The wide receiver said no other NFL quarterback could have thrown the pass he caught from McNabb in the season opener against the Giants, when McNabb threw across his body just before leaping out of bounds.

&quot;Any other quarterback, I don&apos;t think they would&apos;ve had the ability to escape (Michael) Strahan at that point,&quot;Owens said.

&quot;To have the poise and presence of mind not to go out of bounds, and to have a strong enough arm to throw across his body and find a guy . . . Those are things I&apos;ve been wanting pretty much since I&apos;ve been with the 49ers filling the void of Jerry Rice.

&quot;I always envisioned myself with a quarterback such as Donovan. Steve (Young) got knocked out of games early, late in his career. I wasn&apos;t able to blossom with him. Jeff (Garcia) was limited with some of the things he could do. With Donovan I have all those things with one guy. I&apos;m blessed to have him.&quot;Receiving praise

McNabb could say the same about his array of receivers. In just three games this season, all wins, he has thrown to nine different receivers, averaging 12.5 yards a reception.

&quot;He has so many weapons, I&apos;m pretty sure he has a hard time deciding who he wants to throw the ball to,&quot;Owens said.&quot;It&apos;s like having Baskin Robbins right there in front of you.&quot;

McNabb agrees.

&quot;I enjoy looking around the huddle,&quot;he said,&quot;and seeing guys with wide eyes just waiting for an opportunity to catch the ball or make a big block.&quot;

Eagles tight end Chad Lewis said McNabb&apos;s greatest gift is not his athleticism; it is his decisive leadership in those huddles.

&quot;As long as he&apos;s been here he&apos;s been the leader and that&apos;s undisputed,&quot;Lewis said.&quot;That&apos;s how it is here. He has everyone&apos;s respect. Every person in this locker room knows he&apos;s going to lay it on the line for us every week and that&apos;s what makes people want to lay it on the line for him.&quot;

Daigler said McNabb had that same respect at Mount Carmel, and not only on the football field. Daigler remembers going to a high school dance at a nearby all-girls school and knowing no one there but McNabb. They hung together all night, along with their dates, and became good friends.

&quot;There weren&apos;t any kids at all who did not like Donovan,&quot;Daigler said.&quot;Football is a big deal around here and quarterback is a very strong position. It is a role you have to live up to, no matter who you are. Kids looked up to Donovan, but he never walked around with a big head.&quot;

Ten years later things haven&apos;t changed much. McNabb is still the big man on Philadelphia&apos;s vast campus, making folks in Chicago wonder what might have been if he&apos;d stuck around after high school.

&quot;I&apos;m not sure I could say I knew he&apos;d be one of the top-rated passers in the NFL,&quot;Daigler said.&quot;What I can say is that we knew Donovan was something special. He was a special person, a special athlete and he had the potential to go somewhere.&quot;

 good points GE .
we really limit ourselves with the whole&quot;not black enough&quot;thing. it shouldnt be wrong to talk in proper english. too many people think that when you are black you have to talk&quot;ghetto&quot;. you know what i mean? a few days ago i saw.... who was it ..... i believe it was this guy who did the&quot;yeah&quot;song with usher. something liljohn? i dont know... well what i wanted to say was that i had to change the channel. the way he talks is so annoying to me. all he said was&quot;WHAT!&quot;,&quot;you know what i am saying&quot;,&quot;word&quot;,&quot;thats how its going down boy&quot;. i could continue with this forever! 
 


Sorry so late on this reply, but - Yeah(!), I think Lil&apos; Jon is a perfect example of what we&apos;re talking about. Have you ever seen that picture of him when he was only 12 or 13 years old? It was being posted around the Internet awhile back. He looked like a totally different person (aside from those recognizable big lips, lol!). His hair was cut extremely low to his head, he wore glasses - he looked like an innocent choirboy, or what they call&quot;nerdy&quot;. Sometime between then and now, he underwent a radical change! He got rid of that clean-cut image and took on this&quot;King of Crunk&quot;persona. A lot of black guys face&quot;peer pressure&quot;to do this - I wonder if that was the case with him? At 12 years-old, he looked like the type of guy that would have been teased by other kids - especially black kids, unfortunately.

I also understand that Lil&apos; Jon grew up pretty wealthy - he didn&apos;t grow up poor or in the&quot;ghetto&quot;at all. I bet deep underneath all of that&quot;WHAT!&quot;and all of that other&quot;ghetto&quot;talk, is a guy who knows how to use the King&apos;s English!

It&apos;s just kinda sad that this is how black people (and the&quot;suits&quot;that market them) feel like they have to act to be acceptable to the masses. All of this&quot;ghetto&quot;stuff is waayy overdone these days.

You may be surprised by this, but another person who my brother and I feel who is&quot;ghettofying&quot;her speech patterns to be&quot;acceptable&quot;is Alicia Keys! They way she talks gets on our nerves! She isn&apos;t the worst talker out there...but every time she opens her mouth we get the feeling that she is being fake. It&apos;s like she&apos;s thinking,&quot;Oh, let me sound a &apos;lil ghetto so people can &apos;relate&apos; to me and buy my music.&quot;

And Beyonce&apos;s country-ghetto a$$ gets on my nerves too. And don&apos;t think that the way she talks is not done on purpose. Every part of Beyonce&apos;s image has been carefully studied and worked-on. I guess it was okay for her to use creams to&quot;refine&quot;her skin, and to buy expensive hair from India, and to get surgeries to&quot;refine&quot;her figure - but refining her speech? No! Black folks would have thought that she was being&quot;too white&quot;if she talked better! It&apos;s okay to have blonde weave all the way down to her a$$, but when it comes to talking, gotta leave that&quot;natural&quot;- LOL! Re: Archived Donovan articles

 Hamilton pulls for McNabb (February 5, 2005)

Hamilton football fans, Donovan McNabb feels the love. The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback knows he&apos;ll have a strong cheering section in the Southern Ontario city which is also known as the home town of his wife, Roxy Nurse.

&quot;Everyone is going to be watching,&quot;McNabb said this week.&quot;We have the Nurse family that is obviously well represented out there.

&quot;Hamilton has been part of my life through marriage and we have a big fan base out there. It is going to be exciting for them on Super Bowl Sunday.&quot;

McNabb met Nurse while both attended Syracuse University. Nurse, an outstanding high school player in Hamilton, was on the women&apos;s basketball team while McNabb played for the Orange in both football and hoops.

 Vick vs. McNabb: One for the ages 

 Athletic QBs are changing the pro game 

By Paul Newberry
The Associated Press

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. - Michael Vick first met Donovan McNabb on a recruiting trip to Syracuse.They had dinner together, and Vick stayed at McNabb&apos;s apartment. A friendship was born.

&quot;He&apos;s hilarious,&quot;Vick said.

When it came time to pick a college, however, Vick had no desire to follow in McNabb&apos;s footsteps. Vick signed with Virginia Tech, where he had a brief but stunning career. In his first season as an NFL starter, he&apos;s a Pro Bowl quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.

On Saturday night, their paths will cross again. Vick and the Falcons travel to Philadelphia to take on McNabb&apos;s Eagles, a playoff game that could wind up being a milestone in both players&apos; careers.

&quot;Michael Vick and Donovan McNabb, what a great show!&quot;Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan said.&quot;Everybody is going to be on their tippy-toes to see who&apos;s the better player.&quot;

McNabb was drafted second overall by Philadelphia in 1999; Vick made it to the NFL two years later as the No.1 pick. They are trendsetters, helping bury the prejudices against black quarterbacks and proving the fastest guy on the field doesn&apos;t have to be a receiver or running back.

&quot;When I first came in,&quot;McNabb said,&quot;it opened up the doors for a lot of other players who had dreams to play on this level.&quot;

McNabb, a two-time Pro Bowler, broke his right ankle Nov.17 and missed the final six games of the regular season. Philadelphia earned a first-round playoff bye, giving McNabb an extra week to heal. He insists his entire repertoire will be available Saturday.

The 6-foot-2, 226-pound McNabb has put on some extra pounds since he has been in the NFL, helping him absorb the pounding a pro quarterback takes, but taking away a bit of his speed.

&quot;I&apos;m probably a step faster,&quot;said Vick.

Last week, Vick led the Falcons to a 27-7 victory over the Green Bay Packers, who lost a home playoff game for the first time.

 Mount Carmel prepared McNabb 
Sunday, October 3, 2004

By CHUCK GORMLEY
Courier-Post Staff

Mike Daigler laughs at the notion that if Donovan McNabb had gone somewhere other than Mount Carmel High School he might be the quarterback at Soldier Field today, leading the Eagles or some other NFL team against the Chicago Bears.

&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot;said Daigler, who was McNabb&apos;s backup quarterback at the all-boys parochial school on Chicago&apos;s South Side.&quot;Coach Frank (Lenti) always tells people, I&apos;m the one who taught Donovan all he knows. It&apos;s not true, but it is funny.&quot;

Daigler graduated from Mount Carmel in 1995, one year after McNabb, and went on to Notre Dame. He is now a history teacher and student activities director at Mount Carmel, which has a student body of 750.

McNabb went on to Syracuse University, where he earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in speech communications and minored in African-American studies. He&apos;s now in his sixth year as quarterback of the Eagles, but his allegiance to Mount Carmel remains strong.

&quot;Mount Carmel prepares you not only for college, but for life and the responsibilities it carries,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;For a lot of us who went there, we went in with an open mind and came out with an idea of what we wanted to do in life.&quot;

It&apos;s been 10 years since graduating from Mount Carmel and McNabb now donates thousands of dollars each year to his alma mater. In 2000, he established the Donovan McNabb Golden Arm Scholarship, awarded to students with a 2.5 grade-point average or better based on essays they submit about their lives.

&quot;We&apos;re very grateful for what Donovan has done for this school,&quot;said Father Carl Markelz, the 42-year-old principal at Mount Carmel.&quot;Obviously, he is a tremendous quarterback. But first and foremost he is an excellent human being. His parents (Sam and Wilma) were very instrumental in his guidance and direction.&quot;

Sam McNabb, a retired electrical engineer, and his wife, Wilma, a registered nurse, still live in Chicago. Sam recently started Seado Enterprises, an information and referral program that assists high school football players in their pursuit of colleges. He is also founder of the NFL Fathers&apos; Association. Wilma, who appears in Campbell&apos;s Soup commercials with Donovan, oversees her son&apos;s endorsements and is vice president of the NFL Mothers&apos; Association.

Wilma McNabb planned on treating the Eagles to a buffet dinner at their hotel this weekend.

&quot;It&apos;s always special when you have an opportunity to come home and even more when you get a chance to play at Soldier Field,&quot;said McNabb, who played his final high school game there.&quot;Soldier Field to me was one of the best stadiums in the NFL and the Bears were a team I wanted to play for growing up. All I hear is how come I wasn&apos;t drafted by them, which was not my decision.&quot;

In visits to Soldier Field as the Eagles quarterback, McNabb has gone 2-0, completing 44 of 73 passes for 471 yards and two touchdowns. A calm influence

It was in South Chicago that McNabb&apos;s ability to play quarterback became evident. Under Lenti, Mount Carmel ran a veer triple option and McNabb played it to perfection.

&quot;In the offense we ran, the quarterback makes a lot of quick decisions on the run,&quot;Daigler said,&quot;so you had to show composure. If the team was a little panicky, he&apos;d calm the players down by cracking a joke in the huddle. But Donovan also had a real competitive edge to him.&quot;

Simeon Rice, now a defensive end with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was two years ahead of McNabb at Mount Carmel. He remembers a hard-nosed sophomore backup who made things happen when he took over for the starter late in a lopsided game.

&quot;Back then we couldn&apos;t wait for our No. 1 QB to come out of the game so we could see Donovan do some crazy feats,&quot;said Rice, a 1992 graduate of Mount Carmel.&quot;Man, he could run the football.&quot;

McNabb said his evolution from an option quarterback at Mount Carmel and Syracuse to a pocket passer with the Eagles has not been as dramatic as people suggest, saying Andy Reid&apos;s West Coast offense has never restricted his running ability.

&quot;Coach Reid has given me the green light ever since I started running this offense of doing what I&apos;m capable of doing,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;People are seeing that I can sit in the pocket and pass the ball. I guess I erased that whole theory of me not being a pocket passer.&quot;

Perhaps, but it is McNabb&apos;s ability to escape the pocket that makes him more versatile than most quarterbacks.

McNabb enters today&apos;s game with the NFL&apos;s third-best quarterback rating (122), behind only the Vikings&apos; Daunte Culpepper and the Jets&apos; Chad Pennington. He already has thrown for 931 yards and eight touchdowns. The best?

&quot;He is the best quarterback in this league,&quot;Rice said.&quot;He came to a team that wasn&apos;t good at all, almost last in the NFC in offense, and took them to the championship game three times with no big players on his offense.

&quot;He&apos;s better than Peyton Manning. Better than Tom Brady. He kept that team alive. Now he&apos;s got some guys to throw to and people are noticing.&quot;

Terrell Owens certainly has. The wide receiver said no other NFL quarterback could have thrown the pass he caught from McNabb in the season opener against the Giants, when McNabb threw across his body just before leaping out of bounds.

&quot;Any other quarterback, I don&apos;t think they would&apos;ve had the ability to escape (Michael) Strahan at that point,&quot;Owens said.

&quot;To have the poise and presence of mind not to go out of bounds, and to have a strong enough arm to throw across his body and find a guy . . . Those are things I&apos;ve been wanting pretty much since I&apos;ve been with the 49ers filling the void of Jerry Rice.

&quot;I always envisioned myself with a quarterback such as Donovan. Steve (Young) got knocked out of games early, late in his career. I wasn&apos;t able to blossom with him. Jeff (Garcia) was limited with some of the things he could do. With Donovan I have all those things with one guy. I&apos;m blessed to have him.&quot;Receiving praise

McNabb could say the same about his array of receivers. In just three games this season, all wins, he has thrown to nine different receivers, averaging 12.5 yards a reception.

&quot;He has so many weapons, I&apos;m pretty sure he has a hard time deciding who he wants to throw the ball to,&quot;Owens said.&quot;It&apos;s like having Baskin Robbins right there in front of you.&quot;

McNabb agrees.

&quot;I enjoy looking around the huddle,&quot;he said,&quot;and seeing guys with wide eyes just waiting for an opportunity to catch the ball or make a big block.&quot;

Eagles tight end Chad Lewis said McNabb&apos;s greatest gift is not his athleticism; it is his decisive leadership in those huddles.

&quot;As long as he&apos;s been here he&apos;s been the leader and that&apos;s undisputed,&quot;Lewis said.&quot;That&apos;s how it is here. He has everyone&apos;s respect. Every person in this locker room knows he&apos;s going to lay it on the line for us every week and that&apos;s what makes people want to lay it on the line for him.&quot;

Daigler said McNabb had that same respect at Mount Carmel, and not only on the football field. Daigler remembers going to a high school dance at a nearby all-girls school and knowing no one there but McNabb. They hung together all night, along with their dates, and became good friends.

Off-season ordeal

Donovan McNabb talks in a one-on-one interview about T.O. and knocks he has taken since the Super Bowl.
 
By Bob Brookover

INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

&quot;Philadelphia is the only city where you can experience the thrill of victory and the agony of reading about it the next day.&quot;
- Mike Schmidt

Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb can relate, and on a much more grand and grinding scale than the Phillies&apos; Hall of Fame third baseman.

No, the Eagles didn&apos;t win their first trip to the Super Bowl in 24 years, but they did have one of the most successful seasons in franchise history, setting a record with 13 regular-season victories and reaching the Super Bowl for the first time in 24 years.

But for McNabb, there has been plenty of agony since the Feb. 6 loss to the New England Patriots, beginning with the scrutiny of what happened in the final minutes of the team&apos;s Super Bowl loss and continuing with personal assaults from wide receivers Terrell Owens and Freddie Mitchell.

&quot;It has been a challenging [off-season] away from football,&quot;McNabb admitted last week after a workout at the Eagles&apos; practice facility.

This could have been, and perhaps should have been, the most enjoyable off-season of McNabb&apos;s career. He finally conquered the NFC championship game hurdle and achieved career bests with a 64 percent completion percentage, 31 touchdown passes, and a 104.0 passer rating. All of the above should have made this a special break between seasons.

&quot;You would think so,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;You&apos;d think guys would just be trying to stay physically fit or participating in different events and having a great time. But it has been a challenging one because you never want to go through something where you are constantly talking about somebody or what they said or what they decided to do. You&apos;d prefer to come in, focus on camp, do some interviews and go home.&quot;

Instead, McNabb has listened to critics condemn his running of the hurry-up offense against the Patriots. He has listened to Owens accuse him of being&quot;tired&quot;in the NFL&apos;s biggest game. He has listened to a deposed Mitchell accuse him of not throwing the ball his way. Owens has inferred and Mitchell has referred to the quarterback as the&quot;company man.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&apos;t say I was blindsided, but it was kind of shocking,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;Just talking to other guys who have played the game, they will tell you that things happen. It doesn&apos;t happen all the time when you go to the Super Bowl. Sometimes it happens during the course of the season. I think the way to handle it is to keep everything in house, communicating with that person or people involved.&quot;

McNabb said he and Owens have spoken and reached a peace accord.

&quot;I talked to him after the first minicamp&quot;in early May, he said.&quot;We communicated and put everything in the air. I&apos;m fine. We dealt with things, and I&apos;m looking forward to getting out there with him.&quot;

Still, McNabb doesn&apos;t know if or when that might happen because Owens, looking for a new contract after only one season with the Eagles, appears that he will sit out for as long it takes.

&quot;We&apos;re fine, at least from my part,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about upstairs or whatever is going on with that. I told him that is none of my concern. I don&apos;t get involved in anyone else&apos;s contract or financial business because that&apos;s nothing I would want anyone to get involved with me. But from my side of things, as far as what was going on, we&apos;re fine.&quot;

McNabb said he received an apology from Owens even though he never asked for one.

&quot;He apologized, but that&apos;s not what I was looking for,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I just wanted to get things out in the open and kind of see where he was and make sure we were on the same page.&quot;

During their conversation, McNabb invited Owens to Arizona, where he lives in the off-season, for a chance to work out and work on their passing connection, which resulted in 77 completions for 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns a year ago.

&quot;I&apos;ve definitely brought it to his attention, and we&apos;ll see where it&apos;s at,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;I&apos;m here, and guys will show up. If he does, that would be great.&quot;

Owens was not available for comment, and his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, declined to comment on anything dealing with the wide receiver and the Eagles.

Though this has been a trying off-season for McNabb in many ways, he remains positive about where things are headed for the Eagles, and said his personal life has never been better.

&quot;The anticipation is growing as far as what can happen this year,&quot;he said.&quot;We have the firepower and we have the weapons. We&apos;re working on the chemistry. Guys have come back with a whole new attitude.&quot;

McNabb said he never looked back at the Super Bowl loss.

&quot;I know I could have eliminated those [three] interceptions and it could have been a whole different ball game,&quot;he said.&quot;But I&apos;m not going to go back and watch to see exactly what it is I did wrong. It was the last game, and we lost. We learn from it and move on. I&apos;ve pretty much flushed everything out. I do run into Tom Brady or someone from the Patriots every now and then, and then it comes back to me.&quot;

The lesson to be learned from the Super Bowl is that it&apos;s not easy making a return trip to the big game. The last four losers of the game have had losing records the following season, and even the Patriots stumbled to a losing record after winning their first Super Bowl during the 2001 season.

&quot;Talking to Tom and those guys, after they won their first Super Bowl, it was a tough season for them the next year. They started out hot and kind of tailed off. I talked to Tom to try to find out what happened, so I can prepare myself to try to change it. He said some guys got complacent and relaxed.&quot;

Sunday, McNabb will celebrate his first Father&apos;s Day with daughter Alexis, who will be 9 months old this week.

&quot;I&apos;ve been pumping that up,&quot;he said with a relaxed laugh.&quot;I think I&apos;m going to put some signs up around the house. We&apos;ll have a lot of fun with it. Hopefully I won&apos;t get a tie that says, &apos;No. 1 Dad.&apos;&quot;

Fatherhood has been an adjustment for McNabb, but one that he obviously loves.

&quot;Sometimes I hate traveling so much because I&apos;m away from her,&quot;he said.&quot;Once she gets older, she&apos;ll be able to travel more with me, but right now it&apos;s kind of tough being consistently away from her.&quot;

McNabb said he also has been amused by the Saturday Night Live parodies of himself and his mother. The first was aired the night before the Super Bowl, and the second was during a show in which the Patriots&apos; Brady was the guest host.

The show whiffed on his mother&apos;s name, but McNabb said cast member Kenan Thompson looked a lot like his mother.

&quot;I thought it was extremely funny,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;We talk to my mom all the time about &apos;how you let a guy look like you.&apos; I mean, he looks like my mom. That&apos;s bad to say, but we laugh about it. The guy who plays me [Finesse Mitchell] doesn&apos;t look anything like me, but the other guy [Seth Meyers] looks just like Peyton Manning.

&quot;Back when I was younger, I laughed at everything like that. I thought, &apos;I hope they never do me like that.&apos; I&apos;ve talked to Tom about it. I said, &apos;How&apos;d you let them do me like that?&apos; We can laugh about it.&quot;

There&apos;s nothing wrong with a good laugh in the midst of an off-season filled with undeserved turbulence.

 A SON&apos;S MISSION
 
By Ashley McGeachy Fox

Inquirer Staff Writer

Donovan McNabb learned his father had diabetes during his junior year at Syracuse. It was in November 1997, and Wilma and Sam McNabb were scheduled to attend one of their son&apos;s games. Instead, Sam McNabb ended up in the hospital.

&quot;It kind of devastated me,&quot;the Eagles quarterback said on Thursday.

As a result, the main focus of the Donovan McNabb Foundation has been to raise awareness and money for diabetes. This weekend, McNabb hosted a gala charity dinner, and yesterday he and several NFL players and coaches taught a free football clinic for 250 boys and girls at the NovaCare Complex.

At the Eagles&apos; indoor practice bubble, the children, each wearing a green No. 5 jersey, cycled through seven stations. They learned the mechanics of the quarterback position, how to kick a field goal, how to catch a football, and how to play defense.

On hand helping McNabb was Eagles running back Brian Westbrook, who received a raucous ovation from the kids. Also in attendance were St. Louis wide receiver Torry Holt, Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair, Detroit defensive tackle Shaun Rogers, Jacksonville defensive tackle Marcus Stroud, Tennessee linebacker Keith Bulluck, and free agent defensive back Ray Buchanan, formerly with Oakland.

While Sam McNabb led the three-hour clinic, Donovan McNabb was followed by a crew from NFL Films. With his wife, 8-month-old daughter, and mother seated on the outskirts of the field, McNabb visited with the children and laughed with his NFL colleagues.

&quot;This is a special time for all of us,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;What a special feeling right now, the day before Father&apos;s Day, my first Father&apos;s Day, and a special day for my father. He&apos;s in charge of the clinic, and I have no say-so at all about what&apos;s going on. He told me to get over there with the quarterbacks and move around and do my job. I can&apos;t argue with that.

&quot;You love your father and respect your father. I just don&apos;t want him to take his belt off and whup me in front of all my friends.&quot;

A renowned jokester, McNabb was kidding, of course. But dealing with diabetes has not been a laughing matter for him or his family.

Sam McNabb called his diagnosis&quot;a major blow,&quot;and remembers his son&apos;s reaction.

&quot;Donovan was at a sensitive stage in his life where he wanted a perfect scenario,&quot;Sam McNabb said.&quot;As much as we like that to happen, life affords us adversities and other turns that we have to adjust to. That just happened to be one.&quot;

Sam McNabb had to significantly alter his diet, staying away from carbohydrates, among other things, and he added an exercise program to his daily routine. He also takes insulin injections.

&quot;It&apos;s not the end of life,&quot;Sam McNabb said.

&quot;It was such a change in my life,&quot;he added.&quot;Once I found out what it was, it was just a matter of doing the right things to make sure that we stayed in compliance with it. That&apos;s where we are right now. We&apos;re doing a good job of controlling it, but we still have a lifestyle to live. We have to do some things differently, in terms of our eating habits and exercise. That&apos;s for anybody else who comes in contact with this disease.&quot;

Including the 28-year-old quarterback. Although McNabb has no symptoms of diabetes, he knows that the disease is hereditary.

Asked if he is worries that he might develop the disease, McNabb said,&quot;I do.

&quot;I try to consistently work out and watch what I eat and try to eliminate some of the causes,&quot;he added.&quot;Anytime you have to take five minutes out of your time just to poke yourself with a needle, you don&apos;t want anyone to have to go through that.&quot;

Not your father, and not your son. That&apos;s what this weekend was all about for the McNabbs.

 Donovan McNabb&apos;s Remarks at Weight Room Ground Breaking Ceremony
 
Donovan McNabb Press Conference Quotes
May 13, 2005

I just want to talk about some different things. Obviously we know why we are here. I just want to reflect and give a little insight on why I take pride in this particular issue and why my wife, Roxi, takes pride in it. Back in 1994 when I was recruited to come to Syracuse, I remember sitting down and talking to Kevin Rogers, George DeLeone and Paul Pasqualoni. What we talked about was my goal. My goal was to come to Syracuse University and win championships. My goal was to come to Syracuse and receive my degree. My goal at Syracuse was to be a better person when I leave here and be a better man. All of those dreams came true. After I left Syracuse, I talked to some of the underclassmen and told them hard work pays off, as does being determined, goal setting, making sure you are out-working the guy next to you. That doesnt mean just getting on the football field and making plays. That means being in the classroom and doing extra work. That means spending time in the weight room, spending time in the film room, sitting down and talking to your coaches to eliminate mistakes. Sitting down and talking to my wife, who was a basketball player (at SU), and we just talked about each others motivation and they were somewhat similar. We talked about the opportunity we had here, meeting great friends and making sure that we continue to push each other and have that drive and that vision that Daryl (Gross) talked about, and having that commitment as Coach Robinson talked about. And it all starts now.

When we all sat down and talked about something in which we could take another step forward and the weight room came up, I jumped right on it. This weight room is something special to me because, coming from Chicago where the weight rooms are just as big as our meeting rooms here at Syracuse, I had an opportunity to get in the weight room and venture into different things. At this particular point, it is hard to get me out of the weight room. Thats because I just have the mentality that I feel that Im doing something that someone else is not doing. My goal is to be the best football player who has ever played my position. The only way that that can possibly happen is if Im outworking the guy next to me or the guy who is in the weight room or outworking the guy who is sitting down writing his goals down. If its in the weight room lifting weights, if it is pushing the guy next to you, if it is talking to the coach and just explaining the vision, that is something that I take pride in. And I have that in my heart that this weight room is not only to push us to a better team, this is going to boost us to winning championships.

For the team that we have here, we have some great athletes. Im just kind of the fourth piece of the puzzle with this weight room. We brought in a heck of a coach in Greg Robinson. And I do remember that game in Kansas City. It didnt turn out as well as you wanted it to, but it worked well for us. You sit back and you hear Coach Robinson talk. He is a philosopher. He sits down and breaks different things down for the kids to understand his goals, his determination, his vision. I know that in his heart, when he gets the guys out on the football field to prepare for games, in the end, there will be a championship brought here to Syracuse University.

Talking to Daryl through the whole process of who we wanted to bring in and his attitude toward it. I remember telling him, Hey, this isnt USC, its a better University. Although they may have national championships, now you are going to be with us so expect to bring a little bit of that flavor here. We talked about the vision. We talked about where it all will start. And we talked about Coach Robinson. Even before the decision was made, he felt great about bringing Coach Robinson in and the attitude about the defense and the offensive mentality and the special teams. And bringing the winning tradition back to Syracuse. It is something, as a player, you get excited about. When I was talking to Daryl throughout the process, after we got off the phone, I picked up the phone and talked to guys like Keith Bulluck, Marvin Harrison, Kevin Johnson, guys who have moved on to the NFL who I had the opportunity to play with. We know there were tough times watching, but we still bleed orange. I told them about the vision and the things we planned on doing here at Syracuse University. The guys are truly excited. Its something special to be a part of right now.

Again, I say that I am very excited about this. This is something in which we all need to be excited about. Not just because this is a weight room, but this is a building block to where we want to go. I was just sitting back as Coach Robinson was talking and those diamonds just continue to shine on his finger (from his Super Bowl ring), I will have one of those soon.

Question and Answer Session:
 [What does it mean to you to be able to give back to the program?
/b]
It does mean a lot. It means a lot to come back here and its something I take pride in. My wife wasnt able to make it this time. We try to come around and we make our first stop and eat Acropolis pizza and go down to our favorite, Marshall Street, and just reminisce a little bit. To come back over here to the facility (Manley Field House), as I was telling a couple of the equipment managers here that I just felt like I wanted to go in the weight room and start working out already. Its an attitude that you have to have. Anytime that you come back to a place where it all starts, it gets your blood flowing.

[b]How necessary do you feel that a new weight room is to the football program?
 
I probably have the most experience out of everyone as far as weight rooms are concerned. When I was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles, we had just about everything in Veteran Stadium. All of the weights were pretty much just set in the closet. Coming from Syracuse where you get a chance to move around and grab a couple of different things, it was kind of a wake-up call. We moved over now to the Nova Care Facility where I believe it is over 5,000 square feet as far as the weight room is concerned. That is extremely big. Just working out in there and being able to move around is something that you miss. When you are in the weight room, that keeps your drive and determination going to get out there and work extremely hard and give all that you have. I think this is very important for the success for the Syracuse Orange and where we want to go.

 If the weight room is one of the building blocks, what are some of the others?
 For me, just looking over things, obviously it started with the Chancellor coming in and the things that she has been able to do so far and the vision and what she plans to do as the years continue on. Then it was hiring Daryl after Jake (Crouthamel) decided to retire. Daryl has come in with a vision of changing things around and trying to get into his mind that hes not at USC anymore. Its kind of tough. I know this sunshine is bringing him home. It may snow soon so it will bring him back. Then hiring Coach Robinson. Thats why I say Im the fourth piece of the puzzle where things have fallen into place. We have had some success with just some the things we have been able to do so far. I just see this as a continuation of the process.

 Will a new weight room make a difference with recruits?
 I think it does. Its no different than as a free agent in the NFL. You come with your parents thats the only difference. You come with your parents, youre going around the University campus, you are seeing Newhouse and the Sims Building. You are going through all of these buildings and talking about getting your degree and what you can get your degree in, where we rank as far as student-athletes graduating. But you want to see where your son is going to be. This kind of a home away from home. If it is a comfortable environment, a comfortable setting where you feel comfortable bringing your kid here and coming to visit on the weekend to watch him play and knowing that he is here at a place like this, you feel very confident about your decision to come to Syracuse. I think this will attract some of the better athletes across the nation which will lead us to bringing championships home.

 What drives you to come back to SU?
 I dont know, maybe its because I bleed orange. Just talking amongst the guys who graduated from here who I played with or guys who played before me, guys like Reggie Terry, Rob Burnet, Rob Moore. Just seeing the progress weve been making, the energy just continues to rise. Guys are excited to watch Syracuse football on television or possibly come back to the Dome to see an event. You just feel the need to reflect back on the great times that you had here, up on South Campus or being on Marshall Street or being in the Dome winning against Virginia Tech or the University of Miami or whatever it may be. That is something that, no matter what sport you played, it is basketball or field hockey or lacrosse, that is something that you have to have after leaving this place.

 How important is it to you to be part of this program? 
You have to respect the past. Ive been gone now for seven years. Its not as long as some of the other guys here. It is memorable because its not just what you have done, its what the guys have done before you. The guys who have paved the way for you. You cant act like you are the guy who lit the torch and now the younger guys are carrying it now. The torch was lit before us. Its our job to continue the legacy. While I was here, it was big that we were able to carry on the legacy that Marvin Graves carried on, that Kirby DarDar carried on. Even before then, Jim Brown and Floyd Little and Ernie Davis guys like that who have worked extremely hard to bring championships here. Working well in the community where its not just that you are seeing a guy on television, you are seeing him out in the community shaking hands and just talking to kids. Those kids who they may have talked to when they were in college maybe are guys you see here guys who were driven to be the next Ernie Davis, to be the next Marvin Graves, to be the next Donovan McNabb. Those guys are the ones you are watching now. It is exciting to see where those guys are going to go and they will influence.

Yep, Roxi certainly made her mark at Syracuse. She was the heart and soul of women&apos;s basketball there, and a great student-athlete.

i dont remember where i found this:

 The McNabb corner 

The Eagles are crediting KYW-TV (Channel 3) weathercaster Kathy Orr with guiding the Lincoln Financial Field&apos;s crew through that snowstorm last weekend. Eagles chief operating officer Joe Banner says 400 workers were sitting down to a meal when Orr reported that the storm was in a lull and that it was the right time to start clean-up. All 400 got up and got digging. Banner and quarterback Donovan McNabb taped CBS3 promos. McNabb rhapsodizes:&quot;Kathy Orr&apos;s the wind beneath our wings.&quot;

Four-month-old Alexis McNabb will be wearing a custom-made hand-knit sweater, hat and pants set from the Children&apos;s Boutique (1702 Walnut St.). It&apos;s in Eagles green and has a number 5. Owner Linda Berman will not disclose the price.

 &apos;Sheed gets the boot 

Remember the scene during the first night of Monday Night Football when Rasheed Wallace and his posse were hooting and hollering as the Tampa Bay Bucs whipped the Eagles 17-0? Being from Philly, you&apos;d think &apos;Sheed might be an Eagles fan, but he&apos;s not. Here&apos;s a little background on how Wallace got in the McNabb&apos;s luxury box, and why he was asked to leave:

Wilma (McNabb) welcomes almost anyone who asks to the family&apos;s skybox. During the Eagles&apos; season-opening loss to Tampa Bay, Sean McNabb invited Rasheed Wallace of the Portland Trail Blazers. Though he&apos;s a Philadelphia native, Wallace is an avid Buccaneers fan.

The crowd in the McNabb box grew quieter and quieter as the Eagles got pounded - except for Wallace and his posse, who whooped at every play. That was when Wilma&apos;s fury got the better of her.

&quot;I told Sean to round up those people, put them on that short bus, and send them home,&quot;she says.&quot;From now on I have a rule: No enemies in the camp.&quot;

 Mama McNabb has Word of Warning 

February 4, 2005 While Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb is getting ready for the biggest game of his life, his celebrity mother says she tried to steer him away from football.

Wilma McNabb was a guest Thursday night on the Jimmy Kimmel Show seen on Channel 6.
Mama McNabb told the host she&apos;s always been afraid her son might get hurt playing football.

And she had a word of warning for any Patriots who might try to rough her boy up Sunday.

&quot;You get mad at the players when they tackle him?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;You do? You ever say anything to them?&quot;

&quot;I know who hits them and if see them in the Pro Bowl or see them later, I do say something.&quot;

&quot;You do?&quot;

The message is clear. You don&apos;t wanna&apos; mess with mama McNabb.

Well, for some reason it&apos;s become unpopular in the black community to show that you&apos;re smart. (Well, I guess it&apos;s become unpopular all over - just look at Paris Hilton, lol.) Unfortunately when you talk proper and show that you&apos;re smart, you get labled a dork or a&quot;sellout&quot;- look at the way the Gumbel brothers are made fun of.

 Company man 

By REUBEN FRANK
phillyBurbs.com

Nonstop road trips.

Not enough time with his family. Fifteen-hour workdays.

Welcome to Donovan McNabb&apos;s world.

His offseason world.

The last few months have been just as hectic as the regular season for McNabb. His personality off the field, his performance on the field and his squeaky-clean image have combined to make McNabb one of the most marketable athletes in professional sports.

&quot;Having a good image and being somebody that [companies] want to use, that means a lot to me,&quot;McNabb said.&quot;The travel is tough and being away from my family is tough, but I enjoy the endorsements and appearances, meeting people I wouldn&apos;t get to meet, seeing places I wouldn&apos;t get to see. I make sure I have a lot of fun with it.&quot;

McNabb has lucrative deals with Reebok, Lincoln Financial, Campbell&apos;s, Pepsi, EA Sports, Hershey, Visa and the International Dairy Foods Association.

He does charity work on behalf of NFL Youth Football and J.C. Penney&apos;s&quot;Take a Player to School&quot;program and was a guest presenter at the ESPY Awards.

He also oversees the Donovan McNabb Foundation to raise money to fight diabetes and is national spokesman for the American Diabetes Association.

From early July, when he begins focusing full-time on football, until late January or early February, when the season ends, McNabb is wrapped up with his primary job, playing quarterback for the Eagles. That leaves about four months to squeeze in all his other obligations.

And they are squeezed.

&quot;I&apos;m everywhere,&quot;McNabb said with a laugh in a recent interview.&quot;My frequent flier miles are outstanding right now.

&quot;It can get a little crazy. I make sure I&apos;m home and spend enough time with my family. That&apos;s my No. 1 priority during the offseason. I try to mix it up. If I&apos;m away for a week, then I make sure I&apos;m home the next week. If I can, I take the family with me, although that&apos;s not always possible. You can&apos;t keep dragging a baby all over the country. The toughest thing is going to be when my daughter is older and keeps begging me, &apos;Daddy, take me with you.&apos;&quot;

McNabb, wife Raquel Nurse and daughter Alexis - who is 22 months old - are based in the Phoenix area during the offseason.

But McNabb has flown more than 40,000 miles since the Super Bowl ended to fulfill all his various business obligations, most notably appearances as cover boy for EA Sports&apos; Madden 2006 video game.

&quot;You&apos;re home for three days, they fly you off to Toronto for a weekend, then to New York for a few days, then back home for four days, then to L.A. - it&apos;s kind of like playing baseball and the road trips those guys have. Three days in one city, three days in another city, then maybe you&apos;re home for a week.

&quot;The toughest thing about all the travel is watching what you eat and making sure you get a workout in. At the hotel, I&apos;ll go down to the little gym and get on the treadmill with all the lawyers and businessmen, just to get some kind of workout in while I&apos;m away from home. You have to take care of that stuff.&quot;

Three years ago, McNabb signed a 12-year contract extension worth $108,812,724, a deal that at the time made him the highest-paid player in NFL history. He earns an average of $9.068 million per year on the field and about another $5 million in endorsements.

But McNabb is careful not to overdo it. He turns down more than he accepts and makes sure he spends quality time with his family, both in Arizona and on vacation.

&quot;I turn down a lot, including some stuff people would be really surprised to hear,&quot;he said.&quot;You have to. You can&apos;t take everything. It&apos;s tough because they&apos;re offering you a lot of money, but it would be too much. You have to be able to say no.&quot;

Much of the offseason hoopla was centered around McNabb&apos;s association with Madden 2006, the best-selling video game in the United States McNabb&apos;s selection to appear on the cover was the strongest sign yet that he&apos;s entered the sports marketing elite.

&quot;He&apos;s as widespread as anybody [in the NFL] right now, right there with Peyton [Manning] and Michael [Vick],&quot;said Nova Lanktree, who handles endorsements for McNabb as vice president of player marketing at CSMG Sports outside Chicago.&quot;The thing about Donovan is that he&apos;s so genuine. There&apos;s a real strength and beauty in not faking it, and when somebody is really authentic, people sense that and are drawn to it.

&quot;Donovan feels truly blessed with his life. There&apos;s just something whole and right with him, and that comes across in everything he does.&quot;

Whether he&apos;s playing football for the Eagles, promoting Madden 2006 or doing charity work, one thing remains the same.

The image.

&quot;That&apos;s very important to me and very important to my family,&quot;he said.&quot;It means a lot to me that it&apos;s always a positive image. I&apos;m just a guy who goes through life laughing and joking. Wherever people see me - in a commercial or in the Super Bowl - I just want to get across that I&apos;m just like them.&quot;

As busy as McNabb&apos;s offseason was, everything slowed down a few weeks ago. McNabb&apos;s fundamental rule is that when it&apos;s time to prepare for football, nothing gets in the way.

McNabb is scheduled to report to Eagles training camp at Lehigh University in Bethlehem a week from Monday. The Eagles this year will be seeking a sixth straight playoff berth, a fifth straight appearance in the NFC Championship Game and a second straight trip to the Super Bowl.

&quot;I don&apos;t do anything in July,&quot;he said.&quot;I took two weeks totally off after the Super Bowl and then I shut it all down at the end of June. Now, it&apos;s time to play football.&quot;

 TRY LIKE AN EAGLE
 by ASHLEY JUDE COLLIE


DONOVAN MCNABB LOVES EXPERIMENTING WITH NEW RESTAURANTS IN HIS ADOPTED HOMETOWN OF PHILADELPHIA. BUT HE HASNT FOUND ANYWHERE THAT MAKES HIS MOTHERS RED BEANS AND RICE.

As an All-Pro quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, Donovan McNabb has put himself in a position to be remembered alongside some of the citys sports greats Hall of Fame names like Julius Dr. J Erving, Mike Schmidt, and Bobby Clarke. Since joining the team in 1999, his No. 5 jersey has been a wardrobe requirement for any serious sports fan in Philadelphia. Hes become as synonymous with the city as cheesesteaks and the Liberty Bell. Hes also become a part of another Philadelphia tradition: frustration.

McNabb finally led the Eagles to the Super Bowl last season after previously coming up short in three straight NFC title games. The Eagles streak of futility, however, was much longer than McNabbs: The team hadnt made it to the big game since 1981. After playing it tough against the reigning champion New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX, McNabb and the Eagles fell just short, losing 24-21. The defeat further extended Philadelphias fruitless quest for any major sports championship to 22 years.

The loss sticks in 28-year-old McNabbs craw: He defiantly says the Eagles have some unfinished business to do with [Patriots quarterback] Tom Brady and his boys. Going into his seventh pro season, McNabb yearns to take his adopted city to pro footballs promised land, especially now that he understands the thwarted mind-set of the Eagles die-hard fans. Its the same as his. It just took him some time to catch up.

Since he shares the same burning desire as Philadelphia natives to win, McNabb has at least one qualification when it comes to serving as tour guide for this historically sports-crazed city. McNabb and his family wife Raquel and their infant daughter (McNabb loves taking her to home games at Lincoln Financial Field) are still exploring the city. They like discovering new local attractions and restaurants. McNabb also enjoys unwinding in downtown Philadelphias Old City neighborhood and strolling along Market Street, where Thomas Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence.

McNabb found some time during his busy off-season (which included filming a guest appearance on George Lopez) to toss us some suggestions on where to go and what to do in Philadelphia.

Philly is a big-time sports town thats gone a long time without a championship. How anxious are the fans for a title? Theyre very supportive and very into their own particular sports. You look at other teams across the league and in other sports, the attendance factor is not like it is in Philadelphia, where the games are always sold-out. Were always going to have our fans behind us. Sure, theyre going to express their opinions, but youve got to love that because it keeps you on your game and gets your adrenaline flowing. You just know that people love their football across the Philadelphia area and Pennsylvania. Theyre counting down to opening kickoff and are ready to go. As a player, that gives you added drive and motivation. Lets bring it on.

Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett said that Minneapolis is the best-kept secret in the world. How would you describe Philadelphia? [Laughs] If Kevin Garnett thinks Minneapolis is the best-kept secret, he definitely needs to come to Philadelphia. Youre talking about a great city with a lot of history and culture, with some outstanding sports traditions, like the 76ers with Dr. J., the Phillies with Lenny Dykstra, Ron Jaworski with the Eagles, hockeys Bobby Clarke and his Broad Street Bullies. Youre talking about memorable guys who create legends for a city. People grow up watching this rich tradition, and when theyre older, theyre giving up their hard-earned dollars to be season ticket holders and theyre passing their tickets on to their kids. You cant beat the tradition in Philadelphia. Its a big-league city in every way.

Describe the Super Bowl experience. Your mouth is watering wanting to be there until you finally get that taste in your mouth, and then the experience is hard to explain. When you arrive, youre in awe as you go through media obligations. By Wednesday, thats when you start focusing in on football, and from then on, you treat it as just a normal game.

Not winning the championship, do you feel even more impetus to get back? Believe me, of anyone whos ever played or is playing now, I am probably the most hungry to return to win the whole thing. It just burns in me.

Does that fire burn when youre playing video games as well? I heard it can really get competitive in the Eagles locker room. I play against my brother Sean and my teammates. Its very big in the athletic world. We have TV monitors set up in our Eagles lounge area. Two of the monitors are connected because we have Halo a sci-fi shooter game tournaments, where you have three-on-three matchups. After practice, guys are running in there to get a game in. It gets real intense. If your team loses, youve got to sit it out. Its real funny. The guys are trash-talking, and you get to see some different sides of guys when youre reminding them how bad they played.

Since youre so well known in Philadelphia, where can you go and relax? I like to go on a restaurant tour on weekends, looking for new places to eat in Old City or along the waterfront. Places where I can get a little privacy and just enjoy being downtown. I know some owners of different restaurants and clubs where I can bring my family, maybe to celebrate a big win. Where I dont have to worry about any distractions. But if I tell you, then everyones going to turn up there.

Okay, so what are some of the restaurants you can tell us about? Old City has a cool restaurant scene. I like the Continental. You start with the salad, and its one of those big bowls where they throw different ingredients in, your greens, tomatoes, different cheeses, maybe some seafood. Or maybe they mix you up a big old Caesar. Then you hit the calamari or grilled salmon. If youre into meat, go for the filet mignon. The Continental also has an award-winning martini selection. I also like Tangerine with its Mediterranean food and Kasbah atmosphere. Or go over to the Palm on Broad Street. Its a terrific steak house with huge steaks and chops, real tasty crab cakes, and potatoes cooked in every way.

Any restaurant in the area that comes close to reproducing your moms home cooking? Im biased, but Id have to say no. I just cant get those red beans and rice like Mom makes them, or that macaroni and cheese, you know.

Speaking of, where do you like to take your parents when they visit? They like to go to the Palm, too. Its a classic meat-and-potatoes place.

When you go out with your boys, where do you chow down? Well, you cant bring everyone, because that bill can be pretty expensive with the boys. Well meet up at the Capital Grille on Chestnut. The fish is outstanding. Their steak is tops. You want to make sure your appetizers are well balanced with your main course. Then you top things off with dessert the different chocolate cakes, the killer cheesecakes. [Laughs] Not that Ive tried those, you know? I just kinda look at them.

You said the fans were better in Philly. But how does the food at the stadiums in Philadelphia rate compared with others across the country? The stromboli at the [Wachovia Center], where the 76ers play, cannot be missed. Now thats great Italian fast food.

Whats the best place to get a Philly cheesesteak? Jims Steaks on South Street is legendary. Youve got celebrity testimonials on the walls, and the cheesesteak is the real thing.

If friends are coming into town, what must-see spots do you tell them to hit? Youve got to take them down to Old City, get them walking around there, get a feel for the history Philadelphia was our first capital city. Check out the restaurants. Get their stomachs feeling right.

If theyre staying for the weekend, we might drive over to Atlantic City to check out what real fine entertainment theyve got going on. Or maybe they want to gamble a little. They have great restaurants and hotels over there. Youve got to check out Trump Plaza. Its something you might see out in Vegas, but you wouldnt know it was in Atlantic City.

What hotels do you suggest? I prefer the Loews Hotel, off Market Street. For a more scenic setting, try the Hyatt on Columbus Boulevard near the river.

Where do you like to shop in the city? I get my suits custom-made by Ernesto Custom Clothiers in Philadelphia. I like to go downtown. Its a great shopping area. I like Boyds on Chestnut Street, a very nice clothing store. Theres good shopping going down South Street for whatever you want from athletic gear to dress shoes and evening wear.

What type of live music do you like to listen to? Where do you go to hear it? I love to hear the Roots play you know, rhythm and blues, the instrumental flavor. I go to Warmdaddys for blues and soul, and Zanzibar Blue, a real one-of-a-kind place. They have some real fine jazz up in there. Warmdaddys has some good soul food.

The NFL is the biggest game in town, with its billion-dollar television contracts. What is it like competing at this level? It really is a dream come true. As a kid, youre playing ball in the park with your friends, its the last play in the Super Bowl, and Im going to complete it for a touchdown. Thats the sort of thing that kids always dream about. And for me, those dreams are being lived out, and Im privileged to have had the opportunity.
