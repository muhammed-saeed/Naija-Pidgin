 1200-Calorie-a-Day Diet Plans 
 Apr 16, 2011 | By Andrea Cespedes Photo Credit diet image by siloto from Fotolia.com 
A 1,200-calorie diet includes just enough calories for you to eat the minimum number of servings recommended by the USDA Food Guide Pyramid. Sticking to these minimum servings helps you obtain adequate carbohydrates for energy, protein for muscle support and fat for hormone production and vitamin absorption. Eating fewer than 1,200 calories is not recommended and may be inadequate for men, even those looking to lose weight.
 
Vegetarian Plan

A vegetarian, 1,200-calorie plan can provide you with all the nutrients you need while supporting weight loss. Start with a breakfast of four scrambled egg whites with 1 cup baby spinach and eight grape tomatoes, halved. Have 4 oz. of calcium-fortified orange juice and a toasted whole-grain English muffin alongside. At lunch, have a salad made with 2 cups of romaine lettuce, a small chopped apple, 2 oz. of roasted chicken breast and 1 tbsp. chopped walnuts. Dress with 1 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar mixed with 1 tsp. of honey and 1 tsp. of olive oil. Drink a glass of skim milk as well. At dinner, stir fry 3 oz. of tofu with 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms, 1 tsp. peanut oil, minced garlic, a shredded carrot and 1 cup broccoli. Serve with 1/2 cup brown rice. For snacks, have 8 oz. of non-fat plain yogurt with a small kiwi and 1 cup of puffed rice with 8 oz. of skim milk.
 
Easy Plan

Begin with a serving of whole-grain, no-sugar-added cereal topped with 1/2 cup blueberries and 8 oz. of skim milk. Mid-morning, have a few celery sticks with 1 tbsp. of peanut butter. At lunch, have 4 oz. of roasted tilapia with 1/2 cup of brown rice and 1 cup steamed broccoli. Mid-afternoon, have a snack consisting of 8 oz. of non-fat yogurt and 1/2 of a banana. For dinner, have 3 oz. of rotisserie chicken breast -- skin removed -- with a salad made from a bag of prewashed lettuce, baby carrots and chopped bell pepper. Dress with light Italian dressing and have a serving of whole wheat crackers on the side. For dessert, stir together 4 oz. of non-fat, plain Greek yogurt, 1/2 cup of sliced strawberries and 1 tsp. of honey.
 
On-the-Go Plan

If you have no time to prepare meals, grab a breakfast consisting of an 8-oz. container of plain, non fat yogurt, a banana and 12 almonds on the way out the door. For lunch, order a grilled chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread and a side green salad with light dressing at your local fast food restaurant. For dinner, pick up a California roll from a take-out sushi restaurant and have it with 1/2 cup steamed edamame and 1 cup of miso soup. If you need a snack during the day, skip the soup at dinner and have an orange between meals.
 
Weekend Plan

Sticking to a 1,200-calorie plan can be challenging on the weekends when meals out, happy hour and other events tempt you with high-calorie fare. Although you may be inclined to skip breakfast to save calories for later, this strategy may backfire and leave you extra hungry -- leading to poor choices at your next sitting. Instead, have a light breakfast consisting of a slice of whole-grain toast, 2 tsp. of peanut butter, a glass of skim milk and a small peach. At lunch, have a cup of broth-based soup, such as minestrone or chicken noodle, with a whole-grain roll and a green salad made with baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, red onion and just 1 tsp. of olive oil mixed with balsamic vinegar. For dinner out, order grilled fish with no sauce and have a small baked potato and plain vegetables on the side. Treat yourself to a glass of wine or beer, if you like, or share a dessert with friends -- eat only about one-quarter of it. For an evening movie, have 3 cups of air-popped popcorn tossed with 1 tbsp. Parmesan cheese. During the day, drink an extra 8 oz. of skim milk as a snack to help you meet your calcium needs.
