Chicken Nuggets the Chick-fil-a way and gluten and dairy free
 
 
Even if I could eat gluten and dairy I could not go to my favorite fast food restaurant and get my beloved Chick-fil-a nuggets since they do not have one here in Washington state, boo! So as I was thinking of all my favorite things to eat and wanting these, not to mention having these two young boys I knew if I could make them even a little bit like those yummy chicken nuggets, they would love them too! So I found a recipe a former employee published on the web and subbed out the ingredients and what I came up with was SO SO SO GOOD, and we ate them all! Needless to say these will be a SPECIAL treat meal, not on the regular rotation, much to my husbands dislike we are not getting a fry daddy... But hey, you gotta try these and you won&apos;t be sorry! They weren&apos;t ridiculous to make, took about 30-45 minutes tops.

So here&apos;s the SECRET recipe...

3 cups peanut oil
1 egg
1 cup almond milk
1 cup gluten free flour I use this recipe found here.. http://www.5loavesofbread.blogspot.com/2011_09_01_archive.html 
2-1/2 teaspoons powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons sea salt
8- 10 chicken tenders cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces

 
Chop the chicken tenders to the 1 1/2 inch pieces, then dip them first into the egg and almond milk, and then into the flour, sugar and and seasoning mixture. When the oil reaches desired temp, I used med-high setting and waited about 7 minutes to get the desired temp. Then place the chicken pieces into the oil carefully. And let them brown for a few minutes on each side turning and browning the other side at least once. Once they are golden brown and cooked through place them on a tray with paper towels on top to drain some of the excess oil. Serve with your favorite dipping sauces... DELISH, I promise!!!
