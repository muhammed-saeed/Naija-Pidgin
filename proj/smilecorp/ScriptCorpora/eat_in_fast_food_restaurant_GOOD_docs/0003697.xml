 Teen finds piece of finger in Arby&apos;s sandwich 
 Mike Householder   The Associated Press Last updated Thursday, May 17, 2012 - 3:52pm 
JACKSON, Mich. -- A Michigan teen finishing off an Arby&apos;s roast beef sandwich chomped down on something tough that tasted like rubber, so he spit it out.

Turns out it tasted like finger. The fleshy, severed pad of an unfortunate employee&apos;s finger, apparently.

 Nancy Van Valkenburg   Standard-Examiner Last updated Friday, March 9, 2012 - 12:28am 
BRIGHAM CITY -- Carleton Bluford has played &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; &apos;s Tybalt at Weber State. He played Judas in an Egyptian Theater production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar.&quot;

So the North Ogden actor is fairly comfortable playing characters that are not universally loved, but a recent role took the discomfort to a new level.

Bluford, 27, appeared last Friday in the national broadcast of ABC&apos;s &quot;Primetime: What Would You Do.&quot;

 Gas station in Plain City to become a Maverik 
 Terrie L. Stephenson   Standard-Examiner Last updated Sunday, January 8, 2012 - 12:24am 
PLAIN CITY — The Chevron station will soon become a Maverik store instead and the fast-food restaurant Boone’s will no longer exist, says a planning commissioner.

Once the gas station/store becomes a Maverik, it will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, says Planning Commissioner Blake Neil.

He said there is nothing in city ordinances that prevent it from operating at all hours.

“Maverik’s got a real good presence, but some are not too excited to lose Boone’s,” said Mayor Jay Jenkins.
