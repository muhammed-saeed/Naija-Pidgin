Nerds ToGo

So many individuals and businesses rely on their computers for communication. Furthermore, many businesses simply can not function if their computers are not working properly. As people struggle to keep up with advancing technology, many of them work on computers everyday and still have no idea how to make even the simplest repairs when things go wrong. Of course, this is true because computers and complex machines and someone who is not qualified to work on them should always call for help. Even so, many computer repair stores have a“bring it in and we’ll fix it”sort of approach. Nerds ToGo, however, has revolutionized the computer services industry by offering a“we come to you model.”After all, people do not have the time and energy to break down their computers and take them to the repair shop. Moreover, this would be an impossible task for a small business in need of computer services.

Of course, the best part about owning a Nerds ToGo franchise is that you do not have to be a nerd to own one. Now, if you happen to be a nerd by nature, you can make your own service calls or hire nerd employees. Either way, the secret to success with this innovative franchise opportunity lies in how you manage the business and not just how well you fix computers. What’s more, the Nerds ToGo company offers a great deal of support to help you become a successful franchise business owner. There are a lot of computers out there just waiting to be fixed and with a Nerds ToGo franchise, you can cash in on this opportunity with only a small investment.

College Hunks Hauling Junk

Just like the computer support businesses like Nerds to Go are gaining popularity across the nation, College Hunks Hauling Junk is a great franchise opportunity well on its way to becoming a national brand. The geeks fix computers and the hunks lift heavy things. That sounds about right, doesn’t it?

On a more serious note, don’t let the name fool you into thinking that College Hunks is anything but a great business franchise opportunity that is growing everyday. Furthermore, the junk-removal industry appeals to highly segmented publics, which can translate to great income for franchisees that are affiliated of a nationally recognized brand. College Hunks is a business that appeals to homeowners and small business owners who need items like furniture, appliances, yard waste, construction materials or renovation leftovers removed from their properties and more. The only items that the hunks can not haul are hazardous materials like chemicals, paint, spouses or pets.

And, now that going green and helping the environment is becoming a standard in the U.S., our customers will be happy to hear that everything we haul is recycled, donated or otherwise disposed of properly.

Of course, not only do customers love College Hunks Hauling Junk, franchisees enjoy helpful resources, including a national toll-free number and centralized call center (Customer Loyalty Center), a website where customers can schedule pick-ups online, truck beds that are bigger than those used by competitors, customized propriety software used for scheduling, and finally, a low investment and high potential for business growth.

Pet Butler

This name may not suggest that you are actually looking into a poop scooping business but a Pet Butler franchise is exactly that. Since so many families include pets, particularly dogs, there is a lot of scooping to be done. In fact, 40 percent of all households in the U.S. include at least one dog. However, some pet owners do not have the time, energy or desire to pick up after their pets. Plus, Pet Butler offers not only waste removal services but also pet stations for parks and other public areas.

As a franchise owner, you will be trained to use the most sanitary methods for waste removal. Additionally, the company will provide you with a downloadable training manual, state-of-the-art equipment and even marketing materials. Like so many other business franchises, Pet Butler wants to experience growth, which means the company is willing to help your franchise business operate smoothly and efficiently. And, that’s the scoop.

Boneheads

For the great tasting food served in these innovative restaurant franchises, the secret really is in the sauce. Boneheads features grilled fish and Piri Piri chicken, which is seasoned by the South African Piri Piri pepper. But, the taste is not the only unique flavor of Boneheads. This restaurant franchise also utilizes the increasingly popular concept of fast-casual dining. If you have never dined at a Bonehead’s, perhaps you have been to a Moe’s Southwest Grill, Doc Green’s Gourmet Salads, Planet Smoothie or the Flying Biscuit Caf. These are just a few of the restaurant franchises owned by Raving Brands. And, if the portfolio of delicious dining choices does not convince you that Bonehead’s means serious business, you may be interested to learn that Raving Brands also has real estate expertise. Since location is one of the most important factors in franchise success (if not the most important), a Bonehead’s franchise can mean a leg up on the competition. So, if you have five years of experience working in a restaurant, this is your chance to own one.

ElizaJ

“No thanks, I’ll hold it”is usually the response you hear from someone when their only option is to use a port-o-potty. However, ElizaJ is not your typical port-o-potty business. In fact, it offers three levels of deliverable restrooms with high-quality amenities like designer soaps and lotions, fresh flowers, air fresheners and even fresh water. Now, you might be wondering who would be interested in these new high-class portable restrooms. Take a moment to consider the growing special events industry. So many weddings and other formal events are held outside and nowhere near a restroom. The standard port-o-potty just will not do when it comes to this kind of special event. Instead the typical old John, you need an ElizaJ. And, if you decide to become an ElizaJ franchisee, you will become part a groundbreaking new luxury restroom industry and gain access to an untapped market. What’s more, the ElizaJ company offers all the training and support you will need.

Brick Kicker

This might seem like a funny name for a home inspection company but this catchy name has helped the company become a nationally recognized industry leader. Plus, Brick Kicker offers accurate, trustworthy home inspections to homeowners, buyers and sellers, which means there will always be a demand for these services. The main advantage to entering the home inspection business as a franchisee is that you start off as an established brand. Additionally, you have access to on-going support from the company as well as seminar and conferences to help you build your business, not hit a brick wall. With the right tools, you’re sure to become a successful Brick Kicker franchisee.

Nanny Poppinz

At first glance, the name of this franchise might give the impression that this is just another group of nannies. However, Nanny Poppinz is far more. In fact, this company is a full-service child care referral agency. Not only do they specialize in placing children with the best, most professional nannies, they also help busy moms find childcare outside of the home. What’s more, services offered through Nanny Poppinz include baby nurses, housekeepers, cooks, tutors, butlers, drivers and even household managers. Whether the need is full-time, part-time or temporary, Nanny Poppinz is there to help. Plus, this franchise opportunity is great for entrepreneurs who are looking for a great work from home franchise opportunity. This business franchise is fast and easy to start up because you do not have to worry about the initial cost of inventory. In fact, your nannies are the inventory and the specialized software offered to franchisees makes keeping track simple. Nanny Poppinz makes success simple for everyone who is interested in this exciting business opportunity, even stay-at-home moms looking to start a home-based business franchise.

Froots Smoothies

Now more than ever, eating fresh is all the rage. People are looking for healthier alternatives to traditional eateries who serve greasy food loaded with calories. But, they still want food that tastes great. This is where Froots Smoothies comes in. This restaurant franchise specializes not only in salads, wraps, shakes and smoothies that taste terrific, they also pride themselves on serving foods that are healthy and refreshing. Guests who lunch at Froots can say goodbye to that afternoon sluggishness they feel after a greasy lunch at a traditional fast food restaurant. Froots offers delicious lunch, dinner and snack options and the company is ready to serve its freshness all across the country. That’s where you come in. If you are ready to take advantage of the fresh food frenzy, consider a Froots Smoothies franchise. This company offers training, marketing support and even helps with site selection.

FunBus

This business franchise is literally fun on wheels. In fact, FunBus travels right to your school, birthday party or any other special event. And, it’s filled with progressive gymnastics equipment and a staff that is eager to make physical activity fun, not competitive. What’s more, FunBus will travel to your daycare center or school once a week with instructors who will teach 45-minute lessons to children ages two and a half to six years old!

In a society where parents are faced with warnings of increased childhood obesity and diabetes, the FunBus offers an exciting way for kids to get active and enjoy every minute of it. As the potential franchisee, FunBus offers you the chance to find success as a franchise business owner. Moreover, these fitness academies on wheels are always stocked with the latest and greatest equipment. Plus, FunBus provides its franchisees with a marketing system to help ensure a steady flow of business.

Dogtopia Dog Spa

In 2005, pet-related spending $35 billion, making it the seventh largest sector of retail. In fact, pet spending came in ahead of toys and candy. This increase symbolizes the modern attitude that pets are like“kids”in the family. Because so many pet owners think of themselves as“parent”to these four-legged kiddos, they feel guilty leaving them at home alone all day. After all, they send their children to preschools and daycare centers. Why shouldn’t they do the same for their dogs?

Dogtopia Dog Spas give pet owners the opportunity to leave their dogs in a fun-filled doggie daycare where they will enjoy supervised play and human interaction all day. Plus, Dogtopia even offers do-it-yourself dog washes, spa services, training classes and overnight boarding. And, you’ll find nothing less than premium quality toys, treats, food and grooming supplies. What you need to know as a potential franchisee is that Dogtopia offers on-site assistance and continuous management consulting, marketing materials, a website and a comprehensive training course to help you start of on the right paw.
