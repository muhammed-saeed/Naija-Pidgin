		Places or Settings 
The list of settings--places a story can take place--is almost endless. This is the beginning of a list of places or settings in which you can set a story. Right now my main list is contemporary places. The medieval/fantasy and future/science fiction place lists are pretty sketchy. If you want to add to this list, please do! E-mail me at juliaw-nospam@attglobal.net (of course, remove&quot;-nospam&quot;to use this).
