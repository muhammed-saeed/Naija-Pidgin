 Fast Food Review: 99cent Crispy Chicken Sandwich from Wendy’s 

 May 07, 2009 By: Ryan Category: Chicken , Reviews , Sandwiches 
 
 
 A fast food restaurant’s value menu is a good opportunity to sample a few things at once.  Never quite the center of attention, value menu items are normally mixed and matched because you can essentially build a $3 or $4 meal with a few choices.  Recently I had to match my Wendy’s Double Stack burger with a true value menu item at Wendy’s, the 99¢ Crispy Chicken Sandwich .

 

As I mentioned in my review of the Double Stack , I have no luck actually finding a Wendy’s restaurant that actually sells the burger for less than $1.49.  Don’t get me wrong, it still tastes good, but each bite was a reminder of how obvious corners are being cut at Wendy’s and how inconsistent I have found their menu prices to be.  I see Double Stack ads showing it as 99¢, but I never find it for that price…and I’ve mentioned this before, the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger has shrunk enough to be laughable (screw you 3conomics). The Crispy Chicken Sandwich on the other hand is a reliable and true 99¢ item, and its worth every penny .  From the Wendy’s website menu, the sandwich is a tender, breaded chicken patty topped with crisp lettuce and creamy mayo done Wendy’s way-fresh and delicious .

 

I’m a big fan of the overall freshness of Wendy’s foods.  Yeah, this is only one persons opinion but in my experience, I’ve never had issues with freshness .  While the prices may not be consistent, the familiar taste is.  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich has a decent sized (for the 99¢ price tag) chicken patty that is indeed tender and doesn’t have an overwhelming breading.  Sometimes, smaller chicken patties have a tendency to be dried out, but this one was just fine.  To help out the overall package, the standard lettuce and mayo are included. I love that the lettuce looks like it was just plucked from lettuce head. Always crisp, cool and odd-shaped spilling out of the sandwich.  It’s a great change from, ahem …BK’s consistently limp, sad lettuce.  The lettuce at Wendy’s never gets lost and actually compliments every burger or chicken sandwich I’ve had.  Another thing that is consistently pretty good at Wendy’s is the fresh soft buns they use.  Almost like potato rolls.
 
Look at that flawless bun. Even in pictures it looks fresh and soft.
 
 Overall, the Wendy’s Crispy Chicken Sandwich should be a consistent grubbing option on the Wendy’s value menu. It doesn’t wow you with anything, but it doesn’t really need it.  It’s simple and tasty and the only thing missing is a 99¢ spicy version to rival Burger King’s Spicy Chick’n Crisp Sandwich.

 Pros - Yes it’s really 99¢.  Simple.  Fresh lettuce.  Tasty.  Consistent. Cons - No spicy value menu version. 

 

 Taste:  8.50/10 

 Value:  9.50/10 

 Grubbing on the Go:  8.75/10 

 ————————————————- 

 GrubGrade :  8.50/10  ( Very Good ) 

( Overall GrubGrade is not an average )

 Price : 99 cents

I always want to stop and try some of these“value”chicken sandwich’s but the experience most people seen to have had with McD’s“McDouble”has led me to sterotype the whole lot. I think I ought to give this one a go though.

Can you get tomato and pickles added on?
 1 Reply Ryan says: May 7, 2009 at 8:15 am 
As is, it’s just lettuce/mayo…I’m sure you can get the added tomato/pickle but you might be charged to“deluxe”it up…maybe a quarter or something. That’s what Chick-fil-A does, but it’s an option on their menu board.

I’m a big fan of Wendy’s overall freshness, too. On just a couple of occasions, I’ve had a not-so-fresh chicken sandwich. But the chance of fresh food there is MUCH better than any other burger joint. The crispy chicken sandwich is certainly tasty, and wallet-friendly.

@Adam–I’ve never had Wendy’s charge extra for adding specific toppings in all my fast food dining years. I can’t say for sure if that’s a nationwide thing or not, but it’s never happened at any Wendy’s I’ve been to.

Awesome! You could always add some hot sauce to it! That lettuce looks perfect. This is a good example of how food should look compared to how it’s advertised. I’ve always thought of Wendy’s a fresh….even fresh fingers in their chili…I tease (that actually took place a Wendy’s near me ), crazy people.

Not bad, not bad. I agree, they should have a spicy option, but that might take away form their Spicy Chicken Sandwich?!

@ WIBIA…Yeah…totally agree. The Spicy Chicken is pretty popular, a 99c version would steal it’s thunder. We have a review of the Spicy Chicken and Grilled Chicken Sandwich in the works.

I thought the first sentence said‘A fast food restaurant is only as good as its value menu’, which was a valid point, til I realized it didn’t exist. Might be explained by the fact that I just woke up. I love this sandwich, but there’s a tiny part of me that dislikes it because of a hint of chemical-y flavor

There was a spicy version a few years back! I used to get it religiously in my college days, but it seems it didn’t take off. Truly a shame.

I wish Wendy’s had square chicken patties.

I got a chuckle out of the BK lettuce crack. It blows my mind, that no matter where you go in the country. BK’s lettuce just plain blows. It almost seems like they nuke it along with the cheese.

Ive never tried the value menu chicken sandwich from Wendy’s. When I go there, it’s for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich or a full size double cheeseburger. I’m stuck in a rut with them, but when in the mood, it’s a good rut to be in.

I can’t believe there’s 360 calories in that sandwich. Seems like a lot.

Whatever happened to the 99 cent menu? I went to Wendy’s today for a plain baked potato and small chili. Both use to be on the value menu both are now$1.49. I was bummed. I use to love Wendy’s value menu options.

If anyone knows about the Infamous McGangbang from McDonalds, If you do the same thing with a double stack and one of these and you have a much better version.

That’s the manly way of eating it
 12 Reply Adam Bomb says: May 8, 2009 at 7:28 am 
@ Raiders757–Funny, those are the exact same two things I go to Wendy’s for. It’s usually either a spicy chicken combo, or a double cheeseburger with ketchup, onion, and mayo.

And the comment from someone about BK’s lettuce is right on. It really does seem like they microwave the lettuce. It’s always so wilty, yuck.

Had one today for lunch. One of the better .99c-$1.00 fast food menu items.

This sandwich was 99¢ when it debuted at my local Wendy’s in Frederick, MD, but the price went up to $1.49 after a month. During that 1 month“trial”period I also found it for 99¢ near the Chesapeake bay, but I dunno what the price is at that location any longer…It was a pretty good sandwich, but I must agree with brad that it does have something of a“chemical”taste to it…I have not been able to place it, and I’m usually able to place everything with my palate, so tasting something alien in my food is downright disturbing to me—but I will still eat them once a month or so…

Just had one of these sandwiches today for the first time.
It was 99 cents and I was quite impressed with it. To me, it is one
of the better dollar chicken sandwiches.

Probably my favorite of the“Value”Chicken sandwiches. Seldom a moment of inconsitency.
