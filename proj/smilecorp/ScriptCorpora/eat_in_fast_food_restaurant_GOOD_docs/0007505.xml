What does Real. Fast. Food. Mean to Big Wheel Burger?

 REAL. 
Means a Big Wheel Burger is made from the best quality ingredients and every step of the process, from the farm to your tray, is executed with precision using techniques that have been used for decades. It means that Big Wheel Burger is ahead of the curve. We are a 95% sustainable restaurant. Every product that comes on your tray is wrapped in materials that are compostable and our customer area is trash-free! Fast food and sustainability is an uncommon pairing.

 FAST. 
Means our burger is inspired by the classic American cheeseburger, which has taken many forms over the years. Why change something that is already great? You&apos;ve had the gourmet burger and one from the fast food giants, now let us take you back to the basics. We offer the experience of a world class burger without pretense and with friendly, fast service.

 FOOD. 
Means that our bun is custom made locally and our meat is free range, antibiotic and hormone free, grass fed and ground fresh every morning in-house. We use farm-fresh produce, REAL milk and ice cream for our shakes and everything is made in house from our veggie burger to our gravy to our salad dressings.
