 Monday, Halloween 2005 
 Hope all is well. Parrotdise is open for 
 business I went to buy a chain saw blade in Key West 
 yesterday. There were none. Sears is still closed. Home depot doesn&apos;t have 
 chain saws or generators. After waiting in line for two and a half hours Sunday morning at FEMA in KW I was given a 20 page loan application that is 
 so complicated that I would have to hire an accountant to fill it in. Are 
 they here to help us or hinder us with their absurd forms? 

Karma is a bitch for those guys who performed mischievous deeds of wrong 
 human relations. We know who you are and enjoy seeing things come full 
 circle. Govern yourselves accordingly and find better ways to make extra 
 cash. MER Screen Saver Get current info and pictures direct from NASA about the Mars Rovers, as a screen saver. 
Retail reality. B eware! I hear there 
 is a caravan of Jersey people headed this way. They&apos;re coming all 
 this way just to get free water and ice. Movie from E Fish during Wilma. Video_Sound/Movie_efish_wilma.wmv Re: Complaining about tourists getting free ice . Are 
 you kidding? Why don&apos;t you worry about something important. Who cares if 
 tourists get ice? I suggest you should get a life. 







 HalloweenMagazine.com - Downloads Boondocks had a party last night and it was jammed! No credit cards were accepted and definitely not enough waitress staff. We 
 left without dinner and many people, while we were waiting, left also. It&apos;s 
 a great place, but tonight it wasn&apos;t manned well. How do they expect to 
 recoup funds from being closed by having people leave unsatisfied? Don&apos;t 
 get me wrong we&apos;ll go back for sure, but they should rethink their business 
 tactics. Do the two guys from the North still own it? In the beginning 
 they were always there watching and helping, what happened? The guy that was saying there are no good looking 
 women here is understated. Big Pine is the only place where a fat and 
 ugly woman can pick and choose from many lonely guys. It is starting 
 to suck but I have concluded that if I want to find a good woman I am 
 going to have to look elsewhere. The problem here is that the women don&apos;t 
 even know that they are fat and ugly because there are too many lonely and 
 horny guys willing to take less. The 
 Cracked Egg should change their 
 name to the Rotten Egg! We tried to go for breakfast this morning at 9AM. 
 There was no wait for a table when we got there, but when we sat at our 
 table we noticed there were sugar ants all over the table coming from the 
 wall and under the table. After about 10 minutes battling the ants a 
 waitress finally came over and starting complaining how busy and confused 
 she was. She took our drink orders along with 2 other tables and 
 disappeared. A few minutes later a dirty shoeless busboy brought us 
 sticky, greasy menus. After waiting 30 minutes from the time we got there, 
 we still had no drinks, and had not seen our waitress again. Us, along 
 with 2 other tables all walked out. We drove straight to the Coffee Shop 
 and were served a delicious hot breakfast and were out the door in half an 
 hour. Maybe if the troll came out of the kitchen once in a while at the 
 Rotten Egg she would see what terrible shape her restaurant and staff were 
 in. Thanks for the recipe for saving drowned 
 lawnmowers . I tried it exactly, except for replacing the spark plug. I 
 cleaned the existing plug and grounded it to the engine and pulled, and I 
 got a spark so I figured the spark plug was OK. Maybe not tho? Anyway, she 
 won&apos;t start. I&apos;ll pick up a new spark plug and see if that makes a 
 difference, but I was wondering if there&apos;s anything else to be done. I don&apos;t 
 see any more water spitting out anywhere, so maybe I should just let it sit 
 for a while and try the new spark plug. 
 A really class 
 act: Friday 28 th I went to my very favorite restaurant/watering 
 hole for a bite and a brew. They had just re-opened after the storm and 
 could offer only burgers/fries or grilled chicken/fries. To my surprise the sandwiches were free.  Just pay for your beverage and have a burger 
 or chicken sandwich on the house. I praise Parrotdise Bar and Grill and 
 their owner/managers for great community spirit and generosity during a very 
 difficult time for all of us. I was told that as of Saturday they will be 
 up and running with their full menu. Mega Kudos, Parrotdise. You and your 
 entire staff are the best.  I saw the Key&apos;s Skunk Ape in the parking lot 
 at the Cow Palace Friday night. It was dancing to a weird version of&quot;Tube 
 Steak Boogie.&quot;One of the locals, of course, was trying to pick it up. I 
 wish I had my camera.  Re: Flooded lawnmower. Thanks. I followed your 
 instructions and it worked. At least my yard is starting to look like a yard 
 and not a marina. 
 Eden Pines Eden Pines Cudjoe 
 Chubby chicks do it better . For those of you 
 wondering, no I am not someone making fun of big women. I do prefer them. 
 Anyone else agree or any of the big women constantly being harassed by the 
 jerks on here want to start a regular group where big women can get together 
 with guys who appreciate them? Post your thoughts and if we have any 
 interest I will post a personal ad so we can exchange email addresses or 
 phone numbers. Hope to hear from you soon. 
 Re: Knuckleheads.  I have eaten there numerous times and have always found 
 the service at the bar to be just fine. Also, having met the owners, I can 
 say that they are very nice, friendly people. Perhaps the customer calling 
 them pathetic losers has a personal agenda because having been a customer 
 on a very busy evening I found the service to be prompt at both the bar and 
 in the dining area. Maybe after the hurricane they were short handed and 
 doing the best they could. A little patience and a polite check with the 
 host or hostess probably would have solved your petty little problem. The 
 comment about a quesadilla being $16 is just a lie. I have had a quesadilla 
 there and it was nowhere near that much. Lastly you complain about the 
 dcor. Im sure the owners and patrons of Knuckleheads are glad you wont 
 be returning. Pictures from Eden Pines , Camellia 
 Lane. Has anyone seen my hot tub cover? 
 
 Everyone should really be thankful that we 
 live here and not in a congested area like Miami. We don&apos;t wait on line 
 for FEMA supplies. People help people. As soon as I re-entered the Keys 
 after evacuating, I gave a sigh of relief...almost like I was holding my 
 breath the entire time I was gone. People on the mainland in a stress 
 situation become crazed....not one for all, all for one situation. Thank 
 you Keys people for maintaining your cool during a very difficult 
 situation. I am proud to call you my neighbors. Thank god for Dish network. I had TV 
 throughout the storm thanks to my generator and satellite dish. My neighbors 
 with Comcast are still without service. Comcast sucks! I am glad I was able 
 to keep updated via local Miami channels without interruption. I never lost 
 the signal. Things you need for a hurricane : Satellite TV, a gas 
 stove and Bellsouth.net.

 Sunday October 30, 2005 



Fall back ! Don&apos;t forget to set your clocks back today so you can get an 
 extra hour of sleep. Just think, last week I was worried about gravel on the 
 bike path . Isn&apos;t it funny how a Cat 3 hurricane can change your 
 priorities and remind you of what&apos;s important and what&apos;s not? I get most of my news from CNN , and I believe 
 global warming is real; and if Al Gore were president, none of this would 
 have happened. And I love all the reality shows! Re: Cutthroat Dr. on Cudjoe has had power since the day after Wilma. Cable 
 is out and so are phones in some areas. C&apos;mon down. 


Coconuts will be having its 23 Halloween Party on Monday night 
 Oct.31. This has been and will be a great time. Great music, food, and 
 cash prizes for best costume. What do you guys think of snowbirds who came down 2 
 days after the storm was over, suffered no damages, but got in line for free 
 water and ice? I think that is just wrong. To bad we can&apos;t do anything about 
 it. Maybe they should check residency before handing out freebies. We were amazed at how pathetic the losers are that run Knuckeheads Resturant . The name is aptly chosen. After arriving at 8 PM 
 for dinner we were told that they were short waiters and were running behind 
 but asked to please bear with them. We were told to be seated in the bar and 
 the host would fetch us when seats were available.
After taking 20 minutes to order a drink since there was only one 
 bartender, by the time 30 minutes had elapsed, we watched groups of people 
 come to the door and be seated for dinner. I had a bad feeling when I 
 observed two seated women in the bar bitching at the host that they were 
 never seated as told earlier. Oops, the host forgot about us too! How sad.

There is no excuse for this since we are talking about a mature 
 (very-maybe 60 year old) man acting as a host and trying to manage maybe 30 
 people having dinner. The place is way over priced (16 dollars for a single 
 Quesadilla - Fogarty&apos;s in Key West manages the same dish for $6.95.), 
 sterile decor, decorating is similar to a dull suburban basement circa 1970. 
 Needless to say, we walked out after 45 minutes and told the hostess where 
 he could stick his table. 
Happy Halloween. I wonder how John Kerry would have handled everything 
 that W. has flubbed. People from out of town: Cudjoe is still floating . 
 Most lower levels were somewhat filled with water. Venture Out did fairly 
 well, except for the very low trailers, and yes the electric is back on. To the person who wanted the &quot;Ode to Women&quot;, if you 
 meant the one that started with&quot;One Flaw in Women...The Lord replied...&quot;, I 
 sent it in after someone forwarded it to me. I&apos;d be happy to send you a 
 copy, just e-mail me at julieroberts7777@hotmail.com  and give me your address and I&apos;ll 
 mail you a copy. Thanks, and everyone take care down there! I am a&quot; Network Security Specialist &quot;from Missouri 
 and am looking to move to the Keys just for a life change. I have been 
 looking for a job in the computer field in the Lower Keys for the last 6 
 months and haven&apos;t found anything. Anyone have any leads or any advice on 
 where to look? I do check www.keysnews.com  everyday. Ed.,for 
 you. Guatemala Rising Central America&apos;s Newest Hot Spot Is Recovering 
 Quickly From Recent Hurricane Damage  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/28/AR2005102800542.html Someone posted that the world is dangerous. Yes, it 
 is full of criminals and murderers. The leniency of the courts release 
 rapists and murderers so they are free to rape and murder again. Why? Almost 
 everyone has lost the guts they were born with. People whine about&quot;not 
 getting involved&quot;, they will not stand up and speak out against evil and 
 wrong. Imagine if YOU were beng attacked, you called the police and they 
 whined&quot;we don&apos;t want to get involved&quot;. Keys 93.5 was great all through the storm. For the people who chose to stay it was refreshing to have such great 
 radio coverage as 93.5 gave. We don&apos;t believe it&apos;s a good idea to 
 advertise the fact before the storm that the radio stations will be on the 
 air when the authorities are working hard to get the message out telling 
 everyone to get out because it may encourage people not to evacuate.  
 Leaving your home is difficult because things can 
 be done immediately when the storm is over. If we had to leave and 
 return 2 or 3 days later, the stress of not knowing anything about 
 everything we left behind that we have worked for all our lives. Direct TV 
 and generators kept many families well informed of everything going on and 
 all the surge that was going to approach after the storm passed and that 
 was a life saver. Thanks to all the crews of Fire Rescue, City Elec., 
 BellSouth, groceries that opened and if I leave anyone out it&apos;s because I 
 am tired from cleaning, Getting on the roads to begin the clean up as soon 
 as they did was a big help for workers to get to their destination. They 
 deserve a big thank you most of all because they can&apos;t leave the area and 
 they put all of us above their own needs.  Lawnmowers can be 
 brought back to life after going underwater. First, remove the spark 
 plug. Then, drain the old oil ( it will most likely be mixed with water). 
 Spray in the spark plug hole and the oil hole a ton of WD-40 or any 
 other kind of water dispersant. Pull the engine over while you do this - 
 the longer you do it the better. I will use a whole can of WD-40 on each 
 engine. Replace the oil with fresh oil and get a new spark plug. Now try 
 to start it. It will most likely start hard and smoke like hell when it 
 does fire. Run it for 15 to 30 minutes and then change the oil once more 
 and you should be good to go. Fausto&apos;s on Fleming St . gave away over three hundred 
 and fifty free meals during the hurricane. And Jimmy Weekley (owner) is not 
 even the mayor anymore so his detractors can&apos;t say he did it to get 
 re-elected. That is the way (homeless) Marge wants to 
 live. We know not why. This is Robert Holloway . To the person in 
 Tampa looking for me, I am okay. Fanci Seafood / E-Fish is up and 
 operating with minimal damage. Ice is available for those in need at no 
 charge , bring your own cooler(s). 

I saw the first ten point buck ever. What a magnificent creature. It 
 had six points on one side and four on the other. It also had a beautiful 
 coat. Exxon-Mobil reported a ten Billion dollar profit for the last quarter . This is the largest profit of any company in history. Thank 
 George W. and his oil men. They&apos;re laughing all the way to the bank. Hell, 
 they own the bank! 
 To Vent, Rant and Rave:  Maybe hes like he is because of your non-stop 
 venting, ranting and raving. You sound like a person whos really fun to 
 live with ( Not ). Ask him. 
 Hell probably buy you a ticket to wherever you want to go. Like many 
 whining women you probably just dont know when to shut up.  It is a 
 documented fact that fat women do better in hurricanes than thin 
 women; due to their lower center of gravity. The bad news for us Keys 
 guys is that all the thin ones blew away while the porkers hugged the 
 ground like ticks on a dog. The guy here that likes porkers, however, will 
 be in hog heaven.

 Saturday October 29, 
 2005 Thank God for my neighbors on Big Pine who 
 mopped the water out of my house! 

I was online-looking for pictures of the devastation , to send to a 
 friend that has no comprehension of what a storm can cause, If some-one 
 has any idea where to go Please let me know! I just want to tell all of you how I wish I was 
 there to help . My family vacations there every year. I hope everyone 
 is okay. I get upset when I watch the news and they talk about Miami, but 
 no mention of the Keys. I have friends in Ramrod Key that we met during 
 Hurricane Dennis--Tracy, Jerome, I hope you guys are okay. Does anyone 
 know how the Big Pine Key Fishing Lodge and Old Wooden Bridge cabins are, 
 and the damage if any? My prayers are with all of you. This pine nut does not crack! Re: Local bands . I&apos;m a part time Big Pine resident (trying to become a 
 full time resident.) who plays in a band who would love to play some of the 
 rooms around the Keys. If you know any of the local club owners who might 
 be looking for a change of pace musically, please have them check out the 
 band web site: www.geocities.com/tedsooc   Here&apos;s some animal pictures to entice a smile.
 
 Kudos to Overseas Lumber and their fork lift 
 drivers. They have been unloading the food and water trucks each day. We 
 were able to get the Coca Cola fork lift for this afternoon. Nice to see 
 some companies helping when and where they can. One person can make a 
 difference. Just go and do something helpful. Throw a street party with 
 grills and such, take a friend and family to the free lunches and dinners 
 at the church. Take a bag of food stuff and find someone needing and say,&quot;Here, this is yours.&quot; p.s. You didn&apos;t have to take off my name 
 about yesterdays giving up(?)  Lack of information . We went all the way to Marathon 
 to register with FEMA and they were just taking applications for loans. 
 Has anyone 
 been out to Port Pine Heights ? I heard there was 8-10 ft. surge on 
 N.W. side. All power poles are down. I am out of town and can&apos;t reach any 
 neighbors. Help!
 (Ed: They had about four feet in the houses on the ground. Five poles are 
 down, but since replaced. They now have electricity except no one&apos;s 
 refrigerators are working.) See 
 Mars Shine Bright on Saturday. The big, yellow&quot;star&quot;blazing in 
 the east this fall is Mars. On Oct. 29 the planet will be closer to Earth 
 than it will be again until 2018. It will remain a great telescope target 
 through mid-November. Re: I need a place I can shower, shelter, sleep and eat. 
 I&apos;m not a dirty old woman. I&apos;m a nice guy.
I know the homeless woman, Marge . Nobody chooses to live like that. 
 Marge is a nice person and should not have to live with cats in a car. Do 
 you think you&apos;ve got it bad? A little (more) fun at W&apos;s expense . http://www.otoons.com/politics/condoleeza.htm To those jumping on the global warming bandwagon, 
 take a little time to read the opposing points of view to at least get an 
 idea that this might not be all our fault. There is big money to be made 
 from scaring people with global warming, and a lot of people are doing 
 just that and laughing all the way to the bank. 
 If you want to worry about something, be concerned 
 with the weakening magnetic field of the earth. That could get 
 nasty and we might be to blame with all those electromagnetic forces 
 radiating from power lines (just kidding, but I could make money off of 
 it). 

I always wanted to live on the water , but not like this! I think the current Bush problems will be 
 called Cheney-gate but my vote goes to&quot; Leakingliar-gate. &quot; Can anyone tell me if the power is back on 
 on Cudjoe (Cutthroat Dr. )? I evacuated, and don&apos;t want to come back 
 until the power is back. How can I get my lawnmower running after being 
 submerged? Water got in the cylinder. The carburetor is cleaned. When is the Bacon Grease Woman  Golf Course 
 going to open? I can&apos;t wait to see the size of the holes. 
The lack of nice-looking women in the Keys is appalling. It seems 
 that all we have down here are burnt out, well-used, hard drinking, 
 chain-smoking ladies with attitudes. Does anyone have a clue if there are 
 any decent single women living down here? I met a really nice one the 
 other night, but big surprise, she was from out of town. Maybe the FEMA 
 women will show some potential. This is a poem made up entirely of actual quotations from George W.
Bush, arranged for&quot;aesthetic&quot;purposes, by Washington Post writer Richard 
 Thompson.

A wonderful poem like this is too good not to share.
Ah, yes! A testament to literacy in the age of Every Child Left Behind!
MAKE THE PIE HIGHER!
I think we all agree, the past is over.
This is still a dangerous world.
It&apos;s a world of madmen and uncertainty
And potential mental losses.
Rarely is the question asked
Is our children learning?
Will the highways of the Internet
Become more few?
How many hands have I shaked?
They misunderestimate me.
I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity.
I know that the human being
And the fish can coexist.
Families is where our nation finds hope, Where our wings take dream.
Put food on your family!
Knock down the tollbooth!
Vulcanize society!
Make the pie higher!
Make the pie higher! I&apos;m hoping 
 to get back to Venture Out soon to see if there is any damage. Does anyone know what happened on Cudjoe? Heard Fat Albert took a swim.  Key Deer Grill S at 
 night 7 until 1--Terry Cassidy and crew on guitar, banjo. Singing country, 
 blue grass, sea grass. Singing songs about the Keys. It&apos;s a family place 
 with a family show.

 Actor Says He&apos;s Gay George Takei, the man best known for his

 current issue of a magazine covering the Los Angeles gay and lesbian 
 community. Thank you for your wonderful web site ! Please ask 
 people to send in more pictures of the conditions down there. Our news 
 stations aren&apos;t showing anything from the Big Pine area and since my 
 daughter and son-in-law live there I&apos;m hungry for news. Thanks for keeping 
 us informed. Yea! The web cam is back. Thanks for the information on Sea Camp and I am happy that you folks are getting some help down there. You folks 
 live in a wonderful area and it is a shame to see it in the shape it is. I 
 hope and pray that you all are safe and well. I look forward to coming down 
 in Feb to Sea Camp, and getting away from the snow that will be here. 





W . looks like he has 
 aged a bit this week. Re:  Disorganized Rescue Attempt . Why would 
 you need info if you evacuated? I mean, you obviously ignored the radio 
 reports to evacuate. Why would you be listening to the news reports 
 afterwards? When you&apos;re told to evacuate. Evacuate! The only one you can 
 blame is yourself!  If we evacuated every time they told us to we&apos;d be 
 financially ruined. Who can afford to leave every time they tell us to? 
 Evacuation does not work. Only seven percent of the County residents 
 evacuated during this Category three hurricane. Most people won&apos;t evacuate. 
 The county hasn&apos;t learned that by now and they never will as long as the 
 present leadership is there. Only a few people actually leave the Keys. 
Happy, Happy Birthday Fletcher !

arrest date: 10/27/2005
Name: Wherley, Mark Allan dob:07/22/1959 age:46 sex:m race:w
Address: 14802 1st Ave Gulf, Marathon, Fl 33050
Occupation: &quot;I&apos;m a freeloader&quot; 
Arrest location: 1199 73 St Ocean, Marathon
Charges:1 misdemeanor count(s) of 843.15.1b Failure to appear for 
 misdemeanor offense. My wife and I 
 hitched hiked to Marathon airport yesterday to get a rental. The lady at 
 Enterprise said we were no. 384 in line for a car. We&apos;re in our 60&apos;s and 
 when we told here we&apos;d been stuck in the woods for three days with flooded 
 cars and finally decided to hitchhike to Marathon, she took pity on us and 
 gave us a car that they had been saving in the back. I&apos;m now in love with 
 that lady. She&apos;s alright by me. Hitchhiking is demeaning. Everyone seemed to 
 be looking at us like we were losers. My wife thought we were going to get 
 murdered or something. RE: No transportation . I hope your car 
 is under 6FT of seaweed; and what would you do if you had to get out now? Webcam. Have been trying to view your live cam 
 on Big Pine. Are you having a problem with sending it? (Ed: We&apos;re all 
 right now.) Re: Decent looking guys . You girls 
 would get with any guy with money, 400 pounds, teeth or not. Survivor. I am glad that everyone seems to have survived the storm. The damage is 
 another story. About 7:50am I was awoken by a knock on my door. Yes, I 
 do try to sleep through the storms and do a pretty good job. Opening the 
 door, I was greeted by two strangers who asked;&quot;Are you aware the house 
 next door to you is on fire?&quot; Of course being a sound sleeper I was not. My truck is parked between the two homes, so as soon as I was able to 
 gather myself enough, I moved the truck out of harms way.  
 At this stage there was smoke coming out of the 
 vent on top of the home and through a window unit air conditioner. Without the benefit of power the thing that is most missed here is not 
 having my wake-up coffee. I decided to take my cat to my son&apos;s house on 
 Ramrod (I am on Big Pine.) I asked the stranger if he had called 911 and 
 he said,&quot;Yes, about 6:30am.&quot; I called to make sure and was told that&quot;someone was on it.&quot;  

 I owe these men, perhaps they saved my life aside 
 from my vehicle, etc. I had a feeling of complete helplessness. The 
 house was boarded up tight and in reality I probably could not do 
 anything. The only thing I could think to do was turn the garden hose on 
 the two large propane tanks that sat between the homes. To make a long 
 story a little shorter, the fire truck showed up about 10:30am and by this 
 time the home was completely engulfed in flames. This was after another 
 call to 911 telling them if they don&apos;t get there in the next 10-15 minutes 
 this is going to be a whole hell of a lot worse. The fire crew 
 extinguished the flames pretty quickly. The vinyl siding on my trailer 
 was melted, so you can imagine the heat it generated.  

 It is sad that the emergency crews had to work 
 with far less personnel than normal times and I do not blame anyone as a 
 result. But what a terrible experience. And as always, finding the upside; 
 no one was injured. I found out later that the nice people who lived there 
 had no insurance. My landlord said,&quot;This is why we bug out...&quot; My 
 thought was, perhaps if they had not evacuated, they would still have a 
 house in this scenario. Personally, I have had enough. I have earned the 
 right to enjoy this winter here, but come next June I am going to get out 
 of here for 5-6 months and wear the label of snowbird. I am not sure 
 where I will go during the summer, but it won&apos;t be New Jersey! Parrotdise . We went to eat yesterday and 
 Kip said that they weren&apos;t serving food until today (Friday) because they don&apos;t have any freezers because all their food is fresh. Imagine that, a 
 restaurant without freezers? Another 
 storm.&quot; Beta nearing hurricane strength. &quot;What do we do as we 
 continue to research sufficiently the untested theory of global warming . 
 When we discover that we dont have enough names for storms after running 
 out of the Greek alphabet? Shall we consider naming them after Republican 
 presidents, and then vice-presidents, beginning with most recent? I am writing to the woman who wrote in&quot;I&apos;m at 
 Looe Key at 5:00 PM. On Friday nights. I&apos;m usually home around 7-8 because 
 there isn&apos;t any good looking guys to look at. 7-8 can&apos;t be that late 
 to stay out? Let me know!&quot;on Wednesday. I agree it is tough finding someone 
 out there these days. I have experienced the same problem. Shoot me an email 
 if you would like to meet for a cup of coffee or a drink. keysfisherman@hotmail.com  This could be the start of something good. I have to give up, trying to get food and water to people without autos, and arranging auto to go and get people for some 
 hot food at the church. The army was willing to give all I could get 
 carried, but others decided that was just not going to work, there might 
 be some people hording the ice out there, I send seven people with trucks 
 back home that came to help, others didn&apos;t deliver on getting the word out 
 for hot food either. Three vans went out there this afternoon , but no one 
 was aware what they were for, I tried people , I really did! I think the our rescue was totally 
 disorganized . What we really needed was information. And it was not 
 forthcoming. US-1 radio did the best they could, but they didn&apos;t even have 
 the best information. Rose Drive, Eden Pines . 
 Best wishes to all. Please be careful during cleanup.
 
 For those interested in the status on Doctors Arm for those who can not get down here: I live in Dr Arm and we 
 took on 4 feet of water. If you are ground level, expect a big mess when you 
 get here. Doctors Arm is a great neighbor hood. I have lived there for a 
 long time and the people that live there are great too. Everybody be safe 
 and love thy neighbor because you never know when you might be needing a 
 little help. To everyone in the area: I certainly hope 
 things are getting better there after Wilma. We visit on a regular basis and 
 have always found the community to be warm, wonderful and inviting. We have 
 a friend there at Fanci seafood, Robert Holloway . We have tried on 
 several occasions, both right before Wilma and after, but have been unable 
 to reach him. Does anyone know if Robert is OK? We are concerned here in 
 Tampa? Thanks for any news! 
Emergency preparedness ? Power is back on to Mango Land at 
 7:45pm. Nothing to keep me from washing my hair tonight. I can&apos;t wait for 
 the water heater to get ready. Doesn&apos;t take much to make me happy. Thank you 
 to the man from Shaw. My apologies to those of you that may still be 
 electrically challenged. It was a pleasure to go to W/D Tues and find 
 the store was open and we could shop even though no perishable foods were 
 available. Everything else was there. Plenty of water, ice, and 
 batteries. Thank you all. Can someone please tell me where that 
 beautiful&quot; Ode to Women&quot; can be found? That was outstanding! 
 I want to 
 add my plea to others that have posted inquiring about conditions on the 
 island. I am a long time owner on Doctors Arm and will not be able 
 to get down there to check things out for another week or so. Just how high 
 was the water on the east side? How about wind and debris damage? Broken 
 doors or windows? Should I even question...looting? Any responses would be 
 appreciated. 
Belated Birthday greetings to one of the Best that have served drinks at 
 the Looe Key Tiki Bar.&quot; Happy Birthday Christ ie!&quot;

 Thursday October 27, 2005 (Ed: We&apos;re still running on our boat&apos;s 
 battery and an inverter because our vehicles&apos; batteries are trashed 
 along with the vehicles. Maybe we&apos;ll get some electricity today. Oh, my 
 gosh. Keys Energy is outside my house! It&apos;s looking good!) Hope all my great friends in the Keys 
 survived Wilma with minimum losses of stuff and most of all, no loss of 
 life. You can always replace stuff. You can&apos;t replace the quality Piners. 
 Hope y&apos;all get back to normal (whatever that means) ASAP. Hope Ed&apos;s boat 
 battery holds up. My body is in AZ, but my Heart, My Mind, and especially My 
 Friends will always be in the Keys. Stay Well and Dry W e 
 hope everyone down there is recovering. We know how horrible these 
 hurricanes are. We took a beating in Georges. After we sold in March 
 we knew we were going to miss the Keys . This hurricane season made us 
 realize we made the right choice to leave. Yet our hearts will always be in 
 the Keys and we miss it there very much. We wish we were rich enough. 
I still remember putting $1.00 worth of gas in my &apos;49 Mercury , and I 
 got 4 Gallons! More than enough to go to the Submarine Races! Here is some news on Seacamp of Big 
 Pine Key:&quot;We know that everyone has been thinking about us here on Big Pine 
 Key, so here is a quick update on the situation at camp after Hurricane 
 Wilma. We had a 6-8 foot storm surge on the property. The flattops and the 
 new docks did well, though our staff houseboats did not do so well - one is 
 just gone, the Keebler sank, the Barnacle and the Seagoing are high and dry, but still intact. There is some minor roof damage on 
 some of the buildings. There was two feet of water in Sunrise, Sunset and 
 the Dining Hall. The executive trailer is over on its side. Cell phone 
 coverage is sporadic, but we got power back today - yahoo! We will post 
 photos soon and let you know when and how to check them. To all those that trashed local bands . Thankfully we have them! You 
 don&apos;t see major or even minor stars stopping by the Tiki Bar or The House 
 of Music. We should be thankful that local bands exist and perform! It 
 gives locals like me a night on the town to get together with friends, 
 dance and have a good time. Thanks to all of the local musicians! To those of 
 you out of the area , there has been a lot of flooding damage. A 
 lot of people lost their cars. Ground level houses had 4 and 5 feet of 
 water in them. Places that haven&apos;t flooded before with the hurricanes got 
 a lot of water. A lot of the canals in Eden Pines overflowed. The jail 
 on Stock Island had about 8 feet of water come in, a lot of officers on 
 duty at the jail lost their cars. While driving from Key West to Big Pine 
 Tuesday morning I saw boats on US 1, a bait freezer, a hot tub, all of 
 them brought up to the road by the water. Fat Albert is gone again. We 
 had more damage from flooding than from the wind. The difference between the Keys and 
 Miami-Dade : We have our neighbors and determination. Miami has lots of 
 people, that happen not be to be as friendly and helpful as us in the Keys. 
 That&apos;s why I love the Keys, keep your heads up, help your neighbors. Lets 
 show everyone how strong the Keys really are. The progress shows, I&apos;ve 
 knocked out 3 houses in 3 days...Keep moving!

 Wednesday October 26, 
 2005 6pm.Ed: I&apos;m going to just feed you Piners the raw 
 unedited postings without snappy graphics because I don&apos;t know how long my 
 boat battery is going to last. We&apos;re one of the few places that still don&apos;t 
 have electricity. So here goes... If that monstrosity 
 under construction at the Boondocks golf course is a statue of the 
 legendary Bacon Grease Woman, then I think you will find that it will be 
 the easiest hole to reach, not the most difficult. And we all know where 
 that guy who likes fat women will be hanging out. I did see a homeless,&quot;dirty&quot;looking woman at Winn 
 Dixie. When I tried to help her, however, I quickly learned she was a 
 snowbird from New Jersey and&quot;didn&apos;t need any of my friggin&apos; help.&quot;  So now we find out that the Keys carpet muncher is 
 not much to look at- big surprise there. I would also be willing to bet 
 the women who go out with him are on the lower end of the looks scale. I agree that most bands down here suck compared to 
 what you can find in the big cities, but you are not going to get great 
 acts for the price the local establishments pay. Remember, you always have 
 a couple of options: drink a little more and enjoy what is here, or move. For the women looking for single, young hair on their 
 head men, are all of the features required? I am single, maybe young (mid 
 30&apos;s) have hair on my head but thinning, have all my teeth and a job. I 
 also have a big Penis. Does that count for anything? Re the women living @WD parking lot her name is 
 Marge she has been part of this community over 15 yrs or more she has a 
 booth @ the flea market ,this is the way she chose to live . I&apos;m at Looe Key at 5:00 PM. On Friday nights. I&apos;m 
 usually home around 7-8 because there isn&apos;t any good looking guys to look 
 at. 7-8 can&apos;t be that late to stay out? Let me know! I&apos;m at Looe Key at 5:00 PM. On Friday nights. I&apos;m 
 usually home around 7-8 because there isn&apos;t any good looking guys to look 
 at. 7-8 can&apos;t be that late to stay out? Let me know! I agree that guys sons videos suck! We heard he used to be a Producer 
 for Comcast Channel 5 (another piece of crap). He ran away to New York City because Key Tv 
 wouldn&apos;t hire him. What a loser! http://www.dflproductions.com/dwels/dwels.html i get so mad at the people 
 putting fat women down! well let me tell ya, they&apos;re great for providing 
 shade in the summer, and heat in the winter! On a more serious note, I 
 hope everyone came through this storm safely. Billy wagner was on cnn 
 early this am saying that only 10% of the county evacuated! we look like 
 total idiots to the rest of the country. then to top it off, two drunks 
 get into a fist fight in key weird followed by an interview with a gay 
 drunk! the perfect thumbnail sketch of the lower keys. well, the TDC has 
 their work cut out for them now. I am a long 
 time property owner out on Doctors Arm. Would very much appreciate some 
 condition reports on flooding, wind damage or other property damage as I am 
 not able to drive down right away to check my place. I hope everyone dodged 
 the bullet on this one ok. I will check the site often realizing that you 
 probably dont have power yet as of Monday afternoon. http://louhi.kempele.fi/~skyostil/archive/dump/flash/psychic.swf To our elected officials, bureaucrats, and utility 
 employees: public servants are elected by and work for us taxpaying 
 citizens. We appreciate your advice, but we don&apos;t appreciate being told when 
 and where to evacuate. This is a decision we will make ourselves, based on 
 the best information available. Those of us who stayed home during Wilma did 
 so to defend our properties and avoid being part of a horrendous mass 
 exodus. In many cases, we were able to prevent damage by being on site 
 during the storm. In all cases, we were able to avoid injury to us or our 
 families (early reports show no injuries or deaths from Wilma in the Keys). 
 Sometimes its important to remember that we homeowners are not dummies who 
 need politicians and bureaucrats to order us around; we can make our own 
 decisions, and most often they are the right ones. 
 With 
 hurricanes, tornado&apos;s, flooding and severe t-storms tearing up the country 
 from one end to another, with the big quake in Pakistan, the quote of the 
 month is from ..... Jay Leno: &quot;Are we sure this is a good 
 time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?&quot; Rosa Parks is dead. Who cares? It is all over the 
 news that she is dead as if we care. The only good thing to come of it is 
 that our great country now has one less black person. I would suggest 
 they make it a holiday so her people could take the day off but why 
 bother? Black people don&apos;t work anyway. I hope you all are doing well after Wilma 
 came through there, and that nobody was hurt. I am wondering what happened 
 at the sea camp? We are heading down there in Feb with some students and I 
 am interested in how it faired in the storm. L I KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT 
 EVERYTHING HURTS OR DOESN&apos;T WORK AT ALL. I&apos;M NOT REALLY SURE, CAUSE I JUST 
 CAN&apos;T REMEMBER ENOUGH TO KNOW!! I&apos;M NOT EVEN SURE WHICH DOCTOR FIXES WHAT 
 My name is 
 Louis Cutler and I live on Big Pine at 30736 Hammock Big Pine Key. It is 
 down the road from the Cracked Egg restaurant and next to the Royal Palm 
 Trailer Park. We have been trying to get news on Big Pine and the conditions 
 there for a couple of days. No news organizations seem to be providing 
 anything for us to go on. We are simply trying to find out whether we have 
 anything to go back to and what conditions we will find when we get there. 
 If you could provided us some feed back so we would know what to bring and 
 be prepared for when we come we would be very grateful. We left last Tuesday 
 and have not seen our home since. Thanks in advance. Here&apos;s hoping BPK.com HQ is OK. We were 
 luckier than many others and am thankful. Hope all is well with Editor. the&quot;dirty old lady&quot;you are concerned about has been 
 around for many years, she has her cats and books,she likes beer and minds 
 her own business...I can feel that you would like to help&quot;someone&quot;....try bring in the guys empty garbage cans from next store ,or his or 
 her newspaper,pull some weeds on the lot down the street,random acts of 
 kindness are a great thing and should be part of all caring folks life,s.....ooo and you must not tell anyone that you did these random acts of

 to implode with the sleeze finally catching up with Tom Delay, Karl Rove, 
 Scooter Libby, and the hollowness of the Iraq war taking hold of rational

 white house look like a bunch of choir boys. If you are getting bored with your regular Keys bar, try 
 the Looe Key Tiki Bar at MM 27. This place doesn&apos;t have a website and it 
 doesn&apos;t advertise, but word of mouth seems to work pretty well. The best 
 time to go is on weekends when a good rock band like Mile Marker 24 or 
 Injade are playing. There is always a strong party atmosphere working, and 
 the dance floor fills up fast. Notice the range in ages - where else do you 
 find such a variety of party people? Even Cracked Conch keeps crackin&apos;

  In its 26-year history, the Cracked Conch, a restaurant of 
 legendary proportions in Marathon, has never closed. Not through Andrew, 
 Georges, Katrina, Rita and certainly, not through Wilma.

  Though 6 feet of storm surge had washed through much of 
 Marathon, the restaurant, a simple one-story structure with worn tables and 
 chairs, was open for business. The hours and the menu would be abbreviated. 
 Four hours of service on Monday.

The menu: chicken sandwich or fried fish basket.

Drinks were more bountiful: lemonade, Chardonnay and plenty 
 of ice-cold beer.

  The owner, Joe DeConda, cleaned the tables after each 
 satisfied and thankful customer, left.

  &quot;Someone has to be here for the local people,&quot;DeConda 
 said.

 He would close at 5 p.m. much to the dismay of many 
 residents who continued to pull into the driveway after closing.

 DeConda, a slightly rotund man, who greeted his regular 
 customers by first name, was admittedly weary. It&apos;s hard living up to a 
 business mantra that requires full service, seven days a week, no matter the 
 weather.

  &quot;I think we set something in motion that we can never 
 undo,&quot;he laughed.

  &quot;We&apos;re afraid that if we stayed closed, just once, they 
 would never let us re-open.&quot; http://www.justracin.net/is.swf I&apos;ve often wondered 
 if you should leave your computer turned on during the night. I now have 
 the answer as to what happens to your computer while it is unattended 
 during the night while you sleep. Turn on your sound... &quot;One flaw in women.&quot;The Lord replied.
By 
 the time the Lord made woman, he was into his sixth day of working

overtime.

An Angel appeared and said,&quot;Why are you spending so much time on this 
 one?&quot;

And the Lord answered,&quot;Have you seen my spec sheet on her? She has to be

completely washable, but not plastic, have over 200 working parts, be 
 able

to run on Diet Coke and leftovers, have a lap that can hold 4 children at

one time, have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a 
 broken

heart- and she will do everything with two hands.&quot;

The Angel was astounded at these requirements.&quot;Only two hands? No way!

And that&apos;s the standard model? That&apos;s too much work for one day, wait 
 until

tomorrow to finish.&quot;

&quot;But I won&apos;t, the Lord protested. I am so close to finishing this

creation that is so close to my heart. She already heals herself when she

is sick, AND can work 18 hour days.&quot;

The Angel moved closer and touched the woman.&quot;But you have made her so

soft, my Lord.&quot;

&quot;She is soft, but I have also made her tough. You have no idea what she

can endure and accomplish.&quot;

&quot;Will she be able to think?&quot;Asked the Angel.

&quot;Not only will she be able to think, but she will be able to reason and

negotiate.&quot;

Then the Angel touched the woman&apos;s cheek.&quot;Oops, it looks like you were

trying to put too much into this one, there is a leak.&quot;

&quot;That is not a leak, that is a tear&quot;.

&quot;What is the tear for?&quot;The Angel asked.

The Lord said,&quot;The tear is her way of expressing joy, her sorrow, her

pain, her love, her lonliness, and her pride.&quot;

The Angel was impressed. You are a genius Lord, you thought of

everything. Woman is truly amazing!

And she is.

Women have strengths that amaze them. They can bear hardships and carry

burdens, but they hold happiness and joy. They will smile when they want 
 to

scream, They will sing when they want to cry.

They will cry when they are happy, and laugh when they are nervous, they

will fight for what they believe in, and stand up to injustice.

She won&apos;t take no for an answer, when she believes there is a better

solution. She will go without, so that her family will not. She will go 
 to

the doctor with a frightened friend. She will love unconditionally. She

will cry when her children excel and cheer for her friends when they get

awards.

She is happy when she hears of a birth or a wedding. Her heart breaks

when a friend dies, she grieves the loss of a family member. Yet she is

strong when she thinks ther is no strength left. She knows that a kiss 
 and

a hug can heal a broken heart.

You see women come in all sizes, shapes and colors. They will drive,

walk, run or send an e-mail to you to let you know how much they care. 
 The

heart of a good woman is what makes the world keep turning. They bring 
 hope

and joy and they have compassion and ideals and they give moral support 
 to

their family and friends. Women have vital things to say and everything 
 to

give. However, if there is one flaw in women, it is...that they forget

their worth. A friend from Virginia wants to know if 
 there&apos;s any way to help. Let me know. Carole (recently back from Guatemala) Glad to hear from you. Anxious for news

dj vu all over again /Oct 26
Miami police officers sought yesterday to control a crowd trying to enter 
 the Orange Bowl in hopes of getting water and 10,000 bags of ice there. Top of Form 1  
 South Florida was a coast-to-coast mess on Tuesday as millions of people 
 remained without power, huge lines formed for basic supplies and drivers 
 wove through packed, debris-strewn streets with no traffic signals.

Despite Gov. Jeb Bush&apos;s assurances that recovery 
 from Hurricane Wilma would proceed smoothly after lessons learned from seven 
 previous storms, the government response looked frayed. In Broward and 
 Miami-Dade Counties, people lined up for ice and water only to learn that 
 government deliveries of both were late.

Many busy intersections had no police officers to guide impatient 
 drivers. Schools and most businesses remained closed as dazed multitudes 
 wandered in search of food, gasoline and cell phone reception. The one bit of 
 luck was blissfully cool air, brought in by the storm, that made the lack of 
 air-conditioning endurable.

A day after Hurricane Wilma struck, leaving at least six dead, power had 
 been restored to several hundred thousand households and businesses by 
 Tuesday evening. But 3.1 million still had no electricity, including about 
 93 percent of customers in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties. Eleven other 
 counties also reported power failures, many of them widespread. Officials at 
 Florida Power and Light said some customers might have to wait four weeks. Voice of Jolly Green Giant Dies at 80 PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- Elmer&quot;Len&quot;Dresslar Jr., who extolled vegetables to 
 generations of TV watchers as the booming voice of the Jolly Green Giant, 
 has died. He was 80. Sorry to hear you got clobbered this time. I&apos;ve been 
 checking daily to see if you&apos;re back. The news didn&apos;t make the damage 
 sound quite so bad as you describe. Good luck to you all. 
 Autos may have to be scrapped 

Vehicles flooded by storm surge are iffy candidates for repair, according to 
 Keys auto experts who have seen this before.

If the water got inside, then it&apos;s almost not worth spending the money it 
 takes to repair, said Ronnie Freeman of Freeman Automotive in Marathon.

The height of the water is key in assessing how much damage was done.
       
And the fact that saltwater is so devastating to electrical systems and 
 onboard computers escalates the cost of repair.

When water gets into the main harness and the computer, forget it, said 
 Mitty Ram, owner of RAM Unlimited.

If the battery was submerged, as soon as the ignition is turned on, a short 
 runs throughout the electrical system, he added, making the damage even 
 worse.
              
Even when cars start up and appear to run OK after flooding, the long-term 
 prospects are not very good, said Freeman, who worked on cars that were 
 flooded by last year&apos;s hurricanes when flooding was much, much less.

It&apos;s a can of worms, he said. Once the water has reached the floorboards 
 inside, that usually means the electrical system. And you can fix one thing 
 and then find out later something else goes bad.

Insurance companies have varying policies on repair versus writing off 
 vehicles as a total loss.
       
The recent experience with insurance adjusters in the New Orleans flooding 
 as well as flooding along the Alabama and Mississippi coasts provides some 
 guidance.

Based on Blue Book value of the car, older models are simply declared a 
 total loss. It&apos;s not worth what it would take to replace and repair all the 
 components that have gone bad.

Ram notes that a starter can be replaced, but once water has gotten up into 
 the cylinders or the computer system, then it&apos;s a total loss.
       
Both Freeman and Ram advised flushing vehicles with fresh water as soon as 
 possible, especially to clean the undercarriage, brakes, rotors and wheels, 
 where saltwater does great damage.

Following New Orleans, insurance companies began a national clearinghouse to 
 keep track of vehicles declared a total loss after flooding. That&apos;s to 
 prevent unsuspecting buyers from purchasing a flood-damaged vehicle later. Hurricane wisdom 
 Never test the depth of the water with both feet. 

 If you think nobody cares if you&apos;re alive, try missing a couple of car 
 payments. 

 Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day! . Teach him how to fish, and 
 he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day Garrison Keillor on Halloween
 And so we should celebrate Halloween. It&apos;s as close to a carnival as we 
 have, and it&apos;s a chance to slip out of the stereotypes assigned to us and 
 find truth and beauty in caricature. If you are pegged as a Midwestern mom, 
 Monday is your chance to be Decadent Heiress, Transcendental Heartthrob, 
 Taxi Dancer, Aviatrix, Lady Macbeth or the Goddess Athena, and break free of your family&apos;s low expectations -- a 
 chance to be something passionate. 

 We made our choices in life, based on lousy 
 information, and got stuck being who we are. You: attractive, impetuous, 
 with bedroom eyes and a savage wit. Me: rumpled, preoccupied, shambling, 
 dropping things. And do we regret this? No, not really. A person only needs 
 to be truly understood by two or three people. Everyone else is audience. 
 Passion is in your head. Two people can be married for a dog&apos;s age and 
 despite all the aches and bruises of matrimony they still look at each other 
 and get excited. Nobody else understands this. Nobody else needs to. 

So, on the Eve of All Hallows, let us paint our faces and put feathers in 
 our hair and venture off along the curve of the earth and be somebody else. More hurricane wisdom

Re: Wilma. The waiting is getting old. I feel like I&apos;m sitting on a 
 time bomb. If you see a homeless,&quot;dirty&quot;looking 
 woman at the Winn Dixie parking lot... write down the address of where 
 she can shower and a shelter she can stay in. Be kind enough to help. Regarding the comments about Sea Center . I 
 recently bought a new motor from Sea Center and I was treated like 
 royalty. I do not know the owners, I can only speak for myself that they 
 went way beyond the call of duty to make this customer happy. If I ever 
 win the lottery, I can guarantee you that Sea Center is where I will buy 
 my new boat. Also, several of the guys commented to me how wonderful the 
 owners were to work for. I&apos;m confused on how the writer is making these 
 assumptions, I can only guess jealousy plays a factor. 
 
I was listening to that 
 old rock &apos;n roll song from the fifties, Jim Dandy (to the 
 rescue) and I realized that Lavern Baker is actually saying,&quot;Jim Danny .&quot;How about that? To the erudite band critic complaining about 
 existing bands and their repertoires: bands play what the majority of 
 people in the area want to hear and dance to, otherwise they lose their 
 audiences. Note the number of salsa, rap and country bands that thrive 
 down here. There are a lot of old buzzards farting in 
 bars around here; and they are proud of it! Some of them even think they 
 can fly. I have a 
 request, as Wilma passes to our North (typed with fingers crossed) please 
 limit your time on the web cam. If you live and stayed here you know what 
 the weather looks like without visiting the web cam. I am thinking that it 
 can only handle so many visitors at one time. Please leave those spots for 
 residents, friends and family that are not here, that may want to check the 
 weather conditions. I give the address to friends and family, out of town, 
 that want to check up on me. They always report&quot;Ready&quot;and black screen. I 
 think that is because too many of us go there and leave it there. It does 
 not disconnect after 10 minutes, I have tried. Check it and leave, please. 
 Thank you. Stay safe.

 this practice Personal hurricane shelters ? You are kidding right? Can&apos;t you dummies see a con when it hits you in the 
 wallet? You are 150 miles out to sea, live with it or leave! To the guys who like fat, out of shape women, we know you&apos;re stuck with one, and misery loves company, but come on, you&apos;re making us sick in the stomach with your revolting postings. 
 Fat chicks are good for one thing, bait! Brotherly love . 
 Re: Can&apos;t evacuate because you don&apos;t have transportation?  Are 
 you from New Orleans or what? We the People are getting sick and tired of 
 you cry babies who want to blame every body else for your problems and get 
 everything for free. Grow up, wise up, or get out! 


Buzzards are the only birds that can fart!  You&apos;ve never been 
 drinking beer at the Tiki Bars, have you? Gee, a Miniature golf course  at Boondocks. What&apos;s next? A Bowling for Dollars 
 lawn, an automated welfare machine? How about a walk through foot wash for 
 the s**t-kickers who go there? The Lower Keys are aptly named! To all my friends in the Keys , please 
 take care! 
 The large 
 construction project at Boondocks is not going to be a caveman or a cow. It 
 is going to be a huge statue of the Bacon Grease Woman . Its going 
 to erupt every 15 minutes. Designers say that this will be the most 
 difficult hole on the course to reach. Wonder what Key West would look like without tourist ? 
 
 The single, young, hair on the head, and teeth in

 young here, we all have to work on Saturday mornings! That makes late 
 nights on Friday very rare! Tell us where the decent girls are and we 
 will be there!

 Personal hurricane shelters. The emergency 
 services personal and medical staff will still be here in their own 
 shelters; and for those who didn&apos;t stock up, FEMA should have emergency 
 stockpiles in the public shelters throughout the Keys. We have to think 
 about hurricanes differently if we want to really save lives. What&apos;s up with the Post Office closing on Wednesday? 
 Talk about poor leadership. 
 Re: single, younger, hair 
 on your head and teeth in your mouth guys. Sorry to tell you, but 
 they&apos;re all in Key West gay bars. For those with transportation . First off, It&apos;s your own fault you don&apos;t have 
 transportation and live on Islands. Secondly, Key West has been running 
 busses to the Miami area for people with no transportation since 
 Wednesday. If you&apos;re still here you&apos;re just here to complain. How does our Editor decide what postings 
 contain names and what ones don&apos;t? I have seen many similar postings 
 where some contain names and some do not. Someone else commented on that 
 a few weeks back and our wonderful Editor wormed his way out of it. Furthermore, oh wonderful Editor, where is your Name and or email address?   Examples below. This one had person&apos;s email.  Please note that a 
 product name is mentioned, not a company or person:   &quot;Did anyone happen to listen to Biz Baz this morning 
 and hear that bimbo from the Nextel company? I thought we were rid 
 of her when she moved down to the Key West store but now she has to call 
 our radio show. She is a piece of work. I would bet the class she 
 skipped most often in school was English Grammar. I wonder if Nextel has 
 heard the way she talks on public radio when promoting their name.&quot;   Let&apos;s have some consistency Mr. Editor.
 (Ed: I&apos;m sorry you were offended, but the two examples [that I didn&apos;t 
 print for space reasons] you cited were complaining about a 
 business--W/D, and your comment was to criticized a real person--the 
 Nextel lady. There is a big difference.) 


This is for real! Is 
 Your Printer Spying on You? Has anyone seen this website? A friend sent it to 
 me. It is kind of like an Ebay and all around classified ad in one. I 
 have found some pretty cool stuff there. http://miami.craigslist.org/ Why in today&apos;s society would someone 
 actually post on a website that they were&quot; gone down on &quot;for all to 
 read? I realize that the posts are anonymous, however, that is pushing 
 the edge. If this guy is so great, leave your lackadaisical, tongue 
 less husband and move in with him. Apparently since he took the time to 
 call a few days later or even the next day--he might be worth it. If your 
 husband/significant other is worthless, leave! Don&apos;t go bringing more bad 
 into the marriage/relationship! 


Pritham Singh ? He is the loss of horizon! I want to encourage the guy who likes fat, out of 
 shape women . I wish there were more of you as it would lessen 
 competition for the thin women in the Keys. You may want to move (back?) 
 to Michigan. It has the fattest women in the country. And if you are in 
 reality a fat woman writing in as a man, shame on you. 

That under-construction centerpiece of the miniature golf course  next 
 to the Cow Palace now appears to have four legs. I am beginning to agree 
 with the submitter last week; this is going to be a big cow. Moo. I need to vent, rant and rave . Don&apos;t read it 
 if you don&apos;t want to hear it. Why do people smoke marijuana. every friggin&apos; day? Especially if they smoke cigs too? I mean c&apos;mon already, how old are 
 you? You&apos;re not in college anymore, you have to smoke every single day? The only thing I may need every day is my medicine prescribed by a doctor 
 so I can live. Perhaps some food and water. What ever happened to just 
 now and then?  I&apos;m just so sick of it. He&apos;s a liar too. I recently 
 caught him lying again. He had a secret cell phone with three other 
 woman&apos;s numbers in them. He had 3 different BS excuses of why. He just 
 didn&apos;t want to tell me so he,&quot;didn&apos;t have to hear my&quot;s**t&quot;. Guys, do 
 you really think it&apos;s OK to lie over and over again and not get s**t for 
 it?  How about this? Don&apos;t give us anything to complain about and we 
 won&apos;t. Be honest, true and loving. Treat us well, rub our feet, satisfy 
 us and we will go to the ends of the earth for you. Why is this so hard?? 
Another peeve; let me tell you guys us woman don&apos;t appreciate cat&quot;whistle&quot;calls, it doesn&apos;t turn us on.   Frankly, it grosses me out. Whistle at me and say, oh,&quot;hot mama&quot; doesn&apos;t make me feel beautiful. You 
 can&apos;t&quot;touch&quot;me because you don&apos;t like to be touched?  What the hell is 
 wrong with you?  The worst thing is he believes his own BS. Very sad.  
He runs a small business and keeps his employees on full payroll year 
 round.  Yeah, great guy provides for his staff and their family, but can&apos;t 
 provide for his own. He never has any cash. Says he doesn&apos;t pay for his&quot;stuff&quot;. He works for it, hmmm then why don&apos;t you ever have any money? Ladies be warned. He will be looking for his next victim very soon. This 
 guy has all his teeth, a job, decent to look at and is extremely 
 charming to woo you. He may seem like a good catch in the beginning but 
 be warned. He is never to be trusted. I truly believe at this point he&apos;s 
 just a pathological liar and just doesn&apos;t know the difference. If you 
 take him in he will lie and deceive like no other. Oh, also he is 
 manipulative, controlling and physically abusive. I am disappointed that 
 I stayed as long as I did.  Thank god there are no kids involved.  I can&apos;t 
 wait for this damn storm to be over with so I can find my own place 
 and erase him from my memory forever. Hopefully he&apos;ll eventually leave 
 and go back to his hick town where he can smoke up till he dies of 
 cancer.  

Time for some new bands here in the lower Keys. Dirt Band, Conch 
 Republic, Moondogs, Jack Nasty, Bo and the Hitchhikers. Same old songs, 
 same old dumb lines. Time to update. I am sorry that you have had an unpleasant experience 
 at Keys Sea Center . I have been doing business there since the mid 
 eighty&apos;s with both the old and new owners and my service has been nothing 
 but first rate and professional. The new owners have gone out of their 
 way to assist me with my needs and they have always done it in a friendly 
 way. Ed: What&apos;s up . I have sent posting 
 twice and they have not been posted. I thought the first was perhaps lost 
 in cyber space, but twice in a row? Stolen from www.bigpinekey.com , check out this site 
 for some fun Halloween bowling. Cat lovers , please don&apos;t be offended, its

The fact is, according to those in the know, that if Al Gore were 
 president none of these storms would have happened. The only problem is we 
 would have been bored to death a long time ago. I don&apos;t know where all the single, younger, hair 
 on your head and teeth in your mouth guys hang out, but I do know 
 where bloated, chain smoking, hairier than skunk ape, tattooed behemoths 
 hang out--the bovine palace. 
 J im Cantore was broadcasting 
 from Key Largo last night! Run away, run away! The only center we have here on BPK is the 
 AARP and the W/D social center W hat&apos;s up with the dirty looking 
 women who lives in her car at Winn Dixie? Her car is full to the brim 
 with junk. And she has cats living in that cramped car. I fell sorry for 
 her, but are those animals suffering in that hot car? I was in no way 
 bashing you, just stating about the great customer service offered at Ace Big Pine. I did not say anything bad about Ace on Summerland or 
 about you. Maybe you should go back and read what I wrote and not try to 
 read in between the lines. I am sorry to see that Monkey is gone from Ace 
 Big Pine, a very down to earth person. I think we have many stores right 
 here on Big Pine, that offer great customer service, so why go else where. For the best pizza in town, it&apos;s 2 for 20 in the 
 Marshall building. Great subs and wings too. Kudos to Joe, Phil, Leo, David 
 and the rest of the staff. 


A cat has 32 muscles in each ear. 
 RE: Tim Dorsey The bar is 
 No Name Pub. Take the right fork at light in Big Pine (Wilder). Left at stop

 Wilma! Parrotdise will be closed from Thursday 
 Oct 20 until Monday Oct 24. I see an ad in the houses for sale part of the 
 classifieds for the following:   Ramrod Key. Breezeswept Estates. 3+/2.5+. 
 Concrete 60 ft seawall, boat lift, davits. 1868 s/f and more. w/ 2 ton 
 AC&apos;s. Wrap around walkway, deck, 24 x 10 covered screen porch off pocket 
 door LR&amp;DR. Cathedral tongue and groove cedar ceilings. $895,000 owner 
 agent, brokers welcome.   There is no contact information for the owner or how 
 to see this house. If the person who placed the ad is reading can you 
 please post your contact information? I would put my contact information 
 but I do not want to be flooded by Realtors telling me about all of their 
 houses that are&quot;Great Deals.&quot; 
What does anyone know or would be willing to say about Pritham Singh the Marathon developer? And what is the name of the bar that Tim Dorsey writes about in his latest book? And how do you get there? Did anyone happen to listen to Biz Baz this morning 
 and hear that bimbo from the Nextel company? I thought we were rid 
 of her when she moved down to the Key West store but now she has to call 
 our radio show. She is a piece of work. I would bet the class she 
 skipped most often in school was English Grammar. I wonder if Nextel has 
 heard the way she talks on public radio when promoting their 
 name.--DickLarge1@aol.com Personal hurricane shelters address 
 survival at the outset but what about after storm&apos;s passage? When Monroe 
 County evacuates, there is no emergency medical services available. Home 
 shelters should also include personal protection (and I don&apos;t mean condoms). 
 You may be prepared to survive but others who choose to stay may not 
 otherwise be prepared. Hungry and thirsty people can become desperate as 
 Katrina showed. From the perspective of the goverment or insurance 
 companies, I can&apos;t see the benefits of personal hurricane shelters. Risk is 
 still incurred after storm passage. 


Taking cat loving a bit too far. What is up with the people who own Sea 
 Center ? I mean, the guys who work there are great (except one of the 
 front desk guys) but the owners walk around like they are royalty and treat 
 their workers like monkeys. What is up with that? Come on, you own a 
 business on Big Pine Key, barely on the frigging map. Get over your 
 important selves! A crocodile cannot stick out its tongue. 
 Personal hurricane shelters should be subsidized 
 by the government. That&apos;s what they did in the fifty&apos;s during the nuclear 
 scare. They gave you a flat cash amount and tax credits. We could do that 
 here if we can only get the county to think in a different direction. If I 
 were to evacuate for Whilma I wouldn&apos;t even know where to go. It looks the 
 storms going right up Florida. Cat humor. http://www.club300.ru/public/content/media/humor/cat_new/cat_new.swf 


The Houston Astros won the National League Championship, but nobody 
 rioted! What local civic center ? I have animals too 
 and am not leaving them behind. Ok, I have been reading about this guy for months 
 now. Who is this emphasis wonderful lover? Or should I call him Magic 
 Tongue ? Or should I call him walking STD? I, too, vote for personal ads to stay in the 
 personal ads column. Please, enough. By no means was I bashing Ace in Big Pine . 
 They are a great bunch of people also. I was just stating the position of 
 the great service that I appreciate everyday at Summerland. I appreciate 
 that you like Big Pine, but I see no reason to bash me for saying something 
 nice about someone else. To the person 
 or persons who absconded with my brand new Ryobi Weed 
 Wacker . Please at your 
 convenience return and pick up additional attachments. I would not want 
 the thief who stole this to be without said attachments. jakbil@bellsouth.net Everyone please be safe and evacuate if you 
 can. I hate for anything to happen to all my loved ones or anybody else 
 for that matter. Welcome back Ed; just in time huh? All of you married people are recommending against having sex with a new partner due to the fear of disease. So 
 what are we single guys supposed to do? Just where are we supposed to evacuate 
 to? If there was any remaining doubt Brownie was not.&quot;doing a heck of a job.&quot; http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051020/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/katrina_fema Since&quot; Mr. Tongue for Hire &quot;doesn&apos;t seem to 
 discriminate, how about hooking him up with the Bacon Grease girl? Let&apos;s 
 make sure this is safe sex, however, and strap a 2 X 4 to his back. We 
 don&apos;t want to lose such a quality professional gentleman.   The guy who 
 writes in saying he has hooked up with model looking girls and big girls 
 forgot to mention that when he dated the models he was pleasured at his 
 own hand. We all have to put it somewhere and I would rather put mine in 
 a bigger girl than my smaller hand. The few times I have been with a 
 little Barbi doll girl I felt like I was doing a child. I felt dirty. I 
 like my women to have breasts and a bottom I can grab . With that 
 being said, give a big girl a try, you just might fall in love. Old Key West saying : &quot;What to do for a hurricane: Nail it, Glue it, Tape it, Tie it, Chain it, 
 Weight it, Pool it, Anchor it, Clamp it, Weld it, Solder it, Rivet it, and 
 if you&apos;re still in doubt...Screw it!&quot; I have no transportation how the hell do 
 I get out of here! Hey Guys, My nose is killin me, I can&apos;t find any bond info on the arrest made  at HoM and Key Deer for gambling. It 
 seems that all those folks could not have been released on there O.R.

Where do all the single, younger, hair on your head and teeth in your 
 mouth guys go on Friday nights around here? I haven&apos;t seen any in Big 
 Pine Key. I would like to weigh in regarding the hardware store wars . Summerland Hardware is one of two of the greatest 
 run businesses in Monroe County. The other is Beckman&apos;s NAPA in Marathon. 
 These two entrepreneurs hold a standard of excellence that would exhaust any 
 other of the best of what is available in this county, and likely much of 
 south Fla.
I could go on with accolades, but I will just say; they care enough about 
 their community to stay open Sundays, and to last minutes when hurricanes 
 are imminent. What is discouraging is most of the patrons are too ignorant 
 to know the difference. This is the reason Winn Dixie hasn&apos;t evaporated ( I 
 haven&apos;t been for more than a year, and won&apos;t be back although I live next to 
 them), and any number of businesses here owned by slovenly one way slackers. 
 Personally, I have a theory that the reason rotten businesses flourish here, 
 may be that most of the resident patrons either directly or indirectly feed 
 from the public trough (recipients of tax money through contracts or 
 salary), and wouldn&apos;t recognize good services and quality products if they 
 lived a thousand years. My premise is; a sub-standard is perfectly 
 acceptable to those who never hold themselves accountable, and who excel at 
 nothing but being parasites.

Yabba, Dabba , Do. Watch out for Wilma! Re: evacuation plan. If you can&apos;t afford to leave 
 just head to a local civic center and all will be taken care of. FEMA still doesn&apos;t know where evacuees are. The Red Cross and federal 
 government said Tuesday that they had been significantly overreporting the 
 number of Hurricane Katrina evacuees in hotels. Instead of 600,000 people, 
 200,000 remain in hotels, the charity said. Although the lower number means 
 that the FEMA and cities receiving evacuees will find new housing for far 
 fewer people, the count shows the lack of knowledge that FEMA has about the 
 relocations and its limited oversight over the money it is committed to 
 spend on such housing. On 
 another October 19, in 1899, a 17 year-old Robert Goddard  climbed a 
 cherry tree on a beautiful autumn afternoon in Worcester, Massachusetts. 
 Inspired by H.G. Wells&apos; War of the Worlds and gazing out across a meadow, 
 young Goddard imagined it would be wonderful to make a device that had the 
 possibility of ascending to Mars. Forever more he felt his life had a 
 purpose and in the following years his diary entries record October 19th 
 as&quot;Anniversary Day&quot;, the anniversary of his ascent into the cherry tree. 
 By 1926 he had designed, built, and flown the 
 world&apos;s first liquid fuel rocket. Mars is just visible through the trees 
 at the lower right in this dramatic sky view that also features the Moon 
 and Venus -- all visited by liquid fuel rockets constructed on principles 
 developed by Goddard. We own 6 high 
 power assault weapons and 4 semi-auto high capacity pistols! because we can own them. And for the uniformed person who said there&apos;s 
 nowhere to use them in the Keys you evidently have never heard of the Gun 
 Club in Key Largo, huh? Or have gone out to international waters and blew 
 up a few hundred floating targets. And besides, just ask the residents 
 of new Orleans how well the Gov&apos;t was able to protect them. Personal hurricane shelters sound like a grand 
 idea, but why should the government (read that&quot;us taxpayers&quot;) build 
 them? Why would you want a government-built-by-the-lowest-bidder 
 shelter? The best, most reliable help comes from your own initiative. Work together, leave the government out of it. Job opportunities: I know you all 
 were looking for ways to make a living. In N. O. there are signs up on the 
 Burger King and other places offering $6000 signing bonus for a one year 
 contract to work there. They will make $10 an hour for one year. Too bad 
 there is no housing for the workers there. 
Does anyone remember not too long ago when the gas prices where over $3 
 for 87% octane and the difference between regular 87% premium 93% octane 
 was $.20. And why is it back to the $.30 spread and gas is cheaper 
 now? Does that mean higher profits? I wonder if the guy writing in about Ace Summerland is an employee, the same guy who used to write in about Ace on Big pine 
 when he was an employee there. I see no reason to go to Ace on Summerland 
 when we have an Ace here on Big Pine with great customer service. The new 
 girl at Ace Big Pine is always friendly and helpful and the tall shaved head 
 guy that works at Ace Big Pine has always serviced me well. 
 

I didnt know that police salaries were based on their weight. That 
 certainly explains a lot. Has anyone spotted Jim Cantore yet? He is 
 like the Angel of Doom. Keep him away from the Keys. We would like to see, 
 however, a few Weather Channel babes down here. Did you read about the guy trying to screw a horse ? 
 Talk about a sicko. He reminds me of my ex brother-in-law who used to do 
 chickens. Guys, stick to Heifers. Support your local Cow Palace. 

I have slept with Barbies and I have slept with porkers. No contest; 
 the in-shape women are much better in the sack. And they don&apos;t clean out 
 your refrigerator when you are asleep. Y ou need to update webcam page .  Away 
 with Rita on with Wilma.  (Ed: Thanks. Will do.) I was at 
 the Winn-Dixie and the automatic check-out machine was giving me 
 grief. A young woman who worked there tried to help, but I quickly learned 
 she didn&apos;t speak English. I spoke to her in Spanish and she helped me out. I 
 guess the bottom line is either they hire folks who can speak English or we 
 have to learn Spanish. Is this a great country or what? Tiene un buen 
 dia. Donde esta las chicas gordas 
Look for the Orionid Meteors This Friday. The Orionid meteor shower will peak Oct. 21 just before dawn. Although light 
 from the full moon may make viewing difficult, you can still catch the 
 brightest&quot;shooting stars&quot;if the sky i s 
 clear. I like the suggestion about reporting the drug 
 dealing areas in here and also to the police. As much as I hate 
 hearing people down here saying how they&quot;Used to do it up North,&quot;I think 
 the area I lived in up North had a great success story with drug dealing 
 and prostitution. The not only focused on the dealers and prostitutes but 
 more so on the buyers and the Johns. The dealers and prostitutes have no 
 shame so arrest the person buying the dope or hiring the prostitute and 
 put their names, addresses and photos in the news papers. That will 
 greatly decrease the buyers and Johns if they think they will become 
 public news. If there are no customers the dealers will soon go out of 
 business and move somewhere else. 


I knew Wilhelmina Harvey would be back one day. Just in time for 
 Goombay and Fantasy Fest. Her favorite celebrations in the Keys! Why is it that Paradise Petroleum always runs out of gas before an evacuation? Do they not want the hassle of 
 50000 cars pulling in or is there another reason. They have in the past 
 always been available to people that needed help. What gives? I was so glad to see a guy writing in today saying&quot;Kudos 
 to those women who answered that&quot; Booty Call&quot;personal ad . I&apos;m glad 
 you had a good time. Apparently there are some folks out there who are hung 
 up about sex. Remember, if it weren&apos;t for lust, none of us would be here.&quot;It is nice to see a man agreeing with us girls on this issue. I am one of 
 the women who has written in about how I enjoyed the company of the as he 
 put it,&quot;Booty Call&quot;personal ad. He was commenting on a posting a 
 girlfriend of mine who also went out the Booty Call guy. Unfortunatly her 
 posting got butchered by our Editor. I will be surprised if this one doesn&apos;t 
 get edited and my message is conveyed totaly wrong just like hers was. The 
 point she was trying to make and I also want to stress wasn&apos;t just to tell 
 the world we both ahd sex with this guy. We did have sex with him and it was 
 great sex. That is true.
 It 
 seems to be the topic of conversation that he likes to give women oral 
 pleasure and is great at it. That is true, he does do it and is great at it 
 but that also was not the point we were trying to make. Now for the points 
 she was trying to make and I want to make too unless the editor slashes my 
 email here. We wanted to let the guys who don&apos;t treat their girl friends and 
 wives know that when we women are treated well we will treat you better. 
 This goes both in and out of the bedroom. We also wanted to send a tip to 
 the girlfriends and wives who are not being treated right in or out of the 
 bedroom to look the&quot;Booty Call Personal Ad Guy&quot;up. He will treat you great 
 emotionaly and mentaly then even better physicaly. The sexual enjoyment was 
 heavenly while it was happening, no doubt about it. I highly recomend any 
 girl who needs it and needs it good give him a try.

The part that was better than the sex was the rest. The compliments, the 
 phone call just to let me know he had a great time. Another call a couple 
 days later not for sex but just to say hi. On our second date he shopwed up 
 with flowers. He complimented me and told me I looked good. He told me I was 
 a wonderfull kisser. Telling me he enjoys being with me. Even if it was BS 
 it still makes a girl feel good. So the point being, guys if you treat us 
 well out of bed we will treat you better in bed. Girls, if you need a date 
 where you will be treated like gold out of the bed and need to be treated 
 better in the bed, Look him up. Specail hint girls,&quot;Magic Tongue.&quot;Now Mr. 
 Editor, I hope you don&apos;t butcher or change this and print it just as it is. I am not ashamed that I like a gentleman out of the bedroom and appreciate 
 being taken care of in the bedroom.
 (Ed: If you want your email and name printed please place a free 
 classified ad under Personals.) I&apos;m glad someone else has had their &quot;kudo&apos;s and whiners&quot;changed . I wondered if I was crazy when I read my 
 article a few weeks ago. It had really been changed to fit the editor&apos;s 
 idea of sensationalism and the meaning of it was all ass backwards. Most 
 of the postings are fun to read though. What 
 hapened to the Gossip Column ? Does anyone know it&apos;s Wednesday? Yes, I 
 know about the hurricane. Still nothing since Sunday. I miss you. Please 
 post something and I hope all is well. Our prayers are with you during this 
 next hurdle.

 http://minibytes.mondominishows.com/poo/affiliates/play.asp?Affil=iwon&amp;W Re: Gambling raid. I&apos;m sure the ski 
 masks were used so that those deputies could still be our neighbors and 
 walk the streets and stop in for a beer off duty without ridicule. Just 
 doing their job. I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll wear the masks more and more in the 
 future as we go further and further down this road of Disneyfing the 
 country. Son&apos;s award winning video. Those are the worst video clips I have ever seen. That&apos;s not even the 
 producer&apos;s real name. What gives? I wrote in yesterday and it was the second time 
 your editing staff changed what I wrote and printed it different. How 
 many other people is this happening to? ED, please either print things&quot;as 
 is&quot;or not at all. Of course they will probably change this too. (I&apos;m sorry, 
 but we did change this one for clarity. Sometimes in peoples hast to get 
 their point across they don&apos;t take the time to proof read their statements; 
 and if no one can understand them--what&apos;s the point.) 
 Money 
 laundering . I heard yesterday that a customer at Key Deer Bar saw the 
 bartender accidentally drop two bills in a sink full of soapy water while 
 giving another customer his change. The bartender fished the bills out of 
 the water, wiped them dry and placed them on the bar along with the other 
 change. The individual immediately called Crime Stoppers to report the 
 incident. Key Deer is now under intense investigation for money laundering 
 and a major raid is planned on the sink!   
 If the KKK is going to exist in the Keys, they 
 had better work at getting more black folks down here. It is a little 
 difficult to rally against 5-10 people. Maybe the KKK could advertise in 
 the Atlanta and Detroit newspapers and persuade black people to move to 
 the Keys- as it stands, the pickins here are a little slim (unlike most 
 KKK members). I love the South Park cow! I can&apos;t wait to see 
 how it will look at the miniature golf course. What a cool idea. Question: 
 If you putt into it&apos;s mouth, where will the ball come out? Maybe the people who witness the drug dealing should report it to the Red Neck with the high powered deer rifle. He can 
 just shoot them after he puts down his 16 Oz Natural Ice. The same thing 
 happened to me the other day. I hadn&apos;t been to Winn-Dixie in a very long 
 time, so thought I&apos;d check out the new improvements. There was a very long 
 line at the single cash register that was open, so I tried the self checkout 
 lane. I needed some help, but the Spanish-speaking&quot;helper&quot; watching 
 me had a big attitude, since I interrupted her personal conversation with 
 another employee. First, I think it&apos;s rude to ignore a customer while 
 conversing in another language that the customer can&apos;t understand. Her job 
 was to help people -- why couldn&apos;t she just do that? AOL Visa with Chase 
 (formerly Bank One) has reward points to use for free AOL: 1-800-587-1354. You can probably find info on AOL&apos;s home page where they solicit 
 non-members, though I haven&apos;t been there in quite a while. I just want to give everyone a heads up on the flu 
 vaccine : Please, check with your doctor regarding the preservative in 
 this year&apos;s vaccine. (yes, even flu shots come with preservative). Make 
 sure that it does not  contain Thimerosol . This is a 
 metabolite of mercury, and regardless of what our lovely friends at the 
 FDA say, it can cause organic brain disease, brain atrophy, Alzheimer&apos;s, 
 whatever name you want to call it. Personally, I think there is a strong 
 link between mercury (as in the vaccines) and Alzheimer&apos;s and childhood 
 autism. 
The preservative Thimerosol was supposed to have been removed from 
 future vaccine formulations, but if you don&apos;t ask, you will never know. Ask to see the product insert. And yes, I&apos;m a medical professional, in 
 case you were wondering. And no, I have never taken the flu shot. And 
 never will. I trust the FDA about as far as I could throw them. Besides, 
 if you don&apos;t let your immune system function, it will not work. That also 
 means we should all be eating good food, fruits and veggies  (well 
 washed, of course), and getting rest and sunshine (no problem there, 
 mate), along with some playtime. Yeah, most people don&apos;t have a lot of time to devote 
 to living a healthier life (or so they think), but if you can drink plenty 
 of water, and get decent sleep, that&apos;s half the battle. We really can be 
 healthier with just a little more effort. Did you know that if you drink 
 those recommended 6 to 8 glasses of water a day, your joints will function 
 better? (The ones you bend, not the ones you roll.) Oh, and here&apos;s another boring photo. Wheeeee! Hey Guys, a phone call from the ATF , would 
 have been the&quot;business like&quot;thing to do. This is a big deal and at its 
 best it will cost HoM and Dan a bunch of money, at its worst, well, it 
 will cost them there liquor license and jail time and a bigger bunch of 
 money. Like it or not ATF runs the booze business and everything under the 
 roof of that business. There was dope on some of the employees and open 
 gambling inside the building. ATF will offer them a&quot;deal&quot;they will set a 
 fine and a number of days to close both places. If they want to they can 
 fight this. If they chose to fight, ATF will ask for much more in court 
 and they will get it. Take the deal and get on with your business and 
 life. There is no winning on this one. I use GM&apos;s Master card to get 5% on all 
 my purchases towards a GM vehicle. They have a $3,000 max. I made my deal on 
 the last two vehicles I bought then told them about the credit I had accrued 
 and they knocked an addition $3,000 off the price. That sure beats using the 
 money to buy a second ISP when you&apos;re already paying for one. I am not sorry 
 to see the illegal gambling stopped . It could have been done better, 
 but the masterminds of the raid were from out-of-county. Not knowing it was 
 illegal, I would have happily ponied up $30, if I would have been able to 
 get my spouse to go with me. He won&apos;t frequent places, for pleasure, where 
 he is likely to witness drug transactions; which is what happened the one 
 time we visited the HoM. And, unfortunately, he puts the Key Deer in the 
 same basket. I don&apos;t know how long the tournaments have been going on, but 
 if someone reported them in May, that&apos;s +/- 5 months. Five months of 15% 
 could possibly be a good chunk of change. Someone please tell me what local 
 charities benefited from these charity tournaments. Give me an accounting or 
 some testimonials from these charities and I too will cry foul. 
 A local 
 establishment will have a legal fee fund raiser for those caught up 
 in the big poker game raid. Locations to be announced. We will have lots 
 of 50/50 drawings, cash prize raffles, poker, craps, blackjack, baccarat, 
 roulette, wheel of fortune, slot machines, and Mugs Manicotti the sports 
 book from Miami will be on hand to take all of your sports and racing bets. Lots of moonshine will be sold, recreational party favors will be 
 available, lap dances and back room rub-a-dubs to the highest bidders and 
 deep throat specialist Stormy Daze will demonstrate her technique at five 
 and eight oclock. Three lucky winners will assist her. Prohibited but 
 tasty Russian Beluga caviar will appear on the High Rollers Buffett along 
 with locally harvested Queen Conch, succulent Goliath Grouper filet stuffed 
 with young short lobster and Key Deer Wellington will be among the select 
 items to satisfy the discriminating palate. A portion of the proceeds will 
 go to charity with the remainder given to the accused to assist them with 
 their legal fees. Since it took the task force several months to figure out 
 how to handle the original problem we should be O.K. for a one day event. There is a 
 difference between playing poker at home with friends and running a 
 poker game in established businesses and advertising it to draw more 
 business into those establishments. No matter where you are in this country, 
 gambling is illegal unless it is specified not so by law. Why weren&apos;t those 
 guys running those games playing in their own homes? Because it was a game 
 played in a public bar. Break the law, pay the consequences. So let&apos;s announce on this website the crossroads where drugs are being sold on a daily basis and see if the 
 cops pick up on that one. I let a cop that moved into my neighborhood know 
 where a nightly situation was happening and he put an end to that 
 situation immediately. How about going to the substation and bugging the 
 command officer about the places where the drugs are sold. How about 
 writing to one of our free newspapers about it. Public outcry actually 
 works here. Maybe go talk to the local county commissioner also. You know 
 that old saying about the squeaky wheel getting the grease. Don&apos;t give up. 
 I have teenagers! You ask why would a person living in the Keys 
 would own a gun .? Here we go again back to our constitutional right 
 to own guns. Read your constitution please. Think about the proven results 
 of taking away people&apos;s right to own a gun. In England and Australia where 
 gun ownership rights were taken away, violent crimes have increased 
 dramatically because only the criminals own guns now.
 In Europe 
 before the second world war, Dutch nationalists&apos; right to own guns was taken 
 away subsequently the Nazi&apos;s just walked in and took over their country. Gun 
 ownership doesn&apos;t mean those who have them are going to shoot everybody they 
 meet. On the contrary, non criminal gun owners aren&apos;t violent. You probably 
 wouldn&apos;t know one if you met one. Many of those people you are classifying 
 as&quot;redneck&quot;aren&apos;t. They are just unschooled. Are you feeling a right to 
 tell the rest of us that live in the Keys that a person has a right to own a 
 gun or not. What choices we can make depends on where we live? I have lived 
 here many more years than you (apparently) and I lock my doors when I leave 
 because I don&apos;t feel comfortable with many of the people that have moved 
 here over the past 15 years. I&apos;m amazed at how quick people bash posters 
 personally rather than try to respond unemotionally and rationally. I 
 know this is tough via email when there is no enunciation to the typed 
 word. Anyways, I&apos;m the&quot;lily white, ignorance of the law is no excuse&quot;person. My comments never mentioned how the games were raided. If 
 officials chose to use guns and masks, that sure seems overboard to me. I&apos;m not a police officer and I don&apos;t know tactics or why they use them the 
 way they do. But I do know something about gambling and non-profits ! I commented that charity poker tournaments can be done and done legally. The bar owners obviously asked the wrong people for advice. Seriously 
 though...15% of the proceeds for the charity? Church bingos and local 
 fishing tournaments give a lot more. If held weekly, restrictions 
 increase. Yes, I&apos;ve helped out many non-profits. Heck, I&apos;m in Rotary!    As for being lily white, I own a condo in Vegas where 
 I visit often. I can recommend some good online betting sites that I 
 personally use but you won&apos;t get the same good point spreads that you can 
 get in Vegas. Also, there are several floating poker games in the Keys 
 where $35 might cover an opening hand. I have supported local bingo games 
 and the majority of the proceeds go to local charity. They make it clear 
 who is getting the money, too. I still don&apos;t know what charities received 
 the money from these&quot;fund raisers.&quot; Rule of thumb, if 50% or more isn&apos;t 
 going to charity, you&apos;re going to get busted. A way to make these more 
 legal would be for all money to go to a designated charity and for the bar 
 to issue gift certificates to the winners. After all, I&apos;m sure the money 
 won was going to be poured back into the bar.  Time to get 
 serious about another hurricane . Computer models are all beginning 
 to converge and it appears to be heading straight for the Keys.   A great site to go to for hurricane info is www.wunderground.com . Click on&quot;Tropical&quot;and then&quot;Wilma&quot;  The&quot;Discussion&quot;section is always more 
 informative than the latest public advisories are and the&quot;Computer 
 Models&quot;area is really good. There is also a good 5 day map. This one 
 bears watching. To the mental midget who commented about anyone 
 with a gun going back to New York: While the other parties comments 
 were not defendable, your anti fire arms, anti second amendment, comment 
 showed even lower inelegance than the person that you were degrading. I 
 personally think that you should give them a lift back to New York.   Always drink 
 upstream from the herd. Re: Drug dealers. I have had similar 
 situations telling the law about drug dealers, thieves stealing so they 
 can buy drugs, and people who are buying drugs trespassing. It seems as 
 though the Law just plain don&apos;t give a damn about those of us who are 
 paying them to protect the innocent people who elected them. Maybe your 
 right. They could be making more money turning their heads. They should 
 get paid by the pound. Weigh each drug dealer, not the drugs, and pay them 
 according to that. Maybe that would give them the incentive they need to 
 protect the good folks in our neighborhoods. Evacuation . Does 
 anybody out there in our government have a plan to get the many people who 
 survive check to check out of here? With my old Ford diesel pickup, and fuel 
 prices, I can&apos;t afford to get away from the storm. Does Bush, (any of them) 
 Red Cross, FEMA, or anyone have a solution to this problem? Cuba does, why 
 can&apos;t we? We are certainly going to miss Garry Freeland in 
 the mornings on US 1 Radio . His last day is this Friday - call and 
 wish him well. We are. He&apos;s been a delight to wake up to in the mornings 
 and his trivia has always been fun to listen to. Good Luck Garry in the 
 mainland! Re: Redneck . I live in the Keys and, yes, own 
 firearms including a high power rifle. I travel to Key Largo and go 
 shooting at the range up there. I also have a couple of hand guns too. So 
 I guess that means I&apos;m a redneck. I like to protect my family on trips 
 when we leave the Keys. Also there are more people then you think on Big 
 Pine with concealed weapons permits and other firearms. The right to bear 
 arms is the United States not just in redneck areas. Still no comments on personal hurricane 
 shelters ? I think I saw the missing Mutt Lucky chasing a young doe on big pine. He better go home. For those of 
 you with a few spare moments try this. Go to www.google.com . 
 Type in the word, Failure. Then, instead of clicking on Google search, click 
 on I&apos;m Felling Lucky. Watch what comes up! Have a good laugh before they fix 
Big Girls do it better. The bigger the cushion the better the 
 pushing. If I want to date a Barbie Doll I&apos;d buy a Barbie Doll. It seems to me that during that staged Q&amp;A 
 between Bush and the members of the 42nd Infantry Division last week, it 
 was Bush who needed to be coached, not the soldiers. The man is a cartoon. 
 No wonder we are the laughing stock of the planet. If you want Free AOL Card. Go to AOL Visa.. (800) 265-6524. I&apos;ve had it for a few years. It works 
Re: Cuba--poor health care? The writer should 
 learn more about the world beyond his door before saying that Cuba has poor 
 health care. In fact they have the best health care in the world and 
 everyone is entitled to it. Also, everyone is educated. Don&apos;t be listening 
 to those Miami Cubans . Kudos to those women who answered that &quot;Booty Call&quot;  personal ad. I&apos;m glad you had a good time. Apparently there 
 are some folks out there who are hung up about sex. Remember, if it weren&apos;t 
 for lust, none of us would be here. And to the guy who placed the ad, dude 
 you are my Hero. It&apos;s tough finding single women in the Keys. Good luck. If you want to see great customer service. Go to Summerland Ace Hardware . They have the best and friendliest staff in 
 the lower Keys. 

I really miss the leaves changing . I also miss the raking I had to 
 do when they fell off the trees. I also miss the 6 months of crappy, cold 
 weather that followed the leaves dropping. Gee I wish I lived back up 
 North. (see any sarcasm here?)

 Service with 
 a smile? Yes, some things are changing for the better at Winn-Dixie as 
 one writer said but they have a long, long way to go before they get the 
 Customer Service thing. Im tired of the cranky old woman in the deli 
 section acting like a request for a pound of shaved ham is a personal burden 
 for her. (I now buy all my deli meats at Aromas) Im really tired of the 
 immature attitudes of the children at the so called Customer Service 
 Counter. On a recent visit, using the self-checkout lanes I realized I 
 forgot my glasses and couldnt read the SKU numbers on three items of 
 produce. I asked for assistance from an employee who seemed to be watching 
 over the self-serve lanes and was greeted with a great sigh of disgust for 
 interrupting her personal conversation. While she assisted me she made it 
 clear I was disturbing her as she continued her conversation in Spanish 
 doing her best to ignore me. When she finished assisting me with my three 
 items I got another big sigh as she walked away. Winn-Dixie just doesnt 
 get it in terms of service with a smile.   I am sick of reading about 
 answering a personal ad and having oral sex with a stranger. Your 
 pathetic sex life sounds nasty, desperate, and cheap. Save it for an X-rated 
 message board, or working the street. Ugh. No wonder there&apos;s no money left for us. Gov officials give themselves huge raises every year, and we get pennies, if 
 at all. What is wrong with this picture? 

Broken lotto machine ? Don&apos;t the people in fornt of you tell you 
 that it is broken? Seems like if they were beating the machine and cursing 
 in frustration you would get a clue. Maybe they can handle the little 
 frustrations better than you can. Busting up a poker game is silly. If the authorities did a real day&apos;s work, they would be 
 rounding up illegals. That includes theft of government programs and fraud. 
 If they are gathered up, and the US lets them stay, at least they should be 
 screened for disease. After all, Cuba and Mexico are third worlds, poor 
 health care countries.
Think about who prepares your food at Mexican and Cuban restaurants. They 
 aren&apos;t familiar with personal cleanliness standards, they are used to 
 pooping in the nearest creek. Typhoid taco, anyone? Organic potting soil . Home Depot in 
 Marathon sells a great potting mix with no chemical additives. It&apos;s called 
 Lamberts. Also, there&apos;s a type of Scott&apos;s soil wth no fertalizers. 
Hey Jazz fans. Maynard Ferguson is coming to the Coral Shores 
 Performing Arts Center in Tavernier, November 2nd. Listen to 98.7 Conch-Fm 
 for more details I heard that Target is a 
 big GOP donor. I guess the bigger you are, the more rumors. For peace of mind among 
 those concerned; the rehabbed flying squirrels will not be released 
 anywhere on the Keys Flu shots are 
 available at several doc&apos;s offices. Re: poker raid . Over kill of this sort 
 does more harm than good. I lose a little more respect for the authorities 
 every time they pull self-promoting stunts like that. Will they never learn? 
 It&apos;s just what they wait for all year. A chance to kick butt. That&apos;s all 
 they&apos;re good for. Last pictures ever taken ? Those were 
 fakes. Well, at least two of those are fake. The last one with the train is 
 Photo Shoppery. The one with the golf ball is a superimposed ball. If the 
 guy was putting the ball wouldn&apos;t be in the air with him hitting it that way 
 and not watching the ball.
 
 I see another guy is writing in complaining 
 about us women speaking our minds and saying we enjoyed going out 
 with him and liked the private contact part too. Why is it that a guy can 
 sit at any bar in the world and talk about the sex he had last night and he 
 is a hero; when if a woman mentions the sex she had and enjoyed she is a 
 tramp?
I want to set a few things straight for this complainer who is obviously 
 mistaken about what women want and like. First of all, it isn&apos;t just the 
 sex. The thing I enjoyed even more was getting a phone call the next day 
 just to say,&quot;Hi&quot;and tell me it was nice meeting me. I also enjoyed the 
 compliments paid to me. I enjoyed him listening to what I have to say. I 
 enjoyed the time we spent together after the sex just hugging. Those things 
 are what made it different from the jerk I was with for several years. 
 To the person who 
 wrote that Ignorance of the law is no excuse referring to the big 
 gambling bust. First, the business owners believed they were operating 
 within the law. They checked before starting the games and were told that 
 the charity donation kept the businesses within legal guidelines. Thats 
 why they saw no reason not to advertise openly. And the officials 
 involved used incredibly bad judgment. No one there was posing any threat 
 to them or anyone else. The open display of firearms could have resulted in 
 a very unfortunate accident. Weapons and masks were simply not necessary. And to say that .. officials 
 made the right call to stop illegal gambling before it grew into a bigger 
 problem is nonsense.  

 It wasnt 
 going to&quot;grow into anything but what it was. Cheap entertainment with some cash going to various 
 charities. Tell me, Mr. Ignorance of the law, have you or your spouse 
 ever played bingo, ever bought a square in a Super Bowl pool, ever bought a 
 50/50 ticket at a local event or how about a little side bet on the fishing 
 tournament or a baseball game.  Probably not. Youre too lily white. However while your shorts are pinching off the remaining blood to your brain 
 you still have time to find some little thing to tattle on so you can call 
 Crimestoppers. They give rewards. Youre pathetic!  Enjoy your reward. See what you folks in Big Pine are missing ?
 
 
 If there 
 was some local concerned citizen so pre-occupied with the poker games they felt compelled to snitch them off to Crimestoppers I feel sorry for 
 them for not having a life. Its holier-than-thou people like this that 
 live and breathe to try and make others bend to their narrow view of life. And for an agency like Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco (or whatever) to 
 stage a raid like they did was nothing more than ridiculous.  

 Roaring in 
 with black masks, guns drawn and belligerent was nothing more than 
 theatrics. The agency should be ashamed and the officer who authorized and 
 organized the event needs an administrative spanking with a class in 
 priorities. There were many ways to end the games without all of the 
 nonsense. Simply telling them to stop would have worked. The business 
 owners involved have my full support on this one and I have nothing but 
 contempt for the state agency responsible for an overbearing response to a 
 simple problem.  I hope the snitch can sit at home comfortable and smug 
 congratulating themselves thinking that they did their best to clean-up Big 
 Pine and not caring that they may have ruined lives. What a putz. Can someone tell me how to get the arrest report up? I clicked&quot;arrest report&quot;at the top of the page, and it says it&apos;s 
 only current up to Sept. 9th, and won&apos;t go any further. I have a bet with 
 a friend; he says the large structure under construction at the Boondock&apos;s 
 miniature golf site is going to be a big caveman. I think it is going be a 
 humongous cow, sort of like the one featured in Cow Days on South 
 Park. The winner gets a free honk from the Key&apos;s BJ lady.I can&apos;t wait.  
 Please check out these short Videos by my son 
 Brian . Mama knows won an award and is disturbing but makes a good 
 point. http://www.dflproductions.com/dwels/dwels.html Winn Dixie lotto . What&apos;s your 
 hurry? You&apos;re in Big Pine! Haven&apos;t you ever been to a restaurant where they 
 come to serve you 15 minutes after you arrive? Hello! I have reported 
 the drug dealers to the cops on Summerland and Cudjoe Key for years. On 
 Cudjoe they take turns dealing so to make it just a little hard to bust the 
 dealers, but on Summerland it is the same people still living in the same 
 place, On the weekends go to Dion&apos;s and check out the cars parked waiting 
 for the drug man to show up. I wonder if someone is getting paid to stay 
 away. Or maybe they are to busy busting f und raisers. Rob and Rachel. You guys 
 are the best. Thank you for the nice memorial for my best friend. She was 
 the greatest. Now she is where things are beautiful. Capt. Dan . Wish you would move to Ft. 
 Lauderdale. If you still have the Jersey Girl, you can sail here and park on 
 my dock with free elect. and water. They would love you here because you 
 are the best. You always have put other peoples needs before yours. I bet 
 you have never met a stranger just a lot of strange people in BP. Love you 
 and don&apos;t let them get you down.  I love this time of 
 year . It is so beautiful at sunset and the moon is just amazing! Enjoy 
 it people. I see someone 
 calling another person a Red Neck in here for wanting to start a 
 chapter of the KKK. Then the same person calling someone a Red Neck 
 announces that he owns a high powered deer rifle and lives in The Florida 
 Keys. Isn&apos;t that a case of the African calling the Haitian black? Who is 
 the Red Neck here?   Why would anyone own such a weapon in The Keys? I 
 don&apos;t even have a lock on my door and haven&apos;t for the over 15 years living 
 here. There is no hunting allowed in The Keys. Nobody who is not a 
 police officer should own a gun here. Go back to New York. 
 I don&apos;t exercise because it makes the ice jump right out of my glass. Obviously one concerned citizen saw the 
 activity as illegal and reported it. If you see crime happening in Big Pine 
 or anyplace else call Crimestoppers ! They give rewards!
It saddens me greatly to think one person or more persons with demented 
 thinking that an actual serious crime was occurring that it was inflicting 
 harm on another or stealing from another and it scares the hell out of me 
 that so many law enforcement officers felt that they had to play like they 
 were the A Team or Gestapo or something and waste money and cause 
 unnecessary grief in others lives. Do you really think a Sergeant, 
 lieutenant or Captain could not take time to visit these establishments and 
 warn the owners of the legal implications concerning this type of fund 
 raiser. Sounds like entrapment or setup to me in my humble opinion. Are the 
 police up for election soon? 


It would be so cool to have Bicycle Joanie and the Elvis guy giving out 
 samples at Winn Dixie. I would love it. I spend a lot there, probably about 
 $150 per week, and that would be great! What credit card do you use to get the free AOL ?

Re: BP Liquor sold . I&apos;ll miss seeing Susan&apos;s cheerful face, but at

 guys. Re: Elvis fan: Why don&apos;t you go to work at 
 Winn Dixie even for a few hours or is it beneath you? Kids have always 
 worked in grocery stores and wouldn&apos;t it be up to the manager himself to 
 make sure that the kids act proper? Meetings weekly could help to drill 
 the kids mind to acting properly in the store. Your sanity is worth the 
 second part time job for you isn&apos;t it? 
How much are they paid and where else are some of these kids going to 
 work? Bealls? Coco&apos;s, PizzaWorks? Give them a break and let them 
 learn. The manager needs to be informed so why don&apos;t you write him a 
 letter telling him of the actions of his employees so that he is aware of 
 your insanity. (If that&apos;s your biggest complaint your lucky) Don&apos;t forget, 
 you can make the difference and be their example. Please don&apos;t shop at Target!  They support

 allow me to have my TV remote in one hand and beer in the other while you 
 perform I&apos;ll marry you. 
Does anyone know where in the Keys I can get Organic potting soil ? 
 I bought organic tomato seeds, but planted them in Winn-Dixie&apos;s potting 
 soil that has Miracle Gro plant food in it. (Chemical fertilizer) So, I 
 assume I am no longer growing organic tomatoes. I saw a web site showing 
 organic soil which is made from coconut pulp. It was out of Canada. There 
 must be a way I can get this in the Keys. I still have more to plant. If 
 you know, please type in a comment. Gravely bike path. It&apos;s not just the bike path 
 on Key Deer Blvd; the road is also terrible. Where does all of our tax 
 dollars go? There should be more than enough to do some road repair with 
 lots left over to line the pockets. Where&apos;s all of our tax dollar&apos;s going, oh yea on Key 
 West. Maybe it&apos;s time to 
 incorporate Big Pine once and for all. Re: Winn Dixie . Twice in the last week I stood 
 in line to purchase lotto tickets, only to find out that the lotto machine 
 was not working. If management would require the employees to put up a 
 sign in front of the lotto machine, it would save customer&apos;s time and 
 frustration. The first time I stood in line for 5 minutes before finding 
 out that the machine was broken. I was pissed! 
We&apos;re enjoying our first cold front of the year. I only wish that the 
 following fronts will be as mild as this one is. Flying squirrels . I hope before they are 
 released the owners of these squirrels do a little research on where they 
 should, and should not, be released. They definitely should not be 
 released in the Keys. All this talk about oral this, and oral that . Please keep in mind that,&quot;Those who give 
 head, Get ahead!&quot;  Re: Flying squirrels . They are just cute rats. 
 Please don&apos;t release them in the Keys. We don&apos;t need any more exotic 
 rodents. I don&apos;t think that the kind soul who is caring for them has ever 
 had their attic infested with squirrels. Think hard about what you&apos;re about 
 to do. Re: Gambling at Key Deer Bar and Grill and House 
 of Music . Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Fund raisers for 
 charities can be done in these places but they need to be done right. That&apos;s how all the other tournaments in the Keys manage to pull of their 
 events and award cash prizes. For one thing, they don&apos;t make it a regular 
 occurrence and they have non-profit tax status. 
 Okay, so 
 the buy-in was only $30. Would you donate $30 to any organization that 
 gave only 15% of the proceeds to an unnamed charity? What would you say 
 if the organization &quot;forgot&quot;to give 15% to the unnamed charity? That was 
 the excuse of of of these places. Local and federal officials made the 
 right call to stop illegal gambling before it grew into a bigger 
 problem. Lastly, the&quot;tip&quot;of illegal gambling came through&quot;Crimestoppers.&quot; Obviously one concerned citizen saw the activity as illegal and reported 
 it. If you see crime happening in Big Pine or anyplace else, call 
 Crimestoppers! They give rewards! I definitely agree with the fact that W/D is getting 
 better . The other day I was looking for something and the manager came 
 up to me and asked if he could help me. 13 years and that&apos;s a first. Go 
 Robert! Plus the whole store is starting to look cleaner. Synapses of events . I am tired of 
 hearing about the great cunnilingus from the 38 year old pro. Did anyone 
 use protection? Sorry to hear about the arrests in BPK concerning a card 
 game. The way they went about it, the MCSO or whomever was much too harsh 
 considering the circumstances. Also sorry to hear about the plight of 
 Rudy, however, he does have a gay hairstyle! No money in the world would 
 be able to overlook that. Sorry! 

What about flu shots ? Here it is October. What is going on? 
 A member 
 of the joint agency anti-gambling taskforce and Gestapo team spoke on 
 condition of anonymity saying they were very pleased that they were able 
 to clean out this sordid pit of corruption and debauchery. Asked if they 
 thought the big raid was theatrical overkill and unnecessary when there is 
 such an on-going problem with crack and other drugs they replied, Were not 
 aware of a problem with drugs since there is a pharmacy right here on Big 
 Pine Key. What is crack? I hope the cops 
 get the dark haired woman in the red PT Cruiser that flies down Key 
 Deer Blvd. all of the time. I have seen her several times and she has to be 
 going 45-50 mph. What an idiot. Doesn&apos;t the woman who wrote in about men 
 going down on her get the picture? It&apos;s 2005 honey! There are all kinds 
 of diseases out there. It&apos;s not like it used to be. If you got something 
 then, you just took some penicillin and it went away. Now you can die from 
 stuff. Anyway, what kind of woman with any self-respect would answer a 
 classified ad, go out with the guy (a total stranger) and blow him on the 
 same night? I certainly don&apos;t have anything against people meeting through 
 classifieds, and certainly enjoy oral sex, but you just sound like a stupid 
 whore to me. What&apos;s that you say? You think you&apos;re getting a cold sore? Want 
 to make a bet? Wonder what else he got from you besides the bj? Why don&apos;t 
 you just go and suck on the toilet seats at the bar while your at it? I said,&quot;more recently NJ&quot;Not! That Indian hut photo looks like it 
 could have been taken in the Gulf region. Re: Gambling and travel. Hello Capt. Dan, I hope this all turns out OK

Are they going to do the haunted house at Blue Heron Park this 
 year? Can anyone tell me how to get the schedule for the bus from Marathon to Key West? Does it run all day or 
 just in the early morning and late afternoon? (Business Directory&gt;Bus 
 Schedule.) G osh, I really 
 hope that the KKK comment was a joke. A very bad joke. Go ahead 
 and have a KKK rally and I&apos;ll get some use out of this deer rifle with a 
 high-powered scope and pick your ignorant red-neck a***s off. I have AOL on DSL , they don&apos;t conflict at all.
 (Tech support. They don&apos;t conflict, but why are you paying for two

The Big Pine House Of Music is having their first year 
 anniversary party Sunday, October 16th. The band Iko-Iko will 
 appear from 3pm to 7pm . There will be free hors-deuvres and lots 
 of fun. To the person who suggested we have a 50/50 charity raffle--That&apos;s 
 out! I&apos;m glad Publix isn&apos;t coming here . Now that W/D has 
 a new manager things are looking good. That whole Publix thing happened at a 
 time when W/D was being run into the ground. It&apos;s all better now. Is there anyone else waiting for bike path on Key Deer Blvd to be swept so we can roller blade and ride our bike&apos;s safely 
 again. If so call the direct line, the more that we bark hopefully 
 the quicker something will be done. It&apos;s a shame we have to ask for 
 everything here on Big Pine. Where&apos;s all of our tax dollar&apos;s going, oh yea

That wasnt the missing dog Lucky humping the waitress leg at House

 our bigpinekey.com fix. Hope you had a great vacation.   I just wanted to let you know that Big Pine 
 Liquors has been sold while you were gone (see, you did miss 
 lots of things). The good news is that I get to retire after 18 years -- 
 the other good news is that I sold the store to Big Pine Liquors long time

 A large riot broke out including buildings burned and looted. Guess what

Boot Key City Marina is the most polluted boat basin in the Keys south 
 of Key Largo. I wonder why? Isn&apos;t it funny that guys talk about women giving them oral pleasure all the time, but someone got upset when a few of us women 
 write in here that we like a guy who does it to us. I am one of the women 
 who wrote in about dating the guy from the classified ad and enjoying him 
 going down on me. Maybe I spoke out of school in announcing that he did that 
 but I needed to get it out of my system after a bitter divorce. If my 
 ex-husband did it even one time for every ten times I gave him oral our 
 bedroom life would have been a lot better. Suggestions for both the men and 
 women reading.
Guys, just think about it. Do you like being pleasured orally? So do us 
 women. What you give is what you get. Women, if he won&apos;t do it you should 
 refuse to do it. He&apos;ll change his ideas. If he doesn&apos;t, look up the guy in 
 the classifieds. I can assure you first hand, he will do it and do it very 
 well. Comcast really sucks going off at 6:59 
 tonight. 

Re: The bar advertised their illegal poker game ? How stupid is 
 that? How was it publicized by flyers, radio or just word of mouth?
 (Ed: By the link on the left for Key Deer Grill was one way. They didn&apos;t 
 think it was illegal.) Does anyone else out there feel like the service counter at Winn Dixie is being ran by day care drop outs? (at 
 night) I sure wish that they could get a few more mature folks to work 
 there. It&apos;s like shopping with Romper Room..
  There were two assistant Managers there

 (Ed: No. There were no mosquitos or sand flies. I was amazed. Some of

 could have been taken in the Gulf region, or more recently. Rio Dulce . The river pass and air plants, look like

Re: Boycott Target . Screw Target! Screw France! Many other stores 
 have the same products and prices. I&apos;m proud to be a veteran. Welcome back Ed! You aren&apos;t going to believe this, but 
 while you were away the citizens of Key West threw out their city council 
 and replaced them with conservative 
 Republicans , and Angus Bangus and Captain 
 Dan were both arrested for playing poker at different places at the 
 same time! (I told you that you wouldn&apos;t believe it!).

Hey Church Lady,  are these the End of Times days that the bible talks about? The Barometer online has a record of the police 
 report of the gambling bust on their Crime Report page. http://newsbarometer.com/ 

Welcome back .  We all missed you and the other nuts. 
 Wow!  House of Music 
 and Key Deer Bar and Grit busted for running an illegal gaming 
 establishment.  Looks like Big Pine finally made the big time. Whats 
 next?  Maybe the big, tough joint agency task force should raid the motel 
 for cutting off those tags from the mattress or maybe raid the Charter 
 School in case one of the kiddies has some spit wads. What a load of 
 crapola. Another example of our tax dollars wasted on some big time raid 
 that produced absolutely nothing in terms of crime prevention. A simple 
 cease and desist order with a court date would have been enough. But no, 
 these guys with the black masks have to charge in like a Gestapo unit to 
 roust a two-bit poker game that no one was trying to hide (and, in fact, was 
 openly advertised with a percentage going to charity). 

 I would be more 
 supportive of these agencies for busting a few of the local crack 
 houses/dealers that everyone but them seems to know about. And, to charge 
 the owners at the felony level is just plane overkill. Otherwise decent 
 business people who didnt try to hide anything and didnt think that their 
 little poker game was illegal may now have their lives ruined with felony 
 charges. This unnecessary raid could possibly causing them to lose their 
 businesses, their livelihood and possibly going through life as a convicted 
 felon. It is an obscene abuse of power by these so called law enforcement 
 agencies. Hopefully, a fair minded judge will see the ridiculous nature of 
 these charges and use discresion and common sense and reduce or dismiss the 
 charges.  

 As to the couple of people 
 who had illegal substances with them, let them take their punishment for 
 being stupid and in possession. 
 A pervasive stench 
 blanketed most of Big Pine, the Torch Keys and Ramrod Key for much of 
 Tuesday. Authorities originally thought that it was the result of rotting 
 sea grass washed ashore from Katrina and Rita. Upon further investigation 
 it was finally determined that the offensive methane like odor was actually 
 from a massive discharge of flatulent gas from the Bacon Grease Lady.   

This page lists but a few, but from this group of only 18 men came over 70 medals in honor of their valor.   Long winded tomes... Re: The recent bust of the charity poker tournaments.  What a crock. They could have told them to 
 stop months ago and they would have. Also what about the fishing 
 tournaments and golf tournaments that give really big cash prizes and have 
 their meetings and banquets at places that serve drinks. What&apos;s the 
 difference and why was this done so dramatically. Showboating by the 
 sheriffs. I was there and it was not funny. And the volunteers are the 
 ones that got screwed. Best Halloween costumes ever: 
 
 Funny Fridays is going on a hiatus as well. I am 
 getting married on Sunday and will be honeymooning in Hawaii for two weeks- 
 (from one island chain to another). Now, after an already excruciating 
 break, (no offense ed., I know you&apos;ve got to get away as well), I have to do 
 without Kudos&amp;Whiners for even longer! I think the new wife might get 
 irked if I check in on BPK K&amp;W from the hotel. I guess I&apos;ll have to catch up 
 on Nov. 2nd. Be good, folks!

 laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, That&apos;s 
 right, it&apos;s a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice . Then 
 everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of the 
 soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free

Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm 
 myself down. I&apos;ll go over to the person&apos;s house and ring the doorbell. When 
 the person comes to the door, I&apos;m gone, but you know what I&apos;ve left on the 
 porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in the side of its head with a 
 note that says&quot; You. &quot;After that I usually feel a lot better, and no 
 harm done. - Jack Handey

 Friday October 14, 2005 10:30am Please check back later for more updates until we can get caught up on all 
 the news and gossip. Gambling Ring Busted . Some jerk dropped 
 a dime on the House of Music and Key Deer Grill for having a small time 
 poker game. Big Deal. They&apos;re still looking for the Captain. He&apos;s on the

 Cramp :  Question: If you 
 could live forever, would you and why? Answer:&quot;I would not live forever, because 
 we should not live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, 
 then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would 
 not live forever,&quot; --Miss Alabama in the 1994 Miss USA contest.  Personal hurricane shelters . The recent 
 closing of the seven mile bridge further demonstrates that evacuation is not 
 the solution to hurricane preparedness. There are just too many bridges that 
 could be shut down in our time of need.

With the help from government in the form of tax credits, subsidies and 
 outright cash payments, homeowners should be able to build a small addition 
 to their houses that will withstand a category 5 storm. These small 
 additions can be built to blend in to your existing home and also will serve 
 as an extra room during peaceful times. In addition to person shelters all 
 new public construction should be built to withstand the same cat 5 storms.
For too long our county emergency services has only one mantra,&quot;Evacuate.&quot;That is not the answer. A personal shelter will enable us to stay at our 
 homes and business through all of the false alarms that we have every year. 
 It&apos;s just too costly to evacuate. They&apos;ll be no more worrying if your home&apos;s 
 all right and no more not being able to return to the Keys when you want to.

 week. Kickin&apos; Back sucks! Their food sucks, their prices 
 suck, and they don&apos;t honor locals cards. Speaking English is another 
 problem. I would 
 like to make a contribution to your column, first I would like to comment 
 on all this male testosterone flying about. 1. If you are wrong/right in 
 any belief or doctrine and you beat the shit out of any person who 
 disagrees with you, then, 2. You are still right/wrong. Secondly with 
 regards to the price of beer; would any bar owner who has a problem with 
 recalcitrant customers, please come to England and sell it at the price 
 indicated on this website.    Signed, the dry 
 and hopeful and overcharged for a pint, Englishman   Price of Beer ? Want cheap beer, go to 
 Japan, they recycle theirs! Requesting input from fellow Big Piners. Does anyone 
 want to start a Big Pine Key Chapter of The Ku Klux Klan ? This pass Sunday, a man shopping at W/D was bashing 
 President Bush. He could be heard half way thru the store; and I thought 
 to my self what a great country we live in. If he were in another country 
 he could have been put in jail or even beheaded for having an 
 opposite political opinion. 

Yes, the Square Grouper was sold , but nothing is going to change. 
 Same great menu. Same great staff. Just a different signature on there 
 paychecks! Use this link to tell me that Paradise 
 Petroleum is not gouging prices . I don&apos;t care what papers you have 
 to look at. Your diesel prices are over 20 cents higher than anyone else between Key West and downtown Miami. (Where I just traveled). Average 
 price for diesel in Miami was $3.02, and Paradise Petroleum is $3.68 how 
 is that? Price for diesel in Key Largo was $2.99 
 http://autos.msn.com/everyday/gasstations.aspx?zip=&amp;src=Netx I was joy 
 riding around the island of Big Pine Key and No Name Key. Something I 
 haven&apos;t done in a long time. I have to say you people make me ill. Has 
 anyone been at the end of No Name Key lately? Well let me tell you, people 
 are using it as a  dumping ground for all kinds of junk. I used to 
 love to go there and walk around to the waters edge. Now I&apos;m appalled to 
 see what&apos;s happened. Is there no shame in our society anymore? Is there no 
 pride anymore in your surroundings? I just want to cry. President Bush is the best president 
 the Military Industrial Organized Religion Complex, has ever had. Just 
 wait until He takes over as Emperor of the World. Dog 
 help us! It&apos;s great to see the smiley guy 
 from Ace Big Pine at Summerland Ace . He is a great fit there with all 
 of the other great people. 
 Fight of the Century . 
 The gossip hounds need to be objective or get glasses. Gossip Columns arent 
 supposed to be objective or factual or they would be entitled&quot;documentaries&quot;, correct? 

 I saw that night play 
 out. It boils down to jealously but no one can swallow that. All the 
 opponents of Krause were in a drunk run off for who is rich and who gets 
 the women. 22 Chocolate Martinis later it turned into a brawl. 

 Krause had Jamie outside 
 and told him he didnt want a fight. He tried to decelerate it for twenty 
 minutes out there. His opponents wanted a fight and wouldnt leave it alone 
 until it happened. Why the hair comment? 

 There was one of his 
 opponents who said, I am rich, I will pay all of the tabs. And he did, but 
 left $0 tips for the staff and decided to later show what was inside his 
 pants. Was that a tip for the staff or was that his intelligent persuasion 
 to get the blonde woman back from Rudy. You see, she had had it with the 
 opponents side and was hanging with Krause now. The 20 martinis didnt buy 
 him love. This added fuel to the fire. Those people want what Rudy has. I 
 say,&quot;go work for it&quot;, which pans out better than jealous rivalry. 

 If they worked as hard 
 as Krause did for 20 years they wouldnt have anything to prove because they 
 would have a name for themselves, money and women. He worked for it, they 
 were jealous. 

 By the way, did you call 
 it the Cow Palace because you enjoy cows? Its not a mandatory appearance 
 you know. 


What&apos;s up with the new campground by the hump bridge in Tropical 
 bay? That rental motor home has set up a nice little campsite. Kayaks, 
 bikes, picnic table,  boat and trailer. Who does this guy know? I really missed my bigpinekey.com . How looong does it 
 take to post a comment ? Things I have learned from watching the 
 news on TV during the last few days:
-The hurricane only hit black families&apos; property.
-New Orleans was devastated, and no other city was affected by the hurricane 
 .
-New Orleans has no white people.
-Mississippi is reported to have a tree blown down.
-The hurricane blew a limb off a tree in the yard of an Alabama resident.
-When you are hungry after a hurricane, and the power is off, steal a big 
 screen TV. (my favorite)
-The hurricane did 23 billion dollars in improvements to New Orleans. Now 
 the city is welfare, looters and gang free and they are in your city .
-White folks don&apos;t make good news stories.
-Don&apos;t give thanks to the thousands that came to help rescue you, instead 
 bitch because the government hasn&apos;t given you a debit card yet.
-Only black family members got separated in the hurricane rescue efforts .
-Ignore warnings to evacuate, and the white folks will come get you and give 
 you money for being stupid.

 Re: shorts coming out of washer inside out . Tip: Before you wash them turn 
 them inside out and when they come out of the washer they will be right side 
 out. Travel Corner We

 (Ed: I was east of all the destruction, Everyone, even the very poor, 
 were mustering a relief effort. It was real nice to see.

The only thing unsettling for me was all the people walking around with guns 
 on their hips like in the old west. And concealed weapons were evident under 
 many shirts. The Rio Dolce area is rather lawless. There was a mugging of a 
 backpacker the first night I arrived. And the owner of Brunos told me 
 that recently, an out of town gang tried to run a protection racket on the 
 merchants. Evidently, the major family that controls that area made the gang&quot;disappear.&quot;For every concealed weapon I saw, the wearer always has at 
 least three spare clips. it looked like they were ready for a long shoot 
 out. 
 Last year a gang robbed two banks in town right across the 
 street from one another. (I guess it was their version of 
 one-stop-shopping.) The bank guards were either paid off or just plain ran 
 away when confronted with all the firepower of the gang. 

 When 
 I went into one bank to get a $100 bill changed to Quetzals, the 
 bullet-proof-vest-wearing armed Wackenhut guard made me lock my camera in 
 one of the dozen lock boxes that were for guns that were provided outside of 
 the metal detector. The teller behind the bullet-proof glass told me that 
 they didn&apos;t carry that much money and to come back another day. I 
 went to another bank and snuck my camera in and after waiting on a 
 comfortable chair for a few minutes was sent through a vault into a tiny 
 room and when the door was locked behind me another vault door in front of 
 me opened and I was shown to a desk where a lot of paper work was filled out 
 and I was finally given the change I needed. The banks are the only nice 
 buildings I saw in the area.) Why Honduras ?
 (Ed: That&apos;s one way to get to Rio Dulce, Guatemala. It&apos;s also beautiful.) 
Dear Ed:  Been to Rio Dulce , Guatemala, had an itchy time. Had 
 Monty&apos;s for several weeks. Web Service is a large blanket and hash smoke. 
 Have fun. Wash a lot. 5:00pm Update What a great time for a gossip column to be off line! What did I count, 10 arrests, last night 
 at an Avenue A location? I am shocked, shocked!
 (Ed: I know! Wow. I&apos;ve faithfully edited this column every day for three 
 years. I leave Big Pine for a little vacation and the &apos;skeeter hits the 
 windshield. Damn! Those arrests. The fiery accident on the bridge, Mayor 
 Weekley&apos;s defeat, Judy&apos;s benefit, and our own gambling ring that was 
 advertised on this very website! Whew!&quot;Honey, don&apos;t unpack my bag, I&apos;m 
 going back.&quot;) Gambling Ring . As I understand it, they 
 got arrested because they were handing out cash money after the 
 charitable contribution was taken from the wagers and entry fee. And that 
 was the crime. Why can&apos;t they award merchandise and let the players redeem 
 the merchandise for cash? Welcome 
 Back Ed. There is a new band playing at The Big Pine House of Music. They 
 are Ralphus Balphus . The rumor is that Angus in Chains , 
 will be appearing this fall. (Psst...There is a man hiding under my futon 
 here in the Avenues. I cannot get a good look at him, but he looks like 
 Captain Dan, I&apos;d bet it&apos;s him anyway! Capt Dan better run! Now, this is getting just 
 plain out stupid! Who is hurt by a poker game? Who is really hurt smoking 
 a joint? Who gets hurt picking up a hooker? Its time to let our stupid-ass 
 politicians know we do not need baby sitters! We can pursue our own brand 
 of happiness without them. WebCam . The island seems to be listing a bit.
 (Ed: Thanks. It&apos;s better now. [all I have to do is remember to turn it 
 on.] All that rain filled up that side of the island, but we got it all 
 drained.) Looks like the House of Music should be 
 called the House of Ill Repute . 
 Commissioner 
 Murray Nelson honored by county GOP. 

 Monroe County 
 Commissioner Murray Nelson was recently recognized by local Republicans for 
 his service to Keys residents as a commissioner and former mayor dedicated 
 to increasing workforce housing and establishing a new government center, 
 public park and pedestrian bridge.
 Photo caption: Monroe County 
 Commissioner Murray Nelson, Key Largo, was honored by fellow Republicans at 
 their monthly executive board meeting. Joining Nelson are Carey Goodman, 
 County GOP Chair, Cudjoe Key, Greg Goebel, Republican State Committeeman, 
 Tavernier, and State Committeewoman Judy Greene, Key West. For those who use the bike path on Key Deer 
 Blvd. If your sick of the County never cleaning it; you&apos;ve got to call the 
 direct number is 295-5193. Pathetic we have to call, but you know we&apos;re 
 not Key West. Please call. Too bad for 
 Capt. Dan getting busted for gambling. Gee, that means every Firehouse, 
 Police Station, Tiki Bar, VFW, and private club also will be shut down. 
 How about the stinking Churches with their Bingo Games. They don&apos;t even 
 pay taxes. Dan should have stuck a couple of bent sticks over the door and 
 got a church license and called the place&quot; The Key Dearest Church of 
 Devine Gambling and Bar Sports Libationary&quot; , then the Righteous Rats 
 would have left him alone! Not to worry, I think the Captain is part 
 Injun&apos; !? You have a great web site. I used to live down 
 there and still enjoy reading about it. I was writing to ask if you would 
 send me or post the short term rental web sites again. These were 
 mentioned in you gossip column a month ago or so and now I can&apos;t find them. 
(Ed: Thanks for the kind words, but you&apos;ll have to look through the archives 
 to find them. We sorry not to have a search function. Do you want to 
 advertise? It&apos;s cheap.) Why no gossip column after Oct 6th? The Vietnam Veterans Association wrote.&quot;Recently we asked the local TARGET store to be a proud sponsor of the 
 Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall during our spring recognition event. We 
 received the following reply from the local TARGET management:

&apos;Veterans do not meet our area of giving. We only donate to the arts, social 
 action groups, gay&amp;lesbian causes, and education.&apos;&quot;

 So I&apos;m 
 thinking, if the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and veterans in general do 
 not meet their donation criteria, then something is really wrong at this 
 TARGET store. We were not asking for thousands of dollars, not even 
 hundreds, just a small sponsorship for a memorial remembrance. As a 
 follow-up, I E-mailed the TARGET U.S. corporate headquarters and their 
 response was the same. That&apos;s their national policy. Then I looked into the 
 company further. They will not allow the Marines to collect for &apos;Toys for 
 Tots&apos; at any of their stores. And during the recent Iraq deployment, they 
 would not allow families of employees who were called up for active duty to 
 continue their insurance coverage while they were on military service. Then 
 as I dig further, TARGET is a French-owned corporation. Now, I&apos;m thinking 
 again. If TARGET cannot support American Veterans, then why should my family 
 and I support their stores by spending our hard earned American dollars and 
 to have their profits sent to France. Without the American Vets, where would 
 France be today?&quot; Irate Biker. Why does nobody clear the 
 stones from in front of their property on the bike path? It is their stones 
 on our bike path. The stones in front of Breezeswept stumps are a danger! 
 These stones are your stones not our stones are you stoned or just to lazy? 
 Maybe you should get stoned and do it. Maybe we should stone you to do it. The computer 
 doctor has fixed my PC! I had picked up a virus last Friday that none of 
 my four security systems could fix. Norton anti-virus could identify, but 
 could not quarantine or access or repair. The virus was Trojan. Undo. New 
 version. It took the doc almost 2 hours (at $65.00/hr) but got rid of the 
 bad stuff and more. He also suggested I dump AOL and get another ISP so that 
 I can get DSL. He said AOL has too much junk files needed to operate, more 
 than MSN or any others. I&apos;ll have to think about that. But the machine is 
 fixed. The virus is gone and I&apos;m back on-line!  Re: Raid . Ed, it&apos;s a shame you are 
 gone. Law enforcement went way over the top on Monday the 10th when they 
 busted our poker games. If it was illegal a word to the owners of 
 H.O.M. and Key Deer would have sufficed. Instead they pull a raid and send 
 people to jail. Rick Roth F*** YOU. We were having fun on Monday nights 
 and giving money to charities at the same time. If this is the new America 
 count me out. You know, there just ain&apos;t 
 nothing finer than being a Big Piner !

 2005 Updated today at 9am, 2pm and 4:40pm ( Ed: I&apos;m Baaack ! I missed all you pine nuts, but I met a lot of other nutty 
 people too. This missive is just to let you know that they&apos;ll be a Kudos and 
 Whiners as soon as I can sort through the 2,023 spams and the hundreds of 
 legitimate submissions on my box. Whew! Please check back in a few hours if 
 you can for an update. I love Big Pine!) 2pm One Barrel of beer . 248 12oz. Glasses with a one inch head. That 
 doesn&apos;t include cooling, glassware, paper, glass, whatever, bar coasters, 
 (they&apos;re not free anymore) C02, insurance, workmen&apos;s compensation, garbage 
 pickup, help, A/C, over pouring, not to mention 14 or 16 oz beers. Work with 
 those numbers for a while. 
I love it! The voters really did what they said they would do. They threw 
 the bums out in Key West and replaced them with people who will stop the 
 corruption and deal making and serve the citizens instead. Yes, it was a 
 non-partisan election, but if you looked closer, the liberal Democrats are 
 on the way out and conservative Republicans are on the way in. Morgan 
 McPherson , you are the man! The liberal media are already in 
 disbelief, still giving more space to Weekley and Oosterhoudt than the 
 guys who replaced them. They can&apos;t believe what happened! It is a miracle. 
 The people have spoken. This little ole liberal, gay-loving, bum-loving, 
 conch train-loving, developer-loving town is going to see some big time 
 changes. I hope they catch that dildo that caused the seven 
 mile wreck . Karma will get him/her. The car with the&quot; ASSMAN&quot;plates was spotted 
 Friday outside the Cow Palace. He has definitely found a home. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802116043/ref=olp_product_details/103-2254548-9950218?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance  Ever since I read The Burial Brothers I&apos;ve dreamed of the

Enjoy your trip, I&apos;m jealous! ( Ed: Rio Dulce, Guatemala) Concertration test for women the concentration test for women ( muy bad) How is it that the women can write in about a guy 
 doing a great job going down on them and it is OK, but if a guy writes in 
 about a great head a woman gives him--he is a pig? Fair is fair, 
 if women can tell all about the guy who is good at sex why can&apos;t I 
 talk about the girl who CENSORED ? A few observations : The&quot;why help didn&apos;t 
 arrive&quot;picture was a scream. The body painting pictures were very clever. 
 The dog with the fish hook was terrible. I hope that wasn&apos;t real. And 
 finally...what ball? A friend 
 of mine did that&quot;kitty munch thing&quot;with a woman he met in a bar down 
 here. It took him six weeks and over $1,500 in medical costs to clear 
 up what he caught . I asked him if he ever do it again with a Key&apos;s 
 honey, he replied,&quot;None for me, thanks.&quot; Do they serve Key deer at the Key Deer Grill. If not, 
 why not? Do the math. The average American  keg of beer holds 15 1/2 gallons (128 ounces to the gallon=1,984 ounces). The average 
 beer cup holds 12 ounces (some only 10). Therefore, a keg will produce 
 between 165 - 194 cups of beer, provided no spillage or waste.  Has anyone been able to confirm if Square Grouper has 
 been sold? I hope it is just a Rumor. Someone stop Lucky from roving. Keep 
 your dogs in heat in the house. 

Definition of having a&quot; bad day &quot; I j ust want to let everyone know that most certainly was not me addressing the fight between Rudy and Jamie . It just 
 happened to come from my PC. I wasn&apos;t even there, I don&apos; even drink! Some 
 people out there have my email address and I don&apos;t want them to think it was 
 me saying this. My name is Carol, but I have nothing to do with that 
 comment, the #1, #2 and #3. It&apos;s too late to remove my address from this 
 site. My boyfriend sent that in and my name showed because the PC is 
 registered to me. I finally figured out how to send mail to you, that&apos;s why 
 I&apos;m doing this now. Sorry it took me so long. I just want to drop it. I got 
 a lot of hate mail. Ed, why didn&apos;t you print the address of the person whose 
 mail you had to heavily edit? Sorry to Rudy and Jamie. Thank you very much. 
 Now, you may print my address. 
 Does 
 anyone know what happened to the demand made by County Administrator Tom 
 Willi for overtime pay he was not entitled to? Suddenly the issue 
 dropped from the radar. Did County government and the good ol boy machine 
 cave in and pay him or was his request denied as it should have been? 


H ell, yea. The single women down here chain smoke; and they never buy there own weed! Tons of household chemicals that were once stored safely in garages, 
 bathrooms and kitchen cabinets along the Gulf Coast pose a potential 
 environmental threat after being scattered by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
 The storms destroyed or damaged some 160,000 homes and left an estimated 22 
 million tons of debris in their wake -- enough to cover 200 football fields 
 with a 50-foot pile. Alexander Hamilton on Judge Miers (well, not specifically Miers, but 
 you know), from Federalist No. 76:
&quot;[The President] would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward, for the 
 most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit 
 than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, 
 or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing 
 the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious 
 instruments of his pleasure.&quot; Guess what everybody? Billie is coming back. 
Someone asked if they make vitamin beer . The answer is that all 
 beer has vitamin P. Flying Squirrels . I hope we don&apos;t have these 
 critters on BPK. They may be small and cute, but they are the most 
 carnivorous of the squirrel family, according to a TV program I saw 3 days 
 ago. It said they even eat birds eggs and even baby birds. If we get 
 squirrels here, that will be the end of our already endangered Liguus tree 
 snails. They could be worse than the imported fire ant on our native 
 wildlife. 4:30pm Travel Editor: 


Dear Editor: Chicken bus. Wow, brave soul! When I think of buses in 
 Central America I remember&quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. Let us all hear 
 your stories when you can! Pics, please, too! Travel Ed : I took a bus from San Pedro Sula to Rio Dolce. I found out 
 latter that it usually is about a three and a half hour trip. After about 
 seven hours of beautiful sightseeing a Neanderthal sitting in the back moved 
 up and squeezed in next to me and was asking me way too many questions about 
 what kind of underwear I was wearing. To change the subject, I asked where 
 he was going and he said,&quot;Cobn.&quot;I said,&quot;Wow, aren&apos;t modern times great? 
 Here I am going west and you&apos;re going east and we&apos;re both on the same bus?&quot;After a short pause we both yelled to the driver,&quot;Alto! Alto!&quot;

The driver sort of apologized to me for not telling me that I should have 
 changed buses a long time ago. Then after about another hour while we were 
 driving at the top of a scary mountain ridge he stopped another bus that was 
 going in the opposite direction and put me on it. All the Guatemalans got a 
 big laugh out of it.
When we finally (I&apos;d had enough of sightseeing by now.) got to Morales, 
 where I was supposed to get off in the first place, all the busses were gone 
 for the day, so I had to pay for a ride in mini van. There were thirteen 
 people in that small thing. It was like how many people can you fit in a 
 phone booth kind of thing.

 

The sign read,&quot; Comida Rapido .&quot;  Fast food restaurant at 
 Morales, Guatemala
 
&quot;Brunos&quot;. It looks a lot worse than it is. The very noisy bridge is just 
 behind the trees.


I finally got to Rio Dolce and checked into a cool place called&quot;Brunos. 
 It&apos;s owned by a former Marathon resident (go figure) named Steve and 
 his sweet native wife. (I might note at this time that every adult that I 
 met there was slightly off kilter, so I stayed.

 

They serve very good beer and always put a napkin in the top. Usually in the 
 shape of a flower, but buy the time I took this picture neither the owner 
 nor myself could get the flower right. hic!

 


They don&apos;t have any bars per se  on the river. Everyone sits at 
 tables. It&apos;s very easy to sit at a table all day overlooking the marina and 
 the river. The place is loaded with live-aboard ex-pats. (An&quot;ex-pat&quot;is a 
 foreign national who doesn&apos;t live in his homeland any more.) There where 
 Americans, Brits, a lot of Australians, Danes, Hollanders, Swiss and 
 Germans. They all had time to stop and quench the ever present thirst and 
 swap lies with anyone. So, I was an immediate&quot;new best friend&quot;.

One guy said it all about the kind of ex-pat who lives on the river,&quot;Either 
 you&apos;re wanted or unwanted.

One morning I wanted a Bloody Mary and was wondering if the Indian girl 
 tending bar know how to make one. One toothless sailor yelled to me,&quot;Of 
 course she does. We may be third world, but we&apos;re civilized.&quot;

 I 
 got a fine room overlooking the river, but on the first night even my ear 
 plugs couldn&apos;t keep out the sound of the giant tractor trailer rigs backing 
 off the gas as the descended the bridge. They don&apos;t use mufflers, so when 
 they let their foot of the gas the backfiring sound the engine made was 
 deafening. The next night I slept like a lamb, but just before sunrise there 
 were three long sets of loud explosions sounding like machine gun fire. I 
 flew up in the air and thought I was going to have a stroke. It turned out 
 to be the traditional way people wake of their children on their kids&apos; 
 birthdays. Happy birthday, Pedro...rat-tat-tat-tat!

I stayed there for three days, ate like a pig, drank like an elephant, 
 bought a few rounds, had my laundry done and my whole bill was only $80.

 Tuesday October 4, 2005 Roving Reporter : Dateline: San Pedro Sula. I arrived 
 here three hours late due to airplane trouble and in such a large city I was 
 surprised that most everything was closed by 6pm. There was no where to eat. 
 American Airlines was supposed to serve dinner, but they didn&apos;t. So I 
 stepped over the sleeping people on the sidewalks and was forced to eat at 
 McDonalds, the only place opened. Instead of Ronald, they had a soldier with 
 a machine gun. I had a Big Mac and the grey mystery meat was so wafer thin 
 that I had to write about it. Seriously, I&apos;ve never seen meat to thin. I 
 stayed at the Honduran version of the Bates Motel, but I don&apos;t want to talk 
 about it. 
 
Has anyone noticed that almost all the single women down here chain 
 smoke ? What is that all about? Are they working on their wrinkles, or 
 do they just want to look like the Marlboro Man? Where&apos;s 
 the dock in Big Pine to pick up fresh seafood from McBuck Seafood .

 search of R.K.? Inquiring minds want to know. 
 To the Beer Price Guru : Im not sure where youre buying or pouring your beer, 
 but your numbers are somewhat off. Consider this. A bar can expect 275+ 
 servings of beer to a keg if theyre not wasting a lot dumping foam and 
 spilling. They pay about $60 for that keg (more or less depending upon 
 quantity ordered, not including all of their overhead). Dividing $60 by 275 
 glasses we get $0.21. (Twenty one cents/cup) Not 5 or 7 cents. (math 
 approximate) And, most of the local watering holes have a happy hour and 
 serve draft beer for $1.00 to $1.50. You havent been screwed in the bar 
 until you buy the dentally challenged, fat blond with the tattoo on her neck 
 down at the end of the bar a few brewskies and a shooter.  Then youll get 
 screwed for sure! 
I&apos;m going to be there for 4 days starting tomorrow. I have references.

 The guy 
 with the ASSMAN license plate heard about the Bacon Grease girl and, being a medical professional, decided to examine the phenomena. Unfortunately he neglected to use proper safety equipment including proper 
 lighting, air supply and tethers to the surface and has not been seen 
 since. Bacon Grease lady has now been fed massive quantities of frijoles 
 refritos in an attempt to effect discharge of the examiner. Authorities

 How do they nominate someone whose greatest 
 claim to fame is being White House counsel and President of the Dallas Bar 
 Association to the Supreme Court  My God, it never ceases to amaze

 person whose claim is a failed oil company and part-time affiliate of a 
 baseball team. The more I read on this site and hear around the 
 community about the positive improvements at Key Deer I have to 
 take my hat off and bow my head to Captain Dan. I was one of the biggest

 As the Pine Cone Turns) Lucky is the Moondog&apos;s drummer, but I don&apos;t 
 think he has been reported missing; he just wanders around a lot.  The&quot;man&quot;who&quot;walked out&quot;of Rob&apos;s to go 
 to the Key Deer was far from the&quot;main man&quot;there. Rob&apos;s kitchen managers 
 still work there because they do not push around or threaten teenage

 A Keys environmental group has called for a federal investigation into the Seven Mile Bridge accident . They claim that the fire from the 
 burning tanker has dramatically escalated global warning, and leaking 
 fuel has contaminated the water below. Leaders of the group have called 
 for the Bush administration to completely drain the Atlantic Ocean and the 
 Gulf of Mexico and filter the water for any contaminants. Costs of the 
 mammoth project will be borne by Monroe County taxpayers. Ed,  enjoy your vacation . You 
 deserve it. I hope you can post from Central America. Please share

 are clenched firmly in his butt-crack...he tried to smile but it seemed as

 proud to be driving around with them Re: Supreme Court Justice . I am still 
 just so astonished how cheapened everything is that comes out of this White

 What qualifies her for the bench? Bush ticked off a long 
 ling of professional and civic accomplishments, and he said that he knows 
 her&quot;heart.&quot;But Miers&apos; single most important qualification -- at least in 
 the president&apos;s eyes -- may be her loyalty to him.

 by this author ) born in Asheville, North Carolina (1900). He 
 spent many years trying to become a playwright, then had an affair with an 
 older, married woman named Aline Bernstein. She became his muse and 
 convinced him to write a novel. He dedicated his novel Look Homeward 
 Angel to her.
Thomas Wolfe died young, of meningitis, and left behind a crate full of 
 notebooks and manuscripts. His editor went through the crate and created two 
 novels out of the material there, The Web and the Rock and You

Ouch! Now those wimps the French are fishing with dogs. Who was the 
 genius that wanted to save them from the Nazi&apos;s? Now if Rudy Krause wrote that 
 yesterday, there&apos;s two things that he sucks at. He can&apos;t spell or make a 
 statement make sense, and also he can&apos;t fight. No one jumped in, it was one 
 on one until the owners of Boondocks held the man fighting Rudy back so he 
 could get a cheap shot. But then he&apos;s friend saw that and it was all over 
 for Rudy. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a lot of people that will meet you one on one any 
 day of the week, Rudy, so don&apos;t act tough now after you just got beat down. 
 I guess now you realize you don&apos;t run the Key&apos;s and it doesn&apos;t matter how 
 much money you got. You can always still get a good ass whipping.

 W ow, 
 could you please tell me where a bar owner can purchase tap beer for $.05. I 
 pay $.37 per 12 oz. draft. sell it for $1.50 for a 12 oz mug. Except from 4 
 - 7 which is happy hour. Then it&apos;s $1.00 . You get an ice cold mug, a 
 smile, and a thank you. Do some research before you make comments like that. 
 I don&apos;t see any of the Big Pine bars rolling in the bucks, but they all take 
 good care of their customers. It&apos;s a tough, but interesting business. Oh, 
 bye the way, the .37 is the cost of the product only , not the $1000 a 
 month insurance, the $2200 a month elec. and so on. That&apos;s my story.

 Monday October 3, 2005 Notice: (Ed: 
 This spring we took this show on the road to New England without any 
 difficulties. So latter today we&apos;ll be taking it to Central America and hope 
 we can publish successfully. If you see that this site has not been updated

 and Liability Insurance for our home in the Keys.&quot;Why&quot;, I asked the 
 agent,&quot;do we need it when a category 4 or greater storm hits, there won&apos;t 
 be any land left, let alone homes.&quot;She said,&quot;it&apos;s because you have to 
 have it for the mortgage.&quot;I replied,&quot;Oh, I forgot about the kick-back

 I heard 
 that the main man in the kitchen at Robs walked out and went to Key Deer 
 Grill.  Knowing him to be an excellent cook I stopped into Key Deer this 
 weekend and had prime rib. The food was good and they actually had a nice 
 crowd to go along with the entertainment. Maybe Key Deer really is turning 
 around.  Hold your present course Capt. Dan.

 just another rumor? It is the only decent place we have to eat in The 
 Lower Keys. I hope it isn&apos;t true. I could not believe it, but it&apos;s true. I just saw a 
 car with New York plates on it that said &quot;ASSMAN&quot;. This guy is

 what you speak of. Where&apos;d you get that price of 5-7 cents cost to pour a 
 draft? The fact is that as of Monday, for bars and restaurants in Monroe 
 Co. , domestic draught beer costs about 3.3 cents per ounce. If you do 
 the math that&apos;s almost 40 cents per 12 oz domestic draught beer. Bottled 
 domestic is going up to 6 cents per oz, or 71 cents per bottle. What a 
 deal! 
 The Square Grouper sold? Can anyone verify this as fact rather than rumor? If its true I sincerely hope that the new ownership has a solid background 
 in restaurant management and they dont screw up what has become a very good 
 thing. Too often new owners run a successful operation into the ground. It 
 would be a shame to ruin one of the best restaurants outside of Key West. All you losers are on here talking about Rudy 
 Krause like you were there an saw what happened. So get the story 
 right. All you people that wanted to jump him, like your tough, won&apos;t come 
 see me one-on-one anywhere; because you&apos;re soft you&apos;ve got to jump 
 to win a fight.
 (Ed: heavily edited. I think I made some sense of it. It was a

 the vet&apos;s again Friday and asked one of the techs to get a picture of the

 feeding and thought she got another of the whole group. They have 5 flyers 
 in there now and they&apos;re nearly as big as they&apos;re going to get. Unfortunately, she&apos;s not real familiar with the hesitations of a digicam and 
 didn&apos;t get the group shot, but this one came out ok. I will try again next 
 week. I&apos;m a snowbird. If you want I&apos;ll bring down some cheap 
 smokes and my Jersey girlfriend. I hope she&apos;s not the same one you&apos;ve 
 been chasing in your dreams. Smoke on bud. 
 To the 
 person writing about the Wooden Man at Boondocks: Before you call 
 anyone a moron you might want to check your spelling and facts. The word 
 you wanted was their not there. Their indicates possession or 
 ownership as in it was their caveman, there is a place or position, as 
 in put it over there.  And who the hell is Ed Wintermyer. If youre 
 talking about the former owner of Mo-Bay and the Packers dragonfly his name 
 is not Wintermyer.  Moron indeed! Serious nap time 
 
 Ed Wintermyer. Isn&apos;t he bricks?(?) Do you all remember 
 when the ATM was stolen from Boondocks? You want to say they did 
 that too? Better get an attorney if you keep blaming people for doing 
 things if you can&apos;t prove it! I live in the Houston area , I get the Houston 
 tv channels and radio stations. I haven&apos;t personally worked with any of 
 the Katrina or Rita evacuees, but I have spoken with many different 
 people, unconnected with each other in any way, who have dealt with them 
 in many different areas. I have never seen or heard, on broadcasts or in 
 person, of any ingratitude or rudeness displayed by any of them. I&apos;ve 
 always been told how grateful they are for every kindness shown them. Most want only a place to live and a way to earn their living. 
 The worst 
 incidents I&apos;ve heard have been foolish use of the FEMA or Red Cross debit 
 cards handed out; tattoos, expensive jewelry or perfume, big nights out at 
 fancy clubs.  One person has been arrested for buying a gun and 
 dealing. Some of that is bound to happen, but it is a very small 
 minority. Those mentalities have never had anything and don&apos;t know how to 
 handle a windfall. Unfortunately when the rescuers were picking up people 
 they couldn&apos;t tell on the spot which ones they should shove right back in 
 the water. They&apos;ll be back in the cycle of poverty in no time. 
The vast majority of reports are of people using the money to get a car to 
 look for a job, or clothes to interview for a job, or gas for their 
 vehicle to look for housing and work. If there were all these incidents 
 of abusive bad behavior, don&apos;t you think the news reporters would have a 
 heyday filling every broadcast with them? It isn&apos;t happening. The most 
 you see is someone yelling their frustration at bureaucratic delays. Well, who among us hasn&apos;t had their fill of bureaucratic delays at one 
 time or another and wouldn&apos;t we have loved to had a reporter right there 
 to listen to us blow off steam! Even those incidents are few and they 
 don&apos;t turn into anything else. Most of these people seem to have patience 
 with the system. 
These are just people going through a bad patch. There are people helping 
 them and there are a lot of&quot;thank yous&quot;being spoken for every little 
 thing they do. Don&apos;t make them out to be criminals or worse. It isn&apos;t 
 fair and it isn&apos;t true. Just 
 to let you know we have some pretty nice Sunsets in the Valley of the Sun. 
 (Picture is not the best, done with camera phone from front yard). Sadly, still not the Keys, which I still miss a bunch, even if its not the same as 
 when I came for a vacation and stayed for 25+ years. With all this talk of hooking up and oral 
 favors its obvious that Craven Moorehead is back in town! That missing dog lucky, isn&apos;t he the drummer for Moondogs ? I spent the afternoon at Bahia Honda park the 
 other day and there was a gunfight on the beach! I found nothing about it 
 in the local papers. A bunch of girls drew their weapons and fired at each 
 other, point blank! Some of us just hung around and watched. All in all, 
 it was just some good clean fun. (Ed: We can&apos;t print your picture of a 
 bunch of beautiful naked women with water pistols, but out male staff sure 
 liked it.) More puppies. This must be puppy day in Big Pine 
 Key. We could all use a bit of puppy love.
 
 I&apos;m not bashing Kickin&apos; Back (the convenience store 
 on Cudjoe across from Blimp Road). I just wanted to check my sincere 
 perception that there has been an obvious decline in both maintenance and 
 customer service/friendliness since it&apos;s been under new management. (The 
 answer so far is no on both counts, apparently.) My son and I are in there 
 several times a week, and we used to feel welcome, and recognized as 
 neighbors. Now all we get is blank stares, no greeting, no,&quot;Can I help you, 
 how are you today&quot;, or,&quot;Thank you.&quot;More often than not the person at the 
 counter is on his cell phone and doesn&apos;t speak to the customer at all, not 
 even to give you the total on your purchase. He just expects you to read it 
 off the register. I really wouldn&apos;t have a problem with not being able to 
 easily understand the cashier if he would smile, make eye contact, and at 
 least try to communicate in a courteous way. That just hasn&apos;t been my 
 experience.
Other small, but unfriendly changes: The alarm beeping on the door every 
 time it opens (where do they think they are, L.A.?), a minimum of $5.00 on 
 debit card purchases (I just ran out to buy milk and gave my last three 
 bucks to my son for lunch money), even the bowl of 25 cent candy on the 
 counter was a nice touch. The lot just looks unkempt, too. And what happened 
 to Johnnie&apos;s car wash? At any rate, as these things started to add up I 
 thought I&apos;d check and see if anyone else had been getting the same cold 
 vibe. That&apos;s why I asked. TYPEWRITER is the longest word that can be made using the letters only on one row of 
 the keyboard. 
 Re: The Kickin Back store being run into the ground? What, youre surprised? With Akmed and Abdullah running the joint what do you expect? The only 
 things they lack are turbans and a couple of camels. How pathetic is it that these women have to 
 have sex with a total stranger to make them feel good about 
 themselves? And he likes to eat kitty, big deal. What did you give him? Ever 
 hear of STD&apos;s or AIDS? Go buy a vibrator. Has Montana snatched anything interesting 
 lately? Inquiring minds want to know.(?) I thought 
 dates (and time in general) were not of great importance when living on&quot;island time&quot;. Isn&apos;t that one of the perks of living on an island? Suggestion; if the info is new, it&apos;s the next day&apos;s news. Avoid 
 controversy, drop the date entirely. Also drop the 10 am deadline and let 
 Ed sleep in when the urge strikes! (Even I cringe at that suggestion 
 because I do look forward to the next edition!) Just tack on new stuff in 
 an endless&quot;stream of consciousness&quot;rambling so nobody can pinpoint 
 beginnings and ends.  End of date complaints .

(Ed: I changed yesterday&apos;s date to the correct one. I goofed. Since I moved 
 here I haven&apos;t been very good with time.) 
In 2000 Clinton left Bush one of the biggest 
 surpluses in history . Since bush hasn&apos;t vetoed even one spending bill we 
 are in debt up to our ears. His spending is up 33% just this year; and the 
 interest we have to pay on all the money he borrows (from China and Japan) 
 will be $385 Billion this year ! And all this is without Katrina or 
 Rita added in. He should be ashamed of what he&apos;s done to this country. We&apos;re 
 in fiscal crisis and what does Bush do? He cut&apos;s $1.4 Trillion in taxes. I&apos;d 
 rather have sex in the White house than an irresponsible President ruining 
 my country. 
Re: B eer 
 prices go up. Wow! Since it 
 costs 5 to 7 cents to pour a 12 oz double plastic glass of beer in the 
 average bar, and the average price for a draft beer is $2.00, I think the 
 bars should be made to hang a Red Light out front, since we&apos;re getting 
 screwed anyway!   False: &quot;Katrina 
 evacuees verbally abused volunteers and trashed a rest stop in Waskom, TX.&quot;There have been a rash of false&quot;letters&quot;on the internet from the disasters

 read on the internet--you&apos;re a fool. Including our own site.) 
 The Bacon Grease girl turned up at a local watering hole with a group of 
 Jerseyites and was looking for&quot;a good time.&quot; One of the local guys told 
 her to, Haul your big butt outta here. She had to make five trips! 

House Of Music will be having Bike Night, Tuesdays starting this week. Safe bike parking will be provided in the amphitheater

 I saw what went down with Rudy Krause and Jamie 
 O&apos;Brien . The fact is Rudy got pissed because Jamie made a comment 
 about his Dumb and Dumber hair cut . Jamie tried to apologize twice after Rudy&apos;s attempt to fight him, after the third attempt Rudy 
 got worked! What can I say three strikes and your knocked out! It was 
 just another bar fight and you gossip hounds should leave it as such.
-Tyronenoe@aol.com Forget I even said one thing about a cooler! I got a new one already. 
 I did not expect such rude remarks about a simple thing. I hope the guy 
 finds his canvas he lost. And by the way, I am not the same guy who wrote a 
 personal ad. Just a citizen, that is all. 

Now that the Square Grouper sold and has new owners will it be as 
 good now? To whomever wanted to get up with or see the Bacon Grease 
 woman shake her butt. Think again. Her arms are not not near long enough 
 to reach around and wipe herself. So, if she shakes that thing, something 
 could fling out into the viewer&apos;s face. No telling how long it&apos;s been since 
 she could wipe between those lard globes. A few interesting facts about Rudi 
 Krause&apos;s fight . 1. It was only him and one other man fighting. The 
 second man one was trying to break it up. 2. The people who worked at the 
 cow palace broke it up alright; then let Rudy take a free swing at the one 
 he was fighting (that&apos;s low). 3. The police asked the two men if they 
 wanted to press charges and the one Rudy was fighting said&quot;No, it was 
 just a bar fight.&quot;And, of course, Rudy said,&quot;Yes. I would.&quot;Guess

 Once upon a time, a guy asked a girl,&quot;Will you marry me?&quot;The girl said,&quot;No.&quot; And the guy lived happily ever after and went fishing, hunting, 
 played golf a lot, and drank beer and farted whenever he wanted to.  The 
 end. I am the second woman who wrote in about answering the&quot;Let&apos;s Hook Up&quot;personal ad. I saw some idiot wrote in accusing the guy who placed the ad of 
 writing in saying he is a woman who answered the ad. I saw that my friend, a 
 female, who also answered the ad and enjoyed this gentleman&apos;s company called 
 the idiot doing the accusing a donkey. I am not sure what word fits you 
 better, idiot or donkey.
 Maybe if an 
 idiotic donkey like yourself paid more attention to your girl&apos;s needs and 
 pleasured her a little more often she wouldn&apos;t have to search out personal 
 ads to have good sex. Guys, here&apos;s a couple of hints to better sex. 1. We 
 women need to have an orgasm too. 2. You think women don&apos;t like giving you 
 oral favors, we do like it, but we also like to receive the same favors. Any 
 women who have been missing out on those two things I highly recommend you 
 answer the personal ad too. You won&apos;t be missing them anymore. You&apos;ll get 
 both and get both good. Just so the donkey-idiot won&apos;t accuse me of being 
 the guy who placed the personal ad, my email address is DeeDeesails@hotmail.com No. Kickin Back has always been 
 dirty. Their new problem is that you can&apos;t understand their cashier. If 
 they were a McDonalds, this would not be a problem. Just sharing an e-mail I received the other day. Maybe we 
 need to start looking for solutions to the world&apos;s problems instead 
 of just complaining about them.
 (Ed: The email link was no good.) Hey Ed. September was bad enough what with the 
 hurricanes. Two Friday the 30th are way too much. Let&apos;s move on to other 
 less depressing things - like Saturday, October 1! (Ed: Ok, Ok, I get the

 been more than courteous since they took over and are I think doing a great 
 job. They stayed open during the storms this summer and I don&apos;t think it is 
 fair to bash them. Snowbirds eat yellow snow! Where is Kickin Back ? I never heard of it? To the 
 morons that own Boondocks, I can&apos;t believe you are giving all this attention 
 to your stupid ugly freak wooden man you had kidnapped outside your 
 bar. Are you sure you didnt copy the old article out of the Barometer newspaper about the time when somebody stole there dragon fly and held it 
 for ransom? Maybe you and Ed Wintermyer were talking. Get over it and grow 
 up. You know you have it. Ed, what&apos;s with the date ? By now you 
 should know this is a failing and check it every day.

Tragic news -- beer prices go up on Monday, October 3. The beer 
 companies/distributors raise their prices every October and this year is 
 no exception. So stock up this weekend. 
 Re: Free 
 flood insurance . 
 What a surprise. They (the Government) may reimburse those in the Gulf 
 without flood insurance. Why not? The poor downtrodden already get free 
 medical, food stamps (that they sell on the BLACK market for 20 cents on the 
 dollar), Aid For Dependant Children, WIC payments, welfare checks, 
 unemployment insurance payments, free transportation and whatever they can 
 get for the merchandise they looted from various businesses. Free 
 insurance. Why not? What&apos;s the scoop on Rudy getting beat up? Inquiring minds want to know? The Catholic&apos;s, 
 in their new guidelines, are now asking their new candidates for priesthood 
 if there is&quot;any evidence of homosexuality in the seminary?&quot;They estimate 
 that 23 to 58 percent of Catholic clerics have homosexual orientations. The 
 new guidelines don&apos;t say anything about pedophilia--which is the problem 
 they won&apos;t talk about.
The Vatican is expected to issue a document 
 clarifying its attitudes towards gays. In this document they use doublespeak 
 that further confuses the problem such as: All homosexual acts are&quot;intrinsically disordered&quot;and homosexual orientation is an&quot;objective 
 disorder&quot;...&quot;moral relativism&quot;and a bunch of other gobbledygook. Do you think this is one of our locals? Hic! http://www.bestwebatlanta.com/humor/humor_dui_stop_of_champion_dancer.shtml To the person in love with the Bacon Grease Girl: I 
 think she probably hangs out everywhere ! I heard Rudy Krause got beat 
 down because he stood up for himself, after someone said he had&quot;gay&quot;hair. That&apos;s a little funny, because he still lost. 
 Heres a message to all of you who think 
 that the wild chicken population is so cute we should honor them 
 with protection and a festival.  

 The 
 World Health Organization said today that 2 to more than 7 million people 
 could die from a global flu pandemic. Other authorities put the dead at 
 10+ million. The avian flu is spread by chickens, ducks and other wild 
 birds and has been a problem in Asia for years where people live in close 
 proximity to wild chickens. It has now spread to Europe. Strains of the 
 virus are now turning up in humans and there is growing concern in the 
 U.S. about the possibility of a pandemic. Experts cannot predict when a 
 pandemic would strike but many say conditions are ripe. Health experts 
 warn that the avian flu threat must be taken seriously because the flu is 
 one of the most infectious agents to humans and readily transmitted 
 person-to-person. There is no natural immunity in the human population 
 and no effective vaccine. 

 Key West and the Keys is a tourist 
 destination bringing visitors from around the world by ship, plane and car 
 daily. An infected person could easily bring the disease here. Sure they 
 make good hot wings, B-B-Q and soup but in the wild theyre just filthy 
 creatures. So, my bleeding heart chicken lovers, lets protect and honor 
 the fowl (a more appropriate spelling would be foul).  Its such a 
 pleasure to wade through chicken crap on the streets, parking lots and 
 yards. That bacon grease , giant butt girl would blend 
 right into the Friday night crowd at the Cow Palace. I would love to see 
 her&quot;shake that thing&quot;. Keep that Nineteenth 
 Nervous Breakdown storm out of here or I will have a breakdown! Looks 
 like Fantasy Fest is getting close. By now, nothing should be a surprise, 
 especially for those of us were there from the first one!!   Rudy got beat up? False police report. This girl is sooo tired of flipping through 
 the Barometer and reading about Ugg, Boondock&apos;s mascot. I happen to 
 know that its all BS! That the owners are the ones who have it; and this 
 is all a phony publicity stunt. They even went to the extent of making a 
 police report, which by the way is a felony offence. They need to get 
 their s**t together and actually make the place nice to go to; Serve some 
 better food and maybe they won&apos;t have to make false police reports to get 
 the attention they want. Ok, I am a little confused is the guy with the personal ad who is 
 allegedly such a great roll in the sack, the same guy who lost the white 
 cooler? W hich Rudy got beat up? Young or old? Inquiring minds want to know! Found: 
 Very friendly Black&amp;white cat with a red collar&amp;bells. In the 
 vicinity of Division, Hibiscus Ln and Coconut Hwy--Palm Villa sub. If this 
 cat is yours please call Katie 872-0324 I am the woman who wrote in about the personal ad that some donkey 
 accused of being the guy who posted the ad answering himself. I wrote in 
 twice and the other woman who wrote in and also saw him is a friend of mine 
 now and is all female too.

My message to the person who accused the ad&apos;s submitter of answering his own 
 ad is: Maybe if all guys were as attentive to women in the bedroom as he 
 was, women like me wouldn&apos;t have to answer personal ads. If guys want to get 
 pleasure they should also be willing to give pleasure too. (and he was). It 
 is a pretty simple concept to understand. Girls have needs as well. Ed, if 
 you want to print my email address I have no problem with it. I have nothing 
 to hide and am not ashamed that I also have needs. At the risk of making this website a&quot; lost and found &quot;forum, after reading about the person who lost their cooler, I thought I 
 might as well ask about my loss and see if maybe the person who found my 
 item is looking for me.
 A couple of 
 months ago, while tailoring my boat from Big Pine to Cudjoe, the green 
 canvas cover on the captains chair blew off along with a roll of paper 
 towels that were on the floor of the boat. I believe both items blew off in 
 the vicinity of Fishcutter&apos;s because when I got to the ramp and discovered 
 the cover missing, I retraced my route and found the roll of paper towels in 
 front of Fishcutters, but no sign of the seat cover.

The only reason I&apos;m asking if anyone found my cover is that I&apos;ve 
 discovered that it&apos;s a lot harder item to replace than a cooler. The boat 
 manufacturer won&apos;t sell a replacement, none of the boat stores, marinas or 
 two canvas companies that I called carry boat seat covers. The best I could 
 do is a too-small canvas cover from West Marine.

So, if anyone out there found a green canvas captain&apos;s chair cover, would 
 you please post back? Re: White Cooler . I guess I should have expected such a response. I 
 just thought that MAYBE some one would be KIND enough to return something 
 they found, and would have the common sense to think someone lost it. Yes, 
 it was empty, the fact that it was used to keep food in for the volunteers 
 that goes on these disaster relief trips would make someone do a good deed. 
 I was wrong. I just find it hard to understand that it only took 10 minutes 
 for someone to take it. I hope you put it to good use. It was a gift from 
 someone to us to help with disaster relief. Maybe you don&apos;t care about such 
 things. Yes, I am going to buy another one, hope whoever took it enjoys it 
 and puts it to good use.  Let&apos;s bring 
 back the Church Lady on a regular basis. God knows, we need her 
 here in Big Pine. She could give a weekly commentary on our problems and 
 tribulations, such as Captain Dan&apos;s Packers truck and the heifers over at 
 Boondocks. I prefer Church Lady to either Father Tony and his altar dog or 
 the Vineyard rock and roll band. Maybe she could start her own church 
 Sunday mornings at the House of Music. Angus Bangus could be the house 
 choir. You&apos;ve got to love it. Isn&apos;t that just special? For those Big Pine men who are just as confused as I am when women speak , 
 here are some vocabulary words my married friends have taught me:
--Fine: This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right 
 and
you need to shut up.
--Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour. Five 
 minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to 
 watch the game before helping around the house.
--Nothing: This is the calm before the storm. This means&quot;something&quot;and you 
 should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with&quot;nothing&quot;usually end in&quot;fine&quot;.
--Leave Me Alone: Do not be confused by this one, it means you better try 
 and find out what is wrong with me and not take&quot;nothing&quot;as an answer.
--Go Ahead: This is a dare, not permission, DON&apos;T DO IT!
--Loud Sigh: Although not actually a word, the loud sigh is often 
 misunderstood by men. A&quot;Loud Sigh&quot;means she thinks you are an idiot and 
 wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over&quot;Nothing&quot;.
--That&apos;s Okay: This is one of the most dangerous statements that woman can 
 make to a man.&quot;That&apos;s Okay&quot;means that she wants to think long and hard 
 before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.
--Thanks: This is the least used of all words in the female vocabulary. If a 
 woman is thanking you. Do not question it, just say you&apos;re welcome and back 
 out of the room slowly. 

A new Florida law makes it easier for gun owners to defend themselves . 
 The British tabloids are warning that when visiting Florida, don&apos;t piss 
 off the locals because they can legally shoot you. Are the snowbirds aware 
 of this new law? Should they be afraid? The guys that assaulted Rudy Krause :

 What would have 
 happened if there was a nuclear incident in Texas or any other major 
 American city and people weren&apos;t willing to wait in a one hundred mile 
 traffic jam? There would be anarchy. With a hurricane people weren&apos;t in a 
 panic they were just very anxious. In a nuclear or biological emergency 
 there would be no time to wait and civilized people would become animals in 
 a very short amount of time. This is what Homeland Security should be 
 planning for. Is the guy who wrote the personal ad the one who answered it and then 
 lost his cooler and went out with the bacon grease girl? Please let me know. Re: Cooler . I can&apos;t believe someone cares about a lost cooler. New Orleans Police Racal quota at it&apos;s best. The NAACP must be proud. AOL News - Police Probe Whether Officers Looted 




If you are going to try cross-country skiing , start with a small 
 country (?)Is anyone else disappointed in the way that Kickin&apos; Back 
 is being run into the ground since it changed hands?
