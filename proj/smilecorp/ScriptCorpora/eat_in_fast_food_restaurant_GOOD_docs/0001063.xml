The plot was considered sophomoric even for a purported children&apos;s movie, compounding the fact that there were several &quot;disguises&quot; that would clearly not be recognized by youngsters (Tony Montana from Scarface, for example). In addition, there were many indications that the film was rushed; for example, there are scenes hinted at in the trailers that do not appear in the actual movie. Also, the cinematography and special effects are...,

 Feb 11, 2001 
Down to Earth is a film starring Chris Rock and is about a comedian, Lance (Rock), who is killed before his time. He is given another chance in the body of a rich man.

He has big dreams to land a gig in the final amateur night at the Apollo Theater, but his plans are cut short when a semi truck hits him and kills him. Lance is brought up to Heaven where he meets...,

 Human Nature 
 2000

In the power struggle that ensues, an unusual love triangle emerges exposing the perversities of the human heart and the idiosyncrasies of the civilized mind. Human Nature is a comical examination of the trappings of desire in a world where both nature and culture are idealized.Several shots in Human Nature recreate scenes from the Björk music...,
