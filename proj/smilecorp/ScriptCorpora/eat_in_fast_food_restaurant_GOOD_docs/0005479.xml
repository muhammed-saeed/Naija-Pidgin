Good Customer Service Causes a Write Up

This is Why Customer Service and Good Samaritans Are Scarce

 More: 911 Remembered Discrimination Fast Food Restaurants Good Samaritans 
 Flag Close Today I ran into one of the employees at a Fast Food restaurant that I frequent during my lunch break. The man behind the counter was not his usual cheerful self, and in fact he looked quite stressed. I made my order and asked him how his day had gone as it appeared he had a far harder day than I had.
&quot;I am quite upset and hurt today. I go out of my way to do my job, sure its fast food, but I like to think that folks actually get customer service. I was on my fifteen minute break the other day and it was really icy outside so I helped an elderly gentleman to his car. I asked first if he would like the help, I didn&apos;t grab a hold of him and start dragging him.&quot;

I had remembered commenting to myself that I was so glad to still see customer service and people that cared about people. I hadn&apos;t seen that kind of kindness even in smaller towns for many years. I made the comment to the man that I had remembered and I had thought it was a wonderful gesture.

&quot;Exactly, and I got praised for doing such a fine job of customer service.&quot; He said.

I had worked at a fast food restaurant and receiving praise for any well job done was like moving a mountain. The man farther explained to me that when he had asked the same of another couple on the same day, however, he had a complaint filed against him. &quot;Corporate came down on me like a pile of bricks, I had tried to help white people that were terrified to touch a black man.&quot;

My mouth hung open and I must admit I am white, but I hate discrimination in all terms so badly that it is my focus. I plan on working until my fingers fall off to ensure that discrimination is a thing of the past, and that discrimination does not come in the color of our skin, there are other reasons and problems.

For this wonderful worker and wonderful customer service at a fast food restaurant to be praised and encouraged to help elderly to their cars in icy conditions and then wrote up for the same thing that he was praised upon was discrimination. Then he finished his story and told me that he had helped one couple that lived in the apartments in his same complex to their door during the time that conditions were so icy that one could barely walk outside. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to see those fine folks hurt.&quot;

A good deed causes one to be punished. This isn&apos;t something new, just as seen in a simple movie such as The Incredibles, teaches children that saving people could cause them to sue you in the end. I asked one of my sons why they held the door open for ladies, my boys are eight and ten. Chivalry is not dead in their eyes. Their answer was, &quot;To be kind.&quot; I thought of the good boy scout image, where the boy scout helps people cross the street. It doesn&apos;t exist anymore. My oldest son had complained, &quot;I tried to help an old lady across the street, mom, she yelled at me.&quot;

As we look at some of the every day life functions we see where maybe we could help someone, but we don&apos;t because we are worried that we will offend them, end up in jail because they feel threatened or scared. I had been worried that good Samaritans would be a thing of the past because of lawsuits and misunderstandings, but some people still make sure they do good deeds.

This afternoon, I talked to a few people and I asked them what they would do in the scenario that they had come across a woman that had been badly injured and was bleeding, laid unconscious along the side of the sidewalk in some bushes. With my scenario that I had placed there were a shocking amount of people out of five men and five women, the five men said they would call 911 and make sure they did not touch her body at all. I asked them to why they would not touch her to make sure that this woman was ok, their answers were all the same. &quot;To make sure that I wouldn&apos;t be a suspect,&quot; The women&apos;s answer was shocking as well and many of them said, &quot;I would be terrified that the man or person that did the crime would get me next.&quot;

It&apos;s a dog eat world out there and we have wondered why customer service no longer exists? It looks like not only will customer service no longer exist, but so will good Samaritans.
