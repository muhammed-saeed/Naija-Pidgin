&quot;Pho&quot; could be considered the Vietnam&apos;s answer to Japan&apos;s ramen. The main difference is that Pho tends to be healthier than ramen. Pho can be considered a meal in itself while ramen could be considered a snack or treat. But, Pho does share something with Ramen. Both types of soups do have influences from China. In Pho&apos;s case, there is the influence from France as well.
 



However, there are plenty of health concerns with Ramen. The soup itself is packed with sodium. Overall, a bowl of ramen tends to be less healthy than a meal at a fast food restaurant such as McDonald&apos;s or Burger King . The noodles are very much high in carbohydrates. Too many carbohydrates equal too much sugar. When the sugar is not used up, it turns into fat.
The soup for ramen is used made from chicken, pork, or beef stock.




Unlike Ramen, Pho is usually served in a large bowl. One large helping of Pho could make up a person&apos;s lunch or dinner. Then again, it could take about two or three bowls of Pho to satisfy someone&apos;s appetite.




In regards to Pho, it is served with rice noodles. The broth itself is usually clear but has the color from simmering bones, charred onion, and spices. With that aside, there main question asked is: How does one eat Pho? You eat Pho the way you eat any other type of soup.
However, there are two sets of utensils to use when eating a hearty bowl of Pho. The utensils consist of a Chinese soup spoon and a pair of chopsticks.
The chopsticks would be used to pick up the noodles and the toppings. The spoon would be used for the broth.




That is how one usually eats Pho. However, eating it alone can be boring. Like Ramen, Pho does have its ingredients and toppings. Though, the ingredients are a bit different. You can eat Pho with steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, meatballs, chicken breast, chicken organs, and so forth.




For the beef, it is served raw. The reason being is that the meat is finely sliced thin. When the broth is ready, it will be nice and hot. You simply add the thin slices of beef and they will automatically be cooked. That way, it is to avoid the overcooking of the beef. On top of that, the thin slices of beef will be easier to pick up with the chopsticks. However, the meat can also be picked up with the special spoon.




If you do not want beef strips, there are always other toppings for your Pho.




If you do not like meat, you can have vegetables in place. Pho is garnished with vegetables such as green onions, white onions, cilantro, Thai basil, Thai
