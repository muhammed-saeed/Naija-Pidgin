Why I am Choosing Blindness:
Personal Reflections on the Need for a Functional Definition

by Scott Feldman

Reprinted from the February, 1997, issue of the Braille Monitor, the monthly
publication of the National Federation of the Blind.

From the Braille Monitor Editor

BARBARA PIERCE:

One of the most annoying misconceptions about the philosophy of the National Federation
of the Blind is the notion that committed Federationists are proud of their blindness and,
if given a chance, would choose it over returned vision. Those who have heard and believed
such statements are enraged, I think, because they consider it needlessly cruel to
encourage the development of neurotic and twisted ideas in people who are already facing
vision loss. Federationists, on the other hand, are frustrated when we are accused of
holding such notions because, in fact, we don&apos;t.

Learning to be unapologetic and to resist feelings of inferiority because of blindness
is very different from being proud of the characteristic. It is as absurd to be proud of
blindness as it is to take pride in being six feet four, having size five feet, or
demonstrating an IQ of 145. One may be comfortable or not with any of these
characteristics, but one can certainly claim no credit for possessing them.

A person might well take pride in developing his or her artistic ability, athletic
skill, intellectual powers, or expertise in the alternative skills of blindness, but that
is very different from claiming personal credit for a God-given characteristic. Of course,
being only human (and therefore often a little ridiculous), people frequently take pride
in their naturally wavy hair, quick reflexes, or green eyes. It isn&apos;t surprising, then,
that, in the process of evolving a healthy identity as a competent blind person, some of
us act for a while as though taking pride in blindness were the goal rather than achieving
self-confidence and effectiveness as a blind person.

Debunking the second half of the misconception is more complex. I don&apos;t think I know a
single blind person who would actually choose blindness above fully functioning sight, if
the exchange were an actual option. In a world structured for and largely dependent on
sight, it is obviously more efficient to use sight to get things done. But such a choice
is virtually never an option. Most people with a little residual vision are faced with the
dilemma of either depending on very restricted visual data for doing tasks or mastering
alternative techniques for getting the job done. The pragmatic question these people face
in situation after situation is which strategy would be more efficient. The emotional
freight that such decisions carry can be heavy indeed. If one has never learned effective
alternative techniques and if one has always depended on vision, then visioneven
very poor or painful visionoften seems the easier choice. Family and friends
reinforce this tendency every time they urge the person not to&quot;act blind&quot;because, after all, he or she can still see something.

Recognizing these pressures, experienced members of the Federation understand the
importance of encouraging those with vision problems to get to know able blind people who
are comfortable using the alternative skills of blindness. It isn&apos;t that we prefer
blindness; we just prefer efficiency, confidence, comfort, and success. For almost
everyone with less than 10 percent of normal vision, this means using some combination of
blindness skills and remaining, genuinely usable vision. Working out the combination is
time-consuming and often emotionally demanding. One man who has given this struggle a lot
of thought in the past few months is Scott Feldman, a graduate student in clinical
psychology and a member of the Chicago Chapter. This is what he has to say about his
journey into self-understanding:

&quot;But that&apos;s not youyou&apos;re only print-impaired.&quot;It was my best friend
Amy speaking, and she was clearly concerned about me. Until recently I suppose that I
thought of myself in this way as well. My visual problems first manifested themselves
after extended periods of reading, and reading print was the first activity that I
eventually had to relinquish, in my early twenties. Even today, several years later, I
could force myself to read a small amount of print in an emergency, but I would pay the
price with accommodative spasms. When I try to see things at near distance, my eyes lock,
as in a muscle cramp, and later double vision and a throbbing headache set in as my eyes
struggle to relax. I do not like pain, nor do I like setting myself up for failure. Since
1990 I have listened to my books instead, and I write with a speech-adapted computer.

Last year I began to learn Braille because in many situations speech is an inadequate
substitute for print, such as when I have to give a lecture or presentation from notes.
Braille is coming slowly, and materials in any accessible format are hard to come by. Only
five percent of printed material published each year is converted to speech or Braille. So
I most certainly do feel print-impaired.

This might have been the end of the story, except for one, well two little problems. To
begin with, there are many other things besides print that can get too close for my
comfort: people&apos;s faces, a kitchen counter or dining room table, or a Rembrandt, to name a
few. I suppose that you could say that I am face-impaired, food-impaired, and art-impaired
as well. Better, let&apos;s say that I am functionally blind at near distance and leave it at
that. This is where I was several months ago, after much kicking and screamingnot to
mention a year-long depression that nearly sapped my will to live.

Life is not fair, nor is it simple. At present I get around without the assistance of a
cane or dog. Walking outside is one of the activities recommended to me by my visual
therapists because it allows me to gaze into the distance and relax my focusing system. (A
world-renowned neuro-ophthalmologist who first diagnosed my condition as severe
accommodative and convergence insufficiency suggested that I become a forest ranger. When
I said that I wanted to be a scholar, he asked me if I would mind if he prayed for me. I
did not.)

If you are sighted, you may be aware of relaxing your eyes, particularly when you are
walking along, lost in thought. Your eyes do not fixate on anything in particular but take
in the general environment. You perceive gross forms, color, and most definitely movement.
You do not crash into things. This is how I have gotten around for the past six years. It
works, except for the fact that I cannot make out street signs or other such niceties of
modern travel. To be precise, if I squint through the various overlapping images, I can
sometimes make out street signs, but then I get back into that same painful cycle that I
described earlier.

So traveling is the second little problem. I was not aware of it while in Los Angeles
for graduate school, where my range of independent travel was effectively limited by my
busy campus schedule and inability to drive. Nor was it a problem when I returned to
Chicago on a leave of absence since I know the city very well, having spent the latter
part of my childhood and my adolescence there.

But this past October I traveled with my family to London and Paris. It was a lovely
trip, especially because of the English theater. During a side trip to Stratford on Avon,
I scalped a ticket to the Royal Shakespeare Company&apos;s performance of Macbeth. I sat next
to a delightful old woman who had been coming to Stratford for decades. She recalled the
glorious days when the likes of Richard Burton were members of the company. The lights
went out, and we fell silent, expectant. At the end of the performance, she asked me
whether I had enjoyed it, not being able to make out the individual actors. As it turned
out, I had enjoyed the performance more than she because I had been able to focus on the
poetry, while she had difficulty getting beyond her aggravation at the inauthenticity of
the costumes and stage set. (At one point, to her horror, the gate keeper lit a
cigarette.)

It was walking around on my own in London that made me realize how compromised my
ability to navigate new places visually has become. The first day I went out I squinted at
the street signs painted on the sides of buildings to make out where I was. I did not
enjoy the theater that evening or the following afternoon because my eyes reminded me, in
no uncertain terms, that I had mistreated them. A couple of days later I wanted to venture
north to visit the Folk Institute because I am very fond of Irish music. My parents said
that it would be no trouble to go with me, but I felt that it was important to figure out
how to travel there independently. The influence of the National Federation of the Blind
was in full evidence here. With the help of an excellent mapand my parents&apos;
eyesI familiarized myself with the general layout of central London and with the
specific route I planned to take. Then I set off for the Kensington underground station,
our local base of operations. To make a long story short, after a few wrong turns and
requests for directions from a couple of polite Londoners (they are so polite), I found
the place. Happily, I returned to the subway with four new CD&apos;s in hand, the result of a
thoughtful introduction to the institute&apos;s collection by another extremely polite
Londoner.

My travels the following few days were much the same. Instead of asking my eyes what
street I was on, I asked someone more reliable. As you might suspect, this strategy failed
miserably after we took the newly constructed tunnel under the English Channel to Paris.
Being a native English-speaker and a sometimes Spanish-speaker, I couldn&apos;t even begin to
formulate the appropriate question, let alone understand the response. To the extent that
I walked around on my own, such as when my parents indulged in a visit to a museum, I
traced large circles around prominent landmarks.

As I sit here in my new apartment in Minneapolis, staring out into an impossibly early
snowfall, the little question of how to navigate an unfamiliar city blossoms into a
preoccupation. Besides the question of how to map out the city, pinpointing the places
that hold special interest for me (such as a folk music club or dim-sum restaurant), I
wonder how I will shop for necessities. Twice now my refrigerator has gone empty before I
asked a neighbor with whom I am acquainted for assistance shopping. Of course, I could
walk into the grocery store and ask for customer service, but I am not blind, right?

Actually, Amy, I suspect that you and I are wrong. It is true that I do not meet legal
criteria for blindness, which are based on simple indices of acuity and field of vision. I
am not a low-vision candidateI have plenty of it. It just doesn&apos;t seem to be working
for me.

True, many people have strong negative stereotypes about blind people, into which they
will try to lock me if I identify myself as blind in public by using a long white cane,
for example. They will see me only as a blind person. But I have seen much more in many of
the people I have met through the National Federation of the Blind. When I am in their
company, rather than feeling ashamed of who I have become, I feel empowered to work to
create a more positive image of blindness. I am starting here.

I&apos;m Partially Sighted, and I Use a White Cane

by Peggy Chong

Editor&apos;s Note: Peggy Chong was, for many years, the president of the Minneapolis local
chapter of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB). She and her husband, Curtis Chong
(who is totally blind), recently moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where Mr. Chong is employed
at the NFB headquarters as Director of Technology.

As a very young child, I was aware that I did not see as well as the other kids in the
neighborhood. It was well known that the family down the block was made up of a mother and
several of her children who could not see too good. Congenital cataracts run in my family.

While I was growing up it was stressed that I should try to fit in, to be like everyone
else. What I was being told was to&quot;look sighted.&quot;A graphic example of this was
in church. We were always told to sing along using the song book, even though my sisters
and I could not read it. If I would try to read it by putting the book up to my face, a
hand would come over and move the book down to the sighted reading distance. So, I
pretended to read the song book, to be sighted.

In my teens I knew that this was not going to work if I wanted to get ahead in life and
be happy. I had met blind adults who were working, buying their own homes, and raising
families. I wanted to have the same happiness I saw in their lives.

A counselor from the state agency for the blind recommended shylyand outside of
my Mother&apos;s earshotthat I get a folding cane just for identification purposes. She
did not get me one or tell me how to use a cane, so the topic was just dropped.

In my late teens I bought a cane and started carrying it to places I did not know my
way around. One of my sisters was about three at this time, and she asked my Mother,&quot;Why does Peggy have a cane?&quot;My Mother&apos;s reply was loud and meant for me to
overhear.&quot;She is pretending to be blind.&quot;

That hurt a lot. My Mother was blind. In fact, she had less vision than I did at the
time. But she did not want to be blind or have any one think that she might have
difficulty seeing. She always traveled on my Dad&apos;s arm. Mom would not go shopping without
a sighted person. This was not what I wanted for myself. But her comment hurt so much that
it was very difficult for me to take my cane from the corner where I parked it when I got
home.

For the next ten years or more I would only take my cane when I was traveling alone, or
to a place I did not know well, or where I was sure no one would see me who might tell my
folks.

When I used my cane, people treated me better. They did not get mad when I asked them
to show me where something was in a store. Bus drivers were friendlier when I asked what
number route that bus was. I felt less frustrated after trips I made with my cane. But
because I am a&quot;high partial,&quot;there was this little voice inside of me that
echoed my Mother&apos;s words:&quot;You&apos;re just pretending to be blind.&quot;

I started to do some soul searching. Why did I resist taking my cane shopping when I
knew it would be helpful? Sales clerks did not follow me around like I was going to steal
the place when they saw me looking closely at things. I could get clerks or other
customers to read the packages for me if I was carrying my cane. There was no need for
lengthy explanations when trying to get a person behind the counter to read me what was on
the menu that hung right behind them in a fast food restaurant.

I also took a look at what others might be thinking when they saw my cane. It became
obvious to me that there were many conflicting emotions about blindness tied into the
symbol of the cane. I found it fascinating to discover that the most negative feelings
were held by blind people who did not use a cane, like my Mother and sisters. The blind
people that did use a cane felt good about their cane. They felt good about themselves.
But most importantly, they were the blind people out there doing something with their
lives! They were the happy, successful blind people.

Then in 1992 I decided it was time to get some real training as a blind person. I went
nine months at an NFB training center where I had classes in computers, Braille, and of
course, cane travel.

After graduating from BLIND Inc., I wondered how people would treat me now that I had
decided that I was going to use a white cane all the time when I went out. My daughter,
who had just gotten into her teens, said that it was&quot;weird&quot;to see me with a
cane all the time. But it didn&apos;t seem to make that much difference to her for very long.
Now she finds my white cane helpful. Now, when she meets me at a restaurant or large room
somewhere, to save time she just walks in and asks if there is a blind lady in there.

My blind friends thought the cane was great and gave me lots of encouragement. Most of
my sighted friends took it with a grain of salt. The only sticky point left was my family.

My one sighted sister and her family got used to the idea in no time. I talked to her
children about why I used a cane, and it was accepted with only a few questions.

The rest of the family were different. Some of my aunts did not understand. They felt
that my Mother had gone this long without using a cane, surely I could go without one,
too. They were embarrassed.

I have three other sisters who are also legally blind. They are uncomfortable around my
cane as though it will give them some incurable disease. But when my cane can benefit
them, well, that is another story.

We all attended a cousin&apos;s wedding a few years back. The wedding was held in an old
church with long, narrow, and dark halls and many stairs. As I got there before many of my
family, I was toward the front of the church, and they were near the back. As we all do at
weddings, I stopped a minute or two to talk to relatives I hadn&apos;t seen in a while. When I
got to the back of the church, at the top of the stairs, there were my sisters. I stopped
and looked at them for a minute; there was a lengthy pause. I asked what we were waiting
for. One of my sisters replied,&quot;Well you got the cane. You go first.&quot;

My Mother was diagnosed with cancer not long after that. If she saw the cane she aways
found a way to make some comment about me trying to focus people&apos;s sympathy on myself. I
didn&apos;t need any more emotional upheaval in my life at that time and thought she didn&apos;t
either, so I did not use my long, straight cane when I visited her. I took a folding cane
and put it in my purse.

That is when I noticed just how much I had gotten to depend on the cane. Over the years
my eyes have become more sensitive to light. Many times I will close my eyes when I walk
outside in the bright light. It was difficult to walk with my eyes closed when my cane was
parked in the car. I walked slower without my cane. Stairs made me nervous. During this
time I carried a folding cane to avoid hurting my Mother. I also became convinced that a
straight cane was a much better way to travel. Folding canes FOLD! Usually right in the
middle of a six lane intersection, or when I am carrying many things and truly need it to
find everything in my path. Now that I&apos;m back to using a straight cane, a folding cane is
still in my purse or suitcase just in case my straight cane breaks or if I am traveling on
an airplane. But that is about all the use I have for a folding cane.

Mom&apos;s doctors all knew I was blind. I found that they gave me more thorough information
than they gave my sisters. I have often wanted to ask the doctors why that was. My Mother
was in denial of her cancer. Did the doctors assume that Mom&apos;s denial of her cancer was
related to the denial of her blindness? Did they assume that my sisters, who are also
blind but try to hide their blindness, also would not want to deal with Mom&apos;s cancer? When
I went to the doctor appointments or to the hospital, I found the doctors and nurses eager
to talk to someone in the family about her condition, test results, their suggestions, and
recommendations. The rest of the family reported that no one talked to them. Looking back,
I believe that my cane told the medical professionals that I could deal with life&apos;s
frustrations successfully and move on.

Since it has been over five years now that I have used my cane almost everywhere, my
family knows it is not a&quot;phase.&quot;I know my cane still makes some people
uncomfortable. But this is my life. I need to feel good about myself in order to lead a
happy life. If, once in a while, someone is uncomfortable around my cane I figure they
will either get used to it, or they are probably not going to be very important in my life
for very long, anyway. My cane is here to stay.

I&apos;m Albino, Legally Blind, and a Meteorologist

by Sam Herron

Reprinted from Insight a publication of the National Federation of the Blind of South
Dakota.

My name is Sam Herron. I work as a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Rapid City, and I am legally blind. Before I tell you about my current job, I&apos;ll give some
background information. My eye condition is the result of albinism, specifically
oculocutaneous albinism. This is a genetic condition in which the body is unable to
produce the usual amounts of melanin, or pigmentation. Albinism is typically linked to
fair skin, very light hair, and poor vision. Due to the lack of pigmentation, the eyes do
not develop normally before birth and during infancy. My vision is stable around 20/200
with glasses and I am very light sensitive. I also have a condition called Nystagmus,
which is irregular eye movement.

While growing up I attended public school and used large type books when available.
However, I was not happy dragging around the large books, and the pictures in the large
print versions were not very good. Most of the time I used a magnifying glass to read
books and papers. I would sit close to the board, but often had to borrow a classmate&apos;s
notes or ask for the teacher&apos;s notes. I became a very good listener and was forced to
memorize a lot of information to keep up with classroom activities.

When I was in 6th grade we studied weather. I knew at that time that I wanted to become
a meteorologist. I had always loved weather as a childthe sound of a thunderstorm,
the feeling of the wind, and even the simple beauty of a sunny day. I enjoyed using maps
and making measurements.

After high school, I attended the University of North Carolina at Ashville. I continued
to use regular texts with a magnifying glass. I graduated with a Bachelor&apos;s Degree in
meteorology in the spring of 1993 and was immediately hired with the National Weather
Service. After a few moves around the country, I came to Rapid City late in 1995.

My job is visually demanding. As a weather observer, I have had to observe cloud types,
precipitation, and other elements; read various instruments, and use a computer to enter
these reports. When reading instruments I am able to use a magnifying glass. Most computer
programs that we use have some flexibility in the size and colors for display. This is
important, because I spend about 90 percent of my work time in front of a computer!

I spend a lot of time collecting and processing data. We receive reports from many
volunteer observers around western South Dakota and northeast Wyoming. I quality control
these observations to ensure correct data and formats of the reports. Also, I monitor
automated observing stations around the area, such as the Rapid City airport station, to
make sure that the sensors are reporting properly.

A fun way in which we gather data is with weather balloons released twice each day.
After preparing a battery-powered instrument which is about the size of a shoe box, I
attach it to a large hydrogen-filled balloon and release it outside our office. The
balloon is about 4 feet wide and 6 feet tall. As the balloon goes up through the
atmosphere, reports of pressure, temperature, and humidity are relayed back to our
computer. After the release, I quality control the data and make sure that the information
is distributed. The data goes to Washington, D.C., where powerful super computers generate
forecast information.

Another big part of the job is analyzing maps and computer output to make forecasts.
Regardless of what may be heard from some television personalities, we all use the same
computer information, and our performance is very much based on the performance of the
computer predictions. Differences in forecasts can occur due to the various levels of
forecaster experience and knowledge.

The main mission of the National Weather Service is to issue warnings of severe or
life-threatening weather conditions. Severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings are often
issued based on radar information. We often record severe events and then study them
afterwards, so that we can better recognize the types of storms that produce severe
weather. The radar displays that we use are very detailed. However, computer technology
allows zooming in on areas of interest and use of high contrast colors to assist with
interpretation.

My work involves some direct contact with people. I have given talks about weather
safety, such as what to do during a thunderstorm. Also, I enjoy providing weather
information for people with travel plans or to those who just want a more detailed
explanation about weather conditions.

I have not requested or felt the need for major modifications in my office. I do ask
for simple things like having computers set up so that I can sit close to the screens
comfortably. I also request the cooperation of co-workers to have the lighting set to
proper levels. I benefit from my ability to work well with others and ask for help when
needed. I believe that my ability to memorize and having enthusiasm for what I do have
been the biggest factors in my success and satisfaction with my job as a meteorologist.

Normal Visual Development

by Lisa C. Verderber, MD

Pediatric Ophthalmologist

Reprinted from VIPS News, 12/6, Nov./Dec. 1996, a publication of Visually Impaired
Preschool Services, Louisville, Kentucky.

Editor&apos;s Note: Dr. Verderber is with Mahl and Associates Eye Care Center in Louisville.
She completed her fellowship in pediatric ophthalmology at the Children&apos;s National Medical
Center in Washington, DC. Her residency in ophthalmology was done at Northwestern
University.

At birth vision is quite poor. A normal baby can see only large objects moving in front
of his face. This poor vision is due mainly to immature visual centers in the brain. These
visual centers mature as the eye is stimulated with visual input. During the first three
months of life there is a very rapid improvement in vision. These first few months are so
important that they are known as the critical period of visual development. The
development of good vision is dependent on well-focused images during this time. If there
is an abnormality in the eye that precludes this focused image, these important visual
centers in the brain will not develop. This is why it is so important to recognize
correctable conditions that interfere with vision in this early period.

Addressing vision problems early may prevent a lifetime of poor vision. Some of these
difficult problems can be corrected. For example, a congenital cataract can be removed. A
severe corneal problem can generally be treated early in life. Unfortunately, all
conditions that cause decreased vision are not reversible. Structural problems in the
optic nerve, for example, can not generally be remedied. The optic nerve consists of over
a million axons which extend from the retina to the visual centers in the brain. At the
present time we do not have the technology to repair most problems associated with the
optic nerve. Though some retinal problems such as retinal detachments may be treated,
there are many conditions of the retina that cannot be treated. Severe structural problems
such as these will result in permanent visual impairment. The degree of impairment depends
on the degree of abnormality.

The visual system in children continues to be flexible throughout the first eight years
of life. During these first eight years amblyopia can develop. Amblyopia is a decrease in
vision caused by abnormal visual stimulation. Therefore, anything that interferes with a
clear retinal image in the first eight years of life may lead to decreased vision. The
earlier in life that the stimulation is abnormal, the greater the visual deficit. This
helps explain why visual problems in children can be more devastating than a similar
problem in an adult. A congenital cataract may lead to a lifetime of decreased vision if
it is not removed within the first few weeks. A cataract that develops in an adult does
not lead to permanent visual impairment. Since the visual system in an adult is mature,
good vision will return when the cataract is removed, even if it has been present for
years. As another example, a child who is extremely farsighted but does not receive
glasses in the first eight years will have a permanent decrease in vision, even if the
glasses are prescribed later in life. An adult who develops far-sightedness will have
blurry vision without his glasses, but no permanent visual impairmentgood vision
will return when he puts on his glasses. This stresses the importance of screening for and
correcting visual problems in children as soon as possible.

Vision Stimulation: Is the Tide Turning?

by Julie Hunter

Editor&apos;s Note: The following editorial first appeared in the January, 1997, POBC News
and Views, a publication of the Parents of Blind Children Division of Colorado. It was
later reprinted in the June, 1997, issue of the Braille Monitor, the monthly publication
of the National Federation of the Blind.

For many years the professionals in the field of visual impairment have held that
visual skills could be taughtthat children with impaired vision could be trained
through focusing and tracking activities to use better any residual vision they might
have. For just as many years the National Federation of the Blind has argued against this
philosophy, believing that the time spent trying to stimulate the use of vision through
therapy involving darkened rooms and flashing lights is better spent enriching the child
and guiding him in the use of alternative techniques in visually based activities. But
more than just a waste of time, the NFB has suggested that underlying such programs is an
insidious implication that the better you see, the more valuable you are as a person. In a
1986 article from Future Reflections, (Vol. 5 No. 2, 1986; page 25) entitled,&quot;Learning to Look,&quot;Barbara Cheadle wrote:

&quot;Putting aside for the time the question of how valuable vision stimulation
programs are (or could be) for the blind or low-vision child, there is a greater concern.
Like drugs or a common kitchen knife, even useful educational tools can be turned into
dangerous weapons that destroy instead of nurture.&quot;

Meanwhile, as recently as 1995, the National Association for

the Parents of the Visually Impaired presented an article entitled,&quot;Sensory
Development, Vision, Focusing&amp;Tracking.&quot;The article stated:

&quot;Using his/her vision is a learned activity for the child who is visually
impaired. It is not automatic, so you must teach your child that using his/her vision will
be beneficial to him/her. For example, instead of handing your child a cookie, you should
hold the cookie and ask the child to reach out and take it. That way, he/she is being
rewarded for using his/her vision.&quot;(Awareness, Winter Issues, 1995, page 6)

What does such an approach teach the child? The child is

rewarded for seeing the cookie and made to feel inadequate for failing to see it. The
child is set up for failure and diminished self-esteem. Instead of valuing and
appreciating the usefulness of alternative techniques, the child is being taught that it
is better to do your best with whatever vision you have and hide your inability to see
than to use an alternative technique of blindness.

We all agree that enriching the environment with color and shape is extremely important
for a visually impaired child (as it is for any child), but enriching the environment and
trying to teach visual skills are very different matters. It is dangerous to try to teach
vision, for you have then placed a value on seeing versus not seeing which can have
damaging psychological implications.

Happily, there is evidence that the vision professionals may be reevaluating their
stand on the value of visual stimulation. A recent article published in the Journal of
Visual Impairment and Blindness (Vol. 90, No. 5, Sept-Oct, 1996) entitled&quot;A Call to
End Vision Stimulation Training&quot;by Kay Ferrell, Ph.D. and D. William Muir, M.A.,
questions the efficacy of teaching visual perceptual skills.

&quot;The cautions against using vision stimulation are significant. The main ones are
1) the research to support visual skills training is ambiguous at best; 2) the procedures
violate the principle of normalization and diminish the self-esteem of children, families,
and teachers; and 3) the training consumes time better devoted to instruction for
real-life demands.&quot;

Ferrell and Muir also say:

&quot;Children may think that they are not good enough and that visual impairment is
indeed a loss, rather than a learning characteristic requiring adaptation.&quot;

Dr. Ferrell and Mr. Muir are highly respected professors in

the Division of Special Education at the University of Northern Colorado. However, it
may take some time before their fellow professionals are willing to abandon what they have
long considered best practice. At the very least one can hope that their students, future
teachers of the blind and visually impaired, will be entering the professional ranks not
as vision teachers, trying to teach vision, but as teachers of the blind and visually
impaired.

Thank you, Dr. Ferrell and Mr. Muir, for seeing the light and providing a beginning to
the end of visual skills training.

Funding Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTVs)

Through Medical Insurance

by Greg Trapp

Editor&apos;s Note: Greg Trapp has been a staff attorney with the Protection and Advocacy
System of New Mexico since 1992. In 1993 he taught disability law as an adjunct professor
at the University of New Mexico School of Law. Mr. Trapp submitted the following article
simutaneously to the Braille Monitor, the monthly publication of the NFB, and to Future
Reflections. Subsequently, it was published in the November, 1997, issue of the Monitor.
The article has some helpful information about financing Closed Circuit Television Systems
(CCTVs), equipment which some blind students and adults find useful. This is what Greg
says:

In this era of decreasing state and federal budgets, it is increasingly necessary for
blind people to explore alternative ways to fund assistive technology. An assistive
technology device is defined as any item, piece of equipment, or product system that is
used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capability of a person with a
disability. If the device serves a medical purpose, it may also meet the definition of&quot;durable medical equipment&quot;(DME). A closed circuit television can be included
within the definitions of assistive technology and durable medical equipment.

A closed circuit television (CCTV) may enable some people who are legally blind or who
have low vision to read printed materials. It uses a camera and television screen to
create an enlarged image of printed text. It can also enhance contrast by placing white
letters over a black background. If you could benefit from having a CCTV at home, you
might be able to obtain one through your private medical insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare.
These funding sources should be considered along with more traditional funding methods
such as vocational rehabilitation or through an employer as a reasonable accommodation.
Since a CCTV can cost over $3,000, medical insurance may be the only practical way for
many people to obtain a home CCTV.

For some people a properly used CCTV can be a valuable tool which can enhance
productivity and independence. However, it is necessary to understand the limitations of a
CCTV. Keep in mind that a CCTV magnifies only a small portion of text at a time and that
usually the reader must physically move the item being read beneath the camera. Prolonged
reading with a CCTV may also cause eyestrain and headaches. For these reasons reading with
a CCTV can be slow and inefficient. Accordingly, a CCTV is often more appropriate for
elderly persons who have lost vision later in life and who have not developed more
efficient alternative techniques.

Despite its limitations a CCTV can be an effective supplement to other reading methods
such as using Braille, tapes, scanners, electronic text, and sighted readers. A CCTV can
be especially useful for reading and filling out forms, reading small amounts of text, and
writing checks. A CCTV can also be an effective alternative to the use of large print or
hand-held magnifiers.

Some school-aged children may be able to benefit from a CCTV. However, children who
improperly use a CCTV could actually have their educational development impaired. For
instance, there is often a strong tendency to encourage blind children to read using
partial vision instead of using more efficient methods such as Braille. Unfortunately some
parents find it painful to recognize that their visually impaired child is actually
legally blind and in need of Braille. In addition, some school districts are often
reluctant to pay for teachers who have the expertise needed to teach Braille, arguing that
a CCTV (or other adaptive equipment) makes teaching Braille unnecessary. A tragically
common situation is a child with a degenerative eye condition whose teacher ignores
Braille in favor of having the child use her remaining vision even though the vision is
likely ultimately to be lost entirely. In such a case, improper reliance on a CCTV when
Braille should be taught could limit the child&apos;s ultimate Braille proficiency.

Regardless of the age of the person seeking to obtain a CCTV, the individual should be
evaluated by a qualified low-vision professional to determine if a CCTV would be
appropriate. The evaluation should include consideration of factors such as whether the
visual condition is degenerative, whether the condition is stable from day to day, whether
eyestrain will be incurred as a result of using the equipment, and whether the person can
use the CCTV efficiently. Most important, the evaluator must appreciate the benefits of
Braille and speech devices in order to insure that the evaluation will be balanced.

In order to obtain medical insurance coverage for a CCTV, you must have a physician
prescribe a CCTV to treat the visual condition. The first step in the process is to
determine whether your medical insurance could classify a CCTV as a medical device within
the scope of covered services. This process is similar for private health insurance,
Medicaid, and Medicare. Accordingly, because the processes are similar and since Medicare
operates much like a private insurance program, this article will focus on the process
under Medicare.

Medicare is divided into two parts. Part A pays for hospital stays and home health
care. The latter coverage can include payment for durable medical equipment (DME). Part B
coverage can also include payment for DME, as well as coverage of prosthetic devices.

The Medicare description of DME includes devices such as iron lungs, hospital beds, and
wheelchairs. In order for a device to be classified as DME, it must be able to withstand
repeated use, be primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose, be generally
not useful to an individual in the absence of an illness or injury, be appropriate for use
in the home, and be necessary and reasonable for the treatment of an illness or injury or
to improve the functioning of a malformed body member. A CCTV can meet all of these
criteria. A physician must prescribe the CCTV, include it in a treatment plan, and
supervise its use. If these requirements are met, Medicare can pay for a CCTV as an item
of durable medical equipment.

Medicare may also cover a CCTV as a&quot;prosthetic device.&quot;Medicare defines
prosthetic devices as devices which replace all or part of the function of a permanently
inoperative or malfunctioning external body member or internal body organ. For instance,
Medicare covers pacemakers as prosthetic devices, even though a pacemaker does not replace
the heart. Likewise a contact lens prescribed after cataract surgery is also covered as a
prosthetic device since the contact replaces the function of the natural lens. Accordingly
a CCTV may be covered as a prosthetic device since it replaces the functioning of the
damaged portion of the eye.

Once you determine that a CCTV may fall within the scope of a covered service, you must
next obtain a prescription from a physician. In order to obtain a prescription, the CCTV
must be reasonable and necessary. A CCTV is already recognized as a treatment for certain
types of visual impairments. For example, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recognizes
the CCTV as a prosthetic device. In addition, the CCTV is not a comfort item. A comfort
item is an item such as a tape recorder which does not contribute to the treatment of the
visual condition. By contrast a CCTV is a treatment for the damaged portion of the eye. It
does not matter if you will use the CCTV for recreational reading.

Medicare also functions like most private health insurance providers in the way claims
are processed. You must normally first purchase the CCTV from an approved Medicare
supplier, then file a claim for reimbursement. However, some Medicare suppliers will order
medical equipment while awaiting payment from Medicare. Medicaid differs from this process
in that you must first obtain prior approval before you can purchase a CCTV. Medicare will
send the CCTV reimbursement claim (along with supporting documentation) to a Durable
Medical Equipment Regional Carrier (DMERC). The DMERC will determine if the CCTV is
covered and is reasonable and necessary. Reasonable means that it is the lowest priced
item that will meet your medical need. Necessary refers to the medical need established by
your physician. The DMERC will then determine the reasonable cost of the CCTV.

Unlike Medicaid, which pays in full, Medicare subjects you to a deductible of $100 and
a 20 percent co-payment. From the cost determined by the DMERC, Medicare will pay you an
80 percent reimbursement after the $100 deductible. If the supplier has agreed to&quot;accept assignment,&quot;the supplier will only charge the amount determined by the
DMERC. However, suppliers who have not accepted assignment are allowed to charge above the
amount determined by the DMERC, and you will be responsible for the additional charge.
Suppliers who have agreed to accept assignment are listed in the Medicare Participating
Physicians/Suppliers Directory (MEDPARD), which you can request from the DMERC. In some
circumstances Medicare may allow or require rental of a CCTV.

Requests for CCTV&apos;s are often denied. However, you have the right to appeal, and
Medicare appeals are often successful when pursued beyond the initial appeal levels. For
instance, as long ago as 1980 a Medicare beneficiary successfully appealed the denial of a
CCTV. (Medicare Fair Hearing Decision, HIC No. 062-44-0658-A, 1980.) If you receive a
denial, the letter of denial will explain the appeal process, and you should carefully
meet all deadlines and follow all procedures. The appeal procedure is different depending
on whether the claim is under Part A or Part B. The first level of appeal under Part B is
to request a review. The next level is to a hearing officer. Since a CCTV costs more than
$500, claimants under Part B have the right to continue to appeal by requesting a hearing
before a federal administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ level affords you the greatest
chance of success. If the ALJ appeal is not successful, you may request a review by the
Appeals Council. The final appeal level is to federal court. The appeal process under Part
A is somewhat similar but begins with a request for reconsideration. If the denial of the
CCTV is under Medicaid, you also have the right to appeal. In addition, most private
insurers also have appeal procedures. Regardless of the funding source and appeal
procedure, you should be persistent and not take&quot;no&quot;for an answer.

The CCTV can be a valuable tool and has a place in the arsenal of alternative
techniques. By being persistent, you may be able to obtain medical insurance funding for a
CCTV. The immediate goal is to expand the choices you have. The ultimate goal is to
enhance your productivity and maximize your potential.

Can Braille Change the Future?

by Denise Staulter

Reprinted from the March, 1997, issue of Michigan Focus, a publication of the NFB of
Michigan.

As an itinerant teacher of the visually impaired, I often teach my students for many
years. More than four years ago I met a lovely little girl in her second year of school
who had very little usable sight for reading. Before she came to me, she had the use of a
CCTV and other magnifying equipment, but was not doing well in school because of her lack
of sight and inefficient skills for being visually impaired. The first six months we
worked together she constantly talked about quitting school as soon as she turned sixteen.
She hated school so much because she couldn&apos;t do anything.

I started teaching her Braille as intensely as I thought she could handle. I knew that
when she had something she could actually use in school, she would begin to enjoy
academics like her classmates. After a year and a half and the acquisition of a great deal
of Braille knowledge, she was able to read books like the rest of her peers. She finally
began to enjoy school. She was still behind academically and struggled with school work,
but insisted every time the class had a particular book that she also have it in Braille
so she could&quot;read it like them.&quot;She now delights in showing sighted peers how
to read Braille in her books and write Braille words on her Braille writer. This has also
become quite a self-esteem builder.

She is also a very accomplished typist for her age. Typing is a skill she needs right
along with her Braille so she can produce work for her regular education teacher and turn
it in along with her peers. When her regular education teacher asks her to write
something, she does not hesitate to go to her computer and generate her work, knowing she
can do the work as her sighted counterparts.

This student has progressed from constantly talking about quitting school to now
chatting about going on to college, just because she knows she can get the material she
needs and do the work like others. I often wonder how much more successful she and others
like herwho did not begin Braille at a preschool age when their sighted peers
learned letters at age three and fourmight have been? Would she have gone through
the constant feeling of&quot;hating&quot;school, and struggling for two to three years
because of the lack of essential skills needed by a visually impaired student? We cannot
look back, though, and must look forward to help other pupils.

As teachers we must constantly look into the future of our students to make sure they
will have the skills they need to be successful people. Our ultimate goal is the&quot;success of all children through appropriate educational practices, equipment, and
technology.&quot;

The Cody Greiser Story: A Work in Progress

by Jim Marks

From the Editor: The following article is reprinted from The Observer, Spring/Summer,
1997, a publication of the Montana Association for the Blind (MAB), an affiliate of the
National Federation of the Blind.

Some of our long-time readers may remember an article about Cody which appeared in
Future Reflections several years ago. At that time his parents were trying to get the
services they needed in his local school district so he could start kindergarten with his
peers and neighbors. With the help of the NFB, they found a qualified teacher and
everything was greatfor a while.

But, as the saying goes, nothing stays the same. Changes in the family, a move to
another town, a teacher retiresany one or more of these circumstances can change a
blind child&apos;s services overnightfor better or worse. The only thing that remains
constant is the need for vigilance, and the need for the ongoing support and information
available from an organization such as the National Federation of the Blind. Here is the
latest chapter in the saga of one blind child&apos;s precarious journey through the educational
system:

Special Report from the Montana Association for the Blind

The following in-depth report is offered to members, parents of blind children, and
other advocates. The struggle for blind children to receive decent educations in Montana
in skills such as Braille literacy and orientation and mobility has, in a sense, just
begun. Cody&apos;s story, and the commitment of his parents, Marty Greiser of Dillon and Nancy
Taylor of Polson, may hold lessons and encouragement for other parents in Montana. It is
an important story for us all, and surely no one but us, the organized blind of Montana,
are likely to tell it.

What you are about to read was gathered from interviews with some of the parties
involved, observations of legal proceedings, and reviews of relevant documents.

* INTRODUCTION

Cody Greiser, who is blind, lives in Polson, Montana, with his mom, step-dad, and
sisters. His dad is Marty Greiser of Dillon, a long time member of the Montana Association
for the Blind and Secretary of the National Organization of Parents of Blind Children, a
Division of the National Federation of the Blind. Cody is ten years old and will be going
into the fifth grade this fall at Polson&apos;s Cherry Valley Elementary School.

Recently, Cody found himself involved in a struggle for his literacy and his right to
live with his family. It&apos;s hard to believe, but Cherry Valley School officials tried to
take Cody away from his folks by forcing a placement in the Montana School for the Deaf
and Blind (MSDB) in Great Falls. Although an administrative judge gave the family a
favorable decision following the April 1, 1997, hearing in Polson, the struggle is far
from over.

* THE FAMILY&apos;S POSITION

Cody&apos;s parents, Nancy Taylor and Marty Greiser, want their son to learn how to read and
write within his neighborhood school. They do not want to take Cody from his home and
loved ones to be placed in a residential program.

The family knows blindness is a low-incidence disability and that ignorance on the part
of the school system requires them to advocate fiercely for Cody&apos;s education. They
carefully weighed what was best for Cody before reaching the conclusion that Cody was
better off at home than he would be at MSDB.

Finding qualified Braille instructors or aides can be difficult, the family
acknowledges this. So they proposed an option to Cherry Valley officials. They asked that
Cody travel once a week to Thompson Falls, a town about 50 miles from Polson, in order to
receive Braille instruction from Kim Bojkovsky. Bojkovsky is a certified teacher who reads
and writes Braille fluently. She taught Cody when they both lived in Dillon. And it so
happens that Bojkovsky is also blind.

* THE SCHOOL&apos;S POSITION

&quot;Some people in Polson, Montana, believe a sighted teacher can teach Braille
better than a blind person,&quot;said Bob Long, Lake County Deputy Attorney and legal
counsel for Cherry Valley School. He said this to one of the expert witnesses for the
family during the April hearing. The witness was Joanne Wilson, President of the NFB of
Louisiana and Director of the Louisiana Center for the Blind in Ruston. Wilson had just
testified via telephone about the importance of having a teacher of blind children know
how to read and write in Braille.

Surprisingly, the school carried the burden of proof because it was the school which
wanted Cody&apos;s education plan to change. According to Elaine Meeks, Cherry Valley
principal, the school couldn&apos;t find a qualified teacher for Cody, therefore making an MSDB
placement necessary.

It isn&apos;t a matter of money, Meeks said. She said the school tried but failed to find a
competent Braille instructor following the resignation of Cody&apos;s former aide. Meeks said
the school had advertised regionally, but later explained that&quot;regionally&quot;meant advertising in Polson, Kalispell, and Missoula. Meeks therefore said that the school
could not provide Cody with a sound education, and that MSDB was the only alternative.

Meeks rejected the family proposal to have Cody taught Braille once a week by Bojkovsky
in Thompson Falls. She said such a thing would force a public school&apos;s support of a home
school, adding that Cherry Valley couldn&apos;t supervise Bojkovsky properly unless Bojkovsky
was willing to travel to Polson. Due to her pregnancy and other responsibilities in
Thompson Falls, Bojkovsky declined to travel.

Meeks denied the family&apos;s request to have Cherry Valley purchase Braille production
equipment. The family wanted the school to acquire a computer Braille translation software
program and a computer Braille embosser. Asserting the decision wasn&apos;t based on money,
Meeks said the school&apos;s denial of technology purchases was due to the school&apos;s belief
Cody&apos;s Braille skills had not advanced far enough to warrant the purchase.

* WHAT THE EXPERTS SAID

Testimony was also given by two groups of experts. Speaking on behalf of Cherry Valley
Schools were the MSDB principal and two MSDB outreach staff members. Speaking for the
family were three members of the National Federation of the Blind (the Montana Association
for the Blind is the NFB affiliate of Montana).

The MSDB experts said, in Cody&apos;s case, their institution was a more appropriate
placement than Cherry Valley School. They said the MSDB outreach services couldn&apos;t
compensate for the lack of a qualified teacher or aide in Polson. So it was their opinion
that MSDB&apos;s residential program would serve Cody the best. They dismissed the family&apos;s
requests for Braille production equipment as well, saying that the equipment was expensive
and no panacea.

MSDB Principal Bill Davis conceded the hardship of placing a child in a residential
school. He said the parents had to consider the long-term benefits of a good education
over the short-term benefits of keeping Cody at home.

During the hearing, the quality of education at MSDB wasn&apos;t fully discussed. Davis said
most of the blind children at MSDB had multiple disabilities. Cody is only blind, and may
not find as many peers in MSDB as he has in Polson.

Beyond the formalities of the administrative courts, the family expresses strong
concerns about the quality of the MSDB education. They point out how MSDB had to be sued
only a few short years ago when another family wanted their blind child taught Braille.
Moreover, the Greiser family questions the credibility of the MSDB staff. They wonder
aloud about the ability of MSDB staff to read and write Braille fluently, and about the
abilities of staff in other blindness skills. Notably, one of the MSDB experts testifying
against the family had never even met Cody. As time goes on, fewer and fewer blind
children opt for a residential program. Instead, schools like MSDB become institutions for
children with multiple disabilities, and blindness skills often take a back seat to other
matters of disability.

Testifying for the family were Joanne Wilson of Louisiana, Denise Mackenstadt of
Washington, and Kim Bojkovsky of Thompson Falls.

Wilson said Cherry Valley School hadn&apos;t tried hard enough to find a qualified Braille
teacher. She testified about several options that Cherry Valley could have undertaken in
order to get someone qualified involved in Cody&apos;s education. When she was asked about what
was best for Cody, Cherry Valley or MSDB, she said it was a heavy decision which could
only be made by the family. However, she said, the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act requires education to take place in the least restrictive environment. She said she
didn&apos;t know which school had the better educational program, but that placement at MSDB
probably wouldn&apos;t be the least restrictive environment mandated by law.

Mackenstadt, a teacher&apos;s aide in a Bothell, Washington, public school, said it was her
job to assist with Braille instruction and blindness skills in a mainstream school
setting. She explained how well the education of blind children can work when the school
possessed an inclusive, can-do attitude about teaching blind children. And she also
reinforced the doubt about whether Cherry Valley School had done all it could. She added
to Wilson&apos;s testimony regarding places to find or train qualified Braille instructors.

Bojkovsky talked about what she had done with Cody when she was his teacher in Dillon
and about what she could do for him in the future. She said the once a week time would be
adequate, but not ideal. And the adequate instruction which allows Cody to remain at home
is far better than putting him in any residential program, she said.

* WHAT THE JUDGE DECIDED

Dennis Loveless, the Montana Hearings Officer for the Office of Public Instruction,
decided mostly in favor of the family. He wrote:&quot;Analysis of all the factors
apparent in this case indicate that the continued education of Cody Greiser at Cherry
Valley School under the program proposed by the parents would take advantage of
appropriate available resources in the least restrictive setting.&quot;Besides endorsing
the family&apos;s wishes to have Cody remain at Cherry Valley School with one day per week
instruction with Bojkovsky, Loveless also decided that Cherry Valley should acquire
Braille production technology. He decided not to reimburse the family for legal fees and
not to order any additional evaluations of the competency of Cherry Valley or MSDB staff.

It is deeply ironic that Cherry Valley School incurs no legal expenses as they were
represented by the Lake County Attorney&apos;s office. Even more ironic is the unspoken yet
undeniable fact that only those who spoke on behalf of the family read and write Braille
well.

* IT AIN&apos;T OVER

Even though the Loveless decision is clear, Marty Greiser reports that Cherry Valley
School refuses to send Cody to Bojkovsky because they have hired a Braille aide. The
school claims the employment of the aide makes the Loveless decision largely irrelevant.
The family asked to review the credentials of this aide, but no documents have been
forthcoming. In addition, school officials denied the family&apos;s request to begin purchasing
technology items until Cody&apos;s teachers come back to work this fall. In spite of the
triumph in administrative court, it looks as though more court action is likely. It&apos;s a
cinch more advocacy is imperative.

From the Editor: In the same issue was another article about Cody, called&quot;Justice
Takes a Baby Step,&quot;by Dan Burke. The article repeated much of the material given
above, but some of the comments Dan made added new information and insight to the Cody
Greiser story. Here are those comments:

DAN BURKI first met Cody last January when he attended the NFB Washington Seminar
with his dad. Two things about Cody deeply impress me. First Cody has an extremely
creative and active mind. He is about the same age as my own son Sean, who is also very
creative and has been in Missoula&apos;s gifted program since second grade. The comparison was
obvious to me. There is no doubt in my mind that Cody Greiser is a very intelligent young
man. The second thing about Cody which impressed me is that he is very unhappy in school.
He found numerous ways to tell the adults around him of his unhappiness while we were in
Washington.

This simple fact cannot be ignored then. No child will be happy when his school is
failing him. Cherry Valley School has failed to provide the education that Cody needs,
deserves, and is entitled to receive. The school has been&quot;spanked&quot;but shows
little sign of reforming their misguided ways. The struggles for Cody&apos;s parents have not
been in vain but neither are they over.

As the blind of Montana, however, we must remember how crucial our role was and how
crucial the role of the National Organization of Parents of Blind Children has been. The
community of Montana&apos;s blind and the parents of blind children across the country have
been the key to informing and supporting Cody Greiser&apos;s parents in the continuing struggle
for their child&apos;s very future. The Parents&apos; Division of the NFB taught Cody&apos;s parents what
he truly needed from his education and not simply to accept what school officials said
they were willing to provide. The MAB provided $500 toward legal fees, and promised
another $400 if they do not win their battle to force Polson schools to pay the nearly
$4,000 in attorney&apos;s fees accumulated thus far.

So, let us continue to stand beside Cody and his parents. Let the MAB be known across
this great state as an organization with the sword of justice in its hand and truth on its
lips. Let us make it plain that we will not be satisfied with just any education for blind
children, and that we expect qualified teachers for Montana kids who are blind.

Let us never forget the blind children of Montana, and let us be the ever-present
reminder that blind Montanans expect far more than second-rate.

Parents Win Fight with School Board in Virginia

From the Editor: Readers may remember that in the Winter/Spring, 1997, issue of Future
Reflections, we carried an article titled&quot;Virginia Parents Battle Teacher
Shortage.&quot;At that time parents were pressing the Hampton school district in Virginia
to hire more teachers of the blind and visually impaired students. Parents, at that point,
had won a partial victorythe board had agreed to hire a second teacher. That was in
December, 1996. The following article was published in August, 1997--more than six months
later. As this article makes clear, Hampton, Virginia, school officials now seem to
understand that their past struggles to provide only the barest minimum of services to
blind students enrolled in city schools have done incalculable harm to youngsters who were
already facing heavy odds against their success.

Once again we see the damage done by imposing the failure model on the education of
blind children. Waiting for the child to fail using one set of supports before permitting
more useful ones to be tried virtually insures that the student&apos;s self-confidence will
evaporate a little more with every poor grade or uncompleted assignment.

Hampton parents, with help from the parents division of the NFB of Virginia and its
active President Vicki Messick, forced school officials to change things for the future
and correct past mistakes as far as possible.

Here is the story by Sandra Tan as it appeared in the August 7, 1997, Daily Press.

Hampton to Hire Third Staffer for Blind

Schools to Offer Makeup Services

Theresa Brooks sat in her car as the rain turned the cold February night colder. She
had just left a school board meeting to speak on behalf of her visually impaired daughter,
but no one seemed to hear. Her husband had died several months earlier and could lend no
comfort. So she prayed.

&quot;Lord, I&apos;m tired. I feel like I&apos;m all alone. What I said, did it go into people&apos;s
hearts? Is anybody listening?&quot;

Someone finally listened. Brooks&apos;s daughter and other visually impaired students in
Hampton City Schools will be getting more help.

&quot;I don&apos;t know what did it,&quot;said Vicki Messick, president of Parents of Blind
Children, a local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind.&quot;It could be God;
a lot of people have been praying.&quot;

After more than nine months of complaints and lawsuit threats, Hampton City Schools&apos;
administrators agreed to make up for some incomplete and incorrect special education
guidelines that parents say robbed their children of adequate instruction for years.

Since November, parents have complained that their children were illegally denied
preschool instruction because of their age, that unqualified administrators were making
decisions about their children&apos;s schooling, that the number of school vision specialists
was grossly inadequate, and that the guidelines used to determine a student&apos;s right to
services were too narrow.

Most of all, parents complained that school administrators didn&apos;t seem to care whether
they were doing the right thing for a group of children that make up less than two-tenths
percent of Hampton&apos;s overall student population. These complaints were finally addressed
in meetings with parents and parent advocates over the last two weeks.

Given a pending suit filed with the U.S. Department of Education&apos;s Office of Civil
Rights and more protests brought before the local school board, school officials have now
promised to hire more specialists and offer make-up services to children whose parents
have said were wrongly denied instruction.

&quot;A lot of parents had threatened to go to due process hearings, basically take
them to court,&quot;Messick said.&quot;I have no desire to go to court. If we can make
progress another way, so be it.&quot;

Superintendent Billy Cannaday conceded that the school system could have done a better
job of addressing these parents&apos; complaints from the start. Instead of wasting time
arguing about who was technically correct according to state and federal regulations, the
school system should have taken a closer look at the potential harm being done to visually
impaired children, he said.

&quot;We only looked at the letter of the regulations, not the intent of the
regulations, which is to serve children,&quot;he said.&quot;When it came down to doing
what&apos;s best for students, it became a much easier issue to resolve.&quot;

As part of the solution, the Hampton City School Board voted Wednesday to hire a third
vision impairment specialist to help work with about thirty-five children. Last year the
school system had only one specialist working with more than twenty-five children. In
December of 1996, the board approved another position, but the second specialist was not
actually hired until last month. In addition to increasing staff size, the school system
has agreed to offer more than 600 hours of make-up services* to children who received
inadequate vision instruction in their earlier years.

Cannaday said some personnel changes will also be made to insure that such students are
never overlooked or shortchanged again. Money will be reallocated to meet the agreements
reached with parents, Cannaday said, but that the amount will not stress the existing
budget approved by City Council.

Parents and advocates praised the school administrators and board members for their
actions but still wondered at the time it took for those actions to come about.

&quot;I&apos;m very happy that they finally, finally are giving the services that Christina
needed and deserved,&quot;said Brooks, in regard to her fifteen-year-old daughter, a
tenth grader at Bethe High School,&quot;I thank God, I really do.&quot;Christina, an
albino with severely impaired vision, received no school vision assistance until she
nearly failed the second grade, Brooks said.

Brooks&apos;s daughter will receive 345 hours of make-up tutorial and counseling services.&quot;Even though they&apos;re the educators, we&apos;re both on the same team,&quot;Brooks said.&quot;It&apos;s a partnership, raising a child.&quot;

*Editor&apos;s note: What the author calls&quot;make-up services&quot;is called&quot;compensatory education services&quot;by the courts. Children who were either denied
appropriate special education services (services which they needed, but which were never
put on an IEP), or who never received all or some of the special education services listed
on their IEP&apos;s (this is often common with orientation and mobility services), may be able
to negotiate for compensatory hours of services. In some rare cases, parents have
negotiated to receive cash, technology equipment, or other goods and materials in lieu of
hours of teaching services. For more information contact:

Is Due Process in Your Future?

by Larry Larsen and Philip Guzman

Reprinted from ParenTalk, volume 3, issue 3, a publication of The Parents&apos; Place of
Maryland.

From the Editor: This article was written before the 1997 amendments to IDEA were
enacted. Although the new law and the rules implementing it may make some changes to the
process described below, the following information is, and will be, pertinent and valuable
for some time to come.

Also, please note that this article is based upon how things are done in Maryland. Some
variation in procedures is allowed for every state, so please check with your State
Department of Education if you are not clear how something is done in your state (the
process for mediation, for example).

About the authors: Larry Larsen is Co-Director of the Parents&apos; Place of Maryland and
Philip Guzman is an attorney in private practice who specializes in special education law.
He is also the parent of a disabled child. Here, now, is what they say about due process:

Of all the challenging events that a parent might encounter in dealing with their
child&apos;s school system, none is more intimidating and emotionally demanding and potentially
painful than a due process hearing. Many parents, we have learned, arrive at their
scheduled hearings woefully unprepared to present their side of the case and are, as a
result, crushed by a process that was intended to give them equality in resolving
disagreements concerning their child&apos;s education. Clearly, many parents enter the due
process arena without fully understanding what is in store for them.

A due process hearing, it must be remembered, is very similar to a trialand, like
a trial, each side is more interested in presenting the positive aspects of its case than
it is in presenting a completely accurate portrait of the student who is the subject of
the hearing. Put another way, if one party to the hearing possesses evidence that might be
detrimental to its case and beneficial to its adversary, that evidence will most certainly
not be presented.

Hearing Rights

A glance at some of the&quot;hearing rights&quot;granted to both parties by the
regulations for Part B of IDEA (see 34 CFR 300.508) will highlight the adversarial nature
of due process hearings.

According to the Part B regulations, each party has the right to:

1) Be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or
training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities.

2) Present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of
witnesses.

3) Prohibit the introduction of any evidence at the hearing that has not been disclosed
to that party at least five days before hearing.

 

THE PROCESS OF DUE PROCESS

As for the hearing itself, at the outset the hearing officer will introduce him or
herself and give a brief statement of his or her background. All participants in the
hearing will identify themselves for the record and any preliminary issues that are raised
will be discussed. The parent or advocate will be asked if the parents have been afforded
their due process rights, i.e., whether the school system has told the parents about all
their legal rights throughout the process. Oaths will be administered to all the
witnesses. As in a trial, the two parties will then proceed with opening statements. One
party will then present and question its witnesses with the other party having the
opportunity to cross-examine each witness. The second party then presents and questions
its witnesses with each subject to cross-examination. Finally, the two parties have an
opportunity to make closing statements to conclude the hearing. The decision of the
hearing officer is typically rendered within a week or so of the hearing and is mailed to
both parties.

Herewith are some&quot;Do&apos;s&quot;and&quot;Don&apos;ts&quot;that you should keep in mind
if there is the possibility of a due process hearing in your future.

DO consider trying to resolve the disagreement you have with your child&apos;s school system
through more benign and less stressful procedure.

In addition to due process, two other avenues are available to a parent who believes
that the school system is not meeting its obligations to her child. First, if a parent
believes that the school system is clearly violating any of the federal special education
regulations found in 34 CFR 300, filing a complaint with the Maryland State Department of
Education (MSDE) is a better choice than requesting a hearing. Under current federal
regulations (see 34 CFR 300.660-662), a written complaint can be filed whenever it is
believed that a local school system has violated any requirement of Part B of
IDEAthe complainant should specify which regulation she believes has been violated
and the facts on which the complaint is based. MSDE then has 60 days to investigate the
complaint, obtain additional information as necessary, and issue a written decision. If
MSDE does find that the local school system is violating a Part B requirement, it will
order the school system to take corrective action and to refrain from repeating the
violation in the future. The advantage of this option is that it places comparatively few
demands on the parent&apos;s time, emotions, and pocketbook.

A second alternative for resolving disagreements is through mediation. Unlike due
process in which a hearing officer issues a decision (i.e., arbitrates the dispute), in
mediation the&quot;mediator&quot;is not empowered to make decisions. Instead, the role
of the mediator is to promote discussion between the two parties and to assist them in
arriving at a mutually agreeable resolution of their disagreement. Because mediation is a
much gentler process, it is preferred when there is at least a possibility that both
parties are willing to bend a bit and reach a mutually acceptable compromise. However, if
the initial positions taken by the two parties are firm, mediation can turn out to be
nothing more than a waste of time. It should also be noted that a parent who requests
mediation does not give up her rights to a subsequent due process hearingif the
mediation is unsuccessful, she can then proceed with her request for a hearing.

DO get a lawyer or someone who is experienced in due process proceedings to represent
you and argue your case.

The old adage that the lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client is
appropriate hereunless you are skilled and experienced in planning, preparing, and
presenting a case, you should not represent yourself at a hearing.

Preparing for a due process hearing is a long and difficult process that usually
involves the following steps:

1) Carefully and precisely list the points that you want to convince the hearing
officer are true.

2) Review all of the student&apos;s educational records and select those documents that will
help build your case. Arrange to review the student&apos;s entire school record which may be
divided among several folders including the cumulative file, the confidential file, and
discipline and attendance information. The selected documents must then be numbered,
indexed, and duplicated for submission to the opposing party and the hearing officer at
least five days before the hearing (as a matter of courtesy, this&quot;five-day
rule&quot;is typically interpreted as meaning five working days). Remember that it is
your obligation to submit your documents to the hearing officer; the school system will
not do this for you (and frequently will not even tell you that this is your
responsibility).

3) Determine if any additional evidence needs to be obtained in time for the hearing,
for example, observations of the student in his/her classroom(s), additional assessments
by independent examiners, medical records from the child&apos;s pediatrician, etc.

4) Select the witnesses that you plan to call and specify the nature of the testimony
that you want to solicit from each to bolster your case. The names of your witnesses must
be submitted to the opposing party at least five days before the hearing.

5) Write out a sequence of questions to ask each witness that you plan to call (unless
you are quicker on your feet than the average person, you will not have time to think up
questions to ask during the hearing itself). Your questions should be carefully chosen and
phrased so that (a) you know what the answers will be, (b) the person being questioned can
give relatively short answers, and the answers bear directly on the major points you
want to make to the hearing officer.

6) When you get the opposing party&apos;s witness list (which must be given to you at least
five days before the hearing), write out potential questions for each witness listed.

7) Well in advance of the hearing date, meet with the witnesses you plan to call and
prepare them for the testimony that they will give. While you should not rehearse them or
tell them what to say, you do want to make sure that you are in general agreement as to
their testimonyand also that you will not be&quot;blind-sided&quot;by their
testimony.

8) Prepare an opening statement that you will present at the beginning of the hearing
and at least sketch out the primary points that you will want to make in your closing
statement.

While an experienced lawyer can perhaps prepare for a due process hearing in a matter
of hours, a novice should expect to devote between two and four full days to the task. If
you do obtain the services of a lawyer (which is highly recommended), you should not
quibble when she asks for what seems like a king&apos;s ransom as a retainer. Lawyers in
private practice have high overhead costs, and the time that they must devote to
representing you well makes their fees understandable if not reasonable.

DO NOT file a request for a due process hearing and then look for a lawyer or
experienced advocate to represent you.

All too often we have been contracted by parents who tell us that they recently filed
for a due process hearing and who ask for our help in presenting their case. Given the
preparation time that is required, we are rarely capable of doing a good job on such short
notice.

Also, a request for a hearing should not be submitted until the issues of disagreement
have been carefully framed and phrased in terms of alleged violations of federal and/or
Maryland special education regulations. Hearing officers, it must be remembered, can base
their decisions only on law and regulationthey cannot necessarily rule on what they
believe to be the best interests of the student in question.

If you are contemplating a request for due process, do speak with an attorney or
advocate first. Remember to proceed in a timely fashiondo not let a decision with
which you do not agree linger in time or you may eventually face the argument that you
waived your right to proceed on the issue of concern to you.

An experienced attorney or advocate can advise you as to whether or not you have a good
chance of prevailing at the hearing or if you are fighting a lost cause. Remember as well
that, if you are the prevailing party at a hearing, the losing side (the school system)
will likely have to reimburse you for your attorney&apos;s fees.

DO remember that one of the nearly inescapable results of due process is hard feelings.

Due process hearings are confrontational. You can expect the opposing party to try to
devastate your evidence and witnesses, and you can expect your representative to try to do
the same to them. Like divorce, very few due process hearings result in two parties who
have continuing cordial relationships. Given that hard feelings are nearly inevitable, and
knowing that these residual effects can in themselves color the education your child
receives, do not enter the due process arena unless your issue is of sufficient importance
to you that the potential benefits outweigh these costs.

My Cane is Great

by Susie D&apos;Mello

From the Editor: The following item was sent to me by Sue Drapinski, one of the hardest
workers in the NFB of Michigan. This is the brief note Sue sent with the article:&quot;Mrs. Cheadle: This was written by 12-year-old Susie D&apos;Mello from Troy, Michigan. She
and her family found the NFB about two years ago through our&quot;Saturday School&quot;tutoring program.&quot;(The tutoring program is run by the Michigan Parents of Blind
Children Division of the NFB. Blind members of the NFB tutor children in whatever
blindness skills they need. It&apos;s truly one of the best, most creative programs run by any
of our parent divisions.)

It&apos;s difficult to edit material written by a child. Some clean-up is always helpful,
but it&apos;s important not to do so much that the unique&quot;voice&quot;of the child is
lost. So, with only a touch-up here and there, here is what Susie D&apos;Mello has to say about
her cane:

My cane can be like a best friend to me. My cane guides me when I walk or go places. It
keeps me from running into things, and it lets me know if I am on grass or concrete. At
night, especially when I have to walk by myself, then my cane really comes in handy. It
helps me to go where I need to be, and it makes me feel a little bit braver.

My cane helps me get around. I know that I can always ask for help if I cannot find
something because of my vision. Most people know that I cannot see when they notice my
cane and will assist me in a way that I understand it. If I ask for something, and the
person who is helping me for some reason does not know that I need more help and that I
cannot see well, than I just tell that person politely to guide me, or whatever assistance
that I need. My cane, as you can see, has helped make me more independent.

Whoever invented the cane was brilliant. It may look simple but I know that it has
helped many people in many ways. Sometimes, when I am at a store, I see people staring at
me. I do not care because my cane does not help them, and it is worth being stared at. I
use my cane at school especially when there is a fire drill or tornado drill and everybody
is rushing around. I just grab my cane and stick with my class, and I know that I will be
just fine. Another good thing is that, at school, a lot of people know me even if I did
not know who they are. They say&quot;Hi&quot;to me and know why I have the cane, and
they do not play with it. When I go to my piano class it is dark when I leave, so my cane
helps me to get to the car by myself. If I take a walk my cane will tell me when the
street comes so I do not just walk off the curb.

Being the only person in school who carries a cane makes me feel kind of special and
unique. I like to carry my cane with me. All this that I have been writing proves that my
cane helps me a lot because it has covered most of the areas of my life. Maybe other
people don&apos;t know it, but I sure know that my cane is like a best friend to me and I am
proud to have one. My cane is great.

Teacher Recognition

Mr. Scott Smith

Orientation and Mobility Instructor, California

September 10, 1997

To: Future Reflections

From: Mary Beth Phillips

Re: Teacher Recognition

In reading through the Future Reflections issue from Winter/Spring, 1997, I saw that
there is a way to acknowledge the work of excellent teachers. I would like to submit this
letter I sent to the Contra Costa County Office of Education regarding Scott Smith, my
daughter&apos;s mobility instructor last year.

Scott taught my daughter, Elizabeth Phillips, age 14, last

year in Orientation and Mobility. Elizabeth was accepted to a new

high school for this fall. Scott worked with her at the end of last

year and also right before school started this year, to orient her

to the new campus. He worked with Elizabeth under the Moraga School

District and the Acalanes Unified School District during her eighth grade year and
summer in-between respectively.

Scott has taught mobility in Africa and has worked for the County Office of Education.
I hope our letter speaks for itself and that you will think about including it in your
magazine. He is a fine teacher!

Sincerely,

Mary Beth Phillips

Moraga, California

Mr. Mike Hancock

Contra Costa County Office of Education

Santa Barbara Road

Pleasant Hill, California

Dear Mr. Hancock,

Thank you for your efforts to make the transition for Elizabeth from junior high to
high school as smooth as possible. The school year has started out well, and Elizabeth
seems to have adjusted to her new school already.

One of the main reasons why this seems to be the case is the preparation she had
on-site at the new school by Scott Smith. Scott&apos;s tireless work with Elizabeth to orient
her to the new campus and to provide the support necessary for her adjustment, made all
the difference.

I am sure that you know what a fine mobility instructor you have in Scott. He is able
to communicate technical orientation and mobility skills well to his students. But the art
of what he does (which is less tangible and harder to define) is more impressive. It is
the little things that make a difference. In the past for Elizabeth&quot;little
things&quot;have added up in negative ways. Left unaddressed, they created undue and
excessive stressors which made the difference between success and failure. I would like to
highlight some of the things Scott did for Elizabeth that made things so much better for
her this year.

1. Scott included Elizabeth in planning goals and objectives.

Elizabeth was able to help define priorities which ensured buy-in and focus for their
lessons. Scott Brailled up the proposed goals and objectives so that Elizabeth could
follow along with the discussion and be an active part of her own IEP goal development.
This&quot;little detail&quot;spoke deeply about Scott&apos;s inclusive philosophy and respect
for Elizabeth as a person, which did not go unnoticed by Elizabeth. It enriched her trust
and respect for him.

2. Scott communicated clearly about when and where he was going to work with Elizabeth.
Rain or shine, her time with Scott was predictable. He believed that she needed to work in
rainy conditions or cold, foggy conditions, too, because all of us must get around in less
than ideal weather, and the sound of things changes under certain climate conditions. This&quot;detail&quot;was important learning for Elizabeth, and we were grateful he did not
use the weather as an excuse to cancel a lesson. The predictability also created a greater
sense of trust between student and teacher.

3. Scott saw Orientation and Mobility as related to

Elizabeth&apos;s whole school experience, not a separate exercise to be done after school.
Orientation and Mobility was inclusive of details like securing an accessible locker with
an appropriate lock through the school that would take into consideration how much (or
little) time Elizabeth had between classes, how easy the locker was to find using cues
such as edges of locker rows, and the problems with combination locks for visually
impaired people. He took it upon himself to facilitate the communication about this with
Elizabeth and the school administrator. The locker was then put into the&quot;route,&quot;and this made Elizabeth a more efficient student on the first day of
school. But it also helped the school to see that&quot;reasonable accommodation&quot;is
often a very do-able&quot;little thing&quot;that makes life much better. Scott&apos;s calm,
matter of fact, undemanding approach puts everyone at ease. If the school had
apprehensions about having a totally blind child included, they quickly learned from Scott
that Elizabeth doesn&apos;t need big alterations, just thoughtful appreciation of how her
visual impairment changes or impacts her experience of student life (which is sometimes
different from a sighted student&apos;s).

4. Right before school started Scott was working with

Elizabeth on learning her new class schedule. They had basically covered all the routes
when construction activities made a main staircase, key to many routes, unavailable.
Scott&apos;s calm and even-handed communication about this change and subsequent work with
Elizabeth to reorient her, helped Elizabeth take the change in stride. This was key to
Elizabeth&apos;s confidence that she had the foundation necessary to make the shift, and that
she would be fine when school started. And she was.

5. Scott provided casual&quot;in-service&quot;to teachers as he worked with Elizabeth
on campus. He projected respect and confidence in Elizabeth that has helped to ensure
others&apos; respect and confidence. He was willing to speak with students and teachers and
answer their questions. This approachability helped to break down barriers of anxiety
others may have had; this was of great benefit to Elizabeth.

6. Scott has been able to assess Elizabeth&apos;s strengths and weaknesses and adjust his
teaching style to fit her unique personality and needs. Some of Elizabeth&apos;s weaknesses are
subtle; injuries she sustained as an infant have affected her in other ways than her&quot;just being blind.&quot;These have rarely been addressed in all the years she has
been in special education programs. Her weaknesses were never excuses on Scott&apos;s part for
why she could not or would not learn. Her weaknesses were seen as just aspects of
Elizabeth that needed to be accommodated, problem-solved, and addressed through
skill-building in other areas, usually through an emphasis on her strengths. How lucky
Elizabeth has been to have had this kind of teaching leadership!

Scott has a kind of integrity that he brings to his work which informs all that he
does. Orientation and Mobility instructors spend a great deal of one-on-one time with a
student, and the nature of the work requires trust between teacher and student. There is
really no way to get this except for mutual respect. Of all Scott&apos;s gifts as a teacher,
this inherent one is, in our opinion, his greatest strength. He is simply a fine person,
and it shows in all he does.

Thank you for allowing Scott to work with Elizabeth this summer to get her ready for
her new school. We have greatly appreciated the spirit and skill he brings to his
students. For most of us, there are teachers we have had that influenced our lives, coming
at key times, or reaching us in special ways that helped shape us. We are sure that
Elizabeth will look back on the learning she has had with Scott in this way.

Sincere Regards,

Mary Beth and Bob Phillips

Sharing Creative Movement with Your Child

by Edwina Peterson Cross

Reprinted with permission of the author from Welcome Home, Volume 13, No. 12, December,
1996, a publication of the national nonprofit organization, Mothers At Home.

From the Editor: It&apos;s wonderful to be told, as parents of blind children, that our
children are more like sighted children than not. And it&apos;s reassuring to hear that blind
kids, given the opportunity and training, can participate in ordinary activities with
little or no assistance and maybe a few adaptations here and there. But it&apos;s quite another
thing to behave as if we really believe it. Especially when it comes to the most ordinary
physical activities.

Parents are often stymied by the simplest thingsteaching a child to tie shoes,
bounce a ball, skip rope, climb a tree, use a knife to cut meat or spread peanut butter,
walk quickly, climb steps gracefully, and so the list goes. It isn&apos;t hard for blind
children to do these thingsif given the opportunity to practice the basic body
movements upon which these skills are based. And that practice should begin as soon as the
child can move. It isn&apos;t work for the childit&apos;s play, and it&apos;s fun. But these
playful movements are building a foundation for very important physical and social skills
which the child will need later in life.

Several articles in this issue, including this one, deal with various aspects of
encouraging normal body movement. You will notice that the following article was written
for the general publicnot for blind children at all. But the information is basic to
all children, and many of the suggested activities can be done with few if any adaptations
for blind children. Here it is:

My mother says I began dancing before I was born. It certainly seems I have always
known the joy of movementmovement that combines the physical body with the mind and
spirit. It has often been my privilege to share that joy with children by teaching them
creative dance.

Before birth, a child is constantly exposed to rhythmthe internal pattern created
by its mother&apos;s heartbeat and its own. Very early in life, a baby will indicate a love of
sound and movement in many ways. A two-year-old stops to listen to the stereo, and you can
almost see her thinking,&quot;The music is all very well, but it&apos;s not quite
enough!&quot;Her arms lift, something moves inside her, and she begins to dance.

My creative dance classes begin with three- and four-year-old children. At this age,
children move instinctively, as they&apos;re still free of the inhibitions that can stifle
movement in adults and older children. Dancing enhances their creativity and reinforces
the idea that moving in their own way is right and good. Older children can experience the
joy of movement and can go on to more and more advanced explorations, but sometimes they
must shed inhibitions and shyness before they are able to let themselves move freely.

While a formal class in creative movement or creative dance can be a place for a child
to experiment with different ways of moving, there are many activities a parent can do to
nurture a child&apos;s instincts for creative movement.

Parents can help to develop that creative spirit by reinforcing a free, uninhibited
style and movements that are unique and different. A child needs to understand that not
all movement is competitive or goal-oriented. Like art, movement can be an expression of a
child&apos;s inner self. Mom or Dad can even encourage while correcting in a time and place
where movement isn&apos;t appropriate.&quot;I see your beautiful butterfly wings. Right now
you need to fold them up and be as quiet as a caterpillar. When we get home you can fly
them all over the backyard, and I&apos;ll watch!&quot;

Understanding the ten basic elements, or building blocks, of dance is helpful to
parents, since all movement is based on these elements. The child uses them much as he
uses different media for art (crayons, paint, clay). They are tools with which the body
and mind work.

The building blocks are simple.

1. Size: Big movements, small movements, and everything in between.

2. Directions: Moving forward, backward, sideways, up and down.

3. Level: Movements close to the ground (low level), stretching, reaching, jumping
(high level movements), and everything in between.

4. Shape: Body design in space.

5. Steps: Walk, run, hop, jump, leap, gallop, slide.

6. Body moves: Stretch, bend, twist, swing, sway, shake.

7. Body parts: head, shoulders, arms, hands, hips, back, feet, toes, etc.

8. Force: Sharp or smooth, tight or loose, strong or light.

9. Tempo: Fast or slow.

10. Pathway: The path in which the movement takes the dancer.

The atmosphere of movement should be one of exploration and
experimentationdiscovery by doing. As children learn the elements they begin to
translate each one into movement, using the elements separately and in combination to
produce interesting and creative movement. There is no right or wrong.

Readily available objects help children to&quot;see&quot;movement. A rubber band for&quot;stretch,&quot;pipe cleaners for&quot;bend,&quot;jar lids for&quot;twist,&quot;a
weight on a string for&quot;swing,&quot;a top for&quot;spin,&quot;a broom against the
wall for&quot;lean,&quot;trees blown by a high wind for&quot;sway.&quot;There is no
better way to understand&quot;shake&quot;than to watch a wet dog! After they have
watched and digested, children can translate each new word into movements of their own.

As they begin to incorporate the elements, they can try combining them in different
ways. A suggestion could be,&quot;Can you make a very tiny shape and still swing
something?&quot;or&quot;See if you can move forward at a low level.&quot;Questions work
well, too&quot;What can your arms do while your feet are sliding?&quot;as do
reinforcing statements like,&quot;You&apos;re moving very, very slowly as you turn!&quot;Verbal directions and reinforcements are better than an adult&apos;s physical demonstrations,
because children learn early to imitate, and at this stage, imitation is the antithesis of
creative movement. Children need to experiment and discover the wonderful things their own
bodies can do. By developing these concepts, the children&apos;s vocabulary and verbal
abilities develop along with their movement skills.

There are other ways to make movement ideas more concrete for children. Some items they
can observe and translate into their own movements are: pinwheels, crepe paper streamers,
balloons, lightweight brightly colored scarves, loops of tricot, yarn balls, Chinese jump
ropes, bells strung on elastic to go on wrists and ankles, garbage bags filled with air
and tied shut. A hot-air popper set in the center of a large sheet and allowed to pop the
corn without the lid provides a memorable experience in movement (when watched from a safe
distance!) Watching food color slowly dissolve in water, studying the cat, blowing
bubblesany movement that the child can analyze and transfer into her own movement
vocabulary is valuable.

Language, music, literature, art, and poetry can be used as springboards to movement. A
Rainbow of My Own by Don Freeman, Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak, The Bear
Dance by Chris Riddel, Jamberry by Bruce Degan, Grandfather Twilight by Barbara Berger,
and The Rainbow Giblins by Ulde Rico are picture books that can stimulate thought and
feeling and help get movement ideas flowing. Children love to move to the poetry of Shel
Silverstein, Christina Rossetti, and Myra Cohn Livingston, as well as Robert Louis
Stevenson and William Shakespeare. Sing a Song of Popcorn, published by Scholastic, Inc.
is a good collection of poems, many of which translate easily into movement.

Music is an invaluable companion of movement, and any kind of music works. Children
respond well to a strong beat, but also love to move to all varieties of classical music,
rock, and jazz. The flavor and the feeling of the music can be varied to provide different
movement experiences. Children love to move to the beat of a drum or just the clapping of
hands. Clapping out the syllables of their names or the name of foods: ap-ple, lem-on,
ba-na-na, lime, is a good pre-reading exercise, too.

The more children move, the more they develop strength, flexibility, and awareness and
control of their bodies. Movement as creative expression can be a pathway for building
self-awareness, self-image, and self-directionand it&apos;s fun!

Miss Idaho 1994: A Special Friend

by Ramona Walhof

Reprinted from a 1995 issue of the Gem Stone Milestones, the newsletter of the NFB of
Idaho.

Editor&apos;s Note: Can blind children learn to move gracefully? Can they learn to dance?
The following article, which describes how one outstanding young woman shared her talent
with underpriviledged blind children, seemed a good campanion to the preceding one about&quot;Creative Movement.&quot;Here it is:

Tracy Yarbrough, Miss Idaho 1994, is ending her reign this month, but she will be
remembered as caring, talented, and beautiful. She has been a dancer and a singer since
early childhood, and the NFB of Idaho has been privileged to have her at two of our
events. Last October Miss Yarbrough joined us for an art auction, and this spring she sang
for our fashion show. Her voice reminds one of Patsy Kline, and she says that is what is
intended.

Tracy Yarbrough grew up in Tennessee in a loving and supportive family. By the age of
12 she had so much success in gymnastics and ballet that she had to choose to specialize
in one. She chose ballet. She practiced 3 hours a day, 7 days a week, and performed in the
best shows. At age 6 she was the angel in the Nutcracker. By the age of 16 she was the
lead. In addition to the Snow Queen, she danced numerous other solo parts. Also at 16 she
began dance instruction.

Naturally, Miss Yarbrough knew most of the dancers in Memphis. A friend, Miss Farris,
was teaching a dance class for young, blind, low-income children. Tracy was interested.
She offered to help. Finding that she enjoyed this activity very much, she gradually took
over most of the teaching.

The dance class came about because a supervisor of instruction of blind children in the
Memphis school district (who also happened to be a member of the NFB) thought that a dance
class might help underpriviledged blind children become better prepared for first grade.
It did.

This class was important enough to Tracy that, for five years, she commuted every
Wednesday morning from college in another city to Memphis to volunteer her time to teach
the dance lessons.

Tracy told me why she loved it, and why the children loved it, too. Zachery was a
five-year-old she will never forget. At first he was not cooperative at all. He would go
into the corner and sit down, singing along with the music instead of trying to dance.
Therefore, he was dropped from the dance class for awhile. When he returned it was on
condition that he cooperate and work.

We who work with the blind know that too often expectations are not high for blind
children, and this may have been the first time Zachery had to measure up. Miss Yarbrough
and Miss Farriswho were not specially trained in blindnessdid keep
expectations high, and found ways to stimulate these young blind children through
dancesomething they did know well. Zachery responded and within a year became the
top dancer in the group. He was ready to go on to the first grade and graduated out of the
dance class. There is no doubt that it helped him meet the world.

Tracy describes her work with the children. She says it was easier for the children to
learn the dance movements when she moved their arms, legs, and other parts of their bodies
rather than when they felt hers. This is not surprising. Miss Yarbrough is a small woman,
but to a five-year-old, it would be hard to reach as far as necessary. She also learned
that it was good for the children to help one another. Both the strong and weak dancers
benefited from this peer help.

Tracy found that the children enjoyed ballet and learned the same routines she taught
to sighted children. But the rhythmic sounds of the tap dancing were even better. Music
provided motivation to these children. A special privilege was to turn the tapes on and
start the music. Not all blind people are musical, but sound is interesting to most blind
persons.

Miss Farris resumed the instruction of the class in Memphis when Tracy moved to Boise
to finish college at Boise State University. During her senior year she was urged to try
for Miss Idaho, and she won. She has represented the State well and is passing on the
crown. The blind of Idaho are among the many who have been enriched by getting to know
her.

When I asked if she would like to teach dance to blind children again, Tracy&apos;s tone was
of absolute certainty.&quot;Of course,&quot;she said. Her common sense and caring have
made an important difference for at least 20 small, blind, underprivileged children like
Zachery.

Munchkin Mobility

Twelve to Twenty-Four Months

by Jane Bartley

Reprinted from VIP News 13/2, March/April 1997, a publication of the Visually Impaired
Preschool Services of Louisville, Kentucky.

Editor&apos;s Note: If the name&quot;Bartley&quot;rings a bell, it&apos;s because you may
remember reading items printed in Future Reflections by or about Dr. Ralph Bartley,
Superintendent of the Kentucky School for the Blind. And yes, Jane is related. She is his
wife, and she is a well-known and respected professional in her own field of orientation
and mobility. Here is what she has to say about&quot;Munchkin&quot;mobility:

During the twelve months that a child is between one and two years of age, new skills
are learned each day. Each child will develop at his or her own pace. As parents,
care-givers, and interventionists, we must allow for individual differences, but we can
encourage and teach skills that the child is ready for during our daily routine. Most of
the necessary daily chores (for example, dressing, going out and about in the car, and
picking up toys) can be fun-filled learning experiences for your little one.

Safety is always an issue with children, but once you have addressed safety issues in
your child&apos;s environment, allow your child the freedom to learn about his world in a
hands-on fashion. The days when your child will spend long awake periods of time in the
crib or play pen are past. Your child&apos;s world has expanded, and he or she is ready to
learn about it.

Now that your child is investigating (either scooting, crawling, or cruising your
home), you will want to place familiar stationary items in his environment that help
orient him and tell him where he is located. By creating ways to move from one place to
another using familiar things, furniture, and sounds, your child will begin to develop
some simple routes. Children tend to learn the most by doing things by themselves. Stand
back and watch how your child problem-solves and travels through the environment.

Acquaint your child with the rooms in your house and make him aware of what is in each
room. For example, in the kitchen we have the sink where we get water for a drink and the
refrigerator that makes a noise and keeps our food cold. The texture of the carpet and the
feel of the kitchen floor are noticeable to the bottom of his feet with and without shoes.
His touching different surfaces (walls, furniture, floors, doors, windows) adds to the
knowledge he is collecting about his environment. Allow your child to explore the stairs
in your home. Let him sit on them, lie down on them, and feel how big they are. Tell him
what the stairs are made of and why there is a hand rail. And then, in a supervised
manner, let him explore the stairs.

Since&quot;independence&quot;is the long-term goal of orientation and mobility, don&apos;t
forget to work on other areas where you can allow your child to experience age-appropriate
skills and build confidence. Teach your child to hold and drink from a cup. Work on finger
feeding and scooping with a spoon. Teach him to search for things he drops. Allow him to
be involved in cleaning off his face and hands and washing and drying at bath time.

As your child learns new skills his world will just keep getting bigger and bigger. Get
plastic wall plugs for the wall outlets and allow your child to explore from his room to
the kitchen cupboards. The support and encouragement you provide in this second year of
life will be a good investment in your child&apos;s future.

Pediatric Physical Therapy: Focusing on the Whole Child

by Gail A. Hatch

Editor&apos;s Note: Many blind children today have additional disabilities. It is not
uncommon for a blind baby, toddler, preschooler, or older child to work with many
different specialists, such as an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, and a
physical therapist. The physical disabilities which create the need for these services may
vary from mild and eventually correctable, to profound and life-long. The following
article was submitted by Carol Castellano, a frequent contributer to this magazine and a
national and state leader in the National Organization of Parents of Blind Children. Her
daughter, who currently has no other disability besides blindness, needed physical therapy
for several years. Carol found the following approach and information helpful and wanted
to share it with other parents and professionals. Here it is:

As a pediatric physical therapist, my goal is to facilitate functional and efficient
movement in a child and to promote motor development. During my training and education,
however, I realized the need for a more holistic approach to physical therapy. A child is
more than just a group of muscles. A child is an individual with a set of interacting
emotions, physical and mental capabilities. In addition, a child is an integral part of a
large system of relationships which strongly influence the child&apos;s development.

In order for a child to move, suggests Esther Thelen, psychologist and author of many
research articles, the child&apos;s perception, motivation, and sense of well being interact
with the system of bones and muscles. Since the child&apos;s relationships affect his or her
motivation and self-esteem, the therapist must be sensitive to them. As a pediatric
therapist, I interact with parents, siblings, and peers, as well as with the child.
Families have different cultural and religious beliefs, structures, and expectations, all
of which have an impact on the child and all of which must be respected.

I am a professional coming into the life of the family to help mold motor development.
I need to gain the parents&apos; trust. The reaction of parents is very important because it
will be directly reflected to the child, who must also have a trusting relationship with
me, in order for therapy to be effective.

As a professional working with children and parents, therefore, I must respect the
family&apos;s needs, priorities, and goals. I can help parents focus on their child&apos;s
abilities, not limitations, in an effort to support their bond with each other and to set
expectations and goals. Depending on the needs of a parent or child during a particular
session, motor goals may become secondary. Work on motor skills at a time of great stress
for the family may not be of greatest benefit.

I have utmost respect for parents of children with special needs. I try to bolster
their strength, support their efforts, and empathize in their moments of grief. Many
parents have questions about their child&apos;s abilities which they need to have answered in
order to set goals. Many times, I share a family&apos;s stress when they hear a diagnosis or
when they have one more overwhelming doctor&apos;s appointments to attend. In the midst of all
this, parents are trying to develop a bond with their child, a child who may not be able
to respond easily. I have felt helpless during times of great difficulty for a family and
have wished that I could predict success for the child. I wish that I always knew the
right things to say and that I could do more than just listen and offer support.

Parents are the most competent people in their child&apos;s life. Much of the success the
child demonstrates is attributable to the parents&apos; work, since the parents are with the
child so much of the time. The other part of success is attributable to the child&apos;s hard
work. Every child has abilities and these need to be emphasized and built upon. Parents
and children have their own needs, priorities, and goals, and as a professional dealing
with the whole child, I must respect these. For it is only then that I can truly say that
I have done the best I can for the child.

Computer Games for Blind Children

by Greg Trapp

Editor&apos;s Note: Greg Trapp has been a staff attorney with the Protection&amp;Advocacy
System of New Mexico since 1992. In 1993, he taught Disability Law as an adjunct professor
at the UNM School of Law. He presently serves on the Board of Directors of the Albuquerque
Chapter of the National Federation of the Blind, serves on the Board of Directors of the
National Association of Blind Lawyers, is Chair of the New Mexico Commission for the Blind
Statewide Rehabilitation Advisory Council, and serves on the IDEA State Advisory Panel.
Greg, who was blinded as a teen, is very interested in promoting opportunities for blind
children.

A recent experience has opened my eyes to the remarkable ability of computer games to
teach blind children. I was working with a special education client when it was decided
that he needed a break from a lengthy diagnostic evaluation. I suggested he come to my
office to see my speech adapted computer system. I loaded a computerized version of
Monopoly and started to play it with my young client. Fascinated by the game, he quickly
learned the locations of several new keys. He also showed an interest and excitement for
learning more about the computer. Intrigued by this experience, I decided to look for
additional computer games which might be played by blind children. This article describes
some of the games I found during my search and, hopefully, does it in a way which will be
useful to all parents, regardless of their computer knowledge.

My search was confined to NFBnet, the bulletin board system (bbs) of the National
Federation of the Blind. NFBnet contains a large number of computer games which work well
with speech synthesizers and which can be downloaded for free as freeware, shareware, or
as a demo program. While freeware comes with no strings attached, the author of a
shareware program hopes you will pay a modest fee to register the program to receive
updates or additional features. A demo program is a sample version of a commercially
available software program. Demo programs limit features or restrict usage to encourage
the purchase of the program. You can telnet to NFBnet at [NFBnet.org], or access it by
modem at 612-696-1975. However, if you do not have a clue what it means to&quot;telnet,&quot;think a&quot;modem&quot;might be one of the Three Stooges, and think
that an&quot;unzip utility&quot;should never be mentioned in polite circles, than I
suggest you ask for help from a friend or relative who understands such things.

Before I begin to discuss the games I found it is necessary to first make some
disclaimers. Of course, being a lawyer, disclaimers come naturally to me. My first
disclaimer is that I approached the project with certain preconceived notions.
Accordingly, I did not examine the several&quot;sword and sorcerer&quot;games which I
found, nor did I do more than a cursory examination of a couple of the numerous war and
adventure games which are on NFBnet. While these games may teach persistence and patience,
I believe that there are other games which provide greater educational benefit. I
downloaded about two dozen games which I thought had the greatest educational potential.
The games I downloaded were those which I thought might help develop basic keyboarding,
math, linguistic, and/or social skills. However, since I am not a trained educator my
assessment of the educational value of these games is only my lay opinion.

The first two games I will describe will run on any PC-compatible computer and do not
require the computer to have a speech synthesizer. The other games I describe require a
speech synthesizer in order to be used by persons who are blind. For my review I used a
486 computer equipped with Vocal-eyes and an Accent synthesizer. The games I examined are
for use with the DOS operating system. The games will work on Pentium, 486, 386, or 286
computers, and most will even work on older 8088 computers. By contrast, the latest video
games being sold in computer stores require the newest Pentium computers running Windows
operating systems. Although blind computer users should be shifting to Windows, these
DOS games can still serve a useful purpose. The first game I want to describe is called&quot;Piano.&quot;Piano is a very simple game which turns a computer keyboard into a
piano. A significant benefit of Piano is that it does not require you to have a speech
synthesizer on your computer. All you need is a PC-compatible computer. Piano can
introduce very young children to the computer keyboard and teach some basic keyboarding
skills. Piano might also help to develop your child&apos;s finger strength and dexterity. Piano
would be most appropriate for pre-school and early elementary ages, though it might also
benefit some older children. The disadvantage of Piano is that the tones it produces will
probably annoy you long before your child tires of playing with it.

Like Piano, ABC-talk does not require you to have a computer equipped with a speech
synthesizer. Instead, it contains a digitally reproduced human voice which is heard
through the computers internal speaker or sound card. By selecting menu choices&quot;B,&quot;&quot;C,&quot;or&quot;D,&quot;ABC-Talk will help a child to learn the
alphabet and to learn where letters are located on the keyboard. For instance, by
selecting menu item&quot;D,&quot;ABC-Talk will voice the letter which is typed. ABC-Talk
only voices letters, not any other keys on the computer. Because ABC-Talk and Piano do not
require a speech synthesizer, they can be an affordable way to teach some basic computer
skills to young children. For instance, you could probably purchase an old 286 computer
for under $50, and use it to help your child develop some basic keyboarding skills.

The rest of the games I examined require a speech synthesizer and screen review program
in order to be used by the blind. The best of these, in my opinion, is Monopoly. The game
is based on the well-known Parker Brothers board game. However, because the computer does
all of the banking and keeps track of the property, the computerized version moves with a
faster and more exciting pace. Yet, the game retains all of the endearing qualities that
have made the original such a lasting success. Monopoly blends elements of luck and
strategy to make for an interesting and challenging contest. It requires frequent math and
probability calculations, such as the choice of whether to pay a flat tax rate of
two-hundred dollars or a calculated rate of 10 percent. In addition, good sound effects
and the fun of rolling the dice make the game enjoyable for children who are too young to
understand the rules and nuances of the game. Monopoly can be played by up to four
players, allowing for development of your child&apos;s social skills. Though Monopoly 6.4 is on
NFBnet, Monopoly 6.2 has a&quot;listen to the status&quot;option specifically designed
for blind computer users. This option may help younger children to keep track of their
property. However, Monopoly 6.4 works very well with speech, and I do not think the
feature would add that much to the game. The only drawback to Monopoly 6.4 is that the
counting of spaces seems a little bit slow.

Of the math games that I looked at, MOBIUS96 was the best. MOBIUS96 is designed
specifically for blind computer users and works very well with speech. The game provides
an entertaining trek up a mountain while the players are asked different math problems.
MOBIUS96 has terrific sound effects and an amusing plot. Your computer must have a hard
drive to run MOBIUS96. Though not necessary, a sound card would make the program even more
enjoyable. The demo version limits the degree of difficulty to single and double digit
math problems. Accordingly, the Demo version is best suited to younger students. However,
the full version of MOBIUS96 offers additional skill levels and can be purchased for $20.

A less entertaining but more challenging math game is MATHWO1A. This game quizzes
players on a wide range of math problems, with adjustments available for time and degree
of difficulty. My primary concern with MATHWO1A is that it did not run especially well
with Vocal-eyes, though this could probably be improved by adjusting speech settings. For
instance, there are some conflicts with keys normally used by screen review programs, and
the player will have to take some time to learn how to make the program work with speech.
Both MOBIUS96 and MATHWO1A have tremendous potential to improve your child&apos;s ability to
make math calculations.

One of the more absorbing games is DOSBJ, a computerized version of the traditional
blackjack card game. The game begins with the player selecting the number of decks to be
shuffled and the amount of money to be wagered. Unfortunately, the game does not allow for
more than one player to play at a time. Instead, the player bets money against the
computer. The primary educational benefit of DOSBJ is that it can teach mathematics and
probability through game theory. If you are troubled by a gambling game, you might be
comforted by knowing that the game can also teach the real life lesson that the house
always wins in the end.

Another excellent game that works well with speech is Hangman. After selecting the
educational option from the menu the player is offered a definition of a word and given a
limited time to provide the answer. The difficulty can be adjusted by choosing either&quot;amateur&quot;or&quot;expert,&quot;and by adjusting the time allowed to provide
the answer. There is also an orchestra which plays music as the player is thinking, though
the orchestra should be turned off in order for the program to work best with speech.
Hangman is an entertaining program and is an excellent way to improve your child&apos;s
vocabulary.

There are a number of other games which deserve mentioning. One of the most appealing
is DOSLife, which is a computerized version of the board game Life. It works well with
speech and may be entertaining for older elementary students. Another game that some
children may enjoy is DOSFBALL. DOSFBALL is a computerized football game specifically
designed for blind computer users. It allows the player to be the quarterback and choose
his/her favorite professional team. Unfortunately, the game is seriously dated in that
most of the team members are now retired. DOSFBALL also throws in some random and
unnecessary comments which distract from the flow of the game. Another football game
designed specifically for blind persons is FAN95. Though FAN95 is a demo which permits
only 10 minutes of play, it provides greater realism and entertainment. The full version
of FAN95 costs $30, and would be a good game for a parent who is a sports fan to play with
his/her child.

If football is not your cup of tea there are several baseball games which may be
selected. One of the better of these is DOSBASE2, which uses a variety of clever sound
effects to make the game more interesting. However, DOSBASE2&apos;s sound effects place greater
demands on your computer, making it necessary for your computer to at least have a hard
drive. Like DOSFBALL, DOSBASE2 is specifically designed for blind computer users. For
older baseball enthusiasts, there is BBTRIVIA and WSBB11. BBTRIVIA challenges the player
with 250 trivia questions. For a registration fee of $15, the game can be upgraded to
1,500 questions. WSBB11 is another demo of a program specifically designed for blind
computer users. WSBB11 is an elaborate game with wonderful sound effects. Accordingly,
WSBB11 requires a computer with at least a hard drive and ideally a 486 or Pentium with a
sound card. The demo version of WSBB11 is very impressive, though it limits play to five
innings and interrupts each inning with a commercial. WSBB11 costs $35.

Another game which deserves mentioning is Geo. In Geo a player identifies a geographic
entity such as a country or sea, and the computer answers with a response that begins with
the last letter of the previous answer. The game continues until either the player or the
computer runs out of possible answers. Unfortunately, the game is badly dated as it does
not include the changes that have taken place since the collapse of Communism. Even more
regrettably, Geo misspells Santa Fe (spelling it as&quot;Sante Fe&quot;). Nevertheless,
despite its problems, Geo can make learning geography fun.

Many of the games are supplied as files which have been compressed using a program
called PKZIP. Therefore, if you intend to run these games on your computer, you must
obtain the PKZIP program or utility. PKZIP is available on a variety of bulletin boards,
including NFB-net. If you haven&apos;t a clue how to begin, find a friend to help you. Also,
there may be a blind NFB member in your area who would be able to help you get started and
even demonstrate the games or play a few with your child.

Computer games can provide an excellent way for your child to become comfortable with
the computer while gaining valuable skills and knowledge at the same time. They also
provide blind children more of an equal opportunity to interact with sighted peers. The
games which require more than one player can be a social outlet for interacting with
sighted peers. Even the solitary games give the blind child a common experience which can
be used as a starting point for making new friends.

Helpful Hints for Parents of Blind Infants and Toddlers

by Christine Faltz

Reprinted from the Summer, 1997, issue of SteppingStone, the newsletter of the Long
Island Chapter of the Parents of Blind Children Division of the NFB.

Editor&apos;s Note: Blind herself, Christine is the mother of a beautiful little girl,
Samantha, who is also legally blind. Christine is a former NFB scholarship winner, and an
attorney who has chosen to stay home to be a full-time mom. Like so many full-time moms,
Christine has taken on other volunteer jobs. She is the president of the NFB Long Island
parent&apos;s chapter and editor of the chapter&apos;s very fine newsletter, SteppingStone. Here is
an example of some of the excellent advice and information Christine shares with her
chapter&apos;s members:

When a blind or visually impaired child is only a few months old, most parents are
still trying to cope with the fears and uncertainties of having a disabled child.
Conflicting information and advice is especially overwhelming at this time. This is often
compounded by the unfortunate attitudes of many in the medical profession and, worse yet,
by those who work with the blind. We have come a long way but, even today, an alarming
number of professionals working with blind children and adults have low expectations for
their clients and such negative attitudes that they act surprised when confronted with
successful, self-sufficient visually impaired men and women.

Despite these attitudes we must remember that our attitudes are the ones which will
affect our children the most. Even in the face of deeply entrenched stereotypes and
professional misinformation and biases, we must hold fast to the idea that if we pay our
dues now, our children will reap priceless benefits in self-esteem, self- advocacy, and
the knowledge that we believe in their individual potential.

Positive attitudes and matter-of-fact adaptation of the world for our blind and
visually impaired children starts at birth. As far as basic needsholding, feeding,
dressing (assuming no medical complications)--there is nothing extra or special that must
be done for the blind infant. There are, however, very simple techniques that can be
employed to give your baby as much information as possible about his or her environment.

When a baby is only a few months old, her ability to hear you does not necessarily mean
your location is known, and she has no way of knowing that you are, perhaps, about to pick
him up or fix her blanket. Before you pick up the child or move something nearby, state
what you are going to do, or at the very least say the child&apos;s name before touching her.
There is no need to handle a blind child more carefully than you would a sighted child;
she is not more fragile and is not predisposed to being extra anxious or fussy. Keep in
mind that for the first few weeks of life, sighted babies are only able to see people and
objects very close to their faces anyway.

When you take your child from room to room, outside to the car, or into the store, to
the extent that you are able to do so under the circumstances (time, who&apos;s with you,
etc.), you should state simply where you are going and what you are doing. Hearing
everyday speech is good for all babies&apos; language development, but the blind child will be
able to use your verbal cues to begin distinguishing, with her other senses, a change in
location. For example, my 20-month-old daughter was able, at about one year, to go to the
kitchen or the bathroom when told to do so. I spent a lot of time telling her:&quot;We&apos;re
going to go into the kitchen so Mommy can clean up. We&apos;re going out of your room,&quot;(putting her hands on the door)&quot;and we&apos;re going straight. Mommy and Daddy&apos;s bedroom,
where we sleep in the bed at night, is on the right. The bathroom, where you have your
bath, is on the left. After the bedroom are the steps going downstairs to outside. Now
here&apos;s the living room, with the television and the stereo. We turn left, and here&apos;s the
kitchen.&quot;

I tried to use the same descriptions as often as possible. When I had the time, I
showed her the furniture in the room, spoke its name and its purpose. Even when very
young, Samantha was very attentive when I spoke, and though she obviously didn&apos;t
understand most of what I was saying in the beginning, repetition eventually led to
absorption and understanding.

An older infant and toddler will often attempt to do what Mommy and Daddy are doing:
fold laundry, clean the table, wash the dishes. When it is safe to do so, I show Samantha
what I am doing and explain:&quot;Mommy is giving the dirty dishes a bath. They have food
on them. Then we&apos;ll dry them with a towel, just like you after your bath.&quot;

Don&apos;t take anything for granted. If your child is curious, show whatever it is safe to
show him. Then, when your attention is desired at an inopportune moment,&quot;One minute,
sweetheart; Mommy&apos;s cleaning the table&quot;will actually have a concrete meaning; it
will not merely be a jumble of words that he has heard but doesn&apos;t understand because he
cannot see what it is you are doing. Eventually, he will put together your location, the
sound of the water on the rag, the sound of the rag on the table, and will know on his own
what you are doing. But until you give meaning to the sounds and smells and textures in
his world, your blind baby cannot learn the function of the objects in his environment. Do
not feel foolish describing every little thing and activity to your baby. It can only help
her.

I personally don&apos;t like playpens, especially for totally blind infants. Put your child
on the floor with some toys; place a noisy toy out of his reach to entice him to move to
find it. This way he can learn that his environment is far more than what he is readily
aware of. When he begins to creep or crawl, show him the boundaries between rooms, the
extent of rooms, how he can move around tables and chairs, but not around walls. Expose
your child to everything: show him the steps, the trees in your yard, the grass. Take him
to the beach and show him the sand, how the water moves, sea shells. Show him the inside
and outside of the car his car seat is in. Show, show, and show some morehands on
whenever possiblewith constant explanations using simple statements. Teach care
providers to do the same. Place toys on accessible shelves and show him where they are in
relation to other objects in the room. As he begins to show understanding of words and
begins to use words to express needs and desires, you will see that these efforts have
paid off. By the time he is walking, your child will know&quot;right&quot;and&quot;left&quot;and will have no trouble moving about familiar surroundings with ease.

A Chance to Belong by Crystal McClain]

Reprinted from Advocacy in Action, a publication of the Ohio NFB Parents Division.

The chance to belong. Isn&apos;t that one thing we want for our kids? Just because our kid
is blind doesn&apos;t mean we erase that natural instinct of wanting them to be a part of
something. As parents of blind children we may be tempted to let&quot;belonging&quot;slip away. Here is one example of how I helped to make sure my daughter Macy did belong.

SEA is a five week program offered to kids in grades K-8 in Logan County. This program
is for two hours on Saturday morning and offers a variety of enrichment courses for the
children. I eagerly signed up my twin kindergartners (Madison&amp;Macy). You might like
to know that Madison is sighted and Macy is blind. Madison chose an animal class and Macy
chose a puppet class where you make puppets and then have a puppet show. Both of the girls
were excited. We got back their admission slips after we sent in the twenty-five dollar
course fee.

Things were going well until I received a phone call saying that because Macy was
visually impaired she would not be permitted to participate unless I provided and paid for
a private assistant. I was very upset. This program was sponsored by the very school
system that Macy attends.

I started to investigate and after six phone calls (including one to Ohio Legal Rights
and one to Eric Duffy, Ohio NFB director of field operations), I got to the source of the
problem. One woman (the director of the program) was responsible for this. She had many
misconceptions about blindness, and she wasn&apos;t about to let go of them. She used class
size and dangerous equipment (glue guns) as an excuse. She said no visually impaired
student would be allowed to participate in any SEA class. I asked her if the other
kindergartners in the class would be using hot glue guns unassisted. (I hope not!)
Finally, when push came to shove, she had me call the Special Education Director, Melinda.

The Special Education Director said that the other woman stated that I was requesting a
paid assistant because I didn&apos;t want to pay for it. Once again I was shocked. I told
Melinda (we&apos;re on a first name basis) that I did not want an assistant. I want Macy to
continue to grow in her independence and that was impossible with a personal aide
continuously at her side. Melinda knows me and said she understood, and that I was to take
Macy to the class on Saturday.

SEA classes are over now and Macy enjoyed hers immensely. She got to be with her
friends from school, make puppets (maybe not the prettiest ones), and perform a puppet
show. The lesson here is that I could have accepted a refund of my twenty-five dollars, or
paid for an aide, or accepted an aide that was paid for me, but I didn&apos;t. I stuck to my
convictions and Macy was able to belong to something (SEA) without hurting her
independence.

The result is worth the battle. How many kids lose out because someone said&quot;No&quot;they couldn&apos;t belongand their parents let it happen. Please
don&apos;t let it happen to your child. Make sure your child participates in school activities,
church, and activities within your community.

Reflections on the Importance of Socialization

for Blind Girls and Women

by Barbara Pierce

Editor&apos;s Note: Barbara Pierce, Editor of the NFB publication, the Braille Monitor, is
also a member of the Committee on the Status of Blind Women, North America/Caribbean
Region, World Blind Union. Mrs. Pierce developed the following document as a framework for
focus group discussions sponsored by this committee, and conducted by Mrs. Pierce, at the
1997 NFB National Convention in July. You will discover that this article complements, and
is in turn enriched by, both the article that precedes it (&quot;A Chance to Belong&quot;)
and the one that follows (&quot;Never Laugh at the Teacher&apos;s Jokes&quot;). Here is what
Mrs. Pierce has to say on the topic of socializtion and women:

This paper has no pretensions to be a scholarly work or even an academic exercise. It
is a jumping-off point for constructive discussions among blind women about the importance
of healthy socialization, the pressures and problems in this area faced by blind girls and
women, and the barriers we face in developing fulfilling relationships. Our hope is to
increase our own understanding of the social and interpersonal skills we lack and our
ability to develop them. We also trust that our insights will assist parents and teachers
of blind girls and young women to help them do this work better than many of us had an
opportunity to do.

We begin by acknowledging that healthy socialization is important to both men and
women, and our exploration of this question from the feminine perspective should not be
seen as denigration of men&apos;s concerns and problems. We are women, and we understand
something of the manifestations of this complex of problems in women&apos;s lives. We leave to
the experts and to blind men the masculine perspective and their own personal insights.

Gather together a group of women whose blindness began at birth or in youth, and you
will find the conversation eventually making its way around to the complex of social
problems: attractiveness to potential romantic partners, fashion sense, social skills,
physical awkwardness, putting people at easethe list is almost endless. The
ramifications of our dissatisfaction with our resolution of these questions extend into
every aspect of social life: jobs, friendship, marriage, even managing the details of
daily life.

The Committee on the Status of Blind Women invites blind women and, if these women
choose, others with an interest in this subject to gather for informal and unstructured
discussion of the issues raised here. We ask that you provide us with a rough summary in
print or Braille of the concerns raised in your group&apos;s conversation and that you pass
along any conclusions or insights the group comes to. We can&apos;t be sure what exact use we
will make of these reports, but we will try to enhance general understanding in the field
and improve the efforts made to help women and girls develop their own skills more
effectively. We also hope that those who take part in these discussions will find their
own understanding and capacity to deal constructively with the social aspect of their
lives improved by this exercise.

Almost before adults are aware of the problem, young blind children are already being
left out of social interactions. If you can&apos;t skip, you can&apos;t play skipping games. If you
can&apos;t bounce a ball or skate or jump rope, you will be left out of those activities. But
how often do older siblings or parents help the blind child master the skills at an
appropriate age or figure out alternatives that will keep her in the group, taking part in
the activity in some way? Using a larger ball, hopping rather than skipping, even (if
necessary) being a permanent turner for jump rope: all these keep the blind child a part
of the group. Another strategy is to invite a group of playmates to the blind child&apos;s yard
to play and then offer refreshments whenever they gather there. One family installed a
trampoline in the backyard as a neighborhood attraction. If the play equipment is fun, not
only will other children want to play, but the blind child will be encouraged to learn to
move and take part.

As girls grow older, the importance of peer interaction becomes more marked. Feedback
from peers can have a powerful deterrent affect on socially unacceptable behavior. Left to
themselves, playmates will ask about unusual eye movement or appearance, rocking,
eye-pressing, failure to face the speaker, or poor management of food. A child can be
helped to develop good explanations of lazy eye muscles or nystagmus. The social pressure
of curiosity and implied criticism can serve as a powerful curb to poor habits, assuming
that the blind child has intelligent support in training new and better ones.

But all this assumes that the blind child has peer interactions with sighted children
or, even better, sighted friends. Sometimes parents don&apos;t notice that their mainstreamed
blind children have no friends at school and are staying to themselves in class and on the
playground. A father who was deeply worried about his eight-year-old daughter&apos;s compulsive
and increasing eye-pressing complained to one of us that he and his wife and their
daughter&apos;s friends fussed at her continually about this habit, but she was unwilling to
exert herself to stop the behavior. Intrigued by the report that friends were part of this
effort to modify the behavior, the blind woman questioned him closely about who the
friends were and what they were saying. The friends turned out to be an older neighbor
couple concerned about the child. When asked about friends at school, the father
discovered, when he thought about it, that to his surprise his daughter had no friends of
her own age. He had never noticed that she went to no birthday parties and no one ever
came to her house to play. She didn&apos;t even speak about other kids and their activities at
recess.

Such anecdotes suggest the importance of concentrated efforts to help young children
form real friendships at an early age. It may well be even more important for blind
children than for sighted to learn early the first rules of successful social intercourse:
don&apos;t bite; share your toys; engage in appropriate conversation, do not echo or use
imitative speech patterns; give other people a chance to talk; don&apos;t rock; look at the
speaker; etc. Working on these and similar points of acceptable conduct will improve the
chances that the child will make friends. And friends will reinforce the lessons teachers
and parents are trying to teach.

As blind girls approach adolescence, the social problems they face multiply and become
more complex, and a solid foundation of social skills established in childhood becomes
ever more important. The girl who cannot flip through Seventeen or clothing catalogues,
observe what girls her age are wearing, or take note of clothing in the stores is at a
disadvantage in dressing so as to fit in with her peers. At this age the wrong socks or
shoes, the shirt tucked or untucked inappropriately, the jeans too new or too full of
holes can and do often lead to social ostracism. Flattering and up-to-date hair styles,
appropriate and skillfully applied make-up when the time comes, and recognition of
attractive body contours can be equally mysterious to a young blind girl who has no one to
help her fill these important gaps in her knowledge. If they are part of the picture,
friends can be more useful here than adults. If there are none, the gaps in the girl&apos;s
information will only widen, and the schism between her and the girls she would like to
make friends with will broaden.

In this case, immediate first aid is called for. In small-group or individual
discussions with a knowledgeable and understanding adult, blind girls must learn the
importance of the information they are lacking, and then the deficit must be made up. They
must then learn to assume the responsibility for gathering such information for themselves
in the future. A mother might take her blind daughter and a couple of other girls her age
on a shopping expedition and to a movie they all want to see. Both mother and daughter can
learn from the other girls what is in and out this year. Clerks in teen departments can
sometimes point out what is popular. Young girls can be encouraged to investigate the
clothes on store mannequins. This will teach them, not only what this year&apos;s fashions look
like, but what the ideal teen body looks like as well.

Early on, someone must sit down with a blind teen and honestly discuss the grooming and
cleanliness facts of life. Other students will notice very soon if an adolescent who
should be bathing and washing her hair daily is not doing so. It will also spare her
inevitable mortification if someone shows her proper and effective ways to prepare for and
handle menstruation.

Most of us who attended regular high schools noticed early in our teens that boys were
unlikely to be interested in anyone who was as different from their ideal as a blind girl
necessarily is. The more physically attractive and socially skilled a blind young woman
is, the more likely she is to gather experience with boys, though most blind women of our
acquaintance say that they have always found difficulty in getting sighted men of any age
to take them seriously as potential partners. Eager for normal relationships, blind women
with little experience are frequently vulnerable to unscrupulous men. Afraid to say no and
risk rejection, young blind women have often allowed themselves to be drawn into greater
physical intimacy than they wanted. We know of no fool-proof way of protecting blind women
from this danger. But discussing fears, uncertainties, and areas of ignorance provides a
place to begin. Knowing blind women who have successfully dated and married should also be
of some reassurance to teens who are feeling like the village outcast.

Important in their own right as the foregoing issues and problems are, the solutions
individual women settle on for themselves also combine to form the matrix of their
personal, social, and work lives as adults. The capacity easily and appropriately to make
conversation, business contacts, friends, and intimate relationships is at the heart of
existence as a member of a social community. For blind women as for everyone else,
mastering these individual skills in youth makes using them easier in adulthood, but the
skills can often be mastered in adulthood if the individual is serious about doing so and
willing to work hard. The purpose of this paper is not to guide such an exploration but to
point to important areas of social interaction with which our experience suggests that
blind women sometimes have problems. Resolving individual difficulties in them must be a
personal or small-group activity demanding honesty, compassion, and patience.

Listening attentively to others and drawing them out on subjects that they find
interesting are skills that some blind women have had little practice in developing.
Throughout their lives people have talked to them about blindness and how they do and
perceive things. Unfortunately this usually happens because people assume that blind
people have little else to contribute in any conversation, so they restrict talk to things
they are sure the blind person knows something about. There is an art to making others
believe that one finds their views and interests fascinating, and those who have mastered
it are usually known as good conversationalists.

The problem of finding and keeping a good job is many-faceted, but there is a social
component to it. One must have an accurate and unromanticized notion of what is required
by an employer of any employee holding the job, and one must meet or preferably exceed
those requirements. This is difficult when all one&apos;s life parents, teachers, and fellow
students have been making allowances because of one&apos;s visual impairment. But employers
need results, and charity will not and should not be part of the equation. We are not all
geniuses, but we can exert ourselves and demonstrate willingness to work as hard as
necessary to master the job and work competitively. If we can&apos;t achieve these goals, we
should not be surprised or disappointed when we find it hard to get paid for our work.

Social interaction with work colleagues is another important

area of work life in which blind women sometimes have problems. Co-

workers almost always begin by assuming that they will have to look

out for the blind worker and make allowances for her. The best

defense against such assumptions is an aggressive offense: hard

work, clarity about where and when blindness is a factor, and

spirited and independent participation in the social component of

the job. Remembering birthdays, bringing coffee-break treats,

asking about sick relatives, doing favors for colleaguesthese and

a thousand other marks of thoughtfulness and social sensitivity can draw one into the
group.

In order to develop a corps of friends beyond the workplace, blind women must find ways
of meeting people in situations where there is a social component to the interactions:
religious organizations, volunteer projects, adult classes, musical groups, etc. Doing so
is not always easy because of physical or logistical barriers to getting there, but the
simple fact is that one can&apos;t make friends without meeting people in circumstances in
which friendship can grow.

To build healthy, mutually satisfying personal relationships of all kinds, one must
invest time and genuine interest in the other person and in shared activities, and the
other party must be willing to do the same. Because too often blind women have had little
opportunity to form and grow in healthy friendships and physical relationships, they can
be easy victims. If one devalues one&apos;s self and places disproportionate value on the
affection and attention of a friend or lover, one is already a good way toward
victim-hood. The best defense is a strong sense of self-worth and the conviction that the
overly demanding person is not the only fish in the sea. Unfortunately, both of these
attitudes are developed over a long period of making and keeping good friends. One can&apos;t
graft such a personal history into one&apos;s adult personality, but one can begin nurturing
such relationships. Sexual exploitation is not the only basis for intimate relationships.
Real friendships cannot be made or kept by letting others walk all over one physically,
psychologically, or spiritually. But learning to stand up for oneself after years of
passivity is difficult without the support of friends, family, or therapist.

The intent of this paper has not been to solve problems but to enable blind women to
explore them and move toward their own solutions. Understanding the terrain better may
make it easier to plot a course through it. We can also hope that deeper understanding of
the special social problems facing blind women will enable us all to assist blind girls
and young women to form healthy and socially acceptable habits of body and mind so that
they will be better equipped than many of us have been to meet the demands of adult life
and to be nurtured and fulfilled in their social relationships at every level.

Never Laugh at the Teacher&apos;s Jokes

by Srikala Ashok

Editor&apos;s Note: Srikala Ashok, a teacher of blind children, was asked to do a
presentation to the 1996 National Federation of the Blind of Illinois Convention Parents&apos;
Seminar on the topic of socialization of blind children. The presentation was so well done
and so well received that Debbie Stein, a long leader of the NFB of Illinois, encouraged
her to submit her remarks to Future Reflections for publication. She did, and here,
preceded by an introducation by Debbie Stein, is what she submitted:

Introductory Remarks by

Debbie Stein

Kala Ashok is a teacher of blind children with the SEDOM Co-op program based in
Woodstock, Illinois. She grew up in Madras, India, where she taught children with cerebral
palsy for several years before coming to the United States. At Western Michigan University
she earned a master&apos;s degree in teaching blind children. She has taught
multiply-handicapped blind children in Louisiana, and since 1993 has been at SEDOM working
with children from infancy through junior high level.

Kala got in touch with us about a year ago because she was looking for blind adults who
could talk to some of her students about their careers. I said to her,&quot;In the ten
years that I&apos;ve been involved with the Federation, this is the first time a teacher of
blind kids has ever come to us and said, `I&apos;d like my kids to get to know some blind
adults.&apos;&quot;She was amazed. She said,&quot;How come people aren&apos;t doing it more?&quot;and I said,&quot;That&apos;s a really good question.&quot;That began an ongoing dialogue
about this and many other topics. I think she has some very important and interesting
thoughts to share. Here is Kala:

KALA ASHOKWhen I was asked to come and speak to you I gave many reasons why I
would be a bad choice. I was excited, but I felt unsure about my professional expertise. I
was unsure whether I was the right person to do this, whether I know enough. I don&apos;t think
I do know enough. I&apos;m constantly learning. I don&apos;t have all the answersso if I say
something off the wall you&apos;ll know who to throw your eggs at. (Laughter)

When we hear a child&apos;s behavior being addressed in school, it&apos;s usually because that
behavior is negative in some way. It&apos;s mouthing behavior, acting-out
behaviorsomething that has a negative impact on other kids. If it&apos;s not an obviously
negative behavior it&apos;s less a cause for alarm. But what alarms me about my students who
are blind is not so much negative behavior, as a need for positive social behaviors.
Because this is not something that has a negative impact on other people, it fails to get
the attention it deserves. Actually it is having a very strong negative impact on someone,
and that person is my blind student.

When blind kids are placed in a regular school setting, you might think that they are
constantly in a situation where they can pick up the social skills they need. That&apos;s a
logical assumption to make, but it doesn&apos;t always happen. Just putting a kid into a
situation does not assure that socialization will occur. It works well for some kids; they
can make the system work for them. I&apos;m more concerned with the kids who may be shy, who
may not have the ability to initiate social interaction. For those kids we really need to
intervene. We need to plan ways to assist them.

As an itinerant teacher I know there is very real academic pressure in school,
especially in the middle and upper grades. All of usclassroom teachers, itinerants,
parents, and studentsare concerned about assignments, tests, and making sure that
all the necessary materials are in Braille. Everyone&apos;s caught up in this effort to make
certain that the student&apos;s grades don&apos;t suffer for any reason. We&apos;re right to be
concerned. But in the whole process something else gets bumped down on the priorities
list, and that&apos;s social skills. That&apos;s why we all need to come together as a team
sometimes. We have to provide these kids with experiences that will help them get the
social skills they need.

It&apos;s very important for us to be tuned into the world of the sighted peers of our blind
children. We need to know what makes them laugh, what interests them, what makes them
angry, what kinds of things they jeer at. We need to know everything about their world.
Only then can I, as a teacher, give appropriate feedback to my students about social
skills.

I rely a great deal on classroom teachers. They see a lot of behaviors which, as an
itinerant teacher, I may not pick up on. One junior high classroom teacher told me this:
it&apos;s not considered cool to laugh at a teacher&apos;s jokes. After she pointed this out I
observed and found it was really true. The kids would look at each other, or look away, or
appear completely uninterested, but they would never laugh at the teacher&apos;s joke, no
matter how funny it was!

My student, a charming young lady with impeccable manners, would laugh out loud. She
thought that it was perfectly appropriate to laugh. But in the world of that classroom,
she was setting herself further apart than she already was. It&apos;s not that she did anything
wrong. But by laughing when the others did not, she heightened the difference that already
existed between her and the rest of the class. That&apos;s why I think it&apos;s so important for us
to be aware of the world of the sighted peers of our kids.

Sometimes simple arrangements in the classroom will seriously hamper a blind child&apos;s
interactions. It amazes me how conditioned a lot of us are to think that the best seat for
a student who is blind is right near the door. After all, she has her big heavy Brailler,
and all these large books to pick out and put back, and she has to get in and out of the
classroom quickly because there&apos;s only so much time for passing between periods. The other
place which is considered appropriate for kids who are blind is near the shelves in the
back of the room, where all those fifteen million volumes of every textbook can be stored.
That way she has easy access to them and a way to store all her other equipment.

These are all very legitimate reasons which can&apos;t be disputed. But if you think about
it, those are the worst places for social interaction. When you&apos;re seated near the door or
in the far back, you tend to be away from the group. You&apos;re more easily left out of what&apos;s
going on. When there are fewer people talking around you, there is less chance for you to
be drawn into conversation.

I like to see my students right in the middle, in the thick of everything. There they
have more people around them and have more opportunities to engage in conversations.
There&apos;s more of a chance for teachers and other kids to call on them. Yes, those issues of
time and storage are important. But if social skills are a priority, they need to be given
status as such. We need to make socialization a priority and work around these other
issues. It calls for additional time management and planning, but it can still be done
within that context. Maybe you don&apos;t have to do it in every classroom. It may not work
with every teacher. But if there are situations where it can work, it needs to be stressed
as an important priority for the student.

I find social workers to be very helpful within the school. They come up with some
great ideas on how to encourage social interaction in the classroom. Besides the
inevitable group projects and work with partners, they have other suggestions too. One
thing we have tried is the&quot;circle of friends.&quot;A student identifies other kids
in the building with whom he or she has had positive interaction. These kids can form a
little club, a circle within the school where they do things for each other and look out
for one another. They can do things outside of school too. It&apos;s so important to carry over
the interaction from school to the outside.

Let me explain why I think this is so important. If you think about the pace of the
school scheduleand this is especially true in the higher gradesthere is very
little time for chit-chat with friends. Classroom teachers have told me directly that
they&apos;re not there to encourage kids to talk to each other. They want them to come in, do
their work, get out, and go to the next class. In fact, where you see most of the
interaction is out in the hallways during passing periods. The hallway is noisy and
bustling. It&apos;s where the latest gossip is all being shared. The kids are shouting over
people&apos;s heads or from one end of the hallway to the other. They may just exchange a
smile, they may thump somebody on the back, but that&apos;s where the interaction is taking
placeduring that three- or four-minute passing time.

At that time, my student is busy gathering her stuff. She&apos;s putting her books into her
bag, getting her Brailler, and maneuvering through those very crowded hallways to the next
classroom, which could be way down at the other end. She&apos;s getting there, taking out her
Brailler, and rolling in a piece of paper to be ready for the next teacher. Kids have a
very rigorous schedule, and sometimes I think they don&apos;t even realize they&apos;re missing out
on those friendship moments.

One of my students had never told me that she missed having friends, that she missed
having someone to share things with. After a lot of prodding she finally said one day,&quot;Mrs. Ashok, nobody talks to me on the school bus.&quot;The bus would be the perfect
place for making friends. You&apos;re not worried about getting somewhere on time, you&apos;re not
thinking about the teacher&apos;s directionsyou&apos;re sitting on the bus going home. What
could be more relaxing? It&apos;s the kind of pressure-free time that we want to provide for
our kids, where they can have a chance to get to know their sighted peers better. It&apos;s an
opportunity for them to get to know their interests and to share their own interests too.
But my student didn&apos;t know how to make use of this opportunity that she had every day.

You know your kids best. Some are less inhibited, are able to take risks and initiate
social interaction. But other kids are not, and those are the ones that I&apos;m really
concerned about.

I want to digress a little bit and talk about something that makes this whole
discussion so personal for me. I think perhaps it helps me understand the needs of my
students a little better. In many ways I perceive people with visual disabilities as
expressing a different kind of culture. There is a difference in the manner in which they
do some things, and the unique perspective because of that difference represents another
culture.

I grew up in a culture that is vastly different from the one I find myself in every
day. There&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned after many, many years. I&apos;ve fought it, I have
resented it, and finally learned to accept it. If I want to integrate socially in this
dominant culture, the responsibility for doing so lies entirely with me and with nobody
else. I have to push myself into this dominant world. I cannot wait to be pulled in. That
for me is always the hardest challenge. I see it paralleled in the lives of my students.
They need to push themselves into this dominant sighted world. They cannot wait to be
drawn in. It will not happen unless they make it happen themselves. They have to initiate.

To initiate means participating in a discussion without being called on to do so. It
means asking a question and not merely providing answers to questions that you are asked.
It means offering opinions or suggestions. It means asking for assistance and offering
assistance. All of that is social initiative. It&apos;s so important for us to provide
opportunities for kids to take these steps when they&apos;re young. We can&apos;t wait until they&apos;re
thirty-something and can start to figure it out on their own. We must facilitate
experiences with their sighted peers at a very early age, and continue to do so as they
grow up. By doing so you are in a sense creating and recreating the real world. That world
is made up of both sighted and blind people. Learning to interact within that world must
become a very normal process.

At my age, I constantly have to give myself reasons for pushing myself into the world.
My job is on the line. I need to be perceived as competent. A big part of my job is
consultingtalk about social skills there! Because my job is on the line, I must take
the initiative. I push myself to do it.

When you make interaction a priority for your children at an early age, it becomes a
natural way of dealing with the world. You don&apos;t have to list reasons for them as to why
they should do it. It&apos;s just part of life.

Right along with this is the idea of networking with kids and adults who are blind. Our
experiences as we go through childhood and adolescence will ultimately determine our
self-image as adults. The fact that my blind student is considered atypical by this&quot;typical&quot;world is going to be a large part of her experience. Connecting to and
maintaining connections with other people who are blind will strengthen her self-image in
two ways. First, it will help her understand that being different, atypical, is an
integral part of who she is. Secondly, it will allow her to see this difference not as a
bad thing, but as something fruitful, productive, socially rewarding, and empowering. We
need to give our kids the chance to develop a positive self-image.

I want to thank the Federation for giving me this opportunity to share my thoughts.
They are my thoughts, they&apos;re not anything else. I learn a lot from my students. They&apos;re
my best teachers. (Applause)

Question From Cathy RandallHas your student found ways to interact between
classes? Has she made friends on the bus? KalaIt would be easy for me to say yes,
she has. But I think it&apos;s really an ongoing process. It&apos;s not going to happen in a month
or even a year. I would like to think I started that process with her, that I&apos;ve made her
aware of what she needs and how much she could enjoy it. She&apos;s in high school now, and I&apos;m
hoping to continue the circle of friends we started. It opened up a world for her. It&apos;s
too soon to say she took complete advantage of that opportunity. She needs more time. I
think she needs input from all of us, from teachers and parents continuously. Has she
found it? No, not yet, but I think she&apos;s working and trying, and her parents are still
trying, too.

Active Learning Conference

From the Editor: About four years ago I attended an Active Learning Conference
conducted by Dr. Lilli Nielsen. Active Learning is both a method and a philosophy about
promoting learning in multi-disabled, blind children (it works for children who are&quot;just&quot;blind, too). It was among the most useful conferences I&apos;ve ever attended
as a professional or as a parent. I highly recommend it to parents, teachers, therapists,
or any care giver or service provider of children who have visual, physical, or mental
disabilities. Here is an announcement about an upcoming Active Learning Conference in
March:

Penrickton Center for Blind Children Presents:

Dr. Lilli Nielsen

A Conference for Active Learning, March 2, 3, 4, 1998, Holiday Inn-Southgate, Southgate
Michigan.

For registration information contact the Penrickton Center for Blind Children,
telephone (313) 946-7500, fax (313) 946-6707. Registration fee is $150 if paid by February
6, 1998, and $175 after that date.

Schedule:

* MondayActive Learning vs. Passive Learning: Many children with multiple
impairments wait for adults to provide stimulation. Therefore, they become passive. An
overview of Active Learning techniques will be presented emphasizing simple ways to change
the environment so that a child becomes an&quot;active learner.&quot;

* TuesdayPerceptual Aides that Promote Active Learning: Dr.

Nielsen has developed specific equipment such as the Little Room, The Resonance Board,
Support Bench, Essef Board, and more. The benefits of this equipment will be explained and
demonstrated. Dr. Nielsen will demonstrate her Active Learning techniques with a blind
multi-disabled child.

* WednesdayIdentifying Where To Begin: Discovering the emotional level of a child
to develop a starting point in Active Learning. Dr. Nielsen will explain how to utilize
Active Learning to promote the development of oral motor skills, which will further
enhance a child&apos;s feeding and communication skills. The relationships of Active Learning
to the development of a child&apos;s independence in self-care skills will also be discussed.

About the Presenter: Dr. Lilli Nielsen is employed as special education advisor at
Refsnaesskolen, the National Institute for Blind and Partially Sighted Children and Youth
in Denmark. Trained as a preschool teacher and as a psychologist, Dr. Nielsen has worked
with handicapped children for over 37 years, the last 30 years with blind and visually
impaired children (birth to 21 years of age) with and without other disabilities. Dr.
Nielsen has written numerous books and lectures around the world regarding the Active
Learning approach she developed. She also designed equipment to provide an optimal
environment for active learning to take place.

Home-made Wikki-Stix

The following information comes from the May, 1997, POBC News and Views, the newsletter
of the Parents of Blind Children Division of the NFB of Colorado:

Wikki Stixare colorful waxy strings available at toy and crafts stores which
have been a favorite creative toy for children for many years. A little like pipe cleaners
in that they are bendable, Wikki Stixhave the advantage of being able to stick to
each other or to objects. Here is a recipe for making your own Wikki Stix-like
product. (Attributed to Nancy Getten of the Montana School for the Blind.)

Materials:

One large empty coffee can

Paraffin wax

Toilet Sealant (available at hardware stores)

Crayons (optional)

String

Wax paper

Process:

Put equal amounts of paraffin wax and toilet sealant in the coffee can. Place can in a
pot of warm water and heat until wax is melted. Stir in crayon shavings, if desired, to
color. When all is melted and mixed, dip pieces of string in the mixture and lay out to
dry on wax paper. Keep the wax warm as you work or it will harden. Once the strings have
cooled, you can bend, shape and reuse as you would the commercial Wikki Stix.

Blind Runner Makes History

The following news article appeared in the May/June, 1997, issue of The Palmetto Blind,
the newsletter of the National Federation of the Blind of South Carolina. The information
came from a press release from SCSDB.

South Carolina School for the Deaf and Blind&apos;s (SCSDB)

Sonya Bell Makes History in State Track Meet For the first time in U.S. history, a
totally blind runner participated in a state track and field championship. The SCSDB
girls&apos; 1,600 relay team, led by star athlete Sonya Bell, finished sixth in the S.C. State
Championships on May 15, 1997. For this accomplishment, Sonya and her teammates each
received resolutions from the S.C. Senate and the S. C. House of Representatives in May.

Sonya Bell, 16, of Chester has won national medals in gymnastics, ice skating, and
track and field. She received the 1994 national ARETE Award for Courage in Sports and has
been featured by the CBS Evening News, ESPN, FX Network, SC-ETV, Sports Illustrated and
Jet Magazine.

She set a national record for a totally blind runner in the 400 meter run with a time
of 67.1 seconds at the Spartanburg County Track and Field Championship in April. In 1996,
Sonya was chosen to be a member of the 1,600 meter relay team to demonstrate Paralympic
events during the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta.
