Celebs Eat Fast Food, Too!

Just a little Friday Fun for you guys.  If you have to hit the road this weekend and eat a little fast food in pursuit of a fabulous Memorial Day destination, just remember, celebs eat fast food, too!

 “Speidi” (Spencer Pratt + Heidi Montag) were spotted enjoying a little fiesta at Taco Bell.

A Fresco Crunchy Taco from Taco Bell contains only 150 calories!  In fact, there whole Fresco selection is pretty low cal.  Check out their nutrition info here .

 Lindsay Lohan is well-known for her fast food habit.  Seen here eating a pretzel from Wetzel’s Pretzels, it looks like she is washing it all down with a soda, too!

Nutrtion information couldn’t be found for Wetzel’s Pretzels, however, the average soft pretzel is about 300 calories.

 Ben Affleck is guilty of driving under the influence, of McDonald’s, that is!

As I have been guilty of the same, I recognize that baby to be a Big Mac.  According to McDonald’s nutrition info , that clocks in a 540 calories.

 Paris Hilton makes a lighter choice with a frozen yogurt dessert at Yogen Fruz.

Paris’ treat looks to be berry-flavored, which must be seasonal since it’s not currently listed on the nutrition menu .  A small low-fat vanilla at Yogen Fruz is just over 120 calories.

And just to make you smile, here’s a photo of Heidi Klum biting into a burger.

I have no idea where the burger is from, or how many calories are in it.  I just think it’s nice to see that supermodels eat fast food, too!
 
 Question of the Day 

 What is your fast-food restaurant of choice?  “I don’t eat fast food” doesn’t count!  I think everyone knows what mine is !

 Heather Eats Almond Butter May 28, 2010 at 2:25 pm 
Okay, if I had to stop somewhere, it would probably be Subway, but honestly an Arby’s Beef N Cheddar will always hold a special place in my heart…along with an order of curly fries and a mocha shake. It’s probably been about 10 years since I’ve eaten there, but I still dream about the Horsey sauce.

I’m a Subway fan too. Does pizza count as fast food? That’s usually what I get.

I love reading those rag magazines with celebs eating junk food and looking horrible in bikinis. It’s just so humorous! Wow they’re human like us!

Hmm, good question! I don’t know if pizza counts as“fast”food. My vote would be yes, but I guess it depends on the kind of pizza you get. I have had some very gourmet pizzas that definitely would not count!

What a fun Friday post! Still haven’t gotten that In-N-Out burger… 
 Reply Meghan@traveleatlove May 28, 2010 at 2:27 pm 
I love Subway veggie delight subs and Baja Fresh burritos. Heather, you can buy horsey sauce on its own, outside of Arby’s. So good on crackers!

I’ve never heard of or tried this horsey sauce that you and Heather speak of! What does it taste like? Horseradish?

I havent eaten a burger since like Sept 2009 when I first decided to go on a low carb diet, which has lasted months hehe. I honestly dont miss burgers.. it’s probably the buns I dont miss (too much bread for me).

But it sure is nice to see celebs eating fast food even though it’s not healthy at all! ;-P

I dont think I have a favorite fast food restaurant at this point in my life, I’m not a big fan of them anymore.. but one thing I do like is that Carl’s Jr gives you the option of making any of their burgers into lettuce wraps (just like protein burger at In’n&apos;out). Their low carb bbq chicken sandwich is only 180 cal&amp;4.5 grams of fat, I’ve tried it once and it’s pretty tasty too!

I did not know that Carl’s Jr. offered that option! Great to know, thanks for sharing!

i’d def have to say that my favs fast food is subway! does that count??? or dunkin donuts! i’m a sucker for their egg white flatbreads 
 Reply Tamara May 28, 2010 at 5:24 pm 
When we are in a bind on the road, we usually turn to Arby’s, though it’s not so much my favorite as the boyfriend’s, and we default to his choice because I don’t like any fast food restaurants in particular. Even Subway seems like a waste of money because the bread is under-baked and flavorless and I’m always hungry a half hour after eating. Truth be told, I’d prefer to stop at a supermarket and get something from the deli…then the nutrition information is written on the package!

this is a great post! love it! my favorite has to be chipotle. yum.
 Reply Michelle May 29, 2010 at 6:53 am 
Our biggest fast-food haunts are Subway, In and Out and Baja Fresh. I have to admit, I am have been hitting up McD’s nearly every day for a large iced coffee (no cream or syrup). I add my own cream at home and sip it throughout the afternoon. If my girls are with me, they have apple slices (no caramel) or a child’s soft-serve ice cream.

In and Out Burger!!!
 Reply Bekah May 29, 2010 at 8:30 pm 
subway, chipotle, yes and yes. i don’t even consider those to be necessarily“fast”food though. i honestly really stray away solely because of the way it makes me feel afterward, not good. i don’t even crave that kind of food. but then again, i never really grew up on fast food either. fun post though lara!
 Reply Amy July 14, 2010 at 7:26 pm 
LOVE the photo of Heidi Klum with the burger. Love it.
 Reply Caroline July 21, 2010 at 12:53 pm 
Very late comment–but Heidi Klum endorses for McDonalds here in Germany. She’s not actually eating the burger…it’s just an ad.

 Thought this was a fun read: In defense of PF Chang&apos;s. http://t.co/CfMeDkGL 2011-10-14 Deal Alert! @ Starbucks is offering any breakfast sandwich for $2 when you buy any beverage, now through October 10! http://t.co/v5BjylUV 2011-10-05 I love the way the UK labels their packaged foods!&quot;No mayonnaise,&quot;&quot;Suitable for vegetarians,&quot;etc, plus a stoplight-color system for cals. 2011-09-27 Lara is taking a personal trip to the UK this week. Anyone know if there is restaurant calorie disclosure there yet? 2011-09-20 It&apos;s true! RT @ FoodCALC : We know Detective Lara can&apos;t WAIT to try Chipotle&apos;s new Asian Kitchen concept! http://t.co/VjNtrPe0 2011-09-15 More updates...
