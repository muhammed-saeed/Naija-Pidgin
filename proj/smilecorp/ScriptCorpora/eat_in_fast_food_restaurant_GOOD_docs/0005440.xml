 The strange reason diet soda makes you fat

Calorie-free sweetness may confuse the brain into craving more sugar, research suggests.
 
Want one reason for your beer belly? How about 100 quintillion? That&apos;s about how many bacteria live in your gut. And scientists now believe these bacteria can have a significant impact on your weight.

Consuming high amounts of fructose (a type of sugar), artificial sweeteners, and sugar alcohols (another type of low-calorie sweetener) cause your gut bacteria to adapt in a way that interferes with your satiety signals and metabolism, according to a new paper in Obesity Reviews. (If you&apos;ve noticed you&apos;ve been feeling tired all the time and gaining weight, your metabolism may be slowing.) 

&quot;An evolution of the gut flora to this new sweetener-rich environment has a potential to negatively impact our health,&quot; says Amanda Payne, Ph.D., lead author of the review.

How does that happen? As bacteria in the gut process food, they give off byproducts called short-chain fatty acids. These can be beneficial and serve as energy in the body. But as the sweetener-adapted bacteria thrive and become more efficient at processing large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, and sugar alcohols, they also produce more and more short-chain fatty acids. (Not to imply that sugar is any better than artificial sweeteners. Check out the 20 most sugar-packed foods in America .)

In those high amounts, Payne says, short-chain fatty acids decrease satiety signals. &quot;This signaling may cause disruptions in our feeling full and hence prevent us from stopping to eat when we should,&quot; Payne says.

As if overeating isn&apos;t enough, the short-chain fatty acids also promote inflammation in the lining of the gut. Just how? Scientists aren&apos;t yet sure. But they do know that inflammation damages gut tissue and results in leaky gut syndrome. Pleasant as it sounds, it means bacteria leak through that damaged gut tissue into the blood stream and cause further inflammation there. That&apos;s a serious problem that can lead to insulin resistance and an increased risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

This could partly explain the link researchers have found between drinking diet soda and being overweight. In one study, people who drank two or more diet sodas a day had five times the increase in waist circumference over a 10-year period compared to people who didn&apos;t drink any diet soda. There are a few explanations for the findings. Maybe people drink more diet soda because they&apos;re trying to lose weight. Calorie-free sweetness may also confuse the brain into craving more sugar.

As for your gut, at this point it&apos;s not clear if one diet soda a day is less damaging to the gut flora than ten. &quot;I will say from a personal perspective that I don&apos;t drink sodas--diet or regular--and I rarely eat processed foods, especially if they have high-fructose corn syrup listed on their label,&quot; Payne says. Your best bet is to consume products containing these sweeteners in moderation, and drink mostly water. For gut flora to thrive, eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
 
A new study indicated that diet soda drinkers are more likely to suffer from vascular complications. NBC&apos;s chief medical editor Dr. Nancy Snyderman discusses the dangers these drinks may be hiding.

 Weight loss depends on when we eat, not just what

A healthy breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it&apos;s best to eat within one hour of rising.
 
By Natasha Turner
 Women&apos;s Health 

Certainly what we eat has an enormous impact on our health and weight status. But did you know that when and how we eat also makes a huge difference? Eating at the appropriate times throughout the day will help to maximize fat burning and keep hunger at bay.

 Aim to eat every 3 to 4 hours. Most people eat three meals and one snack, while others may prefer four smaller meals; you&apos;re free to find the combination that works best for you. Timing your meals in this way will improve your fat loss by preventing excess insulin, allowing leptin to work its magic on appetite control and metabolism, and by balancing the stress hormone cortisol. You should also enjoy your meals at the same time every day.

 Eat within one hour of rising. Your mom was also right when she told you breakfast was the most important meal of the day. When you skip breakfast, you lose its stimulating benefits on your metabolic rate. You also become more likely to eat unbalanced meals, more calories, and larger amounts of saturated fat throughout the day. Plenty of research shows that those of us who skip breakfast are actually heavier. Missing out on a healthy morning meal also increases stress hormones.

 Never eat within three hours of bedtime. Eating too close to bedtime raises your body temperature, increases blood sugar and insulin, prevents the release of melatonin, and cuts down on growth hormone release. All these factors interfere with the quality of your sleep and the natural fat-burning benefits of a good night&apos;s rest. Furthermore, sleep deprivation leads to more cravings and a greater likelihood of overeating the next day.

Related: Is Your Sleep Schedule Making You Fat? 

If you must eat before bed, opt for a light meal or snack that&apos;s high in protein and low in carbohydrates and fat, such as a protein shake made with berries and water, salad with grilled chicken, or a shrimp and veggie stir-fry.

 Start the day with protein. For better appetite control throughout the day, try combining your starchy carbs at lunch, dinner, or after your workouts rather than at breakfast. Stick to eggs or whey protein smoothies for breakfast and you&apos;ll eat less throughout the day.

 Always eat within 45 minutes of finishing your workout. This meal or snack is the only one of the day that should not contain much fat and should be higher in carbohydrates. For example, have a smoothie made with juice, fruit, and protein powder, but no flaxseeds or oil.

 Never do your weight training on an empty stomach. You will need energy from your foods to perform optimally. You may, however, complete your cardio before eating if your session will be less than 30 minutes.

Related: Weight Loss Tricks That Really Work 

 Focus on your food . Do not eat while you are doing anything else (i.e., watching TV, working, surfing on the computer, etc.). Focus on chewing your food and relaxing while you eat.

 Eat protein first . Eat the protein on your plate first to help speed the signal to your brain that you are full.

 Drink alcohol last. If you have alcohol or wine, do so after your meal to enhance the hormones involved in appetite control and digestion.

 Low-fat, low-carb, or low-glycemic? Study shows which is best to keep weight off 
 By Joy Bauer, TODAY nutrition expert 
Cutting-edge research from Boston Children’s Hospital suggests that the type of diet you eat may affect your metabolism , a finding that has important implications for weight maintenance. Published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this week, the study looked at three popular diets (low-carb, low-glycemic, and low-fat) to see which combination of fat, carbs, and protein was the best for people trying to maintain a previous weight loss.

Low-glycemic carbs like beans, lentils, and non-starchy vegetables take a long time for the body to absorb and appear to be more effective at satisfying hunger.
 
Because decreases in metabolism can contribute to weight regain, the researchers aimed to see which eating plan worked best with the body’s internal mechanisms to rev up dieters’calorie burn and help them keep the weight off.

The low-glycemic diet emerged as the top-performing plan, giving people a significant metabolic boost without causing undesirable side effects. Participants burned approximately 125 more calories per day while following the low-glycemic plan compared to when eating a low-fat diet. While the low-carb diet had an even better effect on metabolism than the low-glycemic plan, the low-carb diet also produced the highest levels of cortisol (a stress hormone) and CRP (a marker of inflammation). These factors may raise the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes.

The low-glycemic diet offered a happy medium. It helped stabilize blood sugar and metabolism, and also had a beneficial impact on inflammation, stress hormones, and other heart-health markers.

A low-glycemic diet focuses on choosing the right types of carbohydrates that keep us feeling fuller for longer. High-glycemic carbs like white bread, white rice, potatoes and sugary baked goods are digested quickly and cause a dramatic spike in blood sugar, leaving the body hungry and less satisfied. On the other hand, lower-glycemic carbs like beans, lentils, and non-starchy vegetables take a long time for the body to absorb and appear to be more effective at satisfying hunger, leading you to eat less and potentially lose weight. A low-glycemic diet includes moderate amounts of fiber-rich beans, lentils, non-starchy vegetables, fruit and whole grains, as well as lean proteins (fish, skinless poultry, whole soy) and healthy fats (nuts, seeds, avocado, vegetables oils).

A typical breakfast for the participants adhering to the low-glycemic index diet consisted of a scrambled egg, whole grain cereal, 1% milk, grapefruit sections, and sunflower seeds. A sample lunch includes a mixed salad with olive oil vinaigrette, chili with beans, orange slices and yogurt, while dinner might feature fish, green beans, a mixed salad and a small portion of pasta with olive oil. Snacks included fresh fruit and string cheese.
 
A low-glycemic diet is a smart, healthy, manageable way to lose weight and keep it off for the long-term. If you’re looking to give this plan a try, be sure to take advantage of this handy low-glycemic shopping list created by researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital.

 Is obesity a disease? Doctors disagree 
 
 By Rachael Rettner 
 MyHealthNewsDaily 

Obesity puts people at risk for a whole host of conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and sleep problems. But is obesity itself a disease?

Doctors are divided on the issue. Some say obesity is indeed a disease, with causes beyond eating too much and exercising too little, and consequences that harm the body like any medical condition. In addition, they say referring to obesity as a disease would improve care for patients, and ensure treatments are covered by insurance plans.

Others argue obesity is a risk factor for health problems, but not a disease itself. They say calling obesity a disease would stigmatize a huge population, and categorize some people as &quot;sick&quot; who actually may be healthy.

&quot;If we call obesity a disease, it would mean automatically, a third of Americans are in a diseased state or sick,&quot; said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a general internist at Cambridge Health Alliance, referring to the fact that about 35 percent of Americans are obese . &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; Cohen said.

Last week, the American Medical Association (AMA) took up the question of whether to classify obesity as a disease at a meeting, and decided more research was needed on the topic, deferring the decision to a later date.

&quot;You could make a case for calling it a disease, but right now we&apos;re not there,&quot; Dr. William Werner, president of the Illinois State Medical Society, said of the decision.

However, experts agree that obesity is a critical public health problem , and the medical system needs to change to better manage obese people.

 Why some say obesity is a disease 

A disease is generally thought of as an abnormal state, or a condition that prevents the body from functioning properly.

During the AMA meeting, doctors pointed out that in some cases, people have underlying abnormalities that cause them to be obese, said Dr. Thomas Madejski, chair of the AMA&apos;s committee on medical service, and an internist in Albion, N.Y. For instance, a person&apos;s genetic makeup or metabolism could make her body expend fewer calories than other people&apos;s bodies, Madejski said.

And once people gain weight, the extra pounds can lead to metabolic and hormonal problems that increase the risk of diseases, said Dr. Scott Kahan, a preventive medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University.

Just as diabetes results from a malfunction of the body&apos;s ability to regulate of blood sugar, obesity results from a malfunction of the ability to regulate energy balance, Kahan said.

&quot;It satisfies all the definitions and criteria of what a disease and medical condition is,&quot; Kahan told MyHealthNewsDaily. &quot;The one difference is that people who have obesity have to wear their disease on the outside,&quot; Kahan said.

There is also concern some insurance companies do not cover obesity treatments, such as weight-loss medications or management programs, because obesity is not considered a disease. The AMA wants to learn more about why this problem happens, and how prevalent it is, Madejski said.

 Only a risk factor 

Others say that, while obesity is a risk factor for many medical conditions, carrying extra pounds does not destine people to develop those diseases. In fact, some people can be obese and healthy, and live a normal life, Cohen said.

&quot;There&apos;s no question that [obesity] is one of the most important public health problems facing America. It&apos;s just labeling it as a disease is not going to move us in a positive direction,&quot; Cohen said.

Others agreed.

&quot;We did not want to make society more ill overall,&quot; by labeling obesity as a disease if that label is not warranted, Madejski said.

Obese people may also be stigmatized, or may suffer psychological consequences if they are labeled as having a disease, Madejski said.

However, Kahan said referring to obesity as a disease may actually remove some of its stigma, because it could highlight the fact that obesity is not necessarily caused by a lack of willpower.

 Improving care 

Regardless of whether obesity is referred to as a disease, the care of obese patients needs improvement, experts said.

For instance, medical schools should change the way they teach students so they are better able to treat obese patients, Kahan said.

&quot;When people get care, they get a lot of finger-wagging,&quot; and advice to &quot;eat this, not that,&quot; Kahan said. But obesity is a much more complex problem, Kahan said.

Obese patients should also be able to visit doctors who specialize in the condition.

&quot;If you have diabetes or any other medical disorder…you would be treated by people with appropriate background to help you,&quot; Kahan said.

 Paula Deen drops 30 pounds, feels &apos;a thousand times better&apos; 
 By Lisa Flam 
Paula Deen has been making big changes in her diet, and it’s paying off.

Deen, the Southern chef known for her love of butter and the deep fryer, was much maligned
for promoting a high-fat diet when she revealed her type 2 diabetes diagnosis in January. She had kept her condition under wraps for three years.

Since sharing her diabetes diagnosis, she tells People magazine, she’s lost 30 pounds, dropping from a size 18 to a size 10.

“I feel a thousand times better,”Deen, 65, tells People , adding that she gives herself an injection every day to control her blood-sugar levels.“I have more energy, I sleep better. The weight loss has made my health issues better.”

In a cover story due out Friday, Deen tells People she is thinking differently about food these days.

“I do think differently,”about food, Deen tells People. She said she eats more green salads and veggies. And as for carbs?“Just a spoonful,”she allows. And dessert is sugar-free ice cream topped with berries, the magazine reports.

Fried food is mostly off the menu.

For someone with type 2 diabetes, changing your diet and losing weight are“the major modifiers”of the disease, says endocrinologist Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the obesity clinical program at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Those two things can sometimes be even more effective than medications, he said.

The body needs glucose, or sugar, to work properly, Hamdy says. Insulin is the“key”that opens the door to the body’s organs and tissues to allow the glucose in.

In type 2 diabetes, the body cannot metabolize sugar correctly, because either the pancreas is not making enough insulin or the body is resisting its own insulin. With the glucose locked out, too much sugar builds up in the bloodstream, causing type 2 diabetes.
 
A major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes is weight gain because it makes the body not responsive to its own insulin, Hamdy says. But shedding pounds can reverse the course of the disease, he said.

“Weight loss is the key to improving diabetes management and the weight loss can also lead to reversing the course of diabetes from continuous progression to regression, and occasionally, weight loss can lead to remission,”Hamdy says.

Remission, which can be long- or short-term, means a patient has normal blood sugar levels and doesn’t require medication, he said, adding that there is no“cure”for diabetes.“If you gain the weight back, then it will be a problem,”Hamdy said,“and diabetes will reappear again.”

 Your sweet tooth might be making you stupid 
 
 By Madeline Haller 
 Men&apos;s Health 

Prepping for a big presentation but can&apos;t seem to remember any of the content? Blame your sweet tooth.

A diet high in sugar may hamper your memory and ability to learn, says a study published in the Journal of Physiology.

Researchers had two groups of rats drink water mixed with fructose, a type of sugar. One of the groups also received omega-3 fatty acids as a part of their diet. After 6 weeks, the rats who drank only sugar water completed a maze slower than the omega-3-fed mice. (We know you&apos;re not a mouse -- but you can still take steps to navigate the maze of life. Check out these 27 Ways to Power Up Your Brain .)

Not only were they slower in the maze, the rats who drank only sugar water had higher triglyceride, glucose, and insulin levels. It appears that they entered a state of insulin resistance , which is where the hormone insulin becomes less effective at lowering your blood sugar, says Fernando Gomez-Pinilla, Ph.D., lead study author and a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

Why did sugar wreak havoc on their system?

Here&apos;s how it works: Insulin, in addition to controlling blood sugar, also influences the ways in which your brain cells operate. And within the hippocampus -- the part of the brain responsible for short-term and long-term memory -- insulin signaling actually facilitates memory. Therefore, an insulin resistance may be what&apos;s causing a disruption in the rats&apos; ability to recall the route they&apos;d learned 6 weeks ago, the researchers hypothesize.

But the good news is, omega-3 fatty acids appeared to have protective effect on the brain.
 
How so? Although the researchers are unaware of what&apos;s happening on a molecular level in the brain, Gomez-Pinilla says it may have to do with the large amount of DHA (the type of omega-3 fatty acid they monitored in the study) that&apos;s already present in the brain.

So could sugar slow down your brain, too? The researchers say yes. But since the study monitored the rats for nearly two months, the effect on humans would take several years of exposure to fructose to see these effects. (If you&apos;re looking to wean yourself off of sugar, check out these 9 Sneaky Ways to Eat Less .)

Want to reap those protective effects? Pick up a fish oil pil l-- such as Life Extension Super Omega-3 or Vitamin Shoppe Meg-3 Fish Oil EPA-DHA -- both of which come with at least 500 milligrams of omega-3s per soft gel.

 Guide to healthy grains: How to use farro, quinoa and more 
 
Michelle Hainer
 
Try this delicious quinoa dish for a meatless protein punch.
 By Michelle Hainer 
By now you know that a diet full of whole grains is the gold standard for eating healthy. While you may want to incorporate these foods into your diet, a trip through the grain aisle of your grocery store offers tons of confusing options. Here is a guide to some good-for-you grains, and how to use them in delicious ways!  
 
 Amaranth
 A godsend for those who can’t tolerate gluten, amaranth is packed with protein and contains the amino acid lysine, making it a complete protein. It’s also loaded with calcium and Vitamin C.

How to use it: When cooked, amaranth retains its crunch, making it ideal for adding to soups or salads. You can also buy it in flour form and give traditional baked goods a healthy boost, like these chocolate chip cookies .
 
Michelle Hainer
 
Barley salad with pesto and walnuts
 
 Barley
 One of the oldest cultivated grains, barley contains beta-glucan fiber which can control blood sugar levels and reduce cholesterol. And because of its high fiber content, a bowl full of barley can help you feel full longer.

How to use it: You can buy hulled barley, which takes about an hour to cook, or pearled barley, which has all or part of the bran and germ of the grain removed, but cooks up in half the time. Barley has a texture similar to rice, making it an excellent side dish, like in this yummy salad from Food&amp;Wine.
 
Michelle Hainer
 
Yum! Try a bulgur burger.
 
 Bulgur wheat
 Made of wheat kernels that are boiled, dried and cracked, bulgur has more fiber than buckwheat, quinoa or millet. Plus its mild flavor makes it a good“beginner”grain.

How to use it: Bulgur cooks up quickly, so it’s perfect for a last-minute side dish. (If you’ve ever eaten tabbouleh, you’ve had bulgur wheat.) It’s also hearty, so you can use it to cut the amount of meat in a recipe, like in these beef and bulgur burgers .

 Farro
 Also known as emmer, farro is an ancient strain of wheat that contains cyanogenic glucosides, which can stimulate your immune system and lower cholesterol. Farro has a deliciously nutty flavor and is just al dente enough to make it an excellent alternative to pasta. It’s pricey, but worth it.

How to use it: Farro can be purchased whole, or semi-perlato, meaning that part of the bran and germ of the grain have been removed. (Whole farro will take about an hour to cook, semi-perlato takes about 20 minutes.) Use it in place of penne in this recipe which pairs the spiciness of red pepper flakes with the sweetness of golden raisins.

 Millet
 It looks like birdseed (and indeed, is used as such in the U.S.), but millet is high in antioxidants, magnesium, and is gluten-free. It can also help control diabetes and inflammation.

How to use it: Millet can be eaten as a pilaf or simmered down into a creamy breakfast cereal. It also has a crunchy texture that works well in baked goods, like these delightful honey millet muffins from“Super Natural Every Day”by Heidi Swanson.

 Quinoa
 Pronounced keen-wah, quinoa is not only delicious, but it contains all of the amino acids we need. It’s also full of potassium and has a high ratio of protein to carbohydrates. No wonder it’s known as a superfood!

How to use it: Quinoa only takes about 15 minutes to simmer in either water or broth. For a meatless meal that doesn’t skimp on protein, try these real food bowls .

 Is healthy food really more expensive? 
 
Ryan Mcvay / Getty Images stock
 By Elisa Zied, R.D., msnbc.com contributor 
Contrary to popular belief, it can actually cost more to eat badly. In fact, a new government report finds that nutritious foods–such as grains, vegetables, fruit and dairy–typically cost less than items high in saturated fat and added sugars.

Researchers from the USDA compared the prices of 4,439“healthy”and“less healthy”foods commonly available in supermarkets around the country, examining price of edible weight, price per average portion, and price per calorie.

It can be cheaper to eat a healthier cereal than a more sugary one.
 
When price of edible weight or price per portion were used to determine costs, the researchers found healthy foods like toasted oat cereal (a grain), vegetables, fruits, and low-fat milk and plain, low-fat yogurt (dairy) were more affordable than most protein foods (lean roast beef, chicken breast, or canned tuna ) and other less healthful‘moderation foods’—foods that typically pack in an excess amount of saturated fat, added sugar, and/or sodium.

Examples of moderation foods include ice cream sandwiches, low-fat fruit flavored yogurt, and macaroni and cheese. When another measure—price per calorie—was used to compare foods, many healthful fruits and vegetables cost more than less healthy‘moderation foods’—especially those high in saturated fat and/or added sugars (such as chocolate candy, ice cream and tortilla chips ).

Although previous studies that used price-per-calorie to measure food costs similarly suggested healthy foods were often more expensive than less healthy options, a 2011 study by the USDA that used price of edible weight found that, although whole grains cost more than refined grains, and fresh and frozen dark green vegetables cost more than starchy vegetables, healthful items such as skim and 1 percent milk were less expensive than whole and two percent milk. Bottled water also tended to be less costly than carbonated nonalcoholic drinks.

In the current study, researchers used the USDA’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion Food Prices Database to estimate costs and compare all food items included.

Comparing the cost of commonly available foods is important because, at a time when two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese and many low-income families struggle to control their grocery bills, the belief that healthier foods are always pricier adds to the problem. According The NPD group, a market research firm, it’s no surprise that Americans come close to following federal dietary guidelines on only seven days per year. Although many variables—personal preferences, convenience, and cultural factors—play a role in what we buy at the supermarket, cost may play an even greater role in our food choices.

“It’s a common perception that healthy foods are more expensive than less healthy foods—and this perception, real or hypothetical, may prevent many individuals from choosing healthy foods,”says David Katz, MD, Director, Yale University Prevention Research Center. 

So what’s a family to do to consume a more healthful and affordable diet?

Judy Caplan, R.D., a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, suggests the following:

 Plan meals ahead of time to cut down on food costs and reduce impulse buying. When you cook, make extra and freeze leftovers in individual portions. That can minimize waste and give you an alternative to grabbing take-out or convenience food. Since protein foods such as meat and poultry can be expensive, use them more as a condiment than a main course. You can also replace some or all of the meat or poultry used in chilis and stews with beans. Eat more‘south of the border’meals like whole grain tortillas with beans, cheese, and salsa. Choosing healthy fats like avocado (used to make guacamole) can also promote satiety and help you feel full longer. To trim produce costs, buy fruits and vegetables that are in season. You can save even more money if you plant your own backyard garden using seed packets. Plant the five vegetables your family eats most often. Continuous plantings throughout the summer will insure a steady supply. If you don&apos;t have a backyard, container gardening is another option.

 How to avoid weight gain? Eat on a schedule 
 
 By MyHealthNewsDaily.com 

Weight gain may caused in part by eating on an odd eating schedule, rather than only by eating too many calories, a new study in mice suggests.

Mice in the study that were fed a high-fat diet and allowed to eat whenever they wanted to, not surprisingly, gained weight . In contrast, mice that had their feeding restricted to eight hours a day were protected against obesity , despite the fact that they consumed just as many calories as the unrestricted mice.

The findings suggest that restricting meal times might be an underappreciated way to help people keep off the pounds, the researchers said.

&quot;Every organ has a clock,&quot; said study researcher Satchidananda Panda, of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. That means there are times that our livers, intestines, muscles and other organs work at peak efficiency, and other times when they are—more or less—sleeping, Panda said.

These metabolic cycles are critical for processes such as cholesterol breakdown, and they should be turned on when we eat and turned off when we don&apos;t, Panda said. When mice or people eat frequently throughout the day and night, it can throw off those normal metabolic cycles, he added.

Over the 18-week study, the time-restricted mice were protected from the adverse effects of their high-fat diet, and showed improvements in their metabolism compared with the unrestricted mice. They gained 28 percent less weight than unrestricted mice and suffered less liver damage.

Further work is needed to show the same thing happens in people, the researchers said. More studies should collect information on when people eat, and not just what they eat, Panda said.

Panda said there is reason to think our eating patterns have changed in recent years, as many people have greater access to food and stay up late into the night, even if just to watch TV . And when people are awake, they tend to snack, Panda said.

The study is published online today (May 17) in the journal Cell Metabolism.

 25 ways to flatten your belly by summer 
 By The Editors of Prevention

Want a flatter tummy by summer? Get started with these 25 tips.
 
A toned, flat tummy is a goal many of us strive to achieve in time for bathing suit season, but endless crunches and ditching all your favorite foods until July 4 th isn’t the right—or fun--way to do it. A sculpted core and trim tummy can be attained by incorporating small changes into your day, like holding in your abs while you walk and adding the right healthy fats to your diet. In our lean belly guide, you’ll get diet and exercise tips that will help you eliminate hard-to-reach ab flab and reveal a sculpted, sexy midsection. Here, learn 25 ways to flatten your belly by summer.

 

 1. Take your gossip session on a walk 
Instead of catching up with friends over food and drinks, suggest a reunion on the move—you&apos;re likely to work out 104% harder if you have an exercise buddy. Suggest a weekly walk-and-talk session, form a friendly fitness club, or take advantage of gym specials together. You&apos;ll motivate everyone to get moving while you grow even closer.

 6 Signs You Joined the Wrong Gym 

 2. Deflate your muffin tope with the roll-up 
Hold a resistance band taut between hands and lie on the floor face up, with legs extended and arms overhead. Pull abs in, tuck your chin, lift arms toward the ceiling, and roll head, shoulders, and torso up and over your legs as far as you can. Keep heels firmly on the floor and reach hands towards your feet. Pause, then slowly roll back down. Do 5 to 8 reps with 30 minutes of cardio 5 to 6 times a week.

 3. Make time for cardio
 If you want to burn the most belly fat, a Duke University study confirms that aerobic exercise is the most effective in burning that deep, visceral belly fat. In fact, aerobic training burns 67% more calories than resistance training or a combination of the two, according to the study.

 4. Try out Spidey moves 
Eliminate spillover spots with the Spiderman Climber: Get into plank position with arms and legs extended, hands beneath shoulders, and feet flexed. Keeping your abs tight, bend your left leg out to the side and bring the knee toward the left elbow. Pause, then return to start. Switch sides. Do 20 reps, alternating sides, with 30 minutes of cardio 5 to 6 times a week.

 The Secret to a Flat Stomach 

 5. Fight fat with fiber 
For every 10 grams of fiber you eat daily, your belly will carry almost 4% less fat. Thankfully, there are more enjoyable ways to increase your fiber than scarfing down a box of bran flakes: Two apples,½cup of pinto beans, one artichoke, or two cups of broccoli will all give you 10 grams of belly-flattening fiber.

 6. Be pushy at restaurants
 Saying, &quot;I&apos;ll go last&quot; when the waiter comes around could be adding bulk to your belly. A recent study showed that a normal-weight woman was more likely to mimic a thin woman&apos;s eating habits than an obese woman&apos;s. So when you&apos;re out for girl’s night, order first. You&apos;ll keep yourself, and maybe even a friend or two, on track to a flatter tummy.

 How to Prevent Anything 

7. Do the Windshield Wiper
 Lie face up with arms out to your sides, palms down, and legs bent at 90 degrees so feet are off the floor. Keep abs tight and slowly lower legs to the left as far as possible, keeping shoulders on the floor. Pause, then return to start. Repeat to the right. Do 20 reps, alternating sides.

 Top Yoga Poses for Weight Loss 

 8. Clean your house 
One more reason to start your spring-cleaning: Vacuuming is a great ab workout. Tighten your abdominal muscles while you push back and forth for a tighter tummy while you clean.

 9. Cut back on the pretzels 
Too much salt will make you retain more fluid, which contributes to a puffy appearance and extra water weight.

 10. Fry fat with the boat move 
Target your deepest ab muscles with The Boat: Lie face up on a mat with arms straight up over chest. Lift your upper body off the ground by rolling through the spine. At the same time, raise your legs so that you&apos;re balancing on your butt, knees bent and shins parallel to the ground. Slowly roll back down onto the mat, lowering legs. That’s 1 rep. Do 5 reps per set, resting 30 to 60 seconds between sets.

 11. Add this green fruit to your diet 
Just half an avocado contains 10 grams of MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids), which halt blood sugar spikes that tell your body to store fat around your belly. Eat these in¼cup servings to ward off belly fat without overdoing it.

 10 Diet Splurges You Can Enjoy 

 12. Play catch 
Get into a crunch position—lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on the floor, shoulders and head off the floor with your abs contracted. Then have someone throw an exercise ball (or basketball) to you—first to your left side so you have to twist and reach to catch it, and then to your right. Do this as many times as is comfortable, and try to increase the number each week.

 13. Skip your daily soda habit 
Where do you think all those bubbles from carbonated drinks end up? They gang up in your belly! Swap soda, diet soda, and seltzer for Sassy Water, a Flat Belly Diet staple beverage. Get the Sassy Water recipe here . 

 14. Get on the wagon 
That glass of wine with every meal may be part of the reason your jeans are too tight. Alcohol intake is known to raise cortisol levels, sending fat straight to your belly.

 15. Paddle off your belly pooch
 Kayaking is an exhilarating, ab-crunching workout. Constant paddling requires lots of twisting and tightness from your abs for long periods of time. For the best kayaking trips, visit kayaking.org

  10 Reasons Your Abs Exercises Aren’t Working 

 16. Sprinkle these seeds on your salad 
Sunflower seeds are packed with tons of MUFAs and B vitamins, which play an important role in protecting against inflammation. Sprinkle two tablespoons on top of your salad and stir-fries.

 17. Sculpt your core while you walk 
As you go about your day, imagine there&apos;s a magnet pulling your belly button back toward your spine. Practice the tuck until it becomes comfortable, and soon this easy ab-engaging move will become like second nature.

 Try Power Walking to Blast Fat 

 18. Add fresh seafood to your plate 
Salmon and other fatty fish are rich in the same omega-3 fatty acids as many belly- fat-busting foods. Try poaching your fish for a low-calorie way to enjoy this lean protein.

 19. Guzzle more H20
 Forget water weight: Drinking lots of water helps flush bloat that your body might be holding onto in the heat.

 20. Stand tall while pumping iron
 Stand as much as possible when doing weight-lifting exercises. That way your abs will naturally help to balance and stabilize your body. To add an extra flat belly boost to your weight routine, concentrate on keeping your abs tight and maintaining good posture while you lift, but without holding your breath.

 21. Sleep away your belly fat 
Research from the University of Chicago shows that those who sleep 7 hours or more a night lose twice as much fat and are less hungry than those who get less than 7 hours of shut-eye.

 5 Ways Sleeping Less Makes You Gain Weight 

 22. Tone up with tennis 
A few sets of backhands and forehands in the cool fall weather, and you&apos;ll feel your abs getting tighter after just a few sets. You&apos;ll strengthen your obliques with every stroke.

 23. Keep peanut butter on your diet 
One serving of peanut butter has 2 g of fiber and 8 g of protein, on top of belly-busting MUFAs. Try this easy recipe to add a flat belly punch to dinner: Toss a half-cup of whole grain noodles with 3 ounces cooked shrimp, minced scallions, and 1/4 cup sliced red bell pepper. Dress with a mixture of 2 tablespoons peanut butter, 2 tablespoons warm water, and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.

 Is Peanut Butter Good for You? 

 24. Punch your way to a flat stomach 
Take your workout indoors with boxing. Aerobic kickboxing is more than just a great belly fat-burning, cardio workout. All those arm thrusts and high kicks firm abs, too.

 25. Sculpt while you sit 
While you&apos;re driving, sitting, or just waiting at the doctor&apos;s office, imagine there&apos;s gum or wet paint on the back of your chair so you have to hold yourself up instead of leaning back. Keep shoulder blades down and back, abdominals lifted, and picture yourself knitting your rib cage together and in.

Cheeseburgers on a diet? You can splurge, as long as you do it in moderation.
 
 By Amy Ahlberg 
 Prevention 

Yes, you can have your cake (or pizza, or cheeseburger) and eat it too. But you need to learn what &quot;moderation&quot; really means. Here&apos;s how.

 Three Steps to Get You Started 
You already know that a too-strict eating plan can backfire, resulting in a blowout binge or, worse, throwing you off the wagon altogether. But when it comes to allowing yourself a little leeway, moderation is key. But what does &quot;moderation&quot; even mean? For gourmands, a cheeseburger a week might seem reasonable; for health nuts, maybe it&apos;s one every 3 months, minus the cheese and bun. To find out who&apos;s right, we turned to Sarah Krieger, RD, and Joan Salge Blake, RD, spokespeople for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. For starters, they say you should only indulge in what you love, and skip the rest. If you don&apos;t have a weakness for fries, don&apos;t eat them just because they&apos;re there; and if you don&apos;t have a sweet tooth, don&apos;t have dessert simply because your dinner buddy does. &quot;For me, I skip pizza and burgers, but I eat a great-tasting sweet treat every day,&quot; says Krieger. &quot;I balance it with exercise and eating a variety of nutritious foods.&quot; For more tips, click through our slideshow. But first, some ground rules:

Step one: If you&apos;re overweight or have health concerns, especially heart disease or diabetes, talk to your doctor. This advice is based on an average 2,000-calorie diet, consumed by American adults at a healthy weight.

Step two: &quot;Take a look at how active you really are. With most of our lifestyles, we don&apos;t need a lot of calories in order to maintain a stable weight,&quot; says Salge Blake. Go overboard too often and your waistline, not to mention your heart and your pancreas, may pay the price.

Step three: Keep a food diary and ask yourself, from a caloric standpoint: If I have this indulgence, what foods will I need to avoid this week to balance it out? Now read on for our tips on how to budget your binge allowance this week, and every week.

 My Perfect Diet is Making Me Fat 

 Bacon 
Serving: 4 slices of pork bacon 168 calories, 12.7 g fat (4.2 g sat. fat), 767 mg sodium, 0.5 g carbs, 0 g sugar

Who among us can resist the aroma of sizzling bacon? If this is your weekend vice, be sure to curtail your fat and sodium intake for the 6 days before and after. Bacon&apos;s saturated fat content is high, says Salge Blake, and just a few pieces make a major dent in the 20 grams most of us can afford to consume daily. So enjoy those crunchy strips, but enjoy them responsibly.

 Why You Shouldn&apos;t Be a Diet Perfectionist 

 Cheeseburger 
Serving: 1 restaurant cheeseburger with all the fixings 940 calories, 58 g fat (22 g sat. fat), 1700 mg sodium, 51 g carbs, 0 g sugar

With 22 grams of saturated fat, this doozy of a dietary indulgence maxes out your daily saturated-fat allowance in one fell swoop. &quot;Heart disease develops over time, and when [you] eat a diet high in saturated fat, the risk for developing heart disease is greater,&quot; says Krieger. If you&apos;re determined to chow down on a cheeseburger, your protein choices should all be &quot;lean and mean,&quot; according to Salge Blake, for the rest of the week.

 French Fries 
Serving: Medium-sized fast food French fries 410 calories, 18 g fat (3 g sat. fat), 570 mg sodium, 58 g carbs, 0 g sugar

You&apos;ve probably been there: The first few fries taste heavenly. As your meal wears on, they start to look (and taste) less appealing, but you polish them off anyway. &quot;With every subsequent bite, the pleasure diminishes,&quot; says Salge Blake. Easy solution? Get a small order instead and get a side salad to go with it. Because once potatoes are deep fried, we&apos;re sorry to say they don&apos;t really count as a vegetable anymore.

 Eat Fries--Guilt-Free! 

 Chocolate Chip Cookies 
Serving: 4 cookies, made from refrigerated cookie dough 312 calories, 24.8 g fat (14 g sat. fat), 340 mg sodium, 50 g carbs, 40 g sugar

One of the top calorie sources in the American diet is grain-based dessert, like cake, cookies, and pie, says Salge Blake. And while one or two cookies won&apos;t ruin anyone&apos;s diet, most of us don&apos;t stop there, and then we do it again the next day. But this sweet treat&apos;s a real sugar-shocker; women should consume just 24 grams (6 teaspoons) of sugar per day, and four cookies almost doubles that. That means you&apos;ll have to cut back elsewhere, whether it&apos;s in your morning cup of joe or even a glass of fruit juice. Another tip? Give your willpower a break and bake only a few at a time.

 Ice Cream 
Serving: 1 cup (1/4 pint) of vanilla ice cream 260 calories, 14 g fat (8 g sat. fat), 70 mg sodium, 28 g carbs, 28 g sugar

The saturated fat content of ice cream is high, so you need to watch your intake of all saturated fat, including protein and other sources, when you choose ice cream as your indulgence. A high saturated fat intake increases your (bad) LDL cholesterol levels, which then increases risk of heart disease, says Krieger. Salge Blake&apos;s tip for stretching a pint of ice cream to feed four people: &quot;Add fruit to one-cup servings; You&apos;ll be dishing up something that looks a lot more generous and satisfying.&quot; If you want, add chocolate or crumbled up cookies to the mix.

 The Best Low Fat Ice Creams and Frozen Yogurts 

 Steak 
Serving: one 6-ounce steak 270 calories, 15 g fat (5 g sat. fat), 105 mg sodium, 0 g carbs, 0 g sugar

If you&apos;re having a craving for it, answer it, says Salge Blake. &quot;With steak, you have less to worry about fat- and calorie-wise when you compare it to a cheeseburger.&quot; Still, many steaks come with seriously fatty sides, and the saturated fat does adds up. One way to keep it in check? Order a 3-ounce filet mignon, which is a naturally leaner cut, or get the 6-ouncer and brown bag the rest for later. Another good option: steak kabobs, which control the steak portion size you consume, plus add veggies.

 Foods Not to Ditch When You Diet 

 Fried Chicken 
Serving: one 5.7-ounce restaurant fried chicken breast 360 calories, 21 g fat (5 g sat. fat), 1080 mg sodium, 11 g carbs, 0 g sugar

Chicken&apos;s not bad in itself , it&apos;s when it&apos;s battered and fried that the fat and sodium issues arise. That&apos;s bad news for your blood pressure, which can be spiked by too much salt. Most Americans should consume around 1,500 mg of sodium daily, and this chicken breast almost maxes you out on its own. If you indulge in this, you need to shave down your sodium intake for the rest of the week. Remember: If you spend your allowance in one place, you have to cut corners somewhere else. &quot;It&apos;s important to savor high calorie foods, rather than scarfing them down,&quot; says Krieger. &quot;Eat them slowly. Smell the aromas, limit distractions like TV or reading, and enjoy with family and friends,&quot; she says.

 Doughnuts 
Serving: One chocolate doughnut 380 calories, 25 g fat (11 g sat. fat), 410 mg sodium, 36 g carbs, 17 g sugar

If a doughnut is your idea of breakfast, take a look at the carbohydrates and sugar here: This is a treat, not a healthy way to start your day. &quot;Too much sugar on an empty stomach can cause stomach upset and a quick drop in energy after the initial sugar surge,&quot; says Krieger. &quot;This leads to cravings or increased hunger.&quot; Another problem? Refined carbs are low in fiber, which means they don&apos;t make you feel full. So treat doughnuts as what they are, dessert, and indulge sparingly.

 Pizza 
Serving: 2 slices of a large cheese pizza 580 calories, 20 g fat (9 g sat. fat), 1440 mg sodium, 74 g carbs, 8 g sugar

Pizza&apos;s an all-time favorite food for many, but just looking at the sodium count could practically send your blood pressure soaring. If there&apos;s too much sodium in your body and your kidneys can&apos;t keep up, it builds up in the blood, says Krieger, leading to high BP. If you indulge in pizza, you should keep an eye on your sodium for the next 6 days. And because plain cheese pizza offers no fiber from veggies, Salge Blake suggests you add veggie toppings to your pizza, or eat a salad before diving in.

 Cheesecake 
Serving: One plain slice of restaurant cheesecake 460 calories, 29 g fat (17 g sat. fat), 330 mg sodium, 43 g carbs, 33 g sugar

Would you still want this decadent dessert if it meant no more treats for the week? If so, go for it, but if not, take Salge Blake&apos;s advice and spread out your dessert opportunities for the week. It&apos;s easy: Just make smaller, less calorie-dense choices and you can enjoy dessert more often. Remember: A small amount of a treat gets the job done, satisfaction-wise, according to research. Train yourself to eat like that and you&apos;ll appreciate those &quot;first bite&quot; pleasure opportunities even more, without breaking the diet bank. Life this way can be sweet indeed.

 5 surprising reasons you gain weight 
 
 By Dave Zinczenko 
 Men&apos;s Health 

Rarely does a complicated problem have a simple answer. And for America’s 36 percent national obesity rate, the answer is sandwiched between nutritional obfuscation from the people who sell food and the bad diet habits of those of us who eat it. So in Eat This, Not That! 2012 , I took a hard look at the eating habits of America. Here I present to you the surprising reasons you gain weight, plus examples of the restaurant meals that encourage the bad habits.

 Reason #1: Eating a Carb-Heavy Breakfast 

Perkins Berry Blueberry Pancakes: 1,140 calories, 29 g fat (12 g saturated), 2,150 mg sodium, 200 g carbohydrate, 110 g sugars, 20 g protein

Sugar equivalent: 7 Klondike ice cream sandwiches!

Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that meals that limited carbohydrates to 43 percent were more filling and had a milder effect on blood sugar than meals with 55 percent carbohydrates. With that in mind, this pancake platter is 70 percent carbs—a full 800 calories worth—making it a dangerous way to start your day. The best breakfast is one heavy on protein, and eggs make that incredibly easy. In one study published in The International Journal of Obesity , dieters who ate eggs instead of bagels for breakfast lost 65% more weight and a 34% greater reduction in waist circumference.

Eat This Instead!

Perkins Build-Your-Own-Omelette with Swiss Cheese, Bacon, Mushrooms, and Spinach: 430 calories, 29 g fat (13.5 g saturated), 530 mg sodium, 8 g carbohydrate, 1 g sugars, 35 g protein

 

Feel-good fuel: Food is powerful, and the wrong kind can leave you depressed, tired, and anxious. Instead, instantly brighten your day with these 11 Foods That End Bad Moods .  

 Reason #2: Eating Excessive Amounts of Sodium 

P.F. Chang’s Pork Double Pan Fried Noodles: 1,652 calories, 84 g fat (12 g saturated), 7,900 mg sodium

Sodium equvalent: Nearly 9 cans of Pringles potato crisps!

Forget bloating and parchedness—these salt-soaked noodles pose a larger threat. Salt has been shown to produce an addictive effect similar to that of opiates. Researchers in Florida found that when opiate-dependent subjects went off a drug, they increased their intake of sodium-rich foods, ostensibly to stimulate those same opiate receptors in the brain. Salt, say the researchers, often“feels good”rather than“tastes good.”The subjects in the study, during opiate withdrawal, saw an average weight gain of 6.6 percent.

Eat This Instead! 

P.F. Chang’s Garlic Noodles: 712 calories, 16 g fat (4 g saturated), 1,440 mg sodium

 Reason #3: Ordering foods because the name sounds healthy 

IHOP Chicken&amp;Spinach Salad: 1,600 calories, 118 g fat (32 g saturated, .5 g trans), 2,340 mg sodium

Calorie equivalent: 3 McDonald’s Big Macs!

IHOP’s egregious salad is a prime example of what researchers call the“health halo”effect. This is the psychological phenomenon in which people perceive unhealthy meals as healthy when those foods are associated with good-for-you buzzterms or foods. Words like“natural”or“multigrain”can be misleading, and any time a restaurant serves something on a salad, people automatically assume it’s good for them. The so-called health halo also makes us more likely to overeat. Restaurants like IHOP know and exploit this, which is how salads with 100+ grams of fat continue to make it onto menus.

Eat This Instead!

IHOP Take Two Combo, 1/2 Double BLT Sandwich and Seasonal Fresh Fruit: 470 calories, 28 g fat (6 g saturated), 1,180 mg sodium

 Reason #4: Ordering combo meals 

McDonald’s Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese Value Meal (with Large Fries and Large Coke): 1,550 calories, 67 g fat (23 g saturated, 3 g trans), 1,750 mg sodium, 95 g sugars

Fat equivalent: 17 bowls of Kraft Easy Mac!

A study in the Journal of Public Policy&amp;Marketing showed that, compared to a la carte orders, value meals pack an extra hundred calories or more. And in some cases, as seen here, that number can be much, much higher. Part of the problem is that restaurants bundle items together so that they can pawn off cheap calories, like those found in french fries. So they earn more profit, and you earn more inches on your waistline. Piece together your own meal to be sure you’re not being stuck with any freeloading fat calories.

Eat This Instead!

McDonald’s McDouble, 4-Piece Chicken McNuggets, and Large Iced Tea: 580 calories, 31 g fat (10 g saturated, 1.5 g trans), 1,290 mg sodium, 7 g sugars

 Related link: Discover the 1,500-calorie combos lurking in the drive-thru line with the 10 Worst Fast Food Meals . 

 Reason #5: Taking in empty calories 

Dairy Queen Banana Cream Pie Blizzard (medium): 770 calories, 28 g fat (17 g saturated, 1 g trans), 83 g sugars

Sugar equivalent: 9 bowls of Cookie Crisp cereal!

Dessert calories are empty, meaning they present your body with lots of energy, but no nutritional advantage for burning it off. Sugar is the primary culprit here, and there’s a direct correlation between the amount you eat and the size of your pants. What’s most shocking is that we develop our propensity toward sugar at very young age. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, today’s kids take in about 16 percent of their daily calories from added sugars, and the main sources are soda, baked goods, cereal, candy, and fruit drinks. This primes us to gravitate toward monstrous, over-sweetened desserts—like Blizzards—later in life. When your sweet tooth strikes, think modesty. It only takes a few bites to satisfy, and if you stop there, you’ve cut hundreds of calories from your diet.
