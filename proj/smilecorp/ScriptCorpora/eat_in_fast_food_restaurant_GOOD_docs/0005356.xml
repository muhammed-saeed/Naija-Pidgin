I feel bad writing bad reviews but when you want to die after a $300 meal you have to...Not happy...been here many times and now would not return...the smell of sewage is horrible...we had to move tables...service was not good at all...staff not friendly at all...manager/owner tried to accommodate as much as possible...we ordered a Porter House steak and were not told it was 30OZ!!!!!!!!! Who would eat 30OZ??? Also, I ordered an 8 OZ lobster tail and was served and charged for a 14 OZ...money is not the issue but paying for items you don&apos;t order is...the manager gave us a bone for our dog and as we were leaving someone commented that it smelt like dead dog then we later took the bone out and it was rotten...
 Order: lobster, steak

While my husband and I, have experienced fine dining, world wide, the Carriage House Restaurant was a mjajor disappointment for several reasons and we shall NEVER-NEVER return! The restaurant parking lot had a strong smelly odour of garbege, which was a turn off. Upon entering into the restaurant, we were greeted by a straight faced woman, wearing glasses of large white frames and very dark lenses, even though it was the evening. She did not come across as welcoming or friendly, which did not make for a very good impression. She eyeballed me up and down, in a very judging manner, even though my husband and I were nicely dressed, as though we were street peasants and gave me a sour expression. This is not the kind of greeting that we are accoustomed to, from resturants that pride themselves with regards to fine dining qualities. My order of ravioli was very salty and therefore I could only stomach half of my portion. Having expressed this to the waitor, he explaned that the very salty flavours was due to the cheese. I hardly believed this, as I have eaten lots of cheese in my lifetime and while cheese can indeed be salty, this ravioli was overpowered by salty flavours, which made my chosen meal a major disappointment.
My husband&apos;s plate arrived with LACK of presentation. There was no sense of creativity on his plate of food. He was simply served a piece of steak with his side order of fries, on a bare white plate which did NOT make for an appetizing presentation. The fries were very salty; something you&apos;d expect at a fast food restaurant. I tasted one of his fries and was not impressed with how much sodium I could taste.
The waitor hardly spoke to us, rushed about his affairs and did not care to converse with us, more than he had to! We tired holding a conversation with him for a bit, but he seemed very disconnected from us; very disinterested in speaking to us, wanted to serve us quickly; to move away from our table...not a happy feeling.
The meal was over $300.00 which was a shock considerning we did not choose the finest of wine. The bill was overpriced at large, for hum-drum meals that were overpowered by salt, that LACKED presenation and creativity. Perhaps the Carriage House might consider dressing up their steak meal with a few colourful additions of carrot sticks instead of simply placing a piece of steak onto a drab white plate.
I was NOT impressed with this restaurant. I had to drink lots of water, after the meal to flush out the salty taste in my mouth. While I could only stomach half of my meal, I was quite hungry and felt &apos;ripped off&apos; from our evening due to my let down with the hum-drum food.

I have tasted many fine meals, worldwide and this restaurant cannot hold a candle to the fine dining that I have experienced throughout my travels...it offers an over priced menu for food that is not acceptable in terms of taste and presentation.

THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAD AT THE CARRIAGE HOUSE RESTAURANT WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT AND FOR THIS WE WILL NEVER, NEVER RETURN.
 Order: soup, steak, french fries, ravioli, wine, dessert and coffee

We have been going to this restaurant since it opened in 2003/2004. It was so nice to have a&quot;proper&quot;restaurant open in Burlington. A place where they had the budget to buy proper kitchen equipment, proper dining tables and chairs, proper flatware and stemware. Upon enetering, you&apos;d smell the pleasant sweetness of mesquite charcoal and your mouth would water at the display of fresh fish and game meat on display. This was the place! 7 years later, nothing has changed. Including the menu (Tasmanian Ocean Trout has been a nightly special for 2,372 nights running) and the insufferable service headed up by the&quot;Franz&quot;the aloof manager. About 6 months ago after a particularily agonizing exchange with Franz, we finally realized that the cons of this restaurant have outweighed any pros and have decided never to return. From driving by on various weekend nights, the parking lot appears empty. Has the rest of Burlington come to the same conclusion we have? I look forward to the day that the Carriage House closes their doors and someone who cares about providing all facets of a good restaurant decides to take up occupancy in this perfect location.
 Order: Tasmanian Ocean Trout, Overpriced Wine

My sister and brother-in-law visited us from Holland - so it was my absolute intention to bring them here. My husband and I visit every couple of months and we love it. The food is fabulous and the service second to none. Bread, water and wine replaced when needed and you&apos;re made to feel very confortable. My sister and her husband said it was the best meal they had ever had - looking forward to our next visit :)

I was extremely impressed by this dining experience.

Service staff was fantastic and very attentive. We were never left wanting for anything. Bread and wine was filled as emptied, with a smile.

Meat was cooked to perfection, and presented well. A great selection of wine was available.

The atmosphere was comfortable and homey, while the mesquite grill warms you with it&apos;s aromas.

And perhaps the best testament to it&apos;s quality is that everyone in there seemed to be having a great time.

Highly recommended.
 Order: Shrimp cocktail, corn/bacon chowder, rack of lamb, Beef tenderloin, Keylime pie, lemon tart

amazing food, great service.
I was there the same night as previous reviewer and I witnessed the incident.
The owner handled herself great.
The complainers were very rude, if I was the owner I would shove the lamb down their throats and kicked them out.
This is the best restaurant in Burlington and the owner was right not to allow to be bullied by ignorant, rude people.
Way to go, I love you. See you soon.
 Order: foie gras, lamb, bison, creme brulee

We visited Carriage House on the advice of friends. First impressions were good. One of our party received a meal that was overcooked and asked that it be replaced. The owner promptly visited our table but disappointed us by challenging the interpretation of medium rare. The replacement meal took over 30 minutes but it arrived blue rare. When the meal was sent back a second time the owner came back to our table and placed the meat from the original entree in the middle of our table. She proceeded to scold the table and make a scene in the restaurant. I have never been so embarrassed and disgusted with the utter lack of customer service skills, where did she get that piece of meat from, the garbage??. The owner of this establishment had the opportunity to address a complaint in a professional manner but her sense of entitlement got the best of her. I&apos;m sure other people have had positive experiences but I suggest you keep complaints to yourself, it is not worth the wrath of the owner.
 Order: Roast Piglet, Rack of Lamb.

As a server, I have had this experience a few times...very annoying. And let me guess - she ate several bites of both meals THEN complained? Scamming (i.e. out for a free meal) at it&apos;s finest! lol

My date and I ate there Saturday night. It is upscale and so are the&quot;regulars&quot;. Anyone who thinks this place is snooty has obviously never been to Ottawa.
Someone mentioned the baseboard heater - i had to move because it was cooking me since i was seated directly above it. Our waiter John provided some of the best service i&apos;ve ever had.
We sat in the front room on the main floor, by the end of the night we ended up meeting most everyone around us. Everyone was friendly, the service is perfect and the food is excellent. The decor is awesome too.
 Order: Lamb, babyback ribs, shiraz.

Most of these reviews seem a little off the mark. Without going too far to&quot;review other reviews&quot;here. I&apos;ll just say that the longer particularly read like aspiring food critics who feel the need to be pointlessly critical and sophmoric
The comments painting the other patrons in the restaurant as being snooty seem misplaced. I have been several times and always get the feeling from the wait staff of warmth - the other patrons, I&apos;m not sure why I&apos;m supposed to care or what I&apos;d expect a restaurant to do unless they should screen potential customers for snootiness at the door? I digress.

The &apos;negatives&apos;.
It is expensive, but fine dining usually is. The menu is not exhaustive - particularly on special occasions (I also have been on Valentines day). Portions are not huge, it&apos;s not a steakhouse. I would say the portions are fair, and offer a chance to enjoy a few courses.

The positives. The food is quite good - some ingredients I&apos;m not crazy about like blue cheese find there way into multiple dishes (salad, ravioli et cetera) but again - in &apos;fine dining&apos; that&apos;s par for the course. The building itself is charming.

Taken for what it&apos;s worth - it&apos;s a decent place to go. Taking a date there you probably won&apos;t go wrong. There are half a dozen other &apos;fine dining&apos; restaurants which deserve far far worse reviews than the Carriage house (the current Restaurantica category is&quot;Pub Food&quot;which is incorrect) - Napoleans or Mount Nemo to name two.
 Order: Bision steak.
