 Child obesity 
 
Children’s health is the greatest value for any responsible parent. However, some people sometimes forget that such a basic issue like the right nutrition substantially affects children’s organisms. Child obesity is a quite common phenomenon nowadays, for which their parents are largely responsible.

Fast pace of everyday life, overcoming numerous obstacles, and work are the main reasons why parents don’t pay attention to what their children eat. Lack of time and wrong organisation make it impossible for them to cook nutritious meals for their kids and they often end up ordering pizza or eating in a local fast food restaurant.

Such an approach makes the children take in a large number of empty calories, devouring crisps and drinking fizzy drinks. Instead of some tasty lunch prepared by the parents (fruits, salad, sandwich with fresh vegetables), the child buys products form the school shop which is full of chocolate bars, doughnuts or hot dogs.

Also supper is no longer a meal that unites the family, full of conversations and relaxed atmosphere. Children spend their evenings in front of the computer screen or TV, eating chips that can be bought frozen and made instantly in a deep fryer.

Another important matter is the lack of physical activities. Instead of meeting in a football pitch or in the park, children prefer online meetings and playing computer games and they get the written excuses from doctors in order not to exercise during the PE classes as their parents claim that these lessons stress their kids too much.

We should encourage our children to join some sports classes (karate, athletics, tennis) and develop their skills. We also should take care of their diet in order to prevent them form developing respiratory, alimentary or cardiovascular diseases as a result of their obesity. We should be doing our best in order to ensure that our child is a healthy and happy person in the future.
