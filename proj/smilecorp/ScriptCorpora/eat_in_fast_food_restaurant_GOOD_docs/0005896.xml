Who&apos;s behind that outbreak? Sometimes, CDC won&apos;t say
 
Salmonella strain that sickened 109 people, including a man who died, was initially identified only as &quot;strain X&quot; by the CDC.
 By JoNel Aleccia 
When government health officials wrapped up a three-month investigation of a salmonella Enteritidis outbreak that sickened 68 people in 10 states, the final report on Jan. 19 included nearly every detail -- except the name of the place that sold the food.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has refused to identify the source, other than as“Restaurant Chain A,”a Mexican-style fast-food chain.

That’s the second time in a little more than a year that the agency has masked the source of foodborne illness at a similar chain. In August 2010, a final CDC report found that 155 people in 21 states were sickened by two rare strains of salmonella traced to an anonymous Mexican-style fast-food chain eventually identified as Taco Bell.

Two other recent outbreaks with initially hidden sources -- laboratory-supplied salmonella Typhimuirium identified only as“strain X ,”and an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in romaine lettuce from“grocery store Chain A” -- have spurred new scrutiny of the agency’s willingness to keep the entities behind some infectious outbreaks secret.

Food safety advocates say the practice keeps the public in the dark about which firms have been linked to illness.

“It will eventually come out and it will be the company that looks bad,”said Doug Powell, a professor of food safety at Kansas State University and author of a food safety blog .“A lot of these problems could be reduced if government agencies were more transparent about how they decide when to go public.”
