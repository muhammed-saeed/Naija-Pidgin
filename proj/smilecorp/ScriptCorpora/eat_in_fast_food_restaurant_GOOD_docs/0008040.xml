 overpriced pizza 

 Advantages: easy to order
 Disadvantages: expensive


...Domino&apos;s Pizza has over 8,700 stores in over 60 countries. 
Tom Monaghan opened the first Domino&apos;s Pizza place in 1960 in the USA. The first store opened in the UK in 1985. This surprised me as I thought they had been around the UK longer than this as people rave so much about the pizza&apos;s. 
Tom joined forces with his brother and together they opened a pizza delivery store in Michigan. They named it DomiNicks. A year later, Tom traded his Volkswagen Beetle car for his brother&apos;s share of the store and later renamed his business Domino&apos;s Pizza. 

I have to ask are they worth the money? A small basic cheese and tomato pizza costs 8.99 which is 6 slices and I think around the 9-10 inch size. If I order this from a local takeaway I expect to pay around 3.50. 

So why is Domino&apos;s so special that people will pay more than twice the cost? 
My...

 Asta la Pizza Baby 

 Advantages: Good taste, very cheap, family fun for all, makes great pizza&apos;s
 Disadvantages: None


...Tesco Pizza Base mix provides a great opportunity to make your own pizza from scratch. This is a cost effective and enjoyable way of making your own food and what&apos;s more you know exactly what is going onto it! These provide great entertainment and fun for kids and offer a great way for familys to bond. I remember making these with my mum when i was a kid and on the plus side they dont make much mess.

Packaging
The box weighs 290g and contains two sachets (145g each) so enough for two pizzas. The sachets are small plastic bags and are packaged into a cardboard box (easy to recycle)

How long does it last?
The shelf life for the mixture is about 8-9 months so its ideal to have in your cupboard for a rainy day if you haven&apos;t got anything to cook.

Price
At just 56p for a box (2 pizzas) you cant go wrong. This is ideal for any...

Review of Tesco Pizza Base Mix 
 
 Pizza Fingers 

 Advantages: Price, taste, easy, no fuss
 Disadvantages: None


...Background:
When I was younger my Mum often bought these and we shared it amongst me, my sister and my brother (he got an extra one because he was a boy...and that somehow meant he deserved more in his eyes!). At that age, the 8 that the pack comes with was plenty for all of us (and as we got a bit older, we simply bought an extra box) and we&apos;d often eat them completely on their own, as something just to pick at when we were hungry. As you can probably guess, and tell from the image on the packaging, they are simply rectangular shaped pizza pieces.

The Brand:
McCain products are always full of quality and are great tasting. The majority of their products involve potatoes and so are things such as chips, jacket potatoes and smilies (which are sorta of waffle consistency potato goods, made in the shape of smiley faces no doubt...
