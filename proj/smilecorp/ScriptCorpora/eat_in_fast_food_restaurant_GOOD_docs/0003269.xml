Why does the receipt show VAT at zero
This means NO VAT can be claimed

Do McDonalds restaurants pay VAT?

Absolutely attrocious. The server didn&apos;t know what she was doing. She added a latte which was not even asked for, then went on to the breakfast menu (the time was 4.45pm). Came home with 4 childrens dinners but 5 had been ordered, which reduced the 5th child to tears. then had to go back for the 5th meal. Not happy!!!!

This is a great two floor fast food restaurant. With new menus and healthy living McDonald’s deserves a look. The store is located at the top of Gosport High Street close to the Bus / Ferry Station. With a vast selection on the menu to choose from, worth popping in for a bite.
Staff were nice and friendly and the service with fast as you would expect with hot food.
