 This page is intended as humor, or comic relief.

The place they/he/she/it probably wanted to send you was to Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas .

Many vandals and trolls roam Wikipedia. But even more create accounts and create pages about whatever they feel like, without even looking at any of the Wikipedia policies and guidelines, even if their article is on how Wikipedia is missing a few puzzle pieces on its logo. This list is for new users and (hopefully) people looking to create a page about any of these things.

The list originally started as a list of, &quot;1,000 things not to write your article about.&quot; Of course, knowing how things on Wikipedia work, we attained 1,000 entries several years ago, and continued to grow beyond 1,000, and eventually to 2,000. So we&apos;ve renamed the list to, &quot;N things not to write your article about.&quot; Those of us that originally started the list think it jumped the shark quite some time ago (either 1,000 or 2,000, depending who you are), but apparently, there are lots of people that have apparently been kidnapped by a band of crazed, hungry Hamsters that are forcing them to write various and sundry mind-numbing entries here. So, if this is the case, then feel free to add new items to the end of the list .

Keep in mind that we&apos;ve all seen a gazillion entries for variants of your mom , comparisons between all of the celebrities that are popular among tween girls , reasons why you, your relatives, or someone in your class is gay , cow tipping , squirrels , reasons why you hate your geometry teacher, overly spammed memes , bathroom humor , and entries about how you should be finishing some sort of school project instead of editing this page at 2:58 am . Entries about Michael Jackson are also getting a bit old, so perhaps it&apos;s best to bury his corpse before it starts to smell bad,...

The list is also monitored, and personal attacks will be swiftly removed. Editors who continue to violate Wikipedia&apos;s policies will be killed and eaten banned.

 Remember to: 

 Avoid severe profanity (aka Things you wouldn&apos;t hear on prime time television ). Read the above guidelines on what to enter. This space is for originality, not test edits. Mind your own business . Don&apos;t tamper with existing entries that have lasted. You can mess with your own edits. Not edit war . If an entry doesn&apos;t fit the aforementioned criteria, it is likely to be deleted. Add to the bottom of the list, but above the category ( DO NOT add to or edit the previous complete lists of 1000; add to the last section ). Make sure stuff you put hasn&apos;t already been put down. Have fun !
