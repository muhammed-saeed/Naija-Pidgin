 Subway’s muddled menu 
 
This is annoying: Subway’s Vegetarian&amp;Seafood page features two seafood sandwiches, one vegetarian sandwich, and the“Cold Cut Combo”(sliced turkey bologna, turkey ham and turkey salami with your choice of vegetables, condiments, etc. served on freshly baked bread). It’s annoying enough that they lump vegetarian with seafood, but then adding a“Cold Cut Combo”that has nothing to do with anything (it’s a“local special”) on the same page really muddles things up.

And where the heck is the VeggieMax that the used to offer? It’s now called the Veggie Patty, but I can’t seem to find it on their web site. I visited a Subway the other night for the first time in well over a year (I instated a personal boycott when they were in bed with Atkins) and they couldn’t tell me what was in the Veggie Patty because they hadn’t saved any of the boxes the patties are shipped in. They literally showed me the patty to show me to see what was in it.“There are carrots in there, I think,”they told me. I ended up having their Veggie Delite with mustard, sans cheese.

To find anything remotely helpful for vegans, you’ve got to go to their “Ingredient Information for People with Food Allergies”PDF . The good news: all their bread is vegan, except for the ones whose names obviously indicate otherwise (“Italian Herbs and Cheese,”“Monterey Cheddar,”and“Parmesan Oregano”). Some sites I’ve seen have said that the wheat bread has honey added to it…not sure, though, since that’s not shown on the allergin chart. It gets a little trickier with their condoments and dressings, as the only vegan choices there are the yellow and brown mustard, oil and vinegar, and sweet onion sauce.

Subway seriously needs to get some faux meats in the mix. And a vegan saffron aioli. Hey, I can dream, right?

I’ve had similar problems with the veggie max. The first time I had one, it was first recommended to me by a vegetarian friend who said he was sure it was vegan. I asked at the counter, and the guy looked annoyed and said“It’s vegetables.”You’d think we weren’t allowed to ask questions about the food we’re eating.

Hi, nice blog!

Every time I got to Subway (not often) I dream of all the yummy stuff I wish they had for the Veggie Delight: shredded cabbage&amp;carrot, leaf lettuce, baby spinach, garbanzo beans or hummus, guacamole, etc. etc. Then it would be *truly* veggie delightful!
 
 Greg Cerveny Mar 31, 2005 at 00:47 
 
My problem with subway started half a dozen years ago when I was trying to decide between the veggie sub and a salad. After deciding I didn’t want to eat a sandwhich made of just toppings I opted for the salad. To my suprise they grabbed a container and started filling it with toppings, and voila salad!

I asked about the VeggieMax at a Subway here ~ it was awhile ago. They said that its available at certain stores on the West Coast but I have no idea if they were just pulling that out of their hmmmmmmuhmmmmm or if thats actually true.
 
 greg Apr 04, 2005 at 12:41 
 
The Veggie Patty is a Gardenburger. You can find nutrititional info on the Subway webpage. Go to http://www.subway.com and do a Google site search for“gardenburger”. In a quick read, I didn’t see that they say what it’s made of, but if it’s a gardenburger, you can track it down from there (I only wanted nutritional info).
 
 Ryan Apr 04, 2005 at 21:42 
 
Thanks, Greg…I have a feeling Gardenburger may be more responsive. I’ll drop them an e-mail.

Hey all,

My subway still carries the veggie max. For those who are Vegan tho, do not eat it; it contains egg whites. I actually worked for them a few years back and didn’t know they had the whites in them. My friend who was Vegan asked to read the bag one day and found out. I am a mere vegetarian as I couldn’t give up egg white, nor honey and a few other items. Just thought the Vegans would want to know that information. So for you all Rock on with the Veggie Delite :0)
 
 Stuart Apr 22, 2005 at 08:55 
 
For everyones information I have found a site here with nutritional data for a veggie max:-

 http://www.bgsm.edu/nutrition/subway.htm 

Peace
 
 Sheila May 05, 2005 at 12:36 
 
I checked the website listed above and the veggie max shows up as having 130 calories. That doesn’t seem right, especially since the Subway website lists it at 390 calories. Does anyone know why there is a Gardenburger and Veggi-Max on the Subway website? What’s the difference?
 
 Sheila May 05, 2005 at 12:43 
 
Actually, I just found the answer to my question. Subway stores might use a Gardenburger patty or a Morningstar Veggie-max patty. You can find more information at this website below.
The site also says that it’s possible to get a soy turkey sub or a vegan boca burger sub at some locations. If anyone’s been able to get one of those, let me know!

Hey,so i was wondering,would subway or any other fast food places carry vegan buns?
 
 Anon May 09, 2005 at 14:15 
 
I’m reasonably certain 3 grams of fat is not right for the Veggie Max. I found a Subway with a nutrition info pamphlet (that I wish I still had) that said the Veggie Max has 8 grams of fat if my memory serves me correctly. I’m virtually certain it had at least 6 grams of fat and I’m 80% sure it has exactly 8 grams of fat since I remember thinking“that’s why it’s not on the’6 grams of fat and under’menu.”
 
 Shelley Nunnery Jun 14, 2005 at 14:54 
 
This is the Veggie Max that they serve at my Subway in Springdale, AR. I caught a glimpse of the package one day and looked up the info on the internet.

 http://www.kelloggs.com/cgi-bin/brandpages/product.pl?product=323&amp;company=23 

Or the ingredient list is:

Ingredients:
Vegetables (mushrooms, water chestnuts, onions, carrots, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, black olives), textured vegetable protein (soy protein concentrate, wheat gluten, water for hydration), egg whites, cooked brown rice (water, brown rice), rolled oats, corn oil, calcium caseinate, soy sauce (water, soybeans, salt, wheat). Contains 2% or less of onion powder, corn starch, salt, hydrolyzed corn, soy, and wheat protein (for flavor), autolyzed yeast extract, natural flavors from non-meat sources, sugar, soy protein isolate, spices, garlic powder, dextrose, jalapeno pepper powder, celery extract.

I think the reason why it is not on their low-fat menu is because they do not carry it in every store.
 
 TEKGOD Jun 28, 2005 at 20:09 
 
Hey guys about the Veggie Max—YES it does have 8 grams of fat (6 inch). As for the rest of the nutritional info I will post it tomorrow since I saved an old Subway Nutritional Guide in PDF format that had the Veggie MAX or Patty or whatever theyre calling it nowadays. The 6 inch sub is about 390 calories,&amp;about 55g of carbs. I may post the rest of the nutritional if anyone requests it.

i find your blog offensive. why on earth would you get mad at minimum wage teeangers if they dont know every ingredient in the food? they are just trying to make some money so they can do stuff like buy a computer, like you have, etc etc. let me guess, did you do it during lunch rush? i bet you then got offended they werent working fast enough?
 
 Ryan Jul 31, 2005 at 17:21 
 
Actually, I was only asking them to check for me. I wasn’t expecting them to know it off the top of their head.

And as for when I was ordering, actually, it was about 9:30pm in the middle of nowhere and there was one other person in the restaurant. All the workers were standing around looking bored.

Hi, all! After an experience I had yesterday with a Subway in my town, I thought I’d go looking for some info on the VeggieMax patty and voila!–I found a group of not-so-satisfied Subway customers! I live in a small, somewhat southern (read:redneck) town, where apparently not too many people are vegetarians. When I visited a large city close to where I live, I was delighted to see that Subway offered a veggie meat. As soon as I arrived home, I called all the local Subways and finally found one that had the VeggieMax patty. So I immediatly drove to it and began to order. When I said I wanted a Veggie sub with the VeggieMax patty, the girl looked at me and said,“We don’t have those.”I gave her a you-better-be-kidding-me look and told her I’d just called about it. Her response–”Oh, we have some in the freezer, but they’re so old, I can’t serve them to you. No one’s ever asked for one.”

And to think I had built up faith in Subway and my podunk town. What a shame. And then they tried to charge me fifty cents for spinach! Is spinach a rarity in the South?! Or are they really just trying to screw me over? I think we all know the answer.

Wow, that was rambling and pointless. Sorry for the jabbering. Oh, and about the Veggie Burger at Burger King–not to disappoint, but it’s not vegan. I know, it’s heartbreaking.
 
 Darwin Aug 02, 2005 at 23:07 
 
I can confirm the veggie patty is available at stores throughout the San Francisco Bay Area in California.

=darwin
 
 Jackie Aug 21, 2005 at 17:24 
 
the veggiemax is also available in some Long Island areas.
 
 Peter Aug 22, 2005 at 03:40 
 
I’m vegan and I work for Subway. This is the first I have heard of Subway carring a veggie burger. The wheat bread does in fact have honey in it. Vegans should only eat the Italian and the Hearty Italian.

Also Burger King uses Morningstar Farms Garden Veggie Patties ( http://www.bk.com/food/index.aspx#buildid=122 ) but I don’t have more details.
 
 Jennifer Aug 23, 2005 at 14:21 
 
I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but I am interested in some lower fat and cholesterol food choices, so I have been doing some research into what the best tasting vegetarian foods are and where to buy them. Any ideas?
Also, where can you find the caloric content of some of these yummy veggie foods?
 
 Shelly Aug 27, 2005 at 13:07 
 
I’ve been reading your blog for about six months now. Thanks for publishing it. I went vegan for six months about a year and half ago after accidentally stumbling onto the KFC butcher horror film, but with two kids who refused to give up cheese and egg sandwiches, I switched to ovo-lacto veg a year ago, buying only cage free eggs and rennet free cheese. (We all do the best we can!)

Eating fast food as a veggie has been more of a challenge than I expected; what with fries cooked in lard and veggie patties fried on the same grill as beef burgers, it’s hard to know what you can eat. I never expect the regular employees to know what’s in the food; I always ask for a manager, and sometimes they don’t even know. But I’ve never had trouble at Subway, and my family now eats there about 2-3 times per month. Because Subways are franchised, each store may have different items and pricing policies, so just call around to find one you like. Our favorite Subway restaurant does carry things like red and green cabbage, spinach, pine nuts, carrot shreds, etc. and doesn’t charge extra for them if they are the substitute for the meat. They do not carry the veggiemax patty; I’ve never heard of it and I live in Southern California. The only thing our Subway charges us extra for is avocado. But I had to call around to a half dozen Subways to find the one we like.

Hi
this is the first time I have ever posted to a board plz forgive any faux pas. I just called Subway as I have had the same problem W./ the veggie max there is calcium casinate, egg white, wheat, oat, soy
I just listed animal products and common allergens
Thanks for the board
 
 Carla Cox Sep 20, 2005 at 16:12 
 
P.S. the Veggie max is only in certain areas.

In response to Holly’s post…that’s a shame, I’m sorry your Subway didn’t have what you wanted. I’ve been working for them for four months (not a teenager, btw) and just as an aside, the veggie patties probably do come frozen, as are most of the meats other than lunch meats. Frozen product is taken out to thaw, then placed on the line and kept no more than 48 hours (72 hours for seafood and tuna). Then it is chunked in the garbage—freshness issues. If you could gather a few of your vegan/veggie friends together and give that Subway the business on a regular basis, they’d probably make it a point to keep some on the line.

If no one has wanted one for as long as they’ve carried the product (promoting it is another issue), they would have been wasting food and money the entire time.

And yes, most of the teen workers probably don’t know answers to questions like these, or how to find out. Most managers should know or make it their business to do so. Many of us do care, and do try to take care of our customers…there really are those who enjoy the food industry and serving up a quality product. Honest!

I visited southern califonia a few months back from the east coast and found that they had subways with the veggie max…In san diego and LA…
 
 beetle Dec 01, 2005 at 20:41 
 
OK, vegan means you don’t eat ANYTHING with animal products in it, right?
But you’re eating a sub sandwich…on bread?
Aren’t there animal products in bread?
 
 Ryan Dec 01, 2005 at 23:18 
 
Beetle—Some bread has animal products in it (sometimes egg, sometimes milk products, sometimes honey), but a lot doesn’t. Artisan breads (the really good stuff) usually does. Bread at its most basic is flour, water, sugar, salt, and yeast.
 
 james Dec 06, 2005 at 00:38 
 
i think pretty much every subway in the UK has veggiemax. guess were pretty lucky
 
 Garrett Dec 11, 2005 at 21:55 
 
I work at subway. I am a vegetarian. If someone asked me what was in it i would probably laugh and say“not meat.”We are underpaid and underappreciated. It really sort of sucks, but I do get free subs and salads. That is the one perk I do enjoy.
 
 Amanda Jan 09, 2006 at 12:00 
 
Thanks for all the great info–I too have been frustrated with the lack of Veggie info on the Subway site. I have found that VeggieMax or Veggie Patty is available in DC but not in Coneecticut. It wasnt available in the Midwest where I was trapped for about 4months–a place where“I’m a vegetarian”is responded to with“oh your vegetarian–then have chicken”. Anyway, the BK Veggie is a tasty MorningStar Veggie Patty. Veg Times said a year or so ago that McD’s was adding a McVeggie to the menu. Has anyone see it?
 
 Nila Jan 12, 2006 at 13:48 
 
This is a great blog. Wonderful to see hear from fellow vegeterians. Thanks for all the info.

I have been able to get the Veggie Patty in Maryland, Ohio, Minnesota, Utah.

It will great if McDonalds can include a McVeggie. I liked the apples and walnuts thing they started–They serve a delectable Veggie Burger in India…(Non Soy–real potatoes&amp;veggies–real calorific). Also the Subway there has a varied veggie menu which also includes the Falafel and Hummus amongst others.
 
 Joey Sneddon Jan 16, 2006 at 18:13 
 
Hi–i’m in teh UK.. so does anyone know which products are WHOLLY vegan then?
 
 Rhonda Jan 17, 2006 at 11:11 
 
I live in southeastern South Dakota, and this is the first I’ve heard that Subway has a veggie patty. I’ve been to the Subway in my town, and one in a nearby town. They only have the Veggie Delight, which after awhile is no delight at all. Just boring.
 
 Maynard S. Clark Jan 17, 2006 at 12:59 
 
Why dine out? Why not a network of local vegetarian cooking clubs where we could meet our regular friends regularly, prepare the veggie food together, save money, catch up, and build our local networks?
 
 Shy Lalumiere Jan 20, 2006 at 19:48 
 
I am a manager at a group of Subways in California, and I am vegan. We do have the Veggie Max Patty (recently switched over from GardenBurger.) How we have always handled these (as they don’t get ordered often) is that we keep them in the freezer, and then warm them up in the microwave on an as-needed basis. We’ve had toaster ovens for about 15 months now, and if they want them toasted, we heat them halfway in the microwave and then toast them. We’ve been selling a lot more lately, b/c when we made the switch to Kellogg’s, they sent out menu footers that we could put up. I did, and I think that made a big difference.

We get a decent amount of vegans that come through as customers, and in the past more than half of our crew has been vegetarian and vegan, so my store in particular is very vegan-friendly. I make sure everyone knows what is not vegan just in case customers ask. This is most useful with the local Indian population, as a lot of them are vegan for religious reasons.
 
 Darwin Feb 03, 2006 at 17:22 
 
I mentioned earlier on the thread that the Veggie Patties were available in the San Francisco Bay Area.. most of the local stores appear to have switched from the Garden Burger patty to the VeggieMax patty. I couldn’t be happier, because the VeggieMax is really delicious and the Gardenburger patty was tasteless..

I just started working at Subway today. I’m a vegetarian. We get a free six inch sub every shift we work. I got the veggiemax (I live in New England, we’re liberals and we like that sort of thing)…Anyway, I’m kind of grossed out to hear about all the saturated fat and stuff in it. I also noticed we have to put cheese on before meat…and since the cheese sticks together so much, I was told to pick up a stack and play with it until it unstuck….I told my manager that stuff like this really freaks out vegetarians…She said that it use to be cheese before meat but the company changed it around and there was really nothing she could do…Needless to say, if you’re squeemish about meat touching your food like I am, I’d say skip the cheese no matter what…And if you watch your fat and calories like I do…Avoid the veggiemax.
 
 Trushar Feb 23, 2006 at 09:00 
 
Hey,

I think that this Blog is really great.
I am a vegetarian from the UK and enjoy the Veggie Max. I wanted to know if it is possible to buy a Veggie Paaty Salad (NO BREAD). If so, what would be the nutrional information?

Many thanks,

Trush!

Hi,

I’m not a vegan, but I am on weightwatchers and was totally searching for the vegimax nutritional value. I was so happy when I saw the nutritional value on the morning star box, but then became sad when I looked at the email from subway about the calorie content. I guess I’ll stick to the veggie delight for lunch time. Great investigating guys!
 
 John Mar 20, 2006 at 15:41 
 
IT IS UNFOTUNATE THAT s-SUBWAY DOES NOT OFFER A VEGAN VEGGIEBURGER. ACCORDING TO PETA, TEH BURGER AT BURGER KING is VEGAN, AND THERE ARE MANY COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED VEGAN BURGERS THAT SUBWAY COULD USE.
 
 Danielle Mar 20, 2006 at 22:14 
 
Actually, the veggie patty at Murder King is no longer vegan. They changed the formulation with little or no fanfare. Even so, the bun on which it’s served isn’t vegan.
 
 Rachel Mar 23, 2006 at 17:06 
 
The problem I had at Subway was the person in front of me ordered a meatball sub and then when the employee made my sandwich, she dug her hands into the lettuce bin with the meatball sauce still on her gloves, so it was all through my“veggie”sandwich. I never went back–I just can’t think of any polite way to guarantee my meal will be prepared properly.

It’s mostly this accidental“contamination”factor that keeps me out of fast food places and restaurants as a vegetarian–I’ve had it happen so many times. It’s unfortunate that people just don’t realize how important it is to some of us to keep the meat contained. Personally, I’ve decided it’s healthier, safer and cheaper to prepare my own food pretty much all of the time, but that’s a hassle that’s certainly not for everyone.

Anyway, it’s nice to have found so many like-minded people here!
 
 Oscar Mar 27, 2006 at 18:55 
 
I live in Mexico (where VeggieMax is not available) , and I usually find myself getting across just to have a veggiemax Sub, I discovered it by accident 3 years ago in San Diego, CA. I’ve been hooked to it since!!!
In 2005 many of the San Diego area Subway stores began discontinuing the veggie max pattie, as they told me the demand for it had dropped. I can still find it around some College and Universities locations. I really wish it became more available, and maybe that could be accomplished if more information were available to the customers, I find that many stores have it listed under the ever so tiny“Local Specials”Menu or not listed at all, so you have to ask for it (Maybe they have a couple in the freezer).

Anyways, hopefully we’ll soon find a TV ad that features the Veggie Max Sub, instead of the“Carne Asada Steak Sub”.

Keep Posting =D
 
 Holly Apr 23, 2006 at 01:54 
 
The nutritional information from the Subway email does include the bread and all the vegetable toppings…390 for the entire sandwich…Apparently the bread is 200 calories itself, leaving 190 for everything else (patty included).

I’m in Vancouver, Canada and almost every Subway has the Veggie Max. Never seen one without…a lot have it advertised too.

I live in Seattle, which is pretty much the epicenter of vegetarian resources. I can have any vegetarian or vegan product I want, but I still crave Subway veggie patty subs. I just had one for lunch (I’m a lacto-ovo vegetarian), and it was delightful.

From numerous cross-country trips, I can tell you how to up your chances of finding veggie patties where you are:

1. Don’t go to the Subway within another buisness (like a gas station, a mall, or a truck stop), chances are good that they won’t have it. Go to a stand-alone franchise.

2. Ask them if they have veggie patties, and if not, do they have some in the freezer? Most of the time, they do, they just don’t know it.

3. If they don’t have‘em ask. Ask the next time you come. Have your friends ask. It took 10 asks in 2 weeks at a Subway in a small town I was working in,’til they got them.

4. If you live in Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, Vermont, New Hampshire, England (London), Germany, Nevada, Iowa (DesMoines), New York, Washington DC, or Ohio—your stores have them, or at least have access to them.

5. Again, if your store doesn’t have them, ask the manager to add them to the menu. All they have to do is add it to their restock requests.

Hope this helps.

SarahinSeattle….were you able to find out what the nutrition facts are for the Subway Veggie Burger? I’m referring to the frozen oblong burger with rounded corners.

I’m not a total vegan, but I am on the Dr. Dean Ornish program for reversing/preventing heart disease and we don’t eat anything that contains animal products except egg whites and skim milk (these are extremely low in the“bad”fats). I know, the Vegans won’t like me for this….sorry. I guess I could actually give up skim milk and egg whites……….I wouldn’t have a big problem doing that.

I would appreciate any information you might be able to provide me on the nutrition facts (taken from the label of Subway’s Veggy Patty).

I need everything the standard“Nutrition Facts”label contains for the Subway Veggie Burger. Most food products contain must contain this nutritional information label.

Thanks to anyone who can help me on this project. You will make me a hero with my Ornish group if you can provide me this information.
 
 Danielle May 19, 2006 at 21:47 
 
Tom, good for you. I believe any reduction in animal products is a step in the right direction. I don’t know what Dr. Ornish says about plant milks, but if you can find a low-fat one, go for it. I have seen“lite”soy milks, and almond milk has a very similar consistency to skim milk (from what I remember of skim cow’s milk). I just wouldn’t use almond milk in savory dishes because it’s kind of sweet.

As for egg whites, you can make scrambles with tofu and lots of veggies, and there are tons of substitutes if you are baking or cooking.

I don’t have info on the Subway patty–is it not on their Web site?
 
 Cate May 24, 2006 at 12:55 
 
Bonnie, Thank you so much for pursuing Subway until they finally gave you the ingredients for the mysterious veggie patty. I have been told the same story as several other people;“sorry we don’t save the boxes, we don’t know the ingredients.”And why don’t they update their website with this information?

Anyway, thanks for finally solving the mystery.

Cate
 
 Tom Jun 02, 2006 at 19:47 
 
Thanks Danielle. I do use soy milk and I love it. But those on the Ornish program cannot drink but 8 oz a day….and as you know, that’s not a lot. But, in addition, the Ornish program does allow a small amount of animal fat, only egg whites and skim milk….and a very limited quantity of these. I understand where you’re coming from….I really shouldn’t be eating“any animal fats”…..and I probably don’t really have to. So, I will more than likely“join”the Vegans and stop using egg whites and skim milk….that’s all I need to do to become a true“vegan”. Wish me luck. Do you guys take any vitamins or other supplements? We’re told to take a daily multi-vitamin like Centrum….and 1000 mg of fish oil a day in capsule form. What’s your feeling about fish oil (omega 3)? Thanks for the support.
 
 Danielle Jun 14, 2006 at 21:44 
 
Tom, a good source of omega-3 fatty acids is flax oil. You can sprinkle it on cooked veggies or use in a salad dressing, but do NOT–I repeat, DO NOT–ever cook with it. You can also grind up flax seeds to sprinkle on foods or in a smoothie, if your diet allows such things. I think walnuts also have omega-3s, as do soybean products, though not as much.

I just got back from a frustrating trip to two different Subway restaurants and finding this blog nearly made me cry with joy.

I live in rural western Pennsylvania (where the“chicken ain’t meat”mentality rules) and have for years been ordering the veggie patty from Subways in the area. I saw it on a menu in Seattle and they told me to ask for it at home.

At the Subway I frequent, today the girl I tried to order one from looked at me funny, went in the back and came out and said“we don’t sell those.”I explained that I’d had one last week and she just shrugged and said she’d already asked the manager, a man who has built my veggie sub before.

I left in a tizzy and drove two miles to the next town and a different Subway. The girl behind the counter there also looked confused and went in the back and came out with another sandwich artist and…a veggie patty.

The boy said he didn’t even know they had them and the girl, Indian by the way like the manager at the other one, said they aren’t on the menu because“they are just for us because there is no meat.”
I explained that I didn’t eat meat either and never had a problem ordering them before.

I don’t quite know what to make of this. There are very few options for me (an ovo-lacto-pescovegetarian only because without fish proteins I’d be stuck with only beans and no one wants that) here and people are very rude when you ask for details about things.

When I simmer down, I might call the manager at the first Subway or just go straight to the district manager. Or I might just give up going there period after this. Any ideas?

Why don’t they market them? I know plenty of people who’d eat the veggie burgers if they knew they were available. In fact, more than once a surprised worker has told me they were going to try it themselves.

Anyhow, sorry this is so long. I love you all.
Peace.

Hello! does anyone know what ingredients are in the veggie patty that is sold in UK Subway branches? :o)x
 
 sunita Jun 27, 2006 at 10:02 
 
Katie

the veggie patty sold in the UK is the same as in the US (&amp;used to be called a‘veggie max’a few years ago, though seems to be called‘veggie patty’now). It would be vegan, apart from egg whites as someone mentions above

It seems to be made of grains&amp;soy protein as far as I can tell…
 
 KatieP Jun 27, 2006 at 10:44 
 
Thanks Sunita!

Hi again :o)

Is the Veggie Patty from Subway nice?

To Courtlyn:

Um, yeah. If you eat fish, you’re not vegetarian. You just don’t eat red meat or poultry. Please attempt to refrain from further confusing the ignorant general public about the meanings of“vegetarian”and“vegan.”

Also, you don’t need fish for protein. Excellent non-animal sources of protein are soy, nuts, beans, and even some veggies. I recommend http://www.vegweb.com for more information and good recipes.

I understand that most individuals fall victim to the propoganda of the food industry that tells us that we need to consume meat and dairy in order to get enough protein, or else risk wasting away. In reality, however, most Americans get TOO MUCH protein. Excessive protein intake is extremely hard on the kidneys and has been linked to osteoporosis (no matter what the BS“Got Milk”ads want you to believe.) I went ovo-lacto vegetarian 9 years ago, and decided to stop being a half-ass and made the switch to vegan a little over a year ago. I am happy to say that I have had no adverse health problems and I do not look like a starving Ethiopian. On the contrary, my digestive problems have completely gone away (I have a diagnosis of Crohn’s Disease), my issues with kidney stones have been a non-issue, and I managed to drop 30 extra pounds by pretty much not doing a damn thing except eating whatever vegan foods I like. I look and feel more amazing than I ever have in my entire life. I highly recommend you researching cutting out animal products from your diet, or at least fish.

But if you don’t, please refrain from calling yourself a vegetarian. We need to inform the general public, not confuse them further. I personally am sick and tired of people thinking that I can eat chicken or fish on a vegan diet as long as I drink soymilk.

Thanks.

John mentioned that the Burger King patty is vegan, but FYI–Burger King (I do like the name Murder King better…) explicitly does not promise that its ostensibly non-meat products conform to vegetarian standards, at least in the US. So, before you enjoy the veggie burger there, keep in mind that it’s cooked with all the regular meat burgers, or at least likely contaminated by people who work with both.
 
 KatieP Jul 02, 2006 at 13:47 
 
Soya milk and soya products generally give me terrible headaches! anyone else have the same problem?

Thanks :o)
 
 KatieP Jul 07, 2006 at 04:56 
 
Hi all! :o) I emailed Subway about the ingredients of the UK veggie patty, and had this reply:

 fiaku Jul 15, 2006 at 23:06 
 
Hi, I just wanted to let you guys know that some of the Subway grunts do care about what they serve. {Please don’t stereotype food service workers-I’m a college student trying to pay for school). I work for one in Lynchburg, VA (Old Forest Road). This blog has been really helpful, because I wanted to find out what was in a Veggie Max (the boxes always get taken out before I come to work and I don’t really want to dumpster dive)“Big Subway”doesn’t keep“little subways”as informed as many of our patrons would like. I realize that, but we try. It’s really frustrating for us to say“I don’t know,”look at all the charts, brochures, ask the manager, still not find the answer to your question, then the customer still gets upset. It’s not my fault. By all means ask questions, but please don’t get upset if we don’t know the answer. That’s the biggest reason I hate getting asked questions.
I mostly want to find out if and how I can make a veggie max patty at home. I’m not a vegan OR vegetarian (I’m an occasional meat eater), but I love the Veggie Max more than any other sub there. I’ve tried several veggie burger recipes, but haven’t really found one that is close to Veggie max. If you have a good recipe for a veggie patty/burger would you mind emailing a copy to me? Thanks! fiaku@hotmail.com 
 
 Xavier Jul 24, 2006 at 12:45 
 
The subway at the corner of King and John in Toronto has veggie patties (I know, I work there). And it is true what fiaku said, just because we work in fast food it does not mean that we are uncaring about what we serve. I am vegetarian, and I encourage my customers to make healthy choices when they choose their meals, but if they want a double meat BMT (which has 16 pieces of meat to start with, so double that: 32) with a whole bunch of high fat sauces on top, then it is my job to make it for them. It sucks to watch people poison their bodies, but I have to pay for med school somehow, and the tuition is not cheap.
 
 Jackie Boy Jul 27, 2006 at 15:31 
 
That sucks that the patties aren’t vegan, I just became vegan recently and one of the reasons I did it was because of those delicious protein filled veggie patties.DANNG!
 
 Scott Aug 02, 2006 at 04:55 
 
Hey, i am a vegetarian that works at subway. The veggi patty that we carry contains dried egg whites. The only bread suitable for vegans is the itialian (white), unless you eat honey in which case you can have the wheat bread and the honey/oat bread. Vegans can also have our sweet onion sauce, mustard,sub sauce and hot sauce.

for the hell of it: is my rant on subway…. People expect to loose weight by coming to subway. I dont see how you can do this when half of the people get sub sauce and mayo, especially if you get alot (most do). I calculated that if you get one table spoon of each per inch on a footlong sub ( this may sound like a lot but when spreaded out is close to average) you are taking in a rounded 2000 calories and 130 g of fat!!! rethink getting those sauces next time and maybe try something fat free liek honey mustard or sweet onion

For all of you that are health conscious, only the wheat bread and the honey oat bread DO NOT have partially hydrogenated oil! this is pretty bad that the rest do, very harmful stuff, just to let you all know
 
 Nadia Aug 19, 2006 at 14:35 
 
Why have they stopped the Veggie Patty, its like the onli veggy one which is nice??? does any1 know da reason?
 
 abbie Aug 25, 2006 at 07:58 
 
hey. i work in subways, and weve stooped selling veggie pattys after the company withdrew them. our boss told us that it was because theyd been contaminating them with leftover fluids from the chipotle southwest cheese steak after the meat had been reconstituted. i was unsure whether this was true or not, but havent touched one since. the veggie delites are much nicer anyways, but dont be afraid to ask staff to change their gloves for you, or use a fresh batch of cheese, its regulation for us to do so. cheers guys X
 
 Tom Barrister Feb 09, 2007 at 18:07 
 
For the record, the Subway breads no longer contain trans fats, nor do any of the cheeses used.

However, the Veggie Patty does contain some dried egg whites, so it’s technically not vegan.
 
 Allison Apr 17, 2007 at 19:33 
 
Hey everyone-

I work at a Subway store, and I hope I can help ya’ll out. The patty (WHICH I LOVE!) is NOT vegan. It contains a calcium supplement that comes from animals, and also eggs.

The patty does mostly contain vegetables including mushrooms, potatoes, carrots, peppers and olives, and also grains. However, while the boxes that they come in DO list the ingredients (i can send ya’ll a complete list), they don’t list the nutrition facts. And, the veggie patty is not listed on the morningstar farms website…intruiging.

hope this helps.

Personally, I avoid going to fast food restaurants, or restaurants of any kind, altogether.

However, if I ever have NO CHOICE but to go to Subway, I usually just get a salad loaded with tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and carrots, but without any dressing. Boring, but I survive.

One thing that annoys me is the fact that the only vegan bread there is the ITALIAN…which is white flour. ARGH. I don’t personally believe in refined foods, so if you’re okay with white bread that’s just fine. Still real annoying, though.

Also, as for this whole veggie-burger-not-being-vegan burger ordeal- WHY DON’T THESE COMPANIES JUST MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS VEGAN? The use of egg white just misses the point. It’s pretty much as if they had used chicken flesh, in my opinion.

(just my own two cents)
 
 Kallie Apr 24, 2007 at 17:30 
 
Hello!
Thanks for the blog and thanks everyone for your wonderful responses. I am vegan and had read somewhere that the veggie patty was vegan, so I have been eating it!!! All of the misinformation caused by subway not listing the ingredients angers me! I am going to avoid subway unless I am traveling and have no other option but the veggie delite.
Thanks everyone, stay strong…we are all the better for avoiding animal products!

I’d like to call myself a veggie patty connoisseur. I discovered them when I lived in Chicago. They have an awesome topping in Chicago subways called Giardinera. Try it if you get the chance- veggie patties and giardinera are like to lovers meeting in the night. Like most foods in Chicago, totally not healthy though.

So I moved back to Ohio recently and have been frequenting my local subway. They didn’t even have veggie patty on the menu but they still carried it. One day, it suddenly showed up on the “local favorites” menu, and I’d like to think that was because of me- I mean I’m in there everyday. I never knew what was in them until I stumbled onto this blog, so I’d like to thank everyone for their studious research into this veggie patty matter.

I would just like to share a side note- I’m not quite sure why I’ve been obsessed with subway lately- perhaps it’s because I thought they stood for something truly revolutionary these day- the concern for overweight people and attempting to become healthy. But did anyone seem to notice that as soon as their “FIT” campaign started, their low-carb wraps went away. The wraps are now almost as bad for you as the bread. For those of us who want to limit how much non-whole wheat bread we intake because it converts directly into sugar, the low carb wrap was a seemingly nice alternative. NOPE. Forget it. Subway doesn’t care about you. The wraps we have now are about the same as eating two slicese of wonder bread in my opinion. Man, those LC wraps were so good too. Plain and simple- subway is still fast food no matter how they want to spin it. Their bread is not made from whole grains and they’ll pile on the mayo for a morbidly obese guy anytime day or night.

I am a vegetarian and have been wanting to find the ingredients for the veggie pattie for some time now. This site is great, yet I have found out that unfortunately I cannot eat it as I don’t eat anything from the onion or garlic family. What a pity! Although I am not vegan I would love to see a vegan burger without onion or garlic, now that would be heaven!

The Garden burger patty has MSG in it. Just FYI. One of the secret names of msg is“autolyzed yeast.”You can read about it in the book titled“Excito Toxins.”

Note: I saw this ingredient in the post (above) from
Wednesday, September 21, 2005——

——-In response to your question the Ingredients and nutritional information for
the Gardenburger and VegiMax are as follows:

Gardenburger:

Mushrooms, brown rice, onions, rolled oats, part-skim mozzarella, cottage
cheese curd, egg white, cheddar cheese, bulgar wheat, natural seasonings and
spices, autolyzed yeast, sea salt, olive oil, tapioca starch, and vegetable
gum.
 
 Bree Jul 19, 2007 at 14:15 
 
It is true–the veggie patty is available at some random Subways on the west coast. I live in San Diego&amp;work in Riverside county, and unfortunately, where you would think San Diego would carry it due to our healthy“beach bodies”, they no longer do, however, I have found it at 2 Subways in Temecula (Riverside Co), which is good for me since I work up there, I have it for lunch. But I might add–I’m eating one right now, and something in my sandwich tasted a little like I imagine unleaded gasoline would. I’m grossed out…I think the bottom line is, unfortunately, if you want to eat healthy, and be absolutely sure what exactly it is that you’re eating–you need to make it yourself. Or, go to Jimbo’s (health food grocer) if you have one around–Their very veggie sandwich is absolutely delicious, and they use organic veggies, meats&amp;whatever else they can get their hands on whenever possible. And for you vegans–they even have their own line of“veganaise”(delicious) and an entire menu dedicated to vegan&amp;vegitarian sandwiches. (Can you imagine having more than one option??!!)
 
 Bree Jul 19, 2007 at 14:28 
 
Oh–Star–

I just read your entry. Your agressive response to someone else’s entry is exactly what turns people off to vegetarianism in the first place. We seem to have a stereotype of being agressive extremists, and I think that’s pretty much due to the fact that some people get carried away ranting and raving to others. I’ve been there, and done that, and found that most people will approach you with inquisitions as to your lifestyle, ex:“what on earth do you eat if you don’t eat meat?”, if you just order&amp;eat what it is you choose, and let them do their own. No one likes to be told how to live, even if you think you are (or even if are) doing them a favor. More often than not, if they’re not asking for your opinion, it won’t have any effect on them if you dish it. I understand your passion for the subject–I think anyone that has chosen a meat-free lifestyle does, and rather than scold someone for the misuse of a term, maybe try to be stoked that one more person isn’t eating red meat or poultry–Just a thought.
 
 Bree Jul 19, 2007 at 14:31 
 
One more thing Star–She specified pesco-vegetarian. That is including the fact that she eats fish (with vertebrae), and vegetables. ie: pisces
 
 dermax Jul 31, 2007 at 09:32 
 
quit complaining. subway is to appeal to the mass market, and the mass market is full of normal people who will eat meat.
 
 Tara Aug 14, 2007 at 16:20 
 
Whoever wrote the last comment is an idiot. Only the ignorant and cruel human beings eat meat and unfortunately thats the majority. I spose if the majority was jumpin of bridges he’d do it too.

By the way, in regards to the Subway Vegi Patty, I like the taste a lot, but Ive noticed that Ive gained weight since I started eating them. Obviously they taste good because they’re more than just veggies.
 
 Carla Sep 05, 2007 at 13:51 
 
I really enjoyed this information, I am not a vegetarian, I do eat meat and am not an ignorant or cruel human being. I am working on a healthier diet and find the information available from vegetartians to be very helpful to balance what will work best for me. Great information–please keep giving us the facts! Thanks!
 
 Suzy Sep 07, 2007 at 00:17 
 
Hi all,
I am the owner of three Subway restaurants and I serve the Veggie Max in all three of my stores. I am not a vegetarian (and don’t have any problem with those who are) but I LOVE the Veggie Max. They are sooooo good.
As you all may know each Subway restaurant is individually owned and operated, we have local markets who vote on which sandwiches to place on their menu under local favourites. I would recommend to you all that you ask the manager or owner of your local Subway for the Development Agents information you can express to them that you would like to see the Veggie Max on the window and maybe they can convinvce the board to vote it on.
Good luck to all.

In response to the question about what a vegan needs to eat to supplement his/her diet: the only thing that a vegan needs is b12. This is only found in meat and animal products (dairy and eggs). Luckily there is a vegan version derived from bacteria. Actually it turns out (after reading about this a little), that all B12 comes from bacteria. Meat has it because animals eat the bacteria in plants.

In reponse to Carla
&gt;&gt;I am not a vegetarian, I do eat meat and am not an ignorant or cruel human being.
what do you call a person who is cognizant of the cruelties inherent in the meat industry and continues to support it regardless.
 
 Becci Sep 13, 2007 at 12:25 
 
Tim–Maybe Carla ISN’T aware of the inherent cruelties of meat production. One way to ensure that she will never bother to learn is to insult her. I understand your anger but seriously, please calm down.
 
 tim Sep 13, 2007 at 13:29 
 
My mistake. I wanted to point out the apparent contradiction in Carla’s statement. What I meant to say is *allegedly cognizant or someone who *claims to be in the know, rather than cognizant for sure. Leaving Carla aside for a moment, there are a lot of people I’ve encountered in my life who are indeed aware of these hideous practices and flaunt their meat-eating as someone who is too“cool”to possess any feelings or sentiment.
 
 Emma Sep 22, 2007 at 14:56 
 
I just had the veggie-max pattie today at my subway in mid-town st. louis and it was not very good. I wouldn’t get it again; I couldn’t really taste it and it felt like I was eating sausage Ew! *sickened shudder*
Just thought I would put that out there….
 
 Becci Sep 24, 2007 at 03:59 
 
tim–Yes, you ARE so right. I have met way too many people like that. I sometimes think that maybe those are the ones who are bothered most of all by their meat-eating, and are trying to cover it up by acting tough. Doesn’t really make me dislike them less, though.
 
 Jody Sep 30, 2007 at 18:18 
 
Yeah, I like the Veggie patty. I hear it is pretty fattening, but so are a lot of things. The thing that bugs me, is that the price on the menu at the local subway says 3.29, but is listed in their computer as 3.49. I have to point out to the cashier every time I go in that the price is wrong. They usually argue with me, telling me that since the computer says it, it must me the right price. In conclusion, corporations are stupid.
 
 Jared Oct 02, 2007 at 18:51 
 
Wow, this has turned into a discussion board.

I grew up in Texas and only moved out of state when I went to graduate school in New Hampshire. It’s hard to say for sure, but it seems like about 50% of the Subways in the Dallas/Fort Worth area carry the Veggie-Max. Same goes for Houston.

My experience in New England was crappy. You’d think with so many hippies in that part of the country that they’d be carrying it there, but you’d think wrongly. I was quite happy to return to Texas, a supposedly unenlightened home of Republican savagery, where the Veggie-Max is more plentiful.

I became a vegetarian in the Summer of 2002, a vegan in the Spring of 2004, and a ????? in the Fall of 2006. I now limit myself to non-tetrapod, non-cephalopod plants, fungi, and animals. Alas, there is no common term to describe me.

Although I understand the need for words to be rigorously defined, it would also be nice if terms were defined with more respect to their etymologies. Shouldn’t the term“vegetarian”exclude someone who drinks milk or eats animal gametes?

My reason for eating seafood on occasion is that I spent several years as a strict veg[etari]an, and I got really sick of being the annoying one in the crowd when there was any kind of social eating. I concluded that it was doing more harm than good to the cause. What would be better? Ten people setting an example of reducing support for industries which are cruel to animals yet not being completely, 100% vegan? Or 1 vegan who pisses off everyone around them and makes many people resent veganism? Those are pretty much your choices in this current era.

If in living as a vegan you’re always pissing off everybody around you, you’re either doing something wrong or have a lot of intolerant, mean-spirited friends.

Not to sound like the Vegan Police in regards to being the perfect vegan, and I DEFINITELY see your point insofar as diplomacy goes, but I think that by narrowing down the situation to such a depressing dilemma you’re giving up too quickly.

Scenario: Company lunch or dinner, everyone wants to go to a restaurant that is extremely non-vegan-friendly, except for me. There isn’t a single vegan entrée on the menu, and the only way to cobble together a meal would be to order several low protein,“low rent”side orders. No thanks. What do you expect to happen? I’m not going to participate in events like that any longer. I refuse to sacrifice my nutrition for the sake of a cause that is best fought in other ways.

My friends are more tolerant, of course. There’s also the fact that I lived with my parents for the better part of 2006, and they live in the middle of nowhere. I was looking for a job out there, and there were very few vegan options anywhere nearby. I did the best I could with soymilk and what soy-based meat substitutes I could find, but not everywhere is amenable to this kind of thing as ultra-liberal cities like Seattle and Austin.

I wasn’t the one narrowing down the situation to that dilemma. That’s reality, and anyone who lives as the lone vegan as I have (and still do, in some sense) amongst a sea of chicken/cow/pig eaters will know what I’m talking about. It’s really facile to live a vegan lifestyle when you have a support network or perhaps merely a polite group of friends which live and let live. It’s quite another when you live among“normal”(in the statistical sense, not the normative sense) people who are ethically unenlightened in the context of animal cruelty.

There’s a perfectly good reason why Vegi and Seafood are lumped together…

IT’S CAUSE THERE’S ONLY 1 VEGITARIAN SANDWICH!!!

Do you honestly think that 1 sandwich deserves it’s own whole section?

Get a life before you die of malnutrician you sad vegi freak.
 
 ryan Oct 10, 2007 at 13:07 
 
When was the last time a vegetarian died of malnutrition? Probably quite a while ago.

When was the last time someone came here with a chip on their shoulder and a really poor penchant for grammar and spelling? Why, just today!

i’m sick of these fast food workers bitching about people asking about ingredients. no offesnse to all the fast food workers of the world, but i’ve worked shitty jobs too, and you never know, some people have allergies and what not. i personally don’t, i’m just a psycho ovo veg….but still. FUCK I GET ANGRY WHEN IT COMES TO MY FOOD!!!

 bloglogger Oct 18, 2007 at 15:22 
 
Pardon my spelling. I just think it’s kinda comical, people getting all up in arms because a teenager working minimum wage type jobs doesn’t know his ingredients. The world will now end.

I am sorry, veganism is elitism gone full circle.

If you are what you eat, and I eat only vegan cows, doesn’t that make me a vegan?

btw…I think Subway Veggie Delites are just wonderful. Salad on a bun…. hmmm…now there’s an idea whose time has come!

The“salad on a bun”phenomenon is exactly what I was arguing against earlier. I really, really hate that. Even more, I hate the expectation on the part of non-vegans that being vegan means *enjoying* eating things like that. IT DOESN’T!
 
 bloglogger Oct 19, 2007 at 11:30 
 
Would you say that vegans are somehow better than non-vegans? My assessment is that the majority of you would. But I guess that makes me just as bogotted.

Veganism is one side of the scale, pure carnivorism (is that a word???) is opposite. Balance is of course the right way.

I think veganism=egotism simply because vegans have this“holier than thou”self-image, i.e. it is a religion whose followers requires strictest adherence to be a part of the inner circle. In fact I suspect that every vegan has inside him a terrorist waiting to get out…much like the PETA religion, and the feminist religion.

By the way, subway rocks. Especially on Sunday, I can get 2 steak and cheese subs for $8.99. Extra mayonaise please!

I am such a jerk. I hate mayonaise.

Don’t hate me because I eat meat. There are so many other good reasons to hate me.

This keeps getting funnier and funnier.

 Veganism is one side of the scale, pure carnivorism (is that a word???) is opposite. Balance is of course the right way. 

False logic. That’s akin to saying“Complete abstinence from murder is one side of the scale, murdering everyone you see is the oppposite. Balance is of course the right way.”Just because you have two“opposites”doesn’t automatically make the imagined dead-center the“right”way.

 In fact I suspect that every vegan has inside him a terrorist waiting to get out 

Nice. Good to see you’ve thought this through in a reasonable fashion.

 Don’t hate me because I eat meat. There are so many other good reasons to hate me. 

No one hates you for eating meat. Calling us terrorists-in-training doesn’t help matters, though.
 
 bloglogger Oct 19, 2007 at 13:42 
 
Re: False Logic…

You are referrig to morals now, good and evil. This example works also for other aspects of good and evil such as abstinence, drugs, terrorism etc…all moral blacks and whites…of course in those situations absolute adherence is a must.

What you eat doesn’t make you good or evil. Morality should play a part in diet only inasmuch that we aren’t eating other people.

I know it appears that I am being arrogant thumbing my nose at veganism. You all go on eating your fruits and nuts, just drop the notion that eating meat is somehow wrong. Me taking issue with vegans I can see now is kind of like bullying the cripple kid. Sure, it may be fun, but in the end, the cripple kid becomes your boss and makes bullying them all the harder.

You realize of course I am kidding, cripple kids carry weapons.

Man, you all really do bring out the worst in me. You should be ashamed.

so i came on here to find out the ingredients for these veggie patties–not to ruin it for you guys but I believe autolyzed yeast extract is a natural form of MSG–: )
 
 Sean McGee Nov 14, 2007 at 14:43 
 
Just curious.

Why can’t vegans eat Honey?

That seems to me the same as eating veggies fertilized with manure.

If you eat at subway you can expect all of your food to be handled either by unwashed hands or meat juice covered gloves. I think subway is one of the better fastfood restaurants, but it is still just fastfood. If you are looking for a vegan friendly restaurant go to a place that advertises as one. Many of my friends and i have worked at several different chain restaurants and can almost guarantee that they are only up to code when the inspectors come around. If you are concerned i would suggest eating at a local quality restaurant or pack your lunch.
 
 kristina Jan 10, 2008 at 16:33 
 
ok to clear up a little bit of the veggie max drama…. they are not vegan. they either contain milk or are shared on similar equiptment. they are moringstar patties though. there are a lot of ingredients, yet not bad ones.. oh and btw. i work at subway.. so im not some uneducated person lol
 
 Renee Jan 16, 2008 at 05:16 
 
I am soooooo f*ing pissed at subway right now….i asked to see the ingredients to the bread, and she brought the box out to me…ok, then when i asked for the ingredients to the veggie max, she was like o i cant find the box…bs! another blogger went thru the same thing…they just dont want u to know that its not vegan!!! bastards…i ate 2 before i realized…thats what i get for putting the unknown in my mouth!
 
 Steve Jan 24, 2008 at 02:35 
 
Renee, you’re a fool. If you are genuinely concerned about maintaining a vegan diet, don’t eat fast food. Cook your own, or go to a place that advertises a vegan menu. Do you honestly believe that some minimum wage subway worker (the bastard you were referring to) was trying to conceal the conspiracy of the non-vegan veggie-max patty? Is the world really going that far out of its way to screw up your life? That IS what you get for putting an unknown food in your mouth. If you cared that much about it, you wouldn’t have eaten it. Next time you should eat at a burger joint, where at least you can get a whaaaa-mburger with you french cries.

I HATE SUBWAY! I will never go in their again. Twice they made me a veggie sandwich without changing their gloves having made a meat sandwich before me. Why should I have to tell them to change their gloves to avoid meat juice on my food.

SUBWAY–YOU ARE A BIG PILL OF POO!

grrrrrrrrrr
 
 Nicole Feb 05, 2008 at 15:59 
 
Finally found the veggie patty nutritional information, but not the ingredients (sorry). The nutritional information was not on their main web page along with the other sandwiches, rather, I had to go into their FAQs to find the“Complete Nutrition Information”version: http://subway.com/subwayroot/MenuNutrition/Nutrition/pdf/NutritionValues.pdf 

I have emailed them to request information on the ingredients.
 
 john Feb 08, 2008 at 12:13 
 
Haven’t confirmed but I hate to tell you all that I think the bread subway uses is made w/ Lard.

So much for the veggie delight!
 
 Jackie Feb 09, 2008 at 18:05 
 
I just asked to see nutritional info and the store employees were all clueless…only one of three of them looked to be a teenager as well. They haded me a takeout menu when i asked for nutritional info. I wanted if for the veggie max that i had just ordered and they showed me the napkins that have some sandwhiches.. Subway is disapointing, they claim health this and health that but they are not even up to date. Still compared to any other fast food they’re way better!!

ps–go to chipotle! everything that seems vegan there *is*. the guac, all the salsas, the chips, the tortillas (just not the pinto beans–they’re made with bacon i think). yum.
 
 Lloyd Feb 19, 2008 at 15:40 
 
Well…after spending way too much time reading this entire thread I felt compelled to post some sort of response. There’s a variety of things going on here – some good, some pointless (i.e. neutral) and some bad. Please feel free to agree or disagree with any of my following sentiments. But as a prerequisite, I am a vegan.
First, being a vegan is a conscious choice that is not correct for everyone. This is okay. There is no single type of vegan – the simple idea that relative dietary choices would create some homogenous group of people is absurd. We’re all just people who choose not to eat certain foods. However, with that said, it does draw some sense of community because it’s not the norm (that’s right, I fully admit that it is a rouge element of most societies – I’m alright with that). I do not think that anyone who eats meat is a murder or a bad person – we don’t share the same belief in foods but that’s cool with me. I’d let you sit beside me in a restaurant and eat a steak and I would still address you in the same manner as a vegan who was eating some rice noodle pasta.
Second, because it’s not the norm, being a vegan can be difficult. It can become a real pain to check the ingredients on all prepackaged foods (I agree just cooking yourself becomes the easiest). But when you’re on the go it’s the hardest. Thus, it’s nice to know what you can and can’t eat ahead of time – for that, thank you for the list of ingredients. I feel fortunate for living in a variety of cities (Washington, DC, New York, LA, London, and Paris) that have been very vegan friendly – but not everyone has these options, so knowing what’s in these foods is very important to some.
Finally, in all seriousness, what foods you choose to eat have no bearing on who you are as a person. They might be a mitigating factor; however, they were never a sole cause. If someone chooses a diet it’s done so because of many other factors (this includes all vegetarians, vegans, and those who are not). Bigotry always walks a fine line – vegans can be just as bad as those who eat meat (if not worse sometimes). Tolerance is a learned trait – I wish you all the best and encourage everyone to follow what they feel leaves them satisfied (both inside and outside the kitchen). Sorry for the long post – thanks for so much material to respond to.

you know they touch ur sandwich w/the same gloves as they do with the meat….ewwwwwwwwwwwww
 
 metanoia29 Apr 28, 2008 at 02:53 
 
Hope this post isn’t too far gone to add another voice! I’m not vegetarian btw…heck yes for eating meat!

I’ve been working at Subway for over a year now and I’ve begun helping out with some management type duties. The veggie patties we have here (Metro Detroit) are Veggie Max patties. I finally tried one a few months ago and I’ve been hooked ever since. Tastes like a delicious sausage.

The funny thing is that we usually kept out veggie patties frozen until someone ordered one, which was maybe once every few days, simply because the box suggests so. However, a few months ago we began placing a few patties in a cambro on the bain with all of the other meats. We get plenty of“Ew, what is that,”but as you may have guessed our sales of veggie patties have increased dramatically. We probably sell about a dozen patties a day and now keep a spare bag of patties in our front cooler.

The moral of the story is: the more people want a product, the more we will sell and promote it.
 
 netlurker May 05, 2008 at 13:22 
 
Just wanted to confirm that at least some of the stores in the Cincinnati, OH area have BOTH the veggie patties and veggimax. I just got back from the Mason store. As always, individual stores vary because of the franchised nature of Subways.
 
 Tyler Jun 07, 2008 at 04:33 
 
the man with the vegan flan:
If you ask us to change our gloves, we will gladly do it, no matter how busy we are. We’re trained to respect people, and say you can’t have pork or something, we WILL change our gloves so that you’re satisfied. Try it sometime :)

metanoia29:
Amen to that brother! I’m the shift manager here at our local Subway. Our main customers for the Vegimax are Indian (no offense) and we get plenty of“What’s that”questions. I’ve also had to yell at my employees for lying to customers because they didn’t want to make it (because they say it smells when they cook it). I think it’s delicious though! (We also keep ours in the freezer). Unfortunately, our bain is too small to have it up there in view.
 
 SallySitwell Jun 25, 2008 at 19:37 
 
They carry the veggie patty in Cleveland OH. One store happened to put it on the‘local favorite’list, which is the only reason I knew about it. I actually didn’t know it was a‘national’thing since I couldn’t find it on Subway’s menu online and had never heard of the‘local favs’thing before. I just figured it was just a neighborhood thing. Go figure!

As for the patty. It was way too big for the 6-inch bun with all the salad stuffs, so I had to cut and take off part of it. It was fine. Just tasted like a microwaved Gardenburger with a little too much mushroom if you ask me. Personally I like the salad-on-some-bread-sub, since all I usually want is the bread, the sweet onion sauce, and the black olives. But I get the lettuce, cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, etc., and I like it. No cheese, too many calories and I usually ended up picking it off anyway since I’m picky like that.

Anyway, I am glad they have that for those who don’t like the salad-on-some-bread-sub. Also, I know that sort of option would have been a lifesaver for me in my early days of vegetarianism, when I didn’t know exactly what I was supposed to be eating now that I didn’t eat meat but knew I wanted something that vaguely reminded me, texture-wise, of meat. Transitions and all.

I don’t get Subway often, but if I bring a veggie sub home, I fry up some of my own fake-chicken tofu stuffs and slap that on the sandwich. Way better than their VegPatty and fewer calories. Plus I know exactly what I put in it which is always nice.

“Twice they made me a veggie sandwich without changing their gloves having made a meat sandwich before me.”

If the idea of such a thing is so bothersome to you why not stay away altogether?

I would not give my money to a business that had so many offensive practices and made their profit from selling items or services that I felt were wrong, immoral or disgusting.

But it’s OK to add to their profits as long as the underpaid employees will do a little dance for you?

If you truly have strong convictions STAND by them. Otherwise it’s all just ego and pretentiousness.

“made me a veggie sandwich without changing their gloves”. Grow up.
 
 Helen Jul 22, 2008 at 13:03 
 
I went into subway today and ordered the veggie patty, the guy serving asked me if I was a vegetarian for ethical reasons or just because I didn’t like the taste when I asked him why he told me that the‘Veggie’patty contains beef fat to hold all the ingredients together and that they wouldn’t actually tell you that. I’m not sure if this is only the case in the subways in the UK or if the same ingredient is used everywhere.
 
 LEXY Aug 06, 2008 at 11:23 
 
Try as you may to be a Vegan but somehow you will get a little meat on that sandwhich. I mean it’s not like they change gloves everytime they make a sandwich. So ENJOY!!
 
 Candace Aug 11, 2008 at 22:56 
 
After reading this blog I am very saddened by subway, and many other companies choice to offer veggie options which are not vegan. Although I was vegetarian for a few years before becoming vegan, mainly because I became severly lactose intolerant, I think that over the last 10 years or so there have been many new options available at various restaurant’s.

I am still astonished by posts from people such as Lexy and others above which purposefully ridicule others just because they are different. But we have to remember to be accepting of people who choose to eat meat, if we want the same respect back from them. If not are we any better than them? Although I am all for people learning where their meat comes from and being informed consumers.

I do want to say thank you for making this site, I was unsure about the veggie patties at subway and for months kept checking their website and was never really sure why they didn’t post the nutritional information. I really wish someone would open in a chain of vegan/vegetarian fast food restaurant’s. Nowadays so many people have dietary restrictions ranging from allergies to religious beliefs, to health concerns, that companies should be required by law to have on hand all ingredient and nutritional information.
 
 subman Sep 13, 2008 at 16:29 
 
I spoke to a guy on long island and he happened to own a Subway. He actually took my email address and emailed me the ingredients. They were the same as“Vegan flan”posted. Although I live in Selden NY about a half hour away—when I get a craving I drive all the way to his place in Center Moriches, because I know he will always have them ( his wife is a vegetarian and it’s her favorite sub.) Plus he says people know that he carries them now so he says he sells more veggie maxes than meatball subs.
 
 kate Oct 22, 2008 at 13:39 
 
The veggiemax patties are vegitarian but not vegan, they contain milk and egg. I work there an have read the ingredients.

Hi Ryan,
Wonderful blog you’ve got here. Was searching for good vegetarian food in Subway when I stumbled across yours. Was pleasantly surprised and heartened to see this blog. Nice work. I’m an Indian and have been a vegetarian all my life. I used to have eggs some time when I was a child, but once I came of age and knew the good from the bad, I have stopped eating even items like cakes that contain eggs. I do consume milk though. I am not sure if you have had Indian food, but of all the cuisines in the world I have come across, I realized Indian food offers the most vegetarian dishes, so in case you haven’t tried, I’d really suggest you to try. Here’s a useful link– http://www.vegetarian-restaurants.net/OtherInfo/Subway.htm for Subway, it also has general info for different restaurants.
Keep it going! Let’s turn the world. Vegetarianism Rocks!
 
 Vegan Subway Menu Dec 14, 2008 at 19:43 
 
I would love to see them offer fake (vegan) meats–they would be a great venue to bring veganism to the public.
 
 Maribel Dec 24, 2008 at 17:30 
 
Kate, if you read blog 49, it gives ingredients for the veggiemax. I see no animal products there. However, the gardenburger does. Maybe that’s what your store sells.
 
 Maribel Dec 24, 2008 at 17:31 
 
I’m sorry, I meant blog 48.

I HATE SUBWAY! I will never go in their again. Twice they made me a veggie sandwich without changing their gloves having made a meat sandwich before me. Why should I have to tell them to change their gloves to avoid meat juice on my food.

SUBWAY–YOU ARE A BIG PILL OF POO!

grrrrrrrrrr (Teawhench)

I guess if you are seriously orthodox Jew, you might have deep objections with your roast beef being handled by the same gloves that handled ham or cheese.

But BIGOTRY certainly includes expecting the whole world (including every minimum wage sandwhich artiste) to read your mind on how orthodox you are in your particular belief system and comply.

PILL[sic] OF POO? (What is this, kindergarten?)

But I have a solution that respects my rights (becuase why should I be stiffed with the cost of something my belief system doesn’t require) and various ORTHODOX minorities–initiate a 25 cents per requested glove charge.

That way, you are particulary demanding, you can have your bread sliced with one set of gloves, your cold cuts inserted with another, two more sets of gloves so your lettuce doesn’t get handled with the same gloves that came into contact with tomatoes, ect., in absurdum.

Are Teawhench, et.al, sensitive a cornivore’s possible preference (depending on his degree of orthodoxy) not to have his meat handled (ewwwwwwwwwwwww!) by gloves that came into contact with this weird veggie concoction?

P.S. Contribute the charge to a tip fund for Subway employs. Then you would get a big smile…“Can I take your order? And how many times would you like me to change my gloves today?”
Somehow, I don’t think Teawhench has ever left anything in any tip jar (anywhere)
 
 katlin May 30, 2009 at 19:25 
 
Hmm, I like subway a lot. Haha. I’ve been a vegetarian for well over 10 years and I go in there a lot, and get the veggie delight. Everytime I go in there they are pretty dead, so they get a new pair of gloves. Its soo hard to find fast food chains that offer vegetarian options, meat-eaters don’t understand. Mcdonalds is a vegetarian’s nightmare, everything contains meat products, even their fries and hashbrowns.
Burger king has the veggie burger which is pretty good.
I would much rather go to quiznos though, pay a couple dollars more and get a much better veggie sandwitch. Gauc and all. :D
 
 Ken Greer Jul 01, 2010 at 21:28 
 
Here’s a scan of a letter I received from Subway with their GardenBurger and VegiMax ingredients. Vegetarian, but neither is vegan

 http://www.veggieconnection.com/news/subway-gardenburger-and-vegimax-ingredients.asp 
 
 Kath Jan 28, 2011 at 18:12 
 
This is a very information (and at times hilarious) thread! I love the veggie patty and get it once every week or two loaded with veggies (no lettuce). Question for those who mention the other chains carrying veggie burgers..I’m always suspicious that the veggie burger is cooked on the same griddle as the meat, thus soaking up the nasty juices. Is that an unreasonable fear?

I have personally never, ever even seen the Veggie Max offered in any Subway I’ve visited here in New Mexico. I’m going to ask the manager of the one I patronize at work- it’s located in part of a hospital here.
BUT, my bigger gripe is about the Veggie Delite sandwich and I wonder if a few of you have had a similar experience and will spread the word.
First of all, the Veggie Delite is ALL veggies, so you’d think that they would give you more- maybe even twice the veggies, right? Everytime I go, they give me the same amount of veggies as they pile on top of the meat!! I feel as if I’m being ripped off every time I order this sandwich!

For $3.50 I could get expensive meat with my veggies OR the veggie delite! Same price, same amt of veggies.

It makes no sense and I feel like a mooch to have to keep asking,“can I have a few more tomatoes . . .umm, a few more cucumbers please? just to get a decent sandwich that doesn’t fold closed like a book!!!

Anyone else have the same experience? Where can we complain, because it seems to be a Subway-wide problem to me.
 
 honeybeecooksjackfruit Mar 15, 2011 at 08:03 
 
Michael, michael, I could not agree with you more! I have this same gripe each and every time I go into a Subway. And then they look at you like you are a jerk when you do ask for more cucumbers. Do they have a brain?

Maybe we should complain to the company!
