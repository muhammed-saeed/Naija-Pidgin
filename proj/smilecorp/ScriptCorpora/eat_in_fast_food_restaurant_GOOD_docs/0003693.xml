 I received a coupon/flyer in the mail today announcing a grand opening for Astor Mediterranean at  2300 N. Pershing Drive (not too far from the corner of N. Pershing and Arlington Blvd/Route 50).  It says it&apos;s a family-owned restaurant first established in Adams Morgan in 1980.  I assume it&apos;s the one located at 1829 Columbia Rd, and I found some positive posts about Astor here .  Sounds like it might be good for a quick meal.

Astor is definitely good for a very cheap and reasonably healthy meal.  The&apos;Astor Vegetarian&apos;, which I order about 90% of the time here, is a lot of food for only$6.50 (several dips, several vegetable dishes, spanikopita, dolmades, falafel, pita).

 I still haven&apos;t managed a comprehesive survey of area falafel, but Astor must be among the tops. To my taste, it&apos;s a wee bit overseasoned (maybe even just less salt would make it on the mark?), but the chickpea flavor and spice mix are right on, and the texture is perfect: crisp but light outer crust protecting a light fluffy inside.* As part of the Astor vegetarian platter, dunk it in or chase it with any of the salads. The beet salad and the Egyptian moussaka are longstanding favorites of mine.

*I didn&apos;t have it in a sandwich, which I consider the true test, but I have confidence...

 Something I&apos;ve often wondered (although not enough to do anything about it) is: Does the Astor in Adams Morgan bear any relationship to the old Astor Greek restaurant on M Street, which closed a very long time ago? It was somewhere on the same block as Bell&apos;s (and, er, Camelot). They had pretty good Greek food in hefty portions for practically no money, with belly dancing upstairs on weekends (which I never experienced). Anybody know? Anybody remember the old Astor?

 My fiance and I ate dinner at the Arlington Astor Mediterranean last night (2/13/08).  We arrived around 8:40 p.m., and we were the only customers there for a time.  The restaurant presents as sort of a deli/fast-food restaurant, with much of its fare on display in glass units sandwiching the cash register.  Orders are placed at the counter, and patrons can then get napkins, silverware, and condiments from a central location before grabbing a table.  Our entrees were brought to the table for us, though I do not know if this is regularly the practice or if the employees did this just because the place was almost empty.

My fiance ordered a triangular&quot; spinach pie &quot;(spanakopita) and the falafel platter (four small-ish falafel patties, Egyptian salad , mini-serving of hummus in a plastic container, and grape leaf ), and I got the&quot;Astor vegetarian,&quot;which is a vegetarian sampler comprised of two falafel , tabouleh salad , beet salad , Egyptian salad, chickpea salad, eggplant moussaka (or, as they describe it,&quot;mussaka&quot;), baba ganoush, fava bean dip, hummus, and lentil salad .  The vegetarian sampler, by the way, is not nearly as big as it sounds (which is fine by me), and would not constitute a meal for two people.

The spinach pie seemingly lacked the feta cheese noted on the menu, but was enjoyed.  The falafel was perfectly good, though not great (I once again note that Sammy T&apos;s in Fredericksburg has the best falafel anywhere in Virginia or D.C.).  The tzatziki (Greek yogurt sauce) served with the falafel was very, very good.  They should sell it in the form of an appetizer.  The fava bean dip was flavorless; it should be replaced with something like the spicy red pepper-walnut dip you can find at certain Middle Eastern restaurants such as Layalina .  The Egyptian salad was similar to fattoosh salad, but lacking sumac and pita chips, both of which would have helped it.  The hummus was okay, but nothing distinctive.  The lentil salad was good if you like lentils, and the same is true of the beet, tabouleh, and chickpea salads.  There was nothing offensive about those dishes, but nothing amazing, either.

The baba ganoush was fantastic.  Really, really good.  I order baba all over the place, and Astor&apos;s version is one of the best.  The only thing detracting from it was the generic pita that just doesn&apos;t do justice to any of the dips.  The eggplant mussaka was outstanding, worthy enough on its own to make me a repeat customer.  It had a wonderful flavor and perfect texture.  And the grape leaf (or&quot;vine&quot;leaf, as they label it) was stellar.  It was fresh and dripped with a slightly tangy oil.

I ordered baklava to take home for dessert, and it was superb.  

The meal, including the baklava, came to about$26.00, including tax and tip.  Now that I have a feel for the menu&apos;s high and low points, I am sure that I&apos;ll head back.

 As odd as it may sound, we love the Egyptian Pizza... and order from the Arlington location more times than I&apos;d like to admit... I feel like Pavlov at the the mere mention of it to my husband as a possible dinner delivery/take-out option... he&apos;s immediately ordering!     

We never would have thought about ordering pizza from Astor even though it is prominantly pictured on their menu, but once when we were in the restaurant, we noticed several tables having the pizza and it looked really good.

Our favorite, The Egyptian pizza is as follows:&quot;Eggplant, green pepper, garlic, jalapeno pepper, fresh tomatoes, tomato sauce, mozzarella,&amp;feta on our square-cut crust.&quot;  The eggplant is the same eggplant they have in the case - which is delicious.  The real secret with the pizzas here is that they put fennel seeds in the dough for the crust... something one of the owners, Sam (who is a genuinely nice guy), explained to us. It&apos;s a great pizza... it&apos;s not going to compete with all the wonderful true pizza places we have at our disposal, but for the mere combination of flavors - it&apos;s always a winner for us!     

We usually get a greek salad as well - which, although doesn&apos;t actually seem very&quot;Greek&quot;, is wonderful with a stuffed grape leaf, beets and olives and several other items included.

Here&apos;s the menu - http://www.astorfood...rlington.html The other items we&apos;ve tried have also always been very good, but that pizza is what keeps us coming back.

Now, I&apos;m starting to drool at the thought... ha ha!

 A PM I sent to levjn this evening:

1) I got almost no sleep last night and am a zombie
2) Starving (more of a&quot;false hunger&quot;due to lack of sleep)
3) I&apos;m calling right now and ordering an Egyptian pizza - it sounds PERFECT. This pizza is hitting all the right notes, and could not possibly be any more satisfying given my current body chemistry.  It&apos;s$15, and worth every penny.  I had thought certain I&apos;d driven by Astor before, but after tonight, I don&apos;t think so; it&apos;s really off to the side, and I think I was extrapolating from the Adams Morgan location.  

Thank you SO MUCH for this recommendation.  This (dr.com) is a great website, and, despite how that sounds, I say that with complete humility, because the substance of this place really has nothing to do with me.  Oh, I may have plotted the garden, but it&apos;s people like levjn who grow the wonderful flowers that are the backbone of this community.  For the people, by the people ... but definitely not wee, The Pizza.  

I&apos;m having this with an Emilio Lustau Palo Cortado&quot;Peninsula&quot; Sherry, and it works pretty well; you could almost go with a less-oxidized Fino here.

Upgraded in the Dining Guide , and no, it&apos;s not a&quot;contender&quot;for Best In Area; it just is what it is which is tasty and satisfying.  

Cheers,
Rocks

 The satisfying, steadying effects of astor&apos;s pizzas, sandwiches and spreads have always kept me from toppling over during sunday doubles; and any other days when im not quite as, say, superstar , as an onion from northern neck.

And yes, the key to the pizzas surprising delicious is indeed the fennel seed.
 i feel like love is in the kitchen with a culinary eye, think she&apos;s making something special and i&apos;m smart enough to try
-interpol

more than what i must say

 Prince of Petworth reports on a coming, presumably Egyptian restaurant in Georgetown that even has koshari in its name! 
And in the thread, someone says that the Astor on Columbia Road has koshari too.

Indeed they do, though it&apos;s not on the menu. At 6:00 tonight there were about two portions left on the heating tray, and it showed the effects of having been sitting around for a while, frankly, with a hard piece of dried out macaroni ruining every few bites. I don&apos;t want to be too picky about this, but the tomato sauce was also a bit of a letdown, lacking that vinegary tang I remember. All in all it will do in a pinch, I guess, but I&apos;m looking forward to trying other koshari offerings in the area.
