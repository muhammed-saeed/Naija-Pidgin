Cheers to Mr. Ron Garcia of Bryan Honda. He helped me work such a great deal! When my daughter&apos;s car started experiencing engine trouble and I knew I had to find her another car, I went to Bryan Honda and met Ron. He is the most honest and courteous car salesman I&apos;ve ever met. We worked a trade where I&apos;m now paying the same monthly payment for two cars that I was paying for one, and my daughter and I both love our cars!

 - Nancy Robles, Hope Mills 

Cheers and hats off to Dr. Stephen H. Kouba and his staff of Cape Fear Orthopedic Clinic, P.A., and to Dr. Maurice Roulhac and his staff of Carolina Vascular Institute.

For the past several months, both of these wonderful doctors and their staffs have been treating my dad, Vernon Bullard, for a leg injury. Both doctors, as well as their staffs, have been extremely kind and compassionate toward my dad, making sure to meet his every need. Our family as well as Cumberland and the surrounding counties are truly blessed to have them!

 - Anna Ackerman, Roseboro 

Cheers to Bordeaux Optical.

What a refreshing business establishment it is! They have put friendly, happy, helpful and conscientious all into their business practice so naturally. They truly are a business to be modeled after. Thanks for your help in our recent optical needs.

 - Terry and Ellen Jenkins, Fayetteville 

Cheers to the SwampDogs baseball staff for their efforts in entertaining us at a recent ball game. In addition to a great ball game, we had the &quot;spray water man,&quot; who came by continuously spraying water at people who needed to be cooled down because of the hot evening. Then there was the young male cheerleader called &quot;Mo Runs&quot; who roamed the stadium with entertainment. &quot;Mo Runs&quot; has a great verbal approach of expressing excitement. You need to come to see and hear &quot;Mo Runs&quot; in action.

 - Ed Angel, Fayetteville 

Cheers to Cape Fear High School, Mr. Jernigan, Mrs. Culbreth and Cumberland County schools - you graduated more than 300 kids on June 10 in one hour and five minutes! It was beautiful, memorable, heartwarming and quick! Way to go, and congratulations to the Class of 2010! From Ciara&apos;s mom.

 - Michele Ellis, Eastover 

Cheers to Sam, one of the attendants at the Ann Street Recycling Center. He is always outside helping people take care of their trash and recyclable items. It&apos;s obvious he takes pride in his job and enjoys helping others. He makes going to the dump a pleasure.

 - Kathryn Oxford, Eastover 

Cheers to Dr. Oliver Hodge for being the best dentist ever.

 - Myra Allen, Fayetteville 

Cheers and congratulations to our son Patrick Allen Locklear, a former student of Mrs. Barefoot&apos;s third-grade class at District 7 Elementary School in Wade, for receiving seven awards! Two were for most improved in math and especially reading on end-of-grade tests! We are most proud of you for being honored by your principal, teachers, classmates and the town of Wade for the citizenship and character award! You have the kind of heart that is endless and truly rare. We are all truly blessed and thankful to call you our son, brother and friend. Thank you, Patrick! We love you. Love, Dad, Mom, Garrett, Skylar and Buddy.

 - Marty and Jennifer Locklear, Wade 

Cheers and congrats on a fun season to the Pine Forest Seminoles coach pitch baseball team. Everyone had fun, tried hard and showed good sportsmanship all season long. Have a great summer and keep practicing. Special thanks to our sponsor, Monkey Joe&apos;s, for all their support. From Coach Jim.

 - Jim Young, Linden 

Cheers to Fayetteville Ambulatory Surgery Center.

On June 15, I had foot surgery at the Fayetteville Ambulatory Surgery Center. I would like to thank everyone who attended to my needs, including Dr. Eaton and all the nurses on staff. You all were very patient and understanding. Again, thanks for making my brief stay as pleasant as possible.

 - Bertha Council, Hope Mills 

Cheers and a great big thank-you to Cross Creek Heating&amp;Air Conditioning Service. Gary McCarroll, the president of the company, took time out of his busy schedule on a Sunday to look at my air conditioning system. He provided me all of the details for the repairs every step of the way! He also returned with Tony, who is a super guy, and they completed the job! The service and the customer service were &quot;impeccable.&quot; Cross Creek Heating&amp;A/C have shown the simple truths of service: &quot;Always give the customer more than they expect.&quot;

 - Shelah Maya Peek, Fayetteville 

Cheers to Leigh&apos;s VW.

I own a &apos;67 Volkswagen Beetle. I wanted to fix it and get it on the road but didn&apos;t know a place to take it. I looked on the Web and found the most wonderful place to go, Leigh&apos;s VW (Werks). It is at 243 Tolar St. Leigh is the owner and has been working on Volkswagens for many years. His knowledge helped me a lot. He always takes the time to help a customer; he never turns anyone away. He makes sure it&apos;s done right the first time.

 - Jay Brown, Fayetteville 

Cheers to all those who took advantage of the free Second Saturdays event at the Museum of the Cape Fear on June 12. Second Saturdays is a statewide initiative by the N.C. Department of Cultural Resources where all 37 state history museums and historic sites provide cultural/art events for all of the state&apos;s citizens and artists.

 - Leisa Greathouse, Fayetteville 

Cheers to Kyle Gregory Levrault for being an amazing fiance&apos; and stepfather! Ever since Kyle tiptoed into our life, it&apos;s been filled with love, laughter and lots of special times. And all we wanted to say is that we love you and thank you for everything you have done! From Mary and Joshua.

 - Mary Adkins, Spring Lake 

Cheers to Vance at Home Depot! He went above and beyond to help me retrieve my cell phone that I lost in the parking lot. He did not have to help, because Home Depot does not own the parking lot, but he did out of pure kindness! Thank you so much!

 - Lindsay McLamb, Fayetteville 

Cheers to lifeguard Jake Jones and employees Sara Allen, Marjorie Turner and Maria Rodrigus at Fantasy Lake Water Park in Hope Mills. I became ill June 13 while there with my grandchildren. They immediately assisted me and knew exactly what to do to cool me down. They are really professional. Thanks to all of you.

 - Shirley Barbour, Fayetteville 

Cheers to Dr. Schhaefer and Cathy from Fayetteville Orthopaedics for being kind enough to see me. Then continued cheers to the staff of Cape Fear Valley Medical Center, especially Scott Thorne (registration), Robin and Kimberly (short stay), Tanesha (transport), Bernadette and Bill (pre-op), Nancy T., Lee, CRNA, Dr. Withers and the Operating Room staff (sorry, I didn&apos;t get names; too sleepy), Gregory and Teanik (food and nutrition), Minday and Sam (physical therapy) and the nurses of 3S: Loona, Melanie, Karen, Diane, Alice and Kay. Thank you for your excellence to patient care.

 - Monica MacDonald, Harrells 

Cheers to Crown Ford and especially the general manager, Pete Macey; their finance manager, Steve Scarborough; and my sales representative, Dee Dee Bobbitt. I initially had a very poor experience and bad first impression while trying to purchase my 2010 Ford Raptor. I contacted Mr. Macey, and he responded immediately and with an extremely professional demeanor. He has personally given me his word that his dealership is committed to service members in the area. My wife and I both served for more than 20 years in the Army, and we are proud to say they have earned customers for life! I will enthusiastically recommend Crown Ford to everyone I come in contact with. Fayetteville could use more businesses with this type of commitment to the military.

 - Retired Master Sgt. Robert MacLeod, Sanford 

Cheers and thank you to a single mom who helped me at the Hope Mills license plate agency. I was out in the the parking lot struggling in the heat to remove my license plate to turn it in. My elderly grandmother was with me, as well as my infant daughter.

The lady was so sweet and saw my struggle with a screw. She approached me with a tool she used to remove her plate and assisted me in removing and replacing the screws in the hot sun. My thanks for all she did. I enjoyed meeting her, and I would love to show my appreciation for her kindness.

 - Ashley Brook, Fayetteville 

Cheers to Red Lobster on McPherson Church Road.

My wife and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary June 15 at the Red Lobster. I was never more amazed at the gracious hospitality and ingenuity in presenting my wife with an anniversary ring at dinner.

John B., the hospitality manager, completely took charge of the beautiful presentation of the gift, in a champagne glass, with a twisted napkin and the ring sitting inside her glass on the napkin. It easily made a lifetime impression on both my wife and me. Thank you, John.

Also our server, Julia P., was extremely pleasant and always there with a smile, refill and kind word.

 - Mark Madore, Fayetteville 

Cheers to our son, Hunter Eckroth, for receiving the Principal&apos;s Award for school year 2009-10 at Gray&apos;s Creek Elementary School. Way to go, Hunter! We are so proud of you.

 - Kenneth and Melanie Eckroth, Fayetteville 

Cheers to Dr. Jim Krepp, Dr. Renee Wheeler and all the fine staff at Cape Fear Animal Hospital. They gave our special cat Roquefort excellent medical treatment with tender, loving care. When he could no longer live, he was treated gently as he was put to sleep and out of his misery. Dr. Krepp was sensitive to our grief and feelings. He truly is the best!

 - John and Kitty Davis, Fayetteville 

Cheers and hats off to two great companies: Sanford Honda and Michelin Tires.

They stepped up to the plate and took a bad situation and made it right. I sing their praises, having owned three Hondas in 23 years, all of which had Michelin tires.

But when the present tires didn&apos;t perform as they should have, Michelin replaced all four, cost approximately $1,200, free of charge.

Sanford Honda, where I bought the car, did the labor, gratis. They also washed my vehicle and topped off the gas. What service. Thanks, Jaime Holcomb. What a great staff, worth the 35-mile trip.

Thanks to Michelin Tires of Greenville, S.C. - Holly, Mateo and Marilyn. Thanks to each of you.

Guess where I&apos;m going when I need a new Honda?

 - Anne Dees, Fayetteville 

Cheers to Amanda and her team at the health clinic! I most recently completed 20 hours of community service for high school. Amanda and her co-workers were so welcoming and appreciative of me. I had a great experience with them. Hope to see them next year!

 - Gordon McCourt, Fayetteville 

Jeers to a fast-food restaurant. My wife and I went there for a late afternoon snack after work. As we stood in line ordering our food, I saw a fly buzz by. Then another. And another. And another. I looked around and counted 15 to 20 flies buzzing around the menu board and generally in the kitchen area.

I looked behind us in the dining area and saw more flies buzzing around.

We got our food, left and threw it all in the garbage.

My wife called the manager, and she stated it couldn&apos;t be helped with the drive-through window open all the time.

 - Mario Burnette, Fayetteville 

Jeers to a heating and air-conditioning company. I called about three months ago to have my bonus-room air conditioner repaired. They sent out a repairman and charged me $451 to replace a part on the unit. Three months later, it is still in pieces and not working. He will no longer answer any of my calls. What a poor businessman.

 - Rene Thompson, Raeford 

Jeers to the office that called in a $70 to-go order and didn&apos;t leave gratuity. Most businesses charge a to-go fee, yet our company does not. Be more aware. People in restaurants work for tips; after all, we only make $2.13 an hour.

 - Jessica Greyson, Fayetteville 

Jeers to the management and staff at a rental business. I filled out a contract and waited for a refrigerator for a week and got the call they would be at my house on Saturday at noon. When it didn&apos;t show up, I contacted them.

They first indicated their delivery driver hadn&apos;t come in, then requested I come and get the fridge. When I told them I did not have a vehicle to get the fridge, they said they would call me back. I had to call them back, and then the excuse was I needed to talk to a manager.

The manager called and said something was wrong with my contract.

Three different excuses. I told them we would not be doing business.

 - Gary Williams, Fayetteville 

Jeers to a post office that doesn&apos;t have all their employees on the same page. I went to get a registered package June 16, and the lady let me sign for my husband&apos;s mail. But then on June 18, I went to get one, and they said no. I asked the policy on delivery, and anyone can sign for it when it goes to the address, but not at the post office. The lady who delivers doesn&apos;t let us know she is there; she just puts it in the mail box. I say jeers to them!

 - Susan Brown, Fayetteville 

Jeers to whoever authorized a concrete barrier on Morganton Road just west of Reilly Road between the two service stations located at that intersection. I know the reason why it was put there - to prevent people from going across the intersection and then cutting through the gas station to go south on Reilly Road. However, this is a safety hazard. People are still making the U-turn at the end of the barrier. Also, it makes it hard for the people who live in this neighborhood to visit their favorite store at this intersection. Do we want to go down a road in the wrong lane? No! This is what is happening right now and will continue to happen until a serious accident occurs.

 - Irwing Totzauer, Fayetteville 

Jeers to the coaches of an 8-, 9- and 10-year-olds team. Not only do they have no control over themselves and insist on yelling and screaming at their team members, they also have no leader. The wives and moms are running the team. They promised a child something, and the wife of the coach changed it.

The statement was made that one child missed a couple of practices. The fact is a lot of them missed practice and games, but he was not in their little group, so he was blackballed. Good luck in the future; I think you&apos;re gonna need it.

 - Kathy Adams, Fayetteville 

Jeers: There are only a few boat ramps on the Cape Fear River. The one we try to use is on N.C. 87. This ramp is in bad shape! There are trees across the driveway and ruts in the road. The concrete is short, and a pole in the water is in the way.

 - Lisa Phillips, Fayetteville 

Jeers to the city of Fayetteville. What smells to be raw sewage has been running down the street. Numerous calls to the health department and city have been made, and the issue is still unresolved. As it is summer, I cannot allow my children to play outside in our yard for fear of being bitten by mosquitoes that are breeding in sewage.

 - Christine Walden, Fayetteville
