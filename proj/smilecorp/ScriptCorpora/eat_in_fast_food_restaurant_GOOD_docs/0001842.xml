We review the HTC Titan, the first super-sized Windows Phone 7 Mango-powered handset, to find out if will make a big impression
 
 
The HTC Titan: Big is BETTER!

How big is big in the world of smartphones? Not so long ago, say 2008, a 4-inch display was considered pretty substantial. Nowadays this isn’t the case, largely thanks to HTC’s HD2 handset, which popularised the 4.3-inch display way back in October 2009. It was also a Windows Mobile-powered handset too, but the less said about that iteration of Microsoft’s mobile OS the better.

Fast-forward to 2011 and we now have handsets with displays ranging from 4.7-inches in the case of the HTC Titan and 5.3-inches on the Samsung Galaxy Note. But is 4.7-inches the new 4.3-inches or is it simply too big to be practical?

 Build 
The HTC Titan is a big device, measuring 131.5x70.7x9.9 mm and weighing in at 160g. It’s also one of the best looking handsets HTC has produced in a long time. It’s thin, long and slab-like but feels great in the hand with near-perfect weight distribution.

The entire chassis, as is usually the case with HTC flagship handsets, is crafted from a single sheet of aluminium. There’s a single soft touch on the bottom of the back panel, which rests comfortably against the seat of your palm when holding the device.

The Titan isn’t a thin handset by any stretch of the imagination (it’s 0.7mm thicker than the Galaxy S2, for instance), nor is it the lightest device currently out there. But this doesn’t matter: the HTC Titan feels great in the hand and is an absolute pleasure to use. And this is quite a design achievement for HTC when you take in account just how big the display actually is.

The handset features just three physical keys - volume rocker, camera shutter, and power/unlock. There’s a 3.5mm jack up top and that’s literally it. The Titan’s 8-megapixel camera slightly protrudes out of the back of the device when viewed from the side and the front of the handset, which is more or less all screen, is Gorilla Glass-protected.

 Display 
One of the first things you’ll notice about the HTC Titan’s display, bar how big it is, is just how good its viewing angles are. Looking at the device from a multitude of perspectives (some practically side on) illustrates this point profoundly. In fact we’d even go as far as saying the Titan’s viewing angles are on a par with the one’s we saw on the Galaxy S2.

The Titan uses a 4.7-inch S-LCD 480x800 pixels display with a ppi of 199, which, if we’re honest, isn’t all that good - the Samsung Galaxy S2 has a ppi of 217, for instance. But this shouldn’t worry you too much as the Titan’s display, despite being relatively low on the resolution-front, does not disappoint.

The blacks are deep, the electric pinks are loud and the general feel is one of premium, high-end performance. Of course, it would have been nice to see a Super AMOLED HD display present, but that’s just wishful thinking and neither here nor there. And besides: the S-LCD display on the Titan is perfectly adequate in our opinion anyway.

Windows Phone 7 Mango also looks stunning on the expansive 4.7-inch display. We’ve always thought that to fully do Microsoft’s Metro UI justice you need to boot it up on a big display because of its tile-based, information-at-a-glance nature. Previously, 4.3-inches cut the mustard in this respect, but now we’ve seen it on a 4.7-inchwe doubt we could ever go back to smaller, traditional display proportions.

 Internals 
If you’re after a handset with reams of power, then look no further. The HTC Titan is an absolute beast, featuring a 1.5GHz Scorpion processor and Adreno 205 GPU - that’s the Qualcomm MSM8255 chipset, in case you were wondering. HTC has also thrown in a rather paltry 512MB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage–you get access to about 13GB of this.

There’s no microSD support, unfortunately, so you’re basically stuck with what’s on offer. Microsoft, for some unknown reason, like Apple, doesn’t seem to like expandable storage on its mobile devices–although there is talk of Nokia’s Mango handsets featuring expandable storage.

Connectivity is as it should be with full support for EDGE, GPRS, Wi-Fi b/g/n and 3G (HSDPA, 14.4 Mbps; HSUPA, 5.76 Mbps). There’s also DLNA support built into Mango, which makes short work of sharing videos and music across linked up home networks.

Microsoft has ensured via its hardware stipulations that Windows Phone 7 is fully optimised to run on a basic level of hardware. What this essentially means is that Mango will work great on a handset powered by a 1GHz processor, like the HTC Radar . But should you decide throw a 1.5GHz chipset into the mix like HTC has done with the Titan, well, that’s when things get even more impressive.

In terms of raw speed and power, the Titan doesn’t leave you wanting. It’s a superbly powerful handset and one that devours pretty much everything you throw at it, whether it&apos;s gaming, web browsing, videos, GPU intensive activities, multitasking. In short, it&apos;s the works.

The general performance of the handset is up there with the best handsets we’ve tested. It matches the iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy S2 and HTC Sensation in every respect.

 Imaging 
What about picture quality? The Titan packs an 8-megapixel (3264x2448 pixels) camera with autofocus, LED flash and face detection.

Generally speaking, we’re not huge fans of smartphone cameras - we prefer our SLR and DSLR, if we’re honest - but we were rather impressed with the Titan’s imaging capabilities. Images are clean, free of noise and, thanks to its f/2.2 lens, yield pretty decent results in all levels of light.

It’s a similar story with video, which the Titan captures in 720p. Of course many are now accustomed to the delights of 1080p video quality, but that’s only available on handsets with dual-core processors - and these do not yet exist in the world of Windows Phone 7 Mango.

Video is still pretty decent though. We have seen better, if we’re honest, such as the facilities found on the Samsung Galaxy S2, but this shouldn’t put anyone off too much. 720p is perfectly adequate for most users. We certainly wouldn’t hold the lack of 1080p video capture against the HTC Titan in any case as video is never that high on our priority list. It&apos;s a nice extra but not essential.

 

 Operating System 
The Titan uses Mango, which we’re increasingly becoming big fans of. We won’t go into details here, however, as we’ve detailed the platform in great depth here: Windows Phone 7 Mango: Everything you need to know .

However, we will say that with the 500 improvements and features Microsoft has ushered in with the Mango update, Android and iOS are no longer the sole platforms for people that are serious about mobile technology. Windows Phone 7 Mango is now officially a contender and 2012 looks set to be a very big year for Microsoft’s ever-improving mobile platform.

 Battery 
Considering the size of the Titan’s display and HTC’s track record for making phones with truly terrible battery lives it’s fairly safe to say that we weren’t expecting anything particularly good from the HTC Titan.

How wrong we were. Not only does the HTC Titan last a full working day (8am until around 6pm) with normal use, which is something the HTC Desire HD always struggled to do, but it also consistently surprised us by lasting for around 20-odd hours of a single charge, which, when you again consider the size of this device, is truly astonishing.

Just for the record, when we say‘normal usage’we mean: push notifications on, music, occasional browsing, app usage and more than several phone calls. We weren’t expecting anything like this kind of performance from the Titan, so we were incredibly impressed. HTC we take our hats off to you - you finally seemed to have solved your great battery issue.

 Final thoughts 
We love this phone. It’s massive in every respect, but that just makes it all the more fun to use on a daily basis. Web pages look great, video immense and playing games is truly engaging on the Titan’s near 5-inches of screen. There’s also enough power packed into the device to keep even the most hardcore user happy.

Of course, given the chance we’d make a few changes here and there - increased display resolution, microSD support (or more internal storage, say, 32GB), more RAM and maybe shave a few tenths of a millimeter off of the thickness - but nothing’s perfect right?

All in all, the Titan is a fantastic handset. If you’re in the market for an upgrade or new smartphone, but are getting a little tired with iOS and Android, HTC’s Windows Phone 7 Mango handset comes highly recommended.
