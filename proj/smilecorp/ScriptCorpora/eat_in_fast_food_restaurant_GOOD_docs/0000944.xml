 Brussels ( French : Bruxelles , pronounced [bʁysɛl]   ( listen ) ; Dutch : Brussel , pronounced [ˈbrʏsəl] (help·info) ), officially the Brussels Region or Brussels-Capital Region [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ( French : Région de Bruxelles-Capitale , Dutch : Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest ( help · info ) ), is the de facto capital city of the European Union (EU) and the largest urban area in Belgium . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] It comprises 19 municipalities , including the City of Brussels proper, which is the constitutional capital of Belgium, Flanders , the Flemish Community , and the French Community of Belgium . [ 8 ] 

Brussels has grown from a 10th-century fortress town founded by a descendant of Charlemagne into a metropolis of more than one million inhabitants. [ 9 ] The metropolitan area has a population of over 1.8 million, making it the largest in Belgium. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] 

Since the end of the Second World War , Brussels has been a main centre for international politics. Its hosting of principal EU institutions as well as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has made the city a polyglot home of numerous international organisations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants. [ 10 ] 

Although historically Dutch-speaking , Brussels became increasingly French-speaking over the 19th and 20th centuries . Today a majority of inhabitants are native French-speakers, although both languages have official status. [ 11 ] Linguistic tensions remain, and the language laws of the municipalities surrounding Brussels are an issue of much controversy in Belgium.

 History 
 Further information: Fortifications of Brussels , Belgian Revolution , Frenchification of Brussels , and Brussels and the European Union#History Charles of Lorraine founded what would become Brussels c. 979 
The most common theory for the etymology of Brussels is that it derives from the Old Dutch Broeksel or other spelling variants, which means marsh ( broek ) and home ( sel ) or &quot;home in the marsh&quot;. [ 12 ] The origin of the settlement that was to become Brussels lies in Saint Gaugericus &apos; construction of a chapel on an island in the river Senne around 580. [ 13 ] The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia transferred the relics of Saint Gudula from Moorsel to the Saint Gaugericus chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

The Lambert I of Leuven , Count of Leuven gained the County of Brussels around 1000 by marrying Charles&apos; daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne on an important trade route between Bruges and Ghent , and Cologne , Brussels grew quite quickly; it became a commercial centre that rapidly extended towards the upper town ( St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral , Coudenberg , Sablon/Zavel area...), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. The Counts of Leuven became Dukes of Brabant at about this time (1183/1184). In the 13th century, the city got its first walls . [ 14 ] 
 Grand Place after the 1695 bombardment by the French army 
After the construction of the first walls of Brussels, in the early 13th century, Brussels grew significantly. In order to let the city expand, a second set of walls was erected between 1356 and 1383. Today, traces of it can still be seen, mostly because the &quot; small ring &quot;, a series of roadways in downtown Brussels bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.

In the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress Margaret III of Flanders with Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy , a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of Valois (namely Antoine , their son), with another line of descent from the Habsburgs (Maximilian of Austria, later Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor , married Mary of Burgundy , who was born in Brussels). Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous Low Countries , and flourished.

 Charles V , heir of the Low Countries since 1506, though (as he was only 6 years old) governed by his aunt Margaret of Austria until 1515, was declared King of Spain , in 1516, in the Cathedral of Saint Gudule in Brussels. Upon the death of his grandfather, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, Charles became the new archduke of the Habsburg Empire and thus the Holy Roman Emperor of the Empire &quot; on which the sun does not set &quot;. It was in the Palace complex at Coudenberg that Charles V abdicated in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.

In 1695, French troops sent by King Louis XIV bombarded Brussels with artillery . Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The Grand Place was destroyed, along with 4000 buildings, a third of those in the city. The reconstruction of the city centre , effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed the appearance of the city and left numerous traces still visible today. The city was captured by France in 1746 during the War of the Austrian Succession but was handed back to Austria three years later.
 Episode of the Belgian Revolution of 1830 , Wappers (1834) 
In 1830, the Belgian revolution took place in Brussels after a performance of Auber&apos;s opera La Muette de Portici at the La Monnaie theatre. On 21 July 1831, Leopold I , the first King of the Belgians, ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings. Following independence, the city underwent many more changes. The Senne had become a serious health hazard , and from 1867 to 1871 its entire urban area was completely covered over . This allowed urban renewal and the construction of modern buildings and boulevards which are characteristic of downtown Brussels today.

During the 20th century the city has hosted various fairs and conferences, including the fifth Solvay Conference in 1927 and two world fairs: the Brussels International Exposition of 1935 and the Expo &apos;58 . Brussels suffered damage from World War II, though it was minor compared to cities in Germany and the United Kingdom.
 The 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels was the first world physics conference. 
After the war, Brussels was modernized for better and for worse. The construction of the North-South Junction linking the main railway stations in the city was completed in 1952, while the first Brussels premetro was finished in 1969, and the first line of the Brussels Metro was opened in 1976. Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the de facto capital of what would become the European Union , and many modern buildings were built. Unfortunately, development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and many architectural gems were demolished to make way for newer buildings which often clashed with their surroundings, a process known as Brusselization .

The Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989 after a constitutional reform in 1970. The Brussels-Capital Region was made bilingual, and it is one of the three federal regions of Belgium , along with Flanders and Wallonia . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]

The 19 municipalities (communes) of the Brussels-Capital Region are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive. [ 16 ] 

In 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, including the 19 in the Brussels-Capital Region. [ 17 ] Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975. [ 17 ] However, several municipalities outside of the Brussels-Capital Region have been merged with the City of Brussels throughout its history including Laeken , Haren , and Neder-Over-Heembeek , which were merged into the City of Brussels in 1921. [ 18 ] 

The largest and most populous of the municipalities is the City of Brussels, covering 32.6 square kilometres (12.6 sq mi) with 145,917 inhabitants. The least populous is Koekelberg with 18,541 inhabitants, while the smallest in area is Saint-Josse-ten-Noode which is only 1.1 square kilometres (0.4 sq mi). Despite being the smallest municipality, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode has the highest population density of the 19 with 20,822 inhabitants per km².

 Climate 

Under the Köppen climate classification Brussels experiences an oceanic climate (Cfb). Brussels&apos; proximity to coastal areas influences the area&apos;s climate by sending marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean . Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region. [ 19 ] Snowfall is rare, generally occurring once or twice a year.

 Government 
 Main article: Government of the Brussels-Capital Region Charles Picqué has since 2004 been Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region . 
The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three regions of Belgium , while the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community do exercise, each for their part, their cultural competencies on the territory of the region. French and Dutch are the official languages; most public services are bilingual (exceptions being education and a couple of others). The Capital Region is predominantly French-speaking —about 85–90% [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] of the population are French-speakers (including migrants and second language speakers), and about 10–15% [ 23 ] [ 24 ] are native Dutch-speakers. In January 2006, of its registered inhabitants, 73.1% are Belgian nationals, 4.1% French nationals, 12.0% other EU nationals (usually expressing themselves in either French or English), 4.0% Moroccan nationals, and 6.8% other non-EU nationals. [ 25 ] 

 Institutions 

Because of how the federalisation was handled in Belgium, but also because of the fact that the municipalities in the region did not take part in the merger that affected municipalities in the rest of Belgium in the seventies, the public institutions in Brussels offer a bewildering complexity. The complexity is more apparent in the lawbooks than in the facts, since the members of the Brussels Parliament and Government also act in other capacities, e.g. as members of the council of the Brussels agglomeration or the community commissions. One distinguishes:

 Parliament 
 Main article: Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region Brussels Parliament building 
The region, with a regional parliament of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking, parties are organised on a linguistic basis), plus a regional government, consisting of an officially linguistically neutral, but in practice French-speaking minister-president, two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. This parliament can enact ordinances (French: ordonnances , Dutch: ordonnanties ), which have equal status as a national legislative act.

 The agglomeration, with a council and a board, with the same membership as the organs of the Brussels Region. This is a decentralised administrative public body, assuming competences which elsewhere in Belgium are exercised by municipalities or provinces (fire brigade, waste disposal). The by-laws enacted by it do not have the status of a legislative act. 

 A bi-communitarian public authority, Common Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire commune, COCOM , Dutch: Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC ), with a United Assembly (i.e. the members of the regional parliament) and a United Board (the ministers—not the secretaries of state—of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote). This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare competencies of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise competencies in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (e.g. a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel ). The Common Community Commission is competent for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (e.g. the centra for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient. 

 The Brussels Region is not a province, nor does it belong to one. Within the Region, 99% of the provincial competencies are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions. Remaining is only the governor of Brussels-Capital and some aides. 

 6 inter-municipal policing zones 

 intercommunal societies created freely by the municipalities 

Also the federal state, the French Community and the Flemish Community exercise competencies on the territory of the region. 19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium , and until 2004 this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the Flemish Parliament . Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

Due to the multiple capacities of single members of parliament, there are parliamentarians who are at the same member of the Brussels Parliament, member of the Assembly of the Common Community Commission, member of the Assembly of the French Community Commission, member of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium and &quot;community senator&quot; in the Belgian Senate . At the moment, this is the case for Mr. François Roelants du Vivier (for the Mouvement Réformateur ), Mrs. Amina Derbaki Sbaï (since June 2004 for the Parti Socialiste , but beforehand, since 2003, for the Mouvement Réformateur) and Mrs Sfia Bouarfa (since 2001 for the Parti Socialiste).

 In Belgian politics 
 The Royal Palace of Brussels 
Despite what its name suggests, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of Belgium in itself. Article 194 of the Belgian Constitution lays down that the capital of Belgium is the City of Brussels , a smaller municipality within the capital region that once was the city&apos;s core. [ 26 ] 

However, although the City of Brussels is the official capital, the funds allowed by the federation and region for the representative role of the capital are divided among the 19 municipalities, and some national institutions are sited in the other 18 municipalities. Thus, while only the City of Brussels itself officially carries the title of capital of Belgium, in practice the entire capital region plays this role, and the national institutions of the Belgian state are spread loosely around the region. [ citation needed ] 

 Seat of the French Community and Flemish Community 

The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside Wallonia and the Flemish Region . Geographically and linguistically, it is a (bilingual) enclave in the (unilingual) Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium&apos;s complex institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels&apos; inhabitants must deal with either the French (speaking) community or the Flemish Community for matters such as culture and education. [ 27 ] 

Brussels is also the capital of both the French Community of Belgium ( Communauté française de Belgique in French) and of Flanders ( Vlaanderen ); all Flemish capital institutions are established here: Flemish Parliament , Flemish government and its administration. [ 28 ] 

 2 community-specific public authorities, French Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire française or COCOF ) and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, VGC ) for the Flemings in Brussels, with an assembly (i.e. the members of parliament of the linguistic group) and a board (the ministers and secretaries of state of the linguistic group). These commissions implement policies of the French Community and the Flemish Community in the Brussels-Capital Region. [ 27 ] 

 The French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative competencies of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area). [ 29 ] The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. [ 30 ] This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the communities and the other more on the regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts. 

 In international politics 

Brussels has since World War II become the administrative centre of many international organisations. Notably the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the WEU , WCO and EUROCONTROL as well as international corporations. Brussels is third in the number of international conferences it hosts [ 31 ] also becoming one of the largest convention centres in the world. [ 32 ] The presence of the EU and the other international bodies has for example led to there being more ambassadors and journalists in Brussels than in Washington D.C. . [ 33 ] International schools have also been established to serve this presence. [ 32 ] The &quot;international community&quot; in Brussels numbers at least 70,000 people, if you count staff at the EU institutions, the Nato headquarters and the diplomats, lobbyists and journalists who work alongside them. [ 34 ] In 2009, there were an estimated 286 lobbying consultancies known to work in Brussels. [ 35 ] 

 European Union 
 Main article: Brussels and the European Union 
Brussels serves as capital of the European Union , hosting the major political institutions of the Union . [ 7 ] The EU has not declared a capital formally, though the Treaty of Amsterdam formally gives Brussels the seat of the European Commission (the executive/government branch) and the Council of the European Union (a legislative institution made up from leaders of member states). [ 36 ] [ 37 ] It locates the formal seat of European Parliament in the French city of Strasbourg , where votes take place with the Council on the proposals made by the Commission. However meetings of political groups and committee groups are formally given to Brussels along with a set number of plenary sessions. Three quarters of Parliament now takes place at its Brussels hemicycle . [ 38 ] Between 2002 and 2004, the European Council also fixed its seat in the city. [ 39 ] 
 The heart of the European Quarter, looking down the Rue de la Loi towards the centre of the city. The presence of the EU institutions has had a colossal impact on the development of Brussels. 
Brussels, along with Luxembourg and Strasbourg, began to host institutions in 1957, soon becoming the centre of activities as the Commission and Council based their activities in what has become the &quot; European Quarter &quot;. [ 36 ] Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled with little planning, the current major buildings are the Berlaymont building of the Commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the Justus Lipsius building of the Council and the Espace Léopold of Parliament. [ 37 ] Today the presence has increased considerably with the Commission alone occupying 865,000 m 2 within the &quot;European Quarter&quot; in the east of the city (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels [ 7 ] ). The concentration and density has caused concern that the presence of the institutions has caused a &quot; ghetto effect&quot; in that part of the city. [ 40 ] However the presence has contributed significantly to the importance of Brussels as an international centre. [ 33 ] 

 Demographics 

On 1 May 2008, the region had a population of 1,070,841 for 161.382 km 2 which gives a population density of 6,635 inhabitants per km²

However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels since the end of the 18th century, including political refugees ( Karl Marx , Victor Hugo , Pierre Joseph Proudhon , Léon Daudet e.g.) from neighbouring or more distanced countries as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can tell at least a foreign grandparent. And even among the Belgians, many became Belgian only recently.

The original Dutch dialect of Brussels ( Brussels ) is a form of Brabantic (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient Duchy of Brabant ) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called Brusseleers , many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing the Dutch language. Brussels and its suburbs evolved from a Dutch-dialect–speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines. For their French-speaking Bruxellois , it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, Bruxellois (like the Memelländer in interwar ethnic censuses in Memel ), Walloon (for people who migrated from the Wallonia Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels it is mainly either Flemish or Brusselaar (Dutch for an inhabitant) and often both. For the Brusseleers , many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.

The two largest foreign groups come from two francophone countries: France and Morocco . [ 25 ] The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region. [ 42 ] Nevertheless, about three out of four residents have the Belgian nationality. [ 43 ] |Dutch people]] or native speakers of French, thus roughly half of the inhabitants do not speak either French or Dutch as primary language.&lt;/ref&gt; [ 44 ] --&gt;In general the population of Brussels is younger and the gap between rich and poor is wider. Brussels also has a large concentration of Muslims, mostly of Turkish and Moroccan ancestry, and mainly French-speaking black Africans. Belgium does not collect statistics by ethnic background, so exact figures are unknown, but one estimate put then number of Muslims in Brussels at 15%. [ 45 ] 

Both immigration and its status as head of the European Commission made Brussels a really cosmopolitan city. The migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other EU-member states, speak Moroccan dialectal Arabic , French , Turkish , Spanish (most Spanish came from the Asturias , a minority from Andalusia and some from Catalonia and the Basque country ), Italian , Polish , Rif Berber , English and other languages, including those of every EU-member state in the expat communities. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.

Among all major migrants groups from outside the EU , a majority of the permanent residents have acquired the Belgian nationality.

Although historically (since the Counter-Reformation persecution and expulsion of Protestants by the Spanish in the 16th century) Roman Catholic , most people in Brussels are non-practising. About 10% of the population regularly attends church services. Among the religions , historically dominant Roman Catholicism prevailing mostly in a relaxed way, one finds large minorities of Muslims , atheists , agnosticists , and of the philosophical school of humanism , the latter mainly as laïcité-vrijzinnig (an approximate translation would be secularists or free thinkers ) or practicing Humanism as a life stance —Brussels houses several key organisations for both kinds. Other (recognised) religions ( Protestantism , Anglicanism , Orthodoxy and Judaism ) are practised by much smaller groups in Brussels. Recognised religions and Laïcité enjoy public funding and school courses: every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 must choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion—or Laïcité —inspired morals.

 Languages 
 Further information: Frenchification of Brussels Estimate of languages spoken at home (Capital Region, 2006) [ 46 ] 
       French only       French&amp;Dutch       French&amp;non-Dutch language       Dutch only       Neither French nor Dutch 
Since the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch-speaking , ( Brabantian to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French ( Belgian French to be exact) as the majority language and lingua franca . This language shift, the Frenchification of Brussels , is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] 
 Manneken Pis is seen as a symbol of French and Dutch cohabitation in Brussels. [ 49 ] 
Not only is French-speaking immigration responsible for the Frenchification of Brussels, but more importantly the language change over several generations from Dutch to French was performed in Brussels by the Flemish people themselves. The main reason for this was the political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time. [ 50 ] From 1880 on, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual, resulting in a rise of monolingual French-speakers after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century the number of monolingual French-speakers carried the day over the mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants. [ 51 ] 

Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border and the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use. [ 52 ] Through immigration, a further number of formerly Dutch-speaking municipalities in surrounding Flanders became majority French-speaking in the second half of the 20th century. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] This phenomenon is, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in all of Belgian politics . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] 

Given its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that Brussels plays as the capital city in a bilingual country, Flemish political parties demand that the entire Brussels-Capital Region be fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. They also demand that the contested Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde arrondissement will be separated from the Brussels region. However, the French-speaking population regards the language border as artificial [ 58 ] and demands the extension of the bilingual region to at least all six municipalities with language facilities in the surroundings of Brussels. [ 59 ] Flemish politicians have strongly rejected these proposals. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] 

 Culture 

 Architecture 
 The medieval Grand Place 
The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the mediaeval constructions on the Grand Place to the postmodern buildings of the EU institutions .

Main attractions include the Grand Place , since 1988 a UNESCO World Heritage Site , with the Gothic town hall in the old centre, the St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral and the Laken Castle with its large greenhouses. Another famous landmark is the Royal Palace .

The Atomium is a symbolic 103-metre (338 ft) tall structure that was built for the 1958 World’s Fair . It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a unit cell ). The architect A. Waterkeyn devoted the building to science. Next to the Atomium is the Mini-Europe park with 1:25 scale maquettes of famous buildings from across Europe.

The Manneken Pis , a bronze fountain of a small peeing boy is a famous tourist attraction and symbol of the city.

Other landmarks include the Cinquantenaire park with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart , Brussels Stock Exchange , the Palace of Justice and the buildings of EU institutions in the European Quarter .
 Cinquantenaire triumphal arch 
Cultural facilities include the Brussels Theatre and the La Monnaie Theatre and opera house. There is a wide array of museums, from the Royal Museum of Fine Art to the Museum of the Army and the Comic Museum . Brussels also has a lively music scene, with everything from opera houses and concert halls to music bars and techno clubs.

The city centre is notable for its Flemish town houses. Also particularly striking are the buildings in the Art Nouveau style by the Brussels architect Victor Horta . Some of Brussels&apos; districts were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau, and many buildings are in this style. Good examples include Schaerbeek , Etterbeek , Ixelles , and Saint-Gilles . Another example of Brussels Art Nouveau is the Stoclet Palace , by the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann . The modern buildings of Espace Leopold complete the picture.
 The Atomium in Heysel Park 
 Arts 

The city has had a renowned artist scene for many years. The famous Belgian surrealist René Magritte , for example, studied in Brussels. The city is also a capital of the comic strip; some treasured Belgian characters are Lucky Luke , Tintin , Cubitus , Gaston Lagaffe and Marsupilami . Throughout the city walls are painted with large motifs of comic book characters, and the interiors of some Metro stations are designed by artists. The Belgian Comics Museum combines two artistic leitmotifs of Brussels, being a museum devoted to Belgian comic strips, housed in the former Waucquez department store, designed by Victor Horta in the Art Nouveau style.

Brussels contains over 80 museums, [ 63 ] including the Museum of Modern Art, [ 64 ] and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium . The museum has an extensive collection of various painters, such as the Flemish painters like Bruegel , Rogier van der Weyden , Robert Campin , Anthony van Dyck , and Jacob Jordaens . The recently opened Magritte Museum houses the world&apos;s largest collection of the works of the surrealist René Magritte .

The King Baudouin Stadium is a concert and competition facility with a 50,000 seat capacity, the largest in Belgium. The site was formerly occupied by the Heysel Stadium .

 Gastronomy 
 Brussels is known for its local waffle (pictured) and chocolate. 
Brussels is known for its local waffle , its chocolate , its French fries and its numerous types of beers . The Brussels sprout was first cultivated in Brussels, hence its name.

The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 restaurants, and a number of high quality bars. Belgian cuisine is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there is a large number of cafés, bistros, and the usual range of international fast food chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; coffee houses are called the Salons de Thé. Also widespread are brasseries , which usually offer a large number of beers and typical national dishes.

Belgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of French cuisine with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include Brussels waffles (gaufres) and mussels (usually as &quot;moules frites,&quot; served with fries). The city is a stronghold of chocolate and pralines manufacturers with renowned companies like Godiva , Neuhaus and Leonidas . Numerous friteries are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh, hot, waffles are also sold on the street.

In addition to the regular selection of Belgian beer , the famous lambic style of beer is only brewed in and around Brussels, and the yeasts have their origin in the Senne valley. In mild contrast to the other versions, Kriek (cherry beer) enjoys outstanding popularity, as it does in the rest of Belgium. Kriek is available in almost every bar or restaurant.

 Economy 
 The Brussels Stock Exchange Further information: Economy of Belgium 
Serving as the centre of administration for Europe, Brussels&apos; economy is largely service-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of multinationals, by European institutions, by various administrations, and by related services, though it does have a number of notable craft industries, such as the Cantillon Brewery , a lambic brewery founded in 1900.

 Education 
 The Université Libre de Bruxelles 
There are several universities in Brussels. The two main universities are the Université Libre de Bruxelles , a French-speaking university with about 20,000 students in three campuses in the city (and two others outside), [ 65 ] and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel , a Dutch-speaking university with about 10,000 students. [ 66 ] Both universities originate from a single ancestor university founded in 1834, namely the Free University of Brussels , which was split in 1970 at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organisation of higher education.

Other universities include the Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis with 2,000 students, [ 67 ] the Catholic University of Brussels ( Katholieke Universiteit Brussel ), [ 68 ] the Royal Military Academy , a military college established in 1834 by a French colonel [ 69 ] and two drama schools founded in 1982: the French-speaking Conservatoire Royal and the Dutch-speaking Koninklijk Conservatorium . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] 

Still other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the Université Catholique de Louvain that has had its medical faculty in the city since 1973. [ 72 ] In addition the Boston University Brussels campus was established in 1972 and offers masters degrees in business administration and international relations. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the International School of Brussels with 1,450 pupils between 2½ and 18, [ 73 ] the British School of Brussels, and the four European Schools serving those working in the EU institutions . [ 74 ] 

 Transport 
 main article: Transport in Brussels High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ( ICE train in the North station pictured) 
 Connections 

Brussels is served by Brussels Airport , located in the nearby Flemish municipality of Zaventem , and by the smaller Brussels South Charleroi Airport , located near Charleroi (Wallonia), some 50 km (30 mi) from Brussels. Brussels is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to London by the Eurostar train via the Channel Tunnel (1hr 51 min); to Amsterdam, Paris (1hr 25 min) and Cologne by the Thalys ; and to Cologne and Frankfurt by the German ICE .

Brussels also has its own port on the Brussels-Scheldt Maritime Canal located in the northwest of the city. The Brussels-Charleroi Canal connects Brussels with the industrial areas of Wallonia .

 Public transport 

The Brussels Metro dates back to 1976, but underground lines known as premetro have been serviced by tramways since 1968. A comprehensive bus and tram network also covers the city.

An interticketing system means that a STIB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the city. The commuter services operated by De Lijn , TEC and SNCB will in the next few years be augmented by a metropolitan RER rail network around Brussels.

Since 2003 Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the Bremen company Cambio in partnership with STIB and local ridesharing company taxi stop. In 2006 shared bicycles were also introduced.

 Road network 
 Rue de la Loi is one of the city&apos;s main streets 
In medieval times Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north-south (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and east-west (Chaussée de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du Marché aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat). The ancient pattern of streets radiating from the Grand Place in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built over the River Zenne/Senne , over the city walls and over the railway connection between the North and South Stations .

As one expects of a capital city, Brussels is the hub of the fan of old national roads, the principal ones being clockwise the N1 (N to Breda ), N2 (E to Maastricht ), N3 (E to Aachen ), N4 (SE to Luxembourg ) N5 (S to Rheims ), N6 (SW to Maubeuge ), N8 (W to Koksijde ) and N9 (NW to Ostend ). [ 75 ] Usually named chaussées/steenwegen , these highways normally run in a straight line, but on occasion lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.

The town is skirted by the European route E19 (N-S) and the E40 (E-W), while the E411 leads away to the SE. Brussels has an orbital motorway , numbered R0 (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the &quot;ring&quot; (French: ring Dutch: grote ring ). It is pear-shaped as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents&apos; objections.

The city centre, sometimes known as &quot;the pentagon&quot;, is surrounded by an inner ring road, the &quot; small ring &quot; (French: petite ceinture , Dutch: kleine ring ), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 . These were built upon the site of the second set of city walls following their demolition. Metro line 2 runs under much of these.

On the eastern side of the city, the R21 (French: grande ceinture , grote ring in Dutch) is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from Laeken ( Laken ) to Uccle ( Ukkel ). Some premetro stations (see Brussels Metro ) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to Saint-Job.

 Grand&apos; Place-Grote Markt, Brussels 
 Brussels (French: Bruxelles , Dutch: Brussel ; [1] ) is
the capital city of Belgium .
As headquarters of many European institutions, Brussels might also
be considered something of a capital for the European Union .
Being at the crossroads of cultures (the Germanic in the North and
the Romance in the South) and playing an important role in Europe , Brussels fits the
definition of the archetypal &quot;melting pot&quot;, but still retains its
own unique character. Population of the Brussels metropolitan area
is just over 2 million.
 
 Districts 

Brussels is split into nineteen communes or gemeenten (municipalities/boroughs).
 High-rise and construction in Brussels 
 Bruxelles/Brussel -
Brussels encompasses many charming and beautiful attractions, with
deeply ornate buildings on the Grand&apos;Place (Grote Markt), and a
fish-and-crustacean overdose of St. Catherine&apos;s Square (Place
St-Catherine / Sint-Katelijneplein). Stroll along, (and stop in for
a drink) at one of the many bars on Place St-Géry (Sint-Goriks), or
max out your credit card on the trendy Rue Antoine Dansaert
(Antoine Dansaertstraat). Ixelles - Elsene - A vibrant
part of town with a high concentration of restaurants, bars and
other services to satisfy the good-looking or the heavy-spending.
Some wandering around will reveal small bookshops, affordable
ethnic restaurants or independent record shops tucked away in side
streets. The Matongé district just off Chaussée d&apos;Ixelles is the
city&apos;s main African neighbourhood. Marolles/Marollen - Not a municipality, but a neighbourhood
(part of Bruxelles - Brussel) close to the city&apos;s heart. Although
this was one of the few places where the Brussels dialect could
still be heard, this is rare nowadays. The area is best known for
the flea market held daily on the Place du Jeu de Balle
(Vossenplein) as well as a plethora of shops selling everything
from old radios and bent wipers to fine china and expensive Art
Nouveau trickets. Visit on Saturdays or Sundays. Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis - The city&apos;s bohemian epicentre with
thriving French, Portuguese, Spanish, Maghrebi and Polish
communities. The area around the Parvis de St-Gilles
(St-Gillisvoorplein) is the arty part, with the area around the
Chatelain and the Church of the Holy Trinity being decidedly more
yuppified. Like Schaerbeek, Saint-Gilles boasts several Art Nouveau
and Haussmann-style buildings. St-Josse/Sint-Joost - The smallest and poorest commune in Belgium, this predominantly Turkish commune might not always be
too pleasing on the eye but does have a few small, welcoming
streets. The mid-part of the Chaussée de Louvain is also home to a
relatively small Indo-Pakistani community, so this is the place to
head to for a tikka masala. Schaerbeek/Schaarbeek - While there might be little interest in
this commune to the casual visitor, it does host some very
ornate Art Nouveau buildings. The Chaussée de Haecht is also the
heart of Brussels&apos; vast Turkish neighbourhood. It has more Turkish
restaurants than you can shake a pide at. Jette - Jette, together with Koekelberg and Ganshoren, are
three communes in the north-west of Brussels. These
green(-ish), mainly residential communes house the Basilica of
Koekelberg on their shared territory. Uccle/Ukkel - Brussels&apos; poshest commune . Green,
bourgeois and starched like all posh communes should be.
Uccle has retained many of its charming medieval cul-de-sacs, tiny
squares and small townhouses as has nearby Watermael-Boitsfort
(Watermaal-Bosvoorde). Molenbeek - Commonly known as Molenbeek-St-Jean (or
Sint-Jans-Molenbeek). A commune with an overwhelmingly
large Moroccan and, lately, Romanian population. With a reputation
for being unwelcoming, if not downright dangerous, this is a place
few locals venture to - let alone tourists. WSP/WSL -
Woluwé-Saint-Pierre and Woluwé-Saint-Lambert are two communes at the eastern end of the city. Mainly
residential, with a mixture of housing blocks, quaint
neighbourhoods and green areas this place is well-loved by
Eurocrats and other professional types. The enormous Wolubilis
cultural complex is well worth a visit. 
 Brussels Historic Center 
As Brussels became the capital city of a new country in the 19th
century, the old town was destroyed to make way for brand new
ministries, palaces, schools, army barracks and office blocks all
built between 1880 and 1980. Unfortunately, that is why such a
disappointingly small historic centre (one square and four adjacent
streets) was preserved, and why most tourists only visit Brussels
as an afterthought. Travellers concentrate on the classic top 4 of
Belgium : Bruges ,
Kemmelberg, Kortrijk and Oostende .

Brussels operates as a bilingual city where both French and
Dutch are official languages. Thus all the streets have two names,
which can sound totally different. For example, the Main Square is
called both la Grand Place and de Grote Markt .
Although French is the lingua franca, West-Flemmish can be very
useful, especially in the European District. English is also widely
understood, but not always widely spoken.

You can see what&apos;s going on in Brussels by picking up a copy of
local free city rag Zone 02. Another good free listings paper is
Agenda, which is distributed together with the dutch-language
weekly Brussel Deze Week and has the notable advantage of being
published in three languages (English, Dutch, French). Both of
these are distributed in cafés and bars around the city. If you&apos;re
looking for a good party, online listing Net Events (French and
Dutch) and Ready2Move, are a good place to start.

Brussels Agenda is the official cultural and entertainment
agenda of the City of Brussels and the francophone Médiatheque have
a website featuring the upcoming concerts in Brussels and the rest
of Belgium. Be aware, however, that their listings page is
specialised so it only features the concerts the Médiatheque staff
are interested in.

The most widely read English magazine is The Bulletin which,
apart from covering Belgian and EU news, also offers arts and
lifestyle stories, as well as in-depth events listings and a TV
guide.

 Brussels Airlines [2] serve Brussels from
many destinations worldwide. 

Brussels&apos; main airport is Brussels International Airport-
previously known as Zaventem (IATA code BRU). From the airport, a
train (€5.05) runs every 15 mins to Brussels Nord, with the journey
taking 15 minutes. There is also a bus (numbers 12 and 21) (€3, or
€4 on board) every 20 to 30 minutes via Rondpoint Schumann to the
Place de Luxembourg district, from where the same ticket is valid
for another 30 minutes on the metro or busses into the centre. A
taxi to the centre costs around €25 when booked in advance,
otherwise around €35. Taxis bleus: +32 (0)2 268 0000, Taxi
Brussels: +32 (0)2 411 4142, Taxis verts: +32 (0)2 349
4949. Beware of hidden charges, Taxis verts may quote you one price
over the phone, but they charge an additional € 25 plus parking if
your flight is delayed. Always confirm the final charge with your
driver before getting in the car. If you&apos;ve just arrived at the
airport&apos;s train station, first check the time of the next train
then go up one level and check whether a bus 12 or 21 is about to
depart and take whichever is quicker depending on your final
destination. For fix-rate taxi and minibus services visit [3] . They can
take you anywhere in Belgium, not only Brussels.

There are several budget airlines, including Ryanair [4] and Wizzair [5] ,
who fly to Charleroi airport. This airport is south of Brussels
(IATA code CRL) and one hour away from Brussels Midi Station at the
city centre by shuttle bus (€ 13 one way, €22 return), or by train
to Charleroi Sud station and then by TEC Bus A (€2.50 one way)
direct from Station to the airport. You can also get a taxi from
the airport to the city centre, but this will cost a fixed price of
approximately €90. The best deal is to book a shared airport
transfer at www.charleroitransfer.com [6] , the only door to
door minibus company at Charleroi Airport (price for groups start
from €10).

Brussels airport has a luggage locker service (Floor 0) where
one can leave their luggage for a fixed duration. The lockers say
that you will have to retrieve your luggage within 72 hours or else
they will be taken out. But they will actually be moved to the room
adjacent and stored there until you retrieve them. This is a useful
facility for people wanting to stow away big suitcases somewhere
safe. The rate is €7.50 per day.

Antwerp airport (IATA code ANR) also has a good train connection
to Brussels.
 
 By train 

Brussels has three main train stations: Bruxelles
Midi-Brussel Zuid , to the south of the city core, Bruxelles Central-Brussel Centraal , which is right
next to the city centre, and Bruxelles Nord-Brussel
Noord , to the north of the city center (at Place
Rogier ). Unfortunately, high-speed trains stop only at
Midi/Zuid, so you need to take the tram (or an ordinary train) a
few stops north to get to Grand Place.

 The high speed Thalys train connects Brussels with Cologne (2h23), Paris (1h20) and Amsterdam (2h00). There are
numerous rebates for in advance, to over €150 single on the
day. There is also an hourly Intercity train from Brussels
midi/central/north to Amsterdam (via Rotterdam , The Hague , Schiphol Airport ). A day return from Brussels
to Amsterdam takes 2:50 hours. You don&apos;t need a reservation. A
weekend return ticket costs €41.40. The Eurostar train line links Midi/Zuid with Lille Europe (39m from €22), Ashford (1h38m from €40) and London St. Pancras (1h51m from €40). Most Eurostar tickets are also valid
for internal train travel in Belgium (to and from any Belgian train
station within 24h of the validity of the Eurostar ticket), so once
in Belgium travel is free for the day. Check in the bottom left
hand corner of your ticket and confirm this before you get on the
train. Eurostar bookings and queries at tel: 02 528 28 28. German ICE connects thrice a day to Frankfurt (€93 one way, &quot;Europa Spezial
Belgien&quot; offer starting from €29). 

 Eurolines , +32 (0)2 274 1350 (U.K. +44 08 705 143 219), Fax +32 (0)2 201 1140.
Offers bus travel from many countries to Brussels, for example 8
hours from London Victoria station at € 39. In Brussels, they stop
outside the Gare du Nord-Noordstation and Gare du Midi-Zuidstation
train stations. 

 Gulliver&apos;s , +49 (3)0 311 0211. Offers
bus travel from Germany to many countries, for example 11 hours
from Hamburg at €19 in
advance, €46 normal price. 
 Grand&apos; Place-Grote Markt, Brussels 
Brussels revamped its metro at the start of April 2009 to boast
six lines, and at the same time rescheduled several tram and bus
routes. Most are run by STIB-MIVB [7] except for some regional buses, which are run by De lijn [8] and Le Tec [9] .

A card that can be used for ten rides on public transport costs
€12.30. One hour tickets cost €1.70 if pre-purchased and are
available from the driver for €2. One, five and ten ride tickets
are available at almost all metro and train stations. There are
also one-day tickets available, for €4.50 .

You validate the ticket in the small orange machines located in
buses/trams, or at the entrance to metro stations/major tram stops.
The orange machines time-stamp the ticket, both in ink and
magnetically, and it will be valid for one hour. You can interrupt
your ride and interchangeably use any STIB/MIVB transport. You
should revalidate your ticket for each new ride. Other forms of
transport are:

 The train service NMBS/SNCB, +32 (0)2 528 2828, [10] . The Flemish region (Dutch speaking) public bus service De Lijn, +32 070 220 200, [11] . The Walloon region (French speaking) public bus company TEC, +32 010 23 5353, [12] .
(Website in 3 languages: German, English and Dutch). 
 
 By bike 

Since 2009, the city offers low-cost short-term &quot;Villo&quot; rentals
at 180 locations near the central city. The system only accepts
Smart cards (the ones with an electronic chip and activated by a
PIN code), it does not accept the regular magnetic stripe cards.
The first half hour is free, the next costs €0.50. Registration
costs €1.50 for a day and €7 for a week. The year long ticket costs
€30. It is advisable to wear a helmet and a fluo vest (not
mandatory). The bikes are robust, but rather heavy. More detailed
information can be found online at Villo (English, French and
Dutch). [13] .

 Brussels Bike Tours [14] . They take you
on an easy (no hills) ride that lets you discover the city in just
4 hours. 
 
 Talk 

Brussels has two official languages: French (80%) and Dutch
(20%). Historically Dutch-speaking, Brussels became more and more
French-speaking over the 19th and 20th centuries. Today a majority
of inhabitants are native French-speakers. Due to international
institutions, English has become the second spoken language but it
is still relatively rare to find written tourist or general
information in English (although the situation is improving very
slowly). All oral information in the train stations is only in
French and Dutch. English information is also given in subways. Do
not hesitate to ask someone if you do not understand what has been
said.

Considering the city&apos;s location and that it markets itself as
the capital of Europe, spoken English is less prevalent in Belgium
than its Dutch neighbor. However, even if it is not as widely
spoken as one may expect, it is nonetheless widely understood. As
is generally the case elsewhere, the rate of success of finding
someone who can speak English depends on several factors: notably
age (14-35 year olds are most likely to speak English).

German is also an official language of Belgium, it is spoken by
about 40,000 people located in the southeast corner of Belgium
bordering Germany.
 Manneken Pis 
 Grand Place-Grote Markt , [15] . Surrounded by the city tower and a range of
beautiful 300 year old buildings. In the evening, surrounded by
bright lumination, it is simply ravishing. Some evenings a music
and light show is provided with the buildings serving as a canvas.
Have a &quot;gaufre de Liège-Luikse wafel&quot; here (Belgian waffle with
caramelized sugar)—the best ones are available from the little
shops off the northeast corner of the Grand Place-Grote
Markt.   edit 

 Manneken Pis , [16] . Just a short walk from the Grand Place-Grote
Markt is the Manneken Pis, a small bronze statue thought to
represent the &quot;irreverent spirit&quot; of Brussels. This statue of a
child performing one of Nature&apos;s most basic functions is believed
to have been inspired by a child who, while in a tree, found a
special way to drive away invading troops. Belgians have created
hundreds of outfits for this statue. One story goes that a father
was missing his child and made a declaration to the city that when
he found him he would build a statue of him, doing whatever it was
that he was doing. Thus, a statue of a little boy peeing was
created.   edit 

 Statue of Europe &quot;Unity in Peace&quot; [17] -
This monumental work is dedicated to Europe and carries a universal
message of brotherhood, tolerance and hope (French sculptor Bernard
Romain) 

 Parc du Cinquantenaire-Jubelpark - Definitely
check out the Arc de Triomphe-Triomfboog on the
east side of town. It&apos;s in the Parc du Cinquantenaire-Jubelpark. It
is possible to go up to the terrasse above the arch, from where
you&apos;ll have a good view of the city. Entry is through the Royal
Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History and is free.
Take Metro line 1 east, exit Schuman and walk east or exit Mérode

roof (connected by a passage). The collection shows off works, most
of them Belgian, from the 14th to the 20th century, starting in the
historical section, with Hans Memling&apos;s portraits from the late
15th century, which are marked by sharp lifelike details, works by
Hiëronymus Bosch, and Lucas Cranach&apos;s Adam and Eve. You should

Brueghel, including his Adoration of the Magi. Don&apos;t miss his
unusual Fall of the Rebel Angels, with grotesque faces and beasts.

Flemish village life, are of a less fiery nature. Later artists
represented include Rubens, Van Dyck, Frans Hals, and Rembrandt.
Next door, in a circular building connected to the main entrance,
the modern art section has an emphasis on underground works - if
only because the museum&apos;s eight floors are all below ground level.

Ernst, Chagall, Miró, and local boys Magritte, Delvaux, De

bleak Chilean cinema vérité flick? Only at Nova. Nova Cinema, 3
rue Arenberg-Arenbergstraat, Brussels 1000 .

- Koninginnegalerij, Brussels 1000 . 

 Musée du Cinema/Filmmuseum [36] is part of the Centre for
Fine Arts and features a carefully chosen selection of contemporary

the building (due to be restored soon) but also the fact that the
entrance fee is cheap. So if you can&apos;t live without your dose of
Werner Herzog or Jan Svankmajer fret not - this place won&apos;t cost
you an arm and a leg. Royal Film Museum, 9 Rue Baron Horta -
Baron Hortastraat, Brussels 1000 . 

 Vendome , 18 Chaussée de Wavre,

sound and images factory&apos;. Quite an apt description - arthouse
films, theatre pieces or world-renowned musicians are all featured
here. Flagey, Place Sainte-Croix - Heilig-kruisplein,
Ixelles-Elsene 1050 . 

 UGC De Brouckère [39] -

useful to check out whats on.

site selling classical tickets, but has an excellent rundown of all
the upcoming classical concerts. 

 Wallonie Tourism [46] is brought to you by the French Speaking Tourist board. 

 Ancienne Belgique [47] for popular concerts,
where the stadium bands stop in. 

 Brussels Events Listings [48] is a roundup of
events for an English speaking audience, this is good for some of
the the smaller and Expat focussed venues. 
 Galeries Saint Hubert Chocolate! 
Very few shops in Brussels open before 10AM, and most kick off
about 10:30-11AM. Many shops are closed on Sunday and Monday.

 Shopping at Galeries Saint Hubert-Sint
Hubertusgalerijen . The world&apos;s first shopping mall, opened
in 1847, is a light and airy triple-gallery enclosing boutiques,
bookshops, cafés, restaurants, and a theater and cinema. 

 Marché aux Puces - Vlooienmarkt (Flea Market) .
Place du Jeu de Balle-Vossenplein, every day from 7AM to 2PM. This
flea market offers everything from the weird to the wonderful at
rock-bottom prices. 

 Beer :
 Belgium Beer Tour [49] is a tour operator specializing in tours of Belgium breweries. It
offers a great way for beer lovers to visit their favourite
breweries and discover new ones. The tours cover a wide range of
beers and appeals to connoisseurs and amateurs alike Beer Mania [50] , 174-176 Chausse de Wavre,
1050 Ixelles. Claims to have a stock of over 400 beers, but has
been overrun by beer tourists. The stock is extensive, but quite
pricey in comparison to GB, Del Haize, or Carrefour. Beer Mania is
a great place to find out of the ordinary beers. GB/Carrefour. Branches around the city carry a wide variety of
beers, including almost all Trappist beer. Selection varies by
store. The GB in Grand Place has a large selection and is
approximately 33% of the price of the tourist shops. Delhaize. Similar to GB/Carrefour, but a tad more
expensive. Match. Another store similar to GB/Carrefour, but has more of
the unusual Belgian beers including Delerium. 
 

 Film  :
 Cinema Excellence, 94 - 96 Boulevard Anspachlaan. A must for
all movielovers. Great collection classics and rare dvd&apos;s, books,
vintage movie posters, screenprints, postcards, Tel +32 2 502 84
68. 
 

 Books :
 Comic books and rare books. De Slegte on Rue des Grands
Carmes-Lievevrouwbroersstraat, FNAC on Rue Neuve-Nieuwstra, 100
Boulevard Anspachlaan. Right in the center and one of the most up
to date stores when it comes to contemporary comics. Filigranes, the largest bookshop in Brussels, open 7 days a
week, and features a small bar/café inside and quite often live
music, located at 39 Avenue des Arts-Kunstlaan. Sterling Books, One of the more popular English bookshops in
downtown Brussels. Pele-Mele, Boulevard Maurice Lemonnierlaan, 55&amp;59 (Metro
&quot;Anneessens&quot;) - maze-like, second-hand bookshop with huge selection
of used books at bargain prices. A bookworm&apos;s haven. Waterstone&apos;s, 71-75 Boulevard Adolphe Maxlaan (Metro &quot;De
Brouckère&quot;). English-language books. FNAC, City 2 commercial center, Rue neuve. A big
book/CD/DVD/electronics shop. Mediamarket, 111-123 Rue Neuve. This shop is at the uppermost
level of the Galeria Inno department store. Sells CDs, DVDs and
consumer electronics. Slightly cheaper than FNAC. 
 

 Chocolate :
 Leonidas [51] , branches across the city.
Inexpensive and good quality, at €4.35 for 250gm, and very popular
with the locals. Neuhaus [52] ,
branches across the city. A bit more expensive than Leonidas and a
bit higher quality. Very popular with the locals as well. Marcolini [53] , 39 Place
du Grand Sablon. Arguably the best Belgian chocolates and priced
accordingly. The country-specific products are difficult to find
and quite worth the price. Wittamer, 6-12-13 Place du Grand Sablon. Another excellent
chocolate maker. Chocopolis, 81 Rue du Marché aux Herbes. Between Grand Place
and Central Station. Pick and choose your favorite type of
chocolates, all at reasonable prices. Maison Renardy 17, rue de Dublin 1050 +32 02 514 30 17
Bruxelles. A great boutique shop with delicious chocolate and
friendly service. Stop by for a cup of tea or coffee, and get one
of their chocolates free with your tea. Still peckish? You&apos;re able
to bring a whole box home. Godiva, branches around the city. Not very popular and quite
pricey. For the frugal, you can buy 100-200 gram gourmet bars of
chocolate in grocery stores for about €1 each. Good brands to buy
are Côte-d&apos;Or and Jacques, both are Belgian. 
 

 Shopping :
 General shopping along Rue Neuve-Nieuwstraat with GB
supermarket at City 2 accessed from Rue Neuve-Nieuwstraat and Metro
Rogier. Galeria Inno, 111-123 Rue Neuve. Department store (fashion,
cosmetics, etc.) Belgian Lace is among the best in the world.
Several shops are located at the Grand&apos; Place-Grote Markt itself.
Beware of some shops that sell Belgian lace even though production
was outsourced abroad. Ask for a country of origin if purchasing
around Grand Place. 
 

 
 Chocolate until you drop 

Brussels is chock full of chocolates, but the ultimate
indulgence for the chocoholic is Place du Grand Sablon-Grote Zavel,
where you will find three shops selling some of the best chocolate
in the world: Neuhaus , Pierre
Marcolini and Wittamer . Each store has
its own specialties: Pierre Marcolini&apos;s take-away cakes and ice
cream are reasons to be tempted, while Wittamer is the only one
with a cafe on premises and also sells the ultimate hot chocolate. Passion Chocolat (20 Rue Vanderlinden) is a bit
out of the way but its artisan chocolate is worth a visit, and you
can taste lots of it for free at the entrance.
 

There is plenty of good eating to be had in Brussels. Most
people concentrate on the three classics: mussels ( moules ), fries ( frites ) and chocolate . A few more adventurous bruxellois dishes include anguilles au vert / paling
in&apos;t groen (river eels in green sauce), meat balls in tomato
sauce, stoemp (mashed vegetables and potatoes) and turbot waterzooi (turbot fish in cream and egg sauce). For
dessert, try a Belgian waffle ( gauffre ),
also available in a square Brussels version dusted with powdered
sugar, and choices of bananas, whipped cream and many other
toppings. Although many prefer the round, caramelized version from Liège .
 
 Budget 

The matter over which establishment serves up the best frites
(locally known as fritkots ) remains a matter of heated
debate. Some argue that the best frites in Brussels are served at
the fritkot near the Barriere de Saint-Gilles, while others defend
St-Josse&apos;s Martin (Place Saint-Josse/Sint-Joostplein) as the prime
purveyor of the authentic Brussels frite just as others claim
Antoine (Place Jourdan/Jourdanplein) remains the king of the local
french fry. No matter which fritkot you&apos;re at, try to be
adventurous and have something other than ketchup or mayonnaise on
your fries. Of the selection of bizarre sauces you&apos;ve never seen
before, &quot;andalouse&quot; is probably the most popular with the
locals.

 FRITKOTS 

 Maison Antoine , Place Jourdanplein -
tasty fries with a large collection of sauces situated on a square
close to the European Parliament. You can eat your fries
( frites ) in one of the several bars/cafés that carries the
sign frites acceptés . Vegetarians be careful. Fries are
cooked in Beef fat. 

 Chez Martin . The small nondescript fritkot
plonked on Place Saint-Josse/Sint-Joost
(Saint-Josse-ten-Noode/Sint-Joost-ten-Node) and run by the calm and
affable Martin is a serious contender for the best friterie in
Brussels. You can eat your frites at the nearby Cafe Gambrinus and
wash them down with a pintje or two. Martin is retiring on
December 26, 2009, so the place will close after that date. 

 La Friterie de la Place de la Chapelle , rue
Haute-Hoogstraat (near Les Marolles). Another personal choice for
the best frites in Brussels: the big chunks of potato,
fried golden, and served with the usual dazzling array of
sauces. 

 La Friterie de la Barrière , rue du Parc -
Parkstraat (just off the Barrière de St-Gilles). Golden and crispy
frites - just the way they should be. This exterior of this fritkot
also serves as mini-museum with several tracts, articles and other
literature on the fronts and sides of the shack on the good ol&apos;
Belgian frite. 

 OTHERS 

 Arcadi , 1B rue d&apos;Aremberg, just at the
exit of &quot;Galleries de la Reine&quot;, in the direction opposite to the
Grand-Place - a quirky combination of old and new, the menu
ranges all over the place but the reason people flock here is the
selection of over 30 sweet and savoury pies ( tartes ). A
slice big enough for a meal, served with salad, costs €4-6. 

 Snack Pizzeria Porte de Halle , Avenue Henri
Jaspar, 134, directly across the city ring from Porte de Halle. The
gentlemen running the place speak a little bit of English and serve
the best donar kebap and pizza in the neighborhood. The #39-Pizza
Porte De Halle is probably their best pizza. Tel. 02/534 0051; Open
11:00 - 23:00 w/free delivery on orders over €10 

 Sel et Sucre Creperie - Glacier , Avenue des
Celtes, 4, near Merode subway station, Parc du
Cinquantenaire-Jubelpark and the Arc de Triomphe-Triomfbloog. The
fantastic crepes and friendly service makes up for the ordinary
decor and just around the corner from the Arc de
Triomphe-Triomfbloog. Open 12:00 - 22:00. 

 Mamma Roma , 3 shops: Flagey (Chaussee de
Vleurgat 5), Chatelain (Rue du Page 5) and Place Jourdan. Small
pizzeria for eat-in (bar-style seating) or takeaway, sold by
weight. Delicious crunchy base and some unusual toppings (one was
spicy with walnuts, very tasty). Long queues but speedy service,
deals available for pizza + drinks. 
 
 Delivery 

Quality food is available online in and around Brussels from
various companies, including [54] .
 Rue des Bouchers, bustling on a Saturday night 
Brussels&apos; tourist restaurant gauntlet can be found in Rue des
Bouchers-Beenhouwerstraat, just to the north of Grand Place. The
place has a bad reputation for waiters imposing themselves on
passers-by, trying to lure customers into their restaurant. The
authorities are aware of this, and are trying to take measures.
Some restaurants may also tempt you with cheap prices for the
menus, but when seated, the item on the menu happens to be
unavailable, and you&apos;re forced to accept another, noticeably more
expensive dish. Often, the exaggerated price of the wines will also
compensate for the attractive menu. Knowing this however, you may
be able to negotiate a better deal before entering.

A few restaurants stand out from the crowd though:

 Aux Armes de Bruxelles , 13 Rue des
Bouchers-Beenhouwerstraat, +32 (0)2 511 5550. Closed Mondays. Basic
honest food, including some very decent moules. Crowded, although
worth the wait. 

 Chez Léon , 18, Rue des Bouchers, +32 (0)2 511
1415, [55] . Now franchised into
France as well, this is the original and while it&apos;s huge and looks
like a tourist trap, the moules are excellent and it&apos;s
packed every day. Moules, beer and a starter will set you back €25,
and kids eat for free. 

 Scheltema , 7, Rue des Dominicains, +32 (0)2
512 2084. Specializes in fresh and tasty seafood. 

Outside the Rue des Bouchers, you may try:

 Au Pré Salé , 20, Rue de
Flandre-Vlaamsesteenweg ( near place St Catherine ), +32
(0)2 513 6545. A former butcher shop, locals flock here for some of
the best moules in town, sold by the kilo (figure on €24)
and served up in half a dozen ways. Also serves the full range of
other Brussels favorites. 

 Falstaff , 19, Rue Henri Mausstraat 19 ( by
the Bourse-Beurs ). Has cheap and decent food and is open every
day until 2AM, around €20-30. 

 Le Beau Soleil , 7, Rue Joseph Lebeau
( Sablon area ). This tiny restaurant (approx. 14 seats)
looks like a violin workshop, so you sit next to all the tools and
half finished violins. Unlike other Belgian restaurants, it is open
from 9AM to 5PM (Mo-Fr), 9AM to 6PM (Sat,Sun), closed on Wednesday.

 Drink 

Belgium is to beer what France is to wine, it is home to one of
the greatest beer traditions in the world, and Brussels is a great
place to sample some of the vast variety on offer. Typical beers of
Brussels are gueuze (rather bitter) and kriek (rather sweet, cherry based).

A special drink only found in Brussels is the &quot;half-en-half&quot;
(&quot;half and half&quot;). It&apos;s a mixture of white wine and champagne.

chess board. Shh! 

 Brasserie Verschueren , 11-13 Parvis de

institution in hip Saint-Gilles. Under the watchful eye of the

 Stay safe 

Brussels is generally a safe city. Some suburban neighborhoods
have a poor reputation, but travellers are unlikely to visit them.
The neighborhoods of Schaarbeek, Brussels North and Brussels Center
should be avoided at night if possible. However, pickpockets,
sometimes in teams, operate in crowded tourist areas, and the train
and metro stations (particularly at night) attract drug addicts and
other shady types. Travellers should be particularly alert for
distractions such as being asked for the time or directions and
having attention diverted from their hand or shopping bag.
Travelling with laptops at anytime is strongly discouraged.

of Brussels:

 Waterloo - About 15 km
