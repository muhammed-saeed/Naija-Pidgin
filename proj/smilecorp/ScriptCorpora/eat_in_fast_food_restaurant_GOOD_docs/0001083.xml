(Photo by George Pacciello/staff photographer) RARITAN TWP.—The new retro-future-themed Sonic restaurant on Route 31 South may open as early as Tuesday morning, August 31.
Those on Route 31 driving by Healthquest and the Stop&amp;Shop market may have noticed the speedy construction of the Sonic Drive-in.

The national chain offers varied items such as burgers, chicken, salads and shakes.
Sonic gives fast food a whole different twist, with servers rolling up to car windows delivering meals ordered via electronic menu boards, drive-thru. There is no seating inside, but there is a patio area with a menu board as well as a drive-thru for people who want to eat the food elsewhere.

Franchise co-owner Robert Mascia, who grew up in Somerset County, said today that he hopes to open it by Tuesday, August 31 at 9 a.m.; regular hours after opening week will be 6 a.m. to around midnight, he added.

The construction crew is finishing up and Mascia has been training the staff, partly at the Green Brook Sonic which he also co-owns.

There will be 60 employees at Sonic here, mostly part-timers. Mascia said about 15% of them will be servers and 90% of them are local residents.“We love the town and love the people,”he said adding that he is excited to be opening the restaurant but it’s been“hard work.”


All servers are tested for skating“proficiency,”Mascia noted. They have to be able to carry a tray, with drinks, while roller-skating and be able to stop.

They are given the option of using in-line or the old-style four wheel“quad”skates. Furthermore, they can use their own skates or get a pair from the restaurant.

Sonic eateries are open year-round. During any type of“inclement weather they go right to sneakers,”Mascia said, explaining that the servers must wear sneakers if the conditions are dangerous.

watch4karma, I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re right - all thanks to Raritan Township and their crummy planning. Funny how there&apos;s no mention of the other owner, Cust, since it appears that Cust is one of the chosen few, anything he wants to do gets the green stamp from Raritan. You&apos;d think he was royalty or something.

oh, I would agree if this was any other fast food restaurant, but this is SONIC people! Home of the most awesome foot long chili cheese dog and the best cherry limeade you will ever have!!

he must b royalty or at least know somebody given how fast it went up before the residents heard about it. but then again the raritian mayor says he wants all the new construction he can get, saying it helps taxes (snicker snicker) . hey anybody see their taxes go down since they opened the walmart??

Says it helps taxes? The Mayor would love to see any new construction? Our township already looks like a chain store hole and he can&apos;t bring the taxes below 9%?

He is asking for a increase in his own salary after raising the taxes 9%? Anyone else see this? And he&apos;s ok with $185 increases for certain non union employees? J Christ, anyone else see this? These people don&apos;t have enough? Are you kidding me?

Go to the next Township meeting and voice your opinion to Mayor Anti-fiscal responsibility to your taxpayers!

What I do not like (on top of the fact the town is overloaded with unnecessary shopping malls) is that they dropped this Sonic right in front of my daughter&apos;s daycare. Now I need to fight with Sonic customers to get in the daycare parking lot? And what kind of creeps will be hanging out there?

Peanutmom What a ridiculous comment. Sonic is known for having &quot;creeps&quot; hang around? Sounds like sour grapes. Though you&apos;re traffic dilema may be inconvenient to you, think its rather disingenious to try and make it into a safety issue...

I think its ironic or worse that the owners of HealthQuest are renting part of their land to a greasy fast food chain opening just 50-yards from their entrance. Might it make things difficult for mom to keep her kids eating right when she has to walk them past the burgers, fries and sugary milkshakes? And how does the guy running HealthQuest&apos;s indoor restaurant feel about the competition?
