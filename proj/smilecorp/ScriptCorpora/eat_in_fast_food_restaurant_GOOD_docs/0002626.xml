 April 23, 2012 Likes it LOVE IT by Cortney ( 1 review ) A friend and I try our hardest to make it to The Moosehead at least once a week. I love it so much. I did work there for a good while and really enjoyed that too. As far as all of the political signs go it makes the place interesting. Their views are not being pushed on you, there are not people running up to you and forcing you to listen to political opinions. The food is great, reminds me of that cafe you picture in movies that you just go to to have a good afternoon lunch with friends. The prices are reasonable and the service is usually good (just depends on the day I guess). ALL IN ALL LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful February 24, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Put Off by Republican Political Signs by Have Spork Will Travel ( 50 reviews ) I couldn&apos;t believe they had an Ann Coulter for President sign over the counter. I guess they assume everyone will agree with their extremist views but I don&apos;t and will not go there again. I agree with the other reviewer who said the service was awful. Walk the few steps to the other end of the block to Lee&apos;s China Inn. If you want a hamburger, Lee&apos;s has that on their American Choices part of their menu. 3 out of 3 found this review helpful May 3, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by mariorox3 ( 10 reviews ) Some good food, but enough with the Republican propaganda. I&apos;d like to eat without having my political views being shoved in my face all the time. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful December 16, 2010 Really likes it Moosehead Revisited by Captain Ozone ( 36 reviews ) I decided to give the Moosehead Cafe another chance and am very glad I did. The politics have been toned down and service is excellent. The food is the best in Crockett. My waitress seemed to be new and did not really know much about the menu but she took the time to get answers to my questions and was very nice and attentive to all the customers in her station. +2 more review from Captain Ozone February 19, 2010 Republican Headquarters This restaurant is the headquarters for the county&apos;s Republican Party and one of the organizational sites for the Tea Party Movement. The environment made me feel very uncomfortable because I did not want my patronage to be seen as an endorsement of these political activities and the overt campaigning and signs made me feel very unwelcome. That being said, the food is very good and moderatly priced. The service is marginal with the locals and regulars getting service at the expense of others. March 21, 2010 Mobile review Serinda, could the two earlier reviews mentioning poor service have anything to do with your being fired? And Kelly, can the two black employees come in through the front door? The owner has a right to her political views, as I also have the right not to eat there. September 13, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Horrible Place!!! by MR.E ( 1 review ) My first reaction to these&quot;people&quot;was OMG!! They are living like its 1950&apos;s!! They Think colors should not mix still!!! They are a bunch of backwoods rednecks!! It was very uncomfortable to sit there the main lady from what i could gather gave me attitude the entire time!! DO NOT ENTER THIS PLACE!! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful January 6, 2012 Pretty Good by Nicole Chloe Leslie ( 1 review ) The service was wonderful. The waittress was attentive and very sweet to our 2 yr old daughter. She even gave her a happy meal toy she happened to have. The sweet tea especially was good. My husband had the cheeseburger and said it was delicious. I had the moose strips (chicken) and although a bit chewy they were very good. My daughter&apos;s meal came in a pink dog bowl which was a little weird but kinda cute too. Very good atmosphere for a family. Yes there was a lot of political bumper stickers and all but it was very easy to ignore. March 1, 2010 by Serinda Jean ( 1 review ) The owners are racist. This is not opinion, it is fact. Joni McCreight, the owner, fired me when she found out that my boyfriend of 3 years was black. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful November 11, 2009 Likes it Moosehead cafe by Lancelm45 ( 1 review ) Very good food in friendly hometown style, milk shakes made with real hand dipped ice cream. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful August 28, 2010 Likes it Patriot by Victoria ( 1 review ) It is a wonderful place. As an American it is refreshing to see someone who stands up for what they beleive. In today times so many are afraid to speak up, so I applaud the owners. It shows their values and beliefs. And the food and serves was awsome. Keep up the good work. Every time we travel to East Texas we have to eat at the Moosehead Cafe. Thank you. 1 out of 2 found this review helpful November 15, 2011 Ralph Baughman by Ralph Baughman ( 1 review ) We Chose Moosehead Cafe For A Family Reunion For My 93 Year Old Aunt. We Anticipated About 40 People.We Contacted Joanie, The Owner. She Quoted A Price Of $ 10 Per Person. All In Clusive. We Reconfirmed This Price. Joanie, Said Yes, The Price Is Right. The Food Was Good. The Room Was Good. The Peach Cobbler Was Good. But At The End Of The Evening Time To Pay, Joanie Told Us The Price Per Person Was $ 20 Not $ 10 That She Had Quoted. She Said That She Forgot Some Items. And THe Price Was $ 20 Per Person. We Will Not Go To This Cafe Again And Will Any One Advise Any One Else To Do The Same.People That Do Not Keep Their Word. Are Not To Be Trusted. This Ruined A Delightful Evening July 30, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Rick ( 3 reviews ) Great country style food. Seems most who did not like this place was based on political reasons June 25, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Steve Smith ( 1 review ) Great atmosphere and food. Get a piece of pie! October 17, 2010 Likes it Moosehead Cafe by Carolyn ( 5 reviews ) You know.... I&apos;m a Pepsi person.......I really get sick and tired of Coke being shovel in my face. Everywhere you look you see advertising for coke and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back because I think they should keep their opinion to their self. Just because it&apos;s a free country doesn&apos;t mean they should put up anything up I don&apos;t like or agree with. I doesn&apos;t matter that the food is great or the service is good. They should only have MY opinions, MY likes and dislikes on display. There I said it......now take everything down and just have blank walls....and I don&apos;t like red either so get rid of all the red stuff. All kidding aside it&apos;s a great place to eat.....great food and great service.....some people just need to get that chip off their shoulder before going out in public. April 22, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Russell ( 2 reviews ) Had one of the best chicken fried steak sandwiches ever. Really great service and enjoyed the traditional American theme. Not too much and not too little. As for the Conservative decor? I felt right at home. March 10, 2010 Likes it BEST GRUB by Kelly ( 4 reviews ) the owner is an amazing woman. she has treated me fairly. she is not racist because she has two african americans working in her kitchen. as far as the republican sighns, she has the right to express her political views any way she wants, and as far as the food, it is the best i have eaten anywhere in Crockett. Moosehead Cafe is a family buisness and very friendly. Yes thier is a waitress there that helps pay for one customers meal at times, but then again she has that right. She likes to help take care of the less fortunate. So in my opinion, The Moosehead Cafe is a wonderful place. January 2, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Decent food/horrible service by Dexter Haynes ( 1 review ) We were staying in Crockett for a few days and decided to try a local cafe instead of a fast food restaurant , BIG Mistake...we walked in to the moosehead cafe and was greeted with a waitress shouting&quot;seat yourselves&quot;we made our way to an open table and had a seat, the waitress came over and gave us our menus and asked what we wanted to drink, as the first person in our party of 3 began to say what they wanted, the waitress turned her back to us and walked over to a nearby table, she returned within a few minutes and took the first persons drink order, and then decided to go answer a ringing phone, she returned a few moments later to finish our drink order. when we received our drinks there was a dead moth in one of the ice cubes floating in the top of one of the waters....YUCK....we go our food...fries were cold, burgers were decent......our waitress never decided to return and see if we needed anything or to refill our drinks. I have dined in hundreds of restaurants all over America, and have NEVER had such horrible service......in the slim chance we ever return to Crockett,TX, We will never return to the&quot;Moosehead Cafe&quot; July 5, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Terrible food/Great pies&amp;Service by Kevin Clarke ( 4 reviews ) We went to the cafe for lunch on July 3rd 2010 on our way back from Canton Texas . It was a mad house. We thought for sure this was a great place since it was so crowded. NOT SO. I ordered a ruben and my wife ordered a cheese steak. Not to make this boring they were BOTH terrible. Very little meat. The pies were the BEST.BTW there was a 8 year old boy going back and forth in the resturant on a razor ! Go to the steakhouse just around the corner it&apos;s best ! June 25, 2010 Likes it True Texas Treasure!!! by Brian ( 1 review ) Great Place - Great People! You feel like you step back 60 years into history to when Americans were Proud to be Americans. The food is good and the people are friendly. September 25, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Decent by Hi Roller ( 1 review ) Living in Crockett it doesn&apos;t take long to run out of places to eat. The wife and I have frequented the Moosehead on a number of occasions. The food is decent but the portions are a little small for me. Of course, I do like to eat. I must also add....I enjoy a balanced meal and I also like my politics a little more balanced as well. I also prefer my tea in a cup. I made the decision to stop patronizing the establishment because I am an independent who finds party loyalty to these extremes&quot;frightening&quot;. So, as an American with freedom to choose....I choose not to return...even though the food and atmosphere was decent.
