 This 
 one&apos;s a little complicated, folks, so pay attention.

Ready?

Okay.

So this chick totally orders chicken nuggets, right? But get this one 
 of them&apos;s like a friggin&apos; chicken head. And she totally almost eats it!

 Awwwwwwww ! Dude! That is so gross! 

 

 
 
If you&apos;ve ever worked in a fast food restaurant, the first thing you 
 learn is how to get high behind the garbage bin in the back, then get your 
 co-workers laughing by deep frying all the kid&apos;s meal toys.

But the second thing you learn the thing that&apos;s drummed into 
 your head the second you put on that dorky apron and visor is that the customer is always right . No matter how obscenely fat and stupid 
 they are, no matter how many superfluous chromosomes they have, no matter 
 how wrong they are, they&apos;re still right.

Mind you, it&apos;s not for the same reason the patrons at a classy upscale 
 steakhouse buying $70 platters and $100 bottles of wine are always right. 
 In that case it&apos;s more because of the Capitalist assumption that anybody 
 who can drop $300 on one meal is probably either in the habit of being 
 right about things or owns the biggest lucky money tree in Dumb-Ass 
 Forest. Either way, you have to say they&apos;re right or else they&apos;ll 
 foreclose on your home and sell your family into servanthood.

 But a fast 
 food restaurant basically works on the same principal as Richard Pryor&apos;s 
 penny scam from Superman III . That is, volume. They make profit 
 by pushing literally Metric Tons of dirt-cheap hamburger-shaped dog food 
 to the vast herds of customers who squeeze in the door. Here, the 
 customer is always right simply because nothing being sold is worth 
 arguing over. It would be like fighting over lint at a laundromat. 

Pretend you&apos;re the manager of Big Grease Burger Champ, and you&apos;re 
 trying to explain to a 19-year-old employee with Down&apos;s Syndrome how to 
 unplug a toilet. At the same time you&apos;re also yelling at some punk kids to 
 stop dicking around with the ketchup dispenser, yelling at your senior 
 citizen cashier to stop picking his nose in front of customers, and 
 yelling at the three Hispanics who can&apos;t speak English not to play&quot;Grab 
 The Nickel From the Bottom&quot;with the deep fryers.

Suddenly Joanna-May Burgertard drags her girth up to the counter and 
 focuses a solid beam of angry stupid at you. She insists she was only given five Chicky 
 Chunks instead of six, even though an idiot-proof machine dispenses them 
 in the back if you mash a large button in the center of a wall. All 
 tolled, she paid $4.69 for the food it cost you $.19 to prepare. You give 
 her another Chicky Chunk and apologize profusely, then run to the back 
 just in time to stop Greg from giving Danielle a kick-ass Slipknot tattoo 
 with a hot grill ladle.

That is not to say, however, that the burger conglomerates assume truth 
 behind every&quot;there&apos;s a boar tusk in my Pork Melt&quot;claim. The customer, 
 in their eyes, can always be&quot;right&quot;while also always being stench-laden 
 mentally handicapped liars.

 
 
 
 
 Once word got out that the customer was always 
 right at stores that serve trash (pick your interpretation), it didn&apos;t 
 take very long for people to realize that if they complained loud enough 
 about anything&quot;My burger had a band aid in it!&quot;&quot;I found a cigarette 
 butt in my fries!&quot;&quot;My sandwich was just this old boot! Give me a 
 sandwich, narc!&quot;fast food restaurants were happy to give them things, 
 in exchange for their agreement to go be idiots somewhere else and take 
 their clouds of urine-scented air with them. 

 As with any system in place that rewards selfishness 
 and idiocy with free food, it would seemingly be impossible for people to 
 abuse it. And yet oddly, this is precisely what happened. Back at their 
 tents and tire-forts, white trash families got together and brainstormed 
 into the night. This might not seem like a lot of mental wattage, but keep 
 in mind the average headcount for a family living below the poverty line 
 is something like 15 (so they can eat one if they need to and not miss it, 
 presumably). 

 The logic was flawless, sort of. In essence, if a) the customer is always right, and b) a minor error results 
 in a minor reward, then... c) we should hide a chicken head in our 
 food! DUDE! 

 Or something like that. The upshot, anyway, is one 
 of the most prevalent urban legends alive today: someone orders something, 
 usually eats some of it first, then discovers to their horror that they 
 were eating... a deep-fried rat! Or a chicken head! A Cockroach? Something 
 disgusting, anyway! They sue for millions and live in absolute luxury for 
 life. 

 The most realistic of them was the chicken head, in 
 that it had a photo and everything. And as we all well know, live 
 chickens, bread crumbs and oil do not exist outside the fast food 
 restaurants of 
 America without the strictest of licensing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It&apos;s 
 difficult to say for sure if this is made up or not. On one 
 hand, they all tend to follow a formula, which usually spells 
 bullshit. The item is always gross, and the person always puts 
 it in their mouth before noticing how gross it is, for maximum 
 audience reaction. Plus, the item is always just plausible 
 enough that you could think,&quot;Yeah, that makes sense,&quot;without 
 giving any explanation as to how a big rat might actually get 
 confused for a piece of chicken.

On the other hand, fast food is manufactured in vast, 
 sulfur-smelling underground complexes where no cameras are allowed and where faint howls can be heard night 
 and day. We hear that someone found a cherry tomato in their 
 chef salad that twitched and tried to suck air through tiny 
 gills, and we scoff. But after scoffing, we scratch our chins 
 and say,&quot;but how do we know for sure?&quot;

I spoke to a man who worked in the McDonald&apos;s corporation 
 McNugget complex in Bangkok. Basically, the process is as 
 follows:

Chickens are herded into a hangar-sized room, where their 
 feathers are stripped with a vaccuum device. The feathers are 
 gathered and the chickens are sent back to their owners.

DNA from the feathers is used to grow blobs of pulsing chicken 
 plasm in glass pods. Once mature, the blobs spawn tissue spores, 
 which are harvested and sprayed with concentrated soy-based meat 
 flavor varnish. The finished McNuggets are frozen and shipped.

Company officials say ALL live animals are restricted from the 
 McNugget spawning pool because 1) they don&apos;t like paying out 
 settlements for negligence lawsuits and 2) introducing actual 
 chicken meat would contaminate the entire McNugget pod crop.

So look at it this way. Would a corporation play fast-and-loose 
 with their chicken head prevention when they risk losing 
 millions to a lawsuit? Probably not.

Would a homeless McDonalds customer go through the trouble of 
 stealing a chicken head from the voodoo lady in the alley, then 
 breading and frying it, if they thought they had millions to win in a lawsuit? Probably.

Sorry, folks. The customer may always be right, but we&apos;ve gotta 
 go with the restaurant on this one.
