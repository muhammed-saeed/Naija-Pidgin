In addition to Shakespeare and the plays of the Royal Shakespeare Company, there is a variety of additional events and attractions on offer throughout the year to enthrall, divert and distract visitors and townsfolk alike.

There’s so much happening throughout the year in Stratford-upon-Avon, it’s why visitors keep coming back again and again. The Royal Shakespeare Theatre offers it’s usual array of exciting, world renowned plays, but there’s so much more on offer. Many festivals run throughout the year, some of which are hosted by the Civic Hall . Discover new authors at the Literary Festival, or sample the delights of local produce at the Food Festival.

Catch a film in the town cinema, take one of the many organised Walks and Tours on offer or simply stroll the town taking in the atmosphere of Stratfordupon- Avon’s unique street entertainers. An event definitely not to miss are the Shakespeare Birthday Celebrations, every year in April. The highlight of the weekend is undoubtedly the Procession through the town, and the unfurling of the flags

.Further afield you might want to test your luck and spend a day at the races, at Stratford Racecourse, or dance the night away at the Global Gathering.
