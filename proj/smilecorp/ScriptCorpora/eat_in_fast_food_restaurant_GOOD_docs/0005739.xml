Some Food for Thought: What Makes Junk Food so Addictive and Dangerous?
Posted on
 March 9, 2012 by Elena Anne in Nutrition 
 Were you ever so inundated with a lengthy task that you forgot to eat? When it was finally over did you realize how hungry you were? Assuming you don’t have a prepared meal waiting for you in the refrigerator or have no energy to cook, what did you have in mind?

 Fast and Convenient 

Junk food is embedded in our psyche so much that it has become second nature to associate hunger with the familiar golden arches of McDonald’s. Junk food is convenient. You can eat it anywhere:  on the way to work or in front of the television. It’s delicious. The best part of it is that you won’t have to deal with any kind of clean up: no messy kitchen, no dirty pots and pans to run through the dishwasher. The media has done a great job of hammering the point of the negative health consequences of consuming these kinds of food. But we still go.

 Lack of Energy and Concentration 

So let’s take the scenario in which you were extremely busy with a task that you forgot to eat and you were suddenly hungry. After the long day of work, you decide you could reward yourself and figure, let’s get one of our favorite meals”. So you go to your favorite fast food establishment: order a double quarter pounder with cheese (reward for the daunting task that you just completed), extra large fries (because you’re starving), and a diet soda. You engulf the meal with the focused voraciousness like a lion would to a hapless gazelle after a long stalk in the Serengeti. Each bite is more delicious than the previous. You can’t stop eating. As you dispose the hamburger wrapper and fries box, you take one last sip of Diet Coke before you throw the large cup down the receptacle. You feel somewhat full, somewhat fulfilled. Until 30 minutes later where you start to regret the experience and you feel bloated.  You vow to never go to a fast food restaurant again. You have a lack of energy. When you get home, you also have a lack of concentration when you are trying to have a conversation with your spouse. About 2 hours later, you’re hungry again.

 Addictive: similar effect to marijuana. 

Junk foods have an addictive quality. A study out of the University of California, Irvine discovered exactly what makes McDonald’s junk food so irresistible to many. The Irvine scientists found that when feeding rats a fatty diet, the cells in their upper intestine began pumping out something called endocannabinoids, which are chemicals that initiate a neural pathway similar to marijuana. The rats were also fed a protein diet and a sugar diet, but there was no release of endocannabinoids. When a junk food item such as a French fry or potato chip is eaten, a whole cascade of events occur which have a similar effect to the drug marijuana. The process begins all the way in the tip of your tongue where the taste of the high fat food sends signals to your brain. The brain then signals the vagus nerve, which then travels down to your intestines. It is once the signal reaches the intestines that the marijuana like effects start to take place. This means that the feelings throughout the body when we consume fast food are similar as to when someone smokes marijuana, which gives you a feeling of ecstasy. These feelings also trigger release of digestive chemicals that also causes us to keep eating more. During this blissful period, you are in such a haze that you can’t stop eating.

 Effects to Body 

What about the body? Researchers in University of  Texas Southwestern Medical Centre in Dallas found that when rats were fed same amount of calories high in three different forms of fat; palmitic acid (saturated fat found in fast foods, beef, butter, milk, and cheese), monosaturated fatty acid, or unsaturated oleic acid (found in olives and grapeseed oil).  The biggest affect was found with the palmitic acid, which had an effect on the ability of leptin (a hormone responsible for feeling of satiety released after eating) and insulin (a hormone released by the pancreas that lowers blood sugar by putting sugar into fat cells). Palmitic acid disrupted the initiation of each hormones signaling pathway. Doing so will cause you to overeat and increase your blood sugar. A consistently high blood sugar will also decrease the effectiveness of any insulin produced. Taking both of these factors into consideration, there would a good probability of suffering from Type II Diabetes.

 Hidden Ingredients 

There are various other chemicals that you would not believe are put into the fast food for various reasons. One such  item, monosodium glutamate (MSG) is  a food additive that is generally hidden as an ingredient, but found in nearly every non-dessert item in KFC as well as in various fast food chains’ salads, despite its link to depression, joint pain, and blurred vision, among other things. Another ubiquitous ingredient is high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is found in everything from children’s vitamins, McDonald’s Baked Hot Apple Pies, and salad dressings. HFCS delivers calories but also fails to satiate, which leaves you feeling hungry for more. Finally, there’s dimethylpolysiloxane. I know it sounds delicious, and it’s probably in some of your favorite fast food items such as McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets, KFC Biscuits, and Wendy’s Natural Cut Fries. It’s put into these food items so that they won’t foam up when they are prepared.  But did you know that dimethylpolysiloxane is also used in things like silly putty and caulk? If your child ever accidently swallowed caulk, they would be immediately rushed to the emergency room. Just some food for thought next time you have a craving for some delicious fast food.   Bon appétit!

Great article! Very interesting stuff you have here! Thanks! It s been a very long time since I had a burger, but what about the organic ones?
There is a new chain in NY that is called BareBurger and all their ingredients are organic…www.bareburger.com
Hope I can eat there again!

Hi Dimi,
It’s crucial how the meal is prepared and what materials are used. In the same way you can prepare your own homemade fast food. An organic burger has nothing to do with the already known burgers, I think.
Thanks for visiting.

Hi Elena this article has hit me right in the head I have a bad habit of eating junk food for quick convenience instead of taking time out to actually cook.

I did gain weight from this&amp;believe it or not I have recently realized that I needed to eat in small portions around the clock, take the time to cook healthy home cooked meals&amp;freeze them

Now I feel a lot better I have also just gotten back into exercising to get my body in shape again.

Love the article&amp;shared it!

You rock!!!

Hello Toshiba,
Sometimes when we are too busy and forget to eat. Or we don’t have the time to do that. Suddenly we are too hungry and what we seek is a“dirty fast meal”. To avoid that, you can eat small portions as you said 5-6 times a day. This can keep you from getting very hungry. One more tip is to drink herb teas which reduce your appetite and detox you as well.
Thanks for visiting Toshiba, hope to see you again soon
