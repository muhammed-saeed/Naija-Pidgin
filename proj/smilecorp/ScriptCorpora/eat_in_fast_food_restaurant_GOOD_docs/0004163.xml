Nantucket has 2 locations in Chapel Hill. One in Ram&apos;s Plaza and the one at Hwy. 54. The difference is that the one in Ram&apos;s Plaza closes earlier and doesn&apos; t offer full-service menus the way the other location does. Also, the Ram&apos;s Plaza location makes the best smoothies ever. No matter what location you go to, you are sure to enjoy the food. Don&apos;t forget to try the lobster bisque!

 ★★☆☆☆ mediocre 
by livten at Citysearch 2 Nantucket Grill 
 September 29, 2010 
This place is a good idea, without the delivery. I&apos;ve tried several flavors of the cakes. They all have tasted dry and perhaps like they had been frozen. The frosting is very sweet and stiff. The cakes always look beautiful, but I&apos;m disappointed every time I taste one. A friend ordered cupcakes for a party though, and they were really delicious -- both the vanilla and chocolate (however with way too much frosting), but I think she may have ordered them from the Sutton Station location. I&apos;ve tasted the chocolate cream pie as well, and it definitely tastes like they put a hefty amount of gelatin in it, which gives it a strange texture.

I&apos;ve eaten lunch and dinner here probably five or six times. The food is always barely adequate, but nothing is really fantastic. Today I tasted the lobster roll, which had no flavor. I also tried the clam roll, which was o.k. The breaded chicken is very heavily breaded and crunchy. I would stick with a salad. I seem to recall having a good one once. Also, this isn&apos;t a huge deal to me, but at lunch you have to order and pay at a counter, grab your own flatware and drinks, and then find yourself a table. You then wait for your food to be brought. If you have kids with you, it&apos;s difficult not to have the service, but otherwise, it&apos;s not a problem. Wish this place were better!


 ★☆☆☆☆ Terrible! 
by Tripchnc at Citysearch 1 Nantucket Grill 
 February 15, 2010 
We have been frequenting this restaurant for a number of years and it has definitely declined in its food quality, customer service and cleanliness. You are welcomed to the restaurant by a bored, listless high school student who never looks you in the eye and barely manages to get you seated, shoving menus in front of you as you sit down. We call the waitstaff the high school mafia because, except for the bartender and owner/manager, they all appear and especially act like high school students who don&apos;t give a darn about their job.

Service is extremely slow and sloppy, no doubt because they must have time to socialize with one another around the order kiosk (observed many times) or head to the bathroom to check their iPhone (also observed). The whole place has a feel as though the owners have just said, &quot;I give up&quot; and are willing to let the restaurant slip into a pool of teenage apathy and terrible food. This &quot;I don&apos;t care a crap about my job&quot; mentality by the waitstaff permeates into the kitchen as the food is subpar in temperature, taste and quality and is certainly not worth the money. It is a dramatic fall from the restaurant it used to be a few years ago. Are the owners spending more effort at their other restaurants? Hope so as this one is going down the drain. We have other friends who won&apos;t darken the door of the restaurant for some of the same reasons. Even though we just moved to a new home just 2 minutes from the restaurant, we won&apos;t go to Nantucket anymore. We prefer paying for much better food at a place the owners care about and whose staff is not populated by High School Musical rejects.

Cons: Everything -- apathetic waitstaff, rude owner/manager


 ★☆☆☆☆ Diversity - I Think Not!! 
by CAM2GINO at Citysearch 1 Nantucket Grill 
 February 08, 2010 
One star is overrated but the system would not let me publish without a rating. So much for honesty.

Had dinner there on Saturday night with 14 other women. The initial reception, delayed service, and unprofessional attitude of the staff and management left a very bad taste in my mouth and I will NEVER frequent this restaurant again. Initially, we were told that our party was not there and we would have to wait 45-60 minutes for a table. Our party was there but they were not Black as we were. I placed my order first but was the last to be served and then had to send the order back. I ordered a second long island ice tea and received a glass of sweet tea (and management refused to fix it). The staff was rude, impolite and unprofessional. I&apos;m sure the tip potential helped to facilitate Jordan&apos;s pleasant attitude but the rest of the staff and management should take some tips from Jordan. This is 2010 and WE DON&apos;T SIT AT THE BACK OF THE BUS OR TAKE CRAP FROM RACISTS AND PAY FOR IT!!!!!!!!!

Pros: Jordan - The Waiter

Cons: Nothing positive besides Jordan


 ★★☆☆☆ It used to be great! 
by ncwallaces at Citysearch 2 Nantucket Grill 
 January 24, 2010 
We&apos;ve been here numerous times, always on Sunday. The first few times the food, service and accomodation were excellent. The last few times we have been unsatisfied. My husband usually tries different menu items , while my son and I stick with certain stand-bys due to food allergies. I always get the chicken salad sandwich, usually the best around, but the last two times it was not great. It just was not as fresh and had a strange after taste. We always order the children&apos;s pasta for our son. We&apos;ve ordered it at least 5 times, always specifying NO CHEESE and sauce on the side. We explain he has a milk allergy. The last time it came with cheese, the time before that with sauce on top. When I said something to the waitress I was met with a rude comment and looks from the manager (Owner?). We&apos;ve had to wait and wait to get drink refills, no one asked how the meals was, and the waitstaff was just plain rude and unattentive. My husband always gets seafood here and the last two times that hasn&apos;t been great either. Tough and flavorless. We brought my M-I-L after raving about how great this place was and the whole experience was terrible that time. Bad food and no service. We have not been back since. It is a shame, when this place is good, it is REALLY good, but it hasn&apos;t been good in a couple of months. Not worth the time and money at this point, I hope they turn it around!

Pros: When it is good, it is really good

Cons: rude staff, food quality is suffering


 ★☆☆☆☆ could improve 
by MLLEA at Citysearch 1 Nantucket Grill 
 September 19, 2009 
Ordered the pecan crusted chicken salad. The chicken came out cold-microwaved tough with a &quot;crust&quot; of matted unrecognizable mash of pecans. The chicken must have been seeped in soy sauce leaving a weird residual flavor. The rest of the salad was limp and rather unappetizing. They really need to streamline their menu so that they can control the quality of the food as they are a good family run business.

Pros: Friendly staff

Cons: Microwaved precooked chicken


 ★★☆☆☆ Has gone down!! 
by BaileyB at Citysearch 2 Nantucket Grill 
 August 20, 2009 
We used to eat here at least once a week. When the servers became rude and it was impossible to get a drink refil, we started to order takeout. When they say &quot;15 minutes&quot; it should not take AN HOUR for 2 salads! This happened not once, but the last 4 times we ordered takeout. The funny thing is that when I called they said that they were &quot;swamped&quot; but when I went to pick it up there were only 3 tables filled. The quality of the meat has also suffered and includes chicken and fish. Hope they can improve things. I agree with the other recent reviewers--quality and service have declined. Expensive for what you get, especially coupled with poor service.

Pros: location

Cons: very poor service and rude staff

 ★☆☆☆☆ Save yourself the trouble 
by beluga22 at Citysearch 1 Nantucket Grill 
 November 21, 2008 
We went for lunch, and it was very disappointing. I had half a roast beef sandwich and a cup of lobster bisque. The sandwich was cold, hastily assembled, and flavorless. The soup was less tasty than a can of Campbell&apos;s. This plus a glass of tea was $10. I will not go back.

Pros: free sample of cake was not bad

Cons: none


 ★★★★★ Best seafood south of MA 
by malavoie at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 June 15, 2008 
Growing up on the North Shore of MA, great seafood was a staple. There has been nowhere in NC to compare until we stumbled upon Nantucket Grill. The fried seafood is amazing! Fried clams rival Woodmans in Ipswich! The restaurant is much like the great &quot;clam shacks&quot; of the Cape. Low key and comfortable is the feeling inside, with clams and fish piled high on the plate. The prices are incredible and couldn&apos;t be found in MA aware for so much great seafood. We are planning to return often.

Pros: great fried seafood, especially the fish and clams

Cons: service is not consistant


 ★★★★★ Enjoyed the experience 
by jeanel at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 July 02, 2007 
Had a wonderful time at Nantucket Grill on Saturday night. Menu had a variety of options and the service was exceptional. We asked to be served promptly since we had a time constraint and were provided the right amount of attention and not felt rushed. Food was delicious and displayed nicely on the plate. I&apos;m sure we will be going back.

Pros: Great Service

Cons: Dinner rolls could be tastier


 ★★★★★ Boston in North Carolina 
by martygil at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 May 04, 2007 
Can&apos;t understand all the bad reviews I just read about this place. It can&apos;t be the same place we had dinner last night. My first eat-in experience here (have gotten Lobster Rolls to go in the past) and was delighted.
We stopped to get their Lobster Rolls but then I saw Fried Clams with bellies on the menu. I had that with the fish and chips and was in heaven. How can anyone eat the dessert? I was so stuffed, I couldn&apos;t move.
My date had the scallops and said it was good (but what does someone from New York know about seafood). The fish (and there was plenty of it) melted in your mouth and the clams reminded me of eating them raw from a stream in Hyannis. I will be back.

Pros: Food, Moderately priced,

Cons: wish was closer to Cary


 ★★★★★ Try it, you&apos;ll like it 
by jkellyrn at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 February 18, 2007 
When a restaurant is always busy, there&apos;s a good reason for that. I have never been to Nantucket at lunchtime when it hasn&apos;t been busy, but the lines move quickly and service is prompt. We recently went for dinner and it was great! There was a different menu than lunch, and we had surf-n-turf, fried seafood, good wine and strawberry shortcake. Great! Go! Try it, you&apos;ll like it!

Pros: Great tasting and great quality food

Cons: Always busy (but worth the wait!)


 ★★★★★ Amazing Food: I&apos;m hooked! 
by raplatt at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 February 17, 2007 
I&apos;ve lived in Chapel Hill / Carrboro for YEARS! I drive Harrington Bank on 54 so frequently that I often forget there is a resturant there, but lately I&apos;ve had a taste for some homestyle cooking, and I stopped in for lunch. The food was amazing. My mom and I shared a couple meals. We had the best salad, Blackened Salmon Salad. I am Hooked! And the chicken salad was awesome, I don&apos;t know if it was the bread, or the chicken salad.



Pros: Desserts, portions, location

Cons: always busy


 ★★★★★ A great find in So. Durham 
by tarheel27713 at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 January 31, 2007 
Went for take-out last week and ate in tonight. This newest Nantucket just opened 3 months ago. Very nice manager named Rachel. Waiter was on the ball and attentive. Recommend the clam chowder, chicken parm and grilled shrimp. Had amazing dessert called Chocolate Bliss (aptly named) with layers of yellow and chocolate cake, chocolate and white frosting with choc bits in between the layers. Nice wine list. Will return, especially for the outdoor patio and live music when weather gets warmer.

Pros: Its away from the mall; nice atmosphere; large menu


 ★★★★★ Beautiful location and outdoor space......

You have got to go to Nantucket Grill Sutton Station! The restaurant is unlike any other in the area. It is worth the short drive from South Point Mall. The bar is comfortable for drinking and/or eating and has a plasma tv. You would never know that space used to be a counter deli (the old Babette&apos;s). We loved the prime rib and stuffed shrimp, my mom had the lobster bisque and fried seafood combo and my dad had surf and turf. We didn&apos;t save room for dessert but we took it home! Strawberry shortcake and tiramisu to die for. We&apos;re happy to have Nantucket Grill Sutton Station in the neighborhood!

Pros: Ambience, great service, wonderful food, huge portions

Cons: Can&apos;t think of one......


 ★★☆☆☆ Never again! 
by meribor at Citysearch 2 Nantucket Grill 
 December 17, 2006 
My boyfriend and I went to the Chapel Hill location today for lunch, and what a disappointment! Although I gave very specific instructions to the waitress about what I wanted on the sandwich, it came back wrong; my boyfriend ordered a 1/2 sandwich and soup - and they charged him extra for the cheese! When we challenged the bill and the manager came out, he gave a lame excuse that while Swiss cheese was included on the full size sandwich, it was extra on a half sandwich? It was bad enough that the order was wrong, it took forever for the waitress to come back to refill our tea, but to be fed a line of garbage about an upcharge was the end for us. (Go ahead. Look at the menu; see if YOU see anything about an upcharge for Swiss cheese on the combination lunch menu. IT ISN&apos;T THERE - HE WAS LYING!!!!)

We used to love coming to Nantucket because the food and the service were really great, but over the last couple of months, they just seem to act as though we&apos;re lucky to be allowed to come in and eat there.

Pros: Location

Cons: Service, food quality


 ★☆☆☆☆ Go somewhere Else! 
by 2muchfoodsolittletime at Citysearch 1 Nantucket Grill 
 November 10, 2006 
I tried this place after a co-worker had their food for a meeting and raved about it! I looked up the menu on the website and was really excited and looked forward to going to the new location in Durham. They open at 11:00 on Fridays . I arrived at 11:10; the Open sign was not on, but I went in anyway. There were plenty of employees milling around, but no one said a word to me. Finally, I asked the guy behind the counter (who had his back turned cutting cake) if they were open. He said they were and that someone would be with me shortly. A woman who is on the phone passes by me several times and finally a waiter (I assume) asks if I have been helped. FINALLY! I found it interesting that people who entered after me were greeted and told what the special of the day was, glad I overheard, because otherwise I would have NEVER KNOWN!! I ordered the Lobster Roll w/fries and got a free slice of Marble cheesecake. The lobster salad had NO TASTE OR SEASONING!!! I was expecting a sandwich, but it was actually lobster salad on a piece of bread, no top. I guess that&apos;s why it is called a Lobster Roll and not a Lobster Sandwich. The fries were...well, fries and the cheesecake was just ok...glad I got it free! The cheesecake filling was good, but the crust tasted like, for lack of a better description, an old dishrag, kinda mildewy like. Earlier in the week I told my husband about the new location and that we should try it out this weekend, but after my experience today, we will definately be going elsewhere! And I will tell anyone who listens to do the same!

Pros: Beautiful interior

Cons: Service and Food


 ★★★★★ The best restaurant I&apos;ve found in the Triangle! 
by nepatriot at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 August 14, 2006 
My Nantucket Cafe&amp;Grill experience started with it&apos;s comfortable and inviting atmosphere. You enter the front door and are greated by a case filled with some of the best desserts I&apos;ve ever tasted. Obviously homemade, as evident by the baker behind the counter. And speaking of counter, there is a brand new wine and beer bar, simple but elegant. After being seated by a cordial hostess on my first visit, I was overwhelmed with the choices on their menu of soups, salads, steaks, lobsters, and their specials. I ordered some of their &quot;award winning&quot; lobster bisque which melts in your mouth. The server went through all of the tempting main dishes and I settled on the steak with lobster tail. After dining on that dish, I realized I had made the best choice! For dessert I was brought an enormous piece of chocolate layer cake. I could only eat a small portion of the gigantic slice and brought the rest home for a late night snack. The overall service was excellent and I have returned to eat there at least twice a week. The lunch is just as good, offering great deli sandwiches as well.

From what I can see, being a New Englander myself, a delicious portion of the Northeast has found a home in The Triangle. The manager told me that there is another location in Ram&apos;s Plaza in Chapel Hill and that they are close to opening a THIRD location off Fayetville road in Durham. Yahoo!

Do yourself a favor and don&apos;t miss this fantastic dining experience. I know they&apos;ve got my business.

Pros: Great location at the 54 exit off of 40. Dedicated staff and enormous portions.


 ★★★★☆ WONDERFUL Muffins and the best coffee around 
by lecach at Citysearch 4 Nantucket Grill 
 June 19, 2006 
I stop here several times a week for coffee and ocassionally muffins. The coffee is better than the coffee at Starbucks. I love it. And the muffins are freshly made every day. I especially like the banana nut and the cranberry. The manager Janet is so nice. And the people that work there always look excited to see my 18 month old son. I think he&apos;s precious but its nice when other people seem to like him too! It&apos;s a great way to start the day.

I have had dinner there a few times and found it pretty good. But didnt love anything. Service was so so at night.

Pros: fresh muffins and coffee

Cons: not so great service at dinner


 ★★★☆☆ good food, bad service 
by gn0713 at Citysearch 3 Nantucket Grill 
 May 28, 2006 
We have been eating at Nantucket in Chapel Hill for years and were excited to have the new location on Farrington Rd. open up. The food is good, but the service is not. I&apos;m disappointed each time I go with unfriendly hostesses and wait staff. Last time, they got our orders wrong and this time we waited over 30 min for lunch and then realized the waitress had put in the wrong order for one of us! We had to wait another 10 min while the other food was getting cold. We had to track down the waitress for refills or service; she was hard to find. I was shocked when we got our bill - so expensive for food that took forever to get right. The food is good - esp. lunch - but the bad service and high prices will make me think twice before returning.

Pros: good lunch food

Cons: expensive, bad service at times


 ★★★☆☆ Not All It&apos;s Cracked Up To Be 
by daveindurham71 at Citysearch 3 Nantucket Grill 
 May 16, 2006 
While I&apos;ve come to really like some of the food at Nantucket...I continue to be disappointed with the level of service there. The staff are simply rude and never, ever seem to feel genuinely welcoming or glad that you&apos;ve patroned their establishment. And since the prices have gone up in recent months...it&apos;s truly not worth it. Their new logo is &quot;pretty&quot; but it&apos;s certainly not enhanced their overall experience of dining there. Again, the food is really quite good - but in the full equation - it simply doesn&apos;t add up to being good value for money. Between the rude service, the pricey experience, and often crazy lines and differing ordering processes - you sometimes think you&apos;re doing little else but lining their pockets so they can make more of those enormous size cakes!

Pros: Pine Nut Salad

Cons: RUDE Service, Pricey, Processes for orderin

I find the decor and atmosphere very nice with good food. However, at times there are long lines, long waits, and rude staff. I used to enjoy going here a few times per month but their desserts have not been as good lately and prices seem to be going up.


 ★★★★★ and they cater too... 
by bettyjay at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 June 27, 2004 
Not only do I enjoy their restaurant but they have catered for me for four years. The quality, array of food, prices, and punctuality make this my favorite caterer. I dont know how I would do business without their feeding my customers!! Jerry runs a tight ship and the delivery guy wont even take a tip! For old fashioned service it just doesnt get any better than this!!! Try their lasagnas, assortment of sandwiches, breakfasts and they even do a marvelous pig pickin!!!


 ★★★★★ a second home 
by elsbethvantongeren at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 June 16, 2004 
It is not easy to find a place where you can go alone and feel so well cared for! I often stop for coffee and a muffin, read or do a cross-word puzzle and feel very happy to be &quot;among friends&quot;. That is how I am made to feel by the staff. The soups are out of this world, friends of mine from KY couldn&apos;t stop talking about them! I have had great omelets, potatoes and deserts that make me return whenever I can and take my out-of-town guests.

Pros: sunny atmosphere, pleasant music, quickly filled orders


 ★★★★★ Great 
by elwestridge at Citysearch 5 Nantucket Grill 
 April 21, 2004 
Things must have obviously changed recently. When I went there for dinner, I had great service. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Following the her suggestions, we ordered the crab cakes, the chicken pine nut salad, and the grilled shrimp. She definitely went the extra mile to please us and make our experience one of a kind. We will certainly go back soon!

Pros: Service, Outdoor dining, Relaxed


 ★☆☆☆☆ Won&apos;t Be Back 
by waw4 at Citysearch 1 Nantucket Grill 
 April 09, 2004 
Food served was not what was ordered, but as our waitress didn&apos;t speak any English and no one else was available, it was impossible to correct. Food quality was poor and prices high - $32 for 3 salads, 3 cokes, and an order of chicken wings. Next time I&apos;ll choose Burger King instead.

Cons: , high prices, no English waitress


 ★★☆☆☆ POOR Service 
by tonja at Citysearch 2 Nantucket Grill 
 February 29, 2004 
I recently visited Nantucket and I must say that I received the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant. We had to wait about 4 minutes for someone to acknowledge that were waiting to be seated. The waiter did not know who ordered our meals so he walked around the restaurant whose order it was. My food was cold and I was missing part of my order so I asked him to take it back&amp;to reheat and to bring the rest of my order. Well.....I never received my food back. No one came over to give an update on the status of my meal. The waiter and &quot;management&quot; gave a lack luster and insincere &quot;I am sorry.&quot; I had to end up going to a fast food restaurant and guess what?.... I got the food I ORDERED with appropriate customer service.

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
Dont eat here!

Pros: price

Cons: , Poor customer service


 ★★★★☆ Excellent Value 
by vaughanwilliams at Citysearch 4 Nantucket Grill 
 February 11, 2004 
This restaurant is one of the best finds in the triangle. While the entrance is set up as a bakery, you are escorted to a table and service is generally prompt and friendly. There is generally no wait.

The kitchen shows great imagination and there are several dishes that are superb and far above the fare that you might expect. Try the roast chicken or the grilled shrimp and you can&apos;t go wrong - both are platonic.

One negative: When we first started eating there, the bakery items were on the same level as the entrees, being locally made. The Nantucket is now importing them from New York and, although the desserts are beautiful and tempting, the actual quality has suffered terribly. I&apos;d have to say now that you are better off going somewhere else for dessert.

To summarize: perhaps the best value for a wonderful meal in the triangle.

Pros: great value, great entrees


 ★★☆☆☆ A Step Up 
by TapscoT39 at Citysearch 2 Nantucket Grill 
 August 27, 2003 
A step up from Wendy&apos;s that is. Stand in line to walk up to a counter to figure out what your options are and place your order. Your order is delivered to table as I recall, complete with paper, plastic, and styrofoam service.

Food is common, service is nil. Don&apos;t forget to dump tray.
