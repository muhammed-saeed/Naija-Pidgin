Elmer Shop

Elmer’s iconic look and playful character have made him a firm international favourite in millions of households. Over 20 book titles have been created since 1989, and sold near 5 million copies in 40 languages around the world.

Elmer has helped countless children to learn about colours, animals, numbers and behaviour. His bright patchwork pattern is familiar in most homes and schools, and is equally appealing to boys and girls, children and adults, selling well from museum and library shops to supermarkets.

Elmer is the main character but his family and friends can provide variety and there is a huge selection of wonderful foliage and jungle backgrounds to use.
