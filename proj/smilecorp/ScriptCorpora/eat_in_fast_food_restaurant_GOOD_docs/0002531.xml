 Out With the Old, In With the New 
 
 
I have created a new blog. I have switched to Wordpress (another blog website). I am still trying to figure everything out as I know nothing about &quot;html code&quot; and how to post videos, etc. I tried designing it myself, but that is clearly not my gifting. I will no longer be posting on this blog. Please check out the new blog:

 Thanks friends! Hope everyone has had a great weekend!

 Loving Reminder 
 
Today is a great day. Why? Because it is the 22 nd.

And currently, the time is 5: 22 . 

And when I was at bible study today, I conveniently turned to the 222 nd hymnal while we were singing.

And when I ordered my food at the fast food restaurant my order number was 222 . 

And when I filled up my gas tank, it stopped at $ 22 .00.

When I checked my e-mails I had 22 e-mails.

I returned my library books and had a fine because of late fees. The fee was of course, $ 2.2 0

Why is it that everywhere I look it is 22 ? I know why. Because I am forgetful. And God wants to lovingly remind me of who He is. God is provider. 

(Genesis 22:14).

 Half a Year Already 
 
I feel like every mom starts off saying, &quot;I can not believe she is ___ already.&quot; But it is so true! Time is flying by, and I honestly can not believe I have a 6 month old daughter already! I have had the best 6 months ever with her in my life. What a blessing she is!

Our day started off at the pediatrician&apos;s office where she had her well-check and received her 6 month old shots. She weighs 15.10, she is 25.5 inches long, and her head circumference is 16.75. She got her Hepatitis B shot, DTap, Hib, IPV, Pneum, Rotatea and her first flu shot. After shots, we had to celebrate her being 6 months old, so we went to Eileens Colossal Cookies ! I LOVE their cookies! Yes, I was that mom, that called this morning and asked if they could put a #6 on one of the cookies for us! ha! Here is sweet Addie with her cookie! I loved celebrating with her and being the one that gets to eat the cookie! :)
 Later on in the afternoon, we drove to Hafer Park where I took some pictures of her! She is such a doll! I feel like every day she is doing something new. She is still smiling all the time and has been laughing more lately than in the past. Hearing her laugh is one of the sweetest noises I have ever heard! She is getting a lot better at sitting up all by herself. There are definitely times when she still faceplants, but that is expected, right? She has been getting up on all fours for a while, and just recently began the rocking motion. I think crawling is coming up soon! She spends a lot of time in her exersaucer and on the floor with her toys. She sleeps in her crib in her room every night and sleeps from 10:00pm-7:00am. She takes a long afternoon nap with a couple smaller naps in the morning and evening. She is a great traveler in the car and has a very flexible schedule. She is always tagging along with Colby and I for different Young Life events, games, bible studies, etc.
 She still nurses 6 times a day as well as eats rice cereal 2 times a day. In the past couple of weeks, I have introduced her to sweet potatoes, avocados, bananas, and apples. None of those experiences were totally great. She was not sure of the taste/texture of them. She had some hilarious facial expressions. I am going to try to be consistent so she can get used to this new food in her life!
 Some of my sweetest moments with her is when she falls asleep on me and we just cuddle together. Another sweet moment is when I open the back door to our SUV and she sees me, she just smiles from ear to ear! It melts my heart! I love going to pick her up from a nap or from sleeping and she is just smiling when she sees me. I love seeing Colby with her and how she reacts around him. It is so precious! Can we say &quot;daddy&apos;s girl?&quot;
 I love seeing her new facial expressions. When I gave her sweet potatoes for the first time, her response was as if she hated it and began coughing it out so she would not have to swallow it. Well, that led her to realize that she can make this new noise with her mouth (a coughing, choking, gagging noise) and she does it all of the time. It is actually hilarious, need to get it on video some time. We have also introduced the sippy cup to her. It is definitely in &quot;introduction stage&quot; as she has not really figured out how to pick it up, hold it, and tilt it so water comes out. But she does love sucking on it and biting the lid.

She is close to moving up from size 2 to size 3 diapers. She mostly wears size 3-6 month clothes but is definitely close to 6-12 months. I don&apos;t think she has worn shoes once since she was born. Or socks for that matter. I might put them on for a quick pic or something, but it is never part of her daily wear.

I can&apos;t say enough how special she is to us. We love her, adore her, value her, cherish her, etc. We have good days, bad days, hard days, easy days, but it is all worth it!

Adelyn, we love you and love being your mommy and daddy! Happy 6 months!

 You Know You are a Blogger When... 
 
...when something happens in your routine, mundane life and you immediately have a Title ready.

...when you see someone at a coffee shop whom you have never met and want to talk to her, because you know all about her, until you realize you only know her because you read her blog.

...when you are writing in your journal, but feel like you are writing for your blog. Or think about how you would re-word it for your blog. (what Becca does :))

...when your have this conversation with your husband:
him: &quot;babe, what are you doing on the computer?&quot;
her: &quot;oh, just reading about my friend, Kelly.&quot;
him: &quot;which friend Kelly? I didn&apos;t know you had a friend name Kelly?&quot;
her: &quot;well, technically, we have never met. And she lives in Arkansas....&quot;
him: &quot;blogs are weird. And so are girls that read them. She is not your friend if you
have never met her.&quot; :)

Can anyone relate to any of these things? Or just me? Ha! What else would you add to this list?

 It&apos;s Not About Circumstances 
 
If I have learned one thing during this season of life, I have learned this:

 &quot;True joy and lasting contentment does not come from my circumstances, it comes from the only true source, God.&quot; 

I have learned this by dwelling and clinging to an awesome verse in Habakkuk:

&quot; 17 Though the fig tree does not bud
and there are no grapes on the vines,
though the olive crop fails
and the fields produce no food,
though there are no sheep in the pen
and no cattle in the stalls,

 18 yet I will rejoice in the LORD,
I will be joyful in God my Savior.&quot;

I love what I learned from a commentary:

Even in the midst of absolute ruin and abject famine, the prophet was prepared to trust God . He realized that inner peace did not depend on outward prosperity . Habakkuk did not state that he would merely endure in the hour of distress. He said he would rejoice in the Lord and be joyful . God is the inexhaustible source and infinite supply of joy.


Far too many people keep trying to find joy, but happiness is not found in circumstances . Joy is available to everyone, even to those stripped of every material possession, for joy is to be found in a Person.


We were pretty close to being stripped of every material possession. Our house got broken into and they took our t.v., laptop, camera, ipod, etc. Then Colby got in a wreck and his car was totalled, and we lost that. We have been praying about putting our house on the market, so that might be gone soon. I have to realize that my happiness is NOT in these things. They are NOTHING. Take it all away. Will I wake up and be content in a different house, and without some of the items everyone else has? Yes. Why? Because my contentment lies in the Lord. Period. Nothing else.

I am choosing today (and trying to choose every day) to be joyful no matter what. He is my true source of joy, my lasting joy, and my permanent contentment.

 She Has Stolen My Heart 
 
A very un-edited compilation of some very short clips I have taken of Addie through the past 5 months:
 

I sure do love this girl!

 Re-Learning 
 
Does anyone love Beth Moore as much as I do? I sure would love to meet her one day. Maybe in December when she comes to Oklahoma. Maybe I can invite her over for dinner. Okay, that was totally stretching it! ha!

Well, I have done a lot of her bible studies and have read a lot of her books. Which isn&apos;t saying much since I have a hard time living out everything I am learning. Why is that? Why do I complete these bible studies that &quot;change my life&quot; and then I live in unbelief or doubt? I really need a transformation in this area.

Today I have decided to go back over some of the bible studies that I have completed and &quot;re-learn&quot; what I learned in years past. I really pray I can let these words sink deep and live in such a way that I truly believe what the Word says. I need a community of people that want to join together and truly believe and live like Christ would. There are too many mediocre Christians wondering around (including myself at times). Things must change!

In 2007 I completed her bible study, Believing God: Experiencing a Fresh Explosion of Faith . 

She focuses on a 5 Statement Pledge of Faith:

 1. God is who He says He is. 
 2. God can do what He says He can do. 
 3. I am who God says I am. 
 4. I can do all things through Christ. 
 5. God&apos;s Word is alive and active in me. 

 God is who He says He is . Who is God? God is our provider, father, creator, life-changer, healer, etc.

 God can do what He says He can do . God says in Genesis 22:14 that He will provide. God says that He will never leave us or forsake us. God says He can move the mountains. God says he will carry our burdens and make our heavy load, lighter.

 I am who God says I am. Take all the insecurity away because God has created us in his image. We are valued, loved, treasured, beautiful. He is enthralled with our beauty.

 I can do all things through Christ . I can serve my husband when I am tired. I can take care of my daughter when I would rather be with a friend. I can serve people at work even when I don&apos;t like my job. He gives us the strength to do things we can not do by ourselves.

 God&apos;s word is alive and active in me . His word changes us. And it changes others. I need to spend more time memorizing His life changing words.

May we be changed by this life-changing truth!
