 14th-Jul-2009 06:18 pm - Never get over you 
 She said it&apos;s quiet
and the shadow of the sun
she looks tired
a life that&apos;s come undone
she turns, turns, turns, turns
she likes hockey
and summers by the lake
we&apos;re not talking
victims of my mistakes
i burn, burn, burn. burn

if you walk out that door
i just dont know what ill do
ill never get over you
if my hearts explodes
i just dont know what ill do
ill never get over you

in this silence but its never been so loud
i try to fight it but the words just dont come out
i burn, burn, burn, burn

if you walk out that door
i just dont know what ill do
ill never get over you
if my hearts explodes
i just dont know what ill do
ill never get over you

there&apos;s no hiding from your silence
there&apos;s no hiding

if you walk out that door
i just dont know what ill do
ill never get over you
if my hearts explodes
i just dont know what ill do
ill never get over you

dont you go
don&apos;t you go
don&apos;t you go
don&apos;t you go.

 18th-Jun-2009 01:29 am - Could we just try 
 Now I&apos;m sorry if i&apos;m wasting your time
this won&apos;t take long at all
I&apos;m not sure if you really understand
I&apos;ll try and spell it out for you.

This isn&apos;t something that goes away
it follows me where ever I go.
I&apos;ve crossed that line so many times
and I still can&apos;t let it go.

.....
How can you ignore this
it&apos;s a pain that just doesn&apos;t fade.
It&apos;s a blade to the back of my neck
and I can run away
I&apos;m not used to all the attention
I can feel all those eyes
.....

Now I&apos;m not sure if i&apos;m mistaken
but I&apos;m sure you told me your name
I&apos;m not usually this forgetful
but I tried to block you out again

I know we&apos;ve known each other
for way too long now
I see the way you look at me
It&apos;s different than before.

......

Something doesn&apos;t feel right
I feel it in my heart
You treat me different
than you did before.
I know you, know I&apos;ve crossed that line
I tried to hide behind the lies
Now I dont want to waste your time
but could we try, just try.

.....

Could we try, just try. 
 Music: Aloha in hell
