 Geothermal Energy: Energy of the Future 
 
 
Within the next decade or two, energy is going to be a big problem unless we stop supporting corrupted industries, such as the oil industry. Oil corporations claim that there is still an abundance of oil within the Earth but their claim is misleading. This is designed to prevent them from losing money and investors.

Most of us don’t realize how close we are to a worldwide oil shortage. The end of oil isn’t because we are running out of oil. It is because the oil that is easily accessible is running out. Also, corporate greed will result in the monopolization of oil. One of the major reasons why oil is coming to an end is because the use of oil is destroying our planet. There are a few renewable energy solutions out there that can help us reduce the severity of this problem. One of them is called geothermal energy.

Geothermal energy has been around for billions of years. It is as old as the Earth. Geothermal is the energy (heat) that the Earth produces. This heat is caused by magma within the Earth that can reach a temperature of more than 2,000°F. This tremendous amount of energy, if efficiently harnessed, can power the entire world for billions of years.

Currently, geothermal energy is harnessed by pumping water through pipes to the heat source. Once the water boils, the steam rises and turns a turbine to produce energy. This works similar to water heating systems in homes. In certain areas of the planet, there exist geothermal steam. Energy companies can utilize geothermal steam by building turbine right on top of the steam instead of using pipes.

The advantages of using geothermal energy is that it requires little fuel and produces little or no emissions. The disadvantage is that if extracted too much, its energy source can slowly be depleted. However, give it time and it will replenish itself.

With our current technology, geothermal energy won’t be able to replace oil. Also, the cost of building technological systems to harness geothermal energy may cost too much. With the current economy and population, it will be very hard to overcome these challenges. If we can overcome these challenges, every country in the world will have an unlimited source of energy for billions of years.
