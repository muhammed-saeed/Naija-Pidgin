 Adonit Writer Plus Review 
 
Last year I got the opportunity to review the original Adonit Writer for my first generation iPad. I found it to be a huge productivity boost and it was a holy grail moment for me. Of course, that was 2 iPads ago! Moving to the new generation iPad has given me the opportunity to play…

 Sea to Summit Waterproof TPU Review 
 
Exactly how tech-addicted are you? I am at the beach this week for a (reasonably) well-earned vacation. My idea of a vacation is going somewhere that my cell phone doesn’t work. Unfortunately, in a society that runs at our pace, that isn’t always a possibility. Actually, this is what I think of when you say…

 Altego Coated Canvas Backpack Review 
 
For the last two weeks I have been carrying around my daily allowance of stuff that I think I need in an Altego Coated Canvas backpack. The Altego falls into a category I mentally classify as a medium technical backpack. It will carry up to a 17 inch laptop and will hold a lot of…

 Cell Drive Cellink Review 
 
Cell Drive makes a range of multifunction products that combine storage and charging technologies. This is a good thing because I eat batteries for lunch and I am a BIG fan of things that do more than one thing. Purpose driven gadgets may be efficient but they are BORING!!! They sent me samples of their…

 Logitech Ultrathin iPad Keyboard Review 
 
(Guest review by Ted Bahas) I upgraded to the latest, greatest iPad last month. I have been accused of being an Apple fanboy but in my defense, I really wanted needed the better screen resolution and more powerful processor in the new iPad. I use the iPad exclusively when I travel and I am using…

 Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Duffle Bag Review 
 
I am not really a“just in case”or“what if”kind of packer. While not a religious about it, I do try to streamline, minimize and I have even been known to weigh things to see where I stand. After all, an ounce is an ounce and they all add up to pounds! For…

 Cpeel iPad Keyboard Case Review 
 
Do you have an iPad but are suffering from MacBook Air envy? Cpeel is aiming this straight at you! I saw this MacBook looking case as an article on one of the Mac news website and was immediately intrigued. A keyboard and an extended battery all in a package that looked truly cool. How sexy…

 Valentine Goods MacBook Cover Review 
 
Leather makes a statement. It may be about the iconic eternal youth of James Dean or the neuroses of Ross in the bathroom with the baby powder but it always says something. What would it say about your gadgets? Would your iPhone be Kenicki from Grease or David Coverdale from Whitesnake? Is your iPad Randy…

 Portenzo iPad Case Review 
 
Books, pen and paper, typesetting and ink. They are all on a long, slow death spiral. Traditional publishing is on a collision course with the e-universe that seems fated to end in a fatal spray of fonts and kerning. Ergo, book binding with its requisite physical trappings of paper and cloth is on a similar…

 HumanGear GoCup Review 
 
If you have read my site for any length of time you might be surprised to find out that I, urban gypsy though I am, was raised by a pack of wolves in the depths of the Black Forest. Well, in a household of hearty outdoorsmen anyway. With guns and camping equipment and camouflage clothes.…

 Ogio Consul Review 
 
I have long been aware of Ogio as a bag and pack maker but given that all the ones I had seen had someone else’s corporate logo on them I always assumed that they were an OEM manufacturer. Imagine my chagrin at meeting them at CES and seeing the wide range of product they make…

 Rickshaw iPad Messenger Bag Review 
 
A trip to Europe for 8 days presented me with a bit of a conundrum. I needed a day bag that would cover me for three days of trade show and five days of touristing with the primary goal of carrying my new iPad plus the other stuff that I needed to schlep around. Luckily,…

 Case Logic IKBT-50 Bluetooth Keyboard Review 
 
I know you are tired of hearing about my maudlin fascination with keyboard devices. While have repeatedly blamed this addiction on my poor handwriting, I am currently seeing a therapist in regards to this. I know that makes you feel better! He assures me that this haptic need of mine is actually founded in some…

 iKeyboard Review 
 
As I have mentioned before I have keyboard issues. Well, I have lots of issues, ( just ask my long-suffering wife) but the particular issues that I am referring to today are rooted in my truly abysmal handwriting. I actually LIKED Grafitti on the original Palm units because it would convert my hideous scrawl into…

 Ful Brooklyn Backpack Review 
 
I must confess that I stalk bag companies. I lurk on their web pages and zoom in on zippers to try determine the brand. I calculate carrying capacity and gauge the tensile strength of the material. I buy bags and fill them with piles of stuff no normal human being would cram in there. I…

 Rickshaw Bags Smartphone Folio Review 
 
( Please forgive the awful pictures, they were taken on a trans-Atlantic flight, but I wanted to get this up while the deal was on) The Smartphone Folio is a perfect little product from the crew at Rickshaw. It is made from the same high quality materials that their bags and packs are and it…

 Rickshaw iPad Sleeve Review 
 
A brand, spanking new iPad arrived at my door on Friday afternoon! Yours probably did too, and even if it didn’t there are already 114,352 reviews of the iPad online that either say:“It is the best piece of technology I have ever owned. I wept when I opened the box. It even cured my…

 In-N-Out Burger Restaurant Report 
 
Yes, it is a bit strange that I am reviewing a fast food restaurant, but this particular one is a decadent pleasure for me. In-n-Out Burger is a Western US chain with just over 250 locations spanning California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. Oh yeah, and Texas…as long as you consider Dallas/Fort Worth part of Texas.…

 MyCharge Power Review 
 
While the length of my life will measured in days and years, I have come to the conclusion that my productivity is measured in milliamp hours. As I do more and more work outside of the office my mobile devices are not my backup. They are my primary means of getting work done. I answer…

 Zuca Sport Pro Review 
 
There is no such thing as a perfect travel bag, because travel has a tendency to throw a curve ball at you. Sometimes those curve balls are 9th inning of the 7th game of the World series kind of curve balls and you just don’t know how you are going to deal with it. A…

 Humangear Gotubbs Review 
 
Last year I got the opportunity to play with the Humangear Gotoobs and I found them to be clever, useful and also pretty darn cute. When I talked the them again and got the chance to review the Gotubbs, I was excited. Yes, they are just containers and I know that it is pitiful to…

 Tom Bihn Travel Tray Review 
 
Do you know that sick feeling? The one where you reach in your pocket for something you really need and you can picture it on the top of the dresser in the hotel. The hotel that is now 300 miles in your rear-view mirror. Anyone who travels regularly knows that feeling. Unfortunately, your options are…

 Assasin’s Creed: Revelations 
 
I received the newest installation in the Assasin’s Creed game franchise for Christmas and it has already stolen a big chunk of my life. The graphics are the typical broodingly beautiful style of the series. Most of the action takes place in the city of Constantinople (not Istabul..sorry, couldn’t resist!). The story primarily surrounds a…

 PowerSkin for iPhone 4S Review 
 
Christmas came early to Sprint this year. The iPhone 4S landed on their dock making T-Mobile the only national carrier left out in the cold, rarefied air of commercial winter. I like this because Sprint is the carrier that I am committed to and it finally gave me the opportunity to see what all the…

 Tom Bihn Cadet Review 
 
My daily carry briefcase over the last year has been the Tom Bihn Zephyr. It’s professional looks, ruggedness and total capacity (over 1000 cubic inches) have served me incredibly well and you can get the whole story on it, if you would like, here where I originally reviewed it. My biggest problem with the Zephyr…

 Rickshaw Bags Backpack 2.0 Review 
 
As a friend of mine is fond of saying“People fall into two categories. Those that divide things into categories and those that don’t.”While that is only marginally germane to my topic today it does let me talk about the category that I fall into: the“I might need that”category. I can trim…

 TwelveSouth PlugBug Review 
 
TwelveSouth has taken the Apple mantra“Think Different”about as seriously as anybody in the accessory field. According to TwelveSouth:“Our small company (less than 12 employees) plans to introduce 12 unique, must-have Mac accessories each year that will be as innovative as Apple itself. Bold, new accessories that are designed to protect, personalize, improve…

 WaterField iPhone Wallet Review 
 
So, two weeks ago I retired my no-name, trifold leather wallet and made the leap to using WaterField Designs iPhone Wallet. My initial response was panic as I looked at my aged, inch thick monstrosity and wondered how I was ever going to fit all that crap in the svelte piece of leather and ballistic…

 Travel Underwear Review 
 
OK, I have to confess, this is an odd choice of things for me to review, but I am an odd guy and that is always a valid excuse! Over the last year I have gotten increasingly interested in light travel and the concept of“One-bagging”which is ironic given my fixation on bags and…

 WaterField Ultimate Tablet Sleeve Case Review 
 
As a note, all still pictures in this review are taken with the onboard camera on the iPhone4S just to see how it performed. 2 years ago having a case for your tablet meant you were carrying medications along with you. A year ago a tablet case meant an iPad case, or possibly a Kindle.…

 Adonit Writer Review 
 
Hour after hour of rehearsal as a concert pianist makes you very sensitive to the tiny changes in pressure between computer keyboards. The repetitive practice of playing a D flat harmonic minor scale for hours at a time rather quickly trains the muscles in your fingers and hands to the microchanges that come from very…

 Timbuk2 Control Laptop Case Review 
 
Timbuk2 has been at the backpack/bag game for a long time and they make a bunch of bags so you would expect that they have pretty good handle on what should and shouldn’t go into a laptop bag. For curiosity’s sake, I let their website guide me through the process of picking a bag. After…

 Gotoobs Review 
 
What is it about companies that are based in San Francisco and the surrounding areas? They have a certain level of innovation and product evolution that seem to be a step above those around them. Humangear is one of those companies. Just a couple of little ideas, a couple of little twists on simple products…

So, when is a MacBook Air case not a MacBook Air case? When it is configured for a 13 inch MacBook Pro! WaterField was kind enough to send me one of their Travel Express cases for review. Versions are available for both the 11 and 13 inch MacBook Air and while they were at it…

 Leatherman Style PS Review 
 
Leatherman Inc. Retail Store 10109 NE Cascades Pkwy. Portland, OR 97220 (At Cascade Station) Phone: (503) 408-5550 Email: info@leatherman.com I donated my first multi-tool to an airport security agent nearly 20 years ago. Strangely, it was before the rules were so stringent and I actually“donated”it on the return part of the trip. Since…

 Tom Bihn Takes Care of our Soldiers 
 
Nice to see a manufacturer take care of our country’s servicemen! They will pick up the shipping on any package to an APO address! Love to seem them doing that! Even cooler though, if you were in the military and bought a Brain Bag backpack and would prefer if it were Universal camouflage they will…

 Amazon Phone 
 
Now isn’t this an interesting bit of rumor fodder. According to 9to5Mac.com (via Bloomberg) Amazon in plotting their own phone product. Have to say that given Amazon’s desire to conquer everything with a transaction this makes a lot of sense. They are one of the companies that can actually rival Apple in the contact front…

 G Foley’s- A Restaurant Report 
 
Ahhh, vacation! I have spent the last couple of days working to ramp my speed down to the pace of the beach. You know, wake up without an alarm, get out of bed when you want to. Stumble down to the beach, eat when you are hungry and pay little or no attention to the…

 iPad Mini Woo Hoo 
 
The web is awash with reports of the confirmation of the upcoming iPad Mini. While I am not a full bore Apple fanboy, I find myself a bit surprised by my reaction. In a word. Meh. I mean really, what does Apple gain by this? Certainly, Kindle sold a lot of units rolling into the…

 Firefly Grille- A Restaurant Report 
 
With a tag line like“Green Hills’Friendliest and Funkiest Little Neighborhood Joint”I suppose that I should have had my expectations well tempered for what was to come. A“joint”in this sense almost always means that the food outpaces the ambience. I was not quite prepared for the inside of Firefly to look…

 Summer Rickshaw Lovin’ 
 
For some of us, nothing says love like curling up with a good book by the pool, at the beach or even in the backyard hammock. If you are anything like me though, it is a fifty-fifty decision whether I read on paper or something electronic. I actually like the flexibility of having a whole…
