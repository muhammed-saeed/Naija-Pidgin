I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m giving Arby&apos;s 5 stars, but seriously this place deserves it!

Today I met my beau and a couple of his coworkers downtown for lunch. Arby&apos;s was chosen because we all had various coupons (mine was for free curly fries courtesy of the St. Paul Saints game last weekend). We arrived right about 12pm, and the midday rush was on in full force, but with 3 people taking orders and a production line like I&apos;ve never seen at a fast food joint, things were movin like clockwork! I placed my order and had no issue using my coupon. And before I even received my change, my name was being called on the other end saying my order was ready! Holy Toledo that was fast! Now to be fair, I only ordered a roast beef sandwich, curly fries and a drink, but still that was impressive.

What was even more impressive was the service we received after we were finished eating. Each one of us had a tray in front of us, and this wonderfully friendly lady who worked there was walkin around asking how everyone was doing. She then strolled by a minute later asking if she could clear our trays for us. Is this really just another fast food restaurant? No it&apos;s not...this place really cares about giving you the best service and they want to keep you coming back for more. Did we ring the bell for great service on our way out...you bet we did! And I have a feeling we&apos;ll be back again soon to do it again!

I&apos;m more of a fan of the dining atmosphere than the food. This is an incredibly large space that feels more fancy than your typical fast food joint. It&apos;s very centrally located too, you definetely feel like your&apos;re in the big city here as it is right in the middle of Downtown across the street from one of our 3 tallest Skyscrapers.

The food isn&apos;t bad and the service is usually good but I just don&apos;t think it makes sense to go to such a typical fast food chain with all the places exclusive to Downtown that are available in the immediate area, at least for lunch. However, after 4:PM your options for quick eats become very limited wheras this Arby&apos;s is open til 8. So if you&apos;re Downtown after 4:PM and before 8:PM I&apos;d definetely come here if you&apos;re looking for a good, quick meal.

Alright so first off, Arbys is fast food... a product I don&apos;t normally associate myself with, but for some reason I have found that I am COMPLETELY addicted to the Jalapeno Poppers they have on the menu!
Well today for lunch, even though I brought a sandwich from home, something in me was craving them like none other! So I walked on down to Arbys through the skyway.

Well typically I have found that this place is SUPER busy and packed from about 11-2 and today was absolutely no exception! But what makes this place so different vs. all of the other fast food places in the skyway, is the people that work here!
Today the expo woman, whom might also be a manager, her name is Yvonne. Well I ordered my Jalapeno bites and I knew it would take some time to cook them. Well she came back and said that she was very apologetic for the wait (that mind you, I already half expected) and offered me a free drink of my choice! She even offered me a malt!

I waited patiently and as she came up with the order (the wait was seriously negligable) she apologized again.
That my friends, is the kind of customer service that I wish was still offered everywhere! Her sunny disposition, her kind words, and the fact that she actually cared whether or not my needs were being met made my day today!
Thank you Yvonne! I hope to see you again real soon!

Gigantic landmark Arby&apos;s rises above the typical with sheer grandeur and above-average service.

I love this Arby&apos;s, they know customer service. The genuinely friendly employees always put a smile on my face and make my day better. The cashiers all know me by name and half of them have memorized my order as well.  The food is your typical Arby&apos;s fare, but this crew somehow manages to pump it out faster, and more accurately than at any other Arby&apos;s I&apos;ve eaten at.
