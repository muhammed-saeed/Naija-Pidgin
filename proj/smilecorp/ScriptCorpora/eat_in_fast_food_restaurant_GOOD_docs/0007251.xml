Chicken sandwich wars

By AJC | Tuesday, May 23, 2006, 05:02 PM

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

Mickey D is stepping onto Chick-fil-A’s turf. This week, McDonald’s has started a four-state test of a chicken sandwich that looks almost—well, almost exactly—like the famous sandwich that Chick-fil-A“invented.”

What’s this mean to you? Will you beat a path to the Golden Arches to try out the new version? Are you a faithful Chick-fil-A lover, with no desire to sample a pale imitation? Anybody out there planning to dine on the McDonald’s version only on Sunday?

Here’s an issue you can chew on. After you’ve digested the news, let us know what you think about the battle, and who will win.

Is this really a choice? This is Atlanta - home of Chick-Fil-A. I, personally, don’t eat Chick-Fil-A sandwiches, but if I did, I certainly would not go to McDonald’s for a similar sandwich. I do like Chick-Fil-A food, I am just not a chicken sandwich girl. I do love their salads, though. McDonald’s is really having to come up with new ideas as people try to eat more healthy.

Between the two, there is no contest. Chik-fil-A is the best. Even if a“blind test”were to rate McDonald’s higher, Chik-fil-A is better because it is Chik-fil-A. Better taste, better service, better restaurants, better sides, better everything else.

On the other hand, I prefer the Waffle House grilled chicken sandwich over both.

Let’s see the freshly breaded original cooked in pressurized peanut oil (very low in sturated fat and no trans fat) or some frozen, par fried brick refried in the trans fat laden shortening they use at McDonald’s? There really is no contest here even putting state and civic pride aside.

OH man please. McDonald’s thinking they can take on the Chik in any way, shape, fashion or flavor is a joke. I’ll try it out of curiosity, but that’s about it. There’s only ONE chicken sandwich fast food joint, and it ain’t McD’s, BK, Wendy’s, or even KFC. Besides, I respect a company that closes on Sunday to allow employees time off as well as setting aside scholarship money for said employees, many if not most of whom are young and looking to do something more. McD’s doesn’t offer that.

Well, you know what they say…Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery….

It’s not the first time McDonalds has tried…..

Let’s see…. Fruit (not fresh though), Designer coffee….

What’s next…. A Happy Meal toy that’s not a piece of plastic, Closing on Sundays…

Keep it up guys…. Chick-fil-A will continue to find ways to out-do you every day of the week.

OK, McDonald’s does use a pressure-cooker. I stand corrected. I’ll still forego fast food chicken sandwiches on Sunday. As long as McDonald’s uses their hydrogenated shortening (Chick-Fil-A also fries their waffle fries, which I avoid,in this poison) this guy’s shadow won’t darken their dorway

Gee McDonalds comes out with a chicken sandwich. Whoopee.

Let’s see them get hundreds of people sitting in line all night just to get free food for a year.

Now those are dedicated fans….

Will McDonalds EVER get it?

Bravo Chick-fil-A.

I seriously doubt anyone could get to the level of freshness and quality that Chick-fil-a represents. Besides, they would have to be a lot more creative than the‘cow slogans’that Chick-fil-a markets with. I don’t see that happening. I really like the niche that Chick-fil-a has chosen instead of trying to be a one-stop shop for all kinds of food.

LOVE Chik-Fil-A original chick sandwich, but never make a special trip there or any other fast food joint for that matter. More a matter of what’s at the next exit when you’re on a road trip.

Even though, Chik-Fil-A sandwich is great, I would be willing to try Mick-y D’s - because their fries are the best fast food fries!

Now, with good ice cream and the pressure cooked checken sandwich, I officially can quit going to that other horrible, horrible restaurant. I despise Chic-Fil-A and everything they are. Closed on Sundays? Ridiculous. Horrible. Terrible. Anti-capitalist. Anti-consumer. Want to be closed on Sudnays? Fine, then dont get my business the other 6 days. And, while you are at it, please change your marketing.. its been 14 years, dummies.

Let’s see everytime Chic-Fil-A enters a new market, people beat down the doors, camp out for days, you name it for that delicious chicken sandwich. Do you see that with McDonald’s? May be 30 years ago, but not any more.

McDonald’s has become the aging grey-haired old lady, who somehow thinks menu imitation, hip-hop, and whatever else to soften their mature industry image will boost their sales.

Only McD’s can do burgers and Filet-o-Fish (and used to do fried pies not that baked crap they now serve). But, they can’t do chicken or breakfast. Fries, well it’s a tie between them, Chic-Fil-A, and Arby’s (all best served piping hot).

JR you just don’t get it. You need to go back a study economics. Chic-fil-A is the perfect example of capitalism at work. The consumer has rewarded them above and beyond the burger chains BECAUSE they close on Sundays. Doesn’t sound anti-consumer or capitalist to me.

Guess you haven’t ever heard, or really care about why they are closed on Sunday. Besides, what is you stand on Wal-Mart, because if you are against Wal-Mart for being anti-consumer and capitalist, then that would smack of blatant hypocrisy.

Wow, I had no idea this sandwich was new. When I saw the story on the homepage, I said“What are they talking about, that sandwich has been out for years!”Then I found out that I was in the test market and did not even know it. I live in Columbus and this sandwich has been around for a while. I ordered it a couple of times. It’s good, but not as good as Chick-fil-A’s sandwich. If I go to McDonald’s, I am there to grab a burger in a hurry. I’m not looking for a chicken sandwich. I go to Chick-fil-A if I’m looking for a chicken sandwich.

Ha this is laughable. Mickey D thinks they can make a chicken sandwich as good as chickfila, what’s next is Hardees going to make pizza?

However I’ll eat a Mickey D’s chickfila wanna be because chickfila is apparently too good to open up franchises in Michigan.

as an ATL native OW LAWD do I miss Chickfila and Waffle House. I have actually driven 90 miles to South Bend just have lunch at Chickfila.

Still p** about the peach bowl thing though..

I don’t like ANY of McD’s food (their hamburgers taste like the paper they are wrapped in), and there is NO way any chicken sandwich of theirs can even come CLOSE to Chick-fil-A. Even tho Chick-fil-A may be a bit costlier, it’s well worth it.

I don’t do McDonald’s. If I want a great burger, I go to Wendy’s or BK. If I want a chicken sandwich, I go to Chick-fil-A. So they aren’t open on Sunday…so what? Most civilized people have Sunday dinner at home anyway. Don’t you think Chick-fil-A’s employees like having one day a week off?

I don’t even like McDonald’s fries. Every time I have gotten them, they are way under cooked, and taste horrible. I used to like their chocolate shakes, but even they don’t taste like good chocolate, like they did years ago.

McDonald’s…you’re gonna have to do a LOT better to get ME to your door.

I’ve tried to eat a Chick-fil-A a few times and have found them to be nearly inedible - dry stale bun, dab of margarine (I guess) and a bad tasting piece of chicken and two limp pieces of pickle. The Chick-Fil-A in Marietta where I have tried it sure doesn’t taste anything like what the rest of you are describing. McDonalds isn’t light years better but at least the bun was fresh.

Just tried it, Chick Fil A has NOTHING to worry about unless the person complimenting this was without taste buds. It was juicy, but the meat was 3/4th the size of ChickFilA and the taste was not there, ChickFilA is far and away the winner - the only good point was the fries were hot - HEY CHICKFILA, IMPROVE THOSE FRIES and you can kill McD completely - I would be the first one on options day buying stock!!!

McDonald’s chicken sandwich couldn’t hold a candle to the quality of a Chik-fil-a sandwich. I praise Chick-fil-a for closing on Sunday. I’ve gone this long without eating a fried chicken sandwich on Sunday, McDonald’s won’t change my mind now.

Even if McDonald’s new sandwich tastes exactly like Chick-Fil-A’s, you still won’t get the same customer service. When was the last time a McDonald’s employee said to you,“My pleasure”. You can’t beat Chick-Fil-A’s customer service. No matter where you go!

Chick Fil A is a quality, classy company that has a touch on their employees and customers.

McDonalds is nothing like that. Its like comparing Golden Coral to LongHorn. Chick Fil A has reasonable pricing but service levels that easily warrant a 20% price premium more than the currently charge.

This sandwich as McDonalds wont last just like McRib.

McD’s and yet another roll out of a“GREAT”tasting chicken sandwich, what a surprise. Only problem is I’ve fallen for it before, tastes like dry cardboard, no matter how much artificial flavorings they load up on. Give it up McD’s, if you want me to return try getting the original burger taste, try any burger taste for that matter, back in the overprocessed dog food you serve now, or maybe try to get your restaurants to not be an armpit with angry, apathetic less-than-workers, would it hurt to actually speak to a customer anymore????

Chik-Fil-A rocks, though some are a little below their standards, most are really worth my money! When I say thanks for getting my order right or anything, they respond“My Pleasure”, clean restaurants, clean bathrooms, good quality food at reasonable prices. Man I love Chik-Fil-A. Keep up the good work!

America, stop going to some place just because it’s familiar, demand better food, better service!!!!

Can’t get enough of that all natural Chick-fil-a sandwich! Everybody knows those are the best. Asked a manager the other day what those fries are cooked in. Turns out it’s not shortening it’s peanut oil just like the sandwiches. Forget the sandwiches yall I just had one of their new shakes. Look out DQ, McDs, and anyone else who serves a shake. Those things rock. Might have to start excercising now…

Hey vdub,

About your comments on no Chick-fil-A in Michigan…you have to understand that Chick-fil-A is not technically a franchise in certain states because its operators share profits with the company. BUT…the company is currently working on models that would work in metro areas like New York and Chicago…

Be patient…Chick-fil-A will find a way…

went to chick-fil-a a couple of days ago and was so disappointed, little, cold thin, piece of chicken, never would have received something looking like that from chick-fil-a just a year or two ago, they are going the way of mcdonald’s. but they don’t need to worry before long mcdonald’s chicken sandwich will start looking like their filet-o-fish, in the last 10 years, that sandwich has decreased in size by at least 35%, and the worse part, the meat has gone from white to gray. but it’s today’s corporate motto, keep trimming down the size of everything, don’t change the price and pocket more profits.

Chick-Fil-A is by far the best fast-food restaurant experience in the country, bar-none. While I would consider In-N-Out Burger in California to serve the best tasting fast-food, obviously it’s a little difficult to get my hands on a Double-Double Animal-style out here in ATL. But again, with the combination of excellent-tasting food, clean establishments, and absolutely the best customer service in the industry, I’m always happy to pay a premium at Chick-Fil-A. They are certainly worth it to me. Everything I’ve heard indicates they are an excellent employer, as well.. great benefits, scholarships, and best of all, life lessons learned. I’d be very proud to have my children get a first job at that chain - I only wish I had chosen that path myself earlier in life.

McDonalds has alright food, but poor customer service. I’ll give their sandwich a shot.. but I would be very hard-pressed to make a switch over.

Mickey D’s you are living in a dream world if you ever think you can take on Chick-fil-A. Its not just the sandwich its the service too. Chick-fil-A restaurants are always clean, the staff is professional, and the food is HOT. On the other hand on the occassions I have visited any Mickey Ds I have to ask for napkins, return food because its not hot, be waited on by rude and/or distant staffers, etc., etc., etc.

If you want to be a copycat for Chicken-Fil-A start with copying their quality service. Get some servers that speak clear English and don’t act like you’re disturbing them by ordering a meal for yourself. I don’t care how good you say your sandwich is—give me Chick-Fil-A.

Mickey D’s by my office has tested this sandwich for a over a year now and it’s so popular that’s it’s stayin’on the menu. I never thought I’d say it but this sandwich beats Chick-Fil-A’s by far. It’s moist, fresh, and always has taste! Half the time Chick-Fil-A’s chicken is hard, crusty, and not very moist (no matter which restaurant you go to).

Sam, 
Yes Chick-fil-A is owned by a Christian family and promote Christian values. I and millions of other people of glad they do. They are extremely careful when hiring their managers. I am glad of that because I feel that my daughter has a better chance of working in a Christian owned and operated store and not being taken avantage of then she would at MD’s. I would suggest that you give some thought to where you are going to spend eternity.

A recurring theme in these posts are how“Christian”CFA is. While it is a good company, (I worked“mothers hours”for many years), it is still a business like any other. Money is a motivator. Yes, the company does a great service in teaching teens good work ethics and offering scholarships, etc., etc., and many of these teens later return to run their own stores. But…not all operators and/or managers are the ethical, up-standing Christians the general public believes they are. As to the Closed-on-Sunday issue - once I worked up to a management level position, I worked many, many Sundays. Also, team meetings are typically held on Sundays with mandatory attendence. If you read Mr. Cathy’s first book, you will learn his closing on Sunday had more to do with needing a day of rest than honoring the day. Starting up his business was all-consuming in the early days and he and his brother just couldn’t continue working the hours and days without a break. And, he sees nothing wrong with eating out on Sundays as he and his wife do so on a regular basis. All of you who praise his closing on Sunday…do you just dine elsewhere on Sunday? If so, what’s the big deal about whether a place of business is open on Sunday or not?

Who cares about fatty fried chicken? I can’t believe that NO ONE has mentioned Chick-fil-A’s sweet tea, which is by far the best! None of that fountain Nestea crap that Mc D’s tries to pass off. It works wonders for a hangover too. :)

Both companies are obviously popular and successful (though each varies by location). How many of the opinions here are based on actually trying the product? None?

Are you kidding me? I don’t plan on eating ANYTHING that is so loaded with sodium and a big dollop of fat. My taste buds thank me everyday for the lessened sodium drenching…so much that they allow me to taste ALL the other food flavors on a regular basis. Plus, if you really want to manage your weight, you will watch that sodium content. Fast food&amp;processed foods = High sodium loads which can and will kill you…slowly.

I LOVE Chick-fil-a. I go to church with the Cathy’s. They are WONDERFUL Christian leaders in our church, community, and in their business. They close on Sundays to dedicate the day to the Lord&amp;to allow their employees to do the same. They are not all about making money, but how to give to others!!! Chick-fil-a not only has awesome food, but are top notch in their business!!! I hope JR paid attention to“why Chick-fil-a is closed on Sundays”!! Hooray to the Cathy’s for standing up for Who they believe in!!!!!!

I can’t believe McDonald’s thinks they are even in the same legue with Chick-fil-A. When I go to a Chick-fil-A everyone there is geniune kind. I don’t feel as though I am being rushed to order. I KNOW I am not getting some hard, cold leftovers. The restaurants are CLEAN, in the exception of one that I went to and saw“critters”.
I like the fact they are closed on Sundays and do not have a midnight drive thru. McDonald’s has its following….and NO, I’m NOT loving it!
