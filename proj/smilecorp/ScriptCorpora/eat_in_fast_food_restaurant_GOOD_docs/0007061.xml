  Unbelievable that this was the same restaurant as a few years ago. First time back 1/12/10 in at least 4 years, but I&apos;ll be frequenting the place a good bit more now. A mountainous bento, and all of it delicious. A diner [dick@ccpllc.org]
 from Sellwood Area of Portland, Oregon gave an overall rating of on November 3, 2007 @ 6:19 PM

  My wife and I &quot;discovered&quot; Gaya Gaya about two years ago. We have been coming back nearly every other weekend. The service is outstanding and the food is excellent. The value for our money is just great. We, and everyone else, are greeted when we enter and made to feel at home.

We have been associated with the Japanese community in Portland for nearly 40 years and over this time have eaten at many excellent Japanese restaurants. Gaya Gaya is one of the top ones. It is so good that we intend to bring a Japanese-American friend to Gaya for her 90th birthday next spring. We have taken her to other places in the past, but she has heard of Gaya and is looking forward to dining there with us.

Keep up the good work.
Thanks,
Dick and Ann Brenneke

 Miyamoto Sushi

  It seems that Miyamoto has quickly outgrown its small space and few employees. If you simply must have their sushi, we recommend you call ahead 2 hours before you want to eat, whether it&apos;s dine-in or take-out.
