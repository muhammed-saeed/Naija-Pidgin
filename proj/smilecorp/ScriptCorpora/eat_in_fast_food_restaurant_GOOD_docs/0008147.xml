 ST. LOUIS • Police shot and killed a drug
suspect at West Florissant and Acme avenues early Tuesday afternoon
after a mile-long chase through the area, according to
authorities.

Authorities identified the dead man as Anthony Lamar Smith, 24,
of the 4800 block of Page Boulevard in St. Louis.

Two officers saw what they believed to be a drug transaction
near a fast-food restaurant at Thekla Avenue and Riverview
Boulevard after noon, according to Capt. Michael Sack. When police
approached a car involved in the suspected drug transaction, they
saw Smith reaching for something under the seat or between the seat
and the center console.

Officers ordered Smith to stop and show his hands, but he put
the car in gear and drove toward an officer, Sack said. The second
officer, fearing for the first officer&apos;s safety, fired at Smith,
Sack said.

It was unclear if Smith was hit by a bullet at that point. The
car kept going and police pursued it to West Florissant and Acme,
just west of Goodfellow Boulevard, where Smith lost control of his
vehicle on the wet road, Sack said. The police SUV hit the
vehicle.

When officers got out of their SUV, they again saw Smith
reaching for something under the seat, Sack said. They repeatedly
asked Smith to show his hands and, fearing he was trying to
retrieve a weapon, fired when he did not comply, Sack said.

Smith was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

&quot;They wouldn&apos;t let me kiss him or hug him goodbye,&quot; said Smith&apos;s
mother, Annie Smith.

The officers were not injured. The officer that fired at the
suspect is 31 and has as been an officer for four years, the
department said. He was put on paid leave, as is standard in such
shootings.

Sack said officers found drugs and a gun in the suspect&apos;s
vehicle, a silver sedan.

Court and Missouri Department of Corrections records show Smith
faced theft, weapons and drug charges in the past and served prison
time on at least some of those charges.

Kirkwin Taylor said he and his 5-year-old son went to the
fast-food restaurant with Smith. Taylor said he was inside getting
food when the incident with police started. He said there was no
drug transaction and he doesn&apos;t believe his friend had a gun in his
car.

&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have had my son in there if there was a gun in
there,&quot; he said.

Christina Wilson, 31, the pregnant girlfriend of Smith and
mother of Smith&apos;s 1-year-old daughter, said she was on the phone
with him when he was shot.

&quot;He was crying for help,&quot; she said outside of the hospital. &quot;I
could hear him moaning, &apos;Oh, oh.&apos;&quot;
