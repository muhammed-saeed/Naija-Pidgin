off fireworks as a prank near the porch of a teacher&apos;s home on Walnut Grove Road

 A Lorain County (Ohio) father will have to perform
community service after his 12-year-old son had part of his finger blown off by
an exploding firework.   

 Earlier this month his son lit a Roman candle
firecracker and it exploded in his hand. The tip of the boy&apos;s little finger is
missing and he had third-degree burns on his palm. 

 The man pleaded guilty in court. He was charged because
his son is a minor. The man faced a $400 fine and 30 days in jail. Instead, he
will perform one day of community service.

 Saturday, July 4, 2009, Ocracoke Island in Hyde County,
N.C. 

 A truck carrying fireworks for a July Fourth holiday
display exploded at approximately 9 a.m. in the parking lot of the North
Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching (NCCAT) campus overlooking
Silver Lake harbor, near the island&apos;s South Ferry Terminal. 

 One worker died at the scene, and a second died about
six hours after the blast at the University of North Carolina&apos;s Jaycee Burn
Center at Chapel Hill after receiving burns to more than 95 percent of his body.
One other victim remained with burns to 20 percent of his body at the Burn
Center and two were taken by helicopter to Pitt County Memorial Hospital in
Greenville, N.C., where one died later Saturday, July 4. The second worker taken
to Greenville died Sunday, July 5. 

 All of the blast&apos;s victims, four men and a woman,
were members of the crew working on Ocracoke Island&apos;s annual Independence Day
fireworks show, which was cancelled. 

 Two explosions shook homes and businesses and could be
heard for miles. 

 The explosion peeled the top off the 18-wheeler truck,
sparked several small brush fires and sent debris flying into the nearby water. 

 Even hours after the explosion you could still smell
fireworks in the air. 

 A witness said she and her fianc saw one of the crew
members blown back toward the shoreline, a firework blew through another one of
the crew member&apos;s cheeks. 

 Not all of the fireworks exploded, and officials closed
the terminal until they could secure the remaining pyrotechnics. 

 A handful of firefighters had just finished hosing down
the area a routine precaution taken to prevent stray fires during the
display and were taking a break away from the area when the truck suddenly
exploded. Initially, they had to duck behind fire trucks as the fireworks shot
across the area. As quickly as possible, the firefighters started putting out
numerous brush fires and helped in rescue efforts for the victims. 

 Two volunteer firefighters suffered inhalation injuries
and exhaustion. 

 The explosion occurred near the south ferry dock, which
serves vessels travelling to Swan Quarter and Cedar Island, and that ferry
service was shut down for most of the day for clean up operations. 

 The lone survivor of the explosion, Martez Holland
(27), may have avoided death by a coincidence of location. He was at the back of
the truck unloading fireworks; the others were farther inside. Martez Holland
suffered third degree burns on his arms and hands; he is expected to recover but
will need extensive therapy. 

 Terry Holland (50), Mark Curtis Hill (21), Lisa Simmons
(42) and Charles Kirkland Junior (49) were killed in the blast. All worked for
South Carolina-based Melrose South Pyrotechnics. 

 The Anchorage Marina dock master says from his vantage
point 200 yards away, it looked like 40 minutes worth of fireworks went off in
four seconds. 

 For the 22-minute show planned in Ocracoke, Julie L.
Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, said,
there could have been 5,000 to 10,000 pounds of explosives in the truck. 

 The explosion was accidental, investigators determined
late Saturday, July 4, 2009.

 Lehi.
A boy (11) was riding his bicycle in his grandparents&apos; neighborhood, around
1200 West and 1300 North, when a neighbor (46) put gunpowder inside a metal pipe
to make it flare like a firework. When lit, it exploded the boy was 30-40
feet away - and shrapnel ripped open the left side of the boy&apos;s torso. The
blast ripped his intestines, cut the large blood vessels in his lower abdomen
and left thigh, and may have severed a nerve to muscles in his leg. The bones in
the boy&apos;s pelvis and upper left leg were shattered; he may yet lose his leg.

Melvindale, Mich. A grassroots picnic at the site of Auto Town Car Wash on Outer Drive,
with a $1,000 commercial grade fireworks show ended in horror. 

 One
of the 3-inch-wide mortars did not go off, and Danialle Barse, 27, mother of
three, stuck her head over it to see why it did not fire. Moments later, it did.
The explosive meant to propel 200-300 feet into the air struck her head, and a
crowd of 30 including her eight-year old son and her finance could not
get to her until the 25 shot firework had finished firing. 

 Danialle
Barse died shortly after 10pm on July 2.   

 Apparently,
the commercial grade fireworks were obtained without the proper licensing. 

 Investigation
is going on how the group could obtain fireworks that normally are used only in
municipal or professional displays by licensed professionals. 2.7.2007

 Vienna,
Virginia. Chinese-manufactured fireworks malfunctioned at a the Vienna public
fireworks show at Vienna Elementary School, rocketing into a crowd at least 280
feet away, composed mostly of children and caused injuries. Seven victims,
including the five children, were transported to hospitals; two of them with
life-threatening injuries. Four victims were treated at the scene. 

 Fairfax
County Fire Department spokes men said a fireworks operator lit the fuse leading
to a prepackaged cardboard&quot;cakebox&quot;of 25 fireworks mortars, designed for a
rapid-fire display. As the mortars fired, one exploded in the box instead of
launching into the air, which knocked over neighboring mortars. Those fallen
mortars launched at a low trajectory, firing into the crowd. The mortar box had
been surrounded by an estimated 800 pounds of sandbags. The bags were&quot;blown
out&quot;by the mortar. 4.7.2007

 August 7, a grand jury indicted Terrance Hough on three counts of aggravated
 murder and tow counts of attempted murder. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor said
 the provocation was minor and the attack was made worse by firing at victims
 who had already fallen to the ground wounded and that he would seek the
 death penalty. Police at the scene said the shooting about 12:10 a.m. on
 July 5 on the neighbor&apos;s driveway apparently were prompted by anger over
 fireworks and a loud party. The defense was investigating medical issues
 that might be raised on Hough&apos;s behalf. Hough&apos;s attorney wouldn&apos;t elaborate,
 but firefighters and others who work rotating shifts can be more subject to
 sleep disorders. According to the National Sleep Foundation, shift workers
 often don&apos;t get enough sleep, which can lead to irritability, impatience,
 anxiety and depression that can&quot;upset job and family relationships,
 spoil social activities and cause unnecessary suffering.&quot;

Independence Day fireworks show at the High School Football Stadium, were
injured when a fireworks exploded close to the ground, lighting a barrel of
unused fireworks.

after only a few feet of flight, sending an ember into the trash can. The worker
put the lid back on the can and it exploded, engulfing a brother (25) and sister
(27) in flames. The explosion was so powerful it sent the man flying through the
air and into a nearby fence.

one article it is written that the man suffered burns to more than 99 percent of
his body, about two-thirds of which were third-degree burns and that the woman
suffered burns to about 80 percent of her body, her lungs also were badly burned.
In other articles it is written that the woman is burned over 35 percent of her
body and that the man suffered burns to about 50 percent of his body. 

 The
fire had burned all the clothing from both victims.

were linked to a pipe bomb placed in a mailbox on July 26. Officials say they
got the powder of firecrackers, put it inside a PCP pipe, and sealed it up to
create the bomb.

 West
Peoria, Ill. Four college students (21, 22, 19, 20) were charged August 13 with
aggravated arson and possession of an explosive or incendiary device in the
death of Sheridan Dahlquist. 

 Sheridan&quot;Danny&quot;Dahlquist (19) died Sunday, August 12 of smoke inhalation
after a fire in his bedroom at an off-campus house he shared with three of the
students. The four men lit roman candles under Dahlquist&apos;s bedroom door as an
apparent prank. They then tried to rescue Dahlquist when they saw the roman candles started a
fire, but were turned back by intense heat. 

 The
men could have faced first-degree murder charges, but prosecutors opted for
lesser counts after deciding they didn&apos;t mean to harm Dahlquist. 

 Investigators
later determined that the men had been involved in a similar prank two days
before, and set off a roman candle under Dahlquist&apos;s door earlier Sunday that
failed to ignite. They returned and lit two more, shooting off up to 16 balls of
fire that burned at about 1,500 degrees and ignited a wall across from the door.

 A six-month term in the Peoria County Jail for four men (20, 20, 22, 22)
 involved in a fatal college prank summer 2007 should let people know they
 are being held responsible for their actions, said the county&apos;s top
 prosecutor. They all pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, a   reduced felony as part of a plea agreement for the Aug. 12 death of
 Sheridan&quot;Danny&quot;Dahlquist (19). As a result, more serious charges
 were dropped. Under the terms of their probation, the four men will serve
 all of their six months in jail, which is unusual. In addition to the jail
 sentence, restitution of nearly $21,000 was ordered to be paid collectively
 by the four. (Link to statement and evidence outline prepared by Peoria

 Wichita,
Kan. Three men (18) face federal arson charges following a series of explosions
that rocked three different areas. The first device was detonated just after 6
a.m. beneath a construction barrel blocking the entrance to Brooks Middle School
and destroyed the barrel but did no other damage. The second exploded shortly
before 6:30 a.m. at the Chalet Apartments. The third went off at 8:12 a.m. at
the Kingsborough Apartments. The blasts caused extensive damage to the apartment
buildings. They blew entrance doors out, damaged the staircases, blew doors off
apartments and caused significant damage to the ceilings, wall and windows. The
two buildings damaged by the explosions were evacuated; it could be several days
before residents can return home. Witnesses told police they saw two men open a
door and throw something inside a few moments before the explosion. 

 The
commercial-grade fireworks shells were 4 to 6 inches in diameter, Wichita Fire
Marshal said. They did not ignite fires when they went off, he said, they simply
scorched the carpet where they were placed. 17.8.2007

Just before 7 a.m. a house on Dunrobin Avenue packed with fireworks caught fire,
setting off an explosion that rocked the house off its foundation. The explosion
could be felt nearly two miles away. The blast not only shattered windows about
three blocks away but sent items from the man&apos;s residence and garage flying
like projectiles.

man suffered minor first and second degree burns to his body. He was booked on
suspicion of possessing illegal fireworks at the sheriffs station, where he was
being held in lieu of $500,000 bail. The
blast left the home uninhabitable and damaged the garage and two of the cars.

 Stafford,
Hopyard Road/Northeastern Connecticut. At least one person was killed, one other
missed and a house - apparently loaded with fireworks - and two cars in the
driveway were destroyed by explosions and flames that shot 70 feet in the air.  

 A
large quantity of fireworks sparked several small explosions and then a large
explosion leveled the house. Neighbors said the
explosions rattled their homes, knocking books and other items off shelves. Firefighters did find
one body before they had to pull back because of the large amounts of explosives
in the rubble. It happened at about
3 p.m. and the firefighters are letting the blaze burn itself out throughout the
night, because it&apos;s too dangerous and unstable to get near. 

 The
man who lived inside the home reportedly made commercial grade fireworks. As
firefighters pulled up, there was no house, just a hole in the ground with
burning debris all around. 

 Crews
were still at the scene of the disaster 24 hours after the house caught fire and
exploded. About 50 to 75
firefighters fought the fire 15.3.2006

 Stafford, Conn. Illegal storage and manufacturing of fireworks and
 explosives were determined to be the origin and cause of an explosion and
 fire that killed two men and leveled a Hopyard Road house March 15. No one
 will be charged in the incident because both men died in the fire. Salvatore
 &apos;Tito&apos; Fiore (75) and his nephew James Sacheli (54) lived in the house and
 died both as a result of the explosion. Illegal fireworks
 and explosives Fiore was making in his basement and storing in the house led
 to the explosion.

 Boynton Beach, FL. At least one person was killed in a house explosion at
about 8:30 p.m. The blast and the fire that followed destroyed a storage facility and RV trailer, a tent, a boat, a pickup
truck and a car on the property and shredded nearby trees. The
body was found near the burned out rubble of the trailer. The blast could be
felt for several miles and shattered windows, causing minor damage to nearby
homes. Neighbors, who live about 300 feet away, found pieces of the camper and
fireworks debris in their yard. Fire officials believe those inside the house
were making home-made fireworks and a search of the grounds turned up &apos;unexploded
pyrotechnics&apos;. 18.4.2006

 T he families of
two men killed in a fireworks explosion at Coeur d&apos;Alene Casino have accused on
June 30, 2008, the
Coeur d&apos;Alene Tribe and Casino, and several companies of negligence. 

 A state inspection determined
leaky propane tanks contributed to the June 26, 2006, explosion that killed
maintenance workers Richard E. Stokes (49) and Donald S. Hanson (56) and said
the explosion likely was intensified by the fireworks stored in the same metal
container as the tanks. 

 The lawsuit details the
accusations against the tribe and the companies that supplied the propane and
fireworks, which range from improper storage to neglecting to warn employees
about the danger of storing propane with fireworks.

 Elkhart
Lake. A bride-to-be was one of six people injured after a stray fireworks shell
during a show at Firemen&apos;s Park exploded in the middle of her pre-wedding party.   She was to be married tomorrow but instead ended up in a hospital Friday
night after being hit in the stomach by shrapnel from the shell and suffering&quot;major burns&quot;to the abdomen and hand. Four other members of
the wedding party (the bride-to-be&apos;s mother and sister, a groomsman and a
bridesmaid) were also injured. The groomsman and bridesmaid were burned and
struck in the chest by shrapnel, the bride&apos;s mother and sister suffered minor
burns. 

 The
fireworks shell that struck the bride-to-be was one of as many as three shells
that launched horizontally onto shore from a barge in Elkhart Lake. It happened
after an explosion rocked the barge, partially blasting through its steel bottom
and tipping over a rack of fireworks. The shell that injured the bride-to-be
flew over a beachfront house and about 100 yards onto shore, where it landed in
an alley, skipped once and exploded. 30.6.2006
