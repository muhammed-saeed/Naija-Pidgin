 Volunteer helps homeless children give Mother’s Day gifts

Shaira Hankins, 6, shows off her Mother&apos;s Day present.
 
A child’s present for Mother’s Day may seem like a trivial thing—especially when child and mom live in a homeless shelter. But the longing to give your mother something really special on the big day doesn’t change just because you don’t have a house. You’re still a kid, and she’s still your mom.

So when Kara Dewey toured the Orlando Union Rescue Mission a couple of weeks ago and saw all the families who call it home, an idea stuck her. Later, Dewey—a Mary Kay associate—called the mission with her plan: She would donate cosmetics and fragrances so that the kids could pick something out to wrap and give to their mothers this Sunday. For kids who have virtually nothing, it was huge.

“The kids had a blast picking out a special gift, wrapping it up themselves, and crafting a card for mom,”says Yadira Elrod, the community relations coordinator for the mission.

Dewey, who hopes to open her own homeless shelter one day, said she felt it was what God wanted her to do. She brought an assortment of lip gloss, body wash and perfumes as well as wrapping paper and bows. She set up three little stations for the kids, letting them move from purchase to wrapping to card creation.

Then the kids posed for pictures, showing off  their treasures.

Now, all they have to do is try to keep their secret under wraps until Sunday—which could prove the toughest part yet.

On any given night, the Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida houses more than 250 children. Their average age? Eight years old.

Here, the kids have day care and after-school care. The grown-ups in their lives can get parenting classes and job training. And there are toys, books, games, a safe place to sleep and a buffer from the sort of violence and substance abuse many children have witnessed outside these walls.

All this takes money, of course.

To pay for the programs and services, the coalition hosts its biggest fundraising event of the year Saturday evening.

And this year, for the first time, it has gone country.

The 19th Annual Hearts of Gold main event is at 8 p.m. at Hard Rock Live Orlando and features Little Big Town in concert, with emcees Shadow and Bobby Mitchell from Orlando country station K-92.3 FM.

Before the concert, there will be a VIP reception and silent auction starting at 6 p.m., also at Hard Rock Live. Organizers expect an audience of more than 1,000—including many of Central Florida’s government, business and philanthropic leaders (in case you’re looking to rub elbows).

Concert-only tickets are $37 (standing) and $52 (reserved) at Ticketmaster or at the door. VIP tickets are $150 and available through CentralFloridaHomeless.org or at the door.

The coalition is the single largest provider of homeless services in Central Florida.

Fifteen-year-old Alex and his sister Amanda, 14, have kept up a 3.5 grade-point average despite living the past five months in a Sanford motel room. They’re good kids—well-mannered, bright, respectful and supportive of each other.

They’re the type of kids, officials at the Department of Children and Families hope, people will want to help if only they knew how.

Today their family of three is being featured in the debut edition of a DCF Facebook campaign called“Homeless 2 Home”—created after staffer Carrie Hoeppner posted on her personal Facebook page about a homeless family facing Christmas without food. The post touched off an outpouring of support that included food, Christmas gifts and job leads. The DCF project will feature a new family each month along with some suggestions of how you can help.

In this case, the family is led by 38-year-old Jennifer, who lost her job after returning to her native Puerto Rico to make funeral arrangements for her mother. The job loss triggered a financial free fall as bills piled up and Jennifer had to move out of her apartment and turn over her car to creditors. She wound up with the only job she could find—part-time at a fast-food restaurant. Thanks to aid from Seminole County schools’Families in Transition program, she can afford the motel room, which comes with a tiny kitchenette. In the video you see how the cramped quarters demand impressive organization skills—and how there’s absolutely no privacy for two growing teens.

Alex may be 15, but his body has already reached manhood. He keeps his clothes in a pair of duffle bags so that his mother and sister can use the short clothing rod in the bathroom to hang their blouses and dresses.

“They’re my treasure,”Jennifer, 38, says of her children.“So I will do anything. You know, I will clean, I will sweep floors, whatever. I just need them to…keep going to school. I don’t want them to give up.”

Then she reminds herself to lead by example.

If you want to help, the family needs basic household items–furniture, linens, flatware, cooking utensils and pots and pans. They also need hygiene items, deposits for utilities, bus passes and gift cards to Walmart, clothing stores, grocery stores and restaurants. The teens, who have no budget for extra expenses at schools or such simple pleasures as going to the movies, could use gift cards for those things.

And Jennifer’s biggest request is for a full-time job, preferably in Altamonte Springs, where she hopes to rent an apartment if she can earn enough money for the security deposit.

If you’d like to contribute in any of these ways—or have other ideas on how to help–contact DCF via anna_obrien@dcf.state.fl.us. Note that the family already has been screened by the staff at Families in Transition—so Jennifer, Alex and Amanda are the real deal. If you help, you can be certain this is really a family that needs it.

“While the sheer number of families in need of assistance easily overwhelms,”Hoeppner says,“the community has the opportunity to change the life of a local family – one at a time, one need at a time.”

Through Aug. 10, you can donate to Kavaliro&apos;s food drive for kids at Stenstrom Elementary, where parents have been deeply affected by the recession.
 
Inspired by the CBS 60 Minutes story on homeless families in Central Florida, the staffing firm Kavaliro is holding food drives to support the students at Oviedo’s Douglas Stenstrom Elementary .

Two years ago, Stenstrom started a backpack program to send home food with students who are eligible for the federal free- or reduced-cost lunch program. Each week, 10 to 15 kids take home the backpacks filled with enough groceries for two breakfasts, two lunches and two dinners—in other words, enough to get through the weekend. The empty backpacks are returned each Monday to be refilled for a different set of 10 to 15 kids.

Because the need is so great, the school has to rotate the recipients.

From now through Aug. 10, Kavaliro—with help from men’s group at St. Mary Magdalene in Altamonte Springs—will be collecting pasta, pasta sauce and macaroni and cheese. Anyone interested in donating individually or getting a drop-off box for his or her office should email the firm’s community relations director, Lisa Moore, at lmoore@kavaliro.com . Note that because children will be carrying the items home from school, plastic, regular-sized containers are preferred, but the firm will accept whatever people are able to give.

Kavaliro also will have a box at its East Orlando office, located at 3504 Lake Lynda Drive, Suite 175.

“The 60 Minutes story moved all of us here at Kavaliro so much that we just knew we had to help in some capacity,”Moore said.

When the firm held a peanut butter and jelly drive last spring, it collected 234 containers of peanut butter and 275 containers of jelly.

 It was only six months ago when a small charity called New Directions Community Outreach was struggling to survive. A tiny band of volunteers was working hard to provide school supplies, scholarships, food and clothing to homeless families in Seminole County—but promises from a major supporter failed to materialize.

Then Debra Thomas—New Direction’s founder and once homeless herself—told her story in the Sentinel . And the community rallied to her rescue.

Thousands of dollars in donations poured in to help Thomas fuel her scholarship fund, provide Thanksgiving dinners, and even offer down-payment assistance to families so they could become homeowners.

To avoid any trouble this year, Thomas is starting extra early with New Direction’s backpack and school supply drive and its“No Dream Is Impossible”scholarship fund. She is looking for monetary donations, supplies for the classroom, backpacks and canned goods so that students can take home donated food during the summer.

Thomas also needs volunteers for the school year and summer, people willing to sponsor a family, and clothes, shoes and socks for children.

 If you can help, contact Thomas at 407-690-9343 or 407-265-2396 or Shamek Thompson at 917-837-2439. Donations also can be sent to the organization’s office at 108 Forest Ave. in Altamonte Springs (32708.)

 The number of homeless families across the nation has surged by almost 40,000 since the recession began in 2007 — a 30-percent increase — according to a federal report released Tuesday. The figures for Florida were similarly dismal.

The report, from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , is the first to look at the overall impact of the recession and a major shift in how nonprofit agencies deal with the homeless.

The good news: Thanks to what HUD called a “dramatic” expansion of the permanent housing programs for the chronically homeless in many parts of the nation, the overall homeless population dropped about 10 percent from 2008 to 2009.

The bad news: In Florida, where such programs have been in limited supply, the homeless population for the same period grew by nearly 11 percent — or about 5,400 people.

The worse news: The number of homeless families in Florida rose even more. From 2008 to 2009, that figured climbed 23 percent, with 7,750 families homeless at the latest count.

Though the numbers aren’t broken down by county, local advocates have tracked the number of school-age children who are homeless. In Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties, for example, about 2,700 homeless kids were attending public schools in May 2008. A year later, the number had mushroomed to 4,200.

The figures don’t include families that are doubling up in apartments or “sofa surfing” at the homes of friends and relatives — a common practice for those who have lost their homes through foreclosure or eviction.

“There’s an independent study on the doubling-up issue, and it’s significant, said HUD Assistant Secretary Mercedes Márquez. “There has been a five-fold increase in doubling up [nationwide] over this last year.”
