Nutrition and Your Health
 Dietary Guidelines 
 for Americans 
 Avoid Too Much 
 Sodium 
 From the Editor 
This Is one of a series of bulletins
with tips to help you use the seven
Dietary Guidelines in choosing and
preparing the foods you eat and
serve to others. Following the
Dietary Guidelines is a balancing
act: getting the variety of foods
necessary to supply the nutrients
you need, but not too much of other
food components—calories, fat and
cholesterol, sugar, sodium, and
alcohol. This bulletin shows how to
&quot;Avoid Too Much Sodium.&quot;But
remember, it&apos;s important to consider
all seven guidelines in building a
healthful diet:
• Eat a Variety of Foods
• Maintain Desirable Weight
• Avoid Too Much Fat, Saturated
Fat, and Cholesterol
• Eat Foods with Adequate Starch
and Fiber
• Avoid Too Much Sugar
• Avoid Too Much Sodium
• If You Drink Alcoholic Beverages,
Do So in Moderation
 Test Your Sodium Knowledge 
To see what you already know about sodium and your diet, take this
quiz. After you&apos;ve read this bulletin, try the quiz again to see how much
you have learned. (Answers are on page 8.),
True False
Sodium information is provided on nutrition
labels of many foods.
One way to decrease your sodium intake is to
use onion and garlic salts instead of table salt.
3.
4.
5.
Many canned and commercially prepared
foods have sodium added.
To reduce sodium, you can use condiments
like soy sauce, mustard, salad dressings,
pickles, and relishes instead of salt for
flavoring foods.
7.
8.
9.
 10. 
Most foods in the same food group, such as milk
and cheese, contain similar amounts of sodium.
Sodium may be added to processed foods as a
preservative as well as a flavoring agent.
Salt substitutes are a good idea for everyone
trying to reduce sodium intake.
You can always tell how much sodium a
product contains by tasting it.
Preference for the taste of salt is learned,
but can be changed with practice.
Many recipes can be prepared with less salt
without affecting their acceptability.
 Sodium and 
 High Blood Pressure 
About one in four Americans has
elevated blood pressure. Because it
often produces no symptom&apos;s, blood,
pressure should be checked,
regularly for early diagnosis. High
blood pressure increases the risk
for heart attack, stroke, and kidney
disease.
r
,—--
Risk factors for high blood; pressure
include a famfly history oHhe
disease, overweight, and a high
sodium intake. Some individuals
can eat high-sodium diets without
increased blood pressure; others
cannot.
Too much sodium in the diet may
aggravate high blood pressure once
it exists. Thus, limiting dietary
sodium is often an important part of
treatment, along with exercise,
weight reduction (if appropriate),
and medication.
We cannot predict who will develop
high blood pressure, but we know
that many Americans eat much more
sodium than they actually need.
Therefore, many health
professionals believe that reducing
sodium is sensible for the
population as a whole.
Four out of 10 adults are trying to
cut down on salt or sodium.
Consider reducing your sodium
intake.

 Getting the Fac 
 What Is Sodium? 
 What&apos;s That Sodium DOING There? 
Sodium is a mineral that occurs naturally in some foods
and is added to many foods and beverages. Most of
the sodium in the American diet comes from table salt,
which is 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride.
One teaspoon of salt contains about 2,000 milligrams
of sodium.
 Why Is Sodium Important? 
Sodium attracts water into the blood vessels and helps
maintain normal blood volume and blood pressure.
Sodium is also needed for the normal function of
nerves and muscles.
 How Much Sodium Do I Need? 
Although some sodium is essential to your health, you
need very little. The National Research Council of the
National Academy of Sciences suggests that a&quot;safe
and adequate&quot;range of sodium intake per day is about
1,100 to 3,300 milligrams for adults. This is well below
the amount that most American adults consume.
 Where Is Sodium Found in My Diet? 
Sodium is in many foods you eat. It may occur
naturally in a food or be added during processing,
cooking, or at the table. Most sodium added during
processing comes from salt, but other ingredients and
additives used by manufacturers contain sodium as
well. Salt is second only to sugar in amount added by
manufacturers to the foods Americans eat.
Foods that provide significant amounts of sodium in the
diets of Americans (excluding sodium added during
cooking or at the table) include bread and bakery
products, cured and processed meats, canned
vegetables, and milk products, especially many
cheeses. Estimating the actual sodium content of diets
is difficult because of the variable amounts of sodium
people add to foods during cooking and at the table.
Most of the sodium in processed foods is added to
preserve and/or flavor them. Salt is the major
source of sodium added to these foods. It is added
to most canned and some frozen vegetables,
smoked and cured meats, pickles, and sauerkraut.
Salt is used in most cheeses, sauces, soups, salad
dressings, and in many breakfast cereals. Sodium
is also found in many other ingredients used in
food processing. Examples of sodium-containing
ingredients and their uses in foods are:
Baking powder—leavening agent
Baking soda—leavening agent
Monosodium glutamate—flavor enhancer
Sodium benzoate—preservative
Sodium caseinate—thickener and binder
Sodium citrate—buffer, used to control acidity in
soft drinks and fruit drinks
Sodium nitrite—curing agent in meat, provides
color, prevents botulism (a food poisoning)
Sodium phosphate—emulsifier, stabilizer, buffer
Sodium propionate—mold inhibitor
Sodium saccharin—artificial sweetener
 About Condiments 
Watch out for commercially prepared condiments,
sauces, and seasonings when preparing and
serving foods for you and your family. Many, like
those below, are high in sodium.
Onion salt
Celery salt
Garlic salt
Seasoned salt
Meat tenderizer
Bouillon
Baking powder
Baking soda
Monosodium
glutamate (msg)
Soy sauce
Steak sauce
Barbecue sauce
Catsup
Mustard
Worcestershire sauce
Salad dressings
Pickles
Chili sauce
Relish
THE
 SALT O SODIUM 
The link between salt and sodium may be a little
hard to understand at first. If you remember that
1 teaspoon of salt provides 2,000 milligrams of
 Salt—Sodium Conversions 
1/4 tsp. salt = 500 mg sodium
1/2 tsp. salt = 1,000 mg sodium
3/4 tsp. salt = 1,500 mg sodium
1 tsp. salt = 2,000 mg sodium
sodium, however, you can estimate the amount of
sodium that you add to foods during cooking and
preparation, or even at the table.

 Some Major Points 
 About the Table: 
• Unprocessed grains are naturally
low in sodium. Ready-to-eat
cereals vary widely in sodium
content. Some have no salt
added at all. Others are higher in
sodium than most breads.
• Fresh, frozen, and canned fruits
and fruit juices are low in sodium.
Most canned vegetables,
vegetable juices, and frozen
vegetables with sauce are higher
in sodium than fresh or frozen
ones cooked without added salt.
• A serving of milk or yogurt is
lower in sodium than most natural
cheeses, which vary widely in
their sodium content. Process
cheeses, cheese foods, and
cheese spreads contain more
sodium than natural cheeses.
Cottage cheese falls somewhere
between natural and process
cheeses.
• Most fresh meats, poultry, and
fish are low in sodium. Canned
poultry and fish are higher. Most
cured and processed meats such
as hotdogs, sausage, and
luncheon meats are even higher
in sodium because sodium is
used during processing to
preserve them.
• Most&quot;convenience&quot;foods are
quite high in sodium. Frozen
dinners and combination dishes,
canned soups, and dehydrated
mixes for soups, sauces, and
salad dressings contain a lot of
sodium. Condiments such as soy
sauce, catsup, mustard, tartar
sauce, chili sauce, and pickles
and olives are also high in
sodium. (See the box on page 2
for some examples.)
• Many low- or reduced-sodium
foods are appearing on
supermarket shelves as
alternatives to those processed
with salt and other sodium-
containing ingredients. Check
the label for the sodium content
of these foods.
 
 Estimating the Sodium in Your Diet 
a look at how the foods you eat and the way you prepare and serve them affect the amount of sodium in
your diet.
Less than 3 to 5 times
once a week a week
Almost

•low often do you:
Eat cured or processed meats such as ham, bacon,
sausage, frankfurters, and other luncheon meats?
Choose canned vegetables or frozen vegetables with
sauce?
Use commercially prepared meals, main dishes, or
canned or dehydrated soups?
Eat cheese?
Eat salted nuts, popcorn, pretzels, corn chips,
potato chips?
Add salt to cooking water for vegetables, rice,
or pasta?
Add salt, seasoning mixes, salad dressings, or
condiments such as soy sauce, steak sauce, catsup,
and mustard to foods during preparation or at the
table?
Salt your food before tasting it?

i
daily
 How Did You Do? 
The more checks you have in the last two columns, the
higher your diet is likely to be in sodium. However, not
all of the items listed contribute the same amount of
sodium. For example, many natural cheeses are
relatively low in sodium. Most process cheeses and
cottage cheese are higher.
To cut back on sodium, you can start by having some
items less often, particularly those you checked as&quot;3
to 5 times a week&quot;or more. This does not mean
eliminating foods from your diet. You can moderate
your sodium intake by choosing lower sodium foods
from each food group more often and by balancing
high-sodium foods with low-sodium ones. For example,
if you serve ham for dinner, plan to serve it with fresh
or plain frozen vegetables cooked without added salt.
 &apos;Shake the Habit&apos; 
About one-third of the average daily intake of sodium
comes from salt added to food in cooking or at the
table. How much salt do you add? Try this test: Cover
a plate with wax paper or foil. Salt the plate as you
would if it contained food. Collect the salt and
measure it. If you used about 1/8 teaspoon, that
amounts to 250 milligrams of sodium.
 
Sodium Labeling
Nutrition and ingredient labels on foods can show you
the major sources of sodium in your diet and help give
you an idea of your sodium intake.
Using the Nutrition Label
NUTRITION LABELS are on many foods. Placing
sodium content on the nutrition label is now optional,
unless the product claims to be low or reduced in
sodium, or to have less salt or no salt added. However,
many manufacturers are providing this information as a
service to consumers.
Sodium on nutrition labels is given in milligrams (mg)
per serving. The amount includes sodium naturally
present in the ingredients as well as sodium added
during processing.
Here is part of a nutrition label like those you might see
on foods. This label for an oat cereal tells you that this
food provides 330 milligrams of sodium in a 1-ounce
serving.

Using the Ingredient Label
INGREDIENT LABELS are found on nearly all food
products. They list the ingredients in the food by
weight, from greatest to least. (See the sample below.)
Salt is the major-but not the only-source of sodium in
food products. Any ingredient that has sodium, salt, or
soda as part of its name (monosodium glutamate,
baking soda, seasoned salt) contains sodium. Soy
sauce and other condiments used as ingredients also
contribute sodium. (See box on page 2.)
 INGREDIENTS: Potatoes, vegetable oil, wh
dried milk solids, sour cream, onion salt,
monosodium glutamate, dried parsley, lactic acid,
sodium citrate, artificial flavors.
Many manufacturers are introducing foods with
reduced sodium. Examples of types of foods that are
now available in low-sodium form or with reduced or no
added salt include the following:
Q
Canned vegetables, vegetable
juices, and sauces
Canned soups
Dried soup mixes, bouillon
Condiments
Snack foods (chips, nuts,
pretzels)
Ready-to-eat cereals
Bread, bakery products
Butter, margarine
Cheeses
Tuna
Processed meats
Look for reduced-sodium versions
of these products where you shop.
The Fast Food Challenge
Trying to watch your sodium intake while eating at your
favorite fast food restaurant can be a real challenge.
Fast foods are often high in sodium and it isn&apos;t always
easy to predict which foods provide the largest
amounts. For example, an analysis of one popular fast
food meal found that an order of regular (salted) trench
fries contained less sodium than the regular
hamburger, or than the milkshake, or than the fruit pie
on the menu. There is some good news, however, for
fast food lovers who are watching their sodium intake.
More and more restaurants are providing nutrition
information—including sodium content—for foods on
their menus. Ask the manager of your favorite fast
food place for any available information.
A Word to the Wise
This food contains four different sodium ingredients.
Notice that salt is the fourth ingredient in the product
by weight. Therefore, this product is probably high in
sodium. If there is a nutrition label, check to see if the
amount of sodium in a serving is listed. If you want
more specific information, write to the manufacturer.
How salty a food tastes is not necessarily a good
indicator of how much sodium it contains. TRUST THE
LABEL, instead of your tastebuds.
 
 Avoiding Too Much Sodium-Some Suggestion 
A diet with less sodium does not have to be dull or 
limited in variety. There are many ways to reduce
sodium in your diet without sacrificing flavor or quality.
Here are some suggestions to help. Remember that
cutting back on sodium begins at the supermarket and
continues through food preparation and serving.
 At the Supermarket 
• Be a label reader. Look for information on the
sodium content. (See page 5 for details.) Learn to
recognize all of the sodium-containing ingredients.
• When shopping for lower sodium foods, fresh is
usually best. Fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, and
unprocessed grains are generally low in sodium.
Most&quot;convenience&quot;foods have sodium
compounds added, often to help preserve the food.
• Try the low- or reduced-sodium products that are
now available. Shop carefully, though. These
products can be more expensive. Make sure the
reduction in sodium justifies the added cost.
 In the Kitchen— 
• Plan meals that contain less sodium. Try new
recipes that use less salt and sodium-containing
ingredients. Adjust your own recipes by reducing
such ingredients a little at a time. Don&apos;t be fooled
by recipes that have little or no salt but call for
soups, bouillon cubes, or condiments that do.
• Experiment with spices and herbs as seasonings.
Use spices and herbs instead of salt. (See the
seasonings chart at right for ideas.)
• Cut back on salt used in cooking pasta, rice,
noodles, and hot cereals.
• Make your own condiments, dressings, and sauces
and keep sodium-containing ingredients at a
minimum.
Remember that the foods you prepare can contain less
sodium than commercially prepared ones. When you
make foods from scratch, you can control how much
sodium you add.
 At the Table- 
• Taste your food before you salt it. If, after tasting
your food, you must salt it, try one shake instead of
two.
• Limit the commercial condiments (such as catsup
and mustard), dressings, and sauces you add to
your food.
• Moderate your selection of high-sodium foods. But
be sensible. It&apos;s the total amount of sodium in your
diet that counts. Eating high-sodium foods
occasionally need not be a problem.
 Spicing It Up Without the Salt Shaker 
There are many ways to season foods without salt.
Experiment. Try the suggestions below or create your
own flavor combinations. A dot (•) means the
seasoning at the top goes well with the food to the left.

 Salt Substitutes? 
 What 
Salt substitutes are not for everyone, but they may be
helpful for some people trying to reduce their sodium
intake. Many salt substitutes contain potassium in
place of all or part of the sodium. People under
medical supervision, particularly for kidney problems,
should check with their physician before using these
salt substitutes.
Some salt substitutes contain neither sodium nor
potassium, but instead are mixtures of spices and
herbs. These, as well as homemade seasoning blends,
can be used to flavor foods without added sodium. See
the spice chart above for some suggestions, and try
seasoning some of your favorite recipes with more
herbs and spices and less salt.

 In the News 
 High Blood 
 Pressure and 
 Minerals in the 
 Diet 
Recently, calcium, potassium, and
magnesium have been in the news be-
cause of their possible roles in main-
taining normal blood pressure. While
research on dietary levels of these nu-
trients and high blood pressure contin-
ues, it is a good idea to make sure that
your diet contains enough of these
essential minerals.
CALCIUM is found in milk, cheese,
and yogurt. Dark-green leafy vege-
tables provide smaller amounts.
POTASSIUM is found in many
foods, including fruits and vegetables,
whole grains, and meat, poultry, and
fish.
MAGNESIUM is found in many
foods, including nuts, seeds, dry beans
and peas, dark-green leafy vegetables,
and whole grains.
Eating a variety of foods is a good
way to make sure that your diet is ade-
quate in these, as well as other, impor-
tant nutrients. (See bulletin on variety
in this series.)
 Test Your Sodium Knowledge 
(Answers to Quiz on page 1.)
1. True. Sodium labeling is presently voluntary,
except for products that claim to be low or
reduced in sodium. However, many
manufacturers provide this information on
their food labels as a service to consumers.
2. False. All seasoned salts contain sodium.
Garlic and onion powder, however, provide
flavor without added sodium.
3. True.
4. False. Most condiments are high in sodium.
Some lower sodium alternatives include
lemon, garlic, vinegar and oil, herbs, and
spices.
5. False. Foods within the same group can vary
widely in sodium content. See the table on
page 3 for some examples.
6. True.
7. False. Salt substitutes are not recommended
for everyone. People under medical
treatment should check with their physician
before using.
8. False. Taste is not a good indicator of
sodium content for all foods. Heavily salted
foods do not always taste salty and salt is not
the only source of sodium in foods.
9. True.
 An Encouraging Word 
 for Sal 
 4 
You were not born with a preference for salt. You
 learned it. This means that you can&quot;unlearn&quot;it by
gradually lowering the amount of salt in your diet.
Studies show that people who gradually reduce the
amount of salt they eat lose their desire for the
salty taste. Start with some small changes to see if
you can adapt to a lower salt diet.
