Things to Do   

 Depot Museum 
 
   Skylink Says:   This is a picture of the interesting Depot Museum, which is in the former train station. A 2nd photo of the main back room can be seen by clicking on the link under the photo. The museum can either be seen in 5 minutes or the full 2 hours that it is open each day, depending...   
 
 Kadoka School 
 
   Skylink Says:   This is the Kadoka School located at the end of the downtown area. Jackson County used to have dozens of schools but now has only 4 (or is it 5)? The school graduates between 15 and 30 high school graduates a year. It is the only school with high school grades in the entire...   
 
 airport hangers 
 
   Skylink Says:   there&apos;s a small plane in one of the hangers. The airport is very spartan. Just a few hangers shown and a grass runway strip. They do have a rotating beacon (light) that is turned on at night.   
 
 The water towers of Kadoka 
 
   Skylink Says:   There are 3 of them. One can guess which one is older by their appearance. Click on the link for pictures of the other 2 water towers (located under this picture).   
 
 downtown Kadoka

 Site of nuclear missile 
 
   Skylink Says:   The U.S. used to have Minuteman II missile that could reach the USSR in less than an hour and create nuclear mayhem. All of them have since been dismantled after signing of a treaty. Under the terms of the treaty, one missile site in both countries can be preserved for...   
 
 Delta 1 missile control 
 
   Skylink Says:   See the description under the Delta 1 armored car for directions. (exit 127, I-90, visable from the highway, on the north side of the highway which is on the right if you are travelling westbound to Rapid City).   
 
 Delta 1 armored car 
 
   Skylink Says:   This is a picture of an armored car on the grounds of Delta 1, the only preserved Minuteman II launch control facility, which is near Kadoka (exit 127, about 0.5 miles or 1 km north of the highway.) You can see the buildings from the highway. Even during the Cold War, it&apos;s...   
 
 Delta 1 AFB exhibit 
 
   Skylink Says:   This is a schematic drawing of how the missile launch control buildings were arranged. Note some of the underground structures.

 Kadoka signs 
 
   Skylink Says:   Here&apos;s a sign directing one to the Kadoka Airport. The runway is a grass strip but it does have a rotating beacon (light). Security is up to the standard necessary. You can walk on to the runway. However, there are no jets in Kadoka for terrorists to mess with.The second...

 Fast Food Restaurant: One of the restaurants in Kadoka

 Go beyond the highway exit to see Kadoka. 
 
   Skylink Says:   You will miss the charm of Kadoka if you simply get gas and/or stay at a motel on exit 150. At least, drive into town and visit the Depot Museum.

   Skylink Says:   .   
 
 depot museum 6 - 8 pm 
 
   Skylink Says:   It&apos;s only open for 2 hours a day so you have to plan ahead. It is worth a visit if you are in Kadoka.   
 
 no hospital 
 
   Skylink Says:   Be safe rather than sorry. There is no hospital in Kadoka. There is a small hospital in Phillip in the next county but it is not equipped for serious trauma. For that, you need to go to Rapid City, which is 90 miles away. Even then, Rapid City has only 1 neurosurgery group...

   Skylink Says:   The water in Kadoka tastes funny. It tastes like minerals. It have a chemical or gasoline taste as does water in a rest stop near Zanesville, Ohio (USA). If you are accustomed to a certain taste of water, consider bring your own bottled water to Kadoka.
