 Drunken SNES Gaming - WAR 2410! 
 Oct 2, 2010 2:28 PM 
And this is why I don&apos;t like Turn-Based Strategy. Well that&apos;s not true. I do like TBS games when the &apos;S&apos; is actually a key feature of the gameplay. But it&apos;s not here. Not at all. Then there are all the other problems: The AI is far superior for pretty much every unit attribute. The balance is non-existent. The fun factor is negative. The graphics suck ass. And the music is abhorrent. Overall, a really shitty way to end a night. A shitty night. Excuse me while I go and cook my head in the oven.

 The New York Yankees Road To #27 
 Jan 14, 2010 4:49 PM 
This is a slideshow of some of the best photos of the 2009 World Champion New York Yankees&apos; journey to their 27th all-time World Series victory... It includes a few pictures of the ALDS, ALCS and a lot of World Series celebrations. Originally, this was a video compiled with the best video highlights (A-Rod&apos;s game-tying shot in Game 2 of the ALDS, Izturis&apos; error, Mo&apos;s strikeout of Kendrick to win the pennant, Matsui&apos;s road to MVP, etc) but YouTube does not allow MLB videos. So, I changed them to pictures and added a song. The song used is called &quot;We Weren&apos;t Born to Follow&quot; by Bon Jovi. The die-hard Yankee fans like myself will definitely get goose bumps when hearing this song again -- it was always played on TBS before playoff games. PS, here is to all of the great Yankee fans who never quit on this team, even when the going was tough. I watched 173 games in 2009 and it was worth every minute. Some sleepless nights, some heartaches, but in the end, there is not a feeling in the world better than having a World Champions poster hanging up in your bedroom. This one&apos;s for you, boss! Hope you enjoy! I do not own the New York Yankees, the pictures used, or anything of that matter.

 Miami vs. Florida football 1987 - 1st Quarter 
 Jan 12, 2010 4:56 PM 
September 5, 1987 in the Orange Bowl, season opener for both teams. Miami was a 5.5 point favorite and won decisively, 31-4. Both Gator scores were punt snaps over Jeff Feagles&apos; head. This was the final meeting when the series was played annually from 1944-1987. The Gators dropped Miami months earlier to pursue a more aggressive schedule with major intersectional home and home matchups. This was Steve Walsh&apos;s debut as Miami&apos;s starting QB, opposing Florida&apos;s Kerwin Bell, who was touted for the Heisman entering 1987. Miami went unbeaten in 1987 to claim its second national championship, defeating Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Twelve players from this Canes team were drafted in 1988. Bob Neal was the play-by-play man and former Dolphin cornerback Tim Foley on color commentary. This game was on TBS, which was the first cable network to air college football games nationally, beginning in 1982. The network featured the SEC and there is a distinct pro-SEC slant in listening to the old tapes.

 Axis and Allies Russian/Soviet Theme Music (1998, Hasbro) (Fully Animated) 
 Sep 7, 2009 1:13 PM 
A video of the Russian Theme from the Hasbro version of Axis and Allies, based off the board game. Please ignore the bad plays if any in this video as I recorded the AI battling itself. Axis&amp;Allies is a 1998 turn-based strategy game closely based on the board game of the same name. Players take control of one five world powers at the start of 1942, grouped into the opposing factions of the Allies (USA, UK, and USSR) and the Axis (Germany and Japan). Victory conditions are set at the start of the game: Complete world domination, the capture of enemy capitals, or reaching a set level of economic power. The game is turn-based, with the USSR acting first, and the USA acting last. Each country&apos;s turn of the game is broken into several phases. First is the research phase, where IPCs (a representation of industrial power) can be gambled in an attempt to develop advanced technology, such as jet engines or rockets. The remaining IPCs are then used to buy troops in the purchase phase. Troops are then moved in the combat move phase, and battles resolved in the combat phase. Non-combative moves are then performed in the non-combat move phase, and the turns ends.

 Smooth moves with Stalin vs. Martians! 
 Mar 26, 2009 2:15 AM 
www.stalinvsmartians.com Following the avalanche of requests to see more of the gameplay in Stalin vs. Martians, Mezmer Games releases a new video with in-game footage that gives everyone some answers and shows that the game is not just one big spoof. This video also nullifies all the evil rumors (probably spread by the Martians) that the gameplay would be slow. The video features the retro-styled song &quot;All Hail Stalinator!&quot; by Ilya Orange and Space Detective. Ilya Orange is the author of the game&apos;s original score, including the now-famous tune from the first &quot;Dancing Stalin&quot; trailer. Also, you will see glimpses of the extensive fauna of different alien creatures that the Red Army will fight against. Finally, the video shows a teenage girl showing off some wicked dance moves, most likely inspired by the great (leader and dancer) Stalin. Stalin vs Martians is now available on all leading digital distribution portals including GamersGate, Direct2Drive, Steam and Impulse.

 Game-Station.info - Disciples 3: Renaissance 
 Dec 23, 2008 1:32 AM 
Game-Station.info presents: Disciples 3: Renaissance The struggle between the gods endures since still, showing no respite even since the times of creation of Nevendaar. Ruling over the fate of mere mortals their disciples, eager to follow their deities biddings, are inevitably rewarded with death on the battlefield, pawns in the implacable and merciless thirst for revenge and bloodshed. As the gods hatred of each other grows so do the number of graves spreading everywhere in the land while truces are broken without the shadow of a regret. The world is corrupted by ways of foul plots and the gods are ready for the most unspeakable, willing to sacrifice their creation, their lives a mere accessory to their schemes. Alas, there was a time when they loved their creatures. This time, three races clash anew The Empire, the Legions of the Damned and the Elves. Each of them different in nature, agenda and by their unique units, characteristics, skills and tactics. They face off through interwoven campaigns of linked quests and a rich storyline, first with the Empire who leads our path to the inhospitable lands of the Legions to witness the endgame over Elven grounds.
