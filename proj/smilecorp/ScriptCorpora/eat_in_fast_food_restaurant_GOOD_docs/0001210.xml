 Driven crazy by an Echo Park Mercedes 
 Dec 22, 2009 12:00 PM 
The windows have been smashed, part of the moldings have been stripped away and the red paint has faded in places. It would appear that the 1978 Mercedes Benz 300CD coupe parked near Logan Elementary School is one of those stolen vehicles found dumped on the streets of Echo Park. This car, however, is neither stolen or abandoned. It is the property of Humberto, an Echo Park DJ, who loves old Mercedes Benzes built before 1982. He has owned six Mercedes Benzes, including a nearly 40-year-old, powder blue 280SEL sedan that last week was parked across the street from the red coupe.

 Speed was a deadly factor in a fatal Echo Park accident 
 Nov 24, 2009 12:00 PM 
he car involved in Sunday&apos;s fatal accident in Echo Park was traveling nearly 70 miles an hour on Sunset Boulevard when the driver lost control of the vehicle, an investigator said today. The driver, Stephanie Silvestre, 21, of Los Angeles, was killed and a passenger was left in critical condition following the accident near Sunset Boulevard and Mohawk Street. &quot;Speed was the main issue,&quot; said Felix Padilla, an detective with the LAPD&apos;s Central Traffic Bureau.

 It&apos;s not easy being an Elysian Park snowman 
 Nov 23, 2009 12:00 PM 
Workers at Elysian Park today installed this year&apos;s batch of holiday snowmen and snowwoman - made from tumbleweeds spray-painted white - around the park. But there won&apos;t be a snowman at the corner of Stadium Way and Scott Avenue this year, said lead senior gardener John Salaisas.

 The million dollar neighbor next door 
 Nov 12, 2009 12:00 PM 
he hills surrounding the Silver Lake Reservoir feature some of the area&apos;s most stunning views - and real estate prices. Values remain far below their boom-year peaks, but nearly a dozen homes sold for a million dollars or more during a recent six month period in the 90039 Zip Code, with almost all of them in Silver Lake (Sorry, Atwater). A seven-figure sales prices might make other homeowners jealous but they often don&apos;t come easy.

 Echo Park-Silver Lake freeway project takes another detour 
 Nov 4, 2009 12:00 PM 
For more than a decade, Echo Park and Silver Lake residents, traffic engineers, consultants and political leaders have been working on a plan to rebuild the often jammed and chaotic southern tip of the 2 Freeway, which comes to an abrupt end at Glendale Boulevard. It looked like a resolution was finally at hand this summer when an official with the Metropolitan Transit Authority indicated support for a proposal created by residents, who want to squeeze out additional parkland and other public amenities from the project. But, at a meeting tonight, MTA officials will explain why the agency can&apos;t get behind the residents&apos; proposal and will need more time and money to study yet another idea to untangle what&apos;s officially called the State Route 2 Terminus. It&apos;s the most recent setback for a $12 million project that when completed still won&apos;t provide much relief for motorists stuck in traffic.
 Would you rather be in the pink in Highland Park or prefer an Echo Park green house?

 Say a prayer for Arthur 
 Oct 25, 2009 12:00 PM 
The Eastsider ran a post in July about the death of 61-year-old Arthur Cisneros, who was often seen hanging out, as well as drinking, near an Echo Park mini mall. His large suitcase on wheels was usually parked nearby. An Echo Park resident named Jennifer had befriended Cisneros and had tried to find his family after he was admitted to St. Vincent&apos;s Medical Center, where Cisneros died on July 24. Jennifer encountered several other persons who had gotten to know Cisneros over the years, and his family was eventually tracked down. On Tuesday morning, St. Vincent&apos;s will hold a memorial mass for Cisneros and other patients who have died at the hospital in the past three month, said Jennifer in an email. She said anyone who knew Cisneros is welcome:

 It&apos;s time for an old Echo Park store to change once again 
 Oct 21, 2009 12:00 PM 
When the Stone family opened up their Echo Park furniture store in the 1940s, most of the clientele was Jewish. By the 1960s, however, Latinos has begun to patronize the large Stone Bros. outlet on Sunset Boulevard in ever growing numbers. In the 1990s, Stone Bros. changed its name to La Popular, a familiar store name to Los Angeles&apos; Latino immigrants, as the Stones chased after the Spanish-speaking consumer. Today, Neil Stone, the third generation of his family to operate the store, is managing the business through yet another transformation. Not only has business withered as a result of the recession, many of the Latino customers the store had come to depend on have moved away as Echo Park and surrounding neighborhoods have gentrified, Stone said. The store has changed its merchandise - carrying low-budget versions of Pottery Barn-style sofas and tables - to appeal to the tastes of new residents. Stone said he might even drop the La Popular brand and revive the Stone Bros. name. &quot;Echo Park is changing,&quot; said Stone. &quot;I&apos;m trying to change with it.&quot;

 City plans campaign to stop Echo Park Sunday swap meet 
 Oct 19, 2009 12:00 PM 
The Eastsider reported on Friday that the city is planning a more aggressive effort to halt what&apos;s become a popular Sunday afternoon swap meet around Echo Park Lake, where vendors sell everything from sweaters to sinks as the video above shows. The effort is being organized by the office of Councilman Eric Garcetti. Council office spokeswoman Julie Wong provided a few more details about the problem and what&apos;s in the works.

 A Boyle Heights block grows more crowded with vendors - and tension 
 Oct 7, 2009 12:00 PM 
It was after 10 a.m. on a recent Saturday, and street vendor Martha Nuñez Marin wanted to make sure she got a choice spot near the busy intersection of Cesar E. Chavez Avenue and Soto Street. When she got to the space - a strip of sidewalk in front of Payless Shoe Source and a bus stop - she parked her shopping cart, brimming with bags of potato chips, green, white and red Mexican coconut bars and peanut and caramel patties. Nearly everyday, she and other illegal street vendors vie for this prime piece of sidewalk real estate, which produces lots of foot traffic from shoppers and bus riders. But when Nuñez Marin, 53, began to sell her snacks eight months ago, two vendors who sell similar snacks confronted her with anger.

 A new school prepares to hop into Playboy&apos;s Glassell Park playground 
 Oct 5, 2009 12:00 PM 
The thought of Hugh Hefner arriving with Miss October for a Show-and-Tell session with a bunch of second graders might unsettle more than a few parents. That&apos;s why officials with the Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts were concerned when they discovered that the Glassell Park office complex they were considering for a new campus was also home to Playboy Enterprises. &quot;Of course the red flags went up,&quot; said Kevin Mulcahy, an architect who is working with the charter school on their new home. That set off a closer look at the school site and Playboy&apos;s dumpsters.

 Silver Lake won&apos;t be the same without its favorite banker 
 Sep 30, 2009 12:00 PM 
It was hard for many people in Silver Lake to think of Marisa Bernal as just a banker. She was a part of their community - active in the chamber of commerce, neighborhood clean ups and art shows. She was also a friend, someone clients invited to family birthday parties as well as funerals. And, in a role unique for a bank vice president, Bernal was named the Honorary Queen of the Silver Lake Beauty Pageant in 2003, the same year the judges included Anna Nicole Smith and Councilman Tom LaBonge. But in May, Bernal was abruptly dismissed as manager of the Citibank branch in Silver Lake, where she had worked on and off for more than 25 years under different corporate owners. Bernal was told she was being let go without severance for &quot;unsatisfactory work performance.&quot; But Bernal&apos;s loyal Silver Lake clients don&apos;t believe that and have organized a campaign - which, of course, includes a YouTube video - to get her job back.

 Dear Eastsider: What&apos;s the deal with Acorn, Gary Leonard&amp;Shepard Fairey? 
 Sep 16, 2009 12:00 PM 
The Eastsider is not going to touch this one. The question comes from A Friend of The Eastsider who recently snapped this photo of photographer Gary Leonard taking a photo of a sign painted on those easy-to-clean walls of artist Shepard Fairey&apos;s Echo Park studio. The sign reads &quot;Acorn Funded Prostitution Zone.&quot; Since Fairey is not likely to respond to any questions, all theories are welcome.

 Transgender residents team up with LAPD on East Hollywood murder investigation 
 Sep 15, 2009 12:00 PM 
he LAPD Rampart Division is searching for a man they believe might have information related to the August 28 killing of Paulina Ibarra, a transgendered person, who was stabbed to death in her East Hollywood apartment. Police are seeking help from the public in looking for Jesus Catalan (pictured). Catalan, a parolee-at-large, is not a suspect in the case but a person of interest that detectives would like to question about the killing on the 900 block of North Mariposa Avenue. Catalan, who is probably homeless, frequents East Hollywood and the Rampart District.

 Has Silver Lake made the A List? 
 Sep 15, 2009 12:00 PM 
Their body guards wait while they finish dinner at Sunset Boulevard restaurants, and the paparazzi stalk them at the Silver Lake Boulevard 7-Eleven. The Hollywood Celebrity set appears to be migrating east, making Silver Lake a popular destination. The neighborhood has long been a hangout and home to artists, actors and musicians. But hardly any of them would ever appear on the cover, or at least mentioned inside, People magazine - until now.

 Echo Park and Silver Lake targeted for citrus pest treatment 
 Sep 4, 2009 12:00 PM 
The state will start spraying citrus trees across a large section of Echo Park and Silver Lake next week as part of an effort to kill the Asian citrus psyllid that threatens the state&apos;s valuable citrus crop. Insecticides will be sprayed on citrus trees and injected into the ground at selected properties beginning September 11, according to a notice distributed by the state&apos;s Department of Food and Agriculture.

 A father and son who grew up at East Los Angeles College 
 Aug 30, 2009 12:00 PM 
Louis C. Lopez tended the grounds and worked other jobs at East Los Angeles College for more than 20 years. When he died in 1985, Lopez left behind some photos of the school to his son, David, who made copies available to The Eastsider. The top photo, which looks to the west, shows the new campus in the midst of equally new post-war housing tracts and shopping centers. That&apos;s Atlantic Boulevard in the foreground and the college football stadium sits near the top. The 1967 image below shows a much more heavily developed community and campus, which was eventually annexed into neighboring Monterey Park.
 The Burrito King and a bud man battle over a Silver Lake pot clinic 
 Aug 26, 2009 12:00 PM 
The simple task of ordering a machaca burrito at the Burrito King in Silver Lake has become a bit more complicated in recent weeks since the boycott, protests and arrests began. Patrons have had to navigate past a small group of protesters lined up on the narrow sidewalk chanting &quot;Boycott Burrito King&quot; through bullhorns as others wave signs reading &quot;THUG RUN BUSINESS.&quot; The scene on Hyperion Avenue has been been repeated numerous times since early June after a months-long feud between Julian Montoya, the 71-year-old burrito stand entrepreneur, and Patrick Duff, the 33-year-old owner of a medical marijuana business, spilled into public view.

 Shepard Fairey tags The Eastsider as &quot;obnoxious&quot; 
 Aug 14, 2009 6 PM 
The Eastsider posted a story earlier this week about artist Shepard Fairey protecting his Echo Park studio and office building from taggers and vandals a few weeks after he plead guilty to vandalism charges for his street art tactics. He is obviously not pleased with the story and wanted an opportunity to respond

 This is one wall Shepard Fairey wants to keep free of expression 
 Aug 10, 2009 12:00 PM 
After pleading guilty to vandalism charges in Boston over his guerrilla art tactics, artist Shepard Fairey had to deal with acts of vandalism closer to home. A few days ago workers sandblasted the brick exterior of his Echo Park studio, gallery and ad agency - called Studio Number One - and applied a shiny layer of anti-graffiti coating to the walls. Frequent tagging and graffiti had apparently taken a toll on the Sunset Boulevard building and Fairey, who rose to fame by employing the same hit-and-run tactics of graffiti artists and taggers.

 How the ungayest mall of all came to host a gay pride event 
 Aug 5, 2009 12:00 PM 
The Eagle Rock Plaza, a charmless box featuring a giant Chucky E. Cheese sign, could never be confused as a center for gay culture. But, on Saturday, this family-friendly mall , whose most flashiest tenants include a two-story Target and a Filipino fast-food restaurant called Jolilbee, will host the first-ever Northeast Los Angeles Pride, a gay pride event organized by the Uptown Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

 A big blue barrier comes between a Mt. Washington parent and her neighborhood school 
 Jul 28, 2009 12:00 PM 
t was not uncommon on school days for the front doors of Mt. Washington Elementary to be swung wide open, a welcoming symbol for kids as well as neighbors of this hillside neighborhood. But when the school reopens after the summer break, students won&apos;t be greeted by those open doors. Instead, they will encounter a big wrought iron gate that was installed a few weeks ago for reasons that have mystified and angered some residents and neighbors.

 Echo Park family goes gray as part of its green project 
 Jul 21, 2009 12:00 PM 
The city&apos;s restrictions on water use had Steven Amato and Maria Galante worried about how they were going to keep their large Echo Park garden, planted with everything from tomatoes and herbs to fig and lemon trees, green and lush. After some research into water conservation and some shopping, the couple created a low-tech system to collect so-called &quot;gray water&quot; from washing their dishes as well as bathing their young sons. The gray water is then used to irrigate their garden.

 The Echo Park Vons is getting a new lifestyle 
 Jul 17, 2009 
The Vons in Echo Park has always seemed out of place, a 1960s-era suburban supermarket surrounded by a mostly empty parking lot, caravans of RVs occupied by homeless people and flaming taco trucks. It seemed as if the owners of Vons, a division of Safeway Corp., had lost track of this urban outpost in their giant supermarket empire. How else to explain why this &quot;Marina-style&quot; store, beloved by architecture fans for its sweeping parabolic roof, had never been remodeled even as nearly every other Vons nearby has been supersized or postmodernized. Many Echo Park residents have long complained about the dingy and tree-less parking lot, crusty shopping carts and locked-up wine and liquor cabinets. It has been derided as a &quot;ghetto&quot; Vons by some shoppers and, by at least one employee, as the &quot;7-Eleven&quot; Vons because of its small size. Well, change is finally coming to the Vons at Alvarado and Montana.

 The Silver Lake Walking Man takes a trip through historic L.A. 
 Jul 9, 2009 12:00 PM 
Anyone who has lived in Silver Lake for a while has probably seen the eternally tanned and shirtless Dr. Marc Abrams walking briskly through the neighborhood, head down while reading a folded newspaper. But what is Abrams, aka The Silver Lake Walking Man, doing strolling by the Brown Derby restaurant or through a pack of Victorian-era policemen riding bikes downtown? You will have to ask Silver Lake resident Nicky Gagliarducci. His new Sunset Boulevard mural combines images of Abrams walking from west to east across the landscape and past the landmarks of historic Los Angeles.

 What does a young El Sereno native do after running for Congress? 
 Jul 1, 2009 12:00 PM 
Emanuel Pleitez , a 26-year-old El Sereno native, was never expected to win the race to replace Hilda Solis as representative for the 32nd Congressional District. In his first election, Pleitez came in behind fellow Democrats State Sen. Gill Cedillo and former assembly woman Judy Chu in the May 19 race. Chu emerged victorious but still faces a runoff in July that she is expected to win.

 Old homies pay tribute to handball, history&amp;a woman named Michi 
 Jun 29, 2009 12:00 PM 
On Saturday morning, over steaming bowls of menudo served in Styrofoam bowls, the members of the Southern California Old Timers gathered within the brick walls of the Maravilla Handball Court in East Los Angeles. This group of mostly older, former prisoners and veteranos from barrios across Southern California had come here not only to attend their 20th Annual Menudo Breakfast. They were also here as part of an effort to preserve the handball court, built in the early 1920s, and to honor its history and the memory of Michi Nishiyama and her husband, Tommy Shigeru, the Japanese-American couple who ran the place and the adjacent grocery store for decades.

 Dear Eastsider: What&apos;s up with the stealth chopper?

Kevin from Angeleno Heights reports seeing a helicopter flying over Echo Park at night without any lights. He spotted and heard it last week and again last night at about 9 pm dashing over Elysian Park.

 When comments get out of control 
 Jun 22, 2009 12:00 PM 
It&apos;s always refreshing to discover a reader who has no qualms about using their full name in a comment or a story. That was the case on Friday when The Eastsider posted a request from an Echo Park resident who was curious about all the gang tagging in the Memorial Grove section of Elysian Park. Well, today, Beth in an email asked that her full name be withdrawn after she received an unsettling phone call at home. Not from a gang member. But from a neighbor.

 Playing games with Dodger fans 
 Jun 17, 2009 12:00 PM 
The neighbors of Dodger Stadium frustrated over game-day traffic and a lack of parking are trying a new strategy to deal with the hordes of baseball fans: Fool them. Or, at least try. In Solano Canyon, just east of the stadium, new white and red signs reading &quot;Resident Parking Only&quot; have been posted along Academy Road and Solano Avenue. Echo Park residents on the other side of the stadium want them, too. The problem is the signs are fake, printed up and posted by residents themselves.* &quot;We are seeking some relief,&quot; said one resident.

 Do taco trucks crime as well as carne asada lovers? 
 Jun 10, 2009 12:00 PM 
The Friday night fire that hit the popular Taco Zone truck parked perpetually outside the Echo Park Vons market on Alvarado Street has raised worries about taco truck crime. There has been some speculation that the truck was firebombed either by rivals or a gang upset about non payment of protection money. At this point, however, officials don&apos;t know for sure what happened. The LAPD has referred the matter to arson investigators at the fire department.

 A Chavez Ravine family&apos;s costly lesson in geology 
 Jun 4, 2009 12:00 PM 
What does the Farina family of Chavez Ravine have in common with the Clampetts of Beverly Hills? The Farinas, like that fictional TV clan, have an oil well on their property. However, in the Farina&apos;s case, the discovery of the well has not been a source of over-night wealth. Instead, the long abandoned well, one of hundreds located northwest of downtown Los Angeles, is going to cost the couple at least $30,000 to plug up to modern standards. &quot;My husband&apos;s big question is: &apos;Why us?&apos;&quot; said Mary Farina.

 At home in a Lakers-style bungalow

In case you didn&apos;t notice the year-around gold-and-purple paint on this Echo Park bungalow, the banner hanging from the front porch leaves no doubt these Alvarado Street residents are Lakers fans.

 Foreclosure ends a Victorian dream in Angelino Heights 
 May 20, 2009 12:00 PM 
The Libby House is one of those head-turning Angeleno Heights Victorian gems, painted in shades of pistachio, trimmed with frilly wood work and topped by peaked roofs and a turret. But perhaps the most prominent feature of the 122-year-old house on East Edgeware Road these days is the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign out front and the Sheriff&apos;s &quot;Notice to Vacate&quot; sign taped to a window. These are signs of not only another foreclosure but of the loss of a prominent Angeleno Heights resident and preservationist who was forced to move out of the house and neighborhood she loved and lived in for more than 30 years.

 Where did all the Belmont High students go? 
 May 18, 2009 12:00 PM 
When the school bells rang and classroom doors popped open, the hallways at Belmont Senior High School just south of Echo Park would turn chaotic and claustrophobic as thousands of students stampeded to get to the next class. &quot;It was literally like trying to move around a New York subway, &quot; said Don Redifer, dean of students, recalling the scene repeated several times a day. &quot;It was shoulder to shoulder.&quot; But this year the hallways at the 87-year-old campus, while still busy, are no where nearly as crowded as Belmont High has gone from one of Los Angeles&apos; largest high schools to one of its smallest.

 Elysian Park blazes have everyone on fire watch 
 May 12, 2009 12:00 PM 
The mattress-sized patch of scorched grass partially hidden underneath the branch of an Elysian Park eucalyptus tree would not have normally attracted much notice. But, in light of Saturday night&apos;s suspicious three-acre blaze on the northern edge of the park, the blackened spot alongside a park road off Scott Avenue drew the worried look of an Echo Park resident who lives nearby. &quot;It makes me even more nervous,&quot; she said of the fire danger.

 The mass appeal of the Eagle Rock Target 
 Apr 30, 2009 12:00 PM 
For many years, the Eagle Rock Target has seemed to live in the shadow of its more swanky Pasadena counterpart a few miles east on Colorado Boulevard. While the Pasadena store is housed in the sleek, mid-century remains of a Robinson&apos;s department store, the no-nonsense Eagle Rock store is attached to the 1970s-era hulk that is the Eagle Rock Plaza. But the Eagle Rock Target has its fans on Yelp! who sing the praises not only of its cart-o-lator but of Eastside people watching:

 The pole patrol of Silver Lake strikes again 
 Apr 29, 2009 12:00 PM 
It&apos;s a quiet morning at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Maltman Avenue in Silver Lake except for the roar of traffic and the sound of paper being ripped off utility poles. Bright yellow posters promoting a &quot;Buy Local&quot; sale; black&amp;white photocopied flyers for a concert at The Echo; a faded &quot;Garage Sale&quot; sign handwritten in marker - all of them get ripped down by a thin Silver Lake woman as she walks down the block. She wants to remain anonymous, most likely because she wants to spare her husband the embarrassment, about her years long obsession to keep the signal and telephone poles - as well as the newsstands and mailboxes- free of illegal signs and stickers. &quot;Look at that poor pole,&quot; she said of one poster and staple encrusted pole near Millie&apos;s Cafe.

The sidewalks of Echo Park often sprout temporary alters of votive candles, flowers, hand-written notes and photos to mark the spot of a fatal gang shooting or accident. But the temporary tribute to honor Jesus-Renteria Castillo, who was killed by a motorist last Sunday while riding his bike on Glendale Boulevard, will take the form of an old bicycle painted white, a Ghost Bike.

 When dog owners attack 
 Apr 14, 2009 12:00 PM 
It&apos;s not unusual for dogs to snap and snarl at each other in the dog haven that is Elysian Park. The morning, however, it was two dog owners that went at each other in an exchange that involved rock throwing and a smack to the face. Here&apos;s what happened as described by an Echo Park neighbor named Mariel who was walking her two dogs, Beastie and Bella, on an Elysian Park fire road:

 Why the killing of two Highland Park teenagers is not news worth following 
 Apr 3, 2009 12:00 PM 
The shooting deaths of two Highland Park teenagers last month left junior high school principal John Samaniego, whose campus is located near the shooting, eager to get more news about what happened. But, with the exception of a brief burst of coverage on the Friday afternoon and evening of the killings, Samaniego waited in vain for more news to appear. &quot;That&apos;s what kind of bothered me,&quot; Samaniego said a few days after the killings.

 Baxter Street bus stop 
 Mar 30, 2009 12:00 PM 
Echo Park resident Ingrid Peterson was headed over to this month&apos;s Fargo Street Hill Climb when she came across this school bus stuck at the top of the hill where steep Baxter Street crosses Alvarado Street. &quot;Honestly I have no idea what possessed that driver to take it up Baxter in the first place.&quot;

 Has the last order been served at Pioneer Chicken? 
 Mar 23, 2009 12:00 PM 
The deep fat fryers have stopped gurgling and the Orange Bang has stopped flowing at the Pioneer Chicken in Echo Park. It looks the long-time neighborhood restaurant, officially known as Pioneer Take Out, and an oily piece of Los Angeles fast food-history has closed after nearly 40 years of business (though some say the restaurant dates back nearly 50 years).

 Presidential parking at Dodger Stadium 
 Mar 19, 2009 12:00 PM 
Helicopters believed to be carrying President Obama and others in his entourage were seen landing this afternoon in the Dodger stadium parking lot during his Los Angeles area visit. Echo Park resident Mary-Austin Klein. 
Of course, from her vantage point, all Klein could see was a procession of dots moving across the parking lot. &quot;I got kind of emotional,&quot; said Klein. &quot;I knew one of those dots was Obama.&quot;

 A walk down Figueroa turns deadly for two Highland Park teens 
 Mar 17, 2009 12:00 PM 
Carlos Hernandez would have turned 16 yesterday but but there was no celebration for the Highland Park teenager. Instead, there was only grief and many unanswered questions as to why Hernandez and friend Alejandro Garcia, 16, were gunned down on Figueroa Street on Friday afternoon. Police found the two Franklin High School teens bleeding on the sidewalk shortly after 3:30 p.m. in front of a small park near the Highland Park Recreation Center and the river rock walls of the Arroyo Seco Library. They died from their wounds at a hospital.

 Are you ready for loft-living at the old Lincoln Heights jail? 
 Mar 10, 2009 12:00 PM 
You can already hear the real estate agents talk up the condo&apos;s simple lines (those would be prison bars) and the wine cellar in the basement (isn&apos;t that a drunk tank?). But if people can live in renovated grain silos and above the Americana at Brand, why not the old Lincoln Heights Jail?

 Do you feel safe or sorry now that Eric Zamarripa is gone from Echo Park? 
 Mar 2, 2009 12:00 PM 
When rumors spread Sunday night that Eric Zamarripa had been gunned down at his Echo Park home, there was shock, anguish as well as relief. This was, after all, a man considered by many to be one of the leaders of the Echo Park gang who had terrorized the neighborhood for years and threw rowdy parties at his home on Baxter Street. But this being Echo Park, where ExP gang members and hangers-on are also neighbors who attend PTA meetings and exchange polite greetings as you pump gas, many of the same residents who feared and loathed 38-year-old Zamarripa also knew another side of him.

 Porn again 
 Feb 27, 2009 12:00 PM 
Trash day came this Wednesday and Echo Park resident Gloria Sohacki was finally able to use her blue recycling bin for the first time in three weeks. As you may recall from previous stories in The Eastsider as well as by the LA Times&apos; Steve Lopez, someone had dumped hundreds of copies of Cybersocket, a soft-porn Gay magazine, in Sohacki&apos;s recycling can, making it too heavy for her as well as sanitation crews to move. The magazine eventually fired the distributor thought responsible for the dumping and emptied out Sohacki&apos;s blue bin last Friday.

Sohacki thought she would never again see another copy of Cybersocket. But then she returned home from exercise class this morning and noticed the sidewalk littered with plastic twine used to strap things together - like bundles of magazines.
