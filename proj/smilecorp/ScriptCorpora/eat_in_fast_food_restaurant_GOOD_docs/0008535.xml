 Review: My family and I recently came into Boundary House for a nice relaxing dinner. We had never been there before and decided to try something new. It was amazing! I got the blackened scallops and they were not only huge but tasted great. Carmen was, by far, one of the best servers weve had in the area and didnt make us want for anything. She was also very helpful when my mother asked about gluten free menu options. Which we appreciated because some servers act as if its a burden. Even the gentleman that brought our food asked if we needed anything before he left our table even though we could see they were very busy. We will absolutly be back soon and will be telling everyone about this place!!

 Review: I love the Boundary House, the ribs are the best ribs I have ever had they were fall of the bone delicious the service was outstanding great waiting staff. Atmosphere really reminds me of Carolina Roadhouse we got in and they seated us instantly. And the noise was perfect. Great Restaurant I would recommend this to everyone that visits Calabash.

 Review: We are still raving about The Boundry. We were seated quickly, the food we ordered was amazing and the service was outstanding. Our waiter Luke went well beyond making our meal enjoyable he knew what we needed before we did. We have been telling everyone about The Boundry. Our family now has a new beach tradition as I&apos;m sure the friends we have told will as well. Thank you for such a memorable meal and equally memorable service. We will see The Boundry again soon.

 Review: Have eaten at The Boundary numerous times and always been pleased until the last two times. (1 week apart) The server was terrible in both visits (2 different servers). The last time, she didn&apos;t check back, never asked if I wanted a refill of tea until she brought the bill and was generally less than enthusiastic about her job. Name was Pam. The second bite into the salad found a somewhat large piece of rotten lettuce. We notified the server. All she said was I&apos;m sorry. Should have been taken off the bill.

 Review: Very disappointed with our last visit on April 11 my husband&apos;s birthday.Waitress quoted 4 fish specials at the same price that day.We chose 2 of them grouper and haddock.Our bill for the grouper was $9.00 more than the haddock.She said she was sorry and after talking to the manager he smiled and said he was sorry.There was a lack of communication with our server that night.We have been to your restaurant many times and this was indeed our worst experience ever!!!!!!!!!!

 Review: Ate here with friends while in Myrtle Beach for an off-season golf trip. At the chef&apos;s recommendation we tried the blackened scallops appetizer. Delicious doesn&apos;t begin to describe the flavor. These were quite simply the best scallops I have ever tasted. $10 for six, but well worth it.

For an entree I had the parmesan crusted salmon w/pesto. I too had an excellent flavor, but the pesto, while tasty, overwhelmed the salmon just a bit. Still though, it was a very good dish. Others in the party were equally impressed. It was early in the evening and it was the off-season so we didn&apos;t have to wait at all. The service was about what you would expect, not 5-star but also no complaints. The place was spotless and the atmosphere was good, I will definitely go back.

 Review: Ate here 11/14/10. Food was OK but service was very bad. Server Pamela was unenthusiastic from the start and very slow to collect payment. We had to wait over 15 minutes for her to get drinks and take food orders for a bigger table before taking our payment. 

Once Pamela took our payment we were told they do not accept VISA GIFTCARDS and she was unapologetic. Had to ask for a manager who told us they have trouble getting paid from VISA GIFTCARDS. Not my problem since they accept VISA as payment. I had to ask for the General Manager who finally processed the VISA GIFTCARD. It took over 30 minutes for the entire payment process and the restaurant was far below half capacity. So much for Southern hospitality.

 Review: Off Season visit in late Sept. was very pleasant. Food above average (beach area foods off season can be marginally ok - especially for how much they think it is worth).
Would return and look forward to that visit.

 Review: My husband and are new to the area, just moving here from NYS. We stopped in to The Boundary House for lunch one day. Wow, very nice place. The staff could not have been any nicer. The amount of food we got for the price was unbelievable. To top it off, it was delicious. The house salad, was just great. I was shocked when I saw it. Up north the house salad is lettuce, and one piece of tomato, and cucumber, maybe a slice of onion if you&apos;re lucky. Seriously, couldn&apos;t believe how good everything was. We usually never order desert, but this day it was raining very hard and felt we needed to order more to sit there, so we ordered the &quot;mini&quot; desserts. I thought it was a great idea for the price had to be just a taste. Well, again, I was shocked at the size of the mini desserts. Also, delicious. 
For the price, the food is fantastic. Looking forward to trying dinner. 
Yes, the set up of the restaurant makes for a noise, but if you&apos;re going out for a private romantic dinner maybe this might not be the place, but for a good meal and fun, I think it&apos;s great. You can just be yourself and have a wonderful meal.

 Review: We were told to go try the Boundary House for dinner. We were so thrilled with the quality and value, we went back with some friends the next night while on vacation in Sunset Beach. Our friends had gone to one of the &quot;other&quot; Calabash seafood restaurants and were very disappointed in the seafood. The one friend said he would never eat there again. We visit Sunset every year and have a few restaurants that we HAVE to eat at while there. The Boundary House is now on the list!

 Review: Had reservations for 4, arrived an hour early to enjoy our friends at the bar. About 10 minutes after our reservation time, we inquired when we would be seated. Hostess responded she had no idea. We paid our tab and left. Don&apos;t have any idea how the food, service or value are. Went to the Grapevine without reservations. They were full, but owner made a place for us in a matter of minutes. Will not go back to BH. It&apos;s always Grapevine for us!

 Review: Don&apos;t let the above ratings fool you, I&apos;ve been to this place twice in the past year while on vacation and have had an excellent time on both instances. Even though the place is a bit commercial for Calabash, it probably has the best tasting food in the area. The service is always excellent, and the bar is always stocked!! The only downside is it is a bit more expensive than the other restaurants in Calabash, but you can&apos;t complain for a restaurant of this caliber, especially when they bring you such large portions! Also, during the summer, expect to wait if you get there in between 5 and 8. I will always try to get back here everytime I&apos;m on vacation.

 Review: My husband and I have stayed in the Calabash area for a number of weeks each year since 2006 and we have never disappointed with our visits to The Boundary House. We feel that it &apos;beats&apos; anything in the Myrtle Beach vicinity in price and quality for the price we pay. 

My husband&apos;s favourite item on the menu is the potato soup and I enjoy the house salad in particular but we try out different items on the menu. We come from Nova Scotia so we eat along the way as we drive to the Carolinas and we have an opportunity to eat at various restaurants. Too bad there is not a franchise of The Boundary House!

Regarding the problem some folks have with getting a seat ... we&apos;ve never had a problem. It is probably because we come in February/March when there are not as many tourists.

 Review: we have enjoyed the food for many years. It is a bit expensive, however if the food is very good, it is worth it. I like the prime rib sandwich and my wife enjoys the po boy sandwiches. But most important, you have no smoking in your restaurant. What a novel idea. I hope soon every place of business in both north and south carolina will be smoke free. r.j. Sell little river.

 Review: I have been eating at the Boundry House now for almost 3 years I remember when they first opened I order chicken with alfredo and hated the alfredo sauce. One year later I went back with a group of people and had a great dinner and i have been going back ever since. Being from the area I now eat there once a week sometimes more the house salads are awsome They have the best babyback ribs I have ever had. they also have some of the best ny style cheescake and excellent service. Lunch there is also great and the price is certainly right. Check this place out I gaurentee you you will not be dissapointed!!

 Review: Its true that there is a occasional wait for seating at the Boundary House but that is a good reflection of the popularity and quality of this establishment. We are local and patronize this restaurant quite often. Its always on the list to bring visitors here and none of them have even been disappointed.

Great house salad makes a fine starter and everything we&apos;ve tried from burgers to full entrees has been enjoyable.

 Review: They could at least have fresh seafood. 
Six fried shrimp on my plate and a one fried crab cake that was perfectly round and filled with something.( not crab ). Dry and hard hush puppies. Perfectly round. All for a higher price. This is not about money. It&apos;s about a restaurant that is out of step with traditional Calabash. New and fancy is great but a poor value for the money is not. 
However they had a great caesar salad. After the meal I realized I had wasted my money. I want be back.

 Review: We read reviews before heading to this restaurant for lunch. Prepared to be in awe of the food. Just didn&apos;t happen for us. The shrimp quesadilla had about 6-8 tiny shrimp and heavy cheese. Supposed to have spicy shrimp, jalopenos&amp;scallions. The shrimp was bland, small, and no jalopenos. We didn&apos;t read the full menu description till later that day and it didn&apos;t describe what we ate. The place is beautiful, the service is excellent, immediate seating at lunch about 12:00 pm. Very clean! All of that is a plus. Maybe dinner is better. We probably wouldn&apos;t go again.

 Review: A co-worker suggested the Boundry House. I was excited until I read other reviews, but took a chance. I called at noon and asked about available seatings between 5:30 and 7PM. Was told 5:45 was good. We arrived at 5:35 and were immediately seated. Within two minutes, Caleb brought lemon water and took our wine order. Croissants were wonderful, we skipped dessert and got an extra order of Croissants to go, so our travel mates could enjoy for the next breakfast.

Salad was very good. Nice mix of greens and protien, nuts, bacon, etc. Entree&apos;s were wonderul. Service was effecient and subtile high tech. Servers were all electronically connected. Very friendly staff. One server though my partner and I were twins, she saw us seated not standing to see the difference, we got a laugh.

Next year our whole group (14) will be making the trek for a wonderful dinner.

 Review: Came at 6:10 PM on a Thursday, was quoted 60 - 90 minutes. After 45, checked at station and was told a bar table was available now. We took it, and they crammed 8 people onto 3 small 2 ft x 2ft cocktail tables. Waitress must have been responsible for the whole bar area because we rarely saw her. We felt shoe-horned into a tiny table in a corner. Service was poor. 

When the foor came, it was very good and of decent portions for the money. The only exceptions seemed to be shrimp. We tried the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer, which was a poor attempt to copy Bonefish Grill&apos;s Bang-Bang Shrimp. Was a smaller portion than Bonefish, and at a higher price. Was also not as good. On the Shrimp Po-Boy there were not enough shrimp. Crab cakes were huge and good, as was most everything else. The croissants were the thing to get, order a few baskets for your table.

If you go, make reservations 2 days in advance, or forget it. I called Thursday at 3 PM and was told they only accept reservations for 1/3 of the seating and that they were full for Thursday and Friday. We went anyway and the wait was horrendous. They cramp WAY too many people into too small a place and don&apos;t provide enough help to properly service them. You feel like you&apos;re eating on top of other people. They have plenty of land around and should expand this restaurant and hire more staff.

 Review: After a full week of eating absolutely terrible, nasty, expensive food all throughout myrtle beach, this place was outstanding!!!! they told us the wait would be 1 1/2 hours - i had heard it was worth the wait, so we did - waited 35 minutes, shopping in the nearby giftshop, which is awesome too - the pina caloda was awesome, the salad and crossiant was great - almost ordered another one - then the crab cakes were great!!! topped off with creme brulee cheesecake, and we couldn&apos;t ask for more - then the check came; didn&apos;t pay as much as we had all week for the nastiest food i&apos;ve ever imagined, served in various locations throughout myrtle beach.

 Review: I went here with my parents on vacation. the best thing we had were the crossiants. First they advertised they had a &quot;flat iron steak&quot; ,at the restaurant they didnt have it. I had to get a sirloin. My dad got oysters rockafeller and the oysters were in little pieces. I ordered my steak medium and it was well done. My mom got a filet mignoin and her&apos;s was the only cooked right. My dad got a New York Strip Pittsburgh style and it was 99 miles away from Pittsburgh. Also it was too thick to be a New York Strip. All of that was $$$$. Waste of money.

 Review: This is the best restaurant we tried in Calabash. I had the blackened scallops. The portion was large and they were cooked to perfection. The price was appropriate for the portion size and quality. The others in our party all had perfectly cooked meals as they were ordered and served in a timely manner. Our wait to be seated was about 45 minutes at 6:30. This was the time quoted to us at the door to the minute. There is lots of comfortable seating while you wait. Our party of 8 was seated together as requested. We will eat here again and again.

 Review: This place was just OK, i was expecting it to be a bit better. There was a bit of a wait before we were seated so if you can make reservations i would make them. I ordered tuna steak and I asked my food to be cooked w/ no oil or butter on my veggies and sure enough it was brought out slathered in oil. I didn&apos;t make a fuss but I would have appreciated it if my waitress actually listened to what I wanted.

 Review: This restaurant is terrific if your going to eat in calabash. This is the place to try! The potato soup is to die for! The crab cake was delicious, the fries were very good&amp;the blackened maui maui is the absolute best ever! Great salads. There were 8 people in our party we only waited about 30 min to eat. The place is packed so we were a little crowded at our table but we accepted the booth so we did not have to wait any longer but the place is worth an hour wait. One of our favorite restaurants of the week.

 Review: The scallops are to die for. I got them blackened and they were the best I&apos;ve had. The portions are huge and it came with a large salad and a side also. Our server was very helpful with ordering as it was our first visit and it surely will NOT be our last. Truly great food. My husband had the shrimp and they were large(unlike most Calabash shrimp) I found a new favorite restaurant and would surely recommend it to anyone. Can&apos;t wait to go back and get those scallops again.

 Review: This restaurant is the BEST between Myrtle Beach and Ocean Isle Beach. The service is superb, the staff is friendly and efficient and the food is excellent. My husband, who rarely eats a salad absolutely loved the house salad and dressing. I highly recommend it. It also comes with honey glazed croissants which are yummy. I was so full that I did not have room for dessert, but next time I will try something and take it home if I have too. The person who gave a bad review must have been a manager at a fast food restaurant, because he definitely does not know good food and service if he rated this restaurant poorly. This restaurant is the best and I will definitely go back SEVERAL times my next visit to Ocean Isle Beach.

 Review: This review is long past overdue. We hosted our son&apos;s rehearsal dinner here for 38 guests back in October. The manager, Crystal, was wonderful to work with ahead of time. We had several prices ranges to choose from and they even changed their menu choices to accommodate us. When our large group arrived we were seated right away. We had two waitresses, Sam&amp;Cheryl, who worked quickly to take care of everyone&apos;s needs. The food was wonderful and served in a timely manner for such a large group. Crystal, who we didn&apos;t see until we were ready to leave, was working in the kitchen to make sure that everything was just right! The Hurricane Chicken was wonderful. The service was outstanding. We would highly recommend the Boundary House. If we ever make it back to Calabash from Iowa, it will definitively be one of our stops!

 Review: This was a lunchtime visit so we had sanwiches. My husband had a hamburger with blue cheese added. He would have liked more cheese and the waitress offered it but he was all ready eating so he passed. It came with crisp fries and a lot of them. I had the lunch special of a Monte Cristo sandwich and lunch salad side. The salad was delicious and the blue cheese dressing was excellent. Th sandwich was so large I couldn&apos;t eat even one half of it. It is ham,swiss, and turkey dipped in funnel cake batter (the waitress told me this before I ordered) and fried. I was expecting a regular sandwich dipped in egg batter like you use for French toast and grilled. It was ok but the breading was very thick and heavy. It was served with raspberry sauce for dipping. I would not order this sandwich again. The food going by to other tables looked delicious and many people could be heard saying how good it was to their fellow diners. Our waitress Lisa gave excellent service and checked with us every time she passed. We will eat there again. Don&apos;t pass up the croissants drizzled with honey. They are the best.

 Review: Six of us visited here last night, we each had a wonderful meal.... Hurricane Chicken - which is entirely too much to eat - one of us had Sea scallops and another one had Prime Rib - we all went home with full bullies and doggie bags. I highly recommend this to everyone.

 Review: Love this restaurant!! We visit this area every year and always have such a excellent meal. The service is wonderful and friendly and the restaurant is so clean. We noticed their 100% health score and are amazed because there are not many restaurants in the area that have such good scores. We cant wait until our next visit!

 Review: We live nearby and Boundary House is superior to the majority of the local restaurants, which are often only open in the summer and/or serve primarily deep-fried seafood. Boundary House has a much better menu and is consistently reliable if you have out of town guests looking for a nice place to go for lunch or dinner.

 Review: My previous review for The Boundary House was the one posted on July 13, 2007. It&apos;s certainly has been a while since that experience, but my wife and I decided it was time to give TBH another try. We are glad we did! We entered around 5:30pm and were quickly seated. Our waitress was Deanna. She was attentive and very accommodating throughout our visit. The food was great; I once again ordered the crab cakes/fantail shrimp combo, and I didn&apos;t want to chance another cold sweet potato, so I ordered the side of garlic cheddar mashed potatoes. No complaints this time. We topped our meal with the chocolate bundt cake, vanilla ice cream, chocolate dessert. Yum! Four spoons devoured that within seconds! Food, service, atmosphere... all very good. We will certainly not drive pass TBH on our next visit; we&apos;ll stop and look for another great meal.

 Review: My wife and I visited here last Friday night. They told us 15-20 minute wait and were right on. My wife had a strawberry daquari, which she said was the best she ever had. For dinner, I had the Prime Rib - medium rare, and it was perfect, could cut it with a fork, melt in your mouth. My wife had the chicken, and was very happy with it. We plan on going back at least once more before heading home. Best value for the money...

Croissants, soup, spinich dip, crab patties, hickory chicken, hurricane chicken, broiled salmon salad, house salads and desserts are highly recommended. We will be sure to tell our friends that visit the MB area from PA. I heartily recommend this restaurant to all. Save time to visit the shops next door.

 Review: Went to The BH last Friday (8/29) and had the fried flounder with a bowl of chowder...outstanding! The only problem was I underestimated the size of the house salad (which was also very good) and could barely finish my meal (and three Blue Moons)! I was in a party of twelve and was seated about 10 minutes before our reservation time. No one complaint at our table. The Hurricane Chicken looked good, too!

 Review: This was our first trip to the Boundary House and it certainly won&apos;t be our last. Drinks were wonderful (I recommend the frozen peach daquiri!), service was great, food was fantastic, and the restaurant is wonderfully clean. We had a party of 6, most of whom ordered seafood, which was perfectly cooked. My daughter-in-law ordered steak, which was also cooked perfectly. (She ordered &quot;well-done,&quot; and it was cooked without being dry.) I wish we&apos;d had room for dessert, since they had so many choices, but we were so full from dinner we couldn&apos;t eat another bite!

We had steak,scallops, salmon, crab cakes and flounder. Everyone was pleased with their choices. My sister commented that the salad was one of the best she had ever tasted. The combination of greens, nuts and the dressing were all very good. The menu offers a wide variety so we plan to try something different this next visit. We would highly recommend the Boundary House - it tops our list of restaurants in the area!

 Review: I have been a manager of a similar upscale restaurant in Charlotte, NC which later developed into 3 other states after being on the cover of INC Magazine.....that being said. I have NEVER in my life felt the feeling that a server made our ENTIRE TABLE feel....which was HORRIFIC. We were served our drinks and told rudely&quot; it was an hour wait to be seated, an hour wait for drinks and another our for food...that we shouldve went somewhere else&quot;......THEN if that wasnt hateful enough....when our salads arrived, my father (who by the way was his birthday. We were told by the hostess he would be sent a cake -- no singing which we were ok with. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. WE again were treated terribly and we are normal 25% tippers. This case should have been 0, but we tipped 20%.......I would highly reccommend more polite wait staff and fair treatment of each guest. Especially when you dont know if they have CANCER or not. It could happen to your family. And a meal out together should be a pleasant experience, not treated like we should have gone somewhere else.......wait....WE WILL. AND will SPREAD the word all over the southeast!

 Review: As a family who frequents Myrtle Beach every year, we have eaten at many of the restaurants the area has to offer, but the only one we continuously talk about is the Boundary House. We had dinner there last summer and immensely enjoyed our meal. We had an appetizer of cheese fries (amazing!) and the four of us each had a different seafood dish (i can personally attest to the fried shrimp). Being that we are from Maryland, we know good seafood, however, we are often disappointed in southern restaurants because they do not fix it properly. However, we were VERY pleased with our meal at the Boundary House. The atmosphere was wonderful. Our waitress and a second waiter were prompt and friendly with their service and very attentive to our needs. We were seated immediately and were out in a timely manner. Overall, an excellent restaurant! We plan on returning when we visit Myrtle Beach next week!

 Review: My husband and I make it a point to visit this restaurant at least twice each time we visit the Myrtle Beach area. Although many things on the menu are good, our favorite is the Chef Salad. The house dressing is a mixture of Honey Mustard and Hot Bacon. It is served with a fresh baked croissant with honey butter drizzled on top of it. My mouth is literally watering right now thinking of it. Make sure you are hungry if you order this salad. It is huge and packed with toppings. Don&apos;t order this salad if you are on a diet. Mmm Mmm Good! We wish someone could make that salad and dressing locally.

 Review: We love visiting Calabash, but frankly can&apos;t eat all of that fried food anymore. We decided to give the Boundary House a try before we decided to stop visiting Clabash altogether on our annual vacations. WOW! I am so glad that we did! The food was excellent, there were great selections, and the atmosphere and service in the restaurant were great. My wife had a very unique seafood gumbo; I had a large plate of blue crab claws; our teenage son had a steak; our daughter had chicken from the kid&apos;s menu. All of our meals were fantastic. We were there at 6pm on a July weeknight and were seated very promptly, did not have to wait long for service or our meals, and just thoroughly enjoyed our visit! Thanks to the Boundary House, we will be able to continue to visit the town of Calabash every year, and continue to enjoy the boat docks on the waterfront, Callahan&apos;s Christmas shop, miniature golf at Tropical Adventure, and ice cream at the Calabash Creamery!

When I came into the resturant a lady with brown hair and glasses standing behind the stand, said hello how are you then turned around and started talking with a man in a tie and was ignoring me. But when she turned around gave me a buzzer and said &quot;it shouldnt be long&quot; and an hour later she sat me in this booth all the way in the back near the kitchen. Where I was served by a server named samantha. She was excellent and gave great service, and the food was wonderful. All in all I would go back again but I would not want to talk with the lady up front she seemed to lie to keep me in the resturant..

 Review: I recently visited the Boundary House in Calabash, NC. We frequently vacate to the beach and for two years we have been eating at the Boundary House. Here recently though, our service has been spectacular. We are made to feel welcome the moment we walk in the door! The night we came in, there were 3 young ladies and a young man working up front. They made my family and I feel very welcome! They all had smiles on their faces and made us feel that we were important. The windows out front were so very clean and the rugs at the door were spotless. This restaurant takes pride in cleanliness! Especially the bathrooms! They were very clean! When the hostest sat us at a our table, she let us know who our server was, told us to enjoy the meal, and was very easy to talk to when my husband was asking her questions about the restaurant and food! She was great! Our meal was outstanding! When we walked out the door, once again the hosts made us feel great and told us to come back! We made it a point to stop and speak to them and thank them for their hospitality! That makes a restaurant! We will definately come back when we are in town again, because the restaurant keeps getting better and better!

 Review: We have visited the Boundary House on three occasions, hoping the service would be better. The wait staff is very eager and friendly, until they take your order. After that, you never see them again. The main course wait time is excruiatingly slow. There should not be a 45 minute wait between appetizer and main course. My mother ordered a chicken salad as her main course. When our appetizer salads came out, she was served one as well. Odd when you order salad as a main course. So she didn&apos;t really touch it, wanting to save room for her dinner. The table was cleared, the main course came out late ... and my mother was served a piece of grilled chicken. Apparently the grilled chicked was meant to be for the salad she thought was an appetizer. So her meal was served in two sections, 45 minutes apart from each other? Of course, the waitress was no where to be found. The food is mediocre at best and very confusing when served the way it was. For the Grand Strand area, there are many other choices to choose from. Save your money on this one.

We got the crab dip as an appetizer. It should have been called cheese dip. The staff was unethusiastic. I felt it was over priced. We were late and it is the off season, so we got seated promptly. There were few customers in the restaurant so the noise level was good. I wont go back.

When I go by myself, I&apos;ll eat at the bar which is very nice.The place is very clean. bathrooms included. There is hardly any smell of smoke in there.
Only once at the bar did I hear any offensive talk by one of the regular businessman, who was not spoken to regarding it.
Apparently being a regular customer. Other than that, I&apos;ve had all good experiences there.

 Review: Went there in mid-December. It was off season and not crowded - asked for a non-smoking section, and they tried to seat us near the bar (all patrons were smoking there). Was then re-directed to another location (much better).

I ordered the mixed seafood (shrimp&amp;scallops), wife had a steak. Her steak was fine, my seafood mix was terrible. First, the scallops tasted stale and rubbery, and the flounder was to die for, litterally die for - the fish was smelly, over cooked, and miniscule in size (a 3 year old would not have trouble becoming a member of the Clean Plate Club it was so small). Wanted to complain to the manager, but was to busy to see what the problem was.

I read other reviews and though that I was in for a good dining experience. This could have been an &quot;off night&quot; for the prep staff and manager, but to ignore you customers is surely a way to lose business because word of mouth can ruin you - just ask your neighbor who ran into problems running the Pasta House (just down the street).

The appetiser portions were huge, promptly served and excelent. Dinner was great with very unusual mixtures of ingrediants. I think there were too few servers and service was ok. We went the following week with a large group of friends and everything was excelent. We will go back next summer on our vacation. Very good

 Review: The boundary House, was a great place to take you&apos;re family, the service is kind of slow, and there are many table&apos;s. The atmosphere is the prettiest thing- wood and all! Seating, does take a while but once you sit down you sink into the booth, or feel the smoothness of a chair. I have been a Restaurant inspector before, for thirteen year&apos;s, and i would grade it a 99 %- which is excellent, and way above average. If you enjoyed yourself, please go back- we want the boundary house to stay in business forever- don&apos;t we? Thank You, and also- please tip The Boundry House. The Boundary House is located behind Callahan&apos;s Of Calabash- turn left at the light, then left into the Boundary House- Give it a try, and exepirance the Boundary house, and what it has to give. Go their today. Great Price&apos;s, and a wonderful quantity of food!

 Review: I was there that night too and had a pretty decent meal, but as a witness to what had transpired, felt &quot;Mahwah&apos;s&quot; review was more than fair. Of course, I&apos;m not as worldly as those who can use really cool phrasing, yet seems unsure to which state Scranton&apos;s in. Go a few miles down 17 to Myrtle Beach to visit the Carolina Road House, where they stole the entire layout from, less the courtesy. Scranton, being more north than Mahwah make me wonder if &quot;stay up north&quot; hints it&apos;s an employee response. My review reflects my personal dining experience that evening, but maybe I was lucky.

 Review: We had dinner at the Boundary House about a week ago. The food was excellent and it was served quick and hot. Our server was a little slow, but, she had too many tables to take care of at the time. She still tried her best to keep up with our requests for drinks/etc. While the food was definitely outstanding, we thought the menu was lacking. We are sure they are capable of making some great seafood dishes....but they are missing from the menu! The special for the night was Salmon prepared any way you wanted it. We thought that was a little boring....as the reason we are going out to eat is to try someone else&apos;s creations. Overall, we still felt this was a very good restaurant and we would go back.

 Review: My husband and I were with the couple from Mahwah, N.J. that had 
the chicken salad and terrible SERVICE. Besides the lack of service
this what happened next( I have been in the waitress field for many years) After our waitress Dropped our check with not so much as a thank you and not even looking at us I was a little upset. We paid our bill and left it on the table. I guess she knew she was not getting a good tip because I wasn&apos;t half way to the door and she was calling out to me. She asked me if I was sure I didn&apos;t need change. I said no and took her to the side to tell her why she got the tip she got and started to walk away. At this point she yells to me you need this more then I do, I turned back to her and took the tip out of her hand and said your right and there is no law that says 
we should tip for bad service. As far asking to speak to the Manager about any of this would have been pointless because
he never came over to us when there was problem with the food.
Guess If the Manager doesn&apos;t care, Why would the servers!

 Review: We have been going to the Boundary House since it opened. Reading the reviews in the last couple of months we were concerned. The ribs were excellent, the fried oysters divine. The ceasar salad left a little to be desired. The service from Mary was warm and personal. The design of this restaraunt is fantastic. My only negative comment was that all of the wait staff appeared too tired to be there (except ours) This is a change from the sharp as a tack, but warm atmosphere we had felt during their first seasons.

 Review: We visited this restaurant on vacation in Myrtle Beach. What a disappointment, and I will never go back again. No one was friendly, not even our waitress. I ordered the oriental chicken salad. The salad was a little brown and it was swimming in dressing. I let that go and started to eat it, I didn&apos;t tell them to put the dressing on the side. Everyone else enjoyed there meal. While eating the chicken I bit into something hard, I don&apos;t think they cleaned the chicken good. I told the waitress and she asked me if I wanted another one, I didn&apos;t of course. I saw the manager looking through my salad, I guess they didn&apos;t believe me. No one came over to the table to say I am sorry, not even the manager. I wasn&apos;t looking for a free meal, just for the manager to say something to us about our meal. I don&apos;t think we should have asked to see the manager, he should have come over on his own. They just ignored us.When the waitress came with the bill she just laid the bill on the table, she never even looked at us. Of course the salad was on the bill.

 Review: I cannot say enough about the service, food and atmosphere at the Boundary House. This is our second visit and will not be our last. I usually just read the reviews but this time I must write. Unfortunately I believe we sat near the people who wrote below. I witnessed the whole ordeal and I have to say some people are just never happy and do not want to be happy. I felt the server did a great job and I told him not to take the remarks personally. I was glad to read they would not be back as this is the kind of people that we in the service industry do not want back. If you cannot be happy on vacation then why take a vacation?

 Review: What a disappointment. My family and ate here for the first time this past weekend. I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve ever received such poor treatment by a hostess, waiter, and manager alltogether. Everyone was cold, aloof, and not friendly at all. They didn&apos;t smile. The waiter was not very attentive and he gave us refills of unsweet tea instead of sweet tea twice. The au jus for our prime rib sandwiches was incredibly salty and so distasteful it was beyond edible. And frankly, the food was mediocre. I&apos;ve had much better food for the same price at other restaurants. We won&apos;t be going back.

 Review: I have eaten here several times and highly recommend it. From the house salad, to the fried shrimp and the blackened Mahi Mahi is fantastic. We always go early, always the best choice in the busy summer months at any place in the area. The service is prompt and courteous and the restaurant is spotlessly clean. There is NO place in the area I would suggest over this one!!

Not your typical Calabash restaurant. Had sworn off all Calabash and Calabash Style restaurants because it was all fried foods. Well not The Boundary House, hugh variety of choices both seafood and land lovers.
Can&apos;t wait to go back!!

 Review: We happened upon the Bounday House on one of our annual trips to Sunset Beach. We thought it looked interesting and decided to give it a try. We were absolutely thrilled. The food was fantastic and the restaurant itself is unique. We went back for a second time that same week but this time with about 20 other people. The service was a bit slow but considering the number of guests in our group, it was perfectly acceptable. We are getting ready to take another trip to the beach and I have recommended it to everyone I know. We will definitely go back. Thanks for a great restaurant that is a nice change from the typical Calabach fare.

 Review: Have eaten here many times. They are great at serving a large party, if you call ahead and make reservations. The last time, it was just two of us and we got great service. Waited at the bar for about 10 minutes and were then seated and served quickly. Ribs are terrific, as is the potato soup and salad. Be sure to try their hot bacon dressing! Yummy!! Call ahead and you won&apos;t have to wait!!

 Review: The Boundary House was recommended to us by a &quot;local.&quot; My wife and I, along with our 15 and 12 yr old sons arrived Thursday/July 12 at approx. 5:15pm. We were immediately seated and were impressed with the atmosphere. Our waitress, Christy (?), was prompt with getting our drink order and then our salads served. She seemed very sweet, even flirted with our 12 yr old son, which made his night to hear a &quot;beach babe&quot; call him cute! The salads were large portioned with egg and bacon crumpled on top. It came with a buttered croissant that literally melted in your mouth. Christy was super at keeping our glasses full while we waited briefly for our entree. As the main course arrived and was served by an unknown male that didn&apos;t speak to anyone, Christy popped up and gave us all an &quot;Enjoy your meal!&quot; This is where things changed... I had ordered a 2 combo of crab cake and fried fantail shrimp, along with a sweet potato. The crab and fish were delish! But the sweet potato was cold. Not refrigerator cold, but certainly below room temperature. I fully enjoyed the rest of the meal, but had hoped to have found Christy in time to have the potato replaced. No such luck. Our Christy apparently can&apos;t multi-task very well. Once the surrounding tables began to fill, Christy left us. We sat waiting for refills for our drinks; we sat waiting for &quot;So, how was your meal or, did you enjoy your meal?&quot; Nothing; we just sat there. It all started off so well, and then it went south. Our table was cleaned before us by various workers as we waited for our tab. By now, I felt abandoned. I looked for a manager. I found him. He was quite consumed talking on his walkie-talkie and chewing out an employee. Christy then reappeared and left the check on the table without saying a word and then was off again. The bill was $74. (Three adult dinners&amp;one kid&apos;s chicken fingers.) I left $84 cash on the table and waited another 10 minutes to ensure that Christy was the one that picked it up. I wanted 30 seconds to explain to her my complaint of the poor service after the initial great service and to report the sweet potato was cold. No chance, Christy snatched the bill/payment and was gone in a blink of an eye. I should have been more focused on her return and prepared to pounce, but after 10 minutes I became complacent. Regardless, we left without any acknowledgment from anyone. The review: Food was very good (except for sweet potato) ~ A; Service was all over the scale, A at first and then an F at the end ~ D. Atmosphere was very nice ~ A. Would we go again or recommend the restaurant? Yes, but there would not be a third visit, if the second ends like the first!

 Review: We ate here just after it opened in 2006 and this year we visited this restaurant twice on our last trip to N. Myrtle Beach. It was definitely our best meal all week except for our lunch at The Sea Captains House in Myrtle Beach which has the best service, food and atmosphere anywhere. Boundary House has great salads including the garden salad and salmon salad which is huge and very reasonably priced. They also have great gumbo. They even take reservations. Forget the Calabash places by the water unless you love grease.
Boundary House in highly recommended.

 Review: I stopped by after a long morning at work in a cold atmosphere and thought, Oh! the gumbo looks perfect. The gumbo appeared and tasted as though they had run out of the basic gumo and opened a huge can of diced tomatoes. The rice serving was skimpy - there may have been three shrimp and three tiny (think one quarter inch round of sausage quartered) pieces of sausage. I have eaten there twice before. one time was good, the second just okay; this one, below rating.

 Review: We enjoyed the Boundary House for an early dinner (4:45pm). My husband and I decided to each get something different to share. I got the shrimp quesadilla, which was wonderful. Very cheesy and spicy, just the way I like it. My husband got the shrimp and oyster po-boy, which was the best sandwich ever. Very fresh tasting and not too greasy even though the shrimp and oysters were fried. You get fries or slaw with all sandwiches, including the quesadilla!

My daughter, who is a chicken tender connoisseur, opted for fish sticks and a baked potato. The fish sticks were great, fresh fish, not frozen tasting at all.
We will definitely be back. Service and atmosphere made the experience enjoyable, as well.

 Review: My experience with this restaraunt has always been great up until this last visit. My entire staff went out to have a dinner on our company and we all voted to go here because we had been there numerous other times with great food and service. this time we had a normal party of seven and we all got drinks and two people ordered steaks. both steaks were ordered medium to med-rare and neither steak even had a hint of pink in the center.This is very disappointing to our entire staff and probobly will choose another place where someone will at least apologise for their error when brought to their attention.

 Review: Compared to the world of typical calabash style, this was a very successful take with a light fry and twice as much taste. A very pleasant surprise. We will make certain that we make it a yearly tradition to eat there each time we are in town. We will also encourage our friends to make it a destination. Kudos.

 Review: I dined at The Boundary House on May 16 2007 and ordered your basic green salad with a grilled chicken breast on top. It took forever to get our food (2 people at our table) and the chicken breast was way overcooked. Thank goodness for the great house dressing that saved the meal. Our waitress hardly ever checked on us and took forever for her to bring our check. Not a great first impression.

 Review: We have now been back to The Boundary House three times in the past few months... and plan to go this weekend. It is worth our hours drive. The decor and atmosphere are awesome! I love the woodgrain interior. The restaurant is spacious and eye-pleasing.

We have thoroughly enjoyed the food. My mother and I always split the double rack of ribs and their HUGE salad, which is well worth the price. We get &quot;over twice&quot; the ribs for the same price as another restaurant franchise with the initials R.T. :) On my last visit, I also had the creme brulee cheesecake for dessert... it was fantastic! My mom doesn&apos;t usually care for cheesecake, and she loved it.

Although Calabash is best known for its seafood, I am not a seafood eater... so I am excited to have a place at the beach where I enjoy eating as well as experiencing the Calabash atmosphere! Thanks for opening!

 Review: Since discovering this restaurant in June, 2006, we have been back a number of times and have recommended it to others.
The food is excellent and there are some items on the menu that we&apos;ve not found elsewhere. The service can be a little hit or miss depending on the server&apos;s experience.
As to the noise level, we have on a couple of visits been led to tables in or near the bar area and have requested that we be taken to the other side of the restaurant where it is much more quiet and conducive to conversation.

 Review: This is the only restaurant my husband and I have ever eaten where the waitress didnt put in our complete order when we placed our order. We always order a couple of appetizers and an entree, after eating our appetizers another waiter took over and informed us that he had just put in the rest of our order. I was like what why would you just now be putting it in 45 mins later and he said&amp;quot;Im just the messenger&amp;quot;? We finally after a very long period of time got all our food but there are way too many wonderful places in Myrtle Beach to eat so we will not be back. The food was great, but only go if you have a lot time to kill.

 Review: The Boundary House is our favorite restaurant at the beach. There&apos;s something on the menu for everyone. Family favorites are the baked potato soup and their fresh fish selection. Desert menu is ok, we usually prefer to stop at Calabash Creamery instead.

Service has been great and we&apos;ve never had too long a wait. Of course we don&apos;t go at peak times. Prices are ok but expect to pay more than $100 for a family of 5.

 Review: We have been to Boundary House many times and each time our service, the food and atmosphere has been excellent. I recommend the Hurricane Chicken - Chicken breast with a creamy crab topping - oooh so good. My husband has gotten the ribs several times - very good. The house salad dressing is nothing I have tasted before (yummy) and those warm sweet butter croissants are melt in your mouth. The restaurant is in a great location in Calabash next to the St Nick store (make sure you stop by there after dinner)

 Review: Since my first trip to this establishment it has fallen considerably from what I expected. It would seem that as far as prime rib goes, no matter how you order it, it will only come one way. I had to send mine back twice and when it came the third time it was a completely different cut and still was not cooked to what I had asked for. The noise level was so loud I could not hear the wait person even though she was standing right next to me. I doubt that I will ever go back. It just wasn&apos;t worth it.

We then saw at least 10 larger parties being seated so we criied foul and were seated right away. After this problem we had the very best waiter and the best of food. The prime rib was excellant and the seafood eccelled. Sure hope a new hostess is in place before we return in november.

 Review: Having heard good reviews on The Boundary House, my wife, two of our friends, and myself went for dinner. The food we all received was excellent. The waiter was obviously new at serving and repeatedly got our orders confused not only amongst our table, but with another table also. He also was gone for extended periods without refilling water glasses or checking to see if we needed anything else. Because of the quality of the food, we will probably try it again this fall.

 Review: We dined at The Boundary House twice while on vacation. Our group consisted of six people. I thought this restaurant was a nice change from all of the seafood places in Calabash. We arrived for dinner at 9pm both nights. Once on a Monday evening, the next on a Friday. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table on Friday. When I entered the restaurant I thought to myself how beautiful it was. It has wood floors, ceilings, and walls. Simple yet attractive.

Our server both nights was a lovely young woman by the name of Ying. She was very attentive and quick to return.

We each ordered something different and I believe we sampled each other&apos;s dishes.

The salmon wontons and calamari were my favorite appetizers. I had a caesar salad while others had the house salad. Both were great. I ordered the filet the first night and the pesto salmon the next night. Both were delicious. I tasted my friends&apos; beef ribs and they were good too! The croissants were melt-in-your-mouth good. We shared two bottles of Kendall-Jackson.

Everyone in my group enjoyed it enough to eat there twice while on vacation. I have recommended it to several people that vacation at Sunset Beach. Overall I had a great experience. I will return here each year on my vacation!

 Review: We recently visited The Boundary House twice during the week of June 24. Both times the food was excellent; however, the first time we ate there we had most interesting (i.e. very disgusting) service. At the end of each course, our waitress scraped all of the leftovers onto one plate before clearing the table. We tried, indirectly, to tell her that her actions were unpleasant for us, but she just didn&apos;t seem to get it! After we said &quot;ick&quot;, she said &quot;if you want me to clear all of your plates at the same time, this is the only way I can do it&quot;. We thought maybe this was the restaurant procedure, but our waitress during our second visit was much more well trained--she cleared each plate without scraping our leftover food onto one plate. Although our first waitress was not the greatest, the food was excellent and we are glad we gave The Boundary House a second try. We will eat there again.

 Review: The food was very good but the service and waiting time made it a most unpleasant dining experiance. This was the most disorganized wait staff I have ever experienced. Silverware seemed to be in short supply as we were not the only table I saw who had a salad to arrive with no silverware and a waiter who vanished into thin air for long periods of time but if you watched you could see them on the far side of the restaurant chatting it up with fellow wait staff. You were out of luck if you needed a drink refilled. I might try a call ahead take out order in the future but won&apos;t waste an entire evening to eat there again. The place is very pretty for such a disapointment in dining .

The first time we ate there, the wait was 1 hr 10 minutes on a Friday night, but we went to Callahan&apos;s which made the wait feel like 5 minutes. The second time, we got seated right away. The only thing I would have to complain about is the noise level. It is very loud in there between conversation and the music they are playing.

It is DELICIOUS! I have ordered the caesar sald, but it was not my favorite. The dressing was too watery. Their house salad is also AMAZING, and their rolls are some of the best! I always recommend this restaurant!

 Review: We are locals and decided to try the new Boundary house. Food and service was ok. When we got the bill my husband was charged for a refill on his hot tea. Another $1.75 . When we questioned the young lady who was the manager on duty, she informed us that was owner&apos;s policy. She told my that was a common practice around the area. I beg to differ. I was born and raised her and we eat out about 4 times a week at many different restaurants and have NEVER been charged for a refill of any kind of tea. We think the waiter should have informed of the additional charge or it should be printed on the menu. She would not remove the charge and we will never go there again. Shame on them !!!!!!

 Review: There were four of us that went to dinner on 2/4 with reservations at 7:30 pm. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time. It took almost 45 mins. to get our drinks and an appetizer. In an hour and 15 mins we had our salads and I canceled the second round of drinks. The salads when they came were good. I ordered prime rib rare and it came out like a plank. The other three meals were a chicken dish and two seafood entrees that were described as medicore by the eaters. After a discussion with the waitress and the manager about the prime rib he offered to sub a filet rare. It came semi-rare but I was tired of waiting and ate it. This place has a lot of growing up to do before it will be a great place to eat. We all(4) live in Ocean Isle and will not be back for a long, long time.

 Review: Since first impressions are usually lasting impressions, I would say The Boundary House is an excellent choice if you are looking for something other than the traditional &quot;Calabash&quot; seafood fare. I had the prime rib and it was a nice size portion and cooked to near perfection for my taste. The salad was outstanding. Dessert was dessert. We went early so seating was not a problem. The restaurant was immaculate as you would expect from a new establishment. The staff was very courteous and conscientious. Dinner here will probably cost you more than at other area restaurants but if you are tired of seafood, it is a great change of pace.
