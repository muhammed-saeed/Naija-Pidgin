 Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!!! 
 Here we are at the end of 2011 and the end of my Term as your Public Outreach Coordinator. It&apos;s been an exciting and as you can see fruitful time in Area 86, Ontario South Al-Anon. What started out as an idea grew into something bigger then I ever imagined. And it was all because of you. Your willingness to participate in getting Al-Anon into the community. And you certainly have done that and more. I know that these posted Acts are just a tip of what really goes on in our Area. Keep up the fantastic work, because you never know who you&apos;ll reach. Thank you once again for sharing this journey with me and I&apos;ll see you around the rooms.

(((((((((((((((((((((((BIG HUGS)))))))))))))))))))))))))))
