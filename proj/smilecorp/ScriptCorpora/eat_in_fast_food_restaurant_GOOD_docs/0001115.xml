 Burned Out Server is Sacked 

 July 10, 2012 

in Server Stories 
 
Waiting tables can burn you out hard, especially if you’re the type of person who hustles. After 20 years of serving low-life miscreants, my burn-out was way beyond being tired of it. Every fiber of my being was just done with it. It got to the point that everyone I waited on was a motherless, ill-bread moron, and I loathed the fact that they even decided to eat out. How dare they? …Read more »

 Second-Rate Service at Moose Jaw Restaurant 

 July 8, 2012 

in Server Stories 
 
OK, I live in a small town. I am a waitress in a small diner in my town. It is a very busy diner and there is only myself and my boss who work the floor. Most times there is only one of us at a time. We both have worked where the diner fills up to approximately 60 people. …Read more »

Over here in the UK we are used to heavy bouts of rainfall. Heck it rains 200 days a year over here. But every now and then we get the rare but scary storm that puts us on our toes. Anyway to the story… …Read more »

 Getting Regionally Screwed

in Server Stories 
 
If you look up the word c*nt in a dictionary, there’s a better than average chance you’ll find a picture of a restaurant Regional Manager. Regardless of gender. …Read more »

 Living the Groupon Dream 

 June 30, 2012 

in Diner Stories 
 
My night starts with a deuce on Table 24.

I walk up, introduce myself and thank them for joining us this evening. Before I can ask them if they’d like to begin their dinner with a cocktail, the woman reaches into her purse and slaps a Groupon down on the table, essentially broadcasting their intention to eat on the cheap. …Read more »

 Server’s Scam 

 June 24, 2012 

in Server Stories 
 
My wife and I recently spent a day in San Francisco. When we stopped for lunch at Pier 39 we knew we’d pay for the touristy location, but were not prepared for the magnitude of what we ran into at an Italian restaurant on the water. …Read more »

 Wine Purchase Puzzles Diners 

 June 20, 2012 

in Server Stories 
 
This happened last night and it was so weird, I’m still going over it in my mind. My husband and I took our 25-year-old niece out to dinner at a new restaurant in town. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Very lovely atmosphere. Upscale. After 10 minutes our waitress showed up and took our order. After another 20 minutes she brought our salads. Then we sat and waited. …Read more »

 Server Stands by Table Entire Time 

 June 20, 2012 

in Server Stories 
 
About two years ago I was dining at an Asian restaurant in San Antonio with my mother and younger brother. The food was delicious but a few things bothered me. First, the waitress stood right by our table the entire time and never left our side. That was nice when it came to requesting refills, but then there comes the second oddity. …Read more »

 Typhoon Troubles Customer 
 May 25, 2012 Accident&amp;Mishap Stories 
While traveling through Southeast Asia, I spent a few weeks in the Philippines. One day it was raining (caused by a typhoon). There wasn’t much to do, so I packed my Macbook Pro and went to a restaurant to use their free WiFi. I ordered a Coke and started to browse the internet.

 Manager is a Slacker 
 May 6, 2012 Fast Food Stories 
I currently work as the fry cook at a high volume beer and wings joint in Atlanta. Been there almost exactly one year, and will be leaving in one week. Here’s why…Management sucks. My last job as cashier at a fast casual South African restaurant, where the manager and prep cook would frequently bang [...]

 Customer Scalded by Coffee 
 April 6, 2012 Accident&amp;Mishap Stories 
I was working as a waitress at a hotel restaurant. It was my first job so I didn’t have much experience and the restaurant was always woefully understaffed. People would just call in 5 minutes before their shift started and cancel or simply not turn up–and for some reason the managers never fired [...]

 Ruckus at the Pancake Restaurant 
 March 25, 2012 Server Stories 
Many years ago my parents and I went to a popular pancake chain for dinner. This particular location was known for its poor service, but nothing like this one night. We were seated by a very disgruntled waitress, who took our drink orders and stormed to the kitchen.
