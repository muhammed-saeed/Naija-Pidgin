		If you’re tired of trying, chasing, wanting, hoping  …but NEVER GETTING the one you truly care about because she just DOES NOT FEEL THAT WAY... you’ll find your solution right here in this report. 

 This breakthrough you&apos;re about to discover on this brand-new webpage works almost overnight and costs you next to nothing. Wanna try it free? Keep reading … 

 T here are two kinds of guys in this world…

 Those who know trigger a woman’s intense sexual desire …and … Guys who don’t, and up being best friends with a woman they secretly LOVE. 

Have you ever had a girl who you were dying to be with …you felt like you did absolutely everything“right” …and still, your dreams were crushed and ended with her saying, “sorry, but I just don’t feel that way about you.” 

If so, you’re not alone. Do you know the biggest reason why guys get that painful little speech?

It’s because – as guys …
 
 We Put Ourselves
Into the Friend Zone! 

That’s right – if you find yourself in the friend zone – it’s literally because you are TELLING women to put you there.

(I’ll explain the shocking reasons why this is true in just a moment.)

Yet here’s the good news …I’m so confident I can teach you a simple set of changes that makes it IMPOSSIBLE for you to ever again land in the&quot;friend zone&quot;– I’m going to send you the only program in the world containing these secrets to try – for FREE – just to prove it .

The program&apos;s called The Friend Zone Formula  …and before I send you your copy to try, let me introduce myself …

My name is Jason Capital – and I used to be absolutely horrible with women.  I got the“let’s be friends”speech almost every time I made a move on a girl. And – don’t laugh! – I was literally a virgin into my junior year in college. (Despite the fact that I was a decent-looking athlete.)

I’d meet a girl, I’d do everything I was“supposed”to do (including many of the techniques I read in books) …and still it would end badly.

What’s worse, this still happened to me even after I began to learn a bunch of pretty famous“pickup”material. I went from a nice guy …to wannabe player – but the“let’s be friends”speech never changed.

Actually, it DID change …but not until I met some guys who seemed to never land in the friend zone. In hanging out with them, I learned how women read us and how I was sending them all the wrong signals.

All my communication with women was sending me to that one painful place – the friend zone. And I was desperately urgent to understand and fix this because …

 Women Size Us Up
and 
 Determine How Sexual We Are –
 In a Matter of Seconds! 
 
 The Best Sex of Your Life! (And Why You Haven’t Had It…Yet) 

How much do you know about sexual tension? Can you FEEL it? Do you remember the last time you felt sexual tension?

Whatever you answers to these questions, I assure you: WOMEN ARE PROS AT FEELING SEXUAL TENSION.

In fact, their capacity to experience orgasms is directly related to the buildup of sexual tension that occurs before sex. If there&apos;s no sexual tension, she won&apos;t want sex -- or it will be really bad. But build up the sexual tension massively enough, and she&apos;ll not only often&quot;attack&quot;you sexually…her orgasm will be explosive beyond her wildest dreams.

That will lead to…um…a lot of repeat business for you, if you know what I mean :)

But here&apos;s the problem, guys who frequently land in the friend zone are masters at diffusing sexual tension. It&apos;s a HUGE letdown for a girl to be into a guy, and then have him ruin the sexual tension with a silly and easily avoidable mistake.

This is yet another reason why I created the Friend Zone Formula . It helps you eliminate the things almost all guys do to quickly kill sexual tension…and it gives you natural, effortless ways of building sexual tension to the point where she&apos;s practically ready to rip your clothes off.

Don&apos;t wait -- review the Friend Zone Formula at home FREE for 14 days -- and then decide if it&apos;s right for you. Just click on any of the links you see below, complete the process, and we&apos;ll immediately get you Instant Access to download the entire Friend Zone Formula Package so that you can get started right away.
 
I gotta admit – women are pretty remarkable creatures. In less than a minute, sometimes mere seconds, they can make a decision on whether you’re a potential friend or lover. And usually, the hotter she is, the faster she decides.

 But how do they size you up so fast? 

Well, for one thing, women are much more skilled in their observation of little details. Think about it: Have you ever had a women get super excited because you noticed some teeny, tiny little thing about her …like the color of her eyes or a little bracelet she was wearing?

We all have – woman’s ability to notice small details is incredible. Yet it also can make life pretty hard for us guys. For example …
 
 - Women don’t just notice what you say ; they pay even more attention to how you say it …what emotions you have when you say it …the tone and inflection of your voice …and a whole bunch of other nuances.

 - Like dogs, they can smell fear . They know if you’re confident, how relaxed you are, where you have tension and whether they will be able to relax in your presence …

 - They are keenly sensitive to sexual energy and intention. They know whether you’re sexually attracted to her, how comfortable you are with your sexual desire, how much sexual energy you have. Even whether you’ll be able to be dominant with her in the bedroom …

 - Women also pay very close attention to signals conveyed by your body. But not so much whether you’re fat or skinny, tall or short – rather, they look for how you carry yourself, how you walk, whether your posture is confident or insecure, and countless other things …

 - Of course, they also notice how you dress – but more than that, they observe all the aspects of your grooming, your shoes, how your outfit is put together, what your“style”is, and more …

- The list goes on and on.
 
 Intimidating, right? I mean …no guy can possibly be thinking or correcting all those things whenever he talks to a woman! It’s enough to make someone insane.

But the good news is, YOU DON’T HAVE TO. Instead, you just need to learn some of the simple behaviors I discovered in guys who never land in the friend zone.
 
 &quot;Who the Hell Is Jason Capital? 
And Why Should I Care?&quot; 

I used to be bad with women…really bad. Well, actually -- I was worse than bad, because most of the time I never even made the effort.

You know that guy at parties who stands alone in the corner, trying to be cool? I was that guy. I wouldn&apos;t talk to girls, mostly because I had no clue what to say or do when I was actually with one.

I was also afraid to take chances. I had some confidence in other areas of my life and a lot going for me overall…just not with women. And it had started to become pretty embarrassing.

One day, after a particularly painful moment with an ex-girlfriend, I had this moment where I distinctly remember thinking, &quot;Man, I really need to do something about this …&quot; 

So I began to look for possible solutions everywhere . I read books. I ordered programs. I even tried a few in-person workshops. Yet …

 Nothing Seemed to Work! 
 
In fact, some of it actually made me WORSE with women -- probably becauseI felt like I was becoming&quot;fake&quot;and manipulative, which was NOT who I ever aspired to be.

All this seriously screwed with my head. Not only did I still suck with women, but I becoming someone I didn&apos;t want to be…worse, I was becoming someone I HATED. (Not to mention that I was massively undersexed and becoming more frustrated with each passing day)…

I began to have serious doubts about what I was doing, and some pretty radical thoughts of change began popping into my head -- thoughts that I quickly suppressed because I was still too emotionally invested in all the things I was learning.

Then one day, I finally just let it all go. I was playing in a Co-Ed basketball league with a super hot yoga girl that I was totally into…I&apos;m talking total&quot;10.&quot;

(She was so hot, in fact, that she was actually dating an NHL player at the time.)

Anyway, so we were shooting around and she pretended to play defense on me. It was fun and playful, and as I was going up to shoot, she went to block me. She missed, of course…but the crazy part was that her hand landed right between my legs. She got a little embarrassed and normally I wouldn&apos;t have said anything. Or maybe said it was&quot;okay&quot;(just like most guys)…but something snapped.

Instead of censoring my thoughts -- and this is key -- I said EXACTLY what was on my mind …

Now, I won&apos;t tell you what I said (sorry, it was just too good to share for free :P)…but needless to say, just a few days later I was having sex with her in the shower.

 That Experience Changed Me in a DEEP Way … 

Empowered by the moment of truth that I had just experienced, I began to relate and interact with women in a totally different way. And things got easier…a LOT easier. I barely had to&quot;think&quot;anymore about what I was going to do or say, and women would just follow my lead. It was completely amazing.

Things got so good, in fact, that guys started coming to me for help despite the fact that I never advertised myself as a dating guru or expert. It was all 100% word of mouth.

There was just one problem: Because I was a busy entrepreneur with a hectic international traveling schedule, the only price that made sense for me to charge was $10,000 per client. Expensive? Yes -- but the guys who could afford it, and who SAW my lifestyle, never hesitated to grab one of the limited number of spots.

I became known as the&quot;10K Guy&quot;…and my clients were experiencing some of the most unbelievable transformations I&apos;d ever seen.

Still…

 There Was One More Thing I Needed To Do 

You see, even though I was making a huge difference for a small number of guys…I wanted to reach even more people. Even my $10,000 clients were urging me to share more of the wisdom and secrets -- they wanted something they could tell their friends and other guys to go check out…

Which leads us to the present, and this page that you&apos;re reading now. I created the The Friend Zone package -- which I&apos;m willing to send you a FREE copy to try for 14 days  -- because I&apos;m that convinced of it&apos;s ability to change the way you relate to women forever.

It helps quickly solve one of the very biggest problems we face as guys…and gives you real, honest adjustments you can make to what you say and do -- starting TODAY -- in order to experience dramatically better results with women.

I hope you&apos;ll accept my generous offer. Either way, I urge you to continue reading this page for some useful tips about how you can more easily be the kind of guy that has tons of quality options with women.

Sincerely,
 
Jason Capital
 
 Why Sex Is Easy for Some Guys… 

Obviously one of the biggest things that sucks about the friend zone is that your chances of sex are …drum roll pleeease …ZERO.

In fact, the friend zone is really just a nice way of her rejecting you sexually .

On the other hand, why is it that certain guys never get classified as“just a friend”? 

I’ll tell you:

 It’s all about what these guys COMMUNICATE
to women (often on an unconscious level)...
 especially in regard to SEX . 

In other words, if women are not interested in sex with you – it’s usually because somehow you are communicating that you won’t give her good sex. PERIOD.

If you were truly communicating that you’d rock her world in the bedroom, there’s simply NO CHANCE she would put you in the friend zone.

Remember: Sex is SUPER IMPORTANT to women. They enjoy it more than we do …believe it or not, they NEED it more! A guy that communicates he’ll give a woman some of the best sex of her life will always be in high demand.

What Sexually Strong
Guys Communicate
(That Friend Zone Guys Don’t)…
 
Okay, so I know what you’re thinking. You need to get better at sex …maybe you need to go read a book, buy a course, or attend a seminar.

NOT SO FAST.

Avoiding the friend zone has little to do with knowing the latest, greatest sexual techniques (any nerd can research that) …and it’s not even about sexual experience.

Instead, it’s about your behavior demonstrating that you’re the kind of guy who will make the ENTIRE SEXUAL EXPERIENCE“hot”for her – before, during, and after.

 Again, this has NOTHING to do with your“size” …height …appearance …past experience …money …or anything material. 

 It’s all about what she observes and FEELS when she’s in your presence. 

For example, let’s take my friend“David”…

I met him at a business seminar a couple years ago, way before I understood all of this stuff. And I gotta tell you …when I first met David, I was floored by the stuff he would say to women. He would playfully tease women about the most outrageous sexual things …and they LOVED it. In fact, he got laid more than just about any guy I had ever met.

Again, David wasn’t super rich, tall, great-looking or any of the other things that guys believe they need. Instead, he was really free – mostly in his personality – and comfortable with himself in a way that drove women crazy.

Remember that if you want more sex …your entire personality and actions need to reflect that you’re going to deliver a great sexual experience for both you and her. Otherwise, why should she bother?

A guy’s who’s deeply relaxed/comfortable in his own skin will be able to enjoy sex WAY MORE than someone who’s uptight – which means more pleasure for her as well.

While we’re at it …

 Here Are 3 Other Surprising Things
You Might Not Know About the Friend Zone 

#1
 “I Must Not Be Sexually Desirable” … 

That’s often what guys start to think – or worse, start to BELIEVE – after they’re put in the friend zone often enough.

Now, if you’ve ever felt this after getting the speech, I have some good news and some bad news …

The good news is you don’t need to worry – just because one particular woman doesn’t want you sexually …it doesn’t mean that you’re not sexually desirable, or that you never will be.

What it DOES mean – and this is the bad news – is that guys who don’t get sex actually somehow fail at communicating their sexual intentions to women.

And I’m talking failure across the board – in words, in body language, in voice tonality, and so on.

Remember, the guy who oozes sex might not always get the girl – but he rarely gets the friend zone speech.

It’s very, very HARD for a girl to put a highly sexual guy into this category – almost impossible, in fact.

So if you’re getting the speech (or you have gotten it) – and you don’t know why …don’t think it’s because there’s something wrong with you. Instead, just understand that you need to do a much, MUCH better job of communicating your sexuality and desire.

#2
 Abandon All Hope! 
 
Hope is a very positive human emotion …yet as guys, it’s one of our the biggest enemies when it comes to sex and landing in the friend zone.

Why? Well, it’s a bit counterintuitive – but guys who get laid a lot don’t really waste a bunch of time secretly wishing a girl is going to want them or sleep with them.

Yet guys who land in the friend zone often are always quietly hoping and wishing that the girl’s feelings will someday change.

He feels that somehow, if he’s nice or sweet or enough of something  …she’s going to suddenly realize what an amazing guy he is – and badly want to be with him.

Unfortunately, that waiting and“hoping”is disastrous – because it communicates so many bad things about him …

It shows that he’s unable to directly state – or communicate with his body – his sexual desire …which leads to a painfully platonic situation …it shows that he doesn’t have enough self esteem to move on to another girl …

... And worst of all, it shows that he has NO POWER over the situation (which is never hot). He’s hoping for her to change and feel something, giving her all the power to accept or reject him.

Can you see why hope is the enemy when it comes to women and the friend zone?

#3
 Let Mommy Go! 

When you were a baby, Mommy was everything. She was your entire universe …if she smiled and approved, you did something good. If she got upset, you had done something bad.

In those formative years …you, me, and pretty much all of us guys learned that making our mothers happy was always the best thing to do. And thus, we developed an intense need to please her …

While some boys were lucky enough to break up that pattern (often because of strong male figures in their life) and thus stopped wanting to please Mommy so badly …others were not so lucky. And that pattern pretty much became the way they related to ALL women …

It’s been well diagnosed in books like No More Mr. Nice Guy and Anxious to Please (both excellent resources, by the way) – that many guys are desperately – and in a very passive-aggressive way – still desperately trying to please any woman in their life.

 Of course, the problem is that
 this is TOTALLY UNATTRACTIVE to women . 

First of all, she feels like she is dealing with a child – not a MAN. Second, she doesn’t feel like the nice gestures are truly genuine – just a weak attempt to try to win her love or approval.

All this makes it virtually impossible for her to see you sexually …and that’s true regardless of your looks, your“game,”how much money you have or anything else.

So how do you know you suffer from this issue?

Well …

 If you care a lot about what women think of you …
 If you very much want them to“like”you (not just bang you but LIKE you) …
 If you’ve ever felt anxious when you sensed disapproval from a woman …
 If you’ve ever felt compelled to do really sweet or romantic gestures for a woman that wasn’t into you …
 If you have trouble stating your real feelings or desires, for worry they might be“wrong” …
 If you’ve ever felt ashamed or embarrassed about your sexual desire for a woman …
 If you have (or have had) trouble asserting yourself – especially with women …
 If one of your biggest fears is a woman rejecting you and thinking that you’re“not good” …
 If you daydream about meeting the“perfect”woman …
 If you’ve ever gotten the friend zone speech with a woman you were clearly into, and yet continued on like nothing happened …
 Or if you’ve ever worked hard to make a woman happy, only to have her go and be with a guy who was doing a lot less for her … 

... Then chances are pretty high that you have a“pleasing problem”– and it needs to be addressed before you ever realize your potential with women.

The good thing is you can quickly short-circuit this debilitating behavior – with some simple exercises that help you let go of the need to please …and the need for female approval.

In fact, I’ve helped many guys do exactly that.

Just check out these emails I received from several guys just the other day …
 
&quot;6 years chasing the same girl ...
With Jason&apos;s help, we had this girl calling me &quot;
 
&quot;I spent 6 years chasing the same girl only to be put in the&quot;friend zone&quot;over and over by her. Eventually, I just hit a frustration point and went to the best I could find on the Internet -- Jason Capital.

With Jason&apos;s help, we had this girl calling me in just a few weeks time, but even better, with all the stuff Jason showed me, I didn&apos;t even want her when she came calling -- there&apos;s way too many cooler, hotter women out there for me now.&quot;

—Stephen S.
 
&quot;I met my amazing girlfriend&quot;
 
When talking to Jason, he found one thing in me that needed to be fixed, one thing I never would have realized and once we flipped that switch for me, everything changed. I met my amazing girlfriend a few weeks later and the rest, as they say, is history.

—Eric A.
 
&quot;His idea&apos;s actually work in the real-world&quot;
 
I&apos;ve been through all these alleged&quot;gurus&quot;books and courses out there and they&apos;re all just a bunch of marketing hype as far as I can tell, trying to get us to spend our hard-earned money... BUT Jason Capital&apos;s different... His idea&apos;s actually work in the real-world and they work well (the hotter the girl, the better they work). There&apos;s no one else even worth going to advice besides Jason Capital. The man is a prodigy.

—Brad G.
 
 Now It Can Be EASY for You to
Be All These Things (And Much More) that Ensure You NEVER Find Yourself
Stuck in the Friend Zone Again! 

Which is why I’m writing you today.

You and I both know that women are extremely complicated …and it’s pretty scary when you think of all that you have to do – or not do – in order for them to want to sleep with you.

Yet the good news is that by making just a few powerful changes in your actions and mindset, you’ll be able to convey virtually EVERYTHING you need to get and STAY out of a women’s friend zone – for life.
 
That’s exactly why I created this powerful new manual, called The Friend Zone Formula  …which gives you all the most crucial steps to take in order to become the kind of guy who gets whatever kind of relationship he wants with women.

Look, I know how bad it feels to sit on the sidelines, while all the other guys are out there are having fun with your hot, desirable women.

And I don’t want you to EVER have to hear that painful“let’s be friends”speech again – like I did so many times …

Now you won’t have to. With The Friend Zone Formula , you get 43 BIG pages of instruction, tips and exercises sure to change the way you relate to women forever …

You’ll discover …

 The two-letter word that immediately tells her that you’re NOT a pushover , you have balls, and that you won’t be putting up with any of her shit. Hard to believe you can say so much, so quickly – but you can with this word. Use it at least once every time you talk to her. A deceptively simple written exercise that dramatically speeds your transformation as a man. You can read books and books, attend seminars, but if you can’t do this  …it’s probably all pointless. How to quickly“reverse”any moments of rejection. This emotional“judo”will almost make her wonder whether she’s the one that got rejected …and almost always leads to her feeling like it was her loss. What to do if the girl you’re interested in talks or flirts with another guy in front of you. (Hint: Getting mad is not the answer, nor is“expressing your feelings.”) Little things you might be doing that make her perceive you as a ZERO. It’s  painful but true …if you’re guy in her“friend zone,”she literally perceives you as nobody and nothing. Which is why it’s so easy for her to mistreat you, not think of you, and so on. Once you understand this it becomes a LOT easy to stop … Why you don’t need to plan what to say – or any kind of routine – to escape the friend zone. In fact, the more you rely on those things the more likely you are to STAY there …simply because you’re not changing the key factor that’s causing you to be“just friends”material in the first place. How to put girls in YOUR friend zone (do this right, and she’ll be chasing you eager to prove that she’s worth your sexual interest!) 5 powerful steps ANY guy can take to ensure a woman sees you sexually (even if you’ve been locked in the friend zone for years!) Follow these steps right and she’ll be wondering “what happened to you?” with that wide-eyed look like she’s ready to be taken back to your place at any moment … Three things she wants and looks for (within minutes of meeting you) and two common mistakes you&apos;re likely making (without knowing it) that almost immediately tell her“I’m not the kind of guy you get sexual or physical with” … How our Mothers really messed us up with women – and what to do about it. No need to see a therapist or have a heart-to-heart with Mom, just understanding this ONE SIMPLE MISTAKE will help you change what could be the worst friend zone behavior there is … A total dead giveaway that she’s faking her interest in you! A secret that any good businessman knows about time management – that will immediately raise your value to women – and make it almost impossible for her to lump you into the same“don&apos;t sleep with”group as all the other guys are allow her to waste their time … The“P”word that almost instantly will ruin your chances of sex. It’s okay to say it – just don’t do it! Stop betraying yourself by doing this . You do it almost every time you meet a woman you’re into. It’s killing you. And it’s killing your chances. STOP IT NOW. Here’s how … The“compliment test”  …how to know when the compliment you’re thinking of will help you – or hurt you … Why you should be putting hot women in YOUR friend zone! Seems counter-intuitive, right? WRONG. If you want her chasing and pursuing you, this is one of the smartest things you can possibly do. Here’s how and when to do it. And so much more … 

Of course, I created this manual because I felt it would be the very best way to give you the simple steps you MUST take to transform yourself into this kind of guy.

However, I also recognize that some guys need AUDITORY stimulation as well for optimal learning …

... And they need to hear all the subtle demonstrations of tonality, vocal cadence and inflection in order to fully“get”what this program is all about.

That’s also why I’ve created …
 
 You’ll Also Get an Audio MP3 Recording 
of the Entire The Friend Zone Formula Manual, So that You Can Take the Information 
Wherever You Go … 

In addition to the manual, I’ve also created a special MP3 file where I personally and powerfully read through all the content contained in the The Friend Zone Formula manual.

Whether you throw into onto your laptop, or iPod – there are several advantages to having it this:
 
 1) You’ll be able to get started right away. That’s right, once you place your order you’ll get immediate access to both the manual and this audio file, so that you can download and begin TODAY.

It&apos;ll be sure to give you a head start on absorbing the powerful information and processes contained inside.

 2) You’ll have it wherever you go. I must admit …it’s sometimes easy to regress in this area, and we as guys need constant reminding of what it takes to always be the guy who gets sexual interest.

Thus, it’s extremely convenient and effective to have this audio available on your phone or iPod anytime you need a quick reminder or confidence-boost.

 3) You’ll get to hear my naturally confident voice, tone and inflection. Again, reading is great. I’ve learned a ton by reading, which is why I created the manual.

At the same time, what you often miss when reading is the quality of a person’s voice – which in this case will go a long way toward helping you understand the right (and wrong) ways to communicate the advice inside The Friend Zone Formula. 

On it’s own this would be a powerful tool – but when combine the written, visual and auditory learning methods together in one system – the result is an unparalleled learning tool sure to help put your transformation into overdrive.

Cutting-Edge Information…Incredible Value

Now, given everything you’ve seen – how much would you expect to pay for the complete The Friend Zone Formula package?

First off, know that this information has never been released …because this is the very first time I’ve ever gone public with anything.

When I offered very limited private coaching, it’s been (and will continue to be) at least $10,000.

If I offer seminars with even a hint of this information, it will be at least $1,000-2,000.

And when I do offer very limited private coaching, it isn&apos;t be cheap.

Plus.. Consider this …most e-books in this niche (written by&quot;weasel marketers&quot;and not actual dating coaches) can cost you as much as $97 (by the way, what is it with all of their snake-oil products ending in the number 7? Like $37 or $77... Why is that?!? Lol.).

It’s clear that – priced individually – each element in this package could be like this …

 The Friend Zone Formula Manual: 44 pages of action-packed, step-by-step,“do this, do that”directions and tips for transforming yourself into a guy who knows how to get and STAY out of the friend zone, for life …a $79 VALUE! The Friend Zone Formula MP3: An instantly downloadable file that you take with you anywhere, and use anytime for a burst of confidence, inspiration – or just as a simple reminder to keep yourself on track …a $39 VALUE! 

 

Now, with all this in mind, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised to find out that (after your trial period) the entire The Friend Zone Formula package will only cost you $39.95 (and that&apos;s only after your 14-day trial). That’s a savings of over $78 off the list price .

Again, you still have 14 BIG days to try before you make a decision or get billed – so the risk is entirely on my end.

No matter what, I think you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better value in this entire industry.

Of course, we’re not just talking about monetary value here, are we? I mean …what would it be worth to you to no longer have to wait and hope for women to want you …only to end up with the friend zone (rejection) speech?

Imagine sex coming easily …quickly …without a lot of work or you trying to please her?

And what would it be worth to finally have women PURSUING YOU and thinking you’re“sexy”(because relaxed, highly sexual guys are automatically“hot”and sexy) …

It’s obvious, the answer is“priceless.”

So now, you have a decision to make …
 
 Remember the first text messages I showed you? 

Well, one thing is clear: The problem of landing in the Friend Zone too much is something that won’t fix itself.

Just like with women, you can HOPE the problem will change …you can hope that women will suddenly want to start wanting to come over to your place at midnight …

 ... Yet I’m sure by now you realize that this hope is futile. 

 You must DO something if you want to be free of friend zone – and fill women with that burning urge to be with you sexually …

Again, it’s NOT going to change all by itself.

 That’s exactly what your free package of The Friend Zone Formula can help you do. It’s designed to help you reverse not just one, two or three …but ALL of the behaviors and mindsets that get guys landed in the friend zone (and empty-handed at the end of the night.)

Remember -- you have only $5 to risk – less than a deluxe meal at a fast food restaurant – to see if the product delivers on the promise of helping to get and STAY out of this painful place that no guy should have to experience.

I’ve done my part. I’ve made it easy as possible for you to say“yes”and try out this powerful process.

Now the choice is yours.

Request your trial copy today and leave the friend zone behind forever …

P.S. You know, I&apos;m not a huge fan of all the huge&quot;marketing schemes&quot;I&apos;ve seen other so-called&quot;gurus&quot;doing so I hope you didn&apos;t mind that I just laid out for you exactly what&apos;s being offered here so you can simply decide if it&apos;s something you want or something you don&apos;t (totally novel idea, right?).

I hope you at the very least got to read the whole letter and learned a lot about the 3 BIG things all guys are supposed to know (but are never taught) about the friend zone.

Anyway, I&apos;d like to thank you with all my heart for taking the time to read this long letter (and if you didn&apos;t catch it, go back and read Thing #3 about the friend zone -- might just change your life). Later.

 

 

 
 
 NOTE: The Friend Zone Formula is a downloadable e-book (and the audio is a downloadable mp3 file). No physical products will be shipped. After you order, you will get INSTANT ACCESS to download the e-book and the entire audiobook. The e-book format is adobe acrobat PDF, which can be viewed on Mac or PC. Questions should be directed to JasonCapitalHelpDesk@gmail.com. Charges WILL NOT say anything about&quot;Jason Capital&quot;or&quot;The Friend Zone Formula&quot;on your billing statement; instead, it&apos;ll ONLY say CLK*BANK or Clickbank.com (the name of the Internet&apos;s top-rated merchant processor and our preferred choice). 

 Enjoy my pulse-pounding disclaimer: According to my lawyers, the FTC mandates that I state what a&quot;typical&quot;result is if I use testimonials on my website, so here&apos;s the dealio: Most guys who invest in their dating and sex life never end up even using the programs they purchase -- they just like buying stuff, so most of the time, their&quot;typical&quot;results are zero. Don&apos;t be like them -- get this program AND use it. You&apos;ll get results that way. Also, don&apos;t do hard drugs, try not to swear in front of your mom and eat an apple a day. Holler.
