I ate at  A&amp;w/KFC today. The food was still fast food but the service was amazing.

It&apos;s hard enough to get good service at a full service restaurant, but to get great service at a fast food joint? This was one of those rare experiences.

I went in with my 3yo daughter and was greeted by Brittney. Usually when people see my daughter, they lack the patience to deal with someone else&apos;s child. Brittney was truly amazing. She was genuinely nice. The kind of nice that people can&apos;t emulate. You either have it or you don&apos;t.

I don&apos;t eat fast food often, but that just changed.

YUMMY! Root beer on tap.  With frosty .5 Liter glasses.  What a deal!  They got kids taking orders and serving, which can be trying.  But they aim to please!
I had their Tuesday deal buy one Papa burger and get one free.  They also have their Coney Island hot dogs got $.99.

Wow! The service is awesome here! Dropped in to grab a quick bite to go (no drive thru) and was a little indecisive. Did I want KFC or A&amp;W? Hmm...both sounded good and it&apos;s been years since I&apos;ve had A&amp;W...

Got the A6 combo which is the cheeseburger, fries and drink combo. Delish! I was actually impressed with the burger. It was very tasty with just the perfect amount of ketchup, mustard and pickles. The fries were golden and hot as well.

I was helped by Brittney. I never remember names from fast food joints, but caught her name because she has awesome customer service skills. She noticed my name badge, called me by name and asked how my day was.

I told her it was a very busy day at work and that I was feeling under the weather. When I left, she said &quot;I hope your day gets a little less crazy and hope you feel better, Veronica.&quot; They&apos;re so nice here!

I also noticed they serve their rootbeer on tap in an icy cold mug. Sweet! I will definitely be back for that and one of their tasty burgers!

You couldn&apos;t pay me to come back to this place. Reasons why?

1. Horrible service
2. Cold chicken
3. Ordered grilled got fried
4. Flat soda
5. Came in to get my order fixed and was denied
6. Called to complain to the manager and got hung up on
7. Called back and they had disconnected their phone

If you want someone to crap into a buckit and serve it to you for fifteen dollars by all means come here. If you want real local BBQ go to Little Lous in campbell. As far as SJ goes its hard to find anything better than that here.

Draft A&amp;W rootbeer right from the tap...yummy!

Place can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner hours but the service was fast and friendly.

Food is pretty standard for A&amp;W / KFC, can&apos;t complain.

Yo Vanessa...wasssup!

I worked at KFC about 10 years ago as a teenager. I thought my store was the best store around, but I&apos;ve just been proven wrong...it&apos;s a Wednesday night&amp;they&apos;re slammed. Everyone was super polite&amp;I even got a compliment on my hair color. Very quick service&amp;so so nice! I&apos;ve never really been impressed enough by a fast food place to post a Yelp review. Thanks guys!!

This time my boyfriend and I came , I ordered a burger. He got his exactly how he liked it, plain... no mayo, lettuce, onions, etc. Me on the other hand, I love everything on my burger, and I was very disappointed. The mayo they put on it was very sour. It was either way over expiration date or stored incorrectly, which ever, it made my tummy turn.

Everything else was great, but I just had to take a star off for the yucky mayo!!!

This is a KFC- A&amp;W and its delicious!!! The employees are so nice and seriously always happy. This place is right next to my house and my BF loves their root beer floats so he always wants to come. The staff is always nice and they always fix their mistakes with a smile. The food is good. I love A&amp;W, I used to live by the one in Sunnyvale but it closed so this place is AWESOME. And the coupons that come in the mail are pretty good.

1 thing this place needs is a drive-thru. Otherwise its all good.

Five stars at a KFC? Nah, this is mostly for the A&amp;W half of the store!

My boyfriend and I loved our junky and cheap food today. After craving A&amp;W for ages and not finding one near us, this was a happy find. We ordered the 20 piece hot wings from the KFC half, and from the A&amp;W half ordered a cheeseburger, chili cheese fries (minus the cheese), root beer float, and a 5 piece of mini corn dogs. The food was SO good - junky in all the right ways. The root beer float was amazing - and I love that the root beer, both regular and diet, come on tap. And the mugs are so cute. YUM!

Ok this place could be the blueprint for other fast food restaurants. I walked in and was met at the counter by Brittany who should win some kind of award for customer service. She made excellent suggestions and was just pleasant to talk to. This particular kfc is also an a&amp;w which means that the root beer is phenomenal ( and it totally was) will most definitely come here again

I know, it&apos;s a fast-food place and I&apos;m giving it 4 stars! I can hardly believe it myself!

We&apos;ve come here on a few separate occasions, but I usually eat from the KFC side of the menu. It is decent, but now I recommend ordering from the A&amp;W side instead. We came here on a Sunday since the hubba likes root beer -- and was craving a frothy cold one. I love that they pull an ice cold glass out of the freezer case for you to fill up, and it&apos;s unlimited refills. Sweet.

The customer service has always been nice, the workers we&apos;ve encountered seem to be happy and willing to serve.

The food from A&amp;W is made with an old-fashioned kind of sensibility. I had the Chili Coney dog with cheese and fries (yummers, pretty good fries) and our dining companions got burgers with onion rings (which I tried, not super oily and tasty!). Then I got a Root Beer Float to top my meal off. Not sure if they really froze my ice cream well or what ... the ice cream stuck around for a while and didn&apos;t melt into oblivion! It was creamy and delicious even at the last few bites. SCORE!

And the best part of the whole place? The FREE digital juke box that plays all the old hits -- I could sit there for a good while cueing up my favorites to play. A little Beach Boys, Jackson 5, Otis Redding and Gladys Knight to round off that cool glass of chilled root beer ... YES.

I didn&apos;t know this place even existed.
I came here with a group of friends since they were craving root beer from tap.
I was quite excited about drinking A&amp;W root beer from tap and it turned out to be really good. Actually, so good i couldn&apos;t drink it anymore.
The root beer was really really sweet.  My chef friend who came with us believed that they use real cane sugar in the root beer they had there. If this is so, then that&apos;s really cool.
I ordered the coney chili cheese dog, not that great.
The fries though are really good.  The seasoning they put on them is delicious.
The thing i loved about this place was the root beer in those chilled mugs, the fries, and the atmosphere.
I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll go out of my way to come back here, but it was definitely an experience.

This is a nice location and our server was super nice. The economy is in the tank but this fast food worker was as cool as could be.

I&quot;ve eaten here before and not had a problem but last night....oooh, not so good. I got the grilled chicken sandwich, side salad, and water.  Um, my bun...something was weird. LIke it had been buttered and grilled and then flattened before being used.  The chicken was bland, no mustard or mayo...my lettuce was super wilted and the tomoato was fibrous. I know I&apos;m sounding like it was horrible but I was surprised at how jacked up a simple chicken sandwich could be.  Opened my salad...same wilted lettuce. couldn&apos;t eat it...just looking at the lettuce made my stomach turn. I don&apos;t have a weak stomach either. Anyway, I didn&apos;t get sick or anything so that&apos;s good.

OKAY.. I know it&apos;s a fast food place, but um.. the customer service here is TOP NOTCH! haha

My bf&amp;I came in here last night to get a last minute potluck dish of 30 hot wings. First of all, we just wanted to get it and go, but everyone was so nice we were willing to wait.

Right after our order was put in, someone from the back quickly notified that 10 of our wings would still take an extra 9 mins. With that type of consideration, we were willing to wait.

On top of that, we had ordered the 5pc mini corndogs (99 cents) &apos;cos I was already super hungry... plus I wanted to cross examine them with the ones sold at Wienerschnitzel (which suck, btw). We asked if we could have those as we waited and the cashier said, &quot;Sure! Would you like a drink while you wait!?&quot; Me&amp;my bf looked at each other in shock and accepted the free drink :) WHAT SERVICE!!!!

In the end, we actually got our wings&amp;corndogs at the same time (less than 10 minutes), but that didn&apos;t bother us much since we had a drink!

While we were waiting, we were proclaiming how great of a place it was considering the customer service as well as it being a fast food stop! I kept listing all the positives:

&quot;Courteous staff, great customer service... and cl- .. fairly clean floors&quot; ;)

Another example of customer service I noticed at the KFC/A&amp;W:
Right next to us, a guy had asked how many pieces of cornbread he could get for $2.

The girl at the cash register said, &quot;You can get 4 for $2.15, but don&apos;t worry about the 15 cents..&quot; and then the girl ringing us up took 15 cents out of her own pocket to cover the expense!! :) AWWWWW...

Usually employees at other fast food places are downtrodden about having to work in fast food, but here, you don&apos;t have to worry about snappy, fake, or monotonous cashiers&amp;such! Here, their general attitude is genuine and sweet :)

I wanted a Rootbeer float and found out that there&apos;s an A&amp;W in San Jose!

I stopped in to ordered and began listening to a conversation between the workers and an customer about his ethnicity.  Rude? Nope, just funny ass HELL.  I just remember it ending with the customer smiling saying &quot;I&apos;m not Chinese. I used to be Vietnamese. Now I&apos;m American!&quot;

The two staff treated me and my friend just as great. Its not often you get great customer service at a fast food joint.  It seems as the staff remembers a lot of the customers that walk in too.

Oh, the floats...almost forgot. Mother Effin bomb diggity fantastic in a ice cold mug!
Fries from A&amp;W...not so much.

Do you want chicken or a burger? Here, you don&apos;t have to choose. Which makes it a good place for the family, since it&apos;ll generally satisfy everyone&apos;s wants. Their cheese curds are delish, and I love that they have Diet A&amp;W Root Beer on tap. I always ring the bell when I leave.

Root beer floats and burgers.  Reminds me of childhood.  Still unsure about all these reviews about exceptional customer service.  I felt like I was in any other fast food restaurant. I miss the atmosphere of the a&amp;w I grew up with--complete with fire pits etc-- in menlo park.  The root beer floats are still off the hook.  I took mine to go and I am sure it would have been even better had I opted for a frosty mug.

Ever get a craving for that type of food that you just need to have once every couple of months....you know, the greasy, fried stuff.  Yeah, well here it is for me...KFC.  This is actually one of the cooler KFC&apos;s that I&apos;ve been too (yeah I&apos;ve been to a few).  The cashiers are very friendly and funny too, service is fast, and this KFC actually is merged with an A&amp;W so you can get that old fashioned A&amp;W root beer!

KFC recently I know has changed their recipe.  it&apos;s not as deep fried or greasy as before.  Scary thing is, I do miss that taste.

1st came here because San Francisco doesn&apos;t have an A&amp;W and my fiancee and I heard that their root beer floats and off the hook. Honestly THEY ARE! the Root Beer is thick&amp;delicious&amp;they give you a huge amount of soft serve which overflows the cup. Their food is actually really good too. The chili cheese dogs aren&apos;t too salty&amp;their hamburgers are really filling. PLUS it&apos;s connected to a KFC, what else could you want?

4-Star because it is a chain place so probably nothing special.... also they DON&apos;T HAVE ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO :[

2 Stars for the food and the prices. 5 Stars for customer service!!! The food is a bit overpriced and doesn&apos;t fill you up that well. For the KFC meals, you&apos;d better have some of those coupons to use. You do get the root beer in these cool glass mugs. Their root beer is so yum and not as fizzy as they usually are. The burgers were nothing special.

The workers here were the best! There was this dude who danced around as he was doing his job. They are just so spunky and make it seem as if they LOVED their job. Their smiles made my day. That&apos;s how cool they were.

This review is for the service and A&amp;W food. This is my first time going to an A&amp;W and I must say I&apos;m impressed. First off, the service is fantastic! My cashier was Brittany and she is just awesome. My friend and I walk in and Brittany&apos;s energy was electric. She was incredibly helpful, asking me if I was REALLY hungry or just KINDA hungry when I couldn&apos;t decide on what I want. I wound up getting a simple hamburger combo with a root beer float. The food came out fast (rootbeer float took a few extra minutes because they had to change out the rootbeer syrup...totally understandable).

The burger was simple, but great. I was amazed by how good it looked. Usually, you go to fast food places and the burger is dry and the bun smashed. The burger was super good. And the rootbeer float? Forget about it. So much ice cream! A frosty mug! Delicious root beer!

So I happily give this place five stars. Fantastic customer service (Not just Brittany, but the other employees as well), great food, the place was clean, and I will absolutely stop by again. Yum!

When my wife, daughter, and I go here, we never order the chicken.  Not that we think it would be a bad thing.  Its just that the A&amp;W side of the store is so much better.

Having those Root Beer floats in icy mugs, with a Papa Burger and fries, or a Coney Dog.  Seriously, memories flood back of all the times I used to go to A&amp;W before.  And the quality of this food is right up there with the best fast food.  You can find better burgers, for instance, but these are very fresh and tasty.  Of course, for us, the center of the meal is the Root Beer float, and it always delivers.

We never used to go out of our way for fast food before.  We do now, and we never regret it.

Here&apos;s hoping this one is here to stay, with a prayer that another like it will open closer to home.  KFC comes in handy occasionally, but A&amp;W is something altogether better and makes having fast food fun again, and one guilty pleasure that is all too easy to justify.

WOW! Yesterday was my first time ever going to this restaurant.  Me and my husband were actually trying to find where Carl&apos;s JR was since we were craving crisp cut fries and all that stuff but I was also craving Mini Corn Dogs and Honey BBQ Wings. So we couldn&apos;t find it and we ended up passing by KFC and A&amp;W and they had what I wanted!

So we went inside and we were greeted by the cashier while we were just walking in and this is rare in a fast food restaurant. My goodness, I had a lot of questions of how many pieces were there of this and that and he wasn&apos;t annoyed or bothered at all but he just simply answered all my questions.

He always had a smile on his face and he was very enthusiastic. Actually, all the workers were enthusiastic. The person that called my name to get my food was great. One of the boys that were cleaning the table was nice enough that he opened the door for an older man with a cane even though the older man said that he has it but he thanked him anyway.

WOW! This is the ONLY place with the best customer service I have ever experienced. I&apos;m a stay at home mom but if i were to work, I&apos;d work here since the atmosphere is so upbeat and positive.

Great restaurant with very decent food. We hit the A&amp;W side of things, and loved every bite. The staff here are definitely above average. Its obvious that some time and consideration were spent to hire this crew.

The food arrived fresh and prompt. The root beer floats are out of this world. Just remember - turn in your empty mugs before you leave and get a token for a FREE root beer on your next visit!

Excellent combination. I only go to this spot only if I&apos;m in the area. I have to agree w/ Ailien that the employees are crack happy! The food is always fresh as well if this is your cup of tea!

I appreciate any fast food joint with courteous employees. The food is fresh and that means it&apos;s takes a few minutes longer than the average #3, so be patient!

OMG! Two of the dopest fast food joints to combine forces and create the Voltron of fast food joints! I went for the A&amp;W stuff. Root beer, Chili Cheese Fries, Onion Rings, Cheese Curds... OH MAN! I love it. This is the only A&amp;W location left in this area, so if you get the chance, have the time, and an empty stomach, definitely hit this place up!

wow this place was bad for several reasons.

we ordered some chicken..and i had a coupon for two. it was a six piece meal for $8.99. okay. so i ordered. he then charged me 12 dollars...umm..that&apos;s about 3 dollars more than what i wanted to pay. so i asked him why he charged me so much. he did not want give me a receipt and claimed that it was &quot;taxes&quot;. 3 dollars for tax? wtf. okay whatever..the chicken they gave me were tiny ones with no meat. i paid $12 for crap. i am never coming back here again, they do not know what they&apos;re doing.

Pretty tasty double cheese but it&apos;s no in and out. the fries are forgettable. I also feel like it&apos;s expensive considering it&apos;s also a KFC. Not exactly a proper old fashioned burger joint.

I drafted this review and gave it a 3 but by the time I left I gave it another star.
Pretty clean and a good selection of foods. KFC now has grilled chicken but no  grilled chiken strips. That&apos;s what I miss about popeyes.
Why this gets such a high rating for a fast food place is necause the service was quick and all the people were super nice I even got a token for a free root beer just because I brought back their mug.
Usually a 4star review would never go to a place like this (usually saved for in n out or the like) but I liked the small touches too. I ordered some chicken strips with mashed potatoes. The biscuit was really good- not hard. And I could tell it was more fresh than other kfcs I&apos;ve been to.
They have a little bell by the door that says something like ring the bell if you had a good time. I ate for about 20 minutes and I heard that bell ring 8 times. And as I left, I rang it too.

To me, this used to be the best KFC in the area. Its really gone downhill. And if the guy mgr isn&apos;t there (I can&apos;t remember his name but he is freindly&amp;very accomodating) the place is a mess, you wait forever for your food and its usually not as good.The only reason we go anymore is because this is one of the few foods that my son who is Autistic, will eat.

As others have said, most of the employees ARE very friendly except for Tujana I think her name is....I believe shes the Asst. Mgr or something like that. Anyway, she is never friendly and always seems bothered by doing her job.

So the boy wants his usual taters&amp;gravy this morning so we call to find out what time they open. 10am? Perfect. The boyfriend goes and Tujana is inside wandering around and sees the customers waiting out front but still opens the store 10 minutes late!  He gets the taters n gravy home and as per usual, when she is working the gravy is like WATER. Yummy  huh!!

Complaining to the mgr&apos;s doesn&apos;t seem to help as we have complained many times before.  This happens way too often and I think from now on we&apos;ll just make him the instant crap here at home. They charge way too much to give us crappy food.

Sayonara, KFC
