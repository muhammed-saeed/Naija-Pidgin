 “Three Little Words” 
 Posted on September 12, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

Hi dolls!

This post marks my 100th day in Hollywood.  Looking back, I can hardly believe the journey I’ve had.

In 100 days there are 144,000 minutes, 14.2 Wednesdays (if you start on a Sunday) and just about an infinite number of moments when life tugs on your soul to surprise you with how beautiful it all can be (if you let it).

At the close of my last post , I endured perchance the most emotionally challenging weeks of my time in California as my parents circled bankruptcy/separation and I was denied the only actual job for which I’d interviewed.
 
 HIKE TO HOLLYWOOD… 
 
I decided to clear my mind and accepted an invitation from my friend Flory to climb the California hill whose dusty edges are home to the world famous HOLLYWOOD sign.

 Sneakers tightly laced, the two of us began our ascent.  I expected, being relatively obsessed with health and fitness, that I’d have no problem making my way to the top.  Color me surprised, however, when the tissues of my lungs began to feel as if they were consumed in an inferno and each step seemed steeper than the last.  Starting from the base of the hill, you can’t see the sign.  Nonetheless, I pushed forward.  Every time I’d fight to what appeared to be the highest peak, the trail would cut around another curve and I was faced with higher/harder ground to cover.  Sure I had gone as far as I could, I was near the point of halting our climb, but pushing just a bit further we came around a corner and there it was: The Hollywood sign in all it’s classic beauty.  Step by dusty step, the hills grade lessened in severity and soon I was standing as close to those giant white block letters as legally allowed, those same nine letters who have served throughout this entire adventure as a beacon of strength or, perhaps more appropriately, as a searchlight by which to find myself back to hope.

So, I learned, the road to Hollywood is hardest at the start and only those who refuse to quit, who persevere past self-doubt and pain, only those who truly want it ever make it to the top.  A lesson learned at the perfect time as I’d come to desperately need this piece of wisdom to survive the whirlwind of unexpected twists that lay in wait before me.
 
 HOLD MY HAND… 
 
I have a confession to make.  Well, not so much a confession as that implies guilt, but rather a revelation.  There are a few details about Ace and our relationship that I kept to myself, but in keeping with my desire to be entirely forthcoming with you, it is only right that you know the whole story.  You might be surprised to learn (especially after last summer’s closested affair with JD who hid our heated encounters behind car doors and nighttime) that Ace is not entirely…”exactly”… totally .. out of the closet.  I vowed after everything I’d learned last summer to never again date a man who was not fully open with himself and his family.  At 37 years-old (yes, 15 years my senior), Ace has only recently discovered his attraction to men and few beyond his two closest friends know.  I found myself, however, unable to resist his beautiful mind, caring soul and passionate kisses so that, flashing forward a month after being together, Ace and I decided to spend the day at Santa Monica Beach.

The weight of our bodies pressing into the sand, I felt the sea’s breath traverse the highways of my skin and I couldn’t help but feel like the salted air brought with it an internal shift. As we strolled down the 3rd Street Promenade back to our car, I felt an intense urge to hold Ace’s hand followed by an equally intense sadness at the thought that if I reach my fingers to his, he’d likely pull away for fear of being outed.  In that instant, I hoped with every pulse of my heart that he’d brave the fight, the fear, take my hand and in doing so prove himself to me, to us.  He did not.  The moment his car door closed, however, he was quick to lean in for a kiss.  I couldn’t do it.”I deserve,”I said,“someone who will hold my hand, who wants to be mine and for me to be his.  I don’t want to flaunt it down the streets of Los Angeles, but should there come a moment when I’m looking into your eyes and I feel my heart swell so large that my chest leans forward for a kiss I want to be able to press my lips to yours.  I don’t want to be the reason you come out because it’s your process, your journey.  When I decided to come out I was able to do it on my terms and when I was ready.  You deserve the same.  Maybe we’re just in too different of a place.”Ace promised he was taking steps towards coming out and asked simply for more time.  My mind and heart went to war, each stationed at opposite ends of my character and fight as logic might it was, for the moment, my heart that won.
 
 TWO WEEKS NOTICE… 
 
I awoke that Monday morning running late for my internship, leapt into my car and felt my stomach plummet to the garage floor at the sight of that taunting orange gas light: EMPTY .  Out of gas, I was also, unfortunately, out of money; or so I thought, as a small light went off in my mind and I remembered a change jar I stashed away in my closet.  I sorted copper from silver and was stunned to count $13 in quarters.  Using $10 for gas, I saved the remaining $3 for the lunch I’d eat later that day off of a Dollar Menu.  It became blatantly clear that I could no longer bare my diet of Dentine Ice&amp;Diet Coke, that Suite #201 had no intentions of taking our relationship to the next level and that it was time for me to make my exit.  Jack, Ari and Matt offered their usual promises of employment down the line, but there’s something eye-opening about releasing a hand-full of coins onto a counter and meekly washing down a meager meal with free water whilst seated in the corner of a fast food restaurant located in the lavish Beverly Hills.  I couldn’t stay any longer.  Frightened as I was to leave my internship, I felt a peculiar sense of calm.  I was going to be okay.

 A week later, the courier came by the office to deliver the post like he did everyday prior; this time, however, the large box he placed on my desk was for me .  Sent from Dolán, I was completely surprised to find a large bubble-wrapped rectangle inside.  Peeling back the noisy layers of protective air, I literally gasped.  In front of my lay a smaller version of a painting I’d fallen in love with whilst out to the movies with Dolán.  I remember telling him how beautiful it was and how, one day when I had the money, I’d buy it.  I couldn’t believe he’d remembered, I couldn’t believe he’d sent me my very own, I couldn’t believe the letter he’d place inside .  Unfolding the halved white paper, I followed the flowing curves of his cursive which read: 

 

 Estevan- 

 This is my heart laid bare.  You loved this painting.  And I love you. 

 I commissioned the artist, Leah Devorah, to make this print of“Marilyn Controversy’for you, which she mounted on canvas. 

 It’s not the original, but some day, when we take over the world, you’ll have it all. 

 I hope it finds a special place on your wall, and in your heart. 

 Undying love, Dolán 

 We’d only known each other for such a short time, but there was a kinship of our souls whose bond would lead you to believe we’d known each other for a lifetime.  Our conversations consisted not of gossip or commonplace chatter, but were instead composed of lengthy expressions detailing our shared passion to write great words.  We’d promised to take over the world together.  How now was I supposed to proceed?  Return the painting?  End the friendship?  Dolán was the only friend I had in this city; had I lost that forever?  Moreover, here was an insanely talented/beautifully caring man who had commissioned an artist (do we live in Renaissance Italy?) and I had hopelessly fallen for a man who couldn’t yet hold my hand in public. 

 After a phone call later that evening, however,  Dolán and I had managed to mend our friendship.  Agreeing that neither of us wanted to lose the bond we’d shared, he vowed to do his best with the feelings he’d developed and I’d promised to tread lightly.  Having been in Dolán’s situation too many times before, I can’t help but dread the future of our friendship… 
 
 DEAL WITH IT… 
 
Having reached the point where quarters and dimes were my means of living, I couldn’t begin imagine how I was to find $400 for September’s rent.  Much like my savings jar rescued me, if only for a short bit of time, a phone call from an old friend would do the same in a big way.  Alex had heard that I was desperate for money and when he couldn’t keep his commitment to P.A. (production assistant) an Xbox commercial, he offered my name in substitution.  And what would you know, the gig was two days long and paid $200/day.  Yep, $400.  I tossed Destiny a smirk, grateful to survive another month…if, that was, I could survive two days on set.

I f you are entirely unfamiliar with production sets, those brave/foolish/desperate enough to take on a P.A. position are often viewed as on-set slaves.  If they need something unloaded, you do it.  If they need something cleaned, you do it.  If they need someone to yell at, you better not cry on set.

Some might see me and mistakenly assume that I am allergic to manual labor, but I arrived at Venice Beach (our location for the shoot) eager to bust my ass.  As physically exhausting as the 14 hour days were, it was the wrath of Cinnamon that drained me of all remaining strength.  A well-accomplished producer, Cinnamon was the furtherest thing from well-mannered.  Let it not be confused, my skin is tough.  I’ve worked for bosses who hurl boxes of paperclips, who scream at me in a manner my mother would never consider in her angriest moment.  I can take it.  I do not, however, deal well with bullshit.  Through all of Cinnamon’s antics (telling the bus driver to leave me behind, sending me on 3 hour goose chases, turning away when I’d ask if there was something with which I could help her), I couldn’t help but mentally scream What would your mother say?! 

 TIP # 39: People will hate you. Deal with it. 

I spent the better part of my first day on set wondering what it was I had done to cause such abhorrence in Cinnamon.  The answer? Nothing.  There was nothing I could do to change it and moreover, I shouldn’t care.  Looking up from the beach parking lot that served as our base camp, I took in a stunning view.  I allowed the world’s natural beauty to remind me that, despite how hard people like Cinnamon might try, goodness exists around me and within me; I won’t be broken.
 
 I LOVE YOU… 
 
I spent the weekend recuperating mentally/physically from the strain of set life, awaking in the arms of Ace on a Sunday morning that couldn’t have come soon enough.  We enjoyed breakfast at a nearby cafe and as our feel shuffled along a sidewalk made to be traveled by two, I couldn’t help but long for his affection.  He, of course, waited until we were back on his couch to offer it.  And then it happened.  Seated on that same black leather couch upon which we’d shared our first kiss it became heart-rendingly clear that we, that us, that Ace and I were breaking up.

I looked into his Hazel eyes, noticing those sunbursts of gold that stole the breath from my lungs; my gaze traveled down his rugged, stubble-shaded features and came to rest on his lips.  Beginning in my gut, the words fought up to my heart and beat their way to my vocal cords.  I parted my lips and betwixt them sailed three words I’d never said to anyone. The thought of spending a day without him, the idea of never kissing him again, never seeing his mischievous grin, the thought of me without him hurt my heart.  And then it happened.  From betwixt his lips came three words I’d never heard before.  A hand held down some sidewalk would come. Today , we were in love.
 
 THE EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT… 
 
I floated into work the following day, my last ever at Suite #201 .  Perched behind that same oak desk, I couldn’t help but think back to my first days as an intern.  Despite the fact that this gamble hadn’t resulted in a job, there was no denying the immense amounts I’d learn in such a short time.  I decided to show my gratitude and arrange a back room that had become over run with boxes of files and mounds of cords.  After heaving files cabinets, lugging totes of scripts and untangling miles of cords, I took a look around the room with pride.

 TIP #40: Give‘em something to remember you by. 

 Today would be my last, but seeing such a transformation ensured that, even if for only a few months, the partners would enter this office space and be reminded of the fervor with which I worked.  The sun began to take refuge behind crisp corners of the Beverly Hills skyline and I prepared to take my leave when there took place what can only be 
 described as an explosive end to a tumultuous relationship.  A meeting of the partners was held and at it’s end Ari and Matt had been let go from Suite #201 with the company returning to representing only writers and directors.  Not only was it my last day, Ari and Matt would exit stage left as well. 

Still reeling from the unexpected turn of events, I stood in my kitchen recanting the day’s shocking twist to my Aunt Josie when my phone rang and from it came news I could hardly believe.  Hollywood legend and partner of Suite #201 , M, was calling to offer me a job as the Executive Assistant to Suite #201 .  In letting go of Ari and Matt, M had freed up funds he viewed better spent hiring me.  It had been, in the end, my last day as an intern of Suite #201 because from hence forth I would be an Executive Assistant.
 
 BACK TOGETHER AGAIN… 
 
Prior to the great news, I had scheduled a 5 day trip back home to Arizona  for the Labor Day week(end).  While originally planned as desperate return to a place where life was easier, when I was surer of myself and my future, my vacation was now more celebratory in nature.  I was returning home a man with a job.

It was after midnight when I arrived in Phoenix and while I’d only been gone for fewer than 100 days, my body had acclimated to the California breeze and was ill-prepared for the flesh warming heat present even at such a late hour.  Regardless, I was home.  My mom opened the door and, bags in hand, I literally gasped as I stepped into a home I did not recognize.  Mountains of excess and what can only be described as stuff consumed the room in such a manner that it left only a narrow path by which to travel.  I had no words.  Snaking through the house, I was stunned to see a refrigerator cluttered with papers magneted to it and a dinning table swallowed by coupons.  Stacks and stacks of coupons.  Needing a moment to myself, I walked quietly to my bedroom only to be taken further aback.

My old bedroom had become lost somewhere between a memory of who I once was and a storage unit that housed rows of shelves upon which was organize a stockpile of goods.  100 tubes of toothpaste.  50 bottles of soap.  Toothbrushes.  Air-fresheners. Stuff .  My mother, I learned, had taken to extreme couponing like a neglected housewife to an affair.  She had, she explained, received nearly the entirety of her stockpile for free.  I tried to see her latest hobby as an innovative means to help my family financially, but the literal volume of goods felt as though it were suffocating me.  My eyes began to burn with emotion and I left the room pained by the following question: How lonely (with my father addicted to work, with no real friends upon which to lean) must my mother be to need so much stuff for her home to feel less empty?  Moments later I stood in the kitchen starring at a vocabulary test and report card covered fridge.  Tracing down the my eyes came to rest on a made-by-hand Humpty Dumpty.  It became painfully clear how much I had missed.  So focused on getting a job, I failed to realize that I may very well take over the world in 10 years, but what’s it worth if the people I love get left behind?  My life in Arizona had fallen a part; before it’s too late, could I put it back together?
 
 TUCSON, MEET ACE… 
 
A few days later, I drove the two hours south to Tucson, Arizona, eager to reconnect with the beautiful friends I missed so very much while living in LA.  The 30 mile per hour speed limits used to drive me crazy, the choice between 5 bars once felt like a straight jacket, but now I welcomed the simplicity of Tucson.  I was in need of familiar, of small, of peace.  And perhaps the best part?  Ace had purchased a one way ticket to Tucson.  We would spend our 2 Month Anniversary together and in Arizona.

It had only been a day since I’d seen his face, but when I spotted him standing on the airport curb, I couldn’t help but feel like we’d been reunited after a lifetime apart.  We drove, for it was far too hot to walk, around the city.  I showed him campus.  My old apartment.  Introduced him to friends and Fraternity Brothers before traveling the scorching foothills of Tucson to the stunning 4,500 square foot house we’d be lucky enough to stay in (courtesy of a house-sitting Fraternity Brother). 

Showered and changed, Ace and I chased the setting sun to Blanco’s where I’d arranged a dinner at which he could meet some of my closest friends.  Seated beneath hanging light bulbs and our thirst quenched by chilly margaritas, it happened that the man I loved got along beautifully with the friends I loved.  Would, however, the same be true tomorrow when Ace showed up on the doorstep of my parent’s home in Phoenix?

I had never taken a guy home to my parents.  It wasn’t that they were ashamed of having a gay son; they were doing the best they could with what they had.  The case was more that I’d never met a man worthy of my family.  Until I’d met Ace.

We tripped on a little road, did a little road-tripping, and soon I was turning the corner of Wood Lane and upto my driveway.  A million thoughts/questions/fears sprinted through my mind: What would Ace think of my mother’s hobby ? What if my parents thought Ace was too old? If this didn’t go well, what would that mean for Ace and my future–DING DONG–too late now, we were here.

To my amazement, my parents had spent my time in Tucson cleaning and the house looked beautiful.  Maybe the talk I’d had with my mother had sunken in.  I led Ace to a  kitchen I hardly recognized where he met my mother…my father…my little brother and kid sister for the very first time.  It wasn’t until my mom cracked a joke with Ace that realized I’d been holding my breath.  Over a huge family dinner including aunts and uncles and cousins, I watched as the man I loved got along beautifully with the family I loved.  I couldn’t help but think back to my 16 year-old self (closeted, 60 lbs heavier, lonely, drowning) and think of how happy he’d be to see me now.  I feel asleep that night in the arms of Ace, our bodies sprawled across my adolescent bed, and to Fate I let my soul whisper:… thank you .
 
 YOU MADE IT… 
 
The following morning Ace, Josie and I sped across the distance between Phoenix and Los Angeles, between the past and the future.  Come Monday morning, I took to being the Executive Assistant to Suite #201 quite well so that by the end of the week I couldn’t believe I was holding my very first real paycheck.  I looked out from the office window and saw the Hollywood sign smiling back at me……

 There exists, along the path to the Hollywood sign, a smaller sign which offers just three little words: You made it .  The post upon which it rests over looks not the Hollywood sign, but the city.  Positioned at the point where the climb becomes less arduous, the sign’s city view works as if to remind you that the view from the top is stunning, yes, but never forget to stop and look around from right where you stand.  You’ll get to where you’re going, but love where you are because you’ll only be there once. 

…..holding that check I couldn’t help but feel like I’d earned my You made it sign.  I’ve got so many more things I want to achieve, but for now I can’t help but appreciate just how fucking lucky I am to have: the family, the man, the job, the passion and, after 22 years in the finding, myself.

I’d like to say thank you , from the very sweetest place in my heart, for coming along on this wild adventure.  Through the tears and the triumphs, you were there.  Thank you.

If you have a dream, no matter how grand or unlikely, no matter what those around you say, whether you’re 5, 15 or 55 GO OUT AND CHASE IT!!!  You only get one life.  Just one.  More immediately, you only get today and if today were all you got, how would you spend it?  Fill your life with beautiful nouns (persons, places or things), start with yourself and grow from there.

 “Like A Skyscraper” 
 Posted on August 9, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

Hello guys and dolls!

Can you believe that today is the 70th day of this crazy adventure in Hollywood?  Looking back, it truly does astound me how much has happened in hardly over two month’s time.

When we last spoke I had broken down in tears upon the 405 after learning that my current unpaid internship had no intention of hiring me.  After some soul searching, I fought up from my doubt’s twisted undercurrent into the glowing light of growth.

Sadly, however, (or perhaps not sadly at all) my time in the sun would be cut short by the arrival of a gray cloud….

In keeping this blog, I’ve been faced with a journalist’s quandary: Where is the line between public story and private life?

I feel as though because you give of your time, open yourself up to my adventure, well, you hold the right to experience this roller-coaster of a life in it’s rawest, truest form.  Nothing withheld.

That said, on the final day of my mother’s visit to Los Angeles she shared with me news that, as each jagged word fell from her mouth, I could feel them land razor-sharp on my heart, breaking it: My parents are essentially drowning in debit and their marriage has long sunk to the quaggy land of love lost or forgotten.

I returned to my internship the following day in an attempt to cling onto some semblance of normal.  However, a meeting with a high-profile client pulled my bosses out of the office and I found myself in front of my desk, alone and paralyzed.  Suddenly yanking the black receiver to my ear, my fingers dialed out to my college friend Jayce (an Amy Adams doppelganger with a mastery of quips).  Her delicate voice delivered words that snuck past my emotional barricades the way only an old friend could manage and before I could prevent otherwise, searing tears traversed the steep slopes of my cheeks and tumbled down towards the anger that now knotted my throat.

I couldn’t believe I was crying at my desk.

Hours later my bosses returned and I welcomed the distraction as we continued to work well past sundown, but soon my head pounded in pain from squinting to see because I can’t afford to fill my new vision prescription.  Ready for the day to be over, I hardly could have expected what happened next.

“Estevan?”Matt called from behind his office wall.  My notebook in hand,“Yeah?”“So it looks like we’ve double-booked for tonight.  We’re supposed to have drinks but we agreed to attend this showcase. Can you go?”

Exhausted from looming bankruptcy, heartbroken over my parents’marriage gone asunder, suffering from a headache and crippled by a lack of vision, I did what any struggling starry-eyed intern would do:“Yeah, totally.”This was my chance, I thought, to show them that I am capable of doing more.  The fact that they trusted me to represent the company showed promise; if I could bring in any undiscovered stars I might prove myself an asset to the company and potentially, just maybe, they’d hire me on.

After weaving betwixt stand-still cars down Santa Monica Boulevard, I soon found myself utterly inspired as I sat in a chilly black box theatre holding a binder of head  shots and watched actors perform a series of two-person scenes.  There’s just something about live theatre.  It’s as if within the square feet of the windowless yet drafty room anything is possible.

I collapsed onto my bed, finally home from a 15-hour day, and stared at my ceiling lit by the urine-colored light spilling out from gaps left by my bathroom door, which hinges crookedly ajar.  My only thought? I have a popcorn ceiling .

When I was a kid I had a popcorn ceiling.  I remember that I wanted those glow-in-the-dark stars, but the man at the store said they wouldn’t stick.  My dad, being the kind of man he is, sprayed water on the ceiling and, with a spackle spatula, fought through the mess to bring me the stars.  I couldn’t fight it back any longer and the weight of the day broke the embankment to my emotions.  If I had cried earlier, I was weeping now.

How was it that I was breaking down again?

I took to avoiding the problems all together, changing the subject whenever a (boy)friend inquired because the knowledge that my life here and back home had fallen apart was too much to handle.  Just two days later, however, life would surprise me yet again.

In a single day I received the following news:

 A) My awkwardly adorable Jewish friend Ben’s mother passed along a Family&amp;Friend’s discount that cut the cost of my eyeglasses by 50% 

 B) Dolán contacted a friend and I was to have an interview for the Executive Assitant position to an Academy-Award winning Producer/CEO 

 C) My stylist/Nordstrom’s intern, Robinson, tossed my name into a focus group, earning me a gift card worth $250 

I found myself in tears again, but this time the drop that splashed against my bottom lip and seeped onto my taste buds was not bitter, but sweet.

 Tip #37: Say Thank You. 

 

I am not blinded enough by my own ego to think I’ve done a lot for Ben in return or It was my resume that landed the interview or I allowed Robinson to live with me for the summer .  Instead I’m filled with gratitude for the beautiful people in my life, so much so that it began to overflow from my eyes.
 
The next day I opened a package delivered from Salt Lake City, Utah, and more specifically, from my dancer friend Becca whose grace is matched equally be her intellect.  Inside was our G.C.B. (gourmet cookbook), a hand-decorated notebook filled with recepies.

On our final day together in Arizona, Becca, Jayce and myself stood atop a Tucson hill over looking the city at sunset and made a promise that as we moved to our separate cities to pursue our dreams (Pittsburgh, Chicago and Los Angeles respectively), we’d reunite at least once a year.   During the in-between we’d pass along a CD with music to play as we cooked each others recipes .  It was as if two of the most talented women I know were with me as I prepared Scallion and Mushroom Polenta, Roasted Rosemary Grape Tomatoes with a Mixed Green Salad and an Herb Garlic Bread. 

 

 Tip #38: Cook yourself one meal a week. 

Come the end of the week, Ace and I celebrated his birthday.  I was determined to make his special night as wonderfully breathtaking as he made mine.  The thought of a home-baked cake turned into attempted mini brownie bites which burned and whose charred chocolate was crumbled, layered between vanilla cream and fresh strawberries in a sugar sauce and served as a trifle.  We enjoyed the desert on his couch, but only after we shared (along with Tom Felton who sat a few tables away) a delicious meal at my new favorite restaurant Pace .  Considering my tough financial state, dinner and a rescued dessert were all I could afford.  Judging by the heat of his kiss, I don’t think he was disappointed.

One week ago exactly, I dipped out from my internship and found myself waiting for the elevator to the 
 the 6th floor for my interview. This , I thought, was it .  I had been waiting for the chance to finally share my passion in person.  Confident in my charm, I was positive I’d get the job offer.

I left, however, oddly disappointed.  The company was offering less than I knew I was worth, doing work in an area I knew wasn’t my passion.  How could it be possible that I begged the universe for a job, any job , here it was and I was actually considering declining?

I returned to my internship and my bosses confirmed what my intuition was screaming: Don’t.Do.It. Let us , they said, asked around to some of our friends .  The following day, I did just the same and met up with AJ, a friend I met last summer who now works for a major studio. 

 As we zoomed up the hills of the lot in a golf cart and watched as families passed by on tour trollies, I couldn’t help but wonder how long it would take me until I reached my precipice?  Surely, declining job offers would do anything but help me.  Right?

And just this past Friday I recieved my answer.  The company with which I interviewed thanked me for my time, but apologized as they had gone with someone who had“more marketing experience.”I couldn’t believe that I teeter-tottered between whether or not to take a job I didn’t even have offered to me.

This time, however, I didn’t break.  While of course I was disappointed, and the loss of the potential income only makes my financial situation that much more dire, I couldn’t help but wink at Fate.  The interview had come at just the right moment.  I had begun to doubt that I’d ever be snag an interview with anyone and once I finally did, not only did it renew my confidence, it reminded me of what it is I came here to do: My passion burns on paper, its smoke curls to form words, is fueled by inked and fanned by a promise never to give up.  I’m a writer. 

My parents, it seems, will be alright.  Love and marriage are two treasures some are lucky enough to hold in their lifetime, few are blessed to hold both and even fewer are strong enough to never let go.  My parents might just be two of the fewer.

And as far as my next career step?  Well, Jack held his word and asked around to some of his college buddies.  I am, thanks to him, to have coffee at Paramount next week with a staff writer for a hit comedy show.  Best case scenario lands me a job, worst case scenario earns me a friend and either scenario is very much welcomed.  So as I said at the start of this post: Perhaps my time in the sun cut short wasn’t sad at all.  I’m stronger.  Wiser.  Hungrier.  A better man.  As I drove home today, the radio played a song whose lyrics struck a cord on the strings of my heart.  I’ll close with them:

 You can take everything I have 
 You can break everything I am 
 Like I’m made of glass 
 Like I’m made of paper 
 Go on and try to tear me down 
 I will be rising from the ground 
 Like a skyscraper.

 “Set Your Soul Ablaze” 
 Posted on July 15, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

It truly does amaze me how crazy this adventure has been.

At the close of my last post, life had taken a turn for the beautiful and I was really feeling as though I were exactly where I was meant to be.

On Saturday, I attended The Motion Picture Industry Institute ‘s Summer Intern“Welcome to Hollywood BBQ.”I had received an email from M back at last summer’s internship on Sunset about MPII’s networking event, letting me know that I and a plus 1 were on the guest list.  Taking place a park near The Grove, I invited my stylist/friend, Robinson, who is interning at Nordstrom.

Over 125+ interns from companies including but not limited to Disney, CAA, WME, ICM and MGM were in attendance.  Floating from cluster to cluster, Robinson and I made sure to follow Tip #8 but others did not.

 

 Tip # 34: Don’t do quickies; it’s trashy. 

Think of networking as if it were dating.  Some interns had hardly let their business cards slip from the grip of their fingers before jetting off to the next potential connection.  No one likes to be left feeling cheap and used.   I felt much more comfortable, and in the long run, much more willing to help those at the mixer who had taken the time to genuinely converse with me.  As Dolán often says,“It’s not about now; it’s about five years from now.”However, speaking about the“now,”I was admittedly embarrassed that I attended a networking mixer without business cards.

 Tip #35: Get business cards. 

For about $20 bucks with VistaPrint, I made a simple card with a stunning blue backside that I can use until I land a job that issues them on my behalf. 

The following day I whipped up a very important and equally delicious meal that consisted of Lemon Pepper Chicken, Cayenne Corn&amp;Rosemary Herb Potatoes as Ace was coming over to meet my aunt.  I couldn’t help but want everything to go perfectly.  What if she didn’t like him? Or him, her?

Luckily, the two hit it off great and shortly after dinner, I led Ace to a secret surprise.

On the roof of my building, I had laid out a sunset picnic complete with battery-operated candles impervious to the Californian breeze and handmade chocolate-dipped strawberries with our initials piped in white chocolate.  My back pressed against the concrete edge of my building’s rooftop, his back leaned against my chest, we watched as the setting sun burned the sky crimson and canary and azure, like a blanket of jewels for our eyes only.

 

Later that week, as I have quickly burned through my savings, I was both beyond grateful and immensely embarrassed to receive the help of my parents.  I was fine accepting their financial support whilst in college, but as a 22 year-old graduate living with my aunt, I felt more like a failure asking for their help.

Imagine, however, my mortification as I stood in line at Target and had a toothbrush, mouthwash and body soap, totaling no more than $9.68, snatched out of my hand by the cashier who all too eagerly called out“insufficient funds.”

Somewhere in the haze of happiness induced by last week’s birthday festivities and career victories, I flippantly spent my parent’s hard-earned money on foolish items like an over-priced (albeit well worn) haircut and clothes I justified by saying“Oh, it’s for work.”

 Tip #36: Budget. Budget. Budget. 

With my tail betwixt my legs and a knot of shame lodged within my throat, I left behind the bag of goods I should have been able to afford and arrived to work this Monday ready to redeem myself in anyway possible.

I’ve been going above and beyond, in any manner possible, at Suite #201 ; the exhaustion brought along with it has been welcome because I had the vision of turning this internship into a well-paying job.  Floating around the office, there went the hints of a secret: Suite #201 was going to be re-launching and re-branding the entire company.  I figured what better news than the opportunity to pitch myself, including all of my potential and all of the tasks I’ve managed to complete in a short amount of time, to the newly-named company partners.

Desperate for redemption (or, perhaps, validation), I let slip on Monday my desire to be hired on as an assistant and was left feeling like my stomach had sunk down to the streets of Beverly Hills as Ari uttered the following words: We’d love to hire you on, really, we would, but that’s just not financially possible. And I don’t know when it will be. 

Shortly after, on my drive home, I sat stuck in traffic along the 4o5 and I couldn’t  have felt more lost.  Not only had I been told No , had I been told Not ever ?

Needing to talk to someone from back home, I called my college buddy Jesse.  Anyone who has ever called him knows that when he misses a call, his voicemail consists of him singing this ridiculous song.  When I was back home being sent to his voicemail drove me crazy, but this time it was the final crack that sent my emotional dam asunder.  Tears cascaded from my bloodshot eyes and my heart tangled itself within my vocal cords as images of home, of how easy and safe and simply it all once was played against the ash clouds that had formed in my mind.

Some say you are given just what you need, exactly when you need it.  In my case, I must have needed home as I walked in from such an exhausting journey to find my mom standing in my kitchen.  She, my family and one of my best friends drove in from Arizona to visit for the week.  Still feeling guilty for having carelessly driven myself broke, I pushed those feelings aside and let the safety of my mom’s hug inundate my senses.

I’ve spent the past two days lost in thought and I’ve come to realize that chasing after your dreams is like crossing a rushing river:

 Frigid water bites my toes as I take refuge on the nearest stone.  The opposing bank is draped in lush greens and the shade from luxurious trees stretching towards a sky so blue it nearly pains my eyes to take it in; even the sunshine seems to beam straight from the heavens.  That is where I want to be.  Looking down, I see I haven’t ventured an inch further.  Whether out of fear or uncertainty or both, I remain perched upon the same burgundy stone.  Suddenly I notice the icy river has begun to rise, it’s water sourced from the tears of my soul.  It would be sad to drown; it would be a sin against passion to never try at all.  I testingly place my foot on surrounding stones, unsure of what step to next take.  Once no higher than my ankle, the turbulent water has risen to above my waist.  Finally, I force my foot forward onto a tar-colored rock.  It gives out from under me and in an instant I am plunged into the arctic waters.  It is then I notice that I’ve strapped myself with pounds, with literal tons of ambition and the weight of it all has begun to pull me under the ever-rising waters.  Fight as I may, I am barely able to remain afloat.  The smallest, the briefest of rests would yank me under, would suffocate me.  I realize then, that this absolutely exhausting struggle is necessary because as my legs kick incessantly, my arms flail endlessly, my lungs burn from a lack of oxygen, as I FIGHT, as I cause my body’s temperature to rise, to BURN, I will ignite myself.  My soul will be set ablaze and if I can continue to persevere, the water will evaporate, molecule by molecule until the last drop becomes air.  It is then that I will stand on the banks of my dreams, look around and know my true self. 

So when it comes to your dreams, you don’t have to know the secret constellation of rocks that will guide you carefree across the water, you just have to have the courage to take the first step, the perseverance to survive the fight and the passion to set your soul ablaze.

 “Luckier/Happier” 
 Posted on July 4, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

Salutations!

When we last met for our rendezvous of the literary persuasion, I had just secured an internship at Suite #201 and overall was beginning to feel like my old self again.  I have since marked my first month in Hollywood and am overjoyed with all of the wonderful things that have come my way.

This past weekend, I celebrated my 22nd birthday! It was quite the thought to realize that I was back in Los Angeles a year later after turning 21 here last summer.  Then, Hollywood seemed so scary, my dreams so far away and I began the week feeling like not much had changed.  Why celebrate turning a year older when I was no closer to taking over the world?

 

Reluctantly I acquiessed to Dolán’s demands to take me out for my birthday.  We drove on a Saturday morning down the 405 to The Getty , a land of wonder and art fixed a top one of California’s hills.  We spent the day discussing art, of course, but also our passions, our desires to create art of our own and finished a lovely day of sun-drinking by having our breath stolen by the view from our white-clothed table as we ate food as beautiful as the framed pieces on the walls.  The following morning my aunt and I caught a movie, shopped for unassembled goods at IKEA in Burbank and grabbed lunch at the garden of olives.  Later that evening, she and I took a walk through the beautiful streets of Sherman Oaks and I could feel the beginnings of a shift within my soul, but I couldn’t specifically put into words what was happening.

Monday was my actual birthday and as my phone exploded with birthday wishes from friends and family afar, my heart swelled with gratitude for having them in my life at all.  Sometimes it isn’t about taking over the world.  Sometimes it’s about loving those that make the world worth wanting.

 I arrived home early that day from Suite #201 to the gift that Dolán had left me to unwrap, as well as a package in the mail from my much missed friend, Jayce.  The two must know me well as they both gifted me words (in book form): If You Have To Cry Go Outside by Kelly Cutrone from Dolán and On Beauty by Zadie Smith from Jayce.

 T ip #33: Read. 

I cannot stress enough how important it is to read in Hollywood.  While I am not saying to cut your guilty pleasure readings from your literary routine (as this blog might be one of them), but make time to read texts you wouldn’t do so under normal circumstance.  Not only will you pry open the brim of your mind, but also fill it with words, stories, questions and knowledge whose possession is crucial in an industry where sometimes it *is* what you know.

Later that evening I drove the lengthy four minutes to see Ace.

Halfway through my adventure here in Hollywood, in a bookstore on Ventura, I met Ace.  Tall, handsome and better yet, intelligent, Ace and I have been spending time getting to know one another and I was very excited to spend my birthday with him.  He drove us to a restaurant in Burbank and then back to his place.”Do you want to watch a movie? A show? What do you want to do?”he asked and I instantly felt bad as I had to explain that Suite #201 had given me a stack of scripts to read before Wednesday and to my relief he couldn’t have been more supportive.  So there I was, script in lap, my fingers intwined with his and I wondered if I could get any luckier/happier.

Work finished, I slipped away to the restroom and when I came out all of the lights were turned off.

Confused, I walked trepidatiously down the hallway to the living room from where emanated a faint glow and sharply inhaled as there, on his coffee table, sat a homemade birthday cake.”Happy birthday,”said Ace.  I had no words.  No man had ever baked for me (and Ace is not the baking type).  I kissed him and leaned over the cake, atop which was hand-piped in blue icing the message“Happy B-day Estevan.””I ran out of icing,”Ace said, his face adorably begging for forgiveness as if I could have asked for anything more.  The subtle warmth of the candles drew my gaze and I let from my lips fall a wish that extinguished their flames.  We ate straight from the dish.

 Later Ace and I laid, legs twisted together and his face lit from the moon’s light that snuck between his bedroom blinds and to my heart’s joy/fear we agreed that he would be my boyfriend and I would be his.  My eyes drifted to sleep and I wondered what I had done to deserve such an amazing birthday weekend.

The cool fabric of his sheets resting against my skin, I awoke searching for Ace in the the spaces next to me, only to open my eyes and find him standing at the foot of his bed.  Gift in hand, he extended the wrapped parcel and said,“Happy Birthday.”I felt like I was in a scene from a movie.

Inside was a bracelet.  He owns the same one.”I figured you could think of me every time you wear it,”he said.  I am so used to being the guy who goes out of his way to be thoughtful and romantic that I didn’t know how amazing it could feel to have someone go so far to make me happy.  I’m wearing as I write these words.

I returned to Suite #201 on Friday with a very pressing question to answer: What should I do?  I have received, from numerous acquaintances and mentors, the following advice: You need to get at least a year’s experience at a major agency.  A major agency would be CAA, ICM, WME, APA.  Those horrid kind of places where bosses throw scripts at interns whose names they shan’t be bothered to learn as the intern will either quit or be fired before the days mail has been delivered.  Think Entourage (2004).

But while Suite #201 may not be paying me monetarily and while I know I could survive the wrath of an FML agency, I couldn’t help but hear the words of Kelly Cutrone in my head:

 “If this book inspires you to do one thing, I hope it’s to take the years when you’re young -say, between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five, before you have a mortgage or kids or anything else that needs to be fed- and go balls out on intuition and follow your dreams.  Dreams won’t always take you on a straight path to destiny, but they’re usually related to what your soul wants for you.  They’ll force you to ask yourself the hard questions, they’ll kick your ass, and most importantly, they’ll turn you on…I hope you too will choose to have a journey instead of just a life.  Actually, I hope it’s a full on expedition.” 

I can only hope my blog will do the same for you that her book has begun to do for me.

So I quieted my mind and listened to my soul…*beat*…I flicked open my eyes, knowing that I am where I am meant to be.  I spent Friday putting 100% into my job at Suite #201: remembering client names, numbers, reading scripts at lighting speed, cleaning a break room that was in desperate need of a facelift, etc.  And it must have paid off because all day long Matt, Jack and Ari offered overwhelmingly positive feedback, so much so that they asked me to sit in on a notes meeting for a feature script.  Friday came to a close and we packed our belongings, ready for the holiday weekend.  Stepping out onto the streets of Beverly Hills, we turned to head for our perspective cars when from behind Ari shouted,“Hey Estevan!”I turned to face him;“You kicked ass this week.”I couldn’t help but grin from ear to ear.

If I can’t walk my way onto a job, well hey, I’ll just create my own.  After all, doesn’t that make for a much better story?

 “A Change Has Come Along” 
 Posted on June 22, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

Hello!!!

First of all, I would like to say thank you.  Whether you are a first time reader or have been following along from the start, it truly does mean more than words can say to have you traveling alongside me as I chase my dreams.  I’ve been living here in Los Angeles for a total of twenty-one days (a lifetime, I know) and I’m happy to say a change has come along.

I believe that I moved to Hollywood with a skewed perspective.  With the prospect of joining one of television’s most successful writer’s newest shows, I traversed through the scorching Arizonan desert and over the rolling Californian hills with the idea that I’d slam my car in park at the intersection of Sunset and Highland, jump out, shout“Hello Hollywood!”and the heavens would open up to let fall the keys to the City of Angeles.

When that fell apart, so did I.

I see now that the race up toward Hollywood’s brightest star is not a sprint, not even a marathon, but an odyssey.

 

As the clouds in my mind began to clear, the spaces on my iCal began to fill up.

On Sunday, Dolán being the superstar that is he is invited me to a screening of Paramount Pictures’ Super 8 (2011) on the actual Paramount lot.  The film could not have come at a more perfect time.  Here was this action- and lens flare- packed film that at it’s core was about a group of kids fighting out of pure passion to finish their movie.  It reminded me of the days when I was a boy growing up in South-Central Phoenix.  After school I’d climb to the top of a giant fig tree in my backyard, peer out from betwixt giant leaves as the sky burned crimson with the setting sun and daydreamed of a giant crane capturing the final moments of a movie story playing on the screen in my mind.

 

My eyes squinted to adjust to the bright sun as I emerged from the theatre and ran into one of Super 8 ‘s biggest stars: the 1967 Buick Skylark.  I snapped a quick photo alongside the car and returned home to continue inundating the inboxes of potential employers using websites like EntertainmentCareers.net and now, thanks to Dolán, the United Talent Agency Job list (a semi-elusive compilation of job postings).

 Tip #30: Spread it wide. 

In this economy, snagging a job is like winning the lottery.  The best way to win any lottery is to buy as many tickets as possible, so extend your name in as many ways to as many places.  Which, after 16 days in Hollywood, finally proved successful for me.

On Wednesday, I awoke to an e-mail asking if I could make it to Beverly Hills by 5 o’clock for an interview.  I slipped on some black skinny jeans with a side zipper detail, a patterned blue dress shirt, a checkered tie and was out the door.  Zooming off the 405 and onto Santa Monica Boulevard, I made my way to Beverly Hills.

Not wanting to be late, I arrived an excessive one hour early so I took a stroll to the nearest Starbucks.  Luxury cars zoomed hurriedly alongside a concrete sidewalk upon which women with waists no bigger than their wrists sauntered in their Chanel shoes whilst shopping bags from Balenciaga and Dior hung obnoxiously from their arms.  I despised them. I envied them.

In Los Angeles, it’s hard not to walk down city streets littered with beautiful people and wonder about their beautiful lives.  In Los Angeles, it’s easy to let the lusty glow of lights, the seductive glitter of glamour make you feel like less than.

 Tip #31: Decide why you are out here.  Remind yourself hourly. 

The mission of this literary adventure is to document my journey to the top, true, however my purpose in fighting to the top is simple: My family gave me everything I’ve ever needed and as a 21 year-old man I want to be able to give them the same in return.

 I lifted my head, sipped my (free) ice water and walked down the lilac-flowered street to my interview.

From the moment I stepped foot onto the lavish carpet of Suite 201, I felt right at home.  Mike, a 30-something year-old blonde welcomed me and led me to the office in which my interview was to take place.  Leaving me seated on a chic black-leather sofa, Mike left to grab the CEO’s son, Jack.

Vaguely-reminiscent of Ryan Gosling in a Jake Gyllenhaal  sort of way, Jack spoke his questions softly and the interview as a whole felt more like a“let’s get to know one another”conversation rather than a“prove to me why you deserve this”interrogation.

Near the end of my interview, Ari, a sharp-tongued guy with dark hair came to meet“the guy with the great cover letter.”

 TIP #32: If you don’t love yourself, how can anyone else? 

I began my cover letter stating simply, honestly and without conceit that I was the best applicant they would receive and would greatly appreciate an interview to prove it.  The same thing that attracted the men of Suite 201 could have disinterested other companies, true, but if I don’t believe I’m great how can I ask complete strangers to?

And it must have worked because yesterday was my first day!

While this position is an unpaid internship, I welcome the opportunity to learn and network, understanding that money would be nice slash much needed, but knowledge is power and experience is priceless.  My first day at Suite 201, a Talent Management Company founded by a former major agency president, was hectic.  Thrown onto the front desk, I settled in to answering phone, keeping a call sheet, reading scripts to client projects, jogging to Starbucks for coffee requested at specific temperatures and just plain simply trying to keep from falling on my ass.

Working for a small company will allow me to see the inner workings of an industry that I’d be shielded from at a larger agency.  My search continues for a paying job, but until the stars align I take comfort in knowing that I never gave up and more importantly that I never will.

I return to Suite 201 tomorrow with the image of my younger self in mind.  I can see my small hands gripped tightly around the knotted branches of that fig tree and I look back…with pride.

Even as I write these words I can feel the tingle of hope burst across my skin and my heart can almost hear my younger self saying“You really did it.”I’m actually living in the city I daily dreamt of as a kid.

Tomorrow I’m ready to face the world, I mean, after all, this is only the beginning!

 “Paramount Pictures Welcomes Estevan Quintero” 
 Posted on June 12, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

As Day 11 comes to a close here in Hollywood, I look back on what has been less than two weeks and feel as though a lifetime has elapsed.  I know it has been a while since my last post , but figured your time was better spent reading posts when events solicited them.

On Monday, as I was still unemployed, I made plans to join my aunt/roommate for lunch in Downtown Los Angeles.  With gas prices at a wallet-breaking high in conjunction with the ever-preset sea of traffic, I planned to take the subway into the city.

 

 Tip #26: Yes, Los Angeles has a subway.  Take it. 

I purchased my ticket for the RED LINE and at only $1.50 per ride, it simply can’t be beat when your employment status requires you to live a life less lavish than those of Hollywood stars and starlets.  Already running late for lunch and ticket in hand, I dash between the subway doors just moments before they smashed closed behind me.  With a sigh of relief, I glanced around the packed subway car and noticed elderly women fighting not to notice me as they hugged their lapped purses tightly toward them.  I slid into an empty seat and wondered if those around me could tell I was from out of town, then again, everyone in Hollywood is from some place else.

I’m not sure what it is about me, but I seem to give off an inviting vibe to strangers; perhaps it’s that I have not lived in Los Angeles long enough to acquire that facial expression that reads as“I’m better than you. Obviously.”Regardless, it would be my luck that a homeless man by the name of Greg and lost in the pleasures of cocaine or meth approached me and for the duration of my ride repeatedly offered me a“grape Jolly Rancher because they taste like purple.”

 Tip #27: Don’t take candy from a stranger. 

The thu-thunk of the silver snake stopped at Pershing Square and I emerged from underground into a chaotic city at work.  I was lost.  Standing still, I traced my eyes up the towering glass-coated and concrete edifices without the slightest clue as to where I was and, more unfortunately, where I was going.

 LESSON LEARNED: You can’t get found if you don’t get lost. 

 In L.A. and in life, it’s easy to traverse the safes routes, sticking to familiar sidewalks but big dreams always await at the ends of roads less travelled.  So I asked a passerby for directions and was enjoying a deliciously free lunch not long after.

On Wednesday, I was was invited by my fashionable friend Robinson to join him and his friend for happy hour at the famous French bistro Figaro . I wasn’t sure if I should accept his invitation, not because I wasn’t dying to hear about his fabulous retail internship, but happy hour didn’t seem quite deserved as I was still unemployed.  After all, shouldn’t I continue to keep myself locked away until out of pure frustration I’d managed to conjure up a job?

 Tip #28: Don’t punish yourself. 

 If you’re having a slow week in getting where you want to be, say yes to getting out into the world because an hour of happy is better than a day of dejection.  That is not an invitation to splurge your savings on slipperily expensive nights of drinking, however.  As the sun set, we sat at a tiny round blue table and talked of ambitions and life and how to marry the two.  I left 1 diet coke and 3 mini crab cakes later feeling uplifted and with my wallet only $9 lighter, I’d say it was well worth it.

And finally yesterday was the apex of an unexpected week.  I received about 3 months ago a friend request from someone I did not know.  I’m sure this has happened to you.

 Tip #29: Accept friend request. 

 Unless they are clearly a Facebook bot or worse, an ex-fling, go ahead and accept.  It takes two point five seconds to unfriend someone.  His name (for the purpose of this blog at least) is Dolán.  During these past 3 months we began to chat and as an aspiring writer/director himself, we had much to discuss.  I gave him a ring when I acclimated myself in Los Angeles and he invited me to grab a cup of coffee at his work: Paramount Pictures.

I drove along Melrose Avenue and pulled onto the breathtakingly beautiful lot.  The guard asked for my name, triple-checked“the list”and handed me a pass which read“Paramount Pictures Welcomes Estevan Quintero.”You’re damn right you do.  Dolán gave me a private tour of the massive expansive of land, upon which sat numerous sound stages.  He pointed to buildings and said things like“and that’s where Orson Welles shot Citizen Kane.”It felt like the spirits of film geniuses past were lifting my soul up to the heavens.  And then we grabbed coffee.

Opening the coffee shop doors, we walked into an aroma cloud of the espresso persuasion and Dolán asked me,“Does this look familiar?”And it did, not because it was a Starbucks, but I couldn’t place my mind’s finger as to why.”This,”Dolán said,“is The Lima Bean or at least that’s what it’s call when they’re shooting Glee scenes in here.”I couldn’t believe I where I was standing.

We sipped our drinks under the shade of trees as that California sunshine kissed the flowing Hollywood breeze and we told one another our stories.  Dolán is that lucky kind of friend that you don’t find, but finds you.  He was so eager to share the lessons he’s learned and the tips he’s worked to acquire.  While you can’t go around trusting the words of everyone, it would be foolish not to at least listen.  When you only get one life to live, why not learn from the lives of others?

The truth remains that I have $13 left to my name and not a single call has come back from the near 200 resumes I’ve submitted.  Quite frankly, I’m scared.  I look back on my previous post and my past perspective almost embarrassed that I had the nerve to whine over my lack of employment after only four days.  People spend lifetimes chasing their dreams.  As scared as I am, I know that courage is not the absence of fear, but rather fear carried through that which scares us most in life.  And for me that’s failure.  I would liked to have ended this post with the announcement of a job, but I’ve been given one better: hope.

 LESSON LEARNED: In order to survive, you need to do three things 1) Believe you are good enough. No else will do it for you; 2) Believe that your dreams will come true; 3) Have a cool aunt that lets you eat her food for free.

 “Estimated Time of Arrival” 
 Posted on June 2, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

So tomorrow marks the end of my first official week here in Hollywood and the current state of progress is, well, a mess.

Before moving out to Los Angeles, I teeter-tottered betwixt two paths. I could stay in Arizona working a“normal”job whilst saving money and making the trek out here only after I had secured a job or I could toss my cap and gown straight from graduation into a box and move to Hollywood with faith in my talents and persistence on my mind.  I chose the latter.

Not only does tomorrow signify the end of a week, but the closing of a door.  My only prospect moving out to Hollywood was as a writer’s P.A. on a new show for a major network.  After initial contact from the network, voicemails have been left and thank you cards have been sent, but I have not, however, been offered an interview.  Recalling my experience last summer (see Tip #5 from post entitled “Thou Shall Not Leave The House Looking Crazy” ), I awoke today with my head up and drove to a near by shopping mall.

 Tip #25: Create your own office. 

I know myself.  I know that if I stay in my apartment I will undoubtedly wind up spending the day stuff my face with rice cakes while tapping the refresh button on Facebook, knowing good and well not a single thing has changed.  Needing to stop by the Apple Store regardless, I went instead four hours early to continue sending out my resume.  Surrounded by screaming children, soccer moms and dads and with the peculiar mixed aroma of Panda Express and Burger King, I made the food court my new office.  After three hours of *non-stop* job hunting, I’d probably sent out well over 75 e-mails with my resume.  My eyes squinty from such strain, I left feeling frustrated.

 

On my way to the Apple Store I rounded the corner and there she stood. Is that her?….Omg, that is her….No, it can’t be…Go say hi! With my head leaning over my torso, not wanting to invade too much of her space,“Excuse me, Hi, are you by chance Kara from If I Can Dream ?”“Yes, I am, hi,”she said, her long blonde curls flanking a star smile.  I couldn’t believe that Kara Killmer was standing in front of me.  It felt like just a day ago I had been watching her, an aspiring actress and singer, attempt to make her dreams come true on television.  We chatted briefly about my recent move to Los Angeles, the cancelation of her television show and her new job…at a mall boutique.  If she’s not giving up, how could I?

 

Shortly after I sat motionless in my tiny white Elantra, stuck in L.A. traffic.  Peeking over the hoods of cars, I could  see my apartment complex in the distance, but with countless curved highway ramps cluttered with California-licensed cars attempting to merge together it came to me then:

 LESSON LEARNED: You can only move as fast as Fate will allow. 

The simple fact is this: There are a lot of people trying to get to the same place.  I couldn’t very well bulldoze the  cars in front of me (or, like a lucky few motorcycle drivers, zoom by on the fast lane).  I don’t family or friend’s in  the industry to help me so I’m going to have to do it on my own.  I had left my“corner office”feeling frustrated by  my lack of progress, but I had failed to understand and moreover, failed to appreciate that I have only been here for 6 days and  three of which were the weekend.  Taking over the world will at least require a full week.  So long as I can see  where I am going, possess the patience to play the waiting game and practice the passion that lead me out here in  the first place, well, then I’m sure to reach my destination.

 “Take Over The World!” 
 Posted on May 31, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

Hello!

First of all, thank you for taking the time to follow along what is sure to be an unforgettable ride!  This is the site (and first post) of my new blog Take Over The World! 

Exactly 365 days ago, I published the first words of my previous blog The Stev Project which detailed the hard-earned Tips &amp; Lessons Learned as I ventured away from the comforts of home and into the crazy world of Hollywood.  Every year hundreds of thousands make the journey out to the City of Angels with the hopes that their talents and tenacity will propel them up above the rest and into stardom.  So a year ago I figured I’d document my summer voyage, if, for no other reason than to have something upon which to look back and recall what I had learned in my short time out here, but with the larger hope of inspiring my readers to follow their *biggest* dreams.

I can hardly believe a year has passed.  I have since finished my most recent film PERCHANCE , graduated from The University of Arizona and settled into my… humble apartment in Los Angeles!  This time, however, this isn’t a summer’s adventure.  This time it’s for real.

No longer do I have the safety net of school resting comfortingly below me as I walk across this tight rope between today and my destiny.

I’ve have been saying for the past 18 years that I’m going to make it…that I’m going to move to Hollywood and make my dreams come true.  For the past 18 years I’ve been saying that I’m going to take over the world and while my 3 year-old self couldn’t seem to grow up fast enough, I look out from 21 years of age with rent, bills and failure looming.  I couldn’t help but wonder if I was just plain delusional.

Overwhelmed with thought, I did what has come to be my most mind-clearing activity; I ran.  The swoosh and tug of my laces echoed in the cool Californian air as I clicked in my headphones and began to jog.  With the maze-colored sun setting behind me, I felt that familiar burn in my lungs.  I did what I’ve learned to do: push passed it.  Soon the blazing inferno at the back of my throat cleared and shadows sprawled across the sidewalk snagged my attention.  I found myself fighting to look up, but afraid to fall down.

 Tip #24: Chin up. 

The road to my biggest dreams will be anything but smooth.  I will fall and hard.  My body, my soul, however, will rip and grow stronger as I pull myself up, affix my eyes on my destiny and run with faith beneath my feet.

So come along with me as I attempt to reach the brightest star in the Hollywood sky.  There will be what every great story has: heart-breaking defeats, up-lifting victories, love (hopefully) and, in the end, what I pray will be a happy ending!

I’ve published the posts from The Stev Project so feel free to peruse the first 23 Tips from last summer beginning with the post entitled “T-Minus 24 Hours” or to jump right in with me today!

 “18 oz. Of Tip It!” 
 Posted on May 31, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

My last post detailed the craziness that was my first day on Sunset and since then I have survived five additional/equally crazy days.  I am almost positive I *really* am living the real life version of The Devil Wears Prada (2006).

Do you recall in the movie how Anne Hathaway is asked to deliver“The Book”to Miranda? Well, on my third day I was asked to deliver“The Box”to CC!

See, every Friday“The Weekend List”is complied and attached to“The Box.”It is delivered to CC just before every weekend.  Inside are all of the scripts, files, e-mails, notes, etc. that she needs for the weekend and must be assembled *EXACTLY* how she likes it to be done (alpha order, specific sized folders, labels, fonts, etc).

It is absolutely crucial that CC receive“The Box”on time and correctly assembled because often times she flies out of state for the weekend and must have with her anything and everything she might need to conduct business while away.

Luckily I had my fellow intern Ning, whose friendly eyes peek out from behind nose-length bangs, to walk me through the production of“The Box.”After double…triple…quadruple checking to make sure everything on“The Weekend List”was perfectly put together in“The Box,”I was told by M that CC“has a 5.30 at W.M.E with Andrew, should be out by 6.30 and is flying to Chicago at 7.  It’s 5 o’clock now, don’t be late.”

I held my smile long enough for M to return to her office and then grabbed both“The Box”and my trusty notebook, while rushing to the elevator I scribbled everything M had said onto a post-it just in case, used my iPhone to google W.M.E. (William Morris Endeavors) in the parking garage and was on the road in less than 3.5 minutes.

Weaving in-n-out of traffic, pushing to make lights and riding the speed limit I made my way from Sunset to Beverly Hills, shoved my car between rows of luxury cars and was greeted my Monica, the receptionist at W.M.E. who insisted I take“The Box”down to the mailroom.  After my unyielding persistence, she used her high-tech ear piece to call over Andrew’s assistant, Brian, who swore to pass it to CC the moment she stepped out of his office.  I said,“Look Brian, this is‘The Box’and CC is flying to Chicago tonight.  She had better have it when she gets on that plane or it’s your ass…*looks back-n-forth from Monica to Brian* Thanks so much for your guys’help!*smile*”

 TIP #22: Your are *not* the one. 

It might seem harsh/rude but I had to ensure that Brian understood the importance of“The Box,”but more importantly the fact that I am not the one to be effed with.  It was, after all, *my* ass on the line if CC didn’t get“The Box.”Just remember to smile and be gracious in the very end.

I spent the weekend recovering from my first week on Sunset (relieved that CC had in fact received“The Box”) and arrived on Tuesday ready to work! I said hello to Joey, the cute receptionist on my way in and greeted M with a“Good morning!”to which she replied,“Morning. So look, you’re gonna be the only intern today. You can handle that, right?”“Uh…no, yeah, totally…I got this…*awkward smile*”

Picture this: I’m at my desk. Down the hall copy machine is spitting out print jobs. Phone is ringing. I’m binding scripts. Compiling packages for industry peoples. Duplicating DVDs. Grabbing coffee. Researching possible outfits for CC’s upcoming events. Logging phone calls. For 8 hours straight.

You might be asking,“When did he have time to pee?”

 TIP #23: Learn to hold your pee. 

In The Devil Wears Prada (2006) when Anne Hathaway arrives late and Emily Blunt says,“Finally! I can pee!”“You haven’t peed?!”“Well, someone had to man the desk.”comes straight from real life.  The longer you can hold your pee the more successful you’ll be.

It was 6 o’clock, I was tired, grumpy and ready to go home when Kyle, a Converse-wearing writer turned CC’s right hand man, came to my desk, handed me a menu and said“we’re ordering dinner.  Get whatever you want and then call it in.”

It was then that I knew I wasn’t leaving anytime soon.  I continued to perform like some artist out of Cirque de Soleil, balancing more tasks than I have fingers while standing on a ball, careful not to falter even the slightest bit at risk of falling back, tossing the tasks in the air and watching from below as they rain down on me like some sad shower of subsidence.  After 10 hours, my screen sounded with a *POP*

 M: Hey, Kyle and I are gonna be here a while. Go ahead and go. 

 Stev: Are you sure you don’t need me? 

 M: No, thank you. 

 Stev: Okay. 

 M: I’m impressed, btw. Didn’t mess it up once. 

 Stev: Thank you! 

 M: Now get outta here. 

I hopped in my car and while traveling under the HOLLYWOOD stars back to my apartment it occurred to me that I only have 18DAYS left of this HOLLYWOOD adventure and as you and I both know, it has been quite a crazy affair.  Back at the office, I shouldn’t have let the fact that I spent 10 hours busting my ass bother me! In fact, I should crave the late nights and endless workloads! If I think of my remaining time here as a giant 18oz. wine glass, then I’m shouting“TIP IT!”to the HOLLYWOOD gods! Fill my glass with to the brim with any, every and all experiences!

 “Gird Your Loins!” 
 Posted on May 31, 2011 by estevan.quintero 

This post officially marks the 1/2 way point along this HOLLYWOOD adventure and I would like to say thank you, my literary lover, for spending the late nights/early mornings/afternoon siestas with me.  This journey would have been near impossible without your support.

It is only fitting, I suppose, that this journey’s half way point and the turning point should be one in the same because what began as a painful story of naive hope just might end as a HOLLYWOOD fairy tale.

On Friday, I arrived to my interview nearly an hour early and decided to spend my time at a chic coffee shop across the street from my interview site.

 TIP #17: Breathe. Stretch. Let It Go . 

Sitting there allowed me to cool down, review my resume and channel those nerves into charm.  It was as if I had managed to toss a sheer sheet over those fluttering butterflies in my stomach, grabbed hold and used them to float away to a lofty state of poise.  At 17 minutes’til, I sauntered along Sunset Boulevard and into the ultra modern building.

I shared my elevator ride to the 8th floor with a man who sprinted in at the last moment, his dress shirt spotted with sweat in the most unflattering of places.  He made me grateful that I had taken a moment to collect myself because first impressions are critical and you want to promenade into that office with every hair effortlessly in place.

Having given my name to Joey, the super sexy secretary, I took my seat on the oddly comfortable chocolate suede couches.

 TIP #18: Give your thumbs a break. 

While waiting for your interview to start (and they will always make you wait) put your phone away and read a magazine from the office or tuck one of your own in your small tote because when they step out to greet you it sends a better message if you’re reading rather than tweeting.

After about 15 minutes of reading last month’s GQ, she finally came around the corner and walked me back to her office.”M”as we will call her was beyond adorable! Asian with killer hair, M and I sat in her office running down my resume and during it all I couldn’t help but notice that we had drifted from rigid interrogatory dialogue into conversational chat usually reserved for girlfriends.

 TIP #19: Dance, betch. 

Interviews are like dancing with a partner.  If you are stumbling, nervous or cold  your interviewer will only be put off.  So keep it suave and lead them gracefully into feeling like they can 1) like you; and 2) trust you.  I left feeling as though I had nailed it, but wouldn’t know for sure until after the weekend.

Over this past weekend, BTW, I celebrated my 21st birthday! I had the absolute *BEST* time.  I went with my close friend Jaycie and saw In The Heights at the Pantages Theatre in HOLLYWOOD and like Cinderella’s drunk stepsister, once the clock struck 12 I went over to AKBAR and drank the night away with friends and a crowd of exceptionally attractive hipster gays (that means there was a lot of plaid).

This past Monday morning, N.W.E. asked me to come in and sign paperwork so that I can start work…eventually (I signed it all, but as it is already Thursday I have this theory that my first day will likely be the day before I leave).

When I arrived home from repeatedly practicing my autograph on N.W.E.’s contracts, waivers, and release forms, I received an email from M officially offering me the position on Sunset!  Normally, I’d wrap this post up with some ornately detailed anecdote, but too much has happened to stop now.

Yesterday was my first day on Sunset and let me tell you now…I am living the real-life version of The Devil Wears Prada (2006).

So I arrived at 10a.m. wearing a short sleeve patterned shirt and black tie paired with jeans and sneakers ready for my first day in an actual office.  The day began rather expectedly: I was given a tour of the office, met the other interns and was put to work reading an introductory packet.  Suddenly, a series of *POPS* sounded as everyone’s computer’s received instant messages saying:“She’s down stairs!”

The office exploded into the most frantic of frenzies, post-its were ripped from walls, food was tossed away, appearances were primped and I was beyond confused.

One of the interns, Mia, grabbed me by the arm saying,“C’mon, we have to go get her.”Seeing my bemused expression, she added,“You know, CC, the lady who’s name is on the side of the building.”

“If her name is on the side of the building, doesn’t she know where her office is?”I asked.

“Of course she does, but we go down and get her,”she stated with a finite tone.  I didn’t push it any further.

Down in the parking structure, Mia leaned over and said,“I have to move her car, but grab anything she hands to you.”I nodded and we stepped alongside a poorly parked car in which sat CC herself.  Brief introductions were made betwixt she and I whilst she talked loudly into a phone.  Handing me her purse, she took a break long enough to spout off colors of bags I was to bring up from her trunk, but just as she finished saying“and the baby blue one too,”her phone began to ring again. I loaded myself with bag after bag trying to remember which colors were coming and which were staying like some game of SIMON.

Weighed down to the max with bags and a box, Mia’s last words to me were,“Oh and get all the doors and elevators for her.  She doesn’t do doors.””Got it,”I exhaled.  I followed CC as she continued her cellular business, making sure to use any remaining limbs to prop open doors.  I deposited all of her bags in her office and scurried out, leaving CC to her affairs.

 TIP #20: Carry a pad and pen. 

You know how in the movie, Anne Hathaway carries a notebook and pen each time she stepped into Miranda’s office? That’s because both of our bosses spouted names, dates and tasks too numerous to remember and too quickly to question.  I found a pad and pen in the supply room, but bring one with you just in case you aren’t so lucky.

I fumbled through the day, doing my best to keep up with what felt like living in an entirely new world.  As sundown came on Sunset, the office began to empty out.  M came over and asked me if I was able to be stay until the end of the day.  I looked over to the clock which read“7:00 pm”and thought to myself,“I don’t think there is anymore day to stay for.”

 TIP #21: You can *always* stay. 

I smiled and simply said,“Absolutely.”I continued working, familiarizing myself with the office and listening in on conversations in M’s office for avenues of gaining a deeper sense of CC’s business affairs.  If I want to impress M and CC, then I’ve got to know what they have on their plates.

Finally around 8.30p.m., after almost an 11 hour day M hit the switch in her office and said,“Hey, I’m headed home for the day.  Go ahead and pack up.  I’ll see you tomorrow.”She smiled, pivoted on her heel and flipped that killer hair.  Just as she was about to reach the end of the hallway, she turned, added“Great job today, by the way”and walked away.

Thoroughly exhausted, I stuffed my charcoal gray tote with my personal belongings and walked to the end of the office, where, for the first time all day I realized that I can clearly see the HOLLYWOOD sign outside my window.  The city’s auburn lights and the silhouettes of buildings made it a sight fit for a postcard.  Taking in that picturesque view, I couldn’t help but feel like my dreams are beginning to come true.  Sure, it’s just an office with a view and it very well may be the craziest office just short of something out of a movie, but staring at those giant white block letters I know, someday, I’m gonna own this town!

*LIGHTS OUT*
