 (HFS2) University Residences 

 A bit confusing, didn&apos;t know at the time to fill out the part about the roommate survey. better instructions A bit stressful of a process. a little confusing Actually, I think it is hard to get the first choice. As a freshman, it was semi straightforward from what I can remember. As far as room mate assignment, I feel like it wouldn&apos;t be too hard for Purdue to match students up on increased levels of compatability. Having a good roommate is pivotal to enjoying the semester and so Purdue to strive to match students up who will get a long and have minimum conflict. Bad roommate, mid level assignment But it was difficult. My first year as a freshman, I think things could have been smoother. It seemed like hundereds of packets and pamphlets and brochures were being sent my way, it should be simpler and less paper clutter. But need a lot of time to read the cotract. I dont like that but what about those of us who want to move back to the dorms? To this date I have not found anything online. Changing room assignments without warning was horribly unprofessional and resulted in medical conflicts and breech of several contracts. Purdue Village Undergraduate has a terrible reputation in my mind. clear and concise language would be awesome clearly defines what you need to do to complete the registration process Could be a little more organized but it is still clear and easy to use. Could send out an email. Definitely need a new way to match roommates though. Didn&apos;t get single Didnt get my first,second, third or even fourth choice as a freshman didnt receive email of acceptance, no package was sent out, that would be nice During my first semester, the assignment was not ready on time. I didn&apos;t know my hall assignment until long after all others. The office staff was rude and did not help the situation when we inquired as to the problem. Easy Easy to apply Easy to apply Easy to use, good First year i was put in harrison which was my 3rd pick which was great but i had requested a roommate and she requested me but she turned her application in much later and we weren&apos;t placed together. Food in dining court is great. If it can be more fruit there, that will be better. For the Fall 2009 - Spring 2010 year I was never informed of who my roommate was going to be until I sent an email to Shreve Hall to find out. For the last two years I have been asked to leave my assigned room because either it was being reassigned to freshman or becoming a male occupied room. I do not believe this is a good policy. I understand why room changes might be needed. But moving the same person two years in a row? Freshmen should not have been allowed to live in Hillenbrand. Many sophomores were looking forward to living there and for freshmen to get priority over sophomores was unfair. Friendly staff. Grad houses had no vacancies by the time I applied. That is one thing to mention since I got an admit only in April 09, it was too late for Housing applications. Either the admission process should be faster ( which may be unreasonable on my part to say that ) or the grad houses should also have a few vacancies for new admits. hard to understand&amp;navigate Hawkins graduate residence didn&apos;t have space left when I got admitted into Purude. I pretty much had to find an apartment or house. Hilltop needs to change their form so it does not allow a freshman to apply to their &apos;upper class wing&apos;. I requested to live with my friend there for next year who will be an incoming freshman. I unknowingly got into an upperclassman wing where he could not live. There must be a system put in place to avoid this confusion in the future. Hilltop wasn&apos;t even a choice when I registered for Purdue, yet I got placed there. Not complaining, I like it there, but I would&apos;ve liked all the options to be visible However, sometimes I recieved several emails and didn&apos;t know which one was most current. I am an adult non-traditional student that is a single parent. I am an RA so I didn&apos;t have to go through the application process for housing. I am bad with computers and still figured it out. I am not satisfied with how the University Residences communicate with me about new roommates. I got a new roommate for second semester this year, and they never bothered to tell me who it would be. I&apos;d like to be able to communicate with that person to discuss what to bring to the room. I am unaware of the process in place today, but when I applied in 2005, everything worked smoothly. I applied and the people there lost my application. Then I got an email saying that I was scheduled for an interview at a certain date and time. I went there and I was told by the interviewer that I was not on his schedule. It was quite awkward getting all dressed uponly to find that very unprofessional people are running the show at the housing places. Then when I inquired, I was told that my application was lost and the time frame for which I had applied was already gone. So I missed a very good chance to get a tuition waiver just because of some people who dont know what they are doing and have gotten good paying salaries just because its a state run university. If I were running this show, I know of a lot of people who would be on the street. I applied as an athlete, so I was not under the same circumstances at the general population. I applied for hilltop for a summer in 2007, and the application was satisfactory. I applied Freshman year and there was plenty of handouts that described the application process in clear steps. I did not get a response right away. I did not receive information about when you could apply. I didn&apos;t hear about my assignment until the week before I was to move in. I didn&apos;t realize that in order to get the room I wanted, I would have to get up at 6 am and sign up. I do not like the random placing for freshman. I submitted my housing application as soon as I was able to. I got my email telling me where I was living, and I ended up getting my seventh choice. I do not think that this is good for students that apply as soon as possible. I do not understand this question. Do you mean how important the communication process is for me or how important the application itself? I do not understand what you are asking I don&apos;t know where this question is going.... I don&apos;t like the fact that when looking for a room in Hawkin&apos;s Hall (during the contract signing process), you can&apos;t see the description of the room you are signing up for until you have signed a contract. You can only see prices and a code (which isn&apos;t explained). I feel like a lot more can be done to assign students to a room so that they are living with a roommate that they get along with. I chose my roommate freshman year, but there were at least 3-4 rooms on my floor that had girls that wanted desperately to switch roommates. I feel that new residents who aren&apos;t incoming freshman should get priority for choosing rooms instead of being thrown into the same random assignment that incoming freshman have. I felt that the application process was very quick and easy and the assignment was accurate to what I had requested. I got a notice months after signing a contract staying where I currently reside isn&apos;t available for the next year. I got my fifth choice for housing, not satisfied. I got my first choice and was told before I even graduated high school where I would be living. I got my first choice of residents halls. I got the dorm I wanted. I had a hard time signing up for the second semester of the year, when I was on co-op for the first half. I didn&apos;t know how to do that, and it still isn&apos;t clear to me. I had a horrible roommate experience. I had a lot of trouble working my way through the application and when I reapplied for my sophomore year, I had trouble with all the windows. i have applied for PV housing and the whole process is awesome the staff there are just incredible. their service is great I havent lived or applied for university residences in over 6 yrs and do not remember the process. I knot that the process is different now then when I used it. I last applied 11 years ago. I liked they way housing assignments used to be, on a first come-first serce basis. I dislike the new system of a lottery, It doesn&apos;t motivate people to accept the admittance offer. i live at harrison hall I roomed with someone i knew I still don&apos;t know what I&apos;m supposed to do if I&apos;m going to study abroad. I think it&apos;s stupid that when you live off campus, then decide you want to live on campus again during your senior year in University Residences, that you don&apos;t have any way to select which room you want or which dorm you can have unless it&apos;s Hawkins Hall. Fix this I think they should have made the survey for roommate assignment more intense I thought the process was easy to do and understandable. I thought the process was fairly clear and easy. I did think that the times reserved for administrative purposes were a bit numerous. I understood but went way out of my way to make sure I had a particular roommate, then was assigned a random roommate who happened to be clinically depressed and suicidal. I understood most of it. I understood the application process but it was difficult to pick which type of housing I wanted as during my tour I only saw one location. I wish it would have been better explained that I was able to go to other locations to tour them as well. I was able to get the resident hall a wanted I was assigned first to Hilltop Apartments which I was not at all pleased with. Then I toured them and got used to the idea, liked it even. Then I was reassigned without having been asked or previously alerted to Harrison Dorm. This was on account of a learning community. I was blocked from choosing the housing that I wanted only to find out that the room that I wanted remained open for the year but I was not allowed to switch residences. I was given one on the ground floor just to find out that several top floors (my request) were available just they wouldn&apos;t put me in them. I was informed by my current roommate that I would be getting a new roommate in the middle of the semester before I got an email or any notification from the Residence Halls about this or any notification by my previous roommate. I was very unhappy about this and felt ambushed. I was looking where to live for next year and the office at Cary were very unhelpful. I was looking to room with a transfer student and they could not help me at all. The people at Hillenbrand were great I was not informed that my roommate had left Purdue until I got here. I was not notified of where I would be living for my freshman year until the end of June/early July, which was after my day in camous visit. I wasn&apos;t even assigned to one of my 7 choices that I had. I was very disappointed where I was placed and think that the lottery system is not fair to those who actually take initiative to sign up early. I wasn&apos;t sure if it meant that those things were very important or satisfying currently or overall. I would like to see more room lay outs, and location of room in a building. I&apos;m an international student and the web site did not have all the information clear. I&apos;m glad that University Residences sends me a letter with all the information I need on it. I&apos;m not sure what the previous question is referring to. &quot;Did you understand?&quot; I&apos;ve only applied for housing before my freshman year, so it was just some more paperwork to fill out. I was guaranteed my first choice in housing, so it didn&apos;t seem like that big of a deal to me at the time. If I understand what? the application and assigment commmunication process? I do. In my case, the system had a glitch and it booked me for 2 different apts in Hilltop. The problem was later solved after taking up this matter with the Hilltop Manager. In my freshman year, the choice of housing priority and my roommate request were given no regard at all. Both of those choices were there just for the sake of being there. It is impossible to answer a question when there is no question. What is my respose supposed to rate? It seems like the roommate matching is a joke. It took me forever to figure everything out. I also had to have other people explain it to me. It was about 4 years ago since I last applied, but as I remember I was well informed what learning communities provied. It was along time ago. It was an easy application It was easy to follow the instructions. it was fairly easy It was fairly easy and understandable for everyone. It was just so long ago that I forgot how the process was. When I did it I remember not being confused though. It was not made clear when First Street Towers opened up to applications. It was pretty clear. It was quick and easy to use and I got a speedy reply back. It was really easy to apply for housing and I love that you can actually pick the specific room you want to live in when you reapply It was very easy to apply and when I applied for a single room the process was well explained and I was contacted promptly. it would be better if we could see all the people signed up for all the rooms without going through lots of button-clicking It would be nice to see the layouts of rooms so you know exactly which one you are selecting. It&apos;s kind of a blind guess, unless you have a familiarity with the building. It&apos;s been a few years, and I don&apos;t remember. It&apos;s been a while, but I remember having issues my sophomore year because I got laughed at applying in July due to a bad contract with planned living arrangements. It&apos;s been so long since I&apos;ve used University Residences. I don&apos;t remember much about it. It&apos;s fine Its been so long since I lived in a residence hall that I forgot about the process. Kept getting inaccurate, dated emails about assignment. Liked the virtual tours of the residences Long time ago Loved the Residences. Make it more clear which learning communities have residence requirements. Make sure to make clear to future students that lottery numbers are NOT given based on who accepts their offer to attend first, that it is done through random assignment after all students have accepted. Mine was messed up, I was assigned a person that already had a roommate. This was 6 years ago though. more options for sharing information about yourself to find other with similar character/attributes would be helpful. room mate finding service maybe? more questions about a random roommate need to be on the selection page. Knowing what kind of music my future roommate listens to isn&apos;t important (we all own headphones). Knowing that she likes the room 10000 degrees would have made us think twice about selecting each other off of the page. My application of housing at Purdue Village was never received. They still use paper forms and it was lost when I faxed it. My parents always took/take care of this for me so I can focus on my studies N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A n/a Never had a problem with this task no No problems. none none none none none None none None None none None none none Originally put with wrong roommate. policy and contract info are ok. / but through the process, I do not get to know what kind of room I&apos;m getting.(hawkins) Pretty basic form to fill out. Pretty easy to work through. Really easy .....liked alot! Roomate matching is pretty worthless for the dorms. I don&apos;t know why they would give me a roomate who lives in a trash dump when I specifically said I want someone who is clean. A person&apos;s perference for cleaniness reflects a lot of their personality, and I don&apos;t think the residence admins take that seriously at all. Neat people and sloppy people are inherently different on more levels than just cleaniness. Roommate agreement was a waste of time. Roommate assignment freshman year was a nightmare. should be first come first serve Since the question asked if I &apos;ever&apos; applied for housing, I answered yes. This was the first time I attended Purdue in 1987. some maps of dorms were sideways, ie north was not north Some of the questions are worded funny. SSINFO was still in use. Still unsure if there was some sort of non-refundable deposit involved... Thanks to the staff in Shreve and Hillenbrand who worked with me to set up the Lyceum II Learning Community! Got a bit complicated but they made it work. that was 5 years ago. my recollection is somewhat hazy. That was a long time ago, I don&apos;t really remember the process That was so long ago I don&apos;t even remember. The &quot;Did you understand?&quot; question was confusing in what it was referring to The application should be returned to preference based on application date instead of lumping everyone together and drawing order by luck. the application was relatively easy to understand The communication process was very clear The contract renewal process was weird. That could be made more clear. The contract renewal website was extremely slow and caused a lot of problems while trying to register for housing. The emails were hyperactive and confusing. The first-year freshman application process (i.e. the multiple passwords) were hard to navigate and understand because each web site needed a different password. the introduction on housing.purdue.edu indicated that Meredith dorm room has bedroom bathroom. Should I accuse Meredith committed a scam?! The online application is very clean and easy to use. The online step by step process helped The only bad part was waiting for your time slot to open up. The organization of the dates was very confusing and I felt that I was given the run around when I contacted Windsor Hall about housing options. The process of having hundreds, possibly thousands of people apply for dorm rooms at 6am in the morning is terrible, it was very slow and frustrating the process was confusing and hard to get answers back from housing. The rate keeps rising every single year for no reason and no improvment on the housing quality. The Residence Halls put me in a place that I did not even have on my list of choices. The response time is very late. Verify with me immediately that my roommate request is honored. The system is easy to use and navigate. The system messed up and I got my last choice for housing when after we called in I could have gotten my 2nd. The way that choosing your roommate, as well as how you rank residence halls was very easy and well explained on the site. The website to select housing was confusing and stressful The website was very easy to use and sign up for a room. The only bad part was that it was at 6:30 am. There should be a section online where you know how many of each type of room is available. Also, a measured out floor plan for windsor would be appreciated. There was a mix up in my roommate situation, but it was resolved. It took a little longer than I would have liked, though there was no way to improve your chances of getting the housing you wanted (ie signing up earlier) unless you joined a learning community. I would have been in my last option for housing if I hadnt joined an LC There were no problems here. These questions are all short, and confusing because they are hard to interpret what they are truly asking. They did well with communicating with me. They said there was no record of my application but I had hard copy. Registering for next year for dorm was also problem at first but finally fixed This is an incredibly confusing survey, and quite frankly I do not understand what you are asking...who ever created this needs to rethink the effectiveness of a survey if majority of the audience does not understand the questions. This process is very well organized. This process was really smooth. I lived in a learning community and I knew my residence hall before high school graduation and my roommate over the summer. I remember my friends going to other Big Ten schools had a lot of trouble with their registration process and other schools weren&apos;t as prompt. So, good job! This process was very easy and understandable. This question is poorly worded and hard to understand what is being asked. This was a couple years ago, and I don&apos;t really remember much about it. All I know is that I ended up living on a floor with a bunch of people that I didn&apos;t really fit in with and it made the experience a lot less enjoyable. This was during the 1999-2000 school year, so I have forgot about this process. This was four years ago, before I was a freshman. I really can&apos;t remember much about the process but I don&apos;t remember having any problems. This was much different when I applied for housing 7 years ago so I cannot judge. This was so long ago...I probably should have checked &quot;no&quot; on the last screen... too long ago too many emails Understand the question just asked? Yes. Understand the process? No. understand what? / didn&apos;t respond quickly when i first applied for.. / Should be done 100% online. Understand what? Really vague questions here... Understood it. Vague at best. Very easy to follow and choose. Very high quality experience Very simple process and they made it pain free for me considering I had 48 hours to get into housing before the semester started. Was a very bad lack of communication. Was sent several e-mails, but it wasn&apos;t until I contacted the housing that I received confirmation of housing. Was too long ago to remember anything Was very well executed. way too long ago to remember - back in 1990. What is the question? what the hooey is this question asking? When I applied for housing BEFORE the deadline my application was somehow &quot;lost&quot; and I i was subsequently put on a waiting list for the duration of the summer. When I first applied for housing at Purdue I did not understand the differences between any of the residences because I had only been inside Meredith. Now that I have been at Purdue for 2 semesters I have a working knowledge of most of the residences When I was a freshman, I somehow was confused and didn&apos;t realize I needed to submit a housing application to reserve a spot in the fall when I hadn&apos;t yet accepted to go there. Why can&apos;t we chose our own dorms! With Hilltop Apartments, they sent me no notice of who I would be rooming with, which left me kind&apos;ve in a lurch, after having being informed of my roommate assignment the previous two years I had attended Purdue. Please change that. worked out Worked? RAs were very helpful in making decisions and understanding expectations. Would have like more floor plans to look at online. And easier access to figure out which dorms have singles, and how many. Yes, it was easy to use. 

 

 (HFS3) University Residences–Variety of Housing Options 

 a lot of hte housing is outdated, but there are a variety of different places you could live. i feel that there should be co ed apartments too. but purdue hasn&apos;t granted that yet. I just feel more comfortable living with guys over girls. A lot of options Adding more suites and apartment housing would be nice. Air conditioning All of the dorms seemed really similar except for the price. All of the options seemed rather small and expensive for what you received. All residence options were very similar, and I didn&apos;t get into Hilltop Apts., the one different one. All the features of each hall were made clear. All too expensive. I don&apos;t need air-conditioning. Most of the residence halls are a long walk from my classes. Don&apos;t require a meal plan. There are no dining halls on the main campus, so it is a major time commitment to walk to a dining hall between classes for lunch. All university residences should offer air conditioning in all of their rooms. As a freshman My lowest priority choice was picked for me to live in i.e. broken system As a freshman, you have no options. As a grad student I felt forced out of my space in Hilltop because they wanted to convert it to space for more underclassmen. Having freshman live in their own apartments right by the stadium is a recipe for trouble in my opinion. As a single graduate student, my choices are limited. As long as I have a room that is of decent size I don&apos;t really care what kind it is. Assigned to Wiley; cost~$660 a month with a 15 meal plan. Learned very quickly how to better allot my funds. By the time that I applied at purdue, the variety of housing options were limited. can add 4 bedroom apartments certain dorms fill up really quickly. didnt like that I got stuck at McCutcheon. Hate it. Cheaper simpler housing options needed. Or at least options with a kitchen/kitchenette on every floor. Done very well, very organized. Due to my &quot;lost&quot; application, the choices didn&apos;t matter and I was forced to wait for any open spot. During the year, it is sufficient, but the choices for summer housing are very limited. easy site to use and navigate Every hall has its own charm and bonuses. Excellent selection of housing options. First Street Towers starting at 14K? Yep, that&apos;s a housing option for the majority of students. First Street Towers was a waste of money. The only way to make that dorm worth it would be to reduce the cost. A one bedroom apartment with utilites and food costs less than living there. First Street Towers was where I wanted to live for 2 years while they were building it but when it was finished, it was way too expensive. It would cost me more then I spend on everything else for school (tuition, books, etc.) for a whole year, by itself. freshman. good good job. Good variety Got a little bit of everything for everyone Grad students don&apos;t have many options Grad students with family do not have much of an option. The structures at Purdue Village are very old and in need of replacement. Great variety of undergraduate housing, graduate housing, and family housing. As I&apos;ve been looking at housing and dining services that law schools I&apos;m interested have to offer, I&apos;ve realized how far ahead of the game Purdue is in that area. harrison hall really ***, and its more expensive than other halls. I wish I hadnt put it down as an option, but online it looked just as good as the others Have descriptions of each dorm available, especially for incoming freshman Having the type of housing (all-women, traditional) I wanted was very important. I was glad that the universit offered it and other options for students who wanted a different experience from me. High rise, low rise, apartment, luxurious etc. Purdue has you covered. Hope there is a dining court in Hawkins hall. I am an adult non-traditional student that is a single parent and choose to live off campus with my 2nd grade son. I am satisfied with the options. I applied for a dorm, but once I found out who my roommate would be, I got an apartment instead. Also, the dorms are tiny and some don&apos;t even have air conditioning. I could never live in such a box...sharing bathrooms--eww! I applied to Purdue late and was left with Young Hall as my only option. I appreciate the variety. I currently live in Purdue Village. Although services do not change, rent increased every year without any good reasons. I didn&apos;t get any of my top 3 choices for housing, but I also understand that each student is not guaranteed to receive one of their top 3 choices. Overall I&apos;m satisfied though. I didn&apos;t get my 1st or 2nd choice, but I was very satisfied living in Owen Hall! I didn&apos;t think that I would enjoy living in Cary Quad, but I actually really enjoyed it and made some new friends. I didn&apos;t like the rule that women were not allowed to spend nights on week days. I didnt have much of an option because of a learning community. I do like the chance to look at all of the different housing available to me as a student. I do not understand what you are asking I do not want the residence halls to go to co-ed floors. I don&apos;t think that the variety is that important, as long as there are options that are affordable. I don&apos;t understand the reasons why Hillenbrand should be co-ed next year. I enjoy the residence halls very much. I lived in two different types of rooms in Windsor, and I have been and RA and now an SR I enjoy what all of the different dorms have to offer. They are each unique! I enjoyed being able to have the choice to live in a coed or all female dorm. I enjoyed my stay and choices in the dorms. I feel the guys have more options than the girls. I felt as though I was very limited on the on choices of University housing in comparison to the the actual varieties of housing options. I got my 5th choice so I felt like it didn&apos;t work. I hated my dorm, it was the furthest from campus, and I thought they were supposed to match you w/ similar people that did NOT happen and though i got along w/ the girls in the dorm nearly all of my friends i made were in different dorms (and i completed the application the first day available...) I have been very pleased with the variety of housing options in University Residences I have greatly enjoyed my four years of living in Shreve Hall. I have lived in both double and single rooms in Windsor. I have lived in Harrison Hall and Hilltop Apartments I have not lived in the dorms for nearly 10 years. I was disappointed with my experience. I knew my options I last lived in the dorms in 2000. The conversion to suites is disheartening, I actually liked Cary Quad better than Hillenbrand because of the lack of interaction with other residents. I like all housing here. Places like harrison are really far from campus. Also, housing should be given on a first come first serve basis. I like all the different types of living areas. I personally like the 2-man dorms, but next year, suite-style could be kinda fun! I like housing options that have more of a home feel than a hotel or hospital. First Street Towers and Windsor are moving in the right direction. I like how there are different residence hall styles. This allows everyone to have a place in which they prefer to live. I also like how the residence halls are close together. That way it is easy to get together with friends who live in a different hall. I like that Purdue has a variety of housing options for students ranging from individual living, to four person suites, or to apartment style dorm living. The wide range of living styles gives students a lot of different options to choose from. I like that there are a variety of options that can appeal to all Purdue students. I like that there were a variety of places to live and different options of living. I like the idea of First St. Towers (they weren&apos;t around when I was a freshman). But I would like to see something like a German Wohngemeinshaft, where groups of 6-12 people live together say on a floor and share a full kitchen. I liked living in Young Hall, but you guys wouldn&apos;t let us apply to live there again, however it would remain overflow housing. That was obnoxious. I liked the different types of halls I live in Meredith. I love that as a Sophomore I was able to go to Hillenbrand so that I had a suite with my own bathroom. I love the room I am in now (Cary West), but I never even had it as an option when ranking the housing choices. I think you should notify people that different wings of Cary cost different amounts of money. Putting me in this room, made Purdue cost even more money (seeing as how I am out-of-state). I particularly enjoyed the availability of learning communities. I stayed in Owen and the lack of air conditioning is simply ridiculous. I think it is important to have a multitude of options. More students should be made more aware of them. I think it would be nice to have more only female dorms. I think Purdue does a good job of offering a variety of housing options at different prices I think Purdue should have apartment style dorms. Specifically, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. I know this type of facility is very popular at other universities, but Purdue doesn&apos;t have these. I think residence halls should be coed, more so than they are now. In my opinion, it&apos;s very outdated to have separate wings for guys and girls. I would have liked for the halls to have mixed floors, or at least one guy floor followed by a girl floor, etc. It really stinks having friends of the opposite sex that live in the residence halls because I have to be escorted everywhere, even to the bathroom in the lobby and back. I&apos;m a adult, as are all college students, and having to be escorted everywhere on their side of the residence hall makes me feel like a little kid. A lot of my friends live on the same floor of a residence hall, and I even have to be escorted from room to room or else I&apos;ll get myself and my friends in trouble. I just think that as a responsible collegiate, I should be able to visit and hang out with my friends without feeling like a felon in handcuffs out of my cell, as the R.A.s glare at me and write me up if I&apos;m farther than 2 feet from my &quot;escort&quot;. I think there is a good mix of housing here and most of the places to live are really nice. I wanted Earhart and got it because it is predominately engineers, but having dorms that are major specific would be nice. I wanted to live in Owen because it was cheaper (no air conditioning), but I ended up living in Meredith which was about the same price, but has MUCH smaller rooms. i wanted to live on widsor with a single room but it was all full..... I was able to find a residence hall that met my needs. I was in a learning community, so I had no choice on where I lived. Earhart was nice though. I was placed in a 1-person room with a roommate while others had 4-person rooms with only 2 people living in them. I was very happy with my residence hall experience I was very pleased with the variety of housing options. I wish I could have any chance to have any information about neighbors, distribution of nationalities and the environment before I came in. I&apos;m raising a daughter and near my apartment there are not many her freinds to play with after school. We have to walk to another playground for having fun with friends. I wish Purdue had more suite style living. Hillenbrand is the only option and it is hard to get into. I wish the apartments on campus, such as Hilltop, were a little bit nicer in comparison to the dorms. I wish there were better options for apartment style livning through university housing. Purdue Village offers this but Purdue West is not an appealing place to live. It seems rundown. I wish there were more options that had rooms sharing bathrooms instead of whole floors. I wish they would say which side of the building is even or odd numbers. I wished there were more dorms without meals. I would like to see more on campus choices that provide with an apartment-like atmosphere but not be so expensive like the recent development. I&apos;m not much help in this category, because it&apos;s been years since I&apos;ve applied for housing at Purdue. If the one bedroom apartment of purdeu village have washer and drier, it will be a good news It allowed me to choose my top choice but still have other options if that wasn&apos;t available. It is important to keep inexpensive housing because few can afford to live in places like Hillenbrand and 1st Street. It is nice to have a selection not only to fit your wants but also your budget. It is not made very clear as to which dorms have air conditioning. This is very important to some students. It is unfair that some people get to live in nice, air-conditioned residences, such as Earhart, while other students have to live in crappy residences, such as Wiley or Owen. It&apos;s even more unfair that this is the luck of the draw or because of something like asthma. A friend of mine had her doctor write her a ntoe saying she had allergies so that she got to live in a nice dorm, Earhart. It should be an option for students to stay in residence halls without having a meal plan or on a block meal plan (which is currently only available to Hilltop apartments) it was hard to find what i wanted for a reasonable price It would be nice to have access to floor plans, room layouts, and availability before housing renewal time. Also it would be nice to have cheaper and more single/suite options for upperclassman. It&apos;s all good IU has better housing for cheaper, but then again that cost is after the delicious food is factored in just because i&apos;m over 21...do u have to always give me the place for old people...what ever it called!!! Just fine Just Hawkins and PV.. First Stree Tower is too expensive. Just way too expensive. There is no reason to force a student to buy a meal package, other than that is where the profit margin lies. Living on campus is convenient, I understand that. However after room and board, it is way too expensive. I could dorm in a major city like Chicago for less than what I&apos;m paying here at Purdue. loads of options, all with higher prices than the last. Long time ago Lots of choices :) Loved having several options while enrolled at the university. Male only residences are much nicer than female only or even co-ed. Many dorms are subpar Many options should be available for students. Many options to suit all needs Mccutcheon *** Meredith Hall is a dump. Meredith should not be an option for 2 residents. They should be singles! It is not a good environment for two students to share. More Co-ed residence experiences. More learning communities offered in all dormitories More individual rooms, but prices need to be more affordable than 1st street towers more info More options necessary- separation by wing and single-sex dorms are becoming a little outdated, and more bathrooms/showers are needed for those of us who have friends of the opposite sex that visit from time to time. More residence halls should be made co-ed by floor, mixing in males and females on the same floor. I&apos;m looking forward to experiencing this in Hillenbrand Hall next year. More single rooms!! more single rooms/ suite options More singles Most facilities are the same- old and outdated. Most of the rooms are the same. I&apos;m not sure what you mean by variety. Most people don&apos;t even consider Hilltop or Pville as options. N/A N/A N/A n/a N/A N/A Need air conditioning units in all dorms. Need cheeper options. Need more affordable housing. Instead of building expensive single rooms, building more community like res halls again - that is what the college experience is about - having the memories of roommates and living in &quot;dorms&quot; (or residence halls as Purdue has) Need more flexibility on meal plans; more likely they are sunk costs of housing contracts and that&apos;s too much for many students Need more halls with male and female residents living on the same floor. need more housing options with air conditioning and more efforts made to accomadate those with health problems who require air conditioning Need more housing with suite style living ao evedryone wont be stuggling to get into Hillenbrand. People who don&apos;t get in wont have to settle for living somewhere they don&apos;t want to. Need more updated but economical options Never had a problem with this task no none none none None none None none none none none None Not as many options for first year students, but plenty of choices otherwise. Not enough options that didn&apos;t require a meal plan. NOT ENOUGH SINGLES (OUTSIDE OF THE NEW DORM!) not many girls only dorms. Not so many options for people that want to live with a friend: either Hawkins (but most of the rooms have neither private bathroom nor kitchen) or nothing. Not so many possibilities for graduate students. Offer for more single rooms, I understand the purpose of them and why there cannot be so many, however, there are few to begin with even with including all of First Street Towers. Any other one within the resident halls are always blocked until mid-summer and by that time the person either loses their chance for one or has signed up for another room and is never told an opening has occurred. one crappy place for married students ***! Only did freshman year and was in learning community, so limited experience. Options were sufficient. Owen Hall is great Plenty of housing options. I wish there was one more grad housing place besides hawkins that was by the dining courts Price of single rooms is atrocious. Prices are sky-rocketing, so a variety of choices is not available to all. The dorms and living communities with the most perks cost a lot of money. Process unnecessarily difficult. Purdue is one of the few schools I am aware of which still segregates men and women (co-ed by wing counting as separated) - I feel that university residences would feel more like a home with a population representative of that on campus, with more opportunities for men and women to interact. Purdue should have real co Ed dorms. Purdue Village is way to old, I think we as graduate students deserve more. When is Purdue constructing brand new residences for graduate students? It seems that Purdue is more worried for better life quality of undergrads only. Quite a few of the dorms are pretty much the same. Residence money is poured into the RSC and athletic fields which I never use. Seems to have improved Significant improvement since I have been here. Just as long as people don&apos;t end up back in the Union Hotel for half the fall semester. Since the question asked if I &apos;ever&apos; applied for housing, I answered yes. This was the first time I attended Purdue in 1987. Single graduate student housing is problematic Single graduate students are no longer allowed to apply to Purdue Village as I understand it and they have to live in the new buildings in PV which is far more expensive. Single rooms are a premium, and are not usually available. Would be nice if there were some single room options that didn&apos;t cost twice as much as a double. Basically, First Street Towers is way too expensive and is a joke. small rooms / shouldn&apos;t put AC in all dorms-not everyone likes it or can agree on temp small rooms and can&apos;t for sure select roommate can defiantly affect a student&apos;s studying. So many great options! I really love the new addition, first street towers. I have lot of friends there that love it. Some of the RAs at Windsor were racists. Some res halls are too far away. I feel sorry for people assigned to mcutcheon or harrison. Millions of dollars were spent on a new,closer res. hall, but many students cannot afford to live there. Still don&apos;t know what the quesstion is. Stop putting money into building that aren&apos;t really needed at the moment and put it into existing buildings that need to be re-modeled and renovated (i.e. HILLTOP APARTMENTS AND PURDUE VILLAGE HOUSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Students are given plenty of different options The costs of housing are pretty excessive. Especially when considering the condition of some of the residence halls. I was much more satisfied leaving the University Residences. The dorms are too conservative with the way they separate males and females. All of the colleges that my friends go to have their co-ed dorms set up with either a floor of boys then a floor of girls, or with boys and girls on the same floor. The so called &quot;co-ed&quot; dorms we have do not even allow you to walk around on the girls or boys side without an escort which makes it extremely difficult if you want to visit a friend or the opposite sex. / / Another thing is that not all of the dorms have the same amenities such as air conditioning. The dorms have become very expensive, so why pay twice as much for the dorms when you could get an apartment on campus for half that price? the dorms kind ***, nice on the inside but it&apos;s a marathon to get to class The Housing Options gives good detail about the differences between housing. The only dorms that were ever renovated when I was living in them were the ones that didn&apos;t need renovation. The options are declining it seems. The parking rules in Purdue Village are ludicrous. There are no metered parkings. Guest parking permits have to be collected in person for 5$ a day!!! There is no place even for temporary parking of guests. Add to that the shabby rooms which are way overpriced. The people were always very friendly and helpful! The prices are much higher than the market. It is too expensive. There is no option for graduate students. The options for graduate students are really not good. Most of the single graduate students want to live alone, this way we can concentrate in study and to be productive. The few option are to expensive to a TA can afford. We spend many hours trying to find a place where we can live and worrying with where to live, while we should be studying and research to the university. The prices are too high. The residence that I received was not even in the list of preferences that I made on the website. The variety in housing is good, but some apartments through the university would be great. First Street Towers is nice, but those are all single rooms. If some 2 or 3 or 4 bedroom apartments were listed through the university I would love that. There are a variety of options at Purdue, which is a good thing. It bothers me that there is a socio-economic divide between students in certain types of housing, especially First Street Towers. There are a wide variety of choices available There are many options however many of the residence halls are older and in need of renovations. There are not many options for graduate students with families. There aren&apos;t very many suites and triple rooms, so if you are a freshman waiting to apply for housing, all of the good rooms are taken by the upperclassmen by the time you are able to apply. There is a decent variety of rooms but the compulsory meal plans are a dampener since many international vegetarian students hardly want to eat at the dining halls and the money is wasted due to the lack of use of meal plan There is flagrant and ridiculous discrimination against graduate students who are not married and do not have families. My only housing choice as a pet-owning single grad student is to NOT live in University Residences, which is not desirable for someone whose sole purpose is to go to school, is paying money to go to school, and who wants to do everything possible to be successful in school. Instead, housing is given to people, SIMPLY BECUASE THEYRE MARRIED OR HAVE FAMILIES, to people who do nothing for the University, contribute nothing to the University, and yet take advanatage of University resources that SHOULD be reserved for those involved with the school. Its a problem. There is not enough information about each type of housing, for example, Purdue village housing. There is not much that is different concerning the residence halls. Now with the new setup this is a little different, but the increased money makes it difficult to even be a viable option. There is something for everyone there is too little choice for single graduate students. Young and Hawkings cannot cook, Purdue village charge too much and you have to share a one-bed room apt with another one. There meal plans are very expensive for their value. A less expensive cafeteria style eating plan would be nice. I also believe making us tie money up in dining dollars that can only be used in over-priced stores is gipping us. It should not cost more to live in a tiny dorm room than to have an entire apartment. There need to be more affordable singles on campus. First street is not a viable option for many students. There needs to be more affordable single rooms available. There needs to be more upperclass housing. there should be nicer options for girls There should be somewhere that allows pets besides PVIL. I am married, and I really would rather live in Hilltop,but, I have a cat and 1 mouse. There were a wide variety of housing options to choose from. They all should be air conditioned! They are all waaaaaay over priced for what we get. they did not know the term &quot;self-catered&quot;.. i am an international student and we have self catering flats back home in NZ They do offer widespread options. they should have women and men be so seperated. too expensive for the lame survice Too many double rooms that are too small. First Street Towers is a good step but far too expensive. I don&apos;t like community bathrooms and I get a feeling that many of the halls that I have stayed in are not up to date. Carpeting in the rooms would be nice. However, they are functional and have served me well throughout my time at Purdue. Very important to offer single rooms at a reasonable rate. Very nice facilities. When I applied for housing, some of the singles were blocked off even though the single rooms stage already happened so that was confusing Why can&apos;t we chose our own dorms! Wide selection to choose from, typically get what you want. Wiley Hall was great! Will get more people to live in, if consider larger rooms/apartment style suites. Less singles/doubles, but 8-mans or 6-mans. This makes it more fun and enjoyable to live in (noticed from other schools) Would be nice to allow males and females to live in the same room if they chose. Would like more singles to be available, but ones that are still close to the price of Earhart or Shreve rooms would like to see a university apartment with separate bedrooms and full kitchen Would like to see more decorations, i.e. plants and such in the springtime around the halls Would prefer coed/ suite style housing over seperate towers and community facilities. You dont really get to pick the dorm you go in. 

 

 (HFS4) University Residences–Environment Conducive to Academic Success 

 &quot;Quiet Hours&quot; are only helpful if enforced. And if enforced to harshly they can cause tension and resentment among residents and RAs 24 hour silent hours during finals in the hallway was excessive (this was Windsor). If someone really needs silence they should have somewhere else to go because for people who did not have an exam that day, sitting in silence was terrible. (Quiet hours would be understandable, silent was not) 5 years ago, Owen did not have enough computers, or a way to quickly print off things for classes and with department budget cuts, students have to print off EVERYTHING. A designated quiet study lounge like the one in Meredith Hall would be useful in the rest of the halls. A lot of study areas need better hours. Especially, on the weekends. Also, need more computer access, especially in the basement of Hicks. a lot of times there will be people just hanging out in the study areas.. its not always quiet and a lot of times there are tvs or other things going on. not very conducive to studying A silent reading room in each dorm would be nice - could put it where the computer labs used to be Absolutely wonderful. Add more. People are never usually that quiet. All residence halls need to have a completely silent study room that is enforced. All study areas should be unlocked at all times!@ Although I don&apos;t believe that there are enough study areas in the dorms, I do think that most of the time they are quiet and used appropriately. As a matter of fact, many times now that I live in an apartment, I realize just how great/convenient the study areas were in university residences. At Hawkins the meeting rooms are restricted to RAs. I would say unfair treatment with other students. bad lighting and hard to concentrate with service workers always making a fuss and lots of noise. Better in some building than others. Shreve was not awful, Hillenbrand was quite good. Better ventilation and more available internet. Both the study areas and the dorms are still fraught with noise. It&apos;s hard for me to study in either place. Bring back the computer labs!!! Bring back the iTap labs to Residence Halls!! But very rarely, they tend to be clean but the heaters/ac units are very loud and distracting. Cary quad needs a computer lab and more study areas with good lighting and proper seats and tables Cary Quad Northern Buildings do not have as much space for quiet studying. Have not explored other parts of Cary, though. Cary study areas are often locked!!!!! Cleaning standards at University Residences seem better than the rest of campus. Compared with living off campus, the residences on campus have an environment much more conducive to academic success. Computer lab in Cary Computer labs, even if small, would be nice in ALL dorms could be better crowded, small current residence hall does not provide very good quiet study areas. Depending upon location, the study areas are still generally noisy and difficult to concentrate in. Did this during undergrad. Didn&apos;t utilize study or common areas. Drafting table availability would be nice in more dorms drinking/drunk people need to be dealt with better, more enforcement, more penalties to getting caught Drug and alcohol use in the dorms was terrible. Students regularly broke rules and laws regarding both. Underage drinking and drug use was encouraged by my RA. Living in the dorms was among the worse experiences of my time at Purdue. The room mate that Purdue assigned me was a drug dealing nudist. Drunk people yelling in the hallways at 4 am should be punished, not hushed. During Freshman year in the dorms, the study areas were definitely a perfect place to study earhart study area needs to be improved since it&apos;s connecting to the lobby thus it effects the study process Earhart&apos;s Halls are EXTREMELY loud - I could NEVER study in my room due to the EXCESSIVE noise coming from the hallway. My RA did very little to correct this situation. I absolutely love First Street Tower&apos;s - this residence is extremely conducive to studying Finding places to be alone can be very difficult. Even among the multiple communal areas, there are always other people around, detracting from the satisfaction that would otherwise accompany periodic alone time. fine. Frats across the streeet are always very noisy. good study areas in cary quadrangle GPA increased by about .5 in one semester after i moved out of the dorms great! Hand-me-down chairs, tile floors with no texture on the walls to abosrb misc. sounds. hard to find a quiet place at times Harrison Hall is not a great place. Harrison needs better study areas...more private areas would be nice. Harrison needs more quiet study areas. have only used for group work, so it wasn&apos;t exactly quiet. I imagine the noise could have been disruptive for those not working on group projects Helps build community and promotes academia Hicks is great; could use more power outlets though (most students like to study with laptops) Hillenbrand has wonderful lobbies to study in since they don&apos;t all have a piano located in them, majority of the other Residence Halls don&apos;t have the option of being away from the piano which makes the environment much less conducive to studying. Hillenbrand&apos;s study areas are phenomenal. Shreve&apos;s could use some work, they&apos;re old and not very private. Hilltop does not have these. Hilltop needs a larger study area. The room is almost the size of a bathroom. I always used the resources when I lived in dorms. I had my best GPA when I lived in. I am very pleased with the study areas, but sometimes they are not as quiet as they should be. I have especially had problems with this on dead week and finals week. i can&apos;t use them becuse there are too many other people in them I didn&apos;t care for the packing up and moving required to use a study room, but it is completely worth it if you can&apos;t effectively study in your own room for whatever reason. I didn&apos;t often have that problem, but I sincerely appreciated the option. I don&apos;t live in the dorms since this happened, but I think it&apos;s a bad choice to remove the computer labs in the dorm halls. Those are valuable study/ homework areas. I don&apos;t use them a lot because I find them very distracting. I enjoy the 24 hour quiet areas to study in, but only when they are QUIET. Some more needs to be done to make sure they are kept how they were meant to be used. I feel like the chair chosen for study areas were chosen at random and no attention was paid to ergonomics or comfort. (esp. hawkins hall) I feel that the lobby should be subjected to quiet hours as well. Although I have no problem with talking, it&apos;s irritating when people in the lobby and rec rooms are loud enough to be heard clearly in the study rooms. I have but they are not very comfortable and there are not alot of outlets to plug my laptop into, at least in the Windsor basement. It is easier to study in Windsor than it was in McCutcheon last year, but McCutcheon had more social interaction. I have continued to be very impressed with the efficacy with which quiet hours in the residence halls are maintained. I have used some of the study areas; however, most of the time it has been for phone calls. I find that in Windsor this was the main use of the study rooms. I have used the study areas, but I mainly stay in room to study...which works well due to our quite hour polilcy. I highly advocate for the study rooms in the bottom of Harrison Hall. I like how most dorms have small quite areas where students can study or work on homework alone or with a small group of people. This allows students to concentrate on their studies and to achieve success in their courses. I like the study areas. I liked that there were areas to study in the residence halls, but I want to comment on the effectiveness of &quot;quiet hours&quot;. The hall and floor that I lived at was a nightmare. Most of the people on the floor weren&apos;t in the same academic program that I was in, and found they had much more time to go wild if you will. Nobody seemed to follow the rules for being quiet and I had the most difficult time of my life trying to sleep at night. It got to the point that the R.A. didn&apos;t actually seem to be sleeping in his room at night either because he too could not get sleep. I don&apos;t know what your ideas are on this, but not being able to sleep at night due to noise does not deem an environment conducive at all to academic success. I live at Meredith Hall, and there are always people running up and down the hall and people screaming at night. At 1 am it is not uncommon for people to scream. I think that it would be nice if my RA did something about it. And it would be better if there were penalties for not respecting quiet hours after being warned several tiems, such as a fine or for extreme cases, being kicked out of the residence halls. I live in Windsor, which provides plenty of quiet space for studying and which enforces its quiet hours. I don&apos;t have many problems. I lived in Hilltop freshman year with four people, quiet study areas would&apos;ve been very useful, yet were not provided in this residence hall. I lived in Winsor before the renovations, so the spaces were limited. i love the libraries but ITAP barley works when connecting to the internet I love the study areas in First Street Towers!!! I spend a lot of time there!!!!! I LOVE the study rooms! I really enjoy the furniture of the lobby in my building. It is comfortable to study down there. I really like that some of the study areas in the Residence Halls are open for anyone and not just the people living in that particular place. I studied in the Willey Pot and Derby. It was a good place to study in a group; however, it was always crowded and very loud. I study in my room. I study in my dorm room, but the hallway is quite. I used lounges, rec areas, and study areas in the dorms. All were useful. I used the quiet lounge in Meredith a lot my freshman year and am in the top 25% of my class, therefore it is very useful! I used the study areas a couple of times, and most of the time they were quiet. I used the study areas occasionally, but I lived in the Hilltop small units with 4 roommates, and the only available study areas there were my room (not conducive to studying) or the basement laundry areas (again, not very conducive for studying). i used the study areas when i had a roommate, but no i live in a single, so i don&apos;t need to I used to use the study areas ALL the time. It was nice because in some areas everyone was quiet. I utilize the activity rooms and private study rooms often. I wish Hilltop had more computer access. I wish there were more of them and that they weren&apos;t so unattractive. I wish they weren&apos;t so cold. I would use but always found it to be to noisy and other students distracting. I would use the study areas to get out of my room. Also I would meet people their to have group meetings or to have fun with friends. I&apos;m an RA - it&apos;s my job I&apos;m living in Hilltop. I&apos;ve never heard of those. I&apos;ve seen many of the renovations throughout campus, and have only seen improvement. Keep up the good work! I&apos;ve used the study areas to practice speeches that I&apos;ve had to give in class. In Meredith the wireless internet in the study lounge does not work well. In my personal experience, RAs have not been efficient in making sure that fellow residents are being quiet during the quiet hours. This was disruptive to both my sleep and study habits. In Wiley hall the piano upstairs is directly over the Wiley study room and it is very hard to concentrate sometimes, it could easily be moved to the east side of the lounge. In windsor, our study areas are open so we hear every conversation going on in the lobby. It makes it super difficult to study. It all depends on the individuals you live with but generally it&apos;s loud and sometimes hard to study. It always seems like the pianos are in common study areas. It&apos;s intimidating to try to play when others are studying around you; likewise, it&apos;s frustrating to try to study while others are playing the piano. it can be loud there sometimes it could get loud at times it is good It is not really a quiet study area. The room is used too often for programs when students want to study and since there is no sign indicating that it is a quiet study room, some decide to have party/game-night/etc at the study area, which all contribute to students resorting to library or their room for studying. It is often difficult to find quiet places; quiet hours are not observed. It is too noisy to study in this erea. I hope there could be more choices, like group study room, quiet study erea, especially for residence hall which are very distant to Purdue Library. It might help if there were some designated quiet small group study areas (not just suggested); often, even the &quot;quiet study lounge&quot; got incredibly loud with groups working and people chatting. It took me a while to find the study areas, but once I did they really helped. It was difficult when the RA didn&apos;t do anything to stop stuff on the floor. It was nice to have someplace to go, but if there was a group working together in the same area, it was difficult to concentrate. It was too loud so it was easier to just go back to my room and put headphones on or go to a library on campus. It would be nice to have a larger study lounge on each floor. It&apos;s a pain to study with people because the rooms do not have wireless internet and the majority of homework is online. It&apos;s hard to control this but whenever I try and study in a study area, there a people talking on the phone or laughing and talking while walking by. I go into my room to get some quiet but then I have loud neighbors that have a constantly loud alarm clock in the morning. It&apos;s not the presence or absence of study areas that&apos;s the problem. It&apos;s the fact that just because a neigbor is within quiet hours regulations doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t hear their TV blasting through the wall right next to your ear when you&apos;re trying to sleep. RA&apos;s who play nice to their residents and don&apos;t actually enforce quiet hours also can make sleeping or studying difficult. Keep the libraries open later! Lawson Commons is a great place to study libraries better than residences Lobbies and other study areas are useful Lobbies can get EXTREMELY loud and uncomfortable for those trying to study. People at the front desk often say that they have no control over volume, but in order to make the environment conducive for studying AND recreation, I believe a gray area between chaotic and silent must be enforced, Long time ago loud at times. Louder folks are usually the ones hanging out in these lounges! lounges are missing wifi love learning communities Mccutcheon is awful. It is so far away from the academic campus McCutcheon&apos;s dont have doors for the studying areas. It gets loud when people walk in the basement. Even the people next to you. I never go down there any more Mine was never quiet, its was always too loud to study in. Minimal space available, did not often study there More computer labs are needed in the Resident Halls. More computers in dorms more learning communities MORE OF THEM.. Please More public computers available at my time would have been nice. This is probably not a problem anymore since more people have laptops. More tables and personal study areas necessary More would be nice More would be nice. Biggest problem was electrical outlets for laptops, and comfortable seating, especially in Shreve basement. Most halls don&apos;t have very good study areas. A floor study area would be nice so we don&apos;t have to lug everything down to the lobby every time we want to go study. Most of the floor got ready to party quite loudly (interrupting studying) almost every evening, and then come back (in 15 min intervals between 1 and 3:30ish) drunk and noisy, interrupting sleep. Most of the time the study area is full of kids playing video games or something stupid Most of the time, the study areas were quiet, but sometimes people went in there just to talk. Most of the times students don&apos;t use them for studying, and it is very difficult for people who do intend to use them for studying. Most work got done in those areas, and a place to escape my roommate with bad hygiene. My only complaint is the general state of some of the residence halls --&gt;too loud My RA herself wouldn&apos;t follow quiet hours during the week. N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A n/a need better and more study areas in dorms need better sound insulation in dorm rooms Need more computer labs never used Never used them, not enough of them no no comment. No enforced quiet hours when I was in McCutcheon--I remember studying in the basement bathroom when I was cramming for a test and it was too loud everywhere else in the building. No one ever enforced the quiet hour rules. no sound-proof.. noise, far away from hilltop, the internet is not alway good Noisy and dark. Noisy. none none none none none None none none not all halls have the same study areas, Hilltop for example needs larger study places and lounge areas, not just 1 room with 3 lounge chairs Not enough computers not enough PRIVATE study rooms..neighbor is so noisy. I actually mentally suffered from the noise a lot. not enough space or computers Not enough spaces on campus! not many rooms for studying. Not my favorite environment to study in, but it was usually quiet so that was good. not quiet at all Not really a fan, I&apos;d rather study in my own room. Not sure what the study areas are for, or why they are occasionally locked. Not the greatest study areas, and there aren&apos;t very many of them in the dorms I&apos;ve been in not very prone to studying. Not very quiet... anywhere I go. nothing is cozy or comfortable Occasionally loud groups congregate in lobbies and the front desk staff never tells them to shut up even when it&apos;s clear that people are studying there. Often there is a lot of noise in the residences, and it can make studying difficult to do in your room or in designated study areas. I often had to go to the libraries to study or work on my homework rather than staying in my room. often times the lounges arent the best place to study. Try using better lighting (non-florescent) On average the halls and rooms are just as quiet as the study areas. only while doing laundry did i use the study areas Owen Hall was not conducive to studying whatsoever, mainly because my RA was never around. Hawkins Hall is good for studying. people always talk in the study hours, i think that quiet hours should be enforced People are always talking and the RA&apos;s are not good at making sure people are quiet during quiet hours. I was very disappointed this year. It&apos;s the reason I am leaving the residence halls. People are too loud, restrictions should be made people in the study rooms are very disruptive. People loudly play card games in these areas. Or throw a football around. Seriously. people need to be quiet in the reserved quiet study areas People sometimes don&apos;t understand to shut up at times. People were loud in the bathrooms during quiet hours at times. Quiet and silent hours need to actually be enforced! Quiet hours are often not enforced very well. Quiet hours are respected. And, the study areas are appealing. quiet hours help Quiet hours not always quiet Quiet hours not enforced much, and when people are noisy inside their room, it can often be heard through the wall or down the hall. Quiet hours should include being inside your room. Quiet hours on my floor are rarely enforced. Quiet study areas need greater enforcement. Quiet study lounges are where I do the vast majority of my studying. It&apos;s so much better/quiter than my room or the libraries. Please keep these going! quietness in study areas is not enforced Quite and peaceful a great place to go. RAs need to enforce quiet hours RAs need to enforse quiet hours. RAs not doing enough! Regardless of the study areas, the environment in the freshman dorms was absolutely NOT conducive to academic success. My grades were horrible until I moved out of the dorms. Everyone in the dorm was loud, dirty and not putting studies first. I had to completely leave the dorm in order to get anything done. Everyone broke the rules and drank alcohol in their rooms. I was glad to leave. Residence hall quite hours are not enforced. same as above comments Since the question asked if I &apos;ever&apos; applied for housing, I answered yes. This was the first time I attended Purdue in 1987. Some are old seeming. Some have been very helpful, while some have been a run-down, pointless use of space. some residences are really really noisy. / some RA&apos;s are do not conduct their duties responsibly. Some study areas are not actually what they claim to be. People are loud and disrespectful. Some study room in Hawkins Hall can not connect to the wireless internet, which is not quite convenient. And some times, the study loungh is not quite quiet. some were clean, some weren&apos;t very eco-friendly Sometimes can get loud, but nothing you can do for that Sometimes it is still loud in study areas but there is going to be some noise no matter where you go. sometimes noisy, not enough space, not conducive for studying rather go to a library Sometimes on the weekends, the residence halls were rather rowdy for studying. This was a couple of years ago. Sometimes people end up getting very loud around there, and there is really no way of enforcing the quiet. Sometimes people would be talking in the quiet study areas which was annoying. Sometimes study areas can get kind of loud. Sometimes the noise is not controlled. Plus, no computer labs available. Sometimes there is nowhere to study in PVCC when someone holds events or activities. Kind of annoying. Something must be done to ensure places for study. sometimes there needs to be more faculty coming through the study halls and quiting loud groups down Sometimes there wasn&apos;t enough space. Many of the study areas are also used for other purposes. Sometimes they can be a little loud. Sometimes, especially during finals week, the libraries become a little too crowded. Spacious and well-lit. still too loud study area is alway noisy Study areas always seem to be very crowded. Study areas are a good way to get out of the bedroom to study. They are kept quiet and are used mainly for studying Study areas are amazing, especially if they are designated as Quiet Study areas. I live in a very loud hallway, so it&apos;s nice to have a quiet place to go still inside the building. Study areas are anything but. Always noisy, disrespectful students utilizing study areas for everything but studying. study areas are generally a quiet environment that facilitate learning. very happy with the study lounges Study areas are generally high-quality, although many lack comfortable furniture. Tarkington&apos;s main lobby is an excellent study area, as well as is the main lobby in Lawson. It would be great to see more study areas tailored to students needs (quiet areas with plenty of table space, power outlets, adequate lighting, and easily accessible break areas for food and coffee). Study areas are never quiet and studying is very difficult to do at Harrison. I often must travel across campus to a library: none are present on this end of campus. Study areas are nice to use. Bring back computer labs. Study areas are rarely conducive to studying, because large groups of people (who may or may not be studying) congregate and talk loudly. Study areas are usually very busy and not conducive to studying at all. Study areas are very good to have. I like the ones on each floor in Hillenbrand. The rooms do not have much table area to do homework Study areas in dorms are small, cramped, and usually not comfortable (either too hot or too cold). In fact, in Harrison and Hillenbrand, they were almost never used. Study areas in Hilltop do not exsist. Study areas in Owen Hall are great. study areas were extremely helpful, especially if my roommate had her boyfriend or friends over Study areas? What study areas? Cary Quad had nothing of the sort in the SW building. Study room in Windsor is great! study rooms were never quite hence why I moved out of the dorms Taking away the computer labs made studying in the residence halls nearly impossible. It is 2010 and the idea that only two residence halls have computers in them is crazy. students have to be on an Itap computer for 20-40% of their classes, and only having labs which are located far from where residents want to study is very inconvenient. Taking computer labs out of dorms? We all know how essential that technology is to being successful in college. This idea of removing key educational tools from students who need them most seems completely backwards to me. I don&apos;t know what the motivation behind giving students LESS availability to computers is, but I&apos;m sure there is an alternative. I am 110% sure I would not have gotten through my my freshman year without the use of the computer labs in my residence hall, and even when there were 2 labs, they were full much of the time due to student use. tarkington and wiley need nicer study areas like McCutchen. Also, all residence halls should have full computer labs The quiet study areas are fine, unless other students come in and talk, play music, etc. The &quot;date rooms&quot; in Windsor are amazing. Having a room to yourself to study is a great option. The bigger the dorm building, the louder it gets. It is horrible to live in most of the highrise dorms because half of the people don&apos;t understand that they are not living at home. The music is always too loud from one of the nearby rooms throughout the four years I lived in the dormitories. The classrooms and computer lab in PV is very useful. The computer lab in Purdue Village, where I live, is too small. The computer labs are generally full of kids watching youtube or on facebook, so when I did actually need to use the labs for something there was rarely a computer available for actual coursework. The cubbies in Meredith were the best places to study! The floor I was on was not respectful to studying stuents. The RA seemed to have very little control over the noise levels. The iT@p albs in Tarkington and Wiley were the best (when they were still there). I used them often. I only used the study areas once or twice, but they were usually quiet and comfortable. The merideth hall study lounges were FANTASTIC The RA&apos;s need to be more strict with noise levels The res halls are loud (until about midnight), but the study areas are worse. The residence hall was always noisy, the lack of air conditioning made my allergies horrid, and the lack of desk space made having academic books on the desk impossible. The rooms surrounding mine always blast music, and thus i must seek out study areas to maintain academic success The study area was sometimes a little too noisy. The study areas are a nice amenity and are usually kept clean. They can be crowded at times. The study areas are kept clean and are generally quiet. The study areas are not that conducive to studying, they are open areas that allow a lot of noise and distraction to flow in. The study areas are one of the best parts of living in on-campus housing. The study areas are really nice. The study areas are well-equipped. However, the &apos;quiet&apos; study areas aren&apos;t so quiet nor is it enforced. I find myself walking to the library because it is nearly impossible to study in a study area with all of the chatter and shenanigans. The study areas at Earhart are particularly good! The study areas at Hawkins Hall is quiet, clean and very conducive for studying. The study areas get a bit too noisy sometimes. The study areas have weird hours that I haven&apos;t yet figured out. They would be most useful to me between the hours of 2am and 8am, and I think they are closed at that time. The study areas in the residence halls could be separated from lobby areas more than they currently are to reduce noise, but are adequate overall. The study areas on the main floor were very helpful and useful. The areas designated on each floor were usually noisy and unproductive. The study areas should be close to silent, but many people still talk on their cell phones much louder than necessary the study areas still have people who use them to socialize so it is hard to get studying done in them The study areas were great places to meet with friends or lab partners to get work done. The study areas were never quiet for very long though. Usually people played music or would talk in there. The study areas, for the most part, are good. Some seem like they could be better, though. The conditions aren&apos;t always great. The study lounge in Shreve is a good place for group projects. Quiet enough to work, but not so quiet you feel bad if you talk. The study lounges on each floor of Hillenbrand are very helpful. It is nice to have a quiet place to study. The study room on the 13th floor of Hawkins has horrible lighting to study and it would be nice to have web access The study rooms in hawkins...the ones in each floor are USELESS without PAL2.0 in them...its the 21st Century, get with the technology The tables aren&apos;t on the same level as the chairs, so it is hard to write without bringing a book to write on. The third and fourth floors of HSSE library are too cold most of the time for extended study time. The wide variety of studying areas was very helpful The wireless is good. The wireless is intermittent. They are too small at meredith. There are a lot of different options to chose from There are always a bunch of kids just playing games in their. It&apos;s louder than the room There are always people talking in the study areas making it difficult to focus. there are many study areas. There are no quiet study rooms in Earhart except the east lounge, which RAs often kick you out of for dorm events. There are not enough study halls. They cut some of the individual study halls and just made one large room which is not helpful.Most of the time the rooms are large and used for other things than homework which is very frustrating and no one will do anything about it. There are not many study rooms/areas in the dorms. Many of the designated areas are in the lobby and those can be loud at times. There are plenty and they are very quiet and there are many of them. There are plenty of places on campus to study so it ins&apos;t as important to be able to study in the residence halls. There are plenty of places to study in groups, however there is no where designated for individual study. Sometimes the study lounges get noisy. There are several places to study, however I would like to see more computer labs in the residence halls. Having one or two printers solely for printing does not work with 800 residence in one building. It makes it difficult to print things for class. There can be more areas for study. Although it would also help if there were more specified on like campus maps. The science study areas get very crowded, especially around finals time. There is always a quiet comfortable place to study. There is no quiet place in a university residence building. At all. None. It&apos;s terrible for people who need quiet while working. Even in my room, I hear nothing but people upstairs slamming junk on the floor. Residents should be told to be mindful of the noise that travels down the building as they drop things on the floor. There is no truly useful study area in Cary Quad that does not also double as a recreational area, at least as far as I have been informed. There need to be more study areas. There needs to be more money put into study areas instead of spending money on athletics that only benefit a small portion of the students. There really needs to be more COMPUTER LABS in the residence halls. McCutcheon is the only hall with a fully functioning itap lab. I believe it should be required for all residence halls to have a fully functional lab. There should be more silent study areas. There should be more than two computers to print in a residences because some people just sit there and play games when others need to print things for class. There were good when i lived there There&apos;s still a lot of noise in the lobbies in Meredith. It&apos;s hard to study. They all seem quite noisy and distracting and could use more computers. They are always filled or dirty. They are generally noisier than my room They are good for group projects but not for personal study, I find. they are loud and not good for studying at all. there is literally no where in harrison reserved for quiet study. THey are loud, and used for recreation rather than actual studying Where I have been. They are not usually used as study areas. They are too close to the television areas. This makes study areas very loud and ineffective. They can be loud, but I enjoy them. They can get quite loud sometimes because people are not courteous when entering the dorms. (Vawter has study room right next to entry of the dorm and people come in screaming and talking really loud. They need to be more quiet. People come into them just to talk on the phone which is reaally distracting. They were not as goo as say a library. They were pretty good at both dorms i lived in, but the computer lab in hillenbrand was not very good at all and unfortunately i needed the computer to do a lot of my hw. They were pretty nice. The internet did not always work in all the study areas. They were sometimes noisey and not very comfortable or appealing to be in. They&apos;re convenient and well kept. They&apos;re ok This is the loudest campus I have ever been to in regards to the library facilities and computer labs. Thre is little room for studying at the Community Center of Purdue Village. To many people won&apos;t shut up when I&apos;m trying to read! Haha too loud Too loud to study many times. RA&apos;s didn&apos;t really monitor the areas effectively. Too many Asians yelling in study area makes them useless. too many kids, not enough self control Too many residents living above us. Two bedroom apartments shouldn&apos;t allow eight people. too much noise and trash, especially on game days Too noisy...people use it as a place to talk on the phone and not a place to study Too small. Typically study in residence, but common study areas are good for group work. usually too small to accommodate many people. Very convenient on the floors of Hillenbrand. They are my most successful place to study Very helpful, but sometimes people are loud. I highly enjoy computer labs. Very little volume control. Music was played really loudly during quiet hours and nothing was done about it. We could always use more and better study areas. We had suitemates in Hillenbrand who were very fond of their subwoofer. Please regulate against these. We need larger computer labs in the dorms. We need more study areas and a place where students can go so they will not be distracted. We need more study areas available! When I lived in Shreve freshman year, my floor was always very loud, my RA did not do anything to keep people quiet and so it was very difficult to study in my room. When I lived in the dorms, I was in Purdue village. I&apos;m not going to walk all the way down to Purdue West to use our facilities. When there&apos;s event going on in Purdue Village, there&apos;s no quiet study area!!!! While I have used the study areas, I don&apos;t like to becuase I find I can&apos;t study as well. Windsor is the worst. It goes a little overboard on quiet hours and rules and makes me feel monitored all the time. I don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s been a good experience. Windsor needs study areas that are actually quiet, because the areas downstairs constantly had people carrying on long, loud conversations. Wish there were more computers aviable in residence halls Would like more computers available at Wiley Hall. Would like to see a coulpler smaller ones for group work and computer labs back in each of the halls. You took the computer labs out of the dorms.... not a good idea when trying to promote studying and homework. 

 

 (HFS5) University Residences–Inclusive Community Supporting Social Interaction 

 Advertising for RA programs in Tarkington could improve. &quot;Have you interacted socially with other members of your community?&quot; is an incredibly poorly worded question. Everyone has interacted socially at some point in their life, its nearly impossible not to. 3SE!!! A lot of people don&apos;t want to, and there were many cliches formed on my floor. Almost everyone in Windsor keeps their door shut and they are visibly uninterested in socializing while they are in their rooms. I do socialize with my sorority sisters who live on the same floor and people I know from previous years, but other than that nobody is interested. As a resident in University Residences, my RA was really important in fostering a sense of community. Best friends I&apos;ve ever had I met freshman year. Carry is excellent at community feeling on the floor, Hillenbrand is polar opposite Cary Quad did a poor job of this in Fall 2006/ Spring 2007. Cary Quad is not a good place if you are looking for interaction with anyone cary *** tark is cool Clubs make the hall. Could do more to get to know people in the dorms Created long term bonds. Dont have doors close by themselves. Make it more like a hotel where no-one wants to meet anyone rather than a dorm where it is imperative you meet others. Due to Band, my only social time it put into maintaining those relationships. Due to the difficulty of my studies, I don&apos;t have a social life. Earhart was a little bit less social than most dorms I would say. events put on by RAs First dorm was decent, second dorm had an open door policy and was great, third dorm had closed door policy which effectively stopped social interaction. First Street Towers is fantastic for socializing while still allowing a resident the luxury of privacy. Floor activities and dinners are fun and promote bonding with others on your floor and with your RA Floor activities are almost always lame because RA are forced to put them on and don&apos;t wish to put forth a lot of effort. Floor activities never helped increase interaction between people on the floor in my experiences. It only happened if you took the time to seek out other people that perhaps you met at a floor function. freshman that got put on an upperclassman floor. no interaction whatsoever among neighbors Good for out of state students Great friends in dorms. Great place to make your friends at Had a roommate that smelled horrid and played World of Warcraft all the time. Purdue should ban this. It was horrible. Had to goto other residence halls to socialize. Hillenbrand does not allow social interaction easily. I would like this improved. Hillenbrand hall is not conducive to community. Every door is closed 100% of the time. Hillenbrand&apos;s closed door policy makes it very difficult for students to meet each other in that hall. Hillenbrand&apos;s closed doors make it hard to meet people. Hilltop Apartments does a great job trying to get the community to be a community. How would I, as a single white graduate student, even find my community members?! Humans vs. Zombies woo! I am hearing impaired and there is no communication with other deaf students on campus. I don&apos;t even know who they are. I am in the Cavalier Club in Harrison Hall I am not at all involved in my building, but in the campus as a whole. I believe the University Residences provide great opportunities to socialize with others on your individual floor and in your building. I did as a freshman. Not as much interest now as a sophomore. I did last year when I lived in earhart, but hillenbrand is not conducive to meeting people, because the doors do not stay open I did not interact with people living in the University Residences. I did when I was a freshman I didn&apos;t have a specific inclusive community, but I would hang out with other people in my hallway. I didn&apos;t partcipate in social activites with my dorm. I was an athlete freshman year and we very busy. I dislike how it is difficult to have interaction between guys and girls within the residence hall. I don&apos;t have time to interact much as I have so many activities going on in both semesters relating to classes or the greek system I don&apos;t like the extreme male only and female only and lack of interaction between the two. Would be nice to loosen up the rules only co-ed dorms. Such as males should be allowed on female floors or wings without an escort or supervision. Also bathroom should be co-ed or at least more co-ed bathrooms on floors rather than keeping everyone so divided. I don&apos;t really participate, but there&apos;s plenty of events going on. I don&apos;t usually have time for this. I enjoy the fac-fellow program. I feel less connected socially in the dorms this semester, which I believe is mostly due to being out on Co-Op during the Fall semester. i feel rather isolated. I feel this is more of an issue with my RA, but hall community is not established on my floor. There are not very many hall activities and rarely see my RA outside of her room. She mostly has the door shut as well. I felt Shreve was this way. Living in Windsor felt very secluded and cold. I find it extremely easy to go to other rooms and talk to friends and/or to leave my door open and have friends over. I gained many long lasting friendships with members from my housing community. I hate forced social interaction when I have things to do. Like studying. I hate my room mate. I Hated my time in university residences. There was so much diversity shoved down my throat in my time at the dorms that i have come to be more predjudiced about minorites than i ever was before i came to purdue. I have friends, no real need to know people I will likely only see again when wandering around campus I have had a few interactions with the other members of my residence hall, but I&apos;m usually so busy I just come to the hall to do my homework and sleep. I have made great friends with most of the guys on my floor. I have made many friends in the residence halls. I have no idea what this is talking about. I have no idea what this question is asking. I interacted because I was in a learning community, and I saw everyone in class every day. Otherwise, I wouldn&apos;t have interacted with people on my floor a whole lot. I interacted with people from my hall, but in no way was it because of anything but proximity. I like all the opportunities that we have to choose from. I like that Purdue has the option to live in a busy area where you get to meet other people, or a residence where you can keep tp yourself. I liked how our R.A. interacted with all of us and created opportunities for us to interact with each other. Such as floor dinners, intramurals, and other activities. By interacting and participating in these events I have built a friendship with many people and still interact with them daily. I live at hilltop and though dont do a lot I live here because it seemed like a good idea after last year. I don&apos;t particularly care to socialize with a lot of freshmen. I live in a learning community. I lived at Harrison my first year, then moved to Windsor for my second year where I noticed a big change in the way the amount of activities for the residences. There are more events at Windsor, eg. Chocolate Night and Spa Night I lived with a great group of people my freshman year. I love the events my hall offers. It provides a great opportunity to bond with my floor. I love the girls on my floor and have made some of the best friends. I love living in such a welcoming environment. I have also had an awesome RA who helped me out so much this year with a variety of situations. I met a few people I am still friends with in my community (on my floor). However, a majority were not people I cared to interact with. i met lots of great girls on my floor! I met other students living in the same hall during BGR and many of them I still get together with. I still meet up with people from my freshman year floor and play soccer. I still talk with several of my residence hall friends I think RAs should organize more activities as a floor community rather than trying to host activities/events for open to the entire residence hall. People don&apos;t want to go to those by themselves to meet someone new because they feel lame. I think the RAs and the clubs do a great job in this regards. If isn&apos;t from lack of trying on their part to get students to socialize. If they don&apos;t, it&apos;s the individual students fault, not anyone else&apos;s because they are given plenty of opportunities. I tried to a few times when I stayed in the dorms but the girls were not very friendly. I was a member of Shreve Club I was actually the social director at Wiley. I liked that everyone in the hall could participate in the social events. There is an excellent variety of events, and they provide an alternative to drinking. I was in a res. hall with all CS majors and didn&apos;t have much opportunity to interact with others outside of classes. I was not in a learning community, but I was always social with my dormmates, and we still hand out form time to time. I was rarely in my Earhart room because of the noise in the hallway I wish my RA would host more floor events. It&apos;s hard to get to know people on your floor if you come in during the middle of the year. I would consider the lack of involvement of my RA as the biggest problem with my first year. I don&apos;t really feel a part fo my floor and see my room as somewhere to sleep and study but otherwise avoid. I would have liked my RA to be better at making a positive environment on my floor. In order to make a more inclusive communtiy, Purdue needs to hire better RAs. I would like to see more movie nights because they seem to be the best at drawing the floors together. I&apos;m a very private person but there&apos;s always something going on for me to do if I feel like it. I&apos;m an RA - it&apos;s my job I&apos;m an RA so alot of my time is devoted to developing a sense of community on my floor. Some halls and some floors have a harder time with this but I believe the residents in the long run do get what they want. If they want more programs, we do it. If they tell us they are too busy for programs then we do less programs and the ones that we do facilitate, we try hard to get as many people there as possible. I&apos;m an RA, this is my job... I&apos;m an RA. Before I was one, I was satisfied but there seemed to be a lot of potential, and therefore I wanted to be an active part of it. I&apos;m not sure what this question is aaking I&apos;ve found more social interaction with various clubs and campus activities. I&apos;ve met the people on my floor at my floor&apos;s events, but I really know nothing of anyone else in the dorm. Our hall&apos;s events were basically only a couple dances and such, kind of a letdown. In cary the doors automatically shut so I don&apos;t really know anybody on the floor. In Hillenbrand we didn&apos;t have very many floor events, or opportunities to meet other people on the floor. In the dorms social interaction is encouraged but for the most part it is segregated by gender especially including floor events since co Ed dorms are not offered most interactions were with the same sex It doesn&apos;t seem like there are many ways to really get involved within your community. I&apos;d like more options to become involved or more notice of things that would get people involved. It is especially important freshman year. It is hard to schedule activities within the dorms that everyone can attend. School work has to come first and that isn&apos;t always recognized. It is more difficult to interact with people in Hillenbrand than in other dorms. I think it is because the doors must stay closed. It doesn&apos;t feel like a community. It is not the Universities job to make people be friends. It is a very bad idea to preach that extroverted is better than introverted. It might be nice if Purdue was able to place similar people on the same floor of resident halls It really depends on your RA I guess. I have a really nice and sweet RA, but I don&apos;t know any girl in my hallway besides my roommate, and I&apos;ve lived here since August. Something&apos;s missing with encouraging social interaction. It was a little difficult when put on the same level as older students who already had a group of friends this happened my freshman year and it was a little upsetting. We kept our door open and no one really talked to us. A lot of my friends had great success though. it was easy in wiley It was harder to make friends at Hilltop, mostly because there are fewer people to run into on a daily basis. It was not a great experience. I was in a learning community which was designed to facilitate communication and cooperation. However, it turned into a hostile environment because of the competitive nature of my major. People in the community would feed people wrong information, and even teach you how to do something wrong so that you would do worse than them on exams and homework assignments. This caused me to change my major, because I did not want to deal with people like that for my entire college career. It was very easy to meet people while living on campus. It&apos;s difficult meeting differnt types of people in a all women&apos;s dorm. kind of cliquy Lame events at inconvenient times. last year in harrison i thought it was great, but this year in hillenbrand social interaction is nonexistent LEARNING COMMUNITIES ARE AWESOME. THE LYCEUM WAS AMAZING--I WISH I COULD LIVE THAT ALL OVER AGAIN. Learning communities are good Learning Communities are really good Less so though since it&apos;s an upperclassman dorm Limited options. Not for everyone. Lots of social events planned by the RA&apos;s Made great friends when I lived there MANY NOT FRIENDLY, DUE TO POOR CHOICE OF RAs Many of the newer residence buildings have doors that close if not propped, making for a much more closed environment. I stayed in Wiley, and the only reason everyone knew each other was the lack of air conditioning made us all have our doors open. Many, if not most, people in Purdue Village speak Chinese most of the time--interaction with these people is all but impossible. Meredith hall should improve the quality and quantity of events for socialising Meredith was a very social atmosphere and at Hillenbrand my floor participated in intramurals but other than that it was not social at all. People didn&apos;t even know the people they shared a bathroom with all year and no one studied together and I don&apos;t know why it was like that but I didn&apos;t like it. Met may friends this way more broad based efforts should be made instead of things like floor dinners. larger scale activities like the corn maze, other activities off campus, or block parties like at BGR where lots of people can meet and interact would be more fun for me more floor activities needed More programs are needed, I barely know anyone on my floor. Most of the social interactions are not geared to graduate students or non-traditional students even though trend shows that demgraphic growing in numbers My best friends here at Purdue have all come from the residence hall system. My first semester community interaction was non exsistant. My floor does not do many things together and I do not know the guys on my floor well or even at all... I wish there were floor dinners, etc. My freshman RA, Andrew Balfour, was a horrendous RA. I complained about his lack of fulfilling his duties to the RA director of Harrison and nothing was done to my knowledge. I actually think he is an RA again this year, bad decision on the dorms behalf, very bad. My hall is worthless My hallway was not very open and not very friendly. Most doors were shut and we were not that social. My RA does nothing and i know no one im my dorm my ra doesn&apos;t know me My RA is doing a good job of providing us with social opportunities My RA is very against any sort of noise. I feel as if this hurts the community on our floor as we are less likely to interact in fear of getting into trouble. My RA Michael Zachman and his girlfriend Christine Wilkerson,which is also the RA of our sister floor, do a very good job of organizing small and/or large get togethers for our floors and they are fun to be around My RA never set up intermurals, so I joined another floor&apos;s team. My RA, Sunaina Kuhn does an excellent job of community building. She has been an integral part of my enjoyment of the residence halls this year My RAs have given me program opportunities and although I did not participate in every event, I knew who lived on the floor with me. My residence hall has several programs at which I can meet and interact with others in my building. N/A N/A n/a N/A N/A n/a N/A N/A need to have more concerts. Never had a problem with this task never used new residences use firedoors, you can&apos;t leave your door open making it 500% more difficult to meet people on your floor No real bonding experience with floor mates and the like! none none None none none none none None Not a very social floor where I am located. NOt at PVIL, but definitely at Hillenbrand. Not everybody&apos;s a close-knit floor. Not many opportunities that I heard of. On my own time once again, sw/se cary quadrangle was great for socialization only my roommate... Only on my floor, not other dorms Our RAs encourage us to be quiet and shut our doors. This discourages some people from socializing. My hall is very unsocial people from all around the world. People have other ways to find their own friends so it&apos;s not super important. The page is well laid out and explained. People on my floor are very friendly and we talk once in a while. Please note that I lived in graduate (NOT undergraduate) housing on campus, so it is a different environment. Purdue residence halls aren&apos;t even close to the real world. It&apos;s the most non-diverse atmosphere possible, because everyone is the same age and the same economic status. Purdue village was not ideal for a freshman to meet people but there were still plenty of opportunities for me through my RA and BGR. RA is a giant nerd and tells us to be quiet 24/7. He should be fired, seriously. There should be survey&apos;s on RA&apos;s because my RA is, for lack of a better word, an ***. RA was a joke. Rarely RAs always had good programs to attend and get to meet people in your living community. RAs are basically a waste of money and hiring. They do not provide a nice environment to live in, barely knew I existed, and have not benefited me in anyway. RAs should be more outgoing and nice. RAs should not gossip about residents. RHA hosts several events to participate in. Roommate and I didn&apos;t get along, spent most of my time with friends out side of the dorm. same comment as above Several girls on my floor did things together on a regular basis. My experience would not have been the same without that. Since the question asked if I &apos;ever&apos; applied for housing, I answered yes. This was the first time I attended Purdue in 1987. So great to meet so many people in the dorms. Social interaction was not an issue, though it was not the type of interaction that lead to academic greatness. It lead to binge drinking and girls being taken advantage of by older men in fraternities. some of my good friends are from freshman year in the dorms. Some of the programs are fun, however I really don&apos;t participate in a lot of them due to lack of time and people to go with me. Some residence halls have a lot more activities for residents than others. sometimes i wish there was a little less pressure to interact socially. sometimes i just would like to be left alone rather than constantly being harassed to attend various events. Still there are areas of opportunity. My perception is much of the integration and social interaction is left to churches or to external groups rather than the university Students are not pushed to study, they are pushed towards social interactions. The atmosphere is not inclusive enough. Changes need to be made to various policies. Purdue should consider gender-neutral housing and housing options (meaning all!) better fit for transgender individuals. The fact that we&apos;re not even allowed to prop our doors open at Hillenbrand is pretty much the opposite of supporting social interaction. The floor are very lively at Hawkins. The RA is doing a great job building a floor community. The girls on my floor were the party-type and I&apos;m the quiet, studious type. My friends did not live on my floor. The Honors Engineering Learning Community was probably the best thing that happened to me at college. I met a lot of really amazing people who I am still great friends with 4 years later. Can&apos;t recommend the HELC enough The learning communities are awesome! the learning community hindered my ability to socially interact with others The only reason I interacted with people in my res hall was because the girl kitty corner to me was in my major and we had all of our classes together. My RA wasn&apos;t bery good, so I didn&apos;t meet most of my hall. The RA on my floor does nothing at all, I have no idea why they hired him. The RA programs in Windsor are spectacular!! The RAs do a fantastic job of creating programs and building community. The residency tries to have many social activities and I think they are all good, but I along with many other people in the dorms are very frustrated with the quiet hours policy and the strictness at which the Residential Staff enforces them. I understand that if your music is blaring at 2:00 a.m., but to get wrote up and warned numerous times for playing music at 8:00 p.m. is ridiculous. I&apos;m all for students studying and learning, but not one person on my floor has ever come and asked me to turn down the music. I think if its not bothering them then the RA staff should respect that and let it slide until there is a complaint about it. The resident assistants are amazing The rules in the residence halls about guests are extremely strict and limiting The Tarkington Staff and RA staff are extremely active in coordinating and putting on events to bring students together. I am very satisfied with the opportunities provided to interact with students, faculty fellows, and staff. There are a lot of activities to get involved with at my hall There are many social activities held by PV which is a very good thing. There could be more activities. there isn&apos;t much interaction in the First Street Towers There were plenty of events within the floor, the dorm, and between dorms. My RA did an excellent job of keeping us aware of the events and inviting us to go. These &quot;prompts&quot; (not even questions) couldn&apos;t possibly be any vaguer. they aren&apos;t much They should encourage people to keep their doors open at Hillenbrand Hall They&apos;re fun, but I wish more people would participate. To me this was more important as a freshman than when I got older. Undergrad Purdue Village... hard to socialize University Residences does a great job! Varies by floor. Some floors tend to be cliquey while others are not. Various events were scheduled when I lived in Harrison. It was great. very little action done with roommates that drink and pee on floors.. waste of time, might as well just go to a kegger We cannot have the doors opened in my hallway because it is a fire hazard. I feel this limits communication between neighbors and doesn&apos;t facilitate interaction We do floor activities. what kind of a question is that? I&apos;m not a dorm room-based hermit, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re wondering. When I lived in Hillenbrand I felt that the social atmosphere was not emphasized well at all. I never meet my sweet mates or or very many people that lived on my floor as our doors had to stay shut and the only activities that we had were hall meetings. when i lived in hilltop i chose not to interact with the people who lived in my community. there were plenty of oppertunities to interact with them though. When I lived in the dorms, my RA was amazing at getting all of us girls to do things together. It was always a blast! When I was in Earhart, people left their doors open and it was easy to interact with people; I made quite a few friends. When I moved to Hillenbrand, the doors automatically shut, and I never interacted with any of the people on my floor. Not even my suitemates. The automatically shutting doors may be useful for isolating fires, but at what cost? When planning events make sure that you have people setting up before it starts Where I lived, they didn&apos;t do a great job getting us to interact with each other. The quiet hours were too intense. Windsor was very good about getting the girls to participate in activities yes, but sometimes I just busy and do not have a lot of time to join this kind of accitivities Yes, I have met people in my halls but the overall social interaction is horrible. You can&apos;t force people to be active and it&apos;s great to have available programs but I feel like it ends up being a waste of the RA&apos;s time and energy to plan them and you can never predict how busy students will be. Monthly prgrams are great, weekly ones are worthless You may have all the social opportunities you want, but that doesn&apos;t mean people enjoy going. You really need to ask questions or make them clearly stated. 

 

 (HFS6) University Residences–Resident Assistants’Guidance and Support 

 ,y RA is the best!! Go Mallory! 2 of the 3 RA&apos;s I&apos;ve had have been wonderful, and I didn&apos;t have any particular problems with the other one, other than I just didn&apos;t really get along with her that well personally All of the RAs I have met are very friendly and willing to help. Andy Woodring is a Sweet RA! andy woodring is the man. Anna Bremer from Shreve is the BEST RA! Anna Grace Brutsman is an excellent RA! As i said earlier my RA, ***, was a terrible RA. At Hilltop apartments...even when community is very different from teh dorms, my RA and RLM were very helpful when we had a problem. Bad roommate situation. The resident hall couldn&apos;t do anything and told me to just work it out. My parents ended up coming down here, renting a hotel room, and I lived out of there for a week with my parents until the residence hall could get me into a better environment for my academic studies and personal safety where drunken men weren&apos;t brought back to the room every day. both of my RAs were always available and friendly and helpful. Could obtain prompt response. Appreciate that. David Wefler was a great Earhart RA. Didn&apos;t help with roommate problem. Drew McTighe is the greatest RA in the world and its because of him I&apos;m proud to be a member of Owen SE4. Emily is awesome! :) First semester my RA was nice, but didn&apos;t inforce inclusion. Floor dinners get to be slightly annoying. RAs should understand that some students do not want to go to dinner with their floor every week. Freshman year at Shreve - it was obvious my floor&apos;s RA was only an RA for the free room&amp;board, she&apos;s no longer here, but she clearly wasn&apos;t in it to help us students. Sophomore year at Hillenbrand - my RA was great, she truly cared about us and visited us frequently, leaving her door open and leaving treats in the hallway. Freshman year, my RA was awesome and very friendly. She always stopped by to say hi and had floor bonding activities. This year, my RA doesn&apos;t even know I live on her floor. Friendly and concerned with our well-being. Good RA. Great job at training them to do what they are able to do. Great person to go to for help. Had two terrible international RA&apos;s that were too shy to speak to any of the students on the floor. They did not organize any programs and completely avoided the social aspect of the job. I don&apos;t know how they were selected. Hated my RA Have I used what? My RA? or is this asking about drugs? / / My RA was very helpful and I continue to stay in touch with him? Have I used? what? What are you asking me if I have used or not? Have someone read your questions &quot;Have you used?&quot; Used what exactly? Haven&apos;t had any major issues, but the RA&apos;s are very receptive and quick to lend assistance. He is never here, how am I supposed to use it? His job is to enforce the rules not be our friend hit and miss I adored my RA my Freshman year in Wiley Hall- her name was Julie Musial. She was wonderful and really helped me through my problems with my roommmate. I am a Resident Assistant I AM a resident assistant, and I know personally how important this can be to residents. I am an RA I am one. I did feel that my RA freshman year overcommitted herself, and didn&apos;t have enough time to spend with residents. She was very nice and helpful, I just think it&apos;s important that RAs are able to commit adequate time to their position. I did not use this service because I have seen my RA a total of 3 times since the beginning of my stay in the dorms. I didnt see my RA much when i lived in the dorms. I don&apos;t have a problem with RAs... but my friend was accused on no grounds on sexual harrassment and the RA didn&apos;t even bother to hear both sides of the story I don&apos;t really go to my RA for help. I don&apos;t see any difference having or not having a RA assigned to my building I had 2 residence assistance because one left after the first semester. Both RAs allowed some reckless behavior to occur, but I understand they are RAs and not parents. I had a great RA, and my year in the residence halls would have been much more difficult without her and her open door policies. I had a terrible ra. Irresponsible. I had a TERRIBLE resident assistant while living in Wiley. *** was my RA freshman year (last year) and she couldn&apos;t even help us some of the time because she came home too drunk to deal with anything. I had a WONDERFUL RA in Shreve Hall. I had roommate conflicts and it was not very helpful. I had three different RA&apos;s during the two years I was in the same dorm/room. They were nice, but were often very unhelpful. I had two great RAs at Owen, but one who was terrible. I have a good RA who looks out for me I have a hard time finding the RA. We are not on the same schedule... I have always had great experiences with my RAs being friendly, yet stern, and very helpful. i have an awesome RA I have barely seen my RA since the first day of classes. With that said, it really wasn&apos;t that important to me this year. In contrast, my RA last year was exceptional. I have developed a great friendship with my RA. She has helped me out so much this year and had made my floor a safe environment. She is a great friend, but also makes the girls on the floor mind and be friendly. I have had a very bad experience with my RA, and wanted to file a complaint but was unaware of how or where to do so. I have had one good RA. The other was definitely not good at interacting with others. I have had several different RAs in my years at Purdue. Some were very friendly and helpful, but mostly I did not really click with any of them. I felt like they were a little bit fake and not really genuine. I have not been able to use my RA&apos;s guidance and support because she is not in the hall very often. There have been several issues where there were un-escorted guests or males in the female bathroom that I have not been able to find her. Her lack of being here does not make me feel safe. Also, she does not enforce quiet hours-which makes it difficult to study and sometimes sleep. I have not had a serious encounter with my RA I have not needed to go to my RA for any guidance but I know she is there whenever I need her. I have not used it but I know that my RA is always available to talk. I have seen my RA at PVIL once. I donotknow how to get in contact with her, so how can I ask her advice? I do not even know where she lives. I haven&apos;t used my RA as a person of support, but all of mine were extremely open and capable of such support. One of my RAs nominated me for Student of the Month, and I ended up winning. I honestly don&apos;t know how I would contact an RA and don&apos;t know where I would find out how to contact one. I like to be left alone. I love Emily Ivers! I love my RA, she&apos;s so nice and helpful with even the smallest matters. I mainly talked with my RA about majors and concentrations I never really got that close to my RA, but I know people that have. I once asked my RA what I should do since I finished studying, he told me to go see a play. I did, it was wonderful. I only see my RA once in a while. We do not talk that much. I only see them once (maybe twice) during the semester for house safety inspection I really enjoy my RAs and thier support. I was lucky to have relaxed RAs. On floors with Stalinist RAs, community life is severely disturbed by a &quot;big brother&quot; feel (even just for hanging out, laughing, etc.). I was not impressed with my RA&apos;s support or involvement in activities on our floor. I was pretty independent as a freshman. I wish our RA came and checked up on us more to see how we&apos;re doing. I&apos;d stop by my RA&apos;s room and talk to her all of the time. She was a great RA. Very informative, positive, wise, and fun. I&apos;m not sure how some RAs got the job, they don&apos;t seem to care about their residents I&apos;m pretty sure my RA doesn&apos;t even know my name... I haven&apos;t seen him since BGR... I&apos;ve had good and bad RAs...just depends I&apos;ve had two great RAs and one useless one. i&apos;ve had very good RAs during 2 years in Earhart I&apos;ve lived in the residence halls for four years, and I&apos;ve had two excellent RAs and two terrible RAs, so this seems like an individualized thing, My current RA is excellent with this. I&apos;ve never really had occassion to ask avice of an RA, but I always knew they were there for me if I needed to. I&apos;ve talked to my RA about some of the classes that I&apos;m in that she has taken. Ian Trout of Owen Hall is the greatest....and I had him in 2007-2008 In my 2 years, the only thing I&apos;ve spoken to an RA about is opening my room door if I got locked out. In my experience, the RAs are not in their rooms at very convenient times, making it difficult to seek them out. It is annoying because sometimes our TA shows favoritism to students living on our floor. I once got written up for being loud (when my door was shut and for having the TV too loud) but my next door neighbor was screaming up and down the hall and she was not written up. It seems that there is a lot of RAs working? ... I do not think we need all these RAs, it just seem to many people to me. JAMES MATHIS IS THE BEST RA EVER! *** is always mad. He is very unpredictable sometimes he yells down the hall alot then yells at others to be quiet. Jennifer Clark in Meredith Hall 2007-2008, best RA ever. jeremy prather is awesome Joe Gerace is the Suga Honey Iced Tea Jonathan Chen was an excellent RA at Cary Quad. Just okay. More there for upholding the rules than guidance. Karl was usually available to talk to and was always very helpful and supportive. He also dealt with floor problems in a fair and professional manner. Last year I had two RA&apos;s talking about me behind my back, and I felt very uncomfortable. The situation was not handled well when I went to the Manager. last year was great, this year not so much... Long time ago love my RA Lucked out with a really great RA my freshman year. Helped me get through a lot of problems, could use that peer support more today. Many RA&apos;s seem to take their job too seriously and in enforcing rules they have compromised their appeal or openness to residents Matters alot on the RA. Maybe on an occasional topic. Mike Dodaro has been a fantastic RA! More used with females it seems. Most of the RA&apos;s I interacted with were never really into their job. Most admitted to me that they only were RA&apos;s to pay for school. I lived in the Res Hall&apos;s for three years and was very active my res hall club, so I got to know the RA&apos;s pretty well. They were very hypocritical - being loud during quiet hours by talking in their room with the door open or yelling down the hall while doing rounds, but getting mad at residents for talking or having a door open etc. It was not a good environment to live in, especially as a freshman, because the RA&apos;s were not into their job, they didn&apos;t care, and they just appeared as hypocrites. Most of the RA&apos;s I&apos;ve had have been very friendly and helpful when I needed them. Much better guidance last year than this year. My first RA (***) didn&apos;t care. My second RA (***) doesn&apos;t quite know what she&apos;s doing. As of this weekend, I am now a resident of the second floor with Jordyn Ward. She seems to be good but I have not been on this floor long enough to know yet. My first RA and I were friendly- we didn&apos;t interact too much. My second RA and I did not click she accused me of sliding notes under her door complaining about noise. It was awkward. My first semester here I had a horrible roommate who violated rules constantly. Our room was next to our RA&apos;s and my other roommate and I talked to her repeatedly. The girl was never reprimanded. It resulted in me moving out. My former RA&apos;s have been completely ineffective at solving disputes and they don&apos;t seem to care. My freshman RA was horrible, but it was his first year. My freshman RA was pretty much perfect; strict but fair, planned fun and educational activities, acted as &quot;one of the guys&quot;. My sophomore RA spent all his time in his room getting high and *** around with his girlfriend. When we reported him we got no response. When there was a fire the alarm in our area didn&apos;t go off; all four rooms at the end of the hall slept through the whole thing. Where was the RA? Found out he was the first person out of the building from our floor. I see Purdue likes to cover the whole spectrum. My freshman year I had the most amazing RA, but I am highly unsatisfied with my RA this year. She is irresponsible and unsocial. I don&apos;t believe I have even met her and the year&apos;s almost over. Even when on duty, she always has her door closed and is complaining to her friends about her &quot;guy-problems.&quot; At the beginning of the year, she was writing everyone up for the most obnoxious reasons. My particular RA at the time was not very helpful My past RA was fun and always availiable. RA&apos;s are required to spend 3-4 nights a week in their dorm room with the door open. They are available! My R.A. freshman year was never there... My R.A. freshman year was very helpful since I was following a somewhat similar academic path as him. My R.A. was always there to help me with any problems I had adjusting to college life or to answer any questions I had. My RA demands many more things of us than he asks. We have to try to make him look good, whereas he has planned few events, and they were all poorly executed, not to mention that he makes himself virtually unreachable if we need something. He does not give out his phone number and is often not in his room. My RA didn&apos;t even live on the same floor, so I never saw her. She&apos;s very nice and I really liked her, but the RA living arrangements this year weren&apos;t conducive to their interaction with students. My RA didn&apos;t really help resolve any issues i had with my roommates. my boyfriend ended up calling hte police on them when they were drinking, and then i had to switch apartments. after that, things got better and i liked all of my other RAs My RA didn&apos;t seem very interested in her students; she was nice enough, but didn&apos;t really seem into her job. my ra doesn&apos;t know my name My RA ended up somehow &quot;accidentily&quot; removing me from the emailing list. I did not appreciate her at all, and did not feel that she was an effective RA. my RA freshman year was great - upheld the rules and was very understanding My RA has been wonderful. My RA helped my friend from another floor to the hospital when she had a bloody nose. My RA in particular was ineffective against unpleasant residents. My RA is almost NEVER here. My RA is an antisocial nerd who needs to be fired. My RA is awesome My RA is awesome My RA is awesome! :D My RA is awesome. Aaron 9th floor Hawkins My RA is bothering us with so many events. Tell us about them and leave it up to us if we want to attend. We are all adults. my RA is excellent!!!!! My RA is great and very helpful My RA is great to talk to. My RA is hardly ever around. We only ever see him after mid night with his girlfriend and/or when he is checking our smoke detectors. My RA is never around. My RA is nice and tries to facilitate friendships and social interaction among the people on our floor. My RA is not a neutral third party, and she acts annoyed when you go to her for any advice or questions. Also it is almost impossible to find her when you have a question or concern. My RA is not very active in my hall. I hardly ever see her. My RA is not very visible on the hall and just is not that likable of a guy My RA is really easy to talk to and help me feel better about coming to college and getting away from my family. My RA is super nice and really caring. My RA is the best! My RA is the reason I left the dorms. He was arrogant and incompetent. No one on our floor could stand him My RA is useless. my RA is useless. Never comes out of his room. Isn&apos;t very approachable. My roommate didn&apos;t even know his name till end of last semester My RA is very good and helpful. My RA is very helpful and is very easy to talk to! It makes living in a dorm better. My RA rocks!! My RA switched during winter break. My first RA did not try to encourage people to do anything and she was never around. My new RA does attempt to get people involved. My RA this year, James Gilmore, has been a wonderful RA. He has done an excellent job getting the building residents involved. I hope to be an RA similar to him in the future. My RA took sides when I fought with my roommate and I lost. It wasn&apos;t a fair environment and my roommate had full control over my TV, Stereo, and everything. That left me with no way to enjoy the residence hall and I left as soon as I could. My RA was amazing and I got very lucky to have such a nice RA. My RA was awesome, but I knew too many that were extremely strict and too rigid. My RA was awesome! My RA was cold and not very approachable My RA was completely unhelpful and rude. My RA was extremely competent at his job. He was also a great person outside of his job. My RA was fantastic. My ra was friends with my roommate. It wasn&apos;t until my roommate physically hurt me and I went to the hospital that anyone noticed My RA was great! My RA was hardly ever in his room and was hardly ever even on the floor. My RA was hardly ever there and she was not very social with all of the floor. She hardly organized floor activities. My RA was just ok. My RA was never really available for questions. My RA was nice, the one down the hall was the power-tripper who kept writing us up for nothing. My RA was not helpful to me at all when I lived in the dorms, but there were RAs on other floors that were helpful to me. My RA was not very loving or supportive. My RA was really helpful in getting me to interact with other people on the floor and was a great resource to me. I attended a lot of programs in my hall and got to do a host of things. My RA was really shy and didn&apos;t hang out with us or do anything really. My RA was satisfactory. My RA was supportive to a few people, not all. I was not comfortable to go to her with problems. My RA was very helpful and supportive. My RA was very helpful when I was a freshman. I know many current RAs that are wonderful. My RA was very nice and approachable even though I never needed to use her assistance I would have felt comfortable in approaching her. My RA was very nice and helpful. Some aren&apos;t as nice though. My RA, Lauren Baker, has been exceedingly helpful this year. My RA&apos;s have been very social and helpful. My Ra&apos;s in the past were good guys, just not the best RAs. My RAs are rude and unhelpful. My RAs were not that easy to talk to. My Residence Assistant my freshman year is still a good friend of mine. We played on the same intramural basketball team and had a lot of fun. He is a good guy. My resident assistant was not very pleasant. If our music was on for one minute longer than quiet hours than she would be knocking on our door. I understand that rules have to be followed, and that&apos;s fine. I just also believe a little flexibility is just as important, especially because we are all in college now. My specific floor has had alot of issues with residences and my RA has really struggled to handle all the issues without internalizing anger towards some of them. This has effected the job between student staff and RAs N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A n/a Never really talked to my RA. Never see nor hear from my RA. Nikki Harris is wonderful none none none none none None none none Not very helpful about enforcing quiet hours. One RA I had was great, the 2nd one was awful. One resident assistant was not very helpful. All the others are great. One year, I didn&apos;t meet my RA until over a month or two into the semester Only men survive Our Res Assistant was a chump. quite annoying at times RA did not seem to truely care about a problem I presented to her RA hasn&apos;t done anything about the noise past quiet hours. I went to him many times about the problem. RA helped me change rooms. RA informed us of availability. Never had a reason to speak to him. He held 2-3 functions throughout the year. RA is not usually there when needed and doesn&apos;t do much for floor activities so I don&apos;t know anyone on my floor. RA is very helpful on the floor RA was helpful sometimes. RA&apos;s are many times ignoring major problems while focusing on lesser ones on the floor. I had a bad experience with 2 RA&apos;s listening at my door, which though it is their job to protect everyone on the floor, is an invasion of my privacy and illegitimizes any trust I had with my RA to protect me instead of bust me. RA&apos;s are sometimes helpful, other times not at all. It mainly depends on the RA, much easier just to have people in the office to help out RA&apos;s dont take some complaints too seriously. especially noise complaints. RA&apos;s have a lot of duties that can be too pushy at some points. RA&apos;s have mainly just been there for me if a problem would arise...I hardly ever see my RA in the halways or anything. Rarely there, does not fix problems on floor well. RAs are really nice to have around RAs have been terrible this year. The Residence Hall Directors seem to be pretty SHADY! RAs have been very good-caliber. RAs need to casually ask how things are going, not just expect us to seek help. RAs should not gossip about residents. RAs were terrific both years that I lived in University Housing...definitely offer guidance/support. Read earlier comments and correct you question. What is: &quot;Have you used?&quot;. Like I said before, a lot of unprofessional people in this place. Resident assistants seem to be there only when absolutely necessary and only when convenient for them. I feel as though many of the RAs simply abuse their power at Hillenbrand. I did not have this issue at Shreve. see above comments seems like they are only there for the free place to live. she holds events but no one ever goes to them so i don&apos;t know what the point of them is she was always not in when i went to visit her She was helpful at the beginning but towards the end of the second semester she stopped being as helpful to all of us on the floor. She was not very helpful Some of the RAs don&apos;t get involved with their floor/hall as much as they should. Some of them were racists and they don&apos;t even know our names. Never visited to talk. Very rude. Some RAs are better than others. Some RAs are better than others... Some RAs are really good, but sometimes I wonder why certain people were hired. Sometimes the RA&apos;s are not as friendly as we expect. There should be more nice RA&apos;s personality wise! Sometimes, I don&apos;t know what they do. The best RA&apos;s are the ones who don&apos;t ask questions. If I come back to the dorm drunk and underage, and my RA walks by me and says &quot;have a good night?&quot; and &quot;you gonna be ok?&quot; ...That&apos;s a good RA. Or the ones that KNOW you have alcohol in your room..because we ALL did at one time or another...but don&apos;t say anything as long as you don&apos;t cause any problems....that&apos;s a good RA. The personal involvement of an RA after freshmen year is somewhat unnecessary. The RA can just become too friendly. The RA does not live on my floor so I am dependent on the staff resident who is inadequate and does not know anything about the dorm when I have questions. The RA I had in Tarkington my first year here was the worst RA ever. I very rarely saw him, he never showed up for his scheduled times, and he most often lived with his girlfriend in an apartment off-campus. A very bad experience to start off my collegiate career. The RA I had was never around, I saw her at check-in, check-out, and a few times in between. I kind of liked it that way though, because she wasn&apos;t overbearing or anything. There was an RA in my building though that was extremely mean and was in a learning community floor, so make sure to look into the personalities of the people that you higher if they are qualified to be the learning community RA. The RA I interact with is very easy to get along with. The RA my freshmen year was really unhelpful. The RA&apos;s are rude, inconsiderate idiots The RA&apos;s are so much help. The RA&apos;s are very well-trained and very helpful. The RA&apos;s here are excellent. the RA&apos;s were very selective to the rules they enforced, being only the ones that affected them The RAs at Purdue are great, or at least the ones I have had are. They are like friends to me, and I always go to them for support. The RAs here go on a power trip and abuse their power immediately because they now have some authority. The RAs in Hawkins are great. The personnel are also excellent. I feel they care about the residents. The rules for renewing Purdue Village are very unclear. In the flyer it says the ownership can be transferred, but the RA says it can&apos;t. Things are confusing. The same girls in my hall are always loud and obnoxious during quiet hours and my RA doesn&apos;t do anything about it to my knowledge. there are helpful and available There when needed. They are very patient to answer questions. They are very useful and helpful they can&apos;t kick out people being noisy at nights, so it&apos;s not their fault some issues don&apos;t get resolved They seem to be more worried about themselves and not the residents. Just because they get paid doesn&apos;t mean they get to be rude and act like they are in high school. They were always there when ever I needed help with a resident problem. I also liked how they would arrange activities together for resident to participant in if they wanted to. they were helpful This is most important for first-year students. After that, it doesn&apos;t make a difference to me. This year&apos;s RA in comparison to the one my freshman year has disapointed me with her absolute lack of interaction with her students. Varies form RA to RA Very available to talk and help as needed. An integral part to living in the res halls. Very helpful, kept residents up to date and helped to build community feel. Very helpful. Very willing to help Was not happy with our RA freshman year. Very overbearing and not friendly. More of a discipliner than someone there for support and help. We waste more time by going to the RA with roommate problems because most of the time they are not in a position to say the right thing to the roommate. When I had a problem my RA was very helpful, but it has taken awhile. I have been going through an issue for a month and a half. I feel that this is an excessive time to have a problem resolved. When I lived in the dorms, my RA was seldomly around. When I moved halls, my RA did not even come talk to me. I had to talk to her first after a week of being there after I moved. While I have heard bad things of other RAs, my RA Jennifer Henkle on the 3rd floor in Warren Hall, Windsor is awesome. While in Young Hall, a pipe or something leaked and it leaked down and started dripping a yellow oily liquid onto the contents of my closet (all of my clothing). It only took 2 days for the leak to be stopped, and all of my ruined clothes were my problem, apparently. So that was cool, a problem caused in no way by me cost me about $3000 worth of clothes. At least one of the RAs told me that it *** for my things to have been ruined, but no one tried to get me any sort of compensation, and I don&apos;t have money to spend on a lawyer. So I have to say, I was not pleased with the support. While some of the RAs are wonderful and very involved in their students&apos; lives, I also feel that some RAs are more focused on other concerns. Wonderful people. Wonderful program. U would not have stayed in the residence halls without the ras Yes, I have talked to my RA to seek guidance and support as we got further and further into the semester when I was feeling swamped. Yes, many times the RA&apos;s are very helpful. You guys should really ask more sensible questions. &quot;Have you used?&quot; is a terrible sentence. How about &quot;Have you used your RA&apos;s guidance and support?&quot; The way you have it makes it sound like a question about drug use. You hardly know who your RA is. 

 

 (HFS7) University Residences–Programs Offered within the Residence Halls–provided by the RAs, Hall Clubs, Faculty Fellows 

 A few, but there are too many. Have less programs and then it would cost less to live there. Activities are awkward/lame. activities were pretty boring Again, I have not been that social within the dorms this semester. Always held when I&apos;m working. As a floor member and a club exec, I think the halls should have more say with their money than they do. And get rid of RHA As an RA, we give the residents what they want. If they ask for a certain program, then that is what we will give them. When no one on our floor is giving us feedback, then it makes it more challenging to give the residents what they want but we still do a good job of making things happen. Attended a few events Attended a few my freshman year, never went back. Attendence only to get free food Avoided at all costs because I was studying for classes. clash with other activities Content not relevant for grad students and their families Dance, okay. Midnight Pancake Meal o_O Heaven? On a plate? And we all get to go? H.O.T. Did not utilize these programs. Don&apos;t cut funding to these programs, especially at Hawkins. Residents pay a lot of money to live here, and deserve good programming. Don&apos;t find interesting or too busy to attend Educational, helpful and beneficial. Enjoyed the floor dinners. Haven&apos;t attended much else. Events are always planned while I have class or meetings, so I get the shaft even though I&apos;m paying just as much towards these programs as the guy next door who is only taking 12 credits. Events are really good and productive! Every activity I&apos;ve attended has been great. Excellent programs! Especially programs that are partially funded by club and RHA that allows for cheap trips. Excellent! Fac Fellows is nice. faculty fellows are not involved like Purdue makes them seem. For example, I have not even meet my faculty fellow because he is only for lunch at a time when everyone is in class and has chosen to not be involved in any other way. Being the Dean of Students should exempt you from doing your job as a mentor. faculty fellows dinners were fun, and the phoenix club was a good experience Floor events are great! Free food is always good :) Fun! Further coordination around this efforts is needed. It seems many of these programs are punctually initiated at the start of Fall semester and no follow up is made. Good events. good gathering and events good variety good way to meet people in your hall Great access to meet people across the campus. Group trips to places like rock-climbing and downhill skiing venues were fun. hard to get participation bc most of the activities are not the most fun. that said I am a big fan of the ice cream socials and color changing cups at earhart Harrison put on great events when i lived there. Hilltop does not offer some of the things other residences do such as rock climbing, pumpkin patch, and kings island. hilltop was good about offering get togethers and cookouts and such every year Hussar Club has some organizational issues with parliamentary procedure. I am also a part of Meredith&apos;s RX club as a senator I am the Facilities Chair of a Hall I attend a lot of the events at Windsor. Most of them are a lot of fun, and tend to be pretty informative. I attended a few things that were fun and helpful! I attended more of these events as a freshman than as an upper classman. I attended one event once. I did not like seeing the signs for &quot;Condom Olympics.&quot; I attended one of the programs that the hall offered that was in the actual hall. It might have been fun to go to the ones at other places I just didn&apos;t have time, I also think that the fact that my RA wasn&apos;t as welcoming that it didn&apos;t help. I attended, but very few. I do not think these are that important. It never seems like they do any thing. I don&apos;t have time to attend these events and functions I don&apos;t participate in any of these events because I despise my RA. I enjoy programs that are given by RAs. They are very important to new students as well as keeping older residents in touch with their hall. I enjoy Windsor Residence Hall activities much more than the Wiley Hall activities. I lived in Wiley my freshman year but like Windsor so much more! :) I especially liked the movie nights and blood drives. You felt like you were participating and helping others all at the same time I have attended a few programs and have been very pleased. I have gone to the faculty fellows dinners and it would be nice if people knew each other better. My faculty fellows are very nice. I have only done sports teams through the residence hall and they were great I haven&apos;t attendend many but that activities I have been to were fun I know the RA&apos;s have quotas on having so many events and getting so many people to attend - but sometimes I feel like that turns into, &quot;come on people, please attend - I have to have 10 people attend&quot;, etc. I like events prepared at Purdue Village for the tenants and our families. I like knowing that people care and are trying to further my college experience. I like my RA I like the fun activities. I just with that more them would have been done on the weekends. I liked my ra (sarah) but the activities were sort of lame (no offense sorry) although i did like the easter egg dying I liked the programs offered. I liked the social and &quot;crafty&quot; events offered in my hall. They allowed me and my friends in Windsor to connect socially which made it easier to keep doing things together outside of organized activities. i lovbed the flip flop event=) I love going to these. I love the fac-fellows -- I greatly appreciate what they do -- it would be great for more people to get to know them on an individual basis. I loved it and attended as many and as much as I could, just wish there would have been more and other various opportunities as well. I never attended because I was busy with sorority events usually, but they seemed to have a good variety and number of activities I only attended one because they are always offered on Wednesdays and I work that evening. I really enjoyed the seasonal activities that the RAs organized at Windsor during my freshman year (2007-2008) I remember there not being enough spots for trips with my residence hall, Meredith, freshman year. I think that Residence Hall programs are important for social, intellectual, and leadership development. I think that there are enough extracurricular activities on campus for people to get involved that it should be more of an RA&apos;s job to encourage students to go out for these clubs and activities rather than making up their own I think these are good outlets to let students take a break from classes and studying and just breathe. I think these programs are very important, especially during one&apos;s freshman year because that&apos;s how I met many of my current friends at Purdue. I used to eat with Fac Fellows and participate as a hall senator along with hall trips to places. I usually don&apos;t have much interest in these. I know they are important, however, a lot of times, my day is so full any way I don&apos;t want to do any more. Just go home and relax. I was a Senator for Meredith NE1 in 2006-2007 and we had approx $40,000 and they wouldn&apos;t let us spend a penny. What is the point in a Residence Hall that in need of help and reconstruction who has the money and won&apos;t let anyone spend it? I was actually the social director at Wiley. I liked that everyone in the hall could participate in the social events. There is an excellent variety of events, and they provide an alternative to drinking. I was very satisfied with the work of the RAs and the hall clubs. Faculty Fellows is a program that could definitely be developed further. I went to a couple programs, but I did not really enjoy them that much. I went to a few of the faculty fellow dinners and did some events with my floor. Although I did not get as involved because of other clubs I joined, the opportunities were there. I went to the &quot;floor dinner&quot; a couple of times, but it was too big of a group to enjoy myself. I went to the superbowl I would just like to mention my dissatisfaction with walking in to Hillenbrand today to see a shiny new neon sign just inside the lobby doors. Excluding the obvious fact that if someone has walked into the building they have probably already realized that they are in Hillenbrand and did not need this sign to remind them, I see it as an extreme waste of the money students are paying to improve the university. I feel that the money that was spent designing and custom-building this sign could have been used in many better ways to improve the residence hall by giving back to the students who fund its existence. I would love to attend but I am so swamped with class work all the time. I&apos;m just always busy I&apos;ve attended as an RA myself and also as a Staff Resident but not really as a resident. I would go if my RA personally knocked on my door and if it was a really quick thing like making a craft and eating a snack. I&apos;ve noticed that when I go into other dorms, they seem to have more ads for more activities. It would be nice if mine had the same opportunities. I&apos;ve only attended one program that was offered by my RA because I feel that my particular hall does not advertise their programs well enough because they don&apos;t describe what the program is. I&apos;ve participated in my floors events because my RA&apos;s events were fun. However, all of the hall club&apos;s activities were pretty much a letdown. I had no interest in dances, and as far as I know that may have been the only event that my hall hosted during the week. If I wasn&apos;t so busy with clubs and review sessions at night I&apos;d attend more Im guessing because you fail to ask me a question. In many instances were a waste of resources. These should be defunded to reduce the cost of living in University Residences. In my experience, most of these activies turn out to be fairly boring. inclusion decision making throughout the university is key to making a student feel as though they actually could make a change in the environment around them Inter-murals were fun, but I have no idea who my fac fellow is and my hall doesn&apos;t have any planned events or dinners It is a struggle when either funding is limited or the host is not very creative. Pizza and movie nights only go so far. It is because I do not like my RA It is good for some people, but others are not into getting involved with the residences. it is useful to participate these activities. It seemed a bit lazy to not have to leave your dorm to do activities. It seems that they do a lot of the same things every year. It&apos;s hard to attend due to my schedule and work. However, the ones I have attended are fun. its great to get to know the girls and bond! Kind of silly programs Lame events at inconvenient times? Long time ago Lots of fun stuff! Love how they have nights where you can eat ice cream for free and stuff! LOVE the programs! Loved the dancing events Many of the programs I wish to attend do not give enough advanced notice. Many programs, very happy McCutcheon had great activites and programs McCutcheon Programs are too early in the day --&gt;I have class/homework to do then Megan, resident assistant for Owen NW2 is wonderful! Meredith hall needs to improve the programs MORE more craft nights More people should come! Most became a joke because of the lack of cohesiveness of the hall/lack of breadth of activities most not interesting or worth the time most of the events very few people go to Most of them seemed pretty forced and it seemed like people felt uncomfortable since they were pushed (for lack of a better term) into going Most of these activities and things are more important during freshmen and maybe sophomore year. After that most students keep to their friends and their own schedules. Most of these programs are not very interesting to students. My floor dinners didn&apos;t ever work out. People would rather go with their friends than people they don&apos;t really know on the floor. Hard to find enough seats for some floors to eat all together. My RA and faculty fellows freshman year were amazing. My RA and Faculty Fellows sophomore year didn&apos;t do anything with us at all. My RA does a very good job of putting on programs and getting our floor involved. My RA doesn&apos;t really do anything with our floor besides dinners. My RA puts on various events throughout the semester like weekly floor dinners and volunteering at the local dog pound. My RA was so boring My residence hall put on events and trips around Indiana and West Lafayette which were very affordable and a good escape. N/A N/A N/A N/A n/a N/A N/A Need to establish better relations between RAs and Hall clubs Need to make activities between residence halls to get to know people outside of your dorm too. / / More Tie-dye nights!!!!! And promote fac-fellows more! Never attended one, didn&apos;t know they ever occurred no no one wants cheesy crap like &quot;dress for success&quot; No time none none None none None Not as good as they used to be! not awesome, but still fun Not enough motivation to go. I went to one, and for the most part, the only other people to attend were a little socially inept. The students that I was more likely to build a friendship with were not there. not impressed not impressive. my RA has done nothing for my floor. Not many activities while I was there not many people attend Not only have I attended but I&apos;m an active part of the planning process as a club officer. The clubs do a lot of great things for the building, and work hard especially to bring the faculty fellows in as often as possible. Not very many interesting programs. Our Faculty Fellow is awesome, we still hang out as floor sometimes even though I live in the apartments now. Participated both my years as assistant to RA/attended meetings as well. Plenty of events to attend programs not very appealing see above comment See above. should not be week nights Shreve club was great! Since the question asked if I &apos;ever&apos; applied for housing, I answered yes. This was the first time I attended Purdue in 1987. Since this is my second year in a dorm I tend not to attend programs as much. A variety of the programs are similar to the ones Windsor had last year and I am in Windsor again. I also already have friends to do things with and I tend to be studying too. Some are good, others are annoying and lame. some are good, some are awful some halls get to do more than others, not fair Some of them seemed forced and hokey...it feels like they just need to put on an activity even if it isn&apos;t good. The good ones are excellent though Some things are really hokey and cheesy. Sometimes the activities only reach out to a small portion of the students within the residence hall Terrible activities planned The 2010 Chicago auto show trip was offerd by Cary for $5. The fliers were all over the building and neglected to inform that you must be in Cary club to attend. I was not able to go because my girlfriend could not come. The activities are fun and cater to many residents interests. The apartment style living did not have satisfying programs at all. I hardly ever saw my neighbours, or my RAs. Its a whole different story in the dorms, and its fantastic. The clubs and events provided by my R.A. for very useful and fun. Having dinner with a Faculty Fellow allowed us to interact and talk to a faculty member and learn more about college and he answered any questions we had. the events put on by the hall were nice but we were not encouraged to participate by our RA. The events were fun and created a sense of community. The Faculty Fellows program is hit or miss depending on your fellow, but I had an amazing one freshman year (Dr. Alan York and his family) who I remain in contact with as a great friend and whom I still join for dinners even though I live off campus now. The hall club at Harrison is not very organized and I can&apos;t remember the last program the hosted. The fac fellows program is useless if the fac fellows just come for the dinners. Many residents may also not like their particular fac fellow and that makes it hard for them to join in the activities that they are doing with the floor. The hall does pretty good at hosting events, but I think they should have a little more variety. They should also switch up the days and times, so people can attend some if not others. The hall programs are weak The housing director at *** Hall has extremely bad attidute. It was difficult to communicate with him, and wasn&apos;t helpful at all. The RA usually have awesome floor events. The sex education ones were helpful and fun. The variety of events is good, so if you miss one event, or don&apos;t want to attend one, another usually comes along for you to enjoy. There are way too many events that are pushed too hard. The residents are all adults so inform them and let them decide if they want to attend. there is never a large turnout to residence hall events. There was never a push to get the students involved and it was not always that exciting! There were a lot of activities that I attended as a freshmen will I lived in the resident halls, such as volleyball, and to all fired up. There were fun dances and activities to do. these programs help a lot They are fun, but there are not a lot of them that I am interested in. They are great! They are not successful, and should be eliminated to reduce costs. They have put on some pretty awesome and fun programs and it&apos;s a good way to get to know some other girls in the hall you probably wouldn&apos;t meet otherwise. They shouldn&apos;t have to do so many programs. Most are forced and just a waste of money They were never extremely well publicized and they never seemed that fun. This has nothing to do with an education, which is fine, but residents are forced to pay for club dues to fund events that very few people find interesting. I wish that were different. Too busy to attend - at times I can&apos;t make it. too much emphasis on the programs. most residents don&apos;t care about them Too much other stuff going on that I either have to do, or would just rather do instead. Varies too greatly from hall to hall. Needs to be better regulated when students are making a majority of decidions. Very creative and fun. Very enjoyable. Very few options were presented from my hall but I participated in other halls events. very fun We always have a lot of fun! We do not do anything as a floor... We have some really fun activities. I really love when food is involved. We just had two programs last week! They were wonderful! We never got to meet our Faculty Fellow. When I was a freshman, there were not many social functions offered by my RA; however, when I was an RA my senior year, I was required to hold social/educational functions for my floor. I feel that these programs are very important for the residents. While I think they&apos;re very important, I was sad to see that for the most part many hall members don&apos;t participate. There should be some sort of focus and determination on the RA part in order to bring together students. Windsor halls&apos; RAs put a lot of effort into many programs to make people to know each other well. However, the program itself wasn&apos;t that interesting. Windsor has the best hall activities. I&apos;ve heard this from people who moved to Windsor their second year and experience this myself. Windsor, the only hall I&apos;ve lived in, does tend to listen to its residents when it plans programs, which is part of why I think they tend to be successful. Would like to see a few more at a later time, I&apos;m involved in a lot of activities, so it is hard for me to make early evening programs. Yes, they are very fun and a good study break! Young Hall was not included in nearly any activities. 

 

 (HSF8) University Residences–Student Conduct Process–manner of addressing inappropriate resident conduct 

 (Already explained on RA question) A fire-arm found. Student is still allowed residence in a dorm... a little lax on the punishment A lot of information but people will be able to find what they need in one spot. A lot of stuff wasn&apos;t caught. My neighbors smoked weed and drank in their room all the time. A resident exhibited destruction of property and the staff of Owen dismissed responsibility from this case showing their lack of interest in the safety of the residents. The resident whose property was harmed had to seek legal action and obtain a restraining order from police officials to protect herself from the other resident. I am disappointed in the professionalism of this staff. After the first week, no RA, staff member, or anyone associated with university residences seems to care at all about noise, alcohol, or other non-permitted conduct within the residence hall building. They have our money and now we just live with however things go. It&apos;s shameful because the people who set the policies and push them as marketing for why Residences are better aren&apos;t the ones enforcing it and aren&apos;t ensuring that they are enforced. Again you are asking me if I have used without specifying Alcohol policy violation process at Hilltop went smoothly and fairly in my opinion. Am not familiar with this, seems like it is not used. As an RA I have no hand in the administrative level conduct process. As stated in the comment about the RA, I am unsatisfied with the process of discipline. She makes more noise than all of us residents but we get written-up for the most ridiculous reasons. Be less strict on simple harmless things Been wanting to use this but haven&apos;t been able to find it Better enforcement of quiet hours would be nice...or at least the option to live on a certain floor/dorm where quiet hours are more strict Booming stereos need to be properly address. Ban them? Could ease up on the escort policy. Create strike policy for drug-use. Alcohol should also be 3 strikes, not just 2 and you are kicked out. Didn&apos;t know it existed. Could have come in handy. didnt use Does drinking alcohol in the dorms have to be a huge conviction? The entire process from being harassed by RA&apos;s to meeting with Residence Hall Managers is way over blown. Enforce it better. ENFORCE THE RULES PLEASE, if someone gets caught with WEED, they should be kicked out...or else, might as well have everything legal. Enforcing of the quiet hour times is erratic and sometimes misguided. firm but fair First semester freshman year, 17 year old roommate was intoxicated, paramedics were called, and she was only placed on housing probabtion. From what I hear, they are a bit strict especially when they hear you puking in the bathroom from drinking. They should not call the cops just because of throwing up. ghey Girls on my floor were being loud way after quiet hours several nights in a row, so I talked to my RA, and she helped to fix the problem. got in trouble for being unescorted at the beginning of the year. got my warning letter and havent had a problem since. I dont know how more serious violations are handled though Great to know I can talk to my RA if there is a problem. Had issues with my roommate and my RA did nothing about them. The RA avoided the issue no matter how many times I told them of the problems Have I used what? Haven&apos;t encountered. Haven&apos;t had to use haven&apos;t used Helped kindof. Hillenbrand does nothing about controlling the Freshman. Is there any wonder why they are not letting them back in next year? Huh? I am an RA and I do not feel as though the process is severe enough to actually discourage students from violating policies. They continue to violate quiet hour policies because the only implications are a short meeting with the RLM. I applied for housing and decided not to live on campus, so I can not answer any of these questions. I believe that it is important that the R.A.&apos;s address any misconduct. This ensures that students obey the rules of the residence halls and that the other students have a safe and fun experience. I did not feel that my RA was effective at problem solving. I didn&apos;t have any process - just a letter home to my parents without any discussion (granted, it occurred on literally the last night of the semester) I do not know where to go for this.......... I do not like that people get away wiht smoking weed in the dorms, but they get punished for drinking. I don&apos;t know if I am understanding the question, but several RA&apos;s have threatened that if something happens we would be &apos;documented&apos;. Nothing has been explained about this &apos;documentation&apos; so I don&apos;t understand what happens, even though I have been living in Univ residences for more than 3 years. Also the &apos;threat&apos; itself is very uncomfortable when mistakes are made, not intentional misbehaviors. Some RA&apos;s address the fault of 1-2 residents&apos; as if our whole floor (of 40 people) are all criminals. I don&apos;t like it when people get written up for petty offenses without warnings. Some RA&apos;s get it, some have no clue and want to write people up for doing nothing at all except talking and fellowshiping. I feel like the rules are enforced, but it is difficult to stop people from repeating offences with out kicking them out (which may be too harsh of a response at times). i feel that this is a fair process I go to bed at a time that is considered early by most other students and have always had issues with other residents being to loud. I think more disciplinary actions should be taken. Writing students up doesn&apos;t really have consequences. I got written up for having a nerf gun in the dorms, and i didn&apos;t even have one. It&apos;s kinda ridiculous I had a bad roommate. I had to jump through so many loopholes to get a roommate change. It made my freshman year miserable. I had issues my freshman year and my RA was no help. I almost left school because of how horribly it was handled. I had some neighbors that were out of control and loud, and they did not get in trouble for a very long time. I have a neighbor whose child cried loudly every night, but I never reported since a crying child is already too much for a tiring family :). I have never been in trouble when in a dorm. But guys who were, I think recieved too many warnings. So they just kept breaking the rules. Also, it&apos;s unfair to split damage costs between all residences for something that one *** pulled when he/she was drunk. I have never had to deal with this, but being a guy lessens the need quite a bit I have not had a problem with student conduct I have not personally had an RA approach me about conduct, but I have approached residents, and also helped the current RAs with how to approach residents. They are respectful and tactful. I have not used this service, but I can hear people make noise complaints and nothing is done. I have see friends deal with negative experiences of getting written up in dorms for not escorting guests or for false accusal of having alcohol. I don&apos;t feel that it is necessary for guests to be escorted throughout university residences and there should be coed bathrooms on every floor. I have used this site to see if certain items were permitted in the dorms and the requirements on fridges and microwaves I haven&apos;t personally used this process but it has been used on my floor and I think that the lenience is upsetting. I haven&apos;t witnessed any issues with this. I haven&apos;t witnessed any reprimanding for inappropriate conduct. I know of hall mates who have vandalized other hall mates&apos; rooms, and proper action was taken. I know people who have been verbally harassed by RA&apos;s in an attempt to take disciplinary measures. I know several people who have used this system and it is very unfair. There are some people and student polulations that get excused just because of their status on campus instead of the fact that they violated the rules. I know that personally I got in trouble once for something I didn&apos;t do, but no one would listen to me or take the time to listen to the complants about the RA. I like how the system works in Hawkins hall. The RA is only responsible for making University Residence policy known, not being the iron fist that enforces it. If a resident is repeatedly not following policy, the RA will write an Incident Report (IR). It is up to the Resident Life Manager then to talk to the resident about the IR he or she received. This process allows the RA to stay friends with the residents while also being in a position of power. I live at Meredith Hall, and there are always people running up and down the hall and people screaming at night. At 1 am it is not uncommon for people to scream. I think that it would be nice if my RA did something about it. And it would be better if there were penalties for not respecting quiet hours after being warned several tiems, such as a fine or for extreme cases, being kicked out of the residence halls. I lived in a hall where lot&apos;s of ridiculous stuff happened. I feel like very little was done about it, despite obvious problems. I never had to go through this process, but it seemed well-defined in my residence hall. I never used this, but the topic is important. i reported a person who was smoking weed on my floor. / and i was caught smoking within 30 feet..lol I think a lot of upper management is very picky about rules. i think drinking restrictions on residents that are over 21 is too harsh. but i understand the principles. I think RAs handle inappropriate conduct very well. I think some RA rule enforcement is abused. I think that some of the time RAs overreact and at other tims don&apos;t react at all and this troubles me because I see some people get away with things they shouldn&apos;t and others get punished when they need not be. I thought our dorm was appropriate and when accidents happen they (at mccutcheon atleast) were not detrimental punishments which was nice considering accidents do happen but i heard of other dorms&apos; ra&apos;s being really lame and on a &apos;power trip&apos;. i think we need to remember acidents can always be forgiven I was accused of underage drinking, and while I was confirmed by 5 people that I did not partake, I still had to meet with the head of the residence hall and he still gave me a very hard time. The RA&apos;s did not handle the situation appropriately, and it was not something I needed to deal with in the middle of finals week. I was never disciplined. However, when someone did get in &apos;trouble&apos; they were dealt with in a very private manner. I was never in trouble or knew of anyone that was in trouble in my dorm but I have heard stories and thought that the situation was handled well. I was penalized for doing basically nothing. We wrestled for two seconds when I lived in the dorms and we got in trouble. Purdue is RIDICULOUSLY strict about the stupidest things. I was reprimanded for &quot;tailgating&quot; into Windsor to see my friends, who backed up my presence, but I had to talk to Cara, who was very nice and polite. I was written up last year and I was informed that another infraction would put me on some sort of academic sanctions, but there was no clarification of what that meant and there was no documentation of what that meant. I asked the front desk, and those people had no idea either. I work in the residence halls and I believe that there are many things that students are written up for that they should not be. The rules need to be maintained for important issues, otherwise get real. I&apos;m a little confused about the above question. If it is asking that I&apos;ve followed the student conduct, then the answer is yes. However, if it is asking if I&apos;ve had to address a student conduct issue, then the answer is no. I&apos;m an RA I&apos;ve experienced some pretty mean RAs. They were rude and sarcastic. I&apos;ve also seen really timid ones incapable of discipline. I&apos;ve had it used on me, they just knocked on my door and told me to turn down my music, so I did. I&apos;ve never had to use this process, even though I should have when I was living in the halls I&apos;ve never used that website, I just felt like my RA wasn&apos;t very flexible in the rules. If a student lives in the same wing as someone, but on a different floor, they shouldn&apos;t have to be escorted to another floor to visit with friends. If you report your roommate for alcohol or illegal substances, you are also held liable. How the heck does that make any sense?!? In my dorm last semester, this was not handled very well by my RA. In my dorm students who brought weapons and used drugs in their rooms were not kicked out immediately. There is no point in having a &quot;zero tolerance policy&quot; if it is not enforced. Also, alcohol should be added to the zero tolerance policy. Currently students treat their dorms like party halls instead of residences. initially given citation when my roommate stole a chair without any investigation whatsoever as to who was at fault It always seems to be the same people being loud and destructive and though out the year their behavior really has not changed. I don&apos;t know if it is because the students don&apos;t care or the fact that they are not being punished. It feels really weird to have to confront your roommate if you have a problem with something. I had several problems with my roommate as a freshman, but I never spoke with him about it because it was very uncomfortable to attempt to do it. There should be a better first step in the process than &quot;oh, have you told your roommate? no? then stop complaining!&quot; It is good to have this in place for students to use. It is very frustrating when everyone pays for the misconduct of a few residents. It takes far too long to remove a resident from the hall after three felony drug charges. It is hard to study and live a stress free life not knowing what is transpiring down the hall. The halls promised 24 hours no tolerance, they need to fulfill that promise. it was horrible at stopping things or being an incentive to not do things it&apos;s variable between RAs and Managers of residences. I know it&apos;s &quot;regulated&quot; but in the real world it&apos;s not Lack of enforcement of quiet hours Last Tuesday a kid broke the door in the Busby and it was nice to see how fast the issue was resolved. Lighten up the marijuana violation rules. IU students can get caught up to 3 times before they get kicked out, here all it takes is once. A little harsh and unnecessary. Little follow through Long time ago Make people stop talking right outside resident windows in warm weather. I had a 2nd floor room and people would smoke (not often) or talk (all the time) at all hours right outside my window and it was far too hot to close the window. Many RA&apos;s overreact to problems that are not deserving of the punishment they wish to advise. More action needs to be taken with individuals who are breaking the law. More could be done about the volume in the hallways at night. More strict quiet hours, please. I don&apos;t appreciate when there is a party down the hall at 3am on a Saturday night, or when the guys stand in the hall and talk VERY loudly from 2am until 4:30am while I am trying to sleep on a Wednesday night. Mostly common sense things. My comments about this can be found in an earlier question. My neighboors during my freshman year always complained to my RA and never personally came to me to ask me to turn my music down. I was not playing it extremely loudly but the speaker was right next to their wall. Even my RA said that they needed to be more understanding and that my music was really not unreasonably loud. However, since they confronted my RA so many times, she had to make a formal note on my behavior. I would have liked to have had more flexibility in the situation since the ruling party (RA) even thought that my behavior was not &quot;bad.&quot; My RA does not enforce quiet hours, so in turn I am forced to ask others to be quiet. My RA does not often deal with it courteously My RA does nothing about disruptive people on my floor. My RA is hit and miss. Quiet hours are not enforced on the weekends. 2-3am is very loud and sleep is impossible. Drunk students prowl the halls during this time and nothing is done. Students smoke pot in there rooms and everyone know nothing is done. It is no wonder why Owen hall is forced to pay for two TVs nothing is done to prevent drunk underage students from vandalizing things. My RA was too drunk to handle a situation where a drunk roommate was spitting and threatening to harm another girl. She made the victimized roommate (the one being spit upon and threatened) leave the room for the night. The girl&apos;s father eventually paid for her to have a week&apos;s stay at the Union Club Hotel until finals were over because the RA wouldn&apos;t handle the situation. My RA was very one-sided when it came to a problem. My side of the story was never asked and my RA would assume things and then try to blame for everything without having the full story. My RA went over the rules a lot throughout the semester. My roommate and her boyfriend were caught having sex in a public study lounge and they were let off the hook with no punishment. My roommate had sex in the bed that was less than 2 feet way from mine while I was there. I told the roommate that I was uncomfortable with this and when it happened again, I talked to the RA and office staff and basically was told all I could do was wait until the end of the semester to move out. That&apos;s fine, but what about the other 15 weeks that I had to be in the same room with her? My roommate has caused multiple disruption with alcohol, since i&apos;ve lived here. such as kicking me out of my room to have sex with a random girl, passing out and peeing on the floor 3 times, and being drunk in my room countless other times. when i confronted my RA about this and worked up the bureaucratic ladder of this school it wasn&apos;t till the 3rd time he urinated on the floor till any action was taken against him. This has caused me to stay up countless nights, take time out of my studying, and well as effected my grades due to lack of sleep right before exams. Even after filling out &quot;roommate agreement form&quot; nothing happened. it only showed to me, my family supporting me that Purdue&apos;s lack of ability to take action in these situations as well as well as the support of student underage drinking. This has changed my respect, and outlook at Purdue and the living conditions that Purdue boasts about. My roommate my freshmen year actually got kicked out the dorms. While I think when inappropriate conduct is found it is dealt with harshly, some of it still goes unnoticed and unpunished. My roommate was caught smoking marijuana in the dorms and teh informed my RA prior to the incident and it was taken care of very well. My roommate was quite discourteous and was storing alcohol in the fridge. I&apos;m not sure my RA particularly cared. N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A n/a N/A n/a N/A Need more RA patrols because people are still to loud after quiet hours. Should get less warnings to discourage it. needs to have more checks to make sure both parties involved know there is a problem and are working on it instead of just relying on the word of one party that they have talked to the other party Never been written up, but have written up residents. I&apos;m an RA... Never had a problem with anyone&apos;s conduct. Never was involved with the student conduct process no No complaints. Keeps things from getting out of control. No need No problems ever arise. I laughed once during silent hours and got written up at the end of the fall semester. I had to stay an extra day for a meeting with the RLM. It was ridiculous. Noise is not dealt with and it can actually effect people, but lack of escort is punished when noone cares about escorts. none none none none none None none none Not all RA&apos;s are reliable in dealing with student conduct. Not enough penalties for residents with multiple offenses. Possibly consider fees for residents who are caught drinking in the res halls. Nothing I can&apos;t deal with --&gt;only whiners complain like that about stupid things other people. Although charging the floor for a janitor too lazy to do her job was ridiculous. Nothing was ever done about inappropriate or disruptive behavior. Policies that aren&apos;t actual policies being enforced as policies when they are simply guidelines that are not required but appreciated.... confusing, unneeded.  / / Staff are sometimes very rude, especially maintenance. Punishing both roommates for alcohol or drug violations seems harsh. It should really be the offender themself, and not the dorm-mate, who bears the punishment. Rules are too strict and reminded me of my residential high school. Things should be more lax and allow people more freedoms. same as above comment Several instances of &apos;overreacting&apos;; making a very big deal out of something minor; threatening to involve the police over trivial matters Should be much more strict .. There&apos;s not enough information online. so I guess drunk people can just randomly come in late at night and make a riot huh...? Some halls are better at taking care of inappropriate behavior than others. Some measures seem extreme and unecessary for small incidents. It is understandable however, given the responsibilty of the university and the expectations parents have of it. Some people get power hungry. Some RA&apos;s are a little too edgy and start writing people up too easy. Please give us the benefit of the doubt, its college and we&apos;re just communicating. Some RAs are too strict, while others care too little. some rules are very pointless, ie. no prejecting anything out the window (including objects, liquids, voice???) I still dont understand why the dorms are separated boys and girls, it is very old fashion...these are new times Some students get away with too much while others can&apos;t get a way with anything. Largely subjective system Sometimes it seems that staff &quot;jumps the gun&quot; as far as assuming students are in the wrong, but generally my experiences have been positive. sometimes responses can be heavy handed. Sometimes there are indecency within the residence hall, such as people making a big mess on the floor. Sometimes they overreact, especially when someone of opposite gender is alone in stairwell. Students were not held to the smoking 30 ft away from a building policy! The appropriate measures were taken when peers on floor misconducted, especially with alcohol abuse. The business of taking care of resident behavior at Meredith was very poor. Employees took a long time to fix the problems, resulting in a resident having to move out of the room into another person&apos;s room for a week because nothing could be resolved in a timely manner. the fact that most of that is written out isn&apos;t assumed behavior of adults is ridiculous. The issue was really not solved because the RA didn&apos;t feel like they are in a position to the set the other person straight. The life skills person or whoever I had to talk to would not listen to my opinion or side of the story; insisted that I had no idea what I was talking about and my R.A. could absolutely not even be a little wrong. I don&apos;t understand the point of this person if he/she is only there to be the R.A&apos;s minion. The manner of addressing inappropriate conduct is impersonal and too harsh to individuals who were not directly responsible. The means in which floor charges are assessed is pretty ridiculous. The only thing I care about is quiet hours. They aren&apos;t always enforced, but usually are. The RA was horrible. The hall was constantly loud during quiet hours the RA&apos;s were a little too strict The RA&apos;s were mainly bark and no bite. The RLMs always assume you&apos;re in the wrong and don&apos;t care what your side of the story is. The rules set in place are naive and do not make sense. I have never heard of any other campus where females have to be &apos;escorted&apos; through a male hallway and vise versa. We are adults living in the 21st century and do not need to be treated like children; grow up. The rules were too strict for minor offenses and too lax for major ones. The student conduct process sounds great, but is entirely ineffective in practice. The RAs have surprisingly little power other than just telling people to &quot;quiet down&quot; or &quot;respect your neighbors.&quot; In particular, the Non-compliance statement is very weak and specifies no punitive consequences for residents who don&apos;t comply. Meetings with authorities don&apos;t matter to people who have already refused to comply with aforementioned authorities. they need to be able to take action against students if they do something and they know about it instead of letting them get away with it They need to kick out more people from the dorms for repeatedly violating resident rules. Things happen all the time, ie Shower curtains missing; but all that is done about it is everyone is charged a fee and whomever did it should be ashamed. Poor. Things like noise complaints, which are much more common an annoying than other behavior, is never addressed. This is college, sometimes these can be way too strict. This is the one thing our Res assistant did well. This process is an absolute joke. If a resident is caught with marajuana, they should not be switched between halls as a disciplinary action. Stop advertising zero tolerance, the tlresidents get away with too much This process should be reviewed. Too strict in comparison to other universities. Tried to get something done about my roommate but was ignored Unacceptable fees scheme for dorm floors. Which floor with which people is completely random, yet large fees charged with no way to address matter. University policies are the problem, not the execution of the policies. Very important contract as it will be the key to any room disputes. Very well done. Very inconsistent and irresponsible on the part of those in authority. Wasn&apos;t helpful 7 yrs ago as undergrad but that was due to the RA Way too strict about minor things and abuse power sometimes. We were written up once for noise. No warnings, just a write up. What? When I had a problem my RA was very helpful, but it has taken awhile. I have been going through an issue for a month and a half. I feel that this is an excessive time to have a problem resolved. When something is supposed to be zero tolerance it should be zero tolerance. I know several people not kicked out of housing due to drugs and alcohol. Also, this looks bad for the RA who told residents that it was zero tolerance. Why is alcohol not allowed in th dorms even for over 21&apos;s? Childish. 

 

 (HFS9) University Residences–Variety of Dining Options Traditional, On the Go, Retail Operations 

 1 swipe for 5 items is not a good/fair deal. the 5 items are worth sometimes 1/2 a swipe&apos;s $ value 1. The price for me to visit as a non-resident is ridiculous. $10 is just too much for a guy wanting to have dinner with his little bro. / / 2. The level of waste generated is nothing short of a crime. We could feed every homeless/undernourished person from here to Indy with all the food that is simply thrown away. That is absolutely grotesque policy. / / 3. Hours should be expanded. At most other universities I&apos;ve visited there is always a late night option. 5 items per one swipe seems too small as opposed to traditional dining court swipe A 24hour option would be nice. something more than a market too. A 24-hour On-The-Go would be nice, and it would create more jobs. A coffee shop or somewhere to buy coffee during the day would be a great addition. A convenience store is needed close to Purdue Village. Going to Wal-mart is time consuming and eventually forces you to get a car A little expensive. A lot of variation but the pattern of menus will be the same and it will bore people A suggestion for the On-The-Go: If you use a recyclable bag to get the food, you should be able to get at least one extra item. This would provide a little extra incentive for students not to waste so many plastic bags! Again, it&apos;s been a while, but the services seem to improve with more locations now. all meal plans need to be more flexible meal swipes needs to transfer over All of the items in convenience stores such as Boiler Express are ridiculously overpriced. All of the traditional dining courts have terrible food and THE COFFEE IS TOO WEEK. It is also ridiculous that students aren&apos;t allowed to swipe for their fellow students. On the Go is the biggest rip off i have ever heard of. It blows my mind how Purdue can justify charging one meal swipe (about $8~11) For 33 cent bags of chips and a poorly made sandwich. Allow students to use meal plans in Boiler Junction and Boiler Crossing. Try to bring in a menu with more variety such as Indian food. Although there is a wide variety of options, the blandness of the options makes them seem very repetitive. I can see the University Residences are trying, however I do feel like I get the same food every day. Amazing dining halls. Although I hate that your meal swipes do not roll over, you should not have to use the remaining within the week. Such a rip off but they probably know that. Extra meal swipes should be converted to dining dollars... even though those shops rip you off too. Amazing food and selection at dining courts. Love the buffet style. on the go is fine. the stores where you can buy extra food and the like are rediculusly overpriced. And here is the kicker: ITS REAL MONEY THAT IS SPENT THERE! Even though its included in the dining hall meal plan, it was paid for by real money. So Purdue is extorting a lot of money from the students via the harrison late night grill thing and the small shops that sell cherrios and condoms and such (essential college things right?) AMAZING FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could still eat at the dining courts every day! Amazing selection and huge selection of different foods, even in the same hall day to day. Amazing! An on-the-go meal is not worth $10. An On-The-Go option that is on academic campus would be great! Any options for Sunday night would be nice. I always have meal swipes that go to waste. at on-the-go the portions are very small and many times I did not have time to eat in the dining area. AWESOME AWESOME awesome! i love boiler junction and boiler crossing! bad timings Best dining anywhere! BEST DINING COURTS!! Have more fresh fruit and REAL juice though! LOVE on the go! best in the country Best in the nation BEST part of living in university residences!! Better hours for on the go and grills are needed. On the go closes too early, especially on Friday. Traditional dining halls should open earlier in the morning (half- to one hour earlier). Better meal plans where you don&apos;t lose swipes. better variety of food is needed. Also, they need to provide to different eating habits like not all pork on some nights etc. Bigger kitchens in dinning halls would be nice for cooking. The areas are small with really old equipment that needs replaced. Boiler Block user Boiler crossing should be equal in size and variety to Boiler Junction. I find they never have as much and lack in stock. boiler mart and junction are too expensive Bottled drinks would be nice for on-the-go. Bring an On-The-Go! location on campus, preferably stewart center. do not have enough time in my day to get back to a res hall or ford to eat. bring back breakfast at Windsor Bring the Griffin express (or something like it )back to Hillenbrand and maybe other res halls too Bring Windsor back on the weekends. Build more On-the-Go&apos;s in the dining courts and expand upon the number of items you can take because that small meal isn&apos;t very long lasting and/or filling...... But Hawkins doesn&apos;t offer a meal plan? What the *** is that? It should at least be offered... By the end of the year I got tired of the food options because they were repeated throughout the year. Carey Knight Spot does not have good food and the amount of options could be increased. cheap food on on-the-go, not compatible with the value of a swipe. VERY DISAPPOINTED about this. Could add more variety on the &quot;on the go&quot; options. Could be more open instead of being forced in a way to either eat on-the-go or in the dining halls could work on quality... Delicious. Delicious. Difficult to judge and Purdue has very strict limits. dining at purdue is AWESOME!!! dining court food can get old. Dining courts and On the Go need to have more vegetarian options Dining courts are great, except On the Go charges more money than the actual costs of all meals. If students can pick more items, it would be better. Dining courts get way to big of lines at times. Sometimes after you get food there is nowhere to sit, happens at windsor mostly. Dining Dollars are too limited. We should be able to use them in more places. Dining halls are excellent, on the go could use more options Dining Halls are excellent. Dining halls are extremely expensive and when using On the Go, the cost for the food is fractional to what you would be able to get when eating in the dining hall. Dining halls need more salads that are fresh. The lettuce was always wilted. Dining halls NEED to be on the academic part of campus. It&apos;s SOOO hard to run back to the dining halls when you have classes all day. I also think students should be able to use their dining dollars in the Union. Also, I think it would be great to have Franchise restaurants available to use dining dollars. Dining Halls need to keep food stocked until the meal time is over. If food runs out, REFILL IT! dining is awesome in every aspect, i just wish some of the halls were open an hour later (atleast i did when i ate there, im not sure if they changed the hours but i wanted to eat at 8:30 a lot and i couldn&apos;t) Dining options are far from the academic campus - an on-the-go on the academic campus would be awesome. Power hours aren&apos;t long enough to walk all the way to the dining courts, eat and walk back. Dining options were really important to me. The dining courts do tend to get crowded around 6:30 pm, but the food is great. On-the-go is really convenient too. I just wish that we could share leftover swipes with others. Dining swipes should be allowed use for guests. Dinner on Sundays should be made available! dinner should be open later, and i would really appreciate a smaller meal swipe plan since i almost never use them all Dinning courts are great for students! Dont agree with not being able to swipe others in on your meal plan. You alread have paid the money, so we should be obligated to swipe other in with our personal meal plan. On the go is a rip off. Either reduce the price of meal plans or allow us to take more things from on the go, or reduce the prices from the mini-marts, because your costs are ridiculously too high. A single swipe (~$7-8) should get us more than 5 bags of chips. Also, allow us to use all of our dining dollars at the union. The $25 limit is barely enough for 5 meals there. Even though I&apos;m off campus now, I go to the dinning courts many times each semester. everything is the same just about everywhere. the only variety is really in the retail operations. dining courts usually cycle through the same meals, on the go changes rarely, but most places have their specialties. Everything is too expensive. I eat too much because I feel bad wasting all that money on food I didn&apos;t eat. Makes me feel like I&apos;m wasting food and money. Excellent. / / A little pricey without a meal plan, but the services are excellent compared to all other universities I have visited. expensive EXPENSIVE Expensive and not a lot of variety in a given area Expensive outside the meal plan. Expensive, expensive, expensive. extra meal swipes should roll over, and we should be able to swipe others in with out meal swipes instead of using dining dollars Family always enjoyed visiting the dining halls when visiting me. Fantastic dining options! FANTASTIC food offered. Feels like On the Go is very limited. / Traditional Dining Court&apos;s time limit is frustrating. / People get hungry at night.. Food are not that great in On The Go. food felt unhealthy. food in all the DC&apos;s is very good but I would like some more fresh vegetables(corn, peas, green beans) and as with any cafeteria the more variety the better Food is always the same, they&apos;re all on a bi-weekly rotation. Also, the On the Go and retail operations are huge rip-offs. You never seem to get your money&apos;s worth in the dining halls. food is amazing. keep it up Food is decent. Food is excellent in dining courts. Food is excellent. Quality of coffee, however, is a crapshoot. Some days its passable; but overall tends to be very watery. food is getting bad Food is great! I just wish they would serve Italian subs more often in On the Go. Food options good, payment options could be better, would prefer more plan sizes, on-the-go disappointing, retail operations very good. Food r unhealthy and gross. Not a lot of choice so it&apos;s rip off. Thanks purdue, u made me struck with meal plan and suffered gross food. I want to cancel meal plan. Please make that choice. Thank god I&apos;m moving in apt this fall food swipes are a waste of money the way they are set up Food was excellent! food would be better if served simple things insead of some of the more complicated recipies that they attempt to do well For a meal that costs $9.00, On-The-Go is not really worth the amount you pay For on the Go, more hot food and better varieties. For the on the go i feel as though i am getting ripped off by the amount that a swipe costs and the amount i am getting. Ford is the only good place to eat ford needs the food of wiley Ford On the Go has horrible selection. same thing way too often. Fried chicken not chipotle mayo green pepper crappy chicken. Keep it simple and please the students. Fruit jammers are amazing. glad that they are finally letting you use dining dollars in other location. wish they could continue to make this process better Good but not great selection for vegetarians. It would be nearly impossible to be vegan. Good food Good food in dining courts. good food. workers should be more careful and cautious when it comes to handling food simultaenously with other non food items. / they should change their gloves if they go elsewhere and come back to the food. good options in the west lafayette area Good stuff good to have. wish they were more and not only in the dorms good variety but would have been helpful if on the go was open later for exam days Good variety of options. Wish that meal swipes could be used by guests. Grab and Go has good food but you don&apos;t get enough for what you pay. Maybe it could cost only half a meal swipe. Great dining program. Great food but way too expensive. Great food! Great system Great system at Purdue Great! GREAT! hard to always go to the dining courts and get good food when they are offered. Often waste &quot;swipes&quot; Having more retail locations or keeping existing ones open more hours would be nice Having the Boiler Crossing and Boiler Junction, as well as On the Go, Harrison Grille and Carry Knight Spot is all really great. And the food at the traditional dining courts is good. It would be sweet if they took suggestions. They don&apos;t have to follow them, but they could at least look at them. Also, their should be more meal options, including the option of not getting a meal plan. Hawkins Hall needs a dining court !!! Hours of operation can be an inconvenience. How about a noun to complete your sentence fragment? If I have to use proper grammar in class, why can Purdue get away with awful grammar in its surveys? How about at least an on-the-go in the middle of campus. There isn&apos;t enough time between classes to walk off campus to grab food to walk back. I personally think the ENAD building would be an excellent location. How do our meals cost over $9.00? That is ridiculous. Something is wrong with that. On the go is not worth that much ever. I absolutely hate that dining dollar spending is limited per location. This is extremely inconvenient. I absolutely loved the On-The-Go options at the dining halls. They were very nice for when I had to spend the day on campus and could not make it to a dining hall to sit down for lunch. I am a vegetarian and I am very happy with the options I am provided. In Windsor I have the best options and that is where I eat the most. At the other dining halls it is a little difficult to find something for me to eat, but I appreciate the &quot;Vegetarian&quot; on the cards to let me know what is and what isn&apos;t. I am allergic to dairy, and there aren&apos;t always a lot of options, and that isn&apos;t a marked allergy. I am on the 12 meal plan and feel that regardless of the plan any student is on they should be allowed to use their swipes on other students or friends instead of using dining dollars. Also it is ridiculous how much money Purdue makes off of on the go considering the swipe is valued at about two times what is spent on the food you can get there. Thus I feel we ought to either be allowed to receive more items per swipe or receive some sort of compensation via dining dollars when using on the go; and I am sure the Purdue employees are intelligent enough to come up with a solution. I am quite satisfied with how the dining options work, but I wish you could use more than $25 of your dining dollars in the Union I am very pleased with the dining courts and on the go places. We have excellent food here at Purdue. The only thing is sometimes I wish on the go was open on Saturdays. I am very pleased with the dining system. I am very sick of the food. It seems like the quality has deteriorated in the past 2 and a half years. I believe that having a variety of dining options is very important and useful. It was very helpful to have traditional dining for dinner, it gave me a chance to relax after the day was done with my friends. On the Go was useful for lunches when I didn&apos;t have much time between classes to go sit down for lunch. I believe that on the go should be open a little later then it currently is. I believe that the On the Go option as a meal takes great advantage of the typical &quot;hurried&quot; lifestyle of most students. The On the Go option is both helpful and highly used, however, the cost of this characteristically small meal seems outrageous for the small amount of food that you receive. I think that the On the Go process could be simplified and cheapened to make it a more appealing and practical option. If this were the case I believe that even more students would use this option, despite potentially less food choices. Currently, I think many students only use On the Go as a last resort to use their swipes if they believe that they will lose them. If a few changes are implemented to make On the Go meals &quot;worth it&quot; I think that students would be much more likely to utilize the On the Go process as an everyday part of their campus lives. I definitely like that the dining halls post their menus online. I also like how they each have their own specialties as well as different design styles. I didn&apos;t like windsor dining court not being open on weekends. I dislike how meal swipes expire at the end of the week. I paid for them, why do they disappear if I don&apos;t use them in a weekly period? I do not care so much for the dining courts. On the Go needs to have more variety and not just have the same thing every single week. I do not like that we HAVE to have a dining plan if we live in a dorm. I don&apos;t feel as if the on-the-go provides the amount of food that should be equivalent to one swipe. Block Plan was most beneficial. I don&apos;t have a meal plan, but when I do get the chance to eat at the dining courts or get something from On the Go, there are always a lot of options. I don&apos;t like that our meals are weekly. It ends up being a waste of money if I eat more/less meals one week compared to another. It would make more sense to have a regular debit account and simply pay for meals, either per meal, or for a block of meals for the semester/year. I don&apos;t think that the selection is wide enough at ON-the-Go locations. I know that the effort is there, and it is beneficial, but even so, the food is just not that great to pick from. It&apos;s very important to have these because it is essential if we&apos;re ever going to eat during a busy day. I eat at the dining courts very often I feel like I&apos;m getting ripped off especially when using On the Go. I feel like we get charged way too much for a dining plan if we live in the dorms. I feel that the foods provided in the &quot;on-the-go&quot; areas do not meet the price that we pay for each meal. Meaning we do not get our money&apos;s worth. I feel the dining courts need more variety and also more healthy choices. I feel there needs to be a better selection for people with celiacs disease and other similar disabilities I felt like I ate salads most days of the week in order to eat something healthy. There aren&apos;t always healthy options in the areas where there&apos;s warm food. I hardly eat anything at my meals in the dining halls I hate that there really isn&apos;t a great variety of foods to choose from; even when you go to different dining halls, it&apos;s still the same. I think there should be some more culturally inspired foods in dining halls. I hate the fact the the dining courts are on a monthly rotation. I have a doctor-mandated diet that requires me to avoid all gluten, and anything that may have been contaminated by gluten, due to a severe auto-immune intolerance. I am very unhappy with the way Housing and Food Services has dealt with this issue, because due to the Americans With Disabilities Act, I should not be required to pay for meals that I can&apos;t eat. The dining courts try to accommodate me, but the choices are slim and there is no possible way I can maintain a healthy, balanced diet by eating the guaranteed gluten free choices provided by University Residences. Housing and Food Services will not allow me to purchase less than 10 meals a week, and because I am not 19 years old they will not permit me to be on the Boiler Block Plan, so instead I am confined by this bureaucratic red tape and must pay over $1000 for meals that I will never eat, while still having to buy supplemental food to keep on my dorm so that I can have enough sustenance to lead a somewhat balanced, healthy lifestyle. I will not be living in University Residences ever again, and I will not recommend University Residences to anyone requiring any sort of accommodation. I have been extremely disappointed. I have a had an experience where a hamburger I got from Earhart On the Go was already bad. It smelled funky and had a sour taste to it. Lucky I didn&apos;t eat the whole thing thinking that it was just me. Or else the results would&apos;ve been bad. I have been swiped into the dining courts a few times by friends that live in the residence halls. The food was good and it seemed like there was a lot of options to choose frmo, but from what my friends have told me, the university residence dining gets very old after a while. I have celiac disease and my gluten free options are absolutely horrible. I have to pay for a meal plan, yet I have almost no option in choosing a healthy gluten free food that I can ensure is not cross contaminated. I have food allergies and therefore require a special diet - while I wish there were more gluten free options at on the go, I am very pleased with the service I have been receiving in the dining courts. I have used all the dining options. All are fine, but the dining courts tend to be crowded and aren&apos;t open late enough. I have yet to be displeased with a single meal. The opportunity to have steak every week has been most enjoyable, and even the fries are good. I&apos;m impressed also with the nutritious options available. Keep up the good work! I heart Wiley! i hope there are more variety of snacks on &quot;on the go&quot; I just wish Windsor would be open for either breakfast or weekends, and that Grab and Go would be open longer and maybe on weekends I know it is not university residences, but something like the old PMU dining court would be nice. I know that you&apos;re trying to save money, but almost all on the go options are either things I can buy cheaper somewhere else or extremely unhealthy. I like all the different choices I like that the dining halls are serving more fish options, epsecially during lent. I like the dining courts and on-the-go. Harrison Grille is really nice too. i like the dining halls, i still eat there occasionally even though i don&apos;t live on campus. It would be nice to have on the go open a little later though, so people could get it for dinner if htey chose to eat later. I like the diversity of options, but I think On the Go is a real ripoff. Paying one swipe ($15 or more on the Block plan) on $4.00 worth of food just makes me feel screwed. The variety of food in the dining courts is amazing! I use the menus online to pick where I want to go for a meal. I like the meal plan for off campus housing. I like the variety of foods, even though ppl say its not good it is. but i would like to see it become healthier. I like the way the dining courts are set up now, but on the weekends, possibly close Wiley for breakfast and open Ford and Hillenbrand so that students don&apos;t have to walk across campus to get food at 8am i like them all, except i do not like the prices and boiler express and boiler junction - way too high I live in off campus housing now and miss the dining courts every day. All my friends who have visited from other schools are jealous of the absolutely AMAZING dining options which Purdue provides! I live off-campus and I still come back for the dining courts. I think there should be more of a discounted price for current students I love eating :)) I love On the Go options because it is a quick easy way to get food (especially if you aren&apos;t eating with someone) and you can eat it wherever! I love On the Go, but I was sad to hear that Windsor was not open on the weekends. I love On the Go, but there needs to be more options or consistent options. Things run out or are made on different schedules so I miss out on some of my favorite foods. I love On-The-Go at Ford and the various mini-marts like in Tarkington, very useful. However, very overpriced. I love our dining facilities and options! I love the dining courts and all the options. Compared to other schools, our dining courts are amazing. But I think on-the-go is a rip off and try to avoid it. I LOVE THE DINING COURTS!!! I love the extended hot food hours at On-the-Go. I love the food and on-the-go is a great option for students. I love the variety of food offered at willeys I love the variety of food options. Not always do I have time to eat at the dining court, nor want to. On-the-Go is a great option for the hour break in between classes or if you don&apos;t have time. The Markets are very nice too for when you are too busy to eat supper that night and can head over there to get something, or if you just want a later night food run or want to cook something on your own for a change. I love the vegetarian options. Wish more nutritional facts/info was available though! I miss dining court food, and the variety of fresh fruits and veggies it provided. I think On the go is a good idea, and I used it when in a pinch, but I don&apos;t think it should be a meal swipe, I think each item you purchase should cost a set number of dining dollars. I feel this way because you get 5 items. They give out sunbelt granola bars, and gogurt, and single serving cereal bars. A sunbelt granola bar is 50 cents, and getting 5 costs a meal swipe ($8). That is ridiculous. Same with gogurt. There are more than 5 in a box, which itself costs about $2-3. There is no reason for Purdue to rip its student off like this. I realize what I am suggesting is very similar to Boiler Crossing or Boiler Junction, but the difference I see between the mini-marts and on-the-go is the quality of food. Boiler Crossing and Boiler Junction offer snacky junk foods, while the on-the-go&apos;s revolve more around a meal, and their items are often healthier choices. Perhaps a way to make on-the-go more of a value for students would be to offer that day&apos;s dining court options in to-go containers. That way, students don&apos;t have to worry so much about cost differences and getting ripped off. i miss this so much not being in the dorms! I really like having the option of on the go and the retail operations in addition to the dining courts. If I am in a hurry, these are better for me to use. I REALLY REALLY wish Windsor would still have breakfast in the dining court!!!!!!!!!!!! I really the variety of food on campus. I wish the On the Go places would have some more variety. I still don&apos;t understand why we cannot use our meal swipes for other students. I&apos;m going to use all of my meals regardless of if it is swiping in a friend or using up the extra meals at on-the-go. I still love visiting the dining courts whenever possible. My friends and I also frequently used the other options available to eat meals and feed ice cream cravings. I think Indian food should also be served in the dining courts so that there is diversity from all around. I think our dining halls are exceptional I think Purdue has the best set-up and food options of all the colleges I have visited. I think swipes should be able to be used for guests, so extra swipes aren&apos;t just wasted. Swipes should last the whole semester- some weeks I want to go over on swipes, other weeks I have extras. Windsor Dining Court should open for breakfast and weekends! I think that the dining halls need to focus more on healthy eating habits by accomandating to all varieties of students. Such as, students who are veggies, or vegans. Also, I think that more healthy food needs to be available and not have almost everything fried. And salad bars are not the only healthy thing. How about veggie chx-in patties or nuggets, more sides like this still provide the good taste of eating a hamburger or chicken patty without the frying and grease, more baking. I think that the dining options are too time constricting. It would be nice if at least one on the go was open until 10 or 11. I think that the hours should be more widespread. For example during the week have some places open for breakfast from 930-11am. Also,dining courts should be open for dinner on Sundays. Meal swipes should be allowed to be carried over instead of a &quot;use them or lose them policy&quot;. This is a bad policy, especially during finals week when you could be done with exams before using up all your meal swipes. I think that the On the Go needs to have more of a variety of options to choose from. With the meal plans, we are spending roughly seven to eight dollars a meal swipe, and we are only choosing about two to three dollars worth of food. I do not go to On the Go that often because of the way that the University is not giving us our money&apos;s worth. I think that there&apos;s a great variety of dining options, which is good, since my schedule changes a lot week-to-week. I use On the Go every Monday through Friday. I used on the go more often 4 years ago, and the variety has not changed much. I like that there are hot sandwiches and soup available, but I think there could be more of a variety in snacks. We need healthier choices. I used to love the dining halls! I still miss them and the different varieties they offer. I also really liked being able to meet up with friends from other halls in the dining courts. I was disappointed because I have celiac and when I was in the residence halls I did not have many dining options. Additionally, Earhartt added gluten free pizza and I did not know until a dining hall worker in my major told me about it. They need to publicize dining options more for people with allergies. I was dissatisfied with the amount of healthy options at on-the-go. I was very sad when the Tarkington dining court closed. Lots of good memories! I wish On the Go stayed open through dinner and on the weekends I wish OTG wasn&apos;t such a rip-off. Very low value for high cost. Even some of the student food service workers said so. I wish that On The Go had better hours and that the Griffin Express were still open. I wish the dining halls were open at different times so there was access to at least one dining hall almost all the time instead of having stardard hours for all dining halls I wish there had been more options at on the go and that it was more equal to the amount of food you could get at traditional. Not EXACTLY equal, but I always felt there was a big difference and that On The Go could sometimes be a rip off of a meal swipe. I wish there was a dining option that was not &quot;all-you-can-eat.&quot; Otherwise, the dining courts are wonderful. I wish On-the-Go would change up the items they offer more often. I wish there was just one place open after midnight where I could use dining swipes instead of dining dollars. I work late a lot. I wish there was more variety in On The Go. I wish there were a way in On-the-Go to donate funds or products to a hunger relief organization if I would like. I do not want to waste my meal swipes, but I also do not feel as if On-the-Go has sufficient options considering the price of a meal. I wish there were a wider variety of fresh fruit. I wish there were more healthier options available. I feel as though all cooked vegetables were cooked in butter and things could have been done to make the current food healthier. I wish there were more retail operation locations. I would use them a lot more if there was one located near Lilly or the Union. I have heard this from a lot of people. I wish we could use more dining dollars at the Union. I wish Windsor was open for breakfast and on the weekends. Wiley really needs to improve. The tables are always dirty and the staff is very unfriendly. A far cry from Windsor :( I wish you could use swipes to get people into the dining courts, and I wish there was a to-go option where you could get hot food from the dining courts and take it to go. I would appreciate more gluten-free and special diet items in the dining halls, on-the-go, retail operations, etc. I would like on-the-go spots on campus, like in the union. It was hard to come all the way back to my res. hall to get some chips and a drink, especially when I had to be on campus all day (which were times when I needed on-the-go more than ever). I would like to be able to use meals swipes at Harrison Grill. I would like to be able to use more dining dollars at the Union than we are currently able to. I would like to see a court open 24 hrs a day. I would like to see more all natural, vegan, and healthier foods I would like to see more options for the use of the meal swipe. Perhaps there can be a grab bag available for one meal swipe in Boiler Crossing and Boiler Junction. That would be for the people who have missed on-the-go and the dining hours. Also, that wouldn&apos;t be wasting the meal swipes the WE DON&apos;T GET BACK. Wasted. I would like to see more vegetarian and vegan items. I would love to see Windsor open again on the weekends or for breakfast. I would prefer more homestyle meal options. Some dining halls seem to specialize on foreign foods too much. I would put an on-the-go on the academic campus. I&apos;m sure this would get used all the time! I&apos;d like On the Go to be open later, especially on Fridays I&apos;m glad I&apos;m no longer in the dorms- it was much better &quot;back in the day&quot; when you didn&apos;t have to leave the building you lived in to get something to eat!! I&apos;ve been in the halls for 4 years now, so while the food is great, my satisfaction wanes the longer I eat it. Everything is starting to taste the same. In on-the-go, PLEASSEE get sugar free apple sauce if it&apos;s not that much more expensive. And, fruit shouldn&apos;t be a side. In the dining courts we can take a piece for free, so why can&apos;t we in on-the go?? In the harvest months, I&apos;d like to see local produce! With Purdue&apos;s &quot;greening&quot; efforts, greening our food should also be a priority! In the winter it isn&apos;t as easy to go to other dining courts other than what&apos;s closest to my dorm and they tend to have to same meal choices over and over. Also, the amount of grease in most of the selections upsets my stomach. Instead of traditional meal plans that expire at the end of fixed meals a week, there should be only Dining dollars for use, which expire at the end of the year. Is there a retail operation service? It gives other options when you don&apos;t have time to either go or eat in the dining courts and I really liked that It has been more frustrating this year not having some of the dining halls(Windsor) open for breakfast and having some of the dining halls completely closed during the weekend. One of the reason I chose to live in Windsor was because there was a dining hall attached but it hasn&apos;t been very convenient this year due to it being closed so often. It is important to always have a healthy options at the dining courts. it is not conveninet for no meal plan in hawkins. it is not fair that i can only use 25 of my dining dollars at the Union. They are my dollars that I am paying for I should be able to use as many of them at any of the restaurants that i can choose from whenever I want to. Also, i should be able to use MY meal swipes that I pay for to swipe in anyone! The meal is being paid for by MY swipe, so why can&apos;t I use MY swipe for anyone that I want? It is very bland to eat the same 5 choices week to week. It seems like a lot of variety at first, but it gets repetitive real quick. It seems like there are quite a few dining options. I really like On the Go especially Grandma Vi! It seems that selection is really bad when a break is coming up. It should not be mandatery for residences to buy meal plans It would be great if On the Go was open just a little later in the evening. It would be great if Windsor was open on the weekends. It would be nice if meal swipes could be used for guests It would be nice if meals cost less, so we wouldn&apos;t feel obligated to eat so much. It would be nice if on the go was open on the weekends. Also, I was extremely disappointed to find that some dining halls are closed on the weekends, it is very inconvenient. It would be nice if swipes could be used for guests, and if students could pay at On the Go with a debit or credit card. It would be nice if the menu could match was a place was serving. It would be nice if there were more healthy choices for On-The-Go, and if the cafes etc. in the academic buildings were cheaper for food. It would be nice if we could get take home boxes for the dining courts, so that if we were in a hurry, but didn&apos;t want food from on-the-go, we could fill a certain sized box and cup with food from the dining court. They do this at University of Indianapolis It would be nice to have an On-The-Go open for a while on saturday It would be nice to have healthier options in the dining courts, such as grilled chicken or pasta that hasn&apos;t been soaked in butter. It would be nice to have more on the go locations. It&apos;s a little pricey It&apos;s kind of hard being a farm boy to be satisfied with non home cooked food. It&apos;s very nice. Wish there was more healthy options at on the go. Kind of expensive. later running / longer hours for on the go would be beneficial Liked Cary Quad dining hall better than the current options. lines are too long outside in the cold. Lived in the res halls for 3 years - didn&apos;t see much change in the menu over that time - would be good to introduce some new foods every once and while. Long lines are an issue especially when visiting some some dinning courts due to there food being better if all dinning courts offered the same quality of food people wouldn&apos;t crowd some dinning courts while others are left with no lines. Also longer hours of operation or more choices when it comes to on the go dinning would help when multiple exams fall on the same night. It can be difficult to study go to exams and find a place to eat when multiple exams fall on the same night on the go bein open till 5 or later could help Long time ago Love it. LOVE IT. really wish it was open to everyone. Or maybe seniors had their own food court. MMM LOVE on the go! Love on the go. Very convenient. Love the dining courts. Great food and lots of variety Love the food! Loved it so much I gained 85 pounds my freshman year. LOVED on the go Loved OTG and the all you can eat format. There were many easy options for dining and the food quality is great! Loved the dining halls. Only complaint was guests not being able to easily come but I believe that has been fixed. Also, hours are sometimes hard to make when people have exams or other activities so maybe a smaller break between lunch and dinner. LOVED THE FOOD!!!!! Loved the On-The-Go and retail. Made getting lunch/dinner easy if you were too busy to sit down. Loved the res hall food. DONT CHANGE Making us tie money up in overpriced stores like the Boiler Crossing is gipping us. There should be meal plans that do not include dining dollars. In addition, it should NOT cost us more to live out of a tiny dorm room than to have an entire apartment. Something about the current system needs to be changed even if that means going back to cafeteria style dining where everyone is only given a limited quantity and selection of food. Many different dining courts to choose from and many choices within each court. The on the go is convienent! The restaurants, howerver, are a bit pricy and the food marts are incredibly expensive. Many of the On the Go places are very cramped and hard to get through when not completely empty Many students have long days with scattered classes. Having &quot;on the go&quot; open until only 4:30pm does not help if you get home at 5:00pm. Also there should be a wider variety of food offered in the dining courts. markets are way too expensive mccutcheon did not have a dining hall which sort of frusterated me, and the only close one was earhart and hillenbrand (which closed half the year) and when weather was not good it was really annoying having to walk or wait on a bus to go anywhere good... but the others like ford were amazing!!! Me: You should have at least one open until somewhere around 10 o&apos;clock. You: Something to the point that it can&apos;t be done economically. Me: you raised my rates, you ***. meal plans are way too expensive Meal plans should not be forced to have. Meal swipes should be able to be used for guests. This is a scam. Meal swipes should be transferrable (i.e. swiping in a friend using a meal instead of dining dollars). Meal swipes should not expire at the end of each week. It is the student&apos;s money. The meals should roll over at the end of each week and at the end of a semester, if there are meal swipes left, the student should get that money back. Meals are rather expensive. The red potato salad from On-the-Go was amazing, but they do not offer it anymore. More choices at on-the-go! More Dining Dollars are needed for places like the Union, a greater selection is needed in On the Go, and perhaps something could be done to allay the feeling that I get ripped off monetarily every time I use On the Go. More focuses needs to be given to local produce particularly diversification of vegetarian, free-range (non-CAFO) meat, and organic options More gluten free options more healthy options to choose from please More hours for On-the-Go! More Indian food More nutritional information and healthy options at On the Go are needed. More on the go options, such as hot lunches on the go. More open hours at all the dining courts. more options more out-of-dining-court options More than $25 dining dollars should be available to be used at retail locations. On the go needs more variety. On the go is not worth 1 meal swipe More unhealthy options than healthy options when I lived in the dorms More variety at a specific dinning court. more variety at on the go More Variety at On the Go please. More variety at on the go would be nice. More variety of food menus is encouraged. More variety. N/A N/A N/A n/a N/A N/A Need a way to move lines more efficiently need dining on campus since you can only spend 25 in the union and stewart Need later dining options. Need more filling foods at On-the-Go and less junk foods. Mini-marts are way over priced. Need More Healthy options having only one vegatable at a dining courts is not good Need more options at on the go Need more options at On-the-Go. Also, I feel like the prices at Meredith Mart and Tark Mart are totally jacked up. need more retail operations, and less emphasis on traditional dining options. need more variety between halls need more variety in the dining courts on a day to day basis. serving the same thing for lunch and then dinner is really annoying. Need to offer healthier or at least more non-fatty foods. The dining courts offer some of the greasiest food I have ever seen. needs more variety for breakfast in &quot;on the go&quot; also longer hours. my classes ended when it was already closed. Needs more vegan options, better labeling of animal products and allergens Needs more Vegetarian options Nice facilities. No dining hall options on the academic campus, meaning lunch is a major time commitment to walk to a dining hall and back. All the options are super expensive. I don&apos;t need all-you-can eat every meal of the day. No facilities in grad house none none none none None Not a huge variety in food selection and it would be nice to know what was on the menu before i show up there Not enough variety and On The Go provides too few healthy foods. Not in the dorms anymore and I miss the food. not many choices.. should lower the minimum price. Too expensive. Not very nutritious foods. I&apos;m vegan/vegetarian and there are not many varieties of fresh fruits and vegetables that I like to eat and i don&apos;t eat all of the junk food on the go and dinning courts should be open later. it is often hard to eat if you have night exam on the go and retail are far overpriced for the options provided On the Go could have more options, but other than that I think that dining options are pretty great compared to other universities. on the go could use more variety On the Go doesn&apos;t have all that much healthy variety. On the go doesn&apos;t usually offer very good main dish options. / The food in the dining courts is usually good but it gets old and isn&apos;t always well kept. On the Go food options were pretty mediocre, but the actual dining halls themselves were very good I thought. Much better than others schools at least, I&apos;ve heard. Perhaps emphasize the salad bar! On the go has excellant food and whoeer makes the sealed food items should receive praise and rewards On the Go is a bit sketchy in terms of amount of food for the price we pay for it. On the Go is a complete and utter rip-off. The food offered is bland, cheap, and NOT worth what I paid for my dining meal plan. On the Go is a complete rip off, its disgusting. $8 for 5 things that I can go buy for 33 cents each? Terrible, just absolutely terrible. Its insulting. On the Go is a great idea. very good variety in the dinning courts On the GO is a great way to rip off a poor college student by selling them one sandwich and four chips for one swipe. On the go is a must and dining dollars are also a must as well. Dining court variety is good, but the distribution is not. I think double swipe meals (such as steak or seafood) should also be available at Erhart or Hillenbrand. On the go is a rip off! On the go is a rip off. Don&apos;t get enough for what you pay for. on the go is a rip off. meal plans are expensive, on the go should offer a lot more. dining court hours are horrible. On the Go is a rip-off. The items we&apos;re getting can&apos;t cost the school more than $4 or $5 and yet we&apos;re paying over $7 for it. I think that&apos;s ridiculous. On the go is a very good idea, but the options are generally the same and after the first month of school the options begin to get old. I would prefer to see more healthy snack items as opposed to chips, donuts, and ding dongs. It would be nice to have an on the go closer to where the classrooms are. On the Go is a waste of money, but it&apos;s the only option when you&apos;re starving and the dining courts are closed. And, we need a 24/7 dining court option. On the go is an absolute rip off, and the university should be ashamed. There should be better food, or more items to choose from. / / For example, a box of pop tarts at Walmart is about $1.50. Using an entire meal swipe for 5 things of poptarts comes to about 8-10 dollars. On the Go is awesome!! I don&apos;t know what I would do without it some days. On the go is awful. The quality of the sandwhiches is appalling, why can&apos;t you even try? I would rather have fewer items per swipe if they are better quality, and you can only go up from what is offered on the go is genius definitely a winner On the Go is great - but, I think you should be able to use your swipes to swipe in friends instead of having to use dining dollars. on the go is great and should be available on weekends as well because students are busy not only during the school week On the Go is great when you don&apos;t have enough time to eat in the dining halls On The Go is great, but it would be nice if there were more fruit options (such as pears, blueberries, plums, strawberries, ect.) instead of just apples, oranges, and bananas. The same goes for the dining courts. On the Go is just as expensive as the traditional eat-all-you-can buffets in each dining hall, even though the food is a billion times worse and can only grab 5 items. On the Go is kind of a rip-off. You don&apos;t get much for how much each meal swipe costs. On the Go is not open on the weekends, which is the most important time. Also, I&apos;m paying for meals I can&apos;t use. I need the equivalent to &quot;roll-over minutes.&quot; Meals that don&apos;t dissappear at the end of the week. on the go is not worth a meal swipe. it needs more value and healthier options. On the Go is not worth a whole swipe, which makes no sense. And unused swipes should turn into dining dollars or something. We pay enough for all that food, we should be able to get at least most of our money&apos;s worth back. on the go is over priced. On The Go is the Best! On the go is the best. Consider more of them around campus. / / Also, consider an on-the-go type thing ON campus (that uses the Dining Dollars) for those of us with a full day of class so I dont have to come all the way back. On the Go is the greatest thing about the dining halls. On the Go is very poor. It rips off students and is not worth the 9 dollars that a meal swipe. On the Go is WAY OVERPRICED! 1 swipe is worth way more than 5 items, Harrison Grille and Cary Knight Spot should be open more during the day, for lunch On the go menu seems too limited. On the go needs some different options. They should change variety more frequently and add healthier options On the go needs to have extended hours on the go not open during the weekends... / retail places have really high prices... / only $25 of dining dollars can be used at the Union... On The Go on the weekends would be nice, and atleast one 24/7 residence hall... On the go seems like a rip off, one meal swipe gets you as much as u want at the dining halls but I am usually still hungry after i eat at one the go On the Go should allow us to take actual food instead of chips and stuff. We should be able to take a to go box into the dining court and get a meal to take with us. I am tired of eating cheese burgers everyday because I don&apos;t have enough time to eat a regular lunch. On the go should be extended until 5. On the go should be open a little later (at least until 5) because students who had class until late but had an early exam had to go without dinner from the dining court. Also, I feel Windsor and Hillenbrand should alternate being open on weekends or like one on Saturday, one Sunday. On the go should be open for a few hours on the weekend. on the go should be open late especially on fridays On the Go should be open until Saturday as well. It will be more convenient for students. Not all day, but just the few hours the dining opens during weekends. On the Go should extend its hours by 15 minutes to half an hour. It is impossible to make it back from campus after a 3:30 class to get last second stuff for the night. On the go should have better options and more fufilling foods. On the go should have healthier options that are more like the &quot;warm&quot; meals. Why isn&apos;t there freshly made wraps or sandwhiches (but only packaged?). Also, a greater variety of fruits and veggies would be nice. Also, when you only get 5 items for one meal swipe (worth roughly 8 dollars in the courts), it seems a little discouraging to use on the go. More food items per swipe seems logical. On the Go should have more options and allow the student to &quot;buy&quot; things equivalent to the amount of one meal. Many times it is obvious that the items a student &quot;buys&quot; at On the Go would regularly cost under $5 and is not equal to the cost of a meal in the dining court. On the Go should have more options that make it worth whatever it costs for a swipe On the Go should have more variety. Also they should be open on the Saturdays!!!!! On the go should offer more options On The Go ***...the food options are incredibly limited and most options are just junk or snack food...maybe that&apos;s the whole idea of it, but it would be awesome to get more substantial meals from On The Go...mac and cheese from the dining court thats sold at On The Go, for example, would be an awesome addition On the Go tends to be too highly priced for the lack of choices and for the inexpensive items offered as one item. On the go was great On the Go was great. On to Go is a joke. Its ridiculous that its the equivalent of a meal at the food court. Also, our swipes should most definitely carry over week to week, and should be able to be used for other people. WE paid for them. It should be up to us as to when and how we used them. On-the-Go could provide more healthier snack options On-the-Go could use some more variety On-the-Go is a complete rip off, it should be more like it was before the big dinning courts, when you could take real food out with you...maybe changing the OTG to a place where you could get real food instead of junk worth WAY LESS than a swipe. Ford is incredibly stingy, I was talking a cookie (one cookie) out and was told to take a bite out of it before I left, ridiculous. On-the-Go is a complete rip off, the cost of the convenience is too high. It takes at least three swipes worth of food at on-the-go to rival the amount I usually eat at the traditional dining courts. On-the-go is a great idea. On-the-go is a really nice option. The dining courts have a nice variety and selection, but the system of swipes that expire each week is inefficient and wasteful. On-the-go is a waste of money. If I&apos;m paying $8-$9 for a meal swipe and use a swipe at on-the-go, I&apos;ve wasted that money essentially. The items in on-the-go don&apos;t cost very much, don&apos;t have too much variety, and five items does not make a great lunch. On-the-go is not worth an entire meal swipe, or allow people to get more items per meal swipe. Another option is have take-out boxes and allow people to fill up the box in the dining court and use that as an on-the-go swipe. On-the-go is amazing. On-the-Go is not enough food for a meal swipe. And where can I use my 125 dining dollars to buy coffee at 6AM? And why can&apos;t smoothies be sold late at night. Smoothies are excellent study snacks. Carbs for ***! on-the-go is overpriced On-the-go is really over priced. on-the-go is useless if your a vegetarian. there is no real main meal, just a bunch of salty, sugary sides On-the-go needs more variety because when you need it, you don&apos;t want it, because you are sick of the food there. On-the-Go needs to be open MUCH more. Also, I really miss having smaller dining halls in each residence. Finally, I think that building of Wiley Dining Hall was rather unplanned in terms of size. The dining hall itself is huge, but there aren&apos;t many seats available. I almost always have to wait for a table! on-the-go or other &quot;swipe&quot; based dining options on campus. also, better pricing for retail operations. On-the-go should be open longer hours On-the-go should have a more fair dollar or point system since 5 fruit roll-ups are the same price as 5 more expensive items, for example. On-the-go&apos;s does not have many healthy options. The dining halls could use some change in terms of their food and try to serve healthier breakfast, instead of a lot of eggs and bacon. On-the-gos should give more value for our money. The retail options seem over priced as well. Also, having extended friday hours or limited weekend hours for on-the-go&apos;s would be helpful. over priced overall i think the dining facilities are fantastic. my only complaint is that the sandwiches at on the go are sort of gross, so the options there are then somewhat limited Overall, too expensive for students. Overpriced for those paying cash. Pepsi products also! Please provide more choices for people not from US, i.e. International Students. please we shud be allowed to take other people on our meal swipes we pay for it why cant y decide who shud use it or not POOR VALUE. Students should not be forced into these plans. It would be loads cheaper form me to just pay the $7.50 whenever i want a meal becasue when you do the math my plan charges over $10 per swipe and i can loose them ect. I feel that the dining services on campus are nice, BUT VERY EXPENSIVE Price is way too high. Prices are high per meal. I believe there should be an option for students to be in the university residences without having university dining. Prices are way marked up. Meal swipes are a complete rip off. You shoudl at least be able to use the swipes you paid for for a friend if you aren&apos;t going to use them yourself. Prices at the retail operations are ridiculous, and are preying on students who do not have transportation to stores with better value. Provide graduate student with meal plan option too. Purdue defiantly has the best food options of any college I have visited Purdue Dining Halls need to offer more &quot;normal&quot; food. When all they offer is peanut butter and jelly hamburgers and hummas, students end up not getting anything to eat. Purdue dining is extremely convenient (as is on-the-go), but sometiems it seems that the quality of food is not up to par with the cost. For $8-10 I would expect more fresh fruit at on-the-go, and larger sandwiches. For those of us using on-the-go as a meal on a busy day, the 5 item limit often doesn&apos;t meet our caloric needs in a healthy way. Purdue dining is one of the best choices I have seen from various other universities I have been to. Just need to allow using meal swipes on strangers instead of dining dollars. Purdue dining is out of this world fantastic! I miss eating in the dorms the food was so good! Keep up the good work in this area! Purdue has great food! Purdue has the best dining courts of any school i have been to. Purdue has top of the line dining services.Keep up the good work. Purdue is taking us for our money in every way possible regarding food services on campus. The amount we pay for food is ridiculous, which could be understandable because of the need for such variety. However, I don&apos;t feel that we get the quality of food that we have paid for. On-the-go is often necessary because of time constraints students face and is an even bigger rip-off than the daily meals in the dining courts. How much does Purdue pay for bags of chips or lunch meat to make sandwiches? At the approximate rate of ten dollars per meal, we are essentially paying TWO DOLLARS for a 25 cent or less bag of chips that Purdue has bought in bulk, probably at an even lesser cost than mentioned above. If the entering students at this university spent less time trying to fit into their social molds, they would do this calculation themselves, have a heart attack from the mere shock, and never visit on-the-go again. Though the retail operations like boiler crossing are convenient and helpful, the prices we are paying for everyday items that Purdue (again) has bought at a ridiculously cheap rate leave me feeling as though I have been raped of my hard-earned money. It&apos;s no wonder that college students are poor. I was also disappointed this year when I arrived to live in Hillenbrand. After paying extra money for an upper-class residence hall with a newly-renovated dining court, I expected to have the time to eat a convenient breakfast by simply walking downstairs. This perk would make the elimination of Griffin Express well worth it. However, only brunch is served at hillenbrand, and only on weekends. Being that the food at Hillenbrand is often sub-par to other nearby competing dining halls, I hardly consider the brightly colored chairs and &quot;cool&quot; designs enough of a perk to make living here any better than someplace cheaper. In addition to these issues, I have been dissatisfied with the service at the dining halls on several occasions. When dipping a ladle for loaded potato soup one day, I could not retrieve a single potato while scraping at the bottom of the pan. I politely asked the woman working behind the counter if there was more soup because she had seen me scooping for potatoes that clearly weren&apos;t there. Her response as she looked into the full container of cheesy broth was, &quot;Oh, there&apos;s plenty there.&quot; Then she proceeded to lean forward as if telling me a secret and added, &quot;There aren&apos;t many potatoes in the rest of it either.. heh heh.&quot; I couldn&apos;t help but be bothered by the fact that she thought this was funny. I understand that as college students we will not be treated like royalty here, but I find it bothersome to pay for a meal and get nothing for my money. If I had paid money at some fast-food restaurant, I find it hard to believe that someone would laugh in my face and be okay with the service if I did not get the food that I paid for. I don&apos;t think the dining courts should be any different. Perhaps they should be reminded that we are just the same as paying customers and it is their job to provide us with the food we are paying for each and every day. Purdue needs to do a better job of providing options for people with special diets or allergies. Purdue residence halls have great food. Nice variety and quality! purdue should allow more than just 25 dollars of the 200 something dollars that are part of the dinning dollars. i have had to unnessacrily open up a boiler exprexx account and pay money when i have 150 or so dinning dollars that i would be happy to use at the pmu restaurants. Put new stuff in on-the-go! And Ford is getting old. Quality appears to be slipping over the past 2 years. REally freakin&apos; good Residence Hall food is delicious. I gained 25 lbs. retail is way too expensive Retail only. Retail Operations need restructuring; Purdue needs to develop a way to integrate private, close-to-campus restaurants into its dining options system by allowing students to use &apos;dining dollars&apos; at nearby private locations. Retail operations should be much cheaper. same as above comment Should be able to use more of the meal plan on campus. Should be allowed to use extra swipes for other people including family members. Should be closer to class buildings Should have more working hours for on the go. Significant improvement over the years since I started as an undergrad Since the question asked if I &apos;ever&apos; applied for housing, I answered yes. This was the first time I attended Purdue in 1987. Some food was very cheap and bad tasting. Some of the dining halls don&apos;t have a lot of variety with their meals. Some of the most disgusting, low-grade food I have eaten in my life and I have eaten a lot of bad food. Sometimes overly crowded. Sometimes sits are not enough for people attending restaurants Sometimes the hours offered are inconvenient and don&apos;t coincide with my breaks in classes, and occasionally menus seem to lack variety from week to week, which can make dining appear unappetizing. Sometimes there isn&apos;t much of a good variety of food and after a while the food gets old. Especially in on-the-go. I also believe it is overpriced especially at the marts. Specific dining courts serve more appealing food than others, which is why they are usually the most crowded. If the university would spread out the appeal of food crowds would be more tame. For example, few of the people I know who live in Hillenbrand actually like eating there, they would rather make a trip over to Earhart. Stop repeating food daily Students should be allowed to take food from the dining courts. All the food gets thrown out anyway, so there is no point in wasting good food when people are wanting to take it with them! Swipes should be interchangable with dining dollars so that neither are wasted. The amount of food available for 1 swipe from on the go is not enough to make up for the 9 dollar amounts that the swipe costs. The best food in the WORLDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The current swipe process needs to change. They either need to roll over or have the ability to be used on others, even if you were only allotted 10 per semester to be used on others.  / Wiley and Windsor need to figure out their seating during rush periods. It is absolutely ridiculous at 12:30 and at 5:30. When we pay as much as we do for meal plans, we should be able to sit while we eat. The dining courts are amazing in terms of choice and quality. However, the food is occasionally cold. On the Go has improved from last school year in terms of some of the choices, but I feel like I am getting ripped off for the cost of one swipe. Also, On the Go always seems very busy and crowded. the dining courts are ENTIRELY TOO CROWDED. there are never enough tables and the lines are always extremely long. The dining courts are fantastic. However, since dining swipes disappear at the end of the week, students are forced to use leftovers on on the go, which is the biggest rip off I&apos;ve ever partaken in. It ends up being an 8+ dollar swipe that gets a person around a buck&apos;s worth of food. Also, I would appreciate some sort of option to use swipes at local retail operations such as subway or papa johns. The dining halls are a major selling point to new students coming to campus. I believe we have some of the finest dining facilities in the country. Please keep up the good work with those dining halls! The dining halls are fine. The prices are getting quite a bit too expensive compared to just eating out. My main complaint, though, is On the Go. Everything there is a complete rip-off. There is no way 5 items will cost you even half of the price of a swipe. They need to supply better quality food there, or put in another swipe system where each On the Go swipe equates to less monetary value. The dining halls are great, On the Go would be nice if the hours were better, and the retail operations seem pretty overpriced. The dining halls are great! The Dining options are fantastic! The dining options at Purdue are fantastic. The dining options for students who live off-campus are VERY expensive. The dining options is one of the best things I&apos;ve experienced at Purdue. The dining options Purdue offers is great The food at Purdue is great. It is the one thing that I miss now that I live off campus. The food at the on-the-go is terribly over priced and the retail operations aren&apos;t that much better. The food gets old quick, and it isn&apos;t of as high of quality as would be expected for the price we pay. Especially the fruit. The fresh fruit is quite consistently of poor quality. the food got repetitive The food here is great, even my friends at IU agree and they love to hate Purdue The food here is great! My friends at other universities are jealous. The food is amazing! the food is awful. there is no variety. The on the go options are a joke, no bang for our buck. the food was so bad, my freshman year I lost 20 lbs rather than gained 15. The food is extremely greasy in the dining courts, and On The Go should bring back their meal size salads. The food is good and convient, but the On the Go is expensive for what you get. The food is good. It would be nice if the dining courts could stagger their lunch hours so that I could have more flexibility in my schedule. The food is great!!!! The food is not always the healthiest. I went to Ford dining court most of the time. On the go was very unhealthy and did not give an appropriate portion of food for one swipe. the food is not healthy at all. sometimes there are long lines. The food selection here at Purdue is FANTASTIC. Friends from other colleges have commented on the variety, taste, and value. The food services at Purdue are wonderful. No one can go hungry! The food was far from tasty. There were practically the same, unhealthy, over salted options every day. The &quot;salad&quot; material often looked like it was at the edge of rotten. And have you ever calculated the costs? $8 per meal. That is way too much money to pay for a sub-par meal that has been claimed as &quot;world class&quot;. The hours for the dining courts and on-the-go can be inconvenient. the hours of the food counts need to be extended. The main reason that I&apos;m moving off campus next semester is the sheer price of the meal plan. I do not feel like I should required to pay for something that I do not want. On the Go is convenient but also possibly the largest scam that I have been apart of. $9 for a sandwich (a small one at that) and four sides? The meal plans are too expensive (up to $13 or so per meal on a 10 meal plan) and there are rarely any new options. After 3 years the food is getting really boring. The meals are a rip off. The 10 meal plan costs over $12 per meal, but if you don&apos;t have a meal plan and just pay by card it is like $9. This is taking advantage of the students. Also there should be an option to have no meal plan at all the residences. The meals are way too expensive, and there needs to be more FRESH natural options in on the go The mean plans that allow meal-swipes to expire at the end of the week are absolutely unacceptable for the amount of money each on costs. At IU, meal points never expire after you&apos;ve purchased them. They even roll over from semester to semester. This is a much more fair and ethical system. The menus never change. Same old menus years on... The merchandise at the stores like BoilerCrossing is vastly overpriced. The mini marts (boiler crossing, tarkington market) are very convienent but wayy to expensive. The mini-marts are way too expensive. I&apos;d rather go to a real store and spend real money cause everything costs much less. But the selection you have is great. The On the Go closed too early to be completely beneficial the on the go items are a bit cheap for a meal swipe The on the go products should be an equal value to what it costs to eat within he dining court. The On-The-Go locations need more variety. The retail operations charge way too much. The on-the-go options are overpriced since they cost the same as a swipe for the regular dining hall but you get so much less. The only benefit of living in the residence halls. Great food choices!! The possible use of meal swipes for guests. Also, the implementation for a rollover type feature for the weekly meal swipes; even rolling over for one week would be very beneficial and satisfactory. The prices at Boiler Crossing and Boiler Junction are outrageous. I went to Boiler Crossing the other day, I purchased half a gallon of milk, a box of cereal, and a tiny box of cheese itz and it rang up to be $13. I could have gone to Walmart and bought these for less than $6. At Boiler Crossing a 25 oz. box of Cheese Itz costs $2.50, at Walmart a 60 oz box costs $2.00. I don&apos;t understand how people at Boiler Crossing get away with this price gauging. The retail operations are not really a viable meal alternative because of the prices. It is not worth it to spend money on that, when you can get so little. They are nice to have, but I am not sure that people actually use them in place of meals. They are more of a supplementary snack. The Sunday dining hall hours are not very good, especially not providing dinner. Also, on-th-go would be helpful on Saturday because it&apos;s not always possible to get in on Friday when everyone is trying to use up meal swipes The traditional dining court Windsor is not open for breakfast or on weekends The Union is overpriced. Students should have the option to pick on the go stock just like with Btv the unused meal swipes left out at the end of a week should be either converted into a fixed amount of dining dollars or should be left and not wasted so that the resident can use them any time he/she wants during the semester. The variety in the dining halls is fine, On the Go is very useful, the &quot;convenience&quot; stores are nothing but a ripoff. $4.50 for a half-gallon of milk, no wonder people steal from the dining hall. Also, I much prefer the plans were you put in X dollars, eat by a la carte system, and any remainder is returned at the end of the semester/year. I really enjoyed giving Purdue an extra $100 or so every year because it was my fault I didn&apos;t eat more or buy their overpriced snacks. The variety is nice, but the high price is not. The variety of food is not up to par with other schools and why is everything shrinking. The cups are shrinking, the plates are shrinking, the food is shrinking but then the prices are increasing, not fair to students. There are few options for vegetarians and non-red - meat lovers There are not enough healthy options available in the dining halls. Rarely is there fresh fruit/vegetables. Ford is the only dining court I could even make myself dine at. There are not enough options still. Why do I have to even purchase a mealplan just because I live in the dorm? I could buy and microwave all of my food or use the hall kitchens and it would be a lot cheaper. There need to be more options for meal plans and you should not have to pay a trazillion dollars to eat there. Do you know it costs $10 to eat at the dining court if you don&apos;t have a meal plan? I&apos;m no Newton, but I think that I can tell that the quality of food there is certainly not equal to $10 a meal, plus we pay far more than that for a plan. There are too many swipes. I do not like to be forced to eat. There are very few options for vegans. While a vegetarian may be able to eat a variety of the foods provided, vegans find their options very sparse. The dining halls should expand their options to include many more vegan-friendly choices. Vegan options also tend to be much healthier. There could be more healthy options at on the go. There is always a different option for everyone, no matter what time of day, or day of the week. There is much that could be done to improve small things, such as keeping food warm while it is on the line, and staff friendliness (namely students and 30-40 year old cooks) There need to be better options available for students with restricted diets. Most dining hall workers will provide ingredients in a dish if it is available, but often no ingredients are given and students with allergies face extremely limited options for food and face fears of contamination with buffet style dining. There need to be more healthy options at On the Go. There needs to be a dining court closer and more available to residents of Hawkins Hall There needs to be a larger variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. There needs to be an on the go located directly on campus. All of the on the go&apos;s are by the residence halls. This makes no sense! The reason why it is called on the go, is because us students are on the go and don&apos;t have time to go all the way back to the residence halls just to get food. Many days I go without lunch because I don&apos;t have time to go to the on the go&apos;s because they are all so far from my classes. There should be an On the Go on campus, possibly in the union or stew, so that students do not need to go all the way back to the dining halls to eat at lunch. there should be more availible at on the go for how much we pay per swipe. There should be more dining halls open on the weekend. There should also be longer hours on the on-the-goes There should be more of an ala carte rather than buffet. Since I know that will never happen, our meals should roll over. It&apos;s ridiculous that you lose them if you don&apos;t use them. Perhaps, we should just pay for so many meals and once those run out, we should be able to add more--rather than a set amount per week for the entire semeter. They are stealing our money. There should be more options for the number of meals per week offered. There should be more options. There should be a food service in every dorm whether dining court, on the go, boiler market, I think there should be a place that sells made to order salad or wraps or sandwiches and other food places that you can use your swipes or dining dollars or boiler express for. They could have more of a variety for on-the-go, or at least keep hot sandwich&apos;s in there for longer. They have done a lot with On the Go in the Last two years but I wish that there were a couple more healthy options. I would love to see some more fruit avaiable as well as more vegetables. It would be nice to have a little more variety in the hot choices. They need to keep the things I like. For example, frosted mini wheats and fiber one bars. / / I would recommend a comment board that is visible at each on the go location where students can suggest what they want for options. This could also be set up as a way to evaluate the options at on the go currently. Or you could provide a sheet of options that the students can fill out. Then you would know what a majority of the students would want to have available. They seem to always run out of chocolate milk. They should allow you to pick more options They should allow you to take your dinner to go instead of making you stay at the food court. They should convert unused meal swipes into dining dollars. Things I didn&apos;t like. 1. Closed Sunday Night. 2. You can not use your own swipe for someone else to get into the dining court. This is another reason I am leaving the residence halls. Every time people like something, they take it away. I never see sesame chicken at Earhart anymore, the new spicy chicken stinks, and they took away cheese sticks. I don&apos;t understand why there is always a need for change. I am bored because they have taken away the options. This should be a lot cheaper... Though I am very satisfied with the dining halls, Wiley lacks sufficient seating, and On the Go&apos;s would be better if they had slightly longer hours. times are very restricted To improve the dining options, you should be able to swipe a guest in using your weekly swipes rather than your dining dollars. too expensive Too expensive! Doesn&apos;t the universtiy make enough on tuition? Too expensive. Food elsewhere is cheap in many instances.. Too expensive. It would be interesting to have a dining program to graduate students at Purdue. too pricy too pricy for the quality of food being provided. On-the-go is no comparison to a traditional lunch in amount of food for the price of a meal swipe. Traditional - I understand that there are only so many options, but a little more variety would be nice. The dining hall menus are a great feature. / On the Go- Basically no variety there. I would love it if there were some salads or something other than the Italian Club that I liked from the cold sandwich selection. The chips and side items have good variety though. / Retail - Nice, has all the basics you&apos;d need in my opinion. Traditional is great food by WHY DID THEY CLOSE WINDSOR?! They had the best breakfast. The vegetarian biscuits and gravy is to die for! There isn&apos;t much variety with breakfast (except windsor) and I LOVE breakfast. If only a few halls will be open (understandable) have more food choices available. More vegetarian hot food/sandwiches would be nice in OnTheGo. The veggie sausage/egg/cheese is also awesome. More local or organic foods would be nice, but it&apos;s understood they are expensive, but the environmental commitment by the university would be appreciated. Especially stoney field yogurt. It&apos;s vegetarian, organic, and readily available. Uh, have we heard of different types of food? Like seriously, what about just plain grilled chicken on salad? unhealthy Unlimited use of Dining dollars in retail operations (e.g Amelia&apos;s, Union Restaurants) Unused meal swipes should be converted to dining dollars at the end of the week/month. More than $25 dining dollars should be allowed at non-dining court venues such as at the Union. The amount should be between $50-$75. Variety of Dining Options is good, menu&apos;s seem to stay in the same relative rotation. Vegetarian options are limited. Also, would like to see some service in south-west side of the campus. All eating places are so far away from there. Very expensive and not worth it. very expensive, need more variety to make it worth while. better off eating out and cooking for self Very expensive! Very good, could use a little more variety for on-the-go Very pleased with the dining and on the go. I think the dining services are central to the Purdue experience. Was put on a special diet during 2nd semester... dining options not as wide of a variety for people who have to avoid multiple types of food Way to go! More varieties of soups could be great! We have more options than any other school that I know of. We have some really awesome food at Purdue. I love it and would never want to change it. I really enjoy all of it and wish I had a plan still. We need more healthy options and less fried food. We should be able to use our swipes on other people! We should be reimbursed for the amounts of &quot;swipes&quot; we don&apos;t use during the week. On-the-Go should have more &quot;hot&quot; choices of food. On-the-Go should stay open to at least 5:30, and be open on the weekends. We shouldn&apos;t be limited to just spending $25 at places in the Union. It doesn&apos;t make much sense for us. weird hours and the retail stuff it severely over priced When I resided in my residence hall, I was glad of the option to eat at other residence halls and purchase food from residence hall stores (especially when the dining halls were closed). Why can we only use 25 dining dollars at the Union, The Port, Amelias, etc? Its my money! If you are going to limit the use of it I would rather you scrap dining dollars as a concept completely. Just combine dining dollars and Boiler Express, the fact they overlap is pretty silly. Wiley Dining Court gave me my Freshman fifteen. Wiley dining court is extremely packed at 12:30 and there is absolutely NO line control. They could at least lock one of the doors so that people don&apos;t form lines from either end. Also they should consider adding more tables during the lunch hour rush. Finally, we should really be able to use our swipes to get other people into the dining court if we wanted. windsor needs to serve breakfast. Windsor should be open for breakfast and on weekends. windsor was the best for me being a vegetarian. but i went to ford several times as well, and was satisfied. need more gluten free ice cream dispensers though. Wish there was a larger variety of choices Wish there was an option to make your own sandwich at on the go. Wish there was some place where people could hang out with friends as they eat...without having to swipe in the dining court. Also, more healty choices...egg whites at all dining courts, low-fat dairy items, meat that is lean and not always breaded or fried, items without high-fructose corn syrup, etc... I am moving back into the dorms from an apartment next year, and the food is one of my highest concerns. wonderful Would be nice if hours of some services were extended. Would be nice to not get leftovers from the day before. The &quot;green week&quot; in which we were unable to have lunch trays was overly pathetic and unnecessary, especially at the price students pay to have a dining plan. Would it be possible to have a system that allows me (without a meal plan) to join friends in the dining hall without paying and therefore without eating. Perhaps have a designated location of tables that are accessible by both groups in the dining hall, but only those who paid can re-enter the food areas. Would like better on-the-go selection and less costly dinning hall meals, less food possibly or pay for what you eat. Would like to have a traditional dining court open late, especially on weekends. Would like to see more on-campus options OR an increase in the $25 allowance used at PMU locations. Would like to see more variety in On the Go Would really like to use additional meal swipes to swipe in other people. Would also be great to have one pay-per-item place, as I never eat the $7+ at breakfast. Your meals should roll over from previous weeks. Yum Yummy 

 

 (HFS10) University Residences–Multiple Locations and Differing Menus of the Dining Courts 

 &apos;dining&apos; only has one &apos;n&apos; / was nice to have choices if one menu didn&apos;t seem appealing &quot;Dining&quot; (you misspelled dining) A little overpriced when comparing to other options nearby A lot of menu repetition/cycling. A lot of the food does not seem nutritious and looks very unhealthy. There should be a better quality selection of salad dressings and more to choose from that is not hot food. A lot times the menus aren&apos;t that &quot;different.&quot; After 3.5 semesters, I still can find something I like to eat at one of the dining courts. I really apprecaiate that. After a month, they offer the same food all over again. I know it cheap and easy to make But, even college kids get tired of eating the same food all the time. After several years of eating in the residences, you start knowing what&apos;s &quot;the Monday meal&quot; at all the dining halls. Or that when there are corn dogs, there is also orange chicken. It&apos;d be nice to stagger those things a bit for variety so maybe I can have corn dogs on taco day. Again loved the options. Again, the food is great and the variety between dining courts is awesome All good. All of the courts offer different things, but sometimes the same things are offered everyday and it limits the other dishes from changing more often. All of the food tastes the same. BRING BACK TARKINGTON DINING HALL!!!! All of the menus are basically the same, but there is enough food that I still get that variety. It would be amazing to have a dining court closer to main campus as well because Wiley and Windsor get so crowded during the school day. all the dining courts offer the same food. There is no difference, it is all bad. All the menus are a lot alike, but im not complaining because the food is great. Allows you to go to the dining court with food you want to eat. Although they may have different menus, it&apos;s not like I&apos;m going to walk a mile to go to Earhart when I can just go to Ford. As stated before, the menu is not friendly to those who practice a strictly plant-based diet. Be nice if there were one (dining court/on the go) actually on academic campus so we don&apos;t have to walk nearly as far to eat between classes. Beef and chicken stalk should not be used in vegetarian dishes. Best dinning courts ever. Best food and great variety! best in the country Boot Camp show hall had more diversity Bring back buffalo popcorn chicken to Earhart! Bring back special k red berries! Buffalo Popcorn Fish was amazing! Bring it back! Cost Too Much! Could use a little more variety sometimes, but overall excellent food and choices for meals. I like that each dining court is unique in their menu plan. Could use more healthy foods. Windsor is great, but it is the only one with a specialty salad bar. All the other dining courts specialize in fatty friend foods, pizzas, and high calorie and high carbohydrate snacks could use more healthy options...some i think they think are healthy but i don&apos;t feel like they are at all. windsor is the closest to healthy. Danergous to have so many students (particularly female) forced to walk so far across campus at night. Decent variety if willing to walk a lot from one to the other. Variety within the same dining court week to week is not the best. If visiting the same dining court week after week, the food loses it&apos;s glimmer and taste because it repeats so much. Delicious food! Love it! Delicious. Described previously. different menus are a great idea / i preferred it when there were more dining halls; the few number of dining rooms creates long lines and long wait times for food and seats Dining courts are great. dining courts do have good food Dining is misspelled. dining is spelled wrong in the question Dining... not dinning Even BEtTer Food in the WORLDDDDDDD YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!! (going to Harrison Grille for shakes as soon as Im done with this survey!) Even within the same court there are usually goo options. Every court offers asian cuisine every day, but not everyone enjoys food of that sort, and some days that is all that is offered. Every place is different. excellent Excellent, always. Food can be a little redundant within the dining courts over time. Food is always accessible and delicious. Food is decent but the variety gets old Food is fine, lines are always long. food is great at first but the same thing week after week gets tiring. Food pretty good, variety pretty good, would appreciate different types of fish. Locations fairly diverse. food ***! Food variety and quality was A+ Ford has the same food every day it seems like. Ford is my favorite~! Ford needs to mix it up a bit. Love the multicultural themes offered at Windsor&amp;Hillenbrand. Really miss Tark. It had a bad rep, but was actually pretty good. Ford seriously needs to change up their menus. Give a lot of credits to dinning courts---don&apos;t mind to pay $9 dining there. Just keep making delicious and healthy food good food Good food, just need variety. Good food. Good locations and the staff responds to concerns in a timely manner. good selection Good spread of options. Good Variety good variety of food Good variety of food between the dining courts Great choices. Lots of options. Great food Great job at variety, but would like to see changes in patterns and reptitions of food choices Great locations, excellent menus. Great variety GREAT variety great variety and choices Great variety, good food Great variety. Love all the &quot;make your own&quot; options! Have a dining court or on the go more centrally located on campus for when we don&apos;t have time to eat or at least walk back to the residence hall area. Have not used recently. Have you (enjoyed the varied menus)? Having a dining court closer to campus (especially down by the union and krannert) would be nice. It helps to use dining dollars in the union now, but $25 is not enough. Having different menus is nice. I rarely trake the time to go online and look at the menu for the day however. Perhaps posting it in the exponent? Also, all the locations are by the dorms. It would be nice to have a location on campus. Healthier options for food needed most food cooked in dining halls is highly unhealthy Hillenbrand dining court doesn&apos;t have enough healthy food Hillenbrand may look nicer, but the food still needs to be brought to the level of other halls, or otherwise charge less. hours could be extended. Would like the fiber one bars back at on the go! I am allergic to nuts and am lactose intolerant. I usually don&apos;t have a lot to choose from because a lot of main courses and sides contain cheese. I am always pleased with the choices that are offered. I am very satisfied by the number of dining courts, but it seems like all the courts serve basically the same food. I am very satisfied with the dining courts. I ate and even worked in the dining courts. I won&apos;t complain about the food, I think that we are pretty blessed to be able to get so much. However, the menu is very similar between the dining courts, and could be improved to add a little variety. I believe that multiple locations and differing menus is very important because it gives students many different options of what to eat and where to eat. I believe that Windsor&apos;s food is not up to par with the other dining courts. Also, they have the same lunch and dinner which limits options. I can go wherever to eat depending on my mood. This is awesome! I don&apos;t like that the meal swipes expire after a week, they should roll over until the end of the semester. And we should be able to swipe guests in using swipes and not the dining dollars. I feel each dining court rotates the same menu every two weeks or so. I would like to see more diversity in the meals. I feel like the dining halls serve the same meals over and over again. I feel that menus are recycled continuously, needs to be more nutritious variety I got pretty sick of the predictable 2 week cycle when I had to eat there every day. I have a gluten allergy so it&apos;s somewhat difficult to find different food sometimes. I have commented already on the topic. i have just applied to PV and have not moved yet. so these questions are not relevant to me i like having the menus available online I like having the menus online. I like how dining courts specialize in different areas and have variety every night instead of the same menu everyday. I like that there are multiple dining courts and they have different menus, but from Cary Quad I usually do not have enough time or energy to go anywhere except Ford. I like the menus online / netnutrition should be expanded / / mini marts should have frozen vegetables I like the variety in the different dinning courts. I like the variety of things to eat at different dining courts. I like the variety. I liked being able to go online at look at upcoming menus. It was nice to decide where to eat. i love that the menues are online I LOVE the dining courts! I&apos;ve eaten at other colleges and Purdue&apos;s food is so much better! I&apos;ve also heard from friends at other schools that they do not like their food, but love Purdue&apos;s food. Keep up the good work! I love the dining halls, the food is so good. i love the diversity. keep it up! I love the fact that we don&apos;t just have to eat at one place; we can go to a bunch of different places and get totally different meals. I love the international food selections offered (especially Windsor food court) I love the online calorie counter! I love the online menu. I love the variety of all the dining halls. I love Wiley meat!! Especially the fraldinha beef. So tender and tasty. I loved tark. It was smaller an the food seemed to be cooked in smaller tastey portions. I loved the dining court options when I lived there. I only like Ford. There are a lot of dining courts, but the food selections are poor. I really enjoy the different dining courts except that they are very crowded at times. i tend to go to the same dining hall, but it was nice to be able to look up the menu to see if i wanted to eat there each night. I think that the menus could be varied a little more. I think the options offered by the different dining courts are really great, though of course this variety tends to be limited on weekends since some dining courts are closed or open for different hours. I think there should be more variety. And there should be more food for Catholics on Fridays of lent. I use the online menus. I used them 3 years ago. I usually just stay in my dining hall. I wish hawkins was given a meal plan. The kitchens are horrible and there is often a wait. I wish that some recipes would not remain exclusive to one dining hall. Turkey Tetrazzini is not ever seen outside Earhart. Sad, really. I wish that the Dining Menus posted online would include what that dining court is serving for breakfast, not just lunch and dinner I wish that Windsor Dining hall was opened on the weekends. I wish there was a little more variety leading up to breaks, the cycle of food tends to get monotonous. I wish there was more variety or more things that went together. Sometimes I have a hard time putting a meal together, and I have already figured out the rotations of the menus. Meals aren&apos;t that great if you can&apos;t find anything you like to eat. i would like it if students could vote about what they wanted on the menus. I would love to see more Gluten Free Options, my best friend is allergic to gluten and it is really hard for her to find things to eat. I know she enjoys the gluten free pasta at Wiley, but it gets old after a while. I&apos;m a vegetarian and the options for me were awful! For a month about the only thing I could eat were fried foods such as french fries and it was gross! Salads were not good either. Also a lot of items were not clearly marked whether they were vegetarian, vegan, or had meat in them and not even workers knew the answers. I&apos;m always able to find something I want to eat. Even if it&apos;s just cereal. If you look at the menus, they all basically serve the same thing. Ex. Windsor and Earhart have very similar menus for lunch and dinner on the same days.But not day to day. impressive In 2006/2007, the dining courts had different atmosphere but mostly the same food. It is nice to be able to choose a location to eat based on the online menu and it helps to find what I want to eat and sit more quickly. It is nice to have so many options when deciding what to eat. It is really easy to get to other dining courts and all the food I&apos;ve had seems really good. It is tasty. It seems like a lot of variety at first, but it gets really repetitive and old pretty quick. It seems like the dining courts serve a lot of the same stuff. It makes sense, since the dining courts have to serve a LOT of food, but it gets pretty repetitive. It would be nice if the menus were easier to find It would be nice to get healthier options, particularly in On-the-Go. I&apos;ve had the same turkey and colby jack sandwiches since I was a freshman; now I&apos;m in my 5th year! Please get new sandwiches for On-The-Go! It would be nice to have a larger variety of good food, including appetizing dishes that are healthy like &apos;home cooking&apos; would be. It would be nice to have more options for dining on campus. It would be nice to have a dining court somewhere on campus or at least more mini marts to pick things up at. It would be nice to have more variety over the course of the semester. It&apos;s really nice having the different residence halls, but some of them have basically the same thing, all the time. Breakfast particularly is always the same. It&apos;s really nice that there&apos;s a different style at each dining court. The only problem is that you have to try and eat at specific times at some places in order to avoid the 45 minute line. It&apos;s very good, but sometimes I wish there was a calorie/ingredients intake page for each menu. When I&apos;m eating, I know what it&apos;s called, but I have no idea whats in it. Or how much calories I intake. Its good to know you can actually switch things up. Its great to have the online menus so we know our options and can choose the best. Just make good food. Not necessarily huge variety with all these foods I dont even know how to pronounce like Greek Tomatakia Gemista Me Tyri. Like I said before, there is always a variety. Like I stated, there is variety, but the more appealing options seem to stay at Wiley and Earhart. The appealing options need to spread out amongst all of the dining courts. little variance between the dining courts, no dining courts near campus. Long time ago lots of courts have the same stuff, switch it up Love how each dining court has different staples. Love TarkMart. love that there is a choice about what I want to eat every night. Love the food! Love the variety. LOVE the variety. Make something closer to campus Many of the dining courts serve the same thing Many of the dining halls would have the same menu items within days of each other. Chicken fingers at Ford on Mon. and then Chicken fingers at Wiley on Tues. Many people only go to 1 dining hall that is closest to them but I ventured around. I never looked at the menus. Many times the dining courts have the same types of food-more variety is needed. Also, I do not like it when the same thing available for lunch is what is for dinner. When I do not have an option to go to another dining court, this makes meals monotonous, unappetizing, and boring. Many times, I would look up the menus online to determine where I wanted to eat. I also liked that each of the dining courts had their own specialty or flair to what they served. The variety was wonderful, especially when I was eating in one of the courts for every meal. Maybe even more vegetarian options, or Kosher options on campus for Jewish life and holidays. Menu&apos;s at the different dinning courts seem to be very similar. Menus are great. But why are all meal options located so far away from academic campus? The nearest dining hall is often 5-10 minutes from classes. Menus don&apos;t match what is being served. Menus in the dining halls really *** this semester...the dining courts circulate the same menus for the week. and the variety and quality have really gone down. I eat off campus at least 2 nights a week (excluding sundays) because often there is nothing appealing to eat on the menu. When we have &apos;cultural meals&apos; (mardi gras esp) please bring in someone who knows what they are doin because many of the &apos;specialty&apos; menus are a waste of a meal swipe. Menus need for variety at some locations Menus varied at beginning of the semester but got monotonous after the first month or so. More Gluten free choices in Dining Courts for people who are gluten intolerant. More gluten free options More local, organic produce options please. More ON campus more options. More variety More variety among locations. more Vegan options would be great but overall the food is wonderful! more food options at on the go would also be amazing! Most of the time there is a good variety but every once in awhile for example Windsor will serve eggplant parmagina for lunch and then Earhart will serve it for dinner but I went to Earhart for dinner because I wanted something different from what I had at Windsor for lunch except its not different. Much better than other colleges I&apos;ve visited. My biggest problem with the most recent dining court occurrence would be the elimination of breakfast being served on weekends, and even during the weekday. I think it&apos;s very important to have multiple locations that serve breakfast during the week. I understand that hillenbrand no longer serves breakfast during the week and this was extremely upsetting to me and all of my friends because it was one of our favorite places to go! As I&apos;ll be living in hillenbrand next year I know that this will affect me even more than it does now, as I live in Earhart. In addition, I understand that it would simply be a nuisance to have all of the dining courts open for breakfast on the weekends but reducing it to one!? There should at least be two, if not three dining courts that serve breakfast on the weekends. Major inconvenience. The menu variety is not that large. Windsor is the only dining court that seems to have any major variety in comparison to the rest of the locations. N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A n/a Need more dining courts. Need more food variety/quality Need more healthier options Need more variety and healthier options. need more vegetarian food Need somewhere closer to the academic campus. I don&apos;t live on campus but like to eat at the dining courts, but since they are out of my way, I don&apos;t bother. Need to change the menu more often. It get redundant having the same thing every other week. Need wider variety since you eat there 3 times a day needs more locations on side of academic campus that is away from the majority of the student residences. needs more variaty in menues Needs more menu options. Needs more vegetarian/vegan food new dishes no No complaints whatsoever. No dining hall at/near Hawkins. Very disappointing. none none none none None none not enough healthy food or vegan food not enough healthy or different dietary needs fullfilled Not enough variety Not enough variety in menus not enough variety within the dining courts Not really a variety except for &quot;Steak night&quot;, etc. Most halls serve the same food. not very vegetarian friendly Often Several dining courts will be serving the same entrees on the same day. Often the only way to get a decent, over priced meal. on-the-go! on campus needed! Only go to one dining court due to the overcrowded nature of all the other dining courts. Please make more low fat options! And more avaiable calorie information. Please spell dining correctly in the question. Plenty good. pretty good Reasonable variety of good tasting food. Repetitive menus are a bit of a problem. same things every week, needs some more variety see above comment Selections and locations were good. So few vegetables, more please! So many choices. No other university that I have visited compares to Purdue&apos;s variety of choices. some days there is nothing good to eat. not many vegetarian options anywhere except windsor (which isnt open on the weekends) Some dining courts seem to have better food than others. Some foods aren&apos;t fresh. Good variety, though. Some of the Dining Courts have unique things (Wiley Dining - Smoothies). I wish these things were offered at more dining courts. Some of the dinning courts are too expensive. Sometimes seems like they have too similar foods. But good food. Sometimes there is not very much variety, and menus are repeated very often. somewhat the same Spread out the good food more! Take polls on favorite food items or something. STOP SERVING TACOS ALL THE TIME.  / Also, switch up which foods to pair together. I see the BLT sizzling salad, the breaded chicken wings and the noodles romanov all together about every two weeks at Windsor. Students need a variety. Sunday dinners would be nice. super awesome The best food is at ford which is too far away from any of the dorms. The different dinning courts will offer the same meal but they will taste totally different. It would be nice if they served meals students would eat at home not these foods with a bunch of stuff thrown into it. The dining courts all seem to have the same thing. the dining courts are very similar The dining courts offer great food. Although sometimes the variety is not that great within each individual dining court, there are different options between them. The dining courts serve a lot of weird food that I would never eat. Hillenbrand and Windsor&apos;s selections are particularly poor. The dining courts tend to have very similar menus, the only real choice I have to make is how far do I want to walk The food at the dining courts is fantastic! I just wish that Hillenbrand would have a little more selection during the week. The food available to people without food restrictions is excellent. However, I get sad when my friends who have vegetarian/halel/kosher food restrictions don&apos;t have much to eat. The food gets repetitive. The food is great The food is nice in the beginning, but once you get used to it then none of the food changes The hours they are open are too limited. I&apos;ve skipped meals before because I know I&apos;ll have to wait outside for 30min. The large dining halls offer the same food far too often. The menu website is very helpful The menues repeat every two weeks or so. Towards the end of the year eatting the same food gets repetative. The menus are a great idea! The menus are not different. The dining courts have the same food. The menus are obviously repeated and not as varied as I was led to believe during the &quot;purdue&apos;s for me&quot; tour. The menus aren&apos;t always appealing to my specific taste...especially Windsor. The menus aren&apos;t always up which makes it not helpful at all The menus change a decent amount. It seems like a lot of days there&apos;s &quot;nothing good to eat.&quot; The food is pretty good, but not great. The menus for the dining courts have way too much international food that just isn&apos;t very good. especially Windsor. The dining courts need more good homestyle cooking, such as regular meat not ruined with a bunch of other ingredients and plain cooked vegetables. I like my food simple. The menus go through periods where they have poor variety. The menus rotate every other week. Could we at least have 3 weeks of different meals? The menus seem to repeat after a while and get boring. The menus tend to get very repetitive at some locations. Can more be done to make lunch and dinner differ? the menus were essentially the same, everywhere, everyday The mobile versions of the menus don&apos;t work that well at all. It would also be nice if the ones on the main website (not mobile) were quicker to access. The only hall I didn&apos;t like very well was Wiley Dining Hall because I couldn&apos;t always find what I was looking for as far as variety. The options are fairly good. The pattern of the same food all the time at each dining court can get old. The selection varies from place to place but it seems like the same menus are used over again at each dining court. The variety is great but in order to cut costs I feel that the Food Services could cut back on variety yet still maintain great menus. The variety is usually great, but somehow it seems to be taco week every other week at every dining court The variety was great. There are not a lot of vegetarian options There are not enough healthy options. Most of the food is fattening or bad for you. Too many bad foods, not enough healthy ones. There are too many in my opinion. Maybe spend that money on building more recreational facilities. It seems Purdue enjoys having their students unfit by constantly adding dining areas around the campus. There is a decent variety There is good variety in all the dining courts. There is little variety even when you go to different dining halls. It&apos;s basically the same thing. I think that more foods that are culturally inspired and &quot;common&quot; to everyone should be placed in dining halls instead of the formal stuff. There is not a wide variety of food selections from lunch to dinner. It is depressing. There is such a wide variety of food options. I have never got tired of eating at any certain place. There needed to be a dining hall closer to campus. And the existing ones aren&apos;t big enough. Lines are too long. The food at Wiley is horrendous. There should be a location on the academic campus area. There should be one always vegetarian station at all dining courts. Yes, there is only at least one food item on the menu that is vegetarian, but I fount myself eating the same meal everyday unless I wanted to hike all the way over to Windsor, where they have a vegetarian station that varies with every meal. There&apos;s variety- on a schedule. These deserve separate questions. They all have basicly the same menu, and they don&apos;t have enough variety. The menu rotation is repeated too often. They all have the same food about every week. It gets really old and boring. they are all pretty much the same thing They are too far from Hawkins for daily use They don&apos;t have breakfast menus. I currently live off campus and would be glad to get UR breakfast if I knew what they were having! Easy to find, access, and use. *&apos;s indicate vegetarian food, but nothing indicates COULD BE vegetarian (such as the pizza bar) and so I often skip over it, thinking nothing vegetarian is available. They have days were everything is good (those that the majority of students like) and then days were nothing sounds good. They should look at the menu and try and even it out so there is something popular each day. They have great variety, but rotating the same menus still gets monotonous when you live in the residence halls for more than a year. they just rotate the menu items throughout the halls and it is annoying. They still differ but it still seems like the same thigns are being served all the time. They very pretty well, except for ford They&apos;re good Things get redundant at Hillenbrand. This is definitely very important. too far. Too few, too crowded, too far away. too much friedfood Too repetitive. Try to include some more cuisines. Use spell-check on this survey! Dining only has one &quot;n&quot; Used almost four years ago so things have changed Usually, the food is exciting enough to keep me coming back. Variety is alright. Vegetables are always overcooked. There&apos;s too much cheese and oil in everything. Need more vegetarian options. very good variety Very happy with dining services Very satisfied Was good We have a lot of variety already but could use some changes. I love Ford&apos;s Chinese New Year&apos;s dinner, it was amazing! we need more Asian food. we shud b allowed to swipe others on our meal plans weekend options seem to be the same most of the time When I first attended Purdue as an undergrad about 10 years ago, there were very few, if any, real food choices for vegetarians/vegans (which I am). It was a major reason I moved out of University Residences, because I was paying for a meal plan that I definitely was not using to get my full moneys worth. Now, there are SOOOOO many, clearly labeled, specifically designed options for people of all diets. Its really fantastic. Well done! When I lived in the residence halls I would visit a variety of dining halls to experience the variety of menus. When they built the Wiley dining hall I was pretty upset, because it is literally in between two other dining halls (Ford and Windsor) that were just fine, and it took away a lot of recreational and intramural spaces. While it is good to have different things to eat, sometimes the dinning courts all have a similar theme, which isn&apos;t good if you are in a different mood. Wiley is the only good dining court. Windsor has sketchy looking ethnic food all the time and Ford is the same thing over and over, except it isn&apos;t any good. Harrison is the only dining court that is a close second to Wiley. Wiley needs to be more diverse. It&apos;s seems like its always steak or pizza. Maybe some international cuisine. Wiley&apos;s menu is too repetitive and does not explore cultural foods like others. Will not be able to afford if I depend entirely on the dining courts. Windsor Dining Court should be open for breakfast and weekends. Windsor oddly has all of their good options on one day, so other days, they do not offer great selection. Hillenbrand needs to be larger with a churrascaria like Wiley. Hillenbrand is excellent but needs more variety. Windsor&apos;s healthy options are incredible! Wish the menu at Wiley could have more helthier food. Worked in Earhart, so ate there most of the time. Would like a dining court closer to Union/South campus Would suggest more variety, not always having pizza as a menu choice You definitely misspelled &quot;dining&quot;. I hope they pay you well. You misspelled &apos;Dining&apos;. Also, there&apos;s not that much change. You spelled dining wrong :). Also, the dining halls were one of my favorite parts about living in the dorms. you spelled dining wrong above- &quot;dinning&quot; you spelled dining wrong on the questionnaire You spelled dining, &quot;dinning&quot; Young hall didn&apos;t have a dining plan, but I went to the dining halls a couple times and it was fine. yum yum! 

 

 (HFS11) University Residences–Student Employment Opportunities 

 A little hard to be involved. All jobs are for work-study students All of the campus jobs are work study only. Applied for a position and was confirmed. Then when I arrived on campus the job was not there. Applied for RA, was rejected and not informed why. Worked at cksg for two years. Applied, but received no response. also couldnt find where to apply for jobs in food courts Are you an employee of the Residence Halls? As a past RA I found it great opportunity to be an RA but there was a clash of responsibilites and expectations versus how we were treated. We were expected to hold this high standard and be very responsible adults but in the end treated like a child. But I will be using it in the future. Did not investigate employment with University Residences didnt use Difficult to navigate through. Does not Apply Don&apos;t know how to go about getting a job or really want to. Don&apos;t know. Earhart Dining Hall is a good way to obtain working experiences. Earhart is amazing! All of the other dorms should be more updated to be like Earhart (with vanities, air conditioners, etc) Employee in the Windsor Dining court 2006/2007. Did not receive great training and adult coworkers were grumpy and angry that we didnt know what we were doing....which was because we had no training. I left every day wanting to cry. employment opportunities should be posted more so people know about them. ALso, RA employment should not take until mid-march to decide. It makes it hard for those not accepted to find off-campus housing. Employment readily available, pay is decent, more autonomy might be good. equal chance for international students please...don&apos;t just give to the americans!!! Every job is work study. It is completely unfair that I cannot get federal aid or work for the university just because my parent makes a little bit of money. Everything is work study and nothing is offered for non-work study students needing jobs as well. There are several jobs posted on the Purdue website but not that many people can apply for those positions because they are only work study. Everything is work-study applicants only. Not much available for nonwork-study students. Everything is work-study, which I am not eligible for few opportunities for international students / and it&apos;s so hard to get Hard to find a good job after the first couple of weeks into the semester. have tried to get a job, but can&apos;t because i&apos;m not financially eligible, which i think shouldn&apos;t be a qualification. just because my parents make money doesn&apos;t mean i shouldn&apos;t be able to get an on campus job. haven&apos;t used I am already employed at the RSC so employment at the residence hall is not a priority for me I am an employee of Windsor I am currently a residential life employee and am honored to be a part of the team! I am employed as Student office staff at Windsor. I am planning on working in a dining hall starting next semester. Since this was my first year at Purdue, I wanted to wait until I had fully adjusted to college life. I am presently working at Boiler Crossing. However, finding a job in a residence hall took me such a long time, and was a very stressful process. I am thinking about becoming a tour guide though. I am very happy with this area! I applied for a job, was turned down, but received no reason for why I was not accepted. Feedback would help me prepare in the future. I applied for an office position and heard nothing back. Yes or no. I wish there were more opportunities. I applied for employment but because of poor communication by University Residences I was unable to work. I applied for multiple jobs every semester and never heard back from anyone. It should be a little easier for me to get a job and I should be contacted if I am not offered one. I applied for work at the dining courts but was unable to accept because weekends were required and I am frequently not at Purdue on weekends. I believe that it is important to have student employment opportunities because it provides students the ability to earn money to pay for school or to use on other things. I cannot find a job I currently work in the Earhart Dining Court and I love it; it helps keep the money problem down. I did not last at my job on campus due to my back problems, but the jobs offered are incredibly varied I didn&apos;t know the website existed, but I am employed by University Residences. I do not know. I don&apos;t really know much about it, but it seems like there aren&apos;t many options other than working in the dining halls. I felt like they require a great amount of work with a minimum wage. I finally got a job!!!!!!! Thank you University Residences! I have another job on campus, so this has never been an issue for me, but I know several people employed by dining courts or in University Residence offices, and they all seem quite happy with their jobs. I have applied for many jobs, and have never received a call back. i have applied to atleast 7 jobs on campus out of which i only heard back from 2. others didnt even bother to inform me of the outcome and kept me waiting. I have applied. I have yet to find out what results from it. I have been an employee in various aspects of purdue ranging from dining halls, to quick service restaurant facilities, tutoring and now I have a T.A. position. I have been very satisfied with the student employment opportunities I have been employed as a Student associate in Earhart dining court and in Hawkins as an RA. In both jobs I have been impressed with the ease of learning my way around and the help I&apos;ve recieved from fellow staff members. I have not used this service. i have sent out a bunch of applications but no one was hiring I have submitted several applications for work at the dining courts, but was never contacted. I have tried I have worked in the mail room and main office for Cary Quad and am now working in the main office for Purdue Village I have yet to find an appropriate job. I love my job! I love working for the university I loved working as a student worker with Earhart custodial staff, but I&apos;ve heard far less plesant things about working in the dining courts. i loved working at windsor. it had different schedules so it was easy to schedule around my classes. and i didn&apos;t have to work nights, which was nice, so i could get all my homework done I loved working in the dining court for 3 years. The hours were so flexible, and it was a great and not too challenging job. I think that more people should take advantage of these opportunities. I plan to use this service in the future. I submitted an application via the internet, but did not receive a response for several weeks. I tried real hard, couldn&apos;t get a job anywhere this semester. I tried though. I used to work at Wiley as a student supervisor, but I had to quit because the management team did not seem prepared to handle the facility and their leadership skills were lacking. Most of the supervising team was usually angry about the lack of integrity, organization, communication, or some combination of the above exhibited by the management. On the other hand, the students I worked with are my best friends and we are still very supportive of each other. I wanted to find a student job on campus, but when I went to the office the man working behind the desk said that there were none available unless I wanted to work in a dining hall. I was employed by the Union Dining Services, and found it to be an alright place to work. The employees were friendly enough, but I felt I was doing more work than just minimum wage was worth. I wish they offered more opportunities for students who are not work study. I work on campus elsewhere I worked at Earheart dining courts, very satisfying great place to work everyone is very friendly. I worked at Ford three years ago and I HATED it because they treated you like you didn&apos;t understand how to do simple tasks. I worked at Wiley dinning court but they owe me money for a long time !!!!!! I worked in Earhart for a semester, the people were nice and i had a great time. I worked in one of the dining halls and hated it. Everyone was on a power trip and wanted to be in charge (including the adults) which was ridiculous. The work was fine, it was the environment that made it miserable and the lack of flexibility. I would not want to be an employee of the University Residences. All I hear are complaints about workers&apos; jobs. Other than being an RA, these positions are not appealing. I&apos;d like to look into it though. I&apos;m a student supervisor I&apos;m an RA and a mystery shopper I&apos;m personally not working with the res halls/dining courts but my girlfriend does and so far, it&apos;s been great for her I&apos;m still upset that the Griffin Express in Hillenbrand hall was removed to add four tables for the main dining area. More people utilized the Griffin than those stupid tables. Also, Griffin employees/staff were friendlier and more helpful than those at Harrison. The food tasted better and had a wider variety than Harrison. I&apos;ve tried to find a job but most places hire people in first semester so it kind of puts transfer students at a disadvantage. I think openings should be publicized more. i&apos;ve worked at 2 cafeterias on campus. It was good I&apos;ve worked with HFS for the past three years and it&apos;s been one of the best (if not THE) parts of my undergrad experience. (I work in marketing, and it&apos;s given me the opportunity to do a ton of stuff that is actually relevant to my major.) A+! If I want to go to college, I work for the rest of my life. it is great to be right on campus! It is hard to find a job by Purdue&apos;s website It is nice and convenient to have a job on campus, but the pay could be better and more, especially when an individual is promoted. It is very easy to make your work schedule work around your school schedule. It took me three semesters to find a job on campus. It was a little difficult to find one, but relatively easy to attain employment once I did. It was easy to get a job as an undergraduate. As a graduate student, they won&apos;t even let me try. I still need to pay bills too, but they won&apos;t even give me a chance. Its extremely screwed up. its hard to get a job on campus or in the university residence halls unless you are a work study its virtually impossible for a non-work study to student to gain employment. we need money too. my parents pay for school, but nothing else. jobs aren&apos;t that great Like the avaliability Limited. Long time ago Make options known Many jobs are only available to students in the work-study, which I find unfair. Wages are ridiculously low for students working in the dining courts. Many of my friends are involved with SEO, and they speak well about how they can work along with their schedule min wage is not good mine is fine, others are mucho depressed Most of the employment opportunities that are relevant to an education major are work study only. This cuts many people out of the selection process and does not allow them to get experience in this field. Most of these require a work study...other college students are in need of money besides those in this program. I think more students should be able to apply. Most student employment opportunities are work study only which makes it very difficult and very discouraging while being a student without a car, looking for an on-campus job. My friend has been trying to get a job with them all semester and he hasn&apos;t found one yet. N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A n/a N/A N/A n/a need more advertisement on employment available need more opportunities for intl. students Need more opportunities. need more starting position job offerings. or need to publicize more. Need more varied jobs instead of just opportunities to work in dining never got a notification of whether i was hired or not. Never used it, because I don&apos;t have time. no no comment. No time none none none none none none none none None Not employed Not enough hiring opportunities for students Not from personal experience, but I know friends that have been trying to get a job on campus, and have a very hard time finding something not in the dining courts. not to many good jobs Office of Admissions Tour Guide Open up jobs to more than financial need students. Other schools offer better pay options to their dining court employees. Power happy supervisors made it an unpleasant place to work. see above comment Serving as an RA for one year of my undergraduate studies and a research assistant for my two years of graduate school has made my education extremely affordable. Shreve staff is wonderful! Since the question asked if I &apos;ever&apos; needed student employment, I answered yes. This was the first time I attended Purdue in 1987. Student Cook. Love my job. Best job on campus. Best associate. Best bosses. Best job. Ever. Student employee ranking system (tan shirt, grey shirt, black shirt) at dining courts creates confusion. Different supervisors tell you to do different things at the same time. Student Job postings are super helpful!! I have gotten a couple of jobs this way! Student Supervisor Students do nothing at work and stll get good pay. Sick. Students need the opportunity to work if they want. Telefund seems to be the only option and it is awful. Begging for money or &quot;pledges&quot; from people in financial crisis or other tragic financial burdens was heartbreaking and further having to get them to say no 3 times was painful for me. that&apos;s a laugh, no such thing The low amount of pay is not worth the time commitment. The off campus jobs should be listed in a separate category.There are so many off campus jobs that I have to look through to find some jobs on campus. The online application format should not have been eliminated. The people expect you to give up study time to work, rather than try to balance them both. you have to quit college to work in the food court The Student Employment Opportunities site is not up-to-date and I&apos;ve had many occurrences when there is a lag between what is available on the site and which jobs are actually open. There are few opportunities that are of true value to a student in the future. There is also little in the way of advancement. There are lots of jobs available for students! Keep up the good work! There are never any job openings There are not enough opportunities to work in Housing. The jobs are gone within the first couple days of the semester, then nobody hires and there is nowhere to work. Also, they don&apos;t EVER advertise for jobs, so you don&apos;t know when to apply. There are very, very few jobs available for those without work-study qualification, and there are many fewer jobs available compared to when my older siblings attended Purdue. There need to be more positions available to students who do not qualify for Work Study. It is impossible to find campus jobs that are not Work Study. Just because a students&apos; family has a bit more money, doesn&apos;t mean they pay for things anymore than a student whose family qualifies for Work Study. There seems to be more opportunities just for work-study students. More opportunities for non-work-study students would be appreciated. There should be a posted date added for each ad placed. There should be an opportunity for Graduate&apos;s spouses to work on campus; I also have seen some discrimination. There should be more attainable information on student employment opportunities. They are great and accomandate to students schedule with ease. To many jobs are work study. Too much structure--why is it mandatory to have worked in the food court before the mail room? Tried but don&apos;t want to work in the dinning halls Tried to get a job, but too few opportunities for someone which such a hectic schedule as I have. Tried to use, never given an opportunity Unfair choosing process. was not hired Wasn&apos;t able to do work-study because I never knew I had to fill out my FAFSA differently. Make that known to Freshman We should be able to earn more than the $1250 a semester if we work those hours. Wish there was more available. Work positions at PMU are way more limited than that of dining courts. Working at harrison grille. Good supervisors. Not a lot of retention though. The fact that they accept anybody to work decays service and performance, but performs an important social good for students who have never worked anywhere else before (like me). You can get a job just about anywhere, as long as you&apos;re willing to work for the dining courts...
