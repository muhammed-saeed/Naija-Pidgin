 Hewlett Packard, Masters of Incompetence and Evil - Compaq Presario Laptop

 Less than one year ago (February of 2009), my fiance bought me a Hewlett Packard laptop computer from Wal Mart as a gift for Valentine&apos;s Day. The wireless detection ability of the computer failed about two months ago. Last week, the screen stopped working, although the hard drive still spins and the fan starts up. I went to the HP support site and learned that this is a common defect with this model of computer, and that they developed a package to fix the problem.

When I called the customer service number, the man on the other end said that my computer was not under the one year warranty period because they had sold it to Wal Mart back in 2007.

 They would be happy to fix my computer for $260, which was a &quot;discount&quot; price .

I have sent a futile barrage of emails to the company asking why I should have to pay for a repair on their defective product. Looking at other reviews on here, I can see that I am wasting my time. Rest assured that I will never do business with their company again in any capacity, and I will save the money I could have spent repairing this computer and instead purchase a new competitor&apos;s model.

&quot;Masters of Incompetence and Evil&quot;

So, how are they incompetent or evil? 

 Posted by KenPopcorn on 2010-01-14 
Did you tell them that you had a receipt proving that the laptop wasn&apos;t sold until 2/09? 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
I would have thought that the content of my post would make it clear that they are putting out defective equipment, which is incompetent, and not fixing it, which is evil. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Sadly, my fiance did not keep the receipt for this product. The rep told me that it was sold to Wal Mart back in 2007 and the warranty was up already when I bought it. Apparently Wal Mart sat on it until the warranty was up, then unloaded it on the unfortunate consumer. I strongly suspect shenanigans between the two companies. Call me paranoid if you will.
 

 Posted by KenPopcorn on 2010-01-14 
That&apos;s the problem. You have no receipt, and they have no way of knowing how long you&apos;ve owned it. If you can find a way to come with the receipt (maybe Walmart can help) I am confident they&apos;d do the fix for you. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Well, KenP, I surely have thought of that. A receipt would indeed be a handy thing to possess. That, however, is not what I would consider the problem to be.

The problem is, HP put out a shoddy product to begin with. I have possessed and used this laptop for less than one year. I don&apos;t have an axe to grind with HP and have better things to do with my time than write spurious reports on sites like this.

Regardless of how long I&apos;ve owned it, there is no earthly reason why HP should have so many negative reviews, at this site and many others, if they were putting out a quality computer and stood by their products.

My hope is, other consumers will read this and not make the horrible mistake of buying a HP computer. I have largely accepted that they are not going to fix this problem. 

 Posted by Ponie on 2010-01-14 
Now, Ken--do you really expect someone to keep a receipt for 11 months? Laptops are a dime a dozen. Disposable. Like the Hershey candy bar I bought this morning. And this is exactly what Walmart does: Sit on the product until the warranty has expired and then unload it on an unfortunate consumer. How many times have we told you that Walmart is crooked like that? If only the man who bought it had known how they operate. I say &apos;man&apos; because he&apos;s referred to as a &apos;fiance.&apos; So it can&apos;t be a woman because that would be &apos;fiancee.&apos;
Joking aside, when I make a purchase of this type, the receipt is always stapled somewhere to the instruction manual which accompanies the item. But that&apos;s just me to be sure there are no shenanigans between manufacturer and retailer. Guess I&apos;m paranoid... 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Howdy Ponie, great to see you in the mix here.

None of your comments really address the issue at hand, which is Hewlett Packard&apos;s shoddy computer.

Ever heard of paid posters? Turns out, there are people who troll boards like this and get paid to do damage control by major companies. Shocking stuff, to be sure.

Any of you folks on HP&apos;s payroll? I won&apos;t tell, I promise. 

 Posted by zzrokk on 2010-01-14 
Grumps, we don&apos;t allow that here. We just tell it like it is. 

 Posted by Ponie on 2010-01-14 
I agree. HP puts out a shoddy product. That&apos;s why my previous computer, HP, lasted only 11 years.
To the poster: Ya&apos; know--HP manufactures and sells many, many products. Nothing is 100% foolproof. Not having the receipt is not what you would consider the problem to be? Wrong! You&apos;d have proof the laptop is still under warranty. 

 Posted by Ponie on 2010-01-14 
My HP check should hit my mailbox tomorrow, the 15th. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Another trend I&apos;ve noticed with you fine folks is any reviews you have, and most comments you make on other reviews, tend to put a positive spin on any negative situations mentioned. Interesting. What&apos;s the going rate, ten cents a post, right? 

 Posted by Ponie on 2010-01-14 
I don&apos;t sell out that cheap! 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Well, if you aren&apos;t trolling for HP, why not address the question of why their computer broke down in the first place. They admit that it was a huge problem right on their web site, so much so that they had to recall and repair numerous units. That is a fact, and it is undisputed. 

 Posted by bearkatkitten on 2010-01-14 
&quot;Any of you folks on HP&apos;s payroll?&quot;

I didn&apos;t agree or disagree with you... so, how would I be on HP&apos;s payroll? I just asked a question for you to clarify your title.

I comment on every review regardless of it&apos;s for retail, banking, cruises or whatnot... I don&apos;t discriminate. I&apos;m a person with an opinion. Whether I actually post things to help people or point out errors in posts or what not.
As far as I know, everyone that comments on my3cents are all free agents... whether at work or at home.

The allegation that some of you must work for the company is being thrown out now on a weekly if not daily basis anymore. The people making the accusations are normal everyday people who lack prior knowledge of the postings on my3cents and don&apos;t know any of you from the man on the moon. The fact that these accusations are being made so frequently speaks volumes as to the atmosphere on my3cents a site that invites people to &apos;Join the Consumer Revolution&apos;. Interesting.

Well Captain, I make the same reminder I make to the rest of the posters who accuse us of being paid posters: remember to have the shiny side out when you wrap your head in aluminum foil, otherwise they can still read your thoughts. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Typical response there, popcorn. &quot;You must be crazy.&quot;

No one has managed to address the real issue, which is HP&apos;s faulty computer and their unwillingness to fix it.

If you don&apos;t have an axe to grind, why bother to post? 

 Posted by zzrokk on 2010-01-14 
Grumps, I have over 15,000 comments here and haven&apos;t received a red cent! 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
I might also add that this is my first visit to this site, and didn&apos;t know that you and some of these others had been called out on being paid posters before. I find that quite interesting.

Did I mention that HP sold me a faulty computer and refuses to fix it? 

 Posted by Stew on 2010-01-14 
Captain, May I ask how much this computer cost? 

 Posted by KenPopcorn on 2010-01-14 
We post because that what this site is all about. You have gone from a sympathetic poster to showing how unreasonable you really are. There could be any number of reasons why HP had a problem with that model, specifically parts that come from another supplier. You yourself note that they offered remediation for the units. You go on to note that you didn&apos;t bother to maintain the receipt for a unit that would still be under warranty. But if anyone points any of this out to you, you resort to ad hominem attacks. That speaks volumes. 

 Posted by zzrokk on 2010-01-14 
Grumps: Why should they fix that old relic? It is now 3 years old and had you done your homework when you got the thing by checking dates against warranties we wouldn&apos;t be here now.
Either fork out the loot to get it fixed or get a newer laptop, hopefully of this decade.
That help? 

 Posted by Ponie on 2010-01-14 
zz, I&apos;ll send you a corner of the next one I get from Walmart, or Target, or T-Mobile, or Comcast, or......
Just don&apos;t spend it all in one place.
BTW, I thought the &apos;real&apos; issue is it can&apos;t be proved the laptop is still in the warranty period. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Stew, she paid $700 for it. Frankly, I wish she had consulted me before she bought it, but that is neither here nor there at this point.

zzrok, I&apos;m sure that not everyone around here is a paid poster, and I really didn&apos;t mean to imply that. But it is hardly unthinkable that some are, considering that it is a widespread practice. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
The issue is, HP sold me a defective computer and they won&apos;t replace it.

Popcorn, my responses are not attacks at all, but nice attempt at making me look unreasonable and crazy.

zz, as far as the computer being a relic, well, it was purchased last year. Nice try.

Did I mention that HP sold me a defective computer and won&apos;t fix it?

Usually their replies are in &quot;bold print&quot;.
Btw, welcome and thanks for having a backbone by not cowaring away from this site after fielding some replies. We all mean well.

I should also add that HP has a terrible rating on this very site. How do any of you defending there policies explain or justify that?

Can I interest you in a brand new Commodore 64? I will even throw in &quot;Pong&quot;. 

 Posted by Ponie on 2010-01-14 
Cap&apos;n, you think HP is bad? Take a look at Target, Walmart, or some of the banks and credit card companies. They&apos;re *really* up there! I echo zz--welcome to the site. Stick around. It&apos;ll be interesting. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
zz, I genuinely just don&apos;t want anyone else to have to deal with the set of problems I&apos;m receiving from HP on this issue. The computer that was purchased for me is defective, that is a simple fact, and as a consumer I do not feel that I should have to pay approximately 1/3 of the purchase price to have it repaired. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
I might also mention once again, for anyone who missed it, that it was sold to her less than one year ago at a chain store. It didn&apos;t have a &quot;2007 piece of crap&quot; sign posted on it... although apparently it should have. I was unaware of the year it was manufactured until I contacted HP and, very reasonably I might add, asked them what could be done about the problem.

I&apos;m not the kind of person who will get on line rant and rave about waiting in line for ten minutes at Taco Bell, and I wouldn&apos;t be here writing this review if the computer wasn&apos;t defective. 

 Posted by zzrokk on 2010-01-14 
I feel your pain, my friend but what else can you do?
Put the bad word out here and everywhere else you can about them but in the meantime you are out of a Laptop.
Think maybe you can finesse the fiance` into getting you another one this Valentine&apos;s Day? *wink wink* 

 Posted by Stew on 2010-01-14 
Captain, I had a similar situation with Toshiba quality. The plastic that holds the power plug socket secure broke and the plug recessed into the laptop. I did little research and this is a very common problem with that particular Toshiba model. Toshiba&apos;s remedy is to replace the plastic bottom half of the case and charge the customer 200 bucks. The fact that Toshiba had a remedy tells ya it was due to a manufacturing/design defect. My solution was superglue and sheet metal screw cost me about 3 bucks.

It&apos;s amazing these companies today get away with selling defective junk. On the other hand though that laptop only cost me $450. Eh, like my buddy ZZ says what can we do? 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
I&apos;m giving the laptops a rest and I&apos;m going to upgrade my home machine instead. It won&apos;t be an HP, let me tell you that, lesson learned. 

 Posted by zzrokk on 2010-01-14 
Good deal.
Sure that you don&apos;t want that Commodore 64? 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Well zz, if that Commodore has held up after all this time it&apos;s doing better than the HP laptop that was purchased less than one year ago, and I&apos;d be willing to bet it&apos;s a lot more useful than the $700 paperweight I&apos;ve been stuck with. They must actually care about their customers...

You paying the postage on that? 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-14 
I keep receipts for everything. We use coffee containers to keep them in. Anything electronic, the receipt gets put in the cabinet on our entertainment center. I got both my girls laptops for Christmas this year. The receipts and warranty info are in that cabinet. The laptops are also registered so they can pull them up by the seriel if I have to call. 5 Minutes of info can save you hours of headache.

The wireless could be it just needs the router you are pulling from reset. The screen, have you googled the problem to see if there is a fix?

I don&apos;t have any helpful advice to add. I just like the OP&apos;s NIC 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Believe me LadyScot, I wish that she had kept the receipt for this piece of equipment, but she didn&apos;t, and that as they say, is that.

They did check the warranty information when I gave them the serial number, and they told me that Wal Mart had purchased the computer back in &apos;07. It was still in the original packaging when I opened it, which is what leads me to believe that it was sitting in a warehouse for a good long time before it was sold.

I don&apos;t think it is so inconceivable that HP was aware of the problem with that model of laptop (because they were, it says so on their web site), so they dumped it off on Wal Mart and let it sit until the warranty period was up, then sold it... probably hoping that the average Wal Mart shopper would be too dumb to know the difference. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-14 
&quot;They did check the warranty information when I gave them the serial number, and they told me that Wal Mart had purchased the computer back in &apos;07.&quot;

Because that is all they have to go on. Had you registered the system like it tells you to (over and over unless you click the box to &apos;never tell me again&apos;) when you first turned on and went through the setup, then the purchase would have been recorded and the seriel would have been registered on that date. THEN they would have current info on that seriel and model. Or kept the receipt.

I&apos;m pretty sure (99%) I did register it, LadyScot. They knew exactly what I was talking about when I called them, they did have quite a bit of information about the computer and the problem.

Thanks for the heads up zz on LadyS&apos;s role at Wal Mart.

At the end of the day it doesn&apos;t really matter if some of you are paid posters or just bored people on the internet. I am stuck with an HP computer that has a defect that was built into the machine, the company won&apos;t rectify the problem without charging an exorbitant fee, and once again in this country the consumer gets screwed and big business isn&apos;t held accountable.

As far as trying to paint me some sort of &quot;paranoid brush&quot;, there are plenty of cases of corporations screwing over their customers, and some of you must be quite naive if you don&apos;t think that scenario like the one that happened to me happen all the time, and corporate America just gets a pass.

A warm glass of milk maybe? 

 Posted by Slimjim on 2010-01-14 
There are so many responses, I can&apos;t go back to see if this has been mentioned, but isn&apos;t this really an issue with Walmart? They sold a two year old product the manufacturer refuses to warranty because of such. I&apos;d See what they want to do about it, like either fork over a new one or lean on HP for warranty service.
Oh and Ladyscot- There is a product out there for clothes washers paws called Kelletts, which judging by this site, gets 100% thumbs up. Now how bout that gander at those funbags! 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-14 
Hi slimjim. I have considered Wal Mart&apos;s role in selling the computer sans warranty. I think that I personally have a beef with the manufacturer because they produced the defective object, they know that it is a chronic problem but they won&apos;t man up and fix it.

There is plenty of blame to go around in the situation, I know that I would have more leverage dealing with the companies with a receipt for the purchase, but I don&apos;t have one... that&apos;s on my fiance, but I can&apos;t really complain to her about not keeping the receipt, she bought the comp for me because she loves me and wanted to give me a nice gift.

I did mention to her that when it comes to buying computers, a little research goes a long way. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-14 
Zz, Slim, I didn&apos;t say on M3C, I meant anywhere. You still have perfect companies? 

 Posted by Slimjim on 2010-01-14 
Lol lady, kelletts is an inside joke here and are really some rubber feet for washers some guy makes in his garage and sells on Ebay
none the less, you lose the challenge. Now own up whilst I pick my viewing seat! 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
Legitimate company Slim. The point I was making is that every company has complaints and does not mean the company should be shut down or is bad simply because someone says something bad against them. Most complaints are customer errors or problems they caused in the first place.

Hell, look at McDonalds. Wonder how many complaints they have. I guess they should be shut down. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-15 
Lady, you might have missed it, but the defect in my laptop is common to my brand of laptop, the exact symptoms it displays are listed on its site, so in my case, it is a defect in the manufacturing process, not a user error. Hewlett Packard produced and sold a defective product, and they will not replace or fix it.

There was a huge class action lawsuit against them for this very problem, so they are not a bunch of saintly figures sitting around their boardroom, they are sellers of defective laptop computers. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-15 
Also, LadyS, I have to add that I&apos;ve had some bad experiences at Mc Donald&apos;s too, who hasn&apos;t, but Mc D&apos;s has always fixed the problem promptly, unlike Hewlett Packard. Also, maybe I&apos;m out $5 if I have a bad experience at a fast food restaurant, here my fiance (and me indirectly)is out $700, or more should I choose to pay HP to fix the defective laptop they sold me. 

 Posted by sherdy on 2010-01-15 
Cappy, I&apos;m sorry you got hold of a nasty computer. I have had nothing but amazing luck and service from HP computers, Compaq specifically, and from the techs. I am stunned they didn&apos;t honor the warranty upon your purchase. The first thing I do is register mine when I get it to put it on record. What does when the store bought it have to do with when you bought it? It was new in the box! They should have honored the warranty! 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-15 
Thanks sherdy. I&apos;m glad hp has treated you well. If they resolve this in a good way, I&apos;ll be the first to eat my words (happily I might add).

My next line of inquiry will be to Wal Mart about this, as the situation confused the heck out of me too. I&apos;d never heard of such a thing. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
OP, McDs won&apos;t fix a problem with a burger you have had for a year and no receipt.

LOL lady. I don&apos;t hate HP, even though my backlight bulb died within 3.5 years and I&apos;ve had other issues with it, I don&apos;t find the company at fault for it. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
Sherdy, unless the OP registered the computer with the date of purchase, then when Wally got it does matter. They are looking at a 2007 model, which may or may not be in warranty. I am not siding with HP or Wally, just stating that without a date of purchase HP does not know if it is their responsibility or the OPs. 

 Posted by sherdy on 2010-01-15 
He has a receipt with the purchase date on it. That&apos;s when he opened the box. I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s six years old, it&apos;s new to him and that warranty should start when the box is opened. My opinion, respectfully. The fact HP is giving him so much crap is shocking considering the tech who helped me with a recent problem called me back four times over three days to make sure my issues had been resolved. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
Sherdy, he does NOT have the receipt. Thus he can not prove date of purchase. Had he registered the product as the computer prompts you to when you first turn it on, it would have submitted all the pertinent info to HP that moment. Or, he could have called HP to register the computer. They come with registration cards with the phone number and a list of info the CSR will need.

&quot;Sadly, my fiance did not keep the receipt for this product. &quot; 

 Posted by sherdy on 2010-01-15 
I stand corrected...I was also thinking of a credit card receipt, too. Still, the warranty should be good on this if he had some proof. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
Sher, if he did have the receipt, the warranty would be good. :) 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-15 
I mentioned already that I am 99.9% sure that I registered the product. The fact remains that HP sold me a defective computer, and they won&apos;t replace it.

HP told me that they sold this computer to Wal Mart, and that is why the warranty was no good. Did I fail to explain this, cause I thought I mentioned it three times already. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-15 
Lets also not forget the class action lawsuits filed against HP for laptops with this exact problem. Some of you folks are obfuscating and dancing around the issue, which is the undisputed fact that my fiance bought me a computer less than one year ago, it is defective, and HP wants to charge me 1/3 of the original purchase price for the repairs.
 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
OP, if you registered the unit, then HP would have the date of purchase. The registration process asks for it. If it has been registered and it is still under warranty there should be no problem getting it serviced. Have you called and just asked for the service department or trouble shooting? They would have your unit model, serial, DOP, your name, address and phone number. If they have all that info, then they should have the warranty info too.

I will be sure sure to confirm with HP that I registered the product, so thanks for bringing that up. I recall doing it, and like I also said before, they had the information on my machine on their computer already.

Did I mention that HP has been sued for this exact defect and has a class action lawsuit against them? Funny how some of the people chiming in are ignoring this very pertinent fact... 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
OP, you should already know that repairing any unit usually costs 1/4-1/3 the cost of new. Heck, my dryer was $150, and the little plastic knob was $40 to replace. I use a pair of pliers. Cost of repair is not the point. The only point is WHO pays: you or HP.

Now, your class action lawsuit pertained to HP over the Nvidia GPU motherboards, and was thrown out. Let me read more about it. Does your laptop even HAVE that motherboard? What model do you have?

Amazing the info you can find on Google. Oh, and I am looking for answers to your wireless and screen problem. I usually charge $40/hour for this, but consider it my gift to you. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-15 
OP, forget the lawsuit for crying out loud. Concentrate on your laptop.

Blank screen: Press FN+F6. This is the most common fix I have found.

Wireless: either buy a $20 removable wireless PCI card or try these fixes. (First, try rebooting your wired modem and make sure any updates or added downloads have no reconfigured your settings)

I&apos;ll give those a whirl as soon as I can, Lady... looks like I&apos;m not the only Grumpypants ;)

I am still researching the lawsuits, the last report I was able to find said that the Supreme Court had thrown out HP&apos;s motion to dismiss the suit, been too busy to do this full time as I got married yesterday. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-16 
I also want to add that I was reluctant to research any &quot;fixes&quot; on my own because I was under the honest belief that, since the comp had been purchased by my fiance within the one year warranty period, anything I did to it might void said warranty.

And I still maintain that either Wal Mart or HP engaged in some shady business tactics to get out of that warranty... but that&apos;s a whole &apos;nother ball of wax. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-16 
OP, the only thing you can do to void the warranty is to open the laptop or allow another store to tinker with it. Pressing F6 is not going to void your warranty. Imagine being without your laptop for 3-5 weeks for someone to press FN+F6.

I always google to find the answers to CPU problems before I send my system to the company to fix. No telling how long I would be without it. Most times it is something simple you can do yourself. As long as you aren&apos;t replacing parts you are ok with your warranty.

&quot;And I still maintain that either Wal Mart or HP engaged in some shady business tactics to get out of that warranty&quot;

I work at Walmart and have bought HP computers and dealt with HP service department. I still have never had a problem with either one. And Walmart does not warranty the products they sell, the manufacturer does. As with all retailers. 

 Posted by ProConsumer on 2010-01-16 
My opinion is this, take it for whatever it is worth. If the problem is in fact a defect in manufacturing or programming that is known to HP and they have a &quot;fix&quot; for it, they should make the repair regardless of warranty or receipt. It&apos;s the right thing to do. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-16 
Pro, there are thousands of things that have fixes, in and out of warranty. I am nearly positive that if the OP produces that sales receipt or credit card slip showing the date it was purchased to prove it is in warranty, then HP would fix it.

But again, why would you ship something to the manufacturer that you can fix yourself and not be out of your system? Especially since reading the fixes they are so easy to try? And if it is out of warranty, why pay someone to do hat you can do yourself? 

 Posted by ProConsumer on 2010-01-16 
Lady I am talking about bonafide defects, ones that happen to almost every computer that they know is defective. Like in cars, if there is a recall, they fix it for free. If the OP registered the computer online then HP should be able to pull that information. But that is an assumption on my part. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-16 
Pro, it is also an assumption on his part too as he is not sure he registered it. Just because HP can pull up info on the system, they made it, of course they have that info. What they don&apos;t have is the date of purchase, which tells me it wasn&apos;t registered. 

 Posted by ProConsumer on 2010-01-16 
We&apos;ll have to agree to disagree on this one. I think HP should fix it. :) 

 Posted by PepperElf on 2010-01-16 
personally i&apos;d say get a mac

i do agree that the warranty should start from the time the customer purchases the computer from the store - assuming it&apos;s a new purchase and not a refurbished one. if it is refurbished the warranty is then from the company you purchased it from, if i&apos;m not mistaken.

kinda like the new apple cord i just got. it&apos;s refurbished so the warranty is from OWC and not apple.

either way.. eh, i&apos;ve never had much luck with HP laptops
my hp desktop is quite a trooper - lil beast is over 5 years old now. though, i refuse to put any windows on it other than xp. right now it&apos;s got opensolaris though. might put it back to xp since the NIC isn&apos;t working too well on it not with OpenSolaris that is... but eh, maybe later too. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-16 
Pro, I am not disputing that. :) Only that the OP has to prove date of purchase. Which is what the receipt is for. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-16 
Its nice to hear a few supportive voices. As far as registering the product, I have said a few times that I am almost positive that I did, and it will be a topic of conversation when I speak with HP again. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-17 
Captain, there is a big space between thinking and knowing. I am not trying to beat you up. Just trying to make you understand when you give the serial number of the unit to Service, they can tell you the DOP and the warranty status, if you registered it. If this info is missing, then you are mistaken.

If you can prove date of purchase, then yes they should fix it. Personally, I would try the fixes myself first. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-17 
If they ever get around to calling me, I will ask them about the status of the registration. I believe the man on the other end mentioned Wal Mart before I did, and that seems like a piece of info I typed into the comp soon after I got it.

I will be trying the fixes you suggested quite soon, and I hope they work. I just have the suspicion that it won&apos;t be that easy. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-18 
Talked to a case manager, who was professional and sympathetic, but the bottom line is they won&apos;t do anything without a receipt. I&apos;m still dissatisfied by the fact that the computer was defective and still baffled by the strange warranty situation, which wasn&apos;t explained or resolved, but I&apos;m taking the whole thing as an expensive lesson learned. 

 Posted by LadyScot on 2010-01-18 
To me it is simple. No receipt, no warranty or way to prove one. Every warranty begins with date of purchase unless otherwise stated. Instead of letting it be an expensive lesson, just try the fixes. 

 Posted by Captain Grumpypants on 2010-01-19 
I tried the screen fix and didn&apos;t get anywhere, LadyS. As far as the receipt, well, there&apos;s nothing to be done about it. Doesn&apos;t change the fact that I ended up with a defective computer, and whether I have a receipt or not, I know the facts of this case, and I stand by my review.

I will say that HP was unfailingly polite in telling me that they were not going to help me.
