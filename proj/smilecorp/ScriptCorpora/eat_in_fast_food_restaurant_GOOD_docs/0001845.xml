Healthy Fast Food Choice

The busy life style makes the fast choice appear appealing, but health remains a concern. Keeping control of the choices through moderation and selection can provide convenience with healthy choice. You still may want to eat fast food everyday, but do not have to increase fast food’s appeal through depriving appetite suppression.
 
Super Size it

Do you really need the largest size burger available at the restaurant with thousands of fries? Will you eat all the fries before the fries get cold? Restaurants claim these sizes are the best value, but unless you eat all the food, it is waste not value.

 Fast foods have a value menu that frequently have a smaller burger that frequently come with lettuce and tomato condiments. Few restaurants offer these burgers rarely in meals except for a meal marketed to children. Many adults will go through the drive up window and purchase a child’s meal to get an adequate size meal.

 Sub sandwiches are entering the supersizing options by increasing the length for the price. You can split the value between two people, save, and order the low fat and calorie option, but care needs to occur to avoid adding high calories and fat condiments.

Side dishes

Fast food and other restaurants have promoted French fries as the optimum side dish for a burger. Do you need French fries with a sandwich? There are other options available such as a side salad if dressing is sparingly applied. If you are stopping into a fast food restaurant for a snack, this might offer the best opportunity to enjoy French fries. It is better to enjoy more frequent small meals than three large meals. With allowing French fries as a snack prevents the French fries appearing appealing due to deprivation. Not all the foods need consumption at the same time.

Secondary Fast Food

There are many take out options available. Stores have deli options that have salads and entrees that are hot and ready to eat. You will need to avoid the fried foods available also offered, but just as you were able to make choice in the sandwich restaurants you can do it in the deli. 

 Buffet restaurants are offering the ability to purchase take out food so salad and entrees are available as take out food. Oriental food restaurants are allowing the purchase of quantities shareable between people or over several meals. Fast food does not need to be a single meal, but similar to a prepared food grocery shopping trip.

 Restaurants offer chicken in as many healthy options. The unbraided and unfired versions are avoidable in salads, wraps, some sandwiches and entrees.  Even places famous for the fried chicken have offered roasted chicken.

Fast food can provide convenience if used with caution and moderation. Consumers who eat according to appetite rather than suggested portions can eat healthy.
