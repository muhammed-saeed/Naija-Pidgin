 The only one that can really be answered is what you should wear. The general practice is to dress one level higher than what is worn on the job. That being a nice blouse and skirt/khaki type pants should suffice for a fast food place.

The questions asked for this type of job, and depending on your age will most likely be tied to how responsible you are, how you get along with others, and your sense of customer service.

The other questions you have regarding pay, schedule, and duties will most likely be answered in the interview. If they are not, do not be afraid to ask. Most prospective employers would like for you to be engaged in the interview.

Remember, the interview is just as much for you as it is for them. If you feel that based on what comes out of the interview that you are not a good fit, do not take the job. The last thing you want is to put yourself in a situation like that.

 Most Wendy&apos;s open at 10, with the openers coming in between 7 and 10. When you go for your interview, dress casual, a nice pair of pants and nice top, no jeans or shorts. Keep jewelry to a minimum.
The questions that the interviewer will vary. Some managers use an interview checklist, some don&apos;t. They are basically trying to get a feel for your work ethic and sense of responsibility.
You will probably start at minimum wage since you are 14, but can earn increases by working hard. Most companies have an employee meal discount that varies in how much they take off of the price.
You will probably work at the front counter when you start. Because of your age, you are not supposed to operate any equipment( nothing like a grill or a fryer).
Don&apos;t let anyone give you a hard time about working at a fast food restaurant. I started in high school and spent about 25 years making a pretty good living.

 Dress formal.
If there are 2 people looking for the same job, they both have the same qualifications... one turns up in a trackie, the other in a suit... who will they pick? Hmmm.

The interview will vary. If you have a detailed CV, they will probably be interested.

The questions they will ask will probably be related to your CV, so know your CV back to front.

Don&apos;t worry, its only Wendy&apos;s. As for the other questions, you will probably be given the opportunity to ask them in your interview.

Good luck , I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll do fine :)

 I think they open about 11:00 since they don&apos;t serve breakfast (in Texas). Just dress as usual. Don&apos;t over dress. Don&apos;t wear a lot of jewelry or makeup. They&apos;re going to ask you why do you want to work there? Are you a quick learner? Do you come to work on time? Why should I hire you? the interview should take about 15 minutes or so.

When you get to the end of the interview, the mgr. will ask you if you have any questions . . if you don&apos;t want the job, just say&quot;No.&quot;If you do want the job, look the mgr. right in the eye, smile big, and say,&quot;Yes, when can I start?&quot;then shut up. Don&apos;t say anything else, but wait for him to reply. He will probably say something like,&quot;Can you start tomorrow?&quot;

They probably pay minimum wage. Don&apos;t know if they give a discount or not. You will probably start with cooking the food, probably the french fries, then move to the grill, or sandwich assembly. You have to know how the food is made and what goes on each sandwich before you start waiting on the customers as the customers are going to ask you about the food. You will probably have to know everything in the kitchen before you work the register.

One other thing . . the oil in the fry vats is 350º. If it gets on you, it will burn you and leave a permanent scar. Be careful! and Good luck!
