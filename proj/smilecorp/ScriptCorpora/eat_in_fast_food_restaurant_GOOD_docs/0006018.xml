Quality food at a decent price
 
This restaurant have really good food at a decent price. But, I would not plan any dates there. The atmosphere is more like a fast food restaurant and is very deceiving if you use the look and feel of a restaurant to determine rather or not to dine there. I will recommend take out or delivery because the food is very good and the service is nice beside the fact that they make you pay for chop sticks.
