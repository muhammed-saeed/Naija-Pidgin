Review of Five Guys and a Burger Hamburger Restaurant
 May 23rd, 2009 by Kristie.Leong.M.D 2 comments 
 Are you yearning for a good hamburger? Find out if Five Guys and a Burger is the answer to your craving. 
 
You&apos;re probably already familiar with the red and white checked decor that characterizes the Five Guys hamburger restaurants. If not, this popular hamburger restaurant will probably be coming to your area soon. Originally started in Northern Virginia almost 20 years ago, they&apos;re opening new hamburger restaurants all along the east coast for good reason. They give you burgers the way YOU want them.
 
Five Guys Burger Restaurants is a refreshing change from the burger fast food restaurants where they throw a hamburger on the grill, add a bun, a little ketchup, and push you out the door. This hamburger restaurant sells truly fresh hamburger meat which is free of preservatives and never frozen. Since I tend to gravitate towards a healthy diet with very little consumption of red meat, when I eat a burger, it has to be good!

The Five Guys Restaurant Burger concept is quite simple. You basically have your choice of four burgers which include a regular hamburger, a bacon burger, a cheeseburger, and a bacon cheeseburger. Sounds pretty standard. The difference lies in your ability to customize your burger with a variety of condiments and toppings. It&apos;s hamburger customization at its best. You have your choice of such toppings as barbecue sauce, hot peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, a-1 sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. All of this at a hamburger price of less than $5.00. You can&apos;t get that at McDonald&apos;s or Burger King!

If you&apos;re not in the mood for a hamburger, Five Guys Burger Restaurant serves a variety of hot dogs and even a vegetable sandwich and a grilled chicken sandwich if you&apos;re taking a break from red meat. You&apos;ll also enjoy their delicious, freshly cooked french fries made from real Idaho and Maine potatoes. These are the real thing, cooked with their skins intact, served either plain or with cajun spice. Plus, they&apos;re extremely generous with their portion size. These french fries are a welcome change from soggy, limp fast food fries.

To order your burgers, you place your order at a counter, similar to a fast food restaurant. Five Guys hamburger restaurant makes your wait more pleasant by offering you free peanuts in a barrel placed beside the counter. Service is fast and professional, allowing you to enough time to eat and get back to work quickly.

How do the hamburgers taste? I ordered a regular hamburger with sauteed mushrooms, ketchup and jalapeno peppers along with an order of their freshly made french fries. A real splurge for me! Although, I found the hamburger to be quite tasty, I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s better than hamburgers I&apos;ve had at Fuddrukker&apos;s or Ruby Tuesday. Their real strength lies in the delicious taste of their french fries. They were crisp and non greasy. Just the way I like them!

All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Five Guys Hamburger restaurant. When you take into account food quality in the context of price, it&apos;s an excellent value. It&apos;ll probably be awhile before I return since I&apos;m not a big red meat eater, but I&apos;d certainly recommend Five Guys to my meat loving friends.
