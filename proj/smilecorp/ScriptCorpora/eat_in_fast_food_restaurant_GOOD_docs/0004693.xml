 Writing Tips - How to Format a Designer Resume 
 A designer is a creative person equipped with technological skills and experience. Graphic designer resume, web designer resume or designer resumes in general should reflect the creative potential of the individual. Resume samples do help you to design resumes but you need to individualize the resume and fit the content and design specific to your style and experience. A senior interior designer resume will look different from an interior designer who is just setting up his career in the field. 
 A graphic designer needs to format his resume so that his graphic designing skills and talent get reflected on the first page itself. The employer must quickly come to the conclusion about the potential of the candidate. 
 Some tips on how to format a designer resume: 
  Match the expectations: 
 Career objective is an important section and should have your career goals. It should match the expectations of the prospective employer; if your objective is way beyond the requirements it shows that you are not a proper candidate for the job. There are some requirements mentioned by the employer, ensure that your objective focuses on these requirements. If the employer is expecting you to be innovative then your objective should mention that you aspire to contribute to the organization you associate with in an innovative and creative manner. 
 Qualifications: 
 The summary of your qualifications should justify why you are qualified for that particular job. The list should be in point format and should match the career objectives. The qualifications summary should include your credentials, software knowledge, achievements, awards, and any other relevant information about your knowledge and qualification. Keep the list short to 10 points. A long format tends the reader to lose interest in your resume. Just in case it is too long, include it in two columns. 
 Skills: 
 The next section mentions the skills and abilities in the field of computers and graphic designing. Mention the different software, operating systems, programs, coding and programming languages, HTML, CS, Adobe Photoshop or CorelDraw. Do not include irrelevant information that employer has not mentioned in the job requirements. Use specific key words that will catch the attention of the reader. 
 Experience: 
 List your prior job experience, the prior employers so that the employer gets a clear information about the previous employers. Let the employer be clear if you were a graphic intern, a graphic consultant or a graphic designer. The job profile of each of these is different so you need to be specific. You have to mention your responsibilities, the work you have handled, the projects. The employer wants to know if you have been in the idea phase while you were an intern, or you actually completed designing work or you managed a department. Posted by Anna Phills at 2:13 AM 0

 The Key for a Successful Resume 
 The employment market is crowded with more job seekers as compared to the number of jobs available. To prevent your resume from ending up in the dustbin, it needs to catch the attention of the hiring managers. To stand out from the rest, executive resumes should highlight accomplishments. May it be a designer resume, graphic resume, 3D designer resume, web designer resume, teacher resume, management resume, marketing resume all of them need to highlight accomplishments. You can go through sample resumes to get a clear picture of how accomplishments are mentioned in resumes. 
 Accomplish the task: 
 To accomplish the task of writing a successful resume you need to know how to frame and highlight your accomplishments. Accomplishment means the activities that you have been involved in throughout your careers, that have created a positive impact on the employers’bottom line, cost saving, revenue, productivity, customer service improvement, and profits of course. Hiring managers are sensitive towards the candidates who contribute quickly to the business growth of the company and deliver ROI return on investment for the salary and benefits the employee is paid. 
 Key accomplishments are specific to industries. It will depend on your profession and industry. Let us look at some examples that explain how you can mention your accomplishment in tangible terms. 
 A regional manager talks about his accomplishment in the following manner: 
 Through constant team efforts raised $ 2 million territory by about 25 % that is $ 500,000 in 12 months. This was achieved by reactivating 50 dormant accounts. 
 Management executive will mention his accomplishments in the following manner: Successfully managed the workflow during the $100 million expansion project without adding staff. 
 Apply the“Challenge-Action-Results or C-A-R Model when you design your resume. You surely might get stumped about how to enumerate your key accomplishments, so you could try this exercise. 
 First 5 points about your greatest career accomplishments then choose one point at at a time and break it into the C-A-R model. 
 To give just one example of this with reference to the above example is as follows: Challenge: A sales person is expected to increase sales in his region as sales are stagnant for 3 years. 
 Action: He has got in touch with all accounts in the region and learned that many have not ordered the product because they found a competitor, who is offering a cheaper product. However they were not happy with the service. He suggested a 3 year service agreement for all new accounts. Many accounts expressed that they would definitely consider reordering from the company. Result: After the team’s sales figures were reviewed over 12 months his efforts had netted a $ 500,000 increase. This got reflected in the new sales in 50 key accounts contacted by the sales force. 
 Accomplishment centric resumes thus, receive more interview calls. Posted by Anna Phills at 9:11 PM 1 comments Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom)
