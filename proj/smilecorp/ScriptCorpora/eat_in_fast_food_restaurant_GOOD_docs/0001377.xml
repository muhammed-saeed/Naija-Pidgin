 Bellevue&apos;s Best Hidden Sushi Bar. I just love this restaurant. The ambiance is wonderful and the food is delicious. The Sushi chef is a master at creating fresh and delicious and pleasing to the eye dishes. I have never written a review before but I have to now. The chef also knows m,ore about beautiful Jazz than the DJ at KPLU and he generously shares his favorite and the mood he creates is magical. The prices cannot be beat.....so treat yourselfm to a rare find. They are located in the strip mall across from Dunn&apos;s Lumber..Have fun, Pam …

 Alright sushi. I just moved to the seattle area and I frequented sushi alot in arizona and I figured everywhere around here would have way fresher and better quality sushi. As for sushi ten it was just average. Noting special and not real fresh. It was just an ok experience. Yellowtail was falling apart and not fresh. Salmon had no flavor.The albacore nigiri was good. The spicy tuna roll was ok. The fresh water eel nigiri was good.I tried himitzu first and then this place. I&apos;ll just keep on moving on to other places until I find my new regular spot. …

 Best sushi in WA, bar none. I&apos;ve been going to Sushi-Ten Hama for 20 years now, since a year after they opened in 1987. Being a certified sushi nut, I&apos;ve tried most of the sushi restaurants on the east side, and I always come back to Sushi Ten when I want the highest quality sushi.

Seiki is from, and was trained in, Yokohama, and knows his sushi better than anyone I know. His fish is always fresh, or he wont use it. His rice is perfect. Every time I order a hamachi, or a saba, or a taco, it tastes so much better than any other places&apos; offerings. He&apos;s happy to make custom sushi from on-hand ingredients (I&apos;m fond of a spicy tuna roll with green onion which is like a dynamite roll, except sub maguro for hamachi).

I will be the first to admit the service can suffer, especially when they get busy. But if you&apos;re going to Sushi-Ten for a quick sushi bite, and demanding enough to get upset if you don&apos;t get the Cadillac service you&apos;re expecting - you&apos;re going to the wrong place folks. Sushi is an expensive item, fresh fish is very high maintenance, and a balance must always be struck between costs and profits. The real question is do you want rapid-fire sushi, or do you want sushi that tastes like heaven. If you want it fast, go to the safeway deli because obviously you don&apos;t care about how well your sushi is prepared in the first place.

The best way to enjoy Sushi-Ten is to go early (11:30 for lunch, 5PM for dinner), relax, enjoy a beer or a sake, and actually enjoy and taste what you&apos;re eating. There&apos;s a reason most of the japanese folks I know on the eastside go here - they know good sushi when they taste it.

Selection is less than in some places, but the key is knowing what&apos;s in season. Recently the big eye tuna was in season - and tastes as excellent as any toro. Seiki is happy to explain what is and is not in season, so feel free to ask! …

 I didn&apos;t really like this place. I usually like family owned places, but this one was just&quot;ok&quot;. the all you can eat sushi for $23 wasn&apos;t worth it for me. The have a menu of what you can order. Basic nigiri and some basic rolls. The sushi chef was nice, but she was slow. They give you ice cream for dessert which was really the only plus for me. It&apos;s worth a try. I won&apos;t be coming back because the service was slow and there wasn&apos;t a big selection for their all you can eat sushi. …

 Barely adequate sushi, horrid service. We were there for lunch today and we will never go back. The sushi was not good, in fact the hamachi tasted off, and we left sushi behind - which we never do. My husband said it&apos;s made him sick to his stomach.

The service was as poor as the food. We got our check before half of our food. It took 20 minutes to get water, and the table beside us waited for the same time to get sweetener for her tea.

I have no idea how this place gets anywhere near 5 stars. …

 Sushi Ten is very good, some customers definitely aren&apos;t (but luckily most are very nice people). Sushi Ten has delicious food, friedly staff. I witnessed&quot;Fitzsands&quot;- who wrote&quot;Service From Hell.&quot;He came with his wife&amp;another couple, all overweight and caring about quanity vs. quality. They should&apos;ve realized that one can&apos;t do&quot;all you can eat&quot;in the dining room when the sushi bar&apos;s packed. The waiter catered to their demands. They gulped down the part of their order they were given, then showed the waiter a list of what hadn&apos;t delivered , and wanted to know what would be coming. When the waiter (who was busy with many other customers) couldn&apos;t precisely remember exactly what they&apos;d been served up to this point, FItzsands and the other male customer became angry, and said they wanted the rest of their sushi. About 2 minutes after that, one of these men walked up to the waiter, and said&quot;Tally up our bill and give it to us, we&apos;re leaving!&quot;What&apos;s interesting is that the waiter told them it would be hard to do&quot;all you can eat,&quot;with the sushi bar full. but they wanted it anyway. They were forwarned. The waiter came to their table and apologized, and gave them their bill. They paid enough for the bill, no tip. Then one guy put down a $2 tip (for 4 people). The other guy refused to tip. What jack asses! 3 weeks later, low and behold!, one of these couples came back. The sushi bar had been completely full, a big party had just left, and sushi trays needed clearing. Instead of giving the waiter time to clear them , the couple walked straight to the sushi bar and acted peeved that there wasn&apos;t a place for them that very second. They stood menacingly waiting, looking over the waiter&apos;s shoulder, then sat. These people were obeese! They recommended to other customers what to order - great! When finally full, waiter brought the bill, but they sat, not paying. Waiter checked 3 times, still no payment. They walked to cash register, and acted peeved they had to wait 3 minutes. They didn&apos;t leave a tip. What fat, ungracious, arrogant slobs! …

 Plain surroundings bely the all-you-can-eat fishy treasures within.. In Short 
There&apos;s one good reason to come to this little restaurant, but it&apos;s a surpassingly strong one: Every night of the week, twenty bucks gets an all-you-can-eat sushi feast. Sushi chef Masashi Seki rolls, slices and arranges chosen favorites (tuna, yellowtail, the ubiquitous California roll) and keeps them coming till bellies pop. The small dining room (where you can order gyoza, tempura and teriyaki chicken or salmon) is more conducive to leisurely conversation. …

 Another hidden strip mall gem. Weeknights from 5-9, you can sit at the sushi bar (the tables, too, but the service might suffer) and pay $21 for all you can eat sushi. There&apos;s a good-sized list of rolls and nigiri to choose from, with a few unique (and delicious) selections like smoked oyster, &apos;mexican roll&apos; (hamachi, green onion, hot sauce), and shrimp tempura roll. If you order tea (and you should), it comes out in a huge carafe. The sushi chef was quick and talented, going around the almost-full sushi bar without missing a beat. They&apos;ve got telelvisions showing the news and traditional japanese music playing on the hi-fi. The decor is like a combination of tiki lounge and grandma&apos;s front porch, but decor aside, the food is worth coming back for. …
