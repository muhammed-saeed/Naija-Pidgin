 Fast Food Trading Up To Catch Customers Trading Down 
 Filed under: fast casual , no tipping , angus beef , Upscale Milkshakes , smaller portions , bone-in ribs , Chili&apos;s , upscaling , crabcakes , value portions , Prime Rib , upscale salads , Fruit Smoothies , multiple price points , menu psychology , Chick-Fil-A , Burger King , Wendy&apos;s , Lunch users , Five Guys , McDonald&apos;s , trading down to FF , price points , great recession , innovative idea , new normal , Hardee&apos;s , higher ticket totals , new products —Rick Phillips @ 12:25 
 The evidence is starting to pile up about one response to the new normal is that Fast Food brands should enhance the  restaurant experience available - almost regardless of price point - because in large part it is aimed at those `trading down’from the sit-down and tip waitress at lunch segment - and at the already existing non-tip fast casual (such as a Five Guys). 

 Examples include Wendy’s new redone Premium Salads priced at around 6.00 - and the large variety of `Angus’Big Burgers available at most of the major chains now. (Can Buffalo Burgers be far away?) It would also include the upscaling of Milkshakes at Chick-Fil-A and Hardee’s - to the recent bone-in BBQ of Burger King - to the upscaling, at least perception wise, to many McDonald offerings such as the yogurt choices and coffee. 

 These new positionings, which often include a dash of health perceptions mixed with a sprinkle of indulgence , can be fairly and profitably priced within the fast food price points compared to fast casual and especially when compared to ANY RESTAURANT THAT DEPENDS ON TIPS FOR ITS EMPLOYEES. As today’s customer, in the new normal, is no longer disregarding any `additional charges’as frivolous. 

 Indeed, when today’s restaurant using customer sees a Chili’s ad about the Burgers choices (with fries) starting at 5.99 - they know that - even getting water (the continuing trade-down) - that with tax their bill will be pushing 6.50 - which with tip (can you really tip under a dollar in a sit-down environment with table cloths) would be another buck (or two to not look cheap) - making the 5.99 advertised price point, more like 7.50+ and they are still drinking water. (The 1.79 and up prices on drinks at these places do them no help perceptually either). Indeed, throw in the drink, tax, (and now a two dollar tip) and you are talking 10.00 nearly - for the cheapest 5.99 advertised price point. 

 And, perceptions like that - add up to Fast Food brands having some opportunity for brand extensions with good profit price points. Doing this, while retaining the `value’and yes - even the `dollarish’price points too. (Dollarish (things under 1.49) would be a fun positioning.) 

 Lastly, since the new normal could be here for years and years, expect this trend in Fast Food brands to be a continuing process as brands find profitable brand extensions once thought of as not possible or too out of character for FF. Does this mean `value sized portions’of something as exotic as `Prime Rib’- before you say impossible - remember, this is the new normal. Crabcakes anyone?

 No question about this trend to having the choice of smaller portioned food items at restaurants - including FF examples of:“ Boston Market’s Market Sliders sandwiches, McDonald’s Snack Wraps, Burger King’s experiment with BK Burger Shots and Jack in the Box’s Mini Sirloin Burgers”- the point is also well made in the article about price point sensitivity in the new normal. http://www.palmbeachpost.com/money/malled-restaurants-offering-small-sized-items-with-big-728206.html - more too at the article.

 Breakfast War Begins Today 
 Filed under: Houlihan&apos;s , morning bakery , premium coffee , all day breakfast menu , adding liquor/beer , 1.00 NY pizza war , Moe&apos;s , Panera Bread , Subway , Wendy&apos;s , Arby&apos;s , breakfast daypart , Atlanta Bread Company , Five Guys —Rick Phillips @ 10:36 
 Today’s headline is in honor of the entry of Subway into the breakfast daypart nationwide. To me, most likely to be `hurt’would be the `Morning Bakery’type places (Atlanta Bread Company, Panera Bread, etc) as they also are `walk-in’- non biscuit - 7AM opening type of places. Subway’s entry also makes it harder for other FF restaurants that are not heavily in the breakfast daypart to start up - such as Wendy’s, Arby’s, some Chicken chains - even a fast casual like Moe’s.

 My Perception Of The Woodstock Georgia (Fast Food) Restaurant Market 
 Filed under: Roast Burgers , The Great Recession , Dunkin Donuts , Steak And Shake , daypart pricing , Po Folks , Capt D&apos;s , the new normal , woodstock georgia , Burger Inn , community involvement , New China Buffet , Firehouse Subs , Dairy Queen , Atlanta Bread Company , O&apos;Charley&apos;s , store closings , KFC , IHOP , Wendy&apos;s , Taco Bell , McDonald&apos;s , Five Guys , Checkers , Ruby Tuesday&apos;s , Krystal&apos;s , Burger King , Sonic , Panda Express , Arby&apos;s , Chick-Fil-A , Subway , speed of service —Rick Phillips @ 11:48 
 First, let it be said that my usage of nearly ALL of the restaurants has already assumed the `new normal’of the Great Recession. Regardless of what cheerleading the media may be doing about the economy - most folks are now cautious on discretionary spending - of which, restaurant visits - even to a degree Fast Food restaurant visits - has been impacted. 

 In alphabetical order: 

 Arby’s - I `responded’to the ads for the `Roast Burger’earlier in the year and was not impressed. I refused to respond to the Marry a Goat `humor’ad campaign and somewhat like the recent 5.01 combo or pricing (the one cent being for Quality).  That said, generally, I perceive that Arby’s as expensive without having coupons from the coupon mail drop a few times a year. Additionally, they  `streamlined’their `fries’- dropping my favorite the Homestyle. How can they NOT promote the Jamoca Shake? 

 Atlanta Bread Company (ABC) - Remodeled nicely. Upgraded to real plates and silverware. Messy to clean up. Can be crowded and slow service. Female favorite. Good soups and combo prices. Mellow atmosphere. 

 Burger Inn - Local  legend - all fresh cooked. Great breakfast customer base. Friendly people; newspapers available often. Excellent onion rings. Beefy hamburgers. Male favorite. 

 Burger King - I like the current billboard promotion about the Double Cheeseburger for a buck, real value - but - haven’t gotten it.  I have ordered the Mini burgers more than once however and view that as an excellent addition. Amazingly, the Woodstock BK got rid of Real Sweet Tea years ago (my assumption is that is still the case) and thereby nearly ended my usage—I can’t stand the fake sweet tea out of a machine. Operations should be aware that changing ICONic drinks can have a big effect.—Finally, where is the KING? 

 Capt. D’s - Perhaps my favorite FF in Woodstock. Quality, Quick, and Quantity with good value pricing. Covers all reasonable price points including lunch specials and on-going `specialities’that have all prices. Excellent choice of sides. Funny ads earlier in the year comparing to Red Lobster pricing. Friendly greeting and thanking when exiting. Good inside music. 

 Checkers - Still a viable concept (double drive thru) - chicken wings were a good addition earlier in year - somehow it fits. Catchy phrase“you gotta eat”recognizable for smaller chain levels of advertising. Covers all price points well with a good mix of products. The Woodstock store does Sunday Pricing - good idea - hasn’t ever motivated me for their `down sized’versions. Could probably `play-up’the FUN theme a little bit more. 

 Chick-Fil-A - Woodstock’s Chick-Fil-A is amazingly busy. Overwhelmingly busy whenever they do a promotion like 2-1 for a chicken sandwich or free food giveaway. Excellent quick service regardless of how long the lines are - especially at the drive-thru . (However, I’ve detected a time or two a usage of `workers in India’taking my orders—I’m not kidding - and, in this time of underemployment in America - that is NOT right to save a few cents that way.) Real Milk Shakes were genius. Consistent quality. Friendly employees. Clean.—————All that said, the Woodstock inside service in the sit-down area can be horrid and when is Chick-Fil-A gonna get some normal fries? Also, one takes a chance when getting the baked potato. 

 Dairy Queen -  The standard in Ice Cream desserts from the drive-thru. Haven’t used but really like the new pricing structure in ads 2/3 3/4 4/5.00 - interesting approach. Unfortunately, for me, the food hasn’t broke thru. 

 Dunkin Donuts - Right on the Strip - I’ve never used location. Certainly they can advertise donuts and donut prices more.  (IF I knew a quick Donut sweet was 99 cents for example - it would come to mind for `dessert’or breakfast purchase more often. Never seen a place less concerned with establishing a price point understanding. Just how much does a dozen donuts cost?) 

 Firehouse Subs - Expensive but Excellent. Can be slow. Friendly employees. TV’s to watch. Good real sweet tea. Small, can be crowded. 

 Five Guys Hamburgers - Tangential to Woodstock in Sandy Plains area—good operation - waiting for a Woodstock Location (several good places available perhaps too). 

 IHOP - Expensive, right? What specials? 

 KFC - Closed but not forgotten. Also was one, like BK, to drop sweet tea for a time. 

 Krystal’s - Krystal `fix’a must a few times a year. (Canton Road.) Ad’s featuring Crispy Onions on burger looks very compelling. Wi-Fi add - good idea. 

 McDonald’s - Woodstocks unit re-designs and updates the interiour often - which is nice. Clean. Service can range from excellent to very poor (weekends). Can often find an AJC or USA today in newspaper bin. Separate kids area - thumbs up. Fries can vary in quality. Best FF fish sandwich. 

 New China Buffet - Lunch value leader. Good quality food. Friendly employees. Priced by the pound to go. Widest variety of food. 

 O’Charlies - Stopped going shortly after changed menu restricting Prime Rib to Sundays only. 

 Panda Express - Have never used. Pass by back of lot 3 times a week on way to Walmart. 

 Po Folks - AKA Folks—&gt;Expesive for what you get. 

 Ruby Tuesday’s—How could they get rid of German Potato Salad? (pet peeve). Good miniburgers and platter pricing. Easy to split orders. Great salad bar still. 

 Sonic - I really like their ad’s inside the car with the main guy and his friend and the main guy and his wife. Classic. Best onion rings in Woodstock at FF. To me, tasteless burgers. Fun to use. Daypart pricing on drinks in the afternoon. Fun music playing. 

 Steak And Shake -  Best Milkshake in Woodstock. Can be very expensive without coupons and very reasonable with coupons. Great variety of sides. Great music inside. 

 Subway - Good with pricing with coupons. Good quality. Can be SLOW service. GOOD real sweet tea. Fresh. Daily specials a good way to address pricing. Excellent variety of sandwiches. 

 Taco Bell - Good cheap price positioning. Good Chalupa’s. Good real sweet tea. Good service speed. Good quality overall. 

 Wendy’s - Huge variety in quality - excellent one time - poorish the next. What the heck happened to the fries - almost tasteless compared to yesteryear. I’m told good salads. Expensiveish compared to McD’s. Baked potato good price/quality.

 Zipcode Marketing Your Real Customer Base 
 Filed under: zipcode marketing , church&apos;s chicken , Burger King , marketing dollars , Five Guys , Customer Base Size , MarketView —Rick Phillips @ 07:48 
 Part of the data the MarketView I offer asks the customer for their zipcode - pretty basic. Yet, the outcome of the data - can paint a very revealing picture of a stores customer base. Indeed, let me paint that picture with REAL data from a MarketView project. 

 For example, in a recent MarketView with over 10 units - the range of customers who came from the stores main two zipcodes - varied from 23% to 58%. And, as I have mentioned many times already in this blog - stores with similar sales figures often have totally different individual marketing needs. Indeed, since the above figures are real - lets say in a fairly large market that you buy a full zipcode distribution for your Fast Food Brands restaurant coupons into the homes of your market. 

 Not too hard to figure out which ones will do the best - does it? 

 What if you decided to save some cash and only target the stores that have their data show that over 50% of the stores customer base comes from the top two zipcodes? Pretty smart - don’t you think? And, is a real targeting of your marketing dollars. 

 Here’s some other FF restaurant links of interest: 

 http://lubbockonline.com/stories/082309/bus_485065787.shtml After the boost from an Obama visit - 5 Guys hamburgers is up to 450 stores.

 Perfect Demographics, Perfect Traffic Counts - Closed Restaurant 
 Filed under: Back Yard Burgers , Five Guys , Checkers , McDonald&apos;s , Lunch users , market development , fast food law , Trade Area , Bad Access , drive-thru&apos;s , cannibalization , Uncategorized —Rick Phillips @ 07:39 
 At the corner of Sandy Plains Road and Hwy 92 in North Atlanta you will find a Back Yard Burgers that has gone out of business. Most likely the owners did their due diligence and checked out the basics like traffic counts and the demographic profile of the area. Not only that, I bet what they found sounded perfect for the Back Yard Burgers positioning as an upscale hamburger restaurant. Indeed, the intersection has huge amounts of traffic and the demographics of the area would indicate `families’, plenty of roof tops, and plenty of income.  That said, the fact that a Checkers went out of business at the corner on the opposite side of the street - could have indicated that the location be viewed with caution. (The Checkers challenged an existing McDonald’s. The corner is now home to an Italian sit down restaurant.) 

 So, what happened? Personally, since I was a VERY light user (3 times in perhaps 3 years) I can’t speak to operations of the unit - but the experiences of my 3 in-store visits went very well. No negatives. So, assuming it wasn’t an operation problem - what gives? 

 What gives is that you need MORE than perfect demos and traffic counts; you need to understand the real market potential of an intersection. And, the real traffic flows for `your side of the street’. 

 First off, before you think the intersection was `too busy’and had huge back-up’s of traffic that no one would want to get `re-involved’with after visiting the restaurant - forget that. This is a well flowing traffic pattern. That said, most restaurant owners are aware that some intersections are `too busy’and don’t make a `good spot’sometimes. 

 No, it wasn’t that at all. The problem with the traffic counts in this instance was that most of it was `long - flow traffic’—most of it going miles beyond that intersection as a final destination. Additionally, the location had difficult access due to raised cement in the median - bad access especially can limit great lunch numbers; and females. 

 Additionally, the trade area likely did not have good daytime worker demographics - as one would assume the `hamburgers’skews male in positioning - and, likely, not even a strong daytime worker number compared to other intersections with less traffic . 

 Finally, another word about demographics—a given stores demo’s will almost NEVER fit the demo’s for a 1-3-5 mile area. Most restaurants need to know what subgroups are likely to be important (those with higher indexes) to a normal store like theirs. IF you have a restaurant that features 1/3 lb. burgers—you might want to know the indexing of males within the real trade area. (The real trade area of this store was probably ONLY Sandy Plains Rd. and probably mostly on their side of the traffic flow within 2 miles before Wigley Rd.—NOT a big real trade area.) 

 But, finally, the real story in this instance - was probably the competitive environment. A Five Guys opened in the direct competitive area, probably cutting off and being `first’to a large part of Back Yard Burgers lunch traffic and even dinner traffic - and in a more accessible (in and out) location . Splitting the hamburger business with McDonald’s was one thing - 3 way splits - can close a marginal restaurant with poor access to traffic flow.
