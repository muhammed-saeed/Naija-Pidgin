In The Market For A Soda Dispenser? Read These Tips Before Buying!
 By Miranda 
I recently helped a friend choose and install a home soda dispenser unit to compliment his theater room along with the small water cooler and popcorn maker that were already in place.  The process was a little confusing, especially considering all the products to choose from and dense technical information to take in.  After about a month of research, we were finally comfortable enough to move forward and choose a product based on his specific needs.  I thought it would be nice to share the fruits of my labor here on the blog, so without further delay, the following are some essential considerations to take into account when you’re shopping around for a soda fountain dispenser.

 Know Your Syrup! 

This is one of the most essential tips for any first time buyer.  Many people have no doubt squandered their cash on a soda dispenser that includes far more features than they really need, and ironically they still cannot get high quality soda out of the unit (a similar issue crops up when people spend too much money on an over-featured cat drinking fountain ).  Most of the time, this misunderstanding is not because of inferior equipment, but rather because they do not understand how to properly mix the soda!

Generally speaking, soda is mixed at a ratio of five to one:  Five parts soda water to one part syrup.  This mixture will yield around six gallons (or a little more if you stretch it) of soda if you start with a standard one gallon bag of syrup.  If your soda fountain dispenser uses the newer“bag in box”syrup refills, you can expect to have anywhere from three to five gallons of syrup to work with at a time.

Whatever you do, take the time to learn how your dispenser works and understand how to accurately measure the perfect mix of soda water and syrup.  The last thing you want is a soda that is disturbingly thin, or even worse too thick with syrup content.  I’m particularly obsessive about how pop is mixed, so perhaps I’m overly sensitive and this advice won’t be as important to other people, but if you are going to make the investment you might as well learn how to mix a great drink!

 Although it’s a bit extreme in terms of work vs. reward, you could also build your own soda dispenser 
 
 Easy Connect Points For Bag in Box Syrup Containers 

If you want to use the bag in box refills, it pays to go with a product that makes the refill process as painless as possible.  Most of the higher end soda dispensers will includes this feature as a matter of course, but some of the cheaper or lower quality units may not make it so easy.  It’s safe to say that most people, whether they be restaurant owners or home owners, will be drinking Pepsi and Coke products.  Therefore, make sure the dispenser includes easy connection points for each company’s refill bags.

 Multi Flavor Compatibility 

If you are going to the trouble to install a soda dispenser, you might as well make a variety of flavors available at one time.  Products such as the“Wunder Bar Gun”are set up to do just that, allowing the user to swap between different soda products at the push of a button located on the gun handle.  The gun should be perfectly compatible with the dispenser unit, itself, allowing each button to change the mix between soda water and syrup if need be (some products might call for a different ratio than the five to one that is normally suggested).

 Know Your Space 

Apart from issues with the dispenser unit, itself, you should also take precise measurements of the space where you want it to be installed.  Soda dispensers come in a wide range of sizes and designs, so carefully consider both the size of the space as well as the aesthetics of the surrounding room.  Ideally, a heavy appliance like this should blend in as well as possible so as not to call attention to itself in a gaudy way.  To this end, some manufacturers have designed their units to look like the old soda and malt shops of yesteryear, a perfect match for a home theater room or wet bar.  Try to avoid a product that requires a large Co2 canister to be stored in plain sight.  Again, if you are familiar with your room’s measurements, you will ideally have a place to hide all the ugly parts of the dispenser while simultaneously being able to display the aesthetically pleasing parts.

 Countertop or Under the Counter? 

Last, think carefully about which type of soda dispenser would work best with your space.  Some people will opt for the standard countertop system that restaurants tend to use.  This unit consists of a number of soda dispensing outlets which are triggered by a long vertical lever.  The cup is placed under the opening which corresponds with the chosen drink, and the lever is pushed back, releasing the soda.  Anyone that’s been in a fast food restaurant in the last 20 years has surely seen one of these in action.

On the other hand, the under the counter dispenser is exactly what it sounds like:  Most of the parts are hidden away, and only the hose and dispenser gun are exposed above the counter.  Any time you need to perform maintenance or replace a syrup bag, you would just open up the counter below and perform the needed tasks.  The obvious advantage to this system is the aesthetic quality, giving the bar area a slightly classier look and feel than simply placing a garish countertop dispenser on a nearby table.  Again, this is going to come down to the individual’s needs, but you should at least consider both options so you can make an informed choice.

Regardless of which product you choose, having one of these soda dispensers in the home can really enliven an entertainment space.  I have seen these things installed in rooms with billiard tables, movie projectors, and of course wet bars.  They serve an extremely practical end, allowing you to avoid having to mix your own sodas or relying on endless 2 liter bottles cluttering up the party space.  As long as you find a unit that is easy to clean and maintain, and ideally one that has been well reviewed by other consumers, you should be in good shape!
