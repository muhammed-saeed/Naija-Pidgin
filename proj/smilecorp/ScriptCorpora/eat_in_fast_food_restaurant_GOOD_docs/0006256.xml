There are many people in the world today who are faced with chronic kidney failure.  There are also many people who are at risk of this dangerous condition.  It is of the utmost importance to detect kidney disease as soon as possible.  The sooner it is diagnosed, the easier it will be to control it and in many cases, prevent it from progressing.  If you have conditions that are associated with kidney failure it is even more important to start taking care of your kidneys now with a kidney failure diet.  Some conditions that are related to kidney disease are High blood pressure and Diabetes.

High blood pressure is one of the main causes of kidney failure. This is because the extra strain placed on your blood vessels can cause them to become damaged.  If the vessels in the kidney are damaged, they will have a much harder time purifying the blood as they should.  Eating a proper diet that is low in sodium can help control your blood pressure, reducing the risk of damage to the kidneys.  People who have diabetes will need to pay close attention their blood glucose levels.  If the levels become too high, the kidneys will be under a lot of strain.  This can cause damage which will prevent them from functioning as they should.

 

 Protein and Kidney Disease 

Protein plays an important role in many bodily processes.  When the body breaks down protein for use, there are many waste products that are given off.  These waste products are then carried through the blood to the kidneys for filtering and removal from the body.  If the kidneys are not functioning properly, these waste products can build up in the blood stream, causing symptoms like nausea, weakness and loss of appetite.  If nothing is done at this point, these waste products can poison the body causing death.

It is for this reason that it is important to moderate the intake of protein for patients who have kidney disease.  The recommended amount of protein intake is around 15 to 30 grams a day.  This may sound like it’s easy to do but there are many foods that we don’t even realize contain protein.  There are two different sources for this nutrient: plant sources and animal sources.  The majority of protein eaten by healthy individuals comes from animal sources, but these can create a large amount of protein waste products in the blood.  As a general rule, vegetable sources are the best way for people on a kidney failure diet to get protein. There are also many other natural renal failure treatments that can slow the progress of this disease.

 Kidney Failure Diet and Sodium–Why It Is Important to Limit Intake 
 Posted on April 4, 2011 by admin 
Proper nutrition is essential for overall good health, but in particular for those who have specific issues and problems such as diabetes, kidney disease, and high blood pressure. It is essential to implement a kidney failure diet so you know which foods you should eat and those you should avoid for this condition.

While there are multiple nutrients you should be concerned about if you suffer from kidney failure, this article covers sodium intake specifically as it relates to natural renal failure treatment. There is a link between kidney disease, sodium intake levels, and high blood pressure. It is important to read food labels because many food products, especially processed items such as canned or boxed products, contain high levels of sodium. Other foods you need to monitor your consumption of when it comes to sodium intake levels include high salt snacks such as: chips, crackers, and pretzels; processed meats like bacon, sausage, deli meats, and ham; canned vegetables and soups; seasonings such as Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and seasonings like Lawry’s, table salt, and onion/garlic salt flavorings; and fast food/restaurant take-out menu items.

 

 The How and Why–Lower Sodium Intake for Improved Kidney Health 

Fortunately, manufacturers in the food industry caught on to the health concerns of the populace in recent years. You now have the ability to purchase products that are marketed to consumers seeking to lower their sodium intake. Many canned vegetables and soups offer low-sodium alternatives, and numerous restaurants now include healthier menu items so you are not limited to high sodium, high fat, and high calorie food choices. Choose fresh fruit and vegetables, and remember frozen vegetables are generally lower in sodium than canned. There are many herbs and seasonings available that are free of MSG, salt, and preservatives so you can enjoy flavorful foods without excess sodium.

Lowering sodium intake is important not only for those suffering from kidney disease, but excess intake levels elevate the risk for stroke and/or heart disease as well. Monitoring and lowering intake contributes not only to better kidney health, but the preservation and improved condition of other vital body organs and improved physical well being overall. Lowering sodium intake regulates blood pressure and controls hypertension. The kidneys are the salt regulators of the human body, and when excess levels are consumed on an ongoing basis, the fluid balance is upset and your blood pressure escalates. This then causes the kidneys to have to work overtime to compensate. Out of control blood pressure causes kidney damage, which is why it is essential to keep sodium intake regulated in your kidney failure diet. When it comes to natural renal failure treatment, start with your diet and keep that sodium level in check.

 Potassium in Your Kidney Failure Diet 
 Posted on April 2, 2011 by admin 
Potassium is a mineral that is found naturally in a wide variety of commonly eaten foods.  When your kidneys are healthy, they regulate the amount of potassium in your blood by removing the excess as it passes thorough them.  However, when your kidneys are unhealthy the amount of potassium in the body can build up.   This causes a condition called hyperkalemia.  This is why a kidney failure diet should really have a limited intake of potassium.  When you experience this problem, your kidneys may begin to shut down.  This can be very problematic and can also lead to other health issues as well.  It is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of this problem so that you can take the proper measures to treat it before it turns into kidney failure.

In many cases there will be no symptoms from this elevated potassium level, but hyperkalemia can cause slow or weak pulse, nausea and irregular heart beat.  If you eat a lot of potassium, or if you have been taking supplements and vitamins that have more than the recommended dosage, then you may want to have your kidneys checked.  Since it does not always show signs, you should really be cautious.  Over time this problem can lead to heart failure and death.  Limiting potassium intake is important in a kidney failure diet.

 

 How to Limit Your Potassium Intake for Healthier Kidneys 

When you are on a diet for kidney disease it is of extreme importance to identify all of the foods you eat and their nutritional value.  If you eat the wrong foods there could be severe implications in some cases.  Unfortunately there is no special menu at your local restaurant for kidney failure diets, so your meals will usually have to be prepared at home. Some foods that you will want to be aware of are:  bananas, potatoes, oranges, dried beans and nuts. These foods contain high levels of potassium and could be dangerous if too much is consumed.  Be sure that you are reading labels if you are eating any sorts of prepackaged and processed foods.

The best way to make sure that you are not getting too much potassium is by keeping a track of everything that you eat.  If you do this, you will be able to monitor your potassium intake and keep it in check.  Regulating your diet and incorporating exercise into your daily routine is the best way to make sure that you are promoting healthy kidneys.  You can start by focusing on natural renal failure treatment and focusing your diet around that.  This will give you the nutrition that you need to help reverse kidney disease naturally.

 Kidney Failure Diet: The Importance of Lowering Phosphorus 
 Posted on March 17, 2011 by admin 
For the normal person, phosphorus does not always present a problem in the body, but for the person who has kidney failure, it can become a deadly issue. Phosphorus is mainly located in bone, which accounts for around 85% in all humans. It is important for strengthening teeth and bones and maintaining a balance of pH. The body uses this mineral for many more important tasks, so it is vital to existence. A person without kidney disease can expect any excess of phosphorus to be rejected from the body, but anyone who has kidney failure must account for the intake through a kidney failure diet.

Phosphorus is absorbed by the small intestines, but it is stored systematically in the bones. Most adults need between 800 and 1200 mg of the mineral every day. This is usually acquired because it is present in so many of the foods we eat. An excess is easily achieved by consuming prepared foods and drinks that have large amounts of phosphorus added to them. The Food and Nutrition Board reports Americans are getting as much as 15% more phosphorus today than they did 20 years ago. The person with kidney disease has to be concerned with getting too much of this mineral, most especially if he or she is in stage four or five renal disease.

 

 The Dangers of Excess Phosphorus for Patients with Kidney Disease 

When the kidneys can no longer rid the body of phosphorus, it stays in the blood and accumulates too heavily in the bones. The patient suffers agonizing bone pain as the condition worsens. This can lead to heart and bone problems, resulting in extended hospital confinement and can also be fatal. PTH is produced in quantities too large to be released and it begins to weaken the bones, which can also develop dystrophic bone growth. Body tissues go through calcification because phosphorous combines with calcium and leaves deposits in joints, skin, arteries, the lungs, and the heart. This is a prelude to some serious health issues.

In some ways, it is harder to limit the intake of phosphorus than it is sodium and potassium because it shows up in so many different foods and drinks. The dietician will have kidney patients learn to substitute foods. For instance, milk must be replaced with either soy milk or some type of non dairy creamer. It is better to substitute soft drinks with herbal teas, sparkling mineral water, or diluted vegetable juices. Substitution of these items and many more is the natural renal failure treatment and is always better than using any kind of drug. A healthy kidney failure diet will take these changes into consideration.
