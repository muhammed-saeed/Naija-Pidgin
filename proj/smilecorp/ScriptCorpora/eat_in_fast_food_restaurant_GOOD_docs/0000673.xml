Welcome to Changing Lives Everyday, presented by Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center.

We all have the power to change someone else’s life for the better.

Sometimes it happens on purpose. Other times, it’s completely unintentional. Random acts of kindness have the power to make a real difference.

You never know how your story might impact another’s life…

Whether we know it or not, we are all Changing Lives Everyday!

My family and I visited with several very poor, struggling college student families prior to Christmas. We put together a Christmas stocking and presents for each family, consisting of food, toiletries, grocery store gift cards, toys and other treats. Each family was very grateful to receive the gifts, and gave us in turn a small gift that was something very special to them or their culture.

My husband and I lowered the asking price for our house (years ago) so that a younger couple could buy it. We lowered the price over 15, because we knew that it would have been awesome if someone had assisted us like that. We are helping them become home owners.

I perform two things that allow me to pay it forward.

1. I am a certified personal trainer just finishing my graduate degree. I am extremely passionate about helping individuals learn how to permanently change their health and fitness through a healthy approach to health, fitness, and healthy eating principles. When I was pregnant 25 yrs ago, I couldn’t afford to take birthing classes to learn all that I needed to learn. I now have volunteered at West Valley Hospital’s birthing classes by speaking to expecting parents about the importance and how simple it can be to get back in shape after the baby is born and then to become a wonderful healthy example for the baby in hopes of reducing our exponential growth in obesity in toddlers through young adults. I also offer a free 30 minute consultation free of sales pitches to anyone that requests after they are cleared to begin exercising as I will actually teach them some basic exercises to get started…all for free.

2. Once a week I donate platelets through United Blood Services. I have a friend who developed leukemia and needed numerous platelet transfusions. I had been giving whole blood, but then the UBS contacted me and told me that my blood type was greatly in need for platelet donations. I have been donating almost every week (I actually have a standing appointment every Wed) because I realized this was something I could donate that no amount of money could ever provide. Platelets are only viable for 5-7 days, so it is very important that when someone needs platelets, that there is a plentiful supply. I’ve been blessed to have an extra large amount of platelets for my size, so each week I donate a double unit of platelets and hope that my donations will provide someone with that life-saving opportunity that no monetary donation could ever provide. Although I’m busy and many people think I’m weird to do this all the time, I feel very strongly that giving my time, which requires that I just sit back and relax, might just save someone’s child or parent or another loved one. Life is too precious when I could change it by just kicking back once a week.

I called the hospital to talk to a friend and someone else answered the phone. He said he would like to talk so I agreed. I asked him why he was in there, he replied he overdosed on crank. He had been in a coma for a week. I suggested the Lord was looking out for him, he was very receptive, he asked to pray with him to find a better way, I think he will be alright.

Sometimes I think it is the house that I was raised in and still live in that is the blessing. Since I was little (50 years ago) there have been many soul pass through this house. Some staying a night or two many staying years. My husband and I only have 5 children of our own but feel that we can call more than 25 our own. Runaways, single parents, lost and confused youths seem to find their way to our door and join our family. Even as I write one of my“extras”is bringing her young family to“Moma Lori’s”. Our own grown children come over just to hang our, play football in the front yard or a late night game of hide and seek. So many have touch and added blessing to our lives. The best Christmas present anyone can give me is to let me sit outside, listening to the kids laughing, watching the horseplay and enjoying the hugs that are always welcomed. If you need someplace to go, come on over.

My family and I went down to a school some months back just before school started. We took our 8 and 10 year old to hand out free school supplies, including backpacks and everything they needed to attend school. We took our kids to do this because we want them to understand that not everybody is as fortunate as they are, despite that fact that I’ve been out of work for over a year and we’re struggling too. I want them to learn that no matter how bad things are for us, we can always do something for somebody who may be struggling more than we are. We are very proud of them for what they did that day. They both worked very hard and learned a great deal. It was a very rewarding experience for everyone in our family. God Bless everyone and be thankful for all that we have and not whine about what we don’t have. Merry Christmas!

My husband and I were asked if we could donate a shoebox full of Christmas gifts for children in Mexico. I decided to personally donate 25 boxes and also to go to Mexico with the team because I speak Spanish and was able to interpret. It was so rewarding to see the smiles of the children and their parents as they opened their gifts and learned that total strangers love them and care about them.

I went to my chiropractor looking for a little help for the students of my school where I teach. We are a very poor school with a 96% Title I population. When I told him that, he decided to take it and run. He has organized a toy and clothing drive for the kids at my school and is also going to donate $ for kids to get school sweatshirts. Awesome man, Dr. Dave Warkentin of Verve Medical Group! Thanks Dave!!!!

My brother in law helped an older lady put groceries in her car at the store the other day, becuase she was having a hard time. When he was done, another older lady walked up and asked if he could help her too (assuming that he worked there:)) He had no problem with helping too. What could have been a 3 minute trip for a gallon of milk turned into 20 minutes of helping a few pople in the parking lot. Thats what its all about!!

My husband and I work at Banner Baywood as volunteer hospital chaplains. We just recently started the job and find it very rewarding but completely exhausting because generally together we have over 35 patients to visit. However, the lady who got us involved in this work, Fran LaFon, always visits 30 to 40 people on her own every Wednesday and is on call on the weekends. She is definitely paying it forward every week.

I just wanted to tell you a story. I am a truck driver and one night in sacromento ca my My son and I were laying over at the truck stop on I-80 it was rainy and cold. We were asleep when someone knocked at our door. I thought it was a girl soliciting her services. I looked out my window and their was a man about thirty or so. I thought a bum. He told me he was broke down on the off ramp I looked. And could see anything. He ask for anything to help. I just wanted him to go and get back to sleep. I told my son to hand me my wallet. All that was inthete was 2 dollars and a hundred dollar bill. I looked at him real hard I still don’t know why but I said merry Christmas and gave it all to him. My son goes are you crazy? The next morning I saw him with a little baby and his wife fixing their car at the shop. He looked at me and said thank you. You never really know why their pan handling we just think their bums not always true

I started the Sewing Project to Help Foster Kids after finding out that children taken out of the home by Child Protective Services were being given black trash bags to put their belongings into.
I thought why not ask people to sew kid-friendly pillowcases with drawstrings that can be given to CPS. Only expecting to receive about 300 kid-friendly pillowcases/dufflebags by the end of the year, I have already received 3,600!! That is only since Feb. 2008! Volunteers from churches, sewing groups, Boy&amp;Girl Scouts, grandparents and just people wanting to help have come forward.
How traumatic is it that a child is being taken out of the home for whatever reason but to have personal things they treasure put in trash bags is also pretty bad.
If you are interested in sewing or might know someone who would like to sew, check out website for patterns.
THANK YOU!

While bike riding south on Greenfield road we came across a lady with a flat tire.
Three of us stopped to change her tire and found that she was from South America and was returning home (7-am) from house cleaning someone’s home. She had her car full of cleaning supplies and felt embarrassed to have us change her tire. She looked worn out. So glad to be able to pay forward what others have done to my wife when she was stranded.

Dave Fuller is the operations manager of the Bay Area Alternative Press where I volunteer my time. BAAP is an all-volunteer printing shop where anyone who wants to learn the craft of printing can come and learn free-of-charge. BAAP provides teachers for Adobe Photoshop, offset printing and other methods along with all printing materials. All people are welcome to print newsletters, books, magazines, calendars, business cards, etc. Dave is the glue that holds BAAP together. He solicits printing materials from the business community, does fund-raising activities, directs all activities, and keeps all of us busy. He has changed lives by the service he gives. People who never had the opportunity to publish are given the gift of printing. Teachers have published newsletters for schools who no longer have funding. Authors who have no outlet for their novels, non-fiction, poetry, papers, etc. now have an outlet to self-publish free-of-charge.

Psalm 23
A psalm of David.
1 The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
2 He makes me lie down in green pastures,
he leads me beside quiet waters,
3 he refreshes my soul.
He guides me along the right paths
for his name’s sake.
4 Even though I walk
through the darkest valley,[a]
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.

5 You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me
all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD
forever.

I work for a resort. One of the guest needed something from the store, but did not have a car. she came to my little gift shop hoping I would have the item. Of course, I did not have it, but I offered to go get the item and bring it back the next day before she checked out. She could not believe I would go to that trouble to do that for her.

I went to the store and got her the item she needed. The next morning, she came by to retrieve the item. She insisted to pay for it, but I said NO. I usually carry the needed item, but had sold out. she was so overwhelmed that someone would do this. She tried to tip me and again I said no. I wanted to do you a favor and told her in the future…..pay it forward to someone else. Just the expresion on her face was payment enough for me.

I coach youth baseball an I enjoy every minute of it. Each kid has a different skill set than the other teammate sitting next to him on the bench. Right now in the current economy, kids/parents are having a tough time paying to play for baseball, because that is what youth sports have turned to. I have been able to help two families by coaching them extra, at no charge, both before practices/games, as well as after practices and games. With families like this, when I see a smile on the kids faces, the smiles are payment in itself. The kids do not really understand what I have done for them, but their parents do.

Not too long ago we found ourselves running out of money before pay day. We paid our bills but there was not much food in the house to eat. Out of the clear blue a couple we were friends with came over to our house and brought several bags of groceries. We were amazed as we had not told anyone that we were running out of food. What a wonderful impact that made on our life.

Psalm 91 (New International Version © 2010)
Psalm 91
1 Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.[a]
2 I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress,
my God, in whom I trust.”
3 Surely he will save you
from the fowler’s snare
and from the deadly pestilence.
4 He will cover you with his feathers,
and under his wings you will find refuge;
his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
5 You will not fear the terror of night,
nor the arrow that flies by day,
6 nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,
nor the plague that destroys at midday.
7 A thousand may fall at your side,
ten thousand at your right hand,
but it will not come near you.
8 You will only observe with your eyes
and see the punishment of the wicked.
9 If you say, “The LORD is my refuge,”
and you make the Most High your dwelling,
10 no harm will overtake you,
no disaster will come near your tent.
11 For he will command his angels concerning you
to guard you in all your ways;
12 they will lift you up in their hands,
so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra;
you will trample the great lion and the serpent.
14 “Because he[b] loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him;
I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.
15 He will call on me, and I will answer him;
I will be with him in trouble,
I will deliver him and honor him.
16 With long life I will satisfy him
and show him my salvation.”

I work for a daycare center and care for children between the ages of 1 and three. They make me smile and I enjoy my job because of them. The pay isnt that well but because of the children I love what I do. My class consist of eleven two year old children and I love and treat all of them the same. One of the little girls that I take extra care of was born with a spinal condition known as Spina bifida. She is paralyzed from the knee cap down and can not walk. She can stand and crawl just perfect. In exchange for my care, she provides me with a smile everyday.

As an occupational therapist in the public school system, I workw ith students that have severe physical and cognitive disabilities. So many of these kids are cast aside by society, they are the kids that all too often we look the other way when we see them in public, or even walk in a different direction. Most of us try to ignore these kids because of our discomfort of the unknown. But, in this setting, I have been blessed with the opportunity to work with a vairety of teachers, instructional assistants, nurses, and other therapists that strive to better the lives of these kids that will never live a life that most of use would consider normal. Everyday is filled with another challenge, another obstacle, or another set back. But each person I work with, approaches each situation as another“opportunity”to better the lives of these kids. IT really is amazing to see what a difference they are making in the lives of so many students.

Paying it forward, for me…can be as simple as:
a) pushing a shopping cart from the parking lot back into the store,
b) taking your neighbors’trash or recycle bins back up to their garage from the curb,
c) filling-up your wife’s car with gas to surprise her,
d) buying two of an item when it’s on sale, and giving one to a friend or charity,
e) writing a note on the back of a restaurant receipt to let the server know what you enjoyed about their service,
f) slowing down when driving, and letting other drivers merge.
Small things…

Many years ago, I was struggling with the horrible disease of Ulcerative Colitis. I had just moved to teporarily moved to Cleveland to complete a project for my employer. I suffered a severe bout of UC and was hospitilized to give“absolute rest”to my colon by having no food or water. This was the course followed I fell out of remission. I had only been there a week and had to pick a gastroenterologist from the phone book. I visited his office and he immediately admitted me to a nearby hospital. The ususl routine is to stay a couple of weeks and without food or water, the disease subsides. That did not happen this time. My colon went into what is called“toxic megacolon”and had to be immediatelty removed or I would not survive. Everyting happened so fast and I was in a town with no family, no friends and so unfamiliar to me. This special doctor that I found in the yellow pages fought hard to have them air-vac me to the Cleveland Clinic where I could undergo a special surgery that would allow me to live without an outside colostomy bag. It involved three surgeries over 2 years. My surgical team was the same one that attended the Pope and Ronald Reagan when they had polyops. That was 18 years ago and I am doing great. I did not know the doctor’s name, the gastroenterologist that first admitted me, and no one could find it any records. I have come to believe that this man was my Guardian Angel”and I now support the CCFA on a regular basis.

Sometimes doing something simple makes a difference in someone’s life. Once while in my car at a fast food restaurant I paid for my order then on the spur of the moment said to the girl taking my money. I would like to pay for the order of the car behind me. It was almost funny to see the face of the person in the car behind me react to the news that her bill was paid for by the person in the car in front. There was no way to say thanks other than just a beep on the horn and a wave. It really made me feel good all that day to know I made a difference in that persons day. Like I said–it was a simple act of kindness!

When I was younger, I had 2 jobs and a 1 year old that I was raising alone. I got into a very bad car accident and had to go to the chiropractor every day. I was struggling financially and felt like I was always working and now in constant pain. I always had to bring my son with me to the chiropractor and the receptionist would watch my son while I would go into the office.
Christmas time came around and I couldn’t afford to get a tree or decorations which made me sad since it would be my sons first christmas. One day when I went into the chiropractors office, the receptionist had boxes for me full of christmas tree decorations and a tree! I was so excited that I cried and gave her a big hug. I felt like she was our angel and I will never forget that for the rest of my life. Something so small in your eyes can be huge in someone elses.

when we first moved to Phoenix we did not have alot of money but we wanted to make sure that our kids were aware that even though we did not have alot of the extras there were people who had less. The 1st christmas were here we took out kids to the Christmas Angels tree at one of the malls and each of my kids picked a child to buy for. We have done this every year for the last 30 years and now I see that as grown children they are of more aware of those that may need help and they are very eager to help them not just with money but their time or what ever help that may be needed

Whenever I go to the any of the ballparks in town that I’m fortunate enough to be in a suite. I wait around until everyone leaves and ask the server for“to go”boxes. I take all the leftovers (that would normally get thrown away) over to an area where the homeless sleep. Most people think twice about what might happen to them if they go near a homeless person. For myself they’re as nice as the person next door, they just don’t have a door to knock on.

I am a blanketeer for Project Linus and love the feeling when I see a child who has received a Project Linus Blanket. I also donate to the foodbank on a quarterly basis to help those less forunate.

Years ago When I was a child, i filled out a piece of paper asking me what I wanted for Christmas. Little did I know that piece of paper was for toys for tots! I ended up getting exactly what I wanted which was a big deal because I barely had anything growing up with parents addicted to heroin. Now I’m am all grown up and never completed the cycle of life that I grew up with. And whenever I get a chance to donate food, help somebody on the street, or buy a kid, like I was, something they for Christmas. I feel that it makes a difference and hope they get to the point they can make a difference in somebody elses life!

Several years ago, I organized poetry event at a downtown Phoenix business. Each week, we highlighted a Valley non-profit organization to help expose their efforts in the community.

During my lowest point in the project, when we were really struggling to keep things afloat financially, we brought in an administratior for the Crittenton Youth Academy in Phoenix.

As an accredited charter school in Phoenix, the Academy provides alternate education services to many of our cities forgotten youth. The Director spoke passionately about the impact of giving kids a“second chance,”and we took up a modest collection of money to help support his efforts in our community.

However, the true blessing was given back to me about a week later when I met the director to give him the few pennies we had collected at the event.“This is great,”he said,“but the scholarships were amazing.”

When I asked him to explain, the Director told me that a high ranking Administrator in the Maricopa County Community College system was attending the event that evening. After the show, she approached him and pledged several college scholarships to many graduates at the Academy.

The Director was quick to point out that such a gift has a monumental impact, some of which we might never see. Not only will the graduates’lives be changed, but so will their children, and their kids’kids, and so on.

In that split second, all our financial struggles seemed really insignificant–when compared to the change we were able to affect.

On any given weekday I am accousted by homeless, during my walk from the bus stop to my job, asking for money. I used to walk away without a second thought.
One day, however, my wife and I came into Phoenix for a baseball game. Before the game, we stopped at a local fast-food restaraunt and ordered our meal. While waiting for our number to be called, I noticed a rather thin and shabbily dressed young man sitting in a corner booth.
He watched the people walk by with their trays of food with very longing eyes. After some time he fell asleep and I used that opportunity to do the proper thing.
I went to the counter and ordered the best meal the restaraunt had and quietly placed it on the table in front of him. I went back to our table and, as we ate our meal, we watched him.
After a few minutes, his nose started to twitch and when he woke up, he saw the meal, looked around to see if he could find the benifactor. My wife and I quietly finished our meal and as we were leaving we noticed him happily devouring the meal and drink.
We did not miss the cost of the meal but throughout the day, and the rest of the week, my wife and I smiled more and held each other a little more closely.
It felt so good to help our fellow man that I now offer any homeless person who asks for money if I can buy them food. 99% of the time they walk away grumbling.
But every now and again, I get a smile and yes.
It feels good to help someone who needs a hand. And, as a side effect, I walk away with a smile on my face.

I am a teacher and absolutely love my job, however, there are times when it saddens me. Especially around the holiday season whenI hear about my students and their families not being able to afford a Christmas. Christmas of 2009 was especially hard for one of my student’s families. My student’s mom had just had a new baby who needed surgery and she had just been diagnosed with Cancer. They were not going to be able to afford to give their kids a Christmas which hurt my heart knowing what this family had already been through. A couple of my other teacher friends and I decided to fill their families stockings and leave them in the front office office with a tag that said“From Santa.”It made me, as well as my friends, feel so great!!

Big or small anyone can pay it forward!

An acquaintence of mine, (she was a customer at my Pet Store) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her husband had passed away several years earlier and she had no living relatives, except for a son who told her he would not take care of her or help her. She called me to come visit her and I felt sorry for her because she was all alone and needed care and couldn’t afford a caregiver. To make a long story short, in the beginning she would call me whenever she needed help and I would go over right away. But as the cancer progressed, she needed someone with her all time. I decided to stay with her at her home. She was so grateful for the companionship I gave her. Even in the middle of the night when she would call out for help, she always said I am sorry to bother you and always thanked me. She was a very proud, intelligent woman and I learned so much from her in the months that followed. We were merely acquaintences at the beginning, but I came to love and respect her over the last six months of her life. She was so brave throughout the whole ordeal. It made me feel good to be there for her, so she didn’t have to spend her last months alone and scared and sad. She told me stories of her life in happier times and things she did when she was young, bowling, playing golf, cooking. It was an experience I will never forget. I was there for her to carry her to the bathroom, to clean her up when the pain medicine made her sick, but she gave as much to me as she received. She taught me the meaning of true friendship, how to die with dignity and honor and I will never forget her. I know she is in heaven and probably smiling down at me. It fills my heart with happiness to know that I made a difference in her life, that because I was there for her, her last six months on this earth were as happy as possible. She was a hospice patient, but I had always promised her that she would stay in her home where she wanted to be because she hated hospitals. I had to increase her doses of morphine as each week went by and the pain became more and more unbearable. One day when the hospice nurse came to check on her, she pulled me aside and said do you realize that she is hanging on for you because she knows you don’t want her to die. I was very surprised, but after thinking about what the nurse had said to me, the next morning I was holding her in my arms and I said to her“Jimmie, I love you very much and if you want to go be with God, it is okay with me”. She got this real peaceful look on her face and within minutes, she was gone. I will always remember ourtime together and fell peace in my heart because she was never alone and our friendship is something I will always treasure.

I was heading up north through cordes junction and stopped at McDonalds. I noticed a man and woman in ragged clothes sitting outside and they looked very tired and dirty. I asked them if they were hungry and they said yes. I told them I would bring them some food. I was waiting inside for a while because of a long line and my order was wrong so it took a long time to get my food. When I came out and gave the couple thier food, they both started to cry. They thanked me and said that they were homeless and that alot of people will say they will help and never come back or they will berate them and make fun of them. They shook my hand and said thank you. I have given food to people before but that one sticks out because they were genuinely thankful.

I know what you mean. My wife and I came to Phoenix for a ball game and we stopped at one of the local McDonalds to eat before the game. When we entered I noticed a very bedraggled and dirty young man who was sitting in a corner booth, just watering at the mouth at all of the food passing him by. No one payed any attention to him. I ordered our food and when I came back, he had fallen asleep. That’s when I went to the counter and ordered the biggest meal on the menue. I quietly placed it on the table in front of him and went back to my wife to eat our meal. While we ate, I watched his nose start twitching and he woke up to see the food. He never knew where it came from but he devoured it like a starving hound. Since then, I will not give money, but I always offer to buy a meal. Most of the times I get turned down because they just want the money. But, every now and again, I run across someone who is truly hungry and will take me up on my offer.

Four years ago I lost my husband to cancer. He so wanted to die at home and I wanted so badly to make that happen for him. I nursed him for three years, but at last came the day when he fell into a coma and I did not know how to do the personal things that were necessary to keep him comfortable and at home. From out of the blue a wonderful woman who lived upstairs, who had a handicapped adult daughter at home, knocked on my door and said,“I have heard that you need me.”She stayed with me night and day for ten days attending to the needs of both my husband and her daughter. She was then my guardian angel and she always will be. Her work with her daughter enabled her to be with me for the comfort of my husband and I will always be grateful.

I’ve been to Phoenix Children’s Hospital and seen how the people are. I want to say from the doctors down to the nurses, the People at PCH do everything they can to make it comfortable there. You can see that when children have to stay a while in the hospital the generosity and kindness of the staff make it an easy adjustment.

Recently, a friend of mine shared a story with me about what she has done to“pay it forward”. There was a homeless woman in the neighborhood we live in. This woman knocked on my friends door asking for money and rather than giving money, she fed the homeless woman. The woman came back a few more times and had dinner. Then my friend would not see and get worried…so she would go look for her, find her, and bring her home to feed her. Months then went by without seeing her and my friend was worried. About 6 months later the woman returned to her house in a car and she had gotten her life back in order based on the conversations she had had with my friend each time she came home. What a great story!

recently a friend with no family or friends had to spend two weeks in the hospital-about half the time in icu. I virtually lived at the hospital, spending many nights even she rarely knew I was there. Though there were many factors involved, I know alcohol played a major role. After helping her out for a while, I’ve decided to“go sober”myself and hope to influence her future this way.

My niece, Kristen was attacked by a chimpanzee at a primate rescue that she was interning at, she lost one of her thumbs during the attack, which was bitten off, and it brutally beat her. She now suffers from PTSD (Post Trumatic Stress Disorder)from the attack. She has formed a PTSD group that she holds for civilians and veterans at the VA hospital in Phoenix. This has become a vital tool in her recovery and the ability to help others with their PTSD. Thats not the whole story though, Kristen started to visit some of the vets that are patients at the VA and has befriended some. Through the course of this, she asked my mother (her Grandmother) if she would be willing to make quilts for the veterans there, in which my mother joyfully agreed to do. All done as a gift to the veterans for their service. To date, my mother has made nearly 6 or 8 quilts for the veterans, and Kristen passes them out before her meetings at the VA. Kristen and I are also in the process of creating a group called Adopt A Vet, that will afford the opportunity for anyone to be able to spend time with a vet in the hospital, just to visit or give company too. I know alot about this, I am a disabled vet, who also suffers from PTSD, and have seen how lonely veterans can be, and all done by Kristen, expecting nothing in return, but the healing that becomes therapy. So Kristen and my mother are truly paying it forward, expecting nothing in return.

My wife pays it forward every day; neither one of her jobs appreciates her for what she is really worth, but she keeps giving 110% because she believes that she can make a difference in the lives of her students. At the end of the semester, she inevitably gets cards from the students whose lives she has impacted, but the administration abuses her kind heartedness and walks all over her, and being the person that she is she smiles and keeps plugging away, trusting that the impact that she’ll make will be a positive one, and that outweighs the negativity that she experiences from the administration at the school.

Today my wife and I moved our oldest into the dorm to start her college career. We don’t really know how we are going to pay for 4 years of college at a private institution much less 4 more years of medical school after that. It is kind of scary. We have kind of been looking forward to getting her out on her own as she can be a real handful at times and the friction with her younger sister can be a problem. Three weeks ago my daughter’s best friend began staying at our house a couple nights a week due to some family issues, but on last Friday the issues exploded into something worse when her stepmom called and and began accusing her of taking something inconsequential from their house and after 20 minutes of screaming and crying ultimately told her not to come home. Ever. I don’t know where this road will take us, but for now we seem to have added a daughter to our home when we thought we were letting one slip out into the world. FAMILY OF 4 OR RATHER 5 I GUESS

I have been a volunteer at a hospital for over eighteen years and during that time I had breast cancer and went through a year of treatment. Since then when patients come into the hospital who have to go through all of this they are scared of the unknown. I talk to them and have them ask me questions that they usually do not ask the Dr., since I have been through it all I could answer their questions and it puts them at ease and my first words are to tell them to be positive and stay that way and not let anyone who is negative to get through to them. I also talk to some of the families with the Doctors permission so they will know there is hope and it is only a breast and we can live our lives without it.

When you loose your hair, it comes back and looks great. You can take a shower and not worry about wetting your hair and the shower feels great on your head.
Thinking only positive makes what you are going through so much easier.

Sometimes I hear back from some of the people and it makes both of us feel good.

I am a Truck driver/Instructor. While sitting in traffic on east bound Buckeye rd. and 35th ave in phoenix I observed a large motor home stalled in the middle of the intersection north bound, traffic was a total mess, as I sat there listening to the radio I observed the driver of the vehicle poring gasoline in to the carburetor (thinking to myself this is not going to be good) the man then tried to start the vehicle and the engine back fired shooting a pretty large flame thru the carburetor lighting the fuel the driver had spilled all over the driver area and ground where the half full gas jug sat. I was 150 yards away, I jumped out of my semi grabbing my fire extinguisher as I went, sprinted towards the fire shaking then pulling the ring on my extinguisher, I hit the motor home and ground beneath it with good long blast knocking the fire out turned to my left where the fuel can was sitting with the spout on fire and hit it with a short blast putting it out, then I ran back to my truck took a bow towards the people clapping then got in to my truck and left. The look on the Motor home Drivers face was priceless as I drove by he looked like he had not gotten by the shock of the fire let alone how fast it had been put out. I am sure he was thinking where the heck did that guy come from. And for me that was the best part, like superman coming out of nowhere and then gone before you even get a chance to say thank you. I hope that everybody that witnessed that day where inspired by the selflessness of that act and pay it forward

I had taken my husband to a hair salon because he needed a haircut. There was also a little boy that was there by himself. As my husband was in the back getting the cut, the boy was finished and he went up to the front to pay. The haircut was $12, and he looked in his pocket and was counting his money and he only had a couple of dollars. He looked so worried, and i felt so bad for him so of course I signaled to the lady to just“put it on my tab”. She just told the boy,“today it will only be $1″. He looked so relieved, and happily surprised that he still had a little money left. It was just a haircut, but it made me feel all warm and fuzzy!

Well it was AZ in the middle of the summer, I wasn’t about to let a grandmother come change a flat, but I also couldn’t leave this young lady and her child on the side of the road. I towed them off the freeway and into a hotel at the next exit. I changed the tire and as I finished, the grandmother showed up. She tried to pay for my trouble, but I refused. She turned to her granddaughter and said“See, there are a few Gentlemen left in this world.”That was payment enough for me. (This story always makes my mom smile from ear to ear)

We shop for my mom often. Last week we had bought about $200.00 worth of groceries for her. When we used her card we realized it was overdrawn. So my husband decided to use his debit card to pay for the groceries.

I was going down the freeway and saw a Mercedes off the side of the road. A lady was standing there looking down at a flat tire bewildered. I also noticed a couple kids sitting in the back seat. I pulled off to the side and proceeded to change her tire. My dad raised me to help anyone that needs it. It is a great experience to give and not recieve!

my story is different.my boyfriend of seven yrs now has given me the oportunity to take care of his dad when he became ill about 5 yrs ago he came home one day and said that the nurse had asked him if there was anyone at home that would b able to learn how to change his iv at home and he said that he would like it if i would do it.and so i accepted back then i had worked for a furniture stor as a csr and when i got the chance to take care of my boyfriends dad it made me realize that i liked helping others so he incouraged me to go to school for medical assistant and he talked to the nurse who would come to the house to show me how to change his fathers iv and told her that i was interested in working in her profession and if she an help me and so she did and i graduated in 2006 and he supported me and my kids while i was going to school and i just want to thank him for giving me this oportunity.

I recently helped a man that was visably mentally challenged. He was ordering a meal at subway and he could not carry his cane with him. I helped him move it to a table and he thanked me for my help. It made me feel like helping more people!

My Grandpa died from cancer. So when I can, I donate to the cancer charitys. I encourage others to get involved any way they can. life is to short so when u can tell your loved ones how much they mean to you before you never get the chance too.

Recently we were on vacation in Idaho. I thought I knew the right way to go but as I kept going, I realized I was going the wrong way. I called for directions and much to my dismay, my cell phone died and so did my husbands. So stuck and no way to find out which way to go. A truck pulled up behind us and a very nice man got out and actually took us to the exit we should take and led us through the town in the right direction. He had previously helped 3 young men along the road and put gas in their car. They asked him if they could repay him and he had told them to just stop and help the next guy. They stopped on the highway, right after the man did too! So we had more help than we needed and we were on our way because someone cared enough to stop. I will want to stop and help when I see someone along the road now.

My cousins 17 year old son was diagnosed with autism many years ago. Even though he has his problems, he is one of the most intelligent and caring people I know. Two years ago he actually started his own non-profit to help the homeless and hungry. He started by getting family and friends together once a month to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to donate, and it has grown exponentially from there. I am so proud of him!

A few years ago I watched as an elderly gentleman was leaving a supermarket with two large bags of groceries. As he walked out of the parking lot first one then the second bag broke. I went over to him with some empty bags helped him pick the items up and then gave him a ride home since he had no car.

My family has been a great influence on me. My dad is a pediatrician, sister a paramedic, and i’ve watched and helped with charitable projects with my mom. Some such as charity exercise events, habitat for humanity, boys and girls club, united way, make a wish, and projects with the zoo. I’ve learned what you can receive when you give.

My stepmom Rhonda has a very kind heart. Our family takes an annual trip to Carlsbad, CA to escape the heat. In many years we’ve run into a man living on the streets named Roger. He will do street performances by the beach to earn money but still needs the kindness of strangers to get by. One year while walking on the way to get ice cream he asked us for money because he was hungry; my stepmom invited him to join us instead which he accepted. She wanted to show him compassion and not give him the means to fuel possible addictive purchases. While I didn’t see him this year I looked for roger, and wherever he is I hope he is happy. I have this memory thanks to Rhonda.

Just Monday I found a womans wallet in the parking lot…having lost mine before and had the hassles of replacing everything and canceling everything I felt her pain. It had Drivers license,AARP card,check and SS card,however NO phone # and addresses were different. I wanted to return it. Called AARP and was told couldn’t release information but that no phone number was listed anyway. SO I looked for phone number in Dex. None. Determined I mapquested address on license.It was far from me,but I knew the area. I went to the house. As I was holding the wallet and ringing the door She immediately swung it open and hugged me.”MY WALLET!”She was so happy I knew my effort made a difference.

My mother is the most inspirational person I know. She has gone through most of her adult life taking care of loved ones that have fallen ill. Her father had a stroke years ago, he lived with us at the time, so she stepped in and handled all of his medical needs until he passed away. Soon after that, my father’s mother was simply too old to be on her own, so without hesitation, my mother moved her in and took care of her until she to passed away (90 years young). A few years later, my step grandfather was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, although he didn’t live with us, my mom was at his house every day to take care of him and make him as comfortable as possible. You would think that’s all she could handle, however 15 years ago, my father, her husband of 30 years became ill and yes, she took care of him. My mother has never asked for anything, but deserves more than life has given her. I know there is a plan for her and our family is certainly lucky to have her in our lives. What is mom doing now? You guessed it, she just moved her mother in with her because at 95, living on her own was no longer an option.

My son in law was recently approached by a woman who asked if he would give her some money to pay for gas to get home. He agreed to meet her at the gas station across the street and she was able to fill up her tank of gas to get home. She was very grateful and appreciative. It shows that he was willing to give even though he’d get nothing in return from a total stranger.

I lost my mom 1 year ago on the 31st of this month. She past away at age 76 from ALS. I spent the last year and 1/2 helping my dad take care of her. I would spend one week at home with my family of 8, then take my 4 year old with me for a week with my mom and dad. It was one of the hardest things, but most rewarding things, I have ever done. I miss my mom so very much, but I know I will see her again, and so will you. Keep them in your heart always and they will help you when you really need them. Kimberle

I have a friend that works with Youth at Risk that is so inspiring. She is very dedicated to her children. And works many hours mentoring, fund raising, etc. They take weekend trips to camps in the mountains. Every time I talk with her, she has a new story about a child of risk, and how they are working toward giving them tools to change there lives. Recently one of the girls she has been mentoring graduated from high school. She worked very hard with this girl. I am greatful there are people in the world like Heather.

Several years ago, I lost my mother and sister to cancer in less than six months time. Three months after my mom passed, I woke up in the middle of the night completely paralyzed on my left side and doctors discovered three tumors in my brain. I had to relearn many things including how to walk again. My outlook on the future was pretty bleak. Starting with baby steps, I began to get back on my feet by volunteering for different things that mattered to me. My outlook on life changed completely. I stopped“sweating the small stuff”by helping others. Within a year, I was able to return to work in my chosen career–something doctors told me not to hope for. Depression no longer ruled my life.

In the last year, I lost more family. My nephew committed suicide in June and my brother was broken. He took his life in March.

I am deeply saddened by their inability to find a less permanent solution to their pain. Thankfully, I still have my volunteer work and the ability to turn my sadness into something positive.

My faith, judaism, teaches us not to call attention to ourselves for our good deeds (mitzvahs) I try to perform mitzvahs as often as possible–whether it’s holding the door for someone or giving a friend a ride–I hope others can find hope in my message.

At the age of 35, with no family history of cancer of any kind, my wife felt compelled to get a mammogram. A woman’s intuition perhaps. Her doctor told us that 35 was early by most medical standards for someone without history or symptoms to undergo a mammogram but she agreed to authorize the test anyway, just to set my wife’s mind at ease.

The test was done and the scan was read and our lives were changed forever. That was the day radiologist Dr. Claire Columbo diagnosed my wife with breast cancer. If it wasn’t for Dr. Columbo’s expertise, patience, diligence and compassion, my wife’s condition would likely have gone undiagnosed until it was too advanced for treatment.

It’s been over four years now–a few surgeries, several months of radiation, countless mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI’s, and pills galore–and my wife is doing great! We both owe this doctor immeasurable gratitude and I personally owe her my wife! Every year on the anniversary of the diagnosis I send flowers to all of her doctors to say thank you for another year with my wife.

Please take a moment in the day to thank those in your life who rarely receive thanks but are so deserving. You’ll be glad that you did and so will they.

I want to give a big shout out to a man named Roland Glover, a college professor of mine who literally changed my life by taking a personal interest in my future.

Our son and his now almost two-year-old daughter moved back in with us last year when things went sour with mommy. I never thought I would be juggling work, teenagers in college and a new baby, but having a baby in the house again has been amazing. I know our son is grateful that his family is able to be there for him and his beautiful child, but we are definitely the ones who get the most out of the arrangement.

In July, a man named Jeff P. from Mesa stopped on the side of the 101 freeway to help my wife and I change a blown tire. I was heading into work and my wife and children were dropping me off. He noticed that our hands were quite full and that I was in nicer looking clothes rather than my weekend shorts and tee. He took 20 minutes out of his day to help us out. We are quite thankful that there are still many good Samaritans out there. Thanks, Jeff!

Our church’s youth group had a retreat in Flagstaff a couple weeks ago that involved over 40 kids and sponsors. The ages were Jr and Sr High. I was“kitchen help”. The bonding that occurred among the kids was amazing. The age and gender differences were erased as ALL realized that they were going through so many similar things. They learned how important it is to watch out for one another and to have accountability partners for the upcoming school year. The caring and sensitivity they showed for one another was life changing for the kids and“helpers”alike!

After going through a few losses a few years back i was left with disposable income that i felt the need for to use in a positive manner. I went to the local safeway whom just happen to have a sale on different can goods and acquired four shopping carts full of food. When the teller asked me what this was for i told her it was part of my stock pile just in case then winked at her. I also advised her that i would require several paper bags for my grocery items. Later on that night my two year old son and future wife divided these items into several different bags then proceded to load them into our SUV. I then went to several different locations i knew where homeless familys were always seen by either myself or family members and at 10pm delivered said items with a few envelops stuffed with fives and tens to these individuals with notes attached to every bag stating”don’t give up!!!”

My dad found a wallet with $600.00 dollars inside. We were very poor and that would have surely helped our family. My father said the right thing to do would be to return it to the righful owner . He spent days tracking down the person that had lost the wallet and returned it. Such a great lesson to learn at an early age. I am in my seventies now and still remember that lesson my father taught me.

While getting involved in painting my daughter’s room, I had to return several times to Home Depot to get paint, supplies etc. The paint guy was very grouchy and unhelpful on one of these visits. I felt like telling him off and leaving, but the words“What Would Jesus Do”stuck in my head, and instead I asked“are you having a bad day?”. He proceeded to reveal the source of his frustration. I calmly ordered what I wanted and walked away while he mixed the paint. When I returned, he said“here’s your paint, and I’m not charging you for this gallon. I was rude and you were only trying to be nice to me”. I cannot tell you how it felt! It again reaffirmed that when you are faced with a difficult person/situation, approach it (react) calmly and you’ll see an entirely different outcome! Stay Positive!

My girlfriend’s mom and dad have shown me and many other people so much kindness. They love God, people, nature, and family. Recently her mom was stricken with a flesh eating bacteria in both her legs. She has endured 18 surgeries since July 4 and has encountered many complications. She is still not out of the woods and the doctors just told her that she will have to endure more surgeries once again every other day for the month of August. She has basically lost the whole upper right thigh muscle. Anyway–her bills have reached over $1,000,000.00 and she has no health insurance at this time and was denied for public assistance even after appealing the denial.

Because of this–I have started a fund raiser for her and her husband to try to help them and give them back every kindness they ever showed myself and so many others.

Please visit http://www.giveforward.org/helpforalice and give if you are able. If you can’t give–it’s ok–but Please Pray For Her.

Thanks for listening.

My wife found a woman’s purse in a shopping cart at Costco in Southern California. She took it into the Costco Store where the manager looked inside to get ID, called the person who had just got home and could not find her purse. She returned to the store within a few minutes. She was an elderly lady who had just withdrawn $5,000 from her bank to go on vacation. The money was in her purse. She offered my wife $500 reward. My wife refused and told the lady to have a wonderful vacation.

A few years back, vacationing in Rocky Point, we were sitting on beach with 100′s of people around. Our 10 year old came up and said a boy was laying in the sand not moving. Went down and say he had been tunneling in sand and it collapsed on him. Only his feet were sticking out. We immediately starts to shove sand away and my wife eventually pulled him out by his ankles. He was solid blue/purple in face. Cleared his nose and mouth of sand and he started breathing again. 8 yr old boy left on beach with friends while parents went to town. Pls don’t leave kids unattended on beach and most important DO NOT let them build tunnels. Be careful of holes too. There is not air in sand!

Family is the solution to all of your problems. My wife and I were going through a tough stretch of emotions and issues. We decided to get away from everything including work, finances, and even the kids for a few days. We eventually treated ourselves to a much needed week vacation with family in Northern California. It’s funny how family can sense tough times even if you don’t express your feelings openly. They knew my wife and I needed rest and relaxation so we were given full run of their resort-style home and backyard and pampered for a week. After encouraging words of wisdom and a couple of days away from the kids my wife and I are back home and enjoying each other more and cherishing the time we spend together and with our kids. We understand the importance of good family structure and thank are parents for not letting us forget how important family is in a time of need.

In todays ecomony families and lives are being torn apart.
So two weeks ago I received a call from, from a young person to ask if they could come and live with me and my spouse, as an individual who’s semi-retired, didn’t have to think about. We talked to her mother with some long conversations and hard questions.

Recived all the legal doc’s, school transcripts, shot records we needed,went to the HS.for registration,standing in line waiting to talk with guidence person, have flash backs of having to doing the same for my children, laughing to myself. Needless to say this young person will have a stable life style for the next 4 years and then on college.

If anything, this you person will keep help to keep US a littl younger and I’m sure we’ll receive a few more grey hairs from this experience. Put it’ll be worth it.

So remember no matter how bad we might think we have it, their’s always someone out their that needs a hand.

Before I retired I was a dentist. I had a lady come into my office that would not smile, and covered her mouth with her hands when she spoke. Well after diagnosing her case, she needed lots of crown and bridge dentistry which she could not afford. So I decised to see if I could achieve a smile with no hands in the way, and natural smile. I worked out a payment plan; which I never did, discounted my fees,and began the work in the front of the mouth. After several long appointments, I completed the work, that affected her smile. I handed her a mirror, watched her look at herself, she began smiling ear to ear. What a sense of satisfaction I felt. My heart felt an amazing happiness-so good. She smiled, and smiled, and smiled; she could not stop looking in the mirror at herself and smiling. She, instantly, became more confident. What a difference, her life had been changed for the better.

I have always felt education is one of the greatest knowledges you can have.

On one occasion i was involved with a person that had struggled thur life too getting a higher education. This was very hard, with a job, married with children. trying to move up in his work place with a better job he needed a master degree. So everytime it was time to start classed: to enroll, something would come up as life does happen and he couldn’t make the time in his busy schedual due to previous commenments.

I offered and did go for him and get him ENROLLED pick up his books, assigment, scheduals, etc.
this worked for him. That year he didn’t have to pass up ANOTHER semenster getting on his way to finish his education and his degree.

It’s amazing how quickly our children can change our lives…and they don’t even realize it. Yesterday, I had a really bad day (I am sure we have all had these). I came home from work and I all I wanted to do was to be alone. My daughter sensed that I was upset. She came up to me and gave me a hug and then asked me if I’d like to hear a joke. I told that I would love to hear her joke so she says,“Why did the tomato blush? Because he saw the ranch DRESSING.”

It took me a second, but then I couldn’t stop laughing. Within 30 seconds my daughter changed my mood and at that moment she changed my life. I have been thinking about her joke today and when I do I can’t help but smile!
