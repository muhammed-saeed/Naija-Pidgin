McDonald&apos;s waste makes up largest proportion of fast food litter on streets

Wrappers and cups from McDonald’s meals make up nearly a third of fast food 
 litter on Britain’s streets, according to a survey.

Keep Britain Tidy looked at litter in 10 cities over two days in the first 
 attempt to discover which brand names were most commonly discarded.
 Wrappers and cups from Mcdonald&apos;s meals make up the largest proportion of litter on Britain&apos;s streets, according to a new survey. 
Fast food litter was second to cigarette ends in littering the country’s 
 streets and 29 per cent of that was from McDonald’s restaurants, followed by 
 boxes and cups from unbranded kebab and fast food shops. Greggs the bakers 
 generated almost a fifth of the fast food litter, followed by Kentucky Fried 
 Chicken, Subway and a number of coffee brands.
 
Keep Britain Tidy said fast food companies should be doing more to ensure that 
 the country’s streets were tidier.
 
Phil Barton, its chief executive, called on them to reduce unnecessary 
 packaging, make eating inside their restaurants a more attractive option, 
 encourage customers to use a bin, offer money off to people who returned 
 packaging and provide more bins.
 
“We condemn litterers for dropping this fast food litter in the first place 
 but also believe the results have pertinent messages for the fast food 
 industry,”he said.“McDonald’s, the local chip shop, Greggs, KFC and Subway 
 need to do more to discourage littering by their customers.

“Fast food makes up a quarter of all litter found on our streets. We want fast 
 food chains to play a more active role in delivering an anti-litter message 
 at the point of sale.”

McDonald’s has signed up to the Government’s voluntary code on reducing 
 litter, which includes reducing packaging and encourages customers to 
 dispose of litter correctly.

A spokesman said its outlets sent out teams to pick up litter within 100 yards 
 at least three times a day and full-time­litter-pickers were being 
 considered. McDonald’s has done more than most fast food companies to tackle 
 litter,”he said.

Cathy Parker, of Manchester Metropolitan University, said customers could be 
 put off by seeing branded litter.

“There is clear evidence that seeing litter with a company’s brand on can 
 negatively affect the public’s perception of that brand,”she said.

“There is, therefore, a good commercial reason why fast food operators should 
 take more of an interest in what happens to their packaging once it leaves 
 their premises.”

Ben Stafford, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said:“Of course, we 
 should not excuse the slovenly and irresponsible behaviour of people who 
 drop litter but fast food outlets need to raise their game by cutting back 
 packaging, supplying more bins and encouraging customers to eat in rather 
 than taking packaging out on to the streets, where it all too often ends up 
 on the pavement or in the gutter.”

The amount of rubbish dropped in Britain has risen by 500 per cent since the 
 1960s, with fast food waste the most common problem after smoking-related 
 litter.

The findings of Keep Britain’s Tidy are another blow to McDonald’s, which has 
 been criticised in the past for fuelling childhood obesity and damaging the 
 environment.

National Gutter Share–the most littered fast food brands in England:

1/ McDonald&apos;s–29 per cent

2/ Unbranded fish and chips/kebab–21 per cent

3/ Greggs -18 per cent

4/ KFC–8 per cent

5/ Subway–5 per cent and other branded coffee 5 per cent (joint place)
