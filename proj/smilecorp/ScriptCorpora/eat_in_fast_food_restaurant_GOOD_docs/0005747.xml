Gabapentin taken with RedBull eneregy drink?
 Posted: 13 Jun 2010 by sidsydney Topics: gabapentin Details: 
I&apos;v been taking Gabapentin for at least a month now. I also have been drinking Red Bull in the mornings after I take one 400mg of Gabapentin. Today after I drank the Red Bull, a couple hours later I felt dizzy and my hands where shaking. Can the mixture of gabapentin and red bull cause the dizziness?

red bull itself can cause dizziness you should ask your doctor about the combo

probably because gabapentin is for nerve pain and it has lots to do with nerve endings in pain and redbull is a stimulant so it very well can be the mixture that causes the dizziness

You should never mix Red Bull or any drink like it with your medications. Its like mixing speed with your meds. It can be a dangerous combination, and have very bad side consequences. Red Bull, and the likes, are meant to hype up your body and&quot;rev up&quot;your engine, so to speak. They can cause damage to your heart with repeated use. Please be careful. Depending on the medication, this can become a very lethal cocktail. Take care of yourself.
Peace, Tee

No never mix with any energy drinks or alchol as they enter the blood system too fast and cause adverse effects, also these drinks can mess with your blood sugars which is also bad for you and can lead to diabeties. Take care

taurine a non essential amino acid for humans, only for cats can cross the blood brain barrier and completely mess up Gabapentin you likely started to feel the beginning of it&apos;s absence or withdrawal.
