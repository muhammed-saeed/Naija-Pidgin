Resume and Job Questions?
 
 I&apos;m going to be applying around for a job to save up money for art school. I&apos;m going to be applying for random, low level things. (video rental store, retail, or fast food as a last resort) I have had a job before (gas station attendant), but it didn&apos;t require a resume. So I have a few questions I&apos;d appreciate answered.

1. Should I worry about having an overly fancy resume for such a basic job? Or should I just give basic information?
2. Should I put on a career objective, even if it&apos;s nothing related to what I&apos;m applying for? (I want to be an animator) Or would it be better to omit that and put it under interests?
3. How should I present my resume? Walk into the building and ask for the manager? Or a supervisor? And then say, &quot;I&apos;m looking for a job?&quot;
4. In case I&apos;m not offered a job at all at a particular place, should I bother reapplying later?

Thanks for any help!

 Most of those types of jobs will hand you an application, make sure to ask, are you hiring, because by law they have to hand you an application even if they are not hiring, so why waste time on it.
Try to find some examples or use a temp agencies website, they all have ones you can fill in and copy to your hard drive to see formats. Your resume will be short, personal info, dont put your social security number on it.
Your education.
Your goals, to provide excellent customer service, exceed job expectations, be a team player and can work well alone, to get the required task done correctly and on time, something like that.
You can apply online at so many places, I do it while watching tv. Sears for example, you apply, they show you the stores hiring and the positions you pick one and it actually sets up and appointment with you to come in to interview, its the only one out of all the stores I did that was that good. But take advantage of doing it at home, why sit at Walgreens on their computer if you can do it at home right!
Good luck, remember, the hours you put down to work, are the ones they will make you work, if you really need sundays off, do not put it on thinking you call tell the mgr not to schedule that day when they call for an interview, be realistic for better results.
It can take a week,to never, to hear from a company too. So just keep applying. I was hired at a grocery store and a pharmacy type store after not hearing from them for a month , in 3 weeks, I got the one full time job, then next week the pt job, I kept them both for a few months and quit one because I didnt like it that much and it was too many hours in one week.

Other Career Questions
 
 What does it take to get a job?!? Any job, even fast food. I want a part time job so bad. I&apos;m 20 years old, I have a high school diploma, and I&apos;ve been in college two years. I&apos;ve never been convicted of a felony, I&apos;ll take and pass drug tests, I can work up to 30 hours a week, including weekends. I applied at a freaking truck stop as a coffee station attendant and was told I didn&apos;t meet their qualifications. I just want to make some amount of money to be able to contribute to my family until I finish school. What does it take to get a job these days? How can I get job experience when no one will hire me? There are like 15 year old working at the local Dairy Queen yet I can&apos;t get hired there? Sorry for the rant but I mean really. Has anyone else had any similar problems at some point?
Said by someone in a wrestling mask that can&apos;t spell hire.... 2 answers - Asked By: megan r - 1/30/2009 Working at Target? Worst Job ever? I realllllly need a job right now. I used to work at Wendy&apos;s in PDX (Portland OR,) airport. I was there for at least half a year, and really disliked my experience. The people working with me were great! They were friendly, helpful, and chill people. The job itself and the company really sucked. Since I was selling food in the airport, it would get VERY busy, and only I would be the cashier, while the assistant manager &quot;helped.&quot; 

Anyway, I was looking at Target&apos;s job options and saw cart attendant. I&apos;ve heard stories that working at Target is really terrible, sort of like Wal-mart. Cart attendant was actually rated as the worst job. I personally want a job that deals with little customer interaction. I&apos;m really good with people, at Wendy&apos;s I had to serve some hundreds of people, but I am done with that. I really enjoy walking around, and don&apos;t want to be confined in &quot;one spot&quot; like Wendy&apos;s did. I also understand that CA&apos;s clean spills, and bathrooms. I am ok with that as well. Sure cleaning people&apos;s waste would be awful, but here&apos;s the thing, I&apos;d much rather do pick-up, cleaning, or labors jobs than customer service. That&apos;s why I&apos;m not applying for fast-food like Mcdonald&apos;s; I know they would hire me quick.

Should I get the job?
ALEX - Hahaha I&apos;d much rather do that job than work at Wendy&apos;s. Besides, I meant worst job as in, &quot;worst job IN Target.&quot;
Well since I only mentioned Target, and fast-food names, one would guess that only minimum wage, &quot;teen jobs&quot; is what I qualify for but haha sorry about that. Yea I&apos;m still in high school and 17. 4 answers - Asked By: A.I.L.D. - 3/30/2011 I have an important question about how to get a promotion...? In a fast food restaurant; how to get promoted from crew to supervisor..........


There are many different crew positions.....
(front counter, drive-through, cook, dining-room attendant, etc.....)

Let&apos;s say you&apos;ve been in the same job for 5 years or so.....
let&apos;s say you&apos;ve been a cook for 5 years........

Can you get promoted to supervisor?

or are they going to dismiss you for not &quot;having experience in the other areas of a fast food restaurant&quot;....


does that mean: to get promoted. you have to keep switching jobs constantly?
and who the hell gets moved around to EVERY work station? That&apos;s not a common occurrence.
Is it common for crew people to get promoted to supervisor and get trained on the other work stations they haven&apos;t been in?

or are they expected to have prior work experience in EVERY work station?
If so, how is that even possible considering the circumstances where people generally stay in one or two work stations? 2 answers - Asked By: Lois Griffin - 3/12/2011
