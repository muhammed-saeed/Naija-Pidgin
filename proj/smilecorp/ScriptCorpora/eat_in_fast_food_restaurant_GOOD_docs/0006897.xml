 Welcome to Mr. Lee&apos;s Soapbox! 

 Discussing all that matters to you and me. 
 Does Singapore deserve its reputation for cleanliness? mr_kelvin_lee June 22nd, 2010 Dirty after dark, says expat couple 
Does S&apos;pore deserve its reputation for cleanliness?
Letter from Zsolt Vasvari
SOURCE: TODAYonline Updated 07:54 PM Jun 21, 2010 

 I WOULD like to comment on the issue of cleanliness and littering that was recently discussed in Today&apos;s Voices pages.

I am from New York and my wife is Australian and we have lived in the Clarke Quay/Robertson Quay area for the past five years. It is appalling how dirty Clarke Quay has become during this time.

We quite frequently exercise early in the morning along the Singapore River. We are usually out of the house by 6.30am and at that time of the morning, more often than not, the place looks as if a garbage truck had exploded, spilling its contents everywhere.

There are empty bottles, hamburger wrappers, soda cups, vomit and urine on the walls.

There are young people loitering in small groups, obviously having been there the whole night.

There is a small army of cleaners with pressure hoses cleaning the sidewalks, but even after they are done, it is absolutely disgusting how dirty the place looks.

Let me compare it with New York, which, in my opinion, would be an overall cleaner place if it weren&apos;t for the cleaning crews in Singapore.

In the Big Apple, the majority of bars, clubs and other nightspots, close at 2am. In Singapore, many such outlets stay open until dawn.

In New York, it is illegal for anyone under 21 to consume alcoholic beverages in public, a rule which is strictly enforced. On most nights, the sale of wine and liquor is banned after midnight. Not being able to drink in public takes away one reason for loitering.

In America, young people are not brought up with maids who follow them around picking up after them.

In the United States, leaving your garbage on the table after a meal at a fast food restaurant is completely unheard of, and is viewed as socially unacceptable behaviour.

Singapore claims to be the world&apos;s cleanest city. For about 18 hours a day, it&apos;s probably a true statement, but only because of the hardworking cleaners. 

Is this true?

What do you think?

 Singapore - World Champion in Women&apos;s Table tennis! mr_kelvin_lee June 1st, 2010 Hail the world champions 
 Women&apos;s table tennis team get a heroes reception at airport - TODAY Online, 1 June 2010 

There are two groups of people who have different opinions about the matter.

One group says the S&apos;pore team is made up of China-born players and that the victory is a hollow one because Team Singapore wasn&apos;t represented by &quot;True Singaporeans&quot;.

The other group argues that it doesn&apos;t matter where we are born. After all, weren&apos;t our forefathers from foreign lands, too? As long as the pledge allegiance and want to play for Singapore, that&apos;s good enough already.

 Football! mr_kelvin_lee May 28th, 2010 You know that sport that many boys like to play? It&apos;s officially called &quot;football&quot;.

How did the term &quot;soccer&quot; come about then?

In America, &quot;football&quot; usually means American Football .
In Australia, &quot;football&quot; could refer to rugby or Australian Rules Football .

The game that we are all familiar with is called &quot;Association Football&quot;. Which is then shortened to be informally called &quot;Assoc.&quot; and then finally &quot;soccer&quot;.

Big football news to hit the headlines recently:

 They say that there&apos;s no simple formula for success mr_kelvin_lee May 28th, 2010 I beg to differ (slightly)

I do think that there is, indeed, a formula for success. And a simple one.

And it all hinges around one word:

ATTITUDE.

Specifically, YOUR success really depends very much on YOUR attitude to learning.

Think about it. :)

 Have a fruitful holiday! mr_kelvin_lee May 28th, 2010 Time certainly flies fast, doesn&apos;t it? (Those who have already graduated from DLSS will know exactly what I&apos;m talking about)

Especially for the Primary sixes. Suddenly, we&apos;re nearing the end of our primary school adventure.

While our focus for the year is the PSLE, do take the time to appreciate your surroundings, your friends and your teachers.

Even for me, I still remember my primary school days with much fondness. :)

 Getting exam papers back this week mr_kelvin_lee May 17th, 2010 It&apos;s not so much what score you attained for your papers.

This is a time for some deep soul-searching. Ask yourself:

HAVE I PUT IN ENOUGH EFFORT?
Was that *really* my best?

Be attentive, be sincere in your learning.
Make a genuine attempt to do your corrections, ask if in doubt, and test yourself again when you&apos;re done .

Remember, nothing in life that is worth attaining is ever easy to achieve.
You want success? Then you&apos;ll have to work for it.
There&apos;s no other way around it.

However, if you find the going really tough, or are frustrated for any reason, do approach your parents and teachers for help.
We&apos;re here for you. Tags: dlss

 Assembly programme 17 May 2010 mr_kelvin_lee May 17th, 2010 Since today&apos;s assembly item was about art and landscapes, I thought I&apos;d post something related to the topic. Since I&apos;m not a good painter, I&apos;ll post some images instead.

Even though these aren&apos;t paintings like those mentioned during assembly, there are similar features you can spot in these photographs, like the use of perspective (near/far objects), horizon, leading lines, etc.

And yes, these are all taken by me. :)

And of course, well done to the DLSS dance and choir teams for attaining awards at the recently concluded SYF competitions! :) Tags: assembly talk , photography
