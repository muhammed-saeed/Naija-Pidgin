Not only the food is good but also a friendly staff. Fair price to. Thanks Sis. for showing me around. October 5, 2011 A very nice and respectfull manager. The restaurant is not like Sumo, but taste almost the same for a lot less on your hard earning money. The food is not a five dinning, but it‘s not bad. It is something I think I will enjoy going back to. I reccomend the scallop and shrimp combonation dish. I can asure you will enjoy it. September 30, 2011 Lots of people out there want a lot of food for a low cost. Ignore those kind of people. I think you guys are doing well and prices are fair. My family and I never finish our meals. August 19, 2011 I was googling up sushi when I was on the east side of town and Samurai Japanese Grill was recomended. I figure I would give it a try and I am glad I did. I Did not try the sushi but the Yakisoba was wonderful. Scallops are hard to cook but the way Samurai cooked it.....Geat. Afordable prices that will full fill your hunger. August 17, 2011 My friends was right about this place. Taste so much differnt than the other Japanese Grills and a lot cheaper to. It‘s too bad that they only have one location. Read More Reviews August 12, 2011 I had The Glazed Salmon with the side of scallops and shrimps and it was amazing. Great job with the salmon May 9, 2011 need more locations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! April 28, 2011 Lots of great reviews. I had to try it and now i know why. One of a kind ginger sauce. I Love It!!!!! April 27, 2011 Samurai gave me a lot of shrimps with my order. Most places would only give you like 5 or 6 peices of shrimps and lots of vegetables. Good portions and great prices. highly recommended. April 1, 2011 Great deals with seafood and yummy egg rolls March 31, 2011 A bundle of shrimp for under $7. A whole lot more than most Asian restaurants. March 30, 2011 Not too bad. Simple, fast, friendly, and low prices. March 21, 2011 Great Place for a quick lunch. Plus I work at LSI and got a 10% discount. This is one of LSI‘s favorite joint for lunch. I am sure my coworkers will say the same. March 21, 2011 Good, fast, and friendly. Need more locations so I dont have to drive far to eat. March 7, 2011 Not bad at all. Differnt from others, but differnt is good. January 27, 2011 Good food + Good Prices + Good atmosphere + Good service = GOOD RESTAURANT January 27, 2011 A wonderful experience. It‘s fast the food is great. January 26, 2011 Good, Fast, Friendly, Clean,&amp;reasonable prices. Average prices for a meal is $5.75 January 25, 2011 First Japanese Restaurant I went to that is not fancy. The quality of the food is great tho. It‘s clean, friendly, and unexspensive. Not a long wait to get served, unless there is a croud that just walked in at the same time. All restraunts are like that. Come and try Samurai if you haven‘t yet. I‘m sure you will like it if you like asian food as much as I do. I know I will the next time I‘m in town. January 24, 2011 This is where I get my Asian food. It‘s good and healthy. January 19, 2011 It‘s not like Sumo but more of a fast food restaurant. The sauces that they have here is one of the best sauces in any of the asian restaurants around town. Pricing is alot cheaper than most. I mean ALOT CHEAPER. Not something I want to eat everyday but I for sure will be back and reccomended to everyone who doesn‘t like to wait a long time on getting good food. I Wish there was one on the west side of town. January 12, 2011 Not too bad for a fast food japanese grill. December 16, 2010 I‘m a picky eater. I like good food at a low prices. Samurai have the lowest prices on japanese dishes in Wichita. tastey and fast. Made to order just the way you want it. Trust me when I say it‘s good food. I know what good food is. I am a 245 lbs man. You can always count on a fat man‘s word when it comes to food. If you like to do a little bit of bull shi**ing talk to the night manager. That man have a great humor. September 21, 2010 I have a friend that works here and she got me hooked. At first I thought i can‘t be that good, because menu prices are cheap. I was wrong. The Teriyaki is the BOMB.... September 19, 2010 I got reviews from the internet and took a shot at it. Boy am I glad I did. Sushi and Japanese at it‘s best. Great sauce, full of flavors. Recommend it. If you love good food like I do than you will love this place. September 10, 2010 Great food at a friendly price. A lot cheaper and tastier that Sumo May 20, 2007 This place has the best food and best service! resonable prices and a nice, casual place to eat. November 23, 2006 Great value for the food. I eat there once a week at least! August 19, 2006 the best place i‘ve ever eaten at! a favorite hang out for my friends and I. Fast and friendly service and the food is phenomenal!
