 OnStar Antenna « on: July 31, 2011, 04:34:39 PM» 
 My OnStar status LED changes from GREEN (Normal) to RED (Problem). Then in a few days goes back to GREEN (Normal). Dealer check out could find no problem. OnStar test reports trouble code B2470 , antenna issue. LED changed GREEN to RED again twice last week. Each time in a few days the status light goes back to GREEN (normal). Each time OnStar was contacted and ran a diagnostic they came up with the same trouble code. Heading to dealer for recheck in a few weeks. Have others seen this problem?

 It turns red when the onstar battery runs low and begins to charge. Turns back to green when its fully charged.

 There is a battery for the OnStar?

Have you tried pushing the OnStar button when the light turns red?

Hm, good point. I guess RVHAM might be having a problem with that battery then...? just guessing.

 Just in case...The battery is in the spare tire compartment IIRC. I have to check and make sure. It looks like its sealed pretty good but you may want to check the connections. Ill check my location to make sure.

 Here is some info you may find interesting regarding the On* BUB.... 

The BUB is a non-rechargeable, lithium battery with a lifespan of approximately 4 years and is designed to maintain an open circuit voltage between 16V and 9V throughout this period. This allows the battery to power the basic functions of the VCIM for least one 200-second (5 minute) phone call at the end of the 4 year span, should a main vehicle battery loss occur.

The BUB voltage is checked every ignition cycle. If the BUB fails the check or if the BUB has had current drawn from it, the OnStar LED next to the control buttons changes from green to red and a DTC is set, either B1446 or B1447.

Service Precaution

Do not disconnect the vehicle battery with the ignition key in the run position.

With the ignition key in the Run position, the OnStar module is awake on the data bus.
The OnStar module is also awake after the ignition key is removed, until Reserve Accessory Power (RAP) times out, or the driver door is opened. If the vehicle battery is disconnected with the OnStar module awake, the OnStar module senses a vehicle power failure, as could occur in a crash, and draws current from the BUB. When the vehicle battery is reconnected, the OnStar LED is red and a DTC is set. Because the BUB has had a current drain and there is no way of telling how long the drain was, the BUB must be replaced.

Refer to Accessories in SI for OnStar battery replacement information.

 In the pic below...the BUB is in yellow

 Additionally...
The On* BUB (back up battery) is NOT related to the primary car battery...

Also...the BUB is connected TO THE On* module itself...


and...there is some confusion over just what vehicles have an On* BUB...

According to GM&apos;s own information:

 
- Impala and Monte Carlo, 2006 and later

- Equinox and Torrent, 2007 and later

- Vue, Astra and G8, 2008 and later

TIP: Other vehicles may be added at a later date.
 

Please note the Terrain is specifically omitted from the list...
but...
may still have it like the NOX (if one uses logic...sometimes lost by GM)

 Last but not least...

the trouble code reported by the OP...B2470 is not On*BUB related...
B2470 is an antenna related trouble code.

BUB related codes are B1446 or B1447.

 Re: OnStar Antenna « Reply #9 on: August 01, 2011, 04:55:08 PM» 
 ive gotten the red light before (on my Impala).
both time after hitting a bump in the road pretty hard.
Onstar showed it was an antenna related issue.

But both times- after hitting a speed bump and cycling power- the light was green again.
This has happened 2 times in the near 5 yrs weve had our 07.
but each time- with the light red-- we were able to use Turn by turn and call the Onstar operator to run the diagnostics.

 Each time I noticed the OnStar trouble light RED, I contacted OnStar and the system worked. Voice communications was good and a full diagnostic test was performed with only the one code.

The Back Up Battery is a good idea and I was impressed that GM had this feature. BUT, when I went to the dealer, the dealer verified that the 2010 Terrain did not have an OnStar Back Up Battery.

 So what is the little grey thing next to the spare tire? Ive looked up the number on it online and it always comes back to an OnStar battery.

 Help! Please direct me as were to look for the back up battery (BUB) around the spare tire.

To the left rear of the spare is a grey connector on the&quot;Fuel System Module&quot;, but I do not see the back up battery.

Making an appointment this week to take to the dealer. I want to make sure I can point out the battery to the service manager, since he said the Terrain does not have a BUB.

 Only thing visable under the seat is the connector for the power seat and the rear HVAC duct work.

 I do not have a fax. Could you scan and send a pdf to my forum message box or post a picture/pdf?

My OnStar status LED has cycled from GREEN to RED and back to GREEN several times over the past couple of weeks.  

Taking Terrain in for OnStar problem check out on Thursday morning.

 The warranty repair of my OnStar problem has been completed. Repair replaced two coax cables from antenna to the communications control module. The status LED on the mirror has returned to GREEN. 

GM confirmed they do not use an OnStar&quot;back up battery&quot;on the 2010-2012 Terrain/Equinox.
