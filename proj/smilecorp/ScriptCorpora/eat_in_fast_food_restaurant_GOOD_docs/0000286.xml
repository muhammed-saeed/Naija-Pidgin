Quality, Materials, Made in USA

 

What type of glass are your straws made from? Is it safe?

We use borosilicate glass to make our straws and we have taken the 
extra step to have the glass tested by a third-party laboratory to 
verify the safety and integrity of its composition. Here are some facts 
about this type of glass:

 Type of glass discovered in the late 1800s Main ingredients: silica and boron oxide Non-porous and hypo-allergenic Super durability - more resistant to breaking than other glass Used for high-quality beverage glassware and kitchenware (like measuring cups, coffee pots) Both microwave and dishwasher safe BPA-Free and toxin free Borosilicate glass is even used on the Space Shuttle! 

Where are your glass straws made?

We personally hand-make all our glass straws in our own workshop in 
Michigan. We use local and 
environmentally conscious suppliers as much as possible.

Will the colored accents ever wash off or fade away?

No. Whether clear or colored, everything on our straws is glass. 
Unlike plastic straws that fade and leech toxins into your beverages, 
glass straws stay beautiful and toxin-free over and over and over again.

  

Choosing the Right Straw

 

How do I determine what straw to get?

We offer straws in different lengths and diameters as well as 
straight and bent to accommodate the different containers and liquids 
that you may wish to use them with. You basically have four choices to 
make when selecting a straw:

 The length or height of the straw : Measure the height of your container(s) and then make sure the straw will be a little taller. The diameter of the straw : Consider the type of 
beverage(s) that you will use it with. Generally, the thicker the 
beverage, the bigger you want the inside diameter of your straw to be. 
Inside/Outside diameters offered are Skinny (4.5 mm/7.0 mm), Regular 
(5.7 mm/9.5 mm), Smoothie (7.6 mm/12.0 mm) and Bubble Tea (10.0 mm/15.0 
mm).  Straight or Bent : This is a personal preference. 
The only thing to consider here is that either way, it is fixed. Some 
customers get one of each if they can&apos;t decide on one. 

Can you offer more help in determining what straw to get?

For reference, the average/typical plastic straw you would get at a 
fast food restaurant is 8 inches in length and regular in diameter. The 
following list can be used as a rough guide to assist you in determining
 the perfect straw for your container/beverage:
 8&quot; Smoothie - Standard Drinking Cup/Glass, but for thicker liquids
 10&quot; Smoothie - For your thicker liquids in taller glasses like Mason Jars



 Cleaning, Storing, Handling

 

Is it possible to clean these straws without a cleaning brush?

Yes, it is possible to not use a brush. Rinse your straw in hot water
 and wash with soap immediately after use. If you forget to clean it 
right away and the straw dries without being rinsed, you may have 
trouble cleaning the inside if you don&apos;t have a dishwasher. Now you see 
why we offer a cleaning brush! If you are faithful with rinsing/washing 
after each use or have a dishwasher to use for regular cleaning, a 
cleaning brush is not necessary.

One thing to keep in mind with bent straws is that the brush can 
sometimes be difficult to get in bend. We recommend rinsing in hot water
 immediately after use to make cleaning a breeze.

Is it safe to put my straw in the dishwasher or microwave?

Yes, it is safe in either appliance. In fact, you may want to 
sanitize your straw in the dishwasher. Best practice is to set aside a 
silverware compartment just for your glass straws so that they are not 
banging around with the silverware.

If my straw is cloudy, how can I get it back to its original shine?

Take a deep breath and relax. This sometimes happens from hard water 
conditions in the dishwasher. Soak it in distilled white vinegar to 
return the glass to its original beauty. If you have a cleaning brush 
you can use after a short soaking, it will speed the results.

Is there a safe way to store my straw when not in use?

Treat your straws with care. If you put them in a drawer, make sure 
that they will not be disturbed by other items in the drawer. We recommend that you keep them out in the open to show them off! Your 
guests will comment and your family will use them more if they are handy
 and out in the open. Putting them in a glass or glass jar so that they 
are easy to access is the way to go. On the window ledge above the sink,
 on the counter, table, bar, or buffet; or even on a shelf behind a 
glass door are some great suggestions.

Can my straw chip or crack easily under normal use? 

No, but treat your straw like any other glass item in your home. Some
 people think glass straws are unbreakable and that is not true. They 
are made of the strongest commercially available glass that we can get 
our hands on, but that doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t break. Just like you 
wouldn&apos;t purposely drop a glass on the tile floor, treat these straws 
with some care. If you ever notice any chipping, cracking or breakage, 
stop using the straw immediately. Under normal use, your straw will last a long time and become an enjoyable beverage accessory.
 
Why Reusable Straws?

Here are ten reasons (in no particular order) why reusable glass drinking straws are the way to go:

 Concern about plastic usage is at an all-time high. Glass drinking 
straws are one way to limit your exposure to toxins from plastics 
because they are toxin-free! No BPAs, phthalates, etc.

 If you use straws a lot, think about how many plastic straws you 
throw in to a landfill every year. Including the instances you dine out
 at restaurants this number can be astronomical! Being green has never 
been so easy. Replacing your disposable plastic straws with a glass 
straw is one little thing you can do to help save our planet.

 The feeling of glass on your lips will help you lose weight on your 
hips! Not only is it fun to drink from a glass straw but studies have 
shown that drinking from something more substantial than plastic may 
help you lose weight. 

 Strive to consume more water? Make it fun with a glass straw. It really works!

 Want to help your kids eat more fruits&amp;vegetables? Make it fun with a green smoothie and a glass straw. 

 According to speech therapists, glass straws help kids with oral 
development making it easier for them to learn to articulate and 
pronounce words.

 Jaw wired shut or have a hard time eating without a straw? A glass straw might do the trick!

 Has your dentist mentioned teeth staining? Use a glass straw to have
 your beverages bypass your teeth when you drink coffee, tea, red wine, 
or any acidic beverage and then see what your dentist says at your next 
checkup.

 If you are a smoothie lover, guess what? Yep! Glass straws make 
smoothie consumption a whole &apos;notha experience. Perfect for the green 
smoothie, protein shake, or any thick beverage!

 Want a gift for the person who has everything? Buy them a glass straw! Drinking straws are great 
gifts for special occasions like bridal showers, baby showers, weddings,
 or corporate gifts.
