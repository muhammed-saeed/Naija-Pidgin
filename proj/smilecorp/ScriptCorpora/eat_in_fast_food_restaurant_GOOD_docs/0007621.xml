 Why Smart People Resist Survival Preparedness 
 by Mitchell on  May 9th, 2012 at  11:08 am Posted In: Preparedness 
 The deadliest aircraft accident in history did not occur over the skies of a bustling city or in a major airport.  No, a total of 583 people died on March 27, 1977 on the runway of a minor airport on the small island of Tenerife—one of the Canary Islands about 60 miles off the coast of Africa.  In dense fog and without help from ground radar, two 747 jumbo jets ended up on the same takeoff path.  The terrible irony is that the two flights had been diverted for safety’s sake from the larger Gran Canary airport due to a bomb explosion in the main terminal.

Barreling down the tarmac, the pilot of KLM Flight 4805 realized too late that Pan Am Flight 1736 had taxied onto the runway.  Desperately, he tried to lift the giant aircraft and actually got it 15 feet into the air before it struck the hump on the Pan Am jet, obliterating the passengers on the observation deck.   The KLM flight crashed immediately taking the lives of all 248 souls aboard.  A total of 61 folks out of 396 lived through the Pan Am wreck, but according to an eye-witness survivor, Jack Ridout, hundreds more could have been saved.  For a full five minutes, most of the passengers sat in shock in their seats waiting for someone to tell them what to do.  They perished when fire and smoke roared through the cabin moments later.

Why could so few throw that mental switch to “survival mode” and save themselves?  Even when people have more time to prepare—as when Hurricane Katrina was threatening New Orleans—they rarely take the steps necessary for self-protection.    Quite obviously, humans behaved differently in the past.  In a wilderness filled with predators or in the face of lawless frontiers, people have instinctively done what was needed to survive.  So, what is different today?

For the most part, we lead safe and predictable lives.  We go to work or school, shop at the supermarket, and look forward to taking vacations in safe and secure places.  The news media bombard us with images of bad things happening to other people, but it won’t occur here.  At least, we refuse to accept that it could occur here.  After all, we each have our own problems to deal with—a job we hate or an unhappy marriage or a pile of bills to pay.  Why borrow trouble by planning for tragedy that has never happened here before?

This in a nutshell describes what psychologists call the “normalcy bias.” In simple terms, it means that when a person is confronted with unsettling concepts or circumstances, he shuts down and pretends everything is normal.  It is the primary reason that people don’t prepare for disaster.  With a kind of intellectual blindness , most of us filter out and reject as ridiculous anything that seems disturbing, threatening or creepy.  If something terrible actually happens, the filter blocks immediate action as we wait for a higher authority to tell us what to do.  The passengers frozen in place on the Pan Am flight are a perfect example of this.

Yet, when we can bypass the filter and begin to see and hear without bias, our evaluation of unpleasant information presents opportunities.  For example, I have boarded hundreds of aircrafts.  Despite this, I always pay close attention to the flight attendant’s instructions and I review the emergency procedures card every time I fly.  I make sure I have a seat within five rows behind the over-the-wing emergency doors.  It is the fastest way to exit the plane.  I do not board wearing any clothing made of synthetic material, because in a fire it will melt to your skin.  And, I never, never remove my shoes in flight—shards of glass, debris and burning carpet can cripple you as you scramble to survive.

Now, this does not mean I sit in white-knuckled terror waiting for the jet to crash.  I fly peacefully knowing that if a disaster occurs, I will be out of my seat and off the plane before most other passengers have a clue what to do!

Self-reliant survival begins with the attitude that preparation is like buying insurance.  You hope you never need it, but it’s your safety net.  In this vein, stockpiling food in the presence of skyrocketing grocery bills and soaring gasoline prices is not paranoia; it is common sense.  With a faltering national economy and federal spending hurtling toward bankruptcy, you are not buying into a conspiracy theory by moving your investments into cash and precious metals.  Clearly, it is the smart thing to do.  People who are truly smart don’t resist survival preparedness, they embrace it.

 Get Ready for the Coming “Food Shock” 
 by Mitchell on  January 10th, 2012 at  4:04 pm Posted In: Food Maintenance 
 Price inflation at the supermarket is in full swing as evidenced by my recent reduction in daily coffee intake.  My wife and I brew our java one cup at a time in a Keurig coffeemaker.  The dark magic that comes forth is hot, aromatic, delicious and there is no wasted leftover beverage.  However, when I visited my local grocery this week, I painfully discovered that our favorite coffee blends had increased 50% in price during our two-week hiatus.  I had to console myself with a mug of the hot stuff as soon as we got home.

Actually, despite my misery I wasn’t surprised by the price increase.  The wholesale cost of coffee beans has more than doubled in the past year.   It was just a matter of time before the carnage reached the retail shelves.  Unfortunately, we are seeing similar patterns for wheat products, sugar, dairy products and so forth.  The baseline costs of these key food groups have increased 30% or more from 2010 to 2011.  We can place part of the blame on widespread problems in production.  A share of the price increases belongs to commodity speculators.  But, the overarching cause of rising expenses at the dinner table is the rapidly eroding value of the almighty U.S. dollar!

This upward spiral in food prices is accelerating.  Here is what we can expect to happen in the near future.  Our national debt has tipped past $15 trillion and we will be in the hole another $1.7 trillion by the end of 2012.  Adding to this is the intention of the Federal Reserve to bail out the European Union with a trillion or so in cheap dollars.  The conditions will be ripe for American consumers to drown in a tsunami of inflation.  One major crop failure or supply interruption in the food chain and the dam will break.  Prices will go up and up and they won’t come down for a long time.  You have a narrow window of opportunity to get ahead of the crisis. Here are five things you can do to protect your family from the approaching food shock. 

 1.  Turn your pantry into your personal food bank. If you do not have a food storage plan in place, begin one immediately!  Shop for bargains in the items your family normally eats.  Canned goods remain nutritious for years.  Pasta, dried beans and rice are inexpensive and are excellent storage candidates.  Build a supply that would sustain your family for at least six months—a year’s worth would be even better.  If food prices continue to increase at the current pace, what you pay for your goods today will cost 33% more a year from now.

 2. Convert your freezer into a fast food restaurant. The average American family spends nearly 50% of the food budget on convenience foods.  Inflation is going to make fast food increasingly more expensive.  Yet, if you are willing to invest about four hours a week to prepare meals in advance, you will save hundreds—perhaps thousands!—on your annual food budget.  The key is to buy extra meat when it is on sale, prepare it all at once for your freezer, and then take out what you need later to make a fast and tasty meal.  Use square and rectangular containers to insure the most efficient use of freezer space, and remember, a full compartment reduces your electricity cost.

 3.  Start your own farmer’s market. Get together with ten or more family members and friends and create a food co-op.  Each week or perhaps every other week a member of the group will visit the local produce distributor or restaurant depot for fresh produce at wholesale prices.  Members of the co-op will purchase a “share” of the week’s bounty at a nominal price.  For more details, see our post from May 21, entitled “Hone ‘Bartering’ Skills by Running a Local Food Co-op.” However, if this requires too much effort, you can join a Community Supported Agriculture group (a CSA for short).  Purchasing shares in the CSA entitles you to a shipment of high-quality, fresh vegetables every week.  You can search for a CSA near you by visiting www.localharvest.org .

 4.  Become “Farmer Brown” and grow your own food. A well-managed garden of just 600 square feet (a plot 20×30 feet) can replace up to $2,000 a year that you would spend at the supermarket.  If you have never planted a garden, there are many good self-help books to guide your efforts.  Poor soil conditions can be overcome with raised beds.  Even if you have no ground space available, you can start a “container garden” in pots on your deck or back porch.  In the past, I have provided my family with tomatoes, squash, onions and strawberries in containers by utilizing less than 10 square feet of space!

 5.  Create a food processing plant in your kitchen. Your garden is likely to produce more vegetables than you can use.  Don’t allow it to go to waste.  Invest in a pressure canner and preserve the surplus.  If your garden plot is small, you can still make use of a pressure canner by visiting the local farmers market to buy up fruits and vegetables when they at their peak.  A stockpile of home preserves will be a blessing when supermarket prices go through the roof.  You can download the USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning for free.  There are also some great home canning books available at affordable prices.  You can get started in food canning for around a hundred dollars—an investment that will last for years.

The “talking heads” are touting a modest economic recovery.  But, are you seeing it at the gas pump?  Or in your utility bills?  Or at the supermarket cash register?  It will take years to get our country out of the financial abyss and you must plan for things to get worse.  Take action now to avoid the coming food shock.

 Avoiding Mayhem on Your Daily Commute 
 by Mitchell on  December 1st, 2011 at  6:01 am Posted In: Preparedness 
 Years ago while starting yet another business on a shoestring, I took a nighttime job with a company that counted inventory in grocery stores.  It was often past midnight before I could drive home.  One morning after a particularly late night, I awoke to the horrible news that a coworker had been murdered in her own driveway.  She was a gracious woman with two teenage daughters and a loving husband who recently had leased a new SUV for his wife to drive.  It was the SUV that cost her life, because two thugs followed her home and carjacked her when she exited the car.  The thieves brutally beat her, stole the car, and then actually came back and drove over her unconscious body to kill her.   She died only a few feet from her front door while her family slept upstairs.

Now, I recounted that terrible event to illustrate that every time you turn the ignition key in your vehicle you place yourself in danger.  Your most likely threats will come from either a distracted or intoxicated driver.  In the past year, more than 500,000 accidents and 6,000 fatalities were attributed to drivers who were inattentive.  Unfortunately, the greatest dangers of serious injury or death will come from predators that intend to do you real harm.  Let us examine the five principal sources of automotive mayhem and how to manage them.

 1. Minimize danger at the start and at the end of your commute. If you garage your car, be in the vehicle with the door locked before you open the garage door.  Never leave the garage standing open.  A thief will look for any opportunity to surprise you when you least expect it.  Whether at home or at work, if your car is parked in the open, make a quick survey of the area before leaving the safety of the building.  Have your key in your hand and be especially watchful as you approach the automobile.  Once inside, lock the door immediately before starting the vehicle.  Upon arriving home, do not ever open the car door until you have checked to insure that no one is waiting to attack you.

 2. Be focused and watch out for the driver who is distracted or intoxicated. More than 1,000 people will die in the next 12 months in wrecks caused by drivers on their cell phones.  Out of 40,000 traffic deaths last year, almost one-third of them were caused by drunk drivers.  Added to that will be millions of nonfatal accidents that occur because drivers are intoxicated, putting on their makeup, falling asleep, reading newspapers or business reports, engaging in animated conversations with passengers in the car and so forth. Distracted motorists tend to cause accidents in two ways—first, by drifting out of their own lane into oncoming traffic or sideswiping the car next to them, and second, by rear ending the vehicle in front of them.  Don’t join these bad drivers by being inattentive; stay alert and use your mirrors to be on the lookout for danger.  Whenever possible, allow suspicious drivers to get ahead of you so that you are trailing them.  If Make a habit of leaving a full car’s length of space between you and the stopped automobile in front of you.  This will give you enough room to maneuver quickly out of the way before someone strikes you.

 3.  Do not challenge the driver that is exhibiting “road rage” or aggressive behavior. A study conducted by the AAA organization concluded that violent anger in drivers is typically triggered by perceived slights or disrespect from other motorists.  Getting “cut off” and tailgating are two of the most common reasons given by aggressive offenders.  Recently in Florida, a 41-year-old man was shot to death at a toll booth when he confronted an angry driver that felt the 41-year-old was taking too long.  Clearly, the first rule in dealing with a raging motorist is to avoid reacting to his anger.  Do not make eye contact and absolutely don’t give in to the impulse to make insulting gestures.  Never pull off the road to “settle your differences” with an angry driver.  In heavy traffic, leave two car lengths between you and the vehicle ahead of you.  Always use your turn signal before changing lanes to reduce the chance of enraging another person.  If an aggressive driver continues to follow and harass you, drive to a police station or other public place and seek help.

 4.  Protect yourself from thieves and hoodlums that prey on motorists. When it comes to predators, your most important tool is constant threat awareness.  Driving has become so routine that many folks tend to drift into autopilot.  Thus, when a thief takes unusual interest in a car, the passengers are usually unaware.  You must maintain focus when you drive.  A car that remains in your blind spot is suspicious.  Slowly, reduce your speed to permit the other car to pass, and if it does not, then you know the driver has an ulterior motive.  When you are stopped at a traffic light, take note of any motorists that staring at you.  Always be looking for ways to evade a potential carjacking.  Call 911, lead the attackers to a public place, but never lead them to your home.

 5.  Take every safety precaution when you are stalled or stopped in traffic. If a tire goes flat, pull as far off the road as possible before changing the tire.  Have another person stand on the passenger side of the car and keep watch for oncoming traffic.  It is wise to subscribe to a roadside service like AAA, but if you do not, keep the phone number of a reliable tow company in your wallet.  When all else fails, call 911 for assistance.  If another driver stops to help you, do not accept an offer to be transported to help.  Should it become necessary for you to leave your vehicle, don’t get in a stranger’s car.  Always keep an emergency kit in your car with water and energy bars.

The daily commute to and from work can be dangerous, but you can avoid becoming a victim by remaining alert and following the rules for staying safe.

 Surviving a Black Swan Event 
 by Mitchell on  October 16th, 2011 at  5:09 am Posted In: Preparedness 
 There has been a great deal written lately about the possibilities of a Black Swan Event that could have a terrible impact on our society.  This phrase was introduced in 2007 in a book entitled The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  A Black Swan Event is described as an unexpected occurrence that has an overwhelming effect but is rationalized later as being something that should have been predicted.

For example, the atrocity of 9/11 was clearly a Black Swan Event.  It caught our country completely by surprise and it had a devastating economic and emotional impact on our nation.  Yet, for the past decade, various “experts” have ranted about how the powers that be should have expected this to happen and have been prepared for it. Unfortunately, a Black Swan is an anomaly—a deviation from predictable factors.  By its very nature, it is going to blindside the population.

So, no matter how intensely you prepare for your survival, a Black Swan Event will take you by surprise.  It may be something that is uniquely personal—a trip to the doctor for headaches reveals a brain tumor.  Perhaps it will affect the entire family—the house unexpectedly disappears into a sink hole!  Or, you could be one of thousands or millions who are victims—such as, the New Madrid fault creates the largest earthquake in recorded history.  If a Black Swan Event cannot be predicted, the question arises: can it be survived?  Regrettably, there is no guarantee of survival.  Depending upon the nature of the crisis, the person or persons who are at “ground zero” of a Black Swan Event may be lost.  On the other hand, adequate preparation across six major areas of eventuality will give you the best possible protection from any unpredicted disaster.  Virtually, any catastrophe—whether personal or global—will originate from these categories.  Preparing for survival in each specific area will offer your best protection from the effects of any Black Swan Event.  If you are a dedicated prepper, you have already set goals, to one degree or another, in these categories.  You need to review and strengthen your readiness.  If you have not yet begun your survival program, don’t waste another day to get started.

 Health and Medical – Your health must be at the head of the list.  If you fall ill, every other area of preparedness will suffer.  Do you have sufficient health insurance coverage and have you had a recent physical?  Have you created a stockpile of medications and health care supplies?  Do you have a library of health care manuals and have you or a family member taken medic training?  It is crucial to become as self-reliant as possible in caring for your family’s health.  The day may come when doctors and hospitals are no longer available. Financial and Economic – Clearly, our national economy and indeed global finances are in terrible shape.  Decades of government overspending, debt accumulation and printing currency backed only by trust have created the crisis.  The current impact on your family may range from tight credit and higher prices to total unemployment.  Tomorrow’s picture looks worse—including the possible collapse of our money system.  So, are you aggressively working to lower your debt load?  Have you created an emergency fund of ready cash and precious metals to sustain your family for several weeks or months?  An economic Black Swan will be both surprising and devastating. Life Sustaining Assets – People cannot survive without the basics of food, water and shelter.  In the face of droughts, blights and money shortages, food prices are skyrocketing.  The country’s transmission systems for electricity, natural gas and water are aging and fragile.  Winter is coming.  A Black Swan Event could leave millions cold and starving.  Do you have a food storage program, and have you escalated your purchases?  Have you added some good ceramic water filters to your stockpile?  It is time to start a family garden in the backyard or in containers on the deck. Security and Self-Defense – Angry and restless groups are protesting everywhere.  Teachers took over the state capital in Wisconsin.  The hate-the-rich crowd marched on Wall Street and is spreading out across the country.  Things are likely to get worse and before long the police will begin to push back.  Could our Black Swan Event be the installation of martial law?  Have you secured your home with good  locks?  Have you found places to hide your food, valuables and firearms?  Rioters love to start fires—do you have an evacuation plan and a retreat destination?  Don’t procrastinate! Natural and Environmental Causes – The increasing numbers of earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes are mindboggling!  Will another virulent version of the flu endanger us?  One thing is certain—Mother Nature is full of surprises!  Do you have a “Get Out” bag prepared and ready for travel?  Have you collected your important papers into a packet that you can grab quickly?  Is the vehicle fueled up?  Do you have an emergency stash of money to use when the ATMs go down?  You may be able to ride out the crisis at home; so do you have alternate sources of light and warmth if the power goes out?  You must be ready to act when a natural disaster occurs. Manmade Catastrophes – It may be as singular as being mugged in the parking garage or as collective as a car bomb exploding outside your restaurant, but a man-caused crisis will be the most likely cause of a Black Swan Event.  If it happens to you, can you throw the switch to survival mode?  In a life-threatening emergency, you may have less than 90 seconds to react and survive.  Do you maintain focused awareness that offers you the greatest advantage to recognize impending danger? During a catastrophe, will you be among the slim 10% of people that reacts instantly and effectively to save their lives? 

Clearly, being prepared in all of these major areas will work to your benefit should the unthinkable happen.  You may not be able to predict a Black Swan Event, but you surely can give yourself the very best tool kit for dealing with whatever impacts your life.

 Protect Yourself from Recession Scammers 
 by Mitchell on  September 9th, 2011 at  4:28 am Posted In: Identity Theft 
 Economic downturns breed the worst kind of thief—the scammers who prey on desperate people that are suffering with financial difficulties.  These vultures promise attractive situations to ease the money problems, but in truth, their only goal is to separate the “mark” from his cash.
This outrage is compounded by the fact that neither law enforcement nor litigation attorneys are interested in pursuing financial recovery for the victims.  The amount of money scammed from an individual usually ranges from around $40 to several hundreds.  The losses are simply not large enough to get the local district attorney excited about prosecution.

The only way to hang on to your money is to know how to identify these scammers before you get taken to the cleaners.  When one of these “too good to be true opportunities” shows up, you need to run, not walk, as fast as possible in the opposite direction.  Here are several of the most popular cons being used by thieves and some tips on avoiding them.

 Make money by working at home. There are so many appealing offers to increase your income from the comfort of your kitchen table.  You can choose from a) internet marketing training to make thousands from your blog; b) make great money stuffing envelopes; c) rake in cash by assembling crafts at home; d) haul in the dough by doing medical billing; or e) become a mystery shopper for fun and profit.  These are just a few of the work at home scams and they all have one thing in common— you must PAY for something to get started! Wake up. What legitimate company charges you a fee to get hired?  If you receive a work at home offer, check the company out for client reviews on the internet.  Avoid involvement with any outfit that wants money up front. Save thousands with a debt reduction company. If you are drowning in debt, an option to reduce or consolidate what you owe could be a lifesaver.  Debt management companies are quick to promise drastic reductions in creditor interest rates and lower monthly payments.  The trade-off will be an advance fee for setup of $300 to $1,000.  What you actually get in return will be, at best, the same lowered interest rate you could enjoy simply by talking directly with your creditors.  At worst, you will get nothing for your investment.  If you need debt counseling, look for free services that teach you how to budget and manage your finances.  One such company is the National Foundation for Credit Counseling at www.nfcc.org . Congratulations, you win big money! Imagine the excitement of receiving a cashier’s check in the mail or being notified you have won the lottery.  Would you like to help a person out of a jam by depositing funds in your account and return just a small amount to the sender so he can get to this country?  These scams all start with great news and a condition requiring you to send a modest amount of funds for “processing.” But, the cashier’s check is bogus and it bounces soon after you have sent your funds.  The same situation holds true for the winning lottery ticket—send money first; collect later.  Come on…you must buy a lottery ticket to win something.  Don’t ever send money to secure your winnings for anything. Let us save your mortgage. These companies will guarantee to end foreclosure and renegotiate a lower mortgage payment.  Or, they will manage a refinance of your mortgage to a lower rate with little or no closing costs.  Or, if you are a senior with a clear deed to your home, they will promise monthly income for life with a neat reverse mortgage.  Be sure to read the fine print before paying out the processing fees in advance.  With these scams, you risk losing both your money and your house! 

The real answer to avoiding these scams and all others is simple: verify that the offer is legitimate .  Before you let your emotions take control, check out the company with the Better Business Bureau and search for customer reviews on the internet.  Believe me, you are not the first person to be approached by this scammer.  Other folks have already fallen victim to their false promises and you can learn from their mistakes.  Survival in this tough economy means protecting your money from phony schemes and con artists.
