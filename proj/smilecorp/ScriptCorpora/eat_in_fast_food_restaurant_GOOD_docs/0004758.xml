TUCSON (KGUN9-TV) - A man accused of killing a Tucson teenager nearly 10 years ago is in a Pima County jail to face murder charges.

Max Montijo La Madrid was arrested last October by Sonoran State Police in Hermosillo Sonora. Since then, he has been in a Mexican federal prison jail cell waiting extradition.

He is accused of killing 16 year old Tanee Natividad in November of 2001. The Palo Verde High School student was shot at a midtown Jack-In-The-Box fast food restaurant near Speedway and Swan.

According to investigators, La Madrid was at the restaurant looking for revenge for an acquaintance who had been shot a killed. The U.S. Marshall&apos;s office said La Madrid mistakenly thought the person he was looking for was in a car with the victim.

After the shooting, La Madrid disappeared for 9 years. The case made national headlines and was featured on the television show America&apos;s Most Wanted. According the show, La Madrid was undergoing a sex change transformation to avoid capture.

Natividad&apos;s family described to 9 On Your Side their reaction after learning La Madrid was under arrest. &quot;They were like, Barb, we have him, we got him,&quot; said Barbara Nunez, the victim&apos;s mother. Nunez added, &quot;Even when I went to bed that night when I woke up the next morning I was like did I dream that was it really true did it really happen?&quot;

According to Tucson police, the U.S. Marshall&apos;s transferred custody of La Madrid to Pima County late this morning. TPD spokesperson Sgt. Diana Lopez said it was a relief that La Madrid has been brought back to Tucson to face justice.
