Top Ten: Stoner Foods

 So the word on the street is that food tastes better when you&apos;re stoned. I&apos;m just guessin&apos; though -- I would never engage in anything illegal like smoking The Pot! Swearsies. I hit up the Internet -- and a few of my favorite potheads -- to bring you this list of Top Ten Stoner Foods. Some of my old smoking buddies research subjects were even high when I interviewed them, which I think lends this blog post a lot of authenticity. Man .

One thing I learned about the topic of stoner foods: People really care about it. There are entire blogs dedicated to stoner foods. And a cookbook , too. There are scads of articles and forums dedicated to the discussion of what foods are the best to eat after marijuana consumption. I even found an article in which the cast of The Big Lebowski talks turkey about the best stoner grub.

The results? A list that includes sweet and salty, healthy and decidedly-less-healthy, hot and cold, fast and slow foods. My stoner buds did share two universal truths with me: 1. Munchies are great, but eating kills your buzz, so catching another in the post-munchie frenzy is always in order. 2. To quote a friend: &quot;Oh man. The thing is ... everything tastes good when you&apos;re stoned! Just eat.&quot;
 
 10. Chinese Take-out 

 
 myrecipes.com 
 Crab Rangoon, anyone? There is something about the way Chinese take-out combines sweet, savory, and salty that makes stoners swoon. Plus it&apos;s cheap, so you have enough left over for more weed.

 9. Macaroni&amp;Cheese 

For some, a box of Kraft will do; others prefer the homemade version. I suppose your preference depends on a variety of factors, from your ability to stay motivated and productive while high, to the number of ingredients -- including weed, to keep you busy while you cook -- on hand.

 8. Chips 

No fuss, little muss. Doritos, salt-and-vinegar potato chips, and Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips lend themselves to satisfying over-consumption. Dip optional -- but delicious.

 7. Ice cream 

My survey cited Ben&amp;Jerry&apos;s as the most popular brand, although I suspect native Texans will vote Blue Bell. For my money, I prefer to find Sweet Cream flavored ice cream (not vanilla!) and decorate it pretty with things like peanut butter, Nutella, fresh fruit. I mean, when I&apos;m in the mood for ice cream, that is.

 6. Cookies 

I was shocked to find that Oreos crushed chocolate chip as the most-cited stoner cookie. One responder with a love for Oreos cited the addition of Nutella to put it over the top; another told me Oreos crushed over ice cream (#7) is the only way to go. 1 | 2 | Next Page &gt;&gt;

It&apos;s all about grocery shopping---Raspberries, blackberries, straweberries, pistachios, wasabi peanuts, and dark dark chocolate.  All healthy and will have your taste buds lit up!  I&apos;m salivating now (and packing a bowl)
 
Hell yeah...I hit the Jus&apos; Mac restaurant when the munchies come calling.
 
Pizza, definitely number 1. But never at dusk! ;)
 
Cold Indian food!
 
Hamburger helper has a cheesy hashbrown mix, with a little hot sauce!!!!! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!
 
That&apos;s when we made a run to Dunkin&apos; Donuts.....
 
My most memorable meal when I used to be a stoner was a flour tortilla coated with butter warmed in the microwave and then stuffed with crunchy La Choy Chow Mein noodles. Pure ganja induced bliss at the time.
TA
 
This. Cottonmouth + peanut butter = terrible decision. I mean, unless you enjoy flailing around, tongue out and desperate like a dog that&apos;s been fed peanut butter.
 
I think that&apos;s why JItB tacos exist in the first place ^_^
 
Cold fried chicken, lasagna, red beans and rice, and last-but-not-least, anything, and I mean anything off of a taco truck.
 
&quot;Dirty&quot;anything from Zilla Street Eats. What doesn&apos;t taste better topped with crushed cheetos or cheesy fries?
 
Can&apos;t eat PB when stoned!
 
anything with peanut butter
 
That&apos;s that new hotboxing yoga, right?
 
Good one!
 
During.
 
Which do you prefer, smoking weed before or after yoga?
 
Ruffles and peanut -butter (Jif - smooth )
 
Bruce, it&apos;s a lighthearted joke in a lighthearted article. Get a grip.
 
The Taco Bell meat issue has been laid to rest.  It is seasoned beef.
 
Jack in the Box tacos, Cheddar Bacon Potato Wedges, Eggrolls and Mini Funnel Cakes with a Large Sprite.
