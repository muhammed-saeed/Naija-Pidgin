 Vintage Ocean City Beach Pictures 
 
Vintage Ocean City Beach Pictures
I have to start with 1926...This is a picture of my mom. Not sure if it was taken in Ocean City. Probably not. I think her mom was born in Atlantic City, but not a lot of history written about those day. My mom died when I was 21, so I did not really get to have a lot of time to ask her about the old pictures. Not many pics from back then, but I&apos;m lucky to have a copy of this one.
 
  1950... (I&apos;m guessing on most of the years. Not a lot of dates on the pics.) 

  Oh my gosh, Did thay drag this PlayPen to the beach??? Let me out of here, I want to go swimming! 

 
 Here is a very modern stroller! Bet it was not fun pushing it through the sand. These pictures were taken at 57th Street beach in Ocean city. 
 
 Here&apos;s my mom and me in 1950 at the beach in Ocean City. 

 1952... A good year for beach pictures
 
 My mom sure liked getting her picture taken! 


 Here I am with my brother Bob at 57th Street Beach. 

 I don&apos;t look real happy here. Who knows? 
 1953.... 
 
 This is my mom and dad. 

 Nothing better than an soda at the beach! 
 1955 (I think)... I remember when the following picture was taken. My brother Richard, bottom row 2nd from left, was leaving for or returning from the Army. (This is one of the few pics I have of him at the beach. He hates the beach.) They had a &quot;Luau&quot; party for my brother and his friends. At least two of the ladies were my mom&apos;s friend. Armena and Ruth were good friends who spent every summer in Ocean City. Armena Levonian was Armenian. How funny is that? They were the nicest people. They owned a house across the alley from us. They had a daughter a year older than me, and I used to hang around with her.
 1956... 

 This is my mom, dad and me at 56th Street Beach. 

 Here&apos;s a picture of mom, my brother Bob, dad and me. 

 Not sure who I am with here. I think she was some girl whol lived down the back alley from me. We used to love riding the waves with our rafts. 

 Ok, I&apos;m starting to pose for pics like my mom.... :-) 

 1957... 
 
 This is my sister Joan and me. 
 Here&apos;s my mom, smoking on the beach. Uggg...It&apos;s no wonder I never even tried smoking.... 1959.... 

 That&apos;s my sister Joan on the right and Armena next to her. Who knows who the other people are??? 

 My Dad, Mom and me. 56th Street beach. 

 Mom, her friend Ruth and that&apos;s my brother Richard on the right. 
 1960... 

 Ruth, my mom&apos;s friend, Mom, Dad, me. 
Not very many pics after this. It was diffent times...not as many pictures taken. Not like today with the digital pics! I&apos;m almost sorry I found the &quot;Burst&quot; option on my Sony digital camera. I have thousands of pics now of everything. It&apos;s nice to be able to treasure the few pictures we have from the past and remember the good times. Posted by Shoobie at 1:02 PM 4 comments: Email This BlogThis!

 &quot;Sheet&quot; Crick! 
 
 &quot;Sheet&quot; Crick We had some Crab for dinner tonight. It brought back memories of my mom cooking crabs in Ocean City, NJ in the 1950&apos;s.

When I was growing up, we would spend every summer at our house at 5613 Asbury Avenue in Ocean City, NJ. I was probably 5 or 6 years old when my brother Bob and sister Joan discovered this crick (Creek...for non Philly people) a block away behind West Avenue. They used to catch the largest and most delicious crabs. They would set traps and catch these wonderful crabs, bring them home for my mom would cook them up! Well, come to find out, the creek was the place where all the cesspools and septic tanks from the south end Ocean City spitted out their very fertile surplus. Probably supplied tasty stuff for the yummy crabs to feed on. Thank goodness I hated most seafood at the time, so I never tried them.

Ok, this was before the EPA and any regulations. Who knows what was released in the cricks and rivers of our county. Bob and Joan are lucky to have survived &quot;Sheet&quot; Crick!

My sister has told me this story many times. We have laughed about Mom bragging about the huge tasty crabs Bob and Joan caught at &quot;Sheet&quot; Crick. (Yes, the double &quot;ee&apos; should really be an &quot;i&quot;!)

Here&apos;s a picture of the Crab we had tonight. They came frozen in a package from Sams&apos;s Club. Who knows where the heck Sam&apos;s found them. Hopefully not in a &quot;Sheet&quot; Crick!

 Box of Sunshine 
 A Box of Sunshine! 
 I found this wonderful idea on Pinterest. Here are to links to these sites for more ideas... Happy Money Saver and Preserving Life&apos;s Moments .

I put together a Box of Sunshine for my sister. It was so fun walking around Walmart choosing fun yellow and happy items: Lemon Cookies; Burt&apos;s Bees Lip Balm; bath scrubbies; lemon hard candy; honeysuckle candle; yellow lollipops; Pretzel Combos with cheese; a CD; pot holders; a water bottle. Not pictured, I also added a couple Lemonade Capri Suns.

All the items were put in a USPS Medium Flat Rate Box. So no worry about how heavy the box was getting!
 Boxed and read to mail! Message Text: Sending You a Little Box of Sunshine to Brighten Your Day! Here is a Box of Sunshine I put together for my mother-in-law for Mother&apos;s Day. Never know what to send her, but I hope she will enjoy opening this box! She&apos;s diabetic, so I included sugar free items. Here are some of the items included: sugar free lemon pudding and Jello; Crystal Light candies; Dove Sugar free dark chocolate; decaf teabags; honeysuckle candle; crossword puzzles; Goldfish; Crystal Light Lemon Raspberry drink packets; raisins; box of Tomato Basil soup; yellow dishtowels, dishcloths and pot holder. I purchased the tissue paper and cellophane at the .99 store.

Again, all the items were put in a USPS Medium Flat Rate Box. So no worry about how heavy the box was getting!
   Boxed and ready to mail! Message Text: Happy Mother&apos;s Day! Sending You a Box of Sunshine to Brighten your Day! My lunch group also put together a &quot;Box of Sunshine&quot; for a friend who 
needed a lift. We all brought in some yellow or happy items to put in the
 box. Someone else put it together so I don&apos;t have a picture, but it 
was so fun because we all contributed something different.

Here is the graphic I used to print the Sunshine on yellow paper. I inserted the .jpg into a Word document. Copied and pasted it several times in different sizes. On the largest one, I inserted a text box to write a message and chose to have no fill or outline. Then printed on yellow paper and cut them out. Ok...it was not really fun cutting them out, but they turned out pretty cute!

 
This is such a fun idea and the possibilities are endless!

 Make a Box of Sunshine for someone today! Posted by Shoobie at 10:29 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Links to this post Labels: Bits and Pieces

 My Mom&apos;s Dishes 
 
 My Mom&apos;s Dishes My mom had this set of“good”dishes. They were hardly ever used
them…Maybe on Christmas or Thanksgiving. We never took pictures of the table
settings or any celebrations at the table - wish we had, it would be pretty special if I could
put one on this blog. The dishes were always stored in a“china”cabinet my dad
made with sliding glass doors. I acquired the entire set several years back when
my sister sent them to me. I just love them. They are bright and colorful, and I treasure them because they were my mom’s.    In 2006, my teeth almost fell out when I saw this article in
Better Homes and Gardens Magazine. These are my mom’s dishes! They were designed by a famous
Artist Viktor Schreckengost. Ok, he may be famous, but I had never heard of him
before this. He actually designed the first banana seat bike in the 60’s along
with lots of other things. Viktor designed the American Limoges Bermuda
pattern/Triumph design dishes, and they were produced in 1937. They appeared on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens in 1939 as shown in the
picture above.

 My mom’s dishes are now displayed in my“China”cabinet. The
rest of the set is stored in my kitchen cabinets. The huge large platter comes out every
time I cook a turkey. I’ve also use all the serving pieces with my own“good”plain
white dishes. Here is a picture of my mom’s dishes displayed in my dining room.    Well, I searched and actually found a not so great picture
of my mom’s dishes in the home-made“china”cabinet from 1969. There’s a table in front with my wedding gifts, but the &quot;china&quot; cabinet behind shows the dishes. Gees...it
looks to me like my mom actually had plastic bags over the dishes in the
cabinet! Good Grief! Guess it is no surprise because she always had special
covers thrown over the couch and chair in the living room so they don’t get
&quot;worn&quot; out. All that must come from living through the depression. Take care of
your stuff ! You never know when they will show up on a blog!

 Plastic Chairs and Table - Before and After 
 Plastic Chairs and Table - Before and After 
I have had this set of cheap dark green plastic table and chairs in my back yard for a long time. I&apos;m sure there are lots of these items in landfills - thrown away when they looked faded and dingy. This stuff does not wear out or break. I decided to refresh my set with spray paint. I used Krylon Fusion for Plastic.
 Here is a before picture of one of the chairs. I scrubbed them with a mixture of bleach and water using a scrub brush to get off any grime or mildew. Of course I forgot to take a before picture of the whole set!
 Here is the finished set. Four cans of the spray paint were needed for complete coverage. Time will tell how well they hold up. I&apos;ll keep the leftover can ready for touchups. Will probably have them forever! :-)

 Reeking Regatta 1972 
 The Reeking Regatta 1972 - Houston, TX 

We were living in Houston in the early 70&apos;s and belonged to the Young Houstonian Club from our bank at the time. They offered many discounts and activities. One of them was signing up to do the Reeking Regatta, a canoe race along the Buffalo Bayou. Buffalo Bayou is a fancy name for a creek (or crik if you are from Philly) running through Houston ending up at the Houston Ship Channel. It&apos;s been cleaned up a lot since 1972, and the name has been been changed to Regatta. March 10, 2012 is the 40th annual Regatta.

We participated in the first Reeking Regatta in 1972, and have the beer mugs to prove it! No personal pictures from the event...thank goodness I did not take my camera, it would have been destroyed in the bayou!

 Here&apos;s our story: 

I had no idea what I was getting into. I had never canoed before, but heck, how difficult could it be? My husband used to teach canoe lessons as a summer camp counselor while in college, or so he has always claimed. He thought he knew enough for both of us.

The night before the race, we had to drive to southwest Houston to rent our canoe. We lived just south of Houston Airport off I59 at the time . The big, heavy canoe was tied to the top of my Camaro. Could hardly see to drive.

We were lucky to have some great friends watch our little Bow so we could do this crazy adventure. The car must have been parked near the lauch area- after the race, we must have been shuttled back to the car. So we had to carry that darn canoe from the car to the bayou. I remember this part vividly...We got to the edge of the bayou, and there was this huge hill with slippery black mud leading down to the water. I was not very happy by the time we got the darn thing in the water to start paddling. I seriously did not realize we would be paddling this huge canoe for 15 miles (I&apos;m not sure it was 15 that year...it&apos;s 15 now) in calm, hardly flowing dirty water.

This was 1972, not a lot of emphasis on bringing water or anything to drink! So, needless to say, I thought I was going to die of thirst the whole time! Some of the spectators on the banks of he bayou were offering to sell beer and sodas for cash, but of course we left our wallets and money locked in the car. I was not happy!

The Buffalo Bayou at that time was blocked in several places so we had to portage several times along the way, drag that darn canoe over and back into the water. The first time to do this, I was in the front, and my husband in the back. We paddled to the shore and he said &quot;Get out!&quot; so I stood up and stepped out. Ok, this makes me laugh everytime I think of this...I stepped out and looked back...it caused the canoe to flip over and send him upside down in that stinking water. He was not happy. He was wet, stinking and we still had many more miles to paddle. No water to drink.

I&apos;m not sure how long it took, but the Buffalo Bayou pretty much had NO current and required constant paddling to keep the darn canoe moving.

There were no results posted that year that I know of, but my husband said no other gals passed us in canoes, so he&apos;s pretty sure I was the first woman to cross the finish line. Actually not many women were stupid enough to do the Reeking Regatta in 1972 totally unprepared.

At the finish line we were hungry and thirsty and were rewarded with mugs filled with beer. It was a crazy experience. I&apos;m glad to have the memories, but for some reason, I have never stepped in a canoe ever again!

Here&apos;s some pictures of our mugs!
 
 I found the following pictures on the Houston Chronicle website. The pictures are vintage showing the Reeking Regatta during the 1970&apos;s. Seeing the pictures brought back all the memories.

 UPDATE: We visited downtown Houston recently, and here is a recent photo of Buffalo Bayou. This picture was taken a few blocks south of where the canoes are taken out of the water for the regatta. Ummm...Maybe they should keep the name Reeking Regatta! The water looks pretty yucky!

 Mary Hoyer Dolls 
 Mary Hoyer Dolls - Ocean City, NJ 
There was a Mary Hoyer doll shop on the boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ when I was growing up the 1950&apos;s. It was my very favorite shop to visit when we went to the Boardwalk during the summer. I ended up with three Mary Hoyer dolls. Two blonds and one red head. The blond dolls were different sizes. I also had a doll very similar in size and look. She was a Mary Heartline doll. Don&apos;t remember much about Mary Heartline, but I think she was some kind of celebrity twirler? When her blond hair got too ratty, my mom bought a red Mary Hoyer wig from the store to replace that blond hair. The larger of my Mary Hoyer dolls is gone. She fell apart and the last time I saw her was in my parents house in Roxborough in the 70&apos;s. I still have my other three dolls.

 The Mary Hoyer store in Ocean City not only sold dolls, they sold all kinds of accessories, clothes and dress patterns for the dolls. I have no idea how many hours my mom must have spent sewing beautiful outfits for my Mary Hoyer dolls. They are just simply gorgeous. Thank goodness I still have them. There are dresses, slacks, formal dresses, PJ&apos;s, nightgowns, and just everything a doll could possibly need. My mom splurged on the accessories at the Mary Hoyer store. I have shoes, ice skates, stockings, a tennis racket, and many more little trinkets. They are not in the best shape. My mom said dolls were to be played with and not saved. And play with them I did! The dolls were kept in two cardboard Girl Scout cookie cartons with handles. I always had them in Ocean City where we would spend our summers. I remember carrying the boxes down the alley behind our Ocean City house to my best friend&apos;s house on the next block at 5700 Central Avenue, Nancy Carol. Nancy and I would spend hours playing with our Mary Hoyer Dolls. It was a very special time. I have no pictures from that time or my sweet friend Nancy. 
 I do still have the dolls and brought them out recently for my 4 year old grandaughter to play with. It&apos;s a different time now...Barbie everything...but she had some fun with my Mary Hoyer dolls. She enjoyed changing their clothes and putting on the shoes. It was probably more fun for me to play with my Mary Hoyer dolls again. 
 Here&apos;s Emmylou changing One of the dolls. 
 Here are my three dolls. The one in the crazy cowgirl outfit is the non Mary Hoyer. Yes, she has real guns in the holster. Everyone had cowgirl outfits with guns and holsters in the 50&apos;s. The sweet cabinet I now store the clothes in was acquired from my very good friend Sheri. She used to store pool chemicals in it. Good grief, it&apos;s so very perfect for handmade Mary Hoyer doll clothes! Posted by Shoobie at 1:12 PM No comments: Email This BlogThis!
