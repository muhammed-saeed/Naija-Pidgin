Product Description
 
 With three sleep options (portable sleeper, bassinet, bedside sleeper); a play seat with vibrations, music, and sound effects; and changing table, this five-in-one bassinet is a boon for any parent of a newborn. The bassinet rocks or locks into place, and features a backrest that inclines to ease congestion (those tiny nostrils do get clogged up!), an air-flow sleep area, and a cotton/polyester sheet and bassinet cover. The portable sleeper allows busy parents to carry sleeping baby from room to room, folds easily for travel, adjusts for sleep or play, and includes a safety harness for security. The bedside sleeper is wonderful for exhausted mommies and daddies who want to feed and soothe their infant without getting out of bed. It attaches securely to the parental bed and has five height positions. The changing table provides a separate changing surface from sleep area. Handy pockets keep diapering supplies close by, and the easy-to-clean vinyl cover is a no-brainer. Music and nature sounds soothe baby, along with gentle vibrations and a soft-glow nightlight. There’s even a cute mobile to entertain a wakeful baby. Four AA batteries required (not included). Discontinue use when baby reaches 17.5 pounds or is highly mobile.
