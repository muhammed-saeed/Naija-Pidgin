   We are settling in at home, slowly but surely. I&apos;ve been cleaning for a few days now but all the suitcases are unpacked and nearly put away. Jet lag is still hanging around a bit. The kids have been going to bed on time with no naps during the day but rising between three and four every morning, ugh. But all in all, I don&apos;t have much to complain about. Now that our journey has come to an end, I wanted to send a shout out to a few people. Without them, this journey would not have been possible.  

 Yeye and nainai (grandpa and grandma) who graciously allowed us to stay in their extra apartment the entire time we were in Beijing. This was no small feat on their part. A garbage disposal, toilet and air conditioner broke, they upgraded their internet connection so it wouldn&apos;t be as slow, they paid for all of our electricity while we were there, they help me at the hospital with Alaina and so much more. They were the perfect hosts and without them, this trip would never have happened.

 My husband who did so much to make our lives easier while we were abroad. He was our translator, virtual tour guide, rescuer during emergencies, provider of moral support and financier of our trip. In the beginning of our journey, I provided a LONG list of places we wanted to visit. He then provided detailed maps, restaurants, and so much more of each individual tour site. He was our saving grace.  

 Jessica and Anthony were the glue that helped me hold it all together. I&apos;m not even going to pretend that we loved each other at all times. Just like any other family dynamic, there were challenges and times when we didn&apos;t see eye to eye. But all in all, we kept the lines of communication open and made it through with flying colors.

 Jessica cooked many meals and my daughters raved about her &apos;yummy&apos; food time and time again. She helped keep the apartment clean and helped me with the kids both at home and when we were out and about on our many excursions. And she went on our excursions time and time again even though she&apos;s a homebody and doesn&apos;t really care to explore constantly (like me).

 Anthony also learned how to make some pretty good Chinese food to include an awesome General Tso&apos;s dish. He was my &apos;corner store guy&apos; :-). Whenever he went, he usually came back with something we needed in tow. He helped the girls watch t.v. episodes on their computers and &apos;put up&apos; with their frequent sassy selves. After all, Jessica and Anthony are single with no kids. What a huge adjustment to be living a life &apos;with&apos; kids literally overnight!

 And a big thank you to everyone who followed along on our journey. It was great to interact offline with a few individuals and make some friends. Best wishes to all of you and safe travels on all your future journey&apos;s.

   Everything related to flying went sooooo smoothly yesterday. I&apos;ve made six trips back and forth to China and this, by far, was the smoothest one yet. Our flight was on time and it seemed to go by so quickly, it didn&apos;t seem like 13 hours. We arrived into JFK a bit early and literally breezed through customs and baggage in less than 45 minutes, AMAZING. So you know the joy was about to end, right? Right.

 When we arrived at the curb, hubby was nowhere in site. He was lost and didn&apos;t make it to the airport until an hour later. Then, we had to drive home from JFK. The traffic was HORRIBLE and it wasn&apos;t just because of rush hour. There were accidents, rain, more accidents, it was just a mess. We should have arrived in around 10 p.m. but didn&apos;t get home until 12:45 a.m., boo, hiss, boo.

 Everyone is adjusting fairly well and I think our jet lag will be short lived. The house is a DISASTER. Note to sell, never leave hubby home for six months by himself EVER again. The house smells like mold because of our forever leaking basement. It&apos;s not usually a big problem if the water gets sucked up asap but...............no further comment. And it didn&apos;t help that we had a VERY rainy summer. 

 The grass was a mile high - it was not cut since June. Just glad we don&apos;t live where there is a homeowners association. The refrigerator smelled and there was still cheese in there from when I left. Well, okay it could technically be called a lab experiment and not actually &apos;cheese&apos; anymore. There is dog hair in every corner and the floors were never mopped. I probably don&apos;t need to continue, you get the idea, right? And to think I was going to do a post about my wonderful husband soon............. 

 Anyway, it will take me, oh, about a month to get the house in order! Alright, alright, not quite that long but I&apos;ll be busy for a while. Anyone know a good maid out there they&apos;d like to send my way............along with a handyman, plumber, electrician and more?

 Culture 

 10/13/2011

   cul·ture:   [kuhl-cher] - n : The sum of attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another. Culture is transmitted, through language, material objects, ritual, institutions, and art, from one generation to the next: the Chinese culture .

 I&apos;ve been thinking about this one little word lately. I&apos;ve been thinking about this when when I&apos;m out and about watching the locals or looking out my window. I was thinking about it the other day when I was in the courtyard trying to communicate with a grandmother while doting on her adorable little granddaughter. 

 Things are SO very different here than what I&apos;m used to. The language is a nightmare for a westerner to overcome, the written language even harder, the practice of medicine is different and so much more. But what&apos;s surprising to me is how easy it&apos;s been to adjust. This is no small feat when: a) you consider that I&apos;ve been living in one and only one culture for 41 years, b) I&apos;ve been here only six months, and c) as you can see by the definition, there are many different things that make up a culture! 

 So really what I&apos;ve been wondering is how this could be possible? I&apos;m not one who adjusts to change very easily, transitions are hard for me. I like to toss things up, keep things interesting but I don&apos;t like change that I have no control over. And I have no control of this culture versus mine, nor do I want to. After all, if I came here and made it just like what I&apos;m used to, why bother? 

 In my personal opinion, I think it boils down to this....while culture is huge and helps to define an individual, it doesn&apos;t change their very composition. If they&apos;re a human, it will not turn them into an amphibian or a bird. Okay, so what exactly am I trying to say? I&apos;m trying to say that I personally think that the single most important factor that connects us all is being human. And in being human we all share many things in common. We bleed if we are cut, cry if we are sad, love, feel, care and have all the same basic needs to include water, food, shelter, etc.

 My posts lately haven&apos;t had any pictures and that makes me sad. So, I&apos;m going to sum up some of the highlights of Chinese culture through pic&apos;s. 
 Well, tomorrow is it. The bags are all packed with just a few little items that need to be shoved in at the last minute. Our flight departs at 1:00 and we start our 13 hour LONG journey home. Then, we drive another six to get home. It&apos;s a bit of a hassle but it was so much cheaper to do it that way.

 We didn&apos;t get to finish up all of the sight-seeing that we had hoped. We wanted to go back to the Forbidden City and a few other stops - oh well. We had also wanted to travel within China (that was actually high on my list). However, after Alaina had to go to the hospital, I lost confidence in my abilities to properly care for my kids if anything ever happened :-(. I really needed yeye and nai nai (grandpa and grandma) to help me or I would never had been able to communicate her problems. So, I called off the trips to Xi&apos;an and Qingdao, both which were in the making at the time. And I really didn&apos;t want to have to do the whole tour group thing either. We&apos;ll save it for another time when my Mandarin speaking husband is with me!

 I&apos;ll be posting out for a week or so after we return home and then finish up the blog. Stay posted for the day when my China in 360 journey is published. That&apos;s my goal when I get home :-). Then perhaps a series of children&apos;s books about China. All complete with a few of the, oh about, three thousand photos that I took (not kidding)!!

 Out of the Mouth of Babes 

 10/12/2011

   Kids are flexible and mine are no exception. But regardless of how flexible or inflexible they are, our journey has been difficult for them at times. They&apos;ve had to sacrifice seeing their father, swings, their backyard, their pets, some freedom, friends and more. While they temporarily lost one parent, they gained two additional adults whom they had to listen to and respect on a daily basis. So, they&apos;ve had their share of stress to deal with.

 I was asking each of them the other day about our journey. If they could tell others what life is like half-way across the world, what would they say? I thought I would honor them with a post all their own and say duo xie (many thanks) for going sight-seeing even though there were times you wanted to stay home, for being brave even when you were lost in Beijing, for helping us haul the groceries home time and time again, for stepping up and helping mom because you knew at times I was stretched thin, and many other things too numerous to mention. Here’s to my three treasures (the Chinese names they were given by their caretakers in China were Big Treasure, Little Treasure and Happy Treasure, so they’re our three treasures).

 Alissa 

China is very interesting because you take buses, the subway and taxis everywhere because not everyone can have a car. It’s also interesting because when China is sleeping, America is awake and when America is sleeping, China is awake.

There are a lot of palaces (she meant temples) in China. I’ve been to the Temple of Heaven and many others.

My favorite things about China were (these are in the order she dictated them to me): my grandparents (aww); celebrating the Moon Festival; red envelopes, I got three while I was here; the Pearl Market (that’s my girl!!); the ruins of Yuanmingyuan and the maze there (Old Summer Palace); the Ethnic Museum; the Great Wall and the cable car ride because my dad was acting so funny when he thought he was going to fall and the Beijing Zoo because I love animals.

It’s really hard to live here because not a lot of people have cars, we didn’t have a backyard. It was especially hard the time we got lost in China but I think it’s kind of funny now.

Some of my favorite foods here were: sweet potatoes from the street vendors, the sweet and sour fish that comes whole, rice, the yummy broccoli, pork buns and Jessica’s cooking (they loved the meals she made and would eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner if there was enough leftovers!).

 Alaina 

 One of my favorite memories during my trip was getting a stuffed panda from the Beijing Zoo. Our neighbors are also really nice. I would earn money by taking the trash and recycling out. Every time I took the recycling to the neighbors, they were so nice. They always said xie xie (thank you) to me. They also gave us moon cakes during the moon festival. They are so nice.  
 
 There are a lot of weird bugs in China. My little sister got pricked by the same type of caterpillar twice. See the picture we took of it? She said it really hurt. There are also some REALLY big caterpillars here. I&apos;ve also seen flying bugs with red and black polka dots on the inside of their wings. The thing that I really didn&apos;t like about China was not having a car. Also, most of the buildings and apartment complexes look pretty rusty, dirty and old. I also really missed not having a swing.

I liked being able to ride my bike in the courtyard. I also like the big area we had to play in. I also liked the bed in my room, it is snuggly (really?? more like super hard!). I also liked my room because it didn&apos;t have a closet like my room at home. I&apos;m scared of the closet in my room at home.

The things that I really liked about China was going to the beach (Tuanjiehu) in the summer. The food I liked the most was the sweet potatoes from the vendors, rice, sweet and sour chicken, broccoli and Jessica&apos;s cooking.

 Nadia 

I liked China because I had good dreams but sometimes I had scary dreams about our room. I really liked the time I got to watch t.v.

In China they have lights that tell you when to go. (She&apos;s referencing the cross walk lights that are green when you can cross, yellow when you need to hurry and red when you shouldn&apos;t walk).

I don&apos;t like everyone talking Chinese. I like it when daddy pushes me on the swing at home. I can&apos;t wait to go home and see daddy.

The rest is my input reference Nadia:

Nadia was enthusiastic about China when we arrived. However after dad left and our stay continue into months, she began to grow defensive. She started to say &apos;I hate China&apos; whenever people would try and talk to her and she couldn&apos;t understand them or whenever something upset her. It was always &apos;China&apos;s&apos; fault :-0, it was just something to blame it on.

And the longer we&apos;ve been here, the worse it&apos;s gotten. And unfortunately, whenever we go out, people dote on her constantly. They would try and talk to her, tell her &quot;ni shi piaoliang&quot; (you are beautiful) and laugh when she got upset. She started putting her head down or turning away from people to tune them out. Recently she started telling people in English &quot;My daddy speaks Chinese AND English&quot; in a smart manner, ahhh! And what she really meant when saying this was &apos;why don&apos;t YOU speak English too, you make me feel uncomfortable&apos;! Ummm, sorry kiddo, you&apos;re in China.

 We&apos;re almost all packed and holding out on the last minute stuff. And wouldn&apos;t you know it, Alaina is having an outbreak of hives as I type. Not sure what that&apos;s all about and I hope it doesn&apos;t get worse or I&apos;ll have to take her to the doctors. I fed her white rice for dinner and water. Trying to see if it&apos;s a food issue or perhaps she&apos;s become sensitive to the laundry detergent or soap? Nothings changed in our lifestyle so who knows. That&apos;s all I need is to have to delay our return trip because of red blotches, poor baby :-(.

 Would I Do It Again? 

 10/11/2011

   Happy Birthday to my sister Gina. Hope you have a great day!

 My husband asked me this question the other day about our journey: &quot;If you had the opportunity, knowing what you know now, would you do it again&quot;? I didn&apos;t answer him immediately and he assumed that meant &apos;no&apos; on my part. But he should know me better than that after almost ten years of marriage, right? Alright, for those of you who have been married a while, silly question, huh? 

 But on a serious note, I am a ponderer by nature. By chance, I fell into the right degree when I returned to college - history. Before I make a move, I consider what may have occurred in the past, what the current conditions are and what the possible outcome may yield. I&apos;m a researcher by nature - which was definitely a necessity for my field of study. I seldom do things on a whim, although a fleeting thought may cause me to ponder, research and decide to do something, hence China in 360 :-). 

 So, with that said, I&apos;ve been thinking about my husbands question, &quot;would I do it over again&quot;? And my answer is conditional, of course. I would come to China to live again. However, I wouldn&apos;t come for a temporary six month stay with my children and without my husband. I would come under those conditions for three months tops. There are several reasons for this: we lived in limbo too long, the kids REALLY missed their father and it was a lot of work on my part. However, I did confirm that I could survive as a single mother without any break (a.k.a. the typical &apos;every other weekend&apos;) if I had to. Now if I was single without children, yes, I would do this all over again.

 I would also come to China to live again if my husband got a job here. Please note, China has never been, nor would it ever be, my first choice of an ideal place to live. I love the people and culture, don&apos;t get me wrong. However, I seek warmer climates and would LOVE my next move to be to Florida and/or warmer weather. Beijing does not hold that prospect for me. As well, I&apos;ve always been turned off by the air pollution, which, if it was able to be fixed, would be a long time coming. 

 However, with all that said, I believe that family takes center stage. I am forever grateful that I was able to be with my mother during the last year of her life. I cannot fathom having been miles and miles away. I was able to help her when she needed it, I visited her nearly every single day she was in the hospital and I was there to say &apos;goodbye&apos; the night before she left us. 

 So why mention this? Because my mother and father-in-law still reside in Beijing. And I would like my husband to be able to be with his parents, especially since mine are both gone. I would also like my children to get to know their grandparents. They don&apos;t even remember the last time they saw them (at 6 and 18 months) and finally they&apos;re forming a relationship. I would also move here long term so my children could learn more about the culture they were born into. I would also like them (and myself) to become bilingual. 

 This journey was a labor of love - a gift for our three adopted daughters. One they may not fully appreciate or understand now but one they most certainly will as adults. They have learned that life here has its ups but also can be hard, sometimes very hard. I&apos;m hoping in the future, this understanding will bring them closer to the possibilities when they do their own pondering. When they ponder the difficult question about why their birth mother may not have been able to raise them.

 I often think of the movie based upon the novel The Joy Luck Club when I wonder about my twin daughters birth mom. While I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s based on fact, it still touches me deeply. For those who haven&apos;t seen it, this is the part where I cried for my own baby girls. It starts with the character Suyuan, whom d uring the Japanese invasion, leaves her home with one bag of clothes, one bag of food and her twin baby daughters. Her husband is fighting in the war. Suyuan gets a case of severe dysentery and is certain she will die. She decides to leaver her twins along with all her possessions and a note pleading for someone to care for them. She then leaves to die but ends up being saved. She never knows what became of her twin daughters and it haunts her the rest of her life.

 On my daughters birthdays, Chinese holidays, etc, I often mourn for their birth moms. And we&apos;ll never really know for sure the circumstances behind their choice. However, I hope through this journey, when my daughters are grown, they will realize that the options their birth mothers may have had were probably pretty slim. And quite possibly, she may have loved them all so much that her only true option was to let them go. By letting them go she hoped their life would be easier than what she may have encountered. Yes, I&apos;m just pondering but the possibility is there.

 On a lighter note, the bags are nearly all packed and I may need to borrow a suitcase from the in-laws :-0!! I have so much I still want to post but our time here is coming to a close. A few more days and a few more posts. If anyone has any questions, wants me to go more in-depth about something, anything, just post a comment and I&apos;ll respond.

 Apartment Living 

 10/08/2011 

 1 Comment 
   Living in an apartment is a way of life in Beijing. Nearly everyone lives in an apartment so I thought apartment living would be worth highlighting. Especially since I&apos;ve personally never lived in an apartment before. A few things I&apos;ve learned about apartment living are: 

 Being on the top floor is ideal : Most of our neighbors are awesome except for the ones who live above us. And I&apos;ve found out that those are the worst neighbors to not form an alliance with. They are always banging on stuff in their apartment. I swear these people are doing home improvement 24/7. And lets not leave out the little dog that barks A LOT. Oh, and the nice sounding, LOUD piano that is right above my bedroom. And trust me, that piano doesn&apos;t sound so nice AND is really loud at night. That would be night as in when I&apos;m trying to get the little one to sleep, she&apos;s about drifted off and the noise begins for about an hour, argggggh! And did I mention that it sounds just as good at 7 a.m. in the morning? That would be when their daughter is practicing right before her recital (which occurs ~every other month)&lt;sigh&gt;!

 An elevator makes all the difference in the world : This is especially true when you&apos;re trying to haul heavy stuff, groceries, etc up many flights of stairs. If I were to live in Beijing again and had to purchase an apartment, it would have an elevator. And it&apos;s probably worth noting that only apartments higher than six floors are built w ith elevators in Beijing. So in order to get an elevator, you have to live in a fairly tall building.

 Two level apartments are nice : If we ever moved to Beijing, we&apos;d purchase a two level apartment. Basically, from what I&apos;ve seen, the second to the top apartments are two level. There are stairs inside and the upper levels are mainly bedrooms. The bottom level sometimes has another bedroom or two, the kitchen, living room, etc. This is a nice set-up with kids and provides more &apos;space&apos; for everyone. One of our expat friends has this type of an apartment (along with 5 kids :-0) and I liked it a lot.

 Good outdoor space : It&apos;s nice to have this with kids! Our apartment complex is fairly large and it has a really nice courtyard and wooded trails. I&apos;m sure this is hard to come by in Beijing but I&apos;m so glad we have this. The kids have had a lot of fun riding their bikes on the trails and playing on the outdoor exercise equipment. It would be perfect if it had a playground but I dare not ask for more as we&apos;re lucky enough to have what we have :-). 

 I&apos;ll be glad to have my multi-level home back next week with its very own backyard for the kids. However, there&apos;s a lot to be said for downsizing. The apartment we&apos;ve been living in is one-third of my house but it&apos;s SO much easier to keep up with. If the kids make a mess, there&apos;s not enough space to make it too overwhelming. So, they can clean it up fairly quickly. I also love having everything on one level, to include the washing machine. It makes laundry much easier. In my house, we have to go up and down three flights of stairs to wash and put it all away, major pain!

 Things I&apos;ll Miss 

 10/04/2011 

 3 Comments 
   In my last post I mentioned some of the things that I&apos;m really looking forward to when we return, such as FIOS internet. However, as we leave China behind there are many things that I will miss about living here. My top ten things are:

1.  exploring the vast history of Beijing : By the time we leave, we would have been in Beijing for almost six months. While we&apos;ve seen the top sites, there is so much more to see. Beijing is a place brimming with centuries of history and it&apos;s fascinating to explore and wonder what was. I will miss our adventures.
 
2.  the kindness of most locals and all their quirks: Nearly all of the locals have been very kind to us. I will miss the smiles and kind gestures. I will miss strangers getting up to allow my daughters to have a seat.....this is nearly everywhere we go. Yes, there are some people who leave them standing but there is a true kind heart towards children here. Very rarely do you ever feel like they&apos;re a bother, quite the contrary, they&apos;re doted on. And who can forget the quirks that make the locals who they are? I&apos;ll miss the ankle length stockings worn by many women in the summer (like my grandma wore). I&apos;ll also miss the BIG purses that are all the fad here and so much more.
 
3.  the delicious food : I&apos;ll miss the variety of food from all over China that can be found in various restaurants throughout Beijing. I&apos;ll also miss the authentic Chinese food - most of which cannot be duplicated properly in the States. And lets not forget some of the delicious &apos;street food&apos; that proves yummy food doesn&apos;t always have to go hand in hand with fine dining :-).
 
4.  the craziness of China : I&apos;ll miss China with all its loose standards and sometimes refreshing inadequacies. Who couldn&apos;t resist pirated DVD&apos;s for $1.50? And every now and then it&apos;s nice that everything doesn&apos;t come wrapped up in a perfect little package. It makes me think of when I was a child in upstate New York. We were allowed to ride in the back of my uncle&apos;s pick up truck on the way to get water from the natural springs that were tucked into the Adirondack Mountains. China still allows people to use their common sense to stay safe and not everything is banned or regulated. I&apos;m not saying this is always a good thing but at least living is not a lawsuit waiting to happen, know what I mean?
 
5.  bargaining with the shop owners : While it&apos;s nice sometimes to have fixed prices when you don&apos;t feel like putting a lot of labor into shopping, I still love haggling. Shopping becomes more interactive, you feel like you&apos;re alive and bonding in a way. Yes, you&apos;re both trying to come out of it with the best scenario but in the end you usually walk away friends. But never believe their line, &quot;I give price only for you my friend, only for you&quot;, ha ha, right!
 
6.  mom and pop stores : I know this is an oxymoron to the top ten things I listed last post but what can I say. We love walking to the little corner store near our apartment complex and getting fresh fruits/vegetables, candy, rice, etc. It saves us from always having to walk two city blocks to the big store. And we&apos;ve become friends with the owners. When customers question them about us, they always say, &quot;Tamen de pengyou&quot; or they&apos;re our friends :-). Of course they probably add &quot;that we charge a mark up to because they&apos;re meiguoren (American&apos;s)&quot;. Just kidding, I think :-0!! If they said that, I&apos;d probably not be able to decipher it!
  
7.  farmers selling seasonal produce on every corner : The corner guy sells it and on our way to the big market we pass at least two or three on the way. We have one donkey the kids see on a regular basis that pulls a cart from a nearby farm. Fresh fruits and vegetables are readily available here and it&apos;s awesome, love it. My husband just told me that the government is stopping the wholesaler and helping the farmer distribute their goods directly to the bigger markets. This knocks out the middle person, lowers prices and allows everyone to eat a healthier diet.
 
8.  the laughter of children playing outside : I was hanging laundry the other day on the balcony. It was a gorgeous day and the windows were all open. I smiled when I heard the kids laughing and run around in the courtyard. And it dawned on me how much I&apos;m going to miss that. I hardly ever hear children playing outside in my neighborhood. Do kids play outside much anymore?? My kids play in the backyard, it&apos;s one of the things they miss most, but I never hear any other kids. I&apos;m going to miss that.
 
9.  the feeling of community : this goes for inside our apartment complex as well as when we&apos;re out and about. People, for the most part, look out for each other. I&apos;ll miss our neighbors across the street, who wanted us to read English books to the children in the courtyard (we never did :-( ). I&apos;ll miss going out and hearing parents tell their children to say hi to jiejie (big sister) or meimei (little sister). They&apos;re telling their child or grandchild to say hello to one of my daughters but using an endearing term. This gives the feel that everyone is connected somehow. Say hello to your big Chinese sister or share your seat with your little Chinese sister (I&apos;ve heard this said to a little boy reference sharing a seat with my little one on the bus). Love it.

 10. how central family is here : I love looking outside the window or hanging out in the courtyard and seeing all the grandmothers and/or grandfathers looking after their grandchildren. Family is at the core of life here. Most families don&apos;t split up and live miles and miles apart, they stay together and rely on each other for their mere existence. Parents usually live with their grown children and care for their grandchild(ren). This is the norm, not the exception. Even when children move countries apart, the grandparents usually come to care for the grandchild

 Tomorrow we&apos;re heading to the duck restaurant with yeye and nainai (grandpa and grandma). This will be our last outing together before they escort us to the airport next week for our departure. The kids made them cards and I have a little something to give them. That is one final thing the kids will miss, having a grandma and grandpa nearby. They no longer have either one back home :-(.

 Five Months 

 10/01/2011 

 1 Comment 
   Today marks five months living as an expat in China. This journey has been a very thought provoking one for me. I barely knew what the term expat meant before I became one. Our journey has stretched me further than I thought I&apos;d be able to bend before. It has been fun times, happy times, scary times and sad times.

I really do have a lot of things that I am grateful for. I was thinking about the things I missed the most as thoughts start turning towards home. The top ten things are:
 
 1.  my husband : for obvious reasons but also because of that old saying, &apos;absence makes the heart grow fonder&apos;. If it was not for my husband, I would not be here. We met through an online dating service and I&apos;m so glad that I checked the box &apos;open to all races&apos;. Because in the end, Chinese, African American, Caucasian, whatever we classify ourselves as, our differences are very minimal. I already knew that before we got married but our relationship has strengthened my belief and so has this journey.
 
 2.  our pets : I miss having little wagging tails and doggy licks. But I have to admit, I DON&apos;T miss the hair everywhere. The cats, well, I used to be a major cat person but I think dogs rule now. Okay, so I miss the cats a little bit.
 
 3.  my minivan : I miss being able to pile everyone into the van and head on our way. The kids do too. I will never look at a trip to the store the same way again. Now we have to take buggies, walk two city blocks, put groceries into the buggies, walk back home (sometimes in rain or hot, hot weather) and carry our buggies up eight flights of stairs. I will never complain about grocery shopping again!
 
 4.  FIOS internet : I could go on and on about the internet here but it wouldn&apos;t change a thing right now so why stress, right? Slow internet is a way of life here and VPN or no VPN , it&apos;s still slow albeit you can get to places you couldn&apos;t otherwise. I will cherish my FIOS internet when I get home and be eternally grateful. That is unless we move to China some day.........but then again my husband said they&apos;re bringing high-speed internet here. But I bet they&apos;re not taking down the firewall anytime soon....... 
 
 5.  my dishwasher/clothes dryer : I would have to say I miss the dishwasher a lot more then the clothes dryer. Doing dishes by hand is no fun but then again, doing dishes in general is no fun. I will be happy to have a dishwasher again :-). The clothes dryer is a nice to have but I actually started hanging clothes out before we left for China. It&apos;s an energy saver and I just like to. However, when you need something quickly, when it&apos;s raining/winter and you don&apos;t have an enclosed sun room or if you want to throw them in on the wrinkle cycle instead of ironing, a dryer comes in handy.
 
 6.  my Dyson/hard floor cleaner : While I wouldn&apos;t call myself a domestic goddess, I detest cleaning, obviously it&apos;s something that must be done (until I can hire a maid of course :-)). And the vacuum cleaners in China s.u.c.k! I cannot stand to vacuum and leave behind all the little strings and lint on the throw rugs, argghh! If I were to live here again, my Dyson would make the journey with me. I also have a Hoover hard floor cleaner for my hardwoods and I LOVE it. I&apos;ve also missed that since I&apos;ve been here.
 
 7.  being able to understand: I miss being able to understand labels, people, signs and so much more AND being completely understood! When I go to the grocery store, I&apos;m a label reader. I like to know exactly what&apos;s in the products I&apos;m buying for me and my family. Here, it&apos;s a leap of faith aside from the products that are marked with an &quot;S&quot;. My mother-in-law instructed us to buy only products marked with a particular &quot;S&quot; label. But how much sodium, fat, fiber, etc is in that product.....I have absolutely no clue!
 
 8.  ice maker : It seems like such a small thing but I&apos;m soooo tired of having to refill the ice cube trays. Then I must get them back into our itty bitty little freezer drawers w/out spilling them everywhere. And did I mention how small the refrigerators are here, ugh?! I want to walk up to our refrigerator and press my glass against the ice dispenser and have it shoot ice out at me. Oh, and not to mention I can choose between crushed or whole cubes!!
 
 9.  dollar bins ;-) and shopping in ONE store: Yes, I love to go into Target or the dollar store and find cheap junk and the kids do too. And even though I like to support mom and pop stores, it is really convenient to be able to shop in one store for most of the things you need. In China, if you need poster paint, you have to go over near the art gallery. I never made it there the entire five months we&apos;ve been here. I had to settle for these itty bitty tubes of paint that last for through a couple of art projects. And Michaels craft store , here we come :-). The kids and I are seriously going through withdrawal!
 
 10. Zumba : I love my Zumba fitness classes and I&apos;m looking forward to getting back in shape. I cannot imagine how long it will take me to get back in the Zumba zone but I&apos;m looking forward to some ME time. I&apos;m also looking forward to that awesome rush you get after a workout along with the feeling of a &apos;clear head&apos;! I need one right about now :-).
 
 Today is officially National Day of the People&apos;s Republic of China. More history can be found here . It&apos;s similar to our Independence Day in the United States.

 You Know You&apos;re a Beijingren When.... 

 09/30/2011 

 1 Comment 
   I was talking with my niece the other day and I told her that I wanted to do a post on all the quirky things that sum up life in Beijing. So we started to brainstorm ways in which we have crossed over that imaginary line. The point where we have started to do things that put us in the same category as a native Beijing person (Beijingren).

 Top Ten Signs You Know You&apos;re Becoming a Beijingren: 

 1. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you no longer eat street food for a snack, you bring it home for dinner! Yup, that&apos;s right folks, we&apos;ve done this several times now. Just last night we ate street food for dinner. We had nothing to fix in the refrigerator and we were on our way home from being out all day. So Anthony hopped off at one of the bus stops that has our favorite mix of street food and brought some home for everyone.

 2. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when your four year old has pulled down her pants and gone pee in public. This is a regular practice with the locals. Young children (most of the time) either squat and go (if they have split pants) or are held up near a tree and allowed to &apos;water&apos; (or fertilize :-0) it. And I&apos;ve actually embraced this practice (not the fertilizer part) when my daughter has whined &quot;I have to go peeeeeee&quot; and there&apos;s no toilet in sight or we&apos;ll never make it to the nearest one or the line for the toilet is SUPER long. Some things about being a Beijingren are quite liberating, ha ha!

 3. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you no longer wonder why people are digging through the trash. Instead, you hand them your empty water bottle and feel good you can help them earn a few more kuai! Nearly everywhere you go, there is a person digging through the trash while carting around a big sack of recyclables. They do this in shopping centers, the zoo, parks, the grocery store, the subway, simply everywhere. 

 4. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you&apos;ve mastered the art of the &apos;squat toilet&apos;. And folks, I&apos;m serious, there&apos;s an art form in making sure you don&apos;t tinkle anywhere else (around you or on you) while going potty. I actually carry an extra pair of undies when we go out for each of the girls as it&apos;s inevitable that one of them will accidentally tinkle on themselves. But I haven&apos;t had to use them much lately ;-), they&apos;re getting it down, literally! 

 5. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you push and shove, just like the locals :-0. It&apos;s just a way of life here, Chinese people do not wait in queue, period. So unless you want to wait all day to get on the bus or the subway or through any line, you better learn how to get yourself in there and get things done. These people don&apos;t mess around. If you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll never get a seat on the bus or the subway. And trust me, queue or no queue, seats are hard to come by. The kids have even learned exactly how long it takes for the subway doors to open and then they&apos;re the first ones to run through the doors in search of a seat. They actually count, 1, 2, 3.....and then they yell &quot;go&quot;! What can I say, I&apos;ll have to teach them all over again when we get back to the States&lt;sigh&gt;.

 6. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you hear someone hack up half their lung and you don&apos;t even flinch anymore. There is actually a name for it, it&apos;s called the Beijing cough. And it&apos;s the result of living many years in a place where the air quality index often soars well beyond that of many cities in the States. Coal still dominates as an energy source and regulations for air quality are nearly nonexistent. Along with the hacking usually comes the spitting, ewwww!

 7. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you no longer close your eyes when you ride in a taxi. The rules of the road are totally different here and to say they drive aggressively is a serious understatement. In the States, those entering the roadway must yield. Here, cars entering the roadway have the right of way and those already on the road are expected to &apos;slow down&apos; for them. I&apos;ve ridden in many Beijing (and China) taxis before this trip so I was well versed. However, I&apos;ll never forget when Anthony got out of his first taxi ride here and said, &quot;I will never ride in another taxi here again&quot;. And what is the end result of that? He&apos;s ridden in dozens and dozens of taxis since that day!!! You adjust and I guess if you&apos;re religious, you could pray if you like! But I just look out the window and enjoy the scenery quickly flying by me :-). 

 8. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you&apos;ve gotten used to walking up and down and up and down stairs so many times that you don&apos;t even realize you&apos;re doing it anymore. When you take public transportation here, having an escalator is a privilege and not something you should expect. And when you transfer from one subway line to the next, they&apos;re often faaaaaar away from each other.

 I remember when we first got here and we would go on an outing. One good example is the zoo. The trip entails taking a bus to the subway, walking up a set of several steps into the subway station, then more than likely walking up steps to the subway platform. You then take the subway and then transfer to another line. This involves walking and walking and going up stairs and then down stairs and walking some more. Then you get on the subway, get off and walk down the stairs and finally, you&apos;re at the zoo, in which you must walk around. Then when you go home you do it ALL OVER AGAIN. And if you&apos;re pooped from your day out, too bad because you then have to climb up eight flights of stairs to get to your apartment, phewww! It&apos;s a way of life here.

 9. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you&apos;re waiting for the subway or sit down to eat at a fast food restaurant and people ask you if you&apos;d like to buy some stolen and/or counterfeit goods. The following has happened to us in the last two weeks. A guy in the subway tried to sell Anthony a Nokia cell phone for 800 kuai. You&apos;re cell phones are NOT safe here, guard them at all times. They&apos;re pick pocketed in a matter of seconds and sims cards are replaced even faster. Even the subway personnel have tried to get in on the act, seriously. Anthony left his iPhone behind and had to cause a scene before the subway worker relented and gave it back to him. And y esterday, we were in a McDonald&apos;s near the Silk Market and Jessica had a lady try to sell her knock off Louis Vuitton wallets, Rolex watches and Reebok socks. 

 10. You know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you don&apos;t notice everyone staring at you all the time. Actually, you really know you&apos;re becoming a Beijingren when you begin to stare at other people just as long and hard as others stare at you ! And trust me folks, we are a spectacle around here! Two American women, one American man and three Chinese girls, hmmmmmm. After my husband left, I really wanted to get a t-shirt printed up that said, &quot;Wo de xiansheng shi Beijingren&quot; &quot;My husband is from Beijing&quot;. Because every time I tell the &apos;starers&apos; that, they say, &quot;Ohhhhhhh&quot;, because they finally get it, kind of, ha ha! And my daughters have learned to say, &quot;Wo de ba ba Beijingren&quot; &quot;My father is from Beijing&quot; so now I really don&apos;t need that t-shirt as I&apos;ve taught them how to answer that inevitable question when strangers quizzically stare at them!! 

 But you know what, I wouldn&apos;t change my experience here for anything in the world. I&apos;m actually kind of sad to leave when I feel that I&apos;ve finally gotten the hang of things!

 Tian&apos;anmen Square 

 09/27/2011 

 2 Comments 
   Today we visited Tian&apos;anmen Square. The last time we visited, we were the proud new parents of twin baby girls. This picture was taken on our adoption trip in 2003. I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was FREEZING cold and on our return cab ride home, Alaina cried the entire time :-(. Aww, my little pink marshmallow puffs!
 And this my friends, is my twin baby girls, eight years later.......And they still whine and cry just like it was yesterday! No, seriously, they were a bit on the cranky side today. I&apos;m thirsty, this is boring, I can&apos;t wait to get out of this place (China) and go home, blah, blah, blah. Eight year old&apos;s are so, so, moody and it&apos;s only going to get worse! But oh how I love them so.
 The place was definitely decked out in flowers, the landscaping was pretty nice. As you can probably see from the pictures, the air was really hazy, dusty or full of pollution. Or maybe it was all three, who knows but visibility was terrible.
 So what&apos;s one to do after frolicking through the flowers? Why go see dead people of course. No seriously, this picture shows Mao&apos;s Mausoleum, located in the center of the square. His embalmed body, encased in a crystal casket and draped with a red flag, is on display for visitors to see. They raise it up from it&apos;s refrigerated chambers below for daily viewings.
And the verdict is.........creepy, just way creepy. Let him go people, let him Goooooooo, he&apos;s dead already, dead, dead, DEAD. And to think, Mao wanted to be cremated. Just do it already!

 We had literally minutes to spare before the daily viewing was over. Normally there is a long, long line that takes over an hour to get through. The twins and I literally walked right up, got scanned for explosives, metal, guns, etc. and went in. No purses, cameras (boo), flip flops, tank tops, hats, etc. allowed. In the entrance there is a big white statue of him sitting in a chair. Behind the statue is a mural of the sky with clouds. You walked to the side, behind the mural, and there he is. At first I thought his face was glowing but as we got up closer I realized they had lights shining on his face.

 So how does a guy whose been dead for 35 looooong years look? Actually not bad when you have daily repair, ha ha! I was pretty surprised, he looked darn close to his picture, hair and all. If you&apos;re ever in Beijing and would like to visit, a few pointers: arrive before noon, it&apos;s not open on Monday and don&apos;t forget your passport, it&apos;s required to enter the mausoleum.
 This building is the Great Hall of the People. This is the seat of the Chinese legislature. Portions of it are open daily, except when the People&apos;s Congress is in session. Look at that haze, just icky.
 Located at the very southern end of the square is Qian Men or &apos;Front Gate&apos;. It is the largest of the nine gates that were part of Beijing&apos;s inner city wall. It was constructed during the Ming Dynasty. Speaking of gates, security was extremely tight in and around the square today. While it&apos;s always heavily guarded, today you could feel the hustle and bustle in the air. Preparations are definitely underway for the upcoming National or Independence Day on October, 1. Soldiers were out and about in large groups, temporary bathrooms were being erected along with some other temporary shelters, etc. The square was also gated off in a weird fashion. I was thinking of going back to the Forbidden City (right across the street) on Thursday but.........I think I&apos;ll hold off until all the festivities are over.
 After Tian&apos;anmen Square, we took the metro one stop over to Wanfujing for lunch. This is where we got the scorpions last time. And no, we didn&apos;t go to eat bugs this round, although the kids were asking for them (ugh!). However, we did eat something I&apos;m sure all of you can relate to, Pizza Hut! BTW, this is not a statue but an actual person, pretty cool, huh?! If the weather holds out, I&apos;m thinking maybe the zoo on Thursday??? Stay posted.
