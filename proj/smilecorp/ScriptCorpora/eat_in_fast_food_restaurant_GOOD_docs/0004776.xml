But when we search home builders such as *east forest homes they don&apos;t have prices or blue prints only their motto and what they do.. where can i get this information WITHOUT going to them directly?Thanks any advice is appreciated! :)  more 


Resolved Question: We bought a brand new home that has a flooded basement within 6 months. Can we sue the builder?
We bought a brand new house from the builder in 2007 and paid extra money to have the basement fully finished. Within 6 months, the basement was flooded. We notified the builder, since it was well within the warranty period, the builder sent someone to do the repair, but before the repair was done, the basement got flooded again. Within 2 years, the basement was flooded 4 times, so in the end of 2008 the builder decided to installed a sump pump, which temporarily took care of the issue for 2 years. In 2011 and this year, basement was flooded again. We contacted the builder, of course their response is that we are out of warranty period and they already installed a sump pump to take care of the problem. So I have no choice but to hire someone to do the repair. My workers found out the builder did not waterproof the basement/ foundation. Do you think I have the right to ask the builder to cover the repair fee? Thanks in advance for your advice.  more 


Resolved Question: strike noise in a townhouse?
I would like to hear suggestions of what to do about strike noise from both my neighbours. Strike noise is basically bumping noises, but no speech can be heard. It&apos;s almost like someone hitting the wall on the other side in varying degrees.This place is only 2 years old and I believe there should have been some building code which would prevent any noise being heard from the neighbours. Tonight I can hear what appears to be the neighbours playing a game like Call of Duty through their stereo. Other times the other neighbours walks around their room like elephants as well as what sounds like them slamming the doors almost off the hinges, in particular, just when I&apos;ve gone to bed.I have talked to them but they claim they can hear no noises.Having looked in the roof area I found there is adequate isolation between the units but L-shaped brackets join the mid-section gyprock to my (and their) structure, which appears to be the strike noise transfer points. I am unsure how many of these brackets there are. Apparently the best thing would be to rip the plaster off and replace all of these brackets with what&apos;s called resilimounts (sound isolating mounts) and thicker wall batts (with sound isolation properties). This of course may run into the thousand$.It&apos;s a bit dis-heartening thinking this is my first home and because the builder decided to seriously cut corners I have a real problem. At the least, I could work to acoustically isolate the master bedroom alone so I no longer have to wear ear plugs just to sleep. The other option is to consider this a bad investment and look to sell, which is an ugly dilemma having to look for a new place, bridging loans etc...Can anyone suggest something I could consider? If the builder hasn&apos;t adhered to building codes, I&apos;ll drag their ass back in here and have them rip the place down at their expense! That would be the favourable solution but I don&apos;t even know where to start with that. I have contacted them and their&apos;association&apos;about another shotty piece of workmanship but they&apos;re full of excuses and BS.  more 


Resolved Question: Big family row?? not sure if its my fault?
i have quite a big family, im the youngest of four girls (now 19.) My dad left when i was younger and we dont see much of him, so its just me and my sisters and my mum. All my sisters had moved out, me being the last to go to uni in september, but then my sister and her boyfriend and one year old son moved in says after i left. This is because they was attempting to save up for a house for six months. Then a few months later, a family friend owned a house and offered my sisters boyfriend too re-do it entirely, so they agreed. My sister then found out she is pregnant again, so they was on a time issue. They was due to move out the begining of april, but have been longing it out massivly. My sisters bf works weekdays as a builder then weekends at their new house. But they are being very lazy. My sister tidies up regularly (considering 90% of the mess is hers and her bf and babies) and they pay very minimal rent to my mum who struggles a lot financially. Whenever i come home for easter and christmas i felt very unwelcome in my house becos of my sister, she making me feel like i was a burden and not wanted there. I finished for summer about a month ago and moved home immediatly too look for work, and things have been getting tense. They are being so lazy with there new house and my mum is loosing her temper, cos although my sister does pick up her stuff everyday, my mum does all the cooking for the whole family even though she works full time (and is getting on a bit) while my sister does nothing all day. This morning i woke up too my sister shouting the bathroom was disgusting, my mum asked why and my sister accused me of leaving period on the toilet. i shouted out that im not even on my period and she said&apos;well im pregnant, and my boyfriend is a boy&apos;and i said&apos;well im not on my period so its kindof irrelevant..&apos;she called a c u n t and i just drifted back off too sleep (she can be very aggressive and wants everyon to feel sorry for her all the time) next thing i knw i hear my mum telling her she has no right too speak to my like that, and they start rowing a lot. My sister was being very very rude to my mother, saying she&apos;lives like a pig&apos;and&apos;feels like shes been bought into the house to be a cleaner&apos;and my mother was saying my sister is in dillusion if she feels like she does all the housework. My sister kept bringing me into it saying i sleep all day and contribute nothing, (which yes i do stay in bed till 11am cos i am still on uni time and cant get to sleep until 3am, but i am woken up at 7am by my sister and nephew but i am too tired to get up) and i spend the rest of my days desperatly pounding the pavements looking for full time work. And yes, i dont clean up her and her boyfriends and nephews stuff, but i do my own. i dnt see why i should clean up her stuff when she is home all day, and im working part time.. But anyway, they had a big row and my sister left with my nephew. i went out for the day and when i came home they was in the loft area (where their bedrooms are) and then i heard the front door slam. I went downstaires and my mother is crying in the kitchen, because my sister came out and told her that becuse of her they are leaving and staying with her boyfriends mum for a week before they move into their new house. I feel very guilty, i dont know if it is my fault or not. I feel like i did nothing, i didnt start any argument even tho she accused me of something i didnt do and called me a rude name and was nasty about me to my mother. I want to text her, but i dont want too receive the barrage of abuse i will inevitably get, what to do?? is it my fault??  more 


Voting Question: I rent a home with 13 acres of property and our landlord likes to come up to the property unannounced or call?
I rent a home on 13 acres of property. I share and have to pay half the cost of snow removal 125.00 every 4 inches per the lease our driveway is 1/3 of a mile long into the woods. The landlords home is on the shared drive and has they own 14 plus acres. They have come up to our home with other people and dogs unannounced. They were showing their guest their new acquired property. A few weeks later my dog was barking for about 10 to 15 mins until I walked down my drive where I found the women lurking around and standing behind the wooded circular drive. This was at dusk. I approached her and ask that in the future would she please give me notice. Her response was&quot;Why would I do that?&quot;. I explained to her that we rented this home far out in the wood for peace and privacy and that my two teenage daughters and I were uncomfortable with people just walking about the property. I do have concerns for my daughters 17 and 15. I explained that their dog has attacked mine (she witnessed one time with her and my child there again walking up our drive) and that the dog show aggression toward me when he was up on my porch taking my dogs bones and going into my house. Several days later the husband walked up to my home on a Tuesday 4:00 in the afternoon with my children in the house and stood less then 25 feet from the front of my house with his dog unleashed. I have failed to mention that the front of our home is ALL glass sliders and many very large windows with no shades available on bedrooms or any other room. I would have to custom for they are 65, 75, and 109 inches wide. Well that was it for me. I had a meeting with them explained to them what my concerns again where and told them that they need to call me when they were coming up. They did not like this. They said they rented the house not the land and that they wanted to enjoy their property and walk, cross country ski and enjoy there land when they want to. They also told that if I lived in the city I would not be able to tell people passing my house that they couldn&apos;t. Really? I again told them that they never mentioned this to us when we were being shown the property or it being in the lease and I never would have been ok with it had I known. We really are that far in the woods I would never moved here. My peace of mind is so off. And I just don&apos;t understand what part of two young women this man doesn&apos;t get. Well it seemed to stop and we have not been bothered from what I have seen. However I know they are still around. Now it is 3 months before we have to sign a new lease with them and they have given us the new one and it has changed so much. She made a map of the property and shaded in green what would be the land that we rent. Well that would be about 25feet around the house. No driveway not much land. I still have to pay the plow. They also claimed a shed on our drive way under my bedroom window that was theirs and not to be used and then stated that they could use the property with out any conditions. I also noticed that they left a foot pathway so that they could come around our house. Unannounced. This footpath way is just so creepy I can not explain it. Now you are going to tell me to move. Well the town that we live does not have any rentals. I have a family of 5 and considering the economy the way it is anyone displaced due to foreclosure or whatever are jumping on anything that comes available and there are major bidding war to raise the rent. Competition is just so high. I moved here being told that they would be renting this home forever. They did not want to sell and have a builder come and buy the land. I felt that it was just right. They are pulling a bait and switch on me. They even gave me after I moved in a manual. OMG! They have a hunter come on the property October through December. Again unannounced and I have no idea where he is on my property while he is there. I came home tonight to get a message that they were going to plant junipers at the Field House (that&apos;s what they call it) well I didn&apos;t get the message until Sunday morning and my 15 year old daughter told me tonight that when she was by herself on Saturday she heard voices under her bedroom window and saw both landlords and dog planting right under her window. Help!!! Anything you can tell me will help me figure out even a little of my rights. They think there landbarrons and kinda feeling very creepy. I live in Massachusetts.  more 


Voting Question: Constructive Criticism needed for Resume?
I re-wrote my resume It&apos;s one page and with the information I think is most important. I was told to remove my objective, interests/hobbies, volunteer work and social activities (those last two because they were too old because that stuff happened in high school and no one seems interested in that).I didn&apos;t obtain a degree because I was forced to drop out, my dad died and i lost my financial aid so I couldn&apos;t afford the cost to finish. So I was told that it&apos;s best to mention that you had some college course work completed and to list the dates I attended the school.I also have two versions of the resume. One with complete contact information that will be posted to linkedin, monster, career builder, etc. The other one just has a email contact (for safety reasons) that I plan on posting to places like google+, craigslist, backpage, job.com, beyond and so on and so forth.So don&apos;t worry about the contact information. I want to know if there is something that needs to changed or added or if it looks professional and suitable enough for potential employers.Please keep in mind I do not have a college degree and I&apos;m just looking for a job and since this seems to be important or a prerequisite to a job interview, I&apos;m doing so. I appreciate all the help ahead of time!!here&apos;s my resume:https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3wm58QE0oYKR09JbTE1QURlMzQOnly read this if you want to know about the GAP between 2008 to the present:The reason I left my last job in 2008 was because I was moving to a new city to finish college that was 2hrs away from home&amp;job.So in 2009 I went to phoenix university online and didn&apos;t work out and I left, then that fall I went to a trade school that didn&apos;t work out due to transportation problems and I left. Plus I felt that I wasn&apos;t mentally prepared for school since my father died Thanksgiving 2008 during my last year at Penn State and which resulted lost of my student aid and that extra help. It became too expensive.I did job search and most of the jobs I applied to, told me I couldn&apos;t apply/work there because I didn&apos;t have reliable transportation. So January 2010 I still tried to job search and then decided to try a home school program, but I found out they were unaccredited and just wanted my money and I stopped participating. I went back to the trade school (from before) September 2010 and stayed the whole quarter/semester and I was in the right frame of mind. Unfortunately they put me out due to having no financial aid and no money and told me not to come back. Plus they said that my being late every morning was major problem, but I told them that I was having transportation issues.So I job searched and applied to a lot of the grocery, department stores and clothing stores and was told I wasn&apos;t the&quot;candidate&quot;they were looking for to speeches about how the now hiring sign was meant for someone more professional and I doubted that personally. Then to the whole&quot;we don&apos;t hire your kind here&quot;I&apos;ve been at this non stop since January and haven&apos;t gotten any job or any offers. But I also think the jobs are being unreasonable. I don&apos;t have reliable transportation and the town I live in has little to no job or employment opportunities. So a job 2hrs away isn&apos;t going to work if I&apos;m relying on horrible public transit (Pittsburgh Port Authority). I also take care of my sick disabled mother and working during the day is the only pliable way for me. I would rather not leave her by herself at night since we live in a violence prone neighborhood or as most people call it the&quot;HOOD&quot;  more

Resolved Question: Am I tool ate to sue the builder?
About ten years ago I had my house built, in Alberta, Canada. When we took possession the builder told us we did not need the realtor present. Being a new home owner I was not sure what I should really be looking for. About 3 years later the builder disappeared. I found him yesterday trading under a new name. In the mean time I noticed various problems with the building as follows:-1. The driveway – it was laid 2/3 years too early, and has been collapsing and breaking up for 7 years because the foundation was not allowed to settle first.2. Siding that has been coming away.3. Baseboards/and or corner pieces. One size of baseboard and another size for the corner pieces – this was pointed out to us when we had the the basement developed. So nothing matches.4. Gas fire incorrectly installed. A piece of gas pipe was doubled back on itself cutting the gas flow, so we have never had the full benefit from it.5. A fan that we paid for that is supposed to be in the fire place. The switch is on the wall but is not actually connected to anything!6. A normal electrical socket in the bathroom and not the one that trips if water get in it! 7. No insulation on the skylight walls, this started to be evident during the winters when we got ice inside. I confirmed it had no insulation this morning, when I went up there and looked. We had the place painted the other day and the painter thought there was something wrong!My question is can I go to small claims court and get the above rectified at the builders expense.OK, so I cannot sue, but could I name him in a letter to the paper (and be safe because everything is true).  more 


Voting Question: Real Estate Agent Dilemma and New Home Construction?
We (fiance and I) have been working with a real estate agent for about 6 months trying to find a new home in our area. However, the inventory here does not really offer what we are looking for so we decided to explore new construction.When speaking with a builder today I mentioned we have been working with a real estate agent and asked when he would get involved. The builder said he would advise the agent only work with us on the land purchase and if he were retained for the completed home purchase the builder would have to charge extra to account for commission. The builder advised us not to retain our real estate agent for the home purchase.Does something sound fishy here? On one hand it sounds reasonable that the builder would have to charge extra for the real estate commission. The commission is a lot of $$$ and I obviously want to save $$$ if I go with the new home option.However, it seems wrong to throw our agent to the curb when he has been working with us and has been genuinely helpful the past 6 months. Based on our research the builder is reputable and we obviously like our agent.Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!  more 


Resolved Question: Let down by our Builder...HELP!?
We recently had and extension started on our house. The builder that we chose seemed like the perfect guy we wanted to do our work. He got the footings passed by building regs&amp;we didn&apos;t know whats what in building work, he sent us an invoice for an amount exceeding what we shouldve been charged for DPC level, which is what he claimed it was. Still trusting him we paid the full amount plus VAT. The 2nd time Building regs came he said it had passed but I was suspicious. His workmen had started on our bathroom and cloakroom, claiming they could not find a matching brick to our original house brick&amp;had a time frame to catch up. We went out and found a similar brick in 3 days by week 3. The bathroom shouldve taken 1 week and 5 weeks later still isn&apos;t complete. The plumber wouldn&apos;t turn up, the tiler kept missing tiles or grouting in places or covering it up or the boxing was diagonal they even called their electrician to get the spotlight cut into the new ceiling and he ended up hitting the joist! Then I was left with a nice hole in the ceiling, my original light hanging lose&amp;my pull cord lose with all wires exposed. Yet they said my children could use the shower as it was safe! OMG! One of my kids couldve died and they didn&apos;t even care! We are lucky as we do have an ensuite, but 5 people first thing in the morning is still a bit of rush. I was told to get the electrician some wiring, yes originally it was included, I went out the next day and they cleared the garage of all their tools. On the same day even though the tiler hadnt finished his work, he left after saying&apos;he wasn&apos;t getting paid enough for this and it wasn&apos;t fair on him.&apos;I just think I was gobsmacked and didn&apos;t know what to say. My house had turned into the hammer house of horrors and the nightmare wasn&apos;t ending! They eventually they stopped taking our calls or replying to our texts. 6 days was the last time we heard from any of them in a civil manner and that was only because I txt the builder saying we wanted to make our extension bigger! All of a sudden he called husband saying&apos;alrite mate sorry I missed your call....&apos;yea ring us like 6 hours later! Then he stopped responding again, so my husband sent him an email stating we would take it further and still gave him time to refund our money&amp;clear the mess he had made outside our home, seriously it was lots of rubbish! Instead we received an email back saying he was taking us to court for breach of contract (not that we had signed one) and loss of earning...*!&amp;!*&apos;..He also went on to say that OUR behaviour was not right with him or his employee&apos;s! Yet I was making them coffee every 2 hours&amp;letting his employees have full access of our kitchen Not forgetting I made sandwiches, gave them biscuits and even got you mcdonalds! And on top of that they took my hose pipe, ruined two new buckets, used my towels (white) to clean screed, ruined two of my mops etc the list is endless. I think I should send them a bill. Don&apos;t forget I still got leaks in the bathroom, my cloakroom toilet isn&apos;t fixed&amp;the waste in there is leaking! I just remembered they couldnt be bothered to fit the bathroom toilet to wall so they stuck a tile behind it to support it but the toilet wobbles as its not fixed to the floor securely. So as you can see we didn&apos;t get our money back and we don&apos;t want him back in our house and tbh I&apos;ve only listed a few problems. It goes on and on and on..........So anyone out there who can give me some advice or just please tell me I&apos;m not the only person who got done by cowboy builders!And before you say it...yes I have reported them to rogue traders&amp;trading standards but I am also informing other authorities but please feel free to list others just in case they may have slipped my mind!Thank you for reading my problem.  more 


Resolved Question: Question on Real Estate Buyer&apos;s Agent?
A person signs an exclusive buyer&apos;s agent agreement in one state, then after a month of seeing resale properties in their home state and not finding anything, decides to visit a new home builder in a different state where their buyer&apos;s agent is not licensed. If the person ultimately executes a purchase contract with the new home builder, can they still be bound to the agreement made with the unlicensed buyer&apos;s agent?The agreement says the buyer shall not visit a new home builder without the agent, but the agent is not licensed in the state where the builder is so I don&apos;t see how she could represent (and subsequently get paid) on a new home contract.  more 


Voting Question: Our Lawn on our brandnew home is shot, can we sue the builders?
We don&apos;t know if we need to sue, we will be asking for a new lawn, it wont grow properly so we have been fertilizing and maintaining and finally decided to rototill and lay new grass, we did a small patch and found a crater or boulder and we can not remove this ourselves, we have also found many many rocks. its also very uneven and hard to do with my push mower. it was a crappy job. Shouldn&apos;t one have a reasonable expectation of NOT have huge rocks under their lawn?Thanks  more 


Resolved Question: Our HOA fees paid for services not in the contract. Can we sue to get our money back?
Let me clarify a little. It states in the HOA contract, that they will maintain the common ground (which is a 40 x 40 patch of grass) and snow plowing in the subdivision. Come to find out this year, the builder has been paying out $6000 to mow the empty lots in the subdivision. Shouldn&apos;t the financial responsibility fall upon the builder, not the home owners? We have to mow our own grass, so they do not maintain our yard. Since the builder still owns more than 60% of the lots, there is no committee yet. When he falls to 49%, then we will be able to start our own committee and elect a leader for the HOA. Until then, what do we do? This has been happening now for 4 years. With the economy down, I don&apos;t think we will be getting new neighbors anytime here. He has maybe 20 lots to mow.Sorry, let me clarify. The HOA Fees every house pays for in our subdivision cover snow plowing and it covers the grass cutting for the common ground.When we got our statement this year, we noticed he paid $2000 to the snow plow company, and $6000 for the lawn maintenance. Keep in mind that in the HOA contract, the common ground is only a 40 foot by 40 foot patch of grass. So I walked up to the neighbors house who is cutting the empty lots, and asked him what he got paid this year from the builder to cut the grass. His reply was $6000. He asked why I wanted to know, and I responded that it seemed odd that the HOA fees were paying him to cut the grass. He agreed and thought that the builder was paying from the company account. Sorry for any confusion I caused. I was just a bit aggravated still when I was typing the question.  more 


Resolved Question: I am 100% disabled and age 52 and i recieved an inheritence. Will i be penalized by SSDI?
I have always been handicapped but i did work simple labor low wage jobs when i was younger. A relative recently passed away and left me $40K in a trust fund so that one day i may buy a nice house. Now i live in a nice mobile home with no mortgage and if i could sell it, it may possibly bring $5K in today&apos;s market. I looked at some new manufactured homes and they just don&apos;t seem to be worth the price. As of now i have read 2 of Dave Ramsey&apos;s books and i gave the money to a local investment firm with a good FA and he set me up with a diversified portfolio in many moderate Franklin Templeton mutual funds. I also have an emergency fund of $5K with them. I have been 100% disabled since 2005. Some people have suggested i may lose my SSDI benefits until i spend myself broke. I don&apos;t get food stamps or anything extra; just $880 a month after the medicare A&amp;B deduction. Am i allowed to keep the money in a safe long term investment or do i have to spend it? It just doesn&apos;t make sense to me to buy another mobile home that is&quot;new&quot;that will depreciate when i have a nice one that is depreciated already. And, i can&apos;t seem to find any decent properties to buy outright for $40K; the foreclosures around here are badly vandalized and some look beyond repair. I am unable to do much repairs on my own. And, i have talked to a few home builders in the area; they can&apos;t seem to be able to build me a cheap 1000 sq. ft. house out of wood for $40K on my property; they want $60-85K. Can anybody help and answer my question? It has been suggested by another i take it out and bury/hide it somewhere. That is very scary. Thank you in advance.  more 


Resolved Question: Asphalt driveway - requires multiple coating?
I bought a newly constructed home on a new street (unpaved) in 2006. I put asphalt driveway after the street was paved with asphalt. I was told that the street requires two coatings of asphalt and so does my driveway. 3-4years later, the builder put final coating of asphalt on the street. Now my drive way&apos;s height is maybe 3/4 inch lower at the end where it meets the road. This doesn&apos;t bother me at all. Now I am wondering why asphalt pavements require two coatings in the first place??? Should I get second coating of asphalt done? How important is this?I couldn&apos;t find much information about this online although I&apos;ve been told at the beginning that it requires another coat of asphalt.Thank you.  more 


Voting Question: Neighbor built dumpster next to my front door.. help?
I have a very rude neighbor who is renting the house next to mine. They have destroyed my fence with lots of promises to fix it but it&apos;s been over 6 months.They contantly park their cars in my yard in the mud and do not fix the heavy ruts left which is going to make it impossible to mow in the spring.Now they have made a dumpster in my yard. Let me explain... This builder rudely but regardless built this house so they had a large backyard and in doing so built their house in front of mine. So it&apos;s like an alleyway to my front door with my front yard trapped so to speak. 8 feet of my front yard is his side yard. So his side yard is like 8feet by 50 feet or something. He has decided to create with used boards a dumpster on his side yard which is only I don&apos;t k now 20 feet front my front door. and it&apos;s big and technically a good foot of it is on my property. He has in the past had old tires and used tables on my yard but today he has them inside this wooden monstrocity. He has a plenty big enough backyard to store his garbage but I guess he would like to use his yard. I cannot use my yard because the fence is broke and I won&apos;t have my kid getting hurt on it and my backyard is very tiny.. so my front yard is important to me. I own my home for only 5 years and it has droped nearly 30k in value! (not recession but due to how horrible my place looks now with his garbage everywhere. No one would want to live here and not even me anymore.Tonight he has his car parked there in the grass. Surehis car may only be 2 feet on my property by my yard is very small and now it&apos;s just making me mad. I have important people visiting me and it looks like a ghetto trailer park despite our houses being VERY new. (He has totally destroyed his house. I feel sorry for the owners). I cannot find the owners real address and they have a common name.Can I call the cops on him for this? This junk is going to give me a heart attack.. I feel like a little old person screaming get off my lawn! but man.. that fence cost me thousands and I&apos;m just getting madder and madder.Do I have any legal justifications to use on him at all? I don&apos;t even know his name.There was no house when I moved in. It was built like a month after I moved in. I didn&apos;t think I could complain about a half built house and it&apos;s layout. this is my very first home and I have no family to refer to or ask questions to.the HOA only collects the water bill... I don&apos;t think we really have one. I think there was something weird with the water in this neighborhood and for some reason it&apos;s split between two streeets. It&apos;s odd.I can only see the name which is common, as I stated, and ther eis no number or address to the owner of that house on the property records.I hadn&apos;t realized about home insurance paying for the fence. I&apos;m not even sure it can be repaired or how I can crawl through the garbage to uninstall his gate from hell to try to repair my fence. I will have to figure that out.. might be cheaper for me to save up and do it. I&apos;m sorry but I didn&apos;t understand the first part. Part of his house is behind where my house starts.. like 10 feet but it extends almost to the road so his car doesn&apos;t really fit in the driveway and he paints cars and has a broken car and has a trailer and well.. he should have rented a house out in the country with space. He paints cars in the garage even.. his house is only 4 years old and it is so thrashed. If I was the owner I&apos;d just die.  more

Resolved Question: Sceptic Smell in Brand New Build?
Three months ago, we moved into a newly built 3br 2ba home in upstate New York. After the first month or two, we noticed an occasional septic smell around the guest bathroom. We first attempted&quot;septic system treatments&quot;to conduct preventative maintenance on the system and prevent backup. The problem worsened slightly over the following few weeks. We contacted the builder, and they told us that we need to make sure we are actually using the guest bathroom or else gases will push out over time. We first started by simply running water in the guest shower every couple of days, and after no relief, I have now started taking showers in the guest bath while my wife takes showers in the master bathroom (not simultaneously). It has been a week and the smell has only worsened. We can now tell that when the guest shower is used, the master bath smells. When the master shower is used, the guest bath smells. I have used my limited knowledge of plumbing down in the basement to check all the lines, but I can&apos;t find a problem. All drainage lines have P Traps and are angled down and into the main drain line. I can&apos;t see any leaks either. Has anyone encountered this problem? Thanks for reading!  more

Resolved Question: How to get out of being on preschool committee next AGM?
My son currently attends this preschool and come September, my daughter will also.I volunteered as secretary at the last AGM because they were desperate for volunteers and the preschool may have had to have closed if they didn&apos;t replace the current secretary and treasurer. I didn&apos;t want that to be on my head, though why I took it on as my concern when there are a lot of other parents out there I don&apos;t know.Anyway, my problem is this. At the next AGM, the current chair and registrar are going to leave the committee. I think that the way they view it is that the new treasurer and I will stay on another year and either take their places and recruit other parents to fill our roles, or that we&apos;ll find other parents to fill their roles.Basically, I can&apos;t do this. I&apos;m a stay at home (full time) mum at the moment and I spend every evening working self employed as a seamstress. I quite simply do not have the time to commit another year to the committee. Not without risking loosing my source of income, which with business slow for my self employed builder husband and the possibility of him having to have a tricky hip operation next summer (which will involve a lot of recovery time), I just can&apos;t do.If I leave the committee, I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ll be able to find three replacements. With how relutant parents are to join the committee, I think it&apos;ll be a job to find two.I hate the idea of the preschool closing being on my head, but how do I get out of it.I know for some people it may seem simple, but this is a small village and it doesn&apos;t take a lot for people to turn against you and things to get nasty. I don&apos;t want things to then get trick for my kids (my son will then be in the local school and I can always take my daughter to another local preschool if needs be.Thanks for reading and any responses.  more 


Resolved Question: Why is my mother doing this?
Kay, so this is a bit complicated, but I really need an answer.So, about six months ago we moved to a new town because my dad had been working there for quite a while ( he would fly there once a week for a few days and come back). It is much more expensive than my old community, and my family finally saved up enuff money to live here. My mom didn&apos;t want to move, and she claimed many different reasons why, including that she thought the town was&quot;old looking and lower class&quot;even though it is a substantial amount more expensive. Many people were putting offers on our house back home and my mother kept delaying our move because the offers were&quot;not good enough&quot;, but i read in one of her emails she left open that it was really because she didn&apos;t want to let go of our home. Many people put contracts on our house, and they kept cancelling them. While we were in the new town renting an apartment temporarily, my mother kept complaining about wanting to go back to our old house, and that it&quot;wasnt too late yet.&quot;I was deeply annoyed because I hated the mean bullies at my old school and would be devistated to have to go back. The house finally sold, and my parents and i went too look for houses in a new housing development. There were three builders, each builder providing three models to choose from and build you a custom premium lot. Lets call each of the builders A, B, and C. First we went to A, and one of the models was perfect for our family. We all loved it and my dad was ready to put a contract on it, but my mom refused. She couldn&apos;t come up with a reason why, then claimed that&quot;the doorways werent grand enough.&quot;She said that builder B made houses with very elegant doorways and she would want one of those instead. We went to builder B and one of the models was pretty good, and my dad was ready to buy one until my mother said,&quot;the windows are too small.&quot;She claimed that builder C made houses with large windows and she would want one of those instead. We were all very frustrated with my mother, and I tried not to get upset because my mother has a perfectionist personality. We finally went to builder C, where one of the models was literally perfection. It was a good price, had a wonderful layout and everybody was happy, including my mom. Each day as i came home from school, she would tell me how she adored the house and was going to buy it. Well, as you expected, she went out of her way to find 2 flaws in the house, how the dining room was&quot;too small&quot;and how the beams supporting the porch&quot;looked like sticks.&quot;At this point I was extremely upset, and would cry secretly because my irritable personality couldn&apos;t help it. Now she wants to go back to builder B, who don&apos;t have any of the models we like available. She says we can wait, even though my whole family is anxious to leave the apartments we are renting because of all the drug usage. My older sis and dad think, since my mom has no job and is bored with her life, that she is trying to be controlling and she secretly hopes that if we can avoid buying a house, she can go home to our old town. Which is a fantasy, since our house is sold and my dads job is fine. Please tell your theory on my mothers cold footed behaviors, and how I can talk to her about it. Thanks (:  more

Resolved Question: New Log Home. Is Radiant Cooling an option?
Hello all. My fiancé and I are building a new log cabin, starting in the spring. We have decided on installing radiant heat for our heating purposes and were wondering if any new home builders have dabbled in trying radiant cooling. We love the idea of no duct work and the fact that the heating is so efficient but haven&apos;t been able to find much on radiant cooling systems.

Voting Question: House hunting and family stress?
My fiance and I are currently living with my parents. We moved in a little under a year ago, and since they graciously let us stay with them rent-free, we&apos;ve saved up enough money to by a home of our own. This should be a really exciting time for us, but unfortunately, its been the most stressful experience for both of us, especially me. Since we&apos;ve lived with my parents, my car ended up having so many mechanical problems that it would make more sense buying a brand new car, so I&apos;m having to get rides from everyone. We sleep in a small guest bedroom so everything we need is in that room, or the 2nd bathroom. Its a very small place, but we&apos;re so grateful that my parents let us stay there that we don&apos;t mind. We contributed and help around the house as much as we can. I cooked dinner at least 4 times a week for everyone, we buy groceries weekly so they don&apos;t have to provide all of the food, we clean up after ourselves and our dog, we do the dishes after dinner every night, help out with the bills if they are high, etc. But no matter what we do, it seem like its not enough. Before I walk into the house from work, I brace myself to be chewed out by my mom for something like the dog had an accident, or I left a dish out on the counter last night. I can&apos;t relax when I&apos;m home because I&apos;m constantly stressed out about being in my parents way or not helping out enough. We recently had a deal on a house that we decided against because the builder raised the price. My mom tried to negotiate with me that I should take the house but take a few things out ( the things that made us choose that house) so they&apos;ll lower the price. When I told her we pretty much decided against it, should got so annoyed she started chewing me out for a completely different subject. Both me and my fiance decided that this house is one we want to raise a family in, so we&apos;ll be in the house for a while. We found an area with good school district but doesn&apos;t have a lot of housing options except for empty lots. We wanted to see if we could have a house built, but that would take time. When I told my mom about the plan, she had a horrified almost disgusted look on her face. I know that this is a huge financial (and stressful) decision we&apos;re making, but I don&apos;t think I can take anymore stress from my mom. I can&apos;t find peace anywhere in my life, except with my fiance. I&apos;m honestly thinking about just settling for a house that I&apos;m really not thrilled about, instead of building one just so I can have some relief. Moving out into an apartment for less than 6 months just seems like a waist of money, but we&apos;re considering that option even if it means dipping into the house fund. What else can I do other than what I&apos;m doing now to cause less stress while living in my parents house? Please help...I need help.  more 


Resolved Question: Tips for building my own PC?
I&apos;m a first time builder saving up money for a new computer and would like some tips and hardware suggestions for a budget&lt;600$, but be upgradable when necessary. I mainly use my computer for Video/photo/sound editing, watching videos, listening to music, Internet of course and some gaming.I do allot of file converting, compression and rendering so a 6 or 8 core processor would probably be the best option but I&apos;m not willing to pay over 250$ for just a processor.What type of ram should I get? Is there a huge difference between 1333mhz 1600 and 1866 and is triple or quad channel memory worth the extra cost over dual channel?And for a motherboard I would like something somewhat future proof that has decent intergrated graphics/sound (I will get dedicated later) and is completely upgradable with dual GPU support and plenty of PCI slots for sound cards and the like, but also be from a company that makes high quality parts and has a good warranty.For storage, would the best option to get a small ssd like a 64GB as a primary for just windows and a few essential programs with a Standard 7200 rpm for most other programs and files?Would a raid setup with 10k or 15k rpm drives be better or is it not worth it?What kind of case should I get since I&apos;m on a budget? I plan on using just air cooling and I want a case that has good fans in it. Also can you trust the power supply that comes with the case or is it best to just buy one.Just a few more simple questionsIs a PCI NIC worth the price over the onboard LAN, does it have better latency when playing online games?Are Intel processors worth getting over AMD for people who are on a budget?AMD Radeon vs Nvidia Geforce which is better overall and why?And for windows, what version would be the best for me? Is the home edition good enough? I&apos;ve been using windows 7 home for a while now and haven&apos;t found anything I could not do. What would I be missing out on over pro or ultimate?Also I am not going to do this right away I&apos;m thinking maybe early next year (whenever hard drive prices go down) so if there are some good processors coming out in early 2012, besides 2nd generation amd bulldozer I would like to now about them.All help will be appreciated.

Resolved Question: Foundation problems?!?! i just bought a new home, but before i bought it i found a crack in the foundation. So?
I hired an inspector who insisted that the builder get a structurl engineer report. Well the builder got the report and it said that it was just a shrinkage crack.

It looks like its coming from the original crack. I don&apos;t want them to keep blowing me off. Today they came out and said the concrete curled. They make it out to be no big deal.

Voting Question: Why are so many people in management positions in the hospitality industry so incompetent, and hateful.?
When I arrived in Atlanta in the early&apos;80s the hospitality industry was the main industry.There were major conventions here from February- June. Now virtually all the big conventions have gone somewhere else( Poultry, Home Builders,Super Show), just to name a few.The restaurants used to be fantastic too. Places like the Abbe, Mansion, Hedgerows Heights Inn, were places where the waiters new their craft and performed efficiently in packed dining rooms with reservations at 200 or more often. Now, the so called servers don&apos;t know anything about wines, food, and you find yourself paying top dollar to be void of any sense of a&quot;special occasion&quot;. As a now so called server I find that managers don&apos;t put any effort into their staff, no wine classes, proper table service, sales techniques etc. Instead they seem to hire servers as if they were hiring exotic dancers where the impression is&quot;just look hot&quot;. Don&apos;t the managers realize that the guests dates are uncomfortable with&quot;flirty servers&quot;? Times have changed, I realize that this is the&quot;Porn Age&quot;, but it makes one wonder where the class in the industry went.Are you guys kidding me? Africans, and diversity are simple words describing this planet from the beginning of time. Sir, your vague answer only says to me that when you get a service or a product from a member of the human race you&apos;re critical and suspicious mind kicks in. Maybe you need your own island, by yourself to be satisfied. As for a professional waiter, Ms. you seem quite nice, but anyone who performs for money is a professional. Those of us who perform for free are amateurs. I might add that amateurs perform for the love of what they do. Maybe the industry in this country as a whole is under achieving because of the deep seated narcissism our people have acquired. Maybe the few who are truly proficient in their crafts respectively are a dying breed, and or systematically being minimized and discounted in order that the simple minded people ( who seem to be the majority ) can point fingers at Africans, and the diverse peoples of our world.I am Christopher C.

Resolved Question: Which windows 7 should I buy?
I&apos;ve been reading a lot but I still can&apos;t find a definitive answer to a few questions about which version I need to buy.First of all, I built my computer about 3 years ago (2gh AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor, 2gb ram currently, and plenty of hard drive space). I am assuming that some day I&apos;ll probably need to upgrade my motherboard and would like the security of knowing that I will be able to use this copy of windows 7 on my system when that time comes.I have read that&quot;system builder&quot;home premium (the $99 version which comes in either 64bit or 32bit separately) actually does register itself to one hardware profile and I will not be able to do this. There is also a&quot;home premium&quot;that costs $180, comes in a different package and says that it includes both 32bit and 64bit versions of windows 7. Will this version lock itself into one hardware profile? Will I be able to upgrade my motherboard and still use this copy of the operating system? And if so will I have to reinstall the operating system or will the new bios and old installation of windows cooperate and run fine?Any help is appreciated. Thank you.  more 


Resolved Question: Can I break my lease if I have mice?
We moved in a few months ago, but just recently noticed (as the weather became colder) that we have mice. When we first moved in, we noticed mouse traps and specifically asked Foxtons if there was a problem with mice in the apartment. They said&quot;Not to their knowledge&quot;which is hard to believe since neighbors we have spoken with in the past few months said this has been an ongoing problem with this flat and Foxtons has rented it before (it is garden level) also Foxtons must have noticed the traps when they came to paint before we moved in. We called pest control. They found that the floor in the kitchen underneath the appliances was never finished (!) so our dishwasher, oven etc are just resting on the bare ground (dirt). The pest control sealed the holes he found as best he could but said that it is only a short term fix, because as the weather gets colder the mice will just dig new holes and come inside. In order to really fix the problem, he said, you would have to get a builder out to rip out the entire kitchen and replace the floor. I have two small children under the age of two and am worried about the mice as I know they carry diseases. Can I break the lease, if the landlord does not want to replace the kitchen? Even if he agrees to replace the kitchen, I do not want to live in a flat with construction in the kitchen with two small children at home. Can we break the lease?  more 


Resolved Question: Connecting to the National Grid?
I am building a new home together with 2 other self builders and we need to connect to the national grid. The three new properties will be built on land that I have just purchased where a house already exists and is connected to the National Grid. I have contacted&quot;Western Power&quot;the company responsible for the National Grid in the Exeter area of Devon, where the existing house is sited. I have asked Western Power to provide me with a quotation to connect the 3 new properties to the grid. The current property is fed from 3 phase overhead lines which pass within 40M of the existing property. These lines are fed from 2 transformers and there are fuses outside my property. One transformer is half a mile to the east and the other is a quarter of a mile to the west. I am told that I am on the end of the line and if one of the transformers fails then power is feed from the other transformer.Western Power is quoting in excess of £54,000 to connect the 2 new houses to the grid. I have looked on the OFGEN web-site and they indicate that there is a “25% RULE&quot;and my interpretation of this rule is that if the extra 2 properties being built draw more that 25% of the power running down the existing overhead lines then it is for me to pay the upgrading fee for the overhead cable, but if the 2 new properties take less then 25% of the load flowing down the overhead lines, then Western Power is responsible for the cost of upgrading the overhead cables. Does anyone know whether my interpretation is correct?I live in a rural village area which has about 2000 homes and the current house is in a road with about 100 other properties, so I cannot envisage the 2 new properties taking more than 25% of the load carried by the existing overhead cables. If my interpretation is correct and Western Power is responsible for upgrading the lines, how can I find the total load carried by the existing lines, so that I can challenge Western Power?I have challenged Western Power with regard to the loading and the fact that the 2 new properties will not be taking more that 25% of the load currently flowing down the existing cables. They say that they are concerned not about the load, but ‘impedance’ and the neighbours lights dimming when appliances in the new houses are switched on, such as electric showers. Can anyone help me with this bureaucratic problem that I am facing?Also does anyone know of a company, or consultant, who can fight my corner with Western Power on this issue?Regards, any info will be useful.  more

Resolved Question: Is this&quot;Entrapment&quot;?
Full story is this... A few years ago, I accepted a job placing directional signs [as a&quot;sub-contractor&quot;] for home developers. I had no idea and was never told it was ILLEGAL to do this in the town I worked in. After a couple years, I started to notice many signs disappearing. I talked with my boss and he suggested I talk to the building administrator of the city. I gave the guy a call and he proceeded to chew me a new one. At that point, we had an argument in which I talked about his&quot;codes&quot;being unconstitutional [which must have really offended him] and that basically he was&quot;legally&quot;stealing signs that were not his property. Furthermore, if he needed evidence for any reason, a few easy photographs could have sufficed. The conversation ended with him hanging up on me after threatening&quot;to have me arrested&quot;if I went there to ask for the signs.  Fast forward about 4 or 5 months... This time, about 75% of the signs had been taken. I collected the rest of the signs I could and went home. When I arrived at home I called the building administrator&apos;s office. Just as I had begun before, I was very polite, I asked if they had the signs and if it was ok to pick them up. They told me to hold and when they came back on the line, the receptionist said,&quot;He said go ahead and come over.&quot;I drove to the building went inside the lobby to check-in with the receptionist there. She gave me the go ahead and told me where to pull my truck around. When I walked up to the gate, the building administrator met me between the door and myself with a threatening posture. He began to scream at me like I was a little kid who just lit a bag of dog poop on fire at his doorstep (24 years old at the time). Trying to get a single word, in I finally just yelled at him basically asking; why the hell he said it was ok for me to be there, when it was very obvious that it wasn&apos;t&quot;ok&quot;. In the middle of my statement, a woman cop showed up and proceeded to write me a ticket for disturbing the peace. She said that she had been called by the building administrator, and that it didn&apos;t matter if they told me;&quot;I could come up there&quot;or even that they told me where to park my truck AND WHAT GATE TO OPEN! So I was wondering if this qualifies as&quot;entrapment&quot;or if it&apos;s a story anyone wants to know more about. I was hoping to sue the offending city and possibly the company that sub-contracted me.  Let me further add: The city was originally seeking around 20,000 (I was a student at the time). They cited 80 or 100 dollars for each sign that they found, and two other very bogus charges. (operating a business out of your home in the city w/o a license and storage of&quot;items&quot;in the front part of the home.) Both of these were scoffed at by the judge, he just dismissed them as ridiculous, mainly because they had never issued any kind of warnings. He also absolved me of the bulk of the cost by not penalizing me for each individual sign. I spent an entire year going to court over this, and about $550 in fines. Keep in mind, I had that $20,000 hanging over my head the entire time... They tried to fine the builders and the sign placing company $20,000 as well, but I have no idea whatever happened to that.  more 


Resolved Question: How do I answer parents who want me to live with them in a senior apartment complex?
We are selling the family home. It is a two family with me living on one side of the house and my mother and stepfather living on the other side of the house. I left my full time job a few years ago due to stress. Now I work on call in sales in a department store. I am interested in working there full time but I have been discouraged by the recession to ask a manager about stepping up my work situation to permanent at the store. I continue to go on job interviews for jobs that are posted on Career Builder and on line job services. I have worked temp jobs but after a day or a couple of months the assignment ends with me being let go for one reason or another.Last year the snow was really bad in my area so I finally convinced my parents to sell the house. But within a month of putting the house on the market, we have a sale pending and are expected to move out in the middle of October.I have gone to a couple of real estate agencies looking at apartments. But I haven&apos;t submitted a single application because I am afraid that my application will not be accepted because I am not working full time. I have only made about four thousand dollars this year at the store. The rest of my income consists of taking money out of my IRA and supplementing my income with unemployment payments. My health insurance is covered by the state. Yesterday, I was looking at apartments with my parents. I found one that is about a thousand a month. I am currently paying my mother a reduced rent of two hundred a month. But living in the duplex, I carry all the expenses of one side of the house from the cable bill to oil heat, and there is no family discount on my utilities. I have been hustling for work over the past few years since I left my full time job. I work in the store. I substitute teach. I work temp jobs. Sometimes I am working as much as 60 hours a week. Then the next week there is no work. And the week after that, I might only get to work one full day. I have gotten into an argument with my mother. She asked one of the agents that works on site at the apartment complex for senior citizens. Persons must be 58 years of age or older to rent there. I am 49 years old. She asked the agent if she can have visitors stay the night. The agent didn&apos;t seem to have a problem with that. However, my mother failed to give further details that she intends to have me live there until I can find a full time job and move out to my own apartment. In a sense, she is trying to treat her new senior citizens apartment as if it&apos;s still her private home where she can make and adjust the rules. I have a couple of ideas.I want to see if my stepfather, who is retired, can co-sign my lease.I want to see if any of the landlords, particularly for apartments in owner occupied private homes, would be willing to take me as I am given my current economic status. It&apos;s not like I don&apos;t work at all. Last year, my income was $26,000 when I filed my income taxes. One third was from working at the store. One third was from unemployment. One third was from early withdrawals from my IRA. I still have about $30,000 left in my IRA. When I take the money out, I have the taxes withheld and I plan for the cost of the penalties. One of my aunts passed away and left my mother some money. She has given me about $5,000 of that money this year to help pay my expenses. I believe that through my work, and from other sources, I can pay for my own apartment. It&apos;s just trying to express that on a standardized rental application. I have some debt on several credit cards but nothing is past due and I make the payments every month. My credit score from Equifax is excellent. What do I say to my mother when she offers to have me live with her at the senior citizens apartment? I wanted to check with the agents at the building myself, but she is acting like I am being a squealer, which leads me to believe she is trying to convince me to live there on the sly.Many of the residents there are very nosey. One of the neighbors asked her&quot;Have you sold your house yet?&quot;I can only imagine what it will be like when my parents move in, and I move in with them. She already asked me about transferring ownership of my car to her so that I can park my car there and it will be in her name and not mine.  more 


Resolved Question: How do you get rid of a skunk infestation without hurting them?
I am against hurting animals that are not used as food, but I live in a sub-division with a bunch of families and children. Here recently, a group of builders/construstion workers have moved into an empty field across from my neighborhood and started building new homes...now my neighborhood is infested with skunks! They rome around late at night when my boyfriend and many others get home from work. We are afraid that they will get out of their vehicles and not see a skunk and get sprayed! We&apos;ve been trying to find ways to run them off, WITHOUT hurting them! We&apos;ve found a family living in an air conditioning unit next door to our house and for some reason they love our yard. I am terrified of them, and I want to get rid of them without hurting them. They would be a lot safer in the woods somewhere. I need some suggestions on what to do, to get rid of the skunks safely and get them relocated to a nice wooded area where they can live nice and happy and away from our neighborhood!

Resolved Question: How do I find out if my builder an developer committed fraud?
I am a disabled Veteran with a service dog. I bought my home in a specific community because they advertised an amenity for dogs to run and play (legal reasons I have to phrase it that way). After the first year in this new development I began to ask how long it would be to have this amenity built. I got a location from a member of the development team. I checked the site plan, there was no mention of this amenity of the site plan. I was furious. I was now almost 3 yrs behind in applying for my successor service dog because you have to have a place for the dog to exercise - this is a requirement for most reputable organizations that train service dogs. The county repeatedly told me they had never seen a plan including a dog park in my community. So I thought this was clearly fraud. 2 weeks before court, the county changes its story and says that there is an amenity but it&apos;s in a different location than what I was told. The location was next to the soccer field. Interestly enough the site plan clearly shows the soccer field but does not show the amenity for dogs. I then spoke with the utilities company that controlled the transmission lines. The rep told me that he had worked on this community from the beginning and had never heard of this amenity. He said that the developer would&apos;ve had to get permission to build anything through the tranamission lines. My attorney said we couldn&apos;t move forward and that I should settle. This was a couple years ago. I got word 2 days ago that the amenity had been built. I went to check it out. It is a fence around air on top of grass. There are no trees to shade the dogs, there are no benches for owners to sit at, there are no water bowls. There is simply a fence. I asked if they were going to install trees and was told they can&apos;t because of the overhead power lines. I think they lied, I think some county rep helped them lie. There&apos;s no way they would&apos;ve planned to build this amenity where dogs can exercise without trees for shade and without the ability to ever have trees planted. I believe they scrambled and did this because if it wasn&apos;t on the site plan it would&apos;ve clearly been deem fraud, so I think they did some underhanded revamping of the site plan and just stuck the fence up and said&apos;there you go.&apos;How can I find out if there was actually deception here?  more 


Resolved Question: Fescue grass is driving me crazy, wont bag, wont mulch?
I finally dug up the pathetic looking bermuda sod that my home builder installed when I bought my house a few years back and replaced it with fescue. The fescue came in lush and healthy just like I hoped but its a nightmare to mow. Its much thicker than the bermuda and it gums up my mower almost instantly. Im finding the blades don&apos;t ever dry out and they just clump together when cut. They don&apos;t fully discharge into the bag and eventually clog the bag opening solid. The mower stalls and cursing ensues. Ive tried using the mulching insert and bagging seems to be the lesser of two evils. Ive resorted to cutting at the heat of the day once a week to cut what I hope to be short dry grass and give myself the best chance to keep the mower from stalling, and FAIL. The mower usually stalls by the time the bag gets half full and there&apos;s usually a big pile of clippings left where the mower stalls. Ive messed with the deck heights- going over it twice starting with lifting the deck all the way up then dropping it back to the mid height setting. Doesnt help. I use new gas with Sta-Bil, change the oil every year, and check/replace filters. I kept the bermuda in the front yard and it cuts just fine like it always has. Does anyone have a tip or a trick that makes cutting fescue easier or will I eventually have the bite the bullet and get a big&apos;ol riding mower that can power through it?  more 


Resolved Question: How much are new construction eco-friendly houses?
My husband and I are looking to purchase a home in about five years or so. Next year we&apos;ll both be working full-time, as he is finished his graduate classes, and earning almost $100k per year. We live in the D.C. area and we are thinking about doing a new construction home that is eco-friendly if it is affordable. Otherwise, we&apos;ll just buy an older home and update it as much as possible within our budget.We&apos;re trying to figure out how much we should start saving next year in order to purchase such a house. We can&apos;t find any price estimates online for green-home builders like SEED, etc. Right now, we are just breaking even as this is a really expensive area to live in (and we&apos;re not even downtown). Does anyone know what we could expect a house to cost? We&apos;d obviously be getting a mortgage, but we want to know how much we&apos;d need to save up for down payment to be able to afford the mortgage.This is the kind of house we&apos;re looking at:New construction1500-2500 sq. feetSolar panelingBuilt with recycled/reclaimed materials&amp;lumberSolar water heatingRain Water CollectionEnergy Efficient Design&amp;AppliancesAnyone? I know that new home construction in the outer reaches of the D.C. area can be around $400-800 depending how close you are to D.C.

Resolved Question: Tenant eviction - nice offer to move rejected, greedy nature rears its head?
The situation I&apos;m in is as follows:There is a two family home located in Brooklyn, NY. I&apos;ve been offered over a million dollars for the property by a builder who wants to tear down the structure and build two homes on the lot. This was an unsolicited offer through a real estate broker, but the house was going on the market anyway.One of the apartments is vacant, the other occupied. The tenant has lived there for some 8 years and has never had a lease (they pay $1500/mo for a two floor, 2000 sq ft apartment and two parking spots in a neighborhood where parking is at a premium - so they&apos;ve had it made). I informed the tenant that I was made an offer that I intend to accept back in late April. I&apos;ve always liked the tenant and felt bad about the sudden development that they&apos;d have to leave. My offer to the tenant was that they can stay in the home for two months rent free and that the real estate broker would help them find a new place for free (no fees). Subsequently, the builder offered $7000 cash in addition to my two months of no rent for a package of $10,000 if the tenant would move out by the end of June. When pressed for an answer the tenant hemmed and hawed then finally asked for $20,000 to move out; and they stated that they&apos;d move out immediately if they were paid. So much to my disappointment the tenant is simply trying to squeeze all involved for a pay day.Since the tenant has made it clear that the builder&apos;s, broker&apos;s, and my package offer will not be accepted the offer is being pulled off the table. So, the legal process will start to have them evicted. This is a time sensitive thing because the builder is not going to wait around until November/December to buy the property. He wants to start working on the foundations in August if at all possible. And the building MUST be vacant or we won&apos;t go to closing. I stand to lose this deal due to the tenant&apos;s refusal to leave. If I had to sell the house as is I may get $900-$925K for it. So I stand to lose out significantly.My main questions are -1) Can I get back the May and June rent I offered as my good faith gesture to help them move? (I know, I know. I was foolish to do that in the first place.) The tenant always pays cash and there are never any receipts given.2) Assuming we go to court would the typical judge view our $10K package and 2+ month timeframe adequate enough to order a 30 or 60 day eviction? The tenant owns a business, can afford most any rent, etc. So there are no extenuating circumstances I&apos;m aware of.3) Lastly but importantly, since there is no lease involved can I revoke their use of the parking spaces immediately? Or will this be viewed as some sort of harassment on my part? I know that the loss of this privilege will seriously affect their decision to stay.Thanks.  more

There are 4 parties involved (5 including the builder)My wife and I are purchasing a new construction home with her brother to fund the purchase. Through out our discussions with the Realtor she knew that he had not decided exactly how he was going to fund the home (i.e. cash, 50%cash/50% loan, 100% Loan). This was all discussed on day 1 and everyone understood that he would need to be on the contract since he was the lender and would have a lean on the home until we decided to refi. By day 5 we had viewed many homes and decided on the home we were happy with. At the time we decided we liked the home we inquired with our Realtor if we could have them install the upgrades for the bathroom even though that portion of the home was completed. She responded and said that you can not do that on a new construction, and that was something we could do later. Right after we put her on the phone with the Brother and he said that he is good with the house as long as we liked it. He told her and her broker that it would be 3 days until he returned home and could make a decision regarding the funding. On day 6 she asked if we would like to meet and start the contract even though it could not be finalized until we had proof of funds for the home. Since we are very busy we were okay with that. When we sat down to sign and read through the contract, I noticed that she had listed an FHA loan at 6% as our funding source. When I questioned this, she stated that she just used that for now and would change it when she knew the source of the funds while reiterating that it could not be finalized without proof of the funds. After we signed I also wrote a check for the ernest money to the builder. When my brother-in-law (the funder) contacted the realtor she told him that the contract was already finalized. When he asked why she said that we had to had the proof of funds before it would be final, she became upset with up. He had also asked the builder about the bathroom upgrades and they stated that it could be done for 2K. When he questioned her on that issue and why she did not work for that in the contract, she became more upset and stated&quot;I guess you need to find a better Realtor!&quot;At that point he told her that was fine and she was no longer needed. My concern was to ensure the builder that we still want the home. The earnest money was paid to the builder anyway. We just needed a new contract with a different realtor. Can I cancel the current contract? I does have incorrect funding listed, and she lied and said it would not be final until proof of funds where shown. We are also upset that after statements from the builder that the upgraded bath could have been included in the contract when the realtor stated it was not an option.I know that was a lot but I appreciate any advice I can get at this point.  more
