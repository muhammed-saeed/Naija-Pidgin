 Open Question: My dad eats Taco Bell EVERY day. How do I convince him to stop? 
 (Please read all! (: )

So my dad eats taco bell every day.. a cheesy gordita crunch, to be exact. Sometimes he&apos;ll also have a quesadilla. My mom and I have had enough of this eating behavior, and we have tried so many things to get him to stop! I have pleaded, screamed, etc etc! We found other places for him to try but he refuses! I brought him to Panera Bread and he tried ONE thing there, but apparently he doesn&apos;t &quot;like sliced bread&quot;.. He is acting like a little kid and going against all things he has ever told me!
My dad is extremely athletic, but a little overweight.. He is trying to lose weight. He plays tennis, softball, and volleyball about 4 times a week for more than an hour each time. For losing weight, he is good in the athletic department, but he really needs to eat healthily!
I have looked up nutritional facts, and - to my surprise and disappointment - his cheesy gordita crunch is low in everything.. For what he lacks in nutrients, he takes a vitamin supplement. Nonetheless, he needs some vary in his diet! He is a vet and strongly opposes to the belief one needs to vary their diets... I&apos;m DONE with this - HELP ME.. please! How do I convince him to stop!?Sorry! *veterinarianWell, the cheesy gordita crunch is cheap, has few calories, and is low in sodium and cholesterol and everything!! He just laughs at me when I show him other things, and he says &quot;I&apos;m arguing for him.&quot;I&apos;m not going to get off his back.. I want him to be healthy AND happy! He says he is both - and yes, the doctor did tell him he is healthy - but he could be healthier.I tell him to eat it in moderation.. I don&apos;t care if he doesn&apos;t stop completely, just so long as he goes to other places every few days.. And yet he still refuses. 
 
 Open Question: Difference between the Samsung Galaxy S3 and galaxy s2 HD LTE? 
 Ive compared the specs of the two on Bell.ca and I really don&apos;t see much difference between the two. Same cpu, RAM, camera etc. Can someone please explain the main differences between the two are?

Thanks. 
 
 Open Question: Tips on cleaning a really, really, REALLY gross car? 
 So, I&apos;m really lucky in that my first car was given to me for free. It&apos;s my dad&apos;s old car (he just got a new one) and I&apos;m grateful that I didn&apos;t have to pay anything for it. In case you wanna know, it&apos;s a 2001 Hyundai Elantra, and it&apos;s a funky goldish color. The upholstery is tan with teal specks (weird, but whatever, haha).

However, the guy kept the car in incredibly crappy condition, so it reeks. Literally. Would you like to hear all about the nastyness in excruciating detail? Here goes.

-It smells like a combination of sweat, coffee, and a Rockstar energy drink he spilled like 3 years ago (and never cleaned up)
-There are coffee stains on the floor mats and upholstery. 
-There are little Tinker Bell stickers on the windows. Most of them are faded and peeling and sticky and gross.
-Because the automatic unlocker clicker remote thing died a loooong time ago, you have to use a key to unlock the car, which is no big deal. But my dad wound up putting the key in the drivers side to unlock it... and the key broke off. It&apos;s still stuck in the lock. You have to open the car from the passengers&apos; side. Ughhhh.
-He got in an accident once, so the hood was pretty banged up. We got it fixed, but it still sticks up a little on one side.
-My mom and I were cleaning the crap out of the car and found a Jack in the Box bag of chicken nuggets, complete with receipt from 2004. Yayyy.
-It&apos;s a stick, but the knob on top of the gear-shifter-whatever-it&apos;s-called broke off.
-It looks like someone took a bite out of the steering wheel. 
-Possibly the grossest part: You know that part of a sedan above the back seat? Sorta like a dashboard, but in the back? Right in front of the rear window? Sometimes people put little cutesy stuffed animals or whatever there? ...There are at least 20 dead bees stuck in the corner between the surface of that and the window. They have been bleached by the sun.
-The A/C doesn&apos;t work. No big deal though, it has a working sunroof.
-The clock is like, possessed by some clocky ghost. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t. It doesn&apos;t matter how often you reset the clock to the right time, it&apos;ll change. Or just shut off altogether. 
-It squeaks. It&apos;s not the brakes. I have no idea what&apos;s going on. 
-On the bright side, the engine is fantastic.

So. I feel like I&apos;m picking up diseases just being near this beast. I love my dad and all, and am so happy my parents are giving me a car, but the guy had no idea how to take care of it. Haha. What can I do/buy to make this car not as superduper nasty? I&apos;m only a teenager, so financially-friendly options would be most appreciated (: 
 
 Open Question: &quot;Yahoo hacked, 450,000 passwords posted online&quot;. CNN? 
 If this is not the clearest indication as to the yahoo-doodle-doo idiots here on Yahoo, I suggest you sit back and watch the lawsuits. Well done, you idiot pen-pushers. Sorry, nearly forgot:

I post, you read, point made. Whether those pen-pushing Yahoo &apos;administrators&apos; then Delete because of their warped view of journalism, is quite irrelevant. Ring a bell?? I posted this yesterday and it lasted the time it takes, i think, to put down the crossword the &apos;administrator&apos; was surely sweating over, and Delete. No matter though, it proves it was read. Modern &apos;social&apos; games as the one purported to be, by yahoo-doodle-doo, would have filters BEFORE something is posted. The yahoo way is, of course, too lazy to be anything so creative, so they need some &quot;Sloppy-Joe&quot; to be around to do the censoring. Ever wonder why real Social distraction like Facebook ever take off?

Some participant managed to write in before the censors tripped over themselves to Delete: &apos;It&apos; asked something like: &quot;Thanks for the rant. Where&apos;s the Question?&quot; Must&apos;ve been either a UK early bird (meaning an all night job-pusher, or some yank way back in time and place who couldn&apos;t get a life style for the evening). Yep, it is a Rant about censorship and if you couldn&apos;t see the question mark, you need glasses, Mr/Mrs Troll. Ever see &apos;a question&apos; on yahoo, as such, or was it just because you didn&apos;t like the way I phrased it? Because, there&apos;s is not one swear word - just a context which the pen-pushers don&apos;t like.

Quite honestly, I don&apos;t give a rats behind if they like my opinions or not - a &apos;social&apos; network like this, is really nothing at all if you look at its competitors, but it&apos;s a refreshing reminder that junk still exists on the wide, wild, web.

(ps: give &apos;n take, this&apos;ll last a coupla hours, so read while fresh - although, guaranteed, it&apos;ll be back on post within a few moments).

 Open Question: Dose this show ring a bell to anyone? 
 I used to watch this show as a kid about several different scenarios about unbelievable events and you had to guess weather or not they were true. I remember in one case a little boy died and when his family gave him one of his favorite toys he came back to life. And in another instance some people were having a family reunion and were serving hamburgers. But the grill shot up flames and burnt all of the hamburgers for no explainable reason and it turns out that eating the meat in one of those hamburgers would have made someone really sick, possibly could have killed them. They said it was the uncle or grandpa or something who had died a little bit before who did it. I think they said both of those cases were true. Anyone got any ideas on this show? 
 
 Open Question: Poll: what sound does your door bell make? 
 mines is a extremly loud RING! that usually causes people to jump out of there seats. but were used to it so it&apos;s funny when it rings and people freak out. 
 
 Open Question: Am I even at least a bit pretty? (Pictures included and description)? 
 I came back from school not too long ago and I&apos;m super depressed once again because I don&apos;t think the guy I like notices me however he has spoke to me quite a few times before. I&apos;m kind of new to this school and it&apos;s like everyone looks at me. We wear a uniform and everyone makes theirs look cool whereas mine is just plain. They&apos;re blonde or have light brown hair and wear make up that makes them look gorgeous whereas I just feel left out and get treated differently because I&apos;m not pretty like them and because of this I always remain quiet and shy and keep to myself.

There&apos;s also a guy in my year/grade but who&apos;s not in my class but once he accidently whacked me with something and ever since then whenever he sees me he always feels the need to make his presence known. One time a few weeks ago at break time I was near him and he decides to do a weird sign with his fingers to me and I didn&apos;t do anything. He turned around and started to muck about with one of his friends and I said &quot;tooo annoying.&quot; then he was like &quot;what?&quot; and I said &quot;nothing&quot; then he said what again so I also repeated myself. A popular girl said to him &quot;don&apos;t bully her&quot; in a joking way he didn&apos;t get mad or anything he just did 2 thumbs up to me with both of his hands. Then the bell rang for class and I walked past him but he was going my direction and he was looking at me when he was turning to a different direction. It was just a plain look. No love, no hate, no like, maybe curiosity? I&apos;m not sure. But 2 days ago I was outside a classroom waiting for it to start and he walks down the corridor but before he went past he put his hands near my face like he wanted them on my face but they didn&apos;t touch my face then he moves them away but before his hands completely were away from me I pushed his hand/arm away so he could go away quicker. He continued to walk after that however he had his eyes on me all times before he was out of my sight. With the same look. It was so plain and I can&apos;t work it out. He&apos;s really popular and a very cute looking person and I saw him also once put a girl up against the wall in front of me and he was saying something like &quot;Don&apos;t be aggressive.&quot; jokingly. The girl was blonde, popular, just one of those gorgeous girls who aren&apos;t shy. I was jealous. I don&apos;t know what to make of him.

I don&apos;t even know what to say to the guy I like. I have nothing to say. But he does talk to me whenever he sees me, even if it&apos;s just a sentence. But not all the time.

I feel like I do not deserve to talk to these people because I&apos;m not pretty and I should just be moody and keep to myself to pass things quicker however I just feel depressed when I do that.

Anyway here&apos;s me. I have a lot of pictures but you don&apos;t have to look at them all :) the white stripe in some of the photos is hiding my school tie. I don&apos;t wear any make up since I think it makes me look even more hideous and I don&apos;t really know how to use it. Please don&apos;t think I&apos;m someone who&apos;s seeking attention and for people to tell me I&apos;m pretty. Also what ethnicity do I look like and how old do I look? I&apos;ll put the answers at the end of this :)

I&apos;m 15 years old (turn 16 next year) and my dad is half Indian and my mum is English.

Do you think light brown hair would suit me?

I didn&apos;t post this to get hate or anything like that I just have a few questions like the one above. I want someone to be honest with me and say something like &quot;A guy would be able to fall for you.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re not totally hideous.&quot; or if you&apos;re even thinking &quot;You&apos;re not that attractive, I can&apos;t imagine any boy at your school would fall for you.&quot; then you can even say that.

Thank you

 Open Question: does my principle have the right to...? 
 so not to long ago i got sent to the principles office with a group of friends because we didn&apos;t hear the bell and missed most of a class. none of us knew when we had to be in due to a change in the schedule a dn none of us had phones so we didn&apos;t know the time.

when we got to the principles office she made up all leave our bags in the hallway while she spoke to us in the meeting room. after wards when we were sitting outside the class waiting to be allowed in we al thought our bags were going to be searched because the principle was insinuating we were doing suspicious stuff. we don&apos;t know if they were but they didn&apos;t appear to be moved around.

basically does my principle have the right to make us leave our bags in the hallway whilst speaking to us? the bags were out of sight.
and does a staff member at my school have the right to make me remove my beanie? because i have been sent to the principles office for insinuating the teacher wanted me to get naked, even though i was clearly joking... but isn&apos;t a beanie considered an item of clothing and isn&apos;t it illegal for a teacher to make a student remove an item of clothing?


idk.so my school is allowed to search my property but not take anything? what the fuck? that&apos;s fucked up. if anyone wants to search my bag then they are going to have to pry it from my dead hands...jesus christ..
