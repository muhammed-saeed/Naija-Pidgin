I want to give this place stars, I really do! But every time I&apos;ve been there, the food has been good with authentic recipes. I tend to try their newer menu items, like their South american sloppy joe, which tasted amazing, but not enough sauce to turn the stale bun to mush. There&apos;s a reason why La Taqueria down the road is busy all the time!

Very clean, authentic, and a good deal for what you are getting... THIS IS NOT SUBWAY! Do not expect a $5 footlong! I also think this place would be amazing if I was fluent in Spanish.

I do like that you grab a paper bag and then mark what sandwich you want. And a full selection of Mexican soft drinks!

Definitely worth checking it out. At least once. Let&apos;s support authentic Mexican food as much as Vancouver can!

This place blew my damn mind. I like the bag system for ordering your sandwich and I also really like that they have a cornbread kind of thing (gluten-free?) option. It&apos;s not on the menu, but it&apos;s what I had in the restaurant, I&apos;m not sure if it may have been a special or not.

Listen, no matter what any of these dissatified people say, if you are in the market for a delicious sandwich of mind blowing quality, you are going to be spending about ten dollars.  In the ten dollar sandwich department, this is one of the contenders for number one. Seriously, it&apos;s delicious!

I find it rather ludicrous that this place is getting such crappy reviews, especially based on comparisons to Subway and the likes of authentic tortas cubanas. Firstly, how someone can compare Subway to places like this is beyond me. If you want to compare Subway sandwiches, try other fast food restaurants (ie. Tim Hortons). Secondly, I have tasted the legendary monster that is the torta cubana from &quot;That&apos;s It Market&quot; in San Francisco and expecting to find something like that in Vancouver let alone at the same value or cheaper is just silly. Mexican restaurants in Vancouver have come a (really really really really) long way and no one is happier than I am, but it still isn&apos;t anywhere near the quality and value you&apos;d get south of the border.

Enough of the rant and onto the food here: bit pricey but very delicious tortas. That is all.

*sigh* When will I learn my lesson not to get my hopes up when visiting Mexican places! I&apos;m sorry, maybe it&apos;s just me, maybe it&apos;s just my expectations but this place... which was not vile btw.... I just did not like.

My hubby and I both ordered a Cuban sandwich. If you&apos;ve had the original and know what I&apos;m talking about, you are expecting this juicy, meaty, just an oozing mess of yummyness. But is that what I got? Yeah, no.

We paid $25 for two sandwiches. TWO SANDWICHES! I mean really? I am so disappointed, it&apos;s not even about the money *sniff. I thought I was going get a mouthgasm but I surely did not. If it was the real thing though I would gladly hand you my cash, but it wasn&apos;t.

I mean it was good and all but it&apos;s not what I thought it would be. I really thought it was going to be this huge sandwich stuffed with slabs of meat but in reality it was just this thin ordinary &apos;wich. Which is saddening really because I built up my hunger walking uphill to this place.

I&apos;m so dramatic. Anyways, I know two stars may be a little harsh for some but I really did not like it and I will not go back :(

Grab your brown paper bag, and check off what you want!
Fun concept.

The Cuban/havana and El pubile (sp?) sandwiches are great!!!

Coleslaw is terrific too!  Price is fine, no issues with that.

Try the tamarind soda.

Good for a fast-food substitute! equally fast, easily 20X as good!

I have visited this place many times and it always makes me happy. The sandwiches are fresh and super tasty. Great value as well.

My favourite sandwich is the vegetarian. Seriously...

Minus one start because of the the extreme amount of waste for each customer. get some recycling and I will give you another star :)

Thought about giving it 4 stars for the prices but the sandwiches are just so damned delicious. 5 stars for Las Tortas!

Authentic or not, they are great. If you want somewhere casual and friendly with consistently great sandwiches this is the place.

Try the fresh chips&amp;horchata if it&apos;s available. Otherwise the hibiscus tea is great. I also find it worth the extra .50¢ for the chipotle.

I&apos;m kind of digging this place.

I discovered it by accident one day while walking down Cambie. I&apos;ve been back several times since then to grab a Sandwich for take out. While I can&apos;t speak to the authenticity of their &apos;Mexican Sandwiches&apos; I will HAPPILY attest to the deliciousness of said-sandwiches, authentic or not. The sandwiches are BIG, juicy&amp;served warm with lots of melty cheese, meat&amp;slaw. I have yet to order a meal-combo as the sandwich alone is more than enough to fill me up. If you&apos;re concerned about &apos;blandness&apos; ask them to make it spicy for you.

Sandwiches are about $9 on their own.... &apos;Meals&apos; (including Sandwich, soup or chips&amp;Agua Fresca) are $12-$13.

I love a place that takes a creative spin on a classic lunch item... Tortas does that amazingly well. With about 12 different &apos;Tortas&apos; to choose from, you&apos;re sure to find one that you love.

Oh- and they cater too! Yum!

Stopped here with the youngest, because I heard good things about the food. Almost didn&apos;t get as far as ordering because the service is, well, crap really.
Had my paper bag order taken by the man who was doing most of the cooking - a smile, or at least a please or thank-you wouldn&apos;t go amiss. Anyway, ordered the chicken with lime - tasty enough, but rather skimpy for the $. Given how many other places you could go to for lunch, with a better ambiance, wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to go here again.

*Disclaimer: I didn&apos;t physically go to the restaurant as my boyfriend went and got food for the both of us so I have no idea what the restaurant looks like, what the service is like, etc.

My boyfriend went to Las Tortas today upon a recommendation to get us lunch during our work breaks. He got the cordero al cilantro (lamb marinated and cooked in cilantro pesto) and he got me the milanesa de res (beef sirloin fillet hand-breaded in panko crumbs). They were both $8.75. Each sandwich comes with tomato, cabbage, pickled onions, jalapeños, guacamole, refried beans, butter, and mayo.

The sizes of the sandwiches are decent but could&apos;ve been bigger for the price (vs. somewhere like Subway). I really didn&apos;t like my sandwich, especially the pickled onions and the guac (which is unusual as I&apos;m usually guac&apos;s biggest fan) - my boyfriend commented that it tasted more like hummus. I also expected it to be hot (I don&apos;t know why - personal preference) which it wasn&apos;t and it kept falling apart from being so separated on the inside (if that makes any sense). The beef was tough and the bread was a bit stale as well. I ended up only eating half of it.

My boyfriend finished his lamb sandwich as well as the other half of my beef one - but then again he&apos;s one of those guys who eats everything. He also said that they were a bit on the pricey side for the quality and quantity.

I think that this review is mostly based on my personal taste as our friend who recommended this place to us loves it and my boyfriend finished his sandwich as well as half of mine. I don&apos;t think it helps that I&apos;m not especially fond of Mexican food either.

Pros: not sure - I didn&apos;t even go to the restaurant though so I wouldn&apos;t know but so far nothing about the sandwich
Cons: quality and quantity
Verdict: Looks like I won&apos;t be coming back any time soon.

If you&apos;re looking for a huge hot meaty sandwich to eat at lunch, check out Las Tortas. This cute, bright hole-in-the-wall is a mecca of meatwiches in the Cambie Village.

Yesterday, having hit the lunch rush, the tiny joint was packed. We waited in line but didn&apos;t mind because it gave us time to oggle the menu and check off our cravings on the order form. My normally indecisive self had plenty of time to choose my final answer before the checkout. Pretty good system if you ask me.

Having never had a tortas before I didn&apos;t know what to expect, but seeing all that shredded meat cooking on the grills had me convinced I was in the right place. A t$10 the sandwich seemed steep for a mom m&apos; pop lunch but holy smokes, was that sammy huge! I ate the first hot, piping layered half (I don&apos;t usually eat bread but this was worth it) and saved the other half for later. That evening, my leftover Cubana-wich was a taste of delicious freaking paradise!

Good grab n&apos; go food. Bring a friend and swap your other half-o-wich!

Ridiculously delicious - even my three year old will attest to that. I Have been here probably ten times and never been unsatisfied, even though, as is the case everywhere these days - the price could be a little lower. But I suppose that may happen the more people find out about this little gem.
Especially like their use of paper wrap and bags to go. The only plastic they use here is for the drinks. They should try and get some glasses when eating in to reduce their impact. Otherwise a nice green option.

I really love the authentic flavors in the sandwiches in Las Tortas. I&apos;ve eaten there a few times and never once been disappointed by the the quality and taste. The prices are a little high yes, but when you consider how filling they are and how lengthy some of the prep must be (pickled onions, slow roasted meats) it&apos;s really not that bad. I think people get a little too hung up on the cost - when I think about how much a foot long costs at Subway it&apos;s really not that much more to have a much more excellent sandwich experience.

I highly recommend it if you want to try something new in Mexican food!

Okay you Mexican food hounds. This is it!

Las Tortas has finally opened in Cambie Village, offering 14 different kinds of Tortas!
Mexican Tortas, made by authentic Mexicanos. YES.
Full of flavour and all the calories good Mexican food should have.
What is a Torta? It&apos;s like a &quot;Sloppy Joe&quot; or stew in a Sandwich. I mean gobs of meat or vegg and sauce and cheese and flavour in a large bun. No, not those chintzy things masquerading as Tortas elsewhere, this is the real thing.
SO, Vancouver, get your butts over there and check it out for yourself.
Are you drooling yet?

Stopped in here for some grub tonight, I was a little concerned when I walked in and there was no one in there but it seemed to pick up while I was waiting. I am a fan of the funky pictures they have hung around the walls throughout the restaurant although i was disappointed that the &quot;menu&quot; is no longer a paper bag, it is now a piece of paper that gets stapled to a paper bag. That just isn&apos;t nearly as fun.

I took a quick glance at the menu but in my half asleep stupor I decided to order the Vegetarian so I didn&apos;t mistakenly end up with a meat filled sandwich.

I waited about 5 minutes for my food but I get the feeling it was partially because the terd behind me had to ask 30 questions about everything, and then walk away and go back to try and tell the cook exactly how to cook his food...screw off buddy first I get fed, THEN you get fed.

I dragged my half pound sandwich home and although it coulda had more for flavour but it was still pretty darn good, I loooove cabbage, pickles and zucchini so I was pretty happy in the end!

Next time I hit up Las Tortas I am going to have to try these house made potato chips I have read such good things about!

Ok. After been 4 years out of my country &quot; Mexico&quot; I was expecting something not so similar becuase It is hard to get the same taste if you are not in Mexico. However I was surprise. The taste was very close to the real Mexican Torta.

I had the Cubana version, all the ingredients came together very nice and the bun was actually very nice. Don&apos;t forget that &quot;Tortas&quot; in Mexico are cheap, cheap cheap and very popular.

The Aguas frescas are good however the glass is to small. Probably the downside is that they are expensive , more when you know the prices in mexico. Generally the prices in Van are high but paying for a torta $10 cad  is way too much.

The place decoration is nice, very simple with some frames of the famous and Popular movies from the &quot; cine de oro&quot; Golden cinema, in Mexico.

The service was ok, fairly quick and the bag came with napkins and a wet towel something unusual for this kind of food. Problably they can ged rid of it and reduce the price of the product.

In general I&apos;m happy with the food and I recommend the place. My review of course is just based in 1 style &quot; the Cuban&quot; I will try a different one next time.

cheers

Mexican fiesta on Cambie! Or so I thought.... I was pretty stoked to try something new, and I don&apos;t know if it has been my subconscious telling me that Cinco de Mayo is coming, but I have had a real boner for Mexican food lately, so I dragged the BF here in the pissing rain to get me some sexy-mexi.

As I came in, I fell in love with the Mexican pop culture paintings on the walls, so I snuck in some photos since the cashier was busy on the phone, and the food prep girl was standing next to her eating a sandwich?? wtf??? Sure she put some gloves on before throwing together my torta, but it&apos;s kinda weird when the girl who is making your food is standing at the register chowing down. At least you know if the staff are eating there, the food is safe right? Yikes.

I ordered the vegetariana tortie and a brownie, cuz I had a craving for something sweet, and the giant zit on my forehead today is the proof that makes me feel pretty guilty about indulging. Anyways, I handed the cashier my bag with the appropriate items ticked off, and I had barely sat down when my name was called. I figured since the tortie had jalapenos on it, that it would have a bit of a kick to it, but it was kind of bland. I was wondering where the heat was in this Mexican joint? Where the heck was Frank&apos;s Red Hot... I put that shit on everything!  It also felt like I had more bun than veggies, and as much as I like big buns, and I cannot lie... I really felt like I was eating filler.

The brownie was okay, it was the perfect amount of sweet, and had added spice to it, which complimented the dark chocolate. I guess I was hoping for a brownie that was a bit more homemade though and not a pre-cut-previously frozen one.

Las Tortas was not everything I was hoping it would be, but it&apos;s also not the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth....um... yea.....
Anyways, I might be back, if I get really bored and my fridge breaks. (2.5 stars, which I generously rounded up to 3 because I like the art.)

I had heard plenty of good things about Las Tortas so now that my world has been drastically reduced to the radius I can travel before my little one decides he&apos;s done with field trips...my mother in law and I decided to walk to Cambie and try them out!

It took me a second to notice the bags on the side we had to use to place our order and it would have been nice if the girl behind the counter had noticed and tipped us off (there was no one in line except for us!).

I was a little put off by the price for a place that is definitely a simple fast food restaurant, especially for the vegetarian sandwiches. True, it is hard to get any sandwich in Vancouver for less than $7.50 but at $9-$10 a hit, this had better be a phenomenal sandwich...and it was good...but not amazing. I had the mushroom and cheese and my mother in law had the vegetarian (which I tried via her leftovers the next day...which actually baked up well!). I liked my sandwich and she liked hers but would have loved a bit more filling, especially since the bread is so fluffy and voluminous.

The meat options looked interesting so I will have to use my husband as the carnivorous guinea pig and see if they are any more exciting than the veggie options.

We also had the lime agua fresca which was a tad sweet and could have used loads more ice...especially since on a 30 degree day, the restaurant was super hot and stuffy.

All in all, a tasty and unique diversion and I will probably be back...but only when my usual craving for  Tofu Swimming Rama from next door subsides.

I read about this place online and thought it sounded pretty good, so I checked it out a couple weeks ago on a Sunday. I ordered the slow roasted pulled pork &quot;marinated in Mexican spices&quot; which sounded delicious. The size of the sandwich was ok, there could have been a bit more meat, and in general the sandwich was ok. The reason I only give the place 2 stars however, is because I paid nearly $10 for my sandwich! I can get TWO Vietnamese subs in Chinatown which are in my opinion much more flavourful and for almost half the price. Either that or a yummy bowl of ramen at Menya just down the street.

If you want to pay way too much money for a mediocre sandwich, then this is the place for you!

Came back on another late weekend afternoon, this time I had the special-the Hawaiiana, with chips&amp;salsa, and acgua.

The honeydew acgua was yummy, very refreshing, perfect on a hot afternoon. I wish they would strain it or something, so that the drink is smoother.

My tortas was good, ham, cheese, and a large slice of pineapple, with all the fixins inside a fresh bun. The chips were good in that they were homemade, and crispy. The salsa seemed a bit watered down though. It needed a little more flavour to it.

Second attempt at Las Tortas, this time, I saw by the window. This is a great place for people watching, while savouring my tortas, and honeydew acgua.

Gourmet Mexican sandwiches is their tagline.  Probably the first torta specialty store in Vancouver, I was really excited when I first saw the store opening.

Ordered a slow roasted, marinated roast beef torta with Oaxaca cheese torta.  The bun was nicely toasted, the beef was stringy and almost inedible and the cheese was undetectable.  For $9.77 incl tax, I will not be returning.  A solid meh.

I don&apos;t really understand their rationale for using paper bags as their menus.  It wasn&apos;t necessary unless you were ordering takeout, the tortas come wrapped in tinfoil anyways.

I tried Las Tortas a while ago, but realised I never spent my two cents on it, so here&apos;s the change, with tax.

The restaurant itself is small and cozy and I personally enjoy the movie poster inspired decor (and the posters themselves), but that&apos;s not what makes a great restaurant great - the food is the final factor and when I say I got stuffed on a sandwich (that&apos;s apparently what a Torta is - forgive my Spanish, I truly suck at it!) I kid you not. The filling was generous but not gross and the pulled pork was flavorful if not a zinger, but for a sandwich it was better than most.

The sides were the usual (somehow it&apos;s become swish to serve kettle chips with anything) and so not worth spending more than a mention on.

Las Tortas has a lot of charm, a great staff (really eager for us to try their flavoured drinks - it may have been Horchata, but I forget) and a novel way of ordering your food (tick the boxes on the take out bags - funky). If you&apos;re in the area it&apos;s a great little spot in the village to enjoy a slightly different meal before a movie or perhaps hitting a bar.

Tortas.  Interesting concept. Menu is on a paper bag. Tick off your
selection, print your name. pay. Tortas wrapped in waxed butcher paper. A classy touch. Napkins and a large wet towlette. Thoughtful.
I had the slow roasted pork thigh.
Sandwiches come with fixins of tomato,cabbage,pickled onions,
guacamole,refried beans,butter&amp;mayo. Bun crusty..OK..Hint
of heat.Refried beans a nice texture. Pork was dry.  Not great...not quite good either.  Passable...
Price point in the raise eyebrow, half way.  $8.50.  At that elevated
plateau the munchies have to be approaching great...Good is not good enough.   Memphis Blues , similar price., much better sandwich. Au Petit Cafe Banh Mi at almost half Las Tortas price wins hands down for satisfying bun and fillings.  Not to mention the now long gone Dunkin Donuts on Main&amp;33rd had Tortas for many years in the $4 price range which were keepers....

If the pretty waxed butcher paper adds to the cost. Lose it. The wet towlette is not neccessary as the sandwich, mine at least, had absolutely no gloop, drip, slurp factor.

If you grew up with burgers from the Spot.  Warm, carmelized buns and triple o.    Westcoast tastebuds demand the comfort of these
two elements in their  buns and sandwiches.

This is a food town.   High end..low end..and inbetween.. much competition for your buck and your stomach.

When you play in this $ territory, you got to be good from the git go.

Cute idea and if they really did want to feed people good food it probably would be a booming place -- but at 6:30 pm on a weeknight, when other local joints are overflowing, this place was empty... and I think I know why...

My first clue was there were 5 people hanging out in the kitchen, but the two latino staff were the only ones actually working. They have a method that they don&apos;t detract from -- you must write your order on a bag and hand it to the girl at the counter. They have a list of &quot;specials&quot; on a different wall featuring the tortas (sandwiches) with a drink and homemade potato chips for a $1 more than the cost of the sandwich a la carte. I ordered a sandwich and the girl asked me if I wanted it with a drink and chips. I said no. But I hadn&apos;t seen the specials on the wall -- I was reading the bag.

So after I&apos;d placed my order, I asked if there was a &quot;special&quot; price if I don&apos;t have the chips and drink -- and the girl said no -- I would have to pay full price for the sandwich. That meant that I paid a $1 more than the special price and no chips or drink -- and no explanation or offer to improve the deal. My sandwich was over $10.

Anyway, it gets worse. I ordered pollo milenesa -- which is essentially a flattened chicken breast, breaded and fried on a grill. However, here they have prefab frozen version that they plunge into the vat of oil for 10 minutes until it&apos;s overcooked and soaked in oil. Bleh. And, on the honkin&apos; big (stale) bun, the shrunken, overcooked blob of oily chicken was almost unpalatable. And this, on a day where they had no other customers!

At torta shops and carts, all over Mexico, tortas milenesas (chicken, pork or beef) use fresh (okay, not frozen) meat that is hand-pounded until very thin, and breaded by hand (dipped in milk, then seasoned flour, then egg, then bread crumbs), and fried on a grill. Sometimes they&apos;re a little too liberal with the oil for my tastes -- but you&apos;ll never see a deep fryer!

Decent sandwich. The bun could be better and it could have a little more kick. The salsa wasn&apos;t doing it for me so I asked for hot sauce and they didn&apos;t have any. Lame.  Maybe that&apos;s a thing but they could have offered me some jalapenos or something.

One upside is they do make their own agua fresca instead of selling jarritos and other Mexican pop.  I had the tamarind and it was awesome.

If they just kick the sandwiches up a bit this place would be great, but until then I&apos;ll be walking down to Budgie&apos;s.

This is a great lunch stop if you&apos;re in the neighbourhood. I&apos;d go here more often if it was just a dollar or two cheaper. As it is, they are charging gourmet prices for a product that isn&apos;t. Yet this is still my favorite sandwich place in the neighbourhood.

If you&apos;re looking for traditional mexican food, don&apos;t expect to get tacos from Las Tortas. The name says it all: Tortas (Mexican subs). A little pricy for just subs but they are great tasting. Fast service and not always busy. Fresh ingredients and friendly people. They now deliver to certain areas and may be willing to get to your home if you&apos;re not far away from their restricted area. The Pastel Tres Leches is quite good but I&apos;ve had better.

I just moved to Vancouver, and this restaurant was located near by. After giving it numerous tries, I have been let down again and again. I found the staff to be very rude, and the taste is definitely not worth the price. Very bland. My boyfriend who is a vegetarian was not happy with his experiences there either. Which is too bad, because we both def love our Mexican Cuisine

I guess it didn&apos;t help that I had star grade tortas in Denver (Las Tortas). I ordered the meal, which comes with a sandwich, kettle chips with salsa, and the aguas frescas. The tortas need more meat, re-fried beans none of this bead paste sh.t, fresher tomatoes, and maybe a fried egg! The bread was edible, but not the crunchy savoury bread I had back in Denver. As for the salsa, it was lacking. For the 9.99 meal it&apos;s cheap and quick but far from the authentic tortas experience.

It&apos;s a good thing I didn&apos;t end up going by yesterday as they&apos;re closed Mondays.  I had a &quot;Mexican Club torta&quot; today which included jamon, pierna, chorizo&amp;Monterey Jack for $9.75.  On their menu it also says, &quot;All tortas are served HOT&amp;are prepared with tomato, cabbage, pickled onions,&amp;jalepenos, guacamole, refried beans, butter&amp;mayo.  However, there was no cheese at all to be found on my torta, nor any jalapenos.  The meat was hot, but all other fillings were ice cold.  I&apos;m thinking maybe they melt the cheese&amp;the sandwich is warmer, but ofcourse they didn&apos;t do that with mine today.  The guac was tasty - I mostly tasted lime&amp;cilantro.  The chorizo was nice&amp;spicy.  The sandwich in whole had a nice spicy bite to it.  I&apos;d probably leave off the pickled onions next time.  I didn&apos;t get much of a taste of the jamon (ham) or pierna (slow roasted pork thigh) as the chorizo overpowered the other meats.  Bread was ok, had a crunch to it but was soft inside.

You pick up a bag and write your name on it, tick off your order,&amp;tick whether it&apos;s for eat-in or take-out.  I&apos;ve attached a picture of the bag&amp;my torta.  It was very smokey in there today from the stove top.  Not a bad sandwich, though I thought it was a little expensive.  If you added a drink&amp;a side of chips, it would have been about $15.   Would be closer to $20 if you got the soup or salad added with a drink.  That&apos;s an expensive lunch for me!  I doubt I will return just because of the price.

They make home made potato chips too for $2 as a side.  Surprisingly there is no chips and salsa as a side, potato chips is it!  There is Tortilla soup&amp;a Mexican salad like I said for around $5 each.  They have Aguas Frescas which they say selections change daily.  They also have Tres Leches (milk sponge cake)&amp;a Mexican Brownie for dessert.

This place is great!

When you enter there is a small table on your left with menus, napkins, and newspaper. To order your food you grab a marker and cross off on the brown paper bag what you want. I got the vegetarian tortas and their famous chips. You bring the bag to the cash register and pay there. You find a seat and in less than 5 minutes your sandwich is there. The tortas is quiet large. Enough for 2 people. The chips come with salsa, and they are really really yummy! Eating the tortas is crazy messy. My dinner cost me $10.24. I will definitely be returning.

Great stop for a traditional Mexican Torta

If this is you;
- not looking for a fancy dining experience
- not looking for a huge variety of choices
- don&apos;t mind a cafeteria style ordering with limited seating
- want a simple sandwich
- like a blend of Mexican flavours
- are in the neighborhood of Cambie and 17th
then you should try Las Tortas.

When you walk in the door, you grab a menu, which incidentally is also the bag you will receive your meal in, and fill in your order. Go to their website at http://www.lastortas.ca/ and you can actually see the menu. You can get a combo which includes chips and a drink. Check your choice on the bag, pay, and within a few minutes your order will be ready.

Tortas are very traditional Mexican sandwiches and do include jalapenos, although I don&apos;t find them overpowering. If you are not a fan of hot peppers, be sure to ask them to leave the jalapeno off.

I never order the chips - don&apos;t much like chips. The Torta alone is generally sufficient for me and I have a pretty good apatite.

Consider this the Mexican version of Subway or Quiznos if you wish. That&apos;s what to expect. I think you&apos;ll find the meal good value for your money.

Good concept, decent service and extra points for a simple implementation. However, the food was not as fresh as desired and way too much garbage produced with all the wrappers and containers. My feeling is better Mexican Tortas sandwiches can be found in Vancouver, just wish I knew where. Try the agua fresca, always deliscious!

Had heard about this place from friends ...rave reviews...  Im not one for long reviews so here is my opinion.
Bread on the tortas was amazing. fresh as one could want. golden brown toasty on the outside.
Everyone in our party ordered different things and they all kind of looked the same.   Kind of like a mexican &quot;sloppy joes&quot;.   The veggies and stuff were stewed ....think pouring your fridge into a slow cooker and then  pouring it into a warm tasty bun.   The home made chips were soggy at the bottom of the pile...the service was unfriendly at a time when the place was empty (at 12:30pm on a weekday!)   I was famished when I went there ...dug in... chomp yum chomp yum... then chomp hmmm... chomp.hmm. chomp. ug... wtf am I going to try to finish this for.
Conclusion. If  you are really high on something not so legal and want a filling meal go there.....otherwise you will spend the rest of the day wondering why you had that last bite of bland mexican sloppy joes.   and like another poster said....no hot sauce? I ordered some with my chips and it was more like thousand island dressing.   thumbs down... but the bread is awesome?

History
 
 Established in 2009 

Moises and Sergio have been making and serving food in Vancouver for many years now. Las Tortas is the latest adventure in their culinary explorations.

They absorbed countless recipes and flavours of Mexico while growing up there, and decided that El Norte was calling.

Vancouver is now home, and their passion and customer service are legendary.
