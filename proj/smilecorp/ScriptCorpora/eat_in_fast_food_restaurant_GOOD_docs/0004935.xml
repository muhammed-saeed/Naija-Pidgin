 PEORIA— 
Amy Evans is one McDonald&apos;s customer who believes the timing is right for fast food restaurants to post calorie amounts on their menus.

&quot;I think they should,&quot;Evans of Hanna City said as she and her husband, Jeff, walked out of the Main Street McDonald&apos;s Wednesday.&quot;I think there are a lot of people out there who are worried about what they eat.&quot;

An Illinois House bill (HB5419), if endorsed by the General Assembly, would require national fast food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King and others with menu display boards to post calorie contents alongside food prices.

The proposed state law, sponsored by state Rep. Deborah Mell, D-Chicago, requires fast-food chains to include calorie amounts for all menu boards posted at counters and drive-throughs. If adopted, the law would be enforced by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

Some fast food chains already are planning to do so. Panera Bread recently announced it will voluntarily post calorie information at all of its restaurants. Yum! Brands Inc. - operators of KFC, Pizza Hut, Long John Silver&apos;s, A&amp;W All-American Food and Taco Bell - will begin a phase-in of placing calorie information on its menus this year.

Local lawmakers have mixed views about Mell&apos;s bill, which awaits a vote on the full House floor.

State Sen. Dave Koehler, D-Peoria, who also runs Peoria Bread Co. with his wife, said fast-food chains with consistent menus month after month have the ability to track calorie contents. However, he said if the plan eventually trickled to smaller businesses, it would be more problematic.

He said it can be costly for small businesses to purchase the software to count calories on specific foods. He said he hopes there can be a specific plan in place someday to offset those costs.

For now, Koehler said Mell&apos;s proposal would help in the ongoing efforts to address the nation&apos;s obesity problem.

&quot;Sometimes people are totally fooled,&quot;Koehler said.&quot;By getting a fish sandwich instead of a hamburger, they think they reduce the caloric intake. But that might not be true if it&apos;s deep fried; there are additional calories in that.&quot;

Not everyone agrees that now is the time to push for more calorie disclosure.

State Rep. Jehan Gordon, D-Peoria, said she believes in the merits of the plan but opposes anything that could potentially drive businesses elsewhere. She said the proposal should be handled on the federal level.

State Rep. Jehan Gordon, D-Peoria, said she believes in the merits of the plan but opposes anything that could potentially drive businesses elsewhere. She said the proposal should be handled on the federal level.

&quot;We could be put at a competitive disadvantage,&quot;Gordon said.&quot;Understanding the recession we are in, any piece of legislation we are working on that potentially kills jobs ... now is not the time.&quot;

Representatives at chain restaurants such as Hardee&apos;s believe the proposal is overly cumbersome.

Company spokeswoman Agatha Thaller, in an e-mailed response, said adding anything to&quot;an already crowded menu board&quot;would slow down service speeds because guests could get overwhelmed with information. She also said costs would increase for franchises because they would have to redo menu boards.

In addition, drive-through menus could be difficult to read, because adding nutritional information could&quot;result in incredibly tiny font type,&quot;she said.

At least one local fast food restaurant operator disapproves of the idea, even though the current proposal does not apply to mom-and-pop eateries.

&quot;Anything that gets into law usually gets expanded,&quot;said Mick Veloso, co-owner of Mr. G&apos;s Chicago Style Restaurant, 601 W. Main St.&quot;If it starts with the national chains, it would get to the locals.&quot;

Besides, Veloso said, people typically worried about calorie intake generally know how much is in the foods they eat.

&quot;If you go online and Google it, you can find (the information),&quot;Veloso said.&quot;I think the general public is a lot smarter than the government thinks.&quot;
