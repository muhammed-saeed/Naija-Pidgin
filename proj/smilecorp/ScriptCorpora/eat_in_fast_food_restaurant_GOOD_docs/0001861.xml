 RE: Wendy&apos;s Chili Thu, 03/3/05 3:33 AM ( permalink ) Chili&apos;s makes a reasonable generic chili, but that&apos;s a sit-down place. Just for a quick fix, as opposed to a Whopper or something, Wendy&apos;s chili is not bad.   #31

 RE: Wendy&apos;s Chili Thu, 03/3/05 3:53 AM ( permalink ) I always had the chili from Nation&apos;s hamburgers in CA. They had great burgers but that chili was divine. Wendy&apos;s suits me for a quick cheap chili fix...a large with cheese and onions...late night when you get about three burgers worth of meat, as they are reaching the bottom of the pot   #32

A long time ago, while working my way through college, I worked for Wendy&apos;s

During the day, in order to both have burgers ready at all time and make them &apos;to order&apos;, you&apos;d have burgers cycle through cooking. If you sold them, great. Otherwise, when they became too well-cooked to be sold as burgers, they were removed from the grill and set in an unrefrigerated pan below the grill. The pan was emptied between rushes (when possible) into a collector bin in the walkin refrigerator. The accumulated overcooked burgers became the meat for the next day&apos;s batch of chili.
