 O.C. July unemployment edges up to 9.3% 

August 19th, 2011, 10:51 am· ·posted by Mary Ann Milbourn 
 
Orange County’s job market hit the skids in July, with employers cutting 5,900 net jobs, mostly due to teachers going on summer vacation, state employment officials reported today.

At the same time, about 13,000 more people came into the job market — another typical summertime move as students look for work. The combination of fewer jobs and more people looking pushed the local unemployment rate up to 9.3% in July from 9.2% in June. That is the highest it has been since the jobless rate hit 9.5% last November.

Statewide employers added 4,500 jobs  in July and the unemployment rate rose to 12% from 11.8% in June. California continues to have the second highest unemployment rate in the nation after Nevada at 12.9%.

The weak showing wasn’t unexpected. The U.S. July unemployment report released two weeks ago showed the nation adding a modest 117,000 jobs. The U.S. jobless rate edged down to 9.1% in July from 9.2% in June.

 

Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman University, said a lot shouldn’t be read into July’s monthly decline in Orange County jobs due to the seasonal factors of teachers being off and students looking for work.

He noted that looking at the year over year numbers, which eliminates some of the monthly fluctuations, the county is growing again, adding 13,900 jobs.

Adibi, however, said the biggest concern is not what happened in July, but what is occurring now and over the next few months with the debt problems in Europe and unresolved budget deficit issues in the United States.

“This is really disconcerting to not only the equity markets, but consumer confidence,”he said.“If not resolved, I would say a recession is very, very likely.”

Locally, a potential grocery workers strike also adds to the uncertainty. About 62,000 Vons, Albertsons and Ralphs grocery are voting today on whether to walk out.

In the last grocery strike in 2003, workers were off the job more than four months and the grocers lost an estimated $1.5 billion.

A new strike, however, could be an opportunity for some of the currently unemployed to pick up some work. Vons and Albertsons are accepting job applications for fill-in workers in anticipation of a possible strike.

July’s Orange County jobs report wasn’t all bad news. The hard-hit construction industry added 2,100 jobs and is now up 3,800 since July 2010.

Professional and business services hired 2,500 workers last month while employers in the financial sector brought on 500.

 Leader Enterprises , a Seal Beach public relations agency, is in one of those pockets of the market that is showing some strength.

Marc Altieri, vice president of marketing and communications, said his staff has more than doubled to 30 in the last two years, partly due to the economic downturn.  His firm specializes in the current sweet spot of public relations—social media.

“I believe companies are being forced to turn to lower-cost marketing for name branding,”he said.“The low cost of social media is a huge boon.”

Leader also has the advantage of representing companies like Vizio, DirecTV and sporting goods maker Mizuno, which have been able to navigate the downturn and thrive.

Still, Altieri said the company has been careful to manage hiring, noting the company  only adds staff when it knows it will have the business to support them.

Orange County was the only Southern California county whose unemployment rate wasn’t in the double digits in July.  Here’s how the other counties fared:

 Los Angeles: 13.3% Riverside: 15.2% San Bernardino: 14.3% San Diego: 10.5% Ventura: 10.7%

Gavin Newsom will save us by making more goverment agencies to suck the public dry.
 puttingforpar says: August 19, 2011 at 11:25 am 
I thought the tax breaks for the rich, er I mean the“Job Creators”would get companies hiring again.

The companies are just keeping their wealth and enjoying huge bonuses.

I am still thankful I have a good job.

Before you blame Obama, remember he continued the tax cuts that again, were supposed to create jobs.

Fail.

My 2 favorite Thomas Jefferson quotes are:

“I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.”

“The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.”
 
 trentbridge says: August 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm 
Jefferson had slaves. Did“wasting the labors of the people under the pretext of taking care of them”include them?

Wikipedia:

Thomas Jefferson, a world-famous advocate of liberty, lived in a slave society; he had a 5,000-acre plantation and owned hundreds of slaves during his lifetime. He relied on slavery to support his family’s lifestyle
 
 No more Taxes says: August 19, 2011 at 12:56 pm 
I like your responses, they are interesting. Please tell me you are smart enough to understand that he did not believe that he was doing his slaves a favor. The African tribes that sold the slaves were also not doing the slaves a favor. At that time, the government was not interested in the rights of slaves.

His quotes apply to free members of society, and I think you know that.

Having said that, the quote still applies.

I may have missed your point. Are you saying that society is trying to make slaves of the productive members of society? I might agree with you on that.

I forgot to mention that we all are job creators, except the government. They can only subsidize an industry at the expense (by taxation) of another.

You can blame Obama. He is failure after failure.

“This stimulus (which includes tax breaks for corporate jets) will keep unemployment below 8%.”

“Who gave tax breaks for corporate jets, they don’t need that.”

“I figured out that there are no shovel-ready jobs.”(After he blew $1,000,000,000,000)

“This healthcare law (that no one read before signing) will lower healthcare premiums by $2500 / yr for the average family.”

Gitmo–Open

The list could go on FOREVER!!

Name 1 accomplishment!

Credit Card Reform Act of 2009.

NEW YORK (MainStreet) — On the heels of news that late credit card payments are at a 17-year low, a new study says Americans are becoming happier with their credit card issuers too.

According to J.D. Power and Associates, customer satisfaction with credit card companies increased for the second year in a row, with issuers collectively averaging 731 on a 1,000-point scale in 2011, up from 714 in 2010 and 705 in 2009.

J.D. Power said that the overall scores increased thanks to improvements in card issuers’ problem resolution and brand reputation categories. However, they said that a lot of the added points can be traced to both a decline in interest rates and more transparency provided by issuers regarding the terms and conditions associated with their products, which was one provision of recent financial reform legislation.

“It appears that credit card companies are doing a better job of communicating with customers, which may be an effect of the CARD Act,” Michael Beird, director of banking services at J.D. Power and Associates, said in a press release. “This improved communication is key to ensuring that customers fully understand their credit card terms, particularly benefits and fees, which helps reduce the number of problems reported and improves the overall experience.”
 
 No more Taxes says: August 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm 
I will edit your reference and change it to“is”as opposed to a“may”in the“which may be an effect of the CARD Act”. That will be my starting point.

This essentially proves my point that the Government can only subsidize an industry at the expense of another. In this case, they have forced credit card issuers (banks) to provide better service to credit card users. As a result, these same banks are starting to charge more fees to cover the costs. You need a minimum balance for“free checking”.

Another problem is that it places a larger burden on the banks to treat their customers like children. I have never had a problem understanding my credit card terms. Have you been unable to understand your credit card terms before CARD Act?

The unintended consequences are not part of this survey.

Can you give me an example that looks at the whole picture and includes the negative impact of unintended consequences?

There are many road construction projects going on in CA. There was the fwy 405 expansion project. The widening of the freeway 22. More city streets construction projects are being performed. Yes, the stimulus is working. Only those stupid republicans are blind to see. They are too depressed and need to go see a psychiatrist. Moretaxes definitely is a basketcase. Go gag yourself and stop posting stupid comments.

In God we trust, God bless the USA.
 
 No more Taxes says: August 19, 2011 at 1:01 pm 
You keep telling people to go and see a psychiatrist. If you think that you are the only sane person, that may be a sign.

We have not paid the money back. If you borrow and spend, you appear to have a better standard of living, but you need to pay it back.

Why is unemployment above 8%.
 vote4obama2012 says: August 19, 2011 at 1:22 pm 
moretaxes is another stupid republican that doesn’t want to listen.

why is unemployment rate is above 8%? it’s because when Obama took office, it was already above 8% and heading higher. There were many, many companies going out of business in 2009: Circuit City Stores, Mervyn’s, Washington Mutual, AIG, Merryl Lynch, Linen N Things, Lehman Brother, Indy Mac, New Century, and many more. The list is too long.

These companies were big present in CA. You add these problems to the housing problems. Then you have the home builders: Centex, KB Homes, Pulsar, etc. They were also laying off people in large number. Then you have the mortgage bankers filing for bankruptcies. More people are unemployed. As you can see, these problems were compounding as President Obama took office. Not to mention, many car dealerships were also losing money and have to be closed. How many car dealerships closed in CA? hundreds or maybe thousands. I know OC closed at least 20 dealerships. These mechanics, salesmen, parts clerks, office workers are now unemployed.

Anyways, if you use your common sense and not be depressed about it, you will see the lights.

As far as the construction money, it will pay back in hundred folds. Better road infrastructure means better transportation, moving of goods and people. Save people money on gas and time. Every minute you stay on the road, you spend $0.20. So if you have alot of traffic, alot of delays, you waste money just waiting.

In God we trust, God bless the USA.
 No more Taxes says: August 19, 2011 at 2:41 pm 
Obamavoter,

According to Obama, the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8%.

You state that the stimulus has worked, but it did not have the ability to keep unemployment below 8%. Less than 5% went to infrastructure. Your roads were $50 billion. The rest was wasted.

Thanks for the list of companies, that was nice.
 Dan C. says: August 19, 2011 at 3:08 pm 
You are a stupid,blind moron. Government infrastructure projects do not contribute to the GDP.
Now shut up before you make an even bigger @ss of yourself.
 vote4obama2012 says: August 19, 2011 at 11:30 pm 
I think Obama at the time, in February 2009, had underestimated the unemployment force. The economy didn’t stop shredding jobs until March 2010 which was when the economy started expanding and adding jobs. The 800bil stimulus included cash aids to states, unemployment benefits, schools, etc.. Yes infrastructure was only 5% of the total stimulus.

The aid to states helped alot to cushion the blow to the economy. The unemployment benefits helped struggling workers to make ends meet. Without those stimulus, the economy is in dire strait. If there were no aids to states, then states have to cut back on services. Our economy is a service economy.

If there were no unemployment benefits, there would be no car insurance sales, gas sales, grocery sales, rent payments, cell-phone services, etc. those purchases from the unemployment benefits help propping up the economy. So the stimulus did work. But the economy was so weak, really really weak, that it just stopped the bleeding. The economy is starting to heal right now very slowly. It will become a scar for some time.

You have to admit there was a tremendous of worries in 2009. The stock market dipped very very low (dow was 6,700, nasdaq 1200, s&amp;P 600. gasoline prices went as low as $1.72 a gallon.

One accomplsihment, stopping the rise of 1/2% a month in unemployment and saving us from a major depression.
 
 3dflyboy1 says: September 3, 2011 at 3:40 pm 
We’re already in a recession. Anyone could avoid a“major depression.”When the unemployment rate goes under 8%, then say“WOO HOO GO OBAMA.”But that’s not gonna happen soon, if ever. Obama isn’t coming back for another term, hopefully.

 http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/02/poll-8-in-10-think-were-in-a-recession/?hpt=po_bn1 

8/10 of Americans think we’re in a recession, and only 34% approve of how Obama is handling the economy.

NoMoreTaxes guy is dead right. And Jerry Brown is no better than Obama.

What? Teachers get paid during the summer. They are not on unemployment.
 Charlie says: August 19, 2011 at 11:52 am 
No one with any common sense is going to make expansions in their current business structure with so many issues on the table.

For example, Obamacare and it’s ultimate costs to an employer, daily revisions of code and enforcement from such lovely organizations as the EPA, continual expansion of local and surrounding code enforcement (coupled with increased fees).

Keep in mind that businesses are hoarding BILLIONS in bank accounts for the fear of jumping in at this time. They are looking to build where economies are stable (our’s is NOT), where there is lessor involvement by the government, and where they see the ability to generate profitable sales.

The shouts for raising the“tax on the rich”is nothing more than a way for the folks in the WH to find another source of dollars to fuel their ridiculous spending plans.

The government needs to establish some pro business policies, reverse the Obamacare disaster, quit micro managing the business community (especially since the government does NOT know how to run a business ),free up our trade policies/treaties, and get the heck out of the way.

Then, and only then, will you see an increase in jobs.

The major companies that once employed millions of Americans have all left the U.S. using the excuse of high corporate taxes, but the real reason is cheaper labor and no unions. These foreign countries have given away their future and now the Citizens are paying the price for it.
 vote4obama2012 says: August 19, 2011 at 12:43 pm 
This is a good sign that economy is growing.

There are many forces in play right now. More companies are hiring more workers. The labor market is expanding. The housing prices are still under water for many people.

If companies continue hiring, these workers are willing and motivated to become productive to society. More leisure, tourism, and hospitality jobs are added to the workforce. This means people do have money to spend for leisure and fun stuffs. California will become the state to bring the nation into the good, prosperous times. Governor Brown is going to bring CA into golden times again. More road construction projects on going in CA from stimulus spending. This will help a great deal. Thank you President Obama.

In God we trust, God bless the USA.

Speaking of BofA, what’s up with those horrid new red signs of theirs? Incredibly garish like the interior of a fast food restaurant and the color red is usually associated with a warning signal. Not the kind of thing a bank as troubled as BofA should want to broadcast to the world.

I have almost 40k stashed at that bank which I’m seriously considering moving to my brokerage acct or a credit union before BofA declares a“bank holiday”and screws over their customers royally.

“O.C. July unemployment edges up to 9.3%”

—————————————————————————————–

All the more reason why I avidly support Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone’s proposal to secede SoCal from the rest of California due to its draconian business and environmental regulations that have driven so many businesses away from Southern California.

Carl’s Jr., which got its start here is poised to move its headquarters to Texas because of CA’s high tax rates.

If Jeff Stone’s proposal goes through and is approved by the proper authorities, then I think you’ll see many companies moving back to SoCal and, perhaps, expand its operations, including Carl’s Jr., and then you’re gonna see that unemployment rate go way down while the rest of Liberal California suffer double-digit unemployment rate..
 Dan C. says: August 19, 2011 at 3:15 pm 
Barry Soetoro sure is focused on jobs these days. He found the time this week to sign an executive order halting most deportation proceedings. That will surely bring unemployment down and reduce the deficit.
