 Sonic’s new‘medium’milkshake 
 
Just read something interesting. The burger chain Sonic recently decided to add two new milkshake sizes to their menu. They currently offer a 14oz and a 20oz size. They are adding a 10oz and a 32oz size. The CEO said they don’t think they are going to sell many of the 32oz size, however, having that size on the menu will make more people order the 20oz size because they will feel that it is‘medium’now. Awesome.

 Modmarket will be open July 4th! 
 FYI–Modmarket will be open on July 4th. Denver stores will be open till 3pm and Boulder until 3.3opm. Come get your healthy lunch (or breakfast in GV) before you begin your evening festivities!
 Eating in Season: A Healthy Habit for Body and Planet 
 
By Julie Hammerstein, CN


Have you ever bit into a peach in January to find it chalky, mushy and just generally unpalatable?
It’s really no surprise.  The reason you don’t get the yummy peach experience in January is because peaches aren’t generally grown in January!  If you live in colder climates, the peach at your local grocery store has been flown thousands of miles to get to us, or it’s been frozen or genetically grown.

Not so peachy keen.

On the other hand, if you were to cook up some rhubarb soup in January, you would probably be pleasantly surprised with the richness in taste. The explanation for this is simple: Rhubarb is in season in January.
Eating in season is beneficial for a multitude of reasons. When food is in its prime it has the most flavor and nutrition.  It’s also more eco-friendly in that the seasons provide a natural way to balance the earth’s resources.

By following some simple guidelines, you can embrace seasonal eating and the benefits will prevail:


Get to know your local Farmer’s Market:



Buying produce at a Farmer’s Market is the easiest way to ensure your food is fresh and in season. By visiting the market, you’re also supporting the local economy and it’s farmers.  I also think it’s fun to meet the people growing my food!



Familiarize yourself with which foods are in season:



Spring Months: Greens such as Swiss chard, basil and romaine lettuce
Summer Months: Berries, plums, pears, summer squash and corn
Fall Months: Carrots, sweet potatoes, onions and garlic
Winter Months: Root vegetables such as potatoes, beets, and yams
These are just a few, but there are great resources on the internet, so just Google ‘eating in season’.



Get creative with your recipes:



This past weekend my son Max and I went to an indoor Farmer’s Market. We picked up some arugula, asparagus and some hand-made pastas and orzo. The orzo was made with chestnut, sage and pumpkin.  It was gorgeous. We also picked up some in-season organic strawberries.
We cooked the orzo and tossed it with the arugula, some blanched asparagus and a little olive oil and sea salt.  It was a delicious meal, and our dessert of macerated strawberries, topped with chopped mint and fresh sage was a treat spooned over organic vanilla gelato. Find foods that are in season, and then hop on the web to explore great recipes that keep your food interesting.



Find restaurants that serve seasonal foods:



The other day I found my new favorite restaurant in Denver. It’s called Modmarket, and their food is fabulous! They are very committed to serving as many locally grown and seasonal foods as possible, which makes me feel really good about bringing my family there, and recommending it to clients. I sampled several of their dishes, and gobbled up the Thai Coconut Salad, the Superfood Salad, and the Eggplant Goat Cheese toasted sandwich. Wow, so delicious, fresh and healthy. I also love that this restaurant pays attention to healthy packaged side dishes. We enjoyed a bag of all natural PopChips, and they have a nice selection of local beer and wine. I wish all restaurants could think this way ~ serving great food while being mindful of what’s in season and what serves our bodies and the planet!
So these are just a few tips to keep in mind. If you’re interested in learning how to prepare these wonderful seasonal foods, you can check out my website for lots of yummy recipes at www.juliehammerstein.com .

Bon apetit!
