Keep them honest: preventing internal theft at the bar requires a watchful eye and stringent systems.

A wise operator once told me that banks don&apos;t don&apos;t

people, rather, they put systems in place that keep people honest.
Preventing theft in a restaurant or bar requires the operator to
establish and maintain proper systems to manage every aspect of the
operation.

The first step is to identify the opportunities for theft,
including who might steal, what they steal and how they steal. The focus
on theft at the bar is often on the bartenders, but theft can transpire
from many different constituencies, including wait staff, bar staff,
management staff, kitchen staff, the cleaning crew, vendors, delivery
drivers as well as customers. Identifying the areas where each of these
people has an opportunity to steal will allow you to understand what
types of systems will help you to prevent theft.

There are many ways that employees can steal product, chief among
them slipping full bottles into their bags or back packs or helping
themselves to product during their shift. Employees may offer
&quot;free&quot; product to other employees, a gesture reciprocated by
those employees at a later date or time. Bartenders sometimes drink free
at other establishments in the area by providing free drinks for those
barkeeps at their own place of employment.

Another way to steal is to secure product from the kitchen that is
not rung up, with the proceeds being pocketed, or the product being
given away to the guest for a &quot;goodwill&quot; tip. Non-alcohol
beverages are an easy target for this tactic. Bartenders will sometimes
cover their tracks by under-pouring recipes in the service bar in order
to over-pour their guests at the front bar or to cover the cost of
giving away unauthorized free drinks. This tactic can be particularly
difficult to catch as it doesn&apos;t does·n&apos;t

The number of ways for employees to steal cash is almost limitless,
so let&apos;s cover one of the more popular methods: serving drinks that
are not rung up and placing the money in the tip jar. In order to do so,
bartenders need to keep up with how many drinks they have not rung up so
they can get the cash out of the register at some point. This is usually
accomplished by a counting method such as keeping items in the cash
drawer A cash drawer is generally a compartment underneath a cash register in which the cash from transactions is kept. The drawer is usually divided into separate compartments for notes and coins for ease of use.  that don&apos;t belong there--paperclips, rubber bands or

reason to recover the cash from the cash drawer, which is usually done

Employees don&apos;t just steal from the company; they also steal
from customers, which can take the form of overcharging, shortchanging
or including the tip on the bill and forgetting to disclose this fact.
Theft from customers most often occurs when a smaller cash ticket is
combined with a larger credit card bill and the employee then pockets
the cash from the cash ticket. The favorite target for this technique is
a large party with many drinks and appetizers that won&apos;t likely
notice an additional $20 or $30 added to their tab.

Some of the telltale signs that you have a theft problem include a
high beverage cost, low bartender productivity, low or declining
beverage sales and unusually high tips. Additionally, a low labor cost
could indicate inadequate staff coverage which can result in lower sales
and higher beverage cost. Again, be aware that not all theft shows up as
increased beverage cost.

SMALL STEPS, BIG SAVINGS

Creating systems and policies to control the security of cash and
product are the best ways to prevent theft. Following are a few of my
favorites My Favorite is an independent synthpop band from Long Island, New York. They released two CDs: Love at Absolute Zero and Happiest Days of Our Lives . My Favorite broke up on September 14, 2005, when singer Andrea Vaughn left the band. :

* Ring it up! Account for every item served immediately.

* Tip jars should not be near the register and bartenders should
not be allowed to make change out of them.

* Mid-shift drawer A person who orders a bank to withdraw money from an account to pay a designated person a specific sum according to the term of a bill, a check, or a draft.

* Managers should receive and secure all product orders.

* Compare beverage cost to theoreticals.

* Train in proper recipes and methods. Remember, waste equals cost.

* Measure bartender productivity. This may be the best way to
identify a thief.

* Look for these signs:

- Inaccurate cash drawer. Over or under indicates a problem.

- Friends or coworkers of your staff or other hospitality employees
hanging out in your establishment.

- Counting tools in or around cash drawers.

- High beverage cost.

Policies don&apos;t prevent theft--enforcement of policies prevents
theft. High visibility and involvement of managers in the bar operation
is the single biggest factor in controlling sales and profits and
curtailing theft.
