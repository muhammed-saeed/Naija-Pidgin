Being that it is summer now, my husband and I love evening drives. We were in South San Jose and figured, what they hey!! Lets go to Sonics. We made it for the 1/2 off shakes. My husband got a meal, I got some onion rings and 2 shakes. Came out to be around $10 with food to spare.

I like how the drive in is set up. It makes Sonic so unique and an experience every time you go there. My dog also loves this place. Tons of people, food constantly rolling by, the smells.

Great way to spend a hot summer evening. Its just a short road trip away. Lets hope the gas keeps coming down.

You know what sucks? Seeing Sonic commercials when there&apos;s none near your area. You know what sucks more? Going to Sonic&apos;s and finding out that it&apos;s nowhere near as good as the commercials make it look.

This was what happened to me back in high school before they opened this location in Gilroy. We drove out to Tracy to get it. Totally not worth it.

But now, Sonic&apos;s is relatively closer at around 40 minutes away. Totally not worth it to drive there just for Sonic&apos;s, but it&apos;s also conveniently on the way to I-5 to go to southern California.

So I stop by here a lot of the times I drive to or from Socal.

I imagine this is how people feel when they get back with their exes. You know it&apos;s a bad idea. You know that the last time you did it, it wasn&apos;t that great. You know that appearances are misleading and the food doesn&apos;t look anything like those commercials and those menu pictures, but for some reason your brain says &quot;goddamn that burger looks tasty. I would like nothing more than to take a bite of that burger.&quot;

I&apos;ve never hooked up with an ex, but I have been to Sonic&apos;s knowing full well I didn&apos;t like it the last time I went and I have left Sonic&apos;s with it matching my terribly low expectations.

They have tons of happy hour deals, daily specials, but I don&apos;t plan my trip around their specials.

What I like here:

Oreo Sonic Blast
Chili Cheese Tater Tots
SuperSonic Bacon Double Cheeseburger

What I don&apos;t like here:

Pretty much everything else

Their drinks are mostly soda mixed with different syrups. It&apos;s a lot of variety, but if someone offered me a platter of assorted feces from different animals, it&apos;s still a platter of crap!

Their food is extra unhealthy and fried. They list all of the calories at least so you know how bad the food is for you. Their cheddar jalapenos are some of the cheesiest jalapeno poppers I&apos;ve ever eaten. (not in a good way)

I don&apos;t like the whipped cream they have on their Sonic Blast. I should remember to ask for no whipped cream next time. Who needs whipped cream when you&apos;re eating a ton of ice cream already?

I talked to our rollerblading waitress and I found out that Sonic&apos;s makes their employees buy their own rollerblades too. And then they make them wear them all day while they&apos;re working. And there&apos;s no tip jar or anything. Seems like a terrible job. My condolences.

I will be back here. And I won&apos;t like it. But I will be back here.

The Sonic commericals make the food to die for. Every stoner&apos;s dream. But, when you actually try it, it&apos;s just alright. I had gone here a couple years ago when they first opened, on the way back to LA. I had a puppy then, so we opted to sit outside, and not have the real drive-in experience. Plus, since they had just opened, there weren&apos;t any drive in&apos;s available on a late Sunday night. Had a burger and the tater tots. The burger was average, and sitting in the cold and trying to have the pup be settled probably didnt help either. The tater tots are good, but how can you go wrong with these tots?

I was told its the drinks that make Sonic&apos;s food, so will have to try that next time, and enjoy it in the luxury of the car, while having the servers bring it by on roller skates. :)

My family and I literally just left and I NEVER yelp and today I really felt the need to yelp. If I could give them ZERO stars I would!

This location&apos;s customer service definitely depends on the time come. We have been here during the day and have had great customer service and our whole order completely correct. The night crew... A WHOLE different story. Being that Sonic is on our way home we have been here a couple times before at night the first time OK they get something wrong big deal... They fix it and move on. Second time same thing... We try to give them the benefit of the doubt and today every single meal of the 3 that I ordered was wrong!

For starters a #1 is a CHEESEburger, we ordered 2 one for myself with no tomato and one for my daughter no tomato no onion add bacon on both no one said anything about no cheese, both burgers had no cheese and both had tomato. I also ordered a large watermelon slush and they couldn&apos;t even get that right!

If you ask me whoever the Manager/General Manager is needs to re-evaluate their night staff. We will never go back at night. Hopefully the day shift doesn&apos;t turn into the night shift.

Here are a few possible movie titles I would dedicate in tribute to Sonics:

The Blissful Joys of Eating in Your Car

Tots, Dogs and Shakes OH MY!

The Last Food Stop before 152

The Way to a Girl&apos;s Heart is on Rollerblades

What Happens in the Drive-In Stall, Stays in the Drive-in Stall.

Ultimate Breakfast Burrito was Ultimate

How Thrilled I am that a place like Sonic&apos;s still exists!
The issue of tipping carhops came up, and without hesitation I say yes! If your carhop (aka waiter on rollerblades!) did a great service then he/she definitely deserves it!
And our carhop actually came out and modestly tried to refuse the tip! No way dude. I feel bad we didnt tip earlier, or more.

Great customer service.  Friendly employees and fun atmosphere.  But that doesn&apos;t make up for the very mediocre food.  It&apos;s clear that they put no thought into the food preparation itself and all of the thought into the carhop experience.  Food comes too quickly, which shows me that it&apos;s not fresh and has been sitting.  And believe me, it tastes like it.  On our last visit to this location, we specifically asked for HOT fries, because the last few times we&apos;ve gone, they&apos;ve been cold.  So, we get our fries and guess what, they&apos;re cold!  So we send them back and receive hot fries ... except for the fact that the fries and still completely white and floppy.  Not crisp and golden.  They are in too much of a hurry here to just grind out the food and give no thought to its quality, or flavor.  The fries we got were indedible!  And when I thought about it, I realized their fries are never crisp and golden.  Their recipe must call for white and floppy fries.  Who likes that?  Come on Sonic, don&apos;t let a good thing die.  Get your act together and make the food good too!!!!!!  Not just the shakes and carhop service!

The level of customer service here is dependent on the time of day you go. During the day I&apos;ve had great service. The food itself is what you&apos;d expect from a burger joint. It&apos;s a nice change from your standard McDonald&apos;s fare. And the slushes are a nice treat, especially on a warm Gilroy day.

Most of my stops tend to be late at night, which seems to be when the B-Crew is on duty. After a certain time you can only order via drive thru, which I understand. What I don&apos;t understand is why they seem to be &quot;out&quot; of certain items late at night. You&apos;re out of hot fudge? Lies! You just cleaned the machine so you&apos;ve stopped serving hot fudge for the night. I&apos;d appreciate the truth.

Avoid the restrooms at all costs. They&apos;re consistently under maintained and underserviced. I always feel so yucky just walking in there.

Definitely won&apos;t waste my time on a road trip going out of my way to visit this place again.. Here&apos;s why:

1.) All their food is ridiculously caloric. I mean I know it is fast food but still...you&apos;d be better off getting an double double from in n out.

2.) Their fries are bland, undersalted, and too greasy.

3.) The few times that I&apos;ve been here, it has taken quite a while to get my order.

4.) Their bathroom was DISGUSTING!! That&apos;s why I stopped here in the first place.

5.) The burger was just subpar. Really nothing special at all. There is too much bun and it overpowers the food.

What is kind of cool though is the old school drive in feel. You drive into a parking spot and order from a menu right next to you. You can take your time deciding what you want, and THEN press a button to order from the employee. I&apos;m indecisive and like to take my time deciding so this is nice.

I mean, this place is just average at best. I&apos;d definitely rather have In N Out, the Habit, or even Wendy&apos;s.. If there is absolutely nothing else to eat then I&apos;d go again, but otherwise do your body a favor and get some better food.

If I could, I&apos;d give this particular location a ZERO.

My family and I were en route to San Jose for a road trip when we decided to stop by this Sonic for a quick dinner. Because I&apos;ve always loved Sonic, I was excited to finally stop and eat but the moment I took a sip of my drink and a bite of my food, I was completely disappointed.

- The onion rings looked like they had gone through a paper shredder
- My breakfast sandwich was messy (it looked like they had just thrown it together in a hurry) and the egg was too salty
- My strawberry limeade was disgusting; it was watered-down, bitter, and overpowered with Sprite
Yuck! Yuck! YUCK!

I understand that we had stopped by during a busy time (6 PM on a Friday night) but there is never an excuse to give customers ugly, disgusting food.

Needless to say, I didn&apos;t even bother to finish my food and continued about our trip with an unsatisfied stomach.

The only upside was the friendly service.

Yea I know it&apos;s at least partially my fault.......
I shouldn&apos;t have came here 1. in the daytime and 2. sober
Since I&apos;m not in the mood to take the blame, I&apos;m dumping it all on Sonic.
The Ched &apos;R&apos; Peppers are actually better than the spelling of their name would have you think. Guess it was just a bad attempt at trying to be clever. Not as good as Jack In The Box&apos;s Jalapeno Poppers, but they&apos;re decent....so is the thick ranch dressing they bring for you to dip them in
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 

Fries were good, but how many of my almost 1000 reviews have you seen me talking bad about fries? 1 or 2 MAYBE.
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 

Here&apos;s where I knew I effed up.....the Sonic Burger w/ Cheese. It felt like what I would expect if Jack in The Box made a burger using McDonald&apos;s meat. If you&apos;ve ever tried to eat McD&apos;s meat w/o any sauce.....you&apos;ll know that&apos;s not a good thing.
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_… 

To make things worse.....I&apos;m not feelin&apos; the whole &quot;eat in your car&quot; thing they&apos;ve got goin on.....it took me two goddamn days to get the smell out of my car!
I would say that I&apos;ve learned my lesson, but knowing my fat a**, I&apos;ll be back to try the hot dogs.

There are a lot of reviews that are mediocre on Sonic&apos;s, let&apos;s just say I gotta love it. Why? Because of the &quot;Happy Hour&quot; for the drinks which means half off, even if you&apos;re getting a RT44, which is a good price for it. There are some things you could&apos;ve made at home by scratch, yet I came upon this place with the fiancee to have a quick bite, even if it&apos;s a long drive, after watching the movies, or an outing.

Our expeience here is always great, and they would ask us if we wanted more napkins or anything before they left. The only thing that disappointed me was that the sweet potato tots weren&apos;t that great, and I could get it somewhere else. Another thing is that they close the bathroom to a certain hour, so if you were in needing of a bathroom at night @ around 9ish close to 10pm, they don&apos;t open it.

Pretty good fast food place. They have a huuuge menu.&amp;I love driving in&amp;watching the workers rollerskate to us with our food, haha.

I haven&apos;t tried much, since I don&apos;t go here all the time, but my favorites would be their Super Sonic breakfast burrito (it has tator tots, egg, sausage,&amp;jalapenos!), tator tots, onion rings, and certainly their strawberry limeade! One day, I came here not knowing it was happy hour, which is half off any drink, so I got a large strawberry limeade for around $1.10&amp;a medium cranberry limeade for my boyfriend for only $1! I really recommend the strawberry limeade! My boyfriend wouldn&apos;t stop drinking my drink. And weird to say, but Sonics has the best ice in their drinks.

My boyfriend&apos;s favorite is their chicago dog, which means I always get a couple of bites when we go. It is pretty good, but not all that amazing. It would taste better if the the hot dog was bigger, because it seems like the toppings overpower the actual hot dog.

Oh, their banana split&amp;ice cream cone really hits the sweet tooth! And their milkshake is AMAZING. My friend&amp;I got a vanilla milkshake one time and it was very thick&amp;creamy. Once it melted a little, it still tasted so good!

First time at a Sonic since there aren&apos;t any Sonics remotely close to the San Francisco Bay Area.

Drive-up diner offers an experience that is unmatched by any fast food restaurant.
Order at any one of their booths and pay right on the spot. Then a waiter will come out to your car and deliver the food straight to your window. They even have people cleaning outside on ROLLERBLADES, pretty cool if you ask me.

I ordered the double cheese burger, medium tots, and a medium drink. As far as the food goes, the in-n-out burgers taste better and the medium tots don&apos;t have enough flavor.

For those that don&apos;t want to stay in their cars, they offer an outdoor seating area.

I&apos;ve heard Sonic&apos;s dessert is amazing so I should leave enough room it next time.

Slushes...for the win.

I&apos;ve been once, a long time ago.

I find the curbside/doorside service to be very disturbing.   Yes, I know that it&apos;s a throwback, etc.... but I really hate that much attention for fast food!

Prices = reasonable.

I&apos;ll have to try their food again...

Yes, they accept plastic! Woohoo!

Wanted to like this place so bad since it was on prime real estate right off the 152 interchange on the way to the 5 (if you&apos;re taking a road trip to LA from the South Bay). Only real hot fast food without back tracking over the freeway. What&apos;s cool is that you just drive up and order from your car (nice touch since we had a car load of Xmas gifts and didn&apos;t want to leave it unattended) and some peeps on roller skates bring you your food.

What we swallowed:

ALL AMERICAN HOT DOG: Small and salty. Maybe I&apos;m just spoiled comparing it to the Costco hotdog but dang, it wasn&apos;t even good. Even Hotdog on a Stick&apos;s hotdogs are better.

POPCORN CHICKEN - The chicken was dry and the batter was hard. The Canadian liked it but then again he likes his chicken dry as jerky so there you go.

BACON CHEDDAR TOASTER MELT- The picture shows a burger in between two thick, toasted Texas-toast style pieces of bread. What arrived was a little hamburger in a toasted hamburger bun.

ONION RINGS - These were crispy but why did the batter taste like churro dough? Is that cinnamon in the batter? Was there a churro onion ring we accidentally ordered? It was interesting and gross at the same time.

OREO BLAST- This this was SUPER thick. When they say &quot;Order your  shake for the road&quot; they mean it. It was an hour into the drive before I could even get a bit through the straw. At least it gave my arms something to do since I had five more hours to kill until we reached LA. At least Wendy&apos;s gives you a spoon with their Frosty, with this one I needed a hammer and chisel.

The food was gross but at least the service was super fast. Yeah for roller skate Service!

Our concensus: Been there, never gonna do it again. What a waste of calories.

This is a general review on Sonic&apos;s as a whole.

For good and affordable fast food, I&apos;d rather go to Sonic&apos;s than McDonalds. After a hearty meal, I don&apos;t get have that greasy oily after taste in my mouth. Fast food is fast food and it&apos;s unhealthy no matter where you go.

What to get (or rather what I&apos;ve tried and liked):

-Chili cheese tot&apos;s are bomb(dot)com
-French Toast sticks are quite delicious
-Don&apos;t be fooled by the photos of their burgers, they&apos;re pretty big and tasty.
-You can never go wrong with a corn dog or chili cheese dog
-Their slushes are refreshing on a hot day
-And lastly, I always get their Vanilla malt shakes, I love malts!

They have a large menu and a variety of drinks, ranging from slushes to soft drinks and shakes. They are reasonably priced and I do dig the skating service that they provide. I&apos;ve never had a bad experience at any of the sonic&apos;s that I have been to. Enjoy your food and happy Yelping!

A ritual to swing by and grab food for the road on the windy long road to Southern California is my excuse to stop by Sonics.

Sonics brings a nice change of pace of how and what you eat. There is only outdoor seating and car ports to order from, and the waitpersons are on roller skates/blades to deliver your food (do watch out for them when driving please).

Menu is pretty extensive, but I love anyplace that serves breakfast items all day. They serve tots as a substitution to fries? Um, yes please!

Drink selections are amazing and warrants people to come take advantage of their Happy Hour (Route 44 are perfect for those long drives).

Sonics is definitely an experience I enjoy, and I look forward to stopping by whenever I am in the area or passing through. I don&apos;t expect great food, but this is a fast food joint that does its job in style.

I&apos;m really giving Sonic five stars. Here&apos;s why:

On the drive from San Francisco to LA, I got really hungry as we were sitting in mid-morning traffic. We came across this Sonic (conveniently enough, it would become my first Sonic experience ever) and I handed over all the change I had in my bag just to get this single crispy chicken sandwich. I don&apos;t even think I looked at the menu board. I just needed this sandwich desperately, like only people on road trips need sandwiches desperately.

It tasted homemade, I swear. It&apos;s not just the hunger talking - it really was warm, juicy, and tender in a way that I&apos;ve only ever dreamed of from a fast food chain. I would do it again, and then do it some more.

Well, it&apos;s Sonic&apos;s.. and it isn&apos;t an hour drive away! Before this place was built.. the closest one to me was all the way in Tracy.. and sure enough.. I had friends who make the long trip out there just to get some food.

What helps make Sonic&apos;s great, isn&apos;t just their food, but their drinks. If you&apos;re there during their Happy Hour, then you have no reason to go thirsty. The location is great as well, though still a drive away for me.. it&apos;s at least closer.

I always like the onion rings at Sonic&apos;s. The batter that&apos;s used has a nice sweet taste to it.

We stopped by here before getting on HWY 5 for LA; my friend suggested that we eat here since I hadn&apos;t tried Sonic before.  I rarely eat an actual fast food meal but I make exceptions for eating at new joints.  Seemed like an interesting setup, no indoor seating or bathrooms it seemed.  Only stations where you can park your car and order?  We chose to sit in the outdoor area where you have a ordering station that takes your order.  The food choices were different from McD or BK, they had hot dogs, burrito wrap things, and sandwich things.

Luckily a ordered a normal sized burger (not a big one), fries, and a drink.  The food is alright, not horribly bad... but not that good either.  I can see why there are not that many locations.  In-and-out obviously still had better food.  They should have a bathroom or hand wipes available for people who eat in the outdoor area and even for the people who eat in the car spaces.  I probably will not stop to eat here again unless I absolutely had no other choice to eat here.

Saw this while driving by and we had to try it!  We&apos;ve all heard and seen the commercials so everyone was curious.

I ended up trying the breakfast burrito ($2.99) and it was pretty yums!  I liked how their prices were still &quot;fast food&quot; prices unlike some other joints where its actually pretty expensive unless you go for the dollar menu!

My fav part was the &quot;park-your-car-and-order-and-they-roller-skate-up-­to-bring-your-food&quot; !!  Um helloo!!  If all fast food places had that I would be eating it a lot more =)

Fun and interesting experience- dunno if I would drive out JUST to eat here but if I do see one (not too many around here) and my stomach isn&apos;t bursting, I wouldn&apos;t mind stopping by again.

I have been to this Sonic a few times during my journeys to No. Cal. The food at Sonic in general is not that great, but the drinks are great usually. Yesterday I ordered a green apple limeade that didn&apos;t have enough apple flavoring, so I was very disappointed. Probably won&apos;t be back during my next trip. Step it up, Sonic!

Friends and I stopped by on our way down to LA.  I&apos;m not down with their burgers, but their tots totally make up for it.  GET THE TOTS.

I also tried their cherry limeade (iced), but it tasted extra syrupy, like it was designed to be a slushie instead. :(

After always seeing commercials for this place on TV, my friends and I were excited to finally give it a try on our drive down to LA. We were beyond disappointed--it was DISGUSTING! So disgusting that we couldn&apos;t finish our food even though we had been starving for hours on our drive down!

We ordered jumbo popcorn chicken, sonic burger, cheese tots, and two shakes-- the shakes were the only okay items on the menu, but how can you really go wrong with a shake? After seeing their tempting shake commercials we were expecting something special, but their shakes were not even as good as In-N-Out or Jack in the Box shakes.

The rest of the food was horrendous! The jumbo popcorn chicken was 80% fried flour and 20% chicken meat. The tater tots were soggy and tasted like they were left in the freezer for way to long. I&apos;ve made better tater tots from frozen supermarket packages than those! The burger was less than McDonald&apos;s quality.

Overall, this place was overpriced and disgusting! Never coming back here again!!

Minus one star for the company choosing to put this delicious drive - in the arm pit known as Gilroy.  And not just Gilroy, at the last exit for Gilroy in the middle of nowhere...lol

Tater tots....How can anyone not love tator tots.  Brought back memories of my middle school cafeteria minus the hair in the food.  Lots of choices and will be back next time I feel like driving 30 minutes for drive in food.

Sonic newbies, we drove in and parked and walked over to the &quot;restaurant&quot; to go in for lunch.  Well, all the doors are marked &quot;Employees Only&quot; -- there is no &quot;inside eating&quot; -- you order from your car, pay with credit card at the outdoor station, and a server on roller skates brings your meal.  Think 50s diner for the 21st century.

We both had the Sonic Burger, and they were tasty plus a great value for $3.09.  However, I really came by to sample the milkshakes, which had gathered some good reviews. I was disappointed.  I had a chocolate shake, and nothing was wrong with it, but it truly was a fast food-quality milkshake.  Don&apos;t expect miracles here.

My wife had the Sonic Blast ice cream, which is vanilla ice cream with your choice of add-ons: she had Reeses and Snickers combined.  The ice cream itself is quite bland, the ground-up candy is the only thing it has going for it -- she didn&apos;t finish it.

Three stars for novelty and good burgers for the price.  But, despite the novel concept, this is still fast food.

There aren&apos;t many Sonics in California, so we get pretty excited when we do see one. In this case, we came across this Sonic on the way down from San Francisco. We were full having just eaten and we didn&apos;t any gas because we were at full tank, but we pulled over to get us some Sonic anyway! There&apos;s always room for Sonic, even in a full tummy.

I&apos;ve always appreciated the way Sonics are set up. You have a pull-up, drive thru or walk-in option. Orders are given through an intercom system and your food is delivered by carhops. Pretty neat.

We lucked out when we came because all drinks and shakes were 1/2 off. We each ordered one. I ended up getting a blended orange Fanta and vanilla ice cream shake which i thought could have used more soda. The ice cream over-powered the soda and the entire shake tasted like ice cream. The cherry limeade was pretty awesome though. We also ordered some jalapeno poppers, which i didn&apos;t get to try because they were devoured by the family. The popcorn chicken was good. Crispy and decent sized.

For some reason, Sonics isn&apos;t what it&apos;s hyped up to be. I was expecting delicious burgers and drinks but when my order came out I was severely disappointed. The deluxe burger was everything but deluxe and fell completely flat as it was smooshed up and not even hot. The lemonade was watered down and my tots were soggy! I had a bite of my friend&apos;s chili hot dog and it had a rubbery texture to it. So not appetizing. I could have saved myself the time and gone to burger king five minutes from my house.

I can see why people like tator tots and corn dogs but seriously go to your local supermarket and buy a bag of it from your frozen foods section.

After sitting in traffic and in the hot weather for more than an hour, we got there a little irritated on a Saturday afternoon.  Parked the car and ordered at one of the car ordering stations.  We had realized that we had just arrived at the beginning of their happy hour specials (between the hours of 2pm and 4pm, everyday) which means their drinks such as the: real fruit slushes, flavored ice tea, slushes, etc are all half off!! We were no longer that irritated lol.  We opened all the windows and sat under the shaded station and began to cool down.

We ordered two burgers, onion rings, and two drinks.  The Ocean Water was REALLY good! It was a mixture of blue coconut flavoring syrup and sprite!  The other drink was the real fruit strawberry slush.  It was filled with strawberries and tasted so good.

We got everything for a total of $11. Can&apos;t really beat that for a lunch of two!  (Note: Unfortunately,  the ice cream sundaes/smoothies aren&apos;t included in the happy hour price)

What goes better with a freezing, rainy day than a fruit slushy from Sonics? Umm...the cheesy tots or maybe one of their blizzards I would say.

Which was exactly my first impromptu experience at this restaurant.  My cousin coaxed us into stopping here on our drive back from a baby shower in Hollister and I am completely grateful for it.

I tried the lemon slush and it was sooooo good.  It reminded me of a frozen lemonade from Great America!!! Yes, it was that good.  The hubby got a raspberry ice tea slush which was very tasty.  The cuzzos got the Oreo blizzard which is ice cream blended with whole Oreos (bomb!) and they also ordered the cheesy tots which were a good touch since they were warm and we were absolutely freezing.

All in all a good first experience at this location.  The service was fast and friendly.  The feel of the restaurant is neat because they bring your food out to you on skates or rolllerblades.  A must try if you are in the area.  I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.

Admit it. We&apos;ve all seen their delicious commercials all over TV, bragging about their famous Sonic Blast. So, when I stumbled upon the ever so rare (weird, right?) location in Gilroy the other day (was on the way to LA), I decided it&apos;s time to try this.

Ordered the bacon toaster cheeseburger with a side of chili cheese tater tots. And of course ... I got the Oreo Sonic Blast.

Eh. The burger was ok, nothing too out of this world. The tater tots were hard to eat - soggy and not to mention there were like five tater tots in a size MEDIUM. And the SONIC BLAST ... you killed it for me. So disappointing. The whipped cream was all over, the blend was mediocre, and our server (the drive-in and the roller blades are quite interesting, i must say) gave us the drink with ice cream spilled all over the side.

To say the least, I was disappointed. BUT, I guess I can&apos;t expect TOO much out of a fast food chain?

It&apos;s a regular stop on my way to LA or back from LA only because of its location and the eats on the 5 are either McDonalds or Taco Bell ... so I guess I&apos;d choose Sonics. It&apos;s edible and satisfying if you&apos;re hungry - I&apos;ll give you that.

Coming here right before closing (midnight)

New York style coney = amazing!!

It comes with spicy mustard, sauerkraut, and grilled onions.  The mustard can be a little over powering, so i added ketchup to tame it.

I also got a strawberry limeaid.  yum!

I felt like a stoner with the munchies, minus the actual smoking part.

After seeing Sonic commercials for years I had to try it. I think it has something to do with wanting what you can&apos;t have because there hasn&apos;t been one nearby until this location opened.

After trying it, the rest of the country can keep them.

It is an interesting concept. You pull into a parking place and there&apos;s a box just like every other fast food drive-thru. But it&apos;s your box. You don&apos;t have to give it up until you leave. That&apos;s kinda cool. The service was good enough, we placed our order, our order arrived and that&apos;s where the fun ended...

The burgers were no better than any other fast food joint but they were fall apart messy. Not exactly what you want when eating in an automobile. To top it off they gave us 3 napkins. 3 Napkins for 3 people along with messy food. Luckily we have a 4 years old that requires a glove box full of napkins. That saved us. I&apos;ll continue now. I got fries, the wife got onion rings. My fries were soggy but edible. The onion rings were disgusting. They use cinnamon or something in the batter and it does not work. Terrible. Another reviewer described it as churro like and that&apos;s spot on. Churro and onion. Terrible. I also got a hot dog because I&apos;ve heard they are quite good. The hot dog wasn&apos;t bad but it was the same thing you can get at your local Wienerschnitzel for half the price. The kids meal had quite a few choices. My daughter picked the corn dog and apples. She actually peeled the breading off of the corn dog. I&apos;ve never seen her do that. The apples we received weren&apos;t in the greatest shape. We had to toss a few before we gave them to her because they were that beat up.

We we going to try the dessert stuff but after all of that we left and more than likely will never back.

When you live in a big city for an extended period of time, you grow accustomed to it, often taking for granted the amount of places to eat in your proximity as well as being able to go to these places anytime you want to.  I lived in Las Vegas for a while and was surrounded by Sonic restaurants in all directions.  Once I moved back to Monterey County, there wasn&apos;t one in sight, including Gilroy, because it still didn&apos;t exist.  Now that there&apos;s a Sonic that&apos;s kind of close, I ensure that I go every chance I get.

I make sure that I always get the Strawberry Limeade with any combo that I get.  I like the fact that there are real strawberries in the limeade, a definite plus.   I also really enjoy their Chicken Club Toaster and Onion Rings.  All of the variations of their blasts are also very good.  I have found that aside from maybe In-N-Out Burger that Sonic probably has one of the better fast food burgers that I&apos;ve had.

There are also many ways to enjoy your food.  You can drive up to a number of their stalls, order food and have a carhop take it to you, you can sit outside or utilize the drive-thru if you&apos;re in a hurry.  Sonic is a great place to eat.

As for fast food fare, Sonic is great!

I love their limeades, especially during Happy Hour (2-4pm), drinks are 1/2 price!

I love their tater tots and I normally get the chili dog, it&apos;s kinda salty but still delicious :) I come here every time I go to Gilroy Outlets, if only they had one closer to San Jose :(

Slushies are a must!

Came here on the way home from a trip from LA.  The food is alright, but I mainly come here for the slushies.  I wish they had indoor seating, as it was a bit windy when we came here.
