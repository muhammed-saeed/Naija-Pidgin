Chan is back in cabinet
Richmond MP named Minister of State for Multiculturalism


 Martin van den Hemel, Staff Reporter 

The rosy relationship between Richmond MP Raymond Chan and Prime Minister Paul Martin appears to have paid immediate dividends for Chan, who was named Tuesday to a cabinet position along with three other B.C. MPs and one senator.

Chan was named Minister of State for Multiculturalism, joining four other politicians-Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh, Industry Minister David Emerson, Minister of Western Economic Diversification and Minister of State for Sport Stephen Owen, and Senate leader Jack Austin-on the province&apos;s largest-ever cabinet contingent.

But a Simon Fraser University professor said it&apos;s not a shoo-in that Richmond will tangibly benefit from Chan&apos;s appointment.

Professor Patrick Smith said since this isn&apos;t a &quot;steal and concrete ministry&quot;-referring to the fact that Chan landed a junior cabinet position that sits under the Heritage Ministry-there&apos;s less potential for major projects to land in Richmond simply because of Chan&apos;s influence.

Of Chan&apos;s appointment, Smith said: &quot;I think...it&apos;s the recognition that Mr. Chan is on the prime minister&apos;s radar. It&apos;s also part of the bigger picture for the prime minister that he can say this is the largest contingent of B.C. ministers.&quot;

What&apos;s more likely is that Chan&apos;s appointment bodes well for the province and region.

But Richmond&apos;s voice should be louder, he said.

&quot;Richmond should have its concerns at the table in a serious way.&quot;

If Joe Peschisolido had won the Liberal nomination and had gone on to return as MP, he wouldn&apos;t have received a cabinet position, Smith said.

Only a few hours after his appointment, Chan said he was &quot;proud to have the opportunity to serve the country again. I will try my best to promote and encourage everyone&apos;s participation into the Canadian society and make use of our diversity to make Canada stronger and more harmonious.&quot;

On Wednesday morning, Chan said he met with his B.C. counterparts and they discussed what lies ahead.

&quot;We spoke about how we can work together to advance the western agenda,&quot; he said. They want to hit the ground running and are committed to being productive and working hard toward meeting the expectations of their constituents, he said.

During a Wednesday briefing of cabinet, Chan said he was told that his new position will include responsibility for anti-racism initiatives, advancing human rights issues as well as promoting multiculturalism in general.

&quot;I will be getting a more in-depth briefing from the ministry on Thursday.&quot;

He will work under the umbrella of the Ministry of Heritage and Minister Liza Frulla.

Chan explained that the minister of state position is identical in rank to the position he held as secretary of state for Asia Pacific during his previous stint as MP prior to the federal election of 2000, when he lost to newcomer Peschisolido.

Chan said he&apos;s always been a strong supporter and promoter of multiculturalism.

Asked if his junior cabinet position will work to the benefit of Richmond, Chan said: &quot;I will have a stronger voice for Richmond, British Columbia and for the West.&quot;

Chan has been criticized for not being stern enough about human rights issues when meeting leaders from China during his previous cabinet post, which saw him promote Canadian business interests in Asia during trade missions.

Chan disagreed with the criticism, and pointed out that although he no longer participates in political protests, he does raise the issue with Chinese leaders whenever he can.

&quot;I don&apos;t have to resort to demonstrations,&quot; he said, adding that he raises these issues in a discrete yet strong fashion directly with China&apos;s leaders. &quot;They acknowledge our concern on this issue.&quot;

The Chinese government has made positive strides in the area of human rights, Chan said, noting the fact that legal aid centres have now been established throughout the country. As well, Canada arranges for annual human rights forums in China.

In his new position, Chan will earn an annual MP salary of $141,000, as well as $67,600 for being named minister of state, according to a Treasury Board of Canada web site.

Chan can now spend up to $305,000 to hire whomever he wants to work for him. These individuals, known as exempt staff, will not be considered public servants and are not subject to normal hiring practices.

For his departmental staff, Chan will have a budget of $190,000 and an annual operating budget of $200,000.
 
RONA ready for Richmond
But IKEA&apos;s Richmond expansion is on hold


 Matthew Hoekstra, Staff Reporter 

A big-box retailer is planning a massive store for north Richmond, while expansion plans of another retail giant have fallen flat.

RONA, a network of dealer-owned, franchised and corporate stores, is hoping to build a $20-million home improvement store on a vacant site in the Bridgeport area.

&quot;We are under discussions, and we are finalizing some details to begin the construction in the near future. There is no specific date at the moment,&quot; said Sylvain Morissette, RONA&apos;s director of communications.

The proposal calls for a 76,000-square-foot store between Bridgeport Road and Sea Island Way, near Sexsmith Road. The property is already zoned for the proposed use.

RONA, which operates 530 stores of various sizes and types across Canada, is in the midst of a Western expansion. A few months ago, the company announced a $200-million investment in Western provinces over the next 30 months.

According to its web site, RONA records $4 billion in annual sales.

Meanwhile, IKEA&apos;s plans to expand its Richmond store have stalled.

Two years ago, IKEA Canada representatives met with city staff to discuss plans to tear down and rebuild on the store&apos;s current site at Bridgeport and Sweden Way.

The Sweden-based company had previously acquired other properties in the area to accommodate their plans, which would require road adjustments for expected traffic jams along Bridgeport and the Knight Street interchange.

Madeline Frick, a spokesperson for IKEA Canada, said the company has yet to make a further move on its plans.

&quot;We are continuing looking at any options to expand in Richmond that are viable for IKEA but there&apos;s nothing finalized at this time.&quot;

Frick did not elaborate on reasons why the chain has halted its plans.

IKEA&apos;s Richmond store first opened at No. 3 Road near Cambie in 1976. The current Richmond site is approximately 200,000 square feet. A new store in Coquitlam, which opened in April 2002, is almost 330,000 square feet.

Richmond director of development Raul Allueva confirmed the application has been put on hold by the applicant.

&quot;We really haven&apos;t heard anything from that group. The file is still technically active, although I would say it&apos;s dead. It&apos;s just sitting around,&quot; he said.
 
Drowned baby left alone before, mom admits
Group says babies can drown in 20 seconds


 Martin van den Hemel, Staff Reporter 

Grieving family and friends are wondering if they could have done more to avert the tragic death of a one-year-old boy, who drowned in the bathtub of his family&apos;s basement suite in Shellmont on July 11.

One teenage family member says she saw little Julio playing alone in a water-filled bathtub, just a day before he drowned.

The 15-year-old told The Richmond Review she was helping Julio&apos;s mother pack for a planned move out of the basement suite.

That&apos;s when she saw little Julio alone in the washroom.

&quot;He was in the bathtub by himself with...the water running,&quot; she said.

After hearing Julio cry, Julio&apos;s mother asked her to grab a towel, and that&apos;s when she realized Julio was alone in the bathtub. The water, she said, reached his belly button.

&quot;I&apos;ve helped my mom sometimes take care of kids and my mom has told me never to leave a baby in the water like that because it&apos;s not safe for them.&quot;

That wasn&apos;t the first time that Julio was left alone in the bathtub.

Jennifer Netzlaw, a family friend, said she visited the family a few months ago and at one point asked to see Julio.

She was told he was taking a bath, and she opened the bathroom door to find Julio in the bathtub, sitting inside a specialized baby seat beside his older sister Ruth.

&quot;There he was in the tub, with the washcloth over his face.&quot;

&quot;I didn&apos;t say anything. I was shocked and surprised. I didn&apos;t think it was my place to bring it up.&quot;

Julio&apos;s mother wouldn&apos;t provide details about exactly what happened that Sunday.

But she did admit that she has left Julio alone in the bathtub before and she knows that doing that is dangerous.

&quot;Yes, that is a dangerous situation...and I could have done it like two or three times, but leaving them alone all the time, I would never do that with my kids,&quot; she said.

&quot;I believe in God and everything and I&apos;m not that type of person,&quot; she said of the allegations made by her sister-in-law Betzy Corado, who contacted The Richmond Review last week.

Corado said she and her mother contacted the Ministry of Children and Family Development many months ago because of concerns they had about the manner in which Julio was cared for. But the counsellor they spoke to requested proof of their allegations, and they didn&apos;t have any.

The ministry would not acknowledge it had spoken to the family-citing privacy laws-or whether it will be pursuing an investigation of its own.

Richmond RCMP Cpl. Dave Williams said police are investigating the bathtub drowning to see whether negligence may have been a contributing factor.

&quot;We are looking into a number of concerns raised by the family,&quot; Williams said.

Among the questions investigators will raise is what the adults were doing at the time and why the baby was left unsupervised.

In March, a 10-month-old Surrey boy died when his teenage father left him unsupervised in the bathtub. The father had gone to speak with his teenage friends who were visiting.

While baby drowning deaths are uncommon, the executive director of a society that trains lifeguards and promotes water safety said when they do occur, it takes only seconds.

Dale Miller of the B.C. and Yukon branch of the Lifesaving Society said a baby can drown in as little as 20 seconds.

&quot;It takes as long for a child to drown as it takes to answer a phone,&quot; he said.

He said children need to have continuous supervision when playing in the water.
 
Setting foot on the stage
Talent search winner lands role in Theatre Under the Stars&apos; Footloose


 Matthew Hoekstra, Staff Reporter 

Lisa Ehrlich is a 21-year-old Richmond woman who sings and dances, and who, for much of her young life, has known how to entertain.

At an early age, her element was in front of the piano, singing for family and friends.

By age 10, she was testing her vocals at a variety of music competitions. Five years later, singing became her focus.

She followed a winning performance at the Pacific National Exhibition&apos;s Shaw Star Discovery at age 19 by taking home the crown from the National Youth Talent Search in Winnipeg.

Today, Ehrlich&apos;s voice can be heard amidst the inner quiet of Stanley Park after she landed a spot in Footloose, one of two musical productions being staged by Theatre Under the Stars at the Malkin Bowl this summer.

&quot;I get a thrill from entertainment and entertaining people,&quot; she says. &quot;The fact that I&apos;m going out there and giving people entertainment and helping people have a good time is what motivates me to do what I do.

&quot;And it makes me love singing.&quot;

Not that she needs more inspiration. The musical talents of her father, local lawyer Perry Ehrlich, helped set the stage for his daughter&apos;s future in song. He currently directs a musical theatre camp, Gotta Sing! Gotta Dance! and leads a children&apos;s performance choir.

Ehrlich hopes her appearance in TUTS will lead to more musical theatre roles to supplement a new career in marketing, having graduated this year from McGill University with a commerce degree.

In Footloose, Ehrlich plays the role of Lulu Warnacker-an aunt to the lead Ren-and Irene, a country singer who belts out the solo &quot;Let&apos;s Make Believe We&apos;re in Love.&quot;

Footloose is based on the popular &apos;80s musical film which starred Kevin Bacon. The story follows the life of an independent high school boy who moves from a big city to a puritanical small town and challenges the community to bring rock &apos;n&apos; roll to the town of Bomont.

The stage adaptation, written by Dean Pitchford, features nine new songs in addition to the hits from the movie. After over two months of practising the tunes, the cast clicked for the first energized show last week.

&quot;The cast-and I&apos;ve never been in a cast like this-is like a family.&quot;

Ehrlich came to the performance prepared. She&apos;s worked with Richmond vocal coach Simon Isherwood since the age of 13 and has performed in numerous musicals and plays, including a 2001 performance as Fraulein Schneider in McGill University&apos;s production of Cabaret.

Her TUTS performance required a little work getting into character. Ehrlich prepared for her role as a 40-year-old woman by not only watching the movie, but paying close attention to the mannerisms of middle-aged women.

Opening night sparked a few pre-performance jitters, but it&apos;s what she expected.

&quot;It&apos;s good to be nervous. I believe that nerves give you energy. I think when I&apos;m nervous, it gets me a little bit excited.&quot;

So excited, clocking in for a new performance every second night doesn&apos;t feel like work.

&quot;It&apos;s something I look forward to at the end of every day. I get excited in the morning: &apos;Oh I have a show tonight.&apos;&quot;

What follows for the young star are more auditions. Tough auditions. She&apos;s learned that even a complete set of acting skills, faultless dance moves and a perfect voice never guarantee a part. But that&apos;s where a father&apos;s encouragement-and a Denver Sandwich-come in handy.

A pre-competition meal of a Denver with sliced tomatoes has preceded successful on-stage performances in the past. It&apos;s a loose ritual dad calls their &quot;lucky lunch.&quot; But right now Ehrlich is pushing aside the eggs, ham and tomatoes. She has entertaining to do.

Theatre Under the Stars runs nightly at 8 p.m. until Aug. 21. Footloose alternates evenings with Crazy For You. All shows are at Malkin Bowl in Stanley Park. For ticket information, call 604-257-0366 or see www.tuts.bc.ca.
 
Residents win lane battle
Committee recommends site be accessed by Steveston Highway


 Matthew Hoekstra, Staff Reporter 

A Shellmont neighbourhood concerned over traffic a proposed townhouse development could bring won a critical battle this week at city hall.

At a packed planning committee meeting Tuesday afternoon, area residents convinced local politicians to recommend closing the door on a future lane behind the development.

Approximately 280 area residents who signed a petition wanted access to the proposed 27-unit development restricted to Steveston Highway.

They worried a lane would bring too many cars into their neighbourhood, citing the possibility of almost 100 more units they expect will join the complex between No. 5 Road and Seaward Gate in the future.

Area resident Carol Day said the neighbourhood doesn&apos;t have a problem with the development, only the traffic a lane would bring.

&quot;That&apos;s just not acceptable to us now, it&apos;s not going to be acceptable to us in 10 years, it&apos;s not going to be acceptable to us in 20 years,&quot; Day told the committee.

Committee chair Coun. Bill McNulty told the crowd that the city was listening.

&quot;We have heard you. The process has been loud and clear.&quot;

Richmond council will vote on the development Monday
 
Workers not spared from rollback
HEU loses bid to have certain trades exempted


 Julia Caranci, Regional Reporter 

Unionized hospital workers have lost their bid to exempt some of their members from a provincial government-imposed 11 per cent wage rollback.

Bill 37 imposed a two-year contract on health care workers and contained 15 per cent in concessions, including an 11 per cent wage cut and four per cent gained from a longer work week-from 36 to 37.5 hours.

The controversial legislation was passed after job action by hospital workers reduced services to essential levels in late April. Since then, the Hospital Employees&apos; Union has been pressing to exempt certain workers from the rollback-including licenced practical nurses, ECG and cardio technicians, power engineers, and tradespeople such as plumbers, electricians and carpenters.

However, this week arbitrator James Dorsey rejected the union&apos;s request.

HEU spokesperson Mike Old said union officials fear a looming recruiting and retention crisis if the workers are forced to accept lower wages.

Many may leave their jobs, either for better paid positions in the private sector or health care jobs in other provinces, he added.

However, the union acknowledges there have been no mass resignations in the above-named trades to date.

The HEU plans to continue seeking the exemptions through other legal avenues, Old said.

nThe B.C. Nurses Union has donated $5,000 to assist the Hospital Employees&apos; Union in paying a hefty fine resulting from recent job action.

The union was found in contempt of court by a B.C. Supreme Court judge last month for contravening a back-to-work order and staging an illegal strike from April 30 to May 3.

The union was fined $150,000, which it will donate to six hospital foundations.
 
Swans to be swept away
Mute swans pose conservation problem, but some want them to stay


 Matthew Hoekstra, Staff Reporter 

A few feathered regulars of Fisherman&apos;s Wharf will be whisked away from Steveston by mid-August.

Wildlife officials plan to capture mute swans and their young in Steveston Harbour within the next six weeks as part of an effort to protect indigenous birds.

Mute swans escaped from captivity years ago and have since established wild populations that pose a conservation problem in the Lower Mainland, including Steveston. Officials say the swans are aggressive, territorial and threaten local birds, fish and habitats.

The swans interact with many human visitors in Steveston, often swimming up to the Steveston docks.

Pajo&apos;s Fish and Chips manager Tia Litz said customers usually react positively to the great white birds: &quot;Especially the kids, they love seeing the swans down here.&quot;

Steveston resident Anne Carson said she saw the swans nesting by the dock of Britannia Shipyard last year. She objects to their removal from the harbour.

&quot;I don&apos;t see what harm they were doing,&quot; she said. &quot;They seem to get along very well with any other wildlife that was around. They kept the Canada Geese at bay.&quot;

Last September, a pair of breeding mute swans and four cygnets were captured in Steveston. The male and the young were relocated to a lake near Grouse Mountain. The female was moved elsewhere.

Carson said even though the birds aren&apos;t indigenous to Canada, they&apos;ve been in North America for 200 years and now draw tourists to Steveston.

&quot;In this area they&apos;ve had six groups of cygnets in the last seven years, so I&apos;d say they&apos;ve adapted pretty well,&quot; she said.

But Bob Elner of the Canadian Wildlife Service, one of two government agencies leading the effort, said the mute swans are a threat to local species and must be removed to avoid overpopulation problems.

&quot;We want to try and nip this in the bud in B.C. before it gets to the levels it&apos;s got in the U.S. and Ontario.&quot;

Elner said he doesn&apos;t know of any incidents in Steveston where the swans have been aggressive toward humans, but he said the larger goal of removing the birds is conservation.

&quot;I know people can get quite attached to individual wildlife but there&apos;s a greater problem here in terms of the potential of these swans...to really overwhelm natural species and destroy natural habitat.&quot;

Elner said the swans have also hybridized with trumpeter swans on Vancouver island, posing a problem since trumpeters are migratory and mutes are not.

Elner estimated the mute swan population in Steveston at six.

&quot;We don&apos;t know where they&apos;ve come from. We&apos;ll have a better idea when we collect them and see if they are banded.&quot;

Last summer a small population of mute swans in Ladner were banded by wildlife officials. The float home community there reached an agreement with Canadian Wildlife Service in 2002 to keep some swans in the community.

Bruce Strahl, a float home owner who wants to see the swans stay in Ladner, said there&apos;s a good chance some of the Ladner birds moved to Steveston after being forced from their nest by the male.

&quot;Steveston&apos;s just such an obvious next choice for a young swan that gets kicked out of home,&quot; he said.
 
Growing pains at Aberdeen

 Martin van den Hemel, Staff Reporter 

With fewer than half of Aberdeen Centres stores open, and whispers about a change in direction regarding a proposed hotel, not all appears as resplendent as the architecture at Richmonds newest $100 million mall.

More than half a year after its initial opening, only 80 of the anticipated 200-plus stores are actually open for business. Many of those seem to be cut from the same retail cloth, flogging either cellular phones, health-related items like herbal medicines and vitamins, or jewelry. Then theres the multitude of Asian restaurants and the half-filled top-floor food fair.

On the outside, the mall bears no similarity to the old Aberdeen Centre.

But inside, initial tourist impressions suggest it hasnt shaken its reputation as anAsian Malldespite promises that it would cater to more mainstream shopperssomething its predecessor was sharply criticized for failing to do. (Aberdeen Centre was at the centre of controversy during the mid 1990s when complaints surfaced of Asian-only signs in the malls stores.)

Many stores have Asian names or Asian characters above their entrances, sell distinctly Asian goods, and the clientele, shop owners and workers appear to be almost exclusively Asian, save for a handful of non-Asian security guards.

If anything, the mall has more of a full-bodied Asian aroma, rather than just Chinese, with a Malaysian restaurant, a two-storey Japanese anchor tenant and a 14,000 square-foot, soon-to-open Korean department store.

Helen Smythe, a former Richmond resident who now lives in White Rock, brought some out-of-town friends to the mall recently for a bite to eat.

I think its a beautiful place.

But when it was pointed out that many signs were in one Asian language or another, her friend Brian Saunders said:Youd think theyd put a little English on them.

And she agreed:I think that they should have English too.

Connie from Wisconsin said her first impression after walking into the mall from the multi-level parkade was that it wasvery Asian.

However she said there were things thatcertainly were not Asianand shewouldnt call it an Asian mallif itgets in more establishments that are multi-ethnic.

One area that has changed noticeably is the shopkeepers The Richmond Review spoke to were courteous and spoke fluent English.

The empty storefronts and silent, brightly-lit hallways in some parts of the mall were facts that didnt go unnoticed by shoppers or tenants.


Slow start


Marilyn Suen, manager of BMW Lifestyle, said the first few months have beena little bit disappointing.

BMW Lifestyle was one of just a handful of stores ready for customers during the December opening, which was flashy, thanks to a multi-million dollar fountain, but there was a glaring absence of retail product. The prominently-placed jewelry store at the malls main entrance had employees standing at attention when it opened, but not a single diamond ring or gold watch was on display.

I was hoping for more actual department stores,Suen said.

But the malls restaurants have been bringing in a lot of customers, she noted. And so far shes seen a good cross section of shoppers, a mix of Asian and non-Asian.

Suen said shes heard rumours about the hotels demise and is worried about what that will mean in the long term for her shop and the mall in general.

The malls ownership has applied to the City of Richmond to build a 119-unit nine-storey condominium tower instead of the hotel.

Suen feels the residential condo tower will translate into more people fighting to get into and out of the area by car, simply adding to an already congested area in the bustling Asian commercial district east of Cambie and No. 3 Road.

Tourists staying at a hotel might have walked or used other forms of transportation, she said, like transit or taxi. Unlike a condo, with its relatively stable ownership, the hotel would have regularly brought in new tourists each year.

It would have been better with a hotel. A new state-of-the-art mall should have a new hotel.

Shes also been disappointed that parts of the mall remain empty and that some shops were closing early and opening late.


Strong leadership


Is the malls slow start an omen of things to come?

Peter Gibson, a mall expert with Royal LePage, doesnt think so.

Aberdeen Centre is on solid footing, Gibson said, noting that the malls ownership is extremely strong financially.

According to Gibson, mall owner and billionaire Thomas Fung, the owner of Fairchild Developments who puzzled many by razing the earlier version of the mall, was wise to tailor his mall toward the Asian market.

That whole strip down there has a heavy concentration of Asian people living in that area. If thats the demographic that habituates in a specific area, thats what you want to cater to. Unless you do that, you wont be successful.

In contrast, the struggling Tinseltown complex in downtown Vancouver was built ahead of its time in a location where the demographic didnt suit the retail uses, he said.

Even in an area replete with Asian malls, from Yaohan Centre and Parker Place to President Plaza just across the road, Gibson said Aberdeens future appears bright.

Because hes built the Cadillac on the block, theres going to be people outside the area that will drive to it.

The $100 million facility, at nearly 400,000 square feet, is also large enough to be a destination-oriented centre.

Hes probably built the most exclusive centre in there, in terms of being high end. I think because of the demographics in the area, the centre should perform well in the long term.

While some stretches of the wide-open mall are barren of customers and shops, Aberdeen Centre general manager Danny Leung said during a walk-through that nearly 90 per cent of the mall space has been leased. He anticipates most shops will open by the years end and blamed some of the delay on a lack of skilled labour and the malls lofty interior design standards.

The reason the mall is so empty is because of the boom in construction. All my tenants are having difficulty getting subtrades and materials.

Leung confirmed that the mall is leaning away from building an adjoining hotel but denied that financial pressures or a glut of local hotel rooms has anything to do with it.

Rather, its the extremely high demand for condos currently, in tandem with the red hot real estate market in the Lower Mainland, that has prompted the change of heart.

Its strictly a business decision,Leung said. Theres a lot of demand from people who want to live beside a mall because of the community space it offers, he said.

I think for the long haul, the hotel would have been just as good.

However hotel consultant Angus Wilkinson, president of Tyne Hospitality Services Ltd., questioned the impetus for the change.

He said building another hotel right now wouldnt have been a wise financial decision.

Securing financing from a bank to build a hotel in Richmond would be hard enough in todays market. In addition, theyd likely have to wait years to recoup that initial multi-million dollar investment at a time when hotel room occupancy isnt nearly as high as in Richmonds hey-days in the late 1990s, when local occupancy rates rivaled Las Vegas.

A condominium project, on the other hand, would pay for itself with pre-sales alone, he said.


Real difference


Leung disagreed with the contention that Aberdeen Centre has only changed cosmetically.

I dont think this is Asian. I think this is international.

He noted that Mondo Gelato, an Italian ice cream store on Robson street, was scheduled to open soon.

Theres also a Pharmasave store, a Broadway Camera outlet, and the coffee franchise Starbucks is opening one of its largest Lower Mainland stores, at 1,350 square feet, this September.

While the mall isnt as full as he would like to see it, he said the demand to lease space is high from many well established companies.

If the mall wanted to, all of its space could already have been leased.

Leung, however, said that Mr. Fung wants only the best retailers in his mall to give it a distinctive flavour the likes of which the Lower Mainland hasnt seen before.

The Ten Fu Tea and Ginseng Store, which has more than 400 locations in China, has chosen to open its first store outside of China at Aberdeen.

Owner Ron Steinke said business has been great at OSIM, a healthy lifestyle products store that sells, among other things, water purifiers, blood monitors and first-rate massage chairs, said.

Betty Lee, owner of the Japanese two-dollar store Daiso, said her store is performing steadily better and the Aberdeen Centre location is the top overseas Daiso store.

Were still number one. Our sales have improved because other stores are opening.

Science World is slated to open up a couple of exhibits in the mall by the end of July, as well as a 1,000-square-foot classroom which will offer workshops for children on the malls second floor.
 
City takes aim at standing water on private property
Stagnant ponds are breeding grounds for mosquitoes


 Matthew Hoekstra, Staff Reporter 

Richmond is considering a bylaw that would force property owners to clean up standing water or have the city to do it for them.

The community safety committee is recommending council adopt the bylaw to aid in the battle against West Nile virus.

&quot;We&apos;re not trying to go out and penalize anybody,&quot; said Suzanne Bycraft, manager of emergency and environmental programs for the city.

&quot;We&apos;re trying to raise awareness and help them with some strategies for what they can do to help not breed mosquitoes so that we can help combat West Nile.&quot;

The proposed bylaw allows Richmond Health Services to order all private property owners with standing outdoor water-including homeowners with stagnant backyard ponds and farmers-to clean it up.

If a property owner doesn&apos;t act, the bylaw authorizes the medical health officer to do whatever is necessary to eliminate the problem-and bill the property owner.

The charge would be tacked on the next tax bill if unpaid.

Bycraft noted some other Lower Mainland municipalities have already adopted similar mosquito control bylaws. She said the proposed bylaw isn&apos;t meant to be onerous, as there&apos;s often a simple solution to a problem of standing water.

Committee chair Coun. Linda Barnes said the bylaw primarily targets property owners with unkempt yards.

Health authorities expect the mosquito-bourne West Nile virus to arrive in B.C. this year, but so far it hasn&apos;t.

In April, Richmond council approved a proposal for Richmond Health Services to launch a larviciding program and a catch basin study on city property to combat the potential spread of the virus.

According to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, 40 birds have been tested for the virus in Richmond this year. All results have been negative.

West Nile virus can cause severe illness in seniors and those with suppressed immune systems, but for most people, the risk is low. Some infected people don&apos;t even get symptoms; a small number will get a headache or minor flu-like symptoms.

West Nile virus is transmitted by two main mosquito species (B.C. has about 50 known species) that have fed on the blood of infected birds-mostly crows, jays magpies, ravens and other corvids, which die from the virus. It&apos;s spread blood-to-blood.

The virus originated in Africa and has since spread across North America.

Top city bureaucrat&apos;s expenses top six figures
Relocation costs balloon chief administrative officer George Duncan&apos;s expenses to $112,049


 Matthew Hoekstra, Staff Reporter 

Richmond&apos;s top bureaucrat earned $130,508 and claimed $112,049 in expenses in 2003, according to financial records released this week.

George Duncan returned to his full-time position as chief administrative officer in August after spending a year working for the City of London in Ontario.

As part of Duncan&apos;s expenses, taxpayers spent $71,500 in relocation costs, including moving, real estate, tax and legal fees. A further $15,000 covered travel and accommodations for his family during a three-month search for a new home.

Taking time off from his London job in the spring, Duncan worked part-time for Richmond to help assemble the city&apos;s financial plan. Travel costs between the two cities totalled $10,700.

Other expenses included $13,378 for city business-including travel to Ottawa and Victoria-and $1,172 in discretionary expenses, such as lunches and conference fees.

Duncan said his expenses aren&apos;t typical, but are the result of council&apos;s national search for capable leadership.

&quot;I was very interested in being back because the year&apos;s break gave me some insight into how much more we could do and achieve in Richmond. And I loved it here.&quot;

Duncan has played key roles in major city projects since his return, including the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver rapid transit line and negotiations to acquire the Garden City lands.

The federal government had planned to transfer the lands to Richmond, but a court injunction by the Musqueam Nation blocked the deal. Duncan has since led negotiations between the parties, which are moving closer to a memorandum of understanding.

&quot;I believe it is promising, and it&apos;s certainly moving in the right direction. We&apos;re certainly light years ahead of where we&apos;ve ever been in the past 30 years in trying to get those lands,&quot; Duncan said.

Duncan is also leading Richmond&apos;s bid for the speed skating oval of the 2010 Winter Games.

Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie said Duncan&apos;s relocation expenses were high, but necessary, since he was selected from a national competition. A bonus for Richmond was Duncan&apos;s intimate knowledge of Richmond issues, Brodie said.

&quot;The big projects that we have on the go now...it was very important that he be completely up to speed so we could address those challenges.&quot;

Richmond would have had to foot the same bill of expenses, regardless of who it hired, Brodie said.

&quot;He was the best candidate in our minds,&quot; he said. &quot;He hit the ground running.&quot;

Coun. Bill McNulty, who last year was the only councillor to vote against bringing Duncan back, said since the majority of council agreed to bring Duncan back, the expense was necessary.

&quot;That&apos;s part of doing business and recruitment,&quot; he said. &quot;If you want somebody you have to provide them, otherwise they&apos;re not going to come out and look at a home on their own expense.&quot;

In 2002, Duncan, who only worked part of the year, claimed significantly less in expenses, totalling $9,797. That year he earned $271,955, which included a large payout of unused vacation and banked overtime accumulated over almost 17 years at city hall.

In 2001, he claimed $14,704 in expenses.

Duncan started as chief administrative officer in 1997. He has held other positions at the hall, including head of engineering and public works and director of civic properties.

Other general managers&apos; earnings and expenses in 2003 were: James Bruce (finance and corporate services, now retired), $170,919 earnings, $1,295 expenses; Cathy Volkering Carlile (parks, recreation and cultural services), $155,913 earnings, $3,625 expenses; Jeff Day (engineering and public works), $165,207 earnings, $139 expenses; Joe Erceg (urban development), $105,402 earnings, $215 expenses; Chuck Gale (community safety, now retired), $166,713 earnings, $8,973 expenses; Michael Kirk (human resources), $157,196 earnings, $597 expenses; David McLellan (urban development, left the city in August), $331,733 earnings, $7,978 expenses.
 
Customs seizes child porn
Pilot charged after landing at airport


 Martin van den Hemel, Staff Reporter 

A bush pilot from Saskatchewan has been charged after customs officers at the Vancouver International Airport seized compact discs and DVDs with sexually explicit covers that appeared to include young children.

Derek K. Simkins, 34, was charged in Richmond provincial court this week with transmitting or distributing child pornography, and with possessing child pornography.

He would not comment on the allegations.

He was nabbed Sunday after a six-week trip to Asia which included a stay in Yangon, the capital city of Myanmar.

Canada Customs spokesperson Faith St. John said during an initial examination, his responses were inconsistent and he was referred to a secondary exam.

While looking through his baggage and laptop computer, a customs officer found compact discs and DVDs with sexually explicit covers that included children, specifically young women, she said.

The discs and laptop were detained for a closer look and the RCMP was eventually called in.

Richmond RCMP Cpl. Peter Thiessen said the discs &quot;appear to contain sexually explicit material involving very young children.&quot;

Investigators suspect Simkins intended to distribute the pornography.

Simkins is a pilot who works for Kenn Borek Air Ltd., which provides air transportation to remote parts of Western Canada including B.C., Alberta, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.

Reached at her home in Turtleford, Saskatchewan, Ruth Simkins, grandmother of Derek, couldn&apos;t believe the allegations.

&quot;I can hardly believe it,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s not that type from my perspective.&quot;

Derek is the father of a three-year-old girl and has a common-law wife, Ruth Simkins said.

He went to school in Yellowknife where he managed a fast-food restaurant, she said.

He often flies abroad, serving as a pilot for oil companies ferrying workers to and from remote oil fields in places like Burma and Thailand.

These countries have a reputation for sexually exploiting children for the sex tourist trade, according to police.

Derek Simkins is next scheduled to appear in Richmond provincial court on Aug. 17 for an arraignment hearing.
 
Fired Cara employee pleads guilty

 Martin van den Hemel, Staff Reporter 

An attempted murder charge will likely be dropped against a former Cara Operations employee who tried to run over his boss after being fired in February.

Wilfredo Ayalde, 53, pled guilty this week to assault with a weapon and making death threats and will be sentenced on Sept. 23 in Richmond provincial court after a pre-sentencing report is completed.

Ayalde was fired in February from his job at Cara Operations Limited on Sea Island and he didn&apos;t take the news well.

He got into his vehicle and tried numerous times to run over one of his supervisors in front of witnesses.

Richmond RCMP were called and Ayalde was taken into custody. There were no serious injuries.

Although the attempted murder charge has not yet been stayed, that will likely happen after his sentencing in September.
 
Apartment residents worry about fire hazard
Owners say buildings are not built to fire code


 Martin van den Hemel, Staff Reporter 

If you believe the owners, the five remaining Minoru Gardens apartment buildings on Minoru Boulevard across from Richmond Centre are a fire hazard.

The City of Richmond, on the other hand, disagrees.

For renter Christiana Cousins, who has lived in the building since 1998, she isn&apos;t sure who to believe.

But based on a lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court, the owners of the buildings-which includes four sequentially ordered numbered companies from 410727 to 410730 B.C. Ltd. as well as Minoru Investments Ltd.- are convinced the building doesn&apos;t meet fire safety standards.

The owners sought damages against the City of Richmond and Dayhu Investments Ltd., the construction firm who built the complex in 1968, for a 2002 fire, which destroyed one of the apartments. The blaze was touched off by a plumber who was making repairs.

&quot;The plaintiffs alleged (Dayhu) failed to exercise reasonable care, skill, diligence and competence in failing to specify a sprinkler system and certain fire walls, fire stops and fire resistant materials required by the British Columbia Building Code.&quot;

In its claim against the city, the owners alleged the city&apos;s inspector had breached his duties in permitting the construction &quot;when he knew...that the design and construction deficiencies constituted a fire hazard.&quot;

Those allegations don&apos;t leave Cousins feeling comforted.

&quot;It&apos;s definitely a fire trap,&quot; Cousins said this week.

What&apos;s worse, Cousins lives in a unit that shares a common wall with the building&apos;s coin-operated laundry.

&quot;There&apos;s nothing right now that I can do.&quot;

Cousins feels the city should step in and do something about the building, given the owners&apos; concerns. At the same time the owners should feel obliged to do the same for the safety of the tenants.

However, City of Richmond spokesperson Ted Townsend said the city feels the building has been built to the building code, and as such isn&apos;t planning to step in.

&quot;The city&apos;s position is that those buildings were in compliance with the building code at the time that they were built. So there wouldn&apos;t be any reason for us to take any action at this point.&quot;

Tony Feng said he believes the building&apos;s owners should do something to address the concerns that they&apos;ve raised.

&quot;I&apos;m worried about it,&quot; said Feng, who has lived there for about a year.

Another young couple agrees and feels the city should step in and tell the owners to do something.

&quot;Of course we&apos;re worried.&quot;

Whether the building really is a fire hazard won&apos;t truly be known until perhaps the next fire.

That&apos;s because the B.C. Court of Appeal dismissed the lawsuit because it was commenced after the 30-year statute of limitations had run out.

The court did not rule on the claim itself, however.

Lawyer Eric Dolden said his clients live overseas and he doesn&apos;t know whether they have plans to retrofit the building.

He said he was only hired to pursue this one particular angle of the lawsuit.
 
Cooking up a healthy storm
Catering firm&apos;s menu goes light on the calories and fats, and heavy on flavours


 Philip Raphael, Staff Reporter 

The corporate lunch or dinner buffet, long the bastion of zesty, high-calorie, high-fat delights, all waiting patiently atop steam-venting warming trays, are a thing of the past for a Richmond catering company which is stressing a healthier line of cuisine instead.

&quot;We&apos;re not nutritionists or dieticians per se. Rather we provide food that has been cooked in a healthy way,&quot; explains chef Stanley Coelho who started his business called The Healthy Chef in 1999 after a lengthy career in many top flight hotel dining rooms in India, the Middle East, and finally Vancouver, where he emigrated to in 1993.

&quot;It&apos;s our goal to serve food made from the best, freshest ingredients, that look and taste fabulous. And that means using the basics of cooking, and not over-processed stuff. The best foods are those that are kept in the most natural state possible.&quot;

To limit the number of calories and high cholesterol content in their foods, Coelho explains The Healthy Chef menu relies on a lot of grilled or oven roasted meals. And they also stay away from traditional recipes that call for entrees mired in heavy cream sauce, or cloaked in crispy batter.

&quot;My kitchen has no cream,&quot; he says. &quot;We have only two per cent milk, and use very little butter.&quot;

And a growing list of clients are catching on to the fact that a meal being catered in for a special event can indeed meet their dietary needs.

&quot;We get the odd group who want to have fries with their sandwiches, but we have to say no,&quot; Coelho says, pointing to the absence of a deep fryer in the neatly arranged kitchen in East Richmond that is a hive of activity with trays of colourful wraps and sandwiches whizzing by, ready for packaging and delivery in time for lunch.

An average weekday sees staff turn out between seven or eight corporate luncheons which can feed as few as 10 or as many as 70 people.

And on most weekends the kitchen is busy preparing meals for private parties and wedding receptions.

In addition to no deep frying, The Healthy Chef stays away from offering classic deli sandwiches that can contain high levels of sodium and nitrates.

&quot;We tend to do more of the grilled chicken and turkey or roasted sirloin sandwiches.&quot;

Some of the most-ordered sandwiches are roasted turkey with cranberry chutney, and grilled chicken with prosciutto and basil pesto sauce.

So, how did this idea of healthy cooking for clients come about?

It started when Coelho&apos;s wife was pregnant with their first child and she was trying to find healthy food alternatives. When there were few to be found, The Healthy Chef menu was born.

&quot;The name of the business could have been anything, The Good-Looking Chef, or whatever. But The Healthy Chef is what the food was all about,&quot; he says.

The trick, he explains, is to have clients leave their meal not thinking they have had to sacrifice taste for the sake of fewer calories.

While a health conscious-menu may seem to be conducive to the current low-carb, Atkins-crazed dieter of today, Coelho said he is not one to follow eating trends, and prefers to rely on common-sense alternatives.

&quot;For example, we used to stuff everything when I was working in the hotels-chickens, turkeys, you name it. Now, I&apos;d rather serve stuffing as a garnish to the meal.&quot;

But when it comes to some desserts, there are still some of the high calorie desserts normally found at the end of a buffet line. Yes, cheesecake, and assorted pies are still there. But Coelho says he suggests willpower, through restrained portion sizes, as a solution.

In addition to the catering side of the business, which makes up the vast majority of the clientele, Coelho has a small retail arm that sells sandwiches, wraps and other goods right from a tidy storefront operation at its Bathgate Way location between 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Coelho explains that he has not patterned his cooking style after any single chef he has worked with, but rather picks certain aspects and expertise from a collection, and then adds those attributes to his own skill set.

Coelho started in the culinary trade after enrolling in a hotel management course in his native India. While the program covered all aspects of the business-front counter staff to kitchen workers-Coelho opted to focus on the cooking side.

&quot;You can always get rid of the restaurant manager, but the chef you cannot,&quot; he says philosophically.

He also recalls some sage advice from his brother when he started his studies at hotel school.

&quot;He told me that this was not like school anymore. It was a career and that I couldn&apos;t afford to be at the back of the pack. I had to be at the top. And I&apos;ve struggled all my career to make sure that I was the best I could be.&quot;

After finishing school Coelho went to work in the number of top notch hotel kitchens in the Bombay (now known as Mumbai) area, and worked his way up to be chef of Executive Club at the renowned Taj Bombay, regarded as one of the world&apos;s top 20 hotels.

&quot;And the Executive Club only allowed very important business leaders membership,&quot; Coelho explains. &quot;And in Asia, people with power are usually very demanding, much more so than those in Europe and North America.

&quot;So, when I was told, &apos;Hey Stanley, we need some Creole food right away,&apos; I had to be able to come up with something Creole in say 15 minutes. It made you pretty resourceful.&quot;
 
Mayor backs bill against aggressive panhandlers
Safe Streets Act targets squeegee kids


 Matthew Hoekstra, Staff Reporter 

Richmond&apos;s mayor believes the city should support proposed provincial legislation that targets aggressive behaviour on the streets.

Although the problem in Richmond is slight compared to other cities, Mayor Malcolm Brodie believes street-level harassment could build with city growth and a new rapid transit line.

&quot;I believe that the problem of aggressive behaviour in our streets and in public premises is an escalating problem. I think it&apos;s at a fairly low level in Richmond compared to Vancouver, but it does exist,&quot; he said.

Vancouver-Burrard MLA Lorne Mayencourt is seeking support from local government for the Safe Streets Act and the Trespass to Property Act, two private member&apos;s bills introduced in the provincial legislature earlier this year.

The legislation targets aggressive solicitation-such as squeegee kids and zealous panhandlers-and unsafe disposal of dangerous paraphernalia, including condoms, needles and broken glass.

It would also make it an offence if a person doesn&apos;t leave when a business owner or building manager asks.

Coun. Linda Barnes opposes the legislation. Although supportive of arming police with another tool for public safety, she said the focus should first be on finding a solution to problems such as homelessness, poverty and mental illness.

&quot;Those kind of issues are more at the root of the issue, as opposed to not having the correct law to fine these people.&quot;

Barnes noted Richmond also lacks some of the problems Vancouver has.

&quot;We&apos;re also not experiencing the issue, not to say that down the road we won&apos;t be or couldn&apos;t be,&quot; she said.

But Brodie said aggressive behaviour in Vancouver can mar visits to the city. He said police should be given new enforcement tools while the root causes of the problems are dealt with.

Council will consider the legislation later this month.
 
Death of infant prompts investigation
Boy, 1, drowned in bathtub


 Martin van den Hemel, Staff Reporter 

Richmond RCMP are investigating the death of a baby boy, who drowned in a bathtub Sunday, just two days after celebrating his first birthday.

Julio Corado Pasquier died Sunday morning despite the best efforts of fire crews and ambulance paramedics who arrived at the Williams Road basement suite in which he lived with his parents.

Betsy Corado, Julio&apos;s aunt, told The Richmond Review she heard someone slamming on her door around 9:30 a.m. Sunday and learned that Julio had drowned.

Firefighters who were the first to respond tried to resuscitate him for what seemed like 30 minutes but were unsuccessful, she said.

She said she saw Julio on the living room floor, that he was all blue and completely naked.

He was then taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Richmond RCMP Cpl. Peter Thiessen said police are investigating the incident to see whether any crime, including negligence, may have resulted in his death.

A number of police investigators, including both uniform and serious crime unit officers, are tasked to this case, Thiessen said.

The B.C. Coroners Service is also investigating the case, with coroner Stephen Fonseca looking after this particular file.

Betsy said she and her mother had raised some concerns about the manner in which Julio was cared for some time back. They called the Ministry for Children and Family Development about nine months ago, and spoke to the district supervisor for Richmond Family Services. But they came away from that meeting disappointed because they lacked any proof of their allegations.

Now they are wondering whether Julio&apos;s tragic death could have been prevented with some provincial intervention.

Kate Thompson, spokesperson for the Ministry for Children and Family Development, said privacy laws prohibit her from disclosing any information about this case.

She couldn&apos;t confirm that the family had contacted one of the ministry&apos;s officers, or if that visit resulted in any direct follow up. She also couldn&apos;t say whether the ministry had any contact with the families involved at all.

Speaking in general terms, Thompson said any report of concern about a child is investigated. But she said not every report results in a child being taken into custody.

&quot;They should be contacting the ministry if there&apos;s any follow up,&quot; Thompson said of the family&apos;s concerns.

Asked whether the ministry would investigate this type of incident, Thompson said that depends on the specific circumstances.

Julio&apos;s funeral was held Friday.
 
TransLink to vote on sending staff on LRT fact-finding trip to Europe
But chair says he won&apos;t go


 Julia Caranci, Regional Reporter 

A proposed $60,000 trip to Europe for up to five TransLink board members and several staff to view modern rail systems is a bad idea, said chair Doug McCallum Friday.

&quot;I won&apos;t be going on it and I don&apos;t agree with the staff recommendation-I think it&apos;s completely unnecessary,&quot; he said. &quot;I am going to be recommending to the board that only one director and one staff be allowed to go-they can bring all the information back and distribute it.

&quot;There are new international communication techniques with video capabilities that could be used instead of spending $60,000 to send that many directors and staff to Europe.&quot;

TransLink staff are recommending up to five board members and mayors, along with two community members and as many as four TransLink staff, travel to Caen, Lyon and Strasbourg in France and Croydon, England in September to study existing rail systems before making a choice on what technology will be used in constructing the Northeast sector line.

The Northeast sector rapid transit project will cost up to $800 million and will connect Coquitlam Centre to the existing Millennium SkyTrain line. The route and technology for the project have yet to be determined.

Given the significant capital investment involved, it would be valuable for representatives from the affected municipalities to inspect light rail transit, or LRT, systems already in use in Europe, TransLink spokesperson Ken Hardie said Thursday.

Hardie said many residents, especially in Port Moody, have expressed a preference for LRT over SkyTrain.

LRT systems operate primarily over public streets, segregated from other traffic. The trains run faster than traditional street cars.

Hardie said hills may be an issue for this type of technology and using an LRT system may require at least one long tunnel to be built, increasing the potential cost of the project.

However, new technology called guided light rapid transit-in use in France‚ is essentially light rail but the cars run on rubber tires and can climb hills that otherwise may require a tunnel.

Using this new technology could save hundreds of millions on the final cost of the project, Hardie said. But it&apos;s relatively new technology and TransLink must be sure the system can do the job it will be required to do.

The trip to Europe will allow staff to view both LRT and guided LRT systems already in use.

Hardie said TransLink directors Jon Kingsbury, Derek Corrigan and Port Moody Mayor Joe Trasolini may go on the trip, along with several staff and at least one community member.

He estimates the trip will take five or six days and take place over the Labour Day weekend in September.

TransLink will pay for the trip out of the budget for the Northeast sector project, Hardie said.

&quot;There&apos;s only so much you can get from conference calls and visits to web sites,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes you have to go out and kick the tires-ride up and down a hill.&quot;

But McCallum said he will only support the trip if a minimal number of directors and staff are involved.

&quot;When we&apos;re dealing with taxpayers&apos; money we have to be very understanding that we can&apos;t spend this kind of money going on a trip when one director can do it just as well.&quot;

TransLink&apos;s board will vote on whether to approve the trip at Wednesday&apos;s open board meeting.

Decisions on the route and technology for the Northeast line will be made in September.
 
SPCA says pets should get their rabies shots

 Julia Caranci, Regional Reporter 

The B.C. SPCA is strongly advising pet owners to have their dogs and cats vaccinated against rabies-a potentially fatal disease that has become active in the Lower Mainland.

While the cases thus far have been limited to four infected skunks in Stanley Park, B.C. SPCA chief animal health officer Dr. Jamie Lawson said all pet owners in Greater Vancouver should be certain their dogs and cats have updated rabies vaccinations-particularly if their pets go outdoors.

&quot;The trouble with rabies is once you show signs it&apos;s 100 per cent fatal. I think there&apos;s literally one or two people in the medical literature who have survived this disease.&quot;

Rabies is a viral disease of mammals-including humans-usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, although it can be transmitted in other ways.

The virus is present in all body secretions of an infected animal. The simple act of an infected dog licking a child&apos;s face when the child has a cut can introduce rabies, said Lawson. Saliva entering into the eye can also pass the disease on.

According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the vast majority of cases occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes. Domestic animals account for less than 10 per cent of the reported rabies cases, with cats, cattle and dogs most often affected.

Rabies infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy (a degenerative disorder of the brain) and ultimately death.
 
AirCare may be scaled back

 Julia Caranci, Regional Reporter 

AirCare could soon be significantly scaled back, Translink and the regional district have hinted—with the big bonus coming for owners of new vehicles, which could be exempt from the emission-testing program.

&quot;The perception—and certainly it&apos;s a true perception—is that a lot of newer cars have got proper emission controls in them now,&quot; Tanslink chair and Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum said. &quot;There&apos;s no real need for AirCare in some of the newer models.&quot;

He added vehicles have had more sophisticated emission controls since about 1996.

&quot;The manufacturers have done a good job with their cars. We don&apos;t want to test them if they&apos;re never failing.&quot;

The current AirCare contract expires Aug. 31, 2006, and McCallum has previously suggested that date may mark a sunset clause for the program.

A major independent review of the AirCare is currently under way and should be complete by fall. McCallum said Translink will make a decision on the program&apos;s future by the end of the year.

&quot;As we head into the end of the contract in 2006, we need to have a look at it and see what type of cars still need to go through and look at some type of scale-back.&quot;

A report released this week revealed the Greater Vancouver Regional District may also support extended new model exemptions.

A GVRD staff review determined excess emissions are substantially higher in vehicle models previous to 2000. &quot;A seven-year exemption in mandatory AirCare testing may therefore be appropriate,&quot; concluded the review.
