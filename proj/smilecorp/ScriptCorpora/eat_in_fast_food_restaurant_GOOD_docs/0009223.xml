 Niggah, please. 
Posted on 02/14/2010 at 10:50 AM
For Valentine&apos;s Day, I offer you a little candy heart. A piece on language from Lenny Bruce, as portrayed by the actor Dustin Hoffman in the movie &quot;Lenny.&quot; You can find this clip on YouTube if you are so inclined.
 Are there any niggers here tonight? Can you turn on the house lights, and could the waiters and waitresses just stop serving for a second? And turn off the spot. Now what did he say? &apos;&apos;Are there any niggers here tonight?&apos;&apos; There&apos;s one nigger here. l see him back there working. Let&apos;s see. There&apos;s two niggers. And between those two niggers sits a kike. And there&apos;s another kike.That&apos;s two kikes and three niggers. And there&apos;s a spic, right? Hm? There&apos;s another spic. Ooh, there&apos;s a wop. There&apos;s a Polack. And then, oh, a couple of greaseballs. There&apos;s three lace-curtain lrish Micks. (getting in the face of a large black man in the front row, who glares stoically) And there&apos;s one hip, thick, hunky, funky boogie. Boogie, boogie. Mm-mm. l got three kikes. Do l hear five kikes? l got five kikes. Do l hear six spics? Six spics. Do l hear seven niggers? l got seven niggers. Sold American! l&apos;ll pass with seven niggers, six spics, five Micks, four kikes, three guineas, and one wop. (to the black man in the front row) You almost punched me out, didn&apos;t ya? l was trying to make a point, that it&apos;s the suppression of the word that gives it the power, the violence, the viciousness. Dig. lf President Kennedy would just go on television and say &apos;&apos;l&apos;d like to introduce you to all the niggers in my cabinet.&apos;&apos; And if he&apos;d just say &apos;&apos;nigger, nigger&apos;&apos; to every nigger he saw, &apos;&apos;Boogie, boogie, boogie, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,&apos;&apos; till it didn&apos;t mean anything any more! Then you&apos;d never be able to make a black kid cry because somebody called him a nigger in school. 
Did Lenny get it right? In the 1950&apos;s, when segregation and Jim Crow laws were still prevalent, he probably did. However, today, we have experienced what Lenny talked about. The &quot;N&quot; word (so vile that we dare not speak it&apos;s name) has become workaday, commonplace, and no black kid comes home from school crying because someone called him a nigger. Because someone probably did, and it was most likely another black kid. And it doesn&apos;t mean anything in that context. Now if I, as a white man, used the word, I might get a few seconds grace as my intent was decoded, but for the most part, it is not allowed. And it shouldn&apos;t be allowed. The &quot;N&quot; word is a sword in the hands of a white person for which the black person has no equivalent. I&apos;m Italian, but if a black man called me &quot;wop,&quot; I would feel nothing.....that pejorative has it&apos;s roots in an immigrant situation of over 100 years ago. The same goes for &quot;Dago,&quot; or any other slur. In fact, the worst thing you can call a white man of any extraction is &quot;racist,&quot; which conjures a profile of low breeding and lack of education.
The NAACP (an anachronism in itself...blacks have rejected the label &quot;colored&quot; generations ago) held a funeral for the &quot;N&quot; word a few years ago, in an attempt to discontinue it&apos;s use by blacks. By and large, the funeral was a failure, because we continue to hear blacks desecrate the corpse in everyday conversation. Does that mean the &quot;N&quot; word is a ghost, risen from the dead? And if it is a ghost, is it fair to call it a spook?
Ouch.
And dropping the final &quot;r&quot; is no tonic, either. Proclaiming to someone &quot;that&apos;s my niggah right there&quot; is only a bastardized (white) attempt at using the word without saying it (or sayin&apos; it), and it is false in it&apos;s conception and in it&apos;s usage. You cannot have your cake and eat it too, chocolate or otherwise.
One thing is for sure, the word is never going to go away. It is part and parcel of a situation that exists in American society, one that declares that what whites want from black people and what blacks want from white people are two different things; whites want blacks to assimilate (talk like us, dress like us, live like us) and blacks want whites to get out of the way (give us our own culture, our own style, our own slang, our own ways). It is uncomfortable when a white person uses black slang or adopts a black style, because it is seen as stealing (and it is). We chide these people as &quot;wiggers&quot; (white niggers) and their company is enjoyed by neither whites nor blacks because they are offensive on two fronts; to whites, they refuse to assimilate and to blacks they refuse to get out of the way. Eminem managed to cross the cultural barrier, (but only with Dre&apos; holding his hand and helping him navigate the stormy waters) while Kid Rock did not, and instead became embraced by lower-class, disenfranchised white kids from the cornfields of Iowa (where such culture must be adopted because surely no reasonable substitute exists).
Richard Pryor famously visited Africa and was asked &quot;Do you see any Niggers here?&quot; (the unspoken answer being &quot;no&quot;), and the reason the answer was no was because they did not have the sense of wretchedness present in the black underclass of America (now largely joined by poor, uneducated whites in large numbers). I have no cure for this condition. Until we find a way to raise everyone up, in education, economic status, and human dignity, we will continue to hear the &quot;N&quot; word, and every funeral, mispronunciation, or hip, comic treatment won&apos;t do us a bit of good.

 Merry Christmas 
Posted on 12/25/2009 at 01:40 PM
I wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy new year, just as I have done for years. This year, unlike those in the past, finds my mind filled with questions and my heart filled with uncertainty.
The arguments against Christmas are fairly common, and you&apos;ve probably heard them before; the discussion of Christ&apos;s birth not occurring in December and the celebration being held in the winter to coincide with a pagan celebration as not to get early Christians into hot water; the argument against the crass commercialism of the holiday, the drive to spend more, the hectic pace of the holiday and the entire month that precedes it.
I&apos;ve been brought to question the entire holiday in a crisis of faith; I discovered this year the parallels between the life of Jesus Christ and the Egyptian god Osiris. Osiris, otherwise known as &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; was a savior god who died and was resurrected, was born of a virgin, was baptized by a man who was later beheaded, and was betrayed by a close confidant. When I was young, I was always sceptical about religion and later came to trust in Jesus Christ, and now I&apos;m growing sceptical again. If Christ is nothing more than a construct, cobbled together using elements of Egyptian mythology, then my religion is based on a lie and my faith is unfounded. If Christ is really the Messiah and his tale has been embellished by men, then I question their purposes for the deception and don&apos;t know what exactly to believe. Christmas, then, falls under the microscope and becomes suspect either way.
I would happily follow a false religion, or a true religion that was &quot;beefed up&quot; with pagan lore, so long as that religion helped me live a just life, be kind to my fellow man and do no harm. In that case, I would welcome the deception. The one factor that keeps me hanging on is that the divinity of Jesus Christ is so widespread and has been so strong throughout history that I find it hard to believe that so many were successfully misled, but the parallels to the Osiris myth (that predates Christ) are hard to ignore. It is difficult, to say the least, to swallow the idea that it is simply a coincidence.
I dealt with this crisis of confidence for about six months, and then December 7th came and it was time to put up the tree. So, then, I decorated my house this year and put up our Christmas tree, largely for the enjoyment of our five-year-old, Harmony. I explained that the giving of gifts to children on Christmas was a tradition to remind us of the gifts that the Magi brought baby Jesus, but she didn&apos;t entirely understand it; she just knows that Santa Claus has eight reindeer, nine if you count Rudolph, and that the front porch was pretty with the multi-colored lights, but that we needed some reindeer or a snowman or Santa Claus (maybe next year...I cut down two trees in order to decorate the porch this year).
A screening of A Christmas Carol starring Patrick Stewart the other night also brought pause; the tale by Victorian author Charles Dickens addressed the ills of his time. Dickens was commenting on the poverty caused by the industrial age and the subsequent harsh treatment of the poor in England. Using the formula of the day, Dickens identified a social problem (the mistreatment of the poor by the wealthy and powerful), symbolized that problem with one character (Ebeneezer Scrooge), caused that character to go through trials (the visitation by the three ghosts representing memory, empathy and fear of death), and finally to undergo a conversion (purchasing a Christmas goose for the Cratchit family, raising Bob&apos;s wages and becoming a &quot;second father&quot; to Tiny Tim.
This brought pause because it is the first time I have ever seen a production of A Christmas Carol and fully understood the message; this is not the author&apos;s depiction of the conversion of one man, but an attempt to cause society, his society, to look upon itself and correct what he perceived to be their grave mistakes. That is what I wish to do. There are too many in this country that feel that we all must &quot;go it alone,&quot; that government, which represents the common will and common desires, is intrusive and oppressive rather than supportive of our collective well-being. We spend on guns without thinking but weigh the price of butter, we trumpet personal responsibility but whimper in defense of the weakest among us. We wish each other Merry Christmas without much thought as to how likely that is to the recipient of our well-wishes and in the absence of that likelihood what we could do to insure it or provide it.
We need to change that, and fast. We need to be lovers of men and not profit, fearful of ignorance and want, celebrants of our families and our communities and our children. We need true joy, whether it come from the deep abiding faith in a messiah, born in a manger two thousand years ago, or in the smile on the face of a child who looks up to us and trusts us to maintain the spirit of generosity and protection, or to allow ourselves to soak in the presence of our fellow man, tipping his hat and wishing &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; and knowing that Peace on Earth is something that resides in all of our hearts.

 The Miracle (Queen) 
Posted on 11/09/2009 at 11:13 PM
Well now.
Thanks for checking in. I always appreciate anyone who reads me, particularly these days when there&apos;s so many other things going on; war, economy, health care, angst, rhetoric, reality TV shows, sports, etc, etc, etc.
I&apos;m a comedian, but when I blog, it&apos;s never funny. I intentionally write it straight, for the purposes of having a journal that my daughter (or anyone who cares) can someday peruse to see what it was like being me. It&apos;s a tool to capture the essence of my day-to-day life, working as a professional entertainer.
Well, last time around, I talked about some medical issues I had with my kidneys. I was scheduled for a CAT scan and was waiting for the insurance company to give the thumbs-up.
Instead, they stuck the thumb in my eye.
The rejection letter read, in part; &quot;Based on CareCore medical necessity criteria for 72912-CAT Scan of hips without dye: the history provided of a 42 year old male with recent worsening kidney function does not demonstrate sufficient medical necessity to justify certification of the examination at this time. There is no evidence of flank pain, blood in the urine or other clinical findings or conditions indicating the requested study.&quot;
I was given the right to appeal, but basically my doctor was told to move forward with my treatment without the opportunity to fully diagnose my condition. The thing I was never able to completely understand was the statement that there was no evidence of blood in the urine, when that is the condition that prompted my nephrologist to order the test in the first place.
I was angry when I got word that I was rejected. I&apos;m sure a lot of that was fear, but it came out as anger. For a few weeks, I worried that I might have cancer, kidney failure that would lead to dialysis, or who knows what else. The cancer situation is one that we talk about quite frequently in comedy. These days, a lot of clubs are smoke-free, but when you&apos;re an old war-horse like me, you&apos;ve spent many a night in a comedy club that looked like London when the fog rolled in. Cancer is starting to make its presence known in quite a few comedians, and we&apos;ve already lost a few.
My nephrologist decided to go forward with blood cultures. I provided all the blood they asked for, about 11 tubes, and a urine sample. I had to go back once because they merged two of the samples, one had to be kept warm and the other kept cool, and they put &apos;em together. On Thursday, I saw my regular doctor, and he prompted me to make a call to the nephrologist. I did, and received some wonderful news.
My nephrologist&apos;s assistant told me that the blood was gone from my urine. The bacteria had disappeared, too.
While I was down in Texas and Oklahoma the week before, I had some chest congestion that turned out to be a minor strep infection. Due to the fragile nature of my kidneys, it was manifesting as blood in my urine (bacteria, too, but you couldn&apos;t see it). I took three days that I had off to rest in a hotel room, drinking water, cranberry juice, taking zinc (I&apos;m not allowed anything stronger) and staying warm, which wasn&apos;t difficult. I was able to kick the disease, with only a few remnants by the time I got home.
Last Thursday, I was getting ready to perform at Danny Liberto&apos;s open mic at Dewey&apos;s, and my nephrologist called me....this was almost 9 o&apos;clock at night. He confirmed what his assistant told me, and added that my case was not at all typical. In his words, a strep infection severe enough to cause blood to appear in my urine should not have been so quickly dismissed by my body at my age; a clearing-up of infections of this type are typical only in pediatric cases. He went on to say that in medicine, you certainly don&apos;t want to be interesting; you&apos;re in much better shape to be an average, run-of-the-mill type case. It&apos;s easier to be diagnosed and treated.
Still, if I was to be atypical, I&apos;m glad I wound up on this side of the coin rather than contracting some sort of kidney-based Ebola virus that no one had ever seen before.
I joked a little with the doctor, pointing out that comedians usually live into their 80&apos;s, 90&apos;s and more and that measured on that scale, I am about adolescent in my development. Whether or not that had anything to do with me getting over this brief health scare is questionable, but at least I&apos;m out of the woods, assuming that a CAT Scan wouldn&apos;t have revealed any latent illness that is just waiting to come and claim me somewhere down the line.
The lessons to be learned here seem to be 1) Drink water and cranberry juice, 2) Worry is the misuse of imagination, and 3) There is something terribly wrong when an insurance agent who is supposed to be facilitating health care is allowed to come between a doctor and his patient.
I went and delivered another round of blood samples today, as my nephrologist wants to keep monitoring me for any change (oh, and by the way, the last time around, my declining kidney values actually went up, which was nothing short of amazing to me) and I have another appointment next week with my primary health care physician. This week, it&apos;s off to Maine, where I have a couple of standup comedy performances scheduled at two of the University of Maine campuses.
Thanks to everyone who checked in on me along the way. I appreciate you all.

 Somebody Get Me A Doctor (Van Halen) 
Posted on 10/27/2009 at 12:04 AM
I&apos;m not dead. Not yet, anyway.
According to my primary blog home at http://ralphtettascomedyroadtrip.blogspot.com/, I haven&apos;t written since August 3rd of this year. That&apos;s o.k. with me, I guess, because I&apos;ve been busy, and not much has prompted me to want to share. Even now, I&apos;m only writing out of guilt and that I feel I owe it to myself to put something down in print, just to get it out of my head.
I&apos;m not a healthy person. And by that, I mean physically healthy. Where I&apos;m at mentally and spiritually is a good place, I think. I&apos;ve picked up some solid coping skills and I like who I am much more than the person I was ten years ago. I&apos;m not a hot-head, I don&apos;t scare as easily, and I try to consider the other person&apos;s situation before I judge them too harshly. In my opinion, I&apos;m doing pretty good for myself from a mental health standpoint.
Physically, I need some work.
I could list off the maladies, and all the usual suspects would be there, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea; but the worst one is diabetes. I&apos;m a type-II candidate, which means &quot;adult onset.&quot; My pancreas doesn&apos;t make enough insulin to keep my blood sugar at a manageable level. I take oral medication in lieu of insulin injections, and that&apos;s fine with me; they work like a charm.
Unfortunately, diabetes has led to a loss of kidney function. I&apos;d been seeing a nephrologist and we saw my kidney values decreasing as time went on, but this last Friday I went in and we discovered that I have some blood in my urine. I&apos;m no doctor, but even I knew that wasn&apos;t good. A week or so ago I was on the road, and noticed my urine had gotten very dark, like the color of A-1 steak sauce, and then lightened up. I was out of blood pressure medicine and was waiting to get back home to get my prescription filled, so that may have had something to do with it, but my nephrologist ordered a CAT scan for me for this week, just to make sure I didn&apos;t have a blockage or anything.
The only thing we&apos;re waiting for right now is for insurance to give the o.k. for the CAT scan. An insurance company has gotten between me and my doctor. Not the government; an insurance company.
I don&apos;t know how you feel about health care reform, but I&apos;ve pretty much made up my mind.
I&apos;ll keep you posted as my condition is diagnosed and treated.

 Eat It (&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic) 
Posted on 08/03/2009 at 07:38 AM
Life is what happens when you&apos;re making other plans.
When last I wrote, other than bitching about Blue Oyster Cult (NO caffeine before bed! NO caffeine before bed! NO caffeine before bed!), I was updating everyone on the goings-on in the life of me, Ralph Tetta, Mr. Big-Shot Comedian.
Our family picnic came off *almost* as planned, with mom driving up from Florida with her friend Robert. Only problem was that when she got here, she had a heart attack. It was a minor one, but a heart attack just the same, and she missed the picnic and spent the week at Rochester General Hospital. After five bypass surgeries, she&apos;s resting and recuperating at an assisted living facility, and she&apos;ll be heading back to Florida in a week or so. The bum deal is that she also missed the Donroe family reunion, as her father (my grandfather) was one of eight children, so we have dozens of cousins that we&apos;d never met before.
My brother Christopher and his family made the trip in from Syracuse to attend the picnic, and then got to go see mom in the hospital, so she had no shortage of visitors. Pamela sent me an e-mail after the fact about the statistics regarding the picnic, which made me laugh a little bit because I have a live album from a British band called Saxon and in the liner notes, they go through their live tour that the album was recorded on and talk about how many guitar strings they went through, how many tea bags (because they&apos;re British, y&apos;see) and it smacked of that. For the record, we had 39 guests, went through almost a whole case of burgers (40), a case of hot dogs (32), two pounds of Italian sausage (thanks Tim!), five 2-litre bottles of soda, 2 gallons of iced tea, various chips, dips, and dishes-to-pass including a veggie tray, bean salad, fruit salad, excellent chili, mac salad, potato and broccoli salad, two kinds of cake (none left over of either....go figure) and after it was all over, we donated 2 cases of leftover, unopened hot dogs and the associated hot dog rolls to the Open Door Mission....we bought too much, but Pam had coupons.
Sunday night was my third of three shows at D&apos;Youville College in Buffalo, and Ray drove along with me. On the way, we stopped off at Chef Mike Kolady&apos;s house to drop off my sound system for a performance at his 45th birthday party (Happy Birthday Mike!) by Rochester comics Joe Fico and Pat Duffy. I would have liked to have performed, but was already committed to the college show. We dropped off the sound system, and while I was getting things ready, checking levels and all that, Ray was getting himself some of Chef&apos;s fine barbecue, and fine it was. Ray got a big &quot;to-go&quot; plate of ribs, chicken, various salads, and we snagged two Diet Pepsi&apos;s with lime for the trip. I didn&apos;t eat, because I know I would have been wearing barbecue sauce by the time I got to Buffalo. I had to wrestle with the mic stand because the clip lost it&apos;s screw, and we jury-rigged a replacement by putting a bent roofing nail through it. Not the prettiest repair job in the world, but it worked.
The gig was a good one, an orientation show for new students, and even though it was the smallest of the three groups, it was the most lively and the kids really got into it and enjoyed themselves, which is the essence of the live game show. If the kids don&apos;t want to play, there&apos;s nothing I can do to make the show a success other than throw money into the crowd.
After the show, I delivered some flowers and cannolis to some of Pamela&apos;s friends who had been in a car accident earlier in the month, and it was very late, between midnight and 1 AM, and after getting the &quot;get well&quot; presents at a Wegman&apos;s that was open all night, we rolled the van down Pamela&apos;s friends&apos; street, looking for the right house number in the pitch black. Finally, I got fed up at my night-blindness and hung the plastic shopping bag on the door of the house I thought was the correct one, figuring that if it wasn&apos;t correct, they would enjoy the flowers and cannolis anyway (it turned out to be the right one).
Ray and I got back into town by 2 A.M., and had to make our way back to Mike&apos;s to pick up my sound system. The gear was out in Mike&apos;s shed, and his back yard was pitch black. Mike was still up, and shooting pool with some friends, and while I was fumbling my way around in the dark trying to find the gear, Mike was helping Ray light a tiki torch so that we&apos;d have some light. I somehow found the mic stand by waving my arm around in front of me, and then moved up the stand to find the mic, and then followed the cord down to the amplifier. Once I got the cord wound properly, it was a piece of cake to find the bag that the mic and cords went in, and start my way back up Mike&apos;s steeply graded back yard. While all this was going on, Ray was getting the tiki torch and then moving towards me, forgetting that the yard had a very steep slope. He slid down the wet grass, landed in the ashes of what had been a fire pit earlier in the evening, and the tiki torch went out. All I saw from my vantage point was the light of the tiki bobbing as Ray walked, and then flashing quickly to the ground before being extinguished, followed by Ray&apos;s cursing and spitting. As I had gotten back too late to enjoy any of the barbecue, we then made our way to Jay&apos;s Diner for some late night food, and I ate my cheeseburger plate with a tired satisfaction. At least I didn&apos;t have jury duty the next day.
Yeah, that&apos;s right, I pulled jury duty as I seem to do every three years, and had put my service off until July. They originally were asking for my service in May, but my contractually-obligated college tour wouldn&apos;t allow it. My number was ridiculously high (945), and I checked the website dutifully each evening to see if I was required to attend, but the numbers never got higher than the 500&apos;s. I had scheduled a show on the Friday, figuring that I wouldn&apos;t be called, and by Thursday night, I had been released from my jury duty obligations. I guess the trick was getting the duty postponed, because they put me at the end of the new list, which is the same as not being called at all. I think I may have found a loophole in the system for use at a later date; not that I don&apos;t want to do my civic duty and serve on a jury, but I have a job that requires me to travel and more than that, be able to schedule months out in advance. If I&apos;m on a jury that goes three weeks, there&apos;s no way I could predict something like that without an awful lot of notice.
So on Friday morning, Ray piled into the car with me and off we headed to the Wit&apos;s End club located in the Ramada Inn and Conference Center in Morgantown, West Virginia. We had an easy drive down, fueled by Sheetz Made-To-Order sandwiches, satellite radio, and conversation courtesy of over 20 years of friendship. I can&apos;t remember when I laughed so much. We got into Morgantown, checked into the room, and then headed back out so that I could get a haircut....I was due. After a nap, I shaved and showered and we headed down to the club and I introduced Ray to Larry Nelson, the host of the long-running comedy night. I couldn&apos;t coerce Ray into doing a guest spot, but Larry did, and Ray did great. My feature act, Washington D.C.&apos;s Clay Miles, did a great job of revving the 40 or so people up for my act, and I went balls-out and did my thing. The weirdest point of the night was when a West Virginia state trooper appeared in the doorway of the lounge, suddenly silencing the crowd, which consisted of 36 white redneck bikers, and four black people. And don&apos;t forget the loud-mouthed guinea on the stage! Come to find out, he was looking for a gentleman (and I use the term loosely) who had battered his female companion after an evening of imbibing in the hotel bar, then trashed his first-floor hotel room and snuck out a side door.
The next morning, I grabbed breakfast down in the restaurant (best hot complimentary breakfast buffet in the business!) and trotted over to Wal-Mart to fetch watermelons and ice. We were planning on attending the Natarelli&apos;s (Steve and Eileen) Redneck Luau on Saturday night, and Pam committed me to bringing vodka-infused watermelon. I told her about the technique, but I never tried it before and she thought it sounded like great fun. It isn&apos;t great fun, by the way. It&apos;s a lot more fun to eat than it is to create. I had brought a big cooler with me in my trunk, and purchased a knife at the Dollar Store and vanilla-flavored vodka at a liquor store on Friday. I dumped 20 lbs of ice and two seedless watermelons into the big cooler, cut a hole in one of the melons, and turned the bottle of vodka upside-down and shoved it into the hole. Long story short, it works, but you have to keep turning the bottle so the vodka can work it&apos;s way into the melon. I kept the other melon clean, for the kids and anyone else who just wanted melon but no booze.
We drove back to Rochester, and coming through Buffalo in the home stretch, the skies grew dark and it started to hail and rain. It was real wrath-of-God stuff, and large men with big pickup trucks were pulling their vehicles over underneath bridges to escape the weather. Meanwhile, I&apos;m slooshing along in the water and ice in my Toyota Camry, a Japanese roller-skate careening down the I-90. I got home, dropped Ray off at home, changed clothes, picked up Pam and Harmony, and off we headed to the Natarelli&apos;s. It was a fine day, and unfortunately we missed some of the earlier festivities, but the food was good, the watermelon went over pretty well, and we got to see a water-spout courtesy of the lakeside view of Steve&apos;s back porch. Another part of our indoor fun included watching the weather report on TV to decide if my house was still standing.
The next week was a whole bunch of nothing, and it was planned that way months ago, deciding to take some family time and enjoy my family and some nice outdoor activities. Well, up here in Rochester, it&apos;s been constant piss-rain all summer, so none of that was happening. Thursday night, I made my way out to Chet Wild&apos;s Open-Mic-A-Palooza, a showcase at the Comedy Club that wound up featuring 30 comedians. You heard me right....the show went three and half hours. I went on at the end, after spending some time around the corner with my mom, showing her pictures on the internet of the family reunion we both missed. I don&apos;t know how the remaining folks stuck around for the last comic (me) after over three hours of show, but they did.
Friday, I had a gig out at the Cedar House in Skaneateles, NY, with special guests Ray Salah and Travis Worth. After picking up some replacement parts for my sound system (that sometimes seems to get more work than I do), we headed out. I replaced the roofing-nail clip with a new one courtesy of the Guitar Outlet (four bucks, not bad) and purchased a new, longer cord for the mic. Come to find out, the cord was incompatible, but I had back-ups, so it didn&apos;t kill the show. What *did* kill the show was the first sunny day in Upstate New York this year, and we drew far fewer folks than we did the last time I was there. The show was fun, and I sold some CD&apos;s after the show. We would have stuck around, but there was literally no one in the place, not even bowling, so we headed back to Rochester, stopping off at a Buffalo Wild Wings for some food because I hadn&apos;t eaten all day. Just a word of caution....the mango habanero wings are HOT, and they mean it. Get the double bleu cheese if you know what&apos;s good for you, or skip the middle man entirely and just drink the liquid out of your car battery.
Saturday was a day of rest and recuperation, and then last night, I performed with Rochester&apos;s Dan Viola at a private party fundraiser for the Webster (high school) Warriors football team. I seemed to have remembered the words &quot;clean show&quot; being uttered when I was booked months ago, and I double-checked that with Joe at the club, and he said (quote) &quot;Nah, you can do what you want. I came here on purpose to see Dark Ralph.&quot;
Now, Dark Ralph is my doppelganger, my other persona. Sometimes, I get tired of being Mr. Jolly Pants, and I let my inhibitions go and I wind up saying some pretty outrageous stuff. And I&apos;m proud to say that I let Dark Ralph off the leash last night, but not so much that he bit anyone, just so that he could eat a little bit. I used some coarse language, and some overt topicality, but wasn&apos;t even as raw as I usually am. I was definitely not *clean*.
I did an hour after Danny&apos;s set, and the crowd seemed to have really enjoyed themselves, and I worked material in with some crowd work, and after the show, I got a really solid ovation, and made my way back to the sound booth. Mark, the house manager, shook my hand and said &quot;You know, this was supposed to be a clean show, right?&quot; and all the color drained out of my face. I guess they stopped counting f-bombs at around 85, which may have been exaggerated for comic effect, but is probably in the right neighborhood. I definitely left at least a dozen in a plastic bag on somebody&apos;s front door handle.
The folks shook my hand afterward, including the lady who was paying the club the money, and I apologized because I didn&apos;t know the parameters, and she said that it was fine and that the group really liked me. I wouldn&apos;t have had a problem working clean, I do it all the time, but I was working off of faulty intelligence. Still, the client had no problem, so I went home with my head held high, if not a little red in the cheeks.
This week, I start my August session of comedy classes at the Comedy Club, and I&apos;m looking forward to a new batch of students along with some of the folks from the June session looking to brush up their skills. The game show tour starts up again on August 16th in Huntsville, Alabama, so I&apos;ll have plenty to do along with my teaching schedule.
The opposite of burn out is rust out. I&apos;ve done &apos;em both, and given my choice, I&apos;ll take the burn.

 Dr. Music (Blue Oyster Cult) 
Posted on 07/17/2009 at 04:20 AM
You know how I figure out if someone I&apos;ve just met, like at a cocktail party or something, is worth talking to or not? I ask them their favorite Blue Oyster Cult song. Based on the answer, I&apos;ll decide how to treat them. There are several levels, like the rings of hell in Dante&apos;s &quot;Inferno.&quot;
If someone mentions &quot;Harvester of Eyes,&quot; &quot;Astronomy,&quot; &quot;E.T.I.&quot; or something cool like that, we&apos;re going drinking. Unkle Roger, dearly departed disc jockey from WCMF, loved &quot;E.T.I.&quot; and that made him a cool motherfucker in my book and I hope they find the person responsible for his death because a cool guy like Unk shouldn&apos;t go out like that.
The next ring would be songs like &quot;Godzilla&quot; or &quot;Cities On Flame.&quot; These are deep cuts, but still get enough radio airplay that they&apos;re considered fairly common. A mention of these will still get you into the brotherhood, and I&apos;ll talk as long as you want.
The next layer is &quot;Don&apos;t Fear The Reaper&quot; or &quot;Burnin&apos; For You.&quot; These are the most common Blue Oyster Cult songs and they don&apos;t require any special fan appreciation to pooch out. As a matter of fact, if these are the only song titles the person can produce, I usually write them off at that point as a walking waste, either too young to know any better or too lame to matter. I won&apos;t be more inconsiderate to them than I would a stranger on a bus who wants to talk about the weather, but basically, we&apos;re in the same neighborhood.
Almost to the bottom of the rings, there&apos;s the response &quot;I don&apos;t have a favorite song&quot; or &quot;Who is Blue Oyster Cult?&quot; or worse yet, &quot;I don&apos;t like them.&quot; The truth of this is that Blue Oyster Cult was always a group that required a little imagination to like; they weren&apos;t singing about love and relationships, and when they did, it was something dark like a suicide pact or a sado-masochistic sexual affair. To admit that you don&apos;t like them or didn&apos;t take enough time to get familiar with the material basically is an admission that you&apos;re a second class person, more concerned with style over substance, and you&apos;re part of the problem (and by that, I mean *all* the problems....teenage pregnancy, overcrowding in our cities, hunger in the third world, gang violence, the poisoning of our food supply by contamination, and the prospect that the Earth will be struck by a huge meteor). I&apos;m sorry, even if you think you&apos;re innocent, you&apos;re not, and if you&apos;re not willing to take the blame, then it&apos;s my civic duty to hang that shit around your neck. For Christ&apos;s sake, just get one of the live albums and work your way through it. It&apos;s not that hard, and you&apos;ll be a better person for it.
The bottom ring is reserved for folks whose only exposure to BOC is that sketch that Will Ferrell and Christopher Walken did on Saturday Night Live where they talk about needing more cowbell. If you&apos;re a young punk and that&apos;s all you&apos;ve got, I blame it on your parents. They obviously didn&apos;t love you very much, or realized that you were &quot;special needs&quot; and couldn&apos;t handle anything more. That&apos;s a shame, but not everyone gets the nurturing that they deserve.
Will Ferrell is a putz. If you think he&apos;s funny, you can&apos;t name a Blue Oyster Cult song. You need to draw yourself a bath, plug in a toaster and drop that motherfucker right in the water. You&apos;ll be doing us all a favor. Actually, if there&apos;s any way you can get Ferrell to take a bath with a toaster, that might earn you some points, but you&apos;ll still have to learn a song or two.
Now, you&apos;re reading my blog, so I automatically think you&apos;re a decent person, but you still have to do the work. If for some reason you never got savvy to Blue Oyster Cult, I&apos;ll help you along. You can probably look these songs up on YouTube or download them to your iPod or if you&apos;re really interested in being a top-notch human being, you can buy the old albums or CD&apos;s and listen to them at home. But here&apos;s a good list to start with.
From their debut, &quot;Blue Oyster Cult&quot; listen to &quot;Transmaniacon MC,&quot; &quot;Stairway To The Stars,&quot; &quot;She&apos;s as Beautiful As a Foot,&quot; &quot;Cities On Flame with Rock and Roll,&quot; or &quot;Workshop of the Telescopes.&quot;
From &quot;Tyranny and Mutation,&quot; try &quot;O.D&apos;d on Life Itself&quot; or &quot;Hot Rails To Hell.&quot;
&quot;Secret Treaties&quot; yields &quot;Career of Evil,&quot; &quot;Dominance and Submission,&quot; &quot;ME 262,&quot; &quot;Harvester of Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Astronomy.&quot;
&quot;Agents of Fortune&quot; features &quot;This Ain&apos;t The Summer of Love,&quot; &quot;(Don&apos;t Fear) The Reaper,&quot; and &quot;E.T.I. (Extra Terrestrial Intelligence).&quot;
From the &quot;Spectres&quot; l.p., check out &quot;Godzilla,&quot; &quot;R.U. Ready 2 Rock&quot; (doing the initials thing before Prince ever did!) and &quot;Goin&apos; Through The Motions&quot; (featuring Ian Hunter!)
The &quot;Mirrors&quot; album is excellent, and you&apos;ll enjoy &quot;I Am The Storm&quot; and &quot;In Thee.&quot;
The phenomenally titled &quot;Cultosaurus Erectus&quot; has the fine tracks &quot;Black Blade,&quot; &quot;The Marshall Plan&quot; and &quot;Lips In The Hills.&quot;
&quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot; is the album you may be the most familiar with, with the hit song &quot;Burnin&apos; For You,&quot; but also &quot;Veteran of the Psychic Wars&quot; from the Heavy Metal movie soundtrack album.
&quot;The Revolution By Night&quot; is amazing, and you can enjoy the songs &quot;Take Me Away,&quot; &quot;Shooting Shark&quot; (featuring bass guitar work by American Idol&apos;s Randy Jackson), &quot;Veins&quot; and &quot;Let Go.&quot;
&quot;Club Ninja&quot; has a pair of Bob Halligan songs (he&apos;s a famous songwriter for many cool bands such as Judas Priest, Helix and others) &quot;Make Rock Not War&quot; and &quot;Beat &apos;Em Up&quot; but you may also enjoy &quot;Dancin&apos; In The Ruins&quot; and &quot;White Flags.&quot; You might also enjoy &quot;Perfect Water.&quot;
&quot;Imaginos&quot; needs to be listened to all the way through, but if you&apos;re gonna cherry-pick the songs, how about &quot;I Am The One You Warned Me Of,&quot; &quot;In The Presence of Another World,&quot; &quot;Del Rio&apos;s Song,&quot; &quot;Astronomy&quot; (they re-did the song) and &quot;Blue Oyster Cult.&quot; This was also the last album to feature Albert and Joe Bouchard.
&quot;Heaven Forbid&quot; was their reunion album, and features many great songs including &quot;See You In Black,&quot; &quot;Harvest Moon,&quot; &quot;X-Ray Eyes,&quot; &quot;Live For Me,&quot; and an acoustic rendering of &quot;In Thee.&quot;
And their last studio album, released in 2001, &quot;Curse of the Hidden Mirror&quot; features the songs &quot;Pocket&quot; and &quot;Here Comes That Feeling.&quot;
And like I said before, any of the live albums are good, and they usually put one out every three or four albums, to connotate a change in style or direction.
So go on, enjoy some good music and listen to the lyrics because there&apos;s a lot of good stuff going on in there. If you&apos;re more of a pop music person, and you like singles and you listen to music but don&apos;t really listen to the words, then you&apos;re doing your brain the same disservice you&apos;d be doing your body if you ate ice cream all the time and never ate any vegetables.
And I&apos;ll never, ever tell you which category my wife falls into....there&apos;s a marriage at stake here. But I&apos;ve tried to start righting some wrongs and I&apos;ve played a few CD&apos;s in the car when I&apos;ve taken Harmony to school, and she seems receptive. Good habits begin when we&apos;re young.....

 Cat Scratch Fever (Ted Nugent) 
Posted on 07/14/2009 at 07:31 AM
Good morning, North America, and anyone else who cares to read. Rather than get a good night&apos;s sleep, I decided to toss and turn and keep flipping the pillow to the &quot;cool&quot; side, and finally, I&apos;ve just said &quot;fuck it&quot; and thought I would blog....it&apos;s been a couple of weeks, and I&apos;ve been piss-poor about keeping in touch.
Stuff on the comedy front&apos;s been few and far between, and by design, as I thought I would spend the Summer doing family stuff and spending time with Pammey and Harmony. We&apos;ve mostly done that, but the weather around here has been decidedly un-summer-like. We&apos;ve always kept cool by installing two window unit air conditioners on either side of the apartment, but this year, we&apos;ve only run them once....for the most part, the outdoor temperature has run only into the low 70&apos;s, and at night, we&apos;re down into the low 50&apos;s. I&apos;m not complaining because we&apos;re saving a ton of money on our electric bill, but little things are being affected. I usually take advantage of the warm weather to hang clothing on the clothesline out in the backyard, but we really haven&apos;t had any days that were hot (or dry) enough to pull that off. Also, you can&apos;t really mow your grass when it&apos;s wet, and it&apos;s been perpetually wet out there. My backyard looks like a jungle! I planted some pepper seeds earlier in the year and I was worried that I wouldn&apos;t be around to water them enough, but they&apos;ve gotten plenty of water, now I&apos;m worried about the sunlight!
If I had things to keep me busy, I guess I wouldn&apos;t be so down on the weather, but it&apos;s been a lot of &quot;sit around and wait&quot; around here. I did a &quot;Dash For Dollars&quot; gameshow date at D&apos;Youville College in Buffalo last week, and I have another one Wednesday night and a third one this coming Sunday night as part of D&apos;Youville&apos;s freshman orientation. The Incredible Cash Cube had a small stress fracture to be taken care of, and as luck would have it, there is a welding shop right around the corner from my house....walking distance, actually. They got the piece back into shape, and then my comedy buddy Ray Salah&apos;s father helped me replace some missing fasteners with his 50+ year collection of screws and bolts. The D&apos;Youville folks were awesome and it&apos;s a great performance space...I&apos;m looking forward to the next two shows, knowing that it&apos;s a good situation.
I did a standup date at a club called Dubland Underground on July 4th weekend. I was concerned that the club wouldn&apos;t draw very well, but they actually had a good group down in the basement club. I shared the stage with Rochester comedians Paris, Joe Cumbo, Katie Wood, Billy T. Anglin and Dan Maslyn. I didn&apos;t know how long of a show I was going to do, what with it being a very young crowd, but they hung out with me for 45 minutes or more and I had a good time with it. This past weekend, I was supposed to do a comedy train in Vermont with Steve &quot;The Nuclear Guy,&quot; but reservations were thin and they pulled the plug on the show. I was sad to see the shows not come off, but after 20 years in this business, I understand that no Summer gig is completely secure.
So with no work for the weekend, I attended two weekend gatherings, on Saturday, a birthday party for our friends Maria and Billy Griffin&apos;s son Aidan who was turning 9, and on Sunday, a birthday party for our friend Mike Visconte who was turning 60. Saturday&apos;s party was enjoyable, and even though I was upset about the loss of work, I decided not to be a grouch about it, and I kept to myself until folks coaxed me out of my shell. The star attraction of the cookout, in my opinion, was Billy&apos;s food, where he put his restaurant experience to good use and rustled up some top-notch grub. His burgers were so thick, you could&apos;ve chocked the wheels of a 747 with &apos;em. And they were incredibly juicy; they didn&apos;t need one condiment, just a fresh burger bun.
Mike&apos;s party was big on the grub, too, with a combination of standard cookout food, birthday cake, and Italian cuisine. The hots were huge, and there were plenty of them, and even though it got a little cool later in the evening, there was a lively discussion courtesy of the party guests, many of whom are teachers, involved in the City School District in some way, or like Pam and myself, have a child that is school-age. One of the guests was a truck driver for Wegman&apos;s, and after having seen him at the last few get-togethers at Mike and Fran&apos;s, I found out that he worked for my father for years over at Boise Cascade. He told me stories about my father that I&apos;d never heard before, stories that made me laugh and made me incredibly proud of my dad (not that I wasn&apos;t already proud of him). I knew he was well-liked at his job, and this gentleman told me that he actually turned down a promotion so that he could keep working for my father. It was great to hear those stories, and sad, too, because I love to hear good things about my father, but I hate being reminded that he&apos;s no longer with us.
We&apos;re still getting over our recent loss in the family, and yesterday, I had to take one of Dina&apos;s cats into the vet for shots and a pedicure so that he and his sister could be handed over to one of Dina&apos;s co-workers who volunteered to take the animals on. Chester, the cat in question, is not a friendly guy, and he&apos;s scratched and bitten everyone who&apos;s come into contact with him. So who&apos;s the natural choice of person to take him to the vet? Me. The guy who&apos;s on blood thinners and doesn&apos;t clot very well.
In the past, when I&apos;ve gone to the apartment to feed Chester and his sister Fauna, Chester&apos;s been friendly to me, and I figured I&apos;d have a decent chance of getting out of the operation unscathed, but I was going to have to be clever. I grabbed an old towel, and started petting Chester, slowly wrapping him up in it and picking him up and moving him towards the ol&apos; cat carrier. The carrier was fairly big, but even *I* don&apos;t like seeing it because we&apos;ve taken at least four cats to be put down in it, and if I were a cat with a hunter&apos;s sense of smell, I think I would detect the stench of death. I made sure to get Chester&apos;s front paws wrapped up, but the problem appendages were those back feet, powerful pouncing haunches that somehow stopped me from completing the delivery of cat into carrier.
I tried another time, and then finally I realized that I was being too gentle, and for no good reason, and shoved him into the carrier. I got the door fastened, and with nary a scratch. I got Chester into the car, and played some soothing music for him and opened the back window so he could enjoy the fresh air. I actually didn&apos;t know which station he would like to hear the most, so I picked 100.5 The Drive because they had New Music Monday; no reason for both of us to be pissed off.
I got Chester over to the veterinarian, and the vet went to work like a ninja; he clipped Chester&apos;s nails in less than a minute, and administered a couple of booster shots, and it was all over. I explained that it wasn&apos;t my cat, and that I didn&apos;t want to get scratched because of my being on blood thinners, and a young lady was called in to do the holding. She grabbed Chester by the scruff of the neck, which to us looks pretty aggressive, but is really no more uncomfortable to a cat than a firm handshake. After everything was done, the young lady opened the door to the cat carrier, led Chester in by his front paws, and he complied like it was the most natural thing in the world. &quot;This is bullshit!&quot; I protested. &quot;Please, can&apos;t you make it look like it was at least a *little* bit of a struggle?&quot; The vets laughed. They explained that it&apos;s all in the intimidation factor, and when it&apos;s your cat, you&apos;ve got no shot at intimidating them because they know you. I&apos;ve got to get tougher with the family pets if I expect any cooperation, and we&apos;ve only got one cat now, Little Monet (I&apos;m not sure that the &quot;Little&quot; part is actually her name, but that&apos;s what we call her all the time, so it&apos;s stuck), and she&apos;s pretty skittish to begin with. Although in the morning she gets pretty friendly and she even lets Harmony pick her up and carry her around, so maybe she&apos;s not that skittish after all.
This week, we&apos;re hosting our own shindig at the Millennium Lodge, and on a Saturday rather than our regular Sunday date. We&apos;ve tried to get all of our invites out by e-mail, but as always, some folks fall through the cracks, so if you didn&apos;t get an invite, it&apos;s not because we don&apos;t want you to come, we just don&apos;t have a comprehensive, all-inclusive list! If you&apos;re interested in coming, here&apos;s the info, courtesy of Pamela:
Please join us for an afternoon of fun at the Greece Canal Park&apos;s Millennium Lodge,
on Saturday, July 18th, 2009!
http://www.monroecounty.gov/parks-greececanal.php
Food hits the grill at noon. We supply the hots and hamburgers, soda and waters. We&apos;d love it if you&apos;d like to bring a dish, chips, or dessert to share, if you can.
There&apos;s a playground there, as well as three tennis courts, and a soccer/baseball field! Come prepared to have fun! Bring any games/balls/equipment that you&apos;d like as well!
We&apos;ll be there all day, from Noon until 9PM!
Drop-in any time - stay for as long as you&apos;d like!
Please RSVP (Pam&apos;s email: CoolGrrl28@aol.com or Ralph&apos;s email: YuksOnMe@aol.com or our home phone: 585-254-6256) by July 15th so we buy enough supplies!
We look forward to having some fun in the sun with YOU!
Next week: Ralph has jury duty, a gig in West Virginia (can&apos;t do &apos;em both at the same time, let&apos;s see how this shakes out), Mom comes visiting from Florida, and MUCH MUCH MORE! Stay tuned everybody! Also, in August, I&apos;ll be teaching another round of comedy classes (because the last ones were so popular) and you can find the info at http://www.thecomedyclub.us/Comedy_Classes.html. If you want to be funny, or know someone who you think would be interested, pass it along. I made the classes cheap for the summer, and we&apos;ve got some returning folks from our June session, so it should be a lot of fun.
Thanks for reading!

 Teacher (Jethro Tull) 
Posted on 06/29/2009 at 12:27 AM
Tonight I want to extend a special congratulations to the graduates of my most recent comedy class. Earlier this evening, Anthony DiMuro, Eileen Loveman, Tim &quot;Tizo&quot; Maduro, Elliot Marino, Tim Shea and Steven &quot;Sure Shot&quot; Sorensen took the stage at The Comedy Club in Webster, NY (www.thecomedyclub.us) and put into practice the concepts and craft that they studied the last month. I&apos;m proud to report that they all performed fabulously, to the delight of their families, friends and co-workers.
As their teacher this last month, I&apos;m proud to say that they all took the material seriously and some of the students even took advantage of a few extra &quot;voluntary&quot; classes that I offered to make sure that their material was refined and polished. It paid off; they took the stage with confidence and precision, and I couldn&apos;t be prouder of them if they were my own children.
Several area comedians stepped forward and participated in the program, taking the stage in the early part of the show so that none of the graduates had to be &quot;first&quot; and be thrown to the lions. Local comedians Nigel Larson (who also sat in on our classes and offered feedback to the material that was being presented), Rachael Druszkowski (Western New York&apos;s Mom of Comedy), Josh Smith (The Rated-R Rockstar) and Andy Boccacino (a graduate of one of my first comedy classes almost ten years ago) took the stage and entertained our audience, setting the table for the graduates to do their thing.
Some people criticize standup comedy classes; they say &quot;you can&apos;t teach funny.&quot; I might agree with that, but my retort would be that I don&apos;t need to teach funny. Everyone is funny. Everyone has the ability to tell a story, relate a personal experience, kid around, come up with a funny retort. The sense of humor is universal. As a comedy teacher, my goal is to show my students how to translate that sense of humor to a group of strangers. It&apos;s easy to make your friends and family laugh, they already know who you are. The trick is taking it to the stage and making strangers like you and laugh along with you.
In addition to that, you can teach public speaking and you can teach comedy writing, and if you combine them, you have what can reasonably be argued is the starting point of standup comedy.
Attending the performance tonight were Danny Liberto of the Comedy Company (www.noclowns.com) who I had the privilege of working with Saturday night at a room he books in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and who also has taught comedy classes with me in the past, and Steve &quot;The Nuclear Guy,&quot; who is a former student of mine who now tours around the country doing his standup act and booking his own shows. My thanks go out to them for coming out to support our class. Special thanks also go out to Mark Ippolito(the manager of the club, and believe it or not, a comedy class graduate), who tolerated our class messing up his showroom on his off nights, and Joe T. who gave the go-ahead to me to offer the classes after a long hiatus. Also, I would be remiss if I didn&apos;t mention my webguy Bruce who came out, took some group photos after the show, and also is a comedy class graduate (two times!) from back in the day. There was so much love in the room, even my mother-in-law came to the show (no lie!) and her comments, related to me by my wife, was that she really enjoyed the show and she could see these students becoming professionals someday.
I sure hope so.
This week, it&apos;s some well-deserved time off before my college game show tour picks up again with the first of three shows at D&apos;Youville College in Buffalo next Sunday. Happy 4th of July everyone! Remember, the Declaration of Independence states that we have certain unalienable rights, and that chief among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And making people laugh, if done well, can combine all three.

 Psalm 9 (Trouble) 
Posted on 06/26/2009 at 12:22 AM
Wow. Where have you been the last month, Ralph? None of yer damn business, Shecky.
Actually, things have been pretty rough around our house lately. My wife&apos;s Aunt Dina, who had been battling cancer, succumbed on Wednesday night, June 17th.
Dina was good to me, my wife Pamela, and our daughter Harmony. She was a member of our family, a remarkable group that took care of us, sheltered us and loved us. I married a great young lady, but I got a bonus with her family.
Years ago, when I proposed to Pamela, my parents were getting ready to retire to Florida and I was living in the basement apartment of the multi-family house they owned. In order to sell the house, I needed to get out and was about to go look for a place when Pamela suggested that we live together at her apartment. I wasn&apos;t against living together, especially when we were properly engaged, but we had to ask permission of Dina, as she owned the house. She said yes, and very cautiously explained to me that her niece was a special girl, and that if I hurt her in any way, she would come looking for me. It&apos;s been almost 15 years, and I guess I&apos;m doing all right, nobody&apos;s taken a swing at me yet.
Dina worked in Social Services, was active with the union, and often would walk a picket line with other unions in solidarity. She was liberal in a lot of things, but insisted that things would be better if people got up off their ass. She was very Catholic, sang in the folk group at Holy Apostles, and deserved a much longer retirement than the one she got. She retired at 60 after the rigors of her disease started causing complications, and spent the last year of her life managing pain when she should have been enjoying herself.
She particularly liked a song that Pamela and I wrote about Harmony called &quot;The Baby With The Nice Round Head&quot; that we would sing all the time. She thought we should get it published, even though it was just a fun little ditty that we would sing to Harmony when she was really little and we wanted to change her diapers.
Dina wanted the best for us and loved us and we tried to help, but at the end of the day, it was cancer, the heavyweight champion of the world. I&apos;ve done three cancer benefits alone this year, and I could have done three hundred and I don&apos;t think it would make a difference. It&apos;s a horrible disease, hard to diagnose, murder to treat, and we&apos;re no closer to understanding what it is, why it occurs, and why it&apos;s so different from patient to patient than we are to understanding God.
When Dina decided to stop treatment and go gracefully, I couldn&apos;t fault her. The treatments left her weak and drained, and she&apos;d had enough. Making that decision required courage, a courage I&apos;m sure I wouldn&apos;t have. She had plenty of visitors those last couple of weeks, cards, letters, flowers, folks from church, former co-workers, and of course Pamela and I brought Harmony to see her, hoping that her nice round head would bring a smile to Dina&apos;s face. I&apos;m happy to report that it did. Harmony still doesn&apos;t really understand what heaven is, or what happens to people after they go there. She knows that &quot;Auntie Dee&quot; is up there with Grandpa Tetta, Great Grandma, and Snax The Cat. My mother-in-law Anne described it to Harmony as a big party that never ends, and she seemed o.k. with that. I guess I&apos;m o.k. with it, too, but I picture it more as a state of bliss, basking in the love of the Creator, unaware of what&apos;s going on down on Earth. Lord knows, there&apos;s plenty going on down here to make anyone frantic, upset, scared or angry, and I don&apos;t think heaven would allow those things of their denizens.
On Wednesday night, when it happened, I was driving east towards Syracuse to do a TV program on Thursday morning, and the sky was pissing rain like I&apos;d never seen. It was just ridiculous amounts of water coming down, and no more than 15 minutes after I&apos;d hit the road, my wife called me with choking sobs and I knew that Dina had gone. With the time frame we were looking at and the experience of my father as a cancer patient only a couple of years ago, I knew after hearing that Dina was sleeping and mostly unresponsive that it would be quick, but I had no idea that it would be so soon. I&apos;m happy to report that on the day of her interment, the skies were cloudless, the sun was out, and the service was joyous and well-attended. They even let me get up and read a passage, which I thought was nice. My original choices were considered too heavy-handed, I think, but they found a passage that got the message across and was considered more appropriate. Dina had an ex-boyfriend for years and he turned out to be a real scumbag, and as a present to her, I wanted to read something that basically gave him the guns, but in retrospect, I guess it was better that I just concentrated on a passage that indicated that Dina was a good person and her place in heaven was assured. Afterwards, members of the family including my wife&apos;s Uncle Joe from Boston and his wife Gretchen congregated at the Peppermill Restaurant and we had lunch. This was an old haunt of mine, and I could never get Pam to go there, but it was close by the cemetery and a good place to decompress.
Other than that, it&apos;s been a pretty busy June with two weeks in the Cleveland area and a week in Syracuse, and then the invitation to go on the Bridge Street show on WSYR-TV channel 9. I talked about teaching comedy, and I&apos;ve been teaching a class in Rochester for the last month. Our graduation show is this coming Sunday at the Comedy Club in Webster, and everyone&apos;s excited and working really hard to brush up their material for the occasion.
There&apos;s a lot of work to be done around the house, and today I got the air conditioners in to help combat the 85 degree weather. I planted peppers in the back yard and I&apos;m excited to see if anything comes of it, I&apos;m not exactly known for my green thumb. Yesterday, we took Harmony to see a live exotic animal program at the library up the street, it was fun and a nice change of pace from all the stuff we&apos;ve had to deal with the last couple of weeks. This weekend, I have a one-nighter down in Pennsylvania with old buddies Danny Liberto and Joe Bruno, and it should be a lot of fun. I&apos;ve got a low-key yet busy July planned, including a week of jury duty, so we&apos;ll see how that goes.
O.k., that&apos;s enough. Thanks again for everyone who knew what was going on and their show of sympathy to our family in this time, it&apos;s really appreciated. Special thanks to my good friends Steve and Eileen for coming to the memorial service, I know it was a long drive and you&apos;re good friends and good people and my wife and I appreciate you. We&apos;ll see you at our picnic, and then out at your place for the redneck luau.

Just going down memory lane on a rainy, muggy night in Rochester. Ray Salah accompanied me to my last &quot;Dash For Dollars&quot; show of the season down in New Jersey on Wednesday, and for two days, we laughed and talked about the past.
Ray and I have been friends since I met him at Yuk Yuk&apos;s Comedy Club in Rochester back in May of 1988. We&apos;ve been friends for 21 years, played countless shows together, and this summer, we&apos;re going to be doing something new, an improv show targeted towards families with children looking for entertainment options for their kids.
After two days in the car talking about all the stuff we&apos;ve been through, I found a folder full of pictures, including a picture of our friend, Tiny Glover, who passed away last year. I also found folders full of jokes I&apos;d written, hoping at one point to start my own &quot;morning radio joke service&quot; to funnel material at that market. I also found a folder full of poems that I wrote during a time when I was black-balled from the only comedy club in town, Hiccup&apos;s, and the only stage time that Ray and I could get was the Pure Kona open mic poetry night at Java Joe&apos;s. The black-balling basically occurred because there were two clubs in town, and Hiccup&apos;s didn&apos;t want me working at the other club, but the other club treated me better so I went with them, and then they went out of business, turning me into a man without a country.
Looking through the joke folder first....wondering what dusty gems lay in waiting....

2:30 A.M. EDT
The house is quiet.
Good evening, dear reader, or God Save Us, good morning, if you should rise so early. It&apos;s 2:30 in the morning and mommy and baby have both gone to bed, leaving daddy to his own devices, tip-tapping at the computer keyboard, searching the internet for all manner of information, gossip and drivel. It then occurred to me that I hadn&apos;t checked in with you in quite some time, and lo, it&apos;s almost been a month! Where has the time gone off to....
When last I reported, I was in a hotel room in Storm Lake, Iowa, preparing to perform for an all-night after-prom party for a small high school in Newell, Iowa. I was a little worried about the show, not that I wouldn&apos;t be funny, but that I could find the right balance of dirt. Youthful audiences crave blue material, and the adults who look after them fear it. One complaint, carefully worded, and an individual is out looking for a new job. Nobody needs that. I&apos;m glad to say that the feedback that evening was excellent, and a follow-up by my college agent confirmed the same. I had a great time with the kids, and think I might pursue the position of professional commencement speaker. I think I&apos;d be great in that role. If only I could inspire as many protesters as President Obama, then I&apos;d really be on to something. Let&apos;s face it; if everyone agrees with you 100% of the time, you&apos;re either a pandering abjurer or a simpleton with nothing to contribute to the dialogue.
The drive the next day was a rainy one, and I was glad I was able to get my brakes done. The only thing worse than driving on wet pavement is driving on same without adequate brakes. The sun started shining through just a little before the Illinois border, and the rest of the trip was without incident. I arrived at the McCamley Park hotel in Battle Creek, Michigan, got myself cleaned up, ironed some clothing and headed over to Gary Field&apos;s Comedy Theater to participate in the annual Relay For Life benefit show for cancer relief. We had a great turnout, with every seat sold and dynamite performances from Gary Fields, John Face, Kathie Dice, Chris Young and Mike Evitts. I have done this event three times, and they keep asking me back, and I try to mix up my material because I don&apos;t want to get repetitious...one line got a woman to walk. Actually, she didn&apos;t care for the joke and was verbal in her criticism, and I whacked her the way I would any heckler. Hey, if you don&apos;t like the joke, sit down and shut up, everyone else laughed! Sometimes, majority rules whether you like it or not.
On Monday, I dragged my feet getting up to my college agency&apos;s office in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and after a few minutes making nice with the agents, I headed north to Petoskey, Michigan getting ready for a show at North Central Michigan University. I stopped along the way to go to a KFC restaurant because they were running their &quot;free piece of the new grilled chicken&quot; promotion (this was before the Oprah coupon debacle, if you&apos;ve been following that) and my review is that the grilled chicken is pretty tasty, but it is grilled, not fried, so make sure you have a beverage on hand because it can get a little dry. I am of the opinion, however, that dry chicken is good because that means it&apos;s cooked all the way through, and I&apos;ve had undercooked chicken and the nausea and vomiting that follow. I&apos;ll take it dry, thanks, and pass the Diet Coke.
The next morning, I headed over to the college and the battery light on my dashboard started to flicker to life, just as the needle on the battery charge indicator started dipping down to the &quot;negative&quot; sign. Just as I pulled into the college parking lot, the vehicle died. Long story short, alternator. I did a quick &quot;teaser&quot; event to promote the Dash For Dollars show, and then started working the phone to get the Automobile Club to send a tow-truck. Good news, there was a repair shop just a couple of blocks over, and the show wasn&apos;t for six hours. I unloaded all of the game show gear, and just as I was finishing, the AAA driver showed up. He hauled the van down to the repair shop, and there was only one other car in front of me, so it got fixed up in about 90 minutes, maybe less. I headed out to lunch, and then made my way back to campus. I set up the game show set, and then started trolling around the campus handing out dollar bills and promoting the evening show. The gambit worked, and the place was just packed! Nothing guarantees a good show like a big, full audience. Any kind of show, for that matter, is better with a crowd. The funniest comedian in the world can&apos;t rock two people, not without tickling them, anyhow. Give me a couple hundred and I&apos;ll show you a good time, I tell you what.
I had a couple of days off back at Grand Rapids where I stayed with Bill Smith, my college agent. I bummed around and did laundry and some administrative tasks I&apos;d been putting off, like some basic bookkeeping and computer file maintenance. E-mails build up if you&apos;re constantly putting them in the &quot;respond to later&quot; file, but never responding to them. On Thursday afternoon, I brought in lunch for the office as a small token of thanks to the men and women who keep me employed. Every day, make a friend, I say. I found a great sandwich shop right near the office called &quot;Broadway Subs&quot; and the banner outside the shop said something about New Jersey so I decided right there that the food would be good, because New Jersey is an Italian outpost, and Italians know from the cold cuts. Germans know bologna and liverwurst, and maybe Muenster cheese, and after that, feh. I&apos;ll stick with the guineas on this one, thanks. I ordered up a sandwich tray and got some sodas and trotted it into the office in the pouring rain. Still, an army marches on their stomach. And if you&apos;re ever in Grand Rapids, get yourself one of those Broadway subs, they are De*Lish! I went back the next day and got a monster pastrami and provolone, and it was possibly the best ever. Then I went and saw &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; and it was awesome. Thursday night, I was invited to dinner by one of the agents and a couple of his buddies, and we hit BD&apos;s Mongolian Barbecue, a small chain restaurant that has locations all over Michigan. The four of us had a great time chatting over comics, movies, TV shows, and all the stuff that nerds like us go for. The company was good, the food was great, and before we knew it, we&apos;d been sitting there for four hours. I don&apos;t socialize much, so it was nice to get out and do the &quot;hang around&quot; thing. By the way, BD&apos;s is De*Lish.
Friday night, I headlined a show at Shots Bar, Grill and Pizzeria, and it was fun, until some old sourdough truck driver named Charlie started making the rounds to every table and shaking hands like he was running for office. I tried to get him to sit down, but he seemed oblivious to the idea that we were doing a comedy show, and the next thing I knew, I was &quot;stuck in the tar baby,&quot; trying to shut up a guy who was intoxicated AND southern. Pinch me, mama, I&apos;m dreamin&apos;! I drove home Saturday after a nice omelet breakfast at Bill&apos;s house. I&apos;ll say this for Bill Smith, he whips up a great plate of eggs considering I never see him eat anything. Earlier in the week, I brough over a package of bagels and he had whipped up a spread with real horseradish and garlic, and Neufchatel cheese. De*Lish, I say.
In case you&apos;re wondering, I&apos;m trying to get &quot;De*Lish&quot; trademarked, so don&apos;t start using it, see?*
I was home for the first time in three weeks, and I hit the stage again, this time at The Comedy Club in Webster, performing for the benefit of the family of Tiny Glover, one of my good comedy friends who had died last year. I performed with Danny Liberto, Jamie Lissow, Pat Duffy, Dan Viola, and a few other guys I&apos;d never met before, and I took the lead-off position. Tiny was a good guy, and I&apos;ve talked about him in this space before so I&apos;m not going to run over the same old ground again, but it felt good to perform in that event.
After a few days off, I was in the car again, with Ray Salah in tow, headed for Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I headlined a show at the Pony Club Lounge with special guest Spark Man. We had a thinner-than-usual attendance due to the Pittsburgh Penguins being in the NHL playoff against whomever they were playing, and folks stayed away in droves. We had a good show regardless, but there&apos;s something about a mostly empty room that&apos;s hard to get over. The next day, it was up to Strykersville, NY and a comedy benefit show for the troops at the Six Star American Legion Post. Weather and construction delays had caused me to show up at the club just a few minutes after our scheduled showtime, but I was going last on the bill so it didn&apos;t much hurt us. The room was sold out and the show was great (food was good, too) and again, I was happy to be included. Kudos to my co-stars, Josh Smith and Steve &quot;The Nuclear Guy&quot; Natarelli, who helped round out the evening. We would up raising $1,000 for the post, which wasn&apos;t bad considering Strykersville isn&apos;t that big a town to begin with.
I did my second-last game show date of the season on Friday in Madison, Indiana at Ivy Tech Community College. I was performing for the graduating class, and it was a phenomenal show. I caught a lucky break as the school had a freight-sized elevator that was big enough to get the Incredible Cash Cube up to the second level where the performance was, but we still had to call maintenance to get them to remove a door to get it into the room. The girl who was the grand-prize winner was pregnant, and I felt kinda good about that, because I know how much diapers and other &quot;new baby&quot; expenses are. I drove back all day Friday and after a lazy day here at the house (it rained and was pretty crappy so I stayed inside), I went out to the Comedy Club where two of my friends, Jason Russell and Ray Salah, were performing this weekend. They talked me into doing guest spots both shows (seriously, try to keep me off stage) and the crowds were a little stiff, but it was fun to go up and try some new material. After a while, I had to quit screwing around and do some of the &quot;A&quot; material, but that felt too much like work.
I&apos;ve got ten days off before my last game show date of the season, and in the middle of that, I&apos;m doing a cancer benefit here in Rochester (that will be my sixth benefit show this year) and then my club schedule revs up for June. In July, Ray and I are planning to do some family-friendly improv shows at the Comedy Club as we&apos;ve had great success with the show for years doing First Night Celebrations in Binghamton and Buffalo, and want to branch out. In addition, I&apos;m going to start teaching comedy classes again, and maybe that will be the impetus to finish my book about the subject. No matter what, I&apos;m going to stay busy and try to enjoy some family time while I&apos;m doing it.
It&apos;s cold and rainy, which doesn&apos;t feel like May, but it&apos;s gonna be hot soon enough. Enjoy what you have, when you have it.

 Iowa Stubborn (Meredith Wilson) 
Posted on 04/25/2009 at 10:49 PM
Good evening from Storm Lake, Iowa, where menacing grey clouds hover over the area, threatening to discharge a cold rain on the aptly-named community.
I&apos;m at the Super 8 Motel, relaxing before a late-night show for the After-Prom revelers of Newell-Fonda Community School in Newell, Iowa. My report time is midnight, which officially makes this the latest &quot;late show&quot; I&apos;ve ever done in my 20-plus year comedy career.
The tour started 12 days ago, with a drive out of Rochester, NY on Tuesday the 14th. I made my way down the Interstate 90 for what felt like the thousandth time, and got deep into Indiana before deciding to hunker down for the evening. I stopped along the way to refuel at an Indiana tollway rest stop, and as I pumped the gas into the van, standing out in the chilly night air, I soaked in the scenery. There wasn&apos;t much going on by the way of other travelers, although at a pump opposite me, a young lady was crying and hugging an older lady, and she was driving a panel truck with the Budget Rent-A-Car logo on the side. I couldn&apos;t tell exactly what the problem was, except that the truck was pointing the opposite way of the traffic flow. The two women talked, the older one assuring the younger one that everything would be o.k., and I struggled to figure out what was going on. The older woman then left the younger one, and started emptying the garbage cans at the pumps, which confused me because I thought they were traveling together. It was confusing, to say the least, and I paid for my gas, quit eavesdropping and went on my way. I found my way to the Motel 6 in South Bend, Indiana, and got a decent night&apos;s sleep.
The next day, I drove to Carlinville, Illinois, home of Blackburn College for a Dash For Dollars game show engagement. The show was a lot of fun, with a lot of excited students eager to compete for the money. It&apos;s always a thrill to me to do the show because I remember being broke most of the time when I was in college and I know how cool it was to come into a windfall every now and again. I was in the college&apos;s main auditorium, and I had my own dedicated sound technician, who provided me with a lapel mic, ran my sound, and helped me with props. I enjoyed working with the lapel mic, as it kept my hands free to work with the props that we use in the show without having to sacrifice the ability to amplify my voice. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, my bluetooth fell out of my gig bag, never to be seen again. I still had the charger, but I needed my bluetooth replaced. It would have to wait.
Thursday was a drive to Fort Smith, Arkansas and an engagement at the Electric Cowboy, a Comedy Zone one-nighter. I worked with a funny young comic named Gains Kelly, and we had a really good turnout. I was closing, and I took advantage of the time to stretch out and work with the crowd as I like to do from time to time, and it went really well. Thanks to Heff and Joel at Comedy Zone for the opportunity, and don&apos;t worry, the check&apos;s in the mail.
Friday was a day off so I lingered in Fort Smith and got my oil changed (gotta take care of the vehicle) and then drove west to Oklahoma City where my good friends Jason Russell and Steve Burr were working at the Looney Bin comedy club. I checked myself into a Motel 6 and joined up with them at the club and we did the &quot;pal-around&quot; thing. Jason was driving a new car, one that he was very protective of, and Steve wanted to prank him. While Jason was on stage at the late show, Steve and I went out into the parking lot and using some duct tape that I was carrying around in the van, we rigged together some empty Red Bull cans and attached them to the underside of Jason&apos;s car so that when he drove away, he would think something was dragging.
The stunt went off without a hitch; the trick was to position the cans so that Jason wouldn&apos;t see them as he approached the car, and he had parked far away from the door of the club so that no one would park near his car. The problem is that the farther away you get from a car, the more you can see what&apos;s underneath it. We set the cans up so that the rear right tire blocked the view of them, and I thought the jig was up when Jason walked around to his trunk to put his suitcase full of t-shirts away. Luckily, he was distracted enough so that he didn&apos;t see them, and when he started driving away, it was absolutely priceless. He started driving forward (he had backed into the space) and then once the cans started dragging, he paused, then started up again, heard the noise again, and got out of the car immediately. Once he saw the cans, I flashed him the roll of duct tape and he realized he&apos;d been had.
The evening wasn&apos;t without some other excitement. Without wanting to toot my own horn, I&apos;ll instead insert a passage from Steve Burr&apos;s accounting of the incident, culled from his blog at www.steveburrcomedy.com;
It&apos;s been a pretty good week so far and I&apos;m really enjoying the company of the two comics I&apos;m working with, Jason Russell and Susan Freeman. Our threesome has been joined the last couple of days by one of my old Rochester buddies, Ralph Tetta. He&apos;s in the area with a few days off so he made the drive to the OKC to hang out, and it&apos;s lucky for Jason that he did. Ralphie stopped a potential merchandise theft at last night&apos;s show dead in it&apos;s tracks.
Jason and I were set up outside the showroom between shows to peddle some merchandise, when during the commotion of shaking hands and moving product, some sticky fingered girl thought she&apos;d help herself to one of Mr. Russell&apos;s T-shirts, something neither me or the J-man noticed. Ralph however locked in on her instantly and as she made her way past him he reached out and snagged the T-shirt out of her hands, to which she quickly replied, &quot;do you work here?&quot;, like that would have made a difference in whether what she did was right or wrong. Ralph told her he did and she beat feet out the door. I was standing right next to him and saw the whole thing happen, but didn&apos;t know she had stolen something so I wasn&apos;t completely aware what I was seeing. I will tell you this though, Ralph was as cool as a cucumber in busting this chick and didn&apos;t even look at her or the shirt when he grabbed it back. He just reached out and plucked it from her hands like some kind of Secret Service agent or something. It was impressive for sure.
I always wanted to be a superhero, and while I don&apos;t feel my actions were any bit heroic, I&apos;ll take the accolades where I can get them.
Saturday was a laundry day, and Steve and I got together for lunch, and then we went to Target where I purchased a new bluetooth. The unit was different than the one I lost, and I don&apos;t like it as much, but the charger was the same as the other one I had, which left me with an extra. You never know when you&apos;re going to need a spare charger. I went back to the room to relax, and then Saturday night, I hung out with my comedy compatriots and they were able to talk management into letting me warm up the mic a little on the late show. I went in and did my thing, and it felt good; I have to admit that there&apos;s nothing in my life that&apos;s much more uncomfortable than being in a room where there&apos;s comedy going on, and not getting my turn on stage.
On Sunday, Jason, Steve and I went to lunch with J.P., a guy that works at the Looney Bin, and we had some authentic Mexican food, and then made our way over to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. Out of nothing more than coincidence did it happen that my visit correlated with the anniversary of Timothy McVeigh&apos;s heinous act of domestic terrorism. There were long lines to get into the museum, so we made our way around the grounds and read the plaques that adorned the outdoor displays. I have to admit that I got awfully choked up whenever any mention of the children at the daycare center were mentioned; in addition, there was a long, chain-link fence along the front of the memorial, and visitors from all across the country left mementos fastened to it; license plates from various states were popular, as were teddy bears and photos, and it reminded me way too much of the spontaneous memorials that pop up in my urban neighborhood back home when someone dies in an act of violence. It was sobering, to say the least.
On Monday, I lazily checked out of the hotel and made my way into New Mexico, stopping just short of the Colorado border. I checked into another Motel 6, and surveyed the town of Raton to see what it offered a weary traveler who was also hungry, and just picked up another hour due to the time change driving west. I ate at a restaurant called K-Bob&apos;s Steakhouse (www.kbobs.com) and enjoyed their unlimited Salad Wagon which featured their famous Kettle O&apos; Beans (or whatever they called it). It was one of my very few nods this week towards trying to eat healthy. I&apos;ve been so busy, the sit-down restaurant hasn&apos;t exactly been an option and my body is paying the price for it. I&apos;ve gotten doughy around the middle, and I need to make a turn-around but quickly.
Tuesday, I headed north into Trinidad, Colorado, and while it was only a 25-mile or so drive, it was one of the most impressive. At one point, I was travelling up a mountain road and came around a ridge, and then saw snow-capped mountains in the distance. It was the first time I&apos;d ever seen them in real life, and it was inspiring enough to give me pause. Then I realized that it was like the scenery in the background of every South Park episode, and the recognition made me chuckle a little inside. The day was spent killing time as my early arrival left me with extra time on my hands, so I walked around in a Wal-Mart and picked up a couple of items to make my life a little easier. I arrived early at the college, but loading in the gear for the show turned out to be challenging because the cafeteria didn&apos;t include a door that was large enough for the Incredible Cash Cube to fit through, so we managed to talk some Facilities technicians into removing a door for us. The sound system turned out to leave something to be desired, so I abandoned it and managed to do the show without it, and it turned out just fine. Being able to improvise is clearly the key in being able to do one of these game shows successfully.
Wednesday was a travel day, and I made my way up through Pueblo, Colorado Springs and Denver. The whole week before, I was nervous because of the reports of snow that the area had received, and not only because I don&apos;t enjoy driving in blizzards, but also because I had failed to bring foul-weather winter clothing. When I left Rochester, it was warming up and I decided that a heavy hooded sweatshirt would do the trick, and somehow decided to also pack a knit hat and gloves just in case. The good news is that the snow was gone, but I still wound up hitting Denver at 5 o&apos;clock. It bothers me that in a time when we&apos;re supposedly experiencing record unemployment as a nation that it hasn&apos;t provided some relief on the highways of our major cities.
I made it all the way to North Platte, Nebraska, site of Mid Plains Community College, the next stop on my Dash For Dollars Western Tour. I was contemplating dragging my feet and stopping at the Nebraska-Colorado border and making the rest of the journey the next day, but the highway was empty, the sun was shining and I decided to go for it. If you&apos;re never driven across Nebraska, let me just say this; farm states are resplendent with manure, and there&apos;s no escaping it. There&apos;s two kinds of farms, crops and livestock. Livestock farms produce manure, and crop farms spread it around and let it bake in the sun. The odor floated around in my nose like ghosts in the attic of a haunted house. I checked into a Motel 6, did some laundry, and then watched TV because they didn&apos;t have wireless internet, and any attempt to dial-up would have resulted in long-distance charges. I was out there, Jack.
The next day, I packed up my stuff, hit the bank, ate lunch, shopped for props (do you realize how hard it is to find Bubblicious Bubblegum in a small town?), and then moved over to another hotel that Mid Plains had reserved for me. I realized somewhere along the line that my back brakes were grinding, and I needed to do what I do quite often; live in the future. I checked my date book to see when I would have a four-hour block of time to get work done on the van, and decided that I&apos;d have to stick it out until Saturday morning when I&apos;d be in a big city (Sioux City, Iowa) and close to the next gig (Newell-Fonda Community School, a mere 90 minutes away). I made my way to the gig, and found that they put me in a huge gymnasium reserved for basketball games. I had only played one other gymnasium in this first year of my game show hosting career, and that show was sparsely attended. I had a decent crowd and an extremely hospitable support staff at the college, and a stadium-worthy sound system that ROCKED!
Friday, I headed toward Sioux City, Iowa after reloading my cash supply at Wells-Fargo (who treated me very kindly in breaking up large bills even though I didn&apos;t have an account) and I rolled into town and checked into the Rodeway Inn. I had about 45 minutes to shower and dress before I had to leave for Briar Cliff University, and I made it with a few minutes to spare. Fred Seel, my contact at the school, had provided me with a detailed map so I knew exactly where I was going, which helped a lot. We had plenty of volunteers to help with the load-in (which isn&apos;t always the case) and we wound up needing them because the Cash Cube had to be carried down a small set of stairs into the performance area (and carried up the stairs on the way out). The show was awesome, with a lot of audience interaction, money flying through the air, and we even did a little video interview after the show as the winner of the contest and I got to enjoy a few minutes of fame. I&apos;m happy to report that neither I nor the young lady who won the grand prize were asked our opinions about gay marriage; apparently that sort of thing can get you a lot of negative press.
Back at the ranch, I started combing the phone book looking for brake shops with Saturday hours, and I found one that was less than a mile and a half away from the hotel. I watched television until I passed out, and the next morning, called an establishment called Tires Tires Tires. The store was booked up and wouldn&apos;t be able to help me, but suggested that I try their other location. I had nightmare visions of having to drive 40 miles away, but it was just up the road about 5 or 6 miles. They got me in and I got the repairs done with enough time to get back to the hotel to shower and pack up. Unfortunately, I was in such a hurry, I left behind my phone and bluetooth charger. I had a backup bluetooth charger and I carry a phone charger in the van, but I was still pissed at myself for rushing out of the hotel. Seriously, if I was a few minutes late in checking out, what were they going to do, beat me up? My biggest problem seems to be (besides carelessness) that I never pack my luggage the same way twice, and so I never remember where I put stuff, and I can&apos;t do a check to make sure I didn&apos;t forget anything. Stuff like phone chargers like to hide because the outlets they&apos;re plugged into are always behind end tables and cabinets.
So now, here I am at the Super 8, getting ready for a 12:30 AM show, and looking down the barrel of a 635-mile drive tomorrow to Battle Creek, Michigan, to participate in a benefit show for Relay For Life, a cancer relief charity. I&apos;m going to lose an hour as I return to the Eastern time zone, and the drive will take at least nine or ten hours if there are no weather or traffic related delays. The show starts at 7 PM, so the question I have to answer is when I have to leave Storm Lake to make it to Battle Creek in time to get a shower and dress. There&apos;s plenty of time for sleeping afterwards.
I&apos;ll be in Michigan for the rest of next week and then heading for home next Saturday. It&apos;s going to be good to get back home, and then on Sunday, May 3rd, I&apos;ll be performing at a tribute show for my friend, Tiny Glover, who passed away recently. May is going to be a relatively slow month with a lot of time off to spend at home, and I&apos;ll be looking forward to it. Right now, it&apos;s time to get into &quot;show&quot; mode by ironing a shirt and getting a shower. I usually get ready for shows with mindless activities that keep me distracted from the task before me.
You don&apos;t think these blogs write themselves, do ya?

Well, it&apos;s that time of year again, and that means that baseball season has started. And it&apos;s time for me to come clean to the American public, and state, for the record, THAT I HATE BASEBALL.
Always have. It&apos;s a fucking pox. It&apos;s a shitty game. Boring as hell, puffed up on it&apos;s own self-importance, and followed by the shallowest of human beings.
The big arguments are widely held, even by fans and people in the baseball industry. And yet they blindly soldier on, drinking beer, eating peanuts, and keeping track of statistics. Well, let&apos;s take a look at this bullshit game that stopped being the &quot;national pastime&quot; sometime during the Nixon administration.
1. THEY PLAY TOO MANY GAMES. 162 games a year, to be precise. Well, let&apos;s do the math...that&apos;s double the games that hockey and basketball teams play in a season, and about ten times the number of games a football team plays. So basically what you&apos;re telling me is that a team could dump a ton of games in the crapper, and still be considered one of the best. All sports is frivolous, but baseball seeks to make frivolity an art form. Let&apos;s cut the season down to a reasonable number of games so that individual games actually mean something. I think baseball sucks, so I&apos;d be satisfied with every team playing every other team once and then start the playoffs. Hell, NFL teams go eight years before they go through the rotation and play every other team, and they have the same number of teams.
2. BASEBALL IS NOT A TEAM SPORT. When it comes down to it, the game is a face off between a pitcher and a batter. And most of the fielding team doesn&apos;t even move once a ball is put in play. You want to liven the sport up for Ralph Tetta? You want to get me involved? Get rid of the benches, and let the batter&apos;s team hang out on the field. Easy out, pop fly? The batter has a guy right there to push the fielder out of the way and prevent him from catching the batter &quot;out.&quot; Or, he could catch the ball, and then the batter&apos;s team plays a spirited game of &quot;keep away&quot; while the batter rounds the bases. Either way, you&apos;ve got a sport that&apos;s fun to watch and challenging to play. Now that I&apos;ve chimed in with my plan for improvement, regular baseball sounds like shit, doesn&apos;t it? You&apos;re god damned right it does.
3. THEY CALL THE CHAMPION SHIP &quot;THE WORLD SERIES.&quot; And all the teams are from the United States, unless the Toronto Blue Jays somehow sneak into the playoffs. The only thing &quot;world&quot; about the series is that there are usually a butt-load of South American and Asian guys on the teams, and what does that say about the game when Asian guys are athletic enough to make the team?
4. THE MANAGERS WEAR UNIFORMS. Fucking ridiculous. Granted, it&apos;s rooted in tradition when the manager of a team would also be a player, but again, how stupid does some old fat guy look trotting out in pinstripes? It&apos;s as out of place as the 14-year-old kid who rings your door at Halloween looking for candy, and it needs to go. And how about updating the look of the uniforms, anyway? A baseball team looks like a busload of douche bags in their pajamas...they&apos;re not on their way to a physical contest, it&apos;s nap time.
5. THE ALL-STAR GAME IS PLAYED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON. Not to be disparaging, but is that really fair to all the players? A guy who&apos;s picked as an &quot;all-star&quot; could shit the bed in the second half, or a rookie player could hit his stride and start streaking after being passed over. Fuck if we&apos;re gonna be so nonchalant about the placement of the All-Star game, play the fucking thing in the winter. During Christmas week, when everyone&apos;s out of town for the holidays.
6. DOUBLE HEADERS. Let&apos;s face it, if you can play two games in a day, it&apos;s not even physically strenuous enough to be called a sport. And what happens when your team wins one and loses the other? What are you supposed to do, celebrate and mope?
Baseball appeals to people who like statistics. You know who else likes numbers that much? Accountants. And everyone knows what a bag of laughs they are. Baseball is an out-of-date system that we keep in place for some misguided traditionalism, like the Electoral College. It has no place in society, and takes more than it gives. Congress actually got side-tracked from dealing with real issues like war and the economy to try and figure out if players had used steroids or not. I demand a recount.
Baseball is light on action. If you want to play up the strategy aspect of the game, here&apos;s a one-word rebuttal.....chess. My amplified answer is &quot;Chess, motherfucker.&quot; During an NFL contest, every player on the field is in motion. During an NBA or NHL contest, every player is in motion until the period is over. In baseball, there&apos;s a lot of standing around.....talking......and scratching. Sometimes, the manager and the catcher take a stroll out to the mound for a sidebar. YAWN.
Some of the teams are named after laundry. The Boston Red Sox? You do realize that this nick-name is only one generation removed from calling themselves the Boston White-Striped Boxer-Briefs. Lame, lame, and more lame.
In closing, I will offer one positive observation about baseball, just so you baseball lovers won&apos;t think I&apos;m all bad. Baseball has provided people like me who don&apos;t like guns an alternate form of home security in the baseball bat. It&apos;s way more effective than trying to chase off home invaders with a hockey stick or a ping-pong paddle.
Play ball.

 Everyday I Write The Book (Elvis Costello) 
Posted on 04/02/2009 at 11:09 PM
It&apos;s funny how things change. Mostly, change comes gradually...you don&apos;t notice it because it&apos;s a small change each day, but then months or years down the road, you compare whatever it is that changed to the way it used to be, and it&apos;s a drastic difference.
Want proof? Look at your high school graduation photo, and then look in the mirror. I&apos;ll wait.
Big difference, huh? Unless you&apos;re Michael J. Fox, who for some reason is holding on pretty well.
I mention change because I&apos;ve certainly changed. I used to blog about three times a week, and now I finally get a chance to sit down and write, and I look at the date of my last entry, and it&apos;s been two weeks. The way it feels, it might as well be a lifetime.
I&apos;m always on the fence about what I should write. The least interesting types of blogs, my friend Ward told me today, are the &quot;road diary&quot; types of blogs (what I had for lunch, where I&apos;m playing this week, how the crowds were, etc.) and the current events, political or philosophical blogs.
Unfortunately, those are the two big guns in my arsenal.
When I do write something funny, I try to record it as a podcast and post it on my primary website, www.ralphtetta.com. As my webmaster Bruce would tell you, I&apos;m sporadic at best at generating new material, and to be more honest about it, piss-poor. I&apos;ve written one thing this YEAR. That blows.
I&apos;m writing a book about standup comedy. I have a great deal of it already finished, but I showed it around to a bunch of fledgling comics for their feedback, and got lots of great ideas about things that should be added and amplified. I&apos;ve hoped to use some of my down-time to get the writing done, but there&apos;s always something cool on TV, or the internet, or one of the books I brought to read, the complimentary USA today from the hotel, or just a nap.
I have an idea for a CD full of &quot;radio plays&quot; that I think would be great fun to record. Basically, a comedy album full of sketches that include audio only. I&apos;ve written one sketch, and figure I need between nine and twelve more. That project is dry-docked until I can get off my ass.
My discipline is for shit.
I&apos;ve become the most useless person I could possibly be; I&apos;m a writer who doesn&apos;t write.
I&apos;ve gotten accolades in the past for my writing abilities; now I&apos;m resting on my laurels. I need a kick in the ass to get going again, and I just don&apos;t know how to do it. I&apos;ve been keeping plenty busy with the college tour, and I&apos;ve got Easter week off, but I can tell you right now what&apos;s going to happen; I&apos;m going to get home from New Mexico, and I&apos;m going to decompress and spend time with my family who will be hogging my time because they haven&apos;t seen me in a month. Then I&apos;m hitting the road again for about three weeks. Hopefully I can shake out some of the dust, but lately I just feel unmotivated. I&apos;m actually only writing this blog to get the juices flowing.
I wish it was just writer&apos;s block. I can beat that. I&apos;ve learned all the tricks. I&apos;m just dodging the task at hand with other bullshit pursuits. The upside is that I&apos;ve consumed so much news, I&apos;m an expert at most anything going on in the world today. Go ahead, try me.
O.K. I think I&apos;ve indulged in enough self-flagellation for one day. Maybe I can get some work done now. I&apos;ll check in from time to time and tell you how it&apos;s going.
Crap. &quot;Family Guy&quot; is on.....

 Working On A Dream (Bruce Springsteen) 
Posted on 03/19/2009 at 12:21 PM
Good morning, readers from blogger.com, Facebook, MySpace, and ComedySoapbox. I&apos;m delighted that you chose to take a few minutes to read me and see what&apos;s on my mind.
In the past few years that I&apos;ve been putting fingers to keyboard, I&apos;ve attempted to chronicle my journey in the world of standup comedy and professional entertainment. At key points in my life, I&apos;ve deviated from that path to share personal musings, recognize departed family and friends, and discuss current events of interest.
I&apos;ve always attempted to keep a balance; to provide as much information as possible to give a real look at what my life on the road is like, but not so much that it becomes a boring exercise. Sometimes I manage the task quite handily, and sometimes you read about my roast beef sandwich that I made in my hotel room after a show.
My life has always seemed to have been chopped up into four-year increments; I do something for four years, and then move on. I spent four years in college, four years managing the Comix Cafe, and now toured the country for eight years in the comedy clubs. I guess I enjoyed this part of the ride so much, I did two tours. And now I&apos;m starting what I have to assume is another four-year stint hosting the college game show &quot;Dash For Dollars.&quot;
I&apos;m absolutely loving it, and each college that I visit brings a new challenge. Some schools are bigger than others, some are situated in densely populated urban settings, others out in the country among the cornfields. Some colleges provide huge performance venues, others have access to more intimate spaces. I welcome the challenge that each school provides, and work according to the specifications.
The thing that they all have in common is the trust they put in me to provide a great show, and I work very hard to make sure that I deliver on that promise. The students are the stars of the show, not me, and I try not to forget that. I deliver the show with the promise of fair play, sportsmanship, and the idea that a positive attitude will be rewarded, and not just greed. And some audiences are better at accepting that than others. I roll with the punches, do my job and let the chips fall where they may. A roller coaster has to creek slowly up a hill to provide the rush of the plunge down the other side.
The great advantage that this new opportunity has afforded me is that I&apos;m working constantly, doing colleges mostly during the week, and leaving weekends open for club work, which I still enjoy. The disadvantage is that the time I&apos;ve been allowed to spend at home to reconnect with my family and decompress has shrunk, and made those moments more precious. But a curious side effect has also taken hold, and that is that I&apos;m absorbing even more news now than I used to. There&apos;s a great deal of down time on the road, and I&apos;ve got all the tools at my disposal to absorb a ridiculous amount of information. In the vehicle, I have satellite radio, and now that XM and Sirius have merged, there&apos;s about 250 channels to surf through. Every hotel has some sort of cable package, and my laptop provides constant connection to the internet, which I access for what seems like every waking moment. Today, they pushed a USA Today under my door. I literally can&apos;t stop the information from flowing.
With all that being said, I come to my point; I finally understand why our economy collapsed. From what I understand, the problem stemmed from the housing market. Banks were writing mortgages at sub-prime rates, which allowed people to purchase homes they couldn&apos;t afford. At the same time, housing prices were going through the roof because everyone could basically get the financing they needed to purchase the homes. As demand went up and the supply stayed constant, the price went up; simple economics. Then the banks, knowing that many of these mortgages were going to wind up in foreclosure, went to companies like AIG to insure the loans, which was smart. The problem was that AIG was insuring the loans at a much greater ratio than their actual asset ability to provide. They would then bundle these debts as securities and made them available to investors, and of course, they weren&apos;t worth the paper they were printed on because they were unsustainable debts backed by money that just wasn&apos;t there.
So when regular working folks who had these mortgages for homes they couldn&apos;t possibly afford started defaulting, the banks started collecting on the insurance of these bad mortgages, and the whole house of cards fell down. AIG failed, which meant that the banks holding all of these bad mortgages failed, and the investors who plowed money into AIG lost their investments, which in many cases represented their retirement funds.
There are other factors in play, and I don&apos;t have a background in economics so I can&apos;t really comment, but it seems that the whole mess is predicated on a few simple factors; first, that Americans couldn&apos;t pass up the idea that they could live in a house beyond their means to maintain, and second, that the banks couldn&apos;t pass up the profit that they would make writing mortgages far and above the business that they would normally do, and not see it as a risk because they were able to get the loans insured. And there was no regulation going on at any point of the cycle.
People who know me know that I would have no problem laying the blame for this squarely at the feet of the Republican President of the last eight years, but there is essentially no one person who can shoulder the blame. President Calvin Coolidge famously said, &quot;The business of America is business.&quot; Capitalism should exist for the purpose of individuals making money, providing a comfortable lifestyle, allowing ones self to raise a family, and to secure a retirement free of worry. The social contract, though, is that money should be earned, and be based on something; usually the sweat of one&apos;s brow or the product of a factory or field. That&apos;s all there is on the playing field, folks....goods and services. Products and labor. And when we start shifting around air, we blow up a balloon that has no choice but to pop.
But who can blame the financial sector for contriving such a scheme? We don&apos;t have goods and services anymore. We allow China to make all of our consumer goods, and we ship our jobs to Mexico and India and anywhere else we can, favoring the 60 cents a day worker over our American minimum wage which stifles a corporation&apos;s profitability. So there&apos;s nothing left to do but trade in money, and bundled debt disguised as securities. And watch the stock market drop like a rock that moments ago was skipping along the surface of the lake.
We need a way out. The Republicans cry &quot;tax cuts!&quot; but how much of a tax cut could you provide for someone to keep them in their home? To rebuild their shattered nest egg? To allow a company to start hiring workers again and provide them an income with which to start anew? I personally don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible.
I think the answer is that we have to start making things again. We need to open factories, hire workers here in the United States, and start elevating the middle class...because the middle class is the class that actually consumes the goods.
I don&apos;t know the ins-and-outs of farm subsidies, but I do know that there&apos;s less food in the world than there are people who need to be fed. Why are we not producing as much food as possible? Instead of sending cash overseas in the form of foreign aid (which I believe we should be doing, absolutely) why are we not sending boatloads of grain? There are probably factors I&apos;m not considering like spoilage, cost of distribution, etc, but again, I don&apos;t claim to be an expert. I&apos;m just a man crying out in the wilderness looking for answers.
Can we start working again? Can we reclaim our American dream?
How about this....health care seems to be on a lot of people&apos;s minds, and rightfully so. The state of health care in this country is unsatisfactory by anyone&apos;s standards except for perhaps the pharmaceutical manufacturers and insurance agencies. Every doctor I&apos;ve spoken to (not enough for a sample, but enough to make me say this without hesitancy) is in favor of a single-payer health care system. Preventative medicine seems to be the area in which we particularly lag in this country. And that means that illnesses, ailments and conditions don&apos;t get treated until they are in the drastic stages, and they become more difficult to cure. How much do we waste by allowing people to get that sick? And how much does overall production suffer due to lost time on the job by workers who are out sick? Has anyone calculated that cost?
And of course, all of this speculation falls on the shoulders of one man; President Obama. I trust President Obama, and I think a lot of Americans do, too. Currently, his popularity is riding around 60%, but even that number is moving downward as impatient Americans look for answers and results. He understands that in order for us to dig our way out of the hole, we need shovels. And right now, the government is in the best position to provide those shovels.
Obama&apos;s plan at this point seems to be a carbon copy of Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s plan, to start building infrastructure (which to be fair, we do need) and creating jobs. We almost need a Marshall plan to rebuild America much as Japan was rebuilt after World War II. There are critics of Obama&apos;s plan, to be sure, and the rhetoric seems to center around the idea that &quot;You can&apos;t spend your way out of a recession.&quot; The criticism shrivels a bit when you change the word &quot;spend&quot; into the word &quot;invest.&quot; Building safe bridges, levies, dams, roads and highways is an expenditure, to be sure, but it is an investment. Just as having up-to-date schools to educate and train the next generation of Americans is also an expenditure, it is no less an investment.
My father lived through the Great Depression, and now it looks as though I&apos;ll get the opportunity to do the same. And I&apos;ve decided that perhaps this is something that America needs right now. In times of trouble, we pull together and help each other, we share what we have and we lift each other up. We speak more softly and we listen a little more carefully, because we&apos;re all in this together. And we embody the great American spirit that all things are possible if we stick together, join hands, contribute our talents to the pool and push in the same direction.
We need hope, not despair. We need to roll up our sleeves and start working again. And we need each other.
There is an old English proverb that goes like this; &quot;Fear knocked at the door and Faith answered, and lo, no one was there.&quot;
Have faith in God, each other, and yourself. We can do this. And if you know someone who needs encouragement, please send this along as a text or a link.
Let&apos;s get to work.

 This Land Is Your Land (Woody Guthrie) 
Posted on 03/07/2009 at 11:34 AM
Not to over dramatize, but I woke up this morning feeling like a gunfighter who had to shoot 50 cowboys the night before.
I&apos;m in Canton, NY, the home of SUNY Canton, and the first return engagement of the Dash For Dollars Comedy Game Show in my tenure as host.
When last I checked in, I was heading towards Warwick, Rhode Island and the Comedy Zone at the Showcase Cinemas. The drive from Rutland, Vermont wasn&apos;t very long, but it did take me through Boston. I think sometimes that directions provided by a GPS system or calculated by Mapquest, RandMcNally.com or some other service, are not the best directions because even though they calculate the directions as being the fastest or shortest routes, they don&apos;t take into account the rush hour traffic (or even general daytime congestion) that can occur in major metropolitan areas. As soon as I noticed that the GPS was sending me to Boston, I gritted my teeth, but kept on going because it was early afternoon and I figured I&apos;d catch a break.
Well, as it turned out, I did catch a break and even though there was a slowdown or two, I wound up making it into Rhode Island with plenty of time to spare. I checked in to the hotel and didn&apos;t see many cars, but the hotel was full; that&apos;s because there was a college women&apos;s basketball tournament going on, and everyone had arrived on a single bus. And the whole time I&apos;m sitting there thinking, &quot;I&apos;m in a hotel filled with female college basketball players, why didn&apos;t this shit ever happen when I was single?&quot; Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love my wife, but her turnaround-jumper is for shit. Ha ha, just kidding, I love you honey, stop hitting me.
I was working at the Comedy Zone with fellow road dog Mutzie from New Orleans, Louisiana. Mutzie and I work a lot together, and I think that&apos;s part and parcel of the Comedy Zone&apos;s faith in us to deliver a great show. The room at the Showcase Cinemas was a new endeavor, and even though there had been comedy done in movie theaters before (Buffalo had the famous Como 8 comedy night, lovingly re-named the &quot;Coma 8&quot; by disenchanted Western New York comics for the less-than stellar turnouts and reactions from the sparse audiences), but this was a whole different animal. The Showcase Cinemas had literally turned one of their 16 screening rooms into a real comedy club, complete with tables down in the front, a great stage, beautiful sound and lighting, a full restaurant menu (not just popcorn, but they had that, too), and a liquor license! They really did the place up nice, and it was a joy to perform there. They had printed up really nice lobby cards, those big posters that you see in theaters that specialize in live theater, plays and stuff like that, and there in glorious color was my new headshot! After the weekend was over, the cards were going to be discarded in favor of the next week&apos;s performers, so Mutzie and I grabbed one each for a souvenir. It was really a great weekend, with plenty of folks coming in, many for the first time, and I think Mutzie and I made a good impression on them.
During the day on Saturday I did the road comic thing, getting up early to grab the complimentary continental breakfast and then doing laundry, and napping because I knew that Sunday morning I was going to need to beat some weather. A big snowstorm was coming, and I had one day to drive to my next game show date in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I got up early enough on Sunday to get coffee, jump in the van, and get out of town before the first snowflakes could hit the ground. I will compress the next 13 hours into as small a space as possible; I drove to Indiana, stopped for gas several times and also to use the bathroom, talked on the phone, listened to talk radio, and tried not to let the uninteresting terrain of Pennsylvania and Ohio hypnotize me into driving off of the road. When I reached the hotel in Fort Wayne, I was exhausted. Even though it&apos;s just driving in a van, it&apos;s pretty tough work, especially if you&apos;re sharing the road with truckers jacked up on coffee, energy drinks, truck stop amphetamines (caffeine pills, my ass) and deadlines with delivery incentives.
I got about 6 hours of sleep and woke up the next morning, not completely sure exactly where I was. Luckily, the Student Activities director at the college called my cell phone and I snapped back to current reality. My venue had been changed at the college, so I got up and bee-lined for the proposed area. There were some difficulties, as in, the cash booth that is the center piece of my game show didn&apos;t fit into the building I was assigned to do the show. I had been warned to expect this sort of thing and prepare in advance, so I used my vast improvisational skills to figure out how to do the show without it, and even though it was a small turnout, we had a great time, the students loved the show, and I got out of there with a feeling of job satisfaction that I had done the best job I could. In retrospect, it was good thing that I didn&apos;t have to load in the cash booth, because the standard rider on the college contract is that the school provides help to load the unit in. The single person who was assigned to me was a pregnant secretary. She was helpful, but that wasn&apos;t the &quot;two helpers&quot; I was expecting. Pre-natal volunteers rarely carry their own weight in such circumstances, as said weight is in the single digits.
After the show it was back east to Cleveland, Ohio, where I did a very exciting show at Cuyahoga Community College in the downtown area. The school was in the general vicinity of the Cleveland Improv comedy club, so I was somewhat familiar with the area. I caught a break in the morning as one of my pre-show duties is to visit a bank and replenish the cash that is necessary to put in the money booth, and broken into the correct increments. You can&apos;t just shove any amount of money you want in there, it has to be $500 and in the proper amount of bills. The hotel had a cash machine in their lobby, and after chatting with the folks at the desk, they told me that they were both willing and able to break the $20 bills that the ATM would provide into the bills that I would need. It saved me a trip, and I used the time savings to relax with the paper, some coffee, and a hot bowl of oatmeal (always working on my cholesterol, I am).
The real fun of the week was to happen the next day, in Middletown, Ohio, home of the Middletown campus of Miami of Ohio University. I got to the hotel just a little before 7 in the evening, in time to enjoy the manager&apos;s reception in the lobby, which garnered me free nachos. I put together a bowl with some nice hot cheese sauce (I somehow always undermine my efforts to work on my cholesterol) and retired to my room to enjoy movies on HBO and an early night&apos;s sleep. The next morning, I was up with the birds and ready to start my day.
I headed down to the breakfast area to put together a plate with some eggs, sausage, and a nice bowl of oatmeal. I grabbed some coffee and skim milk and set myself up at a table facing the wide-screen television in the breakfast room. I was enjoying my breakfast and the local newscast, when an older gentleman, probably in his 50&apos;s, sat down at the table next to me with his plate.
This gentleman had put together a huge amount of food, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and it was all chopped up together into a big mound. He was a portly type, with a clean flannel shirt, tucked into his jeans, and wearing a pair of wide suspenders. He had a bald head, but a big white beard that made me think of Santa Claus for some reason. He looked like a blue-collar type, and for some reason, I figured he was an electrician or something. The table he chose was parallel to mine, and he was facing the TV, and literally was no farther away from me than a foot. The tables in the breakfast area were quite close together.
After he put his plate down, he got up and changed the station on the TV, which immediately pissed me off. Shared television etiquette dictates that you can&apos;t just change the station without asking if anyone else was watching the program that was on (which I was), and also first-come, first-served comes into play as well. And to make matters worse? This son-of-a-bitch put on FOX NEWS. So now I am doubly pissed....he jumped the TV for his own purpose, fuck everyone else who was there first, and he&apos;s a right-wing conservative. I sat there and stewed in my own anger, because I never would have just assumed that I could switch off the local news and choose some left-leaning program that I would have liked, I would always have some sort of sense of decorum for those in the room that wouldn&apos;t enjoy such programming.
So I&apos;m sitting there hating this contemptuous individual, and a lady in a sports jacket comes over and addresses him. &quot;Sir, are you a hotel guest?&quot;
And there&apos;s a pause. I know immediately that he&apos;s not a guest, and he just snuck in to cadge the free breakfast.
&quot;I&apos;m with (inaudible) up in room (inaudible).&quot; He&apos;s sitting right next to me, I&apos;m right there in the middle of this, and even though I know this guy&apos;s getting his comeuppance, I&apos;m uncomfortable.
&quot;Sir, the breakfast is a courtesy for our hotel guests. You can&apos;t help yourself AND YOU&apos;VE BEEN TOLD THIS BEFORE.&quot; The son-of-a-bitch has done it before! I&apos;m delighting in the embarrassment of the situation. I try not to smirk, finish my coffee and get the hell out of there.
Now, I&apos;m not going to sit here and try to draw some parallel between people who watch Fox News and people who steal complimentary hotel breakfasts that they&apos;re not entitled to. But it&apos;s interesting, is it not, that this cat did what he did? He wandered in from off the street (and if he&apos;s done this before, he&apos;s a local resident), helped himself to some food he had no intention of paying for, commandeered the television set to his own liking, and sat there with no qualms.
It seems like a sense of entitlement to me. It seems like (at it&apos;s worst) THEFT. Conversion for personal gain. And this sense of entitlement, from a man who I assume because of his choice of Fox News, a conservative-leaning programmer, would rail against such things as the cost of this entitlement lays squarely on the backs of the people who PAY for lodging in the hotel. So much for individual achievement, huh? So much for the rejection of entitlements, Socialist ideas, the idea that everyone should be fed and cared for.
Coincidentally, there were some folks milling around in the breakfast area earlier, before Mr. Suspenders showed up, and they were speaking German, which I don&apos;t speak. But there is a German word, and you may have heard of it, known as Schadenfreude. Translated, this word means secretly delighting in the misfortune of others. I confess that I felt this as I made my way to the elevator, that this man who I don&apos;t like was found out to be a thief, a hypocrite, and was told off by the hotel staff. My show was fine, and there was an eight-hour drive home, and I whistled all the way.
I mentioned the story to my mother-in-law the next day, and she postulated that maybe the guy was homeless. Maybe he couldn&apos;t afford food. In truth, he was too clean and well groomed to make me think that he was indigent in any way, but that begs another question; why would a homeless guy be watching Fox News? The Right&apos;s whole shtick seems to be that if you&apos;re down on your luck, it&apos;s because you didn&apos;t work hard enough, and giving you a handout is hurting you because it will take away your impetus to work harder and do better for yourself.
It&apos;s hogwash, by the way. It assumes that everyone has equal access to the tools of success, and there&apos;s no such thing as bad luck. Tell it to someone who has a child with a catastrophic illness, a birth defect, a special need. Tell it to someone who just isn&apos;t mathematically inclined and gets enough B&apos;s on their high school transcript that they aren&apos;t eligible for an academic scholarship, but their family is also too well off to qualify for a needs-based scholarship. Tell it to someone who for a million different reasons, falls through the cracks and works as hard as they can, but still wind up with a bare-bones subsistence life.
Boy, wouldn&apos;t it be great if it were different? We could all afford our own eggs and sausage. We wouldn&apos;t worry about someone taking the toast off of our plate. &quot;Why should I share my breakfast with that guy? I earned this breakfast. Tell him to get a job.&quot;
My breakfast was provided by the hotel, and the hotel room was paid for by the college I was performing at that day, as a part of my compensation. I worked for my breakfast. And here&apos;s the worst part of the story....if Mr. Suspenders was truly in need, truly hungry, homeless, down on his luck, his wife&apos;s in the hospital with breast cancer and her illness has drained their savings down to the last dime he had to spend on breakfast, if he had come up to me with any of those stories, I would have given him my breakfast. Regardless of his choice of television shows. I would have made up a plate for him, chopped up the sausage and eggs, put the gravy on, and sat with him outside in my van, heat blowing, while he ate his breakfast.
Because I love people. I hate to see people hurting. I hate to see them go without, to be down, to feel like no one&apos;s on their side. It&apos;s why I&apos;m a Liberal. If I have ten dollars and you have nothing, then the truth is we both have five dollars and we&apos;re eating at Subway. And next week, maybe you&apos;ll have ten dollars and I&apos;ll be broke, but it won&apos;t matter because you&apos;ll honor our social compact and we&apos;ll be at Subway, having a sandwich and enjoying the feeling that says we&apos;re not alone today. It&apos;s why we live in cities, close to each other. It&apos;s why we have Neighborhood Watch (Socialist idea), neighborhood schools (Socialist idea), why we go to church together (Socialist, Socialist, Socialist) and donate to charities, and build playgrounds and let our children play together and why we work together. We are not alone. We don&apos;t rise and fall based on our own merits. We need each other.
Don&apos;t let anyone tell you different.

 Meeting Across The River (Bruce Springsteen) 
Posted on 02/27/2009 at 12:36 AM
Good evening from the cold, snowy, wind-swept, frigid, warmth-challenged town of Rutland, Vermont, home of The College of St. Joseph (CSJ). I&apos;m in the middle of the big tour, taking the Dash For Dollars Comedy Game Show out on the road, as well as my own hilarious comedy show.
This week, I knocked two more states out of the box, New Jersey and Vermont. Believe it or not, in 20 years of doing standup comedy, I&apos;d never performed in either state, and they both border my home state of New York. Well, that monkey&apos;s finally off my back! I started out Sunday night heading south for Jersey, the town of Carneys Point to be precise, and even though it&apos;s in southern New Jersey, it is really a Philadelphia suburb. I got in rather late due to some unexpected weather that wasn&apos;t horrible but the snow was obfuscating the white lines on route 81 and I couldn&apos;t see a damn thing. By the time I got into New Jersey, everything was fine and I was off to the races.
The show went off fine, although I had to do some 11th hour prop-shopping. In the game show, we use several wacky props, and while most of them are re-used, some of them get consumed, like toilet paper and bubble gum. I set up my show, and then ran out for said props, returning with plenty of time to spare. The show was fine, but afterwards, I was bushed; I got in late the night before and really didn&apos;t wind up getting a good night&apos;s sleep, and coupling that with a 9 AM report time, I was pretty spent.
After the show, I dragged my feet and then finally packed up and headed for Newton, New Jersey, located in the northern part of the state. I didn&apos;t have a hotel reservation, as the college decided instead to provide me with a lodging stipend. The problem was that when I arrived, all the hotels were sold out. I wound up staying in a location slightly farther away from the college than I would have preferred, but even though it was a mom &apos;n&apos; pop, they had wireless internet, a fridge and microwave in the room, and all the comforts of home. They even provided shampoo.....take *that,* Motel 6!
I had a day off so I used the time productively, getting the van an oil change, doing some writing, and mostly listening to and dissecting President Obama&apos;s address to Congress. Wednesday morning, I checked out and made my way to Sussex County Community College, where my reception was warm and welcoming. They even gave me a special parking tag that allowed me to basically park right up against the building where the game show was being staged, and that was quite appreciated. The cash booth is cumbersome enough, without considering a 25 gallon storage tote full of props, the tripods and frames for the backdrop and the vinyl backdrop itself, four hula hoops and a putter....it&apos;s a pain toting all that stuff in from parts unknown!
The Monday morning show was hard, and I expected that it would be. Monday mornings, it&apos;s hard to get motivated and excited. But the Wednesday show was like pulling teeth! I couldn&apos;t predict how difficult it would be to come onto a college campus and basically give away money, and get ignored like a guy at an off-ramp with a cardboard sign that said &quot;Hungry-Homeless-Help.&quot; But there I was, begging for some sort of interaction with a crowd of students who couldn&apos;t be bothered. Oh well. Sometimes you&apos;re the windshield, sometimes you&apos;re the bug.
After the show, I headed north to Rutland, Vermont, and the College of St. Joseph where I currently reside. No game show for me this evening, rather, my own headlining set. CSJ is a small college, but the people opened their doors to me and really made me feel welcome. The advantage of the size of the school is that everyone is on a first-name basis. The school provided me with on-campus accommodations, basically a dorm room, which was perfect. I got in Wednesday night and settled in, visiting the &quot;downtown&quot; area of Rutland in search of dinner and a LAN cord to take advantage of the internet connection in the dorms. I found a decent Chinese buffet, and after dinner, retreated to the dorm for a good night&apos;s sleep.
Today, I had lunch with Rob Lukaskiewicz, the gentleman in charge of student affairs and my gracious host. We had a nice chat and spoke of many things, including the challenges of parenthood, student involvement on college campuses, and the book I&apos;m writing about standup comedy. He had his fingers crossed regarding the attendance of the show (the &quot;town hall&quot; meeting of the night before drew zero) and we were pleased that the total attendance fell just a few heads short of our goal. The show itself was staged in a beautiful 200-seat theater, and it was the type of venue I wish I had the opportunity to play in all the time. After the show, I chit-chatted with some of the students, then grabbed some sandwiches from the on-campus sub shop and retreated to my room to watch movies on DVD and of course, compose this blog.
Tomorrow, it&apos;s off to Warwick, Rhode Island, and a two-day engagement at the Comedy Zone (I&apos;ve heard nothing but good things) and then Sunday is a day off to make it to Fort Wayne, Indiana for the game show. Tuesday and Wednesday I make my way back home with gameshow dates in Cleveland and Middletown, Ohio, and then Thursday night, I&apos;ll be judging the finals of the standup comedy competition back home in Rochester. Friday night, the game show runs back up to Canton, NY (my first repeat engagement since taking the gig) and then a weekend off before heading to Connecticut, West Virginia and Virginia. March is shaping up to be a very busy month, and that&apos;s fine with me. I love the stage and the opportunity to perform for appreciative audiences. And to be completely honest, I&apos;m happy to have a job in a time when a lot of people don&apos;t, either for the want of a job or just having lost a good one. And I&apos;m doubly lucky that it&apos;s a job that&apos;s so much fun, it doesn&apos;t even feel like work.
Stay warm....the winter&apos;s almost over.

 Used Cars (Bruce Springsteen) 
Posted on 02/16/2009 at 08:51 PM
Wow. The days are starting to blend together, even more than they used to.
I&apos;ve been staying busy, and I&apos;m starting to wonder whether or not &quot;burn out&quot; is better than &quot;rust out.&quot; God knows, I&apos;ve done them both.
I only wound up doing one show at Pare Restaurant back on Saturday the 7th, but it was a good one. I worked with Rochester comics Dan Maslyn and Annette Lorenzo. The room was full, and set up just fine for comedy. I pulled out all of the air in my lungs and did an hour and 5 in the closing spot....I don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll ever be able to do to placate my love of the stage....when I get up there, I can&apos;t stop! It&apos;s a sickness! Still, it was a fine show with a lot of nice comments afterward.
Sunday morning, I packed and headed off to Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa, for another installment in the college tour of Dash For Dollars, the comedy game show. I drove all day, starting around 10:30 in the morning, and managed to escape the death-trap that is Chicago, Illinois. I was sure I would wind up hitting major traffic there, but Loren, my assistant (ok, she&apos;s the voice programmed into my Tom-Tom GPS) re-routed me further south so I didn&apos;t have to deal with it. I got in to the hotel around 2:30 in the morning, but I picked up an hour because of the time change. I slept well after the 16 hour drive, as you could imagine.
The next morning, I was up super-early, and hit the continental breakfast (you gotta love waffles) and actually attempted to hit the work-out room, but the treadmill was busted. I always have a weird feeling using hotel excercise equipment these days, as my friend Tiny expired about a year ago doing exactly the same thing. The hotel desk clerk claimed that the machine had been repaired, but I found it unplugged and when I plugged it in, it only worked for a minute or two and then the power shut off, and I decided that I didn&apos;t need more of a hint to pack it in for the day.
I checked out of the hotel and headed over to the college, where I wound up spending the day. I did a lunch-time teaser event, handing out t-shirts and money to promote the evening event, and then killed time. I set up the equipment for the show, ate lunch, and went to the bank to get the proper increments of currency for the money booth. After the show, the students from the Student Activities Board treated me to dinner and even gave me some burgers to go, and I hit the road. The first thing I did was to gas up, because Iowa is a long, wide and unforgiving state, and there is nothing happening between the major cities. There was some sort of windstorm hitting the area, and I pumped gas as the corrugated steel canopy above me at the gas station shook like it was about to come loose. The winds howled at me all the way east, and around midnight, I decided I&apos;d had enough. My destination was a Motel 6 (the preferred accomodations of the Ralph Tetta national comedy and game show tour) and I found one in Cedar Rapids. Imagine my surprise when at check-in, the desk clerk punched my driver&apos;s license information into the computer and then announced that I&apos;d stayed at that particular property before. In fact, almost two years earlier to the day. I had to think about it, and talking to my mother on the phone the next day, I realized it was the tour that killed my old Toyota Corolla back in 2007.
Tuesday, I drove back the rest of the way and managed to get home before midnight. I listened to so much talk radio I actually overdosed and by the end of the drive, I was searching frantically for a music channel that was playing something that I not only like but wasn&apos;t sick of yet. I&apos;ve spent years working in radio and there&apos;s not a lot of music I can say that for. Lately I&apos;ve been digging the Bruce Springsteen sattelite radio channel, but I know the day is going to come when I tell the Boss to take his job and shove it. It&apos;s probably going to take a long time for that to happen, because I have a ridiculous fascination with Bruce. I also agree 100% with his politics, so maybe I&apos;ll stay in the union for a while...and as long as the new albums keep holding up, I should be alright.
Thursday, I hosted at The Comedy Club in Webster, bringing the first group of semi-finalists for their in-house comedy contest to the stage, and finishing up by introducing Kris Shaw, a comedy buddy of mine from Indianapolis, Indiana. They asked me to do five minutes to warm up, and of course, I went over. It takes me five minutes to remember my jokes, much less tell them. Two of the four contestants tied, and will move on to the finals, Dan Maslyn and Pat Duffy. I&apos;m judging again this Thursday, and I&apos;m looking forward to seeing who else will advance.
Saturday, Pamela and I packed up the car, dropped Harmony over to my mother-in-law&apos;s house, and headed to the Western Ohio town of Beaverdam, for an evening comedy show on Valentine&apos;s Day. The trip got started about 90 minutes later than I had hoped, as wrangling my wife and daughter into the car is only slightly less challenging than herding cats. After much Andy Capp and Flossy fighting in the car, we made it to the Comfort Inn and I started getting ready, pressing my clothes, shaving, and getting ready for the 9 PM show. We hadn&apos;t had dinner and were trying to figure out where we could eat in a timely fashion, what with it being Valentine&apos;s Day, a Saturday, and a small town with limited options. We wound up having to go to Lima, the next largest town over, and after seeing a mob scene at the chain restaurants around the mall, opted for a Captain D&apos;s meal, which pleased my &quot;vegetarian wife who still eats seafood&quot; to no end (the actual term is pesce-vegetarian, but I like to call her a &quot;pesty vegetarian&quot;). We arrived at the club with plenty of time to spare and were pleased to see that there was a full boat in attendance.
I was working with Scott Dunn, a former Rochester home-boy (actually he worked in Batavia) who now makes his home in Indiana and he&apos;s a regular caller to the Bob and Tom radio show, and a draw in the midwest. I did my 35 minutes with relish, and had so much fun with the accomodating crowd that I had to cut set-ups and did the last 10 minutes as punchlines only. It wasn&apos;t really that bad, but it seemed like it in my head. I wound up getting a phenomenal reaction overall, the owner was pleased, and I sold a boatload of CD&apos;s and DVD&apos;s after the show. It was great.
On the trip home, we were frought with pitfalls every step of the way. I stopped at a gas station in front of the hotel to repleshish the window wash fluid in the car, and the hood wouldn&apos;t close. We drove the first 100 miles with the hood rattling and looking like it would fly up in our faces at any moment. We finally pulled into a Wal-Mart in Fremont, Ohio and got an oil change, which the car probably needed anyway (my wife&apos;s car has no documentation in that respect....no window sticker, no receipts, and no memory of when the service was done last). Along with the oil change came the added service of the technician properly clicking the hood down into a fixed position. I guess we&apos;re good until we have to get under there again, hopefully it won&apos;t be too soon. Then, of course, driving through Cleveland, we hit two pockets of snowfall that looked like we were dead in the water, and then they dried up as quickly as they came. It was bizarre. We finally made it home, and I can&apos;t remember when I&apos;ve been this tired. I took all day today to rest and recuperate, and luckily, I have no obligations until Friday, and it shouldn&apos;t be a bad excursion. I&apos;m a little concerned, because next week, the college tour really starts revving up, as well as a weekend in Rhode Island. I&apos;ll also be performing for the first time in the states of Vermont and New Jersey, two close-by states to New York that have thus far eluded my grasp.
Hopefully the weather will cooperate, and it will be an uneventful tour. I&apos;m just glad to be working, to be honest.
Thanks for reading, and be good now.

 Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out (Bruce Springsteen) 
Posted on 02/05/2009 at 10:38 PM
Helldrive 2009 is officially over. Actually, it&apos;s been over for almost a week now, but I had to get out from under some things here at home before I could even sit down and write about the experience.
Helldrive 2009 is just a cute nickname I gave a two-week tour that I just completed. I always used to say that once a year, I torture myself with a routing just to keep myself honest. Now, after 5 or 6 years of doing that, I&apos;ve entrusted the task to others, to make sure it gets done with no screw-ups.
Helldrive 2009 started on Wednesday, January 21st. Ray Salah and I were tapped to be the judges for The Comedy Club&apos;s &quot;Last Comic Sitting&quot; contest (www.thecomedyclub.us) and it was an interesting night, to say the least. I spotted stolen material from every generation of comedian from Pat Cooper all the way up to some thinly concealed Jim Gaffigan. I spotted every one of them, including evergreen theft-pots David Brenner and Lenny Bruce. I guess the rationale is that these budding comic wanna-bes are the only ones who ever listened to these records and there&apos;s no way they&apos;re gonna get nabbed. Well, they all got nabbed and none of them won.
After the show, I dropped Ray off at his house and picked up Joel Lindley for an overnight drive to Huntington, West Virginia. I&apos;ll spare you the gory details other than we got there in time for Joel to be spirited off to a radio interview and I collapsed into my sleep-number bed at the Pullman Plaza. That night, after readjusting and napping, I began my slate of shows at the Huntington Funny Bone. All I can say is &quot;wow.&quot; What a great room, great people, great staff, perfect sound and lights and stage. It was literally perfect as far as the stage being just the right size to stalk around, just the right height to be seen from everywhere in the room without rising too lofty, just everything was exactly as it should have been. I didn&apos;t have one show the whole week that I wanted back; every once in a while, I&apos;ll say something that I just shouldn&apos;t have said, and the whole show will go to shit. This week, I was like Rumpelstiltskin, weaving gold out of straw. The room really spoiled me for every other comedy club I&apos;ve had the pleasure of playing.
The Funny Bone is in a downtown mall/entertainment complex, and they have a trade-out agreement with the movie theater. I got to see Clint Eastwood&apos;s &quot;Gran Torino&quot; and I have to say that it was just excellent. The movie wasn&apos;t entirely perfect, but it surely would have gotten a nine out of 10 from me if I were asked to rate it. If you&apos;re on the fence based on reviews you&apos;ve seen or your own personal judgement of the trailers and previews, go see it and tell me I&apos;m wrong that it was an excellent performance by Clint Eastwood. If you remember the movie &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; that Eastwood did in the 80&apos;s, where he played Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway, this is like the continuing adventures of Gunny.
At the end of the weekend, namely Sunday night, Joel and I turned in our sets for the Sunday club-goers and bid farewell to snowy Huntington, piling into the car for the ride home. West Virginia was snowy and the roads were icy, winding and treacherous, but we made it home alive. I slept about two hours (!) and then got up, showered, and left again to hit the road. I picked up Ray and the van with the Dash For Dollars game show stuff in it and we headed towards Columbus, Ohio and Ohio Dominican University. Ray had even less sleep than I did, and opted to stay at the hotel and catch up with his shut-eye while I did the show. Running on adrenaline, caffeine and a sense of duty, I finished the show and returned to the hotel where I picked up Ray and we headed out for a late dinner. We found a family-style restaurant and some country cooking, and then returned to the hotel where I managed to fall asleep mid-sentence. I woke up at 5 in the morning with my stage clothes still on and my glasses askew.
The next morning, we headed off towards Chicago and managed to hit some of that horrible winter weather that was crushing the Midwest. We drove through Indianapolis, where they forgot what snowplows looked like, and pirouetted and sashayed all across the highway. By the time we reached Merrillville, Indiana, we bunked down for the night, figuring the next day would be easier as we were far enough north to be out of the storm. We got a good night&apos;s sleep and headed off early for Harold Washington College, which is located at the corner of Smack and Dab in downtown Chicago. To say that the city is congested is an understatement; parking is not only at a premium, it&apos;s expensive as hell. I wound up digging down for $50 (no lie) to park the van for the duration of my four hour work-day. The overhead train tracks wreaked havoc with my GPS and cell phone, and as hypnotizing as Chicago is from the skyline view you get when travelling west on the 90, I guess I wouldn&apos;t do very well living there with my sense of claustrophobia that I didn&apos;t even know I had.
The evening&apos;s dinner was Cracker Barrel, and food never tasted so good. It was damn near 5 PM and neither Ray nor I had eaten a bite since the day before. I had catfish and a loaf of biscuits and Ray had some sort of roast beef platter. Then we hit the road, traveling back through Indianapolis where I cashed in my Speedway loyalty card points and purchased gasoline for $1.17 a gallon. We headed south towards Cincinnati and finally, the highway turned to crap and we grabbed the first hotel we found, a Comfort Inn. The next day, we piloted our way through Kentucky and into Tennessee and some ice-storm ravaged country, but the roads were cleaned and salted and I guess it varies from community to community whether or not they can afford such luxuries as salt and plows, but the roads stayed clean well towards our final destination. We ate a Golden Corral buffet dinner (I know all the sweet restaurants, eh?) and had a little floor-show as a party who arrived just before we were about to leave bitched out a floor manager and a kitchen manager over an entire section of the restaurant that hadn&apos;t been bussed.....there were dirty dishes everywhere, and 90% of the patrons had tipped their server and gone. The young lady who was working point on this party of ten or more diners seemed nice at first, helping the one waitress who was working the section bus the tables and mentioning nicely that she had waitress ed before and knew how hard it was. They quickly cleared about three tables and shoved them together so that the party could sit down, and then she went into full puma mode, seeking out someone with a supervisor&apos;s name tag that she could dress down in the middle of the place. I looked down and away, and left my server another buck.
We kept moving until around midnight, and I managed to find a Motel 6 that I&apos;d stayed at last year in Newport, Tennessee. It was just dumb luck that I stopped at that exit for gas, and started to recognize everything from my visit last summer. This was the town that I saw the first available midnight showing of The Dark Knight, and camped out two days in between engagements for The Comedy Zone in Clarksville and Johnson City, Tennessee. The Motel 6 is super clean, and offers free internet, and that&apos;s unusual for Motel 6&apos;s, they usually try to get you to pay around $3.50 for a day&apos;s use (which isn&apos;t bad, to be honest). The next morning, we chewed up the last few hours and motored towards Salisbury, North Carolina, and Catawba College, for the last date of the Dash For Dollars tour. We set up and did a &quot;teaser&quot; for the show in the student cafeterias, and then hung out and killed time for a couple of hours until showtime. We did the show, packed up the van, and headed for home, once again hitting horrible weather in West Virginia. It seemed that the high elevations were getting horrible snow, and then we&apos;d come down a hill and everything was clear again. I drove until the Pennsylvania border and then pulled into a rest area for a couple hour&apos;s sleep.
By the time I woke up, it was daylight, and off we headed again. We stopped for gas at a Sheetz and grabbed some breakfast and dog-legged it the rest of the way home, pulling in at maybe 1 o&apos;clock or so. But it didn&apos;t end there, because Ray&apos;s driveway was full of snow and we had to shovel a spot to stow the van. I don&apos;t know what energy I was tapping because I cleared the space out in what felt like about five minutes. I transferred all of my luggage into my waiting Camry and headed home. Pam and Harmony had gone out for some children&apos;s event, story time or some such thing, I can&apos;t really remember and to be honest, when she told me what it was, I was a zombie. I tried to sleep, but that wasn&apos;t happening. I laid in bed until the alarm rang, twitching with caffeine, Red Bull and coffee, and several dark cola drinks. I showered and dressed and headed to my evening engagement, two shows at a restaurant called Patti&apos;s Pantry.
Patti&apos;s Pantry is located on Dewey Avenue in Rochester, just minutes from where I grew up. I did two 50-minute shows to a mostly middle-aged group, and had a great time doing it. There was an added bonus as a few of my friends came out to see me; the first show, Jon &quot;Lumpy&quot; Dubner, his wife, and a couple of friends surprised me. Jon was a mainstay at Yuk Yuk&apos;s, the first full-time comedy club that Rochester ever had. He was always and continues to be a good friend and a person who is filled with the stuff that good karma is made out of. He took some pictures with his digital camera and posted and tagged them on Facebook and with apologies from the source material, they were pretty good.
Second show, my good friend Mark Block came out. Mark is a former co-worker of mine in the Great Lakes Entertainment productions of Joey and Maria&apos;s Comedy Wedding, Joey and Maria&apos;s 25Th Anniversary, and the Soapranos. He is also my tax preparer, and the first and only person who has ever invited me to Passover supper. We had a good time hanging out backstage, which was really just a smaller dining room away from the main dining room, and while I wished I could have spent more time with him, I was coasting on fumes after 10 days of running myself like a dog and had to get home. I was telling my wife how things went, when apparently I fell asleep in the middle of a sentence and woke up at 5 in the morning with my stage clothes still on and my glasses askew.
All day Sunday I felt like hell, bones aching, dry mouth from all the caffeine, and of course, hating the snow and the cold which feels like it will never end. I drifted in and out from the Super Bowl, not really caring to watch Pittsburgh outgun the Cardinals. It was like watching a schoolyard bully push around a kid with asthma, only in this story, the kid with asthma actually put up a decent fight towards the end. At the end of it all, my team won......THE E-STREET BAND.
Yesterday, the cycle ended as it began, Ray and I judged another week of the competition at The Comedy Club, and today, I finished compiling paperwork for my health insurance. I feel like a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders, but the big machine starts up again on Saturday, where I do two shows in Rochester at PeRe (it&apos;s a club) and then hit the road to Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa. More of the same, but in a different order this time.
I hope the weather&apos;s good.

 Beautiful Day (U2) 
Posted on 01/20/2009 at 03:40 PM
Happy Inauguration Day! It&apos;s a wonderful day, if for only the idea that power in our nation&apos;s government passes peaceably from one man&apos;s hands to another&apos;s without bloodshed. There are certainly a lot of countries in the world today that cannot make that boast.
Harmony was under the weather today, so we kept her out of school and watched the inauguration ceremony on television. She&apos;s only four years old, so much of the broadcast was lost on her, but years from now, I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll be happy to announce that she watched the events unfold live.
I am officially sick to death of Winter. The cold weather never used to bother me, and as a matter of fact, I used to enjoy it, but lately travel has become difficult and the impact of the cold on my health and the health of my family has greatly undermined our quality of life.
On Friday the 9th, I was booked to perform a showcase in Grand Rapids, Michigan for the Smith Agency, and the agents who peddle my gameshow &quot;Dash For Dollars&quot; to colleges around the country. They wanted to see my regular standup act and what I bring to the table. The show was in a small bar/restaurant that was filled to capacity and this was despite a winter snowstorm gripping the state of Michigan. The next day, the plan was to drive home back to Rochester and enjoy the weekend with my family; no dice. The storm that was torturing Detroit was blowing snow up around the Port Huron, Michigan area, and put me at a standstill before I could cross over to Canada and cut across Ontario back to Upstate New York. I wound up at a small motor lodge in Port Huron thanks to my trusty TomTom GPS device that is able to locate hotels and points of interest. The going rate for hotels that night was around $115, and I just didn&apos;t feel like spending that kind of money. Instead, I found a motor lodge that was letting rooms go for only $35, although they were a little short on services.
For one, they had no wireless internet. For that matter, they had no phones, so I couldn&apos;t even dial up if I wanted to. The two rooms that were available, a double and a king suite, were the same price, so I told the desk clerk I would take the double. He said, &quot;Would you like to see the room first?&quot; I figured an offer like that wouldn&apos;t be tendered for no particular reason, so I took the key and headed over to room #7.
Room #7 was not better than I assumed it would be. The furniture was ramshackle at best, the bathroom a monument to neglect and a bad grout job. The deal-breaker, though, of this budget-conscious choice was the smell of the room. I could only describe it as thinking that the last renter was a man who couldn&apos;t stop peeing while he was cleaning a fish.
I returned to the desk and asked to see the king suite, and moments later, headed over to unit #4. Happily, the room didn&apos;t smell unpleasant; rather, there had been some sort of room deodorizer applied that made it smell kind of nice. The furniture wasn&apos;t any better and the bathroom was only slightly better, and I decided that this was what I was going to get for $35. 
I checked in, drove down the road to a small mini-mart and grabbed some food and bottled water, and spent the rest of the evening watching football and movies on cable. The next morning, the roads were plowed and I headed east. The roads weren&apos;t entirely clear, but I had at least a fighting chance to get home in one piece. The day before, somewhere along the way between Lansing and Flint, Michigan, I avoided a 17-car pile-up created by slick roads and cars following each other without the proper space between them.
After a few days at home, the frigid, sub-zero weather set in. I was scheduled to perform at Immaculata University in Exton, Pennsylvania, the first morning of the worst of the cold snap. I picked up my comedy buddy Ray Salah and we headed south to the Philadelphia area, stopping on the New York State Thruway to replenish the window-wash fluid. An examination of the wipers also showed that they were not in the best repair, and a stop at Target rectified that. The college was a small one, with only around 850 students, but they had a good attendance at the evening show, and the drive back was relatively painless. Ray accompanied me to another gig last week, an engagement at the Dunkirk, NY Loyal Order of Moose, with Buffalo comedians Nick Siracuse and Blaine Kelly. At first, Ray was exceedingly grumpy, but after having the time to pal around with old comedy buddies, he loosened up and enjoyed the evening. On stage, I told some real-life stories of our adventures together, which were precipitated on Ray&apos;s distinct cackle being acknowledged from the stage by both Nick and Blaine earlier in the show. The crowd had &quot;got to know&quot; Ray only from what we had said about him on stage, and I felt that the groundwork was laid to tell the stories, which went over well. On the drive back home, which was snowy, dangerous and long, we laughed about how well the bits had gone, even though I&apos;d never told those stories on stage before.
This week, it&apos;s a week-long engagement at the Funnybone in Huntington, West Virginia, and then a week of college shows, culminating in a Saturday show back in Rochester for my buddy, Danny Liberto. I&apos;m happy to be busy, because at least it&apos;s keeping my mind off of how cold I am and how much I can&apos;t wait for winter to be over.
Stay warm and be good, and make sure that when you&apos;ve driving, you give the car in front of you at least one delineation (car length) for every 10 miles of speed you&apos;re travelling.
Peace!

 Gettin&apos; Better (Tesla) 
Posted on 01/03/2009 at 12:28 AM
Good evening, and welcome to the first Tetta blog of 2009. When last you left me, I was being discharged from the hospital after having a blood clot in my left leg treated.
The last few weeks, in addition to the holidays, have been about the work of healing up and getting better while still working to support my family. I had to miss the Smith Agency Christmas Party, which I was very much looking forward to, because it was just too long a drive to safely make. I wound up doing short jaunts to the Mountainview Inn in Greensburg, Pennsylvania and the Funny Farm in Gloversville, New York, to maintain some income and semblance of normality. I have to invest in some supportive hosiery for my legs to tolerate longer road trips...I&apos;d heard of such garments, but never worn them or even to this date, seen them. That&apos;s on my list of &quot;things to do&quot; for this week.
I was aware of a big-ass snowstorm heading towards Western New York the day before the Greensburg date, and had made arrangements to drive down early, thus missing the storm, but couldn&apos;t take advantage of their offer to check into the hotel a day early because I had a mandatory blood-draw the next day. I&apos;m on a blood thinner called Coumadin (generic equivalent Warfarin) and it&apos;s completely hit-or-miss when they prescribe the medication because everyone&apos;s blood is different and you can&apos;t just go by height and weight. Too weak a dose, and blood clots could reoccur. Too strong a dose, and your blood becomes thin enough that a small cut will keep bleeding until you die. They want to see a coagulation rate between 2 and 3. My previous draw had shown a level of 3.2, so I was told to back off the medication. As I drove through the storm on Friday morning, I was contacted and told my level had rocketed to 4.8, definitely going in the wrong direction, and was told to discontinue the medication and then pick up again in half-doses. I had gotten to the lab Friday morning when they opened at 9:00 A.M., gave them the blood they required and drove off into the storm.
The drive from Rochester to Buffalo and then southwest to the Pennsylvania border usually takes about two hours. On Friday, it took a full 4 1/2 hours to make the trip, and the trip was fraught with terror. Ice kept building up on my windshield, and I had to do that scam where you grab the windshield wiper out your driver&apos;s side window and thwap! it across the windshield to break off the ice. In doing so, I snagged a fingernail and tore it, and went nuts trying to find a pair of nail clippers (that I always have with me). I found them in my travel bag and gave myself an emergency manicure, and when I put everything back, I buried my cell phone and then went nuts, thinking it had fallen out of my pocket at the Kwik-Fill. When I finally arrived in Greensburg, I was tired, shaky, unshaven, but on time with two hours to spare. The weather in Greensburg when I arrived was 54 degrees and raining.
The gig was cool, and even though it was a small crowd. I worked with &quot;Big Al&quot; Goodwin, and we got along nicely, talking shop and finally putting a human being together with the headshot I&apos;d seen on comedy club walls across the country. After the show, I had to move my room because the room they gave me had no heat, and even though it was a beautiful old historic hotel with amazing fixtures, it was just too cold to be comfortable. They were able to move me with no problems, and I spent the night, hoping the New York State Thruway would be cleared off the next morning.
On Saturday, I hit the road as early as possible, which was 10:30 after showering and packing. The drive was clear and the snow started falling again when I pulled into Rochester. I gassed up and got home, taking 45 minutes to change clothes and begin the drive to Gloversville, NY. On the way, I picked up Steve Natarelli, a Rochester area comic, and we headed to the Funny Farm. We got there about 40 minutes before showtime after speeding in the snow on the back roads of Wayne County and finally joining some of the holiday traffic on the Thruway. The show was sparsely attended due to a Christmas Party cancellation, but we had fun and the comics on the bill did their job. My middle act was John Briggs, a &quot;smart&quot; comic from the Capital District, and some of the other comics from the area hosted and did guest spots. I got Steve a spot and he did very well. When I hit the stage, I&apos;d just let it fly based on being in the car all damn day, and it was fun and funny. Opener Jon Hausmann sent me the following letter:
Granted it&apos;s a sample of THREE appearances, but last night was easily your best night there, in spite of the single-digit audience. Maybe you should strive to be exhausted and disoriented ALL the time. Same was true of Briggs. I&apos;ve now seen him so many times - he was &apos;ON&apos; last night. Don&apos;t know why.
I emceed there last week - audience was about 80 people (including, surprise to me - my BOSS&apos;S BOSS) - and they were DEAD. Not the comics&apos; fault - they audience was just catatonic. The only reactions Headliner Greg Aidala was able to get from them was by swearing liberally at them. Seemed to work - didn&apos;t even need punch lines, just channel Redd Foxx and they laughed. Seemed like a DEF Comedy Jam show I watched once in which my wife and I looked at each other and said &quot;What the hell are they LAUGHING at?&quot;.
Anyway- you did good last night, not that it matters to Sylvia, but at least you gave 100% to those that came. I liked your bit about &quot;knocking on doors&quot;, although in Gloversville after 2 or 3 doors they&apos;d probably run you right out of the trailer park. - Jon
I like the Funny Farm, but it seems every time I go there, it&apos;s a holiday, or Mother&apos;s Day, or some such crowd-killing circumstance. Maybe it&apos;s just the luck of the draw, but Sylvia and Rich are fine hosts, and it&apos;s a gig, so we run with it.
Christmas weekend, it was a triumphant return to Rochester and the new comedy club in Webster, NY called &quot;The Comedy Club&quot; (http://www.thecomedyclub.us/) and a feature spot with Rochester&apos;s own Joel Lindley. We had a very funny guy named Patrick Dodd do a spot on the Friday early show, and even though he&apos;s from Rochester (and brought about 50 friends and family members with him), I&apos;d never seen him work as he got into comedy only after moving to Atlanta. He rocked the room, and it was a great show.
Saturday night, it was a &quot;Comix Cafe reunion show&quot; at the late show. It wasn&apos;t a true reunion because the club had quite a bit of turnover in the 10 years they were open, so it was mostly the new incarnation of the staff, many of which currently work at the Webster club. They were good &apos;n&apos; hammered by showtime, and it caused a little disturbance in the showroom from their table talk, but it was nice to see a lot of the old faces again.
The rest of the week was sponsored by Danny Liberto of the Comedy Company, as I did a spot at his open mic at the Otter Lodge in Brighton, and then headlined his show at the Raddison hotel in Corning, NY the next evening with D-Lo Danny Brown in support. The open mic was packed, and I mean packed, and during the first comic&apos;s set (a guest spot by Rochester&apos;s own Sky Sands), local comic Billy T. Anglin and I hauled chairs out of the back room to accommodate the couple of dozen people who found themselves standing. It was a great audience to work in front of, and it was only the shear number of comics that caused some folks to have to leave early. The gig in Corning was fun, although it was less like comedy and more like work. Pamela made the 90-minute ride with me and upon entering the showroom, I knew it would be tough as the hotel had already put noisemakers on the tables (the ENEMY of New Year&apos;s Eve comedy shows)-anyone with any NYE savvy knows that you don&apos;t hand those out until after the show&apos;s over. I taped, but it was a highly distracted audience, and not a show that I would want to save. At one point, I addressed a table in the back that were talking to each other the way you&apos;d talk to people at a rock concert; loud and with no consideration of the people around you. After asking them if there was a problem, quite a few table basically told them to shut the fuck up, and then I spent a few minutes berating the drunkest of the table. I&apos;d worked the room for Danny before and always had a great time, but these folks were not focused in any way for comedy, so we just got the money and then enjoyed New Year&apos;s Eve. Danny and D-Low chose to head back to Rochester, and Pamela and I sought out a Denny&apos;s (the only food available that time of the night), and celebrated by over-tipping the waitress for pancakes and a club sandwich.
Today it was back to the business of maintaining my health, and an early-morning blood draw showed my blood with a coagulation rate of 2.6, pretty much perfect. I met with my doctor later in the day, and he was pleased with the results. He took me off of three of the medications I&apos;m on, including Januvia, which was costing me around $260 a month. I&apos;m happy to be out from under any medications, including that costly little fucker. I just have to keep doing what I&apos;m doing in terms of diet, and step up my exercise, which shouldn&apos;t be all that hard, although my left foot still has some swelling and that&apos;s made me just a little tentative about taking up the treadmill again. I just have to be creative and figure out how to work some upper body into the mix so that I&apos;m not depending on just my legs to help me work up a sweat. The tour begins again with a club appearance in Grand Rapids, Michigan next Friday, and then the college tour starts up again with a &quot;Dash For Dollars&quot; show in Pennsylvania, and then I picked up a week at the Funny Bone in Huntington, West Virginia, courtesy of my pal, Joel Lindley. See kids, it&apos;s all networking in this business.
So belated holiday greetings to anyone I might have missed this season, we got our Christmas cards out on the fly because of my stay in the hospital, and didn&apos;t mean to stand anyone up. The good news is that I&apos;m still here, still strong, and looking forward to being around for a long time.

P.S. Not bragging, but I just did the books for 2008, and I actually showed growth over 2007, and that&apos;s even with a drastically reduced income from the sale of souvenir merchandise. I guess I&apos;m in show business for at least another year. Peace, y&apos;all!

 Hotel Illness (The Black Crowes) 
Posted on 12/18/2008 at 01:06 PM
What if you were about to die but didn&apos;t know it? Just didn&apos;t have a clue?
That&apos;s where I was last week, on Tuesday night. I was hanging out at Danny Liberto&apos;s open mic at the Otter Lodge and hanging around with friends, doing some comedy, having a whiskey and living my life. And I had a swollen foot.
It was no big deal. It didn&apos;t hurt. I&apos;d had some leg problems going back to Halloween, but I was getting around. I thought it was fallen arches. I had fallen arches before, and you recover. You do the stretching exercises, put some arch supports in your shoes, and away you go.
I&apos;m diabetic, so foot care is always right in the forefront. My wife said &quot;You need to get that looked at.&quot; I needed to make an appointment to see my doctor anyway, as I had prescriptions that he didn&apos;t want to renew until he saw me again. I got one that very morning.
When I arrived, he looked at the foot, and after I described my month-long leg pain, he decided that I was in danger of having a blood clot. I was sent hustling over to the ultrasound department at Rochester General Hospital, where I was born 42 years ago, and the ultrasound showed that indeed, I had a blood clot in my left leg that was restricting blood flow and causing my left foot to swell.
Blood clots are tricky things, I&apos;ve learned. They float up and down the leg, sometimes they get stuck, and sometimes they go right to the lungs and give you what&apos;s called a pulmonary embolism. That&apos;s a bad thing. The lungs actually protect clots from going to the brain, but sometimes they do, and that&apos;s called a stroke.
I was admitted immediately.
My wife joined me, and before I knew it, I was in a wheelchair and going through hospital admissions. The woman who checked me in, Luda, was an older lady and very nice. After talking for a while, she recognized me. She had come to a show at the Comix Cafe (my old home club) on a Sunday night, they sat in the front, and I picked on her husband. After looking at the photographs on her office wall, the whole night came back to me; it was a Sunday, they sat to the left of the stage, so my right looking out to the audience, and her husband had his chair turned away, which is why I gave him grief to begin with. I thought, &quot;what are the odds?&quot; Well, I was in my hometown, where I&apos;ve worked steadily for ten years or more, so I guess the odds were pretty good.
I was wheeled into a room on the fourth floor, into the area they call 4200. I was in a shared room with another patient, a gentleman named Rick who was recovering from back surgery. Rick had a lot of visitors, and long story short, his daughter Lisa recognized my voice from behind the curtain that separated us as we had worked together in the research department of WCMF radio about 15 years ago. We laughed and caught up, and that was two episodes of being recognized in the short span of just an hour or two.
I was due to start treatment Wednesday night with an intravenous drip of a drug called Heparin, which is a blood thinner. The young lady, whose name escapes me, had to put the IV into my left arm, and apparently I have rhino skin or something, because she had a hell of a time getting the needle through my dermis, and then the vein kept &quot;jumping&quot; or &quot;rolling&quot; and she couldn&apos;t get the IV in.
I&apos;ve never been good with medical procedures and I hate needles (I&apos;d be the lousiest junkie ever....&quot;Does heroin come in a pill?&quot;) and while the nurse dug and dug into my arm, I started going into traumatic shock. I know, because I&apos;ve gone into shock before...the symptoms are basic. First, there&apos;s the feeling of nausea. Next, there&apos;s the cold sweat. Finally, shortness of breath takes over. The nurse removed the needle and they elevated my legs and instructed me to breathe. That&apos;s how worked-over I was, they had to remind me to breathe. If you have to be reminded to breath, some hellacious shit is happening to you.
Once I was back to normal, she tried again, and this attempt was far more successful. I ate dinner and sent my wife home with a list of some personal items I would need for my hospital stay; a book I&apos;m reading (&quot;Anansi Boys&quot; by Neil Gaiman), a sudoku book, underwear (to help maintain some sense of modesty under the hospital&apos;s gowns, who are designed for no one&apos;s comfort or pleasure) and personal items. I chatted with Rick through the curtain, as he was on some sort of steroids and was having trouble falling asleep. I had my own problems; I&apos;d never been hospitalized before, much less for a &quot;deep vein thrombosis,&quot; and a description of it as &quot;going in through the groin area&quot; did nothing for my customer confidence. They brought me water in a Styrofoam cup, and after I drank the water, I nervously inscribed the cup with a ballpoint pen, writing down my wife and daughter&apos;s names, a quote from Winston Churchill&apos;s &quot;we shall fight them in the fields, we shall defend our island&quot; speech, song lyrics, and joke that I wrote for Mitch Hedberg that he died before he could consider using. I was scheduled for my procedure at 8:00 A.M., and drifted off to sleep around midnight.
The next morning, a barrage of nurses, doctors, food service workers and the like started invading the room, quashing any thoughts I had of sleeping in. They woke me at 7 A.M., an hour before my procedure. Well, like in show business, very little in the hospital starts on time. I went to the procedure about quarter to twelve, only shy of four hours later from the scheduled time. I didn&apos;t mind, because any delay of a needle in my groin was fine with me.
I was rolled down to the room where such procedures are done, and they flopped me onto an operating table, face down. I joked around with the team that was working on me, and to my surprise, they did not have to go into my groin, but rather, through the back of my knee and down near my ankle. I&apos;m not going to pretend to be any sort of medical professional, but basically, the procedure was to blast the clot with anticoagulant and then soak the pieces with anticoagulant, hoping to dissolve them. Long story short, the procedure went so well, instead of sending me to intensive care for monitoring (the original plan), I was sent back to the recovery room in 4200. The only problem was that they had given away my bed. I wound up in a private room, where I spent the next four and half days.
Pamela came to visit me, bringing me all the things I would need for my stay, including my laptop. The hospital had wireless Internet (thank God) and daily newspaper delivery to the rooms on request. Honestly, it was like being in a hotel they way they took care of me. I met a great number of people, all who were exceptional in their care of me, including Kristina, Brandi, Robert, Julie, Jessica S., Mallory, Sarah and Alex. Everyone was amazing, and no one ever left my room without asking me if there was anything I needed or that they could get for me.
I sleep with a CPAP machine because I have sleep apnea, and someone from Respiratory Services showed up every day to make sure that things were working properly. Someone from Nutrition came and went over the daily menu with me, and explained to me that if there was something on the menu I didn&apos;t like, that I could call and get something switched around, and if I was still hungry, there was room service available until 8:00 P.M. I decided that their menu (customized to my diabetic profile) was nutritionally balanced enough that I didn&apos;t want to mess with it, and never took them up on their room service offer. Pam brought me some Combos pretzel snacks at my request, because the one rap on hospital food that I have is everything is very soft and there&apos;s no variation in texture. I guess if my client base had an average age somewhere between 65 and deceased, I&apos;d slop out the creamed corn, too.
I was released on Tuesday afternoon after the Coumadin I was receiving hit the proper level, and I was excited to be going home. All day on Tuesday and Wednesday, I was weak as a kitten, my muscles protesting due to their inactivity for almost a week. I think I&apos;ll be back to full fighting strength this weekend, when I have two gigs close to home, but I had to cancel my Western Canada trip for January that I was very much looking forward to, because I have to go to a blood lab twice a week as they monitor my anticoagulants and make sure that the concentration is therapeutic enough to make a difference, but not so effective that I bleed to death when I nick myself shaving.
I have a feeling it&apos;s going to be a long, cold winter as I adjust to this new wrinkle in my health profile, but I&apos;m glad to be alive and I&apos;ve started catching up on lost time, putting up Christmas cards here at the apartment, fishing the small artificial tree down from the attic, and getting ready to enjoy the holiday season.
Thanks to everyone who checked in on me while I was languishing in the hospital, to everyone on my health care staff (don&apos;t forget to come and see me at the Comedy Club in Webster [www.thecomedyclub.us] on December 26th and 27th), and I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday season!

 White Christmas (Crash Test Dummies) 
Posted on 12/08/2008 at 05:07 PM
Wow, it feels like life is a little back to normal.
I&apos;m home from visiting my mother in Florida, and the three days were just full of phone calls, doctor&apos;s appointments, trips to the hardware store, and a lot of love, helping my mother mend after her horrific car accident.
Frankly, the details of the accident were grim. The accident occurred at night, and she was struck by two separate vehicles, both on her driver&apos;s side door, the first spinning her around so the second could strike her again. I don&apos;t know the details, but as I understand it, both vehicles were going at least 55 mph (mom&apos;s Jeep Cherokee going much slower as it entered the highway), the impact gave her a concussion, knocked her wig off of her head, knocked her glasses off of her face, and she lost a lot of blood before being taken by helicopter to Orlando Regional Medical Center.
Today, she wears an arm sling to help relieve the pressure on her crushed clavicle (near the collarbone) and she features no other signs of being in an accident at all except for some stitches on the left side of her head, a few inches above the temple.
According to my sister, who had time to investigate the wrecked remains of the Jeep, the floor compartment on the driver&apos;s side of the vehicle was crushed to within eight inches in width, and yet Mom has no leg injuries.
My sister went immediately to Florida from her home in North Carolina to be with mom, and when she left, I arrived and stayed for a few days. My brother Christopher relieved me, and stayed until today, when my sister arrives and he&apos;ll go back to Syracuse. I&apos;m on the next stay, whenever that may be.
We lost our father almost two years ago. I guess that fresh scar moved us all a little quicker to rush to Mom&apos;s side. I was just there a month ago, cooling my heels on a few days off from my college tour, and taking advantage of the rent-free guest room. We always have a good visit, and this was my third time visiting Mom this year. Having the gypsy job that I do offers me more flexibility to make such excursions, and now that I&apos;m in my 40&apos;s, I treasure the time with family so much more than I used to when I was a young buck trying to make a name for myself, and now I&apos;m just trying to make a buck, having discovered that my name has limited value.
Mom&apos;s name is Linda. But to a generation of comedians working in Rochester, she was always &quot;Mom.&quot; When I started doing open mics at Yuk Yuk&apos;s in the Olde Rochesterville section of town, mom used to tag along, and to my horror, sit in the front row at open mic night. Then she would talk to every comic that addressed her from the stage, completely obliterating any credibility I would have as a performer. When you&apos;re a comic, you&apos;re supposed to be this hip, swinging smart-ass, not the guy who&apos;s mom is sitting in the front row! But the truth be told, I wasn&apos;t hip, I didn&apos;t swing, and I was more smart than smart-ass, which doesn&apos;t always translate to laughs. I protested, but Mom kept coming out to shows, until she was a staple, a household name among the comics. I just had to get used to it.
My mom loved comedy. For mother&apos;s day, I used to give my poor, tired father a break and take Mom to the Yuk Yuk&apos;s in Niagara Falls, a 90 minute drive, and we&apos;d see the comedians there on a Sunday night. She loved those shows, and I enjoyed using my connections as a Yuk Yuk&apos;s comic to talk my way into the comps.
A bunch of us &quot;new jacks&quot; formed an improv troupe, The Inner Loop. We started doing improv comedy on our own night at Yuk Yuk&apos;s, by that time the club had gone independent and was named &quot;Hiccup&apos;s.&quot; Mom didn&apos;t attend many of our shows, but sometimes accompanied us on out-of-town gigs (there weren&apos;t many of them) as her schedule allowed. We had posters made up to promote our shows, and after one show, we all autographed one of them and gave it to Mom, and she still has the thing, along with one of our group headshots....we changed personnel so many times, I can&apos;t tell you what version of the group it was, but the headshot is framed and sitting on her dresser.
The group has long since been scattered to the four winds (our one long-standing gig, the First Night celebration in Binghamton, NY passed us over this year, probably because they&apos;d had us four years in a row and needed some variety) but they live forever at my mom&apos;s house, on the dresser and on the wall.
Well, as the situation would turn out, Mom has let some of her finances get away from her in the past couple of years, and my sister and brother and I have used much of the time with her to &quot;untangle the Christmas lights.&quot; I wonder sometimes, if this non-fatal (yet scary, violent and jarring) car accident wasn&apos;t God intervening and saying to the three of us &quot;your mother needs help, get down to Florida!&quot; I believe in God and believe that when terrible things happen to people, they happen for a distinct reason. It&apos;s like the story of Lazarus in the Bible; Lazarus was sick and everyone called Jesus to go and help his friend, but Jesus dilly-dallied for a few days and when he got there, Lazarus was dead. Jesus then performed on of the miracles, raising Lazarus from the dead, as if to say &quot;your request of me is so small; you ask me to heal the sick, when I am willing and able to raise the dead for you.&quot; Jesus let a terrible thing happen to reaffirm his love (and power) to the people that trusted him. I guess God could have just reached my brother and sister and I in a different way, but this car accident was his way of ringing the bell. It certainly got our attention, and we&apos;ve all gone to visit and started the heavy lifting of getting mom back on track. (The story of Lazarus is in John 11:1-45 if you&apos;re interested in reading the story).
So, I made it back to Rochester in time to fulfill my weekend obligations, a Friday morning appointment and a Friday night show in Pennellville, NY with Steve Natarelli and Annette Lorenzo that was just smashing. We were working at Monirae&apos;s in Pennellville, which is just outside of Syracuse, NY. It was a bitter cold night, but we had a good crowd and they turned out to be a lively bunch. I was headlining and early in my set, addressed a heckler that wound up being the owner. I went deep into him, prompting one of the servers to ask me to stop talking about her parents having sex...the two servers were the owners&apos; daughters, and that lead to a whole other line of comedy. I had a great time, sold a good number of souvenir CD&apos;s after the show, and look forward to my next booking with Danny Liberto and The Comedy Company (http://www.noclowns.com/), a New Year&apos;s Eve show in Corning, New York.
Saturday, I was the entertainment for a holiday office party for Hospitality Restaurant Group, the owners and operators of the Taco Bell/Pizza Hut/Kentucky Fried Chicken Restaurants in Upstate New York. I had a great time, even with a small sound system problem (the people in the back couldn&apos;t hear me) that was corrected by Johnny-on-the-spot DJ Steven Turner. I had requested a long, corded microphone because I do some bits with the microphone cord, but the room was set up the long way, so the cordless mic that Steven provided was more appropriate. I set them up with some &quot;canned&quot; material, and then went into the stuff they really liked....going through the audience and improvising material with them. Without going into too much detail, it was a great experience, the big boss seemed delighted. Anyhow, Steven was the guy who recommended me to the group in the first place, having seen me do my thing at another event, and turnabout is fair play, so if you&apos;re interested in a top-notch DJ, a real craftsman who doesn&apos;t just come in and spin tunes but someone who really controls the mood and tempo of an event, Steven Turner at Turner Music Productions is your guy. The website is http://www.tmpdj.com/ or call him at 585-663-3948. His website features audio samples of his work as well as an avalanche of testimonial letters from happy clients.
I took Sunday off to decompress and slept like I never slept before. My mother-in-law was watching my daughter and my wife was off at a craft show, so I was able to sleep into the afternoon. After being non-stop go for ten days, I needed the break. I resisted the temptation to watch the Buffalo Bills play their game in Toronto (that I *knew* they were going to lose) and instead, picked my daughter up and took her shopping and out to lunch and spent some good &quot;daddy&quot; time with her. I figure after being away from home so much, she deserved my undivided attention, and we had a good time. We even went to Taco Bell and had a nice lunch....Harmony&apos;s a sucker for the beans!
This week, it&apos;s a long week off to try and get the house back in order, and Saturday I&apos;m working a Christmas party up in the North Country of New York...in the town of Massena, where I&apos;ve played a few times before in my 20-year career. I don&apos;t know the name of the group or the showtime or any of the details because I&apos;m waiting on the itinerary from the booker, but it&apos;s a full week away and I&apos;m not gonna sweat it until Thursday....that leaves only one more business day to reasonably get in touch with the booker, who is also a comic, and they will probably be on the road and hard to reach after Thursday.
So in the meantime, it&apos;s drag out the tree, put up the garland, light the candles, do the dishes, all that good holiday stuff, and start getting into the spirit of the season!
Here&apos;s hoping that you don&apos;t have to be prodded by a catastrophe to visit your loved ones, or reach out and contact them. Cherish them while you have them, especially this time of year.

 A Quick One While He&apos;s Away (The Who) 
Posted on 12/01/2008 at 02:24 PM
Just a weekend wrap-up while the girls are gone.
I got home o.k. last night, even though it rain/snowed all the way home from Toronto. Border was an afterthought, the guard looked at my passport, asked me two questions and back home in New York I went. The exchange rate was terrible on Canadian money....on Wednesday, I cashed $50 U.S. and got $52.25 CDN for it. Last night, Sunday, I cashed $553 CDN and got a $440 U.S. and some change. I haven&apos;t done the math yet, but I think either the rate changed or duty-free had their way with me.
Great shows this week, even the last one. Absolute Comedy is extremely supportive of their loyal locals (don&apos;t perform at a stage too close to them, though, or it&apos;s off to the Gulag...). I met and/or shared the stage with some very funny people this week; Eric Clifford, Dan Bruzzi, Doug Brown, Curtis Blakely, Elaine (ED) Dandy, Brendan McKeigan, Ryan Maglonob, Perry Perlmutar, Dred Lee, and Steven Sharpe. We had decent attendance, although some shows they pulled the curtain to cordon off the back section, which made the room nice &apos;n&apos; cozy. My favorite moment of the week-talking to two older ladies who were waiting for their salad, and then leaving the stage to go back to the kitchen to try and help. Just another example of thinking on the balls of my feet, which I love (although sometimes more than the audience does).
So now I have one day to prepare before I fly down to Florida. I&apos;ve gone through my prescription of antibiotics so hopefully this upper respiratory infection that&apos;s been kicking my ass all month is a thing of the past. Then after a few days with Mom, it&apos;s fly back home and get to work again, one public show and one private show. This non-stop-go stuff is starting to catch up with me and I guess burnout is better than rust-out (the opposite of burnout....didn&apos;t know that, didja?) but I&apos;d rather have a steady diet of just enough stress.
So cheers to all, and I&apos;ll write again soon.

 Cold Metal (Iggy Pop) 
Posted on 11/29/2008 at 06:23 PM
I&apos;m going to keep this blog short and you&apos;ll understand why after reading it. My mother was in a car accident on Tuesday night. I found out about it when I got home and checked my e-mail, and one of her friends from the gated community she lives in sent me a message with the phone number of the hospital she was taken to.
Long story short, it was a bad wreck. She was hit on the driver&apos;s side of her vehicle, a Jeep Cherokee, while attempting to make a left hand turn. The impact spun her into the other lane, and she was hit again. She suffered a concussion, broken collarbone, and needed stitches on her head. The car was opened with the jaws of life and she was taken by helicopter from Leesburg, Florida to the Orlando Medical Center.
There&apos;s no reason she should be alive today, but she is. And all of this took place two days before Thanksgiving.
My sister scrapped her holiday plans and flew immediately down to Florida, and she&apos;ll be there until Tuesday of next week, and I&apos;m going down Tuesday morning and staying until Thursday. I&apos;d stay longer, but I have commitments in New York, so I&apos;ll be flying back home for the weekend, and then most probably returning the week after.
I&apos;m performing in Toronto at Absolute Comedy, my first appearance here ever. I booked it specifically so that I could work a decent week somewhere, and Canada celebrates their Thanksgiving back in October, so it was a good move at the time. Unfortunately, now I&apos;m away from my family in Rochester and worried sick about my mother. Besides the health issues involved, this accident is sure to take a financial toll on her, and that&apos;s really on my mind because I&apos;m just barely making it and not in any shape to help her out if things get rough.
So here I am, in a beautiful city at a beautiful new club, trying to make a good first impression with the weight of the world on my shoulders and sick to my stomach about it.
I&apos;m thankful my mother is alive. I&apos;m thankful that I&apos;m working, and can go spend time with her, if only for a few days. I&apos;m thankful that my brother and sister are pitching in. I&apos;m thankful that my wife understands what I&apos;m going through and can continuously do without my time and attention, even though she has to do it all the time.
I keep telling myself that God doesn&apos;t hand us anything we can&apos;t handle, but lately the load&apos;s looking awfully cumbersome.
I&apos;m not writing this to bring you down, dear reader. Believe me, I&apos;ve struggled since Wednesday about writing at all, and if I did write, exactly what should I say? I thought about writing about anything else, but the indecision left me frozen, so I wrote nothing.
I have two shows tonight, and one tomorrow, and then I drive the three hours back home. I&apos;ll spend a day doing laundry and spending just a little time with my wife and daughter, and then Tuesday morning I&apos;ll fly to my mother&apos;s side. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll do while I&apos;m down there, I guess I&apos;ll just do what&apos;s needed. My sister, who has the strength of Hercules for this sort of thing, has already laid plenty of groundwork, so I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll have a list of things for me to do.
I&apos;ve never felt weaker or less prepared in my life, and it&apos;s scaring the hell out of me.
I suppose I could have written anything else here, rather than show my vulnerability now, but for what purpose? So that you would think better of me?
I&apos;ve always chosen honesty, to the point of bluntness, and let the chips fall where they may. I&apos;m not going to change that now.
I&apos;m off to go be funny now. Thank you for reading.

 Thank You (Led Zeppelin) 
Posted on 11/23/2008 at 07:44 PM
Back home after a week of work, and feeling guilty about blogging....isn&apos;t that funny? Blogging is the most self-indulgent thing you can do without hand lotion, and when you don&apos;t do it, you feel this guilt, as though there were droves of people hanging on your every post, and when you don&apos;t write anything for a long time, it&apos;s as though their lives stop because they don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing or what&apos;s on your mind. Luckily, I harbor no misconceptions of my &quot;fan base&quot; or &quot;readership&quot; or whatever you want to call it. My guilt comes from my adoption of a regular blog as a clearinghouse for events as my life, as a document that my daughter can go back and read when she&apos;s older to understand what Daddy was doing when he went to work, and my inability to keep that task up with any regularity.
This week was a busy one, and performed in the throes of walking pneumonia, upper respiratory infection, or whatever the final diagnosis turned out to be. I was popping Mucinex, trying to stay phlegm-free, and certain I was infecting everyone around me. Monday, I set off for Niagara University in Niagara Falls, New York, with comedy buddy Ray Salah in tow. We made the 90 minute journey with little difficulty, and loaded in the &quot;Dash For Dollars&quot; gear into the student union. While leisurely setting up the props for the game show, Ray was fiddling with the sound system, and playing some pre-show music to set the ambiance. A group filed in and asked us if we would turn down the music, as they were doing some sort of poster presentation. We obliged, and the young lady continued to speak, as if we somehow hadn&apos;t fully acquiesced to their wishes. Come to find out, the group was under the impression that they had reserved the space for their event, and viewed us as interlopers, and as she went into her pitch to somehow get me to understand that I wasn&apos;t supposed to be there, I explained that I was an off-campus concern, basically a vendor, and that I was hired by Student Activities to be there, and that if there was a conflict, I was just the hired help and merely doing what I was instructed by the folks who contracted me to be there. She disappeared into the Student Activities office, and shortly after, her group hit the bricks.
Now, I&apos;m not one to piss on campus activism. The poster presentation that the young lady (who as it turns out, was a member of the schools faculty) and her group had planned on displaying had something to do with peace in the Middle East. I&apos;m all for peace in the Middle East, the Far East, the Near East, and even back here in North America. But I really question how effective the poster presentation would have been in bringing about peace. Were the warring factions represented here in New York? Were there enough members of the groups present in Niagara Falls to constitute a quorum? How many of them were on campus at Niagara University? And finally, how many of them would luck have to be present in the student union at lunchtime? I suppose the answer to these questions are moot, but in all fairness, if you want peace in the Middle East, I think the minimum requirement is that you actually go there to drum some of it up. I am a pragmatist, if I am nothing.
Tuesday, Ray and I made our way to Finger Lakes Community College, and a blizzard was gripping the Finger Lakes region of New York. We were driving the company vehicle, a Ford E150 van containing the Incredible Cash Cube, the centerpiece of the Dash For Dollars game show, which doesn&apos;t carry much weight as the cube is mostly air when it comes right down to it. Vehicles were colliding on the slick roads leading into Canandaigua, and we fish-tailed a couple of times on our way down, but remained on the road the whole time and arrived in a safe and timely fashion (two of the best ways to arrive, in my opinion). The show was in danger of not being very well attended until I decided to prime the pump a little bit, intruding into the student cafeteria adjacent to our performing space and throwing out dollar bills at random. In the business, we call this a &quot;teaser,&quot; and even though no such event was scheduled, I decided that it would be a good idea. It paid off in spades, and by showtime, the event area was full of students ready and raring to compete for the money. One of the funniest moments of the show was when a game involved blowing up balloons, and one of the contestants was a young man with an assortment of piercing appliances in his lower lip. It was awkward, and led to some good comedic interplay, and he actually wound up passing that particular round and moving on in the competition.
Later that night, after returning to Rochester, Ray and I decided that with the snow that was hitting the southern part of New York, we ought to get into town early, as the next gig was in Olean, NY and they were getting their fair share of crappy weather. We took off and got into town early, slept over at the wonderful Hampton Inn (I am a whore for the Hampton Inn) and were only blocks away from Jamestown Community College, Olean Campus, the next morning. When I checked in, there was a poster on the front desk with my face on it, as I was scheduled to perform in town on Saturday doing my own standup comedy show. It was neat to check in and point to the poster and tell the desk clerk, &quot;I&apos;m checking in, that&apos;s me right there.&quot; JCC is a very small satellite campus, being only a cluster of four buildings in the downtown Olean area. We still had a good showing, and with the help of a diligent maintenance man who was willing to use his power tools to disassemble doors for us, we were able to roll the Incredible Cash Cube directly into our performance area instead of just putting it in the hallway, as the Student Activities Director informed us was done on the game show&apos;s last appearance at the school. I&apos;m willing to do whatever a client wants to make them happy, but I am still a showman at heart, and I know that having the entire game show set in the performance area is a basic minimum to having a successful show. Again, the show went great, there was good attendance, and everyone had a good time. The drive back to Rochester was pleasant, with temperatures in the 50&apos;s, and no sign that snow had ever fallen in the area.
Thursday night, I was on my own, and I made my way to the State University of New York (SUNY) Canton. It was about a four hour trip, and I really dragged my feet as the grip of whatever illness I was harboring made me lazy, sluggish, and belabored my breathing. I made my report time with a few minutes to spare, and did a teaser in the dining hall where everyone was enjoying a buffet-style Thanksgiving dinner. I&apos;m not going to lie and tell you that the glistening steam tables of turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy and pumpkin pie didn&apos;t distract me at all. My antidote was to perform the teaser as quickly as possible, throw the money around, and get the hell out of there.
With the help of some student volunteers, I set up the show and got ready. I was met with a boisterous, crazy audience who went from highly involved and interested to absolutely volatile. I think if they could have just collectively picked me up, held me upside down and shook me until all the money came spilling out of my pockets, they would have. Large, athletic men were karate chopping young ladies out of the way to get a dollar. People were threatening my life and telling me in so many words that there was no way the cash cube and I were leaving campus with any money to show for it, and one young lady (who, by the way, was a contestant on stage who had her chance to win money, but was eliminated in one of the challenges) criticized me that I wasn&apos;t paying enough attention to her section, the far left-hand side of the stage. I throw money right-handed, so she may have had a point, but throwing money is completely to my discretion. I started having second thoughts about my populist views as I realized that the core of many people&apos;s psychological makeup is greed, and worse than that, a sense of entitlement. I finished the show and on the way home, I stopped at a Subway sandwich shop and had a spicy Italian sub that was in no way, shape or form as good as turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes.
Friday was my only day off, and I packed all of my errands into it. First off was trip to the doctor and a prescription for antibiotics to finally start fighting off my illness which had been a thorn in my flesh since before Halloween. Next, a trip to the post office and my local comic book shop, Comics Etc., to pick up a month&apos;s worth of reading material that I&apos;d missed as I&apos;d been out of town since before Halloween. I stopped by Monroe Community Hospital where Pammey was doing a craft show and swapped our cars, and then took her car in to be diagnosed as to why her sunroof was allowing not just sunlight but rainwater to come in. The prognosis, if you&apos;re curious, was bad lifters in the back of the unit and some body rust in the roof of the vehicle. We have an appointment in December to get the unit replaced, which will provide my wife and daughter with a nice, dry vehicle to drive around in (it&apos;s the least I could do). One last stop to my daughter&apos;s school to drop off a book order, and it was back home for a nice nap. Later that evening, Pamela and I toasted our eighth wedding anniversary with a nice dinner at Red Lobster, one of our favorites (don&apos;t laugh). My mother-in-law volunteered to watch Harmony so we could have some time together, and because we&apos;re old and tired, we figured the best thing to do was go out to dinner. Ah, how time makes fools of us all! Still, we had a good time and after dinner, went out winter-coat shopping for me as my leather jacket that I&apos;ve been holding on to since Chuck Yeager passed it on to me was no longer in good repair. I picked out a nice, low-cost fleece lined number with a million pockets in it to store my cell phone, bluetooth (which I don&apos;t wear if I don&apos;t have to), wallet, chewing gum, chapstick and car keys. I wanted something cheap because I just know that one of these days, I&apos;m going to be unloading the cash cube out of the van and a sharp metal corner is going to do a number on the jacket, and I&apos;d rather it be a cheap coat than an expensive one.
Saturday, I slept in and finally started making my way to Olean. I got into town just as the sun was setting and the snow started coming down like a bitch. I got ready for the show, shaved and ironed my clothes and made my way to the Premiere Banquet Center where I was performing with Jamie Lissow and Bill Benden. It was a co-headliner show with me as the warm-up act, and it shook out that I only needed to do 15 minutes. Still under the weather with only one day&apos;s worth of antibiotics in my system, I gladly filled the short set with a &quot;greatest hits&quot; montage that went over well. I palled around with Bill and Jamie, talked shop, new babies, and all that stuff that standup comics talk about when we get together. After the show, Jamie opted to brave the snow and head back to Rochester. I opted to stay in the cushy Hampton Inn and beg a late checkout. By the time I left the hotel, the sun was shining, the roads were clear, and I got to hear the first quarter of the Buffalo Bills beating the stuffing out of the Kansas City Chiefs. I swear, after Monday night&apos;s dismal, last-second loss to the Cleveland Browns, I vowed that if Buffalo couldn&apos;t hand a 1-9 team their ass, I was through with them. Luckily, they delivered, and Trent Edwards ran for two touchdowns, which is making me like him again. Then again, Rob Johnson did that crap against Jacksonville a handful of seasons ago, and I started liking him and he turned into a total piece of shit. So let&apos;s just say I&apos;m being cautiously optimistic.
This week, it&apos;s Absolute Comedy in Toronto, my first time at the club and I&apos;m excited to be breaking new ground. Next month, there&apos;s a lot of work close to home, holidays to prepare for, and then in January, I head off for a month-long tour of Calgary, Edmonton, and other snow-tossed cities of Western Canada. I&apos;m excited, but also happy that it&apos;s still a couple of months off....I&apos;m going to have to get ready for one of the farthest away places that I&apos;ve ever performed in before.
Best to you and yours this Thanksgiving holiday.

 Play It All Night Long (Warren Zevon) 
Posted on 11/11/2008 at 11:46 PM
Good evening from Raleigh, North Carolina.
I must be in a blue state, because I&apos;m freezing my ass off.
That&apos;s not exactly true, but after spending two weeks in Florida and Alabama, the 15 degree drop in temperature is feeling absolutely chilly.
I have one more show tomorrow and then I&apos;ll start heading north to home, where I haven&apos;t been since before Halloween. I&apos;ll be hosting &quot;Dash For Dollars,&quot; my college comedy game show, and even though I&apos;ve only been on the job about six weeks, I&apos;m starting to have the same withdrawal feelings I have when I don&apos;t get to do my own standup act for a long time.
The stage time has been really sparse this trip out. I did a show in Savannah, Georgia at Savannah State University, and then went to my mother&apos;s house in Florida to hang out for five days. I got sick somewhere along the way, and I&apos;ve been sucking down the water and taking Mucinex to stop coughing and to try to bring up some of the congestion, and even though I have the symptoms under control, I need to get home and see a doctor for some antibiotics.
To top it off, I started having leg problems that I was able to diagnose as due to fallen arches, because I&apos;ve had them before. I went out and got some inserts for my shoes to give some support, but the muscles still take time to relax back to normal. There are exercises you can do to relieve the tension, but with a great deal of driving, there&apos;s a greater than normal stress on the muscles of the foot and leg. I&apos;ve been lucky that I&apos;ve had stretches of time off to let myself just collapse and lay in bed in a hotel room rather than having to get up and go out and produce.
I worked at the Stardome Comedy Club in Birmingham, Alabama on Election Day, the following day, and the following Sunday, or what they call in the comedy business a &quot;wrap-around;&quot; they got a special headliner act (in this case, James Gregory, the &quot;Funniest Man In America&quot;) and needed to fill the &quot;off&quot; nights that the big name guy didn&apos;t want to do. Cue your man Ralph. I&apos;d been wanting to get into the Stardome for a long time, having heard great things about the club, and it definitely lives up to the hype. The place is huge, the seats were full every night I was there, and the crowds were appreciative. I sold out of my comedy CD&apos;s while I was there and was invited back. Nice day at the office, eh? I worked with Will Marfori on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Drew Thomas on Sunday. They&apos;re both really good comics and nice fellows that I&apos;d met and worked with before, and that&apos;s always a bonus.
I had Thursday and Friday off to relax, and then Saturday I went and entertained a small group in Atlanta for a gentleman&apos;s 50th birthday party. I did a mild &quot;roast&quot; of the guy, who was a family man, Sunday School teacher, and just an overall good guy. His kids were there, as well as people from his church, so the humor had to be squeaky clean, and it was a challenge to write a roast that was totally clean for a guy I never met before. They were a nice group, though, and I did balloon animals for the kids. I&apos;m serious, I had the balloons with me, so I did some for the kids. It was 190 miles one way to get to the gig from Birmingham, but after finding ridiculously cheap gasoline ($1.90!!! Thank you, Flying J loyalty card!) I still made money on the trip.
So I had too many days off, and one of my college shows got canceled this week, but I got to spend time with my mother, break in a new club, made an anniversary celebration special for someone, and got to watch the election returns come in thanks to lodging that didn&apos;t require me to be up and out at any certain time. Which reminds me....God bless Holiday Inn Express and the Holiday Inn Priority Club and their late check-out. There&apos;s nothing like lounging around in a room until 2:00 in the afternoon and not getting bitched at. Other hotels could learn from these people.....I&apos;m talking to YOU, Days Inn.
So the only other thing to report is that I&apos;m in love with Rachel Maddow. I&apos;m not sure when it happened, but I&apos;ve become quite taken with her. I know that some folks will say that she&apos;s not on our team, but that doesn&apos;t matter.....I&apos;m married, it&apos;s not like I&apos;m trying to recruit her. And when I tried to put my finger on exactly what it is about Rachel that I find attractive, I keep coming back to her intelligence. She&apos;s smart! She&apos;s REALLY smart! She&apos;s smart in a way that when she&apos;s speaking or interviewing a guest, I feel like I&apos;m really following the conversation, even though I&apos;m a guy who took four years at a community college to get a two-year degree.
But most importantly, other people seem taken with Rachel Maddow besides me. She seems to be the new &quot;hot&quot; commentator on TV, and I think it&apos;s because America is starting to value intelligence again. &quot;Smart&quot; is the new &quot;cool.&quot;
President-Elect Obama is the gold standard for cool, and he really isn&apos;t. He&apos;s smart. I caught him answering some questions and he did an impression of Redd Foxx having a heart attack. In case you&apos;re very young or not familiar with the program through re-runs, Redd Foxx has a show called &quot;Sanford and Son,&quot; and one of the running gags was that he would always pretend he was having a heart attack, and he would call up to the heavens, &quot;Elizabeth, I&apos;m coming to join you, honey!&quot; Elizabeth was his predeceased wife. Well, when Obama did the impression, he said &quot;Weezy, I&apos;m coming!&quot; Weezy was the wife from Sherman Helmseley&apos;s TV sitcom, &quot;The Jeffersons,&quot; which came out about seven or eight years after &quot;Sanford and Son.&quot; Only a guy who spent as much time as he did, studying and keeping his nose lodged in a book, would make that obvious pop culture error. On the David Letterman show, they had him deliver the line &quot;Can you smell what Barack is cooking?&quot; which was a satirical slant at the Rock&apos;s wrestling catch-phrase. But Obama doesn&apos;t know that either, because he doesn&apos;t watch wrestling. He pores over the minutiae of his work, takes time to work out at the gym, and strives, strives, strives. Sometimes I feel guilty that I never had the discipline to dig into the books that way, who knows what I&apos;d be doing today. But there&apos;s one thing for sure, and that is that America is finally coming back around and saying &quot;education is good.&quot; &quot;Book smarts have value.&quot; I&apos;m very happy about that. I&apos;m tired of living in a dumbed-down country. Maybe we can finally ship Will Ferrell off to Alaska and get some decent character-driven film comedies made before I qualify for the freakin&apos; senior citizen&apos;s discount.
Before I sign off, I&apos;d like to acknowledge my good and trusted friend Steve Burr, the host of &quot;3 Things You Never Talk About&quot; (google it if you don&apos;t know) who challenged me to write something positive about someone I disagreed with from a policy standpoint. That may not be the exact challenge, but it was words to that effect, and it was several months ago and I&apos;d been dwelling upon it, and somehow could not do it. Today, I&apos;d like to change that.
In the transition period between President George W. Bush and President-Elect Barack Obama, I think President Bush has been phenomenal in expediting a swift and seamless transfer of power. I think that the comments he made about seeing Obama and his family on the stage and saying what a wonderful thing this was for America was gracious, patriotic, loving, and a showing of a side of Bush that we haven&apos;t seen enough of.
In truth, President Bush has to be looked upon as an individual who has offered incredible opportunities to people of color. The appointments of Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice to the office of Secretary of State were groundbreaking, and his trusting of Alberto Gonzalez as Attorney General must be recognized. After all this consideration, I frame the President as a man who really thought he was doing the best he could for America, and made hard decisions, no matter how unpopular they were. Now, I can&apos;t speak for Dick Cheney, who I&apos;m sure a lot of people suspect was the real evil behind the Bush administration, but I won&apos;t question Bush anymore as regards to the flippant statements made by Kanye West after Hurricane Katrina that &quot;President Bush hates black people.&quot; I believe, no, he doesn&apos;t, and as a matter of fact, he&apos;s probably their greatest cheerleader. Now, whether or not he surrounded himself with cronies as a way to insulate himself from dissent, I would have to take exception with, but I believe that actions speak louder than words, and his actions in this transition have shown that he is the warm human being that I never would have given him the credit for being.
I guess we all have our good and bad points, you just have to take the time to inventory them.
Tomorrow, it&apos;s off to St. Augustine&apos;s College in Raleigh, North Carolina, and then Thursday, the trail of tears back to snow Upstate New York. I can&apos;t wait!

 Changes (David Bowie) 
Posted on 11/06/2008 at 01:54 AM
&quot;It&apos;s no sin to make a mistake. The sin is when you don&apos;t go back and clean it up.&quot;
I spoke those words to my brother 23 years ago. He was about to fail his senior year in high school because of a missing phys-ed credit. Long story short, he would oversleep because of his job and then wouldn&apos;t go to school because of a mandatory detention policy for late arrivals, which would interfere with his after-school job, so some days he just didn&apos;t go. Consequently, he wasn&apos;t present enough days to get the gym credit, and was looking at the prospect of being held back a year.
I told him to take summer school. They don&apos;t offer summer school for phys-ed.
But I told him the line above, about cleaning up our mistakes, and he went back to school and worked out a plan with them. The school let him put time in at the YMCA, and after enough hours to satisfy them, they would award him his diploma, which he did over the summer.
He made the mistake, and then cleaned it up.
Tuesday night, America cleaned up it&apos;s mistakes.
In electing Barack Obama the 44th President of the United States, America said &quot;we are ready to fix things.&quot;
We are ready to fully anoint African-Americans, not just with cheap, smiling words, but with a real vote of confidence.
We are ready to turn the wheels of government over to individuals who are knowledgeable, who have studied law, who bring real credentials to the table and are ready to govern.
We are ready to offer the rest of the world the assurance that the country which they all look up to and aspire to be, is ready to stop being a bully and ready to start being a trusted ally again.
As much as I support Barack Obama, it is with much shame that I confess that I found many more reasons to vote against his opponent than I found reasons to support him.
From the beginning, the McCain campaign seemed to be waged for all the wrong reasons.
First of all, why was a wealthy, 72-year-old man with 13 cars and eight houses working so hard to apply for a job? Shouldn&apos;t he have been contemplating retirement? I&apos;ll tell you why he did it; he got boned by Karl Rove and George W. Bush in South Carolina in 2000, and he&apos;s been lying in stealth for eight years waiting for his turn, the turn he felt he was cheated out of. I&apos;m sure the eight years weren&apos;t easy, but he spent five years in a P.O.W. camp, so I have no doubts about his tenacity.
But that&apos;s the wrong reason to want to be President. Bob Dole ran on that bullshit back in 1996, and Bill Clinton slapped him around.
The Sarah Palin pick as VP? I never saw a campaign shoot itself in the foot more deftly since Al Gore thought it would be a good idea to run a Jewish veep (Joe Lieberman) past the deeply Christian voters of the South (and elsewhere....the 13 states of the Confederacy don&apos;t have any monopoly on anti-Semitism). The race for the presidency isn&apos;t &quot;Take Your Daughter To Work Day.&quot; It would be hard to argue that even a featherweight like J. Danforth Quayle wasn&apos;t less qualified than the Governor of Alaska. Could the McCain campaign have been saved by a more savvy pick? Absolutely. He could have chosen one of a plethora of rising young stars on the right, or even an old saw like Elizabeth Dole who was a skillful politician until the voters of North Carolina started to wake up and smell the bullshit. Bobby Jindall could have brought some youth and excitement, Mitt Romney would have brought all of his economically conservative supporters, but McCain had to find someone who would whet the Evangelical&apos;s whistle after he basically told them to lick his asshole back in 2000. And snake-charming, speaking in tongues Sarah was that gal. It&apos;s too bad that the hypocrisy started piling up faster than the lines on her resume; from Troopergate, to the grandchild being born out of wedlock, to the high-end shopping spree, Caribou Barbie went to just plain old &quot;boo&quot; Barbie.
Finally, the campaign of smear and mud that never seemed to end, was just a bad choice. McCain flung the kitchen sink at Obama, but Barack never responded. It is virtually impossible to win a fight with an enemy that will not engage you. McCain would go into a red-faced rant about Jeremiah Wright, William Ayers, Socialism, spread the wealth, Joe the Plumber, and so on, and Barack would just smile and shake his head. Like all he had to say was &quot;During the Charles Keating affair, you were the only one with money on the table&quot; and the game is over. But he didn&apos;t go there. Obama told the truth, about McCain&apos;s lock-step with George W. Bush and the smoldering ruin that he&apos;s leaving America. And the American people responded with a hearty &quot;fuck THAT plan.&quot;
Well, the smart parts of America did. A glance at the electoral map shows that there are still pockets of resistance to liberals, black people, educated people, or whatever part of voting for Obama you want to isolate. Maybe some folks liked McCain simply based on his military record. If that&apos;s the case, John Kerry with his superior military record should have handed W. his National-Guard-but-never-showed-up ass. Maybe some folks voted for McCain simply based on the conservative position on abortion. Fair, but here&apos;s a position on abortion I think a lot of people haven&apos;t considered, and it happens to be MY position......if two water-heads couldn&apos;t figure out a condom in the back seat of Dad&apos;s car on prom night, I DON&apos;T WANT THEM RAISING CHILDREN!
Whatever malady is affecting the folks in the South and that strip of states from Texas to North Dakota (fuck you, I&apos;ve driven through all of them, so I&apos;ll name &apos;em.....Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota....and I did that WITHOUT a map in front of me), whatever the malady is, the good news is that the smart people of America are going to put people and programs in position to help EVERYONE out of the mess that this country has become. EVERYONE. Everyone is going to be a beneficiary of good, smart government that won&apos;t allow the economy to tank, won&apos;t allow us to squander money we don&apos;t have and young people&apos;s lives we&apos;d rather keep in futile wars abroad, won&apos;t allow an American city to eat Hurricane Dick and wait around four days to do something about it. And I&apos;m talking to you, Louisiana. How much self-loathing do you have to ever vote Republican again? After George Bush left you swimming in your own shit without lifting a finger? If I lived in New Orleans, I&apos;d rather have a finger cut off than vote Republican.
A criticism of the Democratic party by some commentator on the right was that &quot;They always run a lawyer for President. It&apos;s never a common person.&quot;
Here&apos;s a thought. If I&apos;m going to send someone to Washington, the home of national law and government in this country, maybe I&apos;d like to send someone who has STUDIED LAW AND GOVERNMENT. If I want surgery done, I don&apos;t bring in a guy who lays carpet, I call a surgeon. If I want my clogged toilet fixed, I don&apos;t bring in a guy who grooms poodles, I call a plumber. And If I want economic advice, I call an economist NOT A FUCKING PLUMBER.
This is how frustrated I&apos;ve become. My candidate won, and I&apos;m still pissed. Still pissed that the election wasn&apos;t a clear-cut landslide, like Reagan-Mondale back in 1984, because there are still pockets of folks in our country who still don&apos;t get it. But it&apos;s O.K. Because folks like me stepped up and did the right thing, folks like them will get universal health care, decent wages for jobs, a country that is released from the grip of foreign oil, better social standing in the world, and the residual positivity of some racial healing.
And by the way, the flip-side of that racial healing thing is that the bar has been WAY lifted for black folk in America. The old arguments about inequalities and access to opportunity just won&apos;t hold anymore. Obama grew up without his father, worked his ass off, and became President of the Harvard Law Review (no small achievement), United States Senator, and now President of the United States. I want to hear &quot;Yes We Can&quot; echoing through the black community for the rest of my life. There&apos;s really no reason that I shouldn&apos;t hear it, anyway. We&apos;ve come too far to turn back now.
So I applaud a post-racial America, an America that no longer considers intellectualism to be a bad thing, an America that&apos;s ready to build on that bridge to the 21st century that Bill Clinton built and George W. Bush burned. I&apos;m girding myself for the hounding attacks that will surely come from the Right, now that they have a villain to coalesce around. Rush, Hannity, O&apos;Reilly and the rest have four years of material ready to go, and if they try to tear down Obama like they did Bill Clinton, it won&apos;t surprise me at all. The only exception being that if they try that shit with Obama, his wife Michelle will be WAY more likely than Hillary to kick off her heels, take her jewelry off, and start kicking a little ass.
In real life, and to be serious to close this up, I have a bi-racial family. My wife is of mixed heritage, and based on our backgrounds, my daughter is Italian, African-American, Isle of St. Croix, and German. She goes to a school that is mostly minority (oxymoron?) and even though she is aware of the difference in races, she perceives no difference in the races, other than the color of their skin. And she&apos;s four. And none of her classmates think anything of it, either. Can it be that children are smarter than the voters of Alabama? And white Americans over the age of 65? I&apos;m in Birmingham, Alabama right now, and I know damn well, somewhere in the city today, some cracker asshole made a joke about the huge Obama headline in the paper this morning and everyone getting excited because a black man got a job. And it still galls the piss out of me.
Those racial wounds are old and deep. But they&apos;re scabbing up. And one day, they&apos;ll dry up and fall off.
God Bless America.

 Jesus Was A Democrat (Everclear) 
Posted on 10/25/2008 at 12:48 AM
I&apos;m home on a Friday night, and off, thank God. I&apos;m worn out, under the weather, and tired.
I took off for another long road trip on Wednesday, October 15th, working a few comedy clubs and a couple of college gigs in an 8-day stretch with two days off. I took the van that is now my rolling office, loaded up with the Incredible Cash Cube, the star of the game show &quot;Dash For Dollars,&quot; of which I am now the host.
I got the old war wagon up and running for the trip, heading to Jiffy Lube to get her an oil change (I literally had no idea when the oil had been changed last, so better safe than sorry) and then went to the gurus at Best Buy to have my satellite radio installed. My good buddy, Ricky K., managed to find a satellite radio unit, unopened, in the original bubble pack, at a thrift store down in Florida, and hooked me up like a fat rat. After the boys at Best Buy hooked that baby up, I was free to enjoy hundreds of channels while I drove, even though I only worked about four of them in regular rotation.
The trip to Blacksburg, Virginia, took a little longer than usual, what with me tooling around in a Ford E150 van and not having the same mobility as scooting around in a Toyota Camry. Still, the miles melted away as I enjoyed the news, talk and commentary on Air America, CNN, and other news outlets. I also indulged in a channel called Boneyard, which focuses on radio friendly 80&apos;s metal, which is what I grew up with.
Upon arriving in Blacksburg, I got myself washed up, shaved and ironed a shirt and made my way to Attitudes Bar, in the Holiday Inn. Outside, enjoying a smoke, was my old friend Paul Hooper, a talented comic out of Charlotte, North Carolina whom I toured with in the past. Paul had the reputation of being quite a hell raiser back in the day, but these days, he&apos;s rockin&apos; the Red Bull but passing on the Jager, and his act hasn&apos;t suffered for it at all. He keeps the punchlines coming like a machine gun, unapologetic and non-stop, and he&apos;s a great act to watch. I also didn&apos;t suck, but Paul earned his headliner money that night.
The next day, I decided to drive right to Greensboro and check in to the hotel a day early. The hotel gave me the same rate the Comedy Zone was getting, and I set up shop, ironing shirts for the weekend, writing, and doing all of the stuff I do when I&apos;m on the road. I tried to exercise, but the treadmill in the exercise room wasn&apos;t working, so I had to settle for walking around in the stadium neighborhood of Greensboro.
At the Comedy Zone, I shared the bill with local host and legend Chris Wiles and headliner James Sibley, both comics I had worked with before and enjoyed their company. I got booed the first show Saturday when I entreated the audience to use their democratic right to vote, and they got it mixed up and thought I was saying &quot;vote Democratic,&quot; and they booed and hissed me. I told them to go fuck themselves; actually, I apologized like a little bitch and changed the subject. By the end of the weekend, I was saying whatever the hell I wanted to say and doing fine with it, and I don&apos;t know what it is about that room, but I like it and I keep going back.
Sunday, I checked out of the hotel late so I could watch &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; on HBO, and then headed to the laundromat up the road to wash my clothes. I enjoyed the Buffalo Bills game (vs. San Diego) on one of the Sirius stations (they merged with XM and I chose the package that would offer the NFL games) and the Bills won. It was great actually being able to catch the game even though I was miles away from any TV or radio station that would have carried that game. The soup Du jour was the Carolina Panthers, and they won, too, so &quot;Go Cats!&quot;
I drove to Fayetteville and literally missed the part of the game where Buffalo ran out the clock to seal the win, because I had to stop for gas. I managed to find it for $2.79, which was a lot better than in Fayetteville proper, where gas prices spiked to over three bucks. The grand champion of gas this week was in Virginia, where I saw a station offering it for $2.59 after I had just filled up at $2.69. At least the gas is going down, and I can&apos;t decide if that&apos;s because demand has gone down, or the oil companies realize that no one can afford it anymore.
Fayetteville was fun, but I miss the old mc, Steve. Steve took his own life a while ago, and I miss not only his dry wit, but the easy, mellow way that he warmed up the crowd. The new guy (I forget his name) comes right out of the box bashing Republicans, which is probably not a smart thing to do in a town populated predominately by military folk, their families, and folks who give them aid and comfort. Somehow, I did better in Fayetteville on Sunday than I did in Greensboro on Friday, which has my brain in a twist.
Monday I headed back west across North Carolina to the Charlotte suburb of Belmont, home of Belmont Abbey College and Starz Tavern, home of the late Belmont Comedy Zone. I checked in to the Hampton Inn, my new favorite hotel (they put us up at one in Fayetteville, as well), got cleaned up and made my way to the school to do the &quot;teaser,&quot; a cafeteria event where I threw dollar bills and t-shirts into the audience and got them hyped for the evening show.
The show was great, with a full room and lots of folks who were hot to compete and win the money. After the show, I made my way back to the Hampton Inn and completely unraveled. I do a lot of what I call &quot;running, jumping and dancing&quot; in the show, the kind of thing I would do in the old Joey and Maria&apos;s Italian Comedy Wedding Shows I used to do, to get the crowd fired up. The downside is that the next day, my legs feel like the legs of an almost 42-year-old man who&apos;s been running around for an hour and a half.
I squeezed them for the late checkout and headed back across the state eastward to Henderson, North Carolina. It was a day off, so I dragged my feet, and somewhere between Charlotte and Greensboro, I heard a weird noise coming from the rear passenger side of the van, and started losing speed. Sure as shit, the tire was coming apart at the seams. And not just going flat, but coming apart like you see tractor trailer tires eating it as they speed down the road.
Luckily, no one was near me, so I headed off the ramp and got up onto the shoulder, and started making phone calls. Triple A was my first call, and they got someone out very quickly. Then I called the office to let them know what was going on, then checked in with my wife. I was carrying a full-sized spare, but had no jack to lift the van, and I probably wouldn&apos;t have tried it anyway, except in an emergency. The tow truck driver showed up with one of those heavy-duty floor jacks, and got the tire changed quickly and with little problem. The funny thing was that another car had experience some trouble as I was pulling off to the right, he was pulling off to the left with smoke billowing out from under his hood. The police and fire department came and got him squared away, and I didn&apos;t even see them move his car until just after my flat was changed.
The luck kept coming. The tow truck driver mentioned to me that there was a tire place right off the exit I had left the expressway on, so I motored on up and bought a new spare. I left them the rim with the shredded remains of the tire, and went to lunch and found a bank to get some cash. When I arrived back, the work was done, I settled up and headed on my way.
I got into Henderson and didn&apos;t have a specific hotel to check into, the college was supplying me with a lodging stipend. I decided to dig into my own pocket and stay somewhere nice, and there was a Hampton Inn within just a few miles of the school, Vance-Granville Community College. I got settled in, and went to Wal-Mart to get a hair cut. I had to wait about 40 minutes, but it felt good to just sit in a chair and not have to talk, drive or do anything. I had a mop of hair on my head that needed serious attention, and at Belmont Abbey, I had blow-dried it instead of my usual mousse-and-comb-back, and I felt like I looked like a game show host, but a parody of one. It was just too much hair.
The next morning, I checked out of the hotel and headed to VGCC. There was construction on the I-85, I got turned around, and wound up arriving 25 minutes late for my 10:00 A.M. check-in. The school is so new, my GPS doesn&apos;t even know it&apos;s there, and that was a problem. Plus, when I called, the person at the switchboard decided that County House Road and Community House Road sounded good enough that she could just give me either and I&apos;d be fine. The late arrival didn&apos;t affect me as I still had 90 minutes to set up for the show. I worked quickly, setting up the props, backdrop, cash cube, and putting duct-tape lines on the floor that I would use during the games.
It was a great show with great competitors, and I had to introduce a tie-breaker game about three times during the course of the show. The winner was a young lady who managed to pull not just the $100 bill out of the cash cube, but one of the $50&apos;s. She wound up getting $179!
After the show, I was covered in sweat. The van was parked by a back loading dock so I did a quick change of clothes and used some new load tie-downs to secure the cube in the van. I hit the road around 2:30, and rolled into Rochester just before 1 A.M. I&apos;ve got a few days off to get myself back together, and leave Tuesday for a swing through Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia. I still have quite a few days off, so I&apos;ll probably visit my mother in Florida. I&apos;ll be home for my birthday, and then have a cluster of dates the week before Thanksgiving in Upstate New York, and then Thanksgiving week, I&apos;ll be in Toronto. It&apos;s a new ballgame now, juggling club dates with college dates and still trying to get home every once in a while. Today, Harmony had a school play and Pam and I went out and got a little digital video camera to catch the event on film. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t miss it, but I was tired as hell this morning and the constant non-stop go has weakened some of my defenses to the common cold and such. I&apos;m achy and listless, and sleeping an awful lot. I have a lot of work to do around the house, as well as still having to come up with some plan to retrieve my car from Grand Rapids, Michigan where it&apos;s languishing in a parking lot. I&apos;d like to have it back before Thanksgiving week because there&apos;s no way I&apos;m taking the van into Canada; it&apos;s not registered to me, there is a large piece of not-readily-identifiable hardware strapped down in the back, the whole thing just sounds like a personalized invitation to a battery of body cavity searches.
Not without dinner and a movie, you don&apos;t.

 Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos; (Journey) 
Posted on 10/11/2008 at 03:47 AM
It&apos;s nice to be home again. I&apos;ve been out in the midwest for the last ten days, training for a new job. I&apos;m not leaving standup comedy; I&apos;m just taking a different path.
Anyone who&apos;s talked to me know that I&apos;ve been increasingly disenchanted with the standup comedy life. There&apos;s too much driving, too much time away from home, too much adversity, bad crowds, clubs dying, and not enough upside when the paycheck comes. Gas prices have been kicking the ass of traveling entertainers for years now, and wages have been stagnant.
I started doing comedy when I was in college, which was between 1987 and 1991. I was active in student activities at that time, and the two meshed together well; I was on the campus radio station (closed circuit, but an audience none the less) and hosted comedy shows on campus. I started a coffeehouse series called &quot;Club Wednesday,&quot; and we brought big-name touring college acts on campus to do one-hour shows at noon. I remember handing thousand-dollar checks to guys like Nick DiPaolo and John Joseph, who had just won Star Search that year. And because we block-booked our talent, I knew that these guys had six or seven more shows in a ten day period, and that seemed like really good money. It was one of the reasons that I ran away from home to join the circus, thinking that fast cash and easy money were at the end of the standup comedy rainbow.
Well, long story short, standup comedy has been fun, and I&apos;ll love it until I die, but it&apos;s a lot easier to go out on the road and starve when you don&apos;t have a family waiting back home. If it were just me, I&apos;d be sleeping on sofas, being a &quot;road whore&quot; and getting by on the kindness of strangers, working from check-to-check in a gypsy existence and dying on the road.
Ever since the price of gas got ridiculous, I&apos;ve felt the pressure of needing to make a decision about comedy; it&apos;s not paying the bills anymore, becoming increasingly frustrating to do, and robbing me of a good portion of my time with my family. I&apos;d even gone so far as to pick up applications for different retail stores in my area, as I worked in retail (and enjoyed it) before I made the decision many years ago to go back to college.
I hadn&apos;t gone and made any rash decisions until my wife had mentioned that she talked to our friend Stephano, a comic from Wisconsin (now living in Las Vegas). Stephano was working for a college comedy game show, and making some decent money, and he mentioned to her that the agency was looking for another guy. He passed along the number and said I should give him a call.
Now, I initially looked at this opportunity the same way that a jungle cat looks at meat in a trap. I&apos;m hungry, but don&apos;t completely trust what I&apos;m about to get into.
But I&apos;ve got a wife and a beautiful little girl at home who are depending on me to make good decisions, so finally, after dragging my feet, I pick up the phone.
I spoke with Bill Smith from the Smith Agency in Grand Rapids, Michigan and basically submitted my resume over the phone. He must have liked what he heard, because he started pitching the show to me and let me know what it was all about. I used my improv skills to speak with Bill, letting him know that I had experience and that I was familiar with the market. He mentioned that they pitched a line of inflatables, so I mentioned that I had experience with Sumo Wrestling suits and hosting the show at various bar clients.
After a few weeks of preparation, I was scheduled to come out to Michigan to train for the show. Smith brought in Sean Carlin, one of the other comics who hosts a third game show for the Smith Agency. Sean and I hit it off well, and my training began for the game show.
Basically, it&apos;s a live show hosted on college campuses called &quot;Dash For Dollars.&quot; We have live contestants in a game show format, and the students have to work their way through a series of challenges, and the grand champion gets to go into the cash cube, a money booth where the money flies through the air, and they can keep as much as they can grab in 30 seconds.
I trained for about three days with Sean, doing run-throughs and discussing all of the possible glitches, situations, strategies and contingencies that I could experience. After the fourth day, a collection of workers and family members from the Smith Agency gathered in their warehouse to watch me go through an actual running of &quot;Dash For Dollars.&quot; Bill bought pizza for the crew, and we set it up like an actual show, using his sound equipment in the warehouse left over from his rock &apos;n&apos; roll days. The show went well, and I was on my way.
I spent Sunday preparing mentally, going over the notes, technical documents for the cash cube, the internal paperwork for the Smith Agency, and bonding with Sean and asking him all of the questions I could possibly think of. On Monday, we loaded up a van with the cash cube and all of the props, and made our way to Aquinas College in Grand Rapids.
We had a &quot;teaser&quot; scheduled a few hours before showtime, where we would go through the student cafeteria and tell the students about the show happening later that night, passing out money and t-shirts and getting their excitement level up. We had a mix-up with the hotel situation, finally figuring out that we were scheduled to be at the Comfort Inn, and I got showered and dressed and prepared for my first public show.
Sean and I were accompanied by a guy named Ryan, one of the technicians at the Smith Agency. The agency does a series of other shows for colleges, including temporary tattoos, funny t-shirts, and the like, and Ryan operates some of the shows. He came along for moral support, and to be our &quot;roadie,&quot; and he came in quite handy. We got to the college two hours before our 10:00 P.M. showtime, and the student activities folks greeted us with a nice pre-show meal (Jimmy John&apos;s submarine sandwich platters and soft drinks). I remember providing hospitality when I brought artists on campus, and the practice hasn&apos;t changed. I ate quietly while Sean chatted with the student activities people, taking notice of what he had to say and what the students were responding to.
As the time ticked down to showtime, I got on the mike and started warming up the crowd. Several agents from the Smith Agency showed up to see me work in front of an actual college crowd, and Bill even came out for a little while.
The first show went well, with only a few notes from Sean, and the students seemed to enjoy the show a lot. I tossed out money and t-shirts, and ran the students through the games, while Sean ran the musical soundtrack from the d.j. booth. It was a lot of running and shouting, but a lot of fun. The next day, I was a little sore from all the physical activity, but we got a late checkout from the hotel so I had the opportunity to sleep in a little.
The next show was at Olivet College in Olivet, Michigan. Sean followed me and hung out only as an observer, and I loaded in the show using student volunteers and set it up and ran it myself. It went really well and was well attended, and afterwards, the Student Activities director took us out and bought us Subway sandwiches for our post-show meal. Sean and I ate and talked and then parted company, he followed me to the expressway and then headed east towards Upstate New York, and I went back to the hotel.
I had only a short time to sleep before heading off towards South Suburban College in South Holland, Illinois, just south of Chicago. It rained heavily all the way there, but the van held steady on the road, and I didn&apos;t have much trouble negotiating it even though it was the biggest vehicle I&apos;ve driven since piloting the Bronco on the George Carlin tour, and that was over a decade ago. Still, old habits die hard, and soon I was one with the vehicle, making turns and navigating around parked cars with that big boat like I&apos;d been doing it forever.
The one thing that was troublesome was the cash cube. Imagine a plexiglass telephone booth with no telephone in it, and a window-style air conditioner anchored at the bottom. The cube has a rolling dolly welded to the back of it, and the unit slides into the back of the van on the wheels. They had sandbags to chock the wheels to keep it from sliding around, but they shift during transit and at one point, I stopped for a vehicle making a right-on-red, and the cube slammed into the back of my seat, giving me a nice little punch in the back.
I anchored the cube as best I could, using the full-sized spare tire as a buffer between my seat and the cube, laying it down so the rolling cube wouldn&apos;t hit my chair again. I drove through the rain to Chicago, and just five blocks from the school, disaster struck. I was waiting at a red light, and when the light turned green, I gave the gas pedal a little push, and as the van lurched forward, the cube rolled back, and one of the metal edges caught one of the back windows just right and shattered it into a thousand pieces. I was 45 minutes early for my check in time, and I had to move fast. I also had to find a place to change money into small bills to put into the cash cube for the show.
I stopped at a supermarket and used the bathroom. Their ATM was out of order, so I headed to a bank around the corner. I used the bank&apos;s ATM, paying the $2 fee, and took the money to a teller who happily broke the bills for me.
Next stop was Walgreen&apos;s. I purchased a small broom &apos;n&apos; dustpan, parked the van in the back of the parking lot near a garbage can, and started cleaning up the mess. Once I got most of the glass taken care of, I whipped out my roll of duct tape (which I bought for just such an emergency) and butchered the cardboard from a mostly empty box of t-shirts and started closing the hole. After the hole was properly covered, I made my way to the college with 15 mintues to spare.
I chatted with the student activities director at South Suburban, getting a feel for the demographic makeup of the student body while I set up the show. The cube was too big to fit through any of the doors, but the back of the theater I was performing in had a big roll-up door, so we brought it in that way. I had the show set up quickly and had about 45 minutes to breathe and relax before showtime. The show went great, and believe me, it&apos;s hard for it not to go great when you&apos;re handing out cash and t-shirts like Santa Claus. The winning student, a big dude named Eric who I had picked on earlier in the show, only fished out $56 from the cash cube, so I looked in my pocket and saw a fifty, a five and a one. Fifty-six dollars. I doubled the prize money and looked like the biggest super hero there ever was! It was a great feeling, and all I could think of was &quot;Wow, they&apos;re actually paying me to do this!&quot;
After the show, it was off to the hotel where the college graciously lodged me in a king business suite, complete with fridge, microwave and comped wireless internet. I relaxed for only a few minutes before scanning the yellow pages to look for an auto glass shop that could take care of my situation. I was performing at a school on the north side of Chicago the following day, so I made an appointment for the mobile unit to meet me there. They needed a four-hour window of time to work on the glass, and between the check-in and the end of the show, I would be at Oakton Community College for four hours, so it seemed perfect.
I headed out, grabbed dinner and hit a bank to replenish my cash supply for the next show. I wanted to have all of my ducks in a row before taking off the next morning, so I used the time in the hotel room to reset all of my props and have the most time available to work with the glass technician if need be.
I took off extra early for Oakton, knowing that morning rush hour traffic in Chicago would be relentless. It was only a 45-minute drive, but I allowed double the time and still only got there 20 minutes early. I was met immediately by the glass company&apos;s mobile unit, and he repaired my windown in 20 minutes. It was literally a picture-perfect situation!
I loaded in the show to the student cafeteria, and after a few glitches with the college&apos;s sound system, started the show. The show went great, and the students really seemed to need the money because they were mobbing me as I threw singles into the crowd. The grand champion, a petit young lady named Mary Kitt, also pulled a small amount of money like the winner the day before. I reached in my pocket and added cash to her stack, and the crowd went nuts!
I actually had clipped the college&apos;s sound system with the music and lapel microphone they gave me to use, because I was trying to drive a full cafeteria with music and I&apos;m loud to begin with. Still, I ran around, jumped up on chairs, mugged for the audience, threw money around, and before I knew it, I realized I was channeling Mike Ruiz.
Mike Ruiz is one of my good, good friends, and I met him while performing in the Joey and Maria&apos;s Italian Comedy Wedding Show years back. Mike is a good comic and actor, and a natural mc for the show. I have literally done hundreds of shows with Mike in all manner of rooms, from small banquet halls to huge convention centers, and even the big room at Turning Stone Casino in Upstate New York. Mike has a wonderful rapport with an audience, and uses his natural likeability to move them, and I obviously absorbed some of his technique, because there it was, in the Oakton Community College Student Life Center, bubbling out of me like hot marinara out of a calzone. It worked so well that I must publicly thank you Mike, for teaching me even if you didn&apos;t realize that you were teaching me.
After the show, I hit the trail of tears back home to Rochester, and after losing an hour in the time transition from Chicago back to east coast time, I rolled into Rochester around 3 A.M. I now have the Smith Agency van sitting in my driveway and my car is back in Grand Rapids sitting in the parking lot and as soon as I can figure out how to retrieve it, I&apos;m heading back there. I slept in as long as Harmony would let me, and later in the afternoon, I got a call from Bill Smith mentioning that my report cards from the schools were good, and that I was &quot;in the van,&quot; meaning I&apos;m hired and installed as the newest host for &quot;Dash For Dollars.&quot;
I still have comedy club dates on the books; I&apos;m going to Blacksburg, Virginia, Greensboro, North Carolina and Fayetteville, North Carolina this week, and then I have a Monday night show the day after. The great thing about this game show is that they generally get booked during the week, leaving my weekends available for club work. Plus, they&apos;re all over the country, which means the routing is actually going to help me expand my territory. And the money is good enough that I&apos;m actually going to be able to stay in the game, and I&apos;ve got a company full of agents repping me, and now all I have to do is worry about getting to the dates and performing. I&apos;m also going to try and get my improv troupe to work more frequently, but I have to tackle things a little bit at a time. I have books to write, CD&apos;s to record, and so many projects I can&apos;t count them. I&apos;ve been recharged by this opportunity, and I&apos;m excited to see where it&apos;s going to head. One of the best by-products is that I&apos;m home for a weekend, and it doesn&apos;t mean I was unemployed this week. I feel like I should pinch myself to make sure I&apos;m awake.
I&apos;ve always said that the key to this business was tenacity. I just never thought that I would have to prove it to myself. I went from being ready to take a job stocking shelves at a supermarket to being the host of one of the longest-running college shows in the country. I feel like Kurt Warner must have after Super Bowl XXXIV.
Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos;, indeed.

 Sexual Healing (Marvin Gaye) 
Posted on 09/30/2008 at 02:49 AM
I said &quot;Fuck The Troops&quot; on stage Saturday night and got a round of applause.
Here&apos;s how it happened; I was performing at the Cedar House in Skaneatles, New York with fellow comics Danny &quot;D-Low&quot; Brown and Joe Fico. At a point in my headlining set, I begin talking about politics. I preface the political material in my show by urging everyone to vote in November, because it sickens me that voter apathy has subjected us to lousy leadership in this country for much of the last 40 years (in other words, my lifetime). I mention that American fighting men and women lost their lives defending our right to vote, and if you stayed home on Election Day, you were basically saying &quot;Fuck The Troops.&quot; The crowd of about 120 clapped and cheered.
Now, staying home on Election Day is NOT saying &quot;Fuck The Troops.&quot; The right to vote is also the right to abstain. But I thought it would be a fun exercise to see if I could say what is possibly the most inflammatory statement you could say to a group of strangers (in a small, and from what I could gather, conservative town) and get away with it.
Joe had done some political material earlier in the show, and it was clear from their response that I was in a very red part of New York (a very blue state). Getting them to clap for me saying &quot;fuck the troops&quot; was all the more sweeter, because it proved that in the right context, with the right wording and inflection, you can get social conservatives to clap for almost anything.
Now, I mention all of this not to give myself a smug pat-on-the-back, but to set up the next thing, which is a question from the mailbag. The question comes from Ricky K. of Englewood, Florida, and he&apos;s not exactly a stranger; he&apos;s been one of my best friends for almost 20 years.
Ricky writes; &quot;I&apos;d like to see you write in your blog about Sara Palin and how she is quickly becoming another Dan Quayle and late night fodder for Dave, Jay and Saturday Night Live. I&apos;d like to see your take on this.&quot;
Well, Ricky, I&apos;d be glad to oblige.
The state of politics in this country has become so fragmented and divided that we&apos;ll likely never come together as a nation again. The infighting based on whether or not an individual is a Democrat or a Republican has gotten so ugly, it&apos;s made many of us feel like foreigners in our own country. The current state of the economy (disastrous) is a perfect microcosm of what we&apos;ve become....a bunch of sorry finger-pointers who would rather assign blame (and therefore, shame) than roll up our sleeves and work together in a bucket brigade to put the fire out. This fragmentation was designed by Republicans, to pit us against each other and seize the power that by rights, should be held by Democrats as champions of the middle class, the largest class in this country (and by that I mean outnumbering both the &quot;rich&quot; and the &quot;poor&quot;).
Now, as a Liberal, I must defend the Democrats as being more correct-not &quot;totally&quot; correct, but more correct, than Republicans in any given circumstance. Republicans are given to hyperbole, such as tearing down actors who give their political opinions as &quot;Hollywood elitists,&quot; even though you never hear that tag given to Ronald Reagan or Arnold Schwarzenegger, ie: Hollywood elitists that they agree with. They are masters of double-speak, and will sell you as much bullshit as you are willing to buy.
And even the base of the Republican party is suspect; Republicans were always the party of the monied few, while the Democrats favored the working class; hence, the union support of Democratic candidates. The simple truth is that as more and more wealth is hoarded by the top one percent in this country, the Republican party needed to shore up their numbers (there are certainly not enough wealthy people left to win an election for a Republican candidate), and they did it by reaching out to evangelical Christians; ie: &quot;Social Conservatives.&quot; The plot here seems to be that if you are an economic Conservative, you just take a stance that abortions are wrong, flag burning is wrong, and gay marriage is an abomination, and you count those votes right into office. Politicians will say anything to get elected, sure, but this one is so easy an idiot could do it.
Calm down, I&apos;m not up to Governor Palin yet.
You never hear anyone talk about &quot;economic Liberals,&quot; do you? It&apos;s usually just social Liberals, because Liberals don&apos;t follow the money like Conservatives do. The general stance is that Republicans care about money, and Democrats care about people. Liberals are forced to deal with money in the form of taxation because they need that money to implement social programs which are designed (wait for it) to take care of people. Republicans want smaller government, smaller taxes, less governmental regulation and intrusion in business, and basically allow each individual&apos;s chips to fall where they may, which is a very cavalier attitude to take when you&apos;ve already got plenty of money. Universal health care isn&apos;t very important to you if you&apos;re healthy and wealthy. Which begs the question, why isn&apos;t there universal health care in this country? Because we&apos;ve only had two terms of Democratic leadership in the White House in the last 28 years, and that particular president (Clinton) had to deal with a Republican Congress that basically told him to shove universal health care up his blow hole (talking about health care and President Clinton actually makes the song &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; by Marvin Gaye come to mind, and I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a good joke in there somewhere, but I got the punchline and can&apos;t figure out the setup). Another reason that Republicans shoot down universal health care is that dead people can&apos;t collect Social Security. If health care was available and people lived long, healthy lives, they&apos;d be collecting Social Security up the wazoo, and George W. Bush and his cronies have already raided that fund and spent the money. Finally, universal health care would destroy a whole industry, the health insurance industry, and the pharmaceutical lobby won&apos;t sit back and watch their product get &quot;price fixed&quot; by a bunch of anti-profit Socialists. It&apos;s all in the money, baby. If the uninsured (yes, I&apos;m one of them, thank you) could get some Political Action Committee money together to lobby Congress, we would. But if we had that money, we wouldn&apos;t need to lobby Congress, we could just go buy our own damn medication.
I had a very interesting conversation with a guy after a show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania last month about universal health care. This individual was ex-Army, and worked for the government in a civilian capacity. His argument against universal health care (after damning the newly minted Democratic VP choice of Joe Biden as a &quot;Socialist&quot; [the new bad word for &quot;Liberal&quot;]) was that the same long lines and poor service that we recieve at the Department of Motor Vehicles would be the same that we would receive under socialized medicine. Although at first blush, I would say as an unisured person that if I could vault over high medical bills by standing in line, I would find the time to do that, but I reject this logic because people at the Department of Motor Vehicles are bureaucrats who are issuing licenses, collecting money and handing out plates. Folks who work in medicine do so because they are healers, wishing to help people and take oaths to do so. I&apos;m not saying that the billing and records aspect of hospitals and clinics would be less rigmarole than they are now, but actually, yes they would, because there wouldn&apos;t have to be any billing to speak of, it would just be maintenance of health records. So yes, I disagree in that respect.
So we&apos;ve got a hornswoggled populace who are getting shoved around, manipulated by Republicans who beat the socially conservative drum, lining up all the simps who care way too much about the abortion issue, gay marriage and gun rights (and the sad truth is that overturning Roe v. Wade wouldn&apos;t abolish abortion, it would just revert the ruling on the issue back to the states, so you&apos;d have really, really, really conservative states like South Dakota and Alabama saying &quot;no&quot; to abortion, then Becky Sue would have to take a long bus ride to the next abortion-allowing state to get her procedure done, or Billy Ray would have to do a back alley coat hanger job on her or face raising a little bastard for 18 years) and marching Conservative politicians into office to the detriment of their fiscal health and welfare. For the most part, social conservatives are not of monetary substance to afford the fiscal policies of the Conservative Right. It would be much more to their advantage to vote with the Left, but the thought of allowing gays to marry and live together (even though this would fall under the allowance of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness...remember that from History class?) makes most social conservatives (the real ones, not the ones pretending they are to curry favor and get votes) vomit. And I mean, those that weren&apos;t in the airport bathroom already, playing footsy under the bathroom stall with another guy.
But neither do Liberals vote their wallets....Sean Penn and Barbara Streisand have plenty of money, and vote with a party that would most likely tax them handily, but they do so because they understand that to whom much is given, much is expected (that&apos;s from the Bible, in case you don&apos;t recognize it). And while the teachings of Jesus Christ almost always smack of Socialism, only a few people (and it&apos;s usually artists, people who spend time examining the human condition) that understand the natural beauty in helping one another. And they do it because it&apos;s the right way to act.
So that, in an overly-simplified explanation, is why I am a Liberal. Now on to Governor Palin.
By now, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard a lot about the good Governor and her fine work up there in Alaska, and had quite a few opportunities to size her up for yourself and decide if she is indeed a good choice for Senator McCain as a running mate.
From the beginning, when Senator McCain emerged victorious over a weak Republican field to garner the nomination of the party, most Conservatives were beside themselves. I remember listening to Rush Limbaugh and hearing how much of a disaster this was for the party (he&apos;s seemed to have come around as of late) and all I could think of was that the George W. Bush campaign painted McCain as the worst possible choice in the world back in 2000, and now he&apos;s the next coming of Ronald Reagan. Remember when Karl Rove got a bunch of volunteers on the phone in South Carolina back in 2000 and asked people &quot;Would it make you want to vote for Senator McCain less if you found out that he fathered a black child out of wedlock?&quot; And the truth was that he handn&apos;t, the truth was that he and his wife, Cindy, had adopted a black child and McCain had to hide the child lest people think the rumor was true, and many folks in South Carolina didn&apos;t vote for him over George W. Bush based on that lie alone. When McCain was named the eventual Republican nominee this year, many folks on the right were very disappointed, hoping for a Mike Huckabee or Mitt Romney (Giuliani never had a chance) and in the absence of those candidates, McCain was like a bitter medicine and the choice of Sarah Palin as a running mate was quite the thumb in the eye to Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, or any of the other rich, white men who were supposed to be in line for that job.
The initial response was that Palin was an answer to disenfranchised Hillary Clinton supporters who were upset that Barack Obama didn&apos;t choose her as his running mate and the Republicans decided to give them a female that they could vote for and make the medicine go down easier. But Hillary Clinton&apos;s supporters weren&apos;t supporting her because she was a female, they were supporting her because she stood for the things they wanted their elected officials to stand for; health care, help for working families, relief from the high cost of living, a woman&apos;s right to choose, equality in the workplace for women and other Liberal ideas. Palin is a pro-life (unless you&apos;re a moose, I guess), pro-gun Conservative who shares few if any of Clinton&apos;s views, other than that a woman can and should compete for one of the two highest offices in the land.
It is to Governor Palin&apos;s eternal misfortune that she has a talented Doppelganger in the form of Tina Fey, formerly of Saturday Night Live and now of 30 Rock on NBC. Fey has lampooned the Governor twice in the last two weeks on SNL, and this last go-around, she didn&apos;t even have to memorize funny written dialogue. In a sketch featuring Amy Pohler as Katie Couric and spoofing a recent interview Governor Palin did with her, Fey merely delivered the lines Governor Palin did when questioned on her foreign party credentials. The disjointed response generated gales of laughter without much comic exaggeration, and THAT, my friends, is quite unfortunate indeed. It is far unfortunate for us as a nation that this situation has been allowed to happen, that a woman who appears to be, while strong, STUNNINGLY unqualified for the position of Vice President, has, in fact, been offered by one of the two major political parties as fit for that office.
Dan Quayle, for those of you that remember him, was chosen by the elder President Bush to show some balance on the ticket by featuring one of the young rising stars of the Republican party. Quayle was a senator from Indiana, and was famously skewered for his correction of a student who spelled &quot;potato&quot; correctly, insisting that the word actually featured an &quot;e&quot; at the end. Quayle had several other gaffes as well, but none more memorable than that one.
Sarah Palin hasn&apos;t even ascended to office yet, and she&apos;s already barfed up quite a few doozies for the late night comedians to work with. There&apos;s a photo making the rounds on the internet of her in an American flag bikini, holding an automatic rifle, but it&apos;s actually Palin&apos;s head photoshopped on to another woman in that pose (please don&apos;t believe stuff you read on the internet.....there&apos;s also no money waiting for you in Nigeria from your dead uncle you didn&apos;t know you had).
The choice of Palin is bad, and probably not McCain&apos;s, although he definitely has a history of reckless behavior. McCain has a damaged reputation among evangelicals (leftover from his 2000 presidential bid in which he basically told the religious right to go fuck themselves) and the Palin pick seems like an attempt to assuage them. Whether or not there are women dumb enough to follow the logic that if they can&apos;t vote for Hillary Clinton, they can vote for McCain and get Palin into the White House as the first female to hold the veep job, remains to be seen. I can&apos;t imagine that Clinton supporters are that obtuse, although she has strong support in the Appalachian states, and those folks aren&apos;t exactly world-famous for their &quot;book lurnin&apos;.&quot;
Any politician that McCain chose as his running mate was sure to be eviscerated by the late night comics, Letterman, Leno, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and others. The sad truth is that Palin is such a bad choice, her jokes write themselves, and now even Republicans are dog-piling on and calling for her removal from the ticket. And this is two months away from the election!
But let&apos;s face it, the ghost of Abraham Lincoln could descend from heaven and he&apos;d lose the presidential election in a landslide. The blue states wouldn&apos;t vote for him because he&apos;s a Republican. The South wouldn&apos;t vote for him because he&apos;s from Illinois. And the evangelicals wouldn&apos;t vote for him because they&apos;d see his beard and think he was Amish.
Our only hope as a nation is to happen along a charismatic leader who can unite us, make us all proud to be one country again, like Reagan did after the financial crisis of the recession during Jimmy Carter&apos;s presidency. We were on the ropes as a nation back in 1979, with hostages in Iran, gas shortages that only allowed you to buy fuel on odd or even days depending on your license plate, and a withering sense of national pride. Reagan, although flawed, was able to bring us all together for a time. Who will do that for us now? We can pin our hopes on an egotistical bastard who&apos;s running for President to correct the screwing he got from Bush eight years ago, and tolerate his angry, caustic style and hope that he unites our country and improves the value of a dollar to most of what it used to be, or we can try the other guy, who seems popular and magnetic, speaks softly, and doesn&apos;t care to approve &quot;attack ads&quot; or sling the mud. I shudder to think that a group of people who can be lead by me, a standup comic doing his act in a bowling alley, to applaud the phrase &quot;Fuck The Troops,&quot; can be lead to think that John McCain and Sarah Palin are a good choice to be Captain and First Mate on this Titanic that the United States of America has become.
You do what you want to, I think the choice is clear.

 Wherever I May Roam (Metallica) 
Posted on 09/23/2008 at 01:37 AM
After quite the layoff from strenuous road work, I returned to the long black ribbon this week with two 2-day tours of the Midwest. Wednesday and Thursday, I worked for the Kewadin Casinos of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan with the witty and rough-edged Bill Bushart, and Friday and Saturday, I appeared at a new club in Peoria, Illinois called Lenny&apos;s Comedy Cafe with the very funny John Bush.
I took off Wednesday morning and drove the 10 hours without a blink. The only hang-up was forgetting that the Zilwaukee bridge (yes, there is such a place) is out, prompting a detour that confounded my GPS device. Also, I hung my left arm out the car window and got a pretty pronounced sunburn. The arm actually said &quot;Ahem. I am sun burnt.&quot; Also, on the way to the club, just after the Mackinac bridge (say &quot;MACK-en-aw and sound like you&apos;re from there), I saw two guys in a white pickup truck lose control of their vehicle on dry pavement and go four-wheeling up an embankment. I always feel like that shit is bad luck omens, but things turned out o.k.
I met Bill Bushart for the first time after having known him for years and done every &quot;MySpace, Facebook&quot; buddy thing you could possibly do without ever meeting face-to-face. He had never performed at the Kewadin Casinos before, so I was his Ishmael, letting him know what to expect, what he could get away with on stage, etc. He barely needed my counsel as he had a great show both nights, in St. Ignace and again in Sault Ste. Marie. Bill works &quot;rough,&quot; which is how I describe my own comedy, so it was a good &quot;themed&quot; show instead of just &quot;here&apos;s a comic&quot; and then &quot;here&apos;s another.&quot;
After various engagements at the Kewadin casinos, I&apos;ve found them to be gracious hosts, picking up meal tabs for the duration of my stay. I would estimate that I gambled enough in the slot machines to pay for the food I consumed, although in my younger days, they never would have gotten the best of me. You just can&apos;t eat salad fast enough to catch up to the &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; machines. Thank God the casino was buying my food, or it would have been &quot;Meal or No Meal.&quot;
Thursday night was great in the Sault (say it &quot;Soo&quot; and sound like you&apos;re from there) as I expected the normal rowdy, young, hard-drinkin&apos; folks, and was pleased to find that a large number of older folks had made the scene. I felt kinda bad because Bill and I were no Red Skelton and Shecky Greene, but Grams and Gramps hung out, I think only a few decided that it was too much and walked early.
Friday morning I had to pick &apos;em up early and get heading out to Peoria, Illinois, home of Lenny&apos;s Comedy Cafe and famously known (by me, anyway) as the historical hometown of Richard Pryor, probably one of the five funniest standup comedians ever. It was a 700 mile trip, crossing Michigan in it&apos;s entirety, a small chunk of Indiana, Chicago in the afternoon, and a good chunk of Illinois farmland. Even though I gained an hour by crossing into the Central Time Zone, I busted my ass to get there, checked in to the hotel and only had enough time to get a one-hour nap, just enough to freshen up. Needless to say, when you put all that effort into getting to a gig, expect the worst. Well, the beautiful weather translated into a Summertime attitude by the denizens of Peoria, and they all decided to go frolicking outdoors rather than come inside and play with us. The show canceled, and I went back to the hotel to sleep a sleep that you only get inside a silk-lined casket. Of course, the day was doomed from the start; a cop pulled me over less than a minute after leaving the casino&apos;s parking lot...I guess I was testing that &quot;25 MPH&quot; speed limit they use around there. He was good enough to let me go with a warning as I pointed out to him that I had JUST left the casino andwas heading to the expressway, and that my car was covered with early morning condensation to prove that I hadn&apos;t been at the wheel long. Actually, I was as polite and respectful as I&apos;ve ever been to a law enforcement agent; when he asked me &quot;Do you have any idea why I pulled you over?&quot; I restrained the urge to say, &quot;Yeah, you saw the New York plates and the Obama &apos;08 sticker on my car and decided to be an asshole?&quot;
Saturday was better, although premium weather still deflated our cause. We had two shows with audiences that made up for in quality what they lacked in quantity. Tammy and Roger were great hosts, and Butch made delicious home recipe, Southern-style barbecue sandwiches for us. John was not familiar with the southern version of barbecue sauce, which uses a vinegar rather than a tomato base, and it was absolutely top notch. We turned in our sets and then returned to the hotel where I immediately started packing and split to make it back to Rochester. There&apos;s a new comedy club in Rochester called.....wait for it.....The Comedy Club (say it CALM-uh-dee club and sound like you&apos;re from there), (www.thecomedyclub.us) and I was invited to perform on their &quot;soft opening&quot; show. For the uninformed, that&apos;s an invitation-only, family-and-friends show that you put on to see if your wait staff is properly trained and can function at the level that you need to do business. I was booked and shared the stage with Matt Grippo, Joe Bruno, Jamie Lissow and Joel Lindley, as well as Rochester&apos;s own Brother Wease, who did some introductions up front and is involved with the running of the club. The show was hosted by Michael Gately, the morning show host on Rochester&apos;s 100.5 The Drive, and a fellow I&apos;d had the pleasure of sharing the stage with in the past. I hadn&apos;t seen Wease in a while, and I went to shake his hand and knocked his cell phone out of his hand and on to the floor.
So I left Peoria around 1 A.M., which was really 2 A.M., because I was heading back east. I drove until 6 A.M., which got me into Indiana and past Chicago, and I got a two-hour nap at a rest stop somewhere between South Bend and the Ohio border. At 8 A.M., I loaded up on Red Bull and hit the road again. I got into radio range of Buffalo to hear a good part of the Buffalo Bills&apos; game against the Oakland Raiders, and just as Rian Lindell was kicking the game-winning field goal, I was pulling into my driveway. I loaded out my luggage, got about an hour of sleep, and headed to the club (notice a pattern here at all?).
Well, I was happy with my set, which was a prairie fire with no rhyme or reason, just stringing together ten minute&apos;s worth of some of my best loved material, but the folks ate it up, so I was happy. And I&apos;m sure a lot of folks will be interested to hear my review of the new club that Rochester will be frequenting for their ha-ha&apos;s.
Basically, I think the place is great. From a decorative standpoint, the club is very nice, and even though it&apos;s in a country bar (called Daisy Dukes) it doesn&apos;t look red-necky at all. If anything, there&apos;s enough woodwork to make the place look really upscale. Also, the club features the return of the famous brick wall for a stage, which hearkens back to the days when standup was performed in coffee houses and rathskellers, which almost always had brick walls (hence the tradition). Betcha didn&apos;t know that, huh?
There&apos;s an actual green room, which is small but functional, with access to the back service bar. There&apos;s only room for about four people to hang out, and two would have to stand, but the whole purpose of the green room is to have some privacy and get away from the crowd, so I would have to give it an &quot;A&quot; in that regard.
The sound system needed a little fine-tuning, as opener Matt Grippo played an electric ukelele (no shit) and at times, was a little difficult to hear. The lighting and stage were good, and the seating, while sterile and &quot;prison mess-hall&quot; style, was uncrowded and comfortable. And I guess the folks seated in the outside rows are just going to have to turn their seats and deal with the fact that the place to rest their drink is behind them.
One extremely classy touch that I thought was nice was the specialty drink menu which paid homage to comedians who had passed on and listed their birth-to-death dates under their names. John Belushi, George Carlin, Gilda Radner, Rodney Dangerfield, Sam Kinison and others were represented with signature cocktails, and to honor them that way shows a real deference to the art of comedy, and as a comedian, I was impressed. A lot of clubs have menus with cute comedy names for their food and beverage, but this was the first time I saw a list of exclusively departed talents and their date of passage included. Bravo, I say.
The club has enlisted quite a few veterans of the old club to come in and turn the wheels, and I think that&apos;s a good thing. The problems at the old club seemed to all be a product of the organization and cash-flow issues, and that doesn&apos;t seem to be a problem at this new venue. I performed for a nominal amount, and was presented with standard independent contractor paperwork, which is correct and how it should be....by the book. This will be no &quot;fast and loose with the cash&quot; enterprise, because the principals know that those are the holes that sunk the last boat. Some of the new faces (read; attractive wait staff) seemed a little vacuous; pretty, but in for a rude awakening the first time the place is sold out and the vikings want their mead. Whether you have serving experience or not, the comedy club is a totally different animal; there&apos;s no time to be standing around waiting to be told what to do, you have to bang those heels out to the showroom floor and rescue your customers from suckin&apos; ice. A show only lasts 90 minutes, sell those drinks!
The club isn&apos;t overly large, seating at around 200, which will prevent that &quot;empty room&quot; look when holidays and warm weather keep the folks away. It&apos;s outside of the city, in the town of Webster, but it&apos;s on the main drag and shouldn&apos;t have any problems being found by even the most far-flung westsiders who can easily jump on 490 and make the show if they give themselves half an hour (at the most).
So best of luck to Mark Ippolito and Joe Tantillo and their staff, I know they&apos;ll do a great job of representing comedy in Rochester, and a hearty thank you from me for including me in the opening day festivities. I feel like the President being asked to throw out the first pitch on opening day, except instead of one-hopping it to the plate, I felt like I got to strike out the first three batters. Even draggin&apos; ass from no sleep and a cross-country death drive, there&apos;s nothing like taking the stage in front of a hot audience.

 An American Prayer (The Doors) 
Posted on 09/02/2008 at 04:12 AM
I&apos;m mad as hell and I&apos;m not gonna take it anymore. That was a famous line from the movie &quot;Network&quot; which dealt with the power of the TV news, and this was back in the days before cable and sattelite television and the internet, when there were only a few voices being broadcast across the nation.
Now it&apos;s 2008, and with a Presidential election breathing down our collective neck, and the neck of the rest of the world, for that matter, the angry voices are echoing all across the cableverse, the internet, the opinion pages of newspapers and across the dinner tables and bars everywhere I go.
I want to raise my voice up to the heavens and cry &quot;Shut up! For God&apos;s sake, shut up! You&apos;re tearing our country apart!&quot; But I don&apos;t scream, because I could never be heard over the constant static. Trying to stop our fellow countrymen from continuing the divisive and angry speech is as fruitless as screaming at a crying child, hoping to compete for volume and stun it into silence. It just doesn&apos;t work that way.
We&apos;re one Democratic National Convention down and one Republican National Convention to go, and the players are in place. The unorthodox choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has caused a swell of enthusiasim in the discussion of politics, either to praise her selection or as red meat for the naysayers. Sadly, there&apos;s enough gasoline to go around to keep both fires burning.
And isn&apos;t that the problem? The lack of civil discourse in politcs is cut almost entirely whole cloth from the dilemma that we all, as Americans, want what&apos;s best for America, but disagree on how to best get that done.
We begin to discuss the issues, with the intended spirit of debate, rooted in Parliamentary procedure for such discussions. And we try to win the other side over with facts and figures, supposition and commentary, hypothesis and examination, until our point is made.
Except for the fact that both sides have valid arguments.
Well, then, the next step is to start shouting, and then the name-calling comes in. It&apos;s called an ad-hominem argument, from the Latin, literally, &quot;to the man,&quot; and basically consists of attacking the debater; you&apos;re an asshole, so your argument is false.
Do we deserve that in a Democratic society? Where every man&apos;s vote counts, every man has the right to form an opinion, educated or not, and vote accordingly?
For an example of the fiery rhetoric that has replaced civil discourse in this country, take a gander at what the comedians are squawking about over at www.roadcomics.com and choose a thread with more than ten replies. Those are the threads that are political in nature, and the fur is flying.
Now, you&apos;d think that comedians are all in the same boat, but that&apos;s not the case. We have a tendency to skew liberal, but there are a good many Red-Staters in the business (take a look at the Blue Collar Comedians as exhibits A, B, C, and Git &apos;Er D.
I&apos;ve always been pretty dour and humorless off stage, because comedy is comedy and business is business. I enjoy a laugh or two when I&apos;m in my civilian clothing, but mostly, I&apos;m engulfed in the increasingly difficult business of keeping my engagement calendar full and operating at a profit (high gas prices make travel by air and auto prohibitive, and buses and trains are just damn inconvenient). Also, for medical reasons, I don&apos;t drink anymore. Consequently, it&apos;s been difficult to loosen up.
But this political climate is working my last nerve, and I just don&apos;t know what to do anymore. I don&apos;t express my political views very often, and try to do so in a spirit of discussion and with openness to the contrary viewpoint. I believe in that whole &quot;more flies with honey&quot; approach, and there&apos;s bags of wisdom in that.
I&apos;ve been consuming political books lately like I&apos;m cramming for a civics exam. I&apos;m combing the internet, reading blogs, going through newspaper like a china shop moving across country. And all because I&apos;m looking for answers. I did the same thing the evening of September 11th, watching TV cable news, on the internet, bleary-eyed at 3 o&apos;clock in the morning, looking for answers. And I don&apos;t consider what&apos;s going on in this country any less of a disaster.
Every issue has two sides, or it wouldn&apos;t be an issue. And every issue can be debated with civility and respect, but apparently a lot of us don&apos;t have time for that anymore.
Guns, abortion, gay marriage, flag burning. Wedge issues. Issues designed to tear us into groups, to position political candidates. Immigration, free trade. The war in Iraq, Afghanistan. What to do about Iran, North Korea? The high price of gasoline? Flag pins? How many houses do you own? Is your teenage daughter pregnant, did you cheat on your wife, who gave you money? Did you flip flop?
How about, enough? Enough.
I could sit here and give you my opinion about all of this stuff, and I&apos;d be awake for 36 hours. But I only want to discuss one thing, one thing we can all agree on.
And that thing is What It Means To Be American.
I was a Cub Scout, and I got a little training in this area. I&apos;m no expert, but being American doesn&apos;t require you to be an expert.
Here&apos;s what I think it means to be an American.
Being an American means enjoying the freedom of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But also understanding that this freedom comes with the duty to respect the freedoms of others.
Being an American means welcoming people from all across the world, regardless of their faith, national origin, color or creed, as our own group was welcomed. Black folks, your boat ride was different, and I apologize, but my family didn&apos;t come to this country until about 50 years after slavery was abolished, so please keep my words in perspective.
Being an American means constantly striving towards innovation, in the fields of education, technology, economics, manufacturing, diplomacy, art, music, literature, and everything that is good about civilized society.
Being an American means protecting our shores, and being a leader around the world, defending opressed peoples and using our might to make the world a better place.
Being an American means sharing the fruits of our labors, giving back to the community which enriched us in the first place (use Bill Gates as a perfect example here), looking out for the general welfare, and reaching out to the poorest among us.
Being an American means having the opportunity to participate in a great Democratic experiment, pulled together by some of the finest thinkers ever assembled, and respecting the shoulders of the giants that we stand on today, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, James Monroe, John Adams.
Being an American means participating in a great Capitalist system as well, where everyone can have the opportunity to succeed, try the waters of the free market, and work their way into being a great success story.
There&apos;s more, but I think anyone with any training should understand what it means to be American. And shouting amongst ourselves, contributing to the smoke and mirrors that have replaced honest discourse, in my opinon only weaken our country.
So here&apos;s what I propose;
The next time someone starts blustering away with their political opinion, put your index finger to your lips, whether you agree with them or not, and go &quot;SSSSHHHHHHHHHH.&quot;
And let&apos;s try to get our collective silence back. Because silence breeds thought. And silence breeds calm. And maybe if we all calm down,
and start thinking again.....
....we can remember why it&apos;s so great to be American. And we can think about how to get things done, the work that we wish done to preserve our great nation and our great system.
Are you ready, America?

 All Fired Up (Fastway) 
Posted on 08/24/2008 at 04:11 AM
I&apos;m exhausted. The last 48 hours have whupped my ass, and I&apos;m still awake.
I&apos;m in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at the Comedy Zone (Hi Heff! Hi Joel!), and just rattling down from the adrenaline and caffeine from two great shows tonight with my friend, Matt Davis.
The last time I checked in, I was in San Antonio, Texas. Can I book a tour, or what? San Antonio in August. It was 102 degrees when I left that town. In Upstate New York, 102 degrees is a cooking temperature.
I stayed in my air-conditioned convenience apartment the whole week in Texas, not wanting to brave the daunting heat or sweat through my week&apos;s allotment of clothing. It was bad enough that I packed sparsely and still got whacked $50 for &quot;overweight luggage.&quot; I had to shift my stuff to a carry-on bag, which allowed me to make the weight limit. My question is, though, the airplane was still carrying the same amount of shit....how come I had to pay on the way down but not on the way back? It&apos;s a scam, and the airlines will bilk you for every dollar they can.
After my uneventful trip home, my back started giving out. I was schedule to play Rob&apos;s Comedy Playhouse in Buffalo, NY, and by that Saturday, I was a cripple hobbling around on a cane. I had a great time at the show, and even did improv with the other two acts, Danny Pordum and Mark Colona, but it was all word game stuff, because I wasn&apos;t up to doing anything physical. I drove to Buffalo up and back, with my pretty wife in tow in case I was unable to make the whole distance, but I was only having trouble standing, not sitting. Actually, sitting felt pretty comfortable.
By Monday, though, I was in great pain and Pamela begged me to call a chiropractor. I did, and I swear to God that as soon as I made the appointment, my back started getting better. By the time the appointment actually rolled around on Wednesday, I was fully upright and working around the house. I had even found time to work with my new software program that allows me to convert cassette tapes to CD. My first project was a live Bruce Springsteen concert that aradio station friend of mine bootlegged for me. The tape was almost 13 years old, and I&apos;d been freaking out about getting it transferred over because I know that tape is brittle and I didn&apos;t want to lose this concert, it was from the &quot;Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; tour and featured Bruce alone with his guitar in Philadelphia....a great show.
So here&apos;s where the torture comes in.
On Friday morning, I was scheduled to appear on The Break Room, which is the morning show on 96.5 FM, WCMF in Rochester. They had started doing a radio feature called &quot;Lemons to Lemonade&quot; which was basically bringing comedians on to their morning show to do their standup sets after commercial breaks, with the idea being that our local comedy club had recently closed, and this would be a nice outlet for the local comics.
I was scheduled to be in Harrisburg that night, but figured I would do the radio, make the five hour drive, do the shows, and then catch up on my sleep.
Here&apos;s the wrinkle; because I had been laid up in bed the whole week, my sleep pattern was all screwed up. I was sleeping in the day and prowling the house at night. So the night before radio/drive/shows, I was awake until 4:00 A.M.
When my alarm went off at 5:30, I knew I was boned.
I made the show and sucked down a big cup of coffee, and it went well. The whole time I sat in on the show, I was fixated on the fact that I was the only person in the room who was approaching 6:00 A.M. from the other side, the end of a long day with only a small nap to tide me over.
The show went great, they had done a &quot;man-on-the-street&quot; interview with some people, dropping my name in and seeing if they could get any sort of recognition reaction. One bit, they told a woman that John McCain was going to select me as his Vice-President, and the woman said she was going to vote for him no matter what. But no real recognition of my name or who I was, and this is in my home town where I&apos;ve been begging for attention for the last 20 years. Another woman they interviews and they told her that Buffalo Bills quarterback Trent Edwards had been hurt, and that I would have to start in his place, and she only replied that her son was a big fan, and that he knew about the injury. I took it in stride, but they did these bits with other comics as well, and I understand that some of them didn&apos;t appreciate it. Shit, it&apos;s morning radio....they don&apos;t make or break your career on morning radio.
So the show went well, and I realized that I wasn&apos;t going to get any sleep, so I packed up my luggage and headed off to Harrisburg. When I arrived, I found out they were on summer schedule, so we didn&apos;t have to do a late show, and I squeezed a one-hour nap for myself and then did a prairie fire of a set (blazing hot, and all over the place) that the people really seemed to like. After the show, I thought I would catch up on my sleep, but I get back to the room and CNN is on (it&apos;s always on in my hotel room) and the big news was announced that Joe Biden was Obama&apos;s veep pick.
Well, political junkie that I am, I stayed awake until I couldn&apos;t stand it anymore, right around 4 A.M. I would up sleeping almost twelve hours before I actually got up. I didn&apos;t even leave the Doc Holliday&apos;s/Conference Center. I ate in the restaurant, enjoying a nice salad and their signature Steak-Stuffed Poblanos (Yum!).
So tonight, we had two really good shows, and I&apos;m going to sleep in instead of trying to drive home overnight...my family has seen plenty of me and I&apos;m going to be home all this week, so the pressure&apos;s off. I&apos;m glad to be home, too, because I have a lot of catching up to do.
Before I go, my take on Biden is that it&apos;s a good pick. Hillary was obviously an automatic &quot;no,&quot; and that&apos;s a shame, because they would have had an avalanche of votes. Tim Kaine and Kathleen Sebelius would have been two &quot;who?&quot; candidates, and Evan Bayh was &quot;iffy.&quot; Bill Richardson had a whole lot of foreign policy experience, which would have been great, but I guess the powers-that-be decided that you couldn&apos;t have two minorities on the same ticket. That left Biden as a counter-punch to claims that Obama didn&apos;t have enough experience. My only gripe was that it makes up a ticket of two Northerners, so unless hordes of southern blacks come streaming into the voting booths in November, the Southeast United States is going to look pretty red on the map. But that&apos;s not exactly big news, Democrats don&apos;t do well in the South anyway, and I think it&apos;s a shame that Southerners piss away their economic self-interests on horseshit issues like gun ownership and abortion. I guess you get the government you deserve. I just hope all those displaced Hurricane Katrina victims re-registered to vote wherever they&apos;re living now. That oughta shake some things up.
O.K., I&apos;m going to bed. Please love each other and stop being stupid.

 Gangland (Iron Maiden)

Reporting live from San Antonio, Texas, in the efficiency apartment reserved for the talent performing at the Rivercenter Comedy Club, it&apos;s your old buddy Ralph chiming in from the road.
It&apos;s been a solid three weeks since I last blogged, and I have to admit that my attention has turned elsewhere as of late. When I&apos;m online, I&apos;m consumed by the comedian chatboard at www.roadcomics.com, the online home of the touring comic community. I&apos;ve also had a good chunk of my time taken up by the MySpace game &quot;Mobsters,&quot; which is fun and quite addicting. The game is played by completing missions such as carjackings, muggings, and beating up other gangsters and taking their money. It&apos;s a perfect way for me to vent my less-than-social tendencies.
The fact of the matter is, anything is better than facing real life right now. The economy is really taking a toll on me and my family. We bring home less money because I spend more on fuel to get to work, and little things have contributed to the erosion as well. For example, my merchandise sales are off this year by 18%. That only equates to a few hundred dollars, but the whole concept of merchandise sales are to help offset the fuel cost of getting to work. If the trend continues, I may find myself priced out of the game. I&apos;m sure the merchandise situation is directly due to folks feeling that they don&apos;t have the disposable income to waste on such purchases, and I guess in a lot of cases, I&apos;m lucky that folks are even showing up to the clubs at all. So I literally have to change course in this business, which is what I&apos;m in the process of doing, but it&apos;s like turning a battleship in midstream....because most work is booked six months to a year out, it&apos;s a big waiting game before any economic effects will be felt.
I did a tour of Michigan a couple of weeks ago that was both fun and profitable, because Funny Business Agency was able to string together a series of one-nighters within a tight geographical area. Consequently, travel expenses were lower, and the opportunity to work (and make money) increased. The cost, of course, was being away from home longer, but the name of the game in comedy has always been routing, and going home just eats into the profit margin.
Last week, I headlined a club called Wiseacres (Wiseacres Comedy Club, Best Western Tysons Westpark Hotel, McLean, Virginia) and we made a nice little family vacation out of it; Pam and Harmony made the 7-hour trip to Washington D.C. and we went to the National Zoo, did some shopping, and shook off the heat in the hotel pool. It was a great weekend, and even though the shows were &quot;summer crowds,&quot; (read: not all that numerous) they were great fun and it was fun having the family along.....it certainly made the drive easier with someone in the car to talk to, although in order to keep Harmony happy, we had to listen to her Wiggles, Blues Clues and DoodleBops CD&apos;s the whole way down and back.
After only a few days home, it was onto a plane to head down to Texas. The flight was booked through Expedia, so in order to get the best price possible and still arrive early enough to make my Wednesday show, I had to leave Rochester at 6 in the morning. That basically meant getting to the airport at 4 A.M., and when you arrive somewhere at that time of night/morning, it&apos;s always a crapshoot to figure out who actually got up that early, and who is just staying up late....there&apos;s really no comfortable time to approach 4 A.M.....you&apos;re either at the end of a ridiculously long day, or the beginning of a terribly uncomfortable one.
I made my connection in Newark, N.J., and during the direct flight to San Antonio, I fell asleep. I have sleep apnea, so I&apos;m sure I snore pretty loudly, and the flight wasn&apos;t full, so there were several seats open. I sat in an aisle seat, with an empty seat between me and the business traveler in the window seat, and he dealt with me o.k. because we were in the emergency exit aisle, and he didn&apos;t have to wake me to get past me to use the bathroom. My snoring must have been a problem, though, because there was a guy seated directly in front of me, and when I woke up after a couple of hours, he had disappeared.
So I&apos;m here in lovely San Antonio, and I usually try to work here in the Winter, but I&apos;m here in August which is no time for a fat man from the Northeast with a pasty white complection to be here. I usually like to stride along the Riverwalk which is goodexcercise, but the current outdoor temperature is one that I usually reserve for cooking food. I&apos;m working with &quot;Uncle&quot; Larry Reeb from Chicago, a great comic that I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working with before and a nice guy to boot, an excellent combination in this business. I&apos;ll probably try to get some writing done, if the pure distraction of &quot;Mobsters&quot; doesn&apos;t heist my free time. Also, the comedy club is located in the Rivercenter Mall, and they have a movie theatre there and the comics get to see movies for free, so I might wind up seeing &quot;Hancock&quot; or even &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; again (it was that good, my friends).
I hope your summer is going well. To my comedy buddies, please hang in there, everything is a cycle. The business goes up and down, you just have to be patient and do what you can to ride it out. And to my civilian friends, support your local comedy club, go see a show, and if you can afford it, buy a CD. It&apos;s only a few bucks out of your pocket, but it makes a huge difference to the comics.
NEWSFLASH! I just got word from the new comedy club in Rochester that their website is up and running. I haven&apos;t had a chance to see it yet, but the address is www.thecomedyclub.us so go check it out!
That&apos;s enough for me. Go get your summer!

 Dark Knight (M.O.D.) 
Posted on 07/18/2008 at 04:24 AM
Just got back to the hotel after catching a midnight screening of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (don&apos;t worry, no spoilers here). I&apos;m in Newport, Tennessee on a night off, and staying at my favorite low-budget hotel, the Motel 6. There just happened to have been a movie theater across the street offering the movie of the summer, so I decided to plunk down the money and check it out.
I won&apos;t get into the particulars of the film, but it was phenomenal. I was sitting amongst a group of young people (bad) at midnight (worse) in a small, rural town in Tennesee (oh Jesus, kill me now). And yet, as ill-behaved and chatty as they were during the previews, once the movie got started, they were quiet and focused on the spectacle up on the big screen.
The Batman franchise has been invigorated by the two newest films, washing the bad taste of the campy Joel Schumacher films out of our collective craw. Christopher Nolan is a wonderful visual story-teller (rent &quot;Memento&quot; if you haven&apos;t seen it yet....an amazing film) and he really does the Bat-franchise justice.
It&apos;s gotten to the point where super-hero films are becoming pretty evergreen, suitable for any season and drawing big box-office. As a long-time comic book collector, I take umbrage with some of the liberties that directors and screenwriters take with the source material sometimes, but even in the comic book industry itself, characters have been relaunched, killed, brought back from the dead, and given the old &quot;parallel universe&quot; treatment so many times that films jerking around with origin stories have almost become forgiveable.
I would like to think that society as a whole has caught up with what I and several million hard-core fans have known for years; that the super-hero genre is exciting, inspirational and fun. A lot of it also may be that the film-making technology has caught up with the genre and allowed filmmakers to proceed withough making movies that look &quot;clunky.&quot;
But closer to the truth is that I think we need heroes today, and pretty badly.
When Batman was first conceived, back in 1940 by creator Bob Kane, the country was fresh out of the Great Depression and the pot was being stirred for America to enter the second World War. Superman came first, Batman second, and then a whole pantheon of characters came around, heroes like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Arrow and the like, who can be seen on lunchboxes, bookbags, and a whole department store full of paraphenalia to this day. The current crop of super-hero movies (and their embrace by the general public) may be a reflection that the cycle of war and economic depression has come around again.
The Spider-Man films have done great box office, as have the X-Men and Fantastic Four, as well as the minor characters like Ghost Rider, Daredevil and the Punisher. Marvel has been very aggressive in getting their characters to the marketplace, and they&apos;ve got Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk into the theaters this year, with an Avengers movie being set up in the final frames of the aforementioned Hulk film.
But Batman is the character that has seemed to resonate with film viewers, and doubtlessly, this new film will give Spider-Man a run for his money as the big box-office champ. A lot of that will be the curiosity factor surrounding the departed Heath Ledger and his dark reading of the Joker in the film (and damn, was it a great job). But the character also taps into a need that I think we all have.
Superman and Batman are the big two, the characters that started it all. They are instantly recognizable all over the world, having been around for almost 70 years. And many people can recite the origins of the two characters, or at least give a pretty decent synopsis. Superman was the last son of the planet Krypton, rocketed to Earth by his father, Jor-El (Superman&apos;s Kryptonian name was Kal-El, El being the family name) and his mother, Lara. Kal-El&apos;s tiny rocket landed in a Kansas cornfield, and the baby was found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who adopted him as their own and named him Clark. Batman was the son of Dr. Thomas and Martha Wayne, and he watched them get gunned down in an alley after attending a movie (it was &quot;Zorro,&quot; Trivial Pursuit fans) by a stick-up man named Joe Chill.
It may have been a sign of the times that both characters suffered the loss of their birth parents, although Clark was provided with surrogate parents in the Kents and Bruce was taken care of by Alfred Pennyworth, the family butler. Still, the motivation behind the two characters were shaped by these losses and circumstances.
Clark was found to have super powers, a symptom of Earth&apos;s lighter gravity and yellow sun. When the Kents found out about these powers, they basically told their son that they didn&apos;t know why he could do the things that he could do, but that he ought to use those abilities to protect the weak, to defend people who couldn&apos;t fight for themselves. Clark Kent set a course from Smallville to Metropolis, to be closer to a large group of people who would benefit from his protection. The positioning of himself as a reporter at a newspaper was designed to put him in a place where incoming information would alert him to potential tragedies and disasters that he could intervene in and prevent. Bruce decided, after studying law in an effort to become either a policeman or a lawyer, that the law was sometimes too narrow to mete out true justice, and that guilty persons oftentimes walked away unpunished. His decision to deck himself out in the scary bat-garb was a response to his realization that criminals were a &quot;superstitious, cowardly lot&quot; and that he would scare them, giving himself the upper hand.
So we have Superman, the other-worldly boy scout, putting himself in a position to protect the weak, but it is Batman, the self-trained vigilante who positions himself to punish the guilty. This difference resonates with us today, in our uncertain world, where we need the reassurance that the bad people are brought to justice, punished for their misdeeds, rather than concerning ourselves with those who bring hope and shelter to the weak. Our entertainment gives us away. We have several crime shows, the newest offering being the CSI series that show through intense investigative lab work, the crime scene investigators will always get down to the truth of the matter and catch the murderers, rapists and other malcontents. There is no movement to portray the &quot;supermen&quot; who protect the weak. There are few documentaries of the people who are out there doing good, because that is boring to us. We crave retribution.
The whole idea of the death penalty is based on this idea. We cling to the Judeo-Christian notion that if we execute murderers, we somehow balance the scales and justice is done. But really, all that has happened is the application of the &quot;two wrongs make aright&quot; rule which has been disproven over and over again. And yet we want it, and we want it badly. I&apos;m so anti-death penalty, it isn&apos;t funny, but when the inevitable question comes up &quot;What if someone raped and murdered your sister? Your wife? Your daughter?&quot; Then I turn to my basest instincts and the next thing you know, I&apos;m installing step-up transformers on the chair and oiling those leather straps.
We need heroes, but we also need to look inside ourselves and find the part that is better than that spirit of retribution; we need to encourage ourselves to concentrate on protecting the weak, rather than exacting vengeance. It is no coincidence that Superman derives his powers from the light of the Sun, while Batman hides in the shadows. They are the Yin and the Yang, two sides of the same coin.
Years ago, I allowed a young lady to enter my life, and she was a drug addict. I invited her to live with me, and while I was away, playing at a comedy club in St. Louis, she stole almost all of my possessions and pawned them for drugs. When I returned home to see what she had done, sold my things and disappeared, did I become Superman or Batman? I&apos;ll give you a hint; I was on a nightly patrol, driving up and down the streets of my neighborhood, looking for a sight of her or anyone I knew from her group of drug friends. The sad punchline to the story is that I never caught her or even caught up with her, and I eventually gave up the patrol. What would I have done if I found her? At the time, I probably couldn&apos;t have answered that question. If I were to tell you that I would probably try to get her into a rehab program, or try to help her in some way, I would have been lying to you. She needed to be punished for betraying my trust the way she did, as though living the life of a drug addict wasn&apos;t bad enough.
So what am I trying to say here? I guess the moral of the story is try to use your strengths to protect the weak, because in the long run, it&apos;s more noble than trying to punish evil. You should never stop trying to fight evil, but you should also pick your fights accordingly.
I am inspired to write more, but I am also tired as it is ten after four in the morning and I really should get to bed. I thank you for reading, and hope you get to see &quot;The Dark Knight.&quot; It is a strong movie with great performances, some niftyplot twists, characters introduced that you probably wouldn&apos;t have expected, and all in all presents a fine morality tale for the ages. In the meantime, fight evil and protect the weak. We can be heroes, every day.

 You&apos;re A Better Man Than I (The Yardbirds) 
Posted on 07/01/2008 at 02:54 PM
Good morning from sunny Florida, where I am in the third week of my three-week summer tour. I am performing tomorrow night in Cordele, Georgia, for the Comedy Zone and then travel south to Fort Myers, Florida for my yearly engagement at the Laugh Inn Comedy Café.
I’ve been coming down to Florida for about five or six years now, starting when my late father begun experiencing health complications due to cancer (he passed away last year). I had planned a small Florida tour every year to visit Dad and stayed with him on the off-nights. It was a great way to both fill my summer tour schedule (Florida clubs don’t suffer the way clubs in other parts of the country do because of the hot weather; it’s hot all year so it’s not noticeable) and get a chance to keep in touch with my parents, make sure they were o.k.
My mom is still here in Florida, so I stay with her on my off-nights while I’m on tour. She doesn’t so much need my attention as her health is still pretty good, but I know she enjoys the visits and the company. Last night, she took me out to dinner with her buddies, the Karaoke Mafia (my nickname for her roving band of singers who hop bar-to-bar and sing, and there’s a different bar each night that hosts karaoke), and we sat on the lakeside deck of a seafood restaurant called Tailchaser’s and took turns warbling classic country and soft rock hits beneath a hazy setting sun as the ‘gators peered from the lake with their beady, red eyes.
This morning, I woke early to join my mother’s singing buddy, Rick, at the gated community’s clubhouse for coffee and chatter. Joining us were Rick’s mother and a friend of theirs, an older man who I will call “Howard.” We got to chit-chatting, and somewhere along the line, Howard mentioned that he felt there were “too many blacks on TV.” It was the sort of thing that startled me, but I recovered because once I thought about it, the bigotry didn’t surprise me…I’m speaking with a man who grew up with institutional racism, and the sad truth is that by the time most folks are in their late 20’s, their attitudes are already in place for the rest of their lives.
So I didn’t make mention of my offense, because I didn’t see the point in confronting it; this man wasn’t going to change and there was no reason for me to try, or even to show my distaste. The bottom line was that this clubhouse was part of his home, and I was a visitor, and it was in better taste to hold my tongue. But I’m also not the type to let a lesson go unlearned.
Howard continued by mentioning that someone forwarded him a funny cartoon in his morning e-mail, and the cartoon featured Barack Obama, with blacks running away from him in every direction. The caption read “Why Blacks won’t vote for Obama” and the word balloon coming out of Obama’s mouth said “If I am elected President, every American who can work will have a job.”
Now, I’m a comedian and I enjoy a good joke. Hell, I even enjoy a bad one from time to time. But today, I just wasn’t willing to absorb this talk, so I responded with humor. And I peppered the conversation with every “old fart” joke I could remember. I did it with a smile on my face, like there was nothing wrong, and I was just being part of the party. I didn’t bother to mention that my wife is of African American descent; it just didn’t seem necessary. And so the coffee klatch broke up, uncomfortably, and I’m guessing it was probably because Howard had to pee.
The reason I even bring this up is that my mother made a statement a few weeks ago, (in front of people!) that America still isn’t ready for a black President. When she said it, in front of my wife, my sister-in-law and her parents, and me, I thought it just to be a very narrow-minded, tasteless thing to say. Either she didn’t remember my wife’s ethnic heritage or chose to ignore it, either way I shriveled inside, that embarrassed, pain-in-the-balls feeling that you get when you bring someone to the party and they piss in the punch bowl.
At the time, I dismissed my mother’s statement as pithy; she’s not exactly a political genius. I once made reference to the “thousand points of light” comment from Bush 41’s inaugural address (and this was while he was still in office!) and she had no idea what I was talking about. But after hearing Howard make his comments this morning, about “too many blacks on TV” and the Obama cartoon, I had to deal with the sobering fact that this man’s generation, folks in the United States entering retirement age, now represent a huge chunk of the voting public. And their attitudes were put in place in the 50’s and early 60’s, that magical time when blacks weren’t welcome at certain lunch counters, were set upon with dogs and fire hoses, and still got the stink eye if they mingled with whites.
Some of my mom’s karaoke buddies were a little younger than the rest of the group, and living in redneck Florida (Fishin’ Boat Florida, I calls it), I was holding out hope that they weren’t just towing the party line. Luckily, they were not; they were Obama Democrats, and we spoke joyfully about donating money to the cause (the wife, Barbara, a little more joyous than Denton, the husband) and volunteering to register the thousands of unregistered black voters to help turn the tide.
Everything happens for a reason, and my coffee invitation this morning opened up my eyes. There’s still a lot of work to be done in this country. And I know that Howard isn’t reading this blog today, but if he did, the thing I would say to him this morning is that there are two men running for President this year, one of them young and black, and one of them old and white. And if the black one wins, old people will be treated with kindness, fairness, equality and love. Their opinions will be considered and they will have a place at the table. Their medical needs will be attended to, and their dignity will be protected.
If the reverse happens, could Howard say the same? What will America look like then?
I don’t like to think about it. And the more I hear, the more I feel that we need just one more black on television. Standing on the steps of the Supreme Court with his hand on a bible.

 Talk Dirty (John Entwistle) 
Posted on 06/23/2008 at 03:06 AM
The news has just been released that George Carlin passed away in Los Angeles from heart failure at the age of 71. I am hurt and confused, and feeling an enormous sense of loss. George Carlin was a hero of mine, a living legend whom I had the privilege to work for and with for a short period of time.
I discovered George Carlin the way many people did; through listening to his comedy albums growing up. I still have a copy of &quot;Toledo Window Box&quot; that is well-worn, but never fails to please. As a young comic, I remember watching one of his HBO specials with my comedy buddy, Ricky Kingston, and after the show was over, we both made the statement that we should just quit comedy, because there was no way that we would ever write anything as amazing as what we just saw and heard. The HBO special was released as the CD &quot;Jammin&apos; In New York,&quot; and it is one of the most singularly perfect standup specials I have ever seen, and I&apos;ve seen &apos;em all.
I entered into the Carlin organization&apos;s employ back in 1995. I was recently laid off from my position at WCMF in the research department, and looking for another gig. I used to do a radio show at WITR, the FM station operated by the students of the Rochester Institute of Technology, and as a community volunteer, I warmed the airwaves every Monday night with a heavy metal and hard rock show called &quot;Sudden Death Overtime.&quot; One evening, on a bathroom break, I walked down the hallway in the Student Center at R.I.T., and noticed they had a &quot;job board.&quot; There was an index card tacked up that said, in part, &quot;assistant road manager&quot; and &quot;George Carlin.&quot;
Well, I almost pissed myself right there. I thought it must be a hoax, or who knows what, but come to find out, it was legitimate. George Carlin&apos;s manager, Jerry Hamza, was originally from Rochester, and part of the booking office&apos;s infrastructure was located in Rochester, even though Jerry was living and working primarily in California. I met with Jerry, Jr., who served as the Road Manager for Carlin, and interviewed with him and got the job as his assistant.
For a period of about 16 months, I drove around with Jerry, Jr. in a Ford Bronco, all around the United States, supporting George&apos;s never-ending comedy tour. Most people don&apos;t ever get a chance to see their heroes, or even meet them, much less see them work every night and even get a chance to share a few words with them. I got to do all that, and more. George was a real family man, of Irish-Catholic descent, and had a strong sense of family loyalty. He never treated me like a hireling, always treated me with respect, and he laughed and joked with us as equals. Too many times in life, you place your faith or worship in a celebrity and you find out that behind closed doors, they were a bastard, or at the very least, less than you had imagined. George Carlin was as far from bastard as you could possibly be.
I admired George&apos;s work ethic. On a few occassions, I found myself seated in a limo or on a plane with George, and was able to watch him work. He carried a briefcase, and in the briefcase were several yellow legal pads, magazines, notebooks. He would take them out, write, replace them, take out another pad, write some more, working on bits, ideas for TV specials, constantly working and producing. He would leaf through magazines, tear out articles to be consumed at a later time, and the remainder of the magazine would be discarded. He was always on the move, working, working, working.
One story that I enjoy repeating concerns George and the way he interacted with the public. For a star of George&apos;s stature, he seemed a bit guarded, and with good reason; there are a lot of flakes out there. You can&apos;t just sit in the middle of the street and let just anyone sidle on up to you when you&apos;re a household name. But George was not the type to just offer the stiff-arm to folks that would recognize him. On the morning of a concert appearance in Houston, Texas, the crew of the show were staying in the Ritz-Carlton, and George and I were staying on the same floor. We waited for the elevator together, and this was around 1 o&apos;clock in the morning. A married couple in their 50&apos;s were returning from whatever nighttime activity they were engaged in, and came to wait for the elevator alongside George and myself. George was wearing his usual ballcap and sunglasses, enough of a disguise to give folks pause and back them off from recognizing him immediately, but we were talking when the couple came up behind us and George&apos;s voice was always very distinct. The couple got on the elevator with us, and the gentleman told George that he recognized him, and George was very flattered. They wound up talking, and before the elevator ride was over, George had removed a copy of his then-brand new book &quot;Brain Droppings&quot; from his bag, and had autographed it and given it to this couple. It was a very classy and sincere gesture, and showed how appreciative George was of his public.
George&apos;s achievements are amazing; his career has spanned generations, and he&apos;s become accessible to millions of people who recognize him from his appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show, the Tonight Show, Saturday Night Live (in which he was the first guest-host EVER), film roles in &quot;Dogma,&quot; &quot;Bill and Ted&apos;s Excellent Adventure,&quot; &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,&quot; as well as a season and half of his own sitcom &quot;The George Carlin Show,&quot; and he was even the conductor on the children&apos;s show &quot;Shining Time Station.&quot; He has written and filmed a new HBO special every two years since 1980, and is one of the most prolific and copied (we could fairly also say &quot;stolen from&quot;) standup comic in history.
George&apos;s standup routines are stuff of legend; there are thousands of people out there who can practically recite the classics word-for-word; &quot;Cars and Driving,&quot; &quot;Football and Baseball,&quot; and of course, &quot;The Seven Words You Can&apos;t Say On Television.&quot; It is the only standup comedy routine ever to be quoted in a Supreme Court decision, and the precedent remains in place today. It is this single achievment that I feel describes the higher calling of the standup comic. As a comedian, I can make an audience laugh by speaking on a number of subjects, but when I can also delight the part of their brain that dictates logical thought, when I can make them think and absorb an absurdity of every day life, then I have really tapped into something powerful.
For me, George Carlin was the blueprint by which perfect comedy is designed. You can still hear the echos of his topical voice in the works of Chris Rock, Lewis Black and Bill Maher. You can hear the descendant observations of his work in the musings of Jerry Seinfeld, his absurdity in the ramblings of Emo Phillips, Bobcat Goldthwait and Steven Wright, his wordplay in the work of Gary Shandling and Albert Brooks.
When I first started to decide to do standup comedy, the comics I looked up to were Eddie Murphy (hottest thing around at the time), Richard Pryor and George Carlin. I never saw Pryor live, but I cherish the chance I had to meet George and watch him work, night after night, unflinching, offering up &quot;goofy shit&quot; or political observations or dirty jokes, or ruminations on the little things that bind us all together. I cherish watching him control an auditorium full of people, night after night, young and old, black and white, male and female, wealthy and working-class. And I cherish watching him, night after night, slaughter sacred cows with a twinkle in his eye.
We are lucky, that we have hours of film footage of George in his element, prowling on a standup comedy stage, hours of recorded concerts filled with wonderful, scathing routines, books filled with observations that could only come from George. I&apos;m luckier still that I have the wonderful memories of my time with George, and that I can pick up the torch and carry it forward.
George, I miss you buddy. Rest in peace.

 You&apos;re Gonna Get Yours (Public Enemy) 
Posted on 06/20/2008 at 09:43 AM
Well, I&apos;d like to make an official correction. I originally reported that the Comix Cafe was closed by the IRS...that turned out to not be the case.
The club was, in fact, due to be evicted from their space and the liquor board pulled the club&apos;s license. In the bar and restaurant business, you have to have a wholesale distributor provide any alcohol that you offer for resale; you can&apos;t just go buy it at a liquor store and stock your bar. The club had not been receiving product from any of the major distributors in Rochester, voiding the liquor license.
The IRS most likely would have been next, as the club has had self-proclaimed tax liabilities for at least a year; the owner told me that himself but assured me that &quot;things were getting back on track.&quot; Plans to move to another venue are reportedly in play, but liquor licenses are specific to premises, so it&apos;s not like you could just take the old license and go somewhere else.....it doesn&apos;t work that way.
In other news, I&apos;m in sunny Florida, driving around in my newly acquired road vehicle, a black Toyota Camry. It&apos;s great on gas, comforable as my old Corolla (RIP), and even though it is a pre-owned vehicle, shows little wear. I took off Wednesday morning for Bluefield, West Virginia, and an engagement at Kelsey&apos;s, where I worked with Kris Shaw from Indianapolis. The crowd was a typical Kelsey&apos;s crowd, but I tried to enjoy myself anyway. Thursday, I got four hours of sleep before I had to start heading south to Tallahassee, a 10-hour drive. Wednesday&apos;s drive was nine hours, and today I&apos;m looking forward not to be driving around. I also fell victim to the &quot;black car curse;&quot; the idea that red, black and white cars are pulled over for speeding disproportionately. I drew a speeding ticket in Virginia, which I am adding to my growing collection. I did find out that everything&apos;s cheaper in Virginia than the rest of the country; gas is running $3.77 there versus $4 or more everywhere else, and the ticket was only $131 versus an average of around $160 everywhere else. Shoot, I may have to move there.
Last night I appeared at the Comedy Zone in Tallahassee. It is an excellent club, laid out to exact specifications by Mr. Heffron of the main office. As an individual with comedy club management experience, I can say without a doubt that the club couldn&apos;t be designed any more efficiently, from the location of the bathrooms to the layout of the kitchen and service bar, to the customer&apos;s-eye view from the front door to their seat in the showroom. Everything is designed to provide an overall great comedy experience for the audience.
My show? I was road-weary from my two consecutive marathon sessions in the vehicle and inadequate sleep, but I was still satisfied with what I put on stage. I got two applause breaks (I left out a new bit that has been money in the bank lately, to my chagrin) and got bags of kudos after the show. I&apos;m not one to pat myself on the back, but it&apos;s become painfully obvious to me that in this business, there aren&apos;t exactly a lot of folks lining up to do it, so in the interest of keeping my morale up in the face of $4 gas and flagging profits, I&apos;ll bend my elbow and do it myself.
After the show, a good number of folks hung out, and that&apos;s a good indicator of how well the show went. I didn&apos;t watch headliner Will Marfori, opting instead to park my carcass at the bar and enjoy some chicken wings, and suck down diet Cokes, hoping the caffeine would keep me awake and alert enough to do the meet-&apos;n&apos;-greet after the show. That&apos;s an old Yuk Yuk&apos;s trick I learned way back in the day; after the show, always be available in the front lounge to pal around with guests, it adds to their overall comedy club experience. It also doesn&apos;t hurt when you&apos;re trying to sell your CD or DVD after the show.
I wound up hanging around with Jay, the mc for the week, and a group of women who were in town for training for some sort of computer criminology field. They tried their best to explain to me in detail what it was they did, but I missed most of it because I am not technical in nature and writing this blog is as deep into computers as I get. They introduced themselves as Kara, Mara and Dara (their real names) but I already gave them my own nicknames, Jiggles, Princess, Mom, Sarge, and the two Quiet Girls. They were fun folks, and I&apos;m glad the club is drawing such excellent numbers, with an almost sell-out crowd on a Thursday night. A tip of my hat to all involved, and to Paul, the manager, who made me feel more comfortable than I am in my own home (specifically, he didn&apos;t ask me to do dishes or cut the lawn).
I&apos;m in Tallahassee for the next two days, and then it&apos;s off to Fort Walton Beach, the site of last year&apos;s unfortunate &quot;Ralph trapped in the men&apos;s room stall with no toilet paper&quot; episode. Suffice to say, I&apos;m going to be more careful this year.
Happy Summer to you all!

I guess I&apos;m not the only one hurting over the Comix Cafe closing it&apos;s doors. Among other entries from other comedians and responses from folks who read my blog, J.J., the owner of the Cafe, sent me this love letter:
I really appreciate your fictional writing skills as well my attorney, who will soon have copy of your slanderous blog.
I hope you have alot of leaves. First of all get the truth straight, you left Ed&apos;s club in total chaos. Just ask him.
You were a bad manager. you wanted to be a great comic but the truth is your peers are much better and that bother you..&gt;&gt;&gt;.just ask them. Ralph get out of comedy. Go back too asian noodle as a bartender. You frist have too except your limitations. Slandering me will not help you become a better comic or change your character.
My IRS returns show different then what you stated. See you in count you can take that to the leave pile .
Will see you at comic cafe .....&gt;&gt;&gt;soon right???
Well, I hate to just ignore such a heartfelt missive, so I responded:
Thanks JJ. I went back and read what I wrote, and everything I wrote was either truth that I can document, get others to witness to, or is my opinion and stated as such.
I feel perfectly comfortable with you wanting to sue me for slander as I&apos;m sure you have no case. If you want to go through the legal somersaults, I&apos;ll be happy to go along.
In the meantime, this piece of fiction you just sent me is worthwhile to be reproduced, don&apos;t you think?
Ralph
p.s. How could you misspell the name of your own club &quot;comic cafe&quot; at the very end?
Some clarifications: &quot;asian noodle&quot; is a restaurant called Aja Noodle Company that I bartended lunches at early on in my road comedy career. I left there after a year or two, after I had established myself with enough booking agents to fill my schedule.
&quot;I left Ed&apos;s club in total chaos, just ask him.&quot; My conversations with Ed within the last six months revealed otherwise, unless he was just being nice to me, in which case, shame on you, Ed.
I&apos;m a bad comic, but I&apos;ve had all of two weeks off since my daughter was born, four years ago? I stand by my statement that J.J. doesn&apos;t know anything about comedy.
And finally, if spelling is any indication, then I think those IRS returns were filled out in crayon.
Oh, and before I forget....you want your lawyer to sue me for slander? Doesn&apos;t that poor guy have enough to do?

 Yesterday (The Beatles) 
Posted on 06/13/2008 at 02:50 AM
My home club is dead.
The Comix Cafe in Rochester followed it&apos;s sister, the Buffalo Comix Cafe, into demise on Tuesday when the IRS came and locked the doors.
I tell people that I used to run the club, but in fact, I used to live there.
A few people have asked me what went wrong, why the club went away, and the closer to the club you were, the more apparent the flaws were. The cracks in the frame of the place were obvious to everyone except the people who were in a position to fix them.
The Buffalo Comix Cafe closed last summer after a 20-year-run. The club was opened by Ed Bebko and Rob Lederman, who together booked one-nighters throughout western New York back in the 1980&apos;s when the comedy boom was just getting started. They booked the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Judy Tenuta and Colin Quinn when they were just starting out, barely names of any recognition.
Ed and Rob were partners in other businesses until they started booking comedy, and Rob had some success touring for the Funny Bone chain of comedy clubs. Eventually, they decided to just open their own club in Buffalo, and it was successful for ten years until they decided to move into the Rochester market.
Rochester had strong comedy clubs in the 1980&apos;s and early 1990&apos;s, and eventually all competition was pushed out by one club, and then that club went under, a victim of it&apos;s downtown location (Rochestarians went downtown with great reluctance) and a flagging economy and a dearth of comedy on television, stanching the desire to see standup performed live, rather than whetting the appetite for more of the same. When Hiccup&apos;s, the last full-time comedy venue in Rochester, closed it&apos;s doors in 1995 or &apos;96 (I forget when it happened exactly), Ed and Rob made the decision to move in. They opened the Comix Cafe&apos;s Rochester location in the summer of 1997, and after much study of the area, decided on a suburban location in the town of Brighton, south of the city and near the prosperous towns of Pittsford, Penfield and Fairport.
Ed and Rob&apos;s goal was to replicate the success they had in Buffalo with the club in Rochester. Rob was the face of the Buffalo club, extremely popular due to his position on the 97 Rock morning radio show with anchor Larry Norton, and they needed someone to fill that role in Rochester. At the time, the perfect man for the job was Tiny Glover. Tiny had performed in Buffalo and gained Ed and Rob&apos;s attention, and they tapped Tiny to be the face of the Comix Cafe. Using his busy schedule performing at schools, doing workshops and just generally getting out in front of people all the time, Tiny was able to &quot;paper&quot; the house until folks started coming out to the club on their own (paper in the comedy business meaning giving out free tickets or putting names on the &quot;guest list&quot;). Tiny hosted every Friday and Saturday, and was the perfect spokesman for the fledgling club. He was popular, clean, personable, and loved by all. The success of the club was due to his efforts more than possibly anyone else (Ed and Rob&apos;s efforts notwithstanding).
Along the way, Ed had acquired a telemarketing plan originally devised by Garvin&apos;s Comedy Club, which required a team of phone operators calling homes and business and offering free tickets to come to the club. Ed wanted Tiny to head up the department, implement it, put it into place, but Tiny declined; his daytime schedule was too pressing at that time, and it would have been difficult to commit to. Instead, Tiny contacted someone who he felt would be a good fit for such a position; and that someone was I.
I had just recently been downsized out of a position at WCMF in Rochester, where I headed up the Research department. Our duties included calling residences in the area and quizzing folks about their radio listening habits as well as their musical likes and dislikes. I worked in that department for about five years when the corporate axe fell, choosing to outsource the research department to a private consulting firm. This left me available to take the telemarketing job, which I attacked with gusto, revolving it around my tour of duty with the George Carlin tour. I eventually left the Carlin tour when I was offered the General Manager&apos;s job by Ed in February of 1998. I started beefing up the telemarketing department and eventually the club expanded to include Sunday operations to supplement what we were already doing Wednesday through Saturday. Our business plan was simple; offer free tickets to our comedy shows, get folks through the doors and sell them food and drinks.
Working at the Comix Cafe was the time of my life. I enjoyed the opportunity to mesh my talents of management (previously relegated to retail endeavors) along with my love of comedy and my recently developed phone skills. I developed an e-mail data base, even before I owned a computer, and did data entry and sent out newsletters from the public library on my day off. Our shows were great and eventually, after the addition of Andy Clawson (an extremely good performer and eventual manager) in our telemarketing department, we didn&apos;t have an empty seat in our 250 seat showroom any of our nights of operation. We had a dynamite mc group, consisting of Steve Burr, T.L. Johnson, Douglas Berryhill, and myself. I wasn&apos;t able to start an open mic, which I thought was key to a club being able to develop a local talent base, but got around that by offering comedians guest spots on every show I could get away with. I knew what it was like to be a comedian starting out, and didn&apos;t want the new talent to have to suffer the way I did. I made a home for everyone, made my servers and bartenders money, put on great shows that our audiences enjoyed, and made Ed what I have to believe, after rent and expenses, was a good amount of money. Everything was going great.
Then I went and fucked it up.
My health started failing. I had an undiagnosed thyroid problem, I was overweight, heart disease, high blood pressure, and falling arches. My diet was atrocious, consisting of whatever I could shove in my mouth on the run, and exacerbated by 12-hour days. I would run in the club at 3:30 in the afternoon and stay until the bar closed at 2:30, count the money and make up a deposit, and be home by 3:30 in the morning. In addition, I was getting frustrated that the only stage time I could enjoy was hosting one week a month and the occasional fill-in spot. I watched local comics move up and move on, I watched our out-of-town guest comics having great fun, and I wanted a slice of that pie. Also, my wife never saw me; I only had Mondays and Tuesdays off, and that was if the refrigeration in the club didn&apos;t go on the fritz, or there wasn&apos;t a special event or someone rented out the room. I needed to make a change, to get out of the club.
I went back on the road, formally leaving the club in June of 2001. Ed had offered me ownership less than two years before, but I didn&apos;t understand what that meant and wasn&apos;t sure I would be up to it, financially or otherwise. In retrospect, it was the biggest mistake of my life to turn it down.
When I left, the search was on to find a replacement for me, and the first attempt came in the guise of Paul Slater, formerly of the Buffalo Funny Bone. At Ed&apos;s request, I stayed on long enough for Paul to get his feet wet, and a year later, he left and was replaced by J.J. Parrone. This was the beginning of the end.
I didn&apos;t like J.J. from the start. He once said to me that he envisioned Ed&apos;s money as &quot;a big pile of leaves&quot; and that his job was to stop them from blowing away. Such avarice, I thought, would only be trouble, and the insistence that the leaves were blowing away, showed a lack of grasp on the situation. The tree was healthy, and producing leaves every week!
J.J. started out as the General Manager, and eventually bought the club from Ed. J.J. didn&apos;t know anything about comedy (he once bragged about being able to get Steinfeld to work the club), and his management style was to surround himself with weak individuals who could be either bullied or were so loyal, they would never say &quot;no&quot; to him. Again, at Ed&apos;s behest, I stayed on to show J.J. the ropes, and J.J. went about putting the ropes around my neck. He dismantled the bookkeeping system. He eliminated the petty cash. He started raising menu prices and cutting portion sizes, turning the club into a &quot;clip joint.&quot; He watered down the booze, or at least poured well liquor into top shelf bottles. He stripped the telemarketing department of any incentive to do their jobs, took away Andy&apos;s commissions and eventually fired him. He put security systems in place to micromanage minutiae that didn&apos;t need to be there; in a club that issued free tickets for a living, he maniacally demanded that the tickets be counted every night, suspecting that the box office staff was issuing free tickets for paid admissions and pocketing the cash. And he neglected the club. He became a ghost around the place, appearing only now and then to yell at the staff, on the sales floor, in front of guests. I had to pull him off of Lisa Kyper, one of our servers, and plead with him to take her into the office or the kitchen to yell at her, but not in the main service aisle three minutes before showtime. Every day, I went to work in fear of what was to come next; he hired five managers to do the work of two, and every day, it seemed like he had a new complaint about what I was doing wrong, or what I wasn&apos;t doing at all. My chest ached just walking into the place, and so I removed myself.
My biggest complaint with J.J. was that he looked upon comedians as an obstacle; they were all greedy, looking out for themselves, and getting in the way. If comedians were hanging out in the back of the room, watching the show and nursing a beer, they were poachers and needed to be swept out as soon as possible. They were not welcome in any way. And his judgment of touring comedians was asinine to say the least; good, crowd-pleasing acts were passed over in favor of comics who just happened to be Italian. And J.J. had no problem being bullied around by big-name special acts who would talk him into booking their friends at outlandish pay-scales, which he would say &quot;yes&quot; to in order to appear savvy. He booked talent that he personally liked, with no regard as to whether the audiences would appreciate them.
The business stayed healthy for a few years. Every time I thought the place would implode, J.J. would resurface, flush with cash and a new lease on life. Purported gambling debts (he opened a sat club in Syracuse allegedly first scouted on a trip to Turning Stone Casino) started draining the club of the ability to pay their debts in a timely manner, and the club&apos;s credit rating went all to hell. Ed tried to put some checks and balances in place by installing Mike Glosek, a comic from Buffalo and a good friend of his for years, to help run the place, but it was too little, too late, and J.J. treated Mike like a spy anyway, and tortured him the same way he tortured me.
An attempted club in Aruba seemed to be an escape, a hide-out for J.J., and eventually closed. The hotel was owed thousands of dollars, and threw J.J. out on his ear.
I&apos;m leaving out a whole bunch of details and supportive evidence, but none of it matters; there&apos;s a long trail of bounced checks, employees who quit, stories of disaster surrounding the last days of the Comix Cafe. The club was mismanaged into the ground, the cash flow wasn&apos;t managed with any due diligence, and the leaves have blown away. And this past week, the IRS came through and took all the stems and cut down the tree.
I have an aching in me that I&apos;ll never get rid of, that with a little more courage or discipline, that club would be mine today and a good place to perform (for the comics) or see a show (for the audience) or make a nice living (for the servers, bartenders, box office workers, telemarketers). I allowed a monster to be unleashed on the world, and probably destroyed him, too. He&apos;s almost certainly looking at bankruptcy at best and jail time at worst, for tax evasion or fraud or who knows what else if you believe what you hear on the street. His sin was that of greed, but more than that, vanity. He had a system in place, handed to him on a silver platter, and he thought we were nuts, that he could make it so much better.
And I&apos;ll bet you a big pile of leaves that he really believed it.

 Selling The Drama (Live) 
Posted on 06/06/2008 at 10:48 PM
Good evening, bitches.
That&apos;s how my good friend Chad Riden from Tennessee sometimes greets his audience when he&apos;s hosting a standup comedy show somewhere across the United States. I thought I would use it in my blog because I&apos;m not working any-damn-where this week.
My comment earlier tonight to my wife after looking back on the week is that it&apos;s been like a vacation, but without that irritating vacation pay to have to deal with. Other professions get one, maybe two weeks paid vacation a year. Standup comics are independent contractors and have no such luxury. This week just happened to be a week off because no work presented itself and try as I might, I was able to scratch no employment out of the dirt.
So, the lemons equals lemonade formula dictates that I treat the week as an opportunity.
Sunday was a travel day home from Charleston, West Virginia. The trip was only about eight hours but it ate up most of the day. I got my rental car back to the airport a couple of hours early, and then Pam and Harmony and I went out for a bite to eat.
Monday, we hit the ground runnin&apos; and opened an eBay store. I have a huge collection of heavy metal magazines from the 80&apos;s, heavy metal albums from the 80&apos;s (many of which were small, independent labels that only produced 1,000 or so copies and hence said albums can be considered rare), and comic books I&apos;ve been collecting for almost 35 years. We spent a good deal of time listing those items, and scanning and listing the items at top speed still only let us put about 10 or 11 items up at a time. If you&apos;re interested in having a look-see, you can go here: eBay Store - Collector&apos;s Comics and Magazines: If for some reason the link doesn&apos;t work, feel free to cut and paste this -&gt; http://stores.ebay.com/Collectors-Comics-and-Magazines_W0QQssPageNameZl2QQtZkm into your browser. Or e-mail me if you&apos;re looking for anything specific. Chances are good that I have it and just haven&apos;t listed it yet.
We started looking for replacement cars today; my Corolla&apos;s been dead for over a year and I&apos;ve really been dragging my feet looking for a replacement. We looked at a few different cars, test-drove three or four, but haven&apos;t found anything we liked yet that&apos;s really in our price range. I&apos;m a no-frills kind of guy; if I have to crank a window open by hand, I&apos;m good with that. I&apos;ve never been stuck with a crank window frozen into the &quot;down&quot; position, and a good pouring rain running down my neck as I tried to figure out how to get the sucker back up. Power windows, power locks and power mirrors to me are all things that can go faulty on you....it&apos;s just more stuff to have to repair as the car gets older. Pam feels that power everything is &quot;basic&quot; to what a car should have, below that you might as well be on a Greyhound Bus. Sometimes I wonder where the good old-fashioned girl I married went off to....
I nailed down some more work this week, which is always cool, even though I&apos;m &quot;on vacation.&quot; My upcoming Summer tour to Florida is shaping up to be a good one, with plenty of work while I&apos;m down there. I cut back the tour this year to three weeks based solely on the fact that that was all the work I could scrounge for that period of time. I&apos;ll have a weekend off when I get back to prepare for the big Tetta/Davis annual picnic, this year taking place at Powdermills Park. The flyer looks like this:
SAVE THE DATE! YOU ARE INVITED TO THE &quot;SORT-OF-ANNUAL-DAVIS/TETTA-FAMILY-&amp;-FRIENDS-PICNIC.&quot;
SUNDAY, JULY 13TH, 2008, we have rented the RAND LODGE at POWDER MILLS PARK.
Pam and Ralph will start the grill at high noon,and will begin partying around 12:30pm-ish. We will continue to party until 9pm-ish. (As you are in the inner circle, you already know that all of Pam&apos;s times are &quot;ish&quot;...)
We supply the hamburgers and hotdogs for this shindig,
and we ask that everyone bring a small dish/dessert to pass.
Chocolate is always in good taste...
There will be games to play and gossip to dish all day long!
Drop in when you can, leave when you want!
This is a fun and relaxing time to hang-out and
enjoy a nice summer day at a friendly soiree!
Please RSVP BY JULY 11TH as to how many will be coming with you,
so we&apos;ll know how much to buy.
This is THE EVENT OF THE SEASON!
Don&apos;t miss it!
Also, please update us with your mailing address,
so we can be sure to keep you on the Christmas Card list too! :)
And, if you need directions, check out the Powder Mills Park website to:
Get driving directions to the park.
(You&apos;ll need to use YOUR address, unless you&apos;re starting at our place.)
Download the park map.
Seriously, if I can find work for that weekend that&apos;s close to home, I&apos;m gonna take it....vacations are for people who hate their jobs. I happen to love mine.
Tomorow, we&apos;re heading to Syracuse to see my new niece, Victoria Anne Tetta. I know I&apos;ll be climbing the walls by Saturday night with no gig to go to, but I&apos;ll get over it. It&apos;s like when I give a blood sample every three months at my doctor&apos;s office....it hurts, I don&apos;t like it, but it&apos;s quick and then I get back to my life.
Maybe somewhere along the line, I&apos;ll actually get some writing done that matters. That was a goal for the week, and it&apos;s been largely (actually, totally) ignored in favor of taking my daughter to the park, spending time with my wife, and doing some Hazel-the-maid tasks around the house. And that&apos;s not such a bad thing; I probably wasn&apos;t going to write the new &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; this week, or even &quot;Salem&apos;s Lot.&quot; I do, however, have a series of &quot;radio plays&quot; that I want to get down on paper, and then get some voice talents to perform them and put out a CD. I have some great ideas, including a sketch that addresses the George Carlin debate, &quot;Can rape be funny?&quot; I think I have an idea that broaches the subject tastefully and draws the comedy out in a way that&apos;s never been done before. I just have to write it.
O.K., I&apos;m gonna stop blogging now and go write it. Thanks for reading.

 Civil War (Guns &apos;N&apos; Roses) 
Posted on 05/31/2008 at 04:52 AM
Good morning from Charleston, West Virginia. I&apos;m getting ready to sack out after my grueling one-show evening here at the Comedy Zone (Hi, Heff and Joel!) in the Ramada Inn. I&apos;m working with one of my favorite comics to share a stage with, Detroit&apos;s Jef Brannan. If you&apos;ve never seen Jef on stage, he&apos;s what John Hiatt would look and sound like if Hiatt did standup comedy. Or, Hiatt is what Jef would sound like if he really wanted to be a musician....either description fits.
The tour started Thursday night in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, at the Prestonsburg Inn, formerly the Best Western, formerly the Holiday Inn. My day started out on a positive note; I had left the power cord to my sleep apnea breathing apparatus (CPAP if you&apos;re familiar) at the hotel in Matthews, North Carolina and they found it and next-day mailed it to me (I had contacted them and given them my credit card number to pay for postage). I got it just as I was leaving my house at 8 A.M. I was happy to have it (even though the power cord for my laptop was an exact match and I&apos;d been using it in the other cord&apos;s absence) until I found out that FedEx next day first delivery cost $64. I probably could have purchased five replacement cords for that much, but ultimately I&apos;m thankful that the hotel went to the trouble of getting me the cord as quickly as humanly possible, as it was for a medical device and they probably felt it was quite urgent. They could have told me to go pound rock salt, but they didn&apos;t. And really, it was my fault for packing my luggage in haste and forgetting the cord, so I&apos;ve learned a lesson about taking my time and being thorough.
The ride to Kentucky was just under ten hours, with rest stops and bathroom breaks. I ball parked the trip as being shorter, but left early just in case. After 20 years of doing comedy, I&apos;ve developed a &quot;Rule of the Road,&quot; and that rule is: On Every Road Trip, A Shoe Will Drop (something will go wrong) And If You Can Get Over That, Everything Else Will Be Fine. For this trip, the &quot;shoe&quot; was me forgetting to pack shaving cream....and that&apos;s not even a shoe at all, because most hotels have little travel size shaving creams that they&apos;ll give you in case you forgot yours. The hotel in Prestonsburg had the nice stuff, too...a two-ounce container of Gillette Foamy. Some hotels cheap out and give you the stuff in the little foil packet that you have to lather up and put on your face...it&apos;s a bunk product, the kind that you find in the dollar store when you&apos;re in there looking for a bargain and you hypnotize yourself into thinking that some piece of crap is worth a dollar because you don&apos;t want to come out of the store empty-handed.
So I got over my little shoe drop, and today, Jef and I went out in search of a place that would cash our paychecks. The hotel, under the previous ownership, banked locally and cashing the checks wasn&apos;t a problem. The new owners are banking out of a place in Lexington, Kentucky, read: nowhere near where we were. We got sent to Wal-Mart, who then refused to cash the checks because the checks were hand-written. Now, I&apos;m sure that this was to prevent taking a bum check that was a forgery, but all it did was shove us to a grocery store. We drove around for almost half an hour looking for the store we got sent to, but we found it (Food City) and they happily cashed our checks for a $5 fee (Wal-Mart would have charge $3). I gassed up at their pumps, happily paying $3.93 a gallon and noting that the gas prices locally had actually seemed to go down by about six cents a gallon since the day before.
We grabbed some Chinese buffet lunch and Jef, ever the class act, picked up the lunch tab. There are still some old-time road dogs out there that adhere to the custom of the headliner taking the feature out to lunch one day on the tour. I get the opportunity to close more frequently these days and I relish the opportunity to take the middle (or emcee) to lunch....I feel like I&apos;m passing some sort of torch, and that there&apos;s some nobility in that. We got into Charleston after a long delay due to construction on Interstate 64, I feel like I sat in slow-moving traffic for about an hour, and a two-hour trip turned into three just like that. The torture of being stuck in traffic is that there are limited things you can do to pass the time. I made a couple of business phone calls and booked some work, so the time wasn&apos;t a total loss, but even my big pack &apos;o CD&apos;s couldn&apos;t entertain me, so I turned to talk radio.
Now, talk radio does nothing but get my blood boiling, because I can&apos;t believe the things that some people think and feel about the world around us. Yesterday, there was a topic that was being talked about as I drove through Ohio and heard some of the local hosts discussing regarding two students who were also National Guard or Army reserve members, and they wanted to wear their dress uniforms to graduation, and the school didn&apos;t want them to do that, they wanted them to wear traditional gowns like everyone else, saying that uniforms would be a distraction.
Now, I&apos;m just a simple guy from Rochester, NY....Rochester&apos;s a town big enough that Hee Haw wouldn&apos;t give us a salute, but folks from the Big Apple scoff and say that we&apos;re a bunch of hicks. I wouldn&apos;t trade my hometown for most out there, and I feel that I&apos;ve done pretty well by being raised with a little common sense and enough access to book learning to form intelligent decisions about things.
The way I think about the issue is this; anytime the word &quot;military&quot; enters the discussion, people get a little emotional, and rightly so-we are in a war right now, and a lot of people feel very strongly about that war one way or the other. So when a kid says &quot;I want to wear my military uniform to graduation,&quot; no matter what side of the argument you land on, it&apos;s not about tradition, or freedom of speech, IT&apos;S ABOUT THE WAR. And I guess the educational institution, I gotta guess it&apos;s a college, doesn&apos;t want to validate the war by letting these students wear their dress uniforms.
The specific court ruling on this sort of thing specifies that a student does not relinquish their freedom of speech at the schoolhouse door. Now, I guess things are different if it&apos;s a public school versus a private institution that the two soldier-graduates are attending. If it&apos;s a public school, and you attend at the pleasure of the city, county or state, then I feel you should tow the line and dress like everyone else if that’s the rule as it is applied to everyone. But if it&apos;s a private school and you&apos;re paying your tuition, then you have rights that come with your receipt and wearing a dress uniform is your prerogative. Would two students in dress military garb detract from the graduation ceremony? Hell, no. I will say this; I wouldn&apos;t want to be the poor civilian student who had to cross the stage after one of the soldiers, because you&apos;re going to have to stand there and wait while a standing ovation occurs. Supporting the troops means clapping your hands and voicing approval loudly so everyone can see you doing it....people need validation all the time, particularly when their patriotism could be questioned. And if you stay in your seat while the soldier-student in his dress uniform crosses the stage, then the terrorists have won.
Seriously, has anyone mentioned a compromise in all of this? Our country was built on compromises, the ability to sit down and acknowledge each others&apos; differences of opinion and give a little to get a little bit of what we want. Maybe the soldiers could wear their uniforms, but go across the stage together either first or last, so that the bulk of the graduating class could conduct the traditional ceremony without interruption. Or maybe the soldiers could be sat down and convinced that this particular ceremony does not represent their service to their country but rather their individual achievement, and that they would be welcome to wear their dress uniforms under their graduation gowns? Either way, it sounds like emotions have been allowed to come between civil discourse and disagreement.
One of the topics of the last two days that has caught my attention is a report out of the Pentagon that last year, over 100 soldiers committed suicide. 75% of those soldiers were home from Iraq, 25% of them killed themselves while in country. All but four of the soldiers were men.
This is disturbing to me. I&apos;m deeply resentful of the United States&apos; mission in Iraq. I feel, as an observer who only gets his information from media sources, that Iraq is taking advantage of the United States and allowing our soldiers to do the heavy lifting. And all that heavy lifting is starting to take its toll. For a soldier to complete his tour of duty, come home, and then put a gun in his own mouth and pull the trigger, or hang himself, or take a bottle of sleeping pills with a big glass of whiskey and settle into a nice, warm tub of water, is morbid and distressing to me. If I&apos;m a parent and my son (or daughter) is serving in Iraq, and they die from an improved explosive device, or killed in a firefight, or whatever ghastly death war can bring a young person, I&apos;m devastated. But if my son or daughter comes home and takes their own life, and I know that there are a hundred others doing the same thing? Then I need to start asking questions, and question number one is &quot;What the fuck is going on over there?&quot; I was pissed off when I heard that our troops were digging through trash piles for scrap metal to up-armor their vehicles, and now this. Really, if we want to support our troops, maybe the only real way to support them is to get &apos;em the hell out of there, and pronto.
Fuck those yellow ribbons. I hate to see those ribbon magnets on cars and trucks driving around, because it represents to me the false, numbing patriotism that passes for real patriotism in our country today. A yellow ribbon never stopped a guy from getting blown up by a booby-trap, never stopped a bullet from catching him in the head, never stopped him from succumbing to despair so deep and bleak that the only escape was self-termination.
I&apos;d like to think that I was taught better, when I was a kid. I was a Cub Scout, and we learned things, like how to properly fold a flag, but more importantly, the sense of community and civic duty that being an American was all about. We were taught to be proud of our country and our freedoms, and to be charitable and kind, respectful and dignified. We saluted the flag and stood on ceremony, and we were active in our community, doing the work of being Americans and making a difference.
Those lessons never left me. A few years ago, I was heading back to my car after picking up a couple of fish-fry dinners for my family, and an old lady asked my help to cross a busy intersection. I gave her my arm without hesitation; I always learned to respect my elders. I&apos;m embarrassed to share this, because my little rant isn&apos;t about me, but some of the folks in their cars stopped at the intersection and clapped for me as I helped this woman to the other side of the street. But I didn&apos;t do it for that reason; I did it because it was the right thing to do. Our soldiers serve because it&apos;s the right thing to do. And it&apos;s certainly o.k. to applaud them; they definitely do more than help old ladies across the street. But yellow ribbons and squabbling over dress uniforms at a graduation honors no one, and worse than that, it deepens the rift that already splits our country in two.
The vibe here in West Virginia and Kentucky (very similar, the two states) is that of many rural communities and to a greater extent, the Southeast. The yellow ribbon is resplendent everywhere as feathers on a peacock, and to me, just as phony as a Jesus fish on your car.
Y’see, to me, it’s like this; if you’ve got Jesus in your heart, you don’t need to put a fish on your car. When I was a kid attending Catholic Church and going to CCD classes on Sunday, we sang songs that said “They will know we are Christians by our love.” They didn’t say anything about Jesus fish on the car. The Jesus fish is phony, and the Bible says as much; the scripture says “Don’t pray in the street like the Pharisees, do it in your closet” where it’s just between you and the Lord.
I feel patriotism is the same thing. I don’t need to see a flag pin on somebody’s lapel to know that they love our country, and I don’t need to see a yellow ribbon on a car to know that they support our troops. If you want to show me, don’t tell me….what you do will speak so loudly I won’t hear what you’re saying. One night on talk radio, the guest on the show was an officer of the U.S.O. and he took a call from a woman who wanted to knit mittens for the troops in Iraq. The U.S.O. office politely reminded the woman that Iraq was a desert and that mittens wouldn’t necessarily have been the most needed article of clothing. But that’s what I’m talking about; show me, don’t tell me. I’ve got buddies who have gone to Iraq to entertain the troops and bring a little laughter into their lives over there. THAT’s supporting the troops. I hear stories about kids doing CD and DVD drives to send stuff to the troops for them to listen to and watch on their down time. THAT’s supporting the troops. Jesus, maybe somebody could send one of these poor guys a letter, be a pen pal, let them vent about what’s bothering them? THAT would be supporting the troops. 
Or, you could just buy a yellow ribbon (made in China) and put it on your car next to your Jesus fish, 6,000 miles away from Iraq and support the troops that way.
But the fear for these ribbon-toting folks is that if they don’t sport the ribbon, they must not support the troops. And that would be akin to high treason. And didn’t the yellow ribbon start in support of the American hostages in Iran, back in the late 1970’s? The irony there is so thick, you could up-armor a Humvee with it.
Let me mention this, should anyone misinterpret what I’ve written. I want to be very, very clear. This nation was founded on dissent. Disagreement. Ideological differences. The whole shootin’ match was started because our founding fathers didn’t agree with the rule of Britain, and so they decided to start off on their own. And when they did, they wrote the Constitution. And in the Constitution, in the First Amendment, they guaranteed freedom of speech. The wanted, first and foremost, for all Americans to feel free to speak their minds, because dissent is healthy as a continuous test of government and policy, to guarantee that the will of the people steer the rudder and that self-government is assured. And yet disagreement in this country has become the magnet to allegations of everything from treason to the highest insult of all, “You don’t support our troops.” It is a weak argument to begin with, and unfounded. It is only a half-step above name-calling. And it is pitiable that it is used so frequently.
One of the reasons why this faulty logic is not only arrived at but perpetuated, particularly in the rural areas of our country and to a large part, the southeastern states, is that there is no dissenting viewpoint being represented. You cannot have an argument, and when I say argument, I don’t mean “fight,” I mean “discussion designed to accommodate contrary viewpoints in the effort to persuade or educate,” if only one side shows up.
And in these aforementioned areas of the United States, there’s only one side showing up.
150 years ago, the reasons for this were obvious; the South was largely agrarian, the North largely industrialized. And education was more accessible in the North, as the people were not slaves to the agricultural calendar as they were in the South. So education in the South was actually inculcation, with a great deal of religious instruction taking the place of analytical thought, scientific method or philosophical litmus tests of any kind.
Consider the arguments for and against abortion; if you completely eliminate the religious aspect of the argument, you have nothing left to argue against abortion being safe and legal. Religiosity has taken the place of clear and analytical thinking. I look at this way; if two water-heads couldn’t figure out a condom in the backseat of a car on prom night, do I really want them raising children? The answer is NO. But I don’t allow my religious views to encumber my ability to pragmatically analyze how I feel about public policy. I would never abort a child that I had a hand in conceiving, but I would never stop another couple from making the decision that suits their morals and ethics best. I would be denying them the same freedom that I enjoy, and that’s un-American.
Some of my closest friends have called me elitist in my thinking, but I have to disagree; I am the son of a blue-collar man, I attended public schools my whole life, and labored four years to earn a two-year degree. I think that my intelligence may be eclipsed by my laziness, or I might have achieved more, but basically what I’m trying to say is that I am intellectually no better than anyone else. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned at the knee of teachers who taught the masses and I had no better resources than anyone else. I’ve only taken the time to exploit those resources to my best advantage, and encourage everyone I’ve ever met or known to do the same. Ultimately, I fear that a new kind of civil war is due in this country, the kind of a war that doesn’t pit Americans against each other based on the geographical location of their home, but a war that pits Liberal against Conservative, intellectual versus emotional, pragmatic against dogmatic. And I don’t know how it will turn out because the intellectuals will have better strategies and planning, but the emotional folks will have more guns.
Bottom line, we need a national wake-up call, and we need it quick. America doesn’t have the luxury that the European nations have. Nations like France, Germany, Spain and others have the advantage of small geographical areas and condensed populations. It doesn’t take long to have a consensus and except for some fine points on implementation and policy, they can get things done quickly and at the pleasure of whole group. In our country, we’ve got deep emotional scarring over college football allegiances (Michigan vs. Ohio State, Alabama vs. Tennessee). Our country is big enough that it could be split five ways easy, our viewpoints are so diversified.
Thinking about this stuff is ripping me up on a daily basis, because as an American I yearn for our country to heal, and as a comic, I have to travel around the country, look at the pain and then try to extract humor from it. And we seem far from healing, as long as we squabble about uniforms and flag pins, yellow ribbons and patriotism.
God Bless America.

 Comedian Mike Dambra hurt in Car Accident 
Posted on 05/18/2008 at 11:14 PM
Comedian Mike Dambra was badly hurt in a car accident this morning around 7 AM, his rental car was hit head-on as he left the hotel in Rochester, Minnesota to return to Rochester, NY.
The other driver reportedly &quot;couldn&apos;t see from the glare of the sun&quot; and Mike&apos;s air bag deployed. Mike was admitted to the hospital in Rochester, Minnesota where he was x-rayed and diagnosed with two cracked ribs, a bruised sternum, and a broken bone in his right hand between the thumb and forefinger.
The rental car company provided Mike with another vehicle and he is in the process of driving home as he cannot fly; the cabin pressure would be more than his chest injuries could bear.
I expect Mike to be back in Rochester, NY by 1:00 A.M. Any news on his condition will be passed along as quickly as I can convey it.

 Goin&apos; Up The Country (Canned Heat) 
Posted on 05/17/2008 at 01:47 AM
Wow...Friday night just shot right past me. It was my first one off in a while. Sometimes I wonder how &quot;civilians&quot; (non-showbiz folk) do it every week, working their 9-to-5&apos;s and killing time on the weekend. At one point tonight, I thought about having a drink, but I ruled against it; all I have in the house is some gin (not my favorite) and nothing to mix it with. I&apos;m not a problem drinker, but I am given to binges, and that&apos;s not good considering my health profile.
This week was a quick one, tying up a lot of loose ends. Bruce, my webguy, helped me get my shit together and posted my first podcast on the website www.ralphtetta.com and for a first try, I&apos;m not completely happy with it, but I threw it together quickly to get it going, knowing that if I tarried at all it wasn&apos;t gonna get done. The next one should be better (I hope). At least I&apos;ve got the software figured out now.
I re-strung my guitar....I had picked up strings for it months ago, and they just sat there, mocking me. Finally, while Pam had a meeting and I was watching Harmony, I decided to get it done and over with, removing the old strings one at a time and running the new one through the harnesses, tuning and retuning each string with every change. Harmony was interested in what daddy was doing, and ever-conscious of a &quot;teaching moment,&quot; I started describing to her the parts of the guitar; tuning pegs, capstans, string tree, strings, headstock, neck, body, pickups, saddle and strap. I didn&apos;t bother with the volume and tone controls; she&apos;s only four and I didn&apos;t want to burden her with information beyond her grasp. Ha! I guess I have the same disease my wife does, challenging Harmony with info and tasks that should be well beyond her years. My favorite story is that Pam was doing flashcards with Harmony the week she came home from the hospital. Our few-days old daughter hadn&apos;t even fully focused her eyes, and Pam&apos;s trying to get her to absorb two plus two. I guess we both have the fear that at sixteen, Harmony won&apos;t be exceptional and it will be our fault, that we didn&apos;t try hard enough with her.
I continue to be obsessed with politics, in a good way, and the news that John Edwards endorsed Barack Obama made me happy. I seem to think the Obama presidency is inevitable, although I&apos;ve been wrong and disappointed before. I was so engrossed with the report on the radio of the election returns that I got a speeding ticket driving home from work the day Governor Mario Cuomo lost his seat to Republican George Pataki. I hated Pataki, and I will call him a miserable polack to my dying day. (Editor&apos;s Note: the term &quot;Miserable Polack&quot; was coined by my late father, Ralph Tetta, who despised Pataki even more than I, and he made the decision to move out of New York State based on Pataki&apos;s bumbling governorship. It has been pointed out to me that Pataki is, in fact, Hungarian, [and also seems to have some Italian in his maternal heritage, which makes me sad and ashamed] and I no more intended to discredit all people of Polish origin by my use of the denigrate &quot;Polock&quot; than I would intend to slur all Italians by the use of the word &quot;Wop.&quot; I intended to slur one individual as the worst that group had to offer. I am not sure of the slur for Hungarian, so I will just change my designation for the man to &quot;miserable asshole.&quot;)
I&apos;m almost finished with the book &quot;It&apos;s Getting Ugly Out There,&quot; the book by CNN&apos;s Jack Cafferty, who I watch almost every day when I&apos;m on the road. I like the fact that while Cafferty is left-leaning and critical of the Bush administration, he calls an ace an ace and a spade a spade and he doesn&apos;t let politicians on the left side of the aisle off easy when they fuck up. I do believe in fairness, and even my beliefs don&apos;t always run to the liberal all the time. Cafferty has a good common sense of the issues, and I enjoy seeing them in print; it allows me to go back and digest them at my leisure.
I&apos;m thinking about going out and looking at cars tomorrow. I&apos;ve been renting vehicles since our Corolla bit the dust, and that&apos;s been eating away at my bottom line. The upside is having a competent vehicle to get to my roadwork, the downside is the cost. It&apos;s bad enough that gas is approaching four bucks a gallon. I&apos;m almost thinking hybrid, depending on what&apos;s available out there. I don&apos;t know much about them, other than that you get a better miles per gallon rating, and that&apos;s fine with me. I&apos;m sure a salesman at a Toyota dealership or a Honda dealership will be happy to explain it to me.
Next week, I&apos;m heading to North Carolina and I&apos;ll be working with my buddy Mo Alexander again. Then it&apos;s off to Kentucky and West Virginia and then a week off. I&apos;m gearing up for this year&apos;s Florida tour, and it&apos;s only three weeks this year, but I like going down there...I can stay at my mom&apos;s place on the days off (quite the savings) as well as have some quality time with her and make sure she&apos;s doing all the things for her health that she ought to be doing. She&apos;s coming up to New York to see my brother&apos;s new baby daughter, Victoria Ann, so I&apos;ll actually be heading down to Florida as she&apos;s coming up, but she&apos;ll be back in Florida before I leave.
In the meantime, I have quite a few projects that I&apos;ve started working on, including a couple of books (almost written...yeah), a CD of sketch comedy (not even close), and a push towards some instructional/corporate/motivational speaking type engagements. The clubs are sexy and all that, but it&apos;s time to start making some money, or so my mortgage banker, accountant and in-laws have been saying as of late.
Peace out,
Ralph Tetta

 Time The Avenger (The Pretenders) 
Posted on 05/03/2008 at 10:41 AM
Good morning from the insular and provincial town of Greensboro, North Carolina. I&apos;ve been such a lazy bum about blogging lately, I think a lot of people might have assumed that I&apos;ve just given it up. Lately, there hasn&apos;t seemed to have been much to write about, and those few and far between incidents that have been noteworthy haven&apos;t been enough to send me to my computer.
It&apos;s been three weeks since my last blog, and among other noteworthy accomplishments, my webguy Bruce took me out and shot a video bio which now resides at my website (www.ralphtetta.com) and it&apos;s really good....I&apos;m impressed that he did such a good job with the limited source material I was able to provide. I visited my old school, Monroe Community College where I spent four years pursuing a two-year degree. The school has changed A LOT since I left there in 1991 and the improvements don&apos;t necessarily feel better....the student center, which was the home of the radio station, and a hive of activity during the day, is now split up, the student organization offices are pushed down nondescript hallways and the only reason to visit is if you were a member of said organizations....not exactly the best positioning for recruiting new members or promoting on-campus events.
I packaged my two old CD&apos;s into a box set and designed a new cover artwork for it, and a companion box artwork for my DVD. I like them a lot, and did them in a punk/DIY style, courtesy of the color copiers at Kinko&apos;s. So far, sales have been down, but I attribute that to the lagging economy and warmer weather that&apos;s setting in that characteristically kills the comedy club business.
I have some new audio software on my laptop now, again thanks to Bruce, and will start doing a podcast very soon. I&apos;ve been letting some ideas simmer and actually, Jeff Schneider from the Pittsburgh Funny Bone has been doing pieces on YouTube that are very similiar to what I&apos;ve been thinking about doing, going for the funny and making a point at the same time (search for Le Provocateur on YouTube, you&apos;ll find him). The battle of course is that there is only so much time in the day to spend with family, travel, exercise, eat healthy, and try to keep a full calendar to keep the wolves from the door. I&apos;m experiencing &quot;role strain&quot; (google it if you didn&apos;t take sociology) and at some point, some of the less important stuff is just going to have to go to the back burner if not in storage all together...the sad truth is that it will probably be vocational projects which will cause my family to suffer financially, but the alternative is letting my family go on without my full attention, and vice-versa, and at that point, what&apos;s the use? I can put my family in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and then never be there to enjoy it with them.
My newest vocational projects (glad you asked) are compiling my old road blogs into a book, with some after-the-fact commentary and some editing (how many sandwiches can you read about in one book?) to give the narrative some flow. I&apos;m not sure how marketable the thing is, but it&apos;s already written and it can only help my career from a promotional standpoint. I&apos;m in a different town every week anyway, so I might as well kill my daytime hours sitting at a card table in front of Border&apos;s while people walk by and pretend not to see me.
In addition, I have a plan to break open the college market, but I need to get across the angle that I&apos;m a good fit for the non-traditional college students, ie: older, returning students who would relate to me and my material. I think that my constant touring has created an act that is virtually bulletproof in front of any group, but the sad truth is that when you play in front of an entire group of college-aged students, they will reject you out of hand if you look old, and I do look old, if not completely, tragically unfashionable. I have a tendency to earn my bones with such audiences by going completely, out-and-out vulgar if not disgustingly filthy, which is o.k., because that&apos;s the humor that I enjoy, but I feel like I have so much more to offer...my new bio describes my act as &quot;improvisational,&quot; and that&apos;s a huge key to what I&apos;ve been doing on stage during this second act of my career, so I need to capitalize on it.
Oh yeah, I probably should mention that I celebrate 20 years doing comedy this month. It was May of 1988 when I first climbed on stage at Yuk Yuk&apos;s in Rochester, NY, on a Wednesday night, to do open mike. I&apos;m not totally sure what exact day it was, but I do know that it was a Wednesday and my life changed inexorably that day. I thought of doing something special this month to commemorate the occasion, but decided against it because it is only a milestone to me, and marks merely the passage of time rather than some sort of career goal. I&apos;m not a better comic for the time in the business, but some would rather assert that I&apos;m a poorer one, or as my tax preparer said to me this year, &quot;How come you&apos;re not doing better?&quot; My solace comes in my assertion that the longer it takes you to go up the showbiz ladder, the longer it takes you to come down.
My tax preparer is a great guy, and he invited me to Passover dinner this year...it was my first Seder, and I enjoyed the meal and the company. The funniest line of the night was from Mark, our host, when I asked if there was a song for the soup, he called from the kitchen &quot;MMMM MMMM Good, MMMM MMMM Good!&quot; It was completely quick and not lost on the largely middle-aged group that was assembled. My best line of the night was commenting on now knowing the rites of the Passover dinner was that I &quot;now know the Seder House Rules.&quot; Yeah, it&apos;s a stupid pun, but it got the response. Hey, if they&apos;re laughing, I&apos;m working.
Other news to mention is that our annual picnic is July 13th this year, and we&apos;re renting out a lodge, although not the normal one, and invitations will be going out soon with directions. It&apos;s particularly important this year, given the passings of Mike Glosek and Tiny Glover, and the illness of our brother Mike Irwin, that we come together at least once to see each other and celebrate our fraternity as comics. And my wife&apos;s friends will be there, too, so that it doesn&apos;t get to be a boring afternoon of &quot;shop talk.&quot;
Speaking of shop talk, I&apos;m going back to Las Vegas for the first time in a few years, courtesy of Summit Comedy. I&apos;ll be playing at a casino on Fremont Street for Labor Day weekend....good vacation weekend, should be a lot of tourists. I&apos;m looking forward to it. Also, I rebooked San Antonio for August, because I just don&apos;t sweat enough and I want to see what my body&apos;s tolerance for dehydration is. I also lined up a couple of headlining weekends in Tyson&apos;s Corners, Virginia, and Jackson, Tennessee, and while those might not sound too impressive, it feels good to me because it makes me think that the train is going in the right direction.
I&apos;m working with the very funny Mo Alexander this week in Greensboro, and it&apos;s Free Comic Book Day so we might venture out for said Free Comics. Other cool comics I&apos;ve worked with this last few weeks include Last Comic Standing&apos;s Rich Vos, Grand Rapids&apos; own Stu MacAlister, Buddy Flip (hey, we&apos;re already friends!), David Landau and Dave Logan....all gentlemen and scholars.....o.k., one was a cranky scholar, but I won&apos;t tell you which one.
Iron Man opened yesterday, and I am Iron Man (check my myspace profile at www.myspace.com/rabidralph for details) so I might check it out today.
Peace out, y&apos;all.

 We Gotta Get Out Of This Place (The Animals) 
Posted on 04/11/2008 at 04:50 PM
Good afternoon from sunny Livonia, Michigan, home of Joey&apos;s Comedy Club in the Kickers Complex, where I&apos;m working this week with my old friend, Steve Burr.
Steve is featuring this week and he got me the mc week, and normally I don&apos;t work at that level because I have a family to support and the bread just isn&apos;t very good at that level, but it&apos;s a club I haven&apos;t worked before and I wanted to get my foot in the door, and this was a good way to do it.
The upside is that Steve was able to get me in pretty easily, the downside is that I have to share a hotel room with him. When I arrived on Wednesday afternoon, he had divided the hotel room into his side and my side, my side being roughly the size of a saltine cracker, minus the salt. Honestly, I have my own bed and a little space to put my luggage, but I have to practically hang from the ceiling to get any space of my own. This jackass is relentless in taking over the room. I know he&apos;s featuring, but a little common courtesy wouldn&apos;t be out of the ordinary.
We&apos;ve done two shows so far, and Steve has been absolutely terrible. How he bamboozles some of these clubs into headlining him is completely beyond me. To say that his reception here in the Motor City has been chilly is quite the understatement; it&apos;s like saying that gasoline&apos;s been getting a little pricey lately. Thank God he&apos;s only doing 25 minutes, it&apos;s barely tolerable and I&apos;m going to have to try to distance myself as much as possible from this walking catastrophe. We&apos;ve got two more shows tonight and two tomorrow, and hopefully Steve can salvage some dignity before he completely capsizes my ability to get rebooked here. I&apos;ve never had another comic&apos;s recommendation go so horribly wrong.
The other blessing is that I get to leave Saturday night after the show and drive directly home to Rochester. It&apos;s only five hours away, and it will finally free me from the rancid stench that keeps emitting from Steve&apos;s asshole. This guy would fart in church on Sunday Christmas Day in front of the Pope&apos;s mother. And I think he lacks a complete digestive system, there&apos;s only the swallowing of food and subsequent rotting. Putrefaction could also be occurring in his bowels, I have no idea. There&apos;s a reason that he calls himself &quot;The Big Stink,&quot; and now I know why.
God, get me out of here.

 Afterimage (Rush) 
Posted on 04/08/2008 at 10:56 AM
Just decompressing from my week at Laugh Out Loud (LOL!) Comedy Club in Clayton, North Carolina, just a stone&apos;s throw southeast of Raleigh, NC. It was a weird week, fun and strange and joyful and painful all at the same time.
I rented a car, and got a beauty this time....a white 2008 Chevy Cobalt with leather seats (heated), satellite radio, OnStar, cruise control, the works. Brought my own GPS and I was one spoiled kid this week. Oh, and it has a sunroof, too....this vehicle is tight. I have it for one more week and I don&apos;t want to give it up.
I picked up the car on Wednesday night and was going to get motoring, but decided to try and get some sleep and leave early in the morning. I went to bed at midnight (or so) and set my alarm for 5 A.M., wound up waking up an hour and a half early and never got to sleep. I figured I better get going, and if I was going to make the 12-hour journey, I would just have to pound the caffeine and I could sleep later.
The drive itself was fine, D.C. melted away from me like never before, the city and it&apos;s outer loop always treating me like some bizarre flypaper for motorists. Once I got into Northern Virginia, it was off to the races. I won&apos;t bore you with the details of the drive, but it included seven cans of Diet Pepsi Max, two apples, and gasoline at no cheaper than $3.15 a gallon, which is bullshit.
I arrived at the Howard Johnson&apos;s in Smithfield, NC, and got a shower and ironed my show clothes. The room had an ironing board but no iron, luckily I carry one like I carry all my own things, never relying on any lodging to be fully sufficient for my needs. While I was ironing my shirt, Faye Woodroof, the headliner, called my room.
&quot;I know you don&apos;t know who this is&quot; she said.
But I did.
About fifteen years ago, my Grandmother and Grandfather, who lived in Florida, were heading west to go on a vacation in the New Orleans area. Their car broke down, and Faye, who is an older lady, saw them by the side of the road and stopped and offered to help. They had already called AAA, so Faye stayed with them until help arrived, which was kind...senior citizens broke down on the side of the road on Route 10 are very vulnerable and easy pickin&apos;s for bad people. While they waited, they had a conversation, and Faye explained that she was a traveling standup comedian, and I had been in the game for about five years at that point, and so my grandparents were happy to relate that they had a comedian in the family, and a great friendship sprung up from that chance meeting. Faye gave them a small postcard with her picture on it, and my grandparents happily forwarded it to me with the hopes that Faye could help me in the business in some way, and they stayed in touch and from what Faye tells me, they all met for dinner on at least one occasion.
So I told her that yes, I did know who she was and how happy I was that I finally got to meet her.
We had a great week. Some of the shows were rough, by only the definition that the club, though beautifully appointed and state-of-the-art in design, sound and lights, could only draw on rural folks from the Southeast, and by that I mean a somewhat unrefined bunch who are largely unfamiliar with the etiquette behind a live theatrical performance and whose &quot;inside voice&quot; is the one they use to order alcoholic beverages at tractor pulls and auto races.
My sister and her husband live in Garner, just 10 or 15 minutes up the road, and they came out to see me on Saturday at the early show, which happily was the best show of the week. While Friday was a knife-fight of a night, both early and late shows resplendent with hecklers, loud table-talkers and folks who were very much in the &quot;I-don&apos;t-get-it&quot; category, Saturday should have been a taping for my next live album.
On Sunday, the game plan was to do the 8 o&apos;clock show, get paid, pack the hell out of there and start driving home, only there were six open-micers to go on before me, and by the time I got off stage, it was so late that I just hung out at the club and tried to sell some merchandise (which I did, and thankfully so, to off-set the high gas prices this week). Some of the guys were really funny and I turned in a little bit of an experimental set, working some of my new political material with stuff that I knew already worked. It was easily the most fun show of the week, and I got to pal around with some of the guys after the show.
I hit the road about midnight and except for a one-hour nap in the parking lot of the Harrisburg Comedy Zone, I drove straight through and did the 750 miles in 11 hours. I listened to talk radio the whole way to keep myself awake, and thought about my friend Tiny.
Tiny Glover, whose real name was Kenneth (I called him a stylized version of Tiny, more like &quot;Tin-YAY&quot;) passed away on Saturday night. I got a call from Joe Fico, another Rochester comic, early Sunday morning, and the news really put me into a funk. Tiny was working out on a treadmill in the exercise room of a hotel in Illinois, where he was scheduled to do a show, and had a heart attack. By all reports, he was really starting to take care of himself, losing weight and feeling good, and now he&apos;s gone.
I knew Tiny since my early days doing standup comedy. He was in my improv troupe, The Inner Loop, for a short time, and I have photos of him with us, in one that particularly makes me choke up now, a picture of the four of us, set up as The Last Supper with Tiny as Jesus in the middle, Ray Salah holding a round wicker popcorn basket behind Tiny&apos;s head as a make-shift corona, a poor man&apos;s halo.
Tiny and I would talk on the phone for hours back then, both of us blind squirrels trying to find that comedy nut, talking about ideas on where we could perform, how we could make any money doing this, and of course, mild gossip on all the comedy players in Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse. We were immersed in it, and while we were never &quot;best friends,&quot; we were friends, contemporaries, on-again, off-again partners, and we constantly converged.
Tiny left Inner Loop and formed Comedy Noir, a group of black standups who performed as a troup, including himself, T.L. Johnson, Judith Johnson (no relation), and Dean Edwards, later of Saturday Night Live fame. Comedy Noir lasted as long as Tiny&apos;s tenure with Inner Loop, and I can&apos;t comment on the reasons it dissolved but it was quite possible that the members just had their own paths to forge. After a long Canadian comedy club tour with Mike Dambra, Tiny realized that the clubs were hard, unrewarding work, and he focused on colleges, capitalizing on the better money and crafting an act that was college friendly...he was always known as &quot;The Bill Cosby of Rochester,&quot; and we all knew him as the mayor. When I booked Tiny to play a club, he would walk into the room and while other comics would superstitiously hug the back of the room, hiding from the crowd &apos;lest they steal their mojo, Tiny would shake 50 hands and make 50 friends before joke one came tumbling out of his mouth.
When Ed Bebko and Rob Lederman, the owners of the Comix Cafe in Buffalo, made their move into the Rochester market, there was one man that they knew had to be involved, and that was Tiny Glover. Tiny had been playing schools non-stop for years, doing theatrical workshops, storytelling in his &quot;Grandpa Teddy&quot; character, and he had hundreds of school teachers, administrators and personnel who loved him and swore by him, and in the early days of Comix Cafe, Tiny brought the crowds in. I started managing in the club shortly after and introduced their telemarketing program, which took the onus off Tiny to be a shill and let him concentrate on doing what he did best....be Tiny. At one point, he came to me and expressed some concern that he was filling the club with folks who had seen his act many times before, and how was he to keep up with the demand for new material, and I told him &quot;They already love you....be yourself.&quot; This opened up his ability to work an audience, go up onstage naked (without material) and bring the organic funny that lived inside of him. He could do no wrong in that kingdom.
When he had enough of the club and it&apos;s weekly Friday-Saturday constraints, and miscellaneous tomfoolery, he announced to me that it was time to go, and we released him with no regrets. I could see him becoming disenchanted with the regular club grind, and especially after one night, in which a customer attempting to walk out on a check turned into a fracas between guests and an employee (the employee being a cook, and a friend of the waitress being stiffed, who came out of the kitchen brandishing a french knife, Tiny falling on the young man and wrestling the knife away from him so he could stop him from making a big mistake), I could see that Tiny had had enough.
Tiny returned to the club several times as a headlining performer, drawing his legions of friends and followers, and we always came together in a big bear-hug, and we even worked together one last time at a corporate event, doing corporate training sketches for a group of black small business owners. We talked about doing more of those type of shows, but it wasn&apos;t to be, Tiny with his demanding schedule and family and me with mine, but there was always the hope that we would come together again. I guess if you believe in a life beyond this one and the rewards that await the good, we will come together again, if I play my cards right.
Danny Liberto, a brother comic who knew Tiny from the very beginning of his career, put it best when he said &quot;Heaven has a mayor now.&quot; And I believe it does.
Tiny, Rest In Peace my friend, you&apos;re hugging angels now.
&quot;AFTERIMAGE&quot;
Words by Neil Peart, Music by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson
Suddenly ---
You were gone
From all the lives
You left your mark upon

I remember ---
How we talked and drank
Into the misty dawn
--- I hear the voices

We ran by the water
On the wet summer lawn
--- I see the foot prints
I remember ---

--- I feel the way you would
--- I feel the way you would

Tried to believe
But you know it&apos;s no good
This is something
That just can&apos;t be understood

I remember ---
The shouts of joy
Skiing fast through the woods
--- I hear the echoes

I learned your love for life
I feel the way that you would
--- I feel your presence
I remember ---

I feel the way you would
This just can&apos;t be understood...

 Big Bottom (Spinal Tap) 
Posted on 04/01/2008 at 08:25 AM
I haven&apos;t been blogging very much lately, as regular readers might figure out. It&apos;s been a combination of distraction and the desire to spend more time with my family. March was a month of close-to-home gigs, which I thought was great because if you read my last blog, weather was getting the best of me in February. March wasn&apos;t much better, even though the farthest away I drove was Philadelphia, which is only a six-hour drive at the worst of times.
March was a month of milestones, to be certain. It&apos;s hard to determine which ones ranked most important, and which ones were relegated to second or third, but among the very important ones were my daughter&apos;s 4th birthday, which I was home for this year (haven&apos;t really been good about being home for them in the last couple of years) and a better bill of health from my nephrologist.
Harmony turned 4 on March 11th and a couple of days later, Dr. Hix, my nephrologist, announced that after my battery of blood, urine and stool tests, that my kidney function had elevated to 60%. That&apos;s up from a previous 48% back in January. I suppose that a lot of the damage done to my kidneys is a result of the mild diabetes that I suffer, and I&apos;ve started taking steps (literally) to slow or reverse the symptoms. Among other things, I&apos;ve been watching my carbs and starches (so crucial), eating less meat and more vegetables, and integrating mild exercise into my regular schedule. I&apos;ve started mall-walking with my friend Ray, as we found out that the interior circumference of the Greece Ridge Mall is 1.5 miles, so we go and do three laps whenever we can. So far, we&apos;ve been getting out a couple of times a week; the original goal was three times a week, but it&apos;s so difficult to manage it around work and family obligations.
Walking the mall is definitely an interesting proposition from a people-watching perspective. There are the regular compliment of school-aged kids, who choose to demand that the world notice them through the fanatical display of hardware either in their clothing or embedded in their face. Who wears a bullet-belt to the mall? And why would you wear one with a cloak? Those two things are completely anachronistic....if you get attacked by Orcs, there are plenty of garden implements at Sears, and I&apos;m sure they wouldn&apos;t mind if you borrowed a 15-pound sledge or a pair of garden shears in the middle of such a crisis.
One day, we were walking past a shoe store and a woman coming the other way slipped and went down to a knee. She slid through a puddle of liquid that looked like a spilled beverage, only there wasn&apos;t a cup anywhere to be seen.....there was a trail, though, that went from a puddle over to a spot directly under a bench where an elderly woman was sitting. I&apos;m not sure but I think it was urine. And slipping and falling isn&apos;t injury enough without having the insult of hydroplaning through someone&apos;s piss. &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; my ass....get some adult diapers, wouldja? Unless this was the magical, sword-from-the-stone Excalibur moment when this woman realized that she might be incontinent for the first time in her life, she should have been equipped with some precautions.
I&apos;m fat...considered &quot;morbidly obese&quot; by my medical records (Dr. Hix, don&apos;t leave me alone in an examination room with my big ol&apos; file to look at), but I feel I carry it well. I&apos;m 6&apos; 3&quot;, and that allows me to hide a lot of sins. Plus, I dress in clothing baggy enough to parachute with...that definitely helps. But during our excursions to the mall, Ray and I have twice observed individuals, both of them female, who are in dire need of some sort of surgery. They were both walking, God love them, but they had derrieres that were so large it was like some episode of &quot;Punked,&quot; like the scam was to drop a miserably-formed individual in front of an unsuspecting observer to see their reaction. One woman was black, and there&apos;s nothing wrong with a ba-donk-a-donk...but this woman looked like her ass was in a car wreck and the air bag went off, and she just decided to put some jeans on over the whole thing. People like that are fun because you can start observing them from a distance and making your smart-alecky comments before they can hear you. Another specimen was a really large woman who was walking with a relatively average-sized man, and again, God bless her because she was walking, because she could have just as easily grabbed one of those mall-issue scooters to get around and no one would have begrudged her. So we&apos;re walking behind this couple and I&apos;m thinking that sooner or later, we&apos;re going to have to make our way around them because she&apos;s not moving very fast, and then as we catch up to them, they turn into the Chinese Buffet....not a big surprise, and not a moment too soon. They were still in there when we passed on our second and third laps....I guess they wanted to get their money&apos;s worth.
I got booked to do my first-ever retirement home this year, and I did the gig last Wednesday. I was dreading the show, to be honest, because it was another one of those &quot;gotta be clean&quot; events, and when you&apos;re talking about folks in their 80&apos;s, I really don&apos;t know where the line is. I got around it by doing an hour clean, with very little filler if you don&apos;t mind me bragging, and I found out three very important things apply when you&apos;re doing a gig of this type;
1. Don&apos;t be afraid to use a book joke. They like them, and even if they heard it before, it&apos;s fairly unlikely they&apos;ll remember it.
2. Don&apos;t talk too fast. Many of the folks might have some hearing loss and you don&apos;t want to jumble a bunch of words in their ears that are difficult to decode. Plus, you don&apos;t have to do so much material.
3. Just because they&apos;re not laughing doesn&apos;t mean they aren&apos;t enjoying themselves. These folks have to take a nap after dinner, a nap after a bowel movement, they aren&apos;t going to waste a lot of precious lung energy laughing at your little monkey show.
The folks who stayed awake really enjoyed the show and I got a lot of nice comments afterward, and I got the feeling that they didn&apos;t get a lot of visitors and were just happy to have the company. Well, I got a good feeling doing the show and it satisfied that tree-huggin&apos; liberal side of me that always wants to do good and help people. The fact that I was making a little money on a Wednesday night didn&apos;t hurt, either....hey, I&apos;ve got a family to support.
Speaking of family, Harmony had her first ever school assembly last Friday and aside from me having to dog-leg it back from Philadelphia to see said assembly, the six-hour drive turned into eight because of inclement weather, which has affected me in three out of the five weekends this month. I was getting slush-strafed all the way up route 81 and across route 90, and one double-trailer actually flooded my windshield for almost a full ten seconds, and I definitely thought I was going right into a guard rail. The good news is that I lived and got to see my daughter sing &quot;The World Is A Rainbow&quot; with the other pre-schoolers and Kindergartners and I videotaped it with Ray&apos;s camera and then afterward I cried a little bit because I was so happy and I only had about three hours of sleep and my defenses were down.
Other March highlights include an appearance at Rob&apos;s Comedy Playhouse, a new club in Buffalo, NY run by 97 Rock&apos;s Rob Lederman, a funny comic and my former employer at the Comix Cafe (Rochester). Danny Pordum and Jeff Kuz, two funny Buffalo comics came out, Jeff doing a set and working with Rob&apos;s improv group after my set and Danny just to hang out and support. Another Danny, Danny Liberto and I worked his room in Corning, NY at the Raddison, and I daresay I hadn&apos;t had as much fun at a gig in quite a long time. I filled the feature role and I worked with Blane Kelly after not having seen him for a few years and we had a good time catching up. Steve &quot;The Nuclear Guy&quot; Natarelli and Phil Sherman worked with me at a joint called Capizzo&apos;s in Ontario, NY and we had a good time entertaining the folks out in the woods. An older guy tending bar there recognized my name, and come to find out he used to work with my father years ago. It was sort of a bummer having to tell him that Dad passed away, and it was a year to the day, too. And of course, there was a show early in the month in Buffalo, a fundraiser for the Kathleen Mary House, a charitable concern to benefit women and children who had been victimized by domestic violence. The gig included a drive to Buffalo at 5 o&apos;clock in the morning the day before to appear on the Channel 2 morning program for approximately 30 seconds. Still, a big thank-you to Chesley McNeil for having me and warning me about the giant storm that was coming that doubled my drive back to Buffalo and made me curse the elements. Last but not least, I was able to make a return appearance at the Funny Farm in Gloversville, NY, where I warmed it up in front of eight customers, five comics, and the waitress&apos; boyfriend.
And Philadelphia can kiss my ass! My GPS found the hotel and the gig just fine, but trying to park in Philly is ridiculous. They don&apos;t have any spots! There was a big giant historical building across the street from the Urban Saloon which just happened to be Eastern State Prison, and for my money, they should have torn the whole damn thing down, made a parking lot, and put a little plaque in the corner letting folks know what used to be there. Just my opinion, of course.
I did it all this month, corporate events, fire halls, hillbilly hell-holes, traditional comedy clubs, hotel gigs, and I worked every position from feature to headliner to one-man show. I&apos;m looking forward to a more traditional April, which includes three weeks of work at rooms I&apos;ve never played before, and a return to Dr. Grins in Grand Rapids, a club I&apos;ve played numerous times (and appearing with Last Comic Standing&apos;s Rich Vos).
Happy April Fools Day! I have no prank for you, because you don&apos;t deserve such mistreatment, and everything I have chronicled here is true.

Ode to Comedy Soapbox;
And the bloggers one and all-
I&apos;d say nice things about most of you,
but I just want a George Carlin poster to cover up the cracks in my wall which might be easily plastered, but my landlord doesn&apos;t let me do any improvements without prior written consent, and it just makes the place look terrible to leave it like that. I used to have a &quot;New York City&quot; poster in that spot, but after the 9/11 disaster, it didn&apos;t seem tasteful to leave it up.

 Headlights On A Dark Road (Snow Patrol) 
Posted on 02/23/2008 at 05:47 AM
Good morning, sports fans and welcome to another edition of the Wide World of Ralph. Today&apos;s sports are of the winter variety, and they include slipping, sliding, hurdling over snow banks and driving really, really slow on icy roads.
The tour began innocently enough on January 30th, when I left my home in Rochester to pick up my rental car which I would be piloting around the midwest for three weeks. I booked through Hotwire, and they connected me with Avis who rented me a banana-yellow, piece of shit Chevy Cobalt. A 2008 Chevy Cobalt. With only 27,000 miles on it. Pay attention to that point, this comes into play later.
Instead of saying, &quot;Hells, NO!&quot; I hopped in, started her up, and decided, well, this is what I would call a &quot;pull-me-over-mobile,&quot; but I&apos;ll just watch my P&apos;s and Q&apos;s and not drive fast, and I should be O.K. I got it home, packed my luggage, kissed my wife and daughter and away I went.
I ran a few errands before making my way west to Buffalo, NY, the next major city along the New York State Thruway. Before I even got on, my wife called me to inform me that the Thruway was closed from Rochester to the Pennsylvania border. Just as I was approaching the tolls in Leroy, I was greeted by a half mile of trucks stopped in their tracks to affirm that point. I got off the last exit of the 490 and trusted my handy TomTom GPS navigation system to re-route me. Long story short, I took routes 5&amp;20, the &quot;Southern Tier Expressway&quot; and the trip to Buffalo that is normally an hour took 2 1/2 hours. Then I was on my way.
I drove through the night into Ohio, and grabbed a hotel room for the night. I stayed in a Motel 6 in the town of Englewood, just outside of Dayton, Ohio, and found it to be to my liking. The weather was cold and windy, but no snow. I figured I was out of the woods.
The next day, I drove the rest of the way to St. Peters, Missouri, home of the Comedy Forum, and was greeted by a snowstorm that not only slowed traffic to a ridiculous pace, but canceled our show. I was working with Quevaughn Bryant, and old friend from back when he was located in Maryland. I&apos;d lost touch with him since he moved to California, and we had a good weekend. There were a lot of good times, but the best memory is of us going into a Chinese Buffet, and as the waitress was taking our drink order, we were doing stretching exercises getting ready to go up to the steam tables. Q&apos;s a big boy, and I&apos;m no slouch either.
So with one show canceled, I looked forward to the rest of the weekend...and every show had exactly 30 people at it except for the Saturday early show, which was jammed. And that was when disaster struck. Apparently, I offended a few trailer-park dwellers with my gratuitous use of the English language, or perhaps I told them (after they heckled me) that they smelled bad, were inbred and that no one in the room liked them. No matter, they were hustled out of the room just a minute or two before my closer and as the good folk of St. Peters, Missouri, turned into the Roman Coliseum (&quot;Throw &apos;em out! Off with their heads!&quot;), I decided to be magnanimous and shout the crowd down. &quot;No!&quot; I yelled. &quot;We&apos;re better than that! These people are ridiculous and they know it, and I refuse to come down to their level!&quot; Resident comic/promotions guy Al Canal was at the ready to give them the ol&apos; elbows &apos;n&apos; knuckles, but it wasn&apos;t going to come to that. At one point, earlier in the set, after I had humiliated Jed Clampett&apos;s less-monied nephew, he stood up and was looking as though he was going to charge the stage, but one of his table mates thought better of that idea and coaxed &apos;n&apos; calmed him enough to get him seated again. Most of the bluster came from a fat woman seated almost at the aisle; she looked like the type of person who parks in the handicapped spots at Wal-Mart and doesn&apos;t have the proper sticker to do so, but then you see her and can&apos;t dispute her the privilege. Circus fat. &quot;Pay a blue ticket to see her&quot; fat. And not that being fat is in and of itself a crime; after all, even I could lose a few pounds. But she was drunk and disorderly and heckling with the sort of heckle that doesn&apos;t deserve retort. &quot;I don&apos;t like these jokes.&quot; She would say. &quot;Are they too hard?&quot; I responded. &quot;We check I.D.&apos;s here, but not I.Q.&apos;s, and I guess that&apos;s a problem.&quot; Then a crack about the trailer park, and I finished with a comment about her inability to properly wash herself. Hey, she started it. So, O.K., bottom line, two police cars. They got trucked off, and I got a busload of new friends who can&apos;t wait to see me next time I come back. And that bothers me, because the material was killing, but I can&apos;t help but believe that they just wanted to see me grab some idiot&apos;s ankle in my jaw, drag &apos;em to the bottom, and roll &apos;em around until the bubbles stopped. I can do that fine, but that&apos;s no way to build a reputation.
On Super Bowl Sunday, Q and I hung around, and I got him to the train station in the afternoon. I had all day to kill, and I was off until Wednesday night. I had received word earlier in the week that I was being sent important papers to sign pertaining to my late father&apos;s estate, so I couldn&apos;t leave St. Louis until they were received, signed, and shipped back to Florida. The UPS delivery was slated for Tuesday morning, so I stayed at the Days Inn, watched the Super Bowl (yeah, Giants [see earlier blog], boo Patriots) and killed off Monday seeing the sights, which included a comic book store and a thrift store.
Tuesday morning, I received my documents, located a bank with which I do business (I won&apos;t tell you which one it is, but it is a Bank and they have branches all across America), got my documents notarized, and then after a one-hour quest, got them witnessed (no one would witness my signature....everyone mistakenly thought that there would be some liability if they signed their name....it&apos;s horrible how skeptical everyone has gotten these days). Then I was on my way to La Crosse, Wisconsin.
Well, the hour delay didn&apos;t do a damn thing for me, and hanging around in St. Peters the extra two days proved fatal for my Wednesday night gig. I drove all day Tuesday, all the way to Rockford, Illinois, and bunked down at a Motel 6 when the roads got too crappy to navigate. I hunkered down and got some rest, figuring everything would be plowed and cleared the next morning. Except they weren&apos;t. The snow was still coming down, and the roads had been plowed, but the snow was coming fast enough that it didn&apos;t matter. I followed some traffic along the route 90 into Wisconsin, getting as far as the route 51 North exit of the 90, about two hours from La Crosse and just south of Madison. Traffic had come to a total standstill. I hadn&apos;t eaten, had no water in the car, half a pack of gum, and was two hours away from my gig.
I sat for two hours before I got completely frustrated. I followed some cars along the left lane/shoulder of the highway, hoping to get off somewhere, and all it led to was sitting in another line of cars. Some cars were using the emergency U-turn to escape to the southbound lane, but it was up an incline and the ramp wasn&apos;t plowed, so it was a gamble as to whether or not I was going to make it. After another few minutes, I got angry, turned the wheel towards the incline, and gunned it.
I made it half way.
Putting her in reverse, I made it back down the slope, careful not to run into anyone foolish enough to follow my banana-yellow toaster oven of a car up the incline, and floored it. I got traction, through God&apos;s grace, angels, the redemption of mankind through the blood of Jesus Christ, my renunciation of pork, or some other benediction, but I made it, praise God I made it.
I got off the exit at 52 North, and headed up the highway. I was going to take shit roads to La Crosse, by God, and I was going to MAKE THAT GIG.
Only, I didn&apos;t.
Route 52 goes through a little town called Stoughton, Wisconsin. It&apos;s a town so small, Hee-Haw wouldn&apos;t give them a Sah-lute (if you don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about, Google it....Jesus, I&apos;m not going to spoon-feed you all of this stuff). I stopped at a gas station, fueled up, and was basically told &quot;pick a hotel, because you ain&apos;t gonna make it any farther&quot; and that was the truth. Snow was coming down, blowing everywhere and basically visibility was just past your nose and that was it. I headed through town, hoping that it was all just small town piss-pottery, but they were right...I would go ten feet and the road would disappear. I bee-lined toward where they said a Comfort Inn was (the only &quot;big&quot; chain in town) and saw a poor girl, who I considered to be under-dressed for the weather, trying to push her car out of a snowbank. I hung a U-turn and after about an hour of trying to rock it out, a couple of other guys stopped and we got her out of the snow. I headed to the hotel after her generous offer to lead me there, but I cautioned her not to drive her car, as a guard on the bottom of the vehicle had become partially undone and was now dragging on the ground and acting as a de facto snow plow and she really needed to get a tow truck. Her husband was on his way with help, so I just programmed the GPS to find the hotel and headed on over.
On the way, I called the booker and explained the situation, and thankfully, they were able to deploy someone and the show went on, but I can&apos;t imagine where they came from because every road in Wisconsin was shut down due to the weather. I was pissed because this was not only another show canceled (I had one on the Sunday that fell out, but I knew about that back in December), but another opportunity to dig into my bleeding leather wallet and shell out for another hotel room.
The hotel already had quite a few cars in the parking lot, and they must have been in there a while, because the two entrances to the lot were completely snowbound. Again, I tested the limits of the Cobalt and got in despite the drift. The young man who was working was more than happy to sell me a room for $80 (about twice what I like to spend on a room, to be honest), but it was a Jacuzzi room so it did take some of the sting out of the situation. I was starving, and everything was closed due to the weather. Pizza places weren&apos;t delivering, Culver&apos;s was closed, even Taco John&apos;s had boarded up the kitchen. I didn&apos;t want to venture down to the corner gas station and try to make a meal out of that convenience store garbage, and just as I was about to give up hope, another hotel guest mentioned that there was a Chinese restaurant in the strip plaza right next door to the hotel, and that he and his family were going over there.
In the true spirit of cut-throatery, I ran to my room, put on my coat and gloves and headed towards the restaurant. There were snow drifts from previous plowing efforts that literally ran almost to my hip, but I punched my way through and found a middle-aged Chinese man sitting on a bucket, waiting to cook some food for a fat, snow-bound, unemployed round-eye bastard from Rochester, New York. Lunch and dinner that day were shrimp and snow peas, garlic tofu and hot &apos;n&apos; sour soup. On the way back to the hotel, I ran into hotel-guest guy and his wife and two children, who were both younger than ten, and told them to follow my tracks, I had done the heavy lifting of cutting a path for them.
The next day, I watched morning news reports showing National Guardsmen traveling up and down the 90, where I was trapped, brining stranded motorists food, water and medicine. Thankfully, I was not among them, instead, I was soaking in a Jacuzzi and eating Chinese food while I watched the Colbert Report and chuckled over the dwindling prospects of Presidential contender Mike Huckabee (who I call the Hucka-brother and actually like because he plays the bass guitar, which I also do). I took the late checkout ($80 my ass) and made my way to Stevens Point, Wisconsin, again, two hours away, and it was like night and day from my previous day&apos;s experience. The roads were clear, plowed, and on the radio, local politicians decried the state&apos;s poor handling of the weather crisis and that they shouldn&apos;t have allowed so many motorists (thousands by some estimates) to become stranded. Here, here, I say.
The gig went well and I was reunited with old buddy Jeff Bergs from Minnesota, and we finished the weekend at Goonie&apos;s in Rochester, Minnesota. Coincidentally, the last time we worked together was in Rochester, New York...so officially Jeff and I have worked together in both Rochesters (the big, famous ones) in each other&apos;s home state. I can&apos;t say that about any other comic, and I thought it was worth noting.
On Saturday in Rochester, Minnesota, it was 20 degrees below zero with a forty-below wind chill. If you live in the north, you know that a wind chill is the negative effect that wind has on already chilly temperatures, and the subsequent effect on human beings. If you live in the south or elsewhere, suffice it to say IT&apos;S FUCKING COLD!!!! STAY INSIDE! NO, YOU CAN&apos;T HAVE A PIZZA DELIVERED, YOU STUPID HILLBILLY! CARS DON&apos;T START! MATCHES DON&apos;T LIGHT! IT&apos;S FUCKING COOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLDDDDDDD!
Here are some interesting scientific facts. Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. People &quot;freeze&quot; at about 10 degrees. At 40 degrees below zero, Antifreeze freezes. Capish?
I had great shows at Goonies, and was spared some of the rigors of the walk from the hotel to the club via the indoor skyway. On the way home, after midnight, it was outside in the elements. I had my big leather coat, my gloves, but no hat or scarf. The walk was three blocks up and two blocks over, and by block number three, my face was stiff and tight and begging for mercy. I actually ducked into a doorway, as if that would do any good. Inside the hotel lobby, the blood pounded in my ears as warmth rushed back to my head. &quot;Now I know now Walt Disney feels&quot; I thought to myself. Goonie&apos;s is a great club and nice people work there and the food is good, and what else could you ask for, except maybe weather that human beings can survive in.
On Sunday, I headed south after dragging my feet at the hotel. The readout on the dashboard of the Cobalt was indicating that the temperature outside was -5 degrees. I longed for the balmy release that plain old &quot;zero&quot; would bring. I urged my banana-yellow steed into the Minnesota winter, heading south to Chicago and an eventual air temperature of 10 degrees. At 10 degrees, you stop cursing the Lord, but you are still not comfortable. Chicago was a breeze, and I steered north into Michigan, coming up alongside of the eastern coast of the lake of the same name, and that&apos;s when the snow started coming down. The roads went from frozen to frozen with snow on top...a frosty dessert treat called &quot;trip to the body shop.&quot;
I started looking for hotels, but at the first exit, there were three and they were all sold out. I made it to Kalamazoo, and there was a Motel 6, and not only did they keep the light on for me, but they offered me a rate so attractive that I stayed for two days. The last leg of my trip was Summit Comedy&apos;s casino tour of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and I was going to be working with another colleague from the past, Dave Nickerson. Dave had contacted me earlier about car-pooling on the trip and was flying into Detroit Tuesday night. As (bad) luck would have it, that&apos;s also when a snow storm was flying into Detroit. It took me seven hours to go from Kalamazoo to the county airport in Detroit, never you mind that I accidentally went to the City airport first, not realizing that a burg as big as Detroit would have two airports. I&apos;m a small-town boy from Rochester, and if you don&apos;t like it, you can go piss in the snow. Dave&apos;s arrival was delayed perfectly, and I pulled up just as he was getting his luggage from baggage claim. We headed off into the snowy night, plodding up route 75 and arriving in St. Ignace, just over the Mackinac bridge, around 2:30 in the morning. When I tell you that I slept the sleep of the damned, I&apos;m not just warming my tootsies by hellfire, my friends. I was OUT. Not only did I not hear housekeeping knock on my door, but when they changed my bed linen, they also changed me. For real, I woke up wearing fresh underwear and my butt had powder on it. Those casino maids are *good.* I guess driving all day on white-knuckle roads will do that to you.
As a sidebar, please let me offer this as a public service announcement. When you&apos;re driving on icy roads DON&apos;T HIT YOUR FUCKING BRAKES. THERE&apos;S NO REASON TO DO THAT, AND CERTAINLY NO VALUE IN IT. ALL YOU&apos;RE GOING TO DO IS MAKE OTHER PEOPLE HIT THEIR BRAKES, AND THAT&apos;S WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO SKID OFF THE ROAD. If you&apos;re scared, take your foot off the gas and try to steer around whatever it is that is making you scared. But don&apos;t hit your brakes. You dumb fuck, you.
The show in St. Ignace was a sorry after-thought. My set was interrupted by casino security who decided to &quot;card&quot; the entire front table all during my show. One by one, the youngsters got escorted out, and the attention being paid me was waning, waning, gone. &quot;Get the money&quot; I thought to myself, and sat quietly at the bar munching snack mix while Dave did his thing.
The trip to Sault Ste. Marie the next day was another uneventful day, with roads properly plowed and salted. The show was another denouement, a young, drunken group filled with part-time comedians, hecklers, substance abusers and parental disappointments. I was so glad to have the next day off to decompress, and home was only three days away.
Friday morning, the plan was to take Dave to Toledo where he would chill with family and then I would head back north to Sterling, Michigan, home of MJ&apos;s and the last date of my tour. Except for one thing....my banana-yellow Chevy Cobalt, pride of the Avis fleet, had decided it didn&apos;t want to cart me and my luggage around anymore. About half a block out of the casino parking lot, a dashboard indicator mentioned something about engine power being reduced, and that was just before the car stalled out. I got it started again, but with the same asthmatic hum, and the same dashboard indicator. I called Avis right away, after half driving, half pushing the yellow bastard back into the casino parking lot.
Come to find out, even though there was an office in Sault Ste. Marie, they weren&apos;t part of the &quot;corporate&quot; structure (a franchise store, I guess) with no obligations to honor my insurance ($9 a day, bumper to bumper) and a car had to be delivered to me from Traverse City, about three hours away.
Well, Dave and I didn&apos;t have anything to do, and we were trapped in the casino, so we went back to the restaurant where they had comped our meal the day before and we charmed our way into another comped lunch. Considering the bad luck I was having, I deserved a &quot;win&quot; and a free lunch was just what the doctor ordered. At four-thirty, exactly when we were expecting our new car, a man with a flatbed truck showed up with a white, 4-door, 2008 Chevy Cobalt. We transferred our luggage from the banana into the new recruit, and headed to Canada. Why? To try and fill a prescription for some non-narcotic pharmaceutical that Dave needed. We went to one pharmacy and got turned away because the prescription got written by an American doctor. They needed to see a Canadian prescription. It was after 5 and we figured we weren&apos;t going to be able to make that happen, so we bailed, and went back over the bridge into the United States, and told the border guard that we were supposed to meet some girls for dinner and they ditched on us. It was good for a laugh and the guy let us back into our home country, so who&apos;s the victim, I say?
Friday night, we made it to Toledo, got a night&apos;s sleep at the Knight&apos;s Inn (an old haunt of mine from back when I was on the George Carlin tour) and Saturday morning I dropped Dave off at his folks and met my good friend Steve Burr for lunch. After an exchange of pleasantries (read: we talked about people and laughed), I headed north to Standish, Michigan, home of the Standish Inn. I checked in, got a good nap, and then went to the show at MJ&apos;s. I worked with another old friend, Manny Shields, and we had a great show, I sold a good amount of merchandise, and then they told me that there was bad snow coming.
Well, that&apos;s all I had to hear. I hot-footed it back to the Standish, packed up and got the hell out of dodge. At the Canadian border at Port Huron, the Francophone border guard asked me what my business was in Michigan. I told her I was a comedian and she replied, &quot;Am I supposed to know you?&quot;
Now, on the surface, I know that sounds snotty, but that&apos;s not how she meant it. What she was trying to get across was that she didn&apos;t know if I was &quot;famous&quot; as she didn&apos;t &quot;get&quot; many American comedians. She confessed that Larry The Cable Guy escaped her the most. I assured her that a lot of Americans didn&apos;t get him, either. She bid me adieu and sent me on my way. I drove all night (thank you, sugar-free Red Bull) and rolled into my driveway around 8 in the morning. It has taken me a whole week to get up the energy to recount this three week tour from hell (I still don&apos;t know if Michigan got that Sunday morning snowstorm or not) and the only reason I&apos;m doing it now is that I&apos;m in Reading, Pennsylvania and my show got canceled tonight because of the snow.
And I thought Summer comedy sucked.

 Running Down A Dream (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) 
Posted on 02/04/2008 at 04:21 AM
Some late-night thoughts about Super Bowl 42...
First off, I&apos;m a Buffalo Bills fan. I have no great love for either the Patriots or Giants, as a matter of fact, I hate &apos;em both. The Giants stole the Bills&apos; Super Bowl thunder back in 1990, and I&apos;ve never forgiven them. Still, I had to root for them tonight over those fucking Patriots.
If New York had lost the game tonight, no one would have been surprised. They&apos;ve been playing over their heads all through the playoffs, knocking off teams like Dallas and Green Bay like they were nothing, and even giving Tampa Bay the elbows &apos;n knuckles in their own stadium. If New York had lost and the Patriots had won, it would have shut up those old codgers left over from the Miami Dolphins 1972 team, a team that went undefeated on the backs of a soft schedule and frankly, I never regarded with anything but indifference. I would have taken cold comfort in that loss, *if* it happened.
The Patriots didn&apos;t win, though, and it tainted their year. The undefeated regular season was won on a very Dolphinesque soft schedule with a few challenges thrown in, even from these self-same New York Giants who played their hearts out trying to win that regular-season finale. But if they *had* won, the season still would have been tainted by the so-called &quot;spygate,&quot; the taping of New York Jets coaches&apos; defensive signals during the first game of the season. The NFL destroyed the tapes and fined coach Bill Bellichik and the Patriots a bunch of money and a first-round draft pick.
I will not go into whether or not I feel that punishment was just or unjust, enough or too lenient, because it is not my job to decide those things. It is the commissioner of football&apos;s job. But when we speak about judgement, I believe that there is only one judgement that counts, and that&apos;s the judgement of God.
The Bible says &quot;Your sin will find you out.&quot; It&apos;s in the book of Numbers, chapter 32, verse 23, and basically, it means that you can sin against the Lord or your fellow man, and hope that you are never revealed as being the committer of dastardly acts, but the Lord is watching and you will be punished accordingly.
I find it fitting and a testimony to my faith that the Patriots didn&apos;t win the game tonight. They were blessed with victory after victory, except for the game that meant the most. And their sin has found them out. They will all get the loser&apos;s share of the money, but they also will suffer for a year knowing that they were on the brink of something amazing, unprecedented and wonderful, and they lost it all. Even coach Bellichik, who looked particularly hobo-like in his cutoff hoodie sweatshirt, walked off the field before the game was complete. He showed himself to be what he is; a small man, an unsportsmanlike man, a man to whom winning is everything and fair competition is held in little regard.
I am a Liberal and Liberals are often chastised for the way we conduct ourselves. Liberals are the sort of folks who give kids medals for participating in sports, even if they didn&apos;t win, to bolster their self-esteem. And I&apos;m totally o.k. with that approach. Winning shouldn&apos;t mean crushing the loser of the contest. You won, you don&apos;t need to run up the score or humiliate anyone. That shows a disdain for your fellow man, a lack of respect, and it&apos;s base and degrading. I guess that Liberals generally don&apos;t have the killer instinct, if the last 30 years of Presidential politics mean anything. We try to play fair, even in the midst of dirty tricks that are usually quite effective (see Karl Rove and pretty much everything he&apos;s ever done). But can anyone with any moral instinct conduct themselves otherwise? I really don&apos;t think so.
I&apos;ll continue to conduct myself with the core principles of a fair fight, an even contest and being gracious in both victory and defeat, and I&apos;ll raise my daughter to think the same way. And if I never win, never rise to the summit of achievment because I rely only on my talent and not on dirty tricks, short cuts, favors or anything else that provides an undeserved edge, then I&apos;ll still lay my head on the pillow at night and sleep soundly because I know that there is no sin waiting in the dark, under the bed, waiting for the harsh light of judgement.
Congratulations to the New York Giants and your fans. Eli Manning is a good guy, a clean competitor and a credit to the game of football, and he deserved to win and to be called the MVP of the game. And to Patriots fans, I wish you no ill will, I instead pity you and leave you to sulk, licking your wounds like a Siamese cat under the living room sofa. If I were you, I would vote with my dollars to have another coach installed, a man who could restore pride to a franchise that frankly has the tools in place to be competitive for a very long time, without the aid of cheating or the leadership of a small, petty man.

 What If God Was One Of Us? (Joan Osborne) 
Posted on 12/25/2007 at 02:45 AM
Merry Christmas, everyone. If you celebrate Christmas, I offer you the best Holiday wishes I can. If you don&apos;t celebrate Christmas, I still wish you a Merry Christmas, because the holiday doesn&apos;t discriminate. It represents the birth of Jesus, and despite what some folks (mostly Republicans) would like you to think, it represents the birth of the Messiah, the salvation of the human race, and the spirit of forgiveness.
Jesus is often thought to represent love, or peace, and in the worst of times, prosperity, but I believe in Christ as salvation. He is our forgiveness, our bail money for our sins. And we all are with sin, although some larger than others.
Got under-charged at the store and didn&apos;t say anything? You&apos;re a thief. Doesn&apos;t matter if it was $500 or 50 cents, it wasn&apos;t yours, and you stole.
Did you ever tell a lie? Or better yet, did someone tell you something you knew was incorrect and you didn&apos;t say anything to save yourself or someone else&apos;s skin? You bore false witness.
I&apos;m not even gonna ask if anyone ever murdered anyone...those are relatively few and far between these days, although my neighborhood is getting to be like the Old West...there are so many make-shift monuments to people who have been killed unnecessarily that a drive up my street looks like a carnival midway, there&apos;s so many stuffed animals, ribbons and candles.
Have you coveted your neighbor&apos;s wife? I&apos;m a coveting bastard, and some days I don&apos;t even know why. I think it might be part of the male brain, but enough women do it also that I can&apos;t just say it&apos;s a manly problem. I had a discussion today with a friend who told me that a mutual friend of ours is actually cheating on his wife, and we were both stunned, but his defense is that he can&apos;t help himself. Well, actually, it seems that he has been helping himself, and that&apos;s the problem.
It&apos;s a rough world today, and it&apos;s starting to get my goat. I want to cling to my religion, cling to hope, cling to the idea that things are going to get better, but I&apos;m surrounded daily by reminders that the world is a mess, and it looks as though greed is going to win the day.
We&apos;re greedy people, we are. Maybe I&apos;m just talking about Americans, but maybe all of us are. I think in this country that Capitalism has gone beyond an economic system and turned into some sort of wicked game. It&apos;s not about free enterprise, it&apos;s about seeing how much wealth the staggeringly rich can accumulate, to the duress of the peanut-eaters at the bottom of the cash-flow ladder.
We&apos;ve forgotten the ideas of charity and good will. We&apos;ve forgotten the lessons that to give out of our abundance is fine, but to give out of our scarcity is to be truly blessed (the widow&apos;s mite). Would our country have to maintain public assistance programs if everyone reached out to their neighbor to make sure they had enough? No, they wouldn&apos;t have to. Would there be violence in the streets if everyone had a job, a nice place to live, a sense of purpose and community? No, they wouldn&apos;t have to, people only commit violence when they are mentally ill, scared, desperate, hungry, angry or tired. Folks who are stable in their mind and body, social situation, housing and family structures are usually peaceful. Can we strive for that? To make sure that everyone is warm, safe and secure, and able to pitch in to the system to work together? Isn&apos;t that what cities and counties and countries are for?
I don&apos;t pretend to have all of the answers. I used to consider myself pretty well-educated, and recently, I&apos;ve been discovering that I don&apos;t know half of what I need to know, and that half the knowledge I&apos;m carrying around now is either outdated or can be categorized under music or movie trivia, with a little English Literature thrown in for good measure.
But I *do* know this;
Whether you believe in the Bible or not, or the divinity of Jesus Christ, or any god, for that matter, I have found that the Bible contains a lot of good information. If you were to follow the teachings of the Bible and not concern yourself with the person of Jesus Christ or the history of his life and teachings, you would still live a better life than one led by leaning on your own understanding.
Christ preached humility, poverty, meekness, pureness of heart, and righteousness despite persecution. And I believe He will save the world, each of us.
It is the most curious of things, that the Lord would come to us, as a child, born in a manger among the beasts, in absolutepoverty, a King who loves us so much that he came down from His throne to be one of us, the meekest, weakest one, and allowed himself to be stoned, whipped, beaten and killed for our sins, as payment for our sins that we would come to the Father and have everlasting life.
Can we save ourselves? Can we humble ourselves, treat the least of ours as the best, can we be charitable, forgiving, meek? Can we change our world from a society of &quot;Get as much as you can&quot; to a world where no one goes without, no one hungers, no one shivers, no one cries out because there is no love?
That would be the best Christmas present of all, wouldn&apos;t you say?
What If God Was One Of Us
If God had a name what would it be?
And would you call it to his face?
If you were faced with him
In all his glory
What would you ask if you had just one question?


*And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah


What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make his way home


If God had a face what would it look like?
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that
you would have to believe
in things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints
and all the prophets (*)


Trying to make his way home
Back up to heaven all alone
Nobody calling on the phone
&apos;cept for the Pope maybe in Rome(*)


Just trying to make his way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to heaven all alone
Just trying to make his way home
Nobody calling on the phone
&apos;cept for the Pope maybe in Rome

 Shake&amp;Bake (The Dickies) 
Posted on 12/08/2007 at 11:38 AM
It&apos;s funny how much difference a day makes. On Thursday, I was writing about how upset I was because my friends at WCMF radio in Rochester were getting downsized, and then the next day, I received news that put everything in perspective...one of my good friends had died.
It was one of those deaths that come out of nowhere...the guy wasn&apos;t sickly at all, from outside inspection, he wasn&apos;t old, there wasn&apos;t any terminal disease he was being treated for. He was my age, 40, about to turn 41 in just a few weeks. Matter of fact, based on the bag of prescription medication that I tote around with me on a daily basis (I&apos;m on about eight different types of medication for everything from thyroid disease to cholesterol to high blood pressure...I even take a generic Claritin to clear my sinuses so that my sleep apnea constant air machine I wear when I sleep will work), if I had to bet who would go first, me or him, I would&apos;ve put the money on me.
But it didn&apos;t work out that way.
Mike Glosek was a good guy. He was a comic from Buffalo, and a friend of mine. If you want to read up on him, there&apos;s a small memorial that was written on him in the Buffalo News, and there&apos;s a link to it on the front page of my website at www.ralphtetta.com that will take you right to it. But that memorial tells about the things that Mike accomplished and doesn&apos;t really tell you about the man.
After I left the management team at the Comix Cafe in Rochester back in the summer of 2001, a series of managers came in to run the club. Mike moved from Buffalo at the request of Ed Bebko, the owner, to be one of those managers. By the time 2004 rolled around, Ed had taken on a partner in the business who would one day buy him out, and during that time of co-ownership, Ed had requested that both Mike and I help out the new guy, show him the ropes of running a comedy club, and keep the ship sailing in the right direction.
For whatever good or ill, that help seemed to be resented and much of our counsel was rejected. After a time, I became frustrated and gave up, returning to the road and staying there for the sake of peace of mind and just being tired of always being the target of criticism. Mike suffered quite a bit, too, and even though he was always a good-spirited person with a mind that leaned toward positive thinking, his customer-service and friendly ways always seemed to be in conflict with a management staff who felt he was giving away the store. At management meetings, Mike and I would sit on one side of a large table and the other managers would sit on the other. It was like being on trial every week. I hated it and bailed, but Mike, out of loyalty to Ed, stayed and took his lumps. He was a better man than I in that respect.
Mike went by the nickname &quot;Shake &apos;n&apos; Bake,&quot; which I never got the full story where the nickname came from, but he was a true throwback to the golden years of standup comedy. Mike was the guy who spent as much time in front of the bar as he did behind it, glad-handing customers and really making them feel welcome in the club. Mike was the guy who made sure everyone had a good time, and it frustrated him when his efforts were thwarted. He ran the bar on karoake night, &quot;Shake &apos;n&apos; Bake Wednesdays,&quot; and he would bartend and then run out and sing, and when I would get up to sing, the shots of whiskey would start coming. He knew I wasn&apos;t much of a drinker, and I think he wanted me to loosen up. He wouldn&apos;t stop until everyone was having as much fun as he was.
As a comic, he was a true variety act, mixing standup, juggling, magic, and a straitjacket escape that was his closer. At one point, Mike, Joe Fico (another Rochester comic) and I developed a show called &quot;The Fat Pack&quot; and we worked on putting together a true cabaret show containing music, spotlight comedy sets, and any other things we could throw in. The show was not supported by the club, out of spite would be my guess, and it closed after just four shows. But I remember fondly sitting in Mike&apos;s living room, notepads out, coming up with comedy bits, working on blocking, and throwing our all into the show.
He and I were a lot alike in many ways. We were the same age, started doing comedy at the same time, and had a background in club management. His fanatical love of Billy Joel is paralleled by my fanatical love of Bruce Springsteen. He loved horror films, while I more favored comic books. And we both lived and died with the Buffalo Bills, although Mike loved the Buffalo Sabres hockey team more, even to the point that he was layed out in his replica Sabres jersey. We both did magic, although I gave it up at a young age, moving to bass guitar as an outlet for my stage jones. And we both have young daughters, although Mike also had a son who I was not aware of.
But when we spoke about things spiritual, that&apos;s when we really clicked. Mike enjoyed listening to Joyce Meier, a televangelist who is on TV quite a bit. He quoted her often, and one of his favorite passages from the Bible was the urging to be &quot;more than a conqueror,&quot; and he used that to get him through the difficult times at the club and the conflict with some of the people there.
His door was always open to me, he loved socializing, he loved to be around people who were enjoying themselves, and when he finally succumbed, it was to heart disease. An autopsy showed that his heart had enlarged and he had a major heart attack while he slept. That&apos;s no way for a 40-year-old man to go, and it has been a real kick in the gut for me. I&apos;ve been working with doctors and nurses and nutritionists in an attempt to reverse the many years of neglect I&apos;ve shown my body, and Mike&apos;s death has become a backdrop for my own mortality and while I&apos;m thankful that I now have medical attention that will prevent me from suffering a similar fate, I am angry and upset and conflicted that Mike will never have the same chance, the same opportunity to correct whatever neglect led to his demise.
I wanted to write about this just after I got the news, last Friday, but I was choked up and couldn&apos;t focus. Then after the wake on Tuesday, I wanted to write, but I was overcome with emotion and felt I wouldn&apos;t be able to do Mike justice. Today I guess I&apos;m more lucid and I&apos;ve had time to properly digest this loss, but I still don&apos;t feel properly prepared to fully explain how wonderful Mike was and how lousy I feel that he&apos;s gone, and that I didn&apos;t spend enough time with him because I felt that he would always be around, a joyful constant in a world that is growing greyer and colder by degrees.
A little less than a week before he died, Mike wrote me a MySpace message that basically said &quot;call me,&quot; and I didn&apos;t call him right away, waiting for a time when I would be settled, in a hotel room somewhere, and have time to talk. That time never came, and I have more than my share of guilt about it. After all the loss I&apos;ve experienced this year, you&apos;d think that I&apos;d be a little more aware that there is no time better than today to make that call, there is no tomorrow, and the only joy you will have in this life is the joy that you are willing to seize. But I guess I have to keep getting the buckets of cold water until I finally get it.
Tonight, I will have a drink for my friend, and I will hate myself a little that he&apos;s not there to pour it.

 Fire (Jimi Hendrix) 
Posted on 11/29/2007 at 06:53 PM
The word came down the pipe today that a lot of the radio personnel at WCMF, my old employer, were going to be losing their jobs. It&apos;s a shock, to be sure...not that folks in radio are being flushed out, but that the folks who are being fired had held on to their jobs so long.
Radio is a tough business, and anyone who&apos;s ever been involved in it knows that it&apos;s here one day, gone the next and if you don&apos;t produce, you are OUT. There are also trends that go swinging back and forth like a pendulum with a knife on it, first going to the &quot;automated&quot; format (who needs jocks?) to the &quot;live&quot; format (it sounds terrible without a live person to intro and back-announce the songs!).
I worked at WCMF 96.5 FM, fresh out of college, first as a research &quot;rat,&quot; then later the director of the department. I produced &quot;hook tapes,&quot; 35-song collections of clips from songs that we would &quot;test&quot; by playing them over the phone to people at their homes in the evening, asking them if they&apos;d like to hear the songs played &quot;a lot more, a little more, the same amount, a little less, a lot less, never again, or unfamiliar.&quot; We&apos;d then load all of the information into a computer and calculate &quot;burn scores,&quot; letting us know things like &quot;people like Led Zeppelin, but they&apos;d rather hear &apos;The Immigrant Song&apos; than &apos;Stairway To Heaven.&apos;&quot; It was a lot of fun, and hard work, and most importantly, flexible enough to allow me to do comedy on the weekends, long weekends if necessary.
I was let go in the spring of 1994, and then hooked up with the George Carlin tour, but it still took me a while to get over being downsized. I remember Stan Main, the Program Director, basically breaking the news to me that I was out, and my team was out, which I should have seen coming as we shrunk from eight team members to four and then finally, three. I begged to be reassigned, but there was no place to put me, and I got a nice letter of recommendation from Stan that I never used, and never worked a &quot;straight&quot; job again, if you don&apos;t count being General Manager at the Comix Cafe, which was more like being a professional bull-rider in terms of the office decorum and corporate culture (that didn&apos;t exist, thankfully). I even wore a denim shirt every day, with the club logo embroidered on the pocket!
When I was at WCMF, I used to stay late after work, and use the computers in the sales staff&apos;s cubicles. I basically taught myself Microsoft Word by trial and error, typing up letters and making cool custom cassette covers for my bootleg tapes (also cadged from the station&apos;s enormous music library). It was like a playground to me, a playground with a paycheck! Not that the work wasn&apos;t hard, it was rewarding, and Stan was relentless in spurring us on. We&apos;d be on the phones, talking to survey respondents and trying not to let them know what station we were calling from (lest it skew the results), and Stan would come into our room on his way out for the day and give us all a beating, usually either a back rub or numerous slaps on the shoulders while he would yell out things like &quot;We&apos;re playing the hits and we ain&apos;t popping zits!&quot; and shit like that, which to this day, honestly, I don&apos;t know what it means. Still, Stan was a great guy and he paid me money to be part of the team, and giving me and my department the axe wasn&apos;t his decision, it was the guy above him, so in that regard, I hold him blameless. He probably kept our department alive a lot longer than management wanted him to, in the name of the data that he needed to keep doing his job so well. But now he&apos;s gone, fired, a casualty of the merger with Entercom, or the takeover, or whatever you want to call it.
Dave Kane, the Music Director, Assistant Program Director and afternoon host, was always very friendly to me as well. My comedy buddy, Ray Salah and I, used to come in in the afternoons and work with Rich Van Slyke, the production chief, making &quot;spec spots&quot; which are basically fake commercials that the sales staff would then take cassette copies out to prospective clients and try to sell them. We worked hard to make them funny, because funny sells, and I don&apos;t know if the sales staff ever sold any of the spots, but Rich wound up taking a reel of those spots and used it as a demo to get a better paying job at a rock station in Atlanta. Still, those afternoon sessions were fun, and Kane-O was always nice to us, breaking our balls and I think once he had lunch brought in and invited us to chow down. Compliments are nice, paychecks are good, but share your food with a fat man and you&apos;ve got a friend for life.
Mark Cronin lost his gig today....Mark&apos;s been in radio longer than foam windscreens on microphones. Marc was the night jock at WCMF, and I saw him every night when I worked. When you&apos;re talking about the nicest human beings on the planet, Mark&apos;s name has to come up or you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. He did a pantomime once to entertain some of us in the break room of a guy getting thrown out of a bar, whereby he grabbed his own collar with one hand and the back of his pants with the other and &quot;threw&quot; himself out of the room, a move that I&apos;ve stolen more than once. I miss working with a guy like that, and to hear that he&apos;s being flushed reeks of age-ism, and more importantly, a complete lack of respect for the skills that he brought to the table. He was a workhorse who cut commercials, liners, and spots, all while songs were playing in the other studio, doing the job of two guys. Now, thanks to corporate culture and the cold, cruel ways of business, he&apos;s doing the job of no guys, and the &quot;bum&apos;s rush&quot; pantomime is creepily appropriate.
I&apos;ve been crawling on the web trying to get the whole story, and they are not naming names, but it seems as though about eight people are part of the purge, and I can only talk about the three I know of that were my friends. I got into radio originally because as a comic, I thought it would help my local standing, but basically it did nothing for me in that respect. In order to gain credibility as a comic, you needed to be a better comic, not a mediocre one with ties to a radio station.
There are other names that are being bandied about as far as their futures, like Brother Wease and his sidekick Tommy Mule, and rumor is also that WPXY&apos;s Scott Spezzano is done for. Scott&apos;s a friend, and he used to host Wednesday nights at the Comix Cafe when I was General Manager there. Tommy and I have a long working relationship, and I think Wease doesn&apos;t like me. But I hope they don&apos;t go down without a fight, whatever happens.
I&apos;ll be interested to know where all of this winds up, as you can&apos;t work in radio for as long as I did and not be fascinated by the moving and shaking, but for guys like Dave Kane and Mark Cronin, you&apos;re talking about literally decades of being a Rochester radio presence. And Stan Main wrote the music programming software that the station used.
The new guys better be really fucking good is all I&apos;m saying.

 Too Long In Exile (Van Morrison) 
Posted on 11/12/2007 at 12:34 PM
Did you miss me? I&apos;m back. I haven&apos;t blogged in five weeks. I went into exile for a month, and then added a week to express solidarity with the Writer&apos;s Guild strike.
Ha ha.
Actually, I took a break after a friend of mine made a comment about my running journal. I guess a couple of local Rochester comics made a remark about my blog (which was funny and true), and it made me become introspective about this blog and the process of keeping it.
When I started keeping the blog, it was with the intention of keeping a running, blow-by-blow account of my life as a standup comic out on the road, an account that my infant daughter could go back to years from now and read about what her father was doing when he went to work.
Well, something along the line hijacked that process. People started reading it.
I am nothing if not an attention whore. I was starved for attention when I was a boy, growing up in an Italian household with two siblings, where you had to fight to be heard, much less acknowledged. My parents encouraged my pursuits, but were not totally aware of them. Perfect example, my father knew I wanted to be a writer, so he went out and bought me my first typewriter, a nice manual model from Sears with on-line correction, and then later, a fancy electric one. But he never read anything I wrote. Dad wasn&apos;t much of a reader, just TV guide and the morning paper.
Standup comedy was a cry for attention, just as my foray into working in radio was a cry for attention. I went back to college three years after I graduated from high school, a victim of my parent&apos;s and my ignorance of the college application process. I was literally signing up for classes at St. John Fisher college in Rochester the day before classes were to begin, and it felt forced and I didn&apos;t feel ready, and I aborted the process out of fear.
When I returned to school, it was at Monroe Community College, and I discovered the campus radio station on the second day, the campus activities board and school newspaper a few days later. And after only a year, I visited my first comedy club and got on stage at open mic night. I will celebrate the 20th anniversary of that event this coming May.
All of those outlets were designed to garner me attention. I was very good in school, but always in the top ten percent, usually never first or second. I was voted &quot;Chronic Complainer&quot; in my Senior Yearbook, but at the same time, earned &quot;Most Spirited.&quot; I ran for Student Council President as a junior and won, because no Senior wanted the job. I had a landslide victory over a Sophomore, a young lady who wasn&apos;t very articulate, and reveled in the prospect of leading assemblys, chairing meetings, and generally making people consume all of the hot air I was generating.
Even as a comic, I regularly lapse into the trap of basically telling an audience &quot;Dig what I have to say,&quot; rather than concentrating on making them laugh and enjoy themselves. My show isn&apos;t about them, it&apos;s about me! How dare they sit and stare at me and my offerings? I can get preachy and ramble on about points that I consider to be important and sacred, but I&apos;m in the wrong venue. It&apos;s about beer and chicken wings, not the indiscretions of the Right Wing. It&apos;s about laughs and dick jokes, not educated discourse. And if I think something&apos;s wrong with America, then maybe I should just write a letter to the editor.
Well, this entry isn&apos;t a cry for help, it&apos;s the result of five weeks of heavy meditation. Do I continue to write, and if so, what about? The &quot;old&quot; blog style was becoming a parody of itself. I was writing about where I went to lunch, a bad habit I picked up from a comic I used to read who was opening for a big name performer, and he would detail the catering. I guess I thought it was funny that he was getting almond-crusted tilapia, and I was eating biscuits at Cracker Barrel or making a turkey sandwich in my hotel room out of my mini-fridge.
On a show a couple of weeks ago, a fellow comic was lamenting to me that &quot;Since when did it become the law that if you enjoy your job, it&apos;s no longer considered work?&quot; Comedy is hard work, but a lot of people seem to think it&apos;s very easy. On the surface, it is just talking for an hour or so, and then hanging around in the bar soaking up alcohol and affection, but it&apos;s the result of a lot of denial and sacrifice. Ask any comic who&apos;s been in this business fifteen years or more about missing birthdays, anniversaries, school plays, recitals, christenings and any other number of important family events, and the accounts will be legion. And God help me, I cannot see the forest for the trees, that with a daughter who just started preschool this week, and will be turning four years old in March, will have to go down that road with me, dealing on a daily basis that daddy&apos;s never home.
My last blog was about the death of comedy as a business, and maybe it was just my way of excising the feeling I had that I would have to give up this business in the name of having a stable home life, and to do well and justly by my wife and daughter. It&apos;s true, the business is hard and the economy is rough, but comedy hasn&apos;t been a cornucopia of plenty since the early 80&apos;s, years before I got involved in the game. I turn 41 on Thursday, and the prospect or idea of changing professions is daunting to me, for a couple of reasons. First, I would be changing professions at a late age, with no real training in any field other than wise-assery. Basically, I&apos;m gonna be the sassiest toll-collector on the New York State Thruway. Second, in no matter what vocation I undertake, I&apos;m most likely going to be robbed of that attention that I currently enjoy, and I do not know how that will affect me on a long-term basis.
A mid-life crisis is a terrible thing, but I believe that&apos;s where I&apos;ve found myself, wondering about the future, lamenting the past, and damning the present. The secret, a good friend of mine who is basically in my same age demographic, is to not dwell so much on the negatives and give myself credit for the positives. And to work on myself.
Well, one area that I guess I need to work on is to not be so needy in the area of public adulation. So that means I&apos;m not going to write as much. A criticism of my blog, in the past, was that I didn&apos;t write with any passion, I didn&apos;t talk about things that were emotionally strong. I fixated on pithy minutiae, and it made for a boring read. So I&apos;m going to strive to only return to this forum when the spirit moves me, when I get cranked up by something important, when I get touched by an angel or when I get driven to tears.
And hopefully it will be a fitting body of work for my daughter to go back and read.
Yours Sincerely,
Ralph Tetta

 It&apos;s The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) (R.E.M.) 
Posted on 10/05/2007 at 05:24 PM
Standup comedy is over. The &quot;dead cat bounce&quot; has happened, and we&apos;ve got bigger things to deal with now, like correcting our world and adapting to the bleak landscape that is stretching out in all directions all the way to the horizon.
Comedy is dead. I hate to be the one to &quot;call it,&quot; but I&apos;ve seen too much the last few months to be convinced otherwise. Clubs are closing, or teetering on the edge of absolute bankruptcy, comics are struggling to fill their schedules, work is falling out and except for the few who cater to corporate functions, cruise ships or other secure audiences, our industry as a whole is looking like it is on the verge of a total collapse.
I started doing standup comedy right after the big comedy &quot;boom&quot; of the mid-80&apos;s. During that time, Ronald Reagan was the President of the United States, people were making money, and they were recovering from a very depressing time in this country called the 1970&apos;s. During that time, the economy was in a very deep recession, there was an energy crisis, and American pride was at an all-time low. Disco was killing rock &apos;n&apos; roll, cocaine was the only way a lot of people could get up in the morning, Iran had American hostages that we couldn&apos;t get released by force or diplomacy, and there was a nationwide malaise. America needed a shot in the ass. Along came &quot;Dutch.&quot;
Reagan boosted the American economy by artificial means, and prosperity became the norm throughout the 1980&apos;s. Vice President Bush criticized Reagan&apos;s plans at the time as &quot;Voodoo Economics&quot; and when the checks started coming due during his presidency in the late 80&apos;s and early 90&apos;s, he was found to be correct in his assumptions. There was a great deal of dissatisfaction during the 1980&apos;s, despite the prosperity that was all around. Punk rock rose out of the ashes of decadent disco, as well as the overlying nihilistic themes of heavy metal. And over in the corner, standup comedy reared it&apos;s head, with over-the-top performers like Sam Kinison, Emo Phillips, Howey Mandel and Robin Williams, banging the drum at a manic pace to remind us that something was still wrong.
Comedy thrived because it was a release, an explosion let out in small bursts of laughter in small, dark, smoky clubs. The spartan brick wall that became the cliche for a standup comedy club was a remnant of the underground coffee houses of the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s where visionairies like Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl and their ilk began singing songs of criticism and discontent. In the 80&apos;s, performers like Bobcat Goldthwait, Bill Hicks and others used their &quot;freedom of screech&quot; to trumpet the call to arms for a generation not to be lulled into complacency. In Canada, voices like Kenny Robinson, Ron Vaudry and others were adding to the discourse as well. An art form that came to adolescence on the Merv Griffin show and the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson was now in full-blown adulthood, and itching to make a name for itself in the world.
Well, after a few fits and starts in the 90&apos;s and the early years of the 2000&apos;s, comedy is looking pretty grey at the temples and just doesn&apos;t seem to be able to get around very well anymore. Clubs are closing, major festivals have called it quits, and the rooms that are prospering are the &quot;one-nighters&quot; out in the sticks, the communities where everyone is about ten years behind the times anyway, and they still squeal in delight when someone sings their favorite song at karaoke night, and the acid-washed jeans are still hanging on like some sort of lifeboat off the fashion Titanic.
The club in Rochester that I once made my home seems to be in similar trouble; flagging crowds, dissatisfaction with acts that kill elsewhere, and currently, an inability to accept credit cards for payment (death for a bar or restaurant) seem to signal a circling of the drain. The club in Buffalo closed months ago, and other clubs around the country, notably ones in Kansas City, Detroit and Chicago, have reportedly either closed, plan on closing, or are using local talent in an attempt to trim payrolls and hotel expenses in a valiant effort to stay above water.
I worked last week at the Pittsburgh Funny Bone, my first time at that club and an enjoyable experience, despite a back ailment that left me able to walk and stand for only a short period of time, and then virtually crippled. The crowds were sparse, except for Saturday night, but fun to perform for, and the most interesting experience was speaking with Jeff Schneider, the owner/booker of the club and a man who has been involved in the business for over 25 years. I was able to speak with him on the level of someone who has booked a club himself and dealt with &quot;big name&quot; comics&apos; agencies, and we had interesting stories to share. Jeff has a reputation of being a bit of a beast, but frankly, he&apos;s another individual who realizes that standup comedy has run it&apos;s course and may be &quot;playing out the string.&quot; He spoke passionately about wanting to get into radio, to have a show where he could speak his mind about whatever topics ocurred to him, and he riffed at will about a few things that were engaging, funny and although bordering on crass at times, never objectionable. It is the spirit that standup comedy was born of. Obviously, Jeff has always had this passion or he never would have subjected himself to the rigors of running and managing a club for so many years.
As a career comic, I have decisions to make; I can re-tool my approach to the business and start throwing my rope at corporate events and colleges whose big budgets make them recession-proof, but require strict language requirements. I could go completely underground and pitch myself entirely to fraternal organizations, Moose lodges, Elks, Eagles, Volunteer Fire Departments and others that pepper the landscape like so many mushrooms after a spring rain. I could even re-invent myself as a motivational speaker, using humor to boost optimism in a corporate setting and putting into play the tools that I&apos;ve learned throughout my life to overcome obstacles and keep an optimistic view.
I know that sounds funny, claiming to be an optimist while playing Chicken Little and proclaiming the end of Standup Comedy, the single thing that has driven me half my life and consumed almost every waking hour in some way, shape or form. But I am optimistic, if only in the way that decrees that I will still be able to do what I love, only I will be required to do it somewhere else. If you are a regular reader, you&apos;ll remember that I wrote months ago about an engagement at a volunteer fire department event that went very well. If I&apos;m performing in front of an appreciative audience and doing it for a fair living wage, then I may sacrifice the fame of working a big comedy club in hopes of being seen and getting a shot at a TV spot that may help make me a household name, but the clubs stopped offering those opportunities years ago. If the goal of working the road is only to earn a living, then it will still be possible, only it will take a different kind of marketing on our parts as comedians to keep our calendars full.
A huge problem with the clubs today rests with the audiences; they simply don&apos;t have the money to spend. The entity booking talent is the one that is rolling the dice; in a public show, a performer is promised X amount of dollars to perform, and the club gambles that they will sell enough tickets, drinks, food items and souvenir paraphenalia to pay the comics, the rent on the building, the utilities, the suppliers and the staff, with a little money left over to call &quot;profit.&quot; In a corporate or college setting, the money comes from somewhere else....an entertainment budget in the corporate sense, and student activities fees in the college arena. Neither colleges nor corporate talent bookers are dependent on ticket sales to the general public to make their show &quot;work.&quot; They have built-in audiences and no profit requirements. The fraternal organizations have the same setup; they aren&apos;t pitching to the general public, which doesn&apos;t have any money to spend anyway, but instead collect &quot;dues&quot; from members and apportion the money to their events, whether monthly, semi-annually or annually, as their individual case may be.
So the cry now is to diversify, not put all our eggs in one comedic booker&apos;s basket, and look for other things to do. Some clubs will be recession-proof, to be sure, depending on the market and the club&apos;s ability to stay relevant in that market. But now they are only going to be a small part of the picture for some of us comics, rather than the bread &apos;n&apos; butter.
I am at a club this week that seems to be doing well, the Comedy Club On State in Madison, Wisconsin. Gus and Mary have cut out their niche through hard work and perserverance, and last night, they had an almost capacity crowd (on a Thursday!) and one of the open-mic guys taped a chunk of my set which now resides on my MySpace page, which I urge you to go check out at www.myspace.com/rabidralph and feel free to send the link to your friends!
Keepin&apos; it Real,

 Fast And Loose (Motorhead) 
Posted on 09/26/2007 at 02:28 AM
I know it&apos;s a little early in the season for a horror story, but here goes....
I worked in Connecticut this past week, which for those of you keeping track, is my 22nd state this year, and you should know that working a lot of different places usually makes me happy.
And actually, this trip was making me happy until the very end....here are the details.
I took off from Rochester on Thursday morning and had an uneasy feeling about this roadtrip; too many loose ends were hanging. I was working two consecutive nights for two different bookers, and I didn&apos;t have an itinerary for either of them. I put one together for myself using all of the information, but it was still just put together by me, and I didn&apos;t feel &quot;ready&quot; to leave the house without all of the info coalesced on one document.
I picked up Ray Salah, my best friend for the last 19 years and my opener for Thursday and Friday nights, and off we headed on our six-hour journey into Connecticut. The drive was easy, although New York State raped us on the Thruway tolls, $9.90 one way....thank you, New York. No wonder businesses are leaving the state by the dozen.
We got to the Motel 6 in Niantic, Connecticut around 5:30 P.M., more than enough time to catch a nap and shower up and get ready for the big show. We were playing at a place called Raya&apos;s in Gales Ferry, CT, booked and hosted by Connecticut comic Dave Zamoider. Dave&apos;s a new jack in the business, and when I put the word out on the internet that I was looking for a companion gig to my Friday engagement, he put together a show for me, which was very much appreciated.
Raya&apos;s is an Italian restaurant owned by a middle-eastern man named Muhammed. It was sparsely attended, but the sound and lighting were decent and the folks who hung out mostly paid attention to the show. Ray went up and did his thing after Dave&apos;s mc set, and I was looking forward to a good barroom show.
Five minutes in, one of the chains holding one of the long lamps over the billiard table gave way, sending the Budweiser light crashing to the slate top of the pool table. It was just a sign of things to come.
I soldiered on through my show, which becamean open forum for discussion. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I enjoy interacting with the crowd, but this wasn&apos;t even heckling, they were talking to me like we were at a cocktail party! I&apos;d get them with a laugh, and then they had stories to tell. At one point, a birthday cake came out, and Muhammed *shushed* me so they could sing &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;
The high point of the evening was meeting Dave, and Liz, the bartender, a 26-year-old lass who sported a unique tattoo on the back of her right shoulder; it was a heart with a nail through it. The tattoo, she explained, was relevant because it represented all the pain she had gone through, and it&apos;s placement represented that it was all behind her. I would never personally get a tattoo, but if I did, it would have to be one such as this, with an actual pertinent meaning. She was delightful to meet and to speak to, and making the acquaintance of people like her, even if only for a short time, is one of the reasons I truly enjoy my job.
The next day we dragged our feet checking out of the hotel, cadging a late check-out by virtue of not leaving on time, and we headed out to lunch and then the library to use the internet (my laptop is in the shop, being de-virused by The Geek Squad), and then we started off on a tour of Central Connecticut&apos;s thrift stores. I found five good ones in the phone book, mostly in New London and Norwich, and we started off on our journey. I wound up finding quite a few books that I expect to sell for a profit on the internet (a great way to kill time while on the road), and after a series of twists and turns, we started out towards Marlborough, CT, home of the historic Marlborough Tavern.
We didn&apos;t get a hotel for the gig as one was not provided, and we planned on just doing the gig and driving the five and a half hours home. We got started promptly at 8:00 P.M., and started performing for the 40-some-odd patrons in the room. They were enjoying the show, and every so often, John, the manager (who I found to be of the stiff-upper-lip, soft spoken New Englander variety), would pop his head in the room to see how things were going, and the crowd would always get quiet, like the proctor for an exam had just caught them cheating on a test.
A little while later, at the 50-minute mark, I was closing up, planning on doing an hour, and Ray popped his head in the room and said, &quot;Ralph, you have to get off stage NOW.&quot; I was a little concerned because I was in the middle of an oral sex bit, and I was wondering if I had somehow crossed the line or something. Come to find out, the booker had a headliner not show up at another gig about half an hour away, and I was being redeployed.
Ray and I piled into the car and headed to Uncasville, CT, home of the Polish American Club, where Ray and I had performed together two years ago. We were greeted by the club manager, a gentleman whose name I forget, but face I would easily remember. He was an electrician, and earlier in the week a transformer blew up in his face, leaving his forehead and cheeks pocked with a scarring that looked like a strawberry dipped into chocolate sauce. He was wearing goggles, so a raccoon mask of pink flesh ringed his eyes, causing him to have a very intimidating stare.
On stage was Sheila Van Dyke, a comic out of Boston who I&apos;d never worked with before, but had communicated on the internet with. She was rocking the room with what turned out to be an hour of her act, and she wrapped it up and let me take the stage. I did about 35 minutes, as requested by the booker, and closed up. The show had started late, about 45 minutes, and then gone an hour and thirty-five, plus whatever time the mc had done. The sound system wasn&apos;t very impressive, either; it sounded like mud coming through three pairs of panty hose.
After the show, I was shaking hands and kissing babies, selling CD&apos;s and talking to the folks, and unfortunately for me, I happened to be in earshot of the conversation between the manager and the booker&apos;s man-in-the-field, Dave. Dave was basically being told in no uncertain terms that the manager was not satisfied with the services rendered, specifically the sound being bad, the show starting late, and the slipshod manner in which reserves were called in. Luckily, none of this reflected on Sheila, myself, or the mc whose name I don&apos;t think I ever learned.
So now it&apos;s a regular cluster-fuck, with Dave calling the booker on his cell phone and trying to communicate his problem, and the booker insisting that he not leave until he collected the money due. Scarred-up guy was going back and forth with another gentleman who I think might have been his brother, and his brother was advocating for the comics...we did our job, we should be paid. At that point, I just wanted to get out of there, follow Dave back to the gig in Marlborough, and collect my money and drive home. These situations are rarely solved properly in an evening.
So scarred-up guy starts going to the comics one by one, asking us specifically what we were supposed to be paid. He grabbed the mc first, and the kid didn&apos;t know any better so he spilled his guts. Sheila had money coming from another gig she had worked that was part of the budget, plus the money for this show, so she shot off a figure. When it came to my turn, I basically just reached into my pocket and drew out the index card that Ray had scribbled his notes on back at the Marlborough Tavern....&quot;35 minutes, $175.&quot; I handed the card to the manager. He took my home address and promised me a check, which was fine with me...I just wanted this manic night to be over. Basically the three numbers he received was about half the budget for the gig, and he was pretty sure he was being overcharged. Also, he didn&apos;t like the idea that he was paying one of the comics for a show they did somewhere else....I guess that wouldn&apos;t sit very well with me, either.
I helped Dave out with his sound gear, hoping to get him moving back to Marlborough, 30 minutes to the northeast, to collect the money, pay Ray and myself, and let us begin our five and a half hour drive home to Rochester. While I was helping Dave load the gear into the truck, the manager&apos;s brother came out and handed me cash. They asked me to come back into the club and sign a receipt, that I had been paid, which I did. We headed back to Marlborough, with Dave in the truck behind us, and we got back to the Marlborough Tavern, which was closed, but with a few employees finishing up their closing duties. Dave collected his envelope, paid Ray and myself, and we wished him well and drove back to New York.
Long story short, but I guess it&apos;s too late for that, when I got back to Rochester, I got an e-mail from the booker that basically said &quot;Thank you for working the other gig, I&apos;m glad you got your money, you&apos;re not supposed to talk money with the account, it&apos;s not your place, you won&apos;t be working for me again.&quot;
I&apos;ve worked for this booker exactly three times in the last four years. I guess I&apos;m upset because none of what happened really was my fault, if anything, I&apos;m the guy who road in on the white horse and took the place of the comic who was originally booked to close the room. My sin was talking money with the client, who was unhappy to begin with, and bottom line, was going to argue the point that he didn&apos;t get what he paid for regardless of what he was given. Part of the conversation that I did hear was that Dave tried to calm scarry-face down by telling him that they had already come down $75 on their commission....well, that&apos;s basically the difference between what I made closing the first gig in Marlborough and the second one in Uncasville...so they basically came down on their commission by trimming it off the headliner budget, i.e., me.
And I&apos;m fired.
Well, again, I&apos;m disappointed that somehow I&apos;m the bad guy here, although I communicated with Sheila online and she was fired, too, and misery loves company, I guess. All I know is that I responded back to the booker&apos;s e-mail in an even, respectful tone, explaining my position. This is a business, and if you conduct business poorly, it will come back to haunt you. The Bible says &quot;Your sin will find you out,&quot; and if you&apos;re playing fast and loose with the budget with a client, eventually, something will happen and if you&apos;re overcharging, then you will have to explain yourself.
This week, it&apos;s off to the Pittsburgh Funny Bone, and it&apos;s the first time I&apos;m working the club, sharing the stage with Matt Davis from Charlotte, North Carolina, and it&apos;s none of your business what I&apos;m making!
Yours Sincerely from the Connecticut Unemployment Line,

 Get In The Ring (Guns &apos;N&apos; Roses) 
Posted on 09/18/2007 at 05:50 AM
Good morning. I can&apos;t sleep, so I may as well blog....also, I&apos;m getting more and more miserable about keeping this journal; life seems to be getting in the way, but that&apos;s good, right?
My week started out with a bang, courtesy of a performance at Turning Stone Casino with Great Lakes Productions&apos; cast of Joey and Maria&apos;s Comedy Wedding. Now, I used to perform regularly with this cast and also with the casts of their 25th Anniversary show and also the spoof show &quot;The Soapranos,&quot; but haven&apos;t done one of these shows in years. In their heyday, we were doing three shows a week with the wedding, so I know the show pretty well, and once we got into the swing of things, it was easy to drop right back into place, remembering the lines, the bits and the moves. It was a lot of fun. I played Enzo Prosciutto, the usher on the end who has a bunch of gold chains pinned inside his coat and tries to hawk them at the wedding. I had a great time with old buddy Mike Ruiz, who flew in from New York for the show, as well as cast members new and old. They really had a great bunch of actors working on the show and the corporate client, Kinney Drugs, were a good audience, the only criticism being that they got a little tired toward the end of the show, but that&apos;s on us; if we see them starting to flag, then we should be cutting bits and getting to the end.
Special thanks I offer to the cast of Joey and Maria&apos;s Comedy Wedding; Ken Rondo (Joey Gnocchi), Jordan Betts (Maria Cavatelli), Allison McCrossen (Viola Vermicelli), Maly Iorio (Mama Nonna Cavatelli), Adele Cuminale (Theresa Tortellini), Bill Repp (Pastor Faggioli) and Mike Ruiz (Giovanni Gnocchi) with Patrick McCann running sound. They boosted my while I was trying to remember the show that was such a big part of my life for so many years, and I had a blast. Thank you all!
Wednesday, I substitute hosted at the Comix Cafe for Leo DuFour and Eric Kirkland. I&apos;d worked with both of these fellows before, but in a managerial capacity, and it was fun sharing the stage with them. My back and legs were still a little sore from the Joey and Maria&apos;s show because of all the running around, but my pulled groin muscle seemed to have settled in my foot, and actually the extra activity seemed to have massaged it out, so I was o.k. That&apos;s the beauty of hosting...you only need to do about 15 minutes up front (if that) and then you can go sit down for half an hour.
Friday morning, after a series of errands, I loaded up the car and headed for the Comedy Zone in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. I really enjoy working this particular club because the gig is in Doc Holliday&apos;s steakhouse, and they have the Harrisburg West Conference Center adjoining the building, which means the gig, the lodging and a great restaurant are all within 50 feet of each other. Also, it&apos;s right off of route 83, so I&apos;ve driven past it so many times on the way to and from other gigs that I don&apos;t even need to print out driving directions anymore.
Friday night was excellent, and I shared the stage with headliner LA Hardy and our mc was Rich Carucci, the Comedy Steamroller out of New Jersey. We clicked as a team and I told both those guys that this was the best show I&apos;d been a part of in a long while. Rich has an in-your-face style of hosting and his spritzing is definitely his strong point. LA is a seasoned veteran with a great stage presence and perfect timing, and as for me, well, I should be headlining, so I was knocking it out of the park every show. I set a personal record for merchandise sales going back to March when I was in San Antonio, and I had to work a seven-show week to beat this week&apos;s four-show schedule. And the money is always helpful, believe me.
Saturday I was up with the birds (those birds that get up at 10 o&apos;clock) and out running errands. I hit the bank, an office supply store (I won&apos;t tell you which one, but they sell staples) and the library where I used the internet while my laptop is in the shop getting de-bugged. They were having a book sale and I picked up some interesting titles, including some religious and philosophical ones, as well as a copy of Aldous Huxley&apos;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; that I&apos;d never read before but had been promising to get to. Then I met Rich and LA for lunch and we chattered about the comedy business and our families and I enjoyed some of Doc Holliday&apos;s delicious sirloin-tip chili (one of their best items, in my humble opinion). Then it was back to the room to grab a nap, anticipating two shows and a five-hour drive home.
The shows were great, not as energeticas the Friday early show, but good nonetheless and for our early Saturday show, we were treated to a guest spot by the area&apos;s own Sonya King, who clocked in with a quick five. I hadn&apos;t seen here in years, but she&apos;s been working steadily all over and she was fun to pal around with. I added a bit this week that I&apos;d done before, but only as a stand-alone bit, and I figured out how to dovetail it into a core bit that I&apos;d been doing, and it worked great. And it was clean! I always impress myself when I can add a new clean bit to the set and have it get a really strong response, which is the prize you get for trusting yourself, I think. After the second show, the club settled up with me, I went back to my room to pack out and get ready to head home.
I rolled my luggage out to the car, tossed it in, and cursed myself for packing so quickly for this trip as I failed to bring a coat or a sweater because it was so warm during the day, and now it was down around 46 degrees and all I had was a button-up shirt to throw on over a t-shirt. I got some heat blowing in the car and called my wife, and just before I got on the exit for route 83, I noticed my wedding ring was gone!
I hung up with her and spun back into the parking lot of the hotel/restaurant/club. I left my room key (one of those credit card swipey numbers) on the bureau so I had to find the night manager, who was totaling up the club receipts, and ask him to cut me a new room key. I raced back to the room and found.....nothing. I was really starting to sweat, as I didn&apos;t want to end such a good weekend on a downer, and I started re-tracing my steps. LA was chilling in the lounge and was yelling at me &quot;Why are you still here?&quot; And I told him that my wedding ring was gone and he yelled back &quot;It&apos;s in your car!&quot;
I decided he was probably right. I ran back to the car, flipped on the dome light and got ready to start tearing my luggage apart, figuring the ring must be in my other pants that I had changed out of. The ring was sitting, clear as day, on the back seat next to my bag. I put it on, kissed it like I always do when I think about my wife, and got heading home. What a relief! It had slipped off my finger when I was packing the car, due to two things; one, I&apos;ve lost a whole lot of weight since I got married, and the ring fits loosely to begin with, and two, the cold makes my fingers shrink, and the ring has slipped off before, but usually I notice it. I lost about 40 minutes but not my wedding ring, so I was happy to have made the sacrifice.
Today is Pamela&apos;s birthday, so if you know her, feel free to drop her a birthday wish, you can also get to her via my MySpace page (she&apos;s the first friend in my top 40, so she shouldn&apos;t be difficult to find). She&apos;s not old, but she doesn&apos;t get carded at bars anymore, much to her chagrin, so don&apos;t tease her about having so many candles on her cake that there&apos;s only enough room to write HB instead of Happy Birthday!

 The Song We Used To Call Wasting Time (Riverboat Gamblers) 
Posted on 09/10/2007 at 11:28 PM
Hey, I&apos;m back in New York after my hell-drive home from Charlotte, North Carolina. Ever bust a windshield on a rental car? I have....
So I worked Friday night in Morgantown, West Virginia, headlining with special guest Kate Brindle. I got in early and did some laundry, as I had only packed for the last weekend in Newport News, and didn&apos;t plan on continuing on to North Carolina, but did it anyways. I lounged around the hotel room and made it down to the club (just off the lobby of the Ramada) and was met by Larry, the house mc and an old friend. He didn&apos;t look very happy.
Come to find out, the hotel didn&apos;t have my check. I was basically a fill-in booking, by a week or more, not very short notice but just enough to cock things up. I had a short chat with the folks at the front desk, and Larry, and the best we could come up with was me returning to Morgantown on my way home on Sunday (I was passing right through) and they would have my check ready. I&apos;m a pretty easy-going guy, so I agreed, and set off to do the show.
Kate was a little nervous, having never worked in this venue (or anywhere in West Virginia, for that matter) before. She did a great job, got a couple of applause breaks, and got off just a minute or two shy of what was expected of her. No problems, she&apos;s a veteran and a performer who can do the job on stage. Now it&apos;s my turn.
Well, Larry and I talked before the show, and we were recounting the last three visits I made to Wit&apos;s End in the Ramada at Morgantown, West Virginia. This time around, they didn&apos;t have a check for me. The last time, my feature act got sick and I had to do the whole show myself. The time before, they were sold out and I had to share a room with the other comic.
I let all the pressure come out on stage, and it was fantastic.
I don&apos;t like to be the guy who crows about how great he does, but I was there, so I might as well tell the story. I had them eating out of my hand. I knew what they wanted, and I shoveled it at them as fast as I could. I ad-libbed, messed with the crowd, and just gave them an avalance of punchlines. And they loved it! I sold a bunch of merchandise, handed out a big pile of MySpace cards (the legions are growing), and headedback to my room to settle down and get some sleepto prepare for the big 6-hour drive to Charlotte, North Carolina.
I went down for breakfast (the Ramada in Morgantown has a great hot breakfast buffet...I recommend it highly) and then headed back to my room to shower and pack. Upon returning to my room, I got a call from the front desk.
&quot;Mr. Tetta, how was your breakfast?&quot; It was the night manager from the evening before. &quot;Just fine&quot; I answered. &quot;I have some good news&quot; she said. &quot;We have your check, so make sure you stop by the desk before you check out.&quot;
Now, not bragging or anything, but if I didn&apos;t destroy that room the night before, they wouldn&apos;t have gone through all the trouble to get me my check. Matter of fact, if I ate it, they would have stiffed me on the Sunday and just mailed it to me. But I got people hopping, and the next day, they were STILL talking about my performance.
Saturday night, it was night and day. I cashed my check and made the drive with time to spare, and was feeling pretty good about my luck that day. The luck dried up at the Belmont Comedy Zone at Starz Tavern, which was a great room the last time I played it. The only thing that changed was the audience, which got real &quot;red-necky&quot; this time around, and they weren&apos;t hecklers, but they thought the show should be a conversation, which is great, but that&apos;s not the way I wrote my part of it.
Headliner Kerry White was great, and it was great to see him again, and I was working with the mc, Jared Burton, for the first time. Second show was the nightmare, as a rumble broke out about something Kerry said about religion, and long story short, four police cars.
This week should be a little tamer, as I appear at the Harrisburg, PA Comedy Zone with Mike Veneman, a great comic and an old friend. In between, I have a &quot;Joey and Maria&apos;s Comedy Wedding&quot; show at Turning Stone Casino, and a night as the fill-in mc at my home club, the Comix Cafe, so it&apos;s a mixed bag of performances, but enough to keep me busy.
Oh, and the cracked windshield? Yeah, I caught a rock in the windshield last Friday and was pissed that I didn&apos;t take the extra insurance, but when I turned the car in today, the guy said &quot;Oh, we don&apos;t care about glass&quot; so I ran away like I stole the car. Hertz is officially back on the &quot;good boy bench&quot; as far as I&apos;m concerned.
If you have a little spare time and you don&apos;t mind integrating a little religion into your life, say a prayer for Buffalo Bills tight end Kevin Everett who got injured in yesterday&apos;s game against the Denver Broncos and may never walk again.
Best,

 Power of Positive Drinking (Lou Reed) 
Posted on 09/06/2007 at 04:30 PM
Well, good afternoon from Garner, North Carolina, where I&apos;m sitting in a McDonald&apos;s using their brand-new Wayport Internet service. It&apos;s $2.95 for two hours of internet, but when you can&apos;t find a Panera Bread or a public library, it&apos;s just the ticket for browsing the web or as us road comics call it, &quot;our day job.&quot;
I&apos;m right around the corner from my sister&apos;s house, and I&apos;m meeting her and her husband for dinner tonight. It will be the first time I&apos;ve seen her since before my father died, and I&apos;m looking forward to the visit. Hopefully, the conversation won&apos;t get too heavy...I&apos;m not really in the mood for it today.
I last checked in on Saturday, before the Saturday evening shows at Cozzy&apos;s Comedy Club in Newport News, Virginia. The first show was pretty sedate, a non-smoking crowd full of folks who wanted to chat, so chat I did. Straight comedy wasn&apos;t impressing them at all, they wanted to discuss things. It was as annoying as a husband and wife trying to converse when he wants intercourse and she wants to talk about feelings.
Second show, they wanted straight sex, no foreplay. I said something bitchy about some guy who was drinking a Jaeger bomb, which to the uninitiated, is Jaegermeister dropped into a glass of Red Bull energy drink. It&apos;s God-awful, and I called the guy a pussy and told him &quot;real men don&apos;t drop their liquor in soda pop.&quot; So, here comes the Jaeger shot with the Red Bull, courtesy of faggy drinking guy. I downed the shot and returned the can of Red Bull, unopened, to the server. &quot;I drink whiskey!&quot; I thundered, and six shots of Jack Daniels&apos; later, I was declaring war on West Virginia and trying to get the Virginia National Guard to go with me. And to show you what sweethearts the gang at Cozzy&apos;s are, the last shot was watered down....thank God....after 5 shots of whiskey and a Jaeger, who knows what a sixth one would have done? Good looking out Jimmy, you English bastard (Jimmy is the limey bartender at Cozzy&apos;s....good guy, but pushes the cocktails like he&apos;s on commission).
The next morning, I paid for my indiscretions with a blood sugar count of 300...the proper range is between 90 and 120, if you&apos;re keeping score. I had only a mild buzzing in my skull, not a full hangover, but I wasn&apos;t going to play three rounds of racquetball, either. I took it easy, getting laundry done as I stayed as a guest of the club in their comedy condo (also known as Karen&apos;s house). Karen spent most of the time sleeping, so it was easy for me to stay out of her way.
Monday, I spent most of the day killing time, screwing around on the internet and capping the day off with a six-episode [Scrubs] marathon. I managed, thanks to the TV section of the Sunday paper, to find six episodes of Scrubs on three different stations thorughout the day, with only a half-hour break to watch Futurama (another of my favorite shows).
Tuesday, it was back to the road and a six-hour drive to Lake Norman, North Carolina and the Comedy Zone room in the Galway Hooker. I was working with headliner Just June, who I work with a lot, and I had a fun show. I did a bit on stage for the twelve or so audience members, basically asking them if they wanted to hear my normal comedy act, or would they indulge me in telling a story? They opted for the story.....had they seen my act before?
Wednesday, I headed over to Greenville, North Carolina, home of the University of East Carolina. The gig at Tie Breakers was fun, there were about 60 people there, which was quadruple the attendance the last time I played there. June knocked it out of the park, and I was no slouch, if I do say so myself, although it&apos;s getting harder and harder for me to do only 25 minutes.
The highlight of this morning was finding out a little prank my good friend Steve Burr pulled on me....while my laptop computer was unattended, he changed some of my toolbar favorites to porn sites, and didn&apos;t change the icons. Boy, was I surprised when I tried to Google something! The funny thing was, I was looking for information about Bill Clinton, and I wound up seeing a girl with a cigar.....truth is stranger than fiction, I guess.
Friday I&apos;m back to headlining at the room in Morgantown, West Virginia with feature act Kate Brindle. Kate&apos;s a good kid and we&apos;ve worked together a bunch before, so I&apos;m looking forward to some good-natured tomfoolery, or in other words, I&apos;ll make off-color remarks, and Kate will scrunch her nose and make a face at me like if she smelled something bad. Look out, Morgantown!
Saturday, it&apos;s back to Belmont, North Carolina, just outside of Charlotte, where the weekend has dried up from Thursday through Saturday to just the Saturday. It&apos;s a small club, and the last time I was there, I did really well, so I&apos;m happy to be going back. The last time I was there, I was with Robert York, the cowboy juggling comedian, and this time I&apos;m with Just June. I&apos;m starting to feel like a Comedy Zone All-Star!
I&apos;m semi-dreading the 12-hour drive home, but I&apos;ve gone longer and the weather&apos;s mostly nice, so I just need to keep my head down and plow, and try not to dawdle in the morning. If I can get moving by 7 or 8, I can do the whole drive in daylight, and that will make a big difference, I think. Also, I spared myself the Labor Day traffic by not going home last week, although I&apos;ve become pretty homesick. Maybe if I&apos;m lucky, I can listen to some football on the radio while I&apos;m driving. That sattelite radio package is looking better by the day.
O.K., that&apos;s me out. Have a good one and enjoy the rest of the summer weather before it splits.

 Promised Land (Elvis Presley) 
Posted on 09/01/2007 at 03:08 PM
Good afternoon from Newport News, Virginia, home of Cozzy&apos;s Comedy Club. I&apos;m seated in a cubicle at the NN Public Library, which among other things, provides us wireless interntet users a place to park our laptops. I&apos;m checking e-mail and droning away on MySpace, like any good road comic with fuck-all else to do on a Saturday afternoon.
I got home from Florida safely and made my way directly to bed, courtesy of the fact that I can&apos;t sleep on airplanes. I tried, and I wore my hoodie to cover my eyes and I actually slept a little bit, but not enough to really feel refreshed. I had a big cup of coffee with breakfast, and all that did was give me an underlying buzz, like a small snooze alarm in my head parked behind both ears. Just enough to keep me rattling and away from blessed slumber.
I slept until my internal clock reminded me that I was hosting open mic at the Comix Cafe in less than an hour, and I jumped in the shower and got ready. I managed to pull a groin muscle wrestling around with fellow comic Steve Burr in the Jokeboy&apos;s comedy condo, and it still hurts today, roughly a week later. I had always heard about groin pulls in the sports world, mostly football players out on injury, but never knew they were so damaging. I figured the injury would be proportionate to the size of your groin, but that&apos;s not the case....mine goes from just under my left nut to just below my left knee....and I guarantee you, I&apos;m being taxed well into the next bracket on that one.
I appeared at the Comix Cafe the next night as well, as they are saving money on high-priced radio talent Tommy Mule in favor of more afordable talent such as myself. I had a good time working with old friends Valarie Storm and Ross Bennett, who I have had the pleasure of working with before, and while Ross labored under his old stage name, Eddie Strange.
I was supposed to work the weekend, but a headlining opportunity arose at Cozzy&apos;s Comedy Club here in Newport News. I hadn&apos;t worked at Cozzy&apos;s in quite some time, and wanted to get back in. Come to find out, I had been deleted from the roster due to my name appearing on the website of a competing club that was open in the area for a very short time. Needless to say, I never worked at that club, and I was blackballed for no good reason, but I was offered as a replacement this week and accepted, so my exile must be over. And that was funny to me, too, because the booker told me that the original headliner couldn&apos;t work the weekend because &quot;his wife wouldn&apos;t let him.&quot; Now, I&apos;ll be honest, my wife&apos;s gotten awfully spoiled this summer with me being home so much, but I don&apos;t know that I&apos;d ever let her forbid me to work. That would be cause for a guy to up and get his own place, let me tell you what.
So I rented a car, as my wife needed access to our vehicle this weekend, and I got a nice Kia Spectra to drive. It&apos;s a peach, and good on gas, not that I need it so much this weekend. Gas here in Virginia is running $2.44 a gallon, quite a change from the $2.89 a gallon I left in Rochester. I drove all night Thursday to get through Washington D.C. (the worst traffic jam in America) before Friday morning, knowing full well that it&apos;s Labor Day Weekend and traffic was going to be double. I got to Petersburg, Virginia, and parked at a rest area for a three-hour nap. I didn&apos;t crack my windows at all for safety reasons and I didn&apos;t run the air conditioning to save on gas, and the morning sun roasted me like a rotisserie chicken. Not fun.
I worked last night with Richmond comic Ray Bullock, a guy I&apos;d never met before, but clicked immediately with a pre-show discussion of movies, television and literature. He drove back home so we didn&apos;t get to pal around today, which would have been cool. I&apos;m out on lunch right now, checking e-mail and MySpace and if I don&apos;t go around and do some junking looking for books at thrift shops, I might just go back to the condo and rest. But before I do, I&apos;m gassing up and I&apos;m planning on stopping at the comic book shop over by the club to see if they have any Teen Titans Go! back issues for my nephew William, so I&apos;ll have a nice afternoon before I have to start getting ready for two shows tonight.
Next week is a tour of North Carolina with a stop in West Virginia, and then a few weeks of gigs in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, closer to home. It feels good to be getting back into my &quot;road comic&quot; routine. Home is great, but when you work on the road, you want to be on the road.
God knows the desire of your heart, and trust in him for all things.
Peace,

 Those Shoes (The Eagles) 
Posted on 08/25/2007 at 03:49 AM
It feels pretty gay to tell a shoe-shopping story, but I&apos;m gonna do it.
I&apos;m in Ocala, Florida, home of Jokeboy&apos;s Comedy Club (www.jokeboys.com) and nestled snugly into the two bedroom comedian condo with comedy buddy Steve Burr, my partner in crime this week (www.steveburrcomedy.com). Steve&apos;s been complaining that his MySpace page is far outgaining the hits on his regular site, so be a friend and look at his website today...it will cheer him up.
When last I wrote, I had one more show to do in Reading, PA at the Reading Comedy Outlet, and I&apos;m happy to report that the show went fine, even though the crowd was overly happy to respond to every joke I attempted to tell with a little addition of their own. I eagerly finished my set and turned the stage over to Auggie Cook (www.AuggieCook.com) and went back to my hotel room to pack. I must have misjudged the time, though, because I started back to the club to try and sell some merchandise, and wound up walking through the crowd as they were leaving the club. I still managed to move a few pieces, which was encouraging. It&apos;s hard, I think, to enjoy a comedy show when others in the crowd are heckling and making the show a living nightmare for the comic. It&apos;s like assholes who sit up near the projector at the movie theater and keep sticking their hand in front of the lens...you just want to slap the shit out of them.
I drove home in the evening fog, courtesy of a hot day and a cold night. I wound up taking a strange detour to Allentown, PA, a little out of my way but a nicer, more well-lit road home. I stopped by my brother&apos;s house and dropped off a comic book for my nephew, which he enjoys quite a bit. It was 4:30 in the morning when I hit Syracuse, so I killed my headlights, rolled quietly up the driveway, and dumped the bag with the comic on my brother&apos;s enclosed front porch. I called him the next day and he collected it along with themorning paper, and I was glad that it didn&apos;t just get trampled over as they left the house.
So what about the shoes?
Sunday was a sleep day and Monday was a packing and preparation day for my Tuesday morning flight to Florida. I was rocking the new contact lenses and they were dried out as hell by the time I landed in Orlando. I met Steve at the airport as we were lucky enough to coordinate our flights so that his plane from Los Angeles and my plane from Rochester landed within half an hour of each other. We rented a car and started off north to Ocala.
Steve had very little sleep, having been in the air since 10 o&apos;clock the night before, and I was pretty red-eyed with only about four hours of sleep under me, and we were heading up the 441 when Steve decided to pull a little trick on me. We were stopped in four lanes of traffic at a light, and Steve honked the car horn and used his driver&apos;s controls to roll my window down. Needless to say, I looked over and caught the glare of two Hispanic girls who were none too amused. The driver, a hard-faced young lady who looked like she just got off shifts flipping mattresses at the EconoLodge, rolled her toothpick to one side of her mouth, bobbed her head and said &quot;What do you want?&quot; Actually, she only said two of those words, connected by the word &quot;chew.&quot; Ah, you gotta love the Latinas.
I tried to scavenge as much dignity as I could in the situation, and I said &quot;Sorry, my friend thought you were someone else&quot; to which the girl replied &quot;Yeah, well you look like Peter Pan&quot; which I didn&apos;t completely understand. Then she rolled her window up and back down and then said &quot;You look like a big polar bear&quot; which I guess is a crack at me being big and white, or maybe a comment on the salmon that I was eating that I had just flipped out of the river with my paw. I sheepishly turned to Steve and said &quot;You can roll my window up now&quot; which made him laugh, because obviously I was too tired to realize that I could have done that anytime I wanted to. Cute little prank, eh?
We stopped for some lunch and made the drive the rest of the way to Ocala, and stopped by the club to get some directions to the condo, and the keys. We got the envelope with the keys and directions, but the directions might as well have been a recipe for blueberry muffins, because all they did was make us lost, sweaty and mad. We finally figured out where we were supposed to be and got settled in, and after unpacking, showering and getting into clean clothes, we both definitely felt better.
O.K., so what about the shoes?
The next morning, we shipped out for Destin, Florida. It was about a 5 1/2 hour trip, but we traveled up onto the panhandle of Florida, and gained an hour by virtue of passing into the Central Time Zone. I was so happy to pick up that extra hour, though, because it meant I was able to have a nice nap. We met early at the Sportsbook Grill and bar, right across the parking lot from the Best Western, and had a little dinner before the show. Or, I should say, we had dinner before the little show. The audience was cobbled together from a small amount of folks who had actually come out for the show, members of the restaurant&apos;s softball team who elected to stick around, and some folks that were in the bar that the manager decided to comp. It wound up actually being a very good show, but it was clear that with shabby turnouts like this one, the venue isn&apos;t going to be doing comedy very long, and that&apos;s a shame, because it was a nice place with a good stage, lights and sound.
The next day, Steve and I hit the road good &apos;n&apos; early, courtesy of a schedule from hell. Steve was booked to open for Josh Blue from Last Comic Standing at the auditorium in Ocala for a 7:30 show, and we had the six hour journey, a missing hour courtesy of crossing the time zone, and the basic creature need of getting back home to shower, iron clothes and maybe eat something. We hit the road early and drove into the sun, and before long, my left contact lens started drying out and basically did everything except shrivel up, jump out of my eye and stick to my cheek. I drove into a hurricane-spawned severe thunderstorm with one camera on standby...you ever drive a car 80 miles per hour with one eye closed? It&apos;s a treat, let me tell ya.
The thunderstorm was so severe, the radio station we were listening to actually cut away from the song they were playing to go to the Emergency Broadcasting System. I&apos;m 40 years old and I&apos;ve never heard anything other than a test from them. The sky darkened and it rained, but the worst of it was south of us, and I sped down route 10 as fast as possible, and once I hit 75 south, the skies were sunny and clear.
We got home, and everything went off without a hitch. Our mc, Chase Holliday, opened the show and I guess he upset some of the seniors from the Villages retirement community that came out (in a big bus, no less) for the show. He asked if they were drinking and they said yes, and he said &quot;Go ahead, the AARP is paying for it&quot; and even though it got him a round of boos, I didn&apos;t think it was that offensive. But some tight-ass called in, and that&apos;s a shame, because he was definitely not deserved of such harsh criticism.
Great....how about the damn shoes, already?
Steve got back before I hit the stage, and we both turned in our sets, and did the basic after-show hand-shaking and product-hawking that has become the norm in our business. Josh came over from the auditorium to take a look at the club, and we chatted for a few minutes. He was nice enough, but didn&apos;t have much to say. He was heading to Atlanta, and I&apos;m sure after winning LCS, he&apos;s probably had his fill of fawning comics, comedy clubs and everyone else that wants to kiss his ass.
Friday was beat, except for the shoes (I&apos;m getting to it, hold on, OK?). Steve and I set out for radio, early, early in the morning. We literally had to get up at 7 AM and drive to Gainesville, which is a full hour away. We got to the Buzz 100.5 FM studios and did about 20 minutes on the Mojo and Leigh Scott morning show, and they were pleasant enough and the spot went well. After getting back home, we unwound for a few hours (I slept, I don&apos;t know what Steve did), and then we went back out looking for lunch and to run some errands.
Well, suffice to say that we continued our lousy trend of getting lost on the winding streets of Ocala and their highways and state roads that all seem to run concurrent of each other and then split off like they were diagrammed by a dyslexic electician. Steve wanted to get a pair of Converse sneakers, but he was looking for the old-style white ones, not the black Chuck Taylor ones that are fairly ubiquitous. So we happened into Shoe Carnival, and while Steve was looking around, I headed back to a rack marked &quot;Clearance&quot; to see what they had. I take a size 13, and they had a pair of Rockports, brown, and a nice looking pair of shoes, I might add. They were originally $89.99, and I&apos;ve never paid that much for a pair of shoes in my life, and I never will. But they were marked down to $49.00, and that&apos;s a $40.00 savings.
Now, I&apos;m generally a frugal man when it comes to such things. I don&apos;t make a lot of money doing standup comedy, but I know a deal when I see one. And I had to think hard on this purchase. I flipped a coin, measured the weight in my mind, and finally picked them up and headed to the sales counter. On the way, I noticed that one of the shoes was missing a lace. A brown lace, for a brown shoe.
I met Adam, the store manager, and I said &quot;Adam, I am interested in these shoes from your clearance rack, but I notice that one of &apos;em is missing a lace. What can we do about this?&quot; I figured Adam would conjure up a pair of laces, hand me one, toss out the spare and chalk it up to the cost of doing business. But I guess that must have been ruled out when the price was slashed so severely on June 1st, 2007, the date of the first clearance sticker on the box.
Adam looks at me, looks at the shoes, and with the soul of a used-car dealer says, &quot;Listen here. I don&apos;t have any brown laces, but I will mark these down to $29.99 and you can get yourself a pair somewhere else, Wal*Mart or somewhere, deal?&quot; $30.89 later, your pal Ralphie is walking out of Shoe Carnival with some kickin&apos; waterproof Rockports. So now the fun begins. We headed over to Wal*Mart, and no brown laces in stock. We headed to the Paddock Mall, and hit every store that had shoes, but no brown laces. The first shoe store actually had an &quot;orphan&quot; box of laces, and I asked the clerk to hold on to a pair that were flat, not round, but just a little shorter than the original laces. After a day&apos;s walk through the mall, Steve had acquired a pair of white Converse All-Stars and I headed back to Shoe World or whatever the name of the store was to retrieve my brown laces. The clerk, a strawberry-blonde-haired beauty, handed me the laces, and I said &quot;What&apos;s the damage?&quot; to which she replied &quot;Take them. They don&apos;t have a bar code so I wouldn&apos;t know what to charge you anyway.&quot;
I wore them on stage tonight, and they looked and felt great. $90.00 Rockports for $30.00. I doubt that even my lovely wife, Pammey &quot;Discount&quot; Davis, could have done a better job. And she&apos;ll try running a coupon through a Coke machine if nobody&apos;s looking. And that&apos;s the first and last shoe story that you&apos;ll ever get out of me, I promise!

 Cinderella Man (Rush) 
Posted on 08/18/2007 at 12:16 PM
Boy, I will be one happy camper when summer is over. Comedy in the summer BLOWS.
You can tell that I&apos;m not that much into the summer as I&apos;ve only been blogging once a week or so....that&apos;s a far cry from my original goal of &quot;every day&quot; which I quickly learned is a ridiculous goal.
So last Friday, Steve Natarelli and I ventured up into Niagara Falls, on the U.S. side, and did guest spots at Fatboy&apos;s Comedy Club, where I was actually supposed to be headlining for money all this past week. The show drew exactly six people, and then some more folks trickled in, including a group of folks who were just going out to get a drink, not necessarily looking for comedy, but to commemorate the one year anniversary of their mother&apos;s passing. Fun times, eh? With six people in the audience, we decided to do some time for them anyway, because they made the trip out and nobody wanted to cancel.
&quot;Evil Jim&quot; from one of the Buffalo radio stations went on first after mc Bernie Rice rolled out ten minutes of the &quot;I&apos;m getting killed over here!&quot; stock lines. I don&apos;t know how much time or money he had invested in the club, but he wasn&apos;t making any of it back that night. Jim turned in a short set, not very emotional but almost like in a &quot;let&apos;s get this thing over with&quot; sort of way. I went up, same crowd, and did half an hour like I was taping a live album. I started out doing some improv, but they really wanted to hear jokes, so I did my act, peppering it with conversation. The thing I was sure they wouldn&apos;t buy was exactly what they wanted. Live and learn, I guess.
Steve did his show and then closer James Middleton, who supposedly has been around forever but who I&apos;d never heard of before, did his 20 minutes and got off, and then it was back to Rochester for Steve and myself. It&apos;s important to get those comedy repetitions in or the muscles of the mind go soft.
Sunday I made the scene at Boulder Coffee Company and my wife got a little cranky that I was going, thinking that it should be a &quot;family night.&quot; Well, I&apos;ve had so much time off this summer, *every* night is a family night! I need to WORK! I&apos;m starting to feel like one of those humps in the movie &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; lined up at the docks and they only need nine guys, but there&apos;s 150 guys standing there. Enough, already!
Anyway, the set was good enough....I found an old set list, circa 1995 or so, and I blew the dust off about half the bits and they still played. I need to start investigating some of my old tapes and see if there are bits that I&apos;ve forgotten or that have fallen into disuse and can be rejuvenated. New material is great, but I&apos;ve already done the work on a lot of stuff over the last 19 years, and I shouldn&apos;t let that work go to waste.
Tuesday, I hosted open mike at the Comix Cafe, and it was a &quot;fuck or fight&quot; crowd, complete with two young, drunk heckler chicks sitting in the front row, except for when they were running outside to smoke. It was disruptive for them to keep getting up so many times during the show, but at least it was a small respite from the one girl&apos;s constant yelling out of &quot;Hey-YO!&quot; which the last I looked was an Ed McMahon catchprase from the old Johnny Carson show which went off the air when this bitch was six years old. One of the open micers brought his buddies from work, and they basically talked through everyone&apos;s set and then left as soon as he was done. There was absolutely no ettiquette to be found, and very exasperating to say the least. The kid was all juiced that he had friends coming, but that&apos;s the worst thing you can do when you&apos;re new in the business...friends in the audience don&apos;t help, they make you nervous, and when you bomb (and all new guys bomb), you have to hear it from them at your day job/school/wherever you know these humps from. Not a very good combination.
Wednesday, I was running errands all day and had settled down to get ready for some dinner, when the bell rang for Yours Truly as a call came in from the Comix Cafe. Seems their regular host, WCMF&apos;s Tommy Mule was on vacation or something and couldn&apos;t make it, and how soon could I be there? Showtime was 8:30, and it was five after eight, and I made it there with three minutes to spare. It was nice to pick up the extra money, especially since my pay for running open mic Tuesdays had been cut. Well, the Wednesday show was more of the same from Tuesday, almost like the Tuesday audience had trained the Wednesday people how to act, and even though we were working on the main stage, in a room with proper lighting, pre-show music and the like, they were still a little rowdy and inattentive, until I started shouting at them, which got them focused. Matt Bergman, our feature this week, and Bob Jay, our headliner, both turned in admirable sets but the 140 folks in the room were a tough sell.
One of the funniest moments of the night was after the show, I was hanging out in the lounge with Matt as he was peddling his comedy CD to interested audience folks, and traffic at his table was so light, at one point, a guy playing billiards nearby set his beer glass down on Matt&apos;s table while he was shooting. I guess since it looked like nobody was using the table that there was no harm done. Matt laughed it off and I promised him that this would go in the blog, and here it is. Ta Da!
Friday I returned to the road for my first actual sleepover gig in what seems like months (actually five weeks) and headed out to Reading, Pennsylvania, home of the Reading Comedy Outlet. It&apos;s a five hour drive from Rochester, unless you count construction delays, and then it turns into six or more. I ran into a hassle on the route 80 heading east and decided to four-wheel it on some back roads, and lucked myself into a route that dove-tailed right into 61 south, which heads right into Reading. I had plenty of time to get ready for the 9 PM show, treating myself to a shave and a hot shower...my back insisted on reminding me that six hour drives are a young man&apos;s game, and I&apos;m not in that age class anymore. Hot water always seems to do the trick for me, though, and I&apos;m suspicious that a lot of it might actually be in my mind.
We had a decent turnout for the show, and afterwards, headliner Auggie Cook and I compared notes; it seemed that the crowd was awfully fickle as to what they would respond to, and I noticed early that dirty material was not so much what they wanted, so I worked away from it, and actually still wound up doing some sexual material, but &quot;walked around&quot; the topic, which they appreciated. I had applause breaks and silence in the same set! It was very weird, to say the least.
One last note....gas here is $2.56! I paid $2.69 when I got off of route 80 and thought I was the king, and then saw it at WaWa for 13 cents cheaper! I&apos;m tempted to go buy a very large gas can and fill&apos;er up for the ride home back to Rochester, home of $2.94 unleaded and you have to be a wholesale club member to get THAT.
Alright. One more show tonight and then it&apos;s back home for a couple of days before I return to Florida, and some decent-paying road work....plus, my second airline flight of the year....whoo-HOO! Cramped seat, recycled air and luke-warm beverage service, HERE I COME!
Up The Irons!

&quot;I should be tired/but all I am is wired/ haven&apos;t felt this good in an hour.&quot;
It&apos;s another week of summer under-employment as the Ralph Tetta North American comedy tour takes another brief hiatus. I was originally supposed to perform in Niagara Falls, New York this weekend, but the club went dark for the summer due to lackluster crowds despite being the only game on the U.S. side of the border. So I replaced it with a gig in Charleston, South Carolina, and then that gig imploded slightly, forcing me to cancel it, and now I have the weekend off. I&apos;m going to Niagara Falls tonight anyway, as I understand they are mounting one semi-pro show to give the open micers a place to work out, so I&apos;m going to support, and will tread the boards if given the offer. I&apos;ll be making the trek with Steve &quot;The Nuclear Guy&quot; Natarelli, who was kind enough to offer to pick me up on his way west. It should be an interesting time as two &quot;old guys&quot; bust in on the young turks of Buffalo comedy looking to show them what-for.
Tuesday, I hosted the open mic at Comix Cafe in Rochester, and we had our usual selection of talent represented...I&apos;m amazed sometimes at the 20-or-so comics who will show up every week or every other week or so, it&apos;s always a good mix. We have ordained ministers, older folks, college kids, college-aged kids who never went, African immigrants, teachers, strippers, drug addicts and magicians who show up every week, vying for the cash prize or their part of the stage, their time to shine, to live their show-biz dreams.
And then there&apos;s Dr. Will.
Dr. Will is a guy who I&apos;m pretty sure is not a real doctor, or if he is, there is more wrong with our health care system in the United States than the manner in which we pay for services. He comes out most every week, signs up, and then almost always draws the last number, or near the last, and then sits on a bar stool near the door, like a bouncer ready to check I.D.&apos;s, and once in a while, he disappears into the parking lot, possibly to get high as many a comic has joked before.
This week, we had ten comics and about the same number of patrons, and I wasn&apos;t going to green-light the festivities until I got word from the owner. After all, he would have to supply the winner of the open mic contest a cash prize, and pay me for my services for the evening, a budget of about $75, on top of payroll for the club. We got the O.K. to run with a truncated cash prize, $25 rather than $50, and we were off to the races. I was happy; I had to cancel last week when we had 14 comics and six patrons, and I needed the money. Some folks had gotten back to me that they felt I canceled because I &quot;didn&apos;t feel&quot; like doing a show, but there&apos;s nothing farther from the truth. I do comedy for a living, not as a hobby, and I need the stage time as well as the income. Believe me, summer has been shabby enough this year that I&apos;ve had plenty of time to bond with my family, I need to balance it out with some work.
So we ran the open mic, and Dr. Will drew number ten out of ten....last. While performer number nine was on stage, Will came over to me and asked to scratch his name off the list, but somewhere during number nine&apos;s set, Will decided he wanted back on. Two weeks previous, he had scratched his name off the set list and did not perform. I don&apos;t know his rhyme or reason, but I respect it regardless.
So Will goes up tenth, and goes over his time by almost double, but I let him go because we were on schedule, he was last, and he was doing what I thought was his closing bit. But he was dragging it out, repeating a lot of things, and just generally trying to get milk out of a rock...it just wasn&apos;t happening. I didn&apos;t care that he was last, Joel the bartender and I (the judges) had already determined the winner and Dr. Will was going to have to have a far superior set to win the money, and at the five-minute mark, he hadn&apos;t scored enough points to make it into the top three, if we had such a thing.
After the show was concluded, I announced the winner (not Will), and one of the comics on the show (who I had scored in the top three but not the winner), took me to the side and wanted to speak in private regarding my viewing and critiquing a tape he had made at another show. When we returned to the lounge from the back showroom, Will had barracaded himself in the men&apos;s room (a one-seater) and was hammering on the fixtures and fighting Joel and Gary, one of the club&apos;s security guys who had stopped in because the club&apos;s softball team&apos;s game had gotten rained out.
I had to call 911, and by the time I explained the situation to the operator, Will was out of the bathroom and moving to the exit. I called off the police, and thanked the operator for her time. Then, someone came running in and yelled &quot;They&apos;re fighting in the parking lot!&quot; Luckily, when I called the 911 center, I got the same operator I had just spoken to, and she dispatched officers to the scene. Long story short (or is it too late for that?), four Brighton police officers responded and the cute blonde female officer went to question me while the three white male cops went to go talk to Will, the scary, bald-headed black man. Suffice to say, another fledgling comedy career has been nipped in the bud as Will has been barred from the premises, and that&apos;s sad because just three weeks ago, Will was quizzing me as to what he had to do to get on stage in the main room on the weekend. I&apos;m pretty sure I told him that he had to have strong material that he did week after week, instead of going on stage and ranting, but I guess that sounded like &quot;Lock yourself in the bathroom and bash on the fixtures, and then get in a fistfight in our parking lot.&quot; A lot of people don&apos;t know this, but that&apos;s exactly how Brian Regan got started. And then his brother Dennis Regan rode on his coattails, but that&apos;s another story.
Wednesday, Pammey&apos;s family had a mini-reunion, as folks from her mother&apos;s side of the family converged on Rochester, and we had a nice cookout. It was a good day for it, clear with just a little wind, and we had a great time. I worked the grill all day, and then had to leave around six o&apos;clock to start heading east to Geneva, New York, for a one-night engagement at the Ramada Inn. I brought a change of clothing, but it wasn&apos;t until I got in the car that I smelled how smokey I smelled, having stood in front of the grill all day sacrificing beef patties and white hots to the gods of lighter fluid. I called ahead to the Ramada and asked about being able to use a shower in one of the meeting rooms (they always have the full bathroom in there), and they said they were sold out so they didn&apos;t know what they had available, but when I arrived, they let me into a guest room and I was able to shower up and dress and still had time to watch two episodes of SCRUBS (my favorite show these days).
The gig was fun, mostly older folks, about 90 of them, gathered together at the Ramada for some event called &quot;Farm Days&quot; (don&apos;t ask me) and they were very receptive. The headliner, Tom Anzalone, who goes by the title &quot;The Worst Musical Comedian Ever&quot; had a great show, and it was good working with him again.
So now I&apos;m basically dry-docked, except for tomorrow, until next week when it&apos;s my triumphant return to the Reading Comedy Outlet in Reading, Pennsylvania. I haven&apos;t played there in a couple of years (and no clue why the hiatus in re-booking me) but the important thing is that I&apos;m back and I&apos;ll enjoy the big, fluffy pillows at the Sheraton and all of the culture and nightlife that Reading offers (meaning our show, and then hang out in the lounge and watch young Hispanic people dancing to songs I&apos;ve never heard of).
Peace be with you all! Zweigle&apos;s White Hots rule! (Google it if you don&apos;t know!)

 More Than A Feeling (Boston) 
Posted on 08/06/2007 at 12:52 PM
I&apos;m just getting settled down from a big comedy weekend, headlining at the House of Comedy in Niagara Falls, Canada, and then doing a low-key open mic here in Rochester that turned out to be &quot;old home week.&quot;
I brought my old comedy buddy, Ray Salah, to the HOC as I got him the MC gig for the weekend. I like the Canadian system of doing comedy, because they actually use a stronger comic to MC, and take the weakest guy on the bill and put him in the middle, so the show starts out strong, and then the guy in the middle can &quot;ride the wave&quot; and then the headliner can go knock it out of the park, rather than having a lesser experienced comic start the show.
It was a holiday weekend in Canada, something called &quot;Civic Holiday&quot; which I guess is sort of a summer holiday, but to be honest, it smacked of socialism. Regardless, it made for a smaller audience on Friday, but you wouldn&apos;t know it based on the traffic at the Rainbow Bridge...the cars were lined up all the way to the casino on the American side, it was a mess. Then at the club....40 people. Saturday, the line at the border was nothing, and the club was packed, about 160 folks total.
We had a guest appearance by Wes Zaharuk, a Canadian comic who I toured with last year in Minnesota, and we had Graham Davidson on both shows. I worked with Graham last time I was at the HOC, back in the old location at the AmeriCana hotel. It was great having friendly faces on the bill and I had a couple of very good shows. I wound up writing a new bit that I think I&apos;m going to carry around for a while...I really like that genesis of writing...come up with a new bit on stage, then work it into the set, where it will slowly come to it&apos;s own place, and supplant some other joke which has run it&apos;s course. It&apos;s a very subtle osmosis, too....I wish it were clearer, like if I had some O.J. or Lorena Bobbit jokes I could just throw my rope at.
Here&apos;s a tip for you, too...if you are going into Canada, don&apos;t pull into the cue directly behind the car that is being questioned by customs; wait your happy ass back behind the &quot;stop&quot; sign where it says. Nothing makes you more suspicious looking than not knowing the drill. I saw it happen Friday night, and then Saturday going into Canada, a car followed me right up to the booth and the lady working customs was hollering &quot;Back up! Back up!&quot; in a voice that you could have trained a pit bull with. And then it happened again coming back, some schmuck from New Jersey who didn&apos;t know the customs at customs rolled on up in the cue and they took his Rav4 apart in front of him.
Another nifty benefit right now to working in Canada? The Canadian dollar is almost at par with the U.S. The exchange rate on Friday was .9315, and then on Saturday it slipped to .9313, so basically you&apos;re getting 93 cents on a dollar, and that ain&apos;t bad. I didn&apos;t even change the value of my merchandise, and I sold a few pieces and that helped out with the gas. Tony&apos;s got a good crew up there at the House of Comedy and it&apos;s a family thing; his father works in the kitchen (great Italian meatballs, pop) and his sister Layla is the bartender. She is hotter than fish grease, if you know what I&apos;m sayin&apos; (and you KNOW what I&apos;m sayin&apos;). He stole some of the servers away from the old location at the AmeriCana Hotel, so it was nice seeing Kendra and some of the old familiar faces (plus some of the glassware was eerily familiar....hmmmm).
Sunday night, I dragged Ray out to Boulder Coffee Company for the open mic hosted by Matt Rohr. This makes three comedy nights in a row for Ray, almost like a tour, and for a guy who doesn&apos;t really try to do much standup, keeping himself busy with acting and commercial work, it was necessary to shake the rust off. Well, Ray got a special treat because his cousin David, who had been doing comedy longer than any of us, showed up with his 11-year-old son Jack. Ray, Jack and David all did sets, and I think Jack did the best. Ray worked out some new stuff, I convinced him to let himself go and just tap into the zen of comedy, speak from the heart and trust himself to be funny, rather than leaning on old material, and he did better than I did. I did a few bits that were new and then worked out some improv stuff. I did five bits from audience suggestions, one was great, one was so/so, and the other three I&apos;d like to have back. The important thing was that I stretched and tried to represent myself as a funny person rather than just trying to say some funny things.
Open mic buddy Travis Worth did a bit that genuinely made me laugh, and I was proud because traditionally, I was used to seeing him struggle. But he&apos;s a good kid and I&apos;ve always been pulling for him, and when he got the pop, I started an applause break from the back of the room and he totally deserved it. I like the atmosphere at Boulder because it was very positive and supportive, and you don&apos;t see that much anymore at open mics anywhere. Last week, we had to cancel the open mic at Comix Cafe because we had 13 comics and only six people to listen to them. I don&apos;t like canceling because I need the money with all the summer fall-outs I&apos;ve had to endure, but if the club isn&apos;t going to make any money, they frown on paying me AND handing out a cash prize. I officially hate the summer.
So this week I&apos;ve got a one-nighter and my weekend is open, but then it&apos;s clear sailing until Christmas. The gig is in Geneva, New York. Maybe I&apos;ll be lucky and there will be a convention (bada-BING!).
O.K., I&apos;m done. Have a nice day.

 The Year of the Cat (Al Stewart) 
Posted on 07/30/2007 at 02:34 AM
What a difference a week makes. This was definitely a week of mending, fixing and putting things right. It feels good, like a triumph over forces that may be allied against me.
Ray Salah and I drove home all day Sunday and into Monday morning last week...no matter what route we took, we were vexed by wrecks on the highway, backing traffic up for miles in some cases. Everytime we would get off the highway to find alternate directions, we would take our new route to bypass the accident, come up a few exits, and BANG! there another accident would be.
At one point, it was so bad I decided to test our rented jeep&apos;s capabilities and I took it over the highway median...traffic was moving fine in the opposite direction, and we&apos;d had enough. It took almost 8 hours to get out of Kentucky, and that just isn&apos;t right, especially when you&apos;re traveling north and south. We reoriented ourselves, took a secondary road through some farm country and hit Cincinatti right around 9 P.M. The rest of the trip kept me awake until 8 A.M., and after 20 hours in the car, I had had enough.
Monday was a recuperation day, and I slept through most of it, waking long enough to take back the rented jeep and take my Mazda in to the shop. $500 later, it&apos;s not exactly ready for the Winner&apos;s Circle, but it&apos;s inspected and back on the road.
Tuesday I hosted open mic at the Comix Cafe, my home club. We had 16 (SIXTEEN!) comics show up and several turned in great sets. It was lousy that I had to choose just one to win the money, but Danny Viola was far and away the best comic that night. I&apos;m hoping that attendance will stay up for the rest of the summer, it&apos;s great to be able to offer that kind of opportunity for the young up-and-comers to get on stage and practice their craft in front of a decent-sized audience.
Thursday, I wound up filling in for Danny Viola as host of the show at the Cafe featuring local favorite Joel Lindley with special guest Spark Mann from Dayton, Ohio. Spark and I had heard of each other but had never met, and we&apos;ve both been working this game for almost two decades each, so it was a nice opportunity to sit down and chat and he&apos;s really a nice and great guy and it was fun sharing the stage with him. Tonight, I got a call to come in and cover the feature slot because Spark&apos;s mom had to go into the hospital and he was rushing back to be with her...I was happy for the stage time but would never have wanted it under those circumstances.
Friday I met with my webguy Bruce and we went over some stuff for www.ralphtetta.com including adding some video and changing the overall style of the site. Bruce is really good at what he does and I trust his judgement as I feel he&apos;s done a great job so far and I don&apos;t want to muck up the business by throwing my two cents in....he&apos;s doing just fine with it. Choosing video clips was a real downer because I don&apos;t like watching myself on video, especially recent video, I&apos;m hypercritical of myself and I get distracted by things, like what I&apos;m doing on stage physically or how I&apos;m doing jokes out of order and the like. I noticed that I was cheating right on most of the footage from Comix Cafe, and tonight I figured out why....the stationary spot is located coming in from the left, and the other lights are gelled to provide &quot;fill&quot; lighting, meaning that when I look left, I&apos;m looking right into the white spotlight, and I have sensitive eyes. I was confused as to why I was doing that because the footage from Gary Field&apos;s club in Battle Creek, Michigan shows me working the whole stage and not favoring any one section. Live and learn, I guess.
After the meeting at Bruce&apos;s studio, I had the unhappy business of taking my cat, Snaxthecat, to the vet&apos;s to be put down. He&apos;s been showing signs of renal failure, diabetes or kidney failure, and for a cat his age (would have been 14 if he lived until his birthday on August 3rd), that&apos;s pretty normal. Snax has had a long life and I didn&apos;t want him to suffer, and so it was an easy decision and at the same time, the hardest decision I ever had to make. Pam and I spoiled him all week, giving him cat treats and petting him and showering him with as much attention as possible, and when I took him in, I cried in the car and then cried again in the car afterwards, long, sucking, baleful sobs that make my neck hurt. I received Snax as a gift when he was only three days old, and he&apos;s been with me ever since. My father loved him in particular and used to look after him when I was on the road, and I hope they&apos;re together in whatever place comes after thislife. Some people say that animals don&apos;t have souls and I guess there&apos;s a good argument for that, but I will say that Snax was special and really touched my family and people who got to know him as an affectionate companion animal with a lot of personality. We got Snax styrofoam balls to play with and he would fetch them like a dog, bringing them back slowly and dropping them to our feet, and then wait for the throw to chase them again. He got along with any other animals in the house, whether other cats or my sister&apos;s first husband&apos;s dog. At night, Snax used to sleep on my pillow up near my head and during the day, one of his favorite manuevers was to jump up on people&apos;s shoulders, walk across their neck, and then drape himself around the person&apos;s neck like a big fur collar. We let him be an outdoors cat until Pam convinced me that it wasn&apos;t a good idea, and he ran across Dewey Avenue, a four-lane main drag through our neighborhood about 500 times when I was living over there. Snax was the first pet I ever had that was truly mine, not just a family pet, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever be lucky enough to have a cat like him again. On Tuesday, Snax&apos;s body will be transported to Rush Pet Cemetary where Pamela and I have a plot for our deceased animal friends, and he&apos;ll be cremated and interred. I guess I knew this day would come but I was hoping it wouldn&apos;t be for a long time. All I know is that this year has been pretty lousy for me with death and loss and I guess I&apos;ve just about had it. I&apos;m just glad that Snax never suffered, and when the vet administered the injection, he went down quickly and with no pain, and that&apos;s the best I could do for him. Goodbye, old friend; I love you and miss you.
Saturday was a good day to get my spirits back up, and I did that by attending Steve and Eileen Natarelli&apos;s annual Redneck Luau out at their beautiful home out at Williamson On The Lake. The Natarelli&apos;s put on a good spread, with a pig roast, d.j., and just an overall good time. Steve rents a port-a-john every year to accomodate the needs of his guests, and this year, the john had an actual copy of the Koran in it in case they ran out of the two-ply stuff. Pamela and Harmony came along, as they did last year, and I even brought comedy buddy Ray Salah out for the festivities, and we wound up doing some two-man shtick for some of the guests, some stuff we&apos;d been working on in the cardown and back from Tennessee. We also wrote some other material on the way out there and may be cultivating a two-man act to capitalize on the almost 20 years that we&apos;ve known each other and spent building a chemistry together onstage through the work with our improv troupe, The Inner Loop, but mostly just from being good friends and understanding how each other&apos;s minds work.
This week it&apos;s back to work, and Ray and I will be doing our thing at the House of Comedy in Niagara Falls, Canada at a new location, so I&apos;m excited about that. July&apos;s been a pretty light schedule and I&apos;m anxious to get working again on a more regular clip.
I hope you&apos;re enjoying your summer, gentle reader, and if you feel that forces are aligning against you, like you had your pay cut for no reason or you can&apos;t help but feel like someone&apos;s out to get you, remember the words of the 23rd Psalm; &quot;You prepare a table for me in the presence of mine enemies, you annoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.&quot;
God is in the heavens and all is right, Hallelujah!

It&apos;s always nice to get a new club in under my belt, and when it&apos;s a headlining spot, that makes it all the sweeter.
I finished up the weekend at the South Street Comedy Club in Jackson, Tennessee, a town that sits halfway between Memphis and Nashville. I brought one Ray Salah along for the ride, and we had quite a time.
I rented a car as my family vehicle was in the shop...Hertz kindly provided a Jeep Wrangler, a gas-guzzling affair with windows that zipper up; not a very good choice for securing valuables on a road trip 900 miles away from home.
Ray and I hit the road around 8:30 on Thursday night, and I made the drive in one take, no dubs, with only two stops for gas (rentals start with a full tank). Friday was spent mostly sleeping and then preparing for the show at South Street, a late one going off at 9:30, which to my East-coast internal clock, was really 10:30. After 14 hours in the car, I could only manage three hours of sleep, and my set was good, but exhausting after the physical exertion I put my body through in the past day.
The highlight of the day, aside from the show, had to be our dinner at Ryan&apos;s, a buffet-style joint that&apos;s popular in the middle of the country. Ray is prematurely grey, as many men of Lebanese descent turn, and the lady at the cash register at Ryan&apos;s gave Ray the senior citizen&apos;s discount. When we discovered that at the table, examining the register receipt, Ray had mixed emotions; he was happy to have the discount, but just a little pissed that the cashier thought he was old. The food was good though, and we had a good laugh about it, and went back on Saturday for a replay. All-you-can-eat steak is a good sell, no matter who you are.
I used the hotel pool today, and I haven&apos;t been much of a swimmer in my adult life, and today I showed how out of shape and out of practice I am. I tried swimming the length of the pool underwater, and wound up getting a leg cramp. I have conditioning issues, that&apos;s for sure, but after the cramp subsided, it was nice to have some excercise and get a little sun. It was my driving leg, and that&apos;s the calf that gets all the work most of the time, so I was a little surprised that that was the one that gave out.
Next week is a week off at home with Pam and Harmony, and I&apos;m enjoying having some Summertime off and spending it with the wife and munchkin. I hope to take Harmony to Seabreeze or Darien Lake this week and win her a big stuffed animal in one of the game joints....I worked for three summers at Seabreeze and know the tricks to winning all the games. I hope no one recognizes me, that would spoil the fun! A little tip to all my faithful readers....if you&apos;re playing a game where you have to throw a beanbag, let someone short do it, or get down on your knees when you throw...you can&apos;t throw straight or at a downward angle and get the bottles off the pedestal, but a little kid can do it. The problem is, no one ever lets the kid throw the beanbag, because they automatically assume the kid can&apos;t do it.
So tomorrow it&apos;s another 14 hours drive home, but that&apos;s what comedy is all about. I made some new friends, broke open a new room, and got a couple of new shows on tape. I wrote some new material, and got to spend time with one of my oldest friends and you can&apos;t put a value on that.
See you at NFL training camp, where I&apos;ll be the one with the taped-up leg and sitting on my helmet.

 Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra) 
Posted on 07/13/2007 at 10:44 PM
Enjoying a little Summer break at home with the wife and daughter, I decided to add another blog. It&apos;s been 11 days since my last one (according to no less than a few adoring readers), so I guess I owe you all one.
When last I wrote, I mentioned that I would possibly detail all of the new changes at the Comix Cafe, my home club in Rochester, NY, and how I thought these changes would lead to the demise of the club. Well, I have deliberated on this for quite some time, and I decided that facts speak for themselves, so I&apos;ll just lay the facts that I know, and I&apos;ll let my opinions fill in the blanks.
I headlined the Comix Cafe from Thursday, July 5th through Sunday, July 8th. In the months prior to the booking, I received three itineraries listing the showtimes, location, etc, and most importantly, my pay for the week. The first itinerary showed us performing on Wednesday, July 4th, a holiday. The second itinerary showed a removal of the Wednesday show, and my pay went down accordingly. I have no problem with this.
Then a third itinerary was issued, and the pay went down again. I spoke with a comedy buddy who had headlined the club within the previous few weeks, and he concurred that the pay had indeed went down. I was having my pay cut for no other reason than the whim of the club.
Well, there&apos;s no written contract, you&apos;re basically an employee at will at that point, and your choice is to either take the reduced pay, or allow yourself to be righteously indignant and be replaced. I decided in favor of my wife and child, and took the reduced pay, because they cannot sustain themselves on my righteous indignation.
I had requested a feature act, Laura Lu, formerly of the Detroit area, and Laura was replaced (or to be honest, never scheduled to begin with) by Annette Lorenzo, who I understand is the new &quot;financial advisor&quot; for the Comix Cafe. To me, new manager means another managerial paycheck, so I have my suspicions as to where my cut in pay was reallocated.
As the new Financial Advisor, Annette has put some new rules into place. For the first rule, comics no longer get subsidized food and drinks at the club. That&apos;s not a big deal for me, as I live in Rochester and I can shop and cook for myself when I&apos;m home, also I don&apos;t drink alcohol anymore because of medical concerns and health. But it&apos;s pretty chintzy to take that benefit away from out-of-town acts, especially in the light of their pay being cut. I consider it niggardly and cheap.
When I worked for Ed Bebko, the founder of the Comix Cafe with his partner Rob Lederman, Ed explained it to me; comics are an underpaid lot to begin with, and many of them roll into town without a dollar to their names. The clubs pay them the smallest amount they can get away with, which is a business decision, not an idictment of talent or ability. Given that, Ed would say, the least we could do is feed the poor bastards. We would give them a $45 stipend a week for food and beverage, and anything over that amount, they would be expected to pay for themselves. Over a five day period, that would allow each comic $9 a day to feed themselves, and soft drinks were no charge, as they are ridiculously inexpensive to begin with. And that $9 worth of food isn&apos;t even $9, it&apos;s more like $3 when the actual cost is counted and retail markup is eliminated. So the decision to eliminate that benefit to comedians costs the club $3 a day, times two comics, times five days...$30 a week. If the club is so desperate that $30 a week, levied on the backs of the performers, will bail them out of dire straits, then I would predict it is a club that is faltering closely towards closing, wouldn&apos;t you agree?
Annette supposedly maintains, if reports I hear are true, that &quot;No club in the country provides food benefits to comedians,&quot; and that means that all the clubs I&apos;ve been playing, that provide meals to their out-of-town comics at either complimentary or reduced costs, are hallucinations of my fevered imagination. And while I don&apos;t want to pat myself on the back, I feel I&apos;ve worked more clubs than Annette, which is to say, more than the one that I know currently has any use for her. The industry standard seems to be one that allows the comics at least the same food deduction offered to the restaurant staff, which ranges anywhere from a 15% discount to free. The Comedy Zone in Jacksonville, Florida is particularly generous, offering a 25% discount on top of a $30 gift card for the week, meaning that food is discounted, then comped, and anything you spend over $30 is discounted as well. At Dr. Grins in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the comics receive a 25% break on foods and beverages. In Battle Creek, Michigan, Gary Fields would rather break off one of his own fingers before he charged me for a hamburger, he&apos;d be so insulted. The Cleveland Improv offers a meal every night you&apos;re working, and soft drinks are always no charge. And at the Laugh In Comedy Cafe in Fort Myers, Florida, Joe Galanis treats the comics to a meal on him on Thursday, and then on the weekend, a discount goes into place. Every club is different, and offers what they think is fair, but they almost always offer something.
Ready for more? There&apos;s a box of bagged snacks in the bar, the kind of snacks that you can buy at a supermarket or wholesale club and throw a small portion of chips or chee*tos into your kids&apos; lunchbox, the kind that retail (RETAIL!) for about a quarter a bag, if that. Annette has them in the bar selling for a buck each. And I counted them each night I performed, and they haven&apos;t sold not a one. Part of that reason, I think, is that the bags sit in the box, tops up, and the box is leaned over at an angle, meaning you can see the colors of the bags, but not read the brand names of the snacks. Some of the staff, I heard, wanted to get a rack to help display the snacks, but Annette ranted that they were fine the way they were.
Well, in my opinion, they&apos;re not fine. The Comix Cafe is a paper house. In the business, that means that they give away the door, offering free tickets for non-special shows, in the interest of selling food and beverage to their clients. Comix Cafe offers a full menu. In the years past when I served as a manager at the Cafe, I asked Ed about snacks in the bar, and his exact words were &quot;Why should we compete against ourselves?&quot; The wisdom was correct then and it&apos;s correct now, but no one is wise enough (no pun intended) to eliminate the chips in the bar (actually, that&apos;s a great fucking pun, and I will let it stand). Even if the whole box sold out every week, that&apos;s another 50 bucks in the register, minus the cost of the chips. Not exactly high finance, eh?
How about this one, then? There is a server at the Cafe, and her name is Petra. Petra is a cute girl, and she&apos;s been there for a while. I heard that Annettespecifically forbade Petra to wait on a stage-side section the week that she was featuring at the Cafe, because Petra makes her look ugly by comparison. I won&apos;t even go into this in detail, because it smacks of discrimination, and frankly, it&apos;s an issue for the attorneys to discuss. Petra told me that she was not told that specifically, but through management, and of course, no one is going to freely admit to making those statements, as they are actionable in a court of law. The front sections of a comedy club are the first sections to be seated and are the sections where a server can make the best money, especially when the servers in a comedy club face the extra challenge not confronted by their conventional restaurant service peers; unlike a regular, family-style restaurant, a comedy club server&apos;s section only gets seated once per show. Their grubstake, their ability to make an income, is rooted solely in what they can farm out of their section, and when the show&apos;s over, what they got is what they get. Front section people are the folks who arrive early, order dinners, and drink throughout the show. Back section folks arrive later, and maybe have a few drinks, and then disappear into the night. The club tries it&apos;s best to rotate servers through these sections in an attempt to make an equitable run at offering servers the same opportunities to make money, but I guess under the new Financial Advisor&apos;s rules, you aren&apos;t allowed to make a decent living if you&apos;re too pretty.
As a performer, Annette has pretty much become an &quot;in-joke&quot; with all the bookers I work with and speak to. She currently doesn&apos;t work the road and has irritated many bookers to the point where they won&apos;t even take her calls anymore, much less put her into any of the rooms they book. Annette&apos;s major fault is impatience. Building an act, and a rapport with the audience, is a skill that takes time, and nothing but time. Through no fault of her own, she was introduced to the road early, and now has a differing opinion of her skills and talents that other, nonobjective parties do. Nonetheless, she has found nothing but dead ends in her attempts to get booked, and now has found a vulnerable partner in the Comix Cafe.
Annette used her position as tax preparer and financial advisor to become my middle act this past week. All but two of the shows were unwatchable, and I think after Friday&apos;s lateshow, if she didn&apos;t leave the building in tears, she is in more self-denial than I can even describe. As she left the stage after her Friday late show set, she walked past me and said &quot;good luck,&quot; and I said &quot;thanks, I think I&apos;ll be o.k.&quot; and got an applause break within the first minute. I&apos;ve only worked 19 years to develop that skill, and when I take a booking, I feel it&apos;s because I&apos;ve earned it, not because I&apos;ve done someone a favor in another resepect and I deserve something in return. She&apos;s loud, caustic, and picks on people in the audience for no reason. She comes off as very unlikeable, and wonders why she&apos;s not getting the response she thinks she deserves. Tape your set, Annette, and play it back at normal volume. You&apos;ll want to stab your eardrums out with steak knives, if you&apos;re not already completely deaf.
The latest rumour running around the grapevine is that Annette is putting the kibosh on any out-of-state feature acts at the club. This is going to open opportunities for some New York City folk, but probably not the New York City comics that should be getting the look; it&apos;s most likely a clique of comics at Annette&apos;s level and the whole thing is a &quot;gig-trading&quot; scheme whereby you book me and I&apos;ll book you.
Normally, I wouldn&apos;t care what kind of machinations the club would deem worthy to participate in, but this is a policy that is going to directly affect the comics from Rochester who work elsewhere. Our good names are going to be besmirched because comics from Michigan or Ohio or anywhere else can no longer perform in Rochester. Would comics, who suddenly find themselves blackballed in Rochester for no other reason than their place of residence, be wrong if they went back to their home clubs and expressed some dismay? Would those clubs be wrong if they started treating Rochester comics like pariahs in return?
I say no, and sadly so; that one comic who finds herself painted into a corner by her impatience and arrogance would cause other hard-working comics to be shaded in such a way would be unconscionable, unchampionable, and evil.
One of the more interesting exchanges that Annette and I had this week concerned a post I wrote on Roadcomics.com about a sitcom based on a comedy club. I wrote that the first character I would write would be the &quot;damaged female&quot; that most comedy clubs seem to have, who has gone through a divorce, bad life or whatever, and becomes like the mother to the waitstaff. In her arrogance and paranoia, Annette actually thought I was writing about her, forgetting that I have 19 years in the business to draw upon and reference. Every club in Rochester for the last two decades (wait, let me list them....Yuks Yuk&apos;s, Funnybone, Zinger&apos;s, Hiccup&apos;s, Comix Cafe) has had one female working in it that was the mother hen to the waitstaff, and the day I call Annette the waitstaff&apos;s mother at the Comix Cafe is the day I eat my keyboard...not only is she not the waitstaff&apos;s mother, they fucking hate her.
Will this blog arouse Annette&apos;s rage? Absolutely. Moreso because the allegations are true and irrefutable than any sort of wrongdoing on my part. In a previous blog, I intimated the details of Annette&apos;s misbehavior at a gig booked by Mike Dambra, and related that my statement to her, when she asked me &quot;You&apos;re headlining, take me with you as your feature,&quot; I replied &quot;Not until you make things right with Mike Dambra.&quot;
This refusal lead to a potchkeyed response letter, supposedly penned by Annette&apos;s boyfriend Charles, promising a boycott of Mike&apos;s North American tour and other hollow threats. If you would like to read the letter, and Mike&apos;s response, they are posted at www.myspace.com/picklesplace under the title &quot;I&apos;m a raciest!&quot; which is &quot;racist&quot; mispelled.
Regardless, Annette has it in her mind that Mike and I have somehow blackballed her from comedy, which is as far from the truth as could be. In real life, neither of us are willing to put our professional standings on the line and reccommend her for comedy work or take her in a supporting role, and that is somehow interpreted as being &quot;blackballed.&quot; It is a paranoid way to look at things, an arrogant and selfish way, born of the statement &quot;I want&quot; and in no way respectful of the statement &quot;I deserve&quot; or &quot;I earned.&quot;
You make your bed and you sleep in it, I say. And God forbid the club one day closes and you have no bargaining chip with which to work, and you find yourself and your numbers, cold and alone, your dreams shattered on the rocks of your own ego and pride.

P.S. Oh, and did I mention that the &quot;Funniest Woman in Rochester&quot; contest was fixed? Two seperate judges told me that they were told they could vote for any of the four finalists, as long as they voted for Annette. So now she has a credit to hang her hat on. Now all she has to do is get a hat.

 With Teeth (Nine Inch Nails) 
Posted on 07/03/2007 at 11:32 AM
Wow, I&apos;m back home from the big Florida tour and frankly, I don&apos;t even know how I made it.
The weekend at the Laugh-In Comedy Cafe was great, and we had decent shows despite rainy weather and an early week wildfire that threatened nearby Cape Coral, Florida.
The weekend was not without it&apos;s &quot;comedy moments,&quot; those little episodes that seem like they could only happen around a comedy club; why there&apos;s never been a sitcom about a comedy club, I&apos;ll never know. Anyway, my favorite moment was called &quot;The Case of the Missing Teeth.&quot;
I was at a merchadise table outside the club when an elderly couple came out of the club, fixing to call it a night. It was first show Friday, and Al Romero, the headliner, was still on stage. The couple smiled and shook my hand, told me they enjoyed the evening, and then headed to their car. A few minutes later, the gentlemen, clearly perturbed, came back and spoke to one of the security guys. It seems his wife had lost her lower set of dentures and thought she might have left them in the club.
The security guy disappeared back into the club and the gentleman began to speak to me, venting about his wife and how stupid it is to lose your teeth, and that she must have left them wherever her brains got lost to, and things of that nature. Then he pointed to my CD&apos;s and asked me how much my &quot;tapes&quot; were. I ignored the irony and sold him a couple. Then the wife appears and starts asking me for help, and I have to explain that I&apos;m the comic, I don&apos;t have access to the kitchen or the lost and found, or wherever her teeth might have toddled off to.
As she&apos;s walking away, I notice a semi-circular bulge in her front shirt pocket.
Are you with me? I grab the husband and tell him, &quot;Check her shirt pocket.&quot;
He grabs her, spins her around, and reaches into the pocket, and lo and behold, voila, the TEETH!
&quot;Here&apos;s your teeth, DUMMY!&quot; he says, clearly frustrated, embarassed and wanting to get home with his very drunk wife.
Now, I&apos;m not for public humiliation and name-calling, but the woman was very drunk...she was doing that drunk crab-walk where you&apos;re moving but not going forward, just scuttling side-to-side.
The rest of the weekend was uneventful compared to this. I split the drive up from Florida to Rochester in two chunks, doing half the trip on Sunday and stopping over in Wytheville, Virginia, and finishing the trip home yesterday. It seems like some sort of a dream that I made it home through thunderstorms, traffic backed up due to traffic accidents, negotiating scores of police cars taking advantage of one of two July 4th weekends this year, and gasoline prices that fluctuated anywhere between 2.69 (Virginia) and 3.11 (New York and Pennsylvania) per gallon.
Tonight, it&apos;s back to work at the open mic at Comix Cafe, and maybe tomorrow I&apos;ll gather my thoughts and start detailing the events that are unfolding at the club that in my estimation, as a seasoned comedy club professional, will certainly kill the club just as dead as it&apos;s late, lamented predecessor in Buffalo.
Stay tuned.

 For The Movies (Buckcherry)

Where does the time go?
I&apos;m in Fort Myers, Florida, at the beautiful Crowne Plaza hotel, my home-away-from-home provided me by the Laugh In Comedy Cafe. Just thought I&apos;d pop a little update in before my radio call-in to WCMF back home in Rochester.
Sunday at Howl At The Moon in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, was great, I worked with Kris Shaw from Indianapolis, Indiana, who I&apos;d communicated with online but never worked with before. The Howl crowd was packed, and there was a youngster named Dennis Hooten who got up and warmed up the crowd before I took the stage. He had only been on stage twice before, so he was as new as new could be, but he did a fine job. I had an above-average show, pumped up from the events of the day which I will not go in to, but I will only say check the paper supply before you do anything in a McDonald&apos;s bathroom, and what am I going to do with my one remaining white tube sock? I promised myself I wouldn&apos;t tell this story, but I opened with it on stage at Howl, so I guess I&apos;m not keeping any secrets here.
My last few days with my mother were good, I helped her paint a cabinet that she&apos;d had the supplies for but kept putting off (over a year, by the date on the receipt in the bag with the brushes, stir sticks, etc.) and on Wednesday, I went and saw the Fantastic Four movie with a friend of my mom&apos;s who also collects comics and wanted to see it. It wasn&apos;t great, but it was better than the first film. I gave it a 7, whereas I gave the first film a 4. If you really want my full review, write me and I&apos;ll break it down.
Packing was a bummer, and I got on the road yesterday bright &apos;n&apos; early, but a 4-hour car ride turned into almost 6 courtesy of an accident on I-75 that sent me detoured to the west. Also, Fort Myers is currently on fire, actually, Cape Coral, Florida to our Northwest, and that has traffic diverted in places. Fun, fun fun!
I wound up headlining the Laugh In last night as the headliner wasn&apos;t scheduled to come in until today...must be nice being a big star. His name is Al Romero, and I&apos;ve never met him but heard good things. Anyway, I rocked out a 40-minute set and got a good response....the manager of the club actually asked me how much time I had....I do 40 when I&apos;m supposed to do 30 all the time! Not that that&apos;s a good thing....
Today I&apos;m probably going to catch the Michael Moore film &quot;Sicko.&quot; There&apos;s a movie theater in the same plaza as the hotel I&apos;m staying in, so it&apos;s a short walk. That ought to get me fired up, I think....the movie *and* the walk.
Two more days and I hit the trail to head home, and I would be lying if I said I&apos;m not dreading the 1,500 mile drive, which I&apos;ll split up into two days worth, but I would also be lying if I said I&apos;m not looking forward to seeing Pam and Harmony again after a long month away. Also, I&apos;m looking forward to a full week of headlining at my home club, where I&apos;m going to be taping my first full-length CD, &quot;Tetta-fensive.&quot; I&apos;m pretty excited about that.
I&apos;ll check in again before the weekend&apos;s up. Have a good one!

 Army (Ben Folds Five) 
Posted on 06/24/2007 at 01:36 PM
Well, the gig I worried about all week has come and gone, two shows in Palm Harbor, Florida at the Comedy Zone. I did a radio call-in on Thursday and got the news that the club was cutting down to one show a night (not good) and was in a new location (not good) because the old place was in bad repair and the landlord wouldn&apos;t fix the roof which leaked and Florida is in their rainy hurricane season (not good). I was worried that we weren&apos;t going to have very good shows, and I was going to be sent away with a check instead of cash, and as I sent all my money home to Pamela so she could maintain our household, I would be strapped for cash to get to my next job. Happily, the shows were decent, I moved some product and the club paid me half in cash, half in a check. It turned out not to be such a nightmare after all.
I&apos;m up early for the longest drive of the tour so far, a 6 1/2 hour drive to Fort Walton Beach, home of Howl At The Moon (the dueling piano bar) and home of Fort Walton Beach&apos;s Comedy Zone. I&apos;m not sure I remember correctly, but I think it&apos;s far enough up the panhandle that I actually pick up an hour, but I&apos;m not taking any chances and hitting the road early. Howl is a pretty good gig, well attended and a lot of fun, it&apos;s just so damn far off the beaten path I was a little reluctant to do it, but I&apos;ll net some cash after the gas cost, and it&apos;s another chance on stage, so what the hell.
I woke up with an interesting memory, and had to go back in my journal to see if I had mentioned it, and I saw that I hadn&apos;t and I feel like I wanted to share this. At the start of the tour, I did the Comedy Zone&apos;s gig in Columbus, Georgia. Columbus is an Army town, the home of Fort Benning, and when I checked into the hotel, I noticed that a large number of the guests were from someplace else, and I couldn&apos;t place their language or tell by their physical attributes where they might be from. Honestly, they could have been Middle Eastern, Greek or some kind of Eastern European.
Anyhow, they were nice enough, and at night, they were outside cooking on a charcoal grill and drinking beer inthe hotel parking lot, so they were all right by me. When I checked out of the hotel the next morning, I was heading toward the elevator with my many bags of crap, including a large black duffle bag that has seen better days, slung over my shoulder. An older man, part of the foreign group said to me, &quot;Are you ready to go?&quot; At first I thought he might be a member of the housekeeping staff asking me if I was ready to check out, then I thought no, he&apos;s a guest, maybe he thinks I&apos;m part of his group. I told him I was heading for the elevator, and he says, &quot;No, are you ready to go to Iraq?&quot;
Now, I don&apos;t know what the physical specifications are for the military in his country, whichever that is, but I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d be rejected as 4F in any country that knows what a Body Mass Index is. I guess I must have thrown him off with the duffel bag and fresh haircut which made him think, &quot;A-ha, MILITARY!&quot; Anyway, that was a funny little happenstance that I wanted to pass along. My touring life isn&apos;t exactly chock-full of stories, so I appreciate them when they come along.
I can&apos;t wait to get home, but I have another nine days and I feel like they&apos;ll pass pretty quickly. I&apos;ll keep you posted.

 Bittersweet (Big Head Todd and the Monsters) 
Posted on 06/22/2007 at 05:19 PM
Rapidly reaching the end of my annual Florida comedy tour, I picked up another show; Sunday night in Fort Walton Beach, Florida at Howl At The Moon.
It&apos;s not a big dollar gig and it&apos;s probably out of my way, but after five days off, I&apos;ve gotten restless. Comedy Zone was happy to oblige, and on short notice, I was probably the answer to a few headaches when I said &quot;yes.&quot;
So yesterday I continued on with the business of being a working comic; talking on the phone, mostly to folks about the demise of the Buffalo Comix Cafe, which went out of business after almost 20 years of bringing the funny to the Queen City. I did a radio interview by phone to promote the gig in Palm Harbor, Florida, tonight and tomorrow. I fretted about it all day, and it turned out to be really nothing, about five minutes of shtick and the jocks were really nice about it, setting me up and letting me prattle on.
Afterwards, my mother and I went out and met some friends and I took a night off from being a comic to do KARAOKE! We met her friend Rick and his mother, and another lady named Betty, and they all live in the Mid Florida Lakes community where my mom is.
Now, my mom is an above-average singer, but she likes to do the bluesy, Rosemary Clooney stuff, which is cool; I like to do the type of songs that we called &quot;Oh Wow&quot; selections when I worked in radio...songs a lot of people know but haven&apos;t heard in a while.
They were running a contest at this particular bar, and I submitted a song to sing, just to sing, not to be in the contest. They put me on after the last contestant as a buffer because they were going to ask all the contestants to sing another song. I did a song by Big Head Todd and the Monsters called &quot;Bittersweet,&quot; a poppy ballad from a band who&apos;s glory days have pretty much come and gone with the H.O.R.D.E. tour and the time when bands like Blues Traveller and the Spin Doctors roamed the earth. I&apos;d never sung the song before, but I like to stretch when I do karaoke, and I thought the song would go over pretty well with the group that had so far been leaning VERY country.
So I got up on the mike and started talking to the crowd, explaining that I&apos;d never sung the song before and asking them for their patience, and the jock asked me if I was a D.J. and I explained that no, I was a comedian and I had a night off from the tour. She seemed to hint that she might have work for me this weekend, but I explained that the tour picked up again and that I wasn&apos;t available, but thank you. I think the lesson to be learned here is that you should always try to get out and get some kind of stage time somewhere, especially on your nights off, because you can never be sure what might come of it.
So I sang the song, and I missed a couple of the high notes and I went back and forth with my mom and her friends at our table in the back of the room, and sang as best I could, and probably scored maybe a 7 on a 10 scale....not my best, but pretty much better than anyone who saing that evening. Next thing I know, the D.J. and her partner have entered me in the contest, and they want me to sing another song, too, but I explain that I&apos;m just visiting and really wouldn&apos;t be around for their finals so it made no sense to participate. There was a $500 cash prize to be had, so I was disappointed, but flattered that they enjoyed my performance.
So the four contestants went back up and sang, and honestly, most of them were just horrible...one older woman sang &quot;8 Days A Week&quot; and it sounded so bad, I turned to my mother and said &quot;The last time the Beatles sounded that bad, one of them was getting shot outside his apartment building.&quot; It was really awful. Betty sang &quot;My Way,&quot; and she really brought it home for a lady who just turned 80 years old.
I got called back to the stage, and I sang an old favorite of mine, &quot;We Just Disagree&quot; by Dave Mason. I&apos;d sung the song before, it&apos;s pretty easy and within range, and I sing it in my voice instead of trying to do an impression of Dave Mason. It&apos;s a good song, and it really seemed to strike a chord in the room, because I saw a lot of smiling faces and at least a couple of folks were singing along. It was pretty neat.
After a little happy chat about incorporating music into my standup routine, we broke camp and headed home. I enjoyed the night off, but mostly I think I enjoyed the attention after five days without it, and I see myself a little more clearly now in what I need and why I do what I do.
So I peddle off to Palm Harbor in a little while, it&apos;s a very short trip today, about two hours in the car and then Sunday will be the nut-buster getting up to Fort Walton up on the panhandle, but I&apos;ll be happy to get on stage again.
Have a great weekend, and keep doing what you love because the money will follow!

 Cats In The Cradle (Harry Chapin) 
Posted on 06/17/2007 at 11:38 AM
Wrapping up the weekend here at the Comedy Zone in Jacksonville, Florida.
Well, it&apos;s Sunday, and I&apos;ve turned back into a pumpkin. After a fabulous week at the Jacksonville Comedy Zone, I&apos;m getting ready to shower up and head back to Leesburg to spend the better part of the week with my mom before I head to Palm Harbor, Florida and week four of my Summer in Florida tour.
It was a great week and I had a phenomenal time with all of the local comics and staff here in Jacksonville. There&apos;s a bar next door called the Monkey&apos;s Uncle that seems to be the defacto dumping ground for comics and friends who aren&apos;t willing to call it a night after the Zone closes up for the evening. I&apos;m not a drinker, so I had an O&apos;Doul&apos;s or two, and one night, they actually coaxed me into having a shot of Jim Beam (the glorious amber proof that God loves us as his children).
Thursday, I had dinner with Erica Simon, who used to work with me at the Comix Cafe in Rochester. We hung out, shared pictures and talked about the old gang, who we kept up with and what they were doing lately. She came out with a bunch of folks on the late show Saturday and afterwards, we all headed to the Ale House to rabble rouse until they threw us out at closing time (exactly one O&apos;Doul&apos;s and a Diet Coke later).
On Saturday, I sat in on the comedy workshop hosted by Fred Pozin, the General Manager of the Comedy Zone, and a really nice, laid back guy. I was invited by Billy B., our mc for the week, to come down and check it out, and I have a background in teaching standup comedy so I printed out copies of my class notes and brought them to the workshop. Fred got ahold of one of the copies, about a 14-page booklet, and after skimming through it, asked me if I wouldn&apos;t mind doing a presentation. Well, I thought he&apos;d never ask! I talked about 20 minutes and then answered questions for another 40, and then hung out as the fledgling comics took the stage and did their thing, but I only had time to see the first five, because I had other pressing matters to attend;comic books.
I found a comic book shop here in Jacksonville and they had back issues of Teen Titans Go!, a kid&apos;s title that my niece and nephew have taken a liking to. Usually comic books shops will take back issues and mark them up significantly, because as a book gets older, it becomes harder to find. This particular shop only marked the books up a quarter each, and that covered the price of the backer board and plastic bag they were in, so they were basically going at cover price. I had merchandise money from the night before, so I took a drive and scarfed up the issues and I&apos;ll get them in the mail for the kids on Monday. It&apos;s a little thing that I do to let my brother&apos;s kids know that I love them, even if I don&apos;t get to see them as often as I&apos;d like. When I was younger, my family wasn&apos;t close with my Mom&apos;s brother and his family, and while I&apos;d met my cousins, we haven&apos;t seen each other in 30 years, and I regret that. I don&apos;t want my niece and nephew to be denied the company of their aunt and uncle and cousin, and in lieu of that, I guess the comics are my way of &quot;keeping in touch.&quot;
When I got back to the hotel after spending time with Erica and her Jacksonville friends, I got a nice message on my room phone from Fred, thanking me for coming to Jacksonville and offering praise on my performance this weekend. I think that he may pitch me to come in and close a split week, one of those weeks where they get a &quot;big name&quot; headliner who only performs Friday and Saturday, and they need a comic to close the other nights, Tuesday through Thursday. This seems to be the industry standard, and I&apos;m certainly up to the task, and I need another pinch because it&apos;s just the next nice thing that&apos;s happened in a month that&apos;s going so well, I feel like I&apos;m dreaming.
Yesterday&apos;s only downer was talking to my daughter, Harmony, on the phone and having her say in her little, three-year-old girl voice &quot;I want you to come home!&quot; and then trying to explain that I was almost done working and I&apos;d be coming home in a few days (actually a couple of weeks), and then having her say, &quot;But I want you to COME HOME!&quot; Well, Happy Father&apos;s Day to me, because that just about broke my heart.
Yeah, it&apos;s all ice cream and lollipops when I&apos;m on stage, making the people laugh, and then afterwards, basking in the glow of their love and appreciation, signing autographs as they take their souvenir CD&apos;s and DVD&apos;s homewith them, but hardly anyone knows the pain that drives a road comic, the separation from family, the hotel rooms that all look the same, waking up and not remembering what city you&apos;re in, and the long, long, long drive home.
I&apos;m coming home, sweetie, in a couple of weeks. And you know we&apos;ll have a good time then.

 Wild Thing (Sam Kinison) 
Posted on 06/14/2007 at 12:50 PM
I&apos;ve got a full head of steam going now, people, if you&apos;ll forgive me the atrociously shopworn metaphor.
My prospecting for comedy work has yielded even more fruit today, as I nailed down a weekend&apos;s worth of work in the Garden State, glorious New Jersey, USA.
I&apos;ve never worked New Jersey, and never tried, either, figuring that comics from New York City and Philadelphia must have all of the gigs nailed down, not to mention my funny friends who actually reside in the land of Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and that Governor who told everyone he was gay at a press conference before he told his wife.
I&apos;m working a club called Uncle Vinnie&apos;s in Point Pleasant, just a short drive down the coast from Asbury Park. I&apos;m headlining two shows, one on Friday November 9th, and one on Saturday, November 10th. I don&apos;t have the details yet, but details are to be had here (NJ Comedy Club - Uncle Vinnie&apos;s Comedy Club at Ferrara&apos;s Ristorante) and if the site you&apos;re viewing doesn&apos;t allow the hyperlink, the URL is http://www.unclevinniescomedyclub.com/ and I really need to learn how to post this sort of thing; pictures, too.
So I&apos;m fulfilling a few comedy dreams here...I&apos;m finally being recognized as a comic who can be trusted to close a show, I&apos;m working New Jersey which I&apos;ve never worked before, and I&apos;m closer to my goal of performing in all 50 states. Plus I&apos;m making a little bit more money than usual, and I&apos;m working closer to home. Things are on the ups, and I couldn&apos;t be more giddy.
This week, I&apos;m in Jacksonville, Florida, featuring for Jimmy Shubert ( The Official Website of Comedian, Jimmy Shubert ) at the Comedy Zone in the Ramada Inn. Now, this is quite an amazing thing for me, because I saw Jimmy Shubert on the Sam Kinison Outlaws of Comedy Tour way back in the late 80&apos;s, and I had just started doing comedy at that point and came out of the show so mesmerized that I was sure I would do comedy the rest of my life. Well, here I am, the rest of my life later, and I&apos;m sharing the stage with Jimmy and he&apos;s been nothing but nice to me, complimenting my work and I&apos;m so infused with energy and I&apos;m falling in love with being a comic again.
My act has always ranged from edgy to blue, and working with Jimmy, it&apos;s almost like the perfect compliment. Just when I thought I couldn&apos;t push the envelope any more, Jimmy ups the ante and leaves the room gasping for breath, they&apos;re laughing so hard. Jacksonville&apos;s a little rednecky, but for the most part, they&apos;re digging the show. It&apos;s a great week so far.
I&apos;ve got another show tonight, one tomorrow, and then two on Saturday. This is a pretty long week for me, but the pay is good, the hotel is excellent, and the perks are great, too. There&apos;s a complimentary hot breakfast buffet in the morning and a great dinner buffet at night, and at check-in, they gave us gift cards to use at the restaurant, and there&apos;s a 25% break on dinner for the comics to begin with. Except for tips, I haven&apos;t had to dig into my pocket once. The club is right in the Ramada Inn, so I walk to the show and back home, and one of these afternoons, I&apos;m going to use the pool or the workout room.
O.K., I gotta go back to living the dream. Catch ya later.

 Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos; (Journey) 
Posted on 06/11/2007 at 06:52 PM
The common thread that all volumes of self-help or success literature I&apos;ve read contain is boiled down into the Nike slogan &quot;Just Do It.&quot;
I came to this epiphany in the bargain barn of the Goodwill store in Englewood, Florida, this past weekend, hanging around with my buddy Ricky Kingston. More on this later.
Ricky started out in comedy around the same time as I did, back in the late 80&apos;s when we were in our 20&apos;s and full of starry-eyed comedy dreams. Now we&apos;re both long in the tooth and I&apos;m living the road comic&apos;s dream and Ricky is self-employed, pursuing various fields such as graphic arts and a new endeavor, a cat shelter (www.puffypawskittyhaven.com). Our common bond is that we realized a long time ago that we couldn&apos;t work for anyone else, and that we had to be the captains of our fate(s).
I was working this weekend in Port Charlotte, Florida, a stone&apos;s throw (if you have a surface-to-air missile to throw the stone) from Tampa. Englewood is just up the road a bit, and it allowed me to visit my friend and also for him to come out and support me for the Friday late show.
Even though Rick has refocused his energies away from standup comedy, he&apos;s still quite the funny guy and he even wrote a few lines in my act. Friday night, I spent a lot of time working with the audience and didn&apos;t get a chance to do the bit, even though the author was in the room. Ricky, I publicly apologize; I was &quot;in the moment&quot; and wandered away from my script.
The Comedy Zone in Port Charlotte is located in an Italian restaurant called Visani, which looks like two Guineas built a castle in a swamp. The club is beautiful, though, and the early shows were well-attended, and even the late shows, though sparse, didn&apos;t suck at all. The food is as fresh as you could possibly imagine, and the proprietors, Mark and Sela Asciutto, are as hospitable as they could have been, buying dinner for the comics each night and being just the nicest people in the world. Their staff are also very nice, and being as the club is only about a year old, I expect thatit will only be a matter of time before they become jaded comedy club veterans and start telling the comics to get the hell out of their face. Actually, I couldn&apos;t imagine that happening, and I hope it doesn&apos;t....they are all such very nice people.
I worked with headliner Ken Evans, himself a very nice man and a good comic to share the bill with. The club preferred that we keep the shows to the cleaner side, respective to language, at least for the early shows, and Ken and I obliged, and even though I&apos;d never seen him before, I could tell where he was editing, just as I&apos;m sure he could tell where I was editing. The average age of the club patrons was in the 50&apos;s or 60&apos;s, and they all seemed to enjoy us regardless, so who cares if the occasional line came out clunky?
So anyway, Ricky knows that I sell books online as a hobby, and he took me to the Goodwill in Englewood, where we visited their &quot;bargain barn,&quot; a place where merchandise was being cleared out at rock bottom prices. I bought about 10 dollars worth of books, which I&apos;ve started reselling on the internet, and I&apos;ve already doubled that amount in just a few sales. Ricky was pointing out some self-help literature and he asked me if that sort of thing sold very well . I replied that no, it didn&apos;t, and that my opinion was that all self-help literature basically said the same thing; keep going after your goal until you get it. Ignore the people who say no, ignore the failures, just keep trying. There wouldn&apos;t be much of a market for success literature if everyone knew that simple truth and internalized it.
Case in point, yours truly...I would be much more successful in my standup comedy endeavors if I asked enough booking agents to headline me instead of just being satisfied with feature money, which is usually about half. I don&apos;t usually ask to close because I&apos;m not interested in hearing the answer &quot;No.&quot; I also don&apos;t want a booker to stop offering me feature work because they think I won&apos;t be satisfied unless I&apos;m headlining. It&apos;s that old saying that half a loaf is better than no bread at all.
Well, my fears have been getting in the way long enough, and today, I asked a booker point-blank that I wanted to close, and I named a specific club that I did very well at last year. To my surprise, he started rifling off dates that were available, and said in fact, yes, he would be happy to close me in that room.
Now, before you get the ticker-tape parade going for me, I must include the fact that none of the dates worked for me in my routing, and I wasn&apos;t able to take the work. But the simple fact that I asked to close and the booker said &quot;Yes&quot; was enough to boost my confidence so that the next booker I happen to speak with is going to be dealing with a very different Ralph Tetta. I&apos;m ready to close, I do close for a small amount of bookers, and I&apos;m going to start taking an active role in moving up.
Now, am I going to say no to feature work if it&apos;s offered in the future? Absolutely not, at least until I tip the scales from mostly featuring to mostly headlining, at which point I&apos;ll be very selective about the middle work that I take, whether it be a club that I particularly like, an engagement that&apos;s very close to home, or warming up for a big name headliner.
I didn&apos;t put any work on the books today, but I got a &quot;yes.&quot; And that&apos;s worth a lot more than a week of work, I can tell you.
I did take advantage of my red-hot streak, though, and got a few good leads for some of the final open weeks in my summer. If the week in August finally gets filled, then I&apos;m looking at November before I have any more open weeks to consider, and that&apos;s a very good feeling. If I may offer another lesson to any fledgling comic who wishes to take heed, when you call a booker, ask them for one very specific thing, and most of the time, they&apos;ll give it to you just to be able to get you off the phone quickly. Bookers deal with hundreds of comics, all calling them looking for work, and if you can make their job as simple as possible, they will appreciate it and reward you with the booking you ask for. I was able to do this last week very effectively by asking for a specific club date, and nailed it down for December, the week before Christmas. I was very pleased at how well my system is working.
As I draw this blog to a close, I wish you well, my reader and friend, and remind you that your goals are only as close as your grasp. If you want something, keep reaching and eventually you will get it. But if you decide that it&apos;s just too difficult, and stop reaching, you will guarantee that you will always draw back an empty hand.

 Everybody Wants To Rule The World (Tears For Fears) 
Posted on 06/07/2007 at 12:03 AM
Well, it&apos;s Day 9 of my Florida tour and Day 6 of my time off until my next engagement. I&apos;ve been staying with my mother in the exotic Mid Florida Lakes community here in Leesburg, Florida, and when I say exotic, it&apos;s only because the local animals may take it upon themselves to join you in your house. Just a couple of hours ago, I was heading to the bathroom to enjoy a magazine (*coff* *coff*) and a gecko lizard scurried up the wall and ran behind a shelving unit. Let me be the first to say he didn&apos;t necessarily scare the crap out of me, but wouldn&apos;t that have been apropos?
Keeping up on current events has been dificult down here, as my mother doesn&apos;t see the need for television or newspapers; she&apos;s never been what you call a new junkie, and I always have been. You can&apos;t even get local channels down here on the TV with an antennae, because the houses all have metal frames and it interferes with the broadcast signal....I found that out the hard way, after purchasing the equipment and attempting to hook it up. Consequently, I missed both the Democratic and Republican debates of the past week, and had to piece things together after the fact by reading the Huffington Post, which isn&apos;t the way I prefer to get my hard news.
One thing I can say for certain, it seems that regardless of what side of the aisle you&apos;re on, there isn&apos;t a man, woman or child in the United States outside of Crawford, Texas or Kennebunkport, Maine, who can&apos;t wait for George W. to take that last walk to Air Force One. The Republicans have been going out of their way to criticize the President, and the Democrats are playing the &quot;I Told You So&quot; game. Both are very entertaining to me, but I want red meat and not just bread....I&apos;m waiting for the dust to settle and for two clear candidates to start revving up against each other in the final battle for the Oval Office.
I don&apos;t know what to think about Hillary Clinton. She seems to have the fundraising behind her, but I also don&apos;t think she&apos;s electable. Conservatives who hated Bill certainly won&apos;t rally around her, and I think she basically wants to be President way too much. I don&apos;t know if I trust anyone who wants it that badly. Could she be President? I wouldn&apos;t be against it, because I like her stance on children&apos;s issues and the importance of domestic issues, and I like the idea that Bill would be there as a resource (Ambassador Clinton? Secretary of State?) and you don&apos;t get better than a two-term Presidential success story like that. Still, I don&apos;t think any voters south of Virginia would be willing to take a chance on her.
I won&apos;t even talk about Barack Obama because I don&apos;t know all that much about him. I know he writes a nice book, and speaks from his heart, but he says the things that people don&apos;t want to hear, even if it&apos;s for their own good. He has everything in the package to be a black John F. Kennedy, except for the privileged background. I really want to know what America thinks about the idea of a black man leading our nation....we can&apos;t get three black head coaches in the NFL, what are the chances of us getting a black President?
No one&apos;s talking about Bill Richardson, Governor of New Mexico. He&apos;s Hispanic, well-versed in foreign policy, and he would probably be spot-on in the areas of immigration and the Iraq war. As such, he&apos;s probably over-qualified for the job. Every time I&apos;ve heard him speak, he&apos;s been amiable, friendly and down-to-earth. I would like to see him win the nomination just to see 45 million Hispanic-Americans come out of the woodwork and vote and defeat the Republican candidate by a Reagan-esque landslide.
John Edwards is shaping up to be a non-entity in the race. I don&apos;t think you come off a losing ticket and all of a sudden become a player in the race again. His strategy right now is to be everyone&apos;s second choice, which means he&apos;s basically abdicated to Hillary and Obama. How about we have a candidate who is at least *someone&apos;s* first choice?
Joe Biden is a little long in the tooth and he comes from Delaware, not really a hotbed of influence....he&apos;s probably too &quot;Northern&quot; to have a chance, anyway. Dennis Kucinich, Chris Dodd and Mike Gravel have about a Sharpton&apos;s chance of lasting until this time three months from now, so watch them shrivel as the funds dry up.
Will Al Gore run? It&apos;s the question everyone&apos;s asking, and you have to just look at the smile on the man&apos;s face that he&apos;s not in the middle of a White House shitstorm anymore, and ask yourself, &quot;Does he even *want* to?&quot;
On the Republican side, Rudy Giuliani is running six years too late. He was America&apos;s mayor, and now he&apos;s a moderate trying to play games with the Conservative party. I truly wonder if the party core voters will tolerate a pro-choice candidate? The good news is that he&apos;s way more popular than the next candidate, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who won&apos;t get elected because he&apos;s a Mormon. John McCain&apos;s so dried up, there&apos;s more juice in Ted Kennedy&apos;s tie.
The Republicans also have such awe-inspiring names as Chuck Hagel, Jim Gilmore, Sam Brownback (sorry, some pee just exited my body), Ron Paul, Tom Tancredo, Tommy Thompson, Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee. But seriously, do any of them have a real chance? That actor guy might be interesting to mix things up a little bit, but I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve ever heard of an actor running for President. Couldn&apos;t happen, not in this country.
Picking this race is almost like picking the Super Bowl; you never get the matchup you really want. I&apos;d have to say that we&apos;re looking at Barack Obama running against Rudy Giuliani, and the running mates are anyone&apos;s guess. I know that Hillary has too much pride to accept the back seat; I&apos;d love to see Bill Richardson take the job. Rudy&apos;s running mate? If he chose a savvy guy like Newt Gingrich, who is actual very stable and has toned his act down, that would be one hell of an unbeatable ticket.
Obama/Richardson vs. Giuliani/Gingrich. Good for America, no matter who wins that one.
And it will never fucking happen.

 Pigs On The Wing (Part One) (Pink Floyd) 
Posted on 06/02/2007 at 02:42 AM
Good morning from Florida, where it&apos;s raining on the second day of Hurricane Season. Can I book a tour, or what?
I took off from home on Tuesday afternoon after a thousand hugs and kisses from my wife and daughter. Seriously, when you could die in a flaming car wreck at any point during a road trip, is any number of kisses and hugs ever enough when they could be your last? I think possibly I need to think a little more positively.
I got as far as Knoxville, Tennessee, and called it quits after about 13 hours in the car. I was just up to the point where I knew I would start hallucinating about animals jumping in front of the car, and I&apos;d seen enough dead deer on the the way to err on the side of caution.
Wednesday, I dog-legged it the rest of the way to Daleville, Alabama. I didn&apos;t have far to go, but I opted to stray from my RandMcNally.com directions and bypass Atlanta, which has notoriously bad traffic. Instead, I drove through rural Northeast Georgia, where every police officer looks like Broderick Crawford but I didn&apos;t get to meet any of them, because my New York State License Plate-having ass was driving nice and sloooooooooow. I was heading down into Alabama and on the final leg of the drive, through the army town of Dothan, Alabama (on my way to yet *another* army town), when I saw what I thought was a pack of feral dogs running across the highway.
All of the cars in front of me saw them, too, and we all begun to slow down. The group crossed in front of me, and I was able to get a close look, because I was the second car in the line...they weren&apos;t dogs at all, but a wild boar and her four little piglets running across the road. When I tell you that the last little piggie, the slowest of the bunch, was possibly the cutest thing I ever saw, I&apos;m not lying. Walt Disney couldn&apos;t have made them look any cuter, these little porkers running after their mama into a field of high sawgrass.
Well, if those pigs had turned into people and came to the show Wednesday night at the MVP lounge in Daleville, it wouldn&apos;t have made a difference, I can tell you. It seemed that the whole base was on leave for the Memorial Day holiday, and except for a dozen or so townie regulars, the place was empty. I worked with Jesse Pangelinan from Texas, and we had a decent show considering what we had to work with, which is to say, not very good of a show at all. We failed to reach a critical mass where there were enough people emotionally invested in hearing standup comedy, and you can do your show under those circumstances, but you&apos;re still basically the piano player at the whorehouse...nobody came to listen to you, they are there for other reasons.
Thursday night was the Loft in Columbus, Georgia, yet another army town. Sometimes I think the South is peppered with military bases in case they get the idea to secede again. I feared a replay of the previous evening&apos;s sparse crowd situation, and was pleasantly surprised when the first show sold out, and the second show nearly did. I worked with Matt Davis, who reminds me of Bill Hicks (his dirty material, not political) and he was quite amazing. After I saw his first show, I decided to open up and do my more coarse material, which the second show people loved. They were basically like a second-show Friday crowd; young, liquored-up and ready to succumb to any of the baser instincts that sexually graphic material would awaken in them.
The funny thing about both evenings is that both headliners wanted to get something to eat (which I&apos;m always up for), and we wound up at a Waffle House both times....boy, Southerners sure enjoy their waffles, I must say. I&apos;m still getting the hang of ordering the hash browns, saying scattered, smothered, covered, peppered and chunked (which means with cheese, ham, jalapeno peppers and onions....they also offer mushrooms [capped], tomatoes [diced] and chili [not sure what the word for that is], but I&apos;ve so far passed on those options. You can get the whole shebang and save about 26 cents, which is the cost of any one topping, but at that point you should probably just shit your pants in the booth to save yourself the trouble.
I&apos;m off until Thursday, so reports will probably be light. Enjoy your summer, and stay out of the hot sun.

 Working Man (Rush) 
Posted on 05/24/2007 at 12:36 PM
A comedy set is like sex...sometimes you get paid to do it, even though you&apos;re too tired to do it properly.
And you can do it when no one else is there!
Today I&apos;m celebrating my fifth day of unemployment, and I have high hopes as I enter the final stretch toward my big Florida tour. I got word earlier in the week that a few dates were canceled, but I&apos;m staying with my mom down there, so that just means a couple more days bumming around her place....normally, I&apos;d go nuts because it would mean *not* earning money *and* having to pay for a hotel...which sucks, to be quite honest.
Last week, I had a nice run of stage time, starting with the open mic at the Comix Cafe. We had a good group in the room as the weather was cool and a bit rainy, and everyone seemed to bring their &quot;A&quot; game. I riffed a bit and came up with a couple of &quot;keepers,&quot; and that alone is the best reason to do open mic.
Wednesday, I hit the stage at Shenanigan&apos;s, an open mic held by Rochester&apos;s own Danny Liberto (www.noclowns.com) and we only had two guys in the place to watch the show, and they were only there because the hockey game was just getting over. They stayed and listened politely for the first couple of comics, and then left the bar, now populated by five comics talking to the wall.
Thursday, Liberto&apos;s open mic at the Boulevard Bar and Grill was the complete opposite....the place was full of regulars and also there was a softball team swilling down beer in postgame celebration, which was funny to me, because they lost. Also, Joe Cumbo, an area comic, was part of the softball team and performed in his ballplaying uniform, which I think was a first.
The crowd was boisterous, to say the least, and I had to fight to be heard....I jumped up on a chair (all 300 lbs. of me) and almost had my eye taken out by a ceiling fan that I didn&apos;t see in time. I launched into a shouted version of my act, which turned into a combat comedy set with all the softball hecklers. Joe had an easier time of it, as they were his people, but they still were looking to rip into his ass....familiarity breeding contempt, and all that.
Liberto booked me into a weekend gig on Friday, and I worked with him and Mike &quot;Pickle&quot; Dambra down in Waterloo, NY, at a bar called the Upper Deck. We all had our highs and lows, and I thought I was just eating it, until I saw that every comic on the bill was having their lulls. Still, I was flop-sweating 15 minutes into my half hour, and wound up going over time. It kills me that the worse I&apos;m doing, the longer I do....I guess I&apos;m trying to win them over in one valiant surge; it&apos;s sort of like the Iraq strategy, I guess.
Saturday was a great show. I booked myself into a dinner show for the Hammondsport, NY Volunteer Fire Department. They were a great group, and they treated me to a prime rib dinner before I went on stage, and they couldn&apos;t have been more cordial. I worked cleaner than usual, although I let a little language pass, but they didn&apos;t seem to mind much. Actually, I got better laughs when I swore than when I was trying to clean things up, but I was deferring to the older folks in the group. I got a nice e-mail from the event coordinator thanking me for my performance and inquiring as to my availability next year. You can&apos;t ask for more than that. It&apos;s made my whole attitude toward comedy change...I know I don&apos;t want &quot;fame,&quot; whatever that is, I like getting on stage. And if I can work in front of an attentive, appreciative audience, wherever it may be, than why should I bust my ass trying to get into full-time clubs that pay worse and treat you as some sort of obstruction to their business?
I understand now why a lot of comics go the corporate route. Corporate gigs don&apos;t bristle when you ask for a contract, and you pretty much name your terms. Clubs tell you what you&apos;re jolly well going to get, and if you don&apos;t like it, there&apos;s a hundred guys standing behind you that will happily take what they&apos;re offering. I had more fun at the Hammondsport VFD than I did at some full-time clubs I&apos;ve worked this year. And when I was done, I went home and slept in my own bed.
Tuesday night, it was back to the routine hosting the open mic at Comix Cafe. Steve Burr, my good friend who I&apos;ve seen a lot of lately, came out and did a set, and split the $50 cash prize with Danny Viola, a comic who I started out with back in the late 80&apos;s and who is getting back into the game after sitting out for quite some time to get his teaching degree and start a family (BIG family...as he says in his act, if he has any more children, they have to move into a shoe).
Yesterday, I rented a hedge trimmer from Home Depot and spent most of the day sculpting the pair of conifers that flank our front porch. I put on work clothes and headed outside, and when I gassed up the trimmer and pulled the cord, I felt positively Mexican! I suddenly had the urge to drink Tequila and impregnate my wife, but I kept working. I trimmed back most of the low-lying stuff until my friend Ray Salah arrived to help me by holding the ladder. When all was done, I was on baby-sitting detail with my daughter, and Ray needed a ride home, so we all went to lunch at Bill Gray&apos;s, home of the World&apos;s Greatest Cheeseburger; I&apos;m not sure who hands out that title, but I&apos;m pretty sure Bill Gray&apos;s is in the top 10. Later, I toddled off to Liberto&apos;s Wednesday night open mic and turned in a tired set, as my arms and legs were hurting and distracting me in ways I&apos;m not used to. I still managed to split the money with Steve and Danny &quot;D-Lo&quot; Brown, because we were the only comics who showed.
Tonight, I&apos;m back to the Boulevard, and I won&apos;t stand on any chairs this time, and try to get a piece of that money, because I&apos;m not working at all the rest of the week, so any little bit of income will help, even if it&apos;s just finding change at a fast-food restaurant drive thru (see Steve Burr&apos;s blog at www.steveburrcomedy.com for more information).
Thanks for reading, and the next time I check in, it should be from Daleville, Alabama, leg 1 of the Ralph Tetta Summer Tour. Y&apos;all be cool, now.

 Raise A Little Hell (Trooper) 
Posted on 05/16/2007 at 10:28 AM
It is very busy work to be unemployed!
I&apos;ve been on a tear this week, trying to make up for the lost time I spent dealing with my father&apos;s death. On Monday, I started ripping up the internet, using it for what I felt it was always intended, and that is the world&apos;s biggest combination encyclopedia and phone book. I contacted a room that I&apos;ve worked before asking for a date, and today I got one, and I sent out one promo package to a booker I never heard of before in the New York/New Jersey area, and they seem to have quite a few rooms that I&apos;d like to play; especially because I never played New Jersey before in 19 years of doing standup comedy. Yeah, it&apos;s official....my standup anniversary is the second week of May, 1988. Maybe next year I&apos;ll do something special to commemorate the occassion.
So last week, I was working with my friend Steve Burr, born in Rochester, NY, but late of Los Angeles, CA. We were playing the Comix Cafe in Buffalo, NY, and our Thursday show was ruined by game 1 of the NHL playoff series between the Buffalo Sabres and Ottawa Senators. Instead, the club had dueling pianos, and we stayed home. We were getting paid the same, but who the hell wants that?
Friday, we had two decent shows, although they weren&apos;t packed by any stretch of the imagination. The highlight of the evening for me was talking to a couple of girls after the first show who made a big deal out of explaining where their army husbands were deployed and how far away those places were. The one girl had nice tits (read: large), but not nice enough to break a marriage vow over, mine or hers. Actually, the highlight was a prank that Steve played on me the second show. I was hanging out in the bar talking with some of the Buffalo local comics, and one of the servers came running out and yelled to me &quot;Steve&apos;s getting his ass kicked! There&apos;s a guy on stage!&quot;
Now, I know my friend Steve to be a peaceable guy (who said &quot;fop?&quot;) and smart enough to run if things got too hot, but I&apos;m going to get in there anyway just to make sure he&apos;s o.k. I started running into the showroom, which requires you to run around this little tunnel past the box office and on the way, my wedding band fell off and bounced on the ground. I stopped only for half a second, picked it up, put it back on and gave it a little kiss (as I always do, Pammey, if you&apos;re reading this). Once into the showroom, I saw Steve on stage as though nothing happened, but a large guy from the audience (huge bastard, but young) smiling and walking toward the stage like he was claiming his raffle prize. That&apos;s when I knew it was a prank and we had a little comedic give &apos;n&apos; take that was actually a lot of fun.
Saturday, we had the Buffalo Sabres game 2 with Ottawa, and the club rented a large screen TV to show the game on, with comedy planned for the two intermission periods. I didn&apos;t think it was going to be such a hot idea, and to be honest, I was right and it couldn&apos;t have been any worse. After the first period, Buffalo scored a late goal to tie it up 2-2. I went on stage, happy that they weren&apos;t trailing anymore, and started doing my show. A four-top in the front row were arguing over what seemed to be the check, and I thought it unusual that the checks would be dropped so early in the evening. I tried to get them quieted down by directing some jokes at them, but they kept fussing and sooner or later, Mike the manager came over. I was no more than two minutes into my set when one of the guys at the table swung at Mike, who then decided to unleash the Irish fury on the guy, yanking him out of the chair and throwing him on stage at my feet.
So during this whole episode, I&apos;m silent....like, what could you say? And the kid&apos;s yelling &quot;Call the police, call the police,&quot; like he&apos;s not the one who told Mike to suck his dick and then swung at him, and displayed behavior that basically led everyone to believe he wasn&apos;t going to pay his bill. Now, my ten minute set is shot to shit, the room is in disarray, and I&apos;m getting the same attention I would have gotten if I was auctioning off bags of candied bat assholes. It was horrible. I soldiered through, but I don&apos;t really know what I was expecting.
Next period of hockey, the Sabres sink to a 3-2 deficit. Now MC Kevin Carlin brings up Steve. Steve does his thing, but there&apos;s a malaise in the room, just a depression. It&apos;s not a comedy club, it&apos;s a wake for a professional sports team. If they lose this one, they&apos;re looking at two games in Ottawa and the possibility of getting swept, and who the hell needs that? So after that, we spent the time chatting with several Buffalo area comics who came out to hang around, including Nick Siracuse (writer for The Arsenio Hall Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and one of the funniest guys I know), Tom Tran and Matt Bergman.
The game is ticking down and I&apos;m seated in the crowd, talking hockey with some of the guys in the front row like I actually know what I&apos;m talking about, and miracle of miracles, the Sabres score, sending the game into overtime! I begged Mike to let me go back on stage, and he obliged, and I did another 10 minutes, which went well. I really needed the opportunity to redeem myself, I felt like a sham trying to comedy under the circumstances the first try afforded.
So after one overtime period, there&apos;s another intermission, and another comic takes the stage, this time, it&apos;s Tom Mahoney, formerly of Buffalo, now living in Florida and up visiting the area. He did his show, but the crowd was so exhausted, they responded like they were the ones who had been skating around for three hours. Sadly, the Sabres lost 4-3 after being scored on in the 8th minute of the second overtime, and then they lost again on Monday. Tomorrow night, they face elimination after winning the most games in the league in the regular season, and surviving two playoff rounds against the New York Rangers and Islanders.
And what about me? My merchandise sales were killed as the kind comedy loving folks from Buffalo shuffled past me, harboring no interest at all in procuring a souvenir from such a disappointing evening.
Tonight was fun, though, as we bid Steve bon voyage on his way back to Los Angeles. We had a comedian&apos;s supper out at Ponderosa Steakhouse, attended by Rochester&apos;s Mike Dambra, Danny Liberto, Mark Wiedmann, Steve and myself. We enjoyed a tasty repast and good conversation, and then Steve and I headed off to the Comix Cafe for the open mic. Steve did a great set in the lead-off position, and then headed out with a female acquaintance. I was hosting so I stayed to the end, bringing some of Rochester&apos;s newest comics to the stage, all vying for the big cash prize for the funniest comic.
The rest of the week is mine to decide what I want to do, with two nice local gigs to fill my weekend, and then next week, I could go live on a desert island because nobody&apos;s expecting me. The Cafe mentioned that there might be some work for me in my old position of showroom coordinator, and I might take them up on that to shake the dust off and see if my record still plays. Plus a little money in my pocket sounds better than sitting home, wishing I was in a club somewhere. There might even be a guest spot in it for me if I&apos;m really itching for the stage time. We&apos;ll see how that shakes out.
And hey, I don&apos;t know if I ever mentioned it, but my webguy Bruce put up some video on my site at www.ralphtetta.com, so check it out if you want.
Peace be with you, and also with you.

 Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of A New Day (Jethro Tull) 
Posted on 05/11/2007 at 02:44 PM
Well, it&apos;s Summer here in Rochester, and I&apos;m suffering...mostly from allergies, the pollen is kicking my ass, but also because the Buffalo Sabres are in the NHL playoffs.
I&apos;m scheduled to perform at the Comix Cafe in Buffalo, NY tonight and tomorrow with long-time comedy buddy Steve Burr, and tonight will be normal, but tomorrow will be all messed up because of Game 2 between Buffalo and the Ottawa Senators.
Instead of conventional wisdom, running shows as normal or perhaps condensing to one show when the game is over, the Cafe has chosen to work a different format. The middle act for the evening (Me) will take the stage during the first intermission, and the closer (Steve) will perform during the second intermission. That&apos;s it, one show on Saturday, actually interrupting the playoff game.
Now, I&apos;m no fortune-teller, but I&apos;m gambling on this being a rough show or at the very least, a difficult time for Steve and myself. It&apos;s a special $5 admission to the club to see the game and the comedy show, and I have to figure that it&apos;s just going to be annoying for anyone who wanted to see comedy to have it interrupted by the second period of hockey, and anyone who is focused on the hockey probably won&apos;t be too concerned about the comedy. And the intermission periods are only, what, 10 minutes each? I&apos;m not a big hockey fan so I don&apos;t even know. I almost feel like why bother having comedy if you&apos;re going to concede to the game? It&apos;s being played in Buffalo, so that&apos;s going to take 17,000 people off the streets, which would kill attendance at the best of times, so what do I know? Maybe this is the perfect strategy. Regardless, it&apos;s a bit of a morale buster for me as I love the Buffalo Comix Cafe and their above-average audiences very much and the missed opportunity to perform for them to my full potential has me down.
Last night the show was changed from comedy to dueling pianos, so I stayed home, yet another bummer. I enjoy time with my family, but I am also a man, and that means I have a desire to be fulfilled by my work, and this week isn&apos;t living up to my expectations. Not that cutting the lawn and doing other domestic chores didn&apos;t give me some sense of accomplishment, but the applause just wasn&apos;t the same when I was finished. Ah, well.
I&apos;ll check in again after the dust settles. This should be interesting, to say the least.

 More Than Words (Extreme) 
Posted on 05/04/2007 at 04:51 PM
I made a breakthrough last night on stage at the Comedy Zone in Knoxville, Tennesee. I actually trusted myself to be funny, did my closer in the middle of my set, and left myself without an out.
Not really, but basically, I did a weaker closer and it worked just fine.
I riffed on some stuff I&apos;d been working on and it worked great. This was all provoked by a discussion I had with headliner Greg Warren who said to me, &quot;If your material is overlapping with another comic on the bill with you, you&apos;re writing in the wrong direction.&quot;
It was powerful, to say the least. I watched Lewis Black on HBO after the show last night, and was so envious of his ability to work, speak his mind, and not worry about who he might piss off. I need to work like that, speak my mind, not be afraid, and trade on what makes me special, my specific point of view. I must be a commodity, I&apos;m the only me that&apos;s ever been made....I&apos;m one of a kind.
So I got to thinking about my material, and bits that I do that get laughs, but frankly are pandering and insincere. And also started looking at stereotypes and cliches. And that got me interested enough to search out cliches on the internet and I came up with an interesting list. Check these out;
Comparing Apples To Oranges. O.K., you want me to compare apples to apples? That&apos;s fine, a Macintosh is not the same as a Red Delicious, but isn&apos;t it fair enough to compare apples to oranges rather than, say, broccoli? Or lightbulbs? How about if I compare apples to apple pie? I can make the argument that comparing apples to oranges is valid or invalid depending on the way I want the argument to swing. So let&apos;s stop pretending that this is a valid response to an argument that the speaker doesn&apos;t find favorable. He&apos;s a pretentious blowhard who&apos;s been backed into a corner.
Been There, Done That, Got A T-Shirt. You&apos;re basically trying to tell me that either you know what I&apos;m talking about or that my comment is not advancing our conversation any further. What I basically think when you say this is that you&apos;re not skilled in the use of conjunctions and you&apos;re stupid enough to pay too much for souveneirs.
Gave 110% Effort. Well, that&apos;s physically impossible. You have whatever measurable talent or energy you have, and that&apos;s it. There&apos;s no mystical storehouse that you can draw on just because your coach has cancer, or you&apos;ve lost the last three Super Bowls or your company really needed this account or they were going out of business. The truth is, you gave 100% effort, and all the time leading up to this event, you&apos;ve been slacking. You&apos;ve been giving 90%, and only because your balls were on the chopping block, did the remaining 10% suddenly come bubbling to the surface.
Emotional Roller Coaster. This is stupid. How about, Bob crashed his car and then while he was in the hospital, he won the state lottery and then his mother died? I think any reasonably prudent person would be able to identify the emotions that Bob went through. Emotional Roller Coaster sounds like a stupid ride at a bad amusement park. And after you ride it, you can go spend some time on the mood swings.
Exchanged Pleasantries. Really, man? How about they said &quot;hello?&quot; Exchanging pleasantries sounds to me like they jerked each other off....there&apos;s a lot more going on than just talking. And you have to watch out when you exchange pleasantries, because things might Get A Little Out Of Hand.
Old News. This is a phrase that I would like to see abolished. It&apos;s either old or it&apos;s new....can&apos;t be both. It&apos;s wrong, unless you&apos;re talking about a bum sleeping under some old newspapers, in which &quot;old&quot; is commenting on the papers, not the stories in them. And stop being so judgmental, the papers might be &quot;new&quot; to him anyways.
Y&apos;all. This is a common phrase in the South, and Southerners use it just to keep Northerners off balance. Y&apos;all is the supposed contraction of You All, but frankly, the phrase can mutate into another meaning altogether in the course of one sentence. A Southern man could honestly say (and mean it), &quot;O.K., I can take Y&apos;all to the movies, but I can&apos;t take All &apos;O Y&apos;all. All &apos;O Y&apos;all? Really? All Of You All? You All went from meaning &quot;everyone&quot; to meaning &quot;not everyone&quot; in the same sentence.
Old Man Winter. I don&apos;t really understand this one. We already had Mother Nature, but I guess we don&apos;t like the idea of our Mother being cold and mean to us, stopping us from getting where we have to go easily. The biggest problem in Winter is the difficulty in driving in the snow and ice, so in that respect, I guess Old Man Winter slows down traffic, and it&apos;s more politically correct than saying Old Man Driving Too Slow In The Fast Lane With His Left Blinker On Winter.
How about these phrases that contain unnecessary fat?
Close Proximity. You mean &quot;close.&quot;
General Public. Is there a specific public? They&apos;re not talking about me, are they?
Taken Into Custody. This is the Park Avenue way of saying &quot;arrested.&quot; It&apos;s for white people who make over $100,000 a year. Black people and poor people are &quot;busted,&quot; which used to mean just &quot;broke,&quot; and probably is closer to the truth than anyone wants to admit.
Submitted His Resignation. He resigned. He had to; it took him too long to get to the point.
And with that, I will sign off. I&apos;ve tried to be funny today, but I&apos;m at my Wit&apos;s End.

 The Relay (The Who) 
Posted on 04/30/2007 at 06:31 AM
Well, good morning. I&apos;m up with the birds and about to hit the road home from Battle Creek, Michigan, fresh off the 4th Annual Relay For Life Benefit Comedy Show for the American Cancer Society. I headlined the affair, and the good folks at Relay For Life were nice enough to dedicate the event to my father, whom they called Ralph Tetta, Sr., and even though we never did the Sr./Jr. thing (I have a middle name, William, and my father had no given middle name), it didn&apos;t make the evening any more special.
I worked this weekend at Gary Fields&apos; Comedy Club with headliner Greg Morton, and our crowds were disappointing to say the least. The Relay show on Sunday was sold out, however, 250 tickets and they turned about 80 people away. When I pulled up to the club at 6 PM for the 7 o&apos;clock show, there was a line outside the club like Wrestlemania was in town.
I got into the club and said hello to my fellow comics, all of whom I&apos;d met before and worked with except for Kathie Dice from Ohio. Our bill tonight included Kathie, Mark Knope and Dave Glardon from Ohio, Dwayne Gill, John Face (the event organizer), Chris Young and Barry Fuller from Michigan, and lil&apos; ol&apos; me from New York
After saying my hellos and setting up shop in the green room, I set up my borrowed video camera to tape the show. John gave me a copy of the program for the evening&apos;s show, and even though I knew that at some point in the evening I was going to become weepy and let the emotions take me over, I didn&apos;t know it was going to be so soon. The program reads as follows:
This year we send our support and love to comedian Ralph Tetta, who is performing tonight for his second year in a row. On March 18th, 2007, Ralph lost his father, Ralph Tetta Sr. to cancer.
Ralph, Thank you for coming tonight, and know we all will be praying for you and your family.
Well, that pretty much did me in right there.
The show was amazing, with everyone turning in just a magical set. I wasn&apos;t so impressed with my own performance, as there were a few things I think I could have done differently, and I tried to do new material, or at the very least, older material that I hadn&apos;t trotted out so much lately, and the set was a little uneven, but I got the laughs and nobody knew it wasn&apos;t what I exactly planned. After my set, I came back out on stage and gave a weepy speech about my Dad and how I was happy to come back and do the event, and how nice everyone was to me and what it meant to me, and then all the comics were called back out onto the stage and we were given these neat little awards for contributing our services to the event. I don&apos;t know how much money was raised in total, but it felt like it was a lot, from all the accounts I&apos;ve heard so far.
We all shook hands with everyone as they left the show, and a lot of members of John&apos;s family came out and hugged me, and it was nice, and John&apos;s sister said to me that I was there for them last year when John lost his mother, and this year, they were here for me. I felt overwhelmed in the evening as I&apos;m usually pretty comfortable giving help to others but not so well versed in receiving it.
Afterwards, Mark, John, Kathie and I retreated to the AmeriHost where we were being put up, ordered some pizza and talked shop. I was going to try and drive home but I was exhausted and was pretty sure I couldn&apos;t do the eight hour drive without crapping out somewhere in Canada. I did some preliminary packing and caught about three hours of sleep (a good nap, I don&apos;t care who you are), and I&apos;m up now. I&apos;m going to catch a shower and hit the road, and with the right combination of coffee and peppermint gum, I should be o.k.
This week is Knoxville, Tennessee, at the Comedy Zone, one of my favorite rooms in the country, and then it&apos;s three weeks working close to home, so that will be a nice change.
In closing, I just want to mention that if you&apos;re interested in donating to Relay For Life or the American Cancer Society, you can do it here; http://www.cancer.org/docroot/par/content/PAR_1_Relay_For_Life.asp The spirit of wanting to help doesn&apos;t require any special skills, you can just send a couple of bucks to the cause. I did the first Relay show, never knowing that a year later, my father would be gone due to cancer. I will keep doing shows like this as many times as I&apos;m asked, and if someday I can look and see that someone didn&apos;t have to go through what my father went through, or their family didn&apos;t have to go through what my family went through, then it will all be worth it.
God bless you, everyone.

 Don&apos;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey (Sly And The Family Stone) 
Posted on 04/28/2007 at 12:46 PM
I got a bulletin in my &quot;MySpace&quot; box today from someone on my friends list named [NAME DELTED BY REQUEST]. Now, I have over 700 friends, many of whom I&apos;ve met through comedy shows and some who have just surfed on to my page and thought I would be a good friend. I&apos;m not sure which one this guy is, but he is not someone I call friend in &quot;real&quot; life. He posted this diatribe, and I thought I would share it.
Date: Apr 28, 2007 12:47 AM
Proud To Be White
Someone finally said it.
How many are actually paying attention to this?
There are African Americans, Mexican Americans,
Asian Americans, Arab Americans, Native Americans, etc.
And then there are just Americans.
You pass me on the street
and sneer in my direction.
You Call me &quot;White boy,&quot; &quot;Cracker,&quot; &quot;Honkey,&quot;
&quot;Whitey,&quot; &quot;Caveman&quot; ..
And that&apos;s OK.
But when I call you, Nigger, Kike, Towel head, Sand-nigger, Camel Jockey, Beaner, Gook, or Chink ... You call me a racist.
You say that whites commit a lot of violence against you,
So why are the ghettos the most dangerous places to live?
You have the United Negro College Fund.
You have Martin Luther King Day.
You have Black History Month.
You have Cesar Chavez Day.
You Have Yom Hashoah
You have Ma&apos;uled Al-Nabi
You have the NAACP.
You have BET.
If we had WET (White Entertainment Television) . We&apos;d be racists.
If we had a White Pride Day ..
You would call us racists.
If we had White History Month
We&apos;d be racists.
If we had any organization for only whites
to &quot;advance&quot; OUR lives
We&apos;d be racists.
We have a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,
a Black Chamber of Commerce,
And then we just have the
plain Chamber of Commerce.
Wonder who pays for that?
If we had a college fund that only gave
white students scholarships
... You know we&apos;d be racists.
There are over 60 openly proclaimed
Black Colleges in the US ,
Yet if there were &quot;White colleges&quot; ..
THAT would be a racist college.
In the Million Man March,
you believed that you were marching
For your race and rights.
If we marched for our race and rights,
You would call us racists.
You are proud to be black, brown, yellow and orange, and you&apos;re Not afraid to announce it.
But when we announce our white pride ..
You call us racists.
You rob us, carjack us, and shoot at us.
But, when a white police officer
Shoots a black gang member
or beats up a black drug-dealer running
From the law and posing a threat to society .
You call him a racist.
I am proud.
But, you call me a racist.
Why is it that only whites
can be racists?
There is nothing improper about this e-mail.
Let&apos;s see which of you are proud enough to send it on.
This is not a RACIST bulletin. I have nothing against any of you, but I am proud. Pass it along.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, I thought I should respond, but after writing my response, I realized that there is probably precious little I could do to change this guy&apos;s mind. He has some problem with black people, probably a bad experience early on, and that sort of conditioning is hard to overturn.
Despite that, I thought I made some pretty good points, so I&apos;ll share my response with you. I hope you enjoy it.
Dear [NAME DELETED BY REQUEST],
The problem with your logic is that white Americans do not identify themselves primarily as &quot;white,&quot; we identify ourselves by national origin, ie &quot;Italian-American,&quot; &quot;Irish-American,&quot; et al. Unless the individual is a complete mutt, in which case there is usually some American Indian floating around in the mix, which would not make them exclusively &quot;white&quot; anyway.
I have no problem with the institutions you list, the NAACP, black colleges and the like, because they are necessary social remedies to even the playing field for blacks in America who have never really socially recovered from slavery and the Jim Crow policies that followed.
And let&apos;s face it, being called &quot;cracker&quot; by a black person is WAY less hurtful than being called &quot;nigger&quot; by a white person. There is a social inequity in the deliverer of the invective and the receiver that renders &quot;cracker&quot; light and meaningless. &quot;Nigger,&quot; however, is pushed downhill and has much more weight and causes much more emotional damage.
White people generally feel that race isn&apos;t even something they possess, it is a quality that only blacks, Latinos, Asians and others are imbued with. You never hear discussions of &quot;white-on-white&quot; crimes, although they happen every day and are much more common than any other kind of crime. Whites only use the term &quot;white&quot; when it is necessary to distinguish themselves from other races.
Any discussion of race, as you intend to start with this bulletin, must consider that our shared goal must be the acceptance, tolerance and equality of all races. Unfortunately, for whites, this means the insistence that blacks assimilate into white culture, which is akin to asking Jews who survived the holocaust to speak German and eat schnitzel.
I believe in an America that is truly a melting pot and embraces Italians and Irish and Germans and Asians of all types, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans and Native Americans and yes, even African-Americans, Jamaicans and other ethnic groups that call themselves &quot;black.&quot; And I am no less proud of my Italian background in the face of Martin Luther King Day and BET and other &quot;black&quot; institutions.
You need to get over whatever negative feelings there are in you that prompted you to write this bulletin, or they will eat you alive. America is always going to be a melange of different races, ethnic groups and religions, and the freedom of these peoples to worship, enjoy their national heritage and practice their customs is guaranteed by our Constitution, and you&apos;ll never change that.
Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;m going to get into my Japanese car, put on some blues and go get some Chinese food.

 Raining in Baltimore (Counting Crows) 
Posted on 04/27/2007 at 12:28 AM
Just checking in from the lobby of the Grand Inn in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tonight&apos;s show in Rockford, Michigan, about ten miles north of here, was one of the worst attended shows at the Crazy Horse Saloon that I&apos;ve ever seen, and that joint usually packs &apos;em in. I turned in what I thought was an above-average show, despite being tar-whupped from driving two hours out of my way to Battle Creek so I could pick up copies of the newspaper; they featured me in an article about the Relay For Life show I&apos;m doing at Gary Field&apos;s Comedy Club this week, and I wanted copies to send to my family. So I headed all the way down there from Mt. Pleasant (in the pouring rain) and got them, and then when I got to the hotel, I found the article was posted on line. I&apos;m an idiot! You can see the article at www.battlecreekenquirer.com; just do a search for comedy show and Relay For Life to read it. I&apos;m not sure why the link didn&apos;t copy here, I guess the technology is kicking my ass again.
I&apos;m working with one of my favorite guys in the business this week, Mr. Greg Morton, and on Sunday, I&apos;m working with a bunch of comics including John Face, Mark Knope and Barry Fuller. I&apos;m looking forward to doing the pal-around thing with the guys and this year, I&apos;ve actually got the time to hang out, versus last year when I did the show and then had to skedaddle right away. The show is sold out, which is mega-cool, and I&apos;m really excited about it.
Not a lot more to mention, but I haven&apos;t checked in and I want my regulars to know that I&apos;m o.k. Hope the weather&apos;s cooperating with you wherever you are, it&apos;s rainy and crappy here and not doing anything for my diabetes-fueled depression. I want a chocolate bar so badly right now I&apos;d beat up a kid to get one, and that&apos;s not good. I think I&apos;ll just watch a movie and get some rest.

 It&apos;s Inevitable (Charlie) 
Posted on 04/22/2007 at 05:41 AM
What do you do when the thing that should mean the most to you feels like despair?
I&apos;m still up, 4:30 in the morning, winding down from my one and only show tonight at the Castel Grisch Winery in Watkins Glen, New York. I hosted the show, with feature Dennis Ross and headliner/booker Danny Liberto. The show was well attended and the people who ran the place were great, even after I busted a vase coming out of the men&apos;s room....I was walking past a fireplace, decorative, I think, and they had two large clay pots, not really vases, and I brushed across the fake flowers in one of them, spun the pot around, and it fell and busted. I offered to pay for it, and the owner waved me off, telling me she got it from Michael&apos;s, which made me feel a whole lot better.
This week I was supposed to be in Greensboro, North Carolina for Comedy Zone, and I was victimized by a double-booking. Happily, I was able to score the work I did on short notice, or I would be completely broke this week. I don&apos;t mind getting canceled, but with only two weeks notice of the cancelation, I was lucky even to get the gig that I got, never mind that it didn&apos;t in any way come close to replacing the work I lost. I think it&apos;s unfair that two headliners get to fight for the position, and as a feature, I took the booking in good faith only to get pushed out because someone couldn&apos;t keep their calendar in order. But that&apos;s a discussion for another day.
Pam and I took Harmony to the mall on Friday night and let her ride the carousel four times....two with Pam escorting her, and then two times with Daddy. She loved it, which I thought was great because when she was a little younger (two vs. three....wow, what a difference), we put her on a small choo-choo train at the Strong Kid&apos;s Museum and she hated it....I think the train whistle may have been too loud and scary for her. Afterwards, we went and had a nice Olive Garden dinner, and then went home and played games and spent time together, and I was wracked with despair over being unemployed on a Friday night. I should have been ecstatic that for the first time in months I actually had some quality family time with my wife and daughter, and all I could think about was that I wasn&apos;t on stage, I wasn&apos;t making any money, and I couldn&apos;t enjoy myself.
I&apos;m a workaholic. I know that. A long time ago, my buddy Ricky K. and I used to stay up late, drinking coffee and talking about comedy. We used to talk about &quot;regular&quot; people and how shallow they were, that we were different, we didn&apos;t &quot;go out&quot; on the weekends, we got on stage and the &quot;regular&quot; people paid to see us. We mocked their dance clubs and pithy Top 40 music, and a part of it was probably that we lacked the proper skills for socialization, and comedy was a vehicle to get us to some area of cool that we thought we deserved. Our whole clique of comics were basically misfit toys with no place else to go...if we weren&apos;t doing standup comedy, we would have been shambling, mumbling homeless men, straight-job working drones ticking down until the day we went postal, and substance abusers fistfighting our way through half-days of normalcy. We didn&apos;t want to do comedy, we needed to do comedy.
And this dovetails perfectly into a commentary on the Virginia Tech incident this week. The shooter, whose name I won&apos;t even pretend I know how to spell, idolized the Columbine shooters, from what I understand. And this means only one thing, and that is that he felt disenfranchised, that he didn&apos;t feel &quot;normal,&quot; and that he had to lash out. He probably would&apos;ve been a damn fine comic, although I read one of his &quot;plays&quot; as reported by AOL, and frankly, he would have had to have hit a few more open mics to work the material out.
Regardless.....there are a LOT of people out there who feel that they don&apos;t fit in....you don&apos;t have to look very far to find them...just go to a performance of an improv group and you&apos;ll find a dozen of them right there. There are people who are dangerously close to blowing their top, and they don&apos;t have the outlets that as comics, we are blessed with. That kid needed an outlet, or at least a girlfriend. I&apos;ll say this....there aren&apos;t many college-aged guys who are getting laid regularly that are going out and buying weapons and shooting up the place. They&apos;re writing faggy love poetry and walking around with cartoon love-hearts flying out of their heads! Ladies, of either high-school or college age, if you see a potential shooter at yourschool, FUCK THAT YOUNG MAN! Or at least suck his dick once or twice. A guy getting his dick sucked will not be shopping for guns on the internet! He will be looking for ways to please you, and heed your beck and call. Ladies, the life you save could be your own, and several of your instructors and classmates.
Before I did comedy, Friday nights were a perfect example of quiet desperation for me. I worked, and made a lot of money, managing a convenience store in the &apos;80&apos;s. Every Friday, at 6 PM, I was turned loose on the streets with a car and a pocket full &apos;o cash. And before I discovered Rochester&apos;s one comedy club at the time, I didn&apos;t know what to do! My big Friday evening usually consisted of getting a big takeout container of hot wings and plunking down in front of the TV to watch HBO. I can&apos;t imagine living that static lifestyle ever again. I was never a bar person....maybe I&apos;m an elitist or something, but bars always sucked to me. They were for hooking up, and I didn&apos;t want a hookup, I wanted to meet someone. And it&apos;s hard to get to know someone when the music&apos;s so loud you can&apos;t hear the person next to you, but you know they&apos;re talking to you because they have a concerned look on their face, and that&apos;s only because a blood vessel in your eye just burst.
After comedy, I had everything a sane person needs....a group of instant friends (the other comics), an outlet for getting the things that iritate me off my chest (stage time) and some attention (also the stage time). I&apos;ve also managed to wrangle it into a career, so now I have an income based on it, albeit a small one, and I also get to travel, which I love to do. So I don&apos;t want to do comedy, I need to do comedy. In May, I celebrate 19 years from the first time I ever did open mic. To contrast, Pam and I will be married six years come this November, and we&apos;ve been together for 13 years. No matter how you slice it, comedy came first and has been with me the longest, and I&apos;ll probably never be able to give it up.
So this week I go back to work, with a five-day tour through Michigan ending with a cancer benefit at Gary Field&apos;s in Battle Creek. Tomorrow, I&apos;m probably going to hit Danny Liberto&apos;s open mic and try out some new stuff, and I&apos;ve also got my own open mic at the Comix Cafe on Tuesday. That leaves only Monday night with no comedy. I think I&apos;ll try to convince my wife that I&apos;m going to buy a gun and shoot up a school, maybe she&apos;ll save the day.

 Pressure (Billy Joel) 
Posted on 04/17/2007 at 06:36 PM
If you want to really see where your relationship is with your spouse or significant other, sit down and file a joint tax return with them. You&apos;ll find out quickly where you stand.
Last night, tearing ourselves to the core and tempting the last minute deadline of what seems to be an ever-expanding income tax filing date, the lovely Pamela Ruth and I sat down with the H&amp;R;Block Tax Cut tax preparation software and tried to muddle through our statements for the Federal and New York State governments. Because we made more money than the year past, we got a smaller return, but it&apos;s a return nonetheless and I&apos;m going to take it. During the course of running the numbers, we hit each other, cursed, spit, and I&apos;m not sure but I think Pamela mumbled something anit-Semitic (Family Guy reference....I&apos;m not Jewish).
I&apos;m off this week so we&apos;re going to spend the rest of the time trying to reclaim our living space which has become choked with detritus, the baby and her clothing and toys notwithstanding. We&apos;ve lived together for 12 years and have never thrown anything away (it seems) that we acquired in that time, and now we&apos;re in a small two-bedroom apartment with just too damn much stuff. I&apos;m mostly to blame, as I&apos;m a collector of items, in this case, heavy metal records, books, magazines (mostly music oriented), comic books and God knows what else. I have Slinkys, Spirograph sets, puzzles including Rubik&apos;s Cubes, 3D jigsaw puzzles and various brain-twister games, and that&apos;s just what&apos;s jammed in my closet. I have a box of Micronauts toys (popular in the 1980&apos;s) that are in pretty good condition. I have a cornflakes box with my picture on it (courtesy of the Kellogg&apos;s museum in Battle Creek, Michigan-Harmony calls it &quot;Daddy&apos;s Cereal&quot;) and a box of Flutie Flakes with former New England Patriots/Buffalo Bills/San Diego Chargers/Toronto Argonauts quarterback Doug Flutie on it (flakes not included). I have piles of cassette tapes (yeah, I still use &apos;em) of every artist imaginable, although I just donated about 300 of them to the Salvation Army (yes, I took the deduction on that this year), and piles of CD&apos;s from mostly unsigned artists because I can&apos;t figure out a way to sell them online. This week is going to be a cleaning of the stables, or as much as I possibly can, before the tour resumes in Michigan next Wednesday. I&apos;m going to be eBay-ing a lot of it, so if you&apos;re interested in this type of stuff I&apos;ve mentioned, keep your ear to the ground.
I hate to have days off, but they are inevitable, so the dutiful thing is to put them to good use. I honestly don&apos;t think that we&apos;ll be able to get everything done this week, but as long as we can clear out enough space to make the apartment more maneuverable, I&apos;ll consider it a blessing and a gift.
Keep the sunny side up!

 Can&apos;t Find My Way Home (Blind Faith) 
Posted on 04/12/2007 at 06:15 PM
The watchword in comedy today is the same word it has been for the last 20 years....routing. You try to match up your gigs so that you get the most fortunate use of motor miles, accumulating as much money as possible with work that happens to be close together. The best routing I was ever able to hook up was a couple of years ago when I played Daleville and Dothan, Alabama, back-to-back, and they are only about 20 miles apart. A masterstroke of routing, I must say.
I&apos;m working in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this week, and it is snowing. I managed to hook up a gig in Brantford, Ontario, Canada last night, which is right on the 403 expressway across Ontario that I would have traveled anyway to get to Michigan. Sweet, huh? The gig itself was a bit of a knife-fight, where the denizens wanted to be picked on moreso than listen to finely crafted material, but that&apos;s what they wanted, so that&apos;s what they got. I&apos;m no Don Imus, but I threw a good number of &quot;kill&quot; lines out there and trashed a guy pretty hard, but he was hammered and wouldn&apos;t shut up.
It rained all the way here....I grabbed a hotel in Flint (I am a Motel 6 whore!) and took off today at noon....the snow started coming somewhere between Lansing and Grand Rapids, and I decided it must be lake effect.....damn that lake effect snow.
I got an e-mail from my friend John Face, a comic from this neck of the woods, and he informs me that the Relay For Life benefit show that we&apos;re doing later this month is sold out. Relay For Life is an agency that concerns itself with cancer, and that is a cause that is close to my heart, because I lost two of my grandparents and recently, my father, to the disease. I did the benefit last year, and this year, John tells me that they are adding my father&apos;s name to the event as a memoriam. I am deeply touched and so glad that I can be a part of this show, comedy is what I do and in the regular course of my life, I&apos;m not going to find a cure for cancer or bring medical aid or comfort to cancer patients, so this is my way of contributing. The show is at Gary Field&apos;s comedy club in Battle Creek, Michigan, and I&apos;m performing there that week as a part of their regularly scheduled shows for the week, and then doing the benefit on Sunday. That&apos;s some routing, huh?
Next week, I was supposed to perform in Greensboro, North Carolina for Comedy Zone, but I got bumped due to a double-booking. The problem with this is that it leaves very little time (in reality, no time) to schedule something else. I still managed to find something courtesy of Danny Liberto at the Comedy Company. It&apos;s a gig in Watkins Glen with Danny and Dennis Ross, a friend of mine that I worked a tour with a while back. It&apos;s only a one-nighter, so it won&apos;t replace the full week that I lost, but it&apos;s enough to put some groceries on the table and the rest of the week, I&apos;ll get a good amount of time with my family for a change....I probably need it at this point. So, thank you Danny, for the work. You&apos;re a good guy and you saved the day!
I still have a few hours before showtime at Dr. Grins, so I&apos;m gonna stretch out and read a little bit. I&apos;m three chapters into &quot;Fargo Rock City&quot; by Chuck Klosterman, courtesy of my friend Pat Duffy who lent me his copy. It&apos;s excellent, I&apos;ve always enjoyed Klosterman&apos;s work, and the journey down nostalgia lane to the heyday of metal in the 80&apos;s makes it a real good read for me. I&apos;ll probably finish it this week, what with no more long drives in front of me until I have to get home on Sunday.
Such are the benefits of routing!

 New Thing (Enuff Z&apos;nuff) 
Posted on 04/05/2007 at 12:42 AM
I have climbed down from the cross.
Today is a day off, my third in four days, and I spent most of it in the car, driving and thinking and driving and talking and driving and listening to talk radio. I settled down in Bristol, Virginia, a good four hours from tomorrow night&apos;s show, and just decided to relax in my hotel room and enjoy some television. Only I didn&apos;t relax so much as get myself jazzed.
C-SPAN was airing a special taped last month at the Cooper Union that featured Tim Russert hosting a Lincoln-Douglas style debate featuring Newt Gingrich and Mario Cuomo. I was riveted by what both speakers had to say. They both made my eyes well up with tears, they spoke so clearly and with such a love for our country and with such dismay over the way it has broken. I followed up by watching &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; on HBO, and even though it was a repeat, I enjoyed it anyway, and then I watched the Jerry Seinfeld Comedy Arts Award show on HBO. It featured some of my favorite comics, Robert Klein, Chris Rock, Gary Shandling and Seinfeld himself, discussing standup comedy which is something I could watch (and talk about) for hours.
Lately I&apos;ve been running myself through the mill with questions....questions about whether I should keep doing standup comedy or not, questions about getting involved in politics (I really was considering that for a while), and questions about what I could do to help improve the situation in our country, how I could give aid to the less fortunate and hope to the hopeless.
I believe that the answers to my questions are slowly taking shape, but just like a streetlight in the fog looks like a streetlight because even though you cannot see it&apos;s form, you can pretty much guess what it is not and by previous experience guess what it probably is, the answers are pretty clear. I need not change what I am doing, but how I am doing it.
I love doing standup comedy, and watching Klein and the others discuss it just drove it home for me. I&apos;m not going to be happy doing anything else, and damn the consequences. I can work harder to make better business decisions, and throw my rope at the better paying work, and that certainly means working harder. Right now, I&apos;m in with about five major bookers that keep my schedule full, but at club-level money which is a one-way ticket to the poverty line. Corporate events pay much better, as do cruise ships, casinos and the like, but they require a different kind of comic. Well, the only thing stopping me from being that type of comic is the willingness to change the type of material I resort to. I wrote three great bits this week, all clean and funny (the Kool and His Friend joke got lots of compliments, thank you all) and I know that I can work that way. Any notion of being a &quot;sell-out&quot; because I would work a gig where I can&apos;t work blue needs to be dismissed. I&apos;ve come to find that working blue is a lazy man&apos;s trap for me...it&apos;s so simple to take what I consider to be a well-developed joke writing talent (19 years spent developing it come May) and apply it to a scatological concept. Not that I don&apos;t enjoy working blue....I like working on that edge and saying the things that shock and get the women shrieking, but it&apos;s an evolutionary dead-end for me.
Last night at Tippers in Clarksville, Tennessee, which is a college-age/young guys and gals from Fort Campbell Army Base type establishment, I started the change...not on purpose, but I dropped some of the blue material that I had developed that was staple stuff for me, and I killed. I did cleaner stuff, and as luck would have it, there were actually some older people in the room, sitting front row, and I think they appreciated the cleaner stuff, although I need to ween myself off the &quot;F&quot; word, which I think I use some times way too gratuitously. People have been responding to me better off stage as well, and last night folks actually sent me drinks on stage. I&apos;m not the kind of comic who gets drinks sent to him on stage, let me tell you....and it seems that I&apos;m venturing into new water, an area that I&apos;ve never been before, and the possibilities are really electrifying me.
I&apos;ll be honest, I wish I could get on stage RIGHT NOW, because I&apos;m that jazzed up about standup. I have five shows this weekend, so I&apos;ll get my fix. And I&apos;m looking forward to it, to be sure.

 Should I Stay or Should I Go? (The Clash) 
Posted on 04/02/2007 at 03:02 AM
Should I quit comedy? An interesting question, is it not?
I&apos;m at the Radisson Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana, just a stone&apos;s throw from Chicago. I headlined this weekend at the Wisecracker&apos;s comedy club located in the hotel, and just before I was about to take the stage for the Saturday late show, the ticket booth girl announces to me &quot;We need your address because we have to Fed-Ex your check because the checks are locked up and we can&apos;t give it to you.&quot;
Uh, no fucking way, thank you very much.
So basically I&apos;m stuck here until Monday morning when the accountant gets in, and to put a silver lining on the dark cloud, they comped me a hotel room for my trouble. That&apos;s good, because I had two days off before my next gig in Clarksville, Tennessee, so there was one less night off I had to pay for a hotel room. Still, questions abound...when the accountant left for the day on Friday, did he think there wasn&apos;t going to be any comedians for the weekend? Did no one else have keys to the office or the safe combination or whatever access they needed to have? Couldn&apos;t they have just paid me cash and ripped up the checks, or marked them &quot;For Deposit Only,&quot; and deposited them? Maybe these answers are too simple, and an indication of the reason I don&apos;t work in a corporate setting.
So they comped me a room that runs $150 a night, for which I shouldn&apos;t really complain, and I was able to use the laundry facilities on premises to do my laundry as I&apos;m in the middle of a two-week tour. My plan is now to meet the accountant in the morning, pick up my check, waltz it over to a bank that is virtually across the street, and get my money. Seems like an awful lot of trouble for something that should be an easy transaction, huh? Oh, well, I don&apos;t pretend to know everything about the business.
I should mention that this facility is hooked on to a huge theatre, the Star Plaza, which has played host to some of the biggest entertainers in show business, among them Jay Leno, George Carlin, ZZ Top and B.B. King. This weekend, the theatre hosted the 70&apos;s Soul Jam, featuring The Stylistics, The Chi-Lites and others. It seems that whenever I&apos;m here, they have some sort of Motown revue, and that&apos;s cool, but some of the bands don&apos;t have all their original members because of death or retirement. One upcoming show they&apos;re going to have The Isley Cousins and opening act Kool and His Friend.
So I had a long talk with my sister today, about 90 minutes, and she basically asked me to think about what I&apos;m doing. I&apos;m 40 years old, running around the country for what amounts to bullshit money, I have no savings nor own any real property, and live basically check-to-check. And while I don&apos;t plan on maintaining this level forever, I&apos;m moving up, although slowly, the fact of the matter is that only 5% (if that) of the folks in the comedy industry really get to the point where they&apos;re making really good money. The rest of us sweat and toil and get in our cars and shlep for 9 hours to take the stage in Nowhere, USA for a couple hundred dollars and lodging. Is that fair to my wife, to be gone so much, is it fair for my child, to provide in such a meager manner? Is it selfish to continue pursuing my dream after so many years of investment, or am I running after smoke and cheating my family? If I left comedy, what would I do? Would I be a good employee in a straight job? Would I be able to concentrate on that job without looking out the window all the time? Would a company want to take a chance on a guy who&apos;s 40 years old, been doing comedy for half of that, and proudly carries a two-year college degree in Liberal Arts? What am I suited to do? These are the questions that keep me awake some nights. I feel things are beginning to change, and that scares me a lot, because I feel like I only know one thing.

 One (Creed) 
Posted on 03/27/2007 at 09:49 AM
Political correctness is for the birds. Stereotypes are true. To be fair, some are more true than others, but if they weren&apos;t true at all, they wouldn&apos;t have gotten started now, would they?
I worked this week in San Antonio, Texas, at the Rivercenter Comedy Club, which is mostly a tourist venue. On the weekend, however, the locals come out, and a good percentage of the local population is Hispanic, specifically Mexican-American.
Now, right out of the gate, I do a joke that plays on the stereotype of Mexicans riding around in cars with as many Chicanos squeezed into them as possible. I&apos;ve never personaly witnessed this, but the stereotype seemed so pervasive, I wound up writing a joke about it (I am, at my core, an evil white man...I suppose). I didn&apos;t want to be an asshole (or be rejected) by doing such a joke, especially since it ocurred so early in my show, so on Wednesday and Thursday, I cut the joke out.
In retrospect, it was a chickenshit move.
On Friday, I was walking around and happened to be near the mall where the comedy club is, and I saw a car pull up, and several Hispanic teens came spilling out, and when I say several, what I mean to say is that it was like a fucking clown car....they just kept coming! I was pretty sure there were one or two in the glove box and maybe one huddled in the well where the spare tire was supposed to be.
It was then that I arrived at this epiphany...perhaps truth is a defense. And more than that, if I can&apos;t do a joke in front of *everyone,* then perhaps I shouldn&apos;t do the joke at all.
So I broke the joke out. In front of a large group of Hispanics. And it killed.
Now, I didn&apos;t just come out of nowhere with it...I warmed up the crowd with enough material that they got to know me, and I pride myself on being very soft in my stage presence...I&apos;m not confrontational, by turns I think I&apos;m almost cuddly. So I&apos;m getting them to like me, and then BOOM! And it was like magic. The truth of the comment was so pervasive, it became a thing of beauty, and they ate it up with a spoon.
I&apos;m not advocating the use of ugly stereotypes...certainly, every ethnic group has traits that are not flattering and there&apos;s no use to dredge them up, especially when you&apos;re not a member of the group; which by the way, seems to be a blanket permission to use those stereotypes, and isn&apos;t that just as inherently wrong? But I also think that it&apos;s phony and false to pretend that differences don&apos;t exist where they clearly do, and that&apos;s probably more racist than pointing out areas in which our ethnic extractions diverge.
My wife is half African American, and I certainly comment on that. The jokes (and there&apos;s only two of them) are both stereotyping, and never fail to get the laugh. I joke about being Italian and use maybe half a dozen jokes in that area. So if it&apos;s o.k. in those instances, it&apos;s only o.k. because the stereotypes are mild (and true) and the jokes are presented in the interest of fun, told with a smile and not with a scowl, and that is where comics have room to err. If a joke is told with a matter-of-factness, a smugness or an air of superiority, it will be met with rejection and anger (instead of the laughter that was intended). All the while when I unfurled my little standup comedy act in front of ethnically generic audiences, I figured I was getting laughs because of ignorant white people enjoying the unfair portrayal of ethnic groups.
God must have had a plan when he made us all colors and many languages and traits and allowed different cultures to develop...I think it was to teach us something, and I may have learned a little this week.

 Movies (Alien Ant Farm) 
Posted on 03/23/2007 at 01:58 AM
First of all, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU to everyone who wrote and called me with condolences about my father. I guess I&apos;ve been very lucky that I come from a small family so I haven&apos;t had to deal with a lot of death in my time, so I&apos;m somewhat inexperienced when it comes to such matters. I always felt kind of &quot;phony&quot; when I offered condolences to others who had lost loved ones, but did it because it seemed like the thing to do. I have learned through this experience that the condolences really do help the grieving person get through the emotions and feelings, and while I will miss my father until I join him in the afterlife, I don&apos;t feel so alone. It was really quite humbling to see the number of people in my extended &quot;comedy family&quot; who took the time to write or call, and each one of you is a gift from God, as far as I&apos;m concerned. I love you and cherish you.
I&apos;m in San Antonio, Texas, and just completed the second of seven shows this weekend. So far, it&apos;s nothing special, a lot of tourists and sort of small attendances, but things ought to pick up over the weekend. In the meantime, I&apos;m keeping myself busy by beginning work on a screenplay. I&apos;ve never written one, so I&apos;m doing it to see if I have any kind of flair for it. If I do, I might be able to make some money at it, which would be good for my family, and if not, at least it will keep me out of trouble.
I had a couple of ideas for stories, but there are movies that came out recently that were very much like the movies I had planned to write, one was &quot;Invincible&quot; and the other was &quot;We Are Marshall.&quot; It was encouraging to me that I was thinking along the same lines in terms of telling a story that Hollywood judged worthwhile to make a film about, but at the same time, it showed me that I have to work a little harder to be original and hopefully still tell a good story with good characters that isn&apos;t so far off the beaten path of what Hollywood churns out that no one would want to take a chance on it. The story I&apos;m writing is loosely based on the real life circumstance that my wife and I go through living in our inner-city neighborhood. My wife is the secretary for our local neighborhood association, and it&apos;s very frustrating for her because the meetings are poorly attended because most of the folks in our area are renters that have been placed by social services and they just don&apos;t care about improving the neighborhood because they have other challenges to face, or are just numbed by drugs and alcohol.
Anyway, my story is about a guy who finds himself in just such a neighborhood and he steps up and makes a difference to the people who live there by giving them hope. In my fondest dreams, the film will do the same thing for city neighborhoods that the movie &quot;John Q&quot; did for universal health care. Uh, actually, universal health care is still nonexistent, so maybe I should hope for more. I don&apos;t have any fancy scriptwriting software, so I&apos;m doing this the old-fashioned way, starting out with an outline and then fleshing out the scenes. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m very strong at dialogue, and all of the characters are probably going to sound like me, and I don&apos;t think that will be very good for the script. I want the characters to sound good and organic, and not be sterotypes, and that&apos;s going to be the hardest part of this job. I think if I approach this project with the &quot;salami&quot; technique, I should be able to knock it off in a year. The salami technique is basically slicing up a big project (like salami on a meat slicer) into smaller increments, and dealing with them on a daily basis a little at a time, like eating an entire salami by having a couple of sandwiches each day until it&apos;s gone. I guess the problem is that after consuming an entire salami, you&apos;d be sick of it, and if I can&apos;t finish a screenplay without getting tired of writing, I&apos;m basically screwed.
I&apos;m going to call it a night in a little bit and get a good night&apos;s rest....I&apos;ve got a project and a full head of steam, and I want to really get up tomorrow and write some more and get into this thing deep before I get bored with it....I think I might have some low-level ADHD or something, and that&apos;s no good for a writer working in a long-form structure.
Good night all.

 Dance With My Father (Luther Vandross) 
Posted on 03/18/2007 at 05:05 AM
My father passed away about an hour ago. I got the word from my sister who was down with him in Florida about 3:15 in the morning. I was still up, partially due to the adrenaline from two shows tonight at the Just Jokin&apos; Comedy Cafe in Lima, Ohio, and partially due to a long phone conversation with my wife Pamela about trying to get down to see my Dad in Florida.
Dad was lingering for the last week or so, having taken no food and little water. Cancer had withered him away to skin and bones, and he was moving from states of consciousness according to my sister Nickki, who was spending as much time with him as she could. I was calling her and my mother, who is also down in Florida, a couple of times a day to be updated on Dad&apos;s condition, which was grim, being stage 4 cancer.
I&apos;ve been crying on and off the last few months, since the word came down that the pain Dad was feeling in his back wasn&apos;t just a slipped disc, but cancer that had invaded his bones. He had tumors on both lungs, too, and his first tumor was removed four years ago....we thought he was out of the woods, then, and little did we know that cancer was going to continue to be a ticking time bomb.
I scheduled work in Florida each year so that I could go see him, and after the stage four prognosis, I made a trip down in January. We had a good visit, and he was still alert and spry and full of everything that made him Dad to me. I was due to visit again this May and into June, and I&apos;ll still go and do the work and spend time with my mother in between gigs, but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be filled with pain that he won&apos;t be there.
I promised a eulogy in my last blog, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll sleep very well tonight as the news is cold and even though I knew it was coming, I guess I really wasn&apos;t as prepared for it as I thought I was. I&apos;m reacting the way I did when my grandmother passed away...I felt distant for a long time, and then the emotions came all at once and I cried until my throat hurt. So I&apos;m going to eulogize my father and hope that it brings me enough peace to sleep, and ready myself for the pain that tomorrow will bring.
Ralph Tetta was the only son of Adele Tetta and a man we would never know. My grandmother didn&apos;t speak of my grandfather, and no one seems to have any details, and I wonder if Dad isn&apos;t learning who his father was in whatever Great Beyond comes after life. My father married Linda Donroe and had three children, Ralph William, Christopher Joseph and Nickki Adele. As is the Italian tradition, we were named after family members, William being my mother&apos;s father, and of course, I being the oldest son, was named after my Dad.
My father was defined by his work, that is, that he always worked and took great pride in working hard and being a good provider. He was born of a generation that was defined more by their lack than their abundance, and he worked to make sure that his family never suffered that lack. He was not a social animal, but what friends he had more than likely were co-workers or people he knew in a professional capacity. My grandmother, who lived with us all of but the last few years of her life, was a very private person, and my father respected her privacy, and entertaining at the house was something that almost never happened.
My Dad was a closet comic; and in the years after he retired, we got along better than we ever had. I delighted in telling him jokes, making him laugh, and once I got a bead on his sense of humor, it was easy as pie. My father worked in movie theaters when he was young, and he enjoyed movies more than anything. When cable television was offered in our neighborhood, he subscribed immediately, and started videotaping movies. Right now, at his house in Florida, he has literally over a thousand movies on tape, many of dubious extraction. My father was not above watching a B-movie adventure or a Japanese karate film, he loved them all.
When I started doing comedy, he broke my balls a little bit, telling me that I was getting laughs because the audiences didn&apos;t know any better, and asking me when I was going to get a real job. One day, I visited him at his office, and there was a newspaper article that featured me thumbtacked to the corkboard. For all the trash talk, he was really proud of me, and wanted to show me off to his co-workers. He supported me and let me do what made me happy, although I&apos;m pretty sure he would have rather seen me get into some field of work that was more steady, and perhaps offered some benefits.
My father was a shipping clerk, and later a shipping supervisor, for a company called Rochester Envelope, which during the go-go 1980&apos;s was chopped up, sold off and moved around to various companies, to the point that when my father retired in 1995, he was getting pension checks from three different places. A blue-collar guy in a white-collar job, he never wore a tie to work, and some summer days, if it was really hot, he&apos;d wear Bermuda shorts to work. And even though he was a manager, he never really carried himself like a manager, he was more like the one working stiff who outranked all the other working stiffs, so they had to do what he said. One year, the union went on strike, and my Dad was working 12-hour shifts to keep the plant running. I went to work with him one morning, as I needed his car for some appointment during the day, and I was going to pick him up later. We approached the picket line and I watched in horror as these large men were pounding on cars, screaming and swearing at people crossing the picket line, and I was worried about getting pulled out of the car and beaten up or something. My father rolled his window down, and a big guy with a black beard looked in and yelled back over his shoulder, &quot;It&apos;s Ralph! Let him through!&quot; and nothing happened to us at all. I don&apos;t know if they did that out of respect or friendship, but Dad grew in my eyes that day from ten feet tall to just over 12.
Last year, I got hired to do comedy for a group called the Transportation Club, which is a group of Rochester businessmen who deal in trucking, shipping and related endeavors. Quite a few people remembered my father, even though he had been retired for ten years or so at that point, and one guy told me a story that I remember my father telling, but it was better hearing someone else tell it, because heroes sound less heroic when they&apos;re telling their own stories. As the story goes, the company was all aflutter from a new team of managers that were coming in, and they were going to install these different systems to make things run better, and they collected all of the supervisors in a meeting room to brief them on the basis of their new style of operation. After about 10 minutes, my father got up, walked to the back of the room and got himself a cup of coffee, lit a cigarette, and stood in the back while the managers were making their presentations. One of the managers took umbrage that Dad wasn&apos;t still sitting with the group, and said &quot;Ralph, do you have any comments?&quot; And my father, who was pretty unimpressed with what he heard, said &quot;I&apos;ve been here 30 years and I&apos;ve seen &apos;em come and I&apos;ve seen &apos;em go.&quot; which got the big laugh, because obviously, these guys were not the first crew who came in and thought they were going to reinvent the wheel. I guess I must get my disrespect for authority from my Dad, or at least the lack of good sense to keep that disrespect to myself.
My father was a collector, never threw anything out. It wasn&apos;t until he had really established himself and I guess felt safe in his wealth that he finally threw away the stack of miscellaneous lumber that was stored in the eaves of our garage. I remember helping him carry old moldings, planks and dowels out to the curb, and I know a part of him feared that he would someday need one of those pieces of wood and he would have to go into a hardware store and pony up the money for something he already had and threw away. He collected good things, too, like comic books, and I grew up in a house with literally thousands of comics that he sold in one fell swoop. I used to go down into the basement where he kept them stored, in large wooden shelves with doors that he tried to lock, but I figured out how to unscrew the hinges and get in anyway. I would pull piles of comics out and dump them into a big rolling U.S. Mail bin (not sure how we got our hands on that) that we used for laundry (big family, lots of laundry), and sit in a pile of sheets and blankets, warm from the dryer, and read the comics for hours. Sometimes I would drape a sheet over the top of the bin, and nobody would find me for a long time and once they thought I ran away from home. I became a comic collector myself, putting my first collection together when I was eight, first collecting a few books that I kept in a Dunkin Donuts box (they fit perfectly if you lay them flat), and then later a paper shopping bag, then finally into the acid-free boxes that comic shops happily sell you for $9.95 or more. Currently, I have thousands, and it&apos;s all because of my Dad.
Dad collected coins, too, and later in life, stamps. Somewhere along the line, he acquired our dogs, two miniature poodles named Alex and Giddy. We always had pets, mostly cats, when I was growing up, but those two lasted the longest and made the greatest impact on our lives. The dogs used to like to hop up on the back of one of our sofas in the living room, which was up near a bay window facing out on our street. The dogs were clearly visible to anyone walking down Seneca Parkway or Dewey Avenue (we lived on the corner), and even though the dogs weren&apos;t related, they looked (and acted) like twins. My Mom and Dad would walk them after dinner up and down Seneca Parkway, which had a big meridian filled with trees (a dog&apos;s best friend) and I&apos;m sure that Dad liked the attention of our neighbors who loved to comment on how cute our dogs were (they were very cute). Later, when I got a cat (SnaxTheCat), my Dad would take care of him when I was on the road, and Snax would hop up on Dad&apos;s shoulders and rub his face on the earpiece of my father&apos;s glasses and purr. Snax is very affectionate, and again, I&apos;m sure my Dad liked the attention.
My father was never a sports fan of any kind, never played catch with me and rarely came to any plays or school events that I was in. My mother would come out and support, and my father would stay home with Grandma, who was sure that if everyone left her alone, she would die. My father grilled steaks on Sunday, outside, even if it was raining or snowing. My father loved sandwiches from Amiel&apos;s Roast Beef in Rochester, and hated moving down south because the supermarkets and food generally sucked down there in comparison to home. My father worked five days a week at Rochester Envelope, later Boise Cascade, later MailWell Envelope, and then on Saturday, he worked at a small supermarket next to our house called Dewey Super, cutting coldcuts from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. My father loved James Bond films, probably because he got the women, and had nice cars and gadgets.
Our house on Seneca Parkway was a double, with two addresses. We lived in 400, right on the corner, and my father rented out 396 to a variety of tenants. One group of tenants we called &quot;the girls.&quot; I was about 10 years old then, and the three girls who were roommates next door were of college age or maybe a little older. One night, one of the girls&apos; ex-boyfriends came around and started yelling. My father and I went next door and lo and behold, the ex-boyfriend had a gun. My father sent me back home next door while he talked to the guy. I didn&apos;t go home as told, I stayed in the back hallway and listened. He told the guy &quot;Listen, she doesn&apos;t want to be with you, it&apos;s over, and waving a gun around isn&apos;t going to change anything. Now the cops are on their way, so get the hell out of here. You don&apos;t want to go to jail, and you aren&apos;t going to shoot anybody.&quot; The guy calmed down and left, and then Dad came back home, poured a shot of Anisette, and shook for an hour. It was one of the bravest things I ever saw, and that&apos;s when Dad became ten feet tall, by the way.
My father loved comic books, as I mentioned before, but he really, REALLY enjoyed the ducks. His favorite was Scrooge McDuck, I guess, because he kept all of his money in a big vault, and he could dive into a pool of coins without getting a concussion. Dad also liked Jack Benny, I think because of the &quot;cheap&quot; jokes, and even though Dad wasn&apos;t cheap, he certainly thought a few minutes more than normal when he was making a purchase. He never skimped when it came to his family, and as a kid, I never remember going without anything that I wanted or needed.
But my favorite memory that I&apos;d like to share isn&apos;t a memory at all, it&apos;s a story. When I was first born, I was very small. I was about six weeks premature, and I weighed about four pounds. My father worked during the day and my mother worked at night, so when Dad would come home from work, he would feed me dinner. He bragged for years about how much baby food I would suck down, a jar of meat, a jar of vegetables, a jar of dessert, and big bottle of milk. There is a picture we have in a family photo album of my father holding me and giving me a bottle, and there&apos;s a look on his face that I never fully understood until my daughter was born a few years ago; it&apos;s the look of a man looking at his child and knowing that he would jump in front of a bullet for that child, like he wants to take that child&apos;s hand and show him every bit of good in the world, shelter him from every bit of bad in the world, and teach him everything there is to know. It&apos;s the look of a man who loves his child more than he loves himself, and I have that look now for my daughter.
My father has requested to be cremated, and the ashes scattered. There won&apos;t be a memorial, or a service for him, but he will be remembered in the lives he has created and nurtured and shaped and molded, my sister and brother and I.
I love you, Dad. You did a great job, and to your credit, you did it without a father to show you how it was done.
Rest in peace.

 Near Wild Heaven (R.E.M.) 
Posted on 03/15/2007 at 09:26 AM
Hello and good morning, gentle readers. I&apos;m up and about, getting ready to shower and pack and head off to Lima, Ohio, for a week of shows with headliner Mike Armstrong. He&apos;s the ex-cop from the Bob and Tom Show, and I&apos;m looking forward to working with him. The crowds should be excellent and the reviews from this club are that they treat the comics well, but they&apos;re new so a lot of that may change if history holds true. I don&apos;t mean to be so negative, but it seems that once clubs get their feet wet, the first thing that goes are the amenities afforded to the talent. For now, I&apos;m just going to concentrate on being professional, doing the best show I can and giving them no reason to look at comics in an unflattering light.
My father took a turn for the worst over the weekend, and he&apos;s been moved to a hospice house. He&apos;s there for 24-hour care, and my sister Nickki and her husband Dennis drove down from Raleigh to be with him and help mom. Things aren&apos;t looking well, they tried to give him a bath the other day, and with all the pain medicines he&apos;s on, he &quot;fought&quot; the nurses, and it wasn&apos;t really him being disagreeable, it was jus the body&apos;s reaction to the coming death. When I heard about it, the first words that came to my mind were &quot;death rattle,&quot; and I guess that&apos;s not so far from the truth. I&apos;m scared for my father, and hope he passes quietly and without any pain. I hate to think of him suffering. His last wishes are to be cremated, and I have to sign an order to have that done because of the Ted Williams case a few years ago. My father and mother are divorced, so it&apos;s up to myself and my two siblings to sign the order to have a cremation done. I went yesterday to have the document notarized but with no date, so that the document would be ready when the time came, but they can&apos;t notarize an undated document so I have to carry it with me to Lima and if the situation occurs, I will have to sign and fax it from the road.
I kept myself busy by working on my CD&apos;s yesterday. I have two shows on CD, and they aren&apos;t edited into tracks, but I listened to them and put a track listing on the stickers, which I think will be helpful to folks who want to buy something after the show, they can pick and choose which CD they want of the two based on a particular bit that they may have enjoyed. I found out that there&apos;s a little more overlap than I thought previously, but there is also a lot of material that I don&apos;t even do on stage anymore, and some stuff that I might want to ressurect in the future. It was a good bit of business to get into all the way around, I definitely needed a small project to distract me from the goings-on.
Saturday in Laurium, Michigan was fun, I bummed around the hotel, venturing out only to grab lunch and a newspaper. The show was decently attended, although not as packed as I would have hoped. The folks enjoyed Chili and myself, and we sold a bunch of CD&apos;s afterwards and signed autographs. It was good to be all finished up on a Saturday after only one show...I wanted to get back to the hotel and try to get some sleep for the big 14-hour drive home. We were back at the hotel by 11:00 P.M., but I still didn&apos;t manage to get to sleep until 2 A.M. And then of course, the bad news was that the daylight savings time robbed me of an hour and when I woke up, I was already late. I wound up leaving at 10:30 (time adjusted) and made it home just a little before Midnight, and Pam and Harmony were still up so we had a little birthday cake and I sang to my daughter, and then went to sleep before she opened her birthday present from me. To be honest, Pam or her mother bought the thing for her on my behalf, I still don&apos;t know what was in the thing. Pammey got upset with me that I didn&apos;t stay up, but I was really exhausted and couldn&apos;t keep my eyes open anymore.
I hosted open mic Tuesday night and it was pretty good. I came up with a good Aldi&apos;s joke, about how lousy the products they have are. I said that I went in and bought caffeine-free Red Bull. The people just looked at me, and I&apos;m pretty sure the joke is good, but I&apos;ll need to test it out some more before I pass judgement.
O.k., I really need to get packing and hit the road. Have a good one; I&apos;ve been keeping a picture of my father and me up on my myspace page (it&apos;s at www.myspace.com/rabidralph if you&apos;re interested) and I&apos;ll keep it up there until he passes, at which point I plan on putting up a journalized eulogy, because he&apos;s chosen not to have a service. Dad is an interesting guy, and I want to be able to share some of the things about him that made him special.

 Party (Boston) 
Posted on 03/10/2007 at 04:05 PM
Greetings from Laurium, Michigan, way, way up in the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of Michigan. If you look at a map and look way to the west of the top part, there&apos;s a little part that looks like a cowlick.
That&apos;s where I am right now.
The wind is whistling on the shores of Lake Superior, and I&apos;m just a few miles away from where the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald happened. It&apos;s not just a snappy ballad by Gordon Lightfoot, it&apos;s an account of a real shipwreck that killed 29 men. This is iron mining area, and much of Michigan and Wisconsin&apos;s economies in the 19th and 20th century depended on the industry. I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s still so much the case, but they tell me that there are still vast reserves still in the ground, waiting to be plowed up and exploited.
This week&apos;s leg of the Ralph Tetta International Comedy Tour takes me to this wind-swept college town of Houghton, Michigan, just 14 miles south of Laurium where the gig is at the Irish Times Pub. It&apos;s a nice little area as far as road gigs go, and I&apos;m sure in the Summer and Fall, this place is probably hopping, but right now in the Winter, there are many other places I&apos;d rather be. The locals have a good sense of humor about the snow, though, and as you drive up route 41 into Houghton and into the Michigan Tech area, there are snow sculptures in front of the frat houses of all kinds; castles, six-foot-high Greek letters, and I even saw one pyramid made of ice blocks. It&apos;s interesting to see how people cope with inclement weather.
I left Thursday night amids much crying and gnashing of teeth, piling into the car around 6 or 7 at night and making my way across Western New York and into Canada. I crossed the border into Michigan at Port Huron and got a grilling from the U.S. customs agent regarding my profession.
&quot;So you&apos;re a comedian, huh? Well, go ahead.&quot;
He&apos;s still holding my driver&apos;s license and birth certificate, so I assume he&apos;s not telling me to go ahead and drive into Michigan.
&quot;Well, sir, I don&apos;t really tell jokes. I do a monologue.&quot;
He didn&apos;t really understand, or at the very least, he understood but wasn&apos;t going to let me go. I gave him a one-liner which didn&apos;t seem to impress him much, but I wasn&apos;t going to take the chance to piss him off. I could do one stupid joke and with my luck, have that be the hot-button issue that drives him off the wall every day. Finally, he let me in, and I&apos;m thinking I never went through so much trouble just to re-enter my country of citizenship. What must it be like for the Jews trying to escape the wrath of Hitler during the early days of World War II? Thank God they have a rich tradition of storytelling and a good natural sense of humor or they never would have made it.
&quot;Hey Juden! Vere are you going?&quot;
&quot;Vas, I&apos;m just going over dere, not for long, just to look, I von&apos;t touch, I&apos;ll be back in a minute. I&apos;m just goink for a quick nosh, and I&apos;m taking my vife and everytink I own, just for fun. Dot&apos;s a beautiful jacket, vat is dat, a condor? Dot&apos;s a tough bird, tastes like chicken, though. I know a good deli dot meks a good condor soup, very goot, not kosher, but who&apos;s to know? If God&apos;s not asking, I&apos;m not telling!&quot;
&quot;O.K., go, just shut up already!&quot;
So I got to Saginaw, Michigan around 2 in the morning, and I happened to have a free night&apos;s stay certificate from Motel 6 as a make-good for the problem I had in Fredericksburg, Virginia a few weeks ago, and I got a room, and just as I was settled in and ready to go to sleep, I realized that this was the Motel 6 that a comic, Polish Thunder, got robbed at after a gig. I double checked the deadbolt on the door and slept just fine.
The drive on Friday was a bear. I made my way up to the Mackinac Bridge, and that&apos;s when the fun began. It was three hours up to the bridge, and then easily five hours across the U.P., through woods and pine trees and forests and even though the roads were dry, the speed limit was 55 mph most of the way and it just seemed to take forever. I got to the hotel around 6 PM and checked in with the radio guys from the WOLF 97.7 FM to let them know I was in town, and they told me the show was at 9 PM rather than 8. I treated myself to a 45-minute nap and then showered and shaved for the big show.
Headliner &quot;Chili&quot; Challis and I carpooled to the gig, which was 20 minutes away and even though we both had directions, they were different and inconsistent, and it was only through the fact that you can only drive so far before you hit water up here that wefound our way. Our mc, Tim, was very funny and set the show up well. I had a good show, and then Chili absolutely killed, even though it was a pretty small crowd, maybe around 40 people or fewer. Tonight should really be good, I&apos;m looking forward to it.
Tomorrow&apos;s my daughter&apos;s third birthday, and I&apos;m probably not going to get home in time to enjoy much of it. I&apos;ve got the daylight savings time thing pitching the clocks forward an hour, so I&apos;m behind the 8-ball before I even go to sleep. Then there&apos;s the small matter of the 14 hours it&apos;s going to take to get home, and if I&apos;m well-rested enough to get up early, I might make it home before 10 PM. Maybe Pam will save me some cake. I talked to Harmony on the phone today and she&apos;s getting so big and talkative and confident and I just love her so much that it&apos;s going to hurt not to be there to sing Happy Birthday, but hopefully I&apos;ll be in cell signal range (the U.P. is not know for their concentration of cell phone towers) so I can sing along. Then I&apos;ll sing &quot;Cats in the Cradle&quot; in the car and cry for ten minutes.
But this is the life I signed up for, worked half my life for, and now I have it. Lessons learned, father.

P.S. I don&apos;t usually tip my hand and mention where I get the song titles that I use to head my blogs with, I prefer to let the reader figure them out, but the inclusion of the song title &quot;Party&quot; by Boston is an homage to lead singer Brad Delp, who I just learned passed away. The double meaning of &quot;Party&quot; is also for my daughter, Harmony, who is having her third birthday party tomorrow. Thank you again for reading my journal, and party on.

 My City Was Gone (Pretenders) 
Posted on 03/07/2007 at 07:49 AM
Good morning beloved friends and readers...thought I&apos;d check in while dealing with a small bout of insomnia brought on by stress, caffeine, and the inability of maintaining an even bedroom temperature. It was 7 degrees out last night, and getting the bedroom just the right warmth for sleeping was driving me crazy...I was either freezing or lying in a pool of my own sweat, neither a good combination for sawing logs.
I hosted open mic at the Comix Cafe again last night, killer sets by Danny Viola and a new guy named Trent, everyone else sort of flopped around like fish up there, including me. I wasn&apos;t trying to phone it in, but I didn&apos;t have much new to say, and didn&apos;t want to beat the dead horse of my old material. I had some new political stuff, but the crowd was young-ish, and my experience is that they just don&apos;t care about such things, so I kept it short and started bringing on the acts.
It&apos;s taken me two days to recuperate from Saturday and Sunday...I finished up my two shows in Charleston, West Virginia with headliner Robert York, and after the second show, I got settled up, packed the car and started northward. I decided to go up through Ohio rather than tempt the mountains of West Virginia and the speed traps that lay in waiting at the bottom of each hill. I hit patches of snow which wasn&apos;t horrible but was mostly annoying. A mere nine hours later, I was in my bed, resting up with a mighty four hours of sleep before getting ready for a benefit show at Nazareth Academy.
The benefit show was put together for a guy named Tom Sciolino, you can read about him at www.CaringBridge.com I did some standup comedy and it went pretty well, it was quite a mixed audience, people in attendance from toddlers up to grandparents. The trick with shows like these is to be clean, and interesting enough to keep the parents focused without talking over the heads of the children. I did some local material, capping on Wegmans supermarkets, talking about our heavy snowfall and then did some tried and true Halloween material, which is money in the bank. I think doing some Amish stuff was either over their heads or they just didn&apos;t like it, but I shouldn&apos;t have tested them...I went on after the intermission, and by the time I hit the stage, folks had been at the show for over two hours. I should have realized that less would have been more, but I was too exhausted to make that judgement. I guess I don&apos;t have to tell you that I slept well that evening.
So now I&apos;m just enjoying a few days off before heading up to the cold wasteland of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan....I spend so much time up there it seems that I should just build a house and stay there, but I don&apos;t like pasties. If you don&apos;t know what they are, check it out here -&gt; Pasty - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. I&apos;m doing two shows in Laurium, Michigan with headliner &quot;Chili&quot; Challis, a comic who I&apos;ve been paired with quite a lot these past two years. He&apos;s a veteran Tonight Show writer and a cool guy, and I enjoy his company, so we ought to have some good fun. The week after, I&apos;m in Lima, Ohio, home of one of my first ever road gigs with headliner Mike Armstrong, and the week after, I get on a plane (a couple of them, actually) and head on down to San Antonio, Texas for a week at the Rivercenter Comedy Club with headliner Andy Campbell. I finish up the month doing a run through Michigan and down into Indiana doing my own headline show with a feature act to be named later, it seems, as the club website hasn&apos;t been updated and currently has no show information at all on it.
It&apos;s a 15-hour jaunt to the UP this week, so I&apos;ll be leaving early to make it, and probably catch a hotel room in Saginaw or something, just to break the trip up. I&apos;m good in the car, but not that good....15 hours is just ridiculous.
I&apos;m looking forward to Lima next week, because as I mentioned, it was the site of my first road gig. I took along comedy buddy Ricky Kingston and we headed off to the far post of Ohio, and like a rookie, I had no idea how long it was going to take to drive and we left far too late and really had to dog-leg it to make it to the show on time. It was a real experience, I tell you what. The next gig was further east, in Mansfield, Ohio, and Ricky and I stopped off at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton on the way home. &quot;When are we ever going to have a chance to do this again?&quot; Ricky said to me at the time. Well, 17 years later, I&apos;ve been through Canton so many times, I can&apos;t even count, but at the time, he was exactly right, because it was a long time before I went that way again. Good call, Ricky. We ate at a restaurant across the street, and I remember Ricky bugging out because they put coleslaw on his Reuben. It&apos;s a German thing, and his Irish Catholic ass had a coronary. Amazing the things the memory decides to store away. I remember the sandwich incident, but I can&apos;t do quadratic equations anymore.
O.K., I&apos;m getting back off to bed. I think the room may have cooled off enough to get some sleep finally. I&apos;ll check in with you later, thanks for reading.

 Mountain Song (Jane&apos;s Addiction) 
Posted on 03/03/2007 at 02:31 AM
Please send me back to Canada.
I finished out the week in Ottawa at Absolute Comedy on Sunday night, and then packed up and headed home. I got crushed by a snowstorm blowing off the east coast of Lake Ontario, but luckily the plows were out in force and cleared the roads enough that I didn&apos;t feel like I was gonna die every step of the way. After two days off, which didn&apos;t turn out to be two full days, either, it was back on the road again.
I hosted the open mic at Comix Cafe on Tuesday, and let me tell ya, it was definitely rugged in spots. The lowlight of the evening was a guy who none of us had seen before who insisted on being introduced as the Man of 1,000 voices, and he proceded to do hardly any impressions whatsoever. He also made the mistake of walking around the room before the show and interjecting himself into conversations and just generally being obnoxious (not a good thing to do in a room full of comics). We had a performance from a disgruntled guy who won a previous open mic contest at the club but never received a prize for his troubles, and he called out the club owner during his set, even though the owner is in Aruba. Good luck with that, my friend. Way to get yourself banned from the only club in town, ya douche.
Bright spots included the return of Mike Ruiz, who took advantage of some of his time off to write some new material, and also an appearance by Danny Viola, an old comedy buddy of mine from way back in the 1980&apos;s, who is getting back on the comedy horse. Pat Duffy also turned in a good performance, but I cut the list off at 12 performers to prevent the show from becoming a Bataan Death March of comedy...this precluded the inclusion of some of the latecomers who play that game that they will show up late to avoid having to go on early in the show, before the crowd is &quot;warmed up.&quot; It&apos;s a cheap move, and the reward from now on is you aren&apos;t getting on. A kid tried coercing me into putting him on later in the show because his friends weren&apos;t coming until later, and I told him to hope for a large number in the draw, or trade with someone. He wound up getting #9, which worked out for his purpose. See, you can enforce the rules and nothave to be the bad guy all the time.
I was going to leave for Tennessee right after the show, but I was too tired to pull it off, so I went home and got some sleep. I got up around 4 AM and hit the road shortly after 5. I was worrying about weather going through Erie, PA, where the winds off of Lake Erie usually bring lots of snow, but everything was cold and clear and the roads were salted and dry. I fueled up at the Hess Mart up the street from where I live, and I lamented to the cashier as she was loading up the case with fresh Krispy Kreme doughnuts that I wasn&apos;t allowed to have them. She informed me, &quot;But they&apos;re kosher!&quot; I guess she made me out to be a little more Jewish and a little less diabetic than I really am.
I made it into Pigeon Forge, Tennessee around 5 PM, and I felt weary from the long drive and short night&apos;s sleep. A 45-minute nap, a shave and a shower brought me up to speed, but nothing could prepare me for the show in Sevierville, Tennessee. The folks were as nice as could be, but I guess they turned off to me after I called them rednecks. Which to be honest, confused me, because they refer to themselves as rednecks all the time. I didn&apos;t know the &quot;N-word Rule&quot; applied to hillbillies, but I guess it does.
Now, if you&apos;ve never been to Pigeon Forge or any of the Smoky Mountain region of eastern Tennesse, I can describe it like this....Tennessee decided they wanted to have a Las Vegas, so they built one for themselves. It&apos;s a VERY touristy area, with theaters and T-shirt vendors, fast food restaurants, steakhouses and buffets by the dozens, flea markets, thrift stores and wax museums without number, amen. The club, the Triple C, was only in their second week of doing comedy, and I shared the bill with Big Ed Caylor, a Comedy Zone headliner and helluva nice guy. I met him in the lobby of the hotel we were staying in, and he had already been to the club, so I followed him. The Triple C was so far away from the hotel, I felt like I was back in Rochester again! Anyway, he put on a great show, but at one point, I turned to Joel Pace (one of the agents from Comedy Zone who was hanging out to help get the fledgling comedy venue off the ground) and said, &quot;His accent&apos;s so thick, I literally didn&apos;t understand a word of that last sentence he said.&quot; Joel laughed, and I&apos;m sure that there are certain things I say on stage that make the southern audiences crook their heads and think, &quot;What&apos;d he say?&quot; but that&apos;s just a hurdle that I&apos;m going to have to figure out if I&apos;m going to continue working in the southern United States.
Thursday in Prestonsburg, Kentucky was fun, as always, and I was working with headliner Robert York. Robert and I had just worked together in Charlotte, North Carolina, and he&apos;s always cool to hang out with. He&apos;s a top road dog comic, and puts on as many miles as I do in a week, if that&apos;s even possible. This morning, I was going to help him out with some transportation because he had to get some car repairs done, but he managed to find a place right near the hotel here in Charleston, West Virginia, so it didn&apos;t matter that I overslept and got a late start. I wasn&apos;t in a hurry, but still managed to draw my second speeding ticket of the year, this one in Kentucky. It also counts as my fifth ticket in the space of fifteen months. I&apos;ve been doing the road full-time for almost six years now, and only recently am I having problems with the officers of the law. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m doing anything differently, but I am driving a white car rather than my old periwinkle Toyota Corolla (R.I.P.), and I guess I look more guilty in it.
When I got to the Ramada Charleston, West Virginia, home of the Comedy Zone, I noticed that they were tearing up the joint with renovations. It turned out to be a good thing, because they moved the comedy show out of the old room (which was terrible) because it was filled with building materials. Instead, they put the show in another adjoining room, which was just the right size for the crowd that showed up tonight. I met Melissa, the manager of the club, in the lobby as I was hauling my luggage in, and she showed me the room where the show was going to be held, and the stage and tables hadn&apos;t been set up yet. I asked her where in the shoe-box shaped room the stage was going, and she told me it was going way in the back.
Now, since I&apos;ve left the employ of the Comix Cafe as a club manager, the most difficult thing for me to do is to mind my own business when I am the booked entertainment at another venue. I&apos;ve been told that I&apos;m just an employee and that it isn&apos;t my sandbox and I should keep my mouth shut, but I always hated the Charleston Comedy Zone&apos;s long setup, because I feel that the people way, way, way in the back are disconnected with the show and have a tendency to chit chat through the show, which makes it tough to perform. I convinced Melissa that putting the stage on the side wall and setting up tables around it in a horseshoe actually made the small room intimate, with every seat being a good view, and actually made it easier for her serving staff to dish out the drinks. Well, if the setup had been a problem or the show sucked or I got yelled at because I was wrong, I guess I wouldn&apos;t have gone to the trouble of telling you this story. The fact of the matter is that it worked great, and even though as a peformer I had to pan from side to side to include everyone into the performance, everyone loved the show and Robert kicked ass and I got a couple of applause breaks and we sold a butt-load of merchandise after the show, in a room where merchandise sales for me have always sucked. I&apos;m glad that I opened my mouth when I did.
Tomorrow we have two shows, and I&apos;ll probably stay mostly put here in the hotel room. I somehow managed to leave my hair mousse at the last hotel, so I have to go get some more, but there&apos;s a 7-11 two blocks up the road, so I&apos;ll get some there and then just hang out. I searched out a comic book store today, Cheryl&apos;s Comics&amp;Toys, and picked up some new stuff I&apos;d been wanting, so I have no shortage of reading material to keep me busy. I&apos;m going to have to get some rest, too, because I have to dogleg it back to Rochester overnight to make it to a benefit show I&apos;m doing on Sunday. The gig&apos;s at 2 PM, but I don&apos;t actually go on until 4. I&apos;ll still want to get there early to get the lay of the land, even though I&apos;m only doing 15 minutes worth of material. The show is at Nazareth High School, exactly 1.7 miles from my house...it is quite possibly the shortest distance away from home that I&apos;ve ever performed. I got my friend Julie Donofrio to volunteer her services, so she&apos;ll be going on earlier in the show, and they also have some musical performers getting involved. I feel good when I get to do these types of things, because it makes me remember what comedy was like when I first started, when I would get up in front of any audience and it wasn&apos;t always about the money. Sometimes I feel I&apos;ve lost that giddiness about my chosen profession, and I want it back badly. I want every show to be an event, and not just another day at the office. If I wanted a day job of drudgery, I would have stayed in grocery or stayed in school and became a lawyer, as my plan A formerly dictated.
Blessings and peace to you all, my friends.

 Iceman (Albert Collins)

Well, there&apos;s only one more show left to do here at Absolute Comedy before I get heading back home, which I understand is getting their fair share of snow due to a winter storm. The shows this week have been great and I&apos;ve been flourishing in the MC spot in the Canadian system. I was worried about &quot;fitting in&quot; with what the crowds expected, but it&apos;s been going great and there&apos;s been minimal backlash against me being an American....if anything, I&apos;ve been treated as some sort of an oddity and a commodity and been getting comments about my &quot;accent,&quot; which I think is hilarious. The crowds like me and the staff has been awesome.
I&apos;ve been sort of a homebody this week because it&apos;s been hellacious cold, and I&apos;m not scared of the cold, but there&apos;s nothing I really need that isn&apos;t within walking distance of the condo. There&apos;s a dynamite little deli around the corner called Di Rienzo&apos;s that makes excellent sandwiches and has all the groceries you could need, and one trip there has pretty much taken care of me for the week. Also, the condo is outfitted with wireless internet, so it&apos;s been a little too easy to just veg out and troll the internet as a substitute for actual real-life experiences.
The one thing that has been a hassle is staying in touch with Pam back home because the cell phone roaming charges to Canada are ridiculous. We&apos;ve been using the phone here and the house phone back home because we have a really good long distance plan, but that&apos;s not as portable as cell phones and Pam has her hands full with Harmony, so instead of three calls a day, we&apos;ve been making do with two calls every three days. Needless to say, I&apos;m as homesick as I could be. I&apos;ve been sharing quarters with Kevin Gasior, whose name I&apos;ve been pronouncing more French as the week goes on, and even though he&apos;s from Montreal, he&apos;s actually Polish. Kevin&apos;s a full-time working comic and a good guy, and we&apos;ve been having a great time talking business, comparing and contrasting the Canadian (specifically, Montreal where he&apos;s from) and American systems. The headliner, Rick Currie, is from Ottawa, so he hasn&apos;t been around meaning neither Kevin nor I had to suffer the indignities of the pull-out couch in the living room. Rick&apos;s been great to work with and he&apos;s a really clean, clever comic, and earlier in the week, Jason, the owner of the club, informed me that he likes to book a variety of comics on his bill, and it was my place to be the &quot;dirty&quot; guy. Well, I&apos;m fine with that, but it was a little funny to me because nobody&apos;s ever quite said it to me that way before. Tony in Niagara Falls told me that part of my appeal in his opinion was that my act is so unexpected because upon first seeing me, you don&apos;t imagine that the shocking things that I say will come out of my mouth. I prefer to think that any sort of smut that I do is playful enough, and I&apos;ve been toning it back a notch to fit in with the show. I&apos;m still the dirty guy, but I&apos;m not hitting them over the head with it.
I&apos;m looking forward to tonight&apos;s show, but it will be bittersweet because I&apos;ve had such a good time here in Ottawa that I won&apos;t want to leave the company of the crew that&apos;s been so nice to me, but I&apos;m only going to have a couple of days at home before I have to leave again for Tennessee, so I&apos;m going to have to get heading as soon as I can. I&apos;ve got about 4 1/2 hours home tonight, depending on the weather, and the show gets over about 9:30, so I should be on the road by 10:00 and home around 3 A.M. It&apos;s actually nice being this close to home for a change, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to have that luxury again for a little while.
Please be safe wherever you are, and talk to you later.

 Who Do You Love (George Thorogood) 
Posted on 02/22/2007 at 11:32 AM
I have been miserable about keeping up with this blog, so much is happening right now. I promised an update when I got to Dover, Delaware, and of course that didn&apos;t happen, so now I&apos;m wracked with Catholic guilt. Well, I&apos;m in the lovely condo in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and taking advantage of the wireless internet they have here, and I&apos;ll get you caught up as best I can.
My sister left Dad&apos;s house down in Florida and checked in via e-mail with my brother and me after she got home. Dad tried walking and actually was able to get up and walk to another chair about four feet away, and then he got brave and tried to move around with my mother&apos;s help and wound up falling down. Hospice brought him a walker to use, but he doesn&apos;t seem so keen on using it. I think he&apos;s afraid he&apos;ll go down again, and who could blame him for being scared? A chaplain visited him last week and spoke with him and even though he&apos;s never been so concerned with the matters spiritual, he was open to discussion and I thought that was good. This is a tough journey for Dad and everyone around him that loves him, and he&apos;s getting a good amount of visitors which I think is terrific, because he was always a very private person when I was growing up, not so prone to houseguests or entertaining, and I know in his heart, he loves attention as much as anyone but was prone to social awkwardness, which I seem to have inherited in some small way. I am so thankful that my sister made the trip and I imagine she&apos;ll be making another one before I get a chance to go in May. Dad needs to be around family as much as possible, I think, to make this transition comfortable. And frankly, I feel like a jackass talking about death as a &quot;comfortable transition,&quot; but I don&apos;t know if I could cope otherwise. It&apos;s definitely tough for me to handle and accept, and I&apos;m trying to just do the best I can between being concerned for my father and keeping up my day-to-day business.
As far as the tour goes, last week Dover was a trip. I played at the Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, and it was great from beginning to end. I rejected my printed driving directions in favor of instinct and wound up in the &apos;hood section of Dover...I have an uncanny ability to find the worst sections of a city the first time I visit; one time my I went with my father on a delivery to New York City and he wasn&apos;t sure which way to turn and I said &quot;turn right&quot; and we wound up in Spanish Harlem.
So I&apos;m driving through the hood and I found a comic book shop, and I went in and got some comics and directions, and come to find out I wasn&apos;t too far off base. I drove up on the hotel and there wasn&apos;t any parking that was even close, so I opted for the valet treatment (I was exhausted from the 7-hour drive) and they parked my car and took my bags up to my room....at last, the star treatment that I deserve! I grabbed a nap and got ready for the show, which turned out to be awesome. Usually casino shows can be a drag because you&apos;re playing in front of a comped crowd who&apos;s tired of losing at the slots, so they go take a break to get some ha-ha&apos;s, only they&apos;re not in a very good mood because they lost their ass. Not so here at the Comedy Zone, it was an actual pay-at-the-door show, and not only that but they packed the place and it was great! I started out with cleaner material because the crowd was a little older, but I didn&apos;t get my first good pop until I did some blue stuff, and then they went wild. Well, that was the end of that. I had a strong show after that and had a lot of good compliments after the show. After the show, Chris Wiles and I went and got something to eat, and then I showed him the nickel slots. They didn&apos;t have my current favorite, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; so I sat down at a Monopoly machine and promptly won $33.70. That may not seem like a lot until you figure that it&apos;s 674 nickels! And let&apos;s face it, I&apos;d rather be a small winner than a loser, big or small.
The next day was a short drive down to Salisbury, Maryland and I spent the day lounging around the hotel like a bum. I actually don&apos;t even remember what I did, but I do know that at one point I had the entire contents of my shoulder bag and luggage spread out all over the bed and bureau, and I think in my fevered mind, I was actually going to figure out things that I could eliminate or pack better to make it lighter. Long story short, it didn&apos;t happen. I have gotten a lot better in my packing habits for road trips, but I still think there&apos;s room for improvement.
The show at Salisbury at the Bottle Factory was a disaster for me. The audience were talkers, and they tagged every punchline with a comment of their own, which just threw my timing all to shit. They call their community &quot;Delmarva&quot; because it&apos;s the crossroads of Delaware, Maryland and Virgina so I tried to customize a joke to them...I talk about going to South Bend, Indiana where they call it &quot;Michiana&quot; because it&apos;s on the border between Michigan and Indiana, and I say that we don&apos;t do that anywhere else in the country....I&apos;ve never gone down south and had someone say &quot;Welcome to Tennesucky!&quot; Well, apparently, they do do that elsewhere, because this community does it, it&apos;s just not as well known. Well, from there, the floodgates were open and all they wanted to do was talk to me and tag every joke with insipid comments. One guy got in an argument with me about being a life-long Cleveland Browns fan and when I basically called his team cellar-dwellers, he started bringing up NFL championships from the 50&apos;s, shit like that. It was surreal. I tried treating them like educated Northeasterners, but they wound up being a bunch of dumb rednecks. Quite a few people gave me nice comments on the way out, and I was actually funny from time to time during the set, but nowhere near what I expect from myself. It was chilling for me and even the owner of the club had warned me what to expect beforehand and paid me with no reservations, I felt guilty taking the money because I really didn&apos;t feel like I did my job. I&apos;m still at that stage where I throw a show in the dumper once in a while, and even though it&apos;s fairly infrequent, it still feels dirty and horrible.
So now I&apos;m in Ottawa, and was raring to go all week to have a good show and wash the stink off of me from Maryland. I was supposed to host open mic at the Comix Cafe on Tuesday, but I got a flat tire and had to spend the evening at Dunn Tire getting two new hoofs for my trusty steed, actually my wife&apos;s trusty steed. I got up early and did some housework before packing and heading out, a little nervous about crossing Canadian customs with my working papers. I had different estimates from anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour, and the whole process took about 10 minutes total. My paperwork was in order and there were no problems, except I forgot to hit the currency exchange, leaving me with no money for meals or tips.
Wednesday night is Pro-Am night at Absolute Comedy, and I wound up drawing the closing spot. A very funny comic named Carrie Gaetz was the mc, and we wound up bonding after she screwed up my intro early in the show, forgetting my name and calling me &quot;Mr. Tetta,&quot; like that&apos;s gonna bother me....90 minutes later, we were the only two people in the room who remembered it. Anyway, some of the comics were good, and none of them were really bad, and I had a good time doing the pal-around thing. One of the comics, a kid named Brett, was doing his last set before leaving for Australia, and about everyone in the room was there to see him. Afterwards in the bar, there were a huge group of lesbians who I think were Brett&apos;s co-workers, and they were drinking like sailors and being quite bawdy, and Jason, the club owner, was hanging around with them, and at one point, one of the most severe butches gave him a tounge kiss and dipped him like a bitch. Like a true comic, he hammed it up but I think I would have thrown up in my neck a little bit if I was him.
So now that I&apos;ve had a good night&apos;s sleep and caught you up on things, I&apos;m about to go to the bank to obtain some coin of the realm so I can enjoy a semi-regular existence here in the Frozen North. I have the condo to myself until the other comic or comics get here, so I&apos;m also enjoying my privacy until that comes down. Until then, it&apos;s curling on TV all day and drinking milk from the carton if I want to. Hooray!

 Gimme Shelter (Rolling Stones) 
Posted on 02/16/2007 at 06:49 AM
I&apos;m awake and I don&apos;t wanna be. It&apos;s probably best that I am though, I got a long row to hoe today. And it takes me through the worst ball of red tape ever created, the Washington beltway, which just happens to wrap itself around the second worst ball of red tape ever created, the federal government.
I&apos;m doing a run for Comedy Zone this week, which started in Newport News, Virginia. The drive was about 10 or 11 hours, and I wasn&apos;t planning on leaving until darkness morning on Wednesday, when I started noticing weather reports about a big winter storm coming to hit Upstate New York. Not wanting to get caught in bad weather, I kissed my wife and daughter about a dozen times and loaded out of the house around 4 P.M., just an hour before the storm was due.
I drove through New York State down into Pennsylvania with little difficulty, and then the snow started to fall. It made the roads a little slick, but salt trucks and plows were already out, even though they were only poised for action in a lot of places, not wanting to salt the roads only to have a few inches of snow fall on them and spoil their work. I soldiered on through Harrisburg, PA and then made my way south into Baltimore.
Now, by this time, the roads were complete bullshit, and I was managing only a top speed of 40 miles per hour, and most of the time less than that. I made my way around Baltimore, determined to put Washington, D.C. behind me, which is hard to navigate through the perpetual rings of traffic on the outer beltway at the best of times. I got into D.C. around 1 A.M., tired but still awake thanks to a sugar-free Red Bull I pounded at a truckstop just outside of York, PA. The roads were fine going through Baltimore and most of Maryland, and by D.C., a freezing rain had started to fall which was more like sleet and started to really pile up on the roads.
I called ahead to a Motel 6 that I knew was in Fredericksburg, Virginia, figuring I would bed down for the night. The desk clerk told me there were vacancies, but there was no way I was going to be able to fish my Visa card out of my wallet to make the reservation while I was driving, and even though it was only 30 miles to the hotel, that was still an hour away due to the road conditions and I needed to keep driving.
When I got there, the desk clerk checked me in, handed me my key and sent me away. I drove to the end of the building and humped my bags up the stairs (my pet peeve is hotels without elevators....I&apos;ll walk the stairs but I can&apos;t hardly do it with the four bags I carry), and made my way to room 235. I slid my key in the lock, opened the door, and the deadbolt caught. For a second, I was considering trying to push the bolt open, obviously it had slid itself into place and was stopping me from opening the door. A freezing rain was pelting me in the back, it was 3 A.M., and I needed sleep desperately. When the resident of the room called out to me from the darkness, I realized the desk clerk&apos;s mistake, called back &quot;Sorry, wrong room,&quot; and started humping my gear back down to the end of the building to get a new room key.
Now, this is inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst. If the resident of the room had a gun, he could have easily assumed I was some sort of brigand out to rob him in the wee hours of the morning, after all, it&apos;s Motel 6 and not the Waldorf-Astoria. When I opened that door, there was plenty of clearance that he could have put four bullets into me and not even been a very good shot. The desk clerk didn&apos;t seem to be very apologetic, and he issued me a new key for a room two doors down from the old one.
Now, my customer confidence had waned pretty badly at this point, and I almost decided to lean something up against the door to warn me of interlopers, but I was too tired to configure such a Rube Goldberg safety device, so I just put the bolt on the door and passed out on the bed. I slept well and the bed felt like angels carrying my body to Heaven, it was that good, even though it was just a garden variety full size hotel mattress that probably had carried many a call-girl, prom date, construction worker and unfortunate traveller through the night. Not the same night, I don&apos;t think, but that&apos;s a movie script right there, isn&apos;t it?
The next day, I popped my head out of my room like a groundhog, hoping to see my shadow but mostly to check and see what the roads looked like. It was almost noon, and the roads were plowed, salted and looking good. I checked out, pled my case with the manager about my misadventure the night before, and he was largely unmoved, or moved to just before the point where he was willing to give me any cash back for my troubles. He should have been thankful, because it&apos;s only by the grace of God that he didn&apos;t have to call my wife that morning and tell her about her dead husband because his asshole night auditor couldn&apos;t keep straight what rooms in his glorious fleabag had customers in it or not. Needless to say, when I get clear of this weekend, I&apos;m going to be contacting the main office about this, and I will be interested to hear what they have to say.
I started driving the two hours to Newport News, making my way down into Richmond and then southeast towards the Atlantic Ocean, and the snow and ice that was piled up on the sides of the road slowly receded into nothing. If I had driven just another 30 miles the night before (which would have killed me, I&apos;m sure), I would have made my way out of the weather and had dry roads the rest of the way. To know exactly how I felt, read the short story &quot;To Build A Fire&quot; by Jack London, and when you get to the end, that&apos;s exactly where I was. I&apos;ve never given homework for my blog before, so this is definitely a first.
The gig was at the Omni Hotel, a beautiful 5-star facility. I settled into the posh room with two huge beds. Each bed had at least eight pillows on it, I kid you not. The pillows were of various sizes and I built a fort, but Julie the hospitality expert at the front desk wouldn&apos;t come up to play with me. I made my way down to the gig and it went very well, I didn&apos;t have an mc, so I played with the crowd a little bit, then went into material and cleared the way for Miss Gayle, a headliner out of Pittsburgh, PA.
The club treated me very well, paying for my meal and drinks and cashing my check on the premises. They really did it up nice, and we were actually only the fourth show they had ever done. I&apos;ll be interested to see what the amenities are like a year from now, if they continue to do comedy. I sure hope they do, it was a great room with perfect light and sound, and being as that it was Valentine&apos;s Day and there really were no couples to be found in the room, they had a nice crowd.
Last night was Lynchburg, Virginia, a three-hour jaunt back north and to the west. I worked with Chris Wiles out of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I&apos;d never seen him outside of his regular gig at the Greensboro Comedy Zone, and he did just fine. The show was in a small bar/restaurant called Big Lick Tropical Grill, and even though they didn&apos;t have a very large crowd, there was certainly enough people to work, and they enjoyed the show and bought way more CD&apos;s from me than I would have imagined.
After the show, Chris decided to drive overnight to beat the Washington D.C. quagmire as we are working together again tonight in Dover, Delaware and then Saturday in Salisbury, Maryland. I looked at the map and decided to take my chances today, noting that there is a small road that will take me south and east of D.C. and over the Potomac River into Maryland without getting involved in the beltway or it&apos;s legendary traffic jams. Also, the show isn&apos;t until 9 P.M. tonight, so there&apos;s some wiggle room to be had. I set myself a 7 AM wakeup call today anyway just to be safe, and beat that by an hour and a half, so I&apos;m going to get rolling soon. I&apos;ll check in again from Delaware when I get to where I&apos;m going.
Thanks again for reading me. I don&apos;t know if I ever thank my readers, many of you are close friends and many more just drop by out of curiosity, but this journal has been read almost 7,000 times on AOL since I initially started and many more times on MySpace and ComedySoapbox.com, and I appreciate every single view.
If you are in the Northeast or Midwest United States, I hope you&apos;re handling the weather well. For the rest of the country, I know it&apos;s been unseasonably cold, so bundle up and take care of yourselves.

 Long Cold Winter (Cinderella) 
Posted on 02/12/2007 at 12:33 PM
Here in Rochester, the snow&apos;s falling....not like it&apos;s falling in Oswego, NY, if you&apos;ve read anything about that, where they got record snowfall. It&apos;s pretty, but it would have been nice for Christmas instead of now. All it&apos;s doing now is making travel difficult, and making the sky grey and depressing.
I got home Saturday night from the casino tour, safely and by the grace of God. I like the north country of Michigan, the people are nice and it&apos;s oh so rustic, but it&apos;s far away and it&apos;s so cold that salt doesn&apos;t work on the roads, so they spread a salt/dirt mix and you never know which little ice patch will rocket you into the ditch by the side of the road. And you don&apos;t want to find yourself in the ditch up in the U.P. (Upper Peninsula) because there&apos;s no cell phone signal to call AAA, and even if there was, it would be hours before they&apos;d find you.
Thursday afternoon after typing my last entry, I checked into the Kewadin Casino hotel in Sault Ste. Marie. I remembered the place from last year, when I played it in March. I got all of my bags into my room and went downstairs to the box office to collect my check...it&apos;s the main casino of the three, and they pay you for all three nights then and there. I cashed my check at the cage and didn&apos;t have to go through the casino rigamarole of getting a player&apos;s club card because I did that last year and they still had me in the system. I cashed my check and went right over to a &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot; slot machine and played for about 15 minutes, winning just shy of eight bucks.
I headed over to the buffet to check it out, because they were providing a comped meal for the comics, and I had just eaten but was planning on having dinner later. I chatted with the girls working the cashier&apos;s station, and one lady was actually from my neck of the woods. She had taught school in a Rochester suburb for about 17 years and returned to the UP when her mother took ill. It always surprises me when I meet someone who lived in Rochester in a far-flung location, like somehow we&apos;re not supposed to leave town and I&apos;m something special because I do it every week.
The show was o.k., packed with college kids and mostly male, so my relationship material was a waste of time and I compensated by being extra dirty which seemed to play well. As it was a young drinking crowd, merchandise didn&apos;t move for shit, which didn&apos;t surprise me in the least. I chilled out after the show, called home and then watched TV until I could get to sleep. I brought a George Pelicanos crime novel to read (he&apos;s excellent, you should check out his stuff....&quot;King Suckerman&quot; was my first [thanks Mike Dambra for the excellent suggestion] and I picked up a couple more at a used book store....he&apos;s popular, so they&apos;re hard to come by) but I couldn&apos;t focus on reading because I was still amped up from the show, so I did the USA Today Sudoku puzzle until I was ready to drift off.
I was worried about the drive to Manistique, Michigan the next day, but the roads were surprisingly clear. Route 75, the main artery through Michigan, was crappy and the side roads turned out to be mostly clean. I drove through towns that were little more than a gas station, cemetary and grove of pine trees, towns with names like Raco, Eckerman, Hulbert, Newberry, Germfask, and Blaney Park. I got to Manistique just a few minutes earlier than Carol Pennington, my partner in crime for the week, and they sent us to a hotel off-site because the casino in Manistique is too small to have a hotel. It was an Econolodge, but it was the best Econolodge I&apos;ve ever seen. They had wireless internet (thank God) and the room I was in was *huge*. Carol&apos;s room had a jacuzzi! The casino really spent the money to put us up, but in real terms, they probably made that up in about 15 minutes.
I headed off to the casino early for the show to enjoy my comped meal. The restaurant had a seafaring motif, and it was Friday, so I sailed with the herbed, almond-crusted Tilapia. It was good, and probably healthy, although I&apos;m not the first person you should ask about that sort of thing. Carol joined me later, and a few minutes before showtime, I walked across the casino (small place, took about a minute, if that) to the showroom. The showroom was largely empty, and that&apos;s how if twas to stay throughout the show. We flopped around on stage like fishes.....if a comic tells a joke and there&apos;s no one there to hear it, is it still funny? Well, I&apos;m here to tell you the answer is &quot;no.&quot; I was saved by the fact that there was one table of four who were actually listening, and then a couple of working-class guys at the bar who were listening, but not looking toward the stage. I wound up sitting next to them and shooting the shit for a few minutes. Carol did her thing and then got the hell out of there, and I decided to give &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot; a shot. Only problem, the casino only had two of those machines and they were always in use, so I went to an old standby, &quot;Hollywood Squares.&quot; I wound up breaking even on that one after about 20 minutes, so I called it a night, cashed out and went back to the hotel.
There was an incident of sorts at our house Friday night, the police responded to a 911 call that there was a burglary at our house, but Pamela wasn&apos;t the one who called it in, meaning it was either our lousy neighbors pulling a prank, or our nice neighbors across the way actually looking out for us. Regardless, we just had a new door put in that is significantly sturdier than the old one (good thing) so if there was an attempt, it was unsuccessful. Pamela described the incident to me as very disconcerting, especially when four cops met her at the door with guns drawn. I felt awful hearing the story, considering I was 700 miles away and really couldn&apos;t do anything. I was seriously thinking about trying to make the 11-hour drive home overnight, but that wasn&apos;t happening since the gas stations were all closed and I didn&apos;t have enough to make it to the Mackinac Bridge.
I got four hours of sleep and hit the road, taking it slow as not to evoke any unnecessary speeding tickets and made pretty good time, leaving at around 8:20 in the morning and getting home at just after 7 PM. It was good to be home, and now I&apos;m just trying to shake my Winter doldrums before I have to leave again for Virginia. This week, it&apos;s Newport News, Lynchburg, and then Dover, Delaware and Salisbury, Maryland. I&apos;ve done Newport News at Cozzy&apos;s before, but this is a Comedy Zone room. I&apos;m not worried about the competition issue because Cozzy&apos;s really hasn&apos;t had me back in two years or so. The last time I went, I didn&apos;t make the Friday show because of a huge accident in Washington, D.C. that crippled traffic and left me sitting there. I called in way in advance so they could get a substitute, but I guess my reputation is damaged enough that they&apos;re thinking &quot;no thanks.&quot;
So I&apos;m looking forward to the relief from the snow, and maybe that&apos;s not good, because I have Ottawa, Canada to look forward the week after, and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s colder than a banker&apos;s heart up there and buried, as well. We&apos;ll see.
As Gaye from Comedy Zone signs off all her e-mails when she sends itineraries out, May Rays of Sunshine and Happiness fall down upon you, or some happy thing like that.

 Nantucket Sleighride (Mountain) 
Posted on 02/09/2007 at 03:31 PM
Hi. It&apos;s been a week since I&apos;ve written, I know, but I&apos;ve been busy and depressed....those are two interesting balls to keep in the air, but I&apos;ve learned how to be a pretty good juggler.
I left my Dad&apos;s house last Thursday about 2:20 in the afternoon, and a light rain had begun to fall. Nobody knew at that point that it was the telltale sign of a tornado about to hit my parents&apos; home town.
I drove through the night and made it to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania around 20 minutes to 6 in the morning. It piss rained the whole way, and I was definitely worn out when I got there. The hotel didn&apos;t open until 7 AM, so I got breakfast and waited. At 7, the hotel didn&apos;t open so I got a paper and waited, and fell asleep. Around 10:30, I was able to get someone from the restaurant to check me in....the club in Harrisburg is a big steakhouse/banquet facility/motorlodge sort of place. It&apos;s nice having everything under one roof, but only when you can get in under the roof instead of sleeping in your car.
My sister and brother both called me to inform me of the tornado that I just missed at Mom and Dad&apos;s place, and that they were both o.k. I slept about 3 hours and started getting ready for the early show. I was working with headliner CeeJay Jones (www.CeeJayIsFunny.com) and mc Joe Zimmerman. We had a lot of fun, four great shows, and my friends Jared and Cindy came up to visit Friday night. We did the hang around thing and I did something I usually don&apos;t do....I slept over Saturday night and did the drive on Sunday. It was only five hours, but I didn&apos;t relish being in the car anymore or any sooner than I had to.
It seemed like a blink of an eye before I had to get packing and get heading out again, but that was just yesterday. I hit the road shortly after 7 AM and started off towards the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is where I am now. It&apos;s bitter cold and the roads are plowed in a piss-poor manner, but that may just be because snow is blowing over the roads and then everyone has a truck and they tramp the snow down, turning the road into an ice-rink.
Last night was St. Ignace, Michigan at the Kewadin (keh-WAY-den) casino, the first of three Kewadin casinos with headliner Carol Pennington. We performed for about 60 folks last night, many regulars and a good number of casino employees. When I played this place last year, the casino was a little hut, and this year, it&apos;s a palace....I guess the house must be doing pretty good.
I&apos;m poaching internet right now, parked in the parking lot of a Best Western and using their wireless signal. They had wireless at the casino yesterday, but it was a pay plan and I&apos;m still hurting from my first speeding ticket of the year, so I&apos;m saving my nickels and dimes where I can. Saturday is a drive home day after my tour through this wintery wonderland, and I&apos;m gonna try my damndest not to get blown off the Mackinac bridge.
More to report later, stay warm wherever you are.

 I Walk The Line (Johnny Cash) 
Posted on 01/31/2007 at 03:01 PM
Well, I have one more day with my father and mother down here in Florida, and so far, things are going well, except for the fact that Dad&apos;s in pain a lot more than I would like to see. Mom&apos;s doing a great job of tending to his needs and she&apos;s very strong and the fact that she hasn&apos;t unraveled yet is a testimony to what she&apos;s been through, from years of tending to my father&apos;s mother who lived with us for years, and then her own parents&apos; bout of failing health which eventually became terminal.
I&apos;ve been doing what I can, fetching this and that to make Dad comfortable, telling him jokes (so far I&apos;m an amazing 20 for 20....I guess I&apos;ve got him pegged pretty good after all these years) and I wish laughter was the best medicine, but apparently this morphine/ether/heroin combo they&apos;ve got him on is just a little bit better. I think comedy clubs are missing the boat selling alcohol....they ought to be selling painkillers. Hell, even open mike would be funny then.
Yesterday, we had two nurses visit, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The one in the morning was busting my balls about being a northerner and being used to the cold that is gripping Florida right now. It&apos;s really only in the 30&apos;s, but that&apos;s damn brisk compared to what they&apos;re used to. The woman identified herself as a true Floridian and I said &quot;What are you, an orange?&quot; and that got a little chuckle. For the most part, no one here is actually from here....last night in Panera Bread as I (unsuccessfully) tried to check my e-mail using their wireless internet, a table of folks next to us were having a conversation and one of the guys mentioned he was from Rochester, and that got Mom&apos;s and my attention...we wound up chatting with them for a few minutes as they left the place. Down in Florida, it&apos;s big fun when you meet someone from your neck of the woods, even though practically everyone down here is from Upstate New York, Chicago or Detroit, with smatterings of Pittsburgh and Philly thrown in for good measure.
We tried to get Dad to lay down on a bed today, and he was alright for a little while, and then the pain in his back from the tumor that&apos;s taken up residence on his spine started shouting at him, and he begged to go back to his sitting position on the couch with his heating pad. He&apos;s been sitting there and sleeping there for the last three weeks or so, and last night I popped in a tape of &quot;Walk The Line&quot; for him to watch (he&apos;s always been a big Johnny Cash fan, and my lovely wife taped it for him from HBO) and he enjoyed it, but the music put him to sleep like a lullaby. That was actually good, because he was able to get some sleep finally. He slept somewhere between 8 and 10 hours, which is the most I&apos;ve seen in the few days since I&apos;ve been here.
Before I came down here, I got some great advice from folks who had gone down this road before, and they all said the same thing, which is basically enjoy my father&apos;s company, don&apos;t concentrate on saying &quot;goodbye,&quot; just comfort him and be there for him. Right now, I&apos;m about to head home, I&apos;ve picked up the smokes he asked for (no sense in quitting now) and I&apos;ll enjoy one more night with him before I take off tomorrow for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
I&apos;m scheduled to come back to Florida in May and I don&apos;t know if Dad will be around then, or if he is, what state he&apos;ll be in, so I guess I&apos;m happy that I made the trip this week. Pam sent me pictures of Harmony and Snax The Cat who he used to take care of for me when I was on the road. I hope he&apos;ll enjoy them (I&apos;m sure he will) and make him smile. I fear I&apos;m running out of jokes, so I need all the help I can get.
Thank you all for your prayers and best wishes. On behalf of my father, I appreciate and accept them.

 Drive South (John Hiatt) 
Posted on 01/28/2007 at 02:21 AM
It&apos;s almost unfair to call what I do a &quot;roadtrip&quot;....usually, when I think of a roadtrip, I think of getting in a car with a specific destination in mind, and letting the good times roll in between. When I get in the car, I pack like a hitman....I only take what I&apos;ll need, nothing more, stick to a previously determined route, stop for food and rest room breaks only when I need to gas up the car anyway, and return home as quickly as possible. It&apos;s not really traversing the country with a gypsy soul when you can say you&apos;ve been to Washington D.C. three times and never saw the Lincoln Memorial.
This week has been a little different as I head south to see my father in between two weeks of work for the Comedy Zone in Charlotte, North Carolina and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. I picked up a Wednesday night show in Clemson, South Carolina, just a couple of hours southwest of Charlotte, only to have my Thursday night canceled when the club tightened up their show schedule due to flagging attendance.
No problem, as I would just drive in early, get a hotel room for the night off, and cool my heels. There are books and newspapers to read, malls to walk and TV to watch, killing a day should be no problem.
Heading to the show at Pitcher&apos;s at the Clemson Marina, I ran into fellow comic Ward Anderson (www.wardanderson.net) in the parking lot of the hotel, just heading out himself. He motioned me to jump in the car, and off we went. The gig was a small bar but the room filled up pretty quick, and rather than being college or military folk, the showroom was comprised mostly of young townies and some older redneck types. Jack Daniels was doing a liquor promotion in the bar, and I indulged in a shot, as I am a whiskey guy to people who know me, and Ward drank about the rest of the bottle while he was on stage. We really let loose with it, and the show was good, and afterwards, we hung out and nearly closed the bar. I did a cold read on the bartender, which is a skill I picked up from my good friend Mike Dambra. I pegged this chick as basically being the patient type, and the type of girl who would look past the obvious deficiencies in her beau in favor of the task of &quot;straightening him up.&quot; After the read, she confessed that she had just broken up with a guy after a 5-year relationship, and she had to leave because he had no drive or goals whatsoever. This girl was working her way through school and she was in the medical field, which is very strenuous (and expensive) and I think it offended her that buddy boy was basically a couch potato. Big fun ripping people&apos;s souls out like I&apos;m doing a card trick.
The next day, Ward invited me to tag along with him to Greenwood, South Carolina, where he was doing a one-nighter booked by Julie at the Comedy House Theater in Columbia, South Carolina. He offered to let me crash with him rather than coughing up money for a hotel room, which sounded like a great idea. We got headed toward Greenwood and basically got lost about seven times due to the poorly labeled road signs in South Carolina. We took what should have been a two-hour trip and stretched it into about 4 1/2 hours. After a Chinese buffet dinner that wasn&apos;t bad, we headed to the club, the Sports Break tavern. During our little drive, I got a call from Joel Pace at the Comedy Zone inviting me to come down and play basketball with the guys from the office (a favorite pastime of theirs) and I felt annointed in a strange way. I guess they didn&apos;t know I was fat and 40...not much use on a basketball court without a mascot uniform, to be perfectly honest.
Ward was working with a comic from Columbia named Mo Dixon. Mo was funny, and his closing bit was stripping down to thong underwear and shaking his ass to music. The crowd went wild, and I felt a little bad that Ward had to follow that. I mc&apos;ed the show, and flirted around with waitresses to pass the time. Ward didn&apos;t start clicking with the crowd until he really started getting into their ass, ripping on a group of lesbians and an Asian girl who was drunk and heckling him. After the show, he was basking in his headliner glory and I wound up hanging around with Tyler, one of the managers of the club. I regaled him with stories of the road and my own comedy background, and I think I may be invited to play the club sometime in the future...he like what I did during my short mc set, anyway. He gave me three club shirts, one for my wife, daughter and myself, and then gave me a card for two comped meals which Ward and I used the next day. I let him buy me O&apos;Douls&apos; until he had to get back to work, and then struck up a conversation with some folks who had seen the show who were big Phish fans.
The next day, we headed out towards Charlotte, and after a few cock-ups in the directions (which I didn&apos;t have pre-printed, because I had no idea I was going to Greenwood), we got headed in the right direction and Ward and I managed to both get speeding tickets in a little town called Whitmire, South Carolina. We finally made it to Charlotte, and we stopped off at the Comedy Zone offices and I met Joel Pace, who I had spoken to several times in the past, worked for dozens of times, but never actually met. He was quite busy, so we puttered around the office and I came across a stack of Chris Wiles&apos; promo packs. Chris is the house mc at the Greensboro, North Carolina Comedy Zone, (www.chriswiles.net) and he is a nice guy albeit with a dubious reputation in the business. His promo packs included a copy of his DVD and a package of microwave popcorn and a box of Milk Duds, like a cute way of saying &quot;enjoy the show.&quot; I ate a box of Milk Duds and not only were they old, but they weren&apos;t his. HA! Chris is a buddy, just kidding around. Ward and I then proceded to get lost again on the way to the Microtel due to Yahoo&apos;s crappy directions. We made it in time to iron a couple of shirts and make the show.
The Comedy Zone in Matthews is a nice little weekend room, and I was working with Skip Martin and Grandma Lee. Skip and I had met several months ago (he interviewed me for a local paper, I think) and I had just seen him in Fayetteville, North Carolina last month. Grandma Lee is a legend but we&apos;d never crossed paths. We had a very good first show (packed house) and then second show was a little sparse and weird. Ward did a guest spot and then almost got into a bar fight out in the lounge. After the show, Ward, Grandma Lee and I headed out to Waffle House for some late-night eats and suffice to say they might have been serving soup, but we were the only crackers in the place, if you get my meaning. Grandma Lee picked up the check, and I liked her even before that, but that was the cherry on top of the sundae. She&apos;s a classy lady and a good comic, and I enjoyed chatting with her about the business.
Today, Ward and I hung out, hadlunch, talked shop and then parted company. I got over to the Comedy Zone at Starz Tavern just a little before showtime, and the place was packed. We had two sold-out shows, and my comedy buddies Kurt Green and Steve Caminiti stopped in to say hi, they were working a country club gig up the road. We hung out and talked some more shop (it&apos;s what I do, people) and we took some pictures which I will try to post on my new website www.ralphtetta.com. Keep an eye out for them. The crowds were excellent, and I just let myself go, did my material in whatever order I felt like, riffing with the people as I saw fit, and it went great. If ever I felt like I was truly ready to headline, that I trusted myself and my abilities, tonight was the night.
Tomorrow I head down to see my parents in Florida, it&apos;s 8 1/2 hours down there and I&apos;m not looking forward to the drive, but I am looking forward to seeing them. Once I get there, I have four days to basically say goodbye to my Dad, and I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to say. I&apos;m sure the time in the car will be plenty to prepare for it, but can you really prepare for such a thing? I don&apos;t think you can.
I&apos;ll do my best.

 Those Shoes (The Eagles) 
Posted on 01/24/2007 at 06:47 PM
My periwinkle 4-door Toyota Corolla is no more. I drove up to St. Paul, Minnesota from Rochester, Minnesota on Saturday and collected my personal items from the vehicle in anticipation of it being junked. I thought I would be very emotional about it, but as my wife said, &quot;That car didn&apos;t owe us anything.&quot; It died at mileage 329,525, a ripe old age for any vehicle, and I&apos;m sad to see it go, but it was time to let go and start over.
The weekend at Goonie&apos;s Comedy Club in Rochester, Minnesota, was excellent. We had four sold out (or nearly sold out) shows to work with, and the staff was just wonderful. After the show, Mike and I packed out our luggage and drove home overnight, trying to beat the snowstorm that was threatening the Chicago area.
I started the driving shift while Mike slept, and got us down through Wisconsin and into Illinois. We stopped for gas outside of Rockford, and we switched so that Mike could drive and I could sleep. I folded my glasses up and put them in my inside coat pocket, reclined the seat and went to sleep.
It had started to snow a little coming down through Madison, Wisconsin and Janesville, but by Beloit, it had started to let up. By the time we went through Chicago, it was nearly 6 in the morning, and the roads were sloppy and unplowed and covered with slush. The lines were invisible and truckers weaved back and forth like they were drunk, but Mike did an excellent job of navigating all of this, thanks to his time working in Western Canada for Yuk Yuk&apos;s, where I&apos;m certain it snows all year long, especially up in the mountains. Our plan was to switch driving after burning a tank of gas, but I offered to switch with him in Indiana as he had done more than his time at the wheel, and with horrible driving conditions as well. I took the wheel and almost immediately got pulled over for speeding. My bad luck had continued to become an issue.
While I just sat there as the officer took my license and rental car info (I have no registration in such an instance), I shook my head and tried to figure out why I&apos;d been tested so much these past two weeks. In the first stroke of luck I&apos;d had since we left home, the officer gave me only a warning, printed on a green form that looked like a speeding ticket, and asked me to slow down and be safe as I headed east. I went on my way and drove until we reached Ohio. Oh, did I mention my glasses were broken? When I fished them out of my pocket in Indiana, the right stem had separated itself from the hinge and I managed to find where it had slipped out, but could not get it to stay. Finally, after finding my eyeglass repair kit in my shoulder bag, I got it to stay a little bit, but worried about it until I got home. A little super glue did the trick, but it was just one more thing in this horrible, horrible tour.
During the ride home, Mike counseled me as best he could, but it was a discussion I needed to have with truths I needed to hear. I need to make massive changes in my act, the way I do business, the way I treat others, and the way I approach my family situation. My passivity has created a situation of stagnation, and that stagnation threatens the security of my household, particularly the raising of my beautiful little daughter. I&apos;m a good comic, but I&apos;ve allowed myself to become a parody of Mike, who I always looked at as a blueprint for success. The simple truth is that I&apos;m not Mike, and audiences are giving me the fish-eye because they don&apos;t buy it coming from me. Along with his mannerisms, I seem to have co-opted his attitude, and that&apos;s not me, it&apos;s not genuine. I&apos;m a good writer and a nice person, and that should be enough. I&apos;m not going to convince anyone that I&apos;m a gunslingin&apos; tough guy, a badass or a rebel...I&apos;m a soft-hearted family man who loves his wife and daughter and wants everyone to know it, and to ditch their own negativity and enjoy life. I know that I&apos;m going to face rejection initially, as comedy club patrons seem to thrive on negativity, but I&apos;ll grow into this and can&apos;t be afraid anymore.
We got home and Mike dropped me off, and I had to be let into the house because we got a whole new door, complete with new deadbolt lock, and I didn&apos;t have a key yet. Pam wasn&apos;t home, but my mother-in-law was, and she was watching Harmony. When she opened the door, Harmony was standing just behind her but came around to look and she smiled at me when she saw me, but I swear she changed so much in the two weeks I was gone. It was a hollow, empty feeling in my stomach that such a big part ofmy life had been eclipsed by so much misery and bad circumstance.
I went to work putting away my luggage, dropping laundry and trying to ramp back into civilian life. I fixed my glasses, changed into clean, comfortable clothing and fell on the bed to sleep. Pam got home a little while later, and we just took it easy while she tried to explain to me everything that I missed.
Well, two days of really nothing to report have led to this; I&apos;m gone again, writing at the desk of a hotel room in Clemson, South Carolina. I have a show tonight and then run up to Charlotte, North Carolina for the weekend, and then go to see my father for four days before heading back north to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. My brother and sister had gone down to see Dad, and they overlapped Tuesday night, and as I drove out of a Western New York snowstorm, I talked with them for about an hour, trying to glean any information that would make my visit more pleasant (or less painful). I&apos;m tied up in knots about the prospect that my father doesn&apos;t have much time left in this world, and I&apos;m upset that it seems like a &quot;Hollywood ending&quot; is coming; my brother visits, then my sister, and my father&apos;s spirits perk up and his dementia subsides. Then I visit, as I have every year for the last three years, and spend the better part of a week with him, and when I leave, the realization that no more visitors are coming sets in, and my father nods off to sleep and doesn&apos;t wake up.....and I&apos;m the last one to have left. It&apos;s an enormous burden that I carry that I&apos;m convinced that everything that happens around me is my fault, and I read that once in some horoscope book and now I can&apos;t shake it.
Things are going to be different, that&apos;s all I have to say. I&apos;m going to spend time with my father and still plan to visit when I work in Florida in June. I hope that he&apos;ll still be alive, but if he isn&apos;t, then it&apos;s just his time. He&apos;s going to be 74, he&apos;s had a full life, and he doesn&apos;t owe me anything. I am going to honor him by being the man he tried to raise me to be, and instead of letting fear and uncertainty rule my life, I&apos;m going to have a plan and work towards concrete goals rather than just be happy with whatever happens to float my way. I&apos;m not going to eulogize my father here, because he&apos;s not dead, but suffice to say that he was not a man who sat idly by and waited for things to happen. He got up, took action, and made his life what he wanted it to be. And when he retired, he continued doing that, even though it meant a life largely spent sitting in front of the television, watching movies that he taped round-the-clock with a glass of Coca-Cola at his side, taking time out to have a smoke break out on the porch. He was his own man, and I need to learn by his example.
I&apos;m going to enjoy my visit this week. But tonight, I have business of my own, a show in Clemson, South Carolina, and they&apos;re getting a good one...the best I have to offer, the best ME that can possibly take the stage.
Today I&apos;m going to start to learn how my own shoes fit.

 The End (The Doors) 
Posted on 01/19/2007 at 09:14 AM
I feel like everything&apos;s falling apart right now.
The tour has taken a turn for the worst. Mike Dambra and I left our cozy hotel in Lakeville, Minnesota on Tuesday morning, headed north to Duluth. The temperature that day was ridiculous, like a high of 9 degrees or something like that, and my faithful 
Toyota Corolla couldn&apos;t stand it anymore. We were tooling along I-35, thinking nothing of anything but getting to the gig, and suddenly the temperature gauge on my dashboard was into the red. The next thing we knew, we were sitting on an off-ramp in the coldest place imaginable. I popped the hood to look and see if there was some visible thing that I could correct, and when that didn&apos;t present itself (and I&apos;m no auto mechanic, so why would it?), I got on the phone to AAA for a tow and rescue. While I was doing that, Mike jumped into action and called a friend of his who works in front of a computer all day, and he rented us a car for two days. We got towed to Burnsville Toyota, where we left my car, and they graciously shuttled us to the airport, and off we went.
During the ride, there was speculation as to what happened to the car, and all fingers pointed at my overdue oil change. The AAA driver didn&apos;t so much believe that to be the case, based on where the smoke was coming from under my hood, and I maintained my innocence. Regardless of the circumstance, it was an 11-year-old car with 329,000 miles giving up the ghost in sub-freezing weather.
The gig in Duluth at The Tap Room was what it usually was...lots of college kids who trickled in during the show. I hit the stage with as much energy and positivity as I could, but I have a dead car and a dying father, and frankly, there wasn&apos;t much left in reserve to work with. After the show, we hung around with some kids who were celebrating a buddy&apos;s birthday, and then we stared a near-fruitless search for after-hours food in Duluth, having only stopped for a Wendy&apos;s lunch earlier in the day due to our mini-version of Planes, Trains and Automobiles that we launched into by mistake.
We gathered up some Taco John&apos;s and headed back to the Voyager Lakewalk, which features the coldest guest rooms in North America. I was in a room with two double beds and even though I had set my thermostat for 85 degrees, the temperature didn&apos;t rise above 68. I pulled all the covers off the bed I wasn&apos;t using and put them on mine. They managed to keep me warm until morning, when the bad news came in. My car was officially dead, the radiator had ruptured (probably due to a combination of the bitter cold and road salt eating away at it) and when all the fluid leaked out, the engine overheated and blew. There was no way to get the car back on the road without a new engine and radiator, and that was thousands of dollars I didn&apos;t have, nor wanted to spend on such a high-mileage vehicle.
I called Mike, and when we checked out, he sprung into action. I had no plan, was scared, and didn&apos;t know what to do. Mike had ripped the rental car page out of the phone book and we started calling companies and asking for rate quotes. We had to get to Stevens Point, Wisconsin for our next gig, so I started working the cell phone and my AAA discount. We finally got a good rate from Hertz and arranged for a car to be picked up in Minneapolis for Thursday. The only problem was that I don&apos;t carry credit cards, and in order to reserve on my debit card, I had to have $100 over the rental price, and my current checking account balance wasn&apos;t going to cover it.
The solution was a money transfer at a Wal-Mart store. For a fee of $11.46, you can send $200 anywhere in the country where there&apos;s another Wal-Mart. You pay at the customer service desk, they give you a reference number, and then you call the person who will pick up the cash with the reference number, they go into a Wal-Mart and get the money. I called my wife and told her that I would be doing such a transfer and that she needed to get the money and go put it in our checking account. The money had to be posted by 2 P.M., or else it would qualify for the next day&apos;s business and not be available to me.
Mike and I hit the Wal-Mart in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, sent $600 to Rochester, and got back in the car headed for Stevens Point. My wife had an hour and 20 minutes to get to the Wal-Mart, get the money, and get it deposited into our checking account by two. The only problem was that she hadn&apos;t driven her car in a few days and it was covered with ice, and somewhere along the line, her mother got involved and convinced her that she would take her and Harmony to go run the errand in her car, which was already warmed up.
30 minutes later, I called to check on their status. It was 10 after 2, their time, and they were just getting in the car. They had 50 minutes to accomplish the task, and Mike and I were getting mad and frustrated, to say the least. If Pam had just left when I first called, even though she had to warm up her car and clear the ice, she&apos;d already have been most of the way there.
When Pam got to the Wal-Mart, they started giving her grief about picking up the money. Time was ticking away and the clerk was saying something about a $300 limit, and that they could do $300 in cash and $300 in a money order, which was unacceptable because the money order needed three days to clear when deposited in a checking account, much too late to be of any good. Pam realized the desperation of our situation and called a manager, who finally got things cleared up. Meanwhile, in our car, Mike was getting madder and madder and I was getting sick to my stomach. I didn&apos;t want to think about being stranded 1,200 miles from home, and didn&apos;t want my wife&apos;s inability to perform what was supposed to be a simple task to be the reason. Of course, we didn&apos;t realize that she was having customer service problems at the time, so it just seemed like she was dragging her feet, and I had no defense. Evertime I would call her to get information that would calm Mike down, Pam would hang up on me and Mike would get madder. I&apos;d never been so gripped with worry and fear before in my life.
Pam finally got the money, and they were heading towards our bank. We had 8 minutes to go, and temperatures were high. Pam finally called with three minutes to go, clutching the deposit receipt in her hand, mission accomplished. You couldn&apos;t have scripted a Jack Bauer moment any tighter, with Pam clipping the blue wire just seconds before the bomb went off. She didn&apos;t call me back all day, and I didn&apos;t get the details of what happened until way later. I wanted to give her credit for handling things with the manager, but taking the extra time ate up 30 precious minutes that we really didn&apos;t have. Thank God everything turned out alright, or there was going to be hurt feelings all around, plus I&apos;d be on a bus right now headed back to Rochester.
The gig in Stevens Point was good, well attended and there was a girl named Tiffany who seemed to have brought the whole room. It was her birthday and she made no bones about flitting table to table to tell people that it was, even folks that she hadn&apos;t brought. We were pretty sure that she was going to interrupt the show and make it all about her, but she was well-behaved and that was a big plus. They paid us by check (yet another hurdle) and we were spared with the information that we could cash them at the bank branch located in the supermarket right next to the hotel. The next morning, we got coffee, headed over, and were treated to a $6 transaction fee for cashing the checks. Boots kept dropping with every turn of my head.
We got out early enough that we arrived at Minneapolis/St. Paul International airport in plenty of time to return Mike&apos;s rental car and to go pick up mine. I had never rented a car before so this was all new territory, and Mike briefed me on all the information I needed to know. 15 minutes later, we were climbing into a nice Kia Spectra with South Carolina plates. The car is small but good, and only had 17,000 miles on it. We drove through a small snowstorm on our way to Mankato.
Arriving at the Budget Host in Mankato, Minnesota, the fun never stopped. We were informed at the desk that the owner of the club hadn&apos;t made reservations for us. We called him, got his machine and left a message. Wealso called the Funny Business Agency and got them into the act, and apparently they had better contact phone numbers than we did. When the owner arrived at the Budget Host, things were not fine as the Hindu desk clerk chided him for bouncing a check, and told him in no uncertain terms that they would not accept his checks anymore. This didn&apos;t seem good, so we went to lunch and gave the guy our cell phone numbers. While at lunch, he called and told us that we were moved to Microtel, which is definitely an upgrade from the aformentioned Budget Host. We didn&apos;t have a very good feeling about the whole &quot;bounced check&quot; business, but it was just par for the course for this tour from Hell.
I had a nice, fitful sleep for about an hour after lunch and then started ramping up to get ready for our show, which was scheduled for 8:30 PM. I had good directions to the gig, and just needed to shower and possible shave, and maybe iron a shirt rather than using one of my permanent press ones that I always pack just in case there&apos;s no time to iron one. I happened to look through the local paper to see if our showwas listed, and it was, but the start time was listed as 8:00 P.M. So now, I&apos;m a half hour late, and I haven&apos;t even started getting ready. I called Mike, changed our departure time, and got ready in 15 minutes flat.
We got to the club on time, only to find out that the show was supposed to be at 8:30, but they usually push it back to 9. The owner was there, but he was leaving....not a good sign. He told us that it would be the first show that he hadn&apos;t stuck around for, and Mike and I have been in this game long enough to know that something was up. It&apos;s like a sort of radar, when you know damn well that the gig is going to try to get out of paying you. Mike had overheard the owner talking to his bartender, and asking her if she could &quot;handle it,&quot; and she said that she could, which we took to mean that she could handle the task of telling us that we weren&apos;t getting paid, or weren&apos;t getting our full amounts, or worse, that she was going to give us checks which is the worst of all, because you&apos;re getting screwed but you don&apos;t know it until 9 o&apos;clock in the morning the next day, when the bar&apos;s closed and all the rats have retreated to their holes. We hung out, and I played games on the touch screen machine at the bar while Mike talked to some friends that he had met on MySpace. Our mc showed up, and we talked shop a little bit, and then the show started.
The show was good enough, for a small crowd in a new bar in a college town, and thankfully all the tables were full, except for the front row, and I hit the 30 mark quicker than I imagined I would, and got off the stage. Mike did his thing, and one of his MySpace friends got a little rowdy and I guess she went up to the stage and laid down on it, but I missed it because I was talking to the bouncer and the bartender in the other room. The bartender paid me my full amount, in cash, and I breathed a sigh of relief. During the ride home, Mike told me that the bartender had said that it was a good thing that we were funny, because if we weren&apos;t, her instructions were not to pay us. There are comics that are scheduled to perform there for the next couple of months, and some of them might run into problems. I didn&apos;t need any more problems, I&apos;ve had plenty of my own this week.
Today we run to Rochester, Minnesota, home of Goonies Comedy Club. We have two shows tonight and two shows tomorrow, and tomorrow during the day, I have to run up to St. Paul and retrieve the last personal effects from my Toyota Corolla, the car that Pam and I called Scooby, and discuss the disposal of the car with the folks at Burnsville Toyota. Mike and I are probably going to try to beat some of the weather that they&apos;re predicting for the weekend by leaving after the show Saturday night, so I&apos;ll also have to get some rest Saturday during the day. It&apos;s a busy one, and I don&apos;t know how much sleep I can realistically get. When I get home, then I have other problems to contend with, such as securing another vehicle for the upcoming road engagements I have. Renting is fun and all, but it really isn&apos;t in the budget.
Also, I have another problem to contend with. My father has taken a turn for the worst, and according to my mother, he&apos;s talking to people that aren&apos;t there, and asking her questions like did she let the cats out, even though we haven&apos;t had cats in 15 years or more. His brain is setting up defense mechanisms, and we don&apos;t know how much longer he has. My brother and sister have both made plans to get down to Florida to see him, and my plans are to use my wife&apos;s car next week to get to Charlotte, North Carolina, where my next engagement is, and then head on down to Florida to see him, and then back up to Harrisburg, PA for my next weekend of work, and then back home. I couldn&apos;t be more stressed if you hired a guy to sit next to me and zap me with a cattle prod at random points during the day, and I can&apos;t even guess where my blood pressure is. I&apos;m not at all interested in seeing my father to say goodbye, because it&apos;s going to hurt tremendously, and I guess the only thing that would hurt worse is not to go because I didn&apos;t have the money. That would be guilt I would carry to my grave, and I&apos;ve got enough of that. I spoke to my mother yesterday and she said that I shouldn&apos;t worry about it, that she would help underwrite the cost of my trip, but the source of a lot of my problems is that I&apos;ve let others sustain me when I should have been concentrating on standing on my own two feet. I&apos;m going to be changing that soon, as I see my habits and ways have left me helpless and afraid. Or as the Bible says:
I went by the field of the lazy man,
And by the vineyard of the man devoid of understanding;
Andthere it was, all overgrown with thorns;
Its surface was covered with nettles;
Its stone wall was broken down.
When I saw it, I considered it well;
I looked on it and received instruction:
A little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to rest;
So shall your poverty come like a prowler,
And your need like an armed man.
Prov 24:30-34
I can do better than what I&apos;m doing, and my father would want better than that for me.

 Power To The People (John Lennon) 
Posted on 01/16/2007 at 09:55 AM
Faithful readers of this blog have probably picked up on my tendencies; I&apos;m good to write every few days, waiting for something eventful to happen. Well, sometimes events make me want to go into literary hiding until I can properly do the autopsy on what happened and how.
Saturday was a pretty miserable day, as far as things with me were concerned. Mike Dambra and I were in St. Peters, Missouri, a northern suburb of St. Louis, and had just gotten back from lunch at our favorite Chinese buffet. Lunch kinda sucked, the sushi was made with mushy rice and was barely edible, quite a disappointment. When I got back to the room, my sister had called me with news about my father. We&apos;ve been watching Dad since before Christmas because he hasn&apos;t been doing well, with episodes of forgetfulness bordering on dementia. Well, a visit to his regular doctor and his oncologist have revealed that he&apos;s had a relapse with cancer, with tumors ocurring on both lungs and also on his spinal cord, which seems to be the reason that his third vertebrae is out of place. He had been medicated for back pain, and we thought that his lapses in memory were due to the medication, but it&apos;s probably due to the unwanted visitor that has taken up residence in his central nervous system. So now all I have to contend with is figuring out when I can get down to Florida to see him, and more urgently, how I do two funny shows with this bullshit on my mind.
Mike is a tried-and-true road warrior and comedy professional. His advice to me was that I had to leave it out of the club. I thought he meant not to mention it on stage, but he meant that I shouldn&apos;t discuss it at all. Two shows later, I got into an altercation with a young lady in the lounge who used to work there. She was inebriated, but I was very angry and physically threatening, and even though she no longer worked there, she was much beloved, and any argument about who said what to who was going to find me on the short end. I went from being one of their favorite comics to being the guy who will &quot;never work here again,&quot; but save for Mike going to bat for me.
The lesson was hard learned, and the drive of shame back to the hotel was difficult but necessary. I need to learn the value of the words &quot;walk away&quot; and to watch my tone and be more aware of how I treat people. I was certainly in a poor frame of mind and that didn&apos;t help, but they didn&apos;t come up with the phrase &quot;the show must go on&quot; for nothing.
When we returned to the hotel, the power was out thanks to the ice storm that has caused a lot of death and damage to the midwest, and we had no electricity. I carry plenty of matches with me but no candles or flashlights, so I navigated my room as best as I could and got a decent night&apos;s sleep. Early in the morning, around 6 or 7, the lights flipped on and then off again, giving me hope that I wouldn&apos;t have to shower in the dark, that crews were working on the electricity, but that turned out to be false hope as checkout time loomed with no power. I showered using reflected daylight from my open curtains, packed and loaded the car. Thankfully I had charged my cell phone and used the alarm feature to wake or I would have certainly overslept.
We drove in what I can only explain as terrible weather as we made our way northward, stopping off to eat at Golden Corral (great buffet style country cooking) and then stopped into Terrible&apos;s Mark Twain Casino. Mike likes the nickel slots, and I&apos;m an addict, so it was the perfect place to stretch out and waste some of our first of two days off. We checked in, signing up for casino cards, which we couldn&apos;t enter the gaming area without. The check-in ladies must have been wooed by our charms, because they gave us free hats and t-shirts when we were only supposed to get one or the other. I took that to be a good sign. Mike searched out the &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; machines, and we found six back by the cage in the very back of the casino. He sat down at an end machine, and I didn&apos;t want to &quot;jinx&quot; him, so I took the center of three machines directly opposite.
Well, these weren&apos;t even nickel machines, they were two cents a spin, and I don&apos;t know if you know anything about slot machines, but they have what they call &quot;pay&quot; lines. When the reels spin, they show fifteen cards, three horizontal rows of five each. Pay line one is the middle five cards in a row. Pay line two is the upper line, and Pay line three is the lower line. Then they start getting fancy, maybe starting at the bottom left and going diagonal to the top middle, and then diagonal down to the lower right. Regardless, they have a choice of up to 21 Pay lines, and if you play one credit (two cents), it would cost you 42 cents a spin, with 21 possible payoff patterns, ranging from five credits (which would make you a 37 cent net loser) all the way up to the big jackpot of a little more than $1,200. You also then have the option of playing one, two, three, five or ten credits per spin. I chose the 15 pay line option, and was playing one, then two, then three credits each spin, then would return back to one and repeat the process.
Now, if you were lucky enough to show three suitcases on the board for any one spin, you would get to &quot;play the game,&quot; and this being a video machine, the touch screen would go to a mini-version of the TV game show &quot;Deal or No Deal,&quot; and you would pick a suitcase and then eliminate suitcases and then be made an offer by the banker on how many credits you would get. Long story short, I cashed out my original $20 for just a little over $80.....a $60 profit! And while that doesn&apos;t sound like a lot of money, I did that on a two-cent machine! I was happy just to have not lost.
I resisted temptation for quite a while after that, choosing to watch the NFC divisional playoff game between Chicago and Seattle, and while I was pulling for Seattle to hand lunch to those Chicago chumps, the Bears pulled it out in overtime, which to me says they aren&apos;t the strong team that everyone says they are. I got bored quick and wound up playing another machine called &quot;Road Trip&quot; and won another ten bucks, and then won another ten at the roulette wheel. All in all, after tipping at the cash-out cage, I made $80 and some change. Which was good, because two hotel rooms for our two days off wound up costing just a couple of bucks over that, so it was an expense I didn&apos;t have to absorb. Again, my trust in God is valid as He provides me what I need.
We drove into Iowa, and battled some of the crappiest weather you&apos;re ever gonna want to see. It was freezing rain and the roads were icy and slick, and we slogged it out to Cedar Rapids, got to the Motel 6 and called it a night. We ate at a Chinese buffet across the way (they&apos;re everywhere!) and the food was fresh, hot and good. My leg, which had been bothering me for several days, was feeling back to normal after the day off and subsequent short drive. I sortedclothes, anticipating laundry day, and watched snow fall on my car, the first of the year for such a thing.
The next morning, it was cold and crappy, and about two or three inches of snow covered everything. My car doors were frozen so we had to do the old &quot;bucket of hot water&quot; trick, which released the locks, which would freeze up on us again as we ate lunch. We checked out early, and were treated to the rare pleasure of watching a hooker argue with the desk clerk about being let back into a room where her clothing and etc. was. The &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Johns,&quot; we have no way of knowing how many their were, skipped out and left her there without paying for the room. The desk clerk said, &quot;O.K., but this is the last time,&quot; leading Mike and I to believe that this sort of thing happens a lot. It opened my eyes a little more to the cold, cruel world. We drove to Cedar Falls, home of an amazing comic book shop called The Core. I treated myself to a couple of new comics and chatted with the owner. Then we grabbed some lunch, poured hot water on the car doors, and headed north into Minnesota, stopping at another Motel 6. We got as lucky as you could possibly be, because there was a 24-hour laundromat right across the parking lot from the hotel, and a Subway restaurant, which meant we wouldn&apos;t have to go searching for our creature needs in an unfamiliar terrain.
As I write this, the temperature outside is -17 degrees Fahrenheit. I have never experienced weather this cold, or for certain, don&apos;t remember it very well if I have. I went outside at 7 to make sure my car would start, because a couple of years ago in Wisconsin, I had to call the Auto Club for a jump because my engine wouldn&apos;t turn over, and it was wicked bitter cold like this. Thankfully, the car started right away, but the door locks are frozen into the &quot;open&quot; position, so we won&apos;t have to do the hot water trick to get in when we leave today.
Tonight, it&apos;s Duluth, Minnesota, home of the Tap Room, and the start of another five days on the road. I don&apos;t know which is going to get to me first, the wicked cold, the homesickness, or the worry about my Dad. I know that one of them is going to get me, and I have to stay strong and do my job, make people laugh, and then take whatever comfort I can after the show. I was mean to Pam on the phone yesterday, and Mike made me call her back to apologize, which was the right thing to do, only my head is so clouded I didn&apos;t even realize I was being sharp. I had to use the bathroom really bad, and I was concentrating on getting to a McDonald&apos;s or a gas station, and I wasn&apos;t paying attention to what I was saying, and that&apos;s not right.
I&apos;m going back to sleep now, trying to remember what I&apos;ve learned. The initials are H-A-L-T....don&apos;t get too hungry, don&apos;t get too angry, don&apos;t get too lonely, don&apos;t get too tired, because that&apos;s when you&apos;re most susceptible to losing control.
And I&apos;m not so much interested in that happening...I have people who need me, my wife, my daughter, my friends, and father and mother right now.

 That Smell (Lynyrd Skynyrd) 
Posted on 01/13/2007 at 02:04 PM
It is Day 5 of a 12-day tour, and I&apos;m in a great deal of pain. I have a muscle cramp in my left leg that my traveling partner, Mike Dambra, feels is a sciatic nerve issue. Regardless, it hurts like a sonofabitch, and I can&apos;t even take Tylenol because my liver can&apos;t take it. So it&apos;s stretching, massaging and gritting my teeth until this thing works itself out.
We started our big tour at 6 AM on Tuesday when I picked Mike up at his house. Mike and I have been friends for years, and best friends since we toured together incessantly through the early 2000&apos;s. We had both had about three hours of sleep each, and by 10 AM, I told him his parents were never married and punched him about 50 times. The punches were of the &quot;little brother&quot; variety, but I&apos;m twice his size, so I think I may have cracked his ribs.
Things got off to a rocky start as we passed through Buffalo and then down into Erie, Pennsylvania. The sky darkened, snow began to fall, and pretty soon, the roads were absolute shit and twice the car fish-tailed and Mike began confessing his sins to God. By the time Cleveland came around, things cleared up and we continued southward to Columbus, Ohio, moving on to Indianapolis and finally arriving in Terre Haute, not really sure what time it was because of Indiana and their happy-go-lucky attitude towards Daylight Savings Time. It was, indeed, 4 o&apos;clock, same as Eastern Time, and we had hours to prepare for our 8 o&apos;clock show, which for me meant a good long nap.
The show was at a bar called the Dawg House and it was like a bout of Deja Vu for me, because Michael and I had been here before, but not performing. There used to be another comedy night at a place called Stable&apos;s Steakhouse, and after the last time we performed there, (August 14th, 2003), we were invited by folks to come over to the Dawg House for drinks. Well, I wasn&apos;t in a drinking mood, because that happened to be the big Great Lakes blackout, and my wife Pamela was home pregnant with our daughter, Harmony, and I couldn&apos;t get in touch with her because her cell phone ran out of charge and there was no way to charge it up. I sat at the bar and watched CNN, hoping to get some information on what was happening, and finally Pam was able to call me from her grandmother&apos;s house a few blocks away, when she discovered that they had power over there. During all this, Mike met a girl named Shamani (her yoga name) who taught yoga (her yoga job). He totally fell in love with her, or at the very least, wanted to talk to her or see her again, but she never returned his e-mails. I was hoping that she&apos;d show up at our show on Tuesday, but not only did she decide to stay away, but a lot of people did.
We wound up doing the show for about 25 people, and they explained that it was there first time doing comedy after a one year layoff, and that school at Rose Hulman University had just gotten back into session after Winter Break, so they weren&apos;t expecting a big crowd. I got up there and tried my best, but it felt like milking a pigeon....too much effort for not enough results.
The next day we had a short jaunt to Carbondale, Illinois, a room that I had played more than a few times before. We got into town a little too early to check into the hotel, so we sought out a comic book shop that we knew of that was up the street between the hotel and the gig. I splurged a little, buying about $16 worth of new comics, including an issue of the Flash that I didn&apos;t remember I had already picked up. All the other books were really cool, but when I realized I already had the Flash book, I was more than a little upset. It&apos;s only thee bucks, but you can&apos;t really return it and more than that, how did I not remember that I just got the damn thing less than a week ago? I guess I was just going comic book crazy and picking things up willy-nilly. I griped about it all the next day and Mike diagnosed me as being burnt out.
The show at Mugsy&apos;s in Carbondale was not as good as it could have been, somebody decided that they should put a six-foot service aisle in the middle of the audience horizontally, which created a comedy &quot;moat&quot; that cut off most of the room. The stage itself is six feet off the ground, so the only way I could have been more detached from the audience is if I stood out in the parking lot and yelled the jokes through an air intake. I got heckled, and I could see that it was going to be a chatty crowd, so I raced through my set, and later, Mike told me that I told the audience to go fuck themselves about four times in the first ten minutes. Well, no wonder I didn&apos;t sell any CD&apos;s after the show.
In the car the next day, Mike gave me the lecture about doing comedy too many days in a row, too many weeks in a row, creates burnout, and that it happens to everyone. I felt a little bad about it, but a little better that it wasn&apos;t just me. The diagnoses of burnout requires the prescription of figuring out how to keep it fun and fresh, whether it&apos;s changing up your act or figuring out better ways to kill time during the day. I thought I had a pretty good system going, and I probably did because it took me five years to get to this point.
I had left my phone charger in the hotel room in Terre Haute, and we happened to be driving back through on our way to Thursday&apos;s show in Muncie, Indiana, so I called the hotel and asked them to check their lost and found for it. They told me they had a phone charger, but it turned out not to be mine, so I have to go out and find one, or else keep charging my cell phone in the car with the cigarette lighter charger I have. In Muncie, the big deal was the network premeire of &quot;Armed and Famous&quot; on CBS and the whole town was going to be watching the show because it was taped there. Consequently, they pushed our 8 o&apos;clock show back to 9 o&apos;clock because everyone else was going to be concerned with watching the show to see their friends and neighbors. The club had a big screen TV with the show on it, and we caught the last 45 minutes of it which featured a local guy, an older fellow that Mike named &quot;Kung Fu Crazy Man.&quot; He&apos;s a guy in his late 60&apos;s, early 70&apos;s who is a professional bar-hopper, and wherever he goes, he has to go through an intricate display of quasi-karate moves. When he was on screen, people went ape-shit because he was in the bar watching the show with them! Mike figured we were in big trouble if this guy was getting three applause breaks. After the show was over and it was our turn to take the stage, a bunch of people got up and left. We wound up performing for about 30 people, who were nice as could be, but a little redneck scary at certain times.
Friday morning, we grabbed breakfast at the hotel, which featured a free breakfast buffet of eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, coffee, and the regular assortment of bagels, muffins and donuts, as well as biscuits &apos;n&apos; gravy. I doubled up on the biscuits &apos;n&apos; gravy and had some sausage and eggs as well, and we started off on our 5 hours plus drive to St. Louis.
As we started getting closer to St. Louis, I mentioned to Mike that there was a good comic book shop in Collinsville, Illinois. We stopped at a convenience store and Mike thought he lost his wallet. I left him at the car to go through his luggage to step inside and use the gentleman&apos;s porcelanin convenience. I thought I only had to uirinate, but biscuits and sausage had other ideas. I committed an act of treason in that bathroom that could only be called a crime against humanity. Now, nobody&apos;s crap doesn&apos;t stink, but I guess I&apos;m a different animal, because even when I was a teen, I had been banished to the bathroom in the basement that the rest of the family rarely used....I can talk about it, but a man still hurts inside. Still, out of compassion for my fellow man, I usually relegate my bathroom action for facilities that will cause the least disturbance to others. Unfortunately, when I finished, who&apos;s outside the door waiting to get in but Mike with his thankfully found wallet. I passed him without a word, figuring he&apos;s going to learn what happened to me the hard way. I would have suggested that he use the women&apos;s room instead, they were both facilities for one with locks on the door, but when I mentioned it after the fact he said it was out of the question. I personally have no qualms about using the women&apos;s if some guy is taking too long in the gents&apos;. You gotta go, you gotta go.
So Mike treated me to a ranting soliloquy about how I caused global warming, extinction of animals, and was an alternate for the Jews at the Nazi gas chambers. I guess I&apos;m also a little upset when I walk into a cloud of someone else&apos;s making, but maybe Mike doesn&apos;t also deal them the way I sometimes do, so it&apos;s harder to accept. Long story short, he lived, and mocked me onstage Friday night late show.
We had delicious Ponderosa for lunch around 4 PM, and got to the Comedy Forum good &apos;n&apos; early. There was an ice storm brewing and a lot of people heeded the warnings to stay home, and our shows were sparsely attended. There is a story going around right now about two St. Louis area kids who have been missing for years, and they were found and returned to their families, and the club asked me to do a toast for them, which I obliged. I shouldn&apos;t be drinking the whiskey, but I do enjoy it so it was a white man&apos;s burden, I guess. I thanked God for the return of the kids and prayed for the safety of those still missing, and the crowd loved it. It almost made up for the rookie mc making the mistake of bringing me to the stage with Mike&apos;s intro. When he saw that it was me coming up the steps to the stage, he realized his error and asked to start over, and he went back to the first joke in his set, which got the laugh while I stood over at the side of the stage.
Second show was a wild &apos;n&apos; wooly affair, and I had already met several of the guests in the front lounge before the show as I was set up with my CD&apos;s for sale. I had a good second show, keeping in my mind to have fun and not just be funny, and it was uplifting. I did the toast again when they brought me the shot, keeping mindful to do it in the middle of the set rather than at the end so that Mike didn&apos;t have to follow that....it was a better choice, rhythm-wise.
During Mike&apos;s set, almost toward the very end, he said something to a young kid who mouthed off, and one of his buddies threw a beer bottle at the stage. The club staff and many members of the audience converged on the guy, and when we went to throw him out, Mike said &quot;Keep him here, I want to press charges and when I get off this stage, I&apos;m going to kick his ass!&quot; The kid bolted out the door and hauled ass, and the police never came. One kid stood up, ready to kill, and later we found out that he punched a guy in the head who looked like he was being abusive to his wife in the parking lot. He was obviously looking for somebody to pound....it wasa weird evening. I broke my merchandise drought by selling exactly one CD, and I gave vigilante guy a CD for sticking up for my friend, and I gave a DVD to a guy who was telling me that his 13-year-old son wanted to be a comedian. It&apos;s always nice to spread the good will.
We have two more shows tonight and then two days off. On the docket for today, there&apos;s an excellent beyond words Chinese buffet that we always go to when we&apos;re here, and I can hardly wait. The weather&apos;s still a little iffy, but I think the worst of it is behind us.
Have a great day, and recycle your bottles, don&apos;t throw them!

 All Apologies (Nirvana) 
Posted on 01/08/2007 at 01:53 AM
Wow, where does the time go?
Reporting after my three-day weekend and a jaunt through eastern Ohio and eastern Pennsylvania, I am positively exhausted.
Physically, I feel fine, but mentally, I&apos;ve been through so much drama I&apos;ve considered renaming my balls Damon and Pythias.
I left at a decent time on Thursday to get to my gig in Tuscarawas (actually, Uhrichsville), Ohio. It was an 8 PM gig, and I wound up getting there in time to shower, shave, and then enjoy a nice meal with headliner Carol Pennington (of Hysterical Management). The crowd was small, and I found out that we were the last show the club was going to be presenting for a while, and I considered that unfortunate, because I&apos;d played there twice before and the room had always been packed. I still had a good show, but the showroom was so cold, I wore my winter coat onstage.
The next morning, gripped by a bout of insomnia, I logged onto the internet on my laptop and got an instant message from Annette Lorenzo, a comic friend and student of mine. She was basically looking for work in February.
Well, she currently has an outstanding problem with another comic friend of mine, Mike Dambra. I replied that I thought she should make things right before I would consider taking her on the road, and she expressed her feelings that she was guilty of no wrongdoings and didn&apos;t need to apologize, and that I should call the other comic that was on the bill the night of the alleged wrongdoings. I said that I would, and logged off the internet and went back to sleep.
A few hours later, I&apos;m on the road, and Mike Dambra calls me and tells me that he just got a threatening e-mail from Annette&apos;s boyfriend, saying that he was going to boycott all of Mike&apos;s shows in North America, sic lawyers on him, and other such threats. Out of the gate, the first thing the boyfriend did was call Mike a racist (Mike is white and the boyfriend is not).
Well, I&apos;m in the car for the next six hours, so I can&apos;t read the e-mail, which Mike wasted no time in forwarding to me, but he&apos;s reading the thing to me word-for-word, which made for an interesting day. The next six hours became a constantupdating of this communication, and talking to my mother about my dad, who is experiencing some mild dementia, as well as the possible recurrence of lung cancer, which he was operated on for a few years ago. I also contacted Danny Brown, the comic that Annette asked me to speak with, and he, too, backed up Mike Dambra&apos;s story. So much for the only other material witness, Annette.
So I roll into Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania around 7:00 P.M. for a 9:00 P.M. show after getting more lost than I can ever remember being in a town I&apos;ve been to so many times before. I grabbed a hot shower, got into my show clothes and performed with mc Larry DeFelice (great impressionist and shortest guy I&apos;ve ever met in my life that wasn&apos;t actually a midget) and Joe Moffa (who I&apos;d been scheduled to work with several times in the past, but had always wound up working with someone else, instead). Both comics were great guys and a lot of fun to hang around with. I had been interviewed for a local alternative-type newspaper called the Electric City/Diamond City Weekly. I got a third of a page using my photo from my MySpace account and a nice write-up that only got one thing wrong (they called me biracial instead of my wife...no big deal, as far as I&apos;m concerned).
After the show, I used the wireless internet at the Best Western hotel adjoining the club (just perched myself in the lobby and hung out) and by this time, Mike had drafted a response to the original e-mail and posted both the original and the response on his myspace blog. For interesting reading, check it out at blog.myspace.picklesplace and prepare to read about 60 or so responses to the blog. I mocked Mike because he always gave me a hard time about writing a blog, because in the past I&apos;ve mentioned his name, and casual readers who don&apos;t know that he&apos;s one of my best friends in comedy or otherwise take my comments to mean that I&apos;m somehow mad at him, and now here he is, writing a blog, and he&apos;s got more comments for one entry than I get in thirty.
Saturday, I woke up early, around 5 A.M.....my room was hotter than the employee cafeteria at a crematorium, so I got up and walked across a vacant lot to a McDonald&apos;s, bought a paper and some breakfast and tried to lull myself back to sleep. I wound up getting up around 3:30 in the afternoon, which was good, because I was going to attempt to drive the 5 hours home after the second show, so it was to my advantage to sleep in to &quot;set my clock&quot; forward a few hours.
I ate lunch at a pizzaria called Mimino&apos;s that I had eaten at before...it&apos;s a couple of blocks away from the club in a Main Street Square sort of area, with coffee shops, newsstands and diners. They make a great submarine (which they call a hero), but they always get a little happy with the Italian dressing and you wind up with a paper plate full of soggy lettuce and onions that slid off your sandwich. They don&apos;t have a website, unless you count the one the spiders built under the booth near the bathrooms. Bada bing!
Our first show was jammed, and I utterly killed, and I&apos;m not one to say that; I prefer others to mention it, but they were just &quot;my type of crowd.&quot; The show was good all the way around, and the attendance was due to the &quot;Anniversary special&quot; the club was running, basically half price admission. Still, it paid off because even the second show was strong, and the crowd was a lot younger than they were used to getting, and I told them they should consider a college I.D. discount or some sort of late show special to encourage attendance. I&apos;m always like that, switching hats and offering clubs advice from my deep managerial experience.
I made the trip home without incident, rolling in at 6:30 in the morning, and finally wound down and hit the rack around 8. I didn&apos;t have any plans today except for one; hit the mall and pick up a pair of those Stephon Marbury $15 sneakers I&apos;d been reading about. Well, long story short, I got them today, and they are definitely a value. They are well made, look good, and they are comfortable. Congratulations to Stephon Marbury and a big thanks to Steve and Barry&apos;s for carrying this fine product.
My only other business of the day was to send Annette Lorenzo an e-mail expressing that I&apos;d spoken to Danny Brown and that he backed up the original telling of the story I&apos;d heard from Mike Dambra, only for Annette to call him a liar and impeach his credibility...so much for that, I guess. I decided to recuse myself and investigate the matter no longer, but I&apos;m not happy that the incident is now like the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about. Really, all she needs to do is apologize, but she&apos;s maintaining that there&apos;s nothing to apologize for, so it&apos;s an agreement to disagree. What else can be done? Nothing, I guess.
I leave with Mike Dambra Tuesday for Terre Haute, Indiana, the first date on a twelve day tour. I promise you, my loyal readers, that I will not steal drinks, put shot glasses in my purse, tell the club owners to go fuck their mothers, or put my feet on the bars and tell the bartenders what sexy fucking feet I have. I also promise not to get booed, go over my time, and scream at the other comics on the bill because I can&apos;t find the weed I stashed in my purse.
Have a wonderful week, I&apos;ll check in as the &quot;Sturm Und Drang&quot; tour with Mike Dambra rockets across the midwest, with stops in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

 Life Is A Carnival (The Band) 
Posted on 01/03/2007 at 12:16 AM
Hungover still? Yeah, me too.
But not hungover from alcohol, just the pace of trying to be a standup comic during the busiest time of year, New Year&apos;s Eve weekend.
My shows with Ray Salah at the (now defunct) Comix Cafe in Syracuse were canceled, and we were redeployed to the Rochester room. Ray hosted for the weekend and I helped out in a management capacity. We still got our full money, but it was a bit less satisfying than headlining my own show.
Sunday, New Year&apos;s Eve, we packed up the minivan and headed to Binghamton, New York, to perform as the Inner Loop Improv Troupe for the First Night celebration. My wife Pamela and our good friend and protege, Phil Sherman, rounded out the troupe.
We had two good shows and managed to get back to Rochester around 2 A.M. I then spent the night and most of the next day resting and recuperating. I fell off the stage at one point, leaving a small gash in my left leg, and I didn&apos;t even realize the skin was broken until the next day. Ouch.
So enough of all that, I promised a year-in-review report, and I will be as good as my word. Here we go....
January started out with an engagement at the RiverCenter Comedy Club in San Antonio, Texas. I almost didn&apos;t make it because my flight from Buffalo to Chicago was delayed, which meant I missed the flight from Chicago to San Antonio....I wound up flying standby, and made it to the show with 20 minutes to spare...and performed for 30 or so people. January also featured my first cancelation of the year, an engagement at the Lake Ontario Playhouse in Syracuse, which canceled a Thursday show on me, leaving me with shows on Friday and Saturday.
February, I was booked by Comedy Zone to play Harrisburg, Pennsylvania for Valentine&apos;s Day. The show was canceled.
March, I was scheduled to play the House of Comedy on St. Patrick&apos;s Day weekend. The booker forgot he gave me the dates, and I was canceled. I picked up a one-nighter in Medina, NY and still worked.
April, I did a banquet for the Rochester Transportation Council. It was a great paycheck for a small set in front of a corporate-type group, and they brought me up after doing a tear-stained tribute to their Executive of the Year, a man who just got done battling cancer. His widow accepted the award, and then I followed that. Thanks a lot. Also, I was canceled for a Thursday show in Utica, NY and gigs in Muskegon and Petoskey, Michigan. I did a cancer benefit in Battle Creek, Michigan, hosted by John Face, a comic from Albion, Michigan, and the show was attended by Mark Kolo from Funny Business. I had a great set, and it has paid off as Funny Business has started to offer me headlining work.
May, I was canceled for a headlining show in Syracuse, NY....does that town not like me or something?
June, I was canceled by Comedy Zone for a two-day run in Virginia, and had to cancel another date I picked up because it would have been stupid to drive to Virginia and back for just one day. Also, gas prices were peaking at this point. I wound up hosting at my home club for $120, but I actually sold some CD&apos;s while I was there, so it didn&apos;t suck too bad. Also, I made my first ever appearance at Catch A Rising Star at their location in Providence, Rhode Island.
July, I was canceled for a weekend, and did a Diabetes fundraiser that week....it seems that everytime I do a fundraiser, I get canceled, but then again, everytime I don&apos;t do a fundraiser, I get canceled. Also, I made a showcase appearance at the Cleveland Improv, and was booked off the strength of that showcase.
In August, I had a headlining week at my home club, the Comix Cafe in Rochester, get canceled. I rescheduled it to the previous week and wound up co-headlining with Mike Dambra, and we both got screwed on the money. The following week, I hosted at the club for Aries Spears (who bumped me) and we had a good time. Then I got canceled by Comedy Zone for a weekend in Johnson City, Tennessee, so I went to Florida a few days early with Pam and Harmony. This was the month of the big Florida trip for Grandpa Tetta to meet his granddaughter. The return trip, August 31 and September 1 and 2 were one-nighters for Comedy Zone, which were canceled because of the Labor Day weekend.
September was my first full weekend at the Cleveland Improv, and opening week of the NFL season. I also got a standing ovation (my first ever) at a show in Topeka, Kansas. Other than the September 1st and 2nd gigs, no cancelations to speak of, but a couple of gigs that I wish were; a gig in Spicer, Minnesota where they told me to &quot;go back where I came from,&quot; and a gig in Watertown, South Dakota where they either didn&apos;t understand me, or understood me and just didn&apos;t like me.
October, I was supposed to work at the Syracuse Comix Cafe, but the club didn&apos;t open, so I was canceled. That was two weeks worth of work. I wound up picking up some one-nighters, but for the most part, I didn&apos;t get on stage. The following week, I was scheduled for a weekend of work, and got canceled. I hosted at my home club, thanks to the generosity of my friend Ray Salah who stepped aside.
In November, I was scheduled to work a Friday-Saturday in Jackson, Michigan, and the Friday got canceled. I still did the Saturday, because the drive wasn&apos;t that bad. I headlined, and worked with Kate Brindle and Jesse Lundy. We had a good time, even though the crowd was sparse. Then I got canceled for a Thursday in Belmont, North Carolina at the Comedy Zone, but they paid for my hotel on the night off, so that&apos;s o.k. with me.
December, I was supposed to work at Traverse City, Michigan, but the staff didn&apos;t want to work, and I got canceled. I managed to replace the work in Toledo, Ohio, but I had to move a date back from 2007, which I managed to replace with other work the same day (phew). Which leads to last week, getting canceled in Syracuse when the Comix Cafe closed.
So what have we learned, students? Cancelations happen. If you work a job and you know where you&apos;re working each day, count your blessings. Some days I feel like Russell Crowe in &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; standing with the rabble at the docks hoping to be chosen.
I performed in 21 states and one Canadian province, and got canceled every month this year. And I still made more money than last year.
I&apos;m gearing up for this weekend, Thursday in Tuscarawas, Ohio and Friday and Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. I have both itineraries in hand, so no cancelations! But 2007 is a long year, so I&apos;m waiting for the shoe to drop.
Here&apos;s wishing you the very best! Hope your year is cancelation-free, prosperous and happy!

 Water Of Love (Dire Straits) 
Posted on 12/28/2006 at 10:24 AM
Time waits for no man, especially a man waiting for a plumber.
Yes, we&apos;ve got plumbing problems here at the apartment of love, nothing terrible, just a shower that won&apos;t turn completely off. It wouldn&apos;t be so bad, but it&apos;s the hot water that&apos;s leaking, and that can be costly, not to mention causing the house to run out of hot water more quickly than usual.
So I&apos;m up, waiting for the plumber...not a bad time to clue you in as to what&apos;s been going on the past week.
It was Christmas on Monday...hope yours was as good as mine...more about that later.
I finished up my shows in Toledo on Saturday night, working with Jon Ueberroth, all around nice guy and Toledo native, and John Face, of Albion, Michigan. Had a lot of nice feedback (much of it from Jon&apos;s family and friends) and sold a Christmas bonus&apos; worth of merchandise. Not bad for having originally been canceled and looking down the prospect of no Christmas money.
Steve Brewer, a very funny comic from Detroit, hung out and did a set Saturday late show. He&apos;s an &quot;edgy&quot; comic, and a good one. I like the edgy humor better than bland, observational stuff....not that observational humor can&apos;t be funny, but it doesn&apos;t take any risks. Steve and Jon have known each other for a while, and they hung out after Jon and I went to lunch. Jon took me to Tony Packo&apos;s, a hotdog place in Toledo with some modicum of celebrity after being featured in several M*A*S*H* episdodes courtesy of Jamie &quot;Klinger&quot; Farr, a Toledo native. The place was quite good, with nice food and ambiance...I recommend it if you&apos;re going to be in the area.
After lunch, I found gas at a Flying J truckstop for $2.11 a gallon! And it&apos;s nothing but death sent from Hell that I should be excited about such a bullshit fuel price. Regardless, my Flying J bonus card got me a penny off per gallon, so I actually paid only $2.10 a gallon, and my spirits were high (at least until I returned to New York State).
The hotel I was staying at was right next to a Speedway gas station (I have their bonus card, too) and I stopped in there a few nights in a row, getting late night munchies, and struck up conversation with the night clerk, a young ladynamed Vee. I wound up getting her and her boyfriend tickets to the show, and they actually showed up! A lot of times, people will say they are coming just to be nice, and then blow it off because they won&apos;t ever see you again, but I was pleasantly surprised when they came out, and afterwards, said they enjoyed the show. It&apos;s nice to spread the love whenever you can, it&apos;s good karma.
I drove home after the second show, hitting the road about 12:30 and getting home before daylight, around 6:30 in the morning. The drive was made a little easier courtesy of some tapes I found at a thrift store, the Rolling Stones &quot;Bridges to Babylon,&quot; Bruce Springsteen &quot;Darkness On The Edge of Town,&quot; Lyle Lovett live, I forget which, and a few others. Terrestrial radio along the 90 expressway can be dodgy as you make your way from Toledo to Cleveland to Erie, Pa, on up to Buffalo and into Rochester. You&apos;d think that towns like Sandusky, Ohio, Batavia, New York and others &quot;in the middle&quot; of the bigger cities would have some low-wattage rock or pop station, but they don&apos;t seem to.
I got a few hours of sleep before being pressed back into duty by my beautiful wife and Christmas angel, Pamela. It was off to the craft store and liquor store and grocery store and at one point I was in a photomat, and they don&apos;t have those anymore. I loaded the car with boxes, bags and many foods and beverages and made my way home. We needed to get ready for a Christmas party we were attending later in the evening, and wound up getting there around 9 P.M. The party was nice, and Harmony liked playing with the other children. We got back from the party around 12:30 and went to work putting together gift baskets for some of my wife&apos;s friends and family. They came out really nice and I was impressed with myself a little bit that I was able to put them together. I told Pam that her homemade soaps might sell better at her craft sales if she put them together into gift baskets....I was certainly pleased with the overall presentation of them, as faggy as that sounds.
Christmas day was low-key, with a nice dinner at Pam&apos;s grandmother&apos;s house, with the bulk of her Rochester-dwelling family there. After dinner, we drove around in the rain looking at Christmas lights and we took some pictures, ate potato chips in the car, and Harmony got a nice nap. Of course abig meal and the excitement of opening presents will do that to a youngster...I wish I slept so soundly and so readily in a car. Usually I have to be driving to fall asleep in a car.
Our Christmas was marred slightly by the news that my father was checked into a hospital down in Florida. He&apos;s a cancer survivor and was complaining of back pain, and the painkillers they gave him seem to be causing a mild dementia. My sister called this morning to tell me that Dad checked himself out of the hospital (which probably isn&apos;t good because they hadn&apos;t really finished doing all of the tests they needed to do) and that he was being mean and abusive to the nurses, my mother, and anyone else in earshot. My mom&apos;s been staying with him and took him to the hospital, which is really nice because they&apos;re divorced and she&apos;s really not obligated. So my sister&apos;s flying down there to settle everything down and hopefully get some sort of intervention going on Dad&apos;s behalf with his friends down there and my mom and I hope it works. If it doesn&apos;t, I&apos;m going to have to cancel some comedy work and head on down there myself.
Last night, my comedy buddy Mike Dambra and I went out to visit some friends who were doing a show in town, Steve Burr and Marianne Sierk. We were invited to perform, and because we&apos;re road dog comedy junkies, of course we said yes. We shared the stage with Steve, Marianne, Matt Rohr and another cat, last name D&apos;Amico, a thousand apologies that I don&apos;t remember his first name...my eyes are red and the plumber just got done working his magic on my leaky shower. I took the bullet and went on first, and did pretty well considering there wasn&apos;t much of a warm-up. I tried some new things and did some of my money-in-the-bank material to cushion the new stuff on both sides, and I was pleased with the set. They offered my ten minutes but I kept it to under seven, because there were already plenty of comics on the bill and I didn&apos;t want to be greedy (my New Year&apos;s resolution, by the way....don&apos;t be greedy with stage time). After the show, I ran into an old buddy, Alan Tanski, who is an employee of the U.S. Postal Service and a former member of my improv comedy group, the Inner Loop. We chatted for a bit, got our groceries and parted ways. It&apos;s funny who you run into when you stay up late.
Tonight&apos;s Syracuse with comedy buddy Ray Salah, one show tonight and one show tomorrow. It&apos;s a new club so I don&apos;t know what to expect, but I&apos;ll go in hoping for the best and try to make the best of the situation...it&apos;s another headlining shot, so even if attendance is not up to snuff, it&apos;s still a good experience, and I&apos;m looking forward to it.
So it&apos;s back to bed I go now, getting ready for work in a few hours and I&apos;d like to do it well-rested for a change. I&apos;ll check in before the New Year with my end-of-the-year recap, don&apos;t miss it because it&apos;ll be a doozy!

 No Leaf Clover (Metallica) 
Posted on 12/21/2006 at 06:06 PM
Today is the shortest day of the year...unless you&apos;re a road comic trying to kill time in his hotel room.
When I left this journal, I was recounting the Friday night that my feature act didn&apos;t show up. Saturday, he showed up. Jack Warren, a comic from Michigan by way of South Carolina, met up with me at the Lafayette Hotel in Marietta, Ohio. We had a very good show Saturday night, and spent the time before the show recounting how we had originally met during a layover in Omaha, Nebraska. Jack was touring with another comic from South Carolina and was performing the week after me, and I was staying at the condo on my day off. Jack and I wound up going to lunch, hitting the post office and visiting a thrift store. I didn&apos;t recognize him by his headshot when I saw it in Morgantown, because like most comics, he doesn&apos;t look like that anymore.
After the show, I drove home overnight which took around six hours. I entertained myself by listening to Christmas music on the radio, which helped put me in the holiday spirit. When I got home, all that spirit drained out of me as I was looking at the week before Christmas and the prospect of being unemployed.
Monday, I started working the phones and got a lead on a gig, a feature spot at Connxtions Comedy Club in Toledo, Ohio. The booker didn&apos;t know if they were going to need me, but that I would find out about it the next day. I found out Tuesday afternoon that the gig was on, and that I&apos;d be leaving Wednesday morning. My wife wasn&apos;t happy about me going away, but we both agreed that it was better that I be working than not, especially with her student loan payment being due.
Tuesday night, I went to Danny Liberto&apos;s open mic at Alfano&apos;s Italian restaurant. To say that I was mistreated was an understatement. They treated every comic on the bill so poorly, the only thing I can say is that the last time someone got treated that poorly at an Italian restaurant, Al Pacino had to fish a gun out from behind a toilet tank to do it.
Mike Dambra, one of my bestest friends in comedy (and otherwise) won the money, but that&apos;s because he got into a ragging match with the female bartender who wound up dumping a cup of ice water down his shirt. The exchange got so ugly that she couldn&apos;t retort, she had to resort to a physical attack. Well, the bar loved it and Mike won the money, which was good because he was having a bad day and needed the boost, I think.
So Wednesday, I drove to Toledo, arriving about two hours before showtime, and got to the club right on time, thirty minutes before showtime. I knew that the headliner was Toledo native Jon Ueberroth, but I also found out that my mc for the week is none other than Michigan&apos;s John Face, organizer of the Relay For Life cancer benefit that I am lending my talents to early this coming year. John and I met at the last Relay event that he organized this past Spring, and it was great seeing him again. Connxtions runs an &quot;open mic&quot; portion of their show to start out Wednesdays, and I met some of the local guys. My set was fun, although it started off a little unevenly as I tried to ad-lib some stuff and wasn&apos;t sure exactly what I wanted to say.
After my set, Steve Brewer, a headliner from Detroit who I&apos;ve worked with several times, took me aside because we apparently are doing a bit that is very similar, and he wanted to let me know as soon as possible lest there be any misconceptions from third parties that we are somehow doing the same bit and that it might be stolen. Come to find out, we were just working from a similar premise and move to different conclusions, but it&apos;s easy for confusion to reign under those circumstances, particularly because we work a lot of the same clubs. Well, Steve&apos;s a real professional and I admire his abilities and I really appreciated him approaching me the way he did because a lot of other comics would have been pissy about it, saying &quot;don&apos;t do this bit,&quot; or &quot;change your bit&quot; or whatever to protect their own interests. Steve is an intelligent guy, and again, we&apos;ve worked together before, so there were no problems from the get-go. I actually feel encouraged that I&apos;m thinking in the same vein as an established headliner, it makes me feel like I&apos;m moving in the right direction.
After the show, I did the pal-around thing with some of the guys, I shook hands and sold some CD&apos;s. There was a Christmas party of about 13 folks, and the boss bought them all a copy of my CD....that was excellent, as the money is always helpful. Today, I felt like a money magnet, because as I ventured out to my car to go get some lunch, there was about three dollars&apos; worth of change all over the ground next to my car. It looked as though someone dropped it and didn&apos;t feel it was worth picking up. Well, fuck that, I have a wife and daughter to support, so you&apos;re damn right I&apos;m picking it up! It actually totaled $3.06, so if you&apos;re a gambling person, maybe you play that three digit number in tonight&apos;s lottery....it&apos;s as good as any other, as far as I&apos;m concerned.
So I&apos;m a lucky guy, I&apos;d say.....finding work where there was none, finding money on the ground, and I also juggled around the week in March when I was supposed to come to Toledo and filled it with another gig, and I also secured a return date at the Rivercenter Comedy Club in San Antonio, Texas for March, which is a nice time to be in Texas. I also found a good comic book shop today and picked up new issues of Civil War: Frontline, Justice League of America, the new Exiles annual, and a What If? featuring Wolverine. Quite the treasure trove for one such as me, I&apos;d say.
I will probably wind up driving home overnight on Saturday to get the most mileage out of Christmas Eve day with my wife and daughter, finish our shopping and present delivering, and then indulge in our holiday get-togethers with family and friends. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll check in before the end of the week, so I&apos;ll wish you a safe and happy holiday season, and if you aren&apos;t on the Tetta family Christmas card list, it means I don&apos;t have your address. If that&apos;s the case, please forward that to me by e-mail at Yuksonme@aol.com and we&apos;ll add you to the fold.

 Sole Survivor (Asia) 
Posted on 12/16/2006 at 01:54 AM
Comedy is about survival. It shouldn&apos;t be like that, but it is.
The language about comedy even sounds like a fight for survival.....&quot;I killed them, I murdered them, I died, I bombed,&quot; and my favorite &quot;I ate it.&quot; I picture the comic as a cheetah or panther chasing down the audience antelope and either killing them or eating it.
But there&apos;s also the &quot;making a living&quot; survival thing to comedy....stringing along enough working days and weeks to make enough money to pay your bills, or doing comedy part-time and having a straight job to pay the bills while you pursue your dream.
I&apos;ve been surviving in both senses of the word.
This week I had a three-day week scheduled courtesy of Hysterical Management, headlining the metropoli of Mansfield, Ohio, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Marietta, Ohio. Earlier this week, I received notice that Mansfield was canceled as the room is reorganizing. That&apos;s fine and dandy, but I don&apos;t know anyone who appreciates having a third of their paycheck disappear with such short notice. I hold Hysterical faultless in the matter, as they are losing commission money in the deal, and the remaining work is still intact. Still, I decided to be proactive and use the time off to my advantage.
In Rochester, NY, we&apos;re lucky to have a resource called the Comedy Company, run by comic/booker Danny Liberto. Danny runs three open mics in Rochester on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, each carrying a $50 cash prize for the funniest comic. I decided to throw my hat in the ring and see if any of those prizes could be harvested. Even if I won all three of them, it wouldn&apos;t have replaced the earnings I lost due to the cancellation, but it would have been money in my pocket and an opportunity to get on stage and pal around with comics and friends from my hometown.
I showed up at Alfano&apos;s Italian Restaurant on Tuesday, and things went extremely well. It&apos;s a small neighborhood bar, and I had an advantage over the other comics on the bill as several of the bar patrons seemed to recognize me from my time managing the Comix Cafe, Rochester&apos;s full-time comedy club. I was a regular fixture on stage there during my tenure, and it paid off as I seemed to be the only comic who the audience deemed worthy of their attention. Regardless, I was awarded the $50 and I was happy to have it. It was the first week of comedy at the club, and I guess I helped kick things off with a bang, and I&apos;m happy I was there to help.
Wednesday, I met Danny at Slammer&apos;s Pub, a sports-themed bar in Greece, NY, north of the city. The only comics to show up were myself, Joe Cumbo (a very funny young man) and a kid from Buffalo who&apos;s name escapes me. The poor kid went up first with a set list, and basically vapor-locked and bailed without telling even one joke....I felt sorry for him driving a whole 65 miles to stand on stage stammering and not being able to even make a sentence, and then have to drive 65 miles back home. Joe went up and did very well, and I went up and did a melange of old and new material, working out some bits and using some tried-and-true stuff to keep the flow. Joe and I wound up splitting the $50, which was fine with me, I&apos;m not greedy. I then hung out with Joe and Danny and watched them play Quick Draw, and Joe won another $50 on one game, and could have quadrupled it to $200, but he didn&apos;t play the bonus option for the extra buck....oh well, live and learn.
Thursday night, Danny asked me to host his open mike at Sneaky Pete&apos;s bar in downtown Rochester. Sneaky Pete&apos;s is a tiny little neighborhood bar that is one flight of stairs down and a few blocks away from the Genessee River. There wasn&apos;t much of a crowd, but Joe wound up rocking the eight or nine people there and winning himself the cash prize, and I scooped up the money for hosting. It was combat comedy to say the least, but it was money in my pocket and I was happy to have the work.
Today I headed down to the Ramada Inn in Morgantown, West Virginia, and long story short, my opening act didn&apos;t show up. I wound up doing the entire show myself, but for no extra funds because the checks were written ahead of time, and if there&apos;s any bonusing to be done, it&apos;ll have to be done after the fact. I had a lot of fun with it, but now I&apos;m pretty tired and ready to get some sleep, but have to do my regular &quot;wind down&quot; thing to shake off the adrenalin of the night. Tomorrow I&apos;ll hit the bank, cash my check, take advantage of the free breakfast buffet here at the hotel (yummy bacon and pancakes!) and make my way to the historic Lafayette Hotel in Marietta, Ohio. It&apos;s only two hours away, but then I&apos;m looking at a six hour drive home which I&apos;m not looking forward to, but the weather&apos;s nice, and I&apos;ve certainly driven farther and in worse conditions.
Next week I&apos;ve had my entire weekend in Traverse City, Michigan canceled, so I&apos;m back to &quot;survival&quot; mode, and I&apos;ll probably hit all the open mics in an effort to make the best of a bad situation. There&apos;s still the possibility that work will arise, but if it doesn&apos;t, there&apos;s nothing I can do about it. I&apos;ll enjoy the time home with my wife and daughter, celebrate Christmas, and then get back to work...the work of surviving.

 Lay It On The Line (Triumph) 
Posted on 12/10/2006 at 08:43 AM
God, I feel like a wetback!
Reporting from my cozy home in Rochester, NY after a delightful weekend at the House of Comedy in Niagara Falls, Canada. I did two shows for our neighbors to the north, actually, if you look at the map, our neighbors to the west, but that would be nitpicking.
The highlight of the weekend was passing through Canadian immigration; I didn&apos;t want to arouse any suspicions that I might be working in Canada without proper paperwork, so I had to explain why I was coming into the country. There is a lovely restaurant in the Americana hotel on Lundy&apos;s Lane called Jack Tanner&apos;s, and I explained that I was meeting some friends for dinner there. I wasn&apos;t sure if that would raise any eyebrows, because the restaurant is just a notch below Applebee&apos;s, and why would I drive 90 miles from home just for some chicken fingers? Well, it&apos;s for the company, isn&apos;t it? I explained that I was meeting good friend Marc Sinodinos, a young man who describes his name as &quot;so Greek my ass hurts&quot; and his girlfriend Kendra.
Still, there&apos;s so many questions to answer...the customs guy makes the baby seat in the back of my car...&quot;You&apos;ve got a child then?&quot; &quot;No, I like to sit in it and pretend I&apos;m the world&apos;s largest infant!&quot; &quot;How much money do you have on you?&quot; &quot;Why, do you need a loan til&apos; payday?&quot; These got good laughs on stage, also a new bit that I wrote about Sharper Image that I came up with while listening to a couple of college radio jocks talking while I drove home past Bucknell University last Monday. It&apos;s a TV clean bit that turns out to be a funny act-out bit, therefore has no place in my dick-joke riddled corpse of an act.
Friday night there were a couple two-three Christmas parties on tap in the club, including a group from St. Kevin&apos;s, a Catholic high school. Of course, I did the dirtiest show I&apos;ve ever done, stopping only ten minutes from closing and asking if there were any nuns or priests from the school in attendance. I asked for forgiveness about all the masturbation material (a Ralph Tetta comedy staple) and closed with some pointed political material. I apologized for the Bush administration, mentioning that our nation&apos;s leader can&apos;t lie and chew gum at the same time, which caused the room to erupt into laughter and applause. Saturday was much more of the same. Also, there was a young man in the next-to-front row who had curly black hair and a bushy beard. I was talking about the difference between men and women, what makes them sexually attracted to each other, and that women are tactile, utilizing their sense of touch, and that clean-shaven men felt good to them. I told the kid with the bushy beard, &quot;Not only are you not getting laid, I wouldn&apos;t let you on an airplane, either!&quot; His skin color wasn&apos;t that dark, but his thick black beard definitely gave the visual shorthand for Middle Eastern if not full-blown Arabic, and the crowd got a good laugh off it. He was a good sport, and his buddies gave him the ribbing. It was a nifty comedy moment.
Marc wound up working on both shows, featuring for me the first night and then running upstairs to work a corporate gig in the banquet hall of the Americana. He came down sweating, mumbling about &quot;the worst show ever,&quot; and then explained that it wasn&apos;t HIS worst show ever, it was THE worst show ever. I&apos;ve been there, friend Marc, I&apos;ve certainly been there. Try making a room full of engineers and their wives laugh...it&apos;s excruciating. Our show was rounded out by a lad named Graham Davidson, who is relatively new in the business, and dresses like that jackass from Green Day with the black shirt and white tie, although the kid&apos;s about two inches shorter than Yao Ming. I broke his balls about his stage attire, and at one time I even told him that he looked like he got kicked out of the Strokes. Thank God I don&apos;t drink, imagine what an asshole I&apos;d be with three or four bourbons in me.
Today I&apos;m going to put our Christmas lights up, nothing ostentatious, just a few strings in the front two windows of the house, just enough to light up our otherwise bleak little ghetto street. We have our tree set up in the hallway, and Harmony likes watching the colored lights, and Christmas means so much more to me now that Pam and I have a little baby daughter. I&apos;m getting excited about the season, and even though I had work fall out on the weekend before Christmas, I have a couple of leads to fill it in, make some of that Christmas money, and even if they don&apos;t come to fruition, I&apos;ll enjoy being home with my family.
This week, it&apos;s off to Ohio and West Virginia for three days working in the headlining spot (come to think of it, all the work I&apos;ve got in December is headlining...I must be doing something right) and at some point, I have to get my improv group together for a run-through for our big New Year&apos;s Eve gig in Binghamton. Busy, busy, busy....and there&apos;s still Christmas cards to write as well....oh, well, I usually don&apos;t get to those until the last minute anyway, so if you don&apos;t get a card until Tuesday the 26th, please don&apos;t be insulted, it&apos;s just the way I roll.
Have a great week, and enjoy the season!

 Tired (Foo Fighters) 
Posted on 12/06/2006 at 01:43 AM
Tired. Home. Finally.
North Carolina tour over. Fun. Tiring. Three headliners. Five cities. Six days. Nine shows. 12 hours home. 2100 miles.
Tape deck&apos;s dying, radio all the way. Cold, but no snow. Greensboro MC wants to buy my closing bit. Chris Wiles. Nice guy. Too much liquor. Whiskey when I shouldn&apos;t have.
Mike McCarthy, Comedy Barbarian. Nice guy. Good stories. Long time, no see. Good friend. Dirty comic, like me. Fun week.
Sunday, Raleigh. My sister Nickki and her husband, little visit. Sports bar, watched the Bills play. Nice visit, frustrating game. Maybe next year.
Route 15, Pennsylvania. Long road home. Nicely decorated, holiday season. Made me homesick, made me drive faster.
Got home, checked e-mails. Tons of work for 2007, pair of cancelations for 2006. Checked books. Bad year, 2006...down a grand from last year...too many cancelations this year. Like Buffalo, mathematically eliminated. Depression sets in.
Too tired to write more. Next journal, more words. Maybe some verbs.
Thank you.

 Love That Dirty Water (The Standells) 
Posted on 12/01/2006 at 04:42 PM
Most of the country is freezing and dealing with snow, and I&apos;m in North Carolina sweating my balls off!
Greetings from the Red Carpet Inn, the preferred lodging for the comedy talent for the Greensboro, North Carolina Comedy Zone, a club I&apos;ve played so many times now I&apos;ve lost count. I don&apos;t know why they call this place the Red Carpet, because they don&apos;t have red carpets, and I certainly don&apos;t feel like I won an Oscar or anything, but they have wireless internet, so they can call the place whatever they damn well please.
I&apos;m chilling out, getting ready for my shows tonight, which I&apos;m very much looking forward to after the &quot;road-house&quot;-ey last two nights in Goldsboro and Greensville respectively, where the crowds were nice if not very substantive in numbers or accuity, if you know what I mean. I worked with alcoholic headliner Monte Allen who did an excruciating 15 shots of Tequila on Wednesday, and my liver spent the evening hiding behind my pancreas just watching him do it. And lest you think I&apos;m being mean or judgmental, Monte introduced himself to me as an alcoholic, so that&apos;s his language and not mine. I enjoyed his company and we had nice conversation.
On Sunday, I&apos;m visiting my sister Nickki and her husband Dennis who live in Garner, NC, and we&apos;re going to a sports bar that will be carrying the Buffalo Bills game. The Bills are blacked out in Western New York for the second home game in a row, because they didn&apos;t sell out, and that&apos;s a shame because they are technically the smallest market in the NFL (actually, Green Bay is the smallest, but the team is community owned so they fill the stadium every week regardless). Buffalo is playing the 9-2 San Diego Chargers, and if the weather is shitty, it might be the Bills&apos; only hope. They&apos;re not stopping the run very well, and LaDanian Tomlinson is leading the league in rushing, or at least in the top three spots, I forget which. It could get ugly early, and I don&apos;t want my reward for being somewhere else to beat the blackout to be watching my team get thumped.
Not much to report, other than tonight and tomorrow I&apos;ll be working with Mike McCarthy, the Comedy Barbarian, who I haven&apos;t worked with in 15 years since we did a college gig in Upstate New York at Alfred State College. Mike had a reputation at the time for being a dirty act, and I got a phone call from the college a couple of weeks before asking me about that rumor. I had already done my homework and got the inside scoop from a Boston comedy buddy (Mike&apos;s home base at the time) who told me Mike was indeed a pretty blue act, but I wasn&apos;t gonna throw the guy under the bus, so I pled ignorance and kept my mouth shut. I was happy that I was working with him, because I figured if I screwed up and did something that was over the line, they&apos;d never remember it after Mike did his thing. It was like a license to kill! Mike has since moved to Florida, and we&apos;ve communicated over the internet, but it&apos;ll be nice to work with him again.
O.K., I&apos;m gonna iron a shirt and grab a nap, y&apos;all be cool, now, y&apos;hear?

 Dreams (Fleetwood Mac) 
Posted on 11/29/2006 at 09:07 AM
You wanna be a comic? I&apos;m pretty sure that the life I lead would kill you dead.
It&apos;s feast or famine in this business. One minute, you&apos;re living high on the hog, flush with comedy money, and the next, you&apos;re rolling pennies for gas money. I&apos;m not proud. Right now, I owe my daughter Preschool Harmony (that&apos;s what she calls herself), a two-and-a-half year old girl, about $200 that I took from her piggy bank. Where does a toddler get that kind of money? From Daddy, who put all his money in there in the first place because Mommy told him to.
I got spoiled on Thanksgiving week. I worked at home with my good friends Sky Sands and Mike Glosek, filling that cushy middle slot and selling some good product. Thursday was a day off for Thanksgiving and remembrance, and a nice restaurant cooked meal-the compromise when your wife and daughter don&apos;t eat meat, and you still want a slice or two of roast turkey.
The shows were good and I spent the week trying to be the buffer between Mike (a rather &quot;salty&quot; act) in the mc spot and Sky (who prefers to work clean) headlining. The late shows were young kids and there isn&apos;t much you can do except demand their attention and be rude as possible, or else they float away like you&apos;re an internet page that&apos;s taking too long to load.
A single day off to hit the bank, do laundry and run errands, and I&apos;m looking down the barrel of another 12-hour drive....didn&apos;t I just do this? I&apos;m scheduled to play Lake Norman, North Carolina on Tuesday night. Lake Norman&apos;s just outside of Charlotte, which is where I was the week before last. I&apos;ll be driving through the town of Summersville, West Virginia, proud recipient of $155 of my speeding ticket money. I hope they choke on their biscuits, those bastards.
So I get everything ready for a death drive on Tuesday, a 4 A.M. wakeup call and I go to bed around 10 PM, only to be awoken by my daughter at 11:30 (Daddy! Wake up, Daddy!) and don&apos;t really get back to sleep until 2 A.M. I reset my clock for 5 A.M., and drift off to sleep.
Only I don&apos;t sleep the whole time....I wake up 20 minutes before the alarm, and figure I&apos;ll get a jump on the day, even though I&apos;m 40 minutes behind the 8-ball. I still have it planned that I&apos;ll get to the gig a couple of hours early, and maybe I&apos;ll take a nap.
So I shower, dress, and finish packing. I kiss my wife and daughter and load the car, hop in and start the ignition, only I&apos;m greeted with dead battery. I didn&apos;t drive the car the whole week I was home, and the battery went dead from non-use, I guess. Luckily, my mother-in-law parks on the street, and I have a key for her vehicle, so I spring into action, pulling the car into the driveway and executing a jump start. Now I&apos;m ready to go.
Only my oil light is on. My car leaks oil when I take it on long trips (which is all the time), so now it&apos;s dry. I use synthetic oil, so you&apos;re never really &quot;out&quot; of oil, but who wants to take chances? I drive to Jiffy Lube, as it&apos;s 6:30 and all of the auto parts stores that are only blocks from my house are closed. Jiffy Lube also is closed until 8:00 A.M., and I can&apos;t wait that long. So I head to Wal-Mart, up the road.
Wal-Mart&apos;s open, but it&apos;s not 24 hours open, so it&apos;s open for employees to come in. I&apos;m not an employee, and they know it, and I have to stand on the carpet for 10 minutes until they &quot;officially&quot; open at 7 A.M. So I stand there and wait until I&apos;m released, and head to the automotive section. Three quarts of Quaker State Full Synthetic, and I&apos;m ready to go, only now I have another problem....my hood won&apos;t latch. I can get it to close and click to the thumb latch, but it won&apos;t click all the way down. Time is melting away, and my blood pressure is rising like corn futures in the Spring.
I head further down the road (I&apos;m so far west I&apos;m almost in Buffalo by now) to Vanderstyne Toyota, my regular mechanics who work on the car. They&apos;re closed tighter than a drum. So now I&apos;m completely at a loss. I can&apos;t drive more than 40 miles an hour with any reassurance that my car hood won&apos;t go flying up into my face, and at 40 miles an hour, I might as well be driving to Mars, there&apos;s no way I&apos;m gonna make an 8 P.M. show.
I head towards home and drive past Ralph Pontiac Honda, and notice their service department is open, and they have no customers. Hoping against hope, I make a U-turn and pull in.
I explain my situation and as I have neither a Pontiac nor a Honda, I&apos;m a little embarassed asking for help, but figure the service shouldn&apos;t be more than I can afford. I left most of my money home with Pam to pay bills, but figured if the repair was ridiculous, I could go home and get the money. Steve Pecora, the service man on duty at Ralph, was familiar with the Corolla because his wife has the same car. He got under the hood and after messing around with screwdrivers and some WD-40, found the part that was failing to release and got it to work. I sheepishly asked what the charge would be, and he told me &quot;no charge today.&quot; I want to point out that that kind of generosity is not often found in the automotive repair business, and this guy is getting a nice fruit basket from me this Christmas. I don&apos;t begrudge Vanderstyne for not being open at such an early hour, but they were happy to take my $700 for auto emissions equipment last month, and it feels funny that they weren&apos;t there when I needed them. Also, they popped the hood to put that equipment in, didn&apos;t they notice that the hood wasn&apos;t closing properly? This isn&apos;t a new problem, you think they would&apos;ve fixed it, or at least mentioned it to me. My faith is definitely being tested here.
So now it&apos;s 20 minutes before 8, and I&apos;m really cutting it close. To make a long story short, I motor the 728 miles to Lake Norman, arriving just before 7 P.M. if you&apos;re keeping track, that&apos;s 11 hours and 20 minutes later. I averaged 64.4 miles per hour the whole trip, and that includes when I was standing there pumping gas (three stops for that), in line at the drive-thru getting something to eat (twice) and stopped for rush hour traffic/construction/accident slowdowns (one each). In other words, I was speeding most of the way. I&apos;m not proud, again, but drastic times call for drastic measures.
I got to the hotel, and instead of that nap I&apos;d been craving, I got a nice hot shower and got my ass to the gig. And that wasn&apos;t even easy because the decrepit desk clerk sent me in completely the wrong direction. I had to call the club three times to get reoriented, and made it with ten minutes to spare. I never understand how people who are FROM a community can be so dismally poor at directing strangers to destinations in or around that community.
The show was absolutely the best show I could put on, despite the fact that even after a nice hot shower, I was hallucinating. My redneck audience (oh BOY were they redneck, not that that&apos;s a bad thing) were easy to read, but I insisted on testing them with material you had to think about (bad judgement brought on by the hallucinations). I wasn&apos;t unhappy with the show as a whole, and headliner James Sibley went up and did his &quot;aw shucks&quot; hillbilly humor and they ate him up with a spoon. He was fun to watch, even though I almost fell asleep in my chair twice from exhaustion.
Today, it&apos;s off to Goldsboro, North Carolina, stop number 2 on my 6-day whirlwind tour of the &quot;First In Flight&quot; state, and today it&apos;s my sister Nickki&apos;s birthday, so if you see her, wish her a happy one. Right now, I&apos;m going back to bed for an hour and let the images in my head melt through my eyes. And by the way, when I talk about hallucinations, I&apos;m not just waxing metaphorically, I actually see small moving objects just outside of my peripheral vision, like small bugs or animals flying past. It&apos;s very distracting when I&apos;m driving, and I&apos;ve hit the brakes more than once to avoid something that wasn&apos;t there. Just thought you should know.
Pleasant dreams.

 Radio Song (R.E.M.) 
Posted on 11/21/2006 at 02:02 PM
O.k., so Michael Richards is apparently doing my act in Los Angeles...how exactly does a small-time nobody like me with no financial resources get him to cease and desist?
I&apos;m home after my wonderful weekend in Belmont, North Carolina. The Comedy Zone there in Starz Restaurant in a neat little room, 60 seats, maybe, and one of the nicest staffs you&apos;ll ever meet. I checked in Thursday to the Holiday Inn, which is a short ten-minute drive away, closer to the heart of downtown Charlotte.
I was working with headliner Robert York of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Robert&apos;s a variety act, he juggles, balances a cowboy hat on his nose, and cracks an 11-foot bullwhip over the heads of the audience. If that doesn&apos;t sober ya up, I don&apos;t know what will. Robert&apos;s good people, and I&apos;ve known him for several years, so we had a good time working together. The room was rated PG-13, but I found that you can get away with a lot as long as it&apos;s funny and not disgusting. I gots plenty of that funny stuff, and I try to walk around the sticky parts whenever possible, if you get my drift.
Friday&apos;s early show was fun, we had some latecomers arrive during my set, and I had to address them, because it&apos;s such a small room that it&apos;s perfectly obvious that four people are coming in and seating themselves near the stage. I did a lot of impromptu stuff and was able to direct a lot of set material towards their table, and we had great fun. It reinforced the illusion that I was making all this great comedy up as I went along, the illusion that most comedians strive for.
Unfortunately, the late show was canceled for lack of patronage. We probably could have done the show for the five people that showed up, but the club opted out.
Saturday, Robert and I decided to take the restaurant up on their employee discount and had lunch together, and we wound up talking about art, culture, the fine art of finding treasures in thrift stores, and a few hours&apos; worth of like-minded conversation. It was definitely a welcome change of pace. I caught the tail end of the Ohio State/Michigan game, and headed to the club.
Saturday&apos;s shows were excellent, well-attended and fun, but I had a dark cloud hovering over me in the form of conflicting weather reports as to what I&apos;d be driving home in....some called for snow, some called for just rain showers, but either way, I wasn&apos;t pleased. I had 11 hours and 45 minutes in front of me, and snow can definitely make the driving treacherous and slow.
After getting paid and settling up for my food tab for the weekend (they graciously let the hotel tab go....hooray!), I headed back to the hotel, packed up, and started my way northward. I don&apos;t exactly know how I made it as far as I did, but somewhere around 5 o&apos;clock in the morning, one of West Virginia&apos;s finest clocked me at 75 mph in a 55...that&apos;s gonna hurt...it&apos;s my second West Virginia speeding ticket of the year, and their modus operandi seems to be that they park themselves at the bottom of a hill (and mountainous West Virginia&apos;s got plenty of them) and as you coast downhill, you almost always wind up heading toward a town, and the speed limit comes down from 70 to a 55, and you get nabbed. I haven&apos;t called yet, but that&apos;s probably gonna be in the $160 range. Shit.
I stopped driving around 7 A.M. when my ability to read road signs had left me. I saw signs but couldn&apos;t put the letters together into words, so I pulled off at an exit that didn&apos;t have anything but an RV dealership. I pulled into their driveway, which was closed by a big swinging metal gate, and put my seat back, put my sweater hood over my eyes and began to doze. Around 9 A.M., someone came to open the dealership, and I must have noticed that someone was in the area, because my eyes flicked open and I craned my head up to see a man walking toward the gate....I must be part whitetail deer or something.
I put my seat back up, put the car into drive and headed north again. I wound up arriving home around 3:30 in the afternoon, prodded on the last few hours by getting to listen to my beloved Buffalo Bills beating the Houston Texans on the radio. A little snow fell, but nothing on the level of what I was expecting. I probably could have stayed at the hotel and slept in, and gotten home safely a few hours later and without the speeding ticket, but what&apos;s done is done and I can&apos;t change that. I somehow think that God has been telling me the last few months that I&apos;m just not meant to have any money. I know I have a tendency to mismanage it, paying bills and buying food for my baby and stuff like that....I&apos;m going to have to learn to tighten my belt.
This week is a homestand at the Comix Cafe in Rochester with my buddy Sky Sands. I&apos;ve known Sky for a long time, too, and it should be fun working with him again...we haven&apos;t really shared a stage together since a year ago this summer, and Wednesday night, the night before Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest club nights of the year, so I&apos;m really looking forward to it.
Have a Happy Thanksgiving, watch the roads, and save me a drumstick!

 Too Much Time On My Hands (Styx) 
Posted on 11/17/2006 at 03:37 AM
Good morning my red-eyed speedfreaks. If you are up at this hour, you are either a night-shifter, a milkman getting the jump on his day, a fisherman, or you&apos;re hopped up on the jobabba juice. Regardless, good morning, amen, and good morning.
I&apos;m chilling out in the Hee-to-the-Eye, Holiday Inn, in Charlotte, North Carolina. I started out my little jaunt by heading out to Huron, Ohio, gateway to Sandusky, and a show at a club called i5&apos;s, which is an abbreviation for &quot;It&apos;s 5 o&apos;clock Somewhere.&quot; Well, showtime was at 8, but it might as well have been at 5, because we only had about 20 people. They were nice enough, but how do you rock 20 people? If I was a drummer and I threw my sticks into this crowd, they would have hit the floor. I worked with a comic who shall remain nameless who I caught pilfering a line or two from a big-name comic&apos;s HBO special....not a classy move, even in front of 20 people. He&apos;s a guy I&apos;ve worked with before so we had a nice chit-chat, but nothing beyond that. It&apos;s a shame because his own stuff is plenty funny....I guess headlining is a different sport for some.
Wednesday, it was on to Kelsey&apos;s in Bluefield, West Virginia, and a reunion with my pal R. Bruce from Fredericksburg, Virginia. Bruce and I have been friends for almost 13 years now, and he&apos;s one of those guys that I&apos;ll see once a year, and we just pick up right where we left off. We did our show for about 50 West Virginia hillbillies, and from past experience, I knew I really had to just pound it out to them....you take a pause, and they&apos;ll start a conversation or heckle or do some other stupid thing to stop the show. Bruce did his thing and showed off for me a little, playing some of his new songs (he&apos;s a guitar guy) that he knew I hadn&apos;t heard. I contributed a line to one of his songs, and he goes out of his way to mention it from the stage everytime we work together. It&apos;s nice if not totally necessary, but he&apos;s a gentleman and that&apos;s how gentlemen conduct themselves.
We hung out after the show, showing off pictures of children (my kid, his grandkids) and talking business. I was bummed to be spending my 40th birthday away from home, but it was nice to at least be with a friend for it. I didn&apos;t have cake, but there were pop tarts in the vending machine, and I had a brown sugar cinnamon one...yummy!
While I was driving to Bluefield, I worked the phones, not for comedy work but to figure out where I was gonna stay on Thursday, my day off. I called the Holiday Inn, but they were interested in charging me $129 for one night, and I was interested in them kissing my black ass. The Comedy Zone (where I&apos;ll be playing on Friday and Saturday) is getting a drastically reduced rate, and I talked the club into extending my reservation to Thursday, which got the aforementioned rate (I&apos;ll spill it....it was $45....much better than $129, eh?). Katie, the big kahuna over at Starz, graciously did the legwork making the reservation and paid for the room in advance, and they&apos;ll take the difference out of my check for the week. It&apos;s nice being able to spend the whole week in one place, and with a Holiday Inn, you can&apos;t hardly go wrong....wireless internet, restaurant on the premises, no bars on the windows, you know, the good stuff.
I took a nice nap which turned out to last until almost 10:00, and I hadn&apos;t had dinner, so I headed out to find some chow, and I ran into hypnotist Rich Guzzi in the lobby....Rich started out as a standup comic back when I ran the room in Rochester, and he remembered me....we had a nice chat, and might have lunch together tomorrow or the next day. He&apos;s playing at the Comedy Zone&apos;s main room in Charlotte this week (they have three, plus a one-nighter in Lake Norman just north of here, that I&apos;m actually doing in two weeks). I&apos;m working with Robert York this weekend, so it&apos;s gonna be like a comedy frat house up in this hotel because the comics from the Matthews, NC room will be staying here, too. I&apos;m wondering if my old buddy T.L. Johnson will be in town....he lives here, and I&apos;ve known him for several years from his time in Rochester.
I really need some sleep....I tried to buy a soda from the vending machine right outside my door, and the Diet Pepsi was sold out, relegating me to purchase Diet Mountain Dew. I&apos;ve had three of them tonight, and I&apos;m so jacked from the caffeine that I&apos;m ready to challenge a bunch of guys in a meth lab to a staring contest.
More foolishness about the shows later this weekend. Have a happy!

 A Pirate Looks At 40 (Jimmy Buffet) 
Posted on 11/14/2006 at 01:14 AM
I got my car back today; it was a good feeling and horrible at the same time....$710 after tax for emissions work on the engine. It felt good to drive, though, like it was getting more air or something, just responding to the gas pedal and moving without hesitation.
We bought a Christmas tree for Harmony today....a small one, but an artificial one with colored lights, it&apos;s about 4 feet tall, so for Harmony, it&apos;s just right. This is the first year that she really knows about Christmas, I think, so it felt good and right to pick it up today and set it up and watch her wonderful, beautiful brown eyes soak up the wonderment of it all. I get maudlin, joyous, overly romantic and sullen this time of year, it&apos;s a time when I feel close to God and I lay all of my hopes and dreams at his feet and ask forgiveness for my vanity, sloth, and a host of other sins. Buying Harmony a tree definitely makes me feel more hopeful and positive; she doesn&apos;t know about car repair bills and canceled comedy shows (and I hope she never will).
So the big news is that I turn 40 on Wednesday...the first of the three Tetta kids to cross that black line. Nickki&apos;s happily married (after an early misfire) and working a good job in North Carolina, Chris just got a promotion at the radio station he&apos;s working at, and he&apos;ll get to work a more steady schedule so that he can enjoy time with his wife and two children. I&apos;m getting into a car tomorrow morning and leaving and won&apos;t return until late next Sunday night, the eve of my 6th wedding anniversary. I&apos;ve been a little wound up about this turning 40 business, and what it all means. I read an article in a men&apos;s fitness magazine (several years ago) that described 40 as the perfect time in a man&apos;s life; knowledge and experience coupled with the physical energy to make the best use of them. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s true, I don&apos;t feel very energetic, much less knowledgeable or experienced.
My good friend Kevin Naughton told me, &quot;You&apos;ll be 50 someday and wishing you were 40, so enjoy it.&quot; That seemed kind of simple to me, but correct if not inspiring.
I have to admit that I don&apos;t know what life is. All I know is what life isn&apos;t.
Life isn&apos;t about the foolish pursuit of wealth and material things. High ticket electronics make you dependent on them, and then they break down. Clothing wears and frays, and low ticket items that you think will make you happy wind up on a table at your garage sale, sold cheaply and without hesitation.
Life isn&apos;t about worrying. Nature corrects itself, and your worry neither adds to nor subtracts from the process. The Bible says this well, that worry will not turn one white hair on your head back to black. It&apos;s true.
Life isn&apos;t about anger or grudges. Most of the time, the person you are angry with or have a grudge against doesn&apos;t even know it. So you waste your time and increase your blood pressure over someone who doesn&apos;t even know you have a problem with them.
Life isn&apos;t about waking up to alarm clocks or drinking coffee to &quot;get going.&quot; If you have to wake up this way, you aren&apos;t done sleeping and you&apos;re just wearing your body out and forcing your mind to operate before it&apos;s ready. Not smart at all.
I guess I do know what life is about, maybe just a little.....life is about reconcilliation, mending fences and helping people. Life is about listening more than talking, giving more than you expect to return, teaching what you know and learning what you can. Gayle Sayre&apos;s book &quot;I Am Third,&quot; which was made into the TV movie &quot;Brian&apos;s Song&quot; comes from a quotation of his, &quot;God is first, my family is second and I am third.&quot; I can&apos;t argue with that.
40 is coming and it&apos;s not a death sentence, but it is a line of demarcation in my business. Comedy and show business worship youth, and I have none to offer anymore. I still haven&apos;t received my big break! And yet, the success stories of Jimmie Wiggins (google him if you don&apos;t know), Rodney Dangerfield and the likes of David Letterman and Jay Leno (who all got their breaks after the age of 40) give me inspiration and hope. If nothing else, I&apos;ve got the easiest job in the world, one that gives me satisfaction if not material reward.
Is that knowledge or wisdom, I wonder?

 Jackson (June Carter and Johnny Cash) 
Posted on 11/12/2006 at 02:37 AM
Hello from Jackson, Michigan, home of the Jackson Comedy Club. I headlined a show this evening with feature act Jesse James Lundy, guest performer Kate Brindle and MC Chris Young. Our crowd was small but spirited, and I had fun in my closing role, despite a 7-hour drive across Canada and into Michigan.
My weekend originally included a Friday show, but the club hasn&apos;t been drawing well, so they cut the Friday show. It&apos;s a shame, because it&apos;s a really nice room with good sound and lights, and also I really could have used the money this week. I took my car in to (finally) get my New York State inspection, and the repairs necessary to get it up to snuff were $600-some-odd dollars (before tax) which put an ass-whuppin&apos; on the family finances. I actually took my wife&apos;s car to the gig this weekend because we couldn&apos;t really afford to get my car out of the shop without taking all our scratch....I needed X amount of money for gas, so I wound up taking the Mazda, which doesn&apos;t get as good a mileage as my Corolla.
The only thing that really brought a smile to my face this week, other than having good quality time with my wife and daughter, was the election results on Tuesday and the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld. I have had an itchy asshole about that guy ever since the &quot;hillbilly armor&quot; story broke, and this prick had the audacity to say that you go to war with the army you have, not the one you hope to have. For the billions of dollars being funneled into the war effort, you&apos;d think the soldiers would have the armor on their person and vehicles that they would need......but I don&apos;t want to get into a long political dissertation. All I know is that payback is a bitch, and with the majority party now in the minority, I look forward to seeing some radical shit coming down the pipe.
I&apos;ve got a 6 or 7 hour drive in front of me tomorrow, so I&apos;m gonna keep this brief and catch some sleep. But before I go, I want to mention something. I notice that there is a trend that&apos;s been going on for some years, and it started in e-mail and spread to websites like &quot;myspace&quot; and the like....it&apos;s the personal information quiz. I don&apos;t know who writes these things, but they are more often trite than not and while I want to answer them, I can&apos;t bring myself to answer questions like &quot;what&apos;s your favorite color?&quot; and &quot;what is the last thing you ate?&quot; If you really want to know, my favorite colors are the Buffalo Bills team colors, Scarlet Red, Royal White and Navy Blue, and the last thing I ate was some Burger King chicken nuggets (the only food I could find this late at night, Steve).
So I thought, why not go ahead and answer a quiz, but the questions would be provided by folks who read my blog. So I submit to you, my faithful readers....what do you want to know? I&apos;ll assemble the first 20 questions and answer them, and then pass the quiz along into the ether, where people will answer for themselves or delete at their discretion. So when you write a question, don&apos;t direct it at me, but at anyone who would want to answer such a question.
That&apos;s it. Nappy nap time.

 Where Is The Love (Black Eyed Peas) 
Posted on 11/07/2006 at 02:25 AM
Well, good morning. It&apos;s election day, so don&apos;t forget to go out there and fire someone (or hire someone, for that matter).
I&apos;m home after the two-week jaunt in Wisconsin. I worked this week with Chicago&apos;s Kevin Naughton, a comic I have been in the trenches with before. We had decent shows all week at the State Street Comedy Club in Madison, one of the coolest places to play. Gus Pappas and his wife Mary are the genial proprietors, and they definitely make you feel welcome in their club. For God&apos;s sake, they pay you in an envelope with a thank-you card....how cool is that? Mary turned me on to Keith Olbermann, who I&apos;ve been watching on YouTube. It&apos;s not a hard sell because he&apos;s beating that left-wing drum, but I like hearing it and I can&apos;t get enough, either. He had one commentary that lasted about ten minutes that said either President Bush was lying or too stupid to know the truth. Well, that may be pandering to the liberal base, but I can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t enjoy listening to it. I have to switch off from CNN now and again and catch some MSNBC, now that I know what sort of flag they&apos;re flying.
I spent the weekend in the Monona Lake Suite at the Madison Concourse Hotel. It&apos;s a beautiful property, really, and just a short, two-block walk from the club. I&apos;ve been to this club five times, and only once was the hotel sold out, and they had to move us to another place. I think Gus has a deal with the owner of the hotel, because we had strange accomodations this week.
Instead of a regular guest room (which I guess were all sold out), Kevin and I were put in what is called &quot;parlor suites.&quot; Basically, these are rooms that are set up for meetings and don&apos;t include the regular guest room amenities. For example, my room was basically double the size of a normal room, but there was no bed, so they rolled in a rollaway bed. I had the normal TV/entertainment center with bureau drawers, a phone, iron and ironing board, but I also had a long meeting-room table and four chairs, also a small sofa (on wheels). There was a normal bathroom, but I also had a bar area with another sink, and a small refrigerator.
There was a lot of extra room, so I spent the first hour moving furniture, condensing all of the items into a space about a quarter of the entire room. This made things cozy and accessible, and I made sure I was going to be comfortable for the three days so I could do my job. I set up the ironing board out in &quot;no-man&apos;s-land&quot; so it wouldn&apos;t be in my way, and ironed the shirts I would need for the weekend, hanging them on the backs of three of the four aforementioned chairs.
The hotel had wireless internet, so I set up my laptop on the big meeting room table, which I placed adjacent to the TV/entertainment center. My bed was tucked in the corner, facing the TV, and I moved an end table next to my bed for the lamp, clock/radio and still had plenty of space for my CPAP machine (a piece of equipment that humidifies and blows air through my nose while I sleep to counter my sleep apnea). I rolled the couch up to the table and sat on that while I worked at the computer, because it was much softer than the chairs. Also, I had room on the sofa next to me for my briefcase, so from a convenience standpoint, it was optimal.
Thursday night was open mic night, and there were three of them, plus our mc. They were very clique-ey and unwatchable, spitting out half-baked &quot;shock&quot; humor and then chastising the audience for not &quot;getting&quot; them. It was really an obnoxious display. I went up with my old school &quot;setup-punchline&quot; jokes and slaughtered, and none of the new kids talked to me afterwards. I guess it must hurt to be 25 and hip, and some 40-year old bastard comes out of nowhere and shows you how it&apos;s done. I hate to pat myself on the back, but the pretentiousness of some of the youth in this business is really starting to get to me. When I was starting out, we paid our respects to the older comics who had figured out the game, and we learned from them. These kids seem to think they know it all, and I never thought I would be talking like this, but I guess old people prattle on for a reason....it&apos;s a never-ending cycle that keeps getting played out over and over.
Friday night&apos;s shows were soft, but Saturday was excellent. The University of Wisconsin won their big football game against Penn State, and I literally walked against the crowd earlier in the day as they headed down State Street from the stadium towards the downtown where my hotel was, and I was walking up State Street looking for lunch. I was the only person out there not wearing the red &apos;n&apos; white of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, beneath my black hooded sweatshirt, I was actually wearing Tennessee orange. It was a faux pas easily remedied by not taking the sweatshirt off.
For a little while, I thought about driving home overnight, if for no other reason to get through Chicago in the night when traffic was light. I nixed that idea in favor of six or seven hours of sleep (closer to six, to be honest), and headed out in the morning. Chicago wasn&apos;t bad, but Indiana was very slow going....lots of trucks blocking both lanes (get right, asshole!) and construction cutdowns to one lane changed my estimated time of arrival from 8 o&apos;clock in the evening to my eventual return sometime after 11 P.M. Still, it was great to get home after two weeks on the road, and today I spent practically the whole day watching Harmony while Pam went out running errands. My little daughter gave me the biggest hug I ever got, and it hurt a little bit (o.k., a lot) to realize all at once and in a very physical, tangible way what I deny myself because of my vocation and the pursuit of it. At one point, I took out the colored pencils and we colored together in one of her coloring books, and it didn&apos;t matter that the sky had a big orange splotch in it even though I was trying to show her how to color it blue, she just appreciated that I was there with her, spending time with her. Children spell &quot;love&quot; T-I-M-E, and I musn&apos;t forget that.
Wives spell love a bunch of different ways, and when I got home, Pamela had showed off the special things she got me at Tops, namely products with the Buffalo Bills logo on it....they were simple things, chunky-style soup, cornflakes and peanuts, but she knows how much I cherish the Bills, and got them to make me happy. I had a big bowl of the cornflakes and enjoyed the soup for lunch. It&apos;s a little thing, but much appreciated.
And while I&apos;m on the Buffalo Bills, on Saturday night, a comedian friend of mine named Nathan Craig (I worked with him in Cleveland back in September) stopped in.....Madison being his home town (he basically lives in Chicago now). We did the pal-around thing, and one of our last conversations regarded his beloved Green Bay Packers and how they were going to beat Buffalo this weekend, and I told him that Brett Favre sucked so bad, his football card was worth more than he was. I listened to as much radio as I could on the drive home Sunday, and when I couldn&apos;t get a radio station in, I called my brother Christopher in Syracuse and made him describe the play-by-play to me over the phone until it was certain that Buffalo had won.
I have to go now...I&apos;m really tired and I have to send Nate an e-mail telling him that the Packers suck.

 Whatever (Godsmack) 
Posted on 11/02/2006 at 02:51 AM
Well, I&apos;m in Iowa. Calling home and saying that I&apos;m in Iowa is just a little less embarassing than calling home and saying I&apos;m in prison. And at the very least, no one has ever had to be bailed out of Iowa. Except Howard Dean....boy, that was a mess.
Saturday night, I did my first ever three-show evening. I had to look it up in my past road books, and apparently, it&apos;s never happened before. I feel like a rookie, and I&apos;m fast approaching 19 years of doing standup comedy. And boy, doesn&apos;t that feel weird.
The shows were good, if not very well-attended....we probably could have gotten away with two shows, but the money was better, so I wasn&apos;t complaining. I got back to the room and didn&apos;t realize how tired I actually was, I was out like a light. I got some good rest, which was appropriate, because I had a big couple of days &quot;off,&quot; and needed to prepare for them.
I had scheduled an audition on Monday for the NBC TV show &quot;America&apos;s Got Talent.&quot; I found out about the audition in Chicago through my friends at the Comedy Zone, who forwarded the press release to all of the comics on their roster. I decided that because I was in Milwaukee, and staying at the club&apos;s comedy condo (a two-bedroom apartment where they store the comedians while we&apos;re in town), I might make good use of one of my days off by going down and throwing my hat into the ring.
On Sunday, I paid my cellular bill (had to drive all over Milwaukee to find a Cingular Wireless store that accepted cash payments) and just around the corner, as good luck would have, there was a public library branch that was open on Sunday! I went in, used the internet to print out directions to the Chicago Navy Pier, which was much farther than I would have budgeted time for. It was definitely a lucky happenstance that I wasn&apos;t able to pay my bill on Saturday, because I most likely would not have tried to print directions to Chicago, figuring it to be a &quot;straight shot&quot; and trusting myself to get there on my own instincts.
I was going to sit in the apartment on Sunday and go over my act with a fine-toothed comb, as I had to prepare two 90-second sets to perform for the casting people. I decided I was better off not to dwell on it, and went to go see the new Robin Williams movie. I highly recommend it, if you&apos;re interested in taking a nap in a movie theater. The film has a great premise, but it does less-than-nimble handsprings around itself, trying to become something, and merely tangling up the cord of the kitchen telephone. I got home in the early evening, less than inspired, and popped one of my DVD&apos;s into the player to see if there were any jokes that I&apos;m not doing anymore that I should be doing. I wound up writing down a dozen or so that I thought were good and appropriate, leaving out anything racial, sexual or controversial. Also, anything having to do with pooping or gas also was deleted. For some reason, they love that material in the club, but get the same people home in front of the TV, and all of a sudden they&apos;re picky.
I got up good &apos;n&apos; early, shaved, showered, dressed, and headed to Chicago. I got there relatively on time despite the heavy traffic, and instead of arriving an hour before my 1:30 audition, I got there 40 minutes early. A stop to the bathroom ate up 20 minutes, and I cursed McDonald&apos;s and their dollar menu. I had 20 minutes to go, and the information desk informed me that the auditions were at the other end of the Navy Pier, which is a big tourist trap (on an actual pier) with a food court, gift shops, a stained glass museum, and large banquet halls. I beat feat for the end of the pier, as fast as my dress-shoe shod feet would allow, and got there with exactly two minutes to spare. Come to find out, they had me down for 1:45, but it didn&apos;t matter, because nobody saw me until 2:30 anyway.
The audition went pretty well, as well as could be expected, doing a minute and a half of comedy in front of five people sitting at a table with no alcohol in front of them, and knowing that they sat through a whole day of auditions yesterday, and were going into the second half of a busy day when I arrived. They were friendly, but didn&apos;t inspire any real hope in me....the actual selection process doesn&apos;t begin until they go to Los Angeles and one other city, New Orleans, I think, and then they alert the folks they&apos;re interested in by phone. My phone might never ring, but if I stayed in the apartment in Milwaukee, it definitely never would have rung.
The guy that went in before me was a variety act, and I have to comment on this. He was a tall, like Tim Robbins tall, guy, wearing a suit. When he came out, some fifteen minutes later, he was naked except for his shoes and socks, and a pair of pink and white striped boxer shorts. He also had a huge afro wig that was pulled down so far it obscured his vision, and he had his clothes in his arms, and was asking where the bathroom was. I pointed him to the men&apos;s room across the way, and he went ass over teakettle into an easel with a sign with all the NBC audition rules. I figured that this guy is definitely getting on to the program, but for all the wrong reasons. They&apos;re gonna make fun of him, and he&apos;s got no shot at the cash prize, which I did not know was a million dollars until my wife looked it up online. I hung out with a pair of magicians, Dean and Denise, and we chatted to make the time go faster. They went in just before I did, and came out pretty quick. While they were in there, an older guy with a bullwhip and his wife came up, the next act after me to try out. They had roses, which I presume they would be using the bullwhip to whip out of each other&apos;s teeth, and I thought that no matter how clever I think I am, if I&apos;m putting someone on TV, it&apos;s the old guy with the whip.
The drive home to Milwaukee from Chicago was a monster, and the next day, Halloween, it was off to Lacrosse, Wisconsin. Now, having comedy on the same night as Halloween may seem like a great marketing plan, but it really isn&apos;t. There were seven people at our show, and while they were great and fun to work in front of, it felt like the audition in Chicago the day before. If it wasn&apos;t for the money, there&apos;d be no reason for me to even have been there, having played Lacrosse just a month and a half before (at a different room for a different booker). Today was Dubuque, Iowa, at the 3100 club, which is a pale replacement for the old Brass Ring lounge that used to put 300 people in the club each night. Our crowd tonight was about 50, and not bad until folks decided that they could chime in with their two cents like it was a town meeting. Again, if it wasn&apos;t for the money, I wouldn&apos;t even come.
The rest of the week, it&apos;s Madison, Wisconsin, one of the smartest (and most liberal) towns in the United States, and the lodging is at the five-star Concourse Hotel, which just happens to be walking distance from the State Street Comedy Club. This is one of the clubs that I look forward all year to playing, I always do well and have a really good time. Hopefully, tomorrow I&apos;ll find a comic book shop (I know they have one, just don&apos;t remember how to get there) and have some gyros at this Greek place down college row. State Street, where the club is located, follows all the way to the University of Wisconsin at Madison (Go Badgers) and features a long string of shops that are very eclectic and interesting. There&apos;s also the obligatory Starbucks and chain-style fast food (Taco Bell, Burger King) and a great pizza place that stays open quite late.
It&apos;s been a fun and interesting tour this last couple of weeks, but I&apos;m reaching saturation and can&apos;t wait to get home again. I don&apos;t know how the &quot;big name&quot; guys do it, touring for months on end; actually, I do know, it&apos;s called drugs and alcohol and meaningless groupie sex. I guess I really need to make sure that I&apos;m home at least once a week, my body can&apos;t handle any of those three things. I turn 40 years old on the 15th, and it&apos;s a milestone that I&apos;m not going to be able to ignore, at least because the people around me probably won&apos;t let me. But inside, I definitely know what&apos;s going on....I&apos;ve looked forward to 40 as the perfect synergy between wisdom and physical stamina, figuring that as I&apos;ve collected knowledge, I would still have (at this point) the energy to use that knowledge. There are some days I&apos;m not so sure, but as my health gets better and I continue to do the important things, watching my diet, excercising and monitoring my blood sugar, I&apos;m sure my outlook will change.
OK, that&apos;s it. I&apos;ll check in again before the end of the week, I&apos;m sure, and if I don&apos;t, make sure you vote this Tuesday.

 Halloween (King Diamond) 
Posted on 10/28/2006 at 03:31 PM
Wow...tonight, I&apos;m doing three shows....I can&apos;t remember the last time I did that (did Iever do three shows in one night? I&apos;m gonna have to look at my old road journals).
I&apos;m working at the famous Giggles Comedy Pub in Germantown (Milwaukee), Wisconsin. I got in Thursday afternoon to find no one at the club to give me keys to get into the condo where the comics stay, had to call the owner&apos;s cell phone and wait around for an hour. I made the mistake of going to the old apartment where the comics used to stay, to find a locked door and a barking dog...they moved the accomodations to another complex, and somebody has rented out the old place.
Thursday was kind of stiff, a little older crowd and an early start. It was nice getting everything done by 9:30, but then I stayed up so late because I wasn&apos;t tired, I thought I&apos;d never get to sleep.
Last night, we did two shows and they were excellent, but the house manager was flashing me the light at 15 minutes....I looked at my watch and couldn&apos;t believe it, I thought I offended somebody or something....I asked them why they were flashing me so soon, on stage, in the middle of my show, and then explained to the crowd what &quot;the light&quot; meant, and that they time the shows to make sure everything runs smoothly. It didn&apos;t affect my overall performance, it actually might have added to it a little bit.
In honor of the Halloween holiday this weekend, the servers are wearing cute little Halloween costumes. They&apos;re very tasteful and non-intrusive, just things like a set of clip-on tiger ears, and a tiger tail, very minimalist. I think that&apos;s a lot better than having servers dolled up in full costumes, plus who wants to give their cocktail order to a girl dressed up as a train-hopping hobo? Not me, I can tell you that.
Yesterday, Chris Johnson (our good and honorable headliner) and I went to lunch and somewhere along the line, found out that we both had a penchant for garage sales. Incredibly, in Wisconsin in 50 degree weather, we found several (and on a Friday afternoon....it was amazing). I scored big in the used book department, picking up piles of Little Golden Books and Dr. Suess books for Harmony, and finished my score with a trip to the Menominee Falls library, where the used books go out at 6 for a buck. I bought two dollars&apos; worth, and got some interesting reading titles, but most of them are going to be resold on the internet. A quick browsing of them found some of the titles to be worth five dollars or more each....I&apos;m not getting rich, but it&apos;s a fun hobby to search out cheap used books and resell them at a profit. Plus, it keeps me busy during the day...you can only watch so much World Series of Poker on TV before your brain starts turning to mush.
Yesterday was also a very good day for comedy business, I picked up four weeks of work from Funny Business Agency (one week of headlining work thrown in), and one of the weeks was in Battle Creek the week I&apos;m performing at Gary Field&apos;s for a cancer benefit. I was worried I wouldn&apos;t find any work that week, and I managed to get a week at the very club I&apos;m performing in....that means no extra driving, and I can&apos;t tell you how happy I am about that!
I have a few hours to prepare for my three-show evening, so I&apos;m going to call it quits here and go pay my cell phone bill and try to rest up. Have a happy Halloween, and don&apos;t eat too much candy!

 One More (Cheap Trick) 
Posted on 10/25/2006 at 04:56 PM
I&apos;m in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, getting ready for the big show at Fratello&apos;s Restaurant tonight, on the shores of Lake Winnebago, just a stone&apos;s throw from legendary Lambeau Field and home of the Green Bay Packers.
I finished up last weekend with Michael Winslow of &quot;Police Academy&quot; fame, doing two shows....it was a flip-flop of the night before; first show was good, second show crowd was listless and unresponsive. I did my time and got the hell out of there, Michael was doing an hour and fifteen minutes every show! I cut my time to seven minutes and feature act Sal Demilio was doing about fifteen to twenty, if that. We had a good time, and we talked at length about the club he&apos;s running in Wyandotte, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. I managed to get a booking out of him, and I&apos;m going in March, at which time I will also do a little consulting, offering what club advice I can give from my vast experience running such a place. I&apos;m looking forward to it, Sal&apos;s good people, and this is the perfect remedy for my falling out with Billy over at Chaplain&apos;s, the club that wouldn&apos;t let me sell my CD&apos;s after the show this past spring. I&apos;d rather work for people that are nice and amenable than a guy with the demeanor of strip club owner going through a tax audit with a porcupine halfway up his ass. It was fortunate that I got canceled in Harrisburg this past weekend, that I could take the mc work in Rochester and reconnect with Sal and get this opportunity.
Pam and I chilled out this weekend, and I started work on buttoning down the house so my two week tour of Wisconsin wouldn&apos;t weigh too heavily on her. We went shopping (much easier with both of us, someone can watch the baby while the other juggles all the coupons) and when we got home, I knotted things up, did some basic housecleaning and got Pam to a clean slate. I think I do all this out of guilt that I&apos;m leaving her with the baby while I&apos;m out eating in restaurants, watching movies, sleeping in big, luxurious hotel beds and enjoying the low-pressure life of complete freedom.
I got about three hours of sleep before I had to hit the road for Rockford, Illinois. I stayed up getting my luggage packed, printing out driving directions and checking hotel reservations. I went to bed at 2:30, fell asleep at 3:30, and woke up at 6:30. Thankfully, all I had to do was shower and dress and load luggage into the car at that point. I used to always forget one thing when I packed, and it was always different. Usually it was never a disaster, but one time I did forget to pack a pair of slacks, and did my show in a jacket and jeans. That&apos;s a good look for Jeff Foxworthy, but not me.
I had to mind my p&apos;s and q&apos;s to the Pennsylvania border because my New York State inspection sticker on my car was out of date. Once I got out of New York, I didn&apos;t care, because other states don&apos;t have the jurisdiction to ticket me for such an offense. I have a couple of repair issues that I have to attend to before I get the inspection, and I couldn&apos;t afford them due to three weeks of unemployment and underemployment, so I basically became an official member of the criminal underground. Poverty leads to crime, my Sociology major friends, it&apos;s not an inborn trait. Anyway, I have one tire that&apos;s going bald, and I found out how important something like that is, when I was leaving a gas station just outside of Cleveland and felt the back of the car completing a turn that I hadn&apos;t made yet....a little scary, for sure! I&apos;ll try to get repairs done here in Wisconsin as I make the money, and get a new sticker when I get home.
I made it to Rockford about an hour before showtime, just enough time to shower up and make it to the club. I&apos;m working with Chris &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Johnson, a Rockford native, and LT&apos;s was packed, with quite a few people coming to see him. I had a strong set and sold a good bunch of CD&apos;s after the show, and for a few minutes, I was disoriented because I forgot what it was like to have money. Chris killed, and then I left him with his family who came out to the show, and I headed back to the hotel to get some rest.
Tonight&apos;s a late starter, 9 PM Central time, so I&apos;ve got about 5 hours to kill. I have a big audition on Monday, and I&apos;ll write more about that later, but it&apos;s going to require a little preparation on my part. Maybe I&apos;ll start picking apart my act and figure out what material I&apos;m going to showcase....or maybe I&apos;ll take a nap. I&apos;m still pretty tired from the big drive, and I&apos;ve got five days to prepare.
And oh, that big fluffy bed looks sooooooo inviting....

 Say What Ya Want (Texas featuring Wu Tang Clan) 
Posted on 10/21/2006 at 04:31 PM
I opened for Wu Tang Clan! Holla!
Actually, I opened for Michael Winslow, AKA Officer Larvelle Jones from the &quot;Police Academy&quot; movies, for two shows last night at the Comix Cafe, my home (sigh) club in Rochester, NY. I&apos;ve got two more shows tonight, and I&apos;m happy for the work after being unceremoniously canceled at the Harrisburg, PA Comedy Zone due to a double-booking I had no control over.
Well, where Wu Tang Clan comes in, Michael&apos;s road manager/soundman is a gentleman who introduced himself as &quot;Chi&quot; from Wu Tang Clan, although I know he is not one of the original 9, I figured he is a new guy working with the group. Anyway, I&apos;ve seen Michael Winslow many times, and he has re-upped his stage show to include multi-media (read: he flashes films on the back wall while he does his stuff). He still does his fabled Jimi Hendrix bit &quot;Night of the Jimi&apos;s&quot; which still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, and I&apos;ve seen him 30 times or more.
The feature act, Sal DeMilio, is a cool guy from Detroit that I worked with before in Jackson, Michigan at a bowling alley on a Sunday night. You don&apos;t forget a guy when you&apos;ve been through the trenches with him like that. We had a great time talking comedy business and such, and I&apos;m looking forward to more chatting around tonight. Michael has an inordinately long show, so we&apos;ll have plenty of time to talk in the bar, don&apos;t you worry about that.
Wednesday I headed down to Blacksburg, Virginia, and worked at Attitude&apos;s Lounge in the Holiday Inn, one of my favorite one-nighter&apos;s to play, and I was working with Mike Siscoe, a guy I only knew from www.roadcomics.com and the spirited discussion that he brings to the site. We had a good crowd and it was a good show overall, hosted by Anthony Quinn, the house mc at Attitude&apos;s, and we were treated to a guest set by a young lady named Laura Prangley, who was funny and not hard to look at, by any means. I am still suffering from bronchitis, but I managed through my half hour without losing wind.
It was 600 miles down there, almost to the knuckle, and a little shorter getting back home, which always surprises me...how can it be 604 miles down, and when I arrive home expecting my odometer to say 1208, and it says 1198? That&apos;s just confusing, unless my tires weren&apos;t actually touching the ground for six miles or something. The highlight of my trip was finding gas in Virginia (I-81, exit 128) for $1.99 a gallon, and Siscoe told me he saw it in West Virginia for less than that! That&apos;s a big deal for a New York State boy who&apos;s used to paying $2.39 a gallon nowadays.
Anyway, I didn&apos;t sell any product (college kids have NOOO money these days!) and wound up losing about $20 for doing the gig and not canceling, but I don&apos;t like canceling on short notice, and I already canceled the date last winter, and I didn&apos;t want it to happen again, thereby eroding the booker&apos;s confidence in me. I&apos;m happy to be picking up the work this weekend, courtesy of my buddy Ray Salah who was originally scheduled, but graciously stepped aside because he knows I&apos;ve got a wife and child to feed...Ray&apos;s my best friend for the last 18 years, and there&apos;s not many out there like him.
I leave Tuesday for Wisconsin, and hopefully the return of regular income as the last couple of months have left our household dangerously in arrears. I also have an audition for &quot;America&apos;s Got Talent&quot; in Chicago on one of my days off, so hopefully I&apos;ll pass and you&apos;ll get to see Yours Truly on NBC during primetime someday. It worked out perfectly that the Chicago auditions are happening while I&apos;m in Milwaukee, which is a piddling hour drive away....it&apos;s almost like fate, only with a toll booth every four miles. I have to prepare 90 seconds of comedy for my audition, and I figure my best bet is to just go raw dog political on their ass, because I&apos;m just another white guy and I feel I need to stand out. I&apos;ve got some stuff that&apos;s been killing lately, and I think that&apos;s my big finish, I just have to decide what to do to open up. I&apos;ve never done a 90 second set, but that&apos;s a lot of time, if you think about it.
O.K., it&apos;s off to the mall to find a child-proof lock for our refrigerator, as little Harmony has learned how to open it and take stuff out and put it on the floor, looking for chocolate cookies and ranch dressing and other potables that she enjoys.
Have a great weekend, talk to ya soon.

 Trick Or Treat (Fastway) 
Posted on 10/16/2006 at 09:50 PM
Well, it&apos;s official....I saw my nutritionist today, and for the first time in over 15 years, I am under 300 pounds. I weighed in today at 295 and a quarter, and I gotta tell you, it feels great.
I&apos;ve been watching my sugars and starches, and getting light exercise in whenever possible, and although the results are coming slowly, they&apos;re coming. I was 329 lbs. only six months ago, so at the current rate, I&apos;ll be at my recommended weight of 190 pounds in no time.
I think one of the components of my weight loss has been the unemployment that&apos;s been plagueing me these last couple of weeks, although last week didn&apos;t turn out half bad. Instead of hosting at the Comix Cafe on Thursday and Sunday, I featured, and Sunday night I sold a good amount of product. Then on Friday, I picked up a gig from Danny Liberto (mentioned in the first previous blog) as his headliner, one Danny Pordum from Buffalo, New York, was trapped in the Queen City due to the freak blizzard that hit. There was speculation going around (and I add, unproven speculation) that he was called upon by Jr&apos;s Last Laugh, the full-time comedy club in Erie, Pennsylvania, to fill in, and canceled Danny&apos;s one-nighter, using the snow as an excuse, but for whatever reason, I was happy to pick up the work. Danny hosted the room, and our feature act was Joe Cumbo, a student of mine from way back when I taught the fine art of standup comedy to starry-eyed dreamers. We had a leisurely ride to Oswego, New York, only about two hours away (if that), and got ready for the 9 P.M. show.
I considered the show to be decent, if under-attended. The crowd seemed to like what I was doing, although they got to be a little chatty, and I&apos;m still battling an upper respiratory illness, bronchitis or something, and I told them flat out that I would not be able to talk over them, even with the mic. I finished fine, and sold a couple of CD&apos;s to some army guys who were loud, but enjoyed the show. They even mentioned that even though our politics were different, they liked what I had to say. That felt good.
Wednesday, I have a one-nighter in Blacksburg, Virginia, a gig I picked up to go along with my Harrisburg, Pennsylvania weekend that is now not happening. I&apos;m probably going to do no better than break even on the gig, depending on the price of gas on the way down and back. Still, it wouldn&apos;t be very wise to cancel with such short notice, especially since the booking agent has been very good to me in terms of passing work my way on my request. Big ups to Chuck Johnson at Summit Comedy, Inc!
I got word today that the check I&apos;ve been waiting for should arrive tomorrow or the next day, and not a moment too soon; this time off has been whittling away at my reserves. Tomorrow is car inspection day, and I&apos;m bracing for a kick in the nuts in that respect, depending on what my faithful Toyota Corolla needs to be considered up to speed. Time will tell, I&apos;m sure.
I&apos;m picking up readers to this blog, which originates under AOL: Journals as Ralph Tetta&apos;s Comedy Roadtrip, and is cross-posted to MySpace blogs under www.myspace.com/rabidralph and at www.comedysoapbox.com. I&apos;m always flattered when I find out someone I know is a regular reader, I wish I was as good at cultivating actual real-life friendships as I am at attracting blog-audience. Either way, I&apos;m thankful for the attention.
Today&apos;s joke, came up with it in the car the other day with Pamela...
&quot;I love Halloween, everyone gets into the spirit of the holiday with their lawn displays. I saw one lawn with all sorts of homemade wooden crosses, I thought it was a graveyard, until I realized it was just a really bad curve in the road.&quot;
Hoping you get more treats than tricks...

 Seems Uncertain (311) 
Posted on 10/12/2006 at 02:44 AM
The worst part about being a standup comic, I&apos;ve come to realize, is the uncertainty of it all. It&apos;s uncertain whether you will get to your show or not, as any kind of weather, road construction, or automobile accident could stop you from getting to the gig, never mind car trouble. At least car trouble you have somewhat of a manner of control over, if you regularly maintain your vehicle, you should probably make it where you have to go.
It&apos;s uncertain that the gig will even happen; cancellations have been the flavor of the month for me, and it&apos;s being held over as a flavor for a second month despite my arguments to the contrary.
Finally, it&apos;s uncertain that you&apos;ll ever be paid for a gig, particularly if you are sent away with a check, or worse yet, the promise of a check.
I had two weeks of October blocked out to work at the new Comix Cafe room in Syracuse. Only problem was that the room isn&apos;t there. I said &quot;no&quot; to other solid work, because I was specially requested to make myself available. I made myself available, and wound up sitting on my ass last week.
This week, I actually had work fall from the sky in the form of a new room being run by the former manager of the Lake Ontario Playhouse in Geneva, New York, only to receive a call today that the club isn&apos;t opening until January because the hotel that it&apos;s in isn&apos;t ready to open. I also got victimized next week by Comedy Zone in the form of a double-booking of the headliner, which meant that the double-booked guy had the option to drop down to feature, which left me out in the cold with my fingerless gloves, singing over a burning trash can and hoping to pick up a token so I could unload ships in the morning.
Well, when a dog&apos;s hungry, it&apos;s up to his friends to throw him a bone, and my buddies definitely ponied up. Mike Glosek over at the Cafe&apos; threw me a gig tonight, a private party entertaining a businessman&apos;s bachelors club (a little less fun than it sounds) where I basically would do a joke and then listen to 30 guys yell epithets at each other. The biggest laugh I got was when I told the oldest guy in the room that I was going to rub my balls on his head, but that I had hairy balls and I didn&apos;t want the hairs to be lonely (he was balding) and I think he called me a cunt. They definitely wanted the abuse, but I wasn&apos;t completely into that. I did my time, grabbed the check and scrammed.
I headed immediately to the Comedy Company open mic at Slammer&apos;s Bar and Grill, hosted by Danny Liberto, and I signed up on the big list. When I arrived at the bar, the total number of comics in the room doubled. By the end of the show, there were five of us total, including longtime comedy pal Tim Thomas, Joe Cumbo, Danny Brown, a new kid from Buffalo, and a guy I met at the Comix Cafe last night (open mic canceled due to no crowd showing up). There was a $50 cash prize, which I won, and I think that it was no coincidence that Danny was familiar with my tale of woe, because to be honest, he could have thrown the prize to any one of us as the responses were all very similar...it&apos;s hard to rock a room that is straining to maintain double-digit attendance at any given time when people are getting up two-by-two to go outside and smoke. Anyway, Danny is a righteous guy and alright by me. We traded war stories before the show and I appreciated the opportunity to pick up the money, which may be the difference between me making it to my next gig or not.
So I played in front of white-collar and blue-collar in the same night, and wound up making the best money of the week. I scored an mc spot at the Cafe on Thursday and Sunday due to a scheduling change (a guy went over his time, stole material from numerous sources and got booted), so there&apos;s another 60 bucks into the coffers to play with. Next week, I&apos;m in the same predicament, and I had to ask my good friend Ray Salah to do me the favor and step aside from an mc week that I scheduled him for so I could make the money. He obliged, knowing full well that I have a wife and child who depend on me, but it was an ugly feeling all around. I don&apos;t like being canceled, and I don&apos;t like doing it to others, especially friends. It&apos;s good to have them, though, because they help you get through the hard times.
I guess this is what they would call a &quot;starving artist&quot; period, which is funny, because I have work the rest of the year, it&apos;s just these three weeks off in a row that are kicking my ass, and also despite the Comedy Zone canceling me next week, the owner of the agency called me, gave me three days as an add-on toa week in December, and then his partner called me the next day and gave me 15 weeks of work for 2007. Also, I&apos;m still waiting on a check for a gig that I performed two weeks ago, and it still hasn&apos;t come. I called the agency, and didn&apos;t get a live person, so it could be in the mail, or hasn&apos;t been sent yet, or I can go pound rock salt. I have no idea! It&apos;s either feast or famine, and I really wish things would even out and become somewhat manageable or predictable, but uncertainty is the name of the game.

 Meat Sandwich (Gwar) 
Posted on 10/04/2006 at 10:36 PM
It&apos;s another rainy night in Rochester, but so nice to be home. I rolled in at around 2:30 Monday morning, after 18 1/2 hours in the car.
Friday&apos;s show in St. Cloud, Minnesota, was absolutely excellent. The room was full, and except for a table up front that was having table conversations that were disturbing people around them, everything went fine. There was a guest spot kid who went up before me, and they let him do 15 minutes....only problem was he never did comedy before, so all of his material was absolutely untested. He got nothing out of the crowd, and I felt bad for him, because he was a nice guy, brought people with him, and resisted all of my attempts to tell him not to do standup....that&apos;s real committment.
Saturday was a different animal...same table, different trouble table. This one was four divorcees in their 40&apos;s, who felt they had to tag every joke with a comment, funny or not. One woman got mad and threw a piece of pizza at me. She was being a total crotch. The headliner, Dave Nickerson, gave them hell and then finally asked them if they shouldn&apos;t leave. &quot;If you&apos;re not having a good time, why are you staying? You&apos;re wrecking the show for everyone in here!&quot; It was ugly and unnecessary, and the room wasn&apos;t that full to begin with. It was kind of a punk way to end the tour, but you don&apos;t get to call your shots, you take them as they come.
Sunday morning got off to a bad start...I wound up driving around like a hummingbird trying to find route 94 that would send me east. When I finally found it, even though I kept crossing bridges that took me over the expressway, I couldn&apos;t find the on-ramp, and that&apos;s because the on-ramp was fed from an access road, and you had to drive almost a mile perpendicular to the highway to get to it, and then drive back. It was plenty weird.
The next thing I had to deal with was the rising sun shining right into my eyes. I wear prescription glasses, and can never find clip-on sunglasses, so I was pretty blind until noon. I was sweating it out as I headed toward Chicago because I knew they were playing at home and didn&apos;t want to get harried by stadium traffic, but come to find out they weren&apos;t playing until late, and I wasn&apos;t going anywhere near the stadium. Thank God for small favors.
Speaking of acts of God, as I came out of Madison, Wisconsin and south through the towns of Janesville and Beloit, I stopped for gas, only to notice that the I-94 was backing up something terrible. I was happy not to be caught in that traffic, and the clerk at the gas station let me know that they were repairing a bridge on 94 that cut the traffic down to one lane, and that I needed to take a detour (not a posted detour, by the way) and it still took me 45 minutes to an hour, but at least I kept moving.
I survived the long drive due to a couple of tapes I picked up at a truckstop...Jimmy Buffet Live, and George Carlin Live. The Carlin tape was actually the show he was doing while I toured with him as an assistant to the Road Manager back in 1995-1997. It was neat to hear how the material evolved from this early taping, to what it eventually became. Also, I didn&apos;t realize what a parrothead I had the capacity to become...I played that tape over &apos;n&apos; over again, I must have every little bit of &quot;between song patter&quot; memorized. I must remember next time to pack some music a little more thoroughly than I did on this tour (which means I didn&apos;t bring any).
When I drive, I usually pass a whole lot of cars and trucks, it&apos;s just the way I do it. I was pretty cautious though, what with it being the beginning of the month (quotas for speeding tickets) and I wasn&apos;t interested in buying some little town&apos;s new stop sign. I passed a couple of livestock trucks transporting pigs, and I could see their little snouts and tails sticking out of the vents in the side of the truck. I went quickly from being entertained at their little piggy antics to being consumed by horror as I saw what I assume to be their final destination...a Hormel meat packing plant. I didn&apos;t see the plant right away, but there were signs for the Spam museum, and I was interested to see what that looked like...when I looked off the exit, there was the plant, and my heart got a little heavy.
Now, I know where meat comes from, I&apos;m not delusional. And I&apos;m a meat-eater, even though my wife is a moral vegetarian. But I&apos;m not going to lie to you and tell you that seeing a couple of trucks of animals that were surely being taken to slaughter didn&apos;t affect me in a bad way. I was choked up and unhappy for several miles. I think that the physical process of driving for such a long time (and with little sleep, I might add) takes it&apos;s toll on me and my ability to control my emotions. I get all weepy over nothing after I&apos;ve been in the car for 9 hours or more, and it&apos;s getting worse in my old age.
Now, just to prove to you that I&apos;m not a big crybaby sissy, I&apos;ll tell you another story. Later that evening, I was on line at Burger King at an Ohio rest stop (yeah, I got the Whopper combo). I was third in line at the only register open, manned by a largely uninterested young man who&apos;s demeanor and speech made me think &quot;community theater&quot; right away.
So I&apos;m in line, and what looks like an army of Gypsies, or Eastern Europeans of some designation, come descending on the rest stop, and suddenly, there&apos;s 20 people or more in line. A young man, looking all of maybe 10 years old, but visibly brandishing his own money, asks the old man in front of me if he can get behind him. The old man shrugs, and the kid takes his place in line IN FRONT OF ME.
Now, that&apos;s not the way cuts work. I&apos;m not saying that Gypsies or Romanians or whatever these people were don&apos;t play by the rules, but clearly, this young man never got the rules. So the old man steps up, places his order, and he needs some change, so he asks the kid for it. Well, they&apos;re together, I guess, it&apos;s his grandfather or somebody from on the same bus. And that&apos;s what Community Theater thought, too, because after the old man paid, he looked at me and said &quot;Can I take your order?&quot;
Now, I&apos;m plenty road weary at this point, been in the car for about 12 hours and still have around six to go. I put my order in, and then the kid chastises me and says, &quot;Hey, I was next!&quot;
Now, in my head, I&apos;m thinking &quot;What brass balls! You little fuck, how dare you!&quot; But I&apos;m not going to say anything, because he&apos;s a child, an infant. Besides, my order&apos;s in, I&apos;ve paid, what the hell is he gonna do?
&quot;Sorry, my friend, I thought you two were together, I didn&apos;t mean to cut in front of you&quot; and I say it good &apos;n&apos; specific so he gets my meaning. Now, I&apos;m not proud or anything, but the kid backs off and says &quot;O.K., as long as you didn&apos;t do it on purpose.&quot; And I&apos;m thinking, this is a kid who&apos;s either going to become an attorney or a politician, he doesn&apos;t give a crap what anyone thinks,he&apos;s gonna barge into a situation and take what he wants and piss on anyone who doesn&apos;t like it. And that&apos;s if he doesn&apos;t go back to the old country on vacation and step on a landmine and get his skin blown off.
And I think that&apos;s sad. But at least I got him before he could get me. I never enjoyed a Whopper sandwich so much in my life.

 I&apos;ve Been Everywhere (Johnny Cash) 
Posted on 09/29/2006 at 01:53 AM
So, where were we? Oh yes, I&apos;m 1,000 miles from home, and working my 10th show of a 12-show, 17-day tour. It&apos;s an understatement to say that I&apos;m looking forward to heading home.
I was smart to get a hotel room for the two days off, Sunday and Monday. Monday, I was able to get laundry done, as well as secure an oil change for my beloved Toyota Corolla (315,000 miles and still running like a champ). Plus, I got to rest and relax a little....I could&apos;ve driven the extra 400 miles and copped a free room in Dickinson, North Dakota, but after the long drive on Sunday, I needed a day to just even out and get some rest. Thankfully, I have a contact at the AmericInn in Fargo who got me a good rate at the hotel...I hate dipping into my pocket on days off, but it was necessary.
Tuesday in Dickinson, ND was a treat, like it always is. I swear, for the aggravation, I still have fun there. The crowd is very blue-collar, and they just don&apos;t have that &quot;sit down, shup and listen&quot; thing figured out yet. It&apos;s like a pep rally, with audience response after every joke, and sometimes every setup. Sometimes I feel like a Baptist minister, and they&apos;re all saying &quot;Amen, preacher! Praise the Lord!&quot; but with six beers in them, and they aren&apos;t saying &quot;Amen,&quot; they&apos;re saying &quot;Hey, man!&quot; I still go...it&apos;s the only gig that I play that&apos;s in the Mountain Time Zone, and I feel like a time traveller when I go there, like somehow I&apos;m going into the past.....one minute it&apos;s 2 o&apos;clock, and then a few seconds later, it&apos;s 1 o&apos;clock.....I&apos;m from the future!
Wednesday was Watertown, South Dakota. The gig was at &quot;The Boiler Room,&quot; a bar in the basement of the Best Western Conference Center. It was a six-hour drive through absolute nothing to get there, and then the itinerary said the show was at 7:30 P.M, when in fact it was actually 9 P.M. I sat around for 90 minutes in my show clothes, trying not to sweat up my freshly ironed shirt and playing poker for points online to kill the time. The show itself was o.k., but nothing to write home about. My first time in South Dakota earlier this year was much more favorable, but the headliner, Dave Nickerson from Phoenix, Arizona, fared about the same, so I didn&apos;t feel so bad. Still, it&apos;s unsettling when you&apos;re used to getting a certain feedback from a joke, either a big laugh or sometimes an applause break, and you get a &quot;B&quot; laugh.
I killed some time today during my six-hour drive by rocking the phones to line up some work in January. I scored two weeks of work, one in San Antonio, Texas, and one in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. If you wanna work in this business, you have to get on the phones. And I don&apos;t recommend trying to do it in South Dakota.....my cell signal was coming in and out like a Canadian radio station.
Tonight, it&apos;s the Starlight Lounge in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. I had a really good show, even though the cordless mic crapped the bed on me twice.....you gotta check the batteries, ladies! I did a good portion of the show accapella, which was easy for me...I grew up in an Italian family, so you had to yell and scream if you wanted to be heard. I used it to my advantage, ad-libbing on the technical difficulties and the crowd seemed to like it. After the show, I seemed to have a lot of good feedback from military personnel, who enjoyed some of my military-themed material. Like most comedians, I appreciate the validation....it makes me think I&apos;m moving in the right direction.
Tomorrow, it&apos;s off to Rum Runners in St. Cloud, Minnesota, for two shows in two days, and then the big drive back home. I&apos;m more than a little excited about seeing my family again, and even though I&apos;ve got a lot of work to do to winterize the old homestead, I&apos;m looking forward to it. The thought of firing up the furnace, getting a nice pot of homemade garlic vegetable soup going on the stove, and playing &quot;gonna getcha&quot; with Harmony are making me absolutely giddy, along with the idea of laying down to sleep with my pretty wife by my side, not having to lay down alone, hugging a pillow and worrying about the long drive the next day. I&apos;m home for about two weeks, except for helping out the new Comix Cafe in Syracuse the next two weekends, and those are both drive-out, drive-back propositions.
It&apos;s going to be nice to be back home, and with the holidays right around the corner, I&apos;m in the right frame of mind to over-romanticize my homecoming. But you know, it&apos;s better that way.

 The Bug (Dire Straits) 
Posted on 09/24/2006 at 01:56 AM
Some days you&apos;re the windshield, some days you&apos;re the bug.
Thursday night&apos;s gig in Spicer, Minnesota was definitely one that I would like to forget. Everything that could possibly be wrong with the place was wrong, except for the two nice girls running the room....I could find no fault with Gretchen and Leah, they did everything possible to make myself and headliner Wes Zyharuk comfortable short of extracting and disposing of our seminal fluids.
I knew when I checked in that this was going to be a prototypical &quot;hell gig.&quot; For starters, the town had a very small population and was in the middle of nowhere. For you film buffs, that&apos;s pretty much the way &quot;Children of the Corn&quot; got started. Not good for a traveling standup comic. Secondly, the room was very small, a barroom at best with a seating capacity of about 40, and no discernible stage. Comedy is a pretty fragile art form, you really can&apos;t just throw it up anywhere like a Woodstock poster and expect it to automatically tie the room together. You need subtle things like sight lines, service aisles, stage lights, and other such nonsense.
Thirdly, our &quot;mc&quot; was a drunk kid who washed dishes there, had been drinking since he was 19, and was only there to be a buffer between nothing and the show, meaning me.
After a finely butchered introduction (I&apos;m not Rob, and I&apos;m not from New York City), I took the stage with all the authority of a substitute teacher trying to hand out the homework assignment. I think most of the folks in the room didn&apos;t actaully pay to get in (a fourth problem), and henceforth did not respect the integrity of the show. One guy actually told me to go home. He was a dick, and I let him know it, but sticking around and doing my show anyway.
Wes did his act, but confessed later on that he had to remove himself from the room while I was getting carved up. I totally understood, but I hung out and watched him get butchered anyway. My morale couldn&apos;t have been lower if you told me that my wife didn&apos;t really love me and our daughter wasn&apos;t mine. Gretchen and Leah apologized up and down, and paidus cash for our troubles. I bid Wes a farewell (he was heading back to Toronto overnight) and retired to the upstairs room to sleep a dead, dreamless sleep. After the show, a couple of people came up and said they enjoyed the show, and they were sorry the other folks were such bores, and why did they have to come out to comedy if they weren&apos;t going to act appropriately. It was nice, but provided no salve. One guy went so far as to say that I made a mistake telling people that I was from New York, that I automatically earned the crowd&apos;s disdain because I thought I was better than them. He even identified me as a Buffalo Bills fan, which provided no kinship even though their Minnesota Vikings hold the only other claim to an 0-for-4 Super Bowl record. What about Rochester spells cocky and condescending? I guess I&apos;ll never know.
I drove all day Friday, coming out of the cold and rain of Minnesota into the milder temperatures that Wisconsin held. I passed into Illinois and through Chicago around 10 o&apos;clock at night, a perfect time to travel as there were no traffic slowdowns or backups. I happened through a sliver of Indiana and made it into Michigan around 1:30 in the morning and decided to catch some rest at a patrolled rest stop along I-196. I got about 5 1/2 hours of sleep in, and then headed the rest of the way into Muskegon. I was able to check into the hotel, even though I was 7 or 8 hours ahead of check-in time. They weren&apos;t real busy, so it wasn&apos;t a problem.
I had a little breakfast, picked up a few items at Wal*Mart, and finished up my night&apos;s sleep, wanting to be rested for my headlining show at Rossi&apos;s here in Muskegon. I have worked Rossi&apos;s around five or six times, but always as a feature, so I was a little apprehensive about how I would go over as a headliner. When I arrived at the club, Rossi himself met me and motioned me over, and as he started talking to me, I felt more and more at ease. He mentioned that he saw my name on the schedule as a closer and didn&apos;t flinch because he thought I was destroying as a middle act, and that it was time to move me up. I explained that I worked with Carol from Hysterical Management over the summer, and she was impressed with what I was doing on stage and made the decision to promote me.
Well, I&apos;m proud to say that I didn&apos;t dissapoint, and not only that, but if I can pat myself on the back a little, I destroyed. I can&apos;t remember a time when I was so comfortable in a comedy room, except for perhaps a week ago last Friday when I got my standing O in Topeka. I think the common element was that both shows were in rooms that I had played a couple of times before, and so I didn&apos;t have to compensate a lot for the change in geography and I learned the lessons of what the folks would like and what they wouldn&apos;t care so much for before. Regardless, I crushed, and Rossi was quite pleased. I hung out with the middle act for a while, talking shop, and finally I decided to break camp and head back to the room. I have a couple of days off, and have to be in Dickinson, North Dakota on Tuesday for the first night of a five-day run. I&apos;ve got a deal on a hotel room in Fargo, North Dakota, but it&apos;s gonna take me 15 hours to get there....that almost wipes out Sunday altogether...I don&apos;t know if I feel good about paying for a hotel room and only getting a few hours of a stay out of it, but the alternative is sleeping in my car, and I&apos;ve had enough of that shit for one week.
O.K., I&apos;m going to get some sleep, I think. I have a thousand miles in front of me (actually more like 900, but who&apos;s counting?) but I have two days to do it, and I&apos;d rather do it on a full night&apos;s sleep. I&apos;m just excited that I&apos;m heading down the home stretch, and get to go home in a week. But I&apos;m working almost every night this week, so time should fly pretty quick.
Peace to you.

 In The Forest (Van Morrisson) 
Posted on 09/21/2006 at 01:09 AM
Continuing my whirlwind tour of the North American prairie, I&apos;m in Spicer, Minnesota today. It&apos;s a day off, and tomorrow I have a show at O&apos;Neil&apos;s Irish Pub, which is downstairs from the Green Lake Inn, the bed and breakfast where I currently reside.
Saturday in Topkea was kind of a letdown after Friday night&apos;s standing ovation. I went up and did basically the same show, but the audience just wasn&apos;t giving it back. I know I should never blame the audience, it&apos;s my job to entertain them, but I just couldn&apos;t match the intensity of the night before. Scott, the headliner, had similar problems and it wasn&apos;t like we did a bad show, but we didn&apos;t do the show we wanted to have.
The biggest problem I was facing after the show was how to get to Harris, Michigan in time for a 7 PM show, and losing an hour getting there by crossing from Central to Eastern time. I decided that I should sleep a little, and then get in the car and do my best. I couldn&apos;t wind down from the show until about 1:30, and my alarm was set for 3:00. I got about an hour and a half&apos;s worth of sleep, showered and headed to the car. After a short period of disorientation, I found my way to the expressway and started heading northeast.
I had coffee, courtesy of a 24-hour McDonald&apos;s....haven&apos;t they changed the game all the way around....and headed out. I drove into Kansas City, and got lost due to the labyrinth nature of their downtown, the darkness which was pervasive, and an early-morning rainstorm that flooded the streets and drove me to piss in a one-liter water bottle rather than get out of the car to take a leak. I finally got my bearings and headed north through Missouri and into Iowa, and the sun finally started coming up. By the time I hit Wisconsin, somewhere around the noon mark, I started doing the math and realized that I was going to be cutting things rather closely. In addition, the Green Bay Packers were playing the New Orleans Saints at home, and I would be driving right through Green Bay as the game was letting out....bad sign.
I hauled ass at some pretty ungodly speeds, and wound up passing the stadium as the game progressed. The Saints and Packers were all tied up most of the game, which was good for my cause, because a Packers blowout would have sent the Green &apos;N&apos; Gold faithful to the exits and jammed my route northward. Even though the Saints pulled away with two quick scores in the second half, I was still able to whiz past Lambeau Field, admiring the full stands of Packer faithful. The week before, the Saints had played in Cleveland, and I saw the stadium filled with orange and brown, and I felt a little deja vu for my troubles.
I wound up at the casino just a little past six, in time to get a nice shower and dress for the show. It wasn&apos;t terrible as far as casino shows go, but the stage in Harris is just a little inconvenient for comedy. The bar runs in a semi-circle in front of you, then an arc of video poker terminals, and finally the tables where the comedy audience is, the folks who are actually paying attention. I gave them a solid feature set and then headed over to the restaurant for a much-needed complimentary meal (I had the meatloaf, which was excellent, if such a thing can be said about meatloaf).
The rooms that are provided in Harris are jacuzzi suites, and I took advantage of the pulsing water on my stiff, arthritic legs. I had spent 14 hours in the car, pushing the gas pedal down to speeds of 80 or more, and I needed some relaxation. I enjoyed the last bit of &quot;Kill Bill Volume 2&quot; which was showing on TBS, and after seeing it for the first time only last month, I can say that it&apos;s becoming one of my favorite films. I&apos;m a Quentin Tarantino fan anyway, so it&apos;s not that much of a stretch. After the movie, I toweled off and decided that I couldn&apos;t sleep, so I went back downstairs to the casino, had a snack and a beverage, and made my way to the nickel slots.
I&apos;ve had some good luck with the nickel slots at Harris in the past, and my luck was still running to the black. I turned 20 bucks into just shy of 30, and satisfied that I probably wouldn&apos;t do much better by hanging around, cashed out and went back to the room, where I slept soundly, the events of the past 24 hours finally catching up with me.
The road to Duluth was uneventful and boring...I did get a chance to soak up the beauty of the Ottawa National Forest in Wisconsin, but I&apos;d done that drive before. It&apos;s just trees, trees and more trees, and the occasional gas station, small town, and then back to the forest. I checked into the Voyaguer Lakewalk Inn, and met up with headliner Wes Zaharuk later for a few beers at Carmoody&apos;s, an Irish pub just a few blocks from the hotel. We met some interesting characters, including some of the members of a local band called Trampled By Turtles, and hung out until about 1 AM.
The show on Tuesday was almost a disaster; the mc didn&apos;t show up, so the door guy served up a butchered introduction and brought me onstage to a crowd colder than a penguin&apos;s ass. They really didn&apos;t start coming alive until I started serving up the graphic sex stuff, then suddenly I was a superhero and they couldn&apos;t get enough. Wes did his thing, which is a sort of magic/variety act, and afterwards, we had a lot of the college-aged kids coming up to us (mostly drunk) and offering up praise of the &quot;You were really funny/you should have headlined/you were funny, too, but Ralph was funnier for the younger people&quot; type. I really hate those types of accolades, because they&apos;re tactless when the other comic is sitting right there. The sad fact is that Wes is really a great act, and the kids just didn&apos;t have the patience to appreciate what he was doing, but that I scored great with the flagrant oral sex/masturbation stuff shows where their adolescent attention truly lies.
Tonight is another night off, and Wes apparently has decided either to stay in Duluth or he camped out somewhere else, because he&apos;s not here at the Bed &apos;N&apos; Breakfast in Spicer. I have sincere doubts of whether there&apos;s actually going to be a breakfast in the morning as there are dirty dishes on the table in the main dining room from a conference this morning, and the lady told me she hadn&apos;t had time to clean up after them. If she can&apos;t find the time to clean some dirty dishes, I guess my toast &apos;n&apos; eggs in the morning are a fucking dead issue, but maybe they&apos;ll suprise me.
My expectations of the show tomorrow night are also pretty low; the town itself doesn&apos;t have much of a population to begin with, and the room is so small that 30 or 40 people would send it into standing room only. As I write this, though, the music is still coming up through the floor so the bar is hopping and it&apos;s only Wednesday, so maybe they really get a good crowd. Either way, it&apos;s just a paycheck and a quick exit to Muskegon that I&apos;m looking for. I have Friday off, and I think I&apos;ll try to scare up some sort of guest spot somewhere, but I honestly don&apos;t know where I could perform between here and there. Minneapolis and Chicago are both on the way, but I don&apos;t know my way around either city and I probably won&apos;t wind up going anywhere, but maybe some opportunity will drop in my lap....you never know.
With that, gentle reader, I&apos;ll sign off. I picked up quite a few books, courtesy of a few small town libraries that I stopped at along the way, and I&apos;m enjoying some quiet time just reading and relaxing. Tomorrow will have problems and challenges of it&apos;s own, so today I&apos;ll just let myself off the hook and let Harlan Ellison tell me stories until I fall asleep.
Take care,

 Applause, Applause (Blood, Sweat and Tears) 
Posted on 09/16/2006 at 05:47 PM
Dear Mom,
I got my first standing ovation last night. I&apos;m playing a club called Jeremiah Bullfrog&apos;s in Topeka, Kansas with a headliner from Las Vegas named Scott Bennett.
I was as surprised as anyone when it happened. Actually, there were quite a few things working in my favor. I&apos;ve played the room before; they do a thing called the &quot;Comedy Invasion&quot; on Tuesdays, and I guess it got so popular that they expanded it to the weekends as well. Bullfrog&apos;s is a big sports bar, with a private room and stage for the comedy. I&apos;ve done well there in the past, and had a chance to get a feel for what the Kansas crowds like.
I got a good night&apos;s sleep the night before, and had a very short drive down from St. Joseph, Missouri. When I got to the hotel, it was too early to check in, so I went across the street to Wal*Mart and got some oil for the car. Good thing, too, because I was driving dry. Thank God for synthetic oil, you can drain it right out of the car, and enough still stays bonded to the engine so that you don&apos;t seize up. I put the oil in the engine, and then couldn&apos;t shut my hood! The hood latch was sticking! I drove around to the oil change part of the store, and a kid named Lee Ralston helped me out....didn&apos;t even charge me anything. I gave him one of my CD&apos;s and I&apos;m guest-listing him for the show tonight. He really saved my hash...without that hood down, you can&apos;t really drive more than 40 miles an hour or so without the damn thing flying off (and I drive a little faster than that).
At the club, I noticed that they had reconfigured the seating to make it a bit smaller of a room. Most of the people there were watching the college football game (the parking lot was packed...I had to circle the building twice to find a spot). By showtime, the place had filled up nice and I met the mc. His name was Dan and he was from Rochester, originally. His father was a radio nomad who had relocated the family out to Topeka. Even though I worked in radio a long time, I didn&apos;t recognize his name, but that doesn&apos;t mean anything....you can&apos;t know everybody.
From the minute I hit the stage, I could tell the audience was fertile and ready to play. I did one of my safer openings, talking about getting pulled over by the cops, and there was a police officer in the front row. His table of about 8 people, I&apos;m thinking four married couples, all pointed him out immediately when I started talking about cops. He was a good sport, and it was off to the races. I almost abandoned most of my act in favor of just working with the crowd. What was particularly nice was that whenever someone shouted something out, a line from my act that I had already written seemed to be the perfect retort. I hit 35 minutes without really scratching the surface of my act, and when Dan took the mic from me and implored the audience to applaud for me again, they stood up, and I had to go back on stage and tell them that it was my first standing &quot;O&quot; ever. That seemed to make them like me more. I left so much stuff out, I could have gone at least another 20 minutes or half an hour. It was crazy.
Scott did a great job in the closing position, but he commented before and after the set that he thought I was going to be hard to follow. He didn&apos;t get a standing ovation, but he got good laughs, and afterwards, Marvin, the bartender/manager/guy in charge mentioned to me that he had a lot of good comments about me on the way out. He also asked why I wasn&apos;t headlining. I explained that I do headline, depending on the booking agent. Some are ready to give me that opportunity, while others are more comfortable with me in the feature position. I&apos;m confident that if I keep doing what I&apos;m doing, my time will come and I will get my opportunities. Anybody who&apos;s anybody in this business didn&apos;t get there overnight, or even in ten years.
Anyway, I remember all the open mic shows you would come to to support me and my efforts, and I just wanted you to know that 18 years later, that tree has finally produced fruit. I made a bunch of money on CD and DVD sales, and had to go out today and buy some new shoes (I tore the heel right off my right shoe doing a female masturbation bit.....don&apos;t ask, but it was hilarious) and a sweater...it&apos;s snowing up in the Dakotas where I&apos;m going week after next, and I didn&apos;t pack a winter jacket, just a windbreaker. I also got some Vitamin C...K Mart had a sale, buy one bottle, get one free. I couldn&apos;t pass that up.
So I have one more show tonight, then a 13-hour drive up to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I lose an hour because of the time zones, and the show is at 7 PM. That means when my show gets over tonight at 10:00 Central, 11:00 Eastern, I have exactly 20 hours to make it until showtime. If 14 of those hours are in the car, I have a wiggle room of 6 hours to play with. I think I&apos;m going to have to leave right from the show, drive as far as I can, sleep a few hours in the car, and then make it the rest of the way. Even if I can check in to the casino at 6 PM, that gives me enough time to shower and try to put myself together. I only have to talk for half an hour, then I can collapse and sleep as much as I want. Plus Monday is a day off. Still, I don&apos;t dare even trying to get a few hours sleep before driving tonight, because I don&apos;t know what kind of weather, traffic or other unscheduled slow-downs I might encounter. As a matter of fact, I&apos;m going to get a nap right now.
I love you mom, and I thank you so much for believing in me.

 If You Never Got Sick (The Wallflowers) 
Posted on 09/15/2006 at 11:49 AM
I&apos;m in the Stoney Creek Lodge in St. Joseph, Missouri. Had to think about that for a minute, the last two days are a blur.
I got home from Cleveland on Sunday night.Monday morning with a tickle in my throat. A day later, I was yakking and feeling as sick as I&apos;ve ever been, praying to God for health. I was drinking orange and pineapple juice, both no-no&apos;s to someone with sugar issues like myself, but desperate for vitamin C.
I turned the corner Tuesday afternoon, and just laid low and tried not to infect my family with rhotavirus (didn&apos;t work) and tried to eat stuff like apples that would keep my system moving (worked like a charm). Wednesday, I had a doctor&apos;s appointment.
My weight is down (good), but apparently the over-the-counter cold medicines I took put my kidneys in danger of shutting down. Great news before a two-and-a-half week roadtrip! I didn&apos;t get the call until I arrived in Missouri.
I left Wednesday night and rocketed across America. Hitting the road around 9:30, about 90 minutes later than I wanted, I made sure everything was knotted down at home. Pam wasn&apos;t feeling well and little Harmony was sneezing up phlegm, so I wanted them to be in position to recuperate without having to do much. I finished laundry, changed the bed linens to fresh and took out the garbage. Then I feebly hauled my luggage down the stairs, packed the car, and hit the road.
I was able to drive from Rochester all the way to the Ohio/Indiana border. I slept in my car in the parking lot of a TA truckstop, got about three hours of good sleep, and woke up and hit the road again. I haven&apos;t been able to sleep on my back due to the mucous in my chest, which leads to 20-minute coughing jags. Monday night, I was coughing so bad, I lost consciousness. I soldiered on.
I arrived at the hotel in St. Joe&apos;s around 5 PM Central Time. The show was at 8, but as tired as I was, I didn&apos;t dare take a nap, fearing I wouldn&apos;t get up. I ironed a shirt, checked e-mail, and took a nice, hot shower that was less soothing than I thought it would be. I got dressed and made my way to the Cobblestone Theater.
The showtime on the itinerary was wrong, so I got there half an hour early. I wound up falling asleep in a chair in the green room. I was woken by Tim, the house mc, who came in to get my intro. We chatted for 15 minutes or so and then it was time to get ready for the show.
The show was o.k., the room was better attended last time, but the folks who were there came to play. There were two lesbian girls sitting up front who I think walked out after my set, I made a comment about Jeff Gordon being gay, and told women to stop using dildoes. I think that&apos;s what set them off...one of them commented, &quot;yeah, that&apos;s what I want.&quot; I saw them in the parking lot before the show, and was mildly amused that there were lesbians in Missouri. Not that they would be from here, but that they would stay. The midwest isn&apos;t really the most &quot;gay-friendly&quot; place.
The headliner, Scott (I don&apos;t remember his last name, but he&apos;s from Las Vegas and we work together in Topeka tonight and tomorrow) had a loose, improvisational type of set, because that&apos;s what the crowd was calling for. After the show, I sold a CD, which was a welcome change from hosting in Cleveland where I sold absolutely zero for the week.
Today, I feel rested, but still scratchy in the throat. I&apos;m afraid to take any medicine for my cough for fear of damaging my internal organs, so I&apos;m just going to drink fluids, take some Vitamin C, and let my body decide if I&apos;m going to heal or die.
I want to live, if it&apos;s any consolation. I have two-and-a-half weeks of work in front of me, and a beautiful family to go home to.
Thanks for reading.

 Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll (Led Zeppelin) 
Posted on 09/09/2006 at 01:36 PM
Saturday mornings on the road are always a bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I&apos;m excited that the week is almost over and I get to go back home to my wife and daughter who I love and miss very much, but on the other hand, I&apos;m still trying to shake the stink of the Friday late show out of my head.
Actually, Friday&apos;s shows weren&apos;t that bad, the late show was actually better than the early show for me. I&apos;m starting to understand that the Cleveland audiences really aren&apos;t into doing math when you tell them a joke....it almost has to be the bluntest possible presentation, and they love the graphic sex stuff. I&apos;ve been closing with a bit about solving the Mexican immigration problem by sending Mexicans to Iraq to fight, and I guess a gentleman from the first show thought it was racist. I actually say that Mexicans would probably get the whole war over with in about a week, and the joke is complimentary about their work ethic, but I guess I&apos;m out of line saying that. The guy mentioned something to each of the other comics just in range for me to hear, but never addressed me specifically. Fine. Guys like that are just looking for something to be pissed about, I&apos;ve seen it a hundred times if I&apos;ve seen it once. It bothers me, but I&apos;ll have it purged from my mind in a couple of hours. Writing about it helps, I think.
Our crowds this week have all been pretty sketchy, in attendance as well as quality. They&apos;re picky, they groan a lot, and it&apos;s not a reflection of the talent on stage, because the other guys I&apos;m working with are very funny, and not for nothing, but I think I&apos;m worthy of being up there, too. Working the mc spot at an &quot;A&quot; room is a little new to me, but it&apos;s not that much different than mc&apos;ing anywhere else. The thing I&apos;ve been getting used to is doing the shorter time, and not having any warmup to coast on. I&apos;ve been doing a lot of &quot;rah-rah&quot; stuff about the Cleveland Browns, and they sort of like that, so it&apos;s not horrible (I follow it up with a joke....I&apos;m not just straight pandering).
Yesterday, Nate decided we should go out and walk, which I was all for,except I didn&apos;t realize what I was in for. This heartless motherfucker took me up a 45 degree incline that almost made my fat man&apos;s heart explode. I was drenched in sweat by the time we arrived at the lakefront. We went to the Browns&apos; stadium and tried to convince the security guard that we were out-of-town visitors and it would be nice if he would let us walk around a little bit, but he gave us the elbows and knuckles quicker than you can say &quot;I hope the Saints whip your sorry asses this Sunday.&quot; He was very terse. Nate chided him a little, saying &quot;Hey, you don&apos;t have to whip the Taser gun out, we&apos;re leaving.&quot; I thought the whole exchange could&apos;ve been handled better....I think Nate&apos;s mistake was that he didn&apos;t try to talk to the guard through the little window, he walked all the way around and stepped halfway into the open door of the guard shack. That&apos;s a no-no, apparently.
We kept walking and found our way to the world famous Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll Hall of Fame. Pickin&apos;s were a little better there, as we were able to talk our way in to some $8 day passes for free, with the promise that we would leave tickets at the Improv for the nice lady day manager who helped us out. I know we&apos;re not big stars or anything, but we are entertainers from out of town....it&apos;s nice when you get the little acknowledgements, even if they don&apos;t present you with the key to the city.
Anyway, the RNRHOF is great, even if it&apos;s a little smaller than I thought it would be. They had wonderful exhibits on the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and hundreds of other names. They had about a thousand guitars, former properties of absolute legends, they had vinyl that would bring a king&apos;s ransom on eBay, outfits that were worn on stage and in videos by stars aplenty. It was staggering. They had childhood drawings that Jimi Hendrix did when he was called John (didn&apos;t know he changed his name) and apparently, he was a big UCLA Bruins fan. He drew pictures of other college athletes catching footballs and running for touchdowns, and I&apos;m sure someone with a knowledge of psychology would have a field day. The coolest part of the Hendrix exhibit were some quotes by him that were up on the wall ringing the exhibit room....one of them stuck in my head, and I had to write it down. It said, &quot;My own thing is in my head. I hear sounds and if I don&apos;t get them together, nobody else will.&quot; I thought that was pretty amazing, thinking about the sounds that must have been in Jimi Hendrix&apos;s head....it probably would have turned a normal man insane.
I was really impressed by some of the outfits in the collection....they had Chuck D&apos;s outfit from Public Enemy&apos;s &quot;Terrordome&quot; tour, and Bruce Springsteen&apos;s outfit that he wore on the cover of &quot;Born In The USA.&quot; Now granted, it was just a white T-shirt and blue jeans with a red cap in the pocket....that&apos;s a pretty easy outfit to fake.....but It looked pretty authentic to me. The jeans were all worn and ripped, and it made we wonder if when Bruce was buying those jeans if he even had a clue that they would make it to the cover of an album of his that not only would go multi-platinum, but would become one of the most iconic releases of the decade? Think about that stuff, Casual Male employees, next time I come in and buy a fat guy shirt.
They had one exhibit that I&apos;ll probably never forget, and that was an amp stack built by the guitar player from the Quicksilver Messenger Service, a psychedelic band from San Francisco. He had welded horns and trumpets to the amp stack, so that when the amplified noise came out of the cabinets, it would go through the horns, augmenting the sound. It was a horrible, acid-trippy looking thing, but I&apos;d pay money to hear what a guitar sounded like coming through it. Stuff like that really fascinates me. Another display that really touched me was the Who&apos;s John Entwhistle&apos;s &quot;Buzzard&quot; bass guitar. He designed it for the company that manufactured it, and it looked like an actual turkey buzzard. The headstock and body were green with gold hardware, and it had a black maple neck. The headstock was in the shape of the head of the bird, and the body was the rest of the guitar. I remember being an elementary bass guitar student and reading the bass player magazines of the 80&apos;s and seeing ads for the buzzard bass and thinking, &quot;Wow, if I ever get a couple of thousand dollars together, that would be an awesome thing to have.&quot; Well, John&apos;s dead now, and I think a buzzard bass would be somewhere in the tens of thousands of dollars, particularly a signed one like the RNRHOF has. I&apos;m just glad I got to see it.
Our tour of the hall ended with a film in the hall&apos;s screening room. It outlined all of the hall&apos;s inductees, year after year, on three big screens. From the first year, 1986, all the way thorugh the present day, 2006, the presentation lasted an hour and it included some amazing concert footage, TV appearances on shows like &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Soul Train,&quot; and interview footage of some of the most amazing acts in history. The presentation lined them up, one by one, and they just kept coming. I sang along to almost every song, played air guitar and air drums, and slapped my knees in time to dozens of rock classics. I really got teary-eyed when rock stars who had passed were mentioned, performers like Roy Orbison, the recently departed Billy Preston and Johnny Cash. I got all worked up when performers that I love were mentioned, The Clash, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Neil Young. It was really amazing seeing vintage footage of guys like Isaac Hayes, Sly and The Family Stone, Elvis Costello and Jackson Browne. George Harrison made me cry a little. Another time I cried was when they showed a young Michael Jackson as a member of the Jackson 5. It was horrible for me to think about what a train wreck he&apos;s become, a tortured soul, a monster. Even the 80&apos;s Michael, who was inducted in 2001, still looked pretty stable. Others made my heart just pump, like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Cream, Black Sabbath, Bob Marley and the Byrds. I think I jumped up when the Ramones came on. It was an absolute thrill, and I recommend it.
On a cute little aside note, Nate and I entered the theater just as the previous performance was ending, and there was a middle-aged couple over in the corner, sharing a kiss when they thought no one was looking. It was neat to see that, and I hope Pamela and I feel that way about each other when we&apos;re older. Even though I don&apos;t think the RNRHOF is really her speed, she doesn&apos;t know anything about rock &apos;n&apos; roll. Just kidding, sweetheart, I know you read this!
So anyway, you can see more about the RNRHOF at www.rockhall.com and if you get a chance, go.

 Coming Home (Cinderella) 
Posted on 09/06/2006 at 12:36 AM
Good evening from Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Browns, the Indians, and the Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll Hall of Fame. I know I haven&apos;t checked in for over a week, you can scold me later.
When last you read me, gentle reader, I was working the Laugh In Comedy Cafe with Amaru from Kalamazoo, Michigan. Saturday, I was supposed to see my good friend Rickey K., but a family emergency precluded that meeting. The shows Saturday were interesting, to say the least, and during the late show, some folks got kicked out for being too noisy in the showroom. They wound up buying CD&apos;s from me in the parking lot...it always strikes me that some of the nicest people just don&apos;t &quot;go out&quot; well. Joe Galanis, the owner of the club, showed up Saturday night to pay the comics and had some nice words for me. I hope to return to the club sometime in the spring of next year.
Sunday, we packed up and left the beautiful Holiday Inn Select and headed toward the Atlantic Coast through Alligator Alley (route 75) and hooked up with Pam&apos;s Uncle Paul and his family in Sunrise, Florida. We went out to a Chinese buffet, and I learned how to crack open crab legs. We had a nice visit, then headed back to Dad&apos;s house, some 4 1/2 hours away. We had lunch plans to go to (yet another) Chinese buffet with Dad and one of his friends from the Villages the next day, so we had to get home relatively early, but still didn&apos;t make it until almost midnight.
Pam, Harmony and I bid our tear-stained farewells to my Dad on Wednesday, and headed on up to Daleville, Alabama, home of the MVP Sports Bar, and my comedy show with headliner D. T. Owens. Our show was pretty sparsely attended, as Daleville is an Army base town, and a lot of the soldiers were shipping out for Labor Day weekend. We still had a nice little showing, including a couple of civilian girls who turned out to be &quot;really into each other.&quot; One was dressed like Gwen Stefani in camouflage, the other girl was more a Goth chick with a leather bustier that had straps in the front, some sort of black spandex pants, and a Tuesday Addams haircut. Or something like that, I really wasn&apos;t paying attention....Lesbians don&apos;t really do anything for me.
We canceled our plans to see my sister in North Carolina, the time aspect just wasn&apos;t going to shake out, same for my friend Bruce in Fredericksburg. We drove all day Thursday and when we couldn&apos;t drive anymore, I called the Days Inn 1-800 line for reservations. What a mistake.
The first guy I spoke with had a bad computer system, and a foreign accent. It was clear to me that Days Inn was farming out their reservation line to offshore operators, and he implored me to call back and get another operator. I did, and a young lady from Sri Lanka or Pakistan took my reservation for a room in Fort Wright, Kentucky, just three miles south of Cincinatti, Ohio. We got a great room rate, and they took our credit card info over the phone, and we were on our way.
When we got there, there were four police cars in front of the place and two &quot;guests&quot; handcuffed and seated on the ground. That should have been red flag number one, but we soldiered on anyways. The front desk clerk didn&apos;t have our reservation, so I made one at the desk, and they honored the rate I was quoted over the phone. We made our way to the elevator, which smelled like urine, and were greeted with dirty laundry in the breezeway. Harmony didn&apos;t really notice that the place was a shithole, but Pam was staring daggers into my head. Our room was dingy, with ceiling panels that were bowing from water damage or perhaps some other sort of detritus that had fallen. Regardless, we weren&apos;t going to see what was on them when they fell, because we weren&apos;t staying. The clerk happily rescinded our reservation, and off we went.
We rolled into Covington, Kentucky, about 2 o&apos;clock in the morning, and wound up at the Holiday Inn. They signed me up for a Priority Club membership (complete with late checkout), and we wound up paying triple what the Days Inn was charging, but for a room that was 1000% better. Checking out of that hotel was really painful, I can tell you, and we still had eight hours of driving to do. We stopped at a Golden Corral for lunch, and made it home around 11:30 It was great to be home, but after a month on the road, I didn&apos;t look forward to the piles of mail and laundry to be attended to, and the empty fridge that we left (don&apos;t wanna come home to rotten produce, spoiled dairy and other non-edible treats in the fridge). It took a day of rest and recuperation to really get rolling (Harmony, was of course, full of energy and treated our 6,200 mile journey like it was nothing) and a couple of shopping trips got us up to speed. I had one day of rest to get ready for this week, and after paying car insurance, picking up prescription medication, doing banking and hitting the post office, I was ready to leave home again. My laundry hadn&apos;t even dried yet!
I&apos;m working this week at the Cleveland Improv with headliner Jack Mayberry and feature Nathan Craig. I knew Jack from the old Alt.Comedy.Standup newsgroup, we both used to be contributor to the board before it became overrun with trolls (non-participants who egg the regulars on and start pissing matches). Nathan is a new friend who hails from the Chicago area. When I arrived at the club around 6:30, he had just called and was speeding across western Ohio to make it to the show on time (he did). He sat on someone&apos;s gum in the bar, and I just happened to have a jar of peanut butter with me for the trip, and we&apos;re in the process of testing the reliability of that home remedy.
O.K., I&apos;m about to go off to sleep. Unfortunately, my last memory of home was little Harmony crying when Pam told her I had to leave to go to work. I think she saw the luggage and realized that it wasn&apos;t just going to be for a few hours. It ripped me up, that&apos;s for sure. I fed her breakfast and changed her and hugged her this morning, but it doesn&apos;t change the fact that I&apos;m going to be gone for a whole week and not just a few days. It really hurts. Next week, I leave for two and a half weeks, and that&apos;s gonna hurt, too.
Pleasant dreams.

 Raw Deal (Judas Priest) 
Posted on 08/26/2006 at 01:35 AM
Good evening from the Holiday Inn Select in Fort Myers, Florida. I&apos;m working the Laugh In Comedy Cafe with Amaru from Kalamazoo, Michigan, and it&apos;s been a great experience so far. Pam, Harmony and I packed up the car and left my Dad&apos;s house around 1:30 on Thursday, and enjoyed a cool, refreshing drive down the left coast of Florida, thanks to $375 worth of new fan motor that Jenkins Mazda was happy to replace for me. The AC had been shitting the bed, running intermittently or not at all, and it had to be replaced, especially with the triple-digit head indexes here in the Sunshine State.
We got to the hotel and checked in, and the show Thursday night was cool. They ran open mic before the regular acts (Me and &apos;Ru) and there were the regular assortment of kids with potential and blooming assholes. One kid made references to Nazi Germany and wondered why there were no Jewish football players. He went over like a fart in church, and he used the worst word you can use on stage...I won&apos;t tell you what it is, but it starts with &quot;C&quot; and rhymes with &quot;Cunt.&quot; Another guy was a blatant Mitch Hedberg clone, with the rhythm down, but no material.
My show was decent, but it was a chatty crowd, filled with guests of the open mic comics, and once their friends had vacated the stage, they stuck around out of politeness, but talked out of impoliteness. An Australian kid tipped me $20 as I was selling product, &quot;For your kid&quot; he said. I&apos;ll take it, are you kidding me?
Tonight was fun, although my time got away from me first show. I didn&apos;t look at my watch when I took the stage, and wound up running almost five minutes over, but the club was sparsely attended so I didn&apos;t catch too much hell over it. If it had been a big room, they probably would have been pissed because it&apos;s hard to clear all the tables and get the new folks in, but that wasn&apos;t the case. I got nice feedback from Chris, the mc (and one of the mangers at the club) who liked my material. &quot;You need to get on TV&quot; he said. No shit! Easier said than done, my friend.
Second show was good, but one drunk girl kept &quot;oohing&quot; at my jokes. Oooh? Is that an appropriate response at a comedy show? No, it&apos;s not. It&apos;sthe sign of a sophomoric mind raised by an uptight, white, suburban mother. I scolded her and it felt good. The rest of the audience fell in line. I&apos;m in charge, motherfuckers, don&apos;t tell ME!
Tomorrow I get to see my good friend, Rickey K. I haven&apos;t seen him since my last southwestern Florida trip, about a year ago. He was one of my closes comedy buddies before he moved down here. I&apos;m excited, he&apos;ll get to meet my daughter, and see Pam...he hasn&apos;t seen her in three years, since the last time she came down here with me and I played Sarasota.
Also, we hit the coolest Chinese Buffet that I&apos;ve seen in a while. They had the most *excellent* sushi selection, we decided that we better go back tomorrow. Some of our dining choices have been sketchy this trip, so when we find something good, it seems like the thing to do to stick with it.
We&apos;re still trying to figure out what to do to get home, after the single one-nighter I have in Alabama, it&apos;s 20 hours home. I can stop and see my sister in North Carolina, but that means eating the cost on a hotel room. My friend Bruce is in the mix as well, but staying with him would mean negating seeing my sister or stretching the journey home one more day, in which case I wind up paying for a hotel room anyway. I hope to get this figured out. We&apos;re going to see Pam&apos;s uncle in Sunshine, Florida on Sunday. We haven&apos;t seen him since we got married back in 2000, so that will be nice.
O.K., I&apos;m going to vacate now. Sleep doesn&apos;t come easy, especially when my roommates insist on watching Disney Channel until they fall asleep. Pleasant dreams.
One thought before I go....my friend Steve Burr doesn&apos;t like the way I title my blogs with song titles, and thinks I should quit it. What do you think?

 Talk Dirty (John Entwhistle) 
Posted on 08/20/2006 at 01:17 PM
I am in Florida and the humidity is killing me. Last night I stepped outside of the comedy club to make a phone call, and it was so humid, I could smell the detergent my shirt was washed in. Yeah, it was *that* humid.
At the same time, my nose has dried out something fierce, and I can&apos;t stop pulling out hard boogers plus hairs. I know God had a plan when he designed us to have boogers, but I&apos;ll be damned if I know what it is.
The show Thursday night with Dobie Maxwell was fun, in that way that I was suffering in a redneck hellhole, but with a buddy, so it was o.k. The accomodations were freaking out my lovely bride Pamela, who couldn&apos;t believe that there was a crack under the door of our room at the Motel 6 big enough to see daylight through. She was convinced that hordes of insects, of which she is deathly afraid, would enter the room during the night, which of course, is rank foolishness. The room was pretty grubby, though, and if you walked around barefoot, your feet told the story of neglect that was the rug cleaning program at the Palm Bay Motel 6.
The show itself was in a quasi-sports bar in a strip mall, reasonably well attended and with a little more attention to detail than the usual one-nighter; the room with the pool tables was cordoned off by heavy curtains, so you didn&apos;t have to speak over the clacking of billiard balls. It was a nice touch, and I appreciated it. The only duress came during my set, when about ten minutes in, they decided to eject the only black man in the room, a drunken gentleman who couldn&apos;t resist the temptation to walk around the room and engage *everyone* in conversation. I soldiered on during the bouncing, until I realized what was happening and took a break. I managed to get the room back after he was ejected, and we were off to the races. Dobie drew some hecklers, but we both just hit &apos;em with high speed comedy, allowing no seams with which to continue the drunken retorts.
The next morning, I had to attend to a brake light that had appeared on my dashboard. A trip to Jiffy Lube, our oil-change destination of choice, yielded a full-service oil change, new air filter, and the service man was nice enough to inform me that while they do not add brake fluid, he walked me through the process and even took one of the front wheels off to inspect the pads, which passed our visual inspection. A cup of coffee and a trip to Advanced Auto Parts for a $1.48 bottle of brake fluid, and the dashboard light was off, my stress level had dropped to normal (which is still pretty high).
The drive to Panama City, Florida, was a nut-buster, and my route nickel-and-dimed me every step of the way. I blame it on the close proximity to Disney World and Orlando in general. We made our way west to route 75 and then north to route 10, and then the trail of tears across the panhandle.
We arrived at the Warehouse Comedy Zone&apos;s Comedy Cottage, a two-unit dwelling in a somewhat shady neighborhood. We punched our access code in and entered, to find a nice big bed, futon, our own bathroom (the bane of traveling comics....sharing a bathroom with the other guy/gal), wireless internet, a mini-fridge and microwave. It&apos;s quite a pity that such a well-furnished and comfortable place would only be used for two days! And after the myriad shit-holes I&apos;ve stayed in during my comedy career, it was a breath of fresh air.
The shows on Friday night were sparsely attended, and first show, I was really showing how tired and road-frazzled I was. I was all over the board, and turned in a show that was o.k., but not up to my standards, and certainly not what I wanted my first impression to be. The itinerary for the club indicated that they wanted to be a &quot;cleaner&quot; comedy club, and a lot of my material is dirtier, loaded with language (because I talk like that) and reflective of my comedy upbringing: Canadian comics who have to win over the respect of loggers, hunters and fishermen, and ain&apos;t gonna do it with no pansy-pickin&apos; language...the comics I came up watching.
Headliner Tim Statum, who I worked with before, went up and did his show with no sign of censorship, using whatever language and material he saw fit, and second show, I just let loose and did my show. It went over well, and I even got accolades from the owner about how I handled some latecomers who interrupted the show. Saturday night, I went up and did my thing, allowing myself to become loose and improvisational, and it paid off in spades. Richard, the club manager, really thanked me for the great job all weekend, and I felt vindicated. I have to remember to stick to my guns and ride the horse that got me here. I can change the act as far as losing the offending language, but I can&apos;t meddle with the content and continue to be myself. Second show I went into a mini-rant about how supporting the troops doesn&apos;t mean putting one of those asshole yellow ribbon magnets on your car. I had punchlines prepared that I put in, but it was one of those things that I just went into and didn&apos;t plan on saying, and it got the laugh and applause.
Today, Pam, Harmony and I make the trip to Fort Walton Beach, another Comedy Zone room that I did last year on my Florida trip. It&apos;s at one of those &quot;Howl At The Moon&quot; dueling piano bars, and last year I did really well there, so I&apos;m looking forward to knocking one out of the park. I have the confidence and know what to expect, so that&apos;s a big plus in my column. Also, I did well with product there last year, but of course, that was before the hurricane hit. This summer, product sales are sucking the pipe, and with $3 a gallon gasoline, I&apos;m really taking a hit.
I&apos;m about to shower up and shake the sand of Panama City from my heels, but looking forward to coming back next year. Have a great week, and I&apos;ll check in from Fort Myers next weekend.

 I Don&apos;t Remember (Peter Gabriel) 
Posted on 08/18/2006 at 12:05 AM
Good afternoon from Palm Bay, Florida, just down the road from Melbourne on the beautiful Atlantic coast. The great Florida summer tour continues, with bad news on the comedy front this week; my return trip to New York, which would be taking me through three different North Carolina cities, has been canceled. That leaves me with a dead drive from Alabama to Rochester, New York. I&apos;ve been beating the drums to find work between here and home, but with only a couple of weeks to prepare, the prospects are dim. My good buddy, R. Bruce, who lives in Fredericksburg, Virginia, has offered the hospitality of his home to me and my family, which would offer a welcome respite on our drive home without having to dig into my pocket for a hotel, so I&apos;m thankful for that. I met Bruce several years ago on a Keith Gisser run through Pennsylvania and Ohio as I accompanied my comedy buddy Ray Salah on the jaunt, and we&apos;ve been friends ever since. Bruce is the kind of friend that I can go a year without seeing, and still be able to pick right up where we left off when I see him again. He&apos;s a great comic and a talented musician, and he&apos;s got stories galore.
Last night I worked in Sebring, Florida, just a couple of hours south of where my dad lives. The gig was in the Four Points Sheraton, probably the nicest hotel I&apos;ll get to stay in this month, and the show was good, but didn&apos;t go off as planned.
The itinerary said the show was at 8:00, but Reinhard, the general manager of the hotel, informed me that the show was actually at 8:30, which gave me a little extra time to get situated. Pam and Harmony and I ate dinner at a sketchy Chinese Buffet restaurant (our piggish dining companions at the next table over couldn&apos;t control their infant, about Harmony&apos;s age, and the tot pushed a cup of tea off the table, showering Pam and Harmony in cold Chinese Tea...and without an acknowledgement of regret, or an acknowledgement at all, which I thought was crass).
I arrived at the lobby bar at 8:00 P.M., and at that time, the headliner had not been heard from. I happened to know the comic, and had their number in my cell phone. I called, got the voice mail, and asked them if they were en route, or had forgotten the show, or what. I got a call back and was informed that they were just getting on the road, and wouldn&apos;t be arriving until after 10:00 P.M. &quot;If the show is at 8:30, and I&apos;m doing 35 minutes, then what good is arriving at 10 o&apos;clock going to do?&quot; I wondered. The management, in their wisdom, decided to start the show at 8:45, and asked me to stretch. The crowd was very elderly, as you would imagine a Florida audience would be, and I was requested to work clean. I pulled every trick in the book and capped out at 55 minutes, closing at 9:40. The host, a radio D.J., informed the crowd that the headliner wasn&apos;t around yet, but would be coming soon, and the old folks started heading for the door in droves; it looked like Bingo at the VFW had just let out.
The headliner (a friend of mine, mind you) arrived at 10:15, and only about a third of the house still remained. I retired to my room and collapsed right away; I was pretty much emotionally drained. The hotel paid me by check in a big white envelope marked &quot;Thank You&quot; and I thought for a second that there might be a little bonus money in there for the effort, but the only thing that was in there was a check for the contractually agreed upon amount. To make matters even more disappointing, they wouldn&apos;t cash the check at the hotel, I had to run into town this morning and find the bank it was drawn upon, and then provide them with I.D., a Florida mailing address (I used my Dad&apos;s), and then get back on the road going the other way.
Tonight, I&apos;ll be working with headliner Dobie Maxwell out of Chicago, and he&apos;s a good buddy that I&apos;ve been through the trenches with several times. Last time we worked together was January up in Battle Creek, Michigan, so it&apos;s interesting to be working with him in Florida. I have no idea who I get to work with this weekend in Panama City and Fort Walton Beach, but I&apos;m sure it will be a good time.
Hope your summer is going well, and I&apos;ll send postcards if I find any.

 Gator Country (Molly Hatchet) 
Posted on 08/12/2006 at 07:23 PM
Standup comedy is not a team sport!!!!
Saying hello from Lady Lake, Florida, from stately Tetta Manor, home of my father here in the Villages. It&apos;s a balmy 92 degrees under an unforgiving Summer sun, and I&apos;m off on a Saturday night for the third time this year. I don&apos;t mind saying that it&apos;s an ugly feeling.
The plan was to visit Poppa Tetta and bring Pamela and Harmony along, so Harmony could finally meet her grandfather. I&apos;m proud to say that the mission has been accomplished, and now I can die with no regrets. We&apos;ve still got Aunt Nickki to see up in North Carolina on the way home, but my father is in his 70&apos;s and a cancer survivor, so I didn&apos;t want to play with time. My sister is still a youngster, so she&apos;s not as dire a circumstance. Nickki is still young enough to travel and probably could meet Harmony somewhere along the line without my help, but Dad doesn&apos;t travel anymore, so I had to bring the mountain to Mohammed, so to speak.
I was originally supposed to be working in Johnson City, Tennesse tonight, but the hotel canceled the comedy, so we came to Florida a couple of days early. I performed in three states so far this week, so having Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday shows takes the sting away from being unemployed for the weekend.
We packed the car and left for the Volunteer State around 11:30 Monday night. I packed the trunk as tight as I could, moved Harmony&apos;s car seat over directly behind the driver&apos;s seat, and loaded the back seat with the remainder of the bags. I also had to pack a stroller and a pack &apos;n&apos; play (that&apos;s a portable playpen/crib for those of you without children), and it turned out to be a real cumbersome load. Anytime Harmony dropped something, neither Pam nor I could reach it, being blocked out by the bags and cases in the back.
We drove overnight, stopping around 4 A.M. for some eggs at a truckstop in Ohio. Ohio&apos;s a bitch of a state to drive through when you&apos;re just going east and west, but we were driving diagonally from Cleveland down through Columbus and down into Louisville, Kentucky. I pounded a sugar-free Red Bull (four hours of sleep in a can!) and the girls passed out about 5 A.M. I drove until a red sun started peeking through dark rain clouds, and then drove some more. We pulled into Clarksville, Tennesee, home of the Ft. Campbell Army base, and checked into the hotel around 1 P.M. Central Time. I slept the sleep of the damned as Pam began baby-proofing the room and setting up for our one-day stay.
The gig was Tippers Pub, and from my experience last year, I knew it was a lot of youngsters and a fair share of enlisted men and women from the base. An mc who&apos;s name escapes me got onstage and dug a hole that took me ten minutes to dig out of...and all he did was be unengaging. I finally left the stage and climbed up on a chair in the middle of the audience and started barking at them in my best booming voice; that got their attention. Hey, when you&apos;ve got hot air like I have, microphones are for sissies.
Mike Armstrong, the ex-cop from the Bob and Tom Show, was the headliner, and we&apos;re old friends from back when I managed a club. He did well and we did the pal-around thing until we got paid, then we got the hell out of there. I got back to the hotel, and had a good night&apos;s sleep, readying myself for the drive to Atlanta.
The next morning, we packed up early and got on the road, heading for McDonough, Georgia, about 20 minutes south of Atlanta. We had an uneventful day until a major traffic backup on route 24 East stopped us dead. Pam had the foresight to go to AAA and pick up maps, so she navigated us out onto back roads that allowed us to circumnavigate the traffic jam. At one point, we were driving on a river road and looking across the river at the stopped traffic on 24. After about an hour, we hit route 75 and started our journey south.
We used the carpool lane (3 of us in the car, and one of the few benefits of taking the family along) and squirted through Atlanta pretty quickly. We got to the Country Inn Suites and checked in just in time for me to get a shower, iron a shirt, and make it to the show. The club, a new place called Cruizers, wasn&apos;t very well attended, but the folks who were there enjoyed the show well enough. I worked with Kurt Green out of Augusta, Georgia, and we had a pretty decent show of it. I was happy to have pulled a show on a day that was supposed to be a day off...the idea of paying for a hotel room just doesn&apos;t appeal to me after years of having them paid for by the clubs. One lady at the show, an older woman who reminded me of Minnie Pearl, tried contributing to the show. &quot;What kind of bee don&apos;t sting ya?&quot; she said. &quot;Boobies&quot; I replied, trying to defuse the joke by providing my own punchline. She said &quot;Huh?&quot; and I said &quot;Those things in your lap, grandma!&quot; I hate to say it but it was one of my best laughs of the night. I have no shame....if they&apos;re laughing, I&apos;m working.
Thursday, it was back across 24 to Paducah, Kentucky, home of Froggy&apos;s, another Comedy Zone room. I was back working with Mike Armstrong, and we benefitted from moving from the Eastern to Central time zone, and picked up the extra hour. The show was great, there were twice to three times as many people there as there were when I played there the year before. A young lady named Jennifer caught me at the bar before the show and asked me to rip on her friend, a clueless young man named Derick, but I wound up tearing her a new one when she started chatting with people at her table during my set (she was sitting in the front row). Afterwards, I threw her a free CD as a goodwill gesture for being set up the way I did. Frank, the owner of the club (and a hell of a nice guy) was very complimentary, and even though his club is a redneck hellhole, I would probably go back. When I mentioned during my set that my wife is half black, you could feel the air suck right out of the room. It was funny, but not funny at the same time. Earlier in my set, I did a Klan reference, and got way bigger applause than I really wanted. It&apos;s apparently a big area for that sort of thing, even though there were black and white people in the club sitting next to each other and enjoying each other&apos;s company. Latent racism is a bitch, but it&apos;s better than the alternative.
Friday was the trail of tears drive to Florida. I was supposed to have a replacement gig Friday night in Ocala, Florida, but that gig fell out, leaving us with no schedule or urgency. We hit the road at 11:00 A.M. Central Time, and made the 13 hour trip to my Dad&apos;s house, getting in around 1:30 in the morning. On the way, nothing really spectacular happened, but we did pass one of the most interesting vehicles I&apos;ve ever seen. The vehicle was a school bus that the owner painted olive-drab, with paisley designs on the back, and it looked like a hippy Army transport. The thing that made it really stand out was that the owner had taken two Volkswagen buses, cut the bottoms off of them, and welded them to the top of the bus. They had window-unit air conditioners in them, and we wound up catching up with the folks at a rest stop outside of Chatanooga.
I spoke with the young lady who was watching after her kids as her husband was talking on his cell phone, and she invited me to take some pictures and poke my head inside the bus. There were ladders leading up into the welded-on bus tops, which were bedrooms in the vehicle. The whole thing ran on french-fry oil, which she informed me that donut shops and restaurants were more than happy to give away. I&apos;m going to post some pictures when I get them developed, so stay tuned. We gave them some snacks (Mama Davis had picked us up way more stuff than we were going to use, God bless her heart) and a copy of my CD, and we hit the road.
I have three days off before my two week tour of Florida starts, in which I&apos;ll be hitting the towns of Sebring, Palm Bay, Panama City, Fort Walton Beach and Fort Myers. I&apos;ll be working for four different employers, and every year the work down here seems to get more plentiful. I&apos;m really thankful for the opportunity to play here because I get to see my dad, and the work helps facilitate that. We&apos;ve driven 2,500 miles so far and spent about $200 on gas. It&apos;s another day (or month) at the office for me, but it&apos;s quite an adventure so far for Pam and Harmony. Harmony has been a real trooper this whole time....if they gave out &quot;Iron Baby&quot; awards, she would be in line for one...except for some night terrors just before arriving here at Dad&apos;s house, she never cried or figeted in her car seat the whole way, and that&apos;s tough to do for anyone.
Pam has relatives down here as well, and we may get to see some of them before we start heading north again; I hope we do. Chances like this don&apos;t come along every day.
Stay out of the hot sun, and I&apos;ll check in again if anything exciting happens.

 Bullet With Butterfly Wings (Smashing Pumpkins) 
Posted on 08/04/2006 at 12:17 PM
Sorry I haven&apos;t checked in for a while, I&apos;ve been busy; busy ducking 100 degree temperatures, trying to work and keep to somewhat of a regular routine.
Last week at the Comix Cafe went off without a hitch, except that the air conditioning was considerably less than somewhat. I was running out of steam (no pun intended) on stage at various points past the 30 minute mark. The shows went well, except for our Saturday early show, where mysteriously, a comic was given a guest spot which went long and turned my &quot;co-headlining&quot; spot into 20 minutes. Regardless, we had a lot of good feedback, and one of my old schoolmates from grade school came out with his wife. I hadn&apos;t seen this guy in 20 years or more. His mother used to be my Sunday school teacher, and she flunked me in second grade because I didn&apos;t make enough days to pass. I was the only kid in third grade public school who was going to second grade Sunday school! Needless to say, I took a lot of razzing for that, and I did what any good Catholic would do...I quit, and renounced God.
We caught a squirrel in our attic last weekend. We hired an exterminator who came in and left some baited traps, the kind that captures the animal live in a cage. I called Stan, the guy who comes and picks up the animal for transport and release, and he was on vacation. He asked me if I could keep the animal alive for three days until he got back. I decided that it was too hard to feed and water the little rat; the only way I could give him water was to put ice cubes on top of his cage and let them melt down into the cage. I don&apos;t know if that was effective at all, so I just decided to take matters into my own hands.
I put on some heavy leather gloves, picked up the cage, and took my pony-tailed friend down to the car, putting him cage and all into the trunk. I felt like a mafia hit man taking a snitch &quot;for a ride.&quot; I drove the little guy to the Ontario Beach Park, and because it was Friday night, the beach parking lot was abandoned, except for a car I parked next to that had people getting sweaty and exchanging fluids in it. I considered flashing them a caged squirrel to give &apos;em a little thrill, but reconsidered. I moved my car to a different, well-lit spot, and started to work.
Now, I had examined the other trap (the one with nobody home) to figure out how to release my rodent captive with the most efficiency, and without getting a rabid bite for my troubles. The only problem was the little guy was freaked out, and it took me about ten minutes to realize he was standing on the bait pedal, and the trap wouldn&apos;t open in that position. I finally got him off the pedal, and opened the trap, and after pouring water and beer on him, I got him to vacate the trap. He sauntered off into the night, disappearing behind one of the beach pavillions. I guess I can add &quot;animal disposal&quot; to my ever-growing resume, and if this whole comedy thing doesn&apos;t pan out, I can get into the extermination business. Hey, it worked for Tom DeLay....
Tuesday, I made the trek down to Cleveland for a fill-in show. I was performing as part of &quot;feature night,&quot; sharing the bill with Maronzio Vance from Los Angeles, and Ryan Dalton from NYC. I went on first, and had a really good show. I got a couple of applause breaks, not patting myself on the back, but I didn&apos;t do anything out of the ordinary....the Cleveland Improv is just an exceptional room. They had a huge turnout for a Tuesday night, and their audiences are primed to laugh...it&apos;s a comic&apos;s dream come true.
I left for the gig around 2:30 in the afternoon, made the four-hour drive, hung out, did the show, and drove four hours back. I arrived home around 2:30 in the morning, capping a 12-hour day. Not bad for a day at the office.
My corporate gig on Thursday fell through....they just didn&apos;t call me. The last communication I got was from the buyer who received my DVD and said she enjoyed it and was passing it along to her bosses...I guess they didn&apos;t think I was appropriate, or funny, or that they didn&apos;t even want a comedian for their event, but they didn&apos;t even give me the courtesy of an e-mail saying no thanks. Corporate gigs blow. I applaud the comics who can jump through the hoops for the money, but I guess I&apos;m not one of them. I&apos;m a club comic, pure and simple.
Today and tomorrow, I host at the Comix Cafe for Aries Spears from Mad TV...he&apos;s a talented guy, so the club ought to draw pretty well. They better get their air conditioning situation corrected, though, because I don&apos;t think Mr. Spears will stand for working in that sweat box that I tolerated all last week.
Next week, we&apos;re getting ready for the big trip south to Florida, with stops along the way in Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky, Alabama and North Carolina. My little baby daughter Harmony is gonna get to meet her Grandpa Tetta and her Aunt Nickki and Uncle Dennis along the way, and that&apos;s exciting in itself. I&apos;m going to be working with some good friends down there, Al Katz and Dobie Maxwell to name a couple, Amaru (who I only know from the comedian online chat boards), and Mike Armstrong. I&apos;ll probably work with some other names as well, I just haven&apos;t found out who they are yet. It&apos;s a long march back to September, and I&apos;m sure there will be plenty of adventures along the way. I&apos;ll keep you posted.
Stay cool and enjoy the last throes of Summer!

 The Rising (Bruce Springsteen) 
Posted on 07/26/2006 at 06:38 AM
I am right where I think I should be.
I&apos;m perched in front of my laptop, up hours before I rightfully should, listening to a Springsteen CD while my wife and daughter sleep. The only thing I&apos;m missing is a bottle of whiskey and a small rocks glass filled with melting ice, but adult onset diabetes took care of that a couple of years ago.
My cat is looking at me with his one good eye; he&apos;s seen me burn the midnight oil before, typing at the keyboard and sweating despite the wobbly ceiling fan.
I haven&apos;t written for a week; I&apos;ve been busy bangin&apos; the bongos, trying to fill in comedy work for September and beyond. The upside of the summer and having my mother in town was the downside of not really having any &quot;office time&quot; to make the phone calls and book work. This sort of thing happened to me a couple of years ago; I worked so much in September, October, November and December that I didn&apos;t make any phone calls, and I starved in January and February.
The good news is that I filled in my September, and October seems to be taking care of itself. The bad news is that I&apos;m getting some attitude from my lovely wife because the work will carry me away for two and a half weeks. I&apos;ve managed to route the work so that I will head off to the prairies for a couple of weeks, and I&apos;ll be able to lodge myself on the off nights for free or discounted rates through hotels that I have arrangements with, so travel will not take the normal big bite out of the money that it normally does. My wife is hearing none of it, and demands that I either cancel the work or prepare to take her and Harmony with me. Well, that&apos;s not going to happen, especially after a long road trip to Florida (which they will accompany me on). My wife doesn&apos;t have a very good track record for just getting up and getting in the car for a long drive, much less with a little peanut baby that has to be fed and diapered with inconvenient frequency. For the Florida trip, I picture my head exploding somewhere around the fourth day, and we don&apos;t arrive at my father&apos;s until the fifth. Oh well....I&apos;ll burn that bridge when I come to it.
Last week was an interesting one; the second night at the Cleveland Improv, the mc seemed tobe struggling a bit, and Mark, the manager, came over to me and said &quot;It&apos;s up to you to get them back.&quot; I went up and did a good, high-energy set, and it was pretty blue, to be honest, but it did the job. I got a good amount of praise from the staff, who enjoyed me. I&apos;m looking forward to going back in August and doing a not so dirty set, really showing off what I can do.
The couch at the Improv condo was relentless, and I wound up waking a couple of hours before my alarm. We had jury-rigged a covering over the window so that the 5:30 sunrise wouldn&apos;t have woken me early, but come to find out it didn&apos;t make much difference. Mike Dambra, my travelling partner for the week, woke up on time, we grabbed showers and packed out our suitcases and scrammed for Grand Rapids. I was pretty beat, but the drive wasn&apos;t very long and with the help of some energy drinks and a Burger King breakfast, we made it to the hotel around 2:00.
We had trouble checking in as the club was under new management, and the new people forgot to make reservations for us. A quick phone call to the booking agent set the cogs in motion, and we were able to get rooms, but Mike&apos;s room already had someone in it! Needless to say, he wasn&apos;t pleased. Mike can get pretty cranky with stuff like that, whereas I try to roll with the punches, although I definitely have my days, so I&apos;m not going to say that I&apos;m perfect, either.
Well, gentle reader, once we got the hotel thing situated, we went out to grab some lunch, and then hit a used CD store (where I bought the Springsteen CD I&apos;m listening to), and then it was back to the hotel for a nap. Long story short, I take a medication called Metformin to counter the sugar in my blood and my body&apos;s reluctance to produce insulin. I must have screwed up and taken it both before and after lunch, because the effects I experienced later were anything but typical.
It was open mic night at Dr. Grins, and the plan was for eight open mic comics to go up before myself and Mike, along with an mc. I felt fine until it was my turn, and when I hit the stage, all the energy rushed out of my body. I felt tired and started doing my act, although very slowly, and couldn&apos;t seem to get back to my regular pace. At one point, my knees buckled. I didn&apos;t know it at the time, but I was suffering from low blood sugar.
I finished, and even though it was a good show, it could have been way better. Mike and I stopped off at a Meijer&apos;s to get some ones and twos items, and I lost him in the store. I had him paged and had a babbling conversation with the front end clerk, who I don&apos;t think knew what to make of me, but she was polite nonetheless. Mike and I wound up getting food at Wendy&apos;s, and headed back to the hotel. Two hours after eating, I checked my blood and found my sugar level (which should have been elevated by the food) to be about 85...normal for me rides somewhere around 120. I can&apos;t even imagine how low it was when I was on stage! The worst part of it was that I drove all the way to the club and hung out for the first 40 minutes of the show and felt fine, and then BAM, I was a mess.
The next morning, Mike had radio, which I declined, and I guess he told the story of chasing me through Meijers, and all the jocks wanted to do was call my cell phone and destroy me on the radio. I was a little pissed off by that...I don&apos;t want any special treatment, but I think not hanging me out to dry on a syndicated radio show is the least I could ask. I&apos;m not the best at receiving the ball-busting, so I guess I&apos;m lucky that Mike didn&apos;t give them my name; it definitely could have turned ugly.
Friday&apos;s show was worlds better, as I was more stable. I even managed a 30-minute excercise session after lunch, hiking along while watching Israeli bombs obliterating Arab targets on CNN. I did well, even though I only got 20 minutes, but sold some CDs and DVDs after the show.
Saturday, Mike had a guest come in, a girl he was pen-pals with for the last 30 years. We got to the club early, which is in a big warehouse facility with multiple nightclubs and restaurants all in one. I told Mike I was going to grab a table in the Italian restaurant so that he could meet up with his friend and her husband without my interruption.
I sat at my table way in the back by the windows, and made some phone calls and sipped a Diet Coke. After a while, I noticed a presence off to my side, and I looked up to see a man and woman smiling at me, just standing there. I didn&apos;t know if they were guests from one of the previous nights&apos; shows, but they definitely seemed to know who I was, and I sheepishly said &quot;hello&quot;and waited for them to announce themselves. The girl said &quot;Mike?&quot; and I realized that it was Dambra&apos;s friends, and they must have asked the maitre&apos;d if there was a comedian holding a table. There was, but it wasn&apos;t the one they were looking for! I called Mike on my cell phone, and we all wound up having dinner together anyway.
Mike&apos;s friends were very nice, and they stayed for the show, and when I did the pre-show announcement on the offstage mic (I helped out in that capacity all weekend), I added little nuances like &quot;Welcome to the Mike Dambra show!&quot; to impress his guests. Mike isn&apos;t very good at self-promotion, and even at dinner when he told a story about how he met Pamela Anderson in Toronto at the Canadian comedy walk of fame ceremonies, he blew it off like he was telling someone he had lunch with me. I wanted to spice things up a bit, which come to find out, really wasn&apos;t necessary, because his friends were duly impressed regardless.
We did the second show and then drove home overnight, an 8-hour trip through Canada that I&apos;ve done more times than I can count, and the driving was easy until a truck-stop breakfast sandwich and three shots of Tequila caught up with Mike, and he almost crapped himself at a rest area at Ingersoll, east of London, Ontario. I waited dutifully while he evacuated his bowels and chuckled a little as each guest entered and quickly exited the washroom...it was pretty funny. I&apos;ve been there, and it&apos;s no fun, and I felt that karma had vindicated me over the Meijer&apos;s story. We laughed almost all the way to the border. The driving was hellacious, with thick fog (the product of hot days and cold nights) obscuring my sight until the morning sun started burning it away.
This week, Mike and I are co-headlining at the Comix Cafe in Rochester, our home club. I was supposed to be headlining the show, but Mike was unemployed so I took a pay cut and we bumped the middle act. It should be a fun time; Mike draws really well in Rochester, whereas I used to run the joint, so everyone&apos;s seen me a hundred times. I&apos;ll bring out the new stuff, do some political, and just generally use the time to have some fun on a stage that&apos;s like a second home to me. The following week, I&apos;ll be there again, just on the weekend, opening for Aries Spears, which should be a nice &quot;close to home&quot; gig before the big Florida trip.
O.K., I&apos;ve written enough. I&apos;m heading back to sleep, and if anything exciting happens, I&apos;ll let you know.
Have a great week, and remember, food BEFORE booze!

 Working For The Weekend (Loverboy) 
Posted on 07/19/2006 at 12:30 PM
It was a hard night on the couch here in the condo of the Cleveland Improv. I&apos;m travelling with headliner Mike Dambra (www.myspace.com/picklesplace) and we&apos;re joined by old Rochester standby Jeremy Schachter (www.myspace.com/standupjeremy) . Mike and I play Grand Rapids, Michigan on Thursday, but he had two nights of headlining at the Improv, so I tagged along, looking to do a showcase spot or two.
We made it to the club and picked up keys to the condo, which is only a short walk across the parking lot, and hooked up with J-Shack at the condo. We caught up on gossip, stories and the like, and then got changed into our show clothes and headed over to the club.
Mario, the club manager, graciously offered me a guest spot, which I enthusiastically accepted. I had showcased for Mario many moons ago, but never quite caught up with him on the phone or e-mail to schedule work. Finally, a month or two ago, I scheduled some work in September. I still wanted to go up and do a spot, just to keep myself fresh in everyone&apos;s mind. Also, the spot I did way back when was mottled with hecklers and really didn&apos;t allow me to show off my set in it&apos;s best light.
Well, long story short, the show went great, and I wound up getting some more work out of the deal. The wisdom is true, if you want to be a comedian, go perform in comedy clubs. I sometimes poo-poo the notion of doing unpaid spots because I&apos;ve got a family to support and I really can&apos;t just pick up and go work for free, but this instance showed that sometimes you have to bite the bullet and go show the decision-makers what you&apos;ve got. I&apos;m glad I did it, and that circumstances allowed me to do so. It&apos;s gonna be a little rough surviving on what little money I&apos;ve got (only did one one-nighter last week) and I&apos;m not looking at any real pay until Saturday night, unless merchandise sales save my ass Thursday or Friday, but I should be o.k.
In other news, the comedy wheel keeps spinning around; I lost a weekend in August down in Johnson City, Tennesee, but I picked up a full week inSeptember in North Dakota and Minnesota. So, net/net, I&apos;m up for the day. Still, it was pretty demoralizing to lose work right out of the gate, and then have it &quot;replaced&quot; a few hours later. No wonder I have high blood pressure!
I&apos;m surprised I slept at all last night. Young Jeremy, Michael and I stayed up and talked comedy business until 2:00 in the morning. I think we all would have talked longer (well, Shachter and I would have), but we ran out of gas. I slept on the wretched condo sofa, staring out the untreated factory-style window of the condo, looking out onto the Cleveland &quot;Flats&quot; and the lights of the western part of the city, knowing full well that the morning sun was going to wake me long before I was ready for waking.
It did.
I remedied the situation by turning my face toward the back of the couch, putting the thought of all the asses that have parked there out of my mind, and woke a few hours later after the sun had risen and baked me to perfection. I was so hot I woke up! Tonight, I&apos;m going to definitely try to tack up a sheet or something to cover that window, because I&apos;ve got driving to do Thursday morning, and I&apos;m not interested in doing it on 4 hours of sleep.
Here&apos;s hoping your week is restful and cool.

 Superman (R.E.M.) 
Posted on 07/14/2006 at 05:13 PM
UPDATED***UPDATED***UPDATED***UPDATED***UPDATED
Pammie had work yesterday and I didn&apos;t, so I watched Harmony for most of the day. That little girl is pretty amazing. Mama Davis watched her while I took Pam&apos;s car into the shop, and I had a good 3-hour-plus wait, so I ambled on over to the theater and caught &quot;Superman Returns.&quot;
I&apos;m not going to bore you with my prognosis of the film, suffice to say that I describe it as the story of a guy who needs a blood transfusion, and the only person who has his same rare blood type is his long-lost brother, and he lives, and I go through a long dissertation of how they find the brother, but there&apos;s no surprise, because you know it&apos;s gonna be the brother. And I take over two and half hours to tell you this.
What disturbed me about the film, though, is the centerpiece; an article written by Lois Lane after Superman&apos;s disappearance titled &quot;Why The World Doesn&apos;t Need Superman.&quot; It&apos;s an obvious grudge piece written by a dumped female after a &quot;love &apos;em and leave &apos;em&quot; soiree with the Man of Steel, and she supposedly wins a Pulitzer Prize for her efforts.
The mangling of the Superman mythology is contemptible, to say the least, and this article is the unkindest cut of all.
I am a comic book collector and fan, which means I&apos;ve spent no small amount of my life studying this stuff. I love the characters, and have for 30 years or more, and as an adult, the love has changed from childish hero worship to something different. It may be hard to explain, but I&apos;m going to make an effort if you&apos;ll allow me.
Superman was created back in the 30&apos;s, 1938 to be exact, just after the Great Depression, by a couple of Jewish kids, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Marvelous storytellers, the Jews, that they concocted a story that has survived almost 70 years and become the most repeated tale in the world. Superman is Kal-El, son of Jor-El, a respected scientist on the planet Krypton, a world revolving around a red sun, with heavier gravity than ours on Earth. After years of polluting their planet, forces at the world&apos;s core threatened the destruction and explosion of the planet Krypton, and Jor-El&apos;s warnings go unheaded by the mass populace.
Jor-El, realizing that his world and people are doomed, loads his infant son into a rocket ship and launches him into space. Krypton explodes, the remnants of the world becoming Kryptonite, a radioactive substance that is the only thing Superman is powerless against. The rocket ship lands in a Kansas cornfield, and Kal-El is found by a couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent. They raise him as their own, and as the child grows, they learn that he has powers and abilities much different from any Earthman.
Being good midwestern folk, Jonathan and Martha instill Kal-El with good Christian values (they were probably Lutheran, based on surnames and where they lived), and explained that he needed to defend the weak, to look out for others who couldn&apos;t defend themselves.
Coming off the Depression, you can imagine that there were a lot of folks who felt like a guy like Superman would have been pretty handy, and the character&apos;s popularity soared. During the Second World War, Superman suited up and fought the Nazis, more so than bank robbers or mad scientists, and he looked up from his four-color pages and implored folks to recycle, buy war bonds, and support the war effort.
Superman continues to exist, preaching a lesson by example of the virtues of doing good for the sake of it, looking out for the weak, the lesser abled, and standing as a bastion of truth, justice and the American way.
That Superman has been compared to Jesus, a savior, is no mistake. The movie makes that parallel, and the topic has been discussed over and over. The comparison of a father sending his only son to Earth to help is cut and dried, with no extension of supposition, and all the more interesting in light of his creators&apos; Jewish background.
Superman spawned a pantheon of heroes, many of whom have graced the silver and small screen; Batman, Daredevil, Spiderman, Wonder Woman, The Hulk, The Fantastic Four, The Punisher and more. Times always contain plenty of trouble, trouble enough that us &quot;normal&quot; human folk could use heroes to look up to, to inspire us, to give us hope.
The simple fact of the matter, is that they don&apos;t exist; I&apos;ve always wondered why not, with the technology we have in place, a Batman or an Iron Man would be possible, if not probable. But what we do have are heroes of a more garden variety. Our policemen, firefighters, military personnel, doctors, scientists who toil to eliminate disease, teachers andchild care people, and the list goes on and on.
We also have a list of villains in the world, and while they aren&apos;t as flashy as The Joker, Green Goblin, Dr. Doom or Lex Luthor, they are just as dangerous and need to be taken down. The list is sickening to consider, but must be exposed, must be talked about; evil can only flourish in the dark...it cannot stand the light.
How about this for starters? Anyone who preys on children, sexual predators, child pornographers, manufacturers of unhealthy food marketed to children, companies that poison the air and water, companies that don&apos;t provide healthy work conditions for their workers, companies that price gouge for necessities of life like medicine or gasoline, companies that move jobs to foreign countries and put American workers on the welfare roles while paying those foreign nationals a starvation wage? I&apos;ll raise you crooked politicians, crooked cops, and that guy from &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; who gets young drunk girls to act like whores, and anyone who works for him. For good measure, I&apos;ll throw in anyone who lies for personal gain, companies who sell products that promise weight loss, hair growth or penile enlargement, products that usually come in capsule form, and prey on the hopes of our vanities. I&apos;ll end my list (but the list doesn&apos;t end here) with warmongers, companies who profit from war and encourage it, people who fight rather than use diplomacy, hate based on religious or national tradition, and anyone who looks the other way when obvious injustices occur. And people who exploit or neglect the aged.
I&apos;d rather fight Captain Cold, Braniac, The Sandman and Kraven the Hunter single-handedly than stand by and let these pieces of human garbage continue to torment us and make our world a lesser place to live.
These villains sometime seem unapproachable, and one man who can&apos;t fly, deflect bullets and see through solid walls can feel that he has no hope in defeating them. But all it takes for evil to flourish in the world is for good people to do nothing.
It&apos;s hard to take up an activist&apos;s turn at the wheel, with regular life to contend with. We all have to pay bills, tend to our families, and in hard times, run as fast as we can to stay in the same place. There isn&apos;t time to take up arms, and all we can do is pray that good will finally vanquish evil. We vote our conscience, use our dollars to support businesses that do the right thing, recycle, and try to live lives of moral consequence. That should be enough, if everyone were participating.
The trick is to shake off the hypnosis that we are powerless, that we weren&apos;t imbued by our Creator with great powers and that we can&apos;t make a difference. Everyone is talented, in some area, and the use of that talent (or not) can make all the difference in the world. We need to be inspired to use those talents, to take up arms in the face of reckless odds, to decide to make a difference and to be Supermen and Wonder Women, to fight evil and make a difference.
We need Superman, now more than ever. And we need him to be us. I am thankful that those heroes exist, to remind me and inspire me to be greater than I am.
How about you?

Summertime Blues (the Who)
07/14/2006
05:13 PM

It&apos;s unavoidable...summertime cancellations. I&apos;ve been very lucky the past few years, booking more or less &quot;sure shot&quot; clubs for the summer, because it&apos;s much easier to replace fallouts in the colder seasons, but this year, the chips just fell the way they did.
I was supposed to be performing at Cozzy&apos;s in Newport News, Virginia this weekend, but a double-booking accident (not on my part) left me out in the cold. I was looking forward to going back to Cozzy&apos;s, because the last time I was there, a massive car accident on I-95 kept me from making the Friday show until just a few minutes after the show ended, breaking a years-long string I had going of always making it to the show. I worked the two Saturday shows, and in an amazing show of charity and good will, Lorraine Cosgrave, the owner of the club, awarded me full pay for the weekend. Never you mind that she had to pay for a substitute to fill in for me on Friday; I tried giving the money back, but she wasn&apos;t having it.
I&apos;d been calling the club since about 5:30 in the afternoon, warning that I didn&apos;t think I was going to make it, since traffic was at a stand-still coming out of D.C....come to find out, there was a terrible accident on I-95, and they were closing the southbound lane (my lane, to be precise) to land medivac helicopters. I had to drive all the way back into D.C. and take an alternate route to I-95 to bypass the accident, and by then it was just way too late.
I&apos;ve been wanting to get back to the club to get the monkey off my back; I haven&apos;t been able to secure a rebooking in over a year, and I&apos;m confident that it&apos;s fallout from my last engagement. I hate having stuff like that hanging over my head, particularly when it&apos;s stuff I have no control over. The previous time I played the club, I did great and got a bonus, so I always held on to the possibility that I just wasn&apos;t aggressive enough about securing a rebooking, but comics aren&apos;t famous for toting around bags of self-confidence.
So, I guess the monkey is going to stay put, and I&apos;ll have to put this weekend to other use. I got some stage time in the form of an American Diabetes Association benefit last night with longtime comedy buddies Danny Liberto and Tiny Glover. The event was coordinated by Julie Donofrio, a student of the three of ours from back when we taught a comedy class together, and she also performed. The crowd wasn&apos;t very big, but the room wasn&apos;t big either, and we raised a few hundred bucks for the cause. It was certainly better than sitting around and not performing, given the cancellation for the weekend.
I&apos;m looking forward to next week, with performances at both the Cleveland Improv and Dr. Grins in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It&apos;s a good long road week before a headlining stint at my home club in Rochester, and then a little rest before my annual Florida summer tour.
I may try to book some work for the winter, if the conflict in the Middle East doesn&apos;t blow up the world first.
Have a great weekend.

 Vacation (The Go Go&apos;s) 
Posted on 07/10/2006 at 09:31 AM
What a summer so far. I usually just try to keep working through the summer, no mean feat in comedy, but this year, I decided to let the chips fall where they may and maybe enjoy some leisure time for a change.
I always considered the concept of &quot;leisure time&quot; as more important to the regular working slobs of the world...the folks who wake to an alarm clock, have to juggle their dayrunners to make afternoon doctor&apos;s appointments, and expect to eat dinner at the same time every day and then unwind with three to four hours of T.V. at night.
You know, losers.
I guess after 50 weeks of that horseshit, you would need two weeks off to go load up a camper and go sit by a lake or a river, or whatever mosquito farm is most relevant to that kind of activity. And when you get back home from your two weeks away, you need a vacation week just to re-adjust, to get back into the swing of things, and Monday morning comes down like Thor&apos;s hammer.
You can have it.
I wake up whenever the hell I wake up, and then go do whatever it is I want. My job *is* a vacation, and I go wherever I please. If I want to see the nation&apos;s capitol, I schedule work near Washington. If I want to see the country, I book gigs in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. If I want to go to Mardi Gras, I book shows near New Orleans. I don&apos;t need a vacation from my job, and I look at everyone else as suckers. I remember seeing an interview with Eddie Murphy years ago, and he said &quot;Find a job that you love, and you&apos;ll never have to go to work.&quot;
Friday night, my mom accompanied me to Brashers Falls, NY (it&apos;s pronounced BRAY-Shers, I found out) and the Northern Lights Night Club where I was performing with Carol Pennington, head cheese over at Hysterical Management in Cleveland, Ohio. It was a nice day for a drive through Northern New York, resplendent with all the cowshit you could smell. Whether it was fertilizer or the smell of livestock, in some places, the scent was so strong, it changed the flavor of my drink.
The show was well-attended, with about 170 people from various towns around the county, and I had a really good show; so good, in fact, that Carol announced to me offstage, and then during her set on stage, that I was being moved up to close. It&apos;s a big deal for me, as I&apos;m making baby steps toward becoming a full-fledged headliner, and I like the fact that it&apos;s happening this way, good and organic, rather than me pushing or promoting myself. I believe in letting my work do the talking and let the booking agents make the decision for themselves. I have no lack of confidence in my abilities, but I understand that different agents have different standards, and I want them to be comfortable with their decision to move me up. If I have nothing else, I have patience, and it&apos;s beginning to pay off.
Saturday, we did the social butterfly thing, making appearances at our friend Maria&apos;s son&apos;s birthday party, and then off to the Annette Lorenzo estate to celebrate the graduation of her daughter, Krystal. Everything was great until Harmony did the &quot;cranky two-year-old&quot; thing and we had to split, but that ate up most of the day. We headed home, and everyone took a nap but me. I decided to head down to the Comix Cafe, my home club, and catch the late show. I wasn&apos;t planning on doing a guest set, but dressed appropriately, and the first thing they said to me when I walked in was, &quot;Wanna do a guest set?&quot;
I grabbed a few minutes of stage time and hung out with Danny Liberto, Joel Lindley and Pat Duffy, the comics on the bill this week. The crowd was typical summer stuff, lots of young kids and not a full house, but we had fun with them. I stayed until a kid from the audience started challenging me in the bar, telling me (in Drunkenese) that he was funnier than me, and that if he stood side-by-side with me on the stage, he could be funnier than me. Somewhere in the challenge, he dropped his beer and lost all of it, and that&apos;s pretty much when I told him I would fuck his mother in front of him and wipe my dick off on his face. I have no tolerance for drunks, especially of the part-time comic variety.
Sunday was a nice cookout at my brother&apos;s house in Syracuse, celebrating his 38th birthday, and the last chance for mom to see her grandkids before heading back to Florida. We had a nice time and the weather held up fine, and then it was back home to wind things up from Mom&apos;s visit, get her time to pack, and get a good night&apos;s sleep before getting her off to the airport this morning. It wasn&apos;t so much a tear-stained goodbye, as we&apos;ll be seeing her in just a few weeks when Pam, Harmony and I make our way down to Florida for a few weeks of work I&apos;ve scheduled down there. It&apos;ll be nice, because Dad hasn&apos;t seen the baby yet, and she&apos;s almost 2 1/2, so it&apos;s high time that I made the introduction.
This week, I&apos;ve got a good slate of comedy on the schedule...a Diabetes fundraiser on Thursday, and then Friday and Saturday at Cozzy&apos;s comedy club in Newport News, Virginia. Cozzy&apos;s is a neat little weekend room, and it&apos;s always a fun time. The fact that I&apos;m working with my good friend Mike Dambra is just a bonus. I get to work with Mike the week after, as well, with a couple of days at the Cleveland Improv before heading to Grand Rapids, Michigan and a three-day stand at Dr. Grin&apos;s. Then it&apos;s a full week of headlining shows at the Comix Cafe in Rochester, a week I&apos;m very excited about, and the Saturday afternoon is a bonus, because I&apos;ll be attending Steve Natarelli&apos;s Redneck Luau. I get to work *and* have a social life!
God, I love my job!

 Road to Rhode Island (Brian and Stewie Griffin) 
Posted on 07/03/2006 at 01:53 PM
Happy early 4th of July, everyone, and to my non-American friends, Happy 4th of July to you, too! I hurt all over today, and that&apos;s usually the sign of a fun weekend when you&apos;re close to 40.
Headliner Joel Lindley and I had two shows Saturday night, and we planned on driving home overnight so that we could attend family functions on Sunday, so we packed up the car and checked out of the hotel and headed over to the Lincoln Park Casino, home of Catch A Rising Star, in anticipation of our two shows. There was a problem, though, when we missed our exit and wound up nowhere near where we wanted to be...we knew were in trouble when we saw the sign &quot;Welcome to Massachusetts.&quot; We turned around and made it to the casino, and I got into the showroom just a few minutes after the mc, Frank O&apos;Donnell, had taken the stage.
The first show was a catastrophe, a small crowd filled with old people who really had no interest in seeing comedy unless we were Red Skelton or Abbott and Costello. I wound up speaking to a middle-aged couple who were pleased as punch that I was from Rochester, NY, because their daughter was a lawyer in Rochester. It was like an old people&apos;s luncheon, where everyone politely listened to you until it was their turn to brag about their children and grandchildren.
Second show was better, and I broke my merchandise drought. I got good reviews from Jim, the club manager, who promised to bring me back in a better-attended week. After the show, Joel and I changed into driving clothes and hit the road. The club paid me by check, which I never enjoy, but it was a Bank of America check, and there are branches here in Rochester, so I&apos;m gonna cash that puppy today. It almost left me a little cash-strapped, and Joel and I had worked it out where he was paying for the gas and tolls on the way in, and I was responsible on the way back. After buying a Snapple at a rest stop on the New York State Thruway and covering my gas and toll obligations, I returned home with exactly one dollar in my pocket. Cash is the road comic&apos;s friend!
Joel Lindley gets the &quot;Ralph Tetta Ironman Driving award&quot; for making the entire 6-hour drive without so much as a yawn. We listened to the Howard Stern channel on Sirius the whole way, taking short breaks to listen to Art Bell. Stern had a guest on named &quot;High Pitched Mike&quot; who was going to allow a man who had a sex-change operation into a woman sit on his face for a minute and ten seconds in return for a 60-inch TV. I almost threw up into my hands just listening to it. I was never a big Howard Stern fan, but I understand the attraction.
We rolled into Rochester around 5 AM, and I transferred my luggage to my car and got home and in bed by just a little after 6. My wife let me sleep in a little, but I had to get up and go purchase picnic supplies. I loaded a cart with burgers, hots, chips, charcoal, lighter fluid, ice and condiments and headed out to the Oatka Creek Lodge, where we have picniced for the last couple of years. We had a great turnout, with local comics Mike Dambra, Dan Liberto, Steve Natarelli and Annette Lorenzo in attendance. We even had an appearance from my old boss, Ed Bebko, who brought his mother Stella to the festivities. It was a great day filled with food and fun, and my daughter Harmony got to pet some horses, courtesy of some riders from the area who happened by. Harmony ran and ran and ran, and collapsed for a little nap. By that time, I&apos;d grilled dozens of burgers and hots, played a round of bocce with the comics (Natarelli and I lost to the Dambra/Liberto team 21-15), and I was ready for a nap myself.
I have most of this week off, with only a couple of social engagements to keep me from just laying in bed, and one gig Friday night up in Brashers Falls, New York, which will also keep me from being broke. My mom heads back to Florida in a week, so we&apos;ll have some family fun days, going to the park with the baby and enjoying the Summer, something I never put much value in, but as I&apos;ve aged, I&apos;ve started to understand the importance.
Have a great week, play safely if you&apos;re using firecrackers or fireworks, and enjoy the Summer!

 Hot Water (Level 42) 
Posted on 07/01/2006 at 11:01 AM
Good morning from Providence, Rhode Island. I&apos;m in the Ocean State, and have so far made no Peter Griffin sightings, although I might actually be turning some heads in that respect...the first day I was here, I wore a white shirt and green pants, but couldn&apos;t pull off the &quot;chin dimple&quot; thing.
I&apos;m working at Catch A Rising Star, which is located in the Lincoln Park Casino, with headliner Joel Lindley. Joel is best known for his appearances on Conan O&apos;Brien and the Bob and Tom radio program, where they play his phone prank CD. We made it here from Rochester (where we both currently live) in just under six hours, and we did one show Thursday night and one show last night. The Thursday show was pretty weak, but we didn&apos;t expect 4th of July attendance to be very good, anyway. The show was hosted by a local guy who won an open mic contest, so he was doing mostly material rather than &quot;crowd warmup&quot; stuff. I delivered my feature set in a mostly conversational style to pick up the slack from that, and kept it relatively clean as not to offend the older folks in attendance. It went well, but merchandise sales were nil, because casino audiences don&apos;t buy souvenirs. It&apos;s usually the losers who show up to the show, the winners are still in the casino, gambling away. Also, older people don&apos;t have CD players, or they have no desire to use the one that came with the car they bought and never drive.
Last night&apos;s show, we had Frank O&apos;Donnell, a comedy professional, as our mc, and it made a big difference. He ran into a wall, though, when a 60-year-old woman (celebrating her birthday) interrupted his show and told him &quot;I don&apos;t like the &apos;F&apos; word.&quot; It totally changed the rhythm of the show, and I used the word, although in a different way. Wheras I swear a lot in my normal everyday speech, I edited out the times when &quot;fuck&quot; was unnecessary. Sometimes, it has to stay in to preserve the rhythm of the joke. At the end of the show, Ann (her name) and the rest of her group stayed a while to talk to Joel and myself, and she complimented me that I didn&apos;t swear. Her daughter corrected her that I did,indeed, swear, but she opined that because I wasn&apos;t crass, it wasn&apos;t as objectionable. Perception is reality, kids...learn it and love it.
I goose-egged on product again, but got a little free nosh courtesy of the Courtyard Marriot, our lodging for the weekend. I have a room on the third floor which for some reason has no cold water running to it. And I don&apos;t mean that you turn the cold water on and nothing happens....I mean, you turn on the cold water and get hot water, and when you turn on the hot water, you get water so hot you could sterilize surgical implements. It&apos;s not a big inconvenience, except in the shower where I like to rinse off with tepid water, rather than water so hot it changes my complexion. I mentioned it to the manager at the desk before I left for the show, and when I returned, he said that they got the sink fixed, but the shower situation wasn&apos;t straightened out. I had intended on purchasing a Philly Steak hot pocket and a diet Sierra Mist from the little pantry/gift shop they had in the lobby, and for my trouble, he allowed me the items complimentary. It was a nice, customer-service and friendly gesture.
Tonight, we have two shows, and then we motor back to Rochester, arriving sometime in the morning, and I need to get a little shut-eye to prepare for the big picnic out at Oatka Creek Lodge. If you&apos;re reading this and didn&apos;t recieve an invitation for whatever reason, you&apos;re still invited, so call me for directions and I&apos;ll get you there. It should be big fun, as it is every year, and I&apos;ll be sacrificing hamburgers and hotdogs on a charcoal grill to the gods of Summer.
And far be it for me to close out this entry without wishing a congratulations to Carol Pennington of Hysterical Management in Cleveland, Ohio, who is getting married on July 4th. I&apos;ll be working with her in Brashers Falls, NY this week, which should be her honeymoon week by any account, and we should have a fun time of it.
I hope to see you at the picnic tomorrow, and if not, you&apos;ll still be in my thoughts. Have a great weekend!

 Four Horsemen (The Clash) 
Posted on 06/27/2006 at 02:13 AM
Good morning and Happy Tuesday! My weekend starts today! I have a whole two days off before the big Ralph Tetta comedy tour rollercoaster takes off again, this week, to Providence, Rhode Island. I&apos;m looking forward to it, but tomorrow is just going to be a laundry day and lounging around with the family (or as much lounging as I can get away with).
Saturday, I finished my weekend with Jamie Lissow and Steve Burr at the Comix Cafe in Rochester, and my mom, fresh off the plane, was in attendance. I had fun, but I haven&apos;t mc&apos;ed in so long, it was like doing a stairmaster to keep running up on stage. Three steps every 30-45 minutes....my heart was *pounding*!
Sunday, I piled mom and Pam and Harmony into the car, and we headed east to Syracuse to have a nice day off with my brother and his family. The kids were great, and Amy put on a nice dinner...we had fresh fruit salad, and grilled chicken &apos;n&apos; vegetables, and the time whisked by while I watched my niece Olivia take my daughter all around the backyard, playing on swings, playing with toys, and just generally letting her enjoy the company of a small person for a change. It was really nice, but by the time we got back to Rochester, I was whupped.
This morning, after a fruitless attempt to get 7 hours of sleep or so, I settled for two 1 1/2 hour &quot;naps&quot; and got up at 6 A.M. to shower, dress, and pick up Steve Burr to go do a radio promotion of our show, &quot;3 Things You Never Talk About.&quot; We were guests on the Brother Wease show on 96.5 WCMF for about an hour, and they gave us ample time to explain what the show was, that it was a demo for Sirius Sattelite Radio, and that it was a talk show format, but that it would be funny. We had about 125 folks out to the club tonight, and it turned out being a great experience.
The only problem on my end was that after doing the radio show, I volunteered to help Steve set up the sound system, stage, and run around replacing hardware that was sold under the false pretenses that it worked and was in good repair. By the time we completed our task and I dropped Steve off, I was looking at another 1 1/2 hour nap before I had to get up and get cleaned up and dressed again. I sucked down two cans of sugar-free Red Bull, and decided that was as close as I was going to get to my missing 6 hours of sleep.
Mom came along to see the show tonight, and it was actually very good despite some fears and reservations on the parts of our participants. Joel Lindley, who I am working with this week in Rhode Island, didn&apos;t show until just a little bit before showtime, which caused some nerves and begged the question of which of the comics in attendance who came just to watch were going to be pressed into service.
Rich Aronovitch, the headliner this week, did a warm-up spot, along with Mike Glosek, one of the Comix Cafe&apos;s in-house comics, and we got rolling. Steve was our host and moderator, and the panel included Mike &quot;Pickle&quot; Dambra, myself, Jamie Lissow and Joel Lindley. We started things off with a discussion of politics, and we were too politcal but not funny right out of the gate, and the audience told us so. Once we got our bearings, we started doing one-liners, taking audience questions and moving things along, and we got a good amount of laughs, many aimed at my ample girth. You could say the laughter was at the expense of my expanse. Ha Ha. During the show, someone bought the panel a round of shots, and I chased mine with a beer...the first alcohol I&apos;ve had in several months. Needless to say, the alcohol loosened the screws at the back of my tongue, and I said some things that were funny but that I&apos;m not proud of. As long as it sounds good on the tape, I guess. Also, Mark Wiedmann did a great job as the audience guy with the wireless mic, taking questions and being the butt of the &quot;old&quot; jokes just like I was the butt of the &quot;fat&quot; jokes.
Somewhere along the line, I think I&apos;m going to have to get some sleep, but damn that Red Bull, it&apos;s making my eyelids twitch.

 Predictable (The Kinks) 
Posted on 06/24/2006 at 02:29 PM
Good afternoon from the Flower City, Rochester, NY! It&apos;s the first Saturday that I&apos;ve slept in my own bed since I can remember...O.K., I&apos;m over-romanticizing it...I worked Buffalo three weeks ago, and slept in my own bed every night, but work with me here; I usually don&apos;t. We had two excellent shows last night at the Comix Cafe here in Rochester with headliner Jamie Lissow and headliner-turned feature for the week Steve Burr and myself ably and willingly filling out the m.c. spot. I&apos;ve mc&apos;ed that club a thousand times if I&apos;ve done it once, and I eased into it like an old suit. Instead of trying to spritz the crowd and work the room, I just did a standard &quot;opening&quot; set both shows, did the announcements, and brought the other two guys on stage. I laid out mostly new material, because my attitude was that after playing my home club so much, everyone&apos;s heard my core material five times or more. I went mostly political, and it flew pretty well, and I even sold merchandise out of the m.c. spot...pretty much unheard of for me up until this weekend.
Jamie had a college gig to do between shows, which meant Steve and I had to stretch the second show a little until he got back, which was no problem...we both have headline sets of our own, and we padded it out with no discernible problems. Unfortunately, when Jamie hit the stage, he drew a heckler who just started making &quot;goat&quot; noises, and uncharacteristically, the club did nothing about it. Now, I&apos;m not bragging, but back in the day when I was running the place, we would have had that guy holding his bloody lip in the parking lot if he did the goat thing twice, but last night, security seemed a little...absent. Come to find out, one guy had the night off and there was only one manager on the floor, which explained the short-handedness, but the manager was MY bouncer when I was GM! I guess I would have expected more, but I&apos;m not going to speculate why nothing was done. There were actually two managers working in the club last night, and both of them know their jobs, so maybe there was some other distraction that I didn&apos;t know about. Still, the interruption left Jamie in a bad place, where he&apos;s being sabotaged during setups, and key points in his act, and when I came back into the showroom from the lounge, he was fed up enough where he told the guy he was about to kill him. There were another group of loud rowdies in the back giving him the business as well, and it&apos;s only Jamie&apos;s savvy and experience from working the road, clubs and colleges that kept him balanced and allowed him to still finish strong. Jamie&apos;s a talented comic, and I feel bad for the folks who came to the late show to see him, because they didn&apos;t get the full benefit of his performance. Friday late shows suck most everywhere you go.
Afterwards, Steve, Jamie and I hung out in the lounge and got to talking, just like old times, and V.J. Stanley, a student of mine, came in from his show in Buffalo and hung out for a bit. Other Rochester comedy alumni Matt Rohr and Ryan Kemp stopped in to pay their respects, as well as former showroom manager (and my right arm) Natalie Gould. It&apos;s always nice to see people I&apos;ve had close relationships with, because as Natalie pointed out to me, we used to see each other every day, and then suddenly, BAM, nothing! The road is a bitch inasmuch as that you only get to hang around with other comics, and usually comics you&apos;ve never met before, and while that can be cool, it&apos;s only a band-aid to socialization. Thank God I&apos;m married, or I&apos;d be constantly re-telling my backstory; Pamela is the only person I get to see on a regular basis, and she&apos;s heard all my stories twice (or more) so she knows where I&apos;m coming from.
Speaking of Pamela, I got yelled at last night, too. She&apos;s a crafter, and she had a show today in Syracuse, complete with a 7:30 A.M. departure time, and she was plenty mad that I didn&apos;t come right home after the second show. Seems that Harmony was having a &quot;cranky&quot; night and wasn&apos;t getting to sleep,and she was wide awake when I got home at about 3 A.M. I got her settled, playing Maisy blocks on the computer and reading to her on our brand-new sofa-bed that we had delivered yesterday, and by 4 or 4:30, she was out for the count.
Until about 10:30...then she started crying and howling at me. I changed her and gave her some grits and cheese and a few chocolate cookies (her favorite), and then we watched a little Charlie and Lola (British import cartoon from the Disney Channel) and she drifted right back to sleep. We&apos;re going in a couple of hours to pick up my mother from the airport; she&apos;s flying in from Florida and staying with us for a couple of weeks, and that should be fun. Depending on if she&apos;s tired from the flight, she may come with me to the club tonight-she hasn&apos;t seen me work in about a year, and I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll be glad that I&apos;ve replaced a lot of the smut in my act with some political material, although she and my father could give a crap about such things, whereas I&apos;m ready to start shooting politicians left and right everytime I read the paper.
Don&apos;t get me wrong...I support the troops. They come to my shows and buy CD&apos;s and DVD&apos;s to take over to Iraq!
Have a great weekend!

 Good Day Sunshine (The Beatles) 
Posted on 06/19/2006 at 02:06 PM
My schedule would KILL you dead!
I&apos;m home after an 18-hour jaunt across the United States, starting out in Sioux City, Iowa and ending in my driveway in Rochester, New York, only 1120 miles away. I rolled in at 4:00 in the morning, and was as awake and alert as I was when I got in the car 18 hours previous.
Thursday night was the gig in Brookings, South Dakota. The hotel was overrun with American Legion conventioneers; I never saw so many war wounds in my life. They were a pleasant bunch, partying it up and trading war stories, and I stayed in my hotel room as not to get trapped in conversation with one of them. Old people are nice in small doses, but they are the LaBrea Tar Pits of conversation. The show was well-attended, and I did well, entertaining the mostly college-aged folks with a slower-paced show than I usually put on. I like moving around and giving off the energy, but the portable stage was sort of unstable and I didn&apos;t feel comfortable moving around on it for fear the two segments would slide apart and I would do a fat-man split right down to the ground.
Friday, I had a radio interview in Sioux City, so I had to get peddling early. I stopped for gas in a small town called Dell Rapids, South Dakota, and upon heading into town, I saw a billboard that said, &quot;We Dakotans reject Animal Rights Organizations...Fur, Fish, Game and Livestock are our Economy!&quot;
Now, I&apos;m no animal rights activist...I definitely eat more than my share of the meat category, but my first response to this billboard was &quot;if you can&apos;t treat animals humanely, then do something else for a living.&quot; My second response was to locate the PETA sticker that my wife lovingly applied to the inside of my back windshield, and to peel it off and throw it away, lest I get my ass kicked in Dell Rapids, South Dakota, where such an event would never make the papers. I don&apos;t fight much, but I think in a one-on-one confrontation, I could probably hold my own, but I&apos;m not taking on a whole village of rednecks.
Friday night it rained so much, Sioux City actually set a record for rainfall. Manhole covers were floating away because storm drains were full, and several roads were impassable. Also, the Harley biker convention that was in town had a big shindig that was scheduled for the downtown area, and that got rained out. I thought for sure that the event would mean doomsday for our show, but we drew 150, and they were great. I got paid before I even hit the stage, and I had as good a set as I possibly could. There was an improv group that opened the show, along with our mc, Mandi Macy from the rock station in town. By the time I hit the stage, I was ready to go. I did some mild Bush-bashing, which actually evoked pretty good laughter, leading me to believe that Iowa isn&apos;t as red a state as I had been led to believe.
Saturday, things had cleared up, to the pleasure of the bikers, who had day 2 of their little festival to look forward to, and our show died on the vine. We had no improv troupe to warm up, just Mandi, who is cute as a button but did no time to get the crowd revved up, and my first 10-15 minutes on stage reflected that. I plowed forward with my act, but they just weren&apos;t buying it, so I switched gears and did some quasi-mc stuff, talking to a bacherlorette party and dove-tailing some material into the conversation. By the time I finished, I felt I had done well, but I wished I could get that first 15 minutes back. Ken Muller, the booking agent who hired me, showed up to say hello, shook my hand, and then headed out before I could talk to him at all, which I felt was unfortunate. I couldn&apos;t tell if he like my set or not, but he seemed pleasant, and ultimately, I&apos;ll know if he did or not by his response when I ask for work again.
This week I had the dubious pleasure of running over two turtles and a prairie dog, and when I say &quot;run over,&quot; I mean I aimed my car so the wheels went around them. I didn&apos;t kill anything, but I did run over the remains of a dead dear on route 90 in Ohio that had been liquified by a truck. I didn&apos;t even see it until it was too late, and it&apos;s a horrible feeling. Luckily, it piss rained all the way through Cleveland, so hopefully it washed any venison tartare off the vehicle that I may have picked up.
It rained like Biblical hard twice coming home, once in Indiana and then in Ohio. I felt like God Himself was telling me that I wasn&apos;t going to get home, that I should just pull the car over, put some stakes in the ground and start homesteading the divider between I-90 eastbound and westbound. I chewed the same piece of gum for almost 300 miles, and burned through a pack and a half of Extra Sugar-Free Peppermint, and today, my jaws are sore. That&apos;ll teach me to chew gum for 18 hours.
This week is a quiet one at home, and I&apos;m mc&apos;ing at my home club, the Comix Cafe. Also, I&apos;m doing a pilot episode for a new radio program called &quot;3 Things You Never Talk About&quot; on Monday. It&apos;s a panel-type program with comedians discussing the issues of the day. There&apos;s nothing I like more than warming the air with my opinions about the issues of the day. If you&apos;re in Rochester and want to attend, you can get information at www.3ThingsYouNeverTalkAbout.com. It&apos;ll be a nice break in the action, and while the pay for the week isn&apos;t going to be a living wage, my expenses will be low because I&apos;m home. I spent $277 on gas this past road trip, paying anywheres from $2.66 to $2.99 a gallon. Even with all that figured in, it was still a profitable week, and I can add the bragging rights that I&apos;ve added another state to my list of &quot;states performed in&quot;-South Dakota. And for the record, that makes 33 states total.
Missing Father&apos;s Day was a bummer, but I got a couple of nice Father&apos;s Day gifts that were waiting for me when I got home, including a beautiful book from my mother-in-law called &quot;Why A Daughter Needs A Dad.&quot; Maybe I was just tenderized from the long ride home, or whatever, but my guard was down and I read it in one sitting and cried and cried. This week, I&apos;m going to spend some high-quality daddy time with Harmony, and hopefully the weather will be nice so we can go to the park and play on the slides and swings. Harmony is my constant reminder why I do all of the driving, striving and working that I do, and she&apos;s worth every minute (Mommy Pamela is worth it, too!). I finished this week&apos;s tour alone with 3010 miles at the wheel. Beat THAT, pal!
Have a great week, and I hope the sun shines on you!

 Winning (Santana) 
Posted on 06/15/2006 at 12:22 PM
Good morning from the great state of South Dakota, home of Crazy Horse, restrricted abortion rights, and the Down Under Comedy Club. I&apos;m on the second day of a five-day swing through the prairies of America, my third such trip this year. I hit the road on Monday, after mowing the lawn, getting an oil change and knotting up all of the important work at the house (which of course, included big hugs and kisses for Harmony and Pamela). I wound up getting on the road about 4 PM, which was later than I wanted to leave, but it worked out for the best. Buffalo was an hour away, and I thought I might have problems with 5 o&apos;clock traffic, but it was minimal at best, and I motored on west, hitting Chicago at 1 A.M. I soldiered on through Rockford, Illinois, and up into Wisconsin, and crashed at the first Wisconsin rest area.
I slept for about three hours, and when I woke up, it was as cold as I&apos;ve ever remembered for June. It must have been 45 or 50 degrees, and I couldn&apos;t get hot coffee fast enough. I had 500 miles to go to get to Walker, Minnesota, and a 7 o&apos;clock show. Even with the one-hour improvement moving from Eastern to Central time, I was going to have to pick &apos;em up and put &apos;em down at a pretty fair rate. I made it to the hotel and grabbed a nap, only to be jolted awake by a call from the food and beverage director, making sure that I knew when showtime was. I acted as coherent as I could, and went back to sleep.
The show was pretty good, it started out with a table full of asshole golfers who didn&apos;t know that the lounge was going to have comedy, and they excused themselves during the show rather than sticking around and having their conversation interrupt the show. There was a table of three, some video poker players at the bar, and not a whole bunch else. By the time I decided to just put the blade down and plow my way through the 35-minute set, a big group came in and sat down, and they were comic gold. There was a pregnant girl named Billie, and her boyfriend/father of the baby was there, a gent whose name escapes me (massive sleep deprivation eats my short-term memory). Billie&apos;s friends volunteered that the young man didn&apos;t want to marry her, and we were off to the races. I was able to spritz them, interspersed with my own material dove-tailing in, and the set flew by. I was actually upset that I had to leave the stage of what had been a classic hell gig only 20 minutes ago.
Wednesday, I hit the road and headed south down through Fargo, North Dakota, and into South Dakota. I drove almost six hours without seeing any manner of fast food restaurant, billboard, church, school or other sign of civilization. The sparseness of it all is staggering for a city boy like myself, to drive for so many miles and just see nothing. It explains the lack of diversity of opinion out here in the red states, there&apos;s no dissenting opinion because there&apos;s nobody to discuss anything with. Not for me, brother. Also, I don&apos;t relish the idea of knowing that the only groceries or hospital emergency room are 45 minutes away by helicopter.
The show last night couldn&apos;t have been better. The crowd that I had worried about all day turned out in record numbers (the hotel had a convention of janitors, several of whom attended) and hung on my every word. The owner of the hotel and his wife were very complimentary, and my report card back to the booker shoujld be pretty good. I have a deep sense of urgency about report cards, because I used to fill them out when I managed the Comix Cafe, and I know how even a mediocre grade can hurt an act. Giving a comic a &quot;C&quot; is almost like a death sentence...even though it technically means that the comic did a good enough job, you&apos;re basically telling a booking agent that he wasn&apos;t your cup of tea. Comedy work is scarce enough that I feel I can&apos;t have any clubs saying that about me and jeapordizing my livelihood. I sold a record amount of merchandise, the most since February, and that&apos;s nothing but a good thing, what with the expenses I&apos;ve already incurred getting out here.
Today&apos;s a short drive down to Brookings, South Dakota, and hopefully I can preserve the momentum. Headliner Bud Andersen has been a peach to work with, all a feature act could hope for in terms of friendliness, talent and polish. We&apos;ve been exchanging stories (and after 25 years in the business, he&apos;s got plenty of them) and I feel truly blessed that this tour has been shaping up the way it has. Sometimes I feel I shouldn&apos;t worry so much, but without that tension to keep my moving, I&apos;m afraid of growing complacent.
Have a good day, and stay out of the hot sun!

 Fool In The Rain (Led Zeppelin) 
Posted on 06/10/2006 at 12:17 AM
I had a case of comedy deja vu tonight, the likes of which I&apos;ve only had one other time.
I&apos;m working tonight with headliner Steve Shaffer and mc Doug Karpf. I&apos;ve never worked with either of these guys before, but come to find out, I&apos;ve seen Steve on TV several times before. It didn&apos;t hit me until about 35 minutes into his set when he did a joke that I recognized, about being an Italian from South Philly, and having a friend who says things like &quot;Steve, I got shot six inches away from my babalones.&quot; The joke is talking about the testicles, and it always made me crack up, from all the way back when I was just a comedy-obsessed high school student staying up late and watching Evening At The Improv.
Steve is a top-notch comic and a classy guy, and I think I broke his balls when I asked permission to merchandise after the show. He never heard of that before, the asking of permission, and when I told him that sometimes headliners tell me &quot;no,&quot; he seemed shocked. I told him that it was completely out of courtesy that I asked, and that I always conduct myself that way, and he was really stunned. Anyway, he&apos;s a real professional and fun to watch, polished and sharp as a steak knife, and Doug is a funny comic as well. I&apos;m really pleased to be on the show this weekend, even though tomorrow, we&apos;re cut to one show instead of two. That&apos;s gonna make my drive home a little bit easier, and to show you how classy club owner Scott Bruce is, the money is the same even though there&apos;s fewer shows....THAT&apos;S a gentleman.
The show tonight was comprised of older folks, so I did a cleaner show, and it was fun. After 18 years doing comedy (yup, it&apos;s officially been that long for me as of June 1st), sometimes I get tired of my material. I did some new political stuff tonight (applause breaks), some core stuff, and a little riffing around with the good folks of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. I&apos;m lucky to even be here tonight, to tell you the truth.
The drive down here, even though it was only a little shy of five hours, was one of the most harrowing drives I&apos;ve had in a while. The rain came furiously, and at least one time in New York and one time in Pennsylvania, it was coming so hard, my windshield wipers were useless. Cars were pulling over, stopping under bridges and putting their hazard lights on, it was so bad. I got turned around just leaving my own home town, and at one point, was leading a parade of emergency vehicles on their way to an accident where a car flipped over. Even when I stopped for gas, the guy ahead of me at the station was 100 years old, no joke. He was a Civil War Veteran, and he was trying to stuff Confederate money into the card reader on the pump. I couldn&apos;t catch a break.
I&apos;m getting ready for the big swing west on Monday, and looking forward to a real-live tour again. These weekend rooms are o.k., but I either want to stay in one place for a week, or get moving right away after one show. With a weekend room, you feel like a prisoner, just because there&apos;s nothing to do...at least with a string of one-nighters, you&apos;re obliged to get into the car and find your way to the new place. Tomorrow, I have the prospect of being stuck in downtown Wilkes-Barre where there is a whole bunch of *nothing* happening. And only one show to do! It&apos;s almost like I can&apos;t even use the weekend to tune up my skills.
I know I take the prize for bitching, but I was named &quot;Chronic Complainer&quot; in my high school yearbook. It just feels better to get it off my chest. I still think I have the best job in the world.
Take care and have a nice, dry weekend.

 Further On Up The Road (Eric Clapton) 
Posted on 06/06/2006 at 03:26 AM
What a great week at the Comix Cafe in Buffalo, NY. We had four shows, and while none of them were sold out, the energy was fantastic, and I had a great time working with Ward Anderson and Jeff Kooze. For the first time in a long time, I really felt like the show &quot;meshed&quot; well...usually, I feel like the booking agents for the rooms I work pull three names out of a hat and stick us together, hoping the show will work out.
I wrote a lot of new political material, which is the direction I truly want to go, and instead of just bashing politicians, I&apos;m actually getting to the crux of the issues, which I think people enjoy more. I also let myself be loose and improvisational on stage, which works better from a headlining spot because there&apos;s more time, thus more &quot;wiggle&quot; room, and a feature spot you really have to watch the clock. I still did fine, and I feel like I&apos;m developing correctly, whereas the first ten years of my comedy existence, I never felt like I was going anywhere or improving. The only thing that I improved was my confidence on stage, and while confidence is a good thing, the inability to think fast &apos;n&apos; funny can just make you look like a cocky jerk.
The best part of the Buffalo week was that it was only a 70-mile drive up and back. This week, I&apos;m working Wilkes-Barre, PA for Wisecrackers, and I&apos;m going to get spoiled with the short drives, but that&apos;s o.k., I have a nut-buster coming up the week after; 20 hours to Walker, Minnesota. After that, it&apos;s a nice, easy summer except for a road trip to Florida, but that&apos;s broken up nicely into short drives down and back. Routing is everything, kids...don&apos;t take it for granted!
Have a nice week, and don&apos;t forget the sunscreen.

Well, it&apos;s time for another installment of the Comedy Roadtrip blog, my window to the world to expose the day-to-day workings of a full-time comedian.
When I speak to non-comedians (and we call them all manner of names...non-coms, civilians, or my favorite, norms), the biggest misconception that I have to put to rest is that somehow, a circuit comic like myself, with no TV credits and whom they have never heard of before they&apos;ve seen me perform, is somehow making bags of money. I find this particularly annoying when I have to deal with someone that I&apos;m about to do business with, like an auto repair shop. If they knew the truth of the matter, they&apos;d be less likely to squeeze a yacht payment out of me.
I&apos;ve actually had a few inquiries as of late from comics who are part-time in the game as to what the actual economics of this full-time comedy career entails, and to put it bluntly, it ain&apos;t a pretty picture. To the best of my knowledge, comedy pay hasn&apos;t changed since the mid 1980&apos;s, and in several situations, it&apos;s gone down. Oh, don&apos;t get me wrong, there are a couple of bookers out there who have been able to squeeze an extra $25 out of their accounts to offset rising gas costs, but to say that the money is a living wage is to be fooling oneself.
The plight of the full-time comic is best described as a tenuous situation at best; case in point-this week, I was to work a show at Cucina Di Amore in Liverpool, NY, just outside of Syracuse, on Wednesday night. This one-nighter that I was able to schedule, paid almost as well as a week of shows in Buffalo, NY, where I&apos;m working at the Comix Cafe Thursday through Saturday. I got a call, literally an hour before I was going to get into the car to head east to Liverpool, informing me that the show was canceled due to the great weather. The club had no reservations, and therefore, the gig was off, and that&apos;s that. No other explanation needed.
Now, there are no written contracts in comedy, outside of superstar performers who pay big dollar commissions to their management, publicists, etc. Everything I generally do, outside of corporate work, is a phone call and a virtual handshake. There is no unemployment insurance for the comic who&apos;s show is canceled due to good weather. I might have a leg to stand on if I&apos;d actually made the trip, I might have been able to haggle for partial payment, but in the long run, the brunt of the loss falls on me.
I&apos;m not happy when a venue has to cancel a show, or puts one on to a small crowd, therein losing money. I&apos;ve worked the management side of the desk, and it&apos;s no fun knowing that you&apos;re taking a bath. In that respect, I have empathy. But it&apos;s also no fun as a performer seeing your pay for the week get cut virtually in half. It&apos;s the nature of the business, and a tough pill to swallow sometimes. The upside was that I got to spend a nice quiet evening with Pam and Harmony, having a family movie night courtesy of Blockbuster video. Our selection was the 1986 classic &quot;Crocodile Dundee,&quot; which amazingly, Pamela had never seen before. I&apos;d seen it dozens of times, and still enjoyed it.
Last night was the first night of a three-night engagement at the Comix Cafe in Buffalo, NY. I&apos;d played this particular stage more than a few times, and was excited to go back after an absence of over a year. I&apos;m working with Ward Anderson, a funny comic out of the Baltimore/D.C. area, who I worked with in Rochester a year or so ago. We weren&apos;t expecting a big crowd, what with the Buffalo Sabres going to game 7 of their NHL playoff series with the Carolina Hurricanes. They wound up losing 4-2, but put on a good effort. Our show was decent, with about 50 people in attendance, about three times the folks I was expecting to show up.
It&apos;s been a weird week for weather...three days of heat up into the 90&apos;s, and then high humidity and pissy rain. Luckily, I got the lawn cut before the showers. We got a nice new mower Monday night, and this one has a bagger, which means minimal sweeping up afterwards.
So it&apos;s two more shows tonight and two more on Saturday, and then a nice, long week off until Friday when I travel down to Wilkes-Barre, PA, then a trail of tears out to Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa. I&apos;m expecting the weekend in Buffalo to be pretty good, and we&apos;ll certainly have fun with it.

 Laughing (The Guess Who) 
Posted on 05/29/2006 at 12:45 PM
Is Wisecrackers in Merrillville, Indiana, quite possibly the worst comedy club in the world?
I would have to say no, because I haven&apos;t worked them all, but as far as weekend rooms are concerned, there&apos;s just no reason for a club that is housed in such a top-notch facility (the Radisson Star Plaza) to be in such disarray.
I arrived at the hotel Friday afternoon and checked in, even though it was a little early; I picked up an hour because of the move into the Central time zone and didn&apos;t realize it right away. That left me with a good amount of time to kill. I decided to go catch X-Men: The Last Stand at the local cineplex, and it was very good from a fan&apos;s standpoint. I don&apos;t know how much the average non-comic book reader will enjoy it, but Jack Garner from Gannett news service gave it a 5 out of 10, and I studied film with him while I was in college and trust his opinion. The movie&apos;s definitely not going to be for everyone. My biggest disappointment, and it&apos;s not even really that big, is that Colossus, one of my favorite characters from the comic in the 1980&apos;s, was Russian, and in the movie, they really didn&apos;t give him an accent, or any speaking lines for that matter. Also, one of the trademark X-men fighting manuevers is where Colossus would pick Wolverine up and chuck him at an enemy, claws extended, and they called it a &quot;fastball special.&quot; They used it in the movie twice, which I thought was overkill. The first time was cute, the second time, I felt they were just pandering to the base.
The shows Friday night were wild &apos;n&apos; wooly...the first show was pretty vacant, with the few folks who attended hugging the back wall seating of the 125-person capacity club. Not a good sign. The group was small and disassociated, and I spent too much time trying to convince them to move up, and they just weren&apos;t having it. We had no mc, so I had to fill both roles. I wondered during all the torture why the hotel continues to have comedy under these circumstances...the shows certainly aren&apos;t making any money, nor are they really entertaining anyone. If you get 20 people to laugh out loud all at once, it still sounds like you&apos;re bombing...all you can do is plow through the set and hope forthe best.
The late show was better, and I went out and hit Meijer&apos;s for some late-nite groceries. The next day, I hunted down a comic shop and picked up All-Star Batman #4. DC is retelling the Batman and Robin saga, how Batman took on his teen protege after his acrobat parents were murdered by the mob. It was pretty cool. I also found some copies of the Marvel MAX line edition of Rawhide Kid: Slap Leather in the three-fer-a-buck bin. It&apos;s pure satire (the mayor of the town is Walker Bush, and he has more of a passing resemblance to Dubya, and there&apos;s a character who applies for the deputy&apos;s job named Barney Fyfe, and he mentions during the interview that the last sheriff he worked for only gave him one bullet at a time...pure comedy), and also the Rawhide Kid is gayer than gay, which is just funny all the time, especially for the most feared gunfighter in the land.
The shows Saturday night were more of the same, although first show was a disaster in the making. There was a table of six seated to the left of the stage who felt it necessary to comment on every word of my act, mostly during setups and before punchlines could be delivered, and they were destroying the show. I asked them to be quiet as nicely as I could, first with gentle heckler retorts, and then with the ever-feared substitute teacher speech. One woman, a walking blonde hog and the drunkest of the bunch, left, but then returned with the attitude that she was going to face away from the stage and talk just as loud as she could during the show. I tried to run over her by getting louder, but the sound sytem was set a little low, and there was just no chance. Finally, I just looked over at them, stopped talking, and folded my arms and leaned against the back wall of the stage. I knew what was likely to happen, and it shook out like I predicted; the audience tore the hog to shreds and swearing occured, leading to the calling of security and the ejection of her party. The club, which sported only two employees, reacted as best they could, but when there&apos;s only two employees making and serving all the drinks, it&apos;s hard to monitor what&apos;s going on in the club at the same time. Like I say, I wonder what the hotel&apos;s thinking when they continue to operate a club in this manner. Oh, and did I mention that there&apos;s no advertising? That means, to me, that the same drunken shouters show up to every show. You can&apos;t win!
Second show was more shouters, but the nice kind, the kind that think they&apos;re having a discussion with you, and you can&apos;t destroy them, but you have to shut them up. I waltzed through my act like a three-legged dog running through a burning cornfield, had the best show of the week, and ran to my already packed car and made the 9-hour overnight drive home. I almost made it, but had to crash out at a truck stop somewhere short of the Pennsylvania border, and slept for an hour until some old sourdough trucker tapped on my window to inform me that my headlights were on. Luckily, I was only out for an hour, and it didn&apos;t run the battery down to where the car wouldn&apos;t start, so I shut them off, revved up and hit the road again.
I made it home about 11:30 in the morning, and slept the sleep of the damned. And again, I lamented to my wife that it&apos;s such a lousy club in such a great hotel...I had a sleep-number bed, for God&apos;s sake! I&apos;ve never seen that feature in any hotel I&apos;ve ever been to in my whole life, and the number of hotels I&apos;ve stayed in numbers easily into the thousands. There&apos;s a restaurant on the premises, a Starbucks, an Irish pub, a swimming pool, a workout room, and the club is right in the hotel! It&apos;s a dream gig, except for the fact that the club is run like an afterthought.
So what do I do? Call the booker? The club&apos;s been run like this for six years or more, what&apos;s he gonna do?
Call the hotel? Talk to the food and beverage director? He doesn&apos;t care, if the club&apos;s still making money on the average. This past weekend, the property was sold out to exactly four parties...three weddings and a family reunion. The only hotel guests who weren&apos;t part of those four functions were J. Scott Homan and myself. Every guest at the comedy club, except for one well-dressed couple at the late show Saturday, was from the community. So no matter how you slice it, it&apos;s still extra dollars coming into the hotel, but at what cost? The drunk woman, I was told, was thrown out of the club a few weeks ago for the same behavior. So why let her back in in the first place?
I throw up my hands. The only blessing was that I was working on Memorial Day weekend, when a lot of comedy clubs go dark. But at what cost?
If I didn&apos;t have a family to think about, I don&apos;t know what my answer would be if Iwere offered work at this club again. Bottom line, a comedian with no comedy work is not a comedian, even if it&apos;s the worst comedy club in the country.
Have a wonderful holiday weekend, whatever that means to you.

 Love Will Tear Us Apart (Joy Division) 
Posted on 05/26/2006 at 01:31 AM
A wiser man than me once said, &quot;Better a hell gig than no gig.&quot; And he was right.
I&apos;m in Spring Lake, Michigan, just a hop, skip and a drunken stumble from Muskegon, Michigan, a delightful little burg on the eastern shores of Lake Michigan. The scene of the crime is the Spring Lake Holiday Inn, home of Jack&apos;s Lounge and the weekly debacle that is Thursday night comedy. I&apos;ve played this room five times, and never really done well with the hecklers, drunks and children who seat themselves throughout the room, spacing themselves away from each other like every third person has the bird flu.
Tonight, though, the unthinkable happened. I had a great show! And by great, I mean the time flew, the material was working, and the ad-libs were quick and funny. It&apos;s almost like I had a team of writers in my head, and they kept handing down post-it notes with jokes on them for my mouth to say. Perhaps the late start had something to do with it; our show was at 9:30 rather than the traditional 8:00 start.
I started out my day thinking that the show was at 8:00, and I had a 490 mile drive in front of me. Counting on an average speed of 70 mph, I was looking at a seven-hour drive, possible seven and a half, counting on stops for gas, plus traveling through Canada to cut time off the trip and having to pass through customs for inspection. I wound up not getting to sleep last night until late, so I set my alarm for 8:30 A.M. and decided to take my chances.
I woke up shortly after 8 and decided to get moving. I showered and packed, and started humping gear out to my car. I was greeted by the sight of a dead squirrel in the driveway, and not just any dead squirrel; this one looked like the neighborhood cats hunted him down and made a meal out of him. There was a thing near the carcass that looked like an organ, but I couldn&apos;t identify it...picture a mandarin orange slice, except a pale yellow color. I&apos;m no animal biologist, but I&apos;m thinking it was pretty important to the squirrel to keep him functioning and living, along with his head which was no longer there, either. I disposed of the critter with the help of a shovel, and I marveled at what a pussy I am when it comes to dead animals. I suppose that&apos;s a good trait to have, what with rabies and all the other animal-based diseases that are out there. Oddly enough, by the time I got to the Burger King drive-thru, I had no problem ordering the sausage &apos;n&apos; cheese croissants...I was able to block out the nausea of seeing dead animal long enough to order myself a dead animal breakfast.
The funny thing about seeing the dead squirrel is that currently, we have a squirrel infestation problem in our attic. They&apos;ve chewed their way in and have started pulling down our insulation, just causing a general disturbance. I&apos;ve been waiting for the summer, when they will probably vacate the attic as being too hot, to seal the hole and not actually trap one of them inside; a trapped squirrel can become a savage fighting machine, and rip holy hell out of your window moldings trying to free itself. And yet, seeing my rodent adversary ripped asunder, I felt sorry for him. It made me wonder about the nature of &quot;enemies,&quot; how it&apos;s easy to hate until we see our nemesis in a weakened, helpless state (or worse). I imagined the squirrel&apos;s last moments alive, with a cat, four or five times his size, sinking teeth and claws into him, biting down hard and shaking the life out of him. I hate having squirrels in my attic, but never wished this kind of death on them. I just want them out. It was a weird way to start the morning.
The trip through Canada and into Michigan was a bitch, because it was good &apos;n&apos; hot, and I have no air conditioning. Luckily, it cooled off as I got closer to Lake Michigan, but I had a pretty sweat-soaked shirt when I arrived. I got slowed down in construction traffic going through Lansing, and just as I crossed over the Canadian border into Michigan, I missed my interchange and wound up caught in a construction detour down around the northern suburbs of Detroit. I still wound up getting to the hotel here in Spring Lake about two and a half hours before the show, plenty of time to get a nap, shower and a nice salad before showtime.
The NBA playoffs almost made our show less than the success it was, but Michigan&apos;s beloved Detroit Pistons wound up beating the Miami Heat to even the series, and it made everyone in the room happy. The last two or three years, it seems that I&apos;m always in Michigan during the playoffs, and the Pistons have been in the hunt for the championship the last five years or so. It&apos;s better, I suppose, than playing in Phoenix, Arizona in front of hapless Cardinals football fans and looking back into their blank, hopeless faces.
Tomorrow it&apos;s off to Merrillville, Indiana, home of Wisecracker&apos;s Comedy Club at the Raddison Star Plaza hotel. It&apos;s a cute little gig, but nothing to write home about, and the beautiful accomodations just barely make up for the substandard pay and lackluster audiences. It&apos;s a calendar-filler job, but if I want to keep calling myself a comedian, I feel like I need to be peforming somewhere every week, and getting paid for it. Wisecrackers fills the bill.
I&apos;m working with headliner J. Scott Homan out of Knoxville, Tennessee. He&apos;s a good comic and a nice guy to work with, and he really knocked it out of the park tonight, despite a drive just a little longer than mine and a good amount of liquor in him. We should have a fun weekend, despite the Memorial Day holiday and what may turn into lousy crowds, if at all.
Off to sleep now, and another update coming maybe Saturday morning. Hopefully, no more dead animals to report on. Or dead crowds.

 Theme For An Imaginary Western (Mountain) UPDATED! 
Posted on 05/20/2006 at 11:47 AM
Wrapping up the weekend in North Carolina, I&apos;m about to head off on my 13-hour drive home. Compared to the nightmare drive I did last week, it seems like a cake-walk, but it&apos;s still a sizeable chunk of driving that will pretty much eat my whole day. I&apos;m going to work the phones and see if I can&apos;t fill in some of the holes in my schedule for July and September and beyond, and that should also help melt away some of the miles by keeping busy. Don&apos;t worry about me, though...I promise to keep my eyes on the road, even if I have to write dates in my calendar while I&apos;m doing it.
Saturday was a good day, I went out and ran some errands, including getting new shoelaces to replace the busted one from Friday night. And Walgreen&apos;s turned out to be the perfect place for such things, along with postage stamps and some VHS movies for my dad. He&apos;s 73 and refuses to switch to DVD, so when I see movies in the old format, I pick them up for him. I got him a bunch of titles I&apos;m pretty sure he doesn&apos;t have, and might enjoy, although &quot;Dogma&quot; might be a stretch. Still, maybe I underestimate the old man, but I&apos;m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
The shows were great, and I think I&apos;m really understanding how to cater to the Greensboro audiences. In the past, they&apos;ve really turned off to me (as soon as the mc announces that I&apos;m from New York, even though it&apos;s just Rochester, it means nothing to the Southern ear....New York is New York, and that&apos;s it). Now, I&apos;ve been there five times, and I really go in and grab &apos;em from the first line, don&apos;t give them too much to think about, and really keep it simple. It&apos;s what they enjoy; think Larry The Cable Guy.
I riffed a line or two that really hit home, and I think I&apos;m going to have to work that stuff into my regular set. That&apos;s one of the benefits of working the road so much, I improvise so much material that I generate it and test it faster than I ever could just working open mics at home. My first ten years of comedy were so stagnant, I thought I&apos;d never be &quot;ready&quot; (whatever that means) to feature or headline, and now it&apos;s so fluid, it&apos;s like second nature.
The late show was a knife-fight and a half. Headliner Shaun Jones and I teamed up with our merchandise, offering a two-fer deal with his DVD and my CD, and we were able to make a nice chunk o&apos; change. Shaun is an excellent comic, one of the best I&apos;ve ever worked with, and a super nice guy as well. We&apos;d worked together a couple of times before, and I just marvel at the ease with which he goes into a room and takes it apart. He was living in Los Angeles, but moved back to Atlanta, which is probably a good city to base yourself out of...I have to imagine airfares are pretty reasonable out of a hub city like that.
Sunday was a quick run down to Fayetteville, North Carolina...Shaun called it &quot;Fayette Nam,&quot; which made me laugh out loud. It&apos;s the home of Fort Bragg, and it&apos;s a town full of red-meat, red-blooded, red-state votin&apos; Bush lovers, in other words, I&apos;m a New York Yankee Faggot Jew to them, even though I&apos;m a married Catholic from Upstate...still, that Budweiser bottle that&apos;s doing the translating for them doesn&apos;t help my case. When the prosecuting attorney is 100 years of Civil War shame, I&apos;m going to the big Liberal Hoosegow whether I like it or not. Last night was different, though...I really hit home on the first show, which was packed, and I think I benefitted from a lot of older people in attendance who were more polite, and stabilized the hooligan element of the room. The second show was sparse, and a little wild &apos;n&apos; wooly at times, but still nothing I couldn&apos;t handle. Steve, the house mc, gave me a nice little tag line to one of my core bits that&apos;s gonna probably be a keeper, although now I have to change the rhythm of the piece to get it to fit in, but repetition will smooth out the bumps, I&apos;m sure.
This week, it&apos;s off to Chicago, or rather, the suburb of Merrillville, Indiana, a nice little room just outside of the lawless tire-fire that is Gary, Indiana. I understand from good buddy Mike Dambra that the management of the Wisecrackers club at the Raddison has changed, and I&apos;m actually happy about that, because I didn&apos;t really care for the old guy that used to run it. He was a nebbishy sort and he always got my name wrong when he introduced me, even though I&apos;d been there a half-dozen times. We&apos;ll see how the weekend shakes out under the new regime.
O.K., I&apos;m about to rub some dirt in it and take a lap. I get two days off, and then it&apos;s off to Michigan and Indiana. I hope it doesn&apos;t get too hot today, I have no air conditioning. At least my car windows still roll down (knock on wood).
Peace be with you.

Everything Is Broken (Bob Dylan)

You know, normally I write this journal, just free-flowing the events of the past few days, and at the end, I come up with an appropriate song to tie the whole thing together. But today is different; I know so much of what I want to speak about, the theme of the last few days, that the song presented itself before I even started writing; and that song is &quot;Everything Is Broken&quot; by Bob Dylan.
When last I wrote, I was detailing the trip back from Minot, North Dakota, and I failed to mention that my trusty old war wagon, the 1996 Toyota Corolla with no name, had topped the 300,000 mile mark. It happened somewhere on the New York State Thruway between Buffalo and Rochester, the last leg of the journey home, and I didn&apos;t stop to say a few words or offer up a little ceremony, I just soldiered on and arrived home. For history&apos;s sake, and as I hope someday my daughter will read over these journals to find out what exactly her father&apos;s life was like (and what killed him at a young age), she&apos;ll find out that the car hit that venerable milestone sometime between 1 and 2 P.M., Monday, May 15, 2006.
The car is in great shape, and horrible shape, all at the same time, if that&apos;s possible. Through the dilligent use of synthetic oil, the engine is strong, reliable, and free of wear. I&apos;ve blown rods on two other cars due to my ignorance in the importance of changing oil and maintaining a vehicle, and I&apos;ve decided to have no more of that.
And yet, despite the wonderful, dependable state of the engine of the vehicle, the items that are in need of repair are daunting and insurmountable; consider this:
1. There is an oil leak in the engine area, and the oil is getting on the timing belt. Whether or not this will cause the belt to slip off it&apos;s moorings (and the vehicle to come to a dead stop) is questionable, but also the effects of oil on the belt causing it&apos;s rubber to break down and snap have also been offered as a possibility. Not good.
2. The air conditioning is no longer working, as parts of it have completely disintegrated. Recharging the AC is not a possibility, as the freon would just dissipate into the atmosphere, leaving me sweaty and unrefreshed.
3. Road salt from several northern winters has begun a slow decay of the radiator. Just the right hot day and a long road trip and it&apos;s goodnight, Bessie.
4. The rear driver&apos;s side door is mechanically frozen into the locked position. It doesn&apos;t open for love nor money.
5. The trunk no longer opens by key, you must use the interior latch release by the driver&apos;s seat, next to the gas cap release. Through constant use, I snapped the latch off, and had to drill a hole in it and stick a small screwdriver into it as a temporary handle. Yesterday, pulling into Greensboro, North Carolina, the screwdriver bent and no longer operates the latch. I had to retrieve items from the trunk by putting the back seats down and crawling in like I was fishing Saddam out of a spider-hole. Luckily, nothing was bigger than the aperature, or it would have turned into Al Capone&apos;s vault back there.
6. The passenger side seat belt doesn&apos;t work, because the latch lost a spring. I still have the spring, but it&apos;s mangled beyond use. Not a big thing, as long as I don&apos;t have any passengers.
7. My &quot;check engine&quot; light is on. This might be due to the oil leak, but whatever it is, the light&apos;s been on for almost a year. I just consider it part of my private light show.
8. The radio doesn&apos;t light up with the rest of the dashboard at night when the lights are on. It&apos;s probably just a bulb, but I&apos;m not savvy enough to start opening shit up and trying to replace it.
9. There&apos;s a ding in the windshield, courtesy of a gravel truck in Minnesota, more fun from last week&apos;s helldrive back from North Dakota. I&apos;ve got full glass coverage, but at this point, what&apos;s the use? The only reason to get the glass fixed is to make it slightly less unattractive to a prospective buyer.
10. The back reflective lens is cracked, and there&apos;s a crumple damage area over the right rear wheel well. Those defects have been there so long, I don&apos;t even consider them.
11. I&apos;m missing a wheel cover on the back right tire. One day, I went out to the car, and it just wasnt&apos; there. That was the beginning of the end.
12. There are plenty of miscellaneous scrapes, tears and stains in the passenger compartment, some could be fixed with super glue, some not at all, but they reflect 1,000 miles a week on the road for the last (almost) five years. Shit happens.
Yeah, the car ain&apos;t pretty, but it gets me from here to (way over) there. I honestly don&apos;t know if I could find a buyer with all that stuff wrong with it, but to the right person who knows how to fix stuff, it could be quite a gem. Hey, I almost said that with a straight face!
Not to say that that&apos;s the only place where stuff is broken. Earlier this week, the fan/light fixture in my home office blew a bulb, so I got the stepladder out and went about replacing the bulb. I changed the bulb, and when I did, a small screw fell out of the unit. I put it back (I think) in the correct spot, and now the light doesn&apos;t work. The fan still works, which is nice, but that brings the count up to three rooms in my apartment that have switch/fixture problems with the overhead lights. We have to get an electrician to come in, but the general rule is that we don&apos;t have servicemen come to the house unless I&apos;m home, because my wife, mother-in-law and aunt-in-law (who is also our landlord) feel that because they&apos;re all female, that a serviceman will try to give them the old dippity-do and screw them out of money for unnecessary repairs because they&apos;re female and don&apos;t know about such things. I guess they have a point.
What else is broken? Well, I guess you could say that my home computer isn&apos;t operating up to snuff. We had to take it in a few weeks ago for a replacement of the video card, and now the video is working fine, but we&apos;re getting an error message that our copy of Windows may be counterfeit (that&apos;s never happened before) and it&apos;s not a big deal, but you shouldn&apos;t get something fixed only to find that something else is now wrong that wasn&apos;t wrong before it got fixed. Also, our DVD burner is no long burning DVD&apos;s, which means I have no DVD&apos;s to sell on the road. I have CD&apos;s for days, so it&apos;s not a mechanical thing, but all the tricks we&apos;ve tried to get it up and running have so far been fruitless. I&apos;m about to abandon all technology and go Amish, although I&apos;m on the fence about that because I think the beard might itch.
So I&apos;m in Greensboro, North Carolina, working at the Comedy Zone, a club that worships and reveres me, even though they always look at me like I&apos;m a damn Yankee come to hornswoggle them out of money and despoil their women (which, to be honest....). Last night I found out that Chris Wiles, the local hero/house mc, was on vacation in Europe, so I didn&apos;t have to battle over the hump of working with him. He&apos;s well-beloved, and hard to follow. I do o.k., but not like I&apos;m used to doing.
Instead, Charlotte&apos;s own Ryan V. was our host, and he&apos;s a good kid, but no Chris Wiles. I hit the stage and my right foot got caught on a step, breaking my shoelace in two places. The double-knotted bow ripped right off! I worked the whole set worrying whether or not my shoe was gonna go flying off. I planted my right foot and pivoted the whole set like I was a Chucky Cheese band member. I had a good show, but it was weird, and at the end, I copped to the broken shoelace and got a big round of applause, and when I left the stage, I found the busted part that had fallen off and held it high so that everyone could see it.
I did the second show with a knotted-together mess of a shoelace, but it held. The second show was a typical Friday late show....young, drunk kids, and plenty of them. I got a shot of Jagermeister sent up to me moments upon taking the stage, and that was the beginning of the end. I had a good show, but it was a total knife-fight, and it wasn&apos;t like it was just one table that I had to battle, it was everyone. I finished up and left the building, heading back to the hotel to detoxify myself and get some food. I was worried about doing the shot on an empty stomach, but as of this morning, I&apos;m o.k. I&apos;m on a couple of medications that specifically say not to drink alcohol, but it wasn&apos;t a big shot and I&apos;m pretty big to begin with, so I took my chances. I took my regular evening medications, ate some lousy McDonald&apos;s food (the only thing open near the hotel) and went to sleep.
Well, what else could possibly be broken? I&apos;ll tell you, gentle reader. When I arrived here at the luxurious Red Carpet Inn here in Greensboro, I was delighted to see that my room is outfitted with a fridge and a microwave. I won&apos;t be here long enough to use them, but it&apos;s a nice touch and an upgrade since I was here last. But the bathroom sink had no stopper! I wanted to shave, and need a bowl of water to work over, to rinse the razor, wet my face, etc. I improvised a stopper by taking a wad of toilet tissue, rolling it to the appropriate size, ie: a bullet-shapped plug to fit the drain. I wrapped the wad with the plastic wrap from one of the disposable plastic cups, making a semi-waterproof drain plug that lasted long enough for me to shave off six days of beard growth (which, yes, itched like a motherfucker).
I did get one nice surprise, and that is the night auditor recognized me from the last time I was here, and hipped me to the wireless internet that the Red Carpet just got. He passed me the access code, which I guess they don&apos;t hand out to the regular guests, meaning I get to use wireless all day today, and then the hotel that I&apos;m staying at tomorrow in Fayetteville has the wireless. It&apos;s so much more convenient than doing the dial-up thing.
Play nice today, and don&apos;t break anything.

 Drive (The Cars) 
Posted on 05/16/2006 at 09:46 PM
WARNING! If the idea of discussing POLITICS or RELIGION makes you angry, DO NOT READ THIS POST!!! (Especially the end!)
I&apos;m back home from my nut-busting trip from Minot, North Dakota to Rochester, NY, and it only took me 27 1/2 hours to make the 1,558 mile jaunt.
Saturday night was an unworthy denoument to an otherwise fun week. After Minot State University graduated on Friday, the town became a ghost city...I swear to God, a tumbleweed (a real tumbleweed like in the movies) hit my car! I&apos;m not lying! I laughed out loud like I never have before! The show was a bust, a small crowd full of the rudest people you&apos;d ever want to get stuck in front of, and a bachelorette party, to boot! Headliner Fred Bevill left the stage after his set and spit on the ground and vowed never to come back to.....let me try and remember his words exactly.....&quot;this piece of shit club.&quot; And he did well! Fred Bevill&apos;s a good comic, and I was glad to share the stage with him this week. We were going to try and check out the flea market at the State Fairgrounds, but Fred got tired after our Chinese lunch, and I got there exactly 20 minutes after it closed. Fuck.
I shook the dust of Minot off my heels at approximately 10:30 (EDT), and started off on the long journey home. I passed through the towns of Velva and Jamestown, North Dakota, the homes of newsman Eric Sevareid and Major League ballplayer Darin Erstad of the 2002 World Champion Anaheim Angels. I don&apos;t know why that sort of thing appeals to me, knowing the celebrity birthplaces, but I think it&apos;s cool that anyone from anywhere can eventually become a famous person in any kind of field. Although, to be truthful, I guess after media, entertainment, politics and sports, there&apos;s not a lot of other fields that are really in the public eye.
I made it into Minnesota just a little after 2:00, and then got to Wisconsin about 7:30. It started raining and there was construction, and that went a long way towards keeping me from getting home in a timely fashion, but I clenched my teeth and kept moving. I hit Chicago around 1:00 P.M., and then spent the better part of an hour getting lost in construction detours. I wound up in Calumet City and was largely disoriented until I found State Line Road, a residential street that runs North to South and is literally the state line between Illinois and Indiana. I pulled into a Mobil gas station with huge overhead lights and consulted my road atlas, and found that I was only six blocks away from the 90 Thruway, which would take me the rest of the way home. I was in a very bad neighborhood, and with the added rain and pitch darkness (very few streetlights for some reason), I was pretty scared for a little while.
I kept soldiering on, and made it to South Bend/Mishawaka, Indiana, before I decided that I better get some sleep. It was pushing 4 A.M., and I figured that a couple of hours of sleep would do me good. I pulled into a rest stop and parked among the truckers who were bedded down for the night in their sleeper cabs. I slept until about 6:30 and then got back on the road.
By the time I arrived home, it was about 2 P.M., and I was tired, but thanks to Sugar-Free Red Bull, I was wide awake. I had an argument with the clerk at the Angola Service Oasis about the addictive properties of energy drinks. I took the stance that they were not addictive, although they probably are because caffeine is addictive, but she was a droopy little noodge who was so cocky I felt like I had to take her down a peg.
The thing that kept me really going on the whole journey (besides the energy drinks...I can quit whenever I want) was the phone calls to family, friends and loved ones. I can listen to music, talk radio, or even books on tape, but nothing passes the time like good conversation. I caught up with my brother Christopher and we talked for about an hour (my niece Olivia made daddy give up the phone so she could talk to me, too) and we discussed everything from our beloved Buffalo Bills to how our mother is doing, the tour, his new job and everything in between. He recently picked up the movie &quot;Second String&quot; which was a made-for-TV movie about the Buffalo Bills and a fictitious season in which all their offensive starters got food poisoning and how a quarterback off the waiver wire helped lead them to the championship, despite a coach who didn&apos;t believe in him or want to give him a chance. I asked Chris how he liked it, and he said he cried. Well, we both did, so there&apos;s nothing to be ashamed about. It&apos;s a pretty cookie-cutter sports film, but for Buffalo Bills fans, it&apos;s like a love letter...it gets you right in the chest.
Also, I spoke with comedy buddy/Los Angeles legend Steve Burr. Steve is working on a radio show for Sirius Sattelite Radio called &quot;The Three Things You Never Talk About,&quot; and he has asked me to be on the panel of his demo episode. We&apos;re going to record it in Rochester with a live comedy club audience on Monday, June 26th. The premise of the show is that it will be a panel-type talk show centering on politics, religion and sports. I told Steve that the three things are actually politics, religion and sex, not sports, but it&apos;s freely up to interpretation. Also on the panel will be Jaime Lissow (Jaime, Steve and I are performing at the Comix Cafe that week, so it&apos;s very convenient), and rounding out our group is Marianne Sierk and Mike Dambra, two very talented comics who are also friends of ours. Mark Wiedmann, an emerging comic talent here in Rochester, has been tapped to be our &quot;man in the street&quot; taking audience questions. It&apos;s a good group with a lot of excellent parts.
I got picked, not only because of my enormous comic talent, but because of my insight into politics and religion (I&apos;m a ham &apos;n&apos; egger when it comes to talking sports, but I can spit out cliche&apos;s with the best of them) and the fact that I&apos;m a blustery blowhard with an opinion about everything and I&apos;m not afraid to ram it down everyone&apos;s throat. I don&apos;t mind that role; when I was in high school, the yearbook committee my senior year labeled me &quot;chronic complainer,&quot; and if I can carve a show-biz niche for myself by bitching about current events, then I will. I guess that the only thing I&apos;m concerned about is that the panel will skew too hard to the left, with no dissenting viewpoint. That can lead to a boring show. I know Mike&apos;s politics, and he&apos;s along the same lines that I am, and maybe I&apos;m judging Marianne and Jaime as being more left-leaning than they are.
Truthfully, it sounds like an awesome show and I&apos;m flattered to have been chosen to be on it. I&apos;m getting to work with some very funny people, and even though I&apos;m a role player, I feel like the show will be richer for my contribution. If you&apos;re in the Rochester area on Monday, June 26th and you&apos;re interested in attending the taping, let me know and I&apos;ll arrange for you to get in. If you want more information about the show, Steve Burr is your man and I&apos;ll forward all inquiries to him.
O.K., the mundane task of laundry beckons as I get ready for my return to Greensboro, North Carolina this weekend. I also want to spend some time with Pam and Harmony...it&apos;s good to spend time with the family; it reminds me why I&apos;m doing all of this stuff.

 Breakfast In America (Supertramp) 
Posted on 05/13/2006 at 12:38 PM
Whim Wham Woozle, bitches!
I&apos;m sorry...that&apos;s a line from the Futurama episode that spoofs Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, where Fry, Leela and the gang go visit the Slurm factory, and when I woke up this morning, for some reason it was stuck in my head. Also, Slurms McKenzie (the Ultimate Party Worm) didn&apos;t say &quot;bitches,&quot; but it seemed to fit, so I put it in there. It was in my head, and I had to get it out, so now you&apos;re stuck with it. Deal.
It&apos;s a beautiful morning here at the International Inn in Minot, North Dakota, and so far, it&apos;s been a pretty good weekend. The show Thursday night was well attended, but somewhere along the line, I had to fight for my life on stage because they just weren&apos;t digging what I do. I called a table full of middle-aged women &quot;bingo ladies,&quot; and they treated me like I was the Antichrist. They were really offended! The crowd was really chatty and unfocused, and even though I got laughs, it was still that ugly, &quot;gotta take a shower&quot; feeling after the show. I didn&apos;t do what I usually do, there was no ingratiating myself to the audience, connecting with them, and I just started getting self-deprecating (not necessary) and abusive (also not necessary). After the show, headliner Fred Bevill and I retreated to the Primo for a late breakfast and a chance to perform the autopsy on the show, and while he was quite apologetic, blaming the mc, blaming the audience, the duty to make them laugh rested squarely on my shoulders and I would not shirk the blame.
Friday, Fred and I met up and had lunch at a local buffet restaurant called the Royal Fork, which we thought might be a Chinese place, but was more like home-style cookery. I had a nice salad, some fried chicken and mashed potatoes, and then we headed across the parking lot to the mall to seek out the movie theater. We decided to check out Mission Impossible 3, and killed some time shopping before the movie started (we had about 40 minutes to kill).
After traipsing around the rather limited shopping mall, we got to the theater and watched the movie. They showed about 100 previews, commercials, snack bar adverts, and all in all about half an hour&apos;s worth of stuff that was not the movie. By the time the movie was actually over, I was fidgeting in my seat like a 5-year old at the DMV.
Now, I used to do movie reviews and the like (several years ago), and the temptation is to use this space to do the same, but there are others more qualified to do that, so I&apos;ll simply say that I enjoyed the film but wasn&apos;t overly impressed with the script, and leave it at that. The experience gave birth to a bit that I used on stage last night, and it went over pretty well, and I may use it for the duration of the summer, or the film&apos;s run, whichever ends first (I&apos;m betting on the summer to go the distance on this one).
Afterwards, it was back to the ranch to get ready for the show, and the hotel was already starting to fill up with Minot State University students and their families, the graduation ceremonies having commenced earlier in the day. When I learned that the college was graduating, I figured that our show would be a big bust, with everyone&apos;s attention being drawn elsewhere, but I was assured that because graduation was during the day, we&apos;d have huge crowds for our show at night.
We wound up having a decent show, but it was only half the room&apos;s worth, but the people were right on point. They were focused and enjoyed the show, and I had a really good set. It&apos;s very important for me to have a dynamite show right after a disappointing one, because I need to get the monkey off my back and prove to myself that I&apos;m still funny. It&apos;s obsessive, I know, but that&apos;s how I am and it&apos;s not like I developed that trait yesterday. If I detailed for you the rituals I go through getting ready for a show, you&apos;d think I was nuts (if you don&apos;t already think that now) and I wonder sometimes if I eliminated all of the things in my life that I do &quot;just because,&quot; would I be happier? And the answer is, &quot;probably not.&quot;
After the show, which I should say, was fantastic all around, Fred absolutely destroyed, we headed back to Primo&apos;s for a late breakfast. Our server, a middle-aged Asian lady with a surprisingly round rump (you don&apos;t see that ever, do you?) who was our server the night before, was flying around like a dead leaf in a tornado, even though there were only four tables seated in the whole restaurant. Our service was friendly and polite, if not excruciatingly slow, but she gave us a $5 each discount, as she did the night before. Apparently, there&apos;s a coupon that you get when you check in to the hotel, but it&apos;s only for the high-rollers who rent out the suites, and she said because we were the comics, we must have just forgot our coupons up in the room. Sometimes, inefficient customer service works out in your favor.
Today, we have two shows, although the prospect of the late show actually happening is a little foggy. If it doesn&apos;t come down, the question is there whether or not I start dog-legging it back to New York, or get a good night&apos;s sleep, start early in the morning, and hit the road with daylight and fresh horses. I can&apos;t do a thing to make it happen one way or the other, so I&apos;m just going to rest up today so that I can drive confidently that I haven&apos;t been awake all day and only have a few hours of energy reserves to get me closer to home. I might hit the big North Dakota State Fairgrounds, which are right down the street, and check out the flea market that starts today. It&apos;ll get me out of the hotel room to gets some air and a little walking-around excercise.
Have a great weekend, and I&apos;ll check in with you all later as to my travel plans.

 Thunder and Lightning (Thin Lizzy) 
Posted on 05/11/2006 at 06:23 PM
Hello from Minot, North Dakota, on the other side of the Continental Divide (if you&apos;re an Easterner like myself) and the latest stop on the never-ending Ralph Tetta Comedy Tour.
Now, I don&apos;t wanna cry poor or anything, but the drive out here was 1,671 miles...I definitely have to learn to route better. I left Rochester, NY after securing an oil change on my soon-to-be departed Toyota Corolla, and got moving around 11 A.M. on Tuesday, ready to make the charge towards the Upper Prairies of America and my final destination of Williston, North Dakota.
I took advantage of my time in the car by calling bookers with my cell phone, trying to secure work for the Fall. I learned a couple of years ago that you have to keep on top of that sort of thing, or you wind up with big unemployed holes in your schedule. I didn&apos;t get anything, but got in touch with a couple of folks that I need to contact on Friday for work. It&apos;s all timing with the booking agents, you just have to be patient. One booker confided in me that he booked three months of dates for a one-nighter that was on Thursday, and he booked it for Wednesday. That&apos;s at least 24 comics that have to be called and notified that they&apos;re unemployed, and a possible 24 new calls to fill the dates....not fun, and I know because I&apos;ve been there.
On the NYS Thruway, an asshole passed me at about 85 miles an hour. I&apos;m not calling him an asshole because he was 20 miles over the speed limit, I&apos;m calling him an asshole because he had a HUGE Pittsburgh Steelers emblem on his back window. Steelers fans are dicks, they used to gloat over their 70&apos;s Super Bowls like it was yesterday, now they finally won another one and we have to listen to them for another 35 years. Swell. I was overly sensitive about the speeding thing because I got two speeding tickets in two different states the last two months, so I was pacing myself as not to get into trouble. The Steelers fan found himself pulled over about 20 miles down the road from where he passed me, and as I breezed by him at a respectable 5 miles over the speed limit, I gave him a little head nod....one for the thumb, if you will.
I didn&apos;t have to stop for gas until I was well into Ohio, and I noticed gas prices going down significantly from the New York State raping that I&apos;ve become accustomed to. I paid 2.71 a gallon for regular unleaded, and haven&apos;t seen it that cheap since. The average seems to be hovering around 2.89 nationally, or at least up through Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota.
I was planning on driving until I hit Minnesota, but just couldn&apos;t pull it off. I got just past Eu Claire to the town of Knapp, Wisconsin, and had to pull into a rest area to get some sleep. I wound up sleeping for about three hours or so, and got up as the sun was rising. I noticed that a couple who had pulled in to the parking lot a few spots away from me had devised a clever system to keep their truck dark enough to sleep in...they put black plastic garbage bags over all their windows. That&apos;s a trick that I&apos;ll have to remember.
I drove through Minneapolis and listened to some of the worst morning drive talk radio I&apos;ve ever heard in my life. The jocks were boring, uninspiring and repetetive. Radio sometimes makes me laugh because it&apos;s the only field where if you fail in other endeavors (comedy, politics, show business), they welcome you with open arms. It&apos;s a level of quasi-celebrity that attracts the folks who want to be well known and liked, but just don&apos;t have the tools to get it done themselves. And I will be the first one to throw myself under the bus, because I worked in radio for a long time as a fledling standup comic because I thought it would help my career. It didn&apos;t, and exhibit A should be that I was sleeping in my car in a truck stop in Knapp, Wisconsin.
I continued my drive through Minnesota, and by the time I hit Fargo, North Dakota, the rain had gotten heavy and my back tires, balding to the point of embarassment, had ceased to hug the road and I had to stop and get new ones. I didn&apos;t want to spend the money, and I&apos;m planning on getting rid of this car any day now, but I couldn&apos;t guarantee that I wasn&apos;t going to go sliding off the road into a ravine, so I bit the pillow and got two new all-seasons to the tune of 140 bucks. The rain stopped and the skies cleared up exactly one hour later. Still, with almost 2,000 miles still left before I got home, it was nice to feel secure that my vehicle wouldn&apos;t just go careening into oncoming traffic after a wheel exploded.
Later, I drove through the Little Missouri National Grassland, a national park that consists of a road going through a valley, but a valley filled with hills, if you can imagine that. There were no guardrails, and the speed limit was 65 mph, and it was possibly the most dangerous road I&apos;ve ever been on in my life. Also, I had been in the car for 30 hours with only a few hours of sleep, and I was hallucinating.
I got to the hotel in Williston just a couple of hours before showtime, and I was able to check in, iron a shirt and have a nice, relaxing hot shower to get ready for the show. I was upset that I didn&apos;t have time for a nap, but made up for it when I fell asleep while putting on my socks.
The gig was at a club across the parking lot from the hotel called P. Nuttz, a sports bar with bowls of peanuts on the tables and shells on the floor. I met the headliner, Fred Bevill, and the owner of the club, Mike Smith, and we shot the breeze while the crowd trickled in. At first, it looked like it was gonna be a real bomb, but the room filled up, and we started only about half an hour late (not a good sign, mind you, but the club was new so I forgave). I took the stage, which was a triangle style job in the corner of the room, and noticed that dead center of the front of the stage, there was a steel pole. Not thick enough to be a strip-club pole, mind you, but just thick enough to be in my way for the evening. I used it to my advantage, leaning on it rather than holding myself up as I was devoid of energy caused by denying myself proper food and sleep for 30 hours.
The show was good and I sold one CD after the show, which was one more than I thought I would. Fred and I got along well, and it looks like it&apos;s going to be a good weekend here in Minot, which was only a couple of hours to the east (and went a long way toward sending me closer to home). After I checked in, Fred and I ate lunch in the hotel restaurant, which I found out is open 24 hours a day. That&apos;s a break, because it basically means I don&apos;t have to leave the hotel if I don&apos;t want to, and I don&apos;t want to because I got a great parking spot up front.
Crowds may be sparse at the show this weekend because Minot State University is holding their graduation ceremony on Friday night, and college towns usually become ghost towns after graduation. Still, I&apos;m happy to be working and I&apos;ll give the folks who show up the best performance I possibly can. The local paper printed a list of the graduates by name and home state and town, and come to find out, there&apos;s a young man from Irondequoit, New York (just outside of Rochester!) who&apos;s getting his masters degree this weekend. My other Rochester sighting this week was a guy in a blue Honda Civic that I passed (twice) on the route 94 who had New York plates, and a Dick Ide Honda license plate holder (Dick Ide being a car dealer in Rochester).
Viva La Raza!

 Must Have Got Lost (J. Geils Band) 
Posted on 05/07/2006 at 01:57 PM
Good morning, or afternoon as you may call it (I just woke up), and glad tidings today in the form of my weekend report from Niagara Falls, and the House of Comedy.
We had one show each night on Friday and Saturday, and I was accompanied each night by opener Ray Salah. Ray&apos;s worked the club before, and it&apos;s nice not having to make the jaunt by myself, even though it&apos;s only a paltry 90 minute drive.
We left good &apos;n&apos; early on Friday, expecting to get in early and enjoy a 50% discounted meal at in-house restaurant Jack Tanner&apos;s, except my directions were rendered useless by road construction, and I wound up driving through the butterfly conservatory and the Maple Leaf Village before I could actually find the AmeriCana Hotel (where HOC and J.T&apos;s are located). We still had enough time to choke down dinner, and started the show just a little after 9:00 P.M. (the club&apos;s actual starting time) for the 40 stalwarts who showed up rather than watch the Sabres/Senators hockey game, which by all accounts was quite exciting, going into overtime and finally being won by the Sabres 7-6.
Ray did a great job, and then I hit the stage and did my usual prairie fire show, going off in all directions instead of being focused and delivering my material. Truth to tell, I started out in that fashion, but didn&apos;t stick with the program because the audience just wasn&apos;t giving me back what I wanted, namely laughter and acceptance. I finished strong, and we drove back to Rochester, or actually I drove back to Rochester, and Ray fell into a deep, Snow White-like sleep.
Saturday, I did yard work most of the afternoon, one of the benefits of playing close to home, and we headed out to Niagara Falls around 6:00 P.M., this time, bound and determined to get to the club nice &apos;n&apos; early. As we hit the New York State Thruway, I noticed a van in front of me with a bunch of bumper stickers, and I had to get close enough to read them. One of them said &quot;PatDuffy.Net,&quot; and Pat Duffy, I recognized, is another comic from Rochester, one of the youngsters just starting out, and I remembered that I tried to book him this week to host at the Comix Cafe, but he indicated that he wasn&apos;t available because he was working out of town with another local comic, Danny Liberto. I jockeyed myself next to them in the passing lane and told Ray to visually identify them, and sure as shit, it was them! I grabbed my cell phone and started a prank.
I called Pat on his cell phone, and he picked up. &quot;Pat!&quot; I cried. &quot;Our feature act at the Comix Cafe cancelled, and I need a middle. It pays $200! Can you do it?&quot;
Pat sounded like I told him Christmas was canceled. &quot;Oh no! I can&apos;t do it, I&apos;m already working tonight! I&apos;m heading to Niagara Falls, and I&apos;m halfway there!&quot;
&quot;Bullshit, you&apos;re not halfway there, I&apos;m right in front of you, fucker, you just got on the Thruway! Watch, I&apos;m gonna roll my window down and stick my arm out!&quot; I rolled the window down, gave a wave, and Duffy knew he was bitched! It was a mild prank, but fun nonetheless. The four of us exchanged pleasantries, and we were on our way, Dan and Pat to the American side of Niagara Falls, and Ray and myself to the Canadian side.
We wound up missing the exit to the Rainbow bridge, and instead headed all the way to the Whirlpool bridge, and drove again through the butterfly conservatory and Maple Leaf Village. We arrived an hour early and ate at Jack Tanner&apos;s again, but with a slightly smaller margin of time.
We were joined onstage by Marc Sinodinos, a Canadian comic who filled the middle spot, and Terry Parker, a headliner who came in and did a (25 minute) guest spot. We all kept the audience rolling and had a good comraderie, even though the show was longer than a Stevie Wonder Grammy acceptance speech.
Before the show, I was still in a prankish mood, and I decided to jab Marc a little bit. We&apos;d worked together last year at a gig in Sherkston Shores, a resort area in Ontario. The day before, Tony Gigliotti, the manager of the club, mentioned that Marc was coming in because he was dating Kendra, one of the cocktail servers at the club. I wound up standing next to Marc and I said, &quot;Kendra&apos;s gonna make a lot of money tonight, and she&apos;s gonna do us all!&quot; He didn&apos;t say anything, but went over to her and started whispering in her ear, and I called him over and let him know that I was in on the &quot;secret&quot; that they were dating, and that I was razzing him. He was gonna try to have her kiss him as he dipped her to bust my chops, but I got to him first. It was more light-hearted razzing, which is part of the comedy business that I enjoy.
The show was full-up, with a big bachelorette group in attendance, and I made the most of working them into the show, and there was one tense moment when a loud table-talker (drunk) in the back of the room was shouted down by another show guest who told him (loudly), &quot;Why don&apos;t you go home?&quot; A few people in the room thought that it was being shouted toward me in some sort of anti-American way, as relations between the U.S. and Canada have been strained the last few years. I worked through it with humor, and finished my set, and afterwards sold CD&apos;s, took pictures with guests and shook hands, my favorite part of the evening.
We got back across the border and stopped at the casino to do the currency exchange and were delighted to see that the Canadian dollar was trading at 88.5 cents on the U.S. dollar, an increase since the last time I visited the Great White North. We then headed toward Buffalo to find something to eat, and wound up driving up and down all the roads around the Boulevard Mall, only to find the usual crappy chain open...AppleBee&apos;s, Tully&apos;s and the like. We settled on a Greek diner where the service was polite but excruciatingly slow. We got back into Rochester after 3:00 A.M., and I dropped Ray off, went home, and slept the sleep of the damned.
I have two days to ready myself for the big trip back to North Dakota, which I&apos;m not looking forward to...26 hours one way to Williston, North Dakota. I&apos;m gonna make some money this weekend, but not much...$3.00 a gallon gas is gonna kick the hell out of my profit margin. Still, it&apos;s a new room in Minot, and I&apos;m looking forward to it. Minot&apos;s a college town, and I&apos;m wondering if being so close to graduation is going to affect our attendance this week. Still, I&apos;ll make the most of it.
The next time I check in, I&apos;ll be in North Dakota. See you then.

 Welcome To The Working Week (Elvis Costello) 
Posted on 05/02/2006 at 07:28 AM
Hey, I&apos;m back...did ya miss me?
My desktop computer crapped out last week, courtesy of a faulty video card, and while I could have used my laptop to post a new blog, I decided not to; I even left it home this past weekend so Pam could get some work done. As it stood, in Traverse City, Michigan, the hotel I was in was a rustic little vacation bungalow near Lake Michigan that didn&apos;t feature phones in the room, so not only was wireless not availabke, but I couldn&apos;t do the dial-up thing either. I didn&apos;t miss it for the few days it was out, but I know dedicated readers probably thought I was sick or in jail or something.
I took most of last week to recover from the Minnesota trip. Just catching up with a stack of mail, doing laundry, doing high-shelf duty around the house for my 5&apos; 2&quot; wife, and reacquainting myself with a hyperactive 2-year-old baby daughter were strenuous enough without adding the task of writing a journal entry and making my slug-a-bed lifestyle seem interesting. Before I knew it, it was Friday morning and it was up with the birds to make the 538 mile trek to Traverse City, Michigan.
The Other Place comedy club in Traverse, so named because the first club was in Saginaw, Michigan, is a club that&apos;s been around forever. Traverse is a vacation resort-type town on the north shores of Lake Michigan, and the club only runs in the winter when the visitors to the town have gone...explain that to me if you ever figure it out. It caters to locals, although actor Bruce Willis, who has a place just outside of town, never shows up. I&apos;m a fan, and it always seems like a missed opportunity.
Jack Paupore, the owner of the club, is 1,000 years old and wears the pelt of a dead animal on his head. It&apos;s the worst hairpiece ever, insert your own punchline here. He&apos;s so old, insert your own punchline here. My favorite one was, Jack always asks, &quot;Do you remember where you were when you heard Jesus was assassinated?&quot; He&apos;s the cheapest man alive, and his club reflects that. The in-house sound system is an FM radio, and when the show starts, he turns the music up loud, and the opener of the two-man show goes up (no intro) and starts the show. Sadly, at the top of the hour of 8:00 P.M., most stations are still playing commercials, so sometimes you go up to a spot celebrating the stomach-acid fighting power of Di-Gel.
Our crowds this weekend couldn&apos;t even have been called that. If Bruce Willis showed up each night and brought 10 friends to each show, our four show total attendance might have climbed into triple figures. As he chose to stay away, our figures stayed in the kiddie-coaster numbers and no one got a nosebleed counting the receipts at the door. I did three shows that were pure crowd work, because no one was going to sit still and listen to prepared material. They were coarse, unsophisticated and rude people, and wanted to be harassed and carry on a dialogue with the performers rather than be entertained. I was a little put off, because I had the big cancer benefit in Battle Creek on Sunday night, and I wanted to tune up a little for that performance. I soldiered on, and got a nice compliment from Jack about how I got the people to move up towards the stage rather than sitting in the back of the room...of course, there&apos;s no one at the door to seat the people in this final frontier of comedy, so you have to strap on the leathers and prepare for the gunfight. The good news is that Jack wants me to headline his room next time I come back. The bad news is that I would have to go back.
The highlight of the trip was working with headliner Demetrius Nicodemus out of Toledo, Ohio, a good comic and friend. We hung out together and helped alleviate some of the misery of playing such an unsatisfying weekend of shows by having lunch together, talking shop and we even hit a comic book store and killed some time. I picked up a Justice League special that I didn&apos;t even know existed, written by comedian Patton Oswalt. I&apos;m not a huge Patton fan, but the comic was great! It was one of those issues that you read, and then instantly want to go back and read again. Great stuff, if you&apos;re into comics, you should check it out. It&apos;s been out for a couple of years, but should be available in backstock at your local comic book shop.
Sunday, I made the two and half hour trip to Battle Creek in just under five hours, courtesy of a car accident on route 131 south that backed traffic up for miles. I sat patiently while I watched cars and trucks pull u-turns across the divider and head back northbound, and after a wait made tolerable by calling home and talking to Pammey, we were moving again, and even though a light rain was falling, speeds were maintained and I pulled into Battle Creek in time to relax at the hotel a little, iron some clothes and get a nice shave &apos;n&apos; shower in before the 6:30 report time.
The show at Gary Fields&apos;s comedy club was to benefit Relay For Life, a presentation of the American Cancer Society, to raise funds for cancer research. The call out to volunteer for the show happened last November, and I threw my hat into the ring right away. I was awarded headliner status along with Bert &quot;Chili&quot; Challis, who I&apos;ve worked with three times already in this year that is only four months in the bag. Other comics who participated were Kate Brindle, Dave Glardon, Germaine Gebhard, Bob Stackhouse, Barry Fuller and organizer John Face. Gary Fields did the mc honors and opened the show with a nice presentation, and we were off to the races. Dave opened the show strong, with a longer feature set, followed by Germaine and Bob, who both impressed the crowd with very powerful performances. There were some new, emerging talents on the show, but no one that you would call &quot;rookie.&quot; The stage was set for me, and it was like taking candy from a baby. The show started late, and was long to begin with, so I did somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes and got off stage, after which they gave the audience a 10-minute intermission to use the bathroom, stretch their legs, or God forbid, smoke a cigarette outside. Which begs the question, who takes a cigarette break at a cancer benefit? That&apos;s some black comedy right there, for sure.
Matt Holt took the stage after the intermission, followed by sets from Barry Fuller and Kate Brindle, who had excellent audience response. Chili ended the show strong, and after everything was over, we shook hands, talked with folks who hung out afterwards, and posed for dozens of pictures. I signed audience programs and basically got more attention than I felt I deserved; I didn&apos;t volunteer for this because of the fame, I did it because cancer has touched my life in terms of two lost grandparents, a father who is a cancer survivor, and several friends who are also survivors. I voluteered for the event, and then worried about lining up work for the weekend after the fact, I felt so strongly about participating. Mark Kolo from Funny Business, the agency that books Gary Fields, was in attendance, and I hadn&apos;t seen him in nine or so years. It was nice to be able to hang around socially with someone that I do so much business with, as well as seeing Chili and Kate again, and meeting all the others for the first time, especially Dave who I&apos;ve had so much contact with via the comedian chat boards online. The rewards were there, even if I had to dig into my pocket for gas and lodging to get to Battle Creek to do the gig, which thanks to Hysterical Management (who books Traverse), I didn&apos;t.
The ride home was seven hours, a cakewalk through Canada thanks to the purchase of acouple of cans of sugar-free energy drink who&apos;s name escapes me. I was totally against the energy drinks when they first came out, it seemed like such a fad, and how could those things be any good, but I&apos;ve warmed up to them now that they come sugar-free. The taste is a little bit like over-carbonated Mountain Dew (I&apos;m not a fan), but I&apos;m sure through experimentation I&apos;ll find one that I like. The boost is really the draw for me, and two cans kept me up eight hours past my bedtime, and alert enough to navigate my way home in the dark. Not bad for three bucks, I say.
This week I&apos;m gearing up for headlining spots at the House of Comedy in Niagara Falls, and I&apos;m looking forward to it because it&apos;s close enough to drive up and back each night so I can spend some time at home, also I&apos;m working with comedy buddy Ray Salah, which is always a bonus. The money is short, but that&apos;s the trade-off you make I suffer next week with a haul out to Minot, North Dakota, which is forever and a day to get to. I should have tried to route it with the week in Moorehead, Minnesota, but I was so happy to get the work from a new agency that I didn&apos;t even look at the map. Next year I&apos;ll be prepared and plan ahead.
O.K., I&apos;m going to finish up here and get back to bed. I&apos;m only up because of daylight savings time and the sunlight streaming through my window. Am I the only one who thinks we should reset the clocks so that the sun doesn&apos;t rise until about 9:00 in the morning? Even that&apos;s too early, because I get up at noon, but I&apos;m thinking about the folks who have to punch a clock and be in during the &quot;working week.&quot; I pity those folks, and could never be one of them because I hate coffee, alarm clocks, and pretending to like the people I work with and for.
Have a Nice Day, and if you&apos;re reading this at work, get back to work, you slacker.

 Speed Demon (Keel) 
Posted on 04/28/2006 at 01:31 AM
I made it home, and it took me four days to get settled and sit down and update this little running commentary of my life on the road.
The road back from Minnesota took about 1300 miles, 23 hours, and one Minnesota speeding ticket. I got nailed going through St. Cloud, and the officer who issued the citation said he caught me going 85 in a 70 (which I was), but that he would only write me up for 14 over so I would get a lower fine and no points. I allegate that if the officer can just go ahead and reduce the charge on the spot, for no other reason than benevolence, than the whole thing should get thrown out. In no other area of law enforcement is there such a &quot;de facto&quot; reduction of charges...they just want the money!
I drove &apos;til I couldn&apos;t take it anymore, which was about 1 A.M. on Sunday night going into Monday morning, and I pulled over at a rest stop just outside of Cleveland, about three and a half hours from Rochester. I slept in the car, fogging up all the windows in the process, and woke up to flashing police car lights everywhere. I thought that I was somewhere I wasn&apos;t supposed to be, but come to find out, Ohio State Troopers had pulled over two guys in a Jimmy wagon. I used the facilities, started my car and headed on my way. I was thinking about some vending machine coffee or a diet Coke, but there was a shabby man near the vending who looked like a hitcher, he had three garbage bags full of what I assumed were clothing (what ever happened to the handkerchief on the end of a stick? Hobos are moving up to plastics, now!). Even with the cops over at the other end of the rest area, it was still dark out and I didn&apos;t want to risk a confrontation with a homeless guy. Hey, he&apos;s got nothing to lose, so I&apos;m not going to test him.
I finally got home around 7 in the morning, and slept like a dead man. My legs were sore, I was tired even though I had a two-hour nap, and my jaws were sore from chewing gum for 24 hours straight (peppermint keeps you awake, but chewing that much gum makes my temples ache).
I spent all week trying to get myself back together, and now I have to head back out again tomorrow to Traverse City, Michigan. I&apos;m taking the war wagon, which after 4,000 miles, has indicated that the two Toyota dealerships I took it to were trying to scare me into repairs that I wasn&apos;t financially ready to make. I do two days up in Traverse, and on Sunday, I make my way south to Battle Creek, Michigan, home of Gary Field&apos;s comedy club and the Relay For Life cancer benefit. I volunteered for this event months ago, and the lineup has changed several times, and now it looks like I&apos;ll be doing the first headlining spot, about 20 minutes, just before the intermission. I&apos;m hoping the event goes well, and will look forward to working with pals Chili Challis and Kate Brindle, as well as six or seven other new friends.
My home computer is in the shop, on the fritz with some sort of mecha-malady, so I&apos;m leaving the laptop home for the wife to use. I&apos;ll do the old-fashioned thing, hopping around to libraries and the like for internet use, and try to keep things fresh as far as the goings-on. Hopefully this will be a stress-free, satisfying weekend. I know that the drive home is only seven hours from Battle Creek, and I can probably do that without any problems.
Knock on wood, of course.

 Blood Sugar Sex Majik (Red Hot Chili Peppers) 
Posted on 04/23/2006 at 03:06 AM
Well, I&apos;m gearing up for the big drive home. The problem with long drives is that everyone has their own opinion of how long it&apos;s gonna take. Around here, the big burgs that people get headed to are Minneapolis/St. Paul and Chicago. My guess is that Chicago is 10 hours from here, and about 10 hours from home (counting the time difference from Central to Eastern Time).
Friday night, we had two good shows. Al got a standing ovation in Grand Forks, but they had lead in their asses in Fargo/Moorehead. I had two really good shows, Courtneys&apos; comedy club is a nice room in a small town, and with a little promotion, they could really build it up into a professional room. As it stands, I got middle money that trumps most of the middle pay that I work for, so I&apos;m not complaining.
Today, I had blood sugar problems, and for a little while, I thought I was dead. My hands and feet were cold and numb and I thought I had low blood sugar, so in my delerious state, I ate a pack of sugar and then tested my blood sugar, and come to find out it was high. I called Al in a panic (he has sugar issues, too) and he suggested to go to the workout room and sweat it out. I did 20 minutes on the treadmill, and my blood sugar started coming down. By showtime, 8:00 P.M., I was exhausted, but ready to go on stage. I did a by-the-numbers set first show, and then some folks stuck around for the second show, and it was a little sparse, so I opened up, tried some new things, and closed with a new bit that I wrote but never tried on stage before...it was risky, but they loved it, even though it was political in nature, and I was worried about red-state backlash. One old guy looked down and away, but all the younger people keyed in and it got an applause break. It&apos;s staying in the set! Now I have the problem that I have too much material and not enough time to do it night after night.
I have a 7:30 A.M. wake-up call, which is 8:30 east coast time, so I ought to get home at like 4:00 in the morning Sunday going into Monday. Pammey put Harmony on the phone and she talked to me between shows, and I ached like I never did to be home. The drive tomorrow should go quick, with that carrot dangling in front of me. Whether the car will cooperate and get me home is up to question, but I&apos;ll try it and take it as far as it goes. I got a feeling it&apos;s gonna make it, the weather is pretty cool so there&apos;s not much chance of overd-heating or any of that bad stuff, and not having AC isn&apos;t an issue, either.
Next week is my return to Traverse City, Michigan, and a cancer benefit on Sunday in Battle Creek. It&apos;s gonna be nice playing closer to home, but I really enjoyed my trip to Minnesota.
Have a safe weekend, and hope you get where you&apos;re going safe and sound.

 Two Story Town (Bon Jovi) 
Posted on 04/21/2006 at 11:59 AM
It&apos;s the last stop on the Ralph Tetta Badlands Tour &apos;06, Moorehead, Minnesota (sister city to Fargo, North Dakota) and I&apos;m counting down the hours until I hit that big black ribbon that takes me home to my family.
It was a short drive yesterday, 78 miles on route 29 south, with a 75 MPH speed limit...that&apos;s one thing that I learned about the upper plains...you can drive as fast as you want, because everything&apos;s a million miles away. One state over, Montana, has no daytime speed limit...90 MPH is o.k., the trooper just waves at you as you pass. Of course, the state&apos;s so big, you never see a trooper, I was just making that up.
We arrived at the Days Inn, home of Courtney&apos;s Comedy Club, and headliner Al Katz and I checked into our rooms. We got two rooms on the second floor, and I loaded up my luggage cart and headed for the elevator that wasn&apos;t there. Al chuckled at me as he took his one bag up the stairs, and I headed back to the desk to secure a first-floor room. They put me in a business King, which has a fridge and microwave, and I found out later that Al has neither of these, but he has the rack that would hold them, if such appliances were made available.
We dropped my car off at Corwin Toyota to see if they could do anything about my oil leak, which is dripping onto my timing belt, and they later called me and quoted me $500. They might as well have said they wanted to defile my mother on an altar under a full moon on my birthday in front of all my friends, because I was hearing none of that. All I was looking for was &quot;Mr. Tetta, you have a busted seal, we can repair it, it will take 5 minutes and cost $10.&quot; As soon as the guy said, &quot;Well, it&apos;s pretty complicated...&quot; all I heard was &quot;you&apos;re from out of town, so we&apos;re gonna make you grab your ankles.&quot; I&apos;ll take my chances...my wife is already looking at new cars.
I&apos;m gonna miss the Toyota...she&apos;s good on gas, engine purrs like a kitten, and even though the body is battered and bruised, she&apos;s taken me across the country more times than I can count. I&apos;ve been to Wisconsin four times, Florida three times, St. Louis at least twice, and so many times to Michigan I might as well get orange and blue license plates. I&apos;ve eaten about a thousand fast food meals in that car, slept, listened to thousands of hours of music, heard Presidential debates and news of planes hitting skyscrapers. I&apos;ve taken my daughter to the doctor, brought home Christmas presents, taken cats to the vet to say their final goodbyes, and cried a river of salty, homesick tears. It&apos;s going to be difficult letting go of the car and getting used to another one, but that&apos;s the way of the world. I feel like I&apos;ve done so much road work the last five years (5th anniversary comes up in June) that I&apos;ve spent more time in this car than I have in my own bed....and I probably have.
I respectfully declined the repairs and made arrangements to pick the car up today, which Al and I will do sometime before our radio interview at 2:30. We did laundry at a convenience store which had a laundromat in the back room, caught some quick dinner at Subway (the only place to eat within a short distance of the hotel), and returned to get ready for the 8:00 P.M. show.
The show was a mess, with no crowd being the biggest hurdle to overcome. I did my time, although it felt like I went over, and I burned the first few minutes trying to get people to move up. El, our host, seems like a funny guy, but I think that he hosts every week, so the locals have familiarity, and the contempt it breeds. One girl spent the whole show sending text messages on her phone. A lot of the guests were friends of the staff who were called to come out (at no charge) to beef up the dwindling attendance. Al did his thing, snapping a little at a drunk girl who wanted to participate in the show, and we broke camp afterwards to our respective rooms and the cable TV and wireless internet that they provided to insulate us from the post-show depression.
I talked to my wife for half an hour, and she scolded me about working so far from home when I told her about my plans to drive the 20 hours home on Sunday. I tried to explain that the money is so much better here than the work that is closer to home, and easier to get because I&apos;m not competing with the comics from New York, Boston and Philadelphia, but I think that the two-week separation was getting to her, too. I think sometimes that she&apos;d rather live in a refrigerator box and have me home than have me out here earning a living.
Sometimes I feel like that, too.

 Jumping Jack Flash (Rolling Stones) 
Posted on 04/20/2006 at 01:40 AM
Continuing the big tour through the Upper Midwest of America, last night was Walker, Minnesota and tonight was Grand Forks, North Dakota. Still working with Al Katz from Orlando, Florida, a longtime comedy buddy who used to work for me in Rochester when I was GM of the Comix Cafe.
Last night at the Northern Lights Casino, you would have thought we were the biggest prima donnas there ever was. We tried to get comps for the buffet (an industry standard for casino shows) and were roundly rebuffed. We wound up eating there anyway, and met the casino promotions director who was assigned to babysit us. We were told that the week before, the comedy show drew five people, and had been moved from the big special events room into the casino lounge. The show wound up not being that lousy, we started with four people and by the time the show was over, the crowd had swelled to about 35, more than enough to fill the seats in the lounge, and that&apos;s not counting the folks at the bar (who were listening and playing video poker at the same time, which is why I didn&apos;t count them).
The show was an early one, 7 PM, and was over by 8:30. I didn&apos;t know what to do with myself, so I hung around the casino snack bar and chatted with some of the employees and guests who had seen the show. I did a mind-reading trick with Lavonne, the cashier at the snack bar, while her manager/fiancee&apos; and some other employees looked on. I met some folks from International Falls, Minnesota, which is way up there near Canada. They were new grandparents on their way to St. Cloud, Minnesota to see their granddaughter, who was born premature and was only a little over a pound and still in an incubator. I met a woman who was also a grandmother, only she didn&apos;t look old enough to have accomplished such a feat. She was enjoying one of the casino&apos;s $3.50 hot dogs, and I was eating a $5.95 hamburger, and the whole time, I was looking for a board full of departure and arrival times just out of reflex.
Tonight was the Ramada Inn in Grand Forks, North Dakota...the show was well attended, mostly college-aged folks, and I had a great time. My half-hour whisked by quickly, and I abandoned a lot of material in favor of spritzing, which is becoming more natural and successful for me. I learned what I know by working so much with Mike Dambra, who is probably the quickest and funniest crowd-work comic I&apos;ve ever seen, but I had to work up the confidence to try that sort of thing myself. I&apos;ve found that you don&apos;t have to say the funniest possible line, as long as you spit it out quickly, with emphasis and conviction. I always used to take a few seconds to think about it, which to the audience looks like I&apos;m taking a few seconds to think about it. It&apos;s better to just lay it out there and if it lays flat, sling another line right behind it.
I met some interesting people after the show. One guy threw a Rochester Americans (our Triple A affiliate to the Buffalo Sabres NHL team) reference at me, and come to find out, he&apos;s Bill Bredin, the deputy commissioner of the United States Hockey League (www.ushl.com) and used to work with the National Hockey League. This is the second NHL-related person I&apos;ve met in the last month...the last one was a girl in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, who used to date Buffalo Sabres goalie Ryan Miller. I&apos;m not much of a hockey fan, but if I was, I guess I&apos;d be thrilled, but as it is, I&apos;m still intrigued. Still, I got into comedy because I like people, and I think it&apos;s neat to talk to people after the shows and see what they&apos;re all about. One guy was a rather portly young man in a &quot;Flash&quot; T-shirt...you usually don&apos;t think of the Fastest Man Alive and a 30-something kid with a beer gut in the same take, but here he was. I&apos;m a huge comic book fan, and have been collecting them for 30 years or more, and we were having a long conversation when Al decided he would &quot;save&quot; me by telling me I had a message at the front desk. It&apos;s an old ploy that we sometimes use when you&apos;re &quot;trapped&quot; in a conversation with a boring guest, but in this case, I was the one doing most of the talking so I don&apos;t understand why Al thought I needed saving, but I appreciated the effort. Al was talking with a couple of young ladies who saw the show, and I think they knew the guy I was talking to because he&apos;s a bartender at the local watering hole, and they may have put Al on the idea that I was gonna get my ear chewed off. It&apos;s nice to have people looking out for you, I guess.
Tomorrow, it&apos;s off to Moorehead, Minnesota (sister city to Fargo, North Dakota) for three days at the club there. This is one of the best paying weeks I&apos;ve ever worked since I started doing comedy on the road, but it&apos;s also the most nut-busting drives home that I&apos;ll have when I&apos;m finished. The actual drive is 20 hours, and I lose an hour because of the time difference between Central and Eastern time. I&apos;m wrestling with the dynamics of attempting the drive, because I don&apos;t want to have to get a hotel in the middle, but I also don&apos;t think I can do 20 hours straight driving without amphetamines. I will have the prospect of reuniting with my wife and daughter after two weeks on the road to spur me along, so that&apos;s good. I can&apos;t wait to see them again. When I called home after the show tonight, Pam answered in a whisper because Harmony was sleeping and she didn&apos;t want to wake her, and all I could think of is my baby daughter in the crib, my wife hovering over her, watching her and caring for her, and feeling like the luckiest guy in the world. They are worth what I put myself through, the long drives and the smoky one-nighters. I do my shows to earn money, and I earn the money to make a nice life for them. When I started this comedy game almost 18 years ago, it was all about me and my glory, and now it&apos;s all about their comfort and security. It&apos;s nice to have a reason for doing what you do, it keeps you focused and honest.
Enough for today. I&apos;m going to finish my Sudoku puzzle and catch some zzzz&apos;s. I&apos;ll check in with you again tomorrow, and thanks for reading me.

 Ten Miles From Nowhere (Five For Fighting) 
Posted on 04/18/2006 at 01:11 AM
Good evening from Thief River Falls, Minnesota, home of the Black Cat Tavern, the Best Western, and not much else. Seriously, the biggest town close by to here is Grand Forks, North Dakota, and the town is 56 miles away from Manitoba, Canada, which is by far the most desolate of the inhabited Canadian provinces. O.K., maybe that&apos;s not fair, but even if I&apos;m wrong, what&apos;s the difference? There is fuck all up here in Northern Minnesota, and the horizon only offers the promise of more nothing.
Easter Sunday I drove 820 miles, dreamt of chocolate and felt sorry for myself. I didn&apos;t have any unscheduled improptu automobile maintenance to deal with, knock on wood, and after the first 200 miles, my sphincter loosened up and I was able to drive like a young person instead of a grandmother on her way to bingo. I wound up bunking in the town of Tomah, Wisconsin, which was my goal, and today I had a solid 480 miles to drive through some of the most desolate country I&apos;ve ever seen.
My engine was a little low on oil so I added a couple of quarts that I had the foresight to pick up at a Wal-Mart on the way...you never know on those holiday weekends if you&apos;re going to find synthetic oil anywhere, and I didn&apos;t want to get caught out of position. Bad stuff, that blowing your engine because you don&apos;t have any oil in it. I&apos;ve done that with two other cars, and it&apos;s no good for anyone, I can tell you.
I got to Thief River Falls just a few minutes after headliner Al Katz, and we did the pal-around thing, having dinner together at the club (half-off employee discount...can&apos;t go wrong with that) and then retired back to our rooms to freshen up and get ready. We almost wore the same shirt, which I find hysterical...we both shop the Casual Male, as they cater to the well-dressed fat man, and the deal is that I get to wear the shirt tomorrow in Walker, Minnesota at the casino. He also had a version of the shirt I was wearing tonight, a black button-up with a check pattern.
The show tonight was well enough attended, but didn&apos;t live up to the earlier billing. We were expecting a crowd of just under 100, and we wound up with just under 50. They were good and attentive, which is what you want from a crowd at a comedy show. I&apos;d rather have 50 people focused in on what I&apos;m saying vs. 300 people who could give a shit. Ultimately, this was an extra show...I couldn&apos;t tell you the last time I worked on a Monday, so it was nice getting the one-nighter bread up front. For the record, the last Monday I worked was September 26, 2005 in Lexington, Nebraska. I guess it&apos;s my lot in life to bring the funny to people in tiny, desolate towns on off-nights. Still, I fill a niche, and that&apos;s the first step to success!
More updates as the week wears on.

 Four Cars Ago (Tim Wilson) UPDATED! 
Posted on 04/16/2006 at 09:39 AM
The trail of tears beckons, and I don&apos;t want to go.
Good morning, and Happy Easter, Passover, or just plain ol&apos; Sunday if that&apos;s what you choose. I&apos;m getting ready to shake the dust of Knoxville, Tennessee from my feet and make my way to Thief River Falls, Minnesota, for my show tomorrow night. Only I don&apos;t wanna go.
On Friday, I took my Toyota Corolla, current mileage 292,000+, in to a Toyota dealership to get the air conditioning recharged. Only it didn&apos;t work out that way. Apparently, the AC is shot, there&apos;s about $300 worth of parts that need replacing, and it&apos;s just not in the budget to do that. Also, I laughed a little when the mechanic asked me if I was driving near the ocean because he saw all the salt on my engine...that&apos;s road salt from New York snow removal...I guess they don&apos;t see that in Tennessee...they told me that when it does snow, they spray the roads with brine ahead of time. I guess it must work.
Regardless, the prognosis was that not only am I not getting air conditioning, which may be uncomfortable until I head significantly north, but apparently there&apos;s oil on my timing belt, which isn&apos;t good. If the timing belt goes, the whole car stops, which is what happened to my good buddy Steve Burr the last time we worked together. I have a 1,283 mile drive ahead of me over the next two days, and I&apos;m not enjoying the idea that my car might not be there for the whole trip. If I can make it home, I can probably get it repaired, if that&apos;s the route I want to go, but I don&apos;t want to have to get repairs done on the road...I won&apos;t have a choice of mechanic, and it will probably throw my whole schedule off. The way I figure it, I have to drive 10 hours or more over two days, and the more miles I drive today, Easter Sunday, the fewer I have to drive tomorrow. My route takes me through several big cities, including Louisville, Kentucky, Indianapolis, Indiana, Chicago, Illinois, Madison, Wisconsin, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. If there are problems, I have AAA and can get towed, I only hope that if I break down, I break down 100 miles from a major city (AAA&apos;s towing limit). I really hope that I just finish the tour and get home, to be honest, but I have to prepare for the worst.
The shows on Friday and Saturday were excellent, the only downside being that when you open for a celebrity comedian, as I did this past weekend with Tim Wilson, you usually get your time cut back so the big name draw guy can do his thing. I put out the hottest 20 minute sets I could, and got really great crowd response and merchandise sales to match. I actually ran out of DVD&apos;s, but I still have a decent number of CD&apos;s for the trip up North. The money will actually help if I have to do any emergency road repairs, but I&apos;d rather bring the money home.
Tim was great to work with this week...he had his wife with him, so he wasn&apos;t really available during the day to hang around with, but he was friendly, cordial and complimentary between and after the shows. He gave props from the stage, which is flattering and unnecessary, but it&apos;s nice to hear that your headliner likes you and publicly acknowledges that.
Mark Craycraft, the new manager at the Knoxville Comedy Zone, runs a tight ship and everything went well all weekend. I got scolded a couple of times for being in the office while the box office was trying to take phone reservations and sell tickets, which I thought was a little over the top, but I vacated when asked. The rest of the staff were great, and it&apos;s always a pleasure coming back to this club.
Chad Riden, our mc for the week, finally made it from Nashville after having car troubles of his own, and on Saturday we hooked up for lunch. He&apos;s a funny guy and a good mc, and he took the bullet from a couple of rowdy crowds over the weekend. You don&apos;t really appreciate that mc job until you start middling and think &quot;thank God I didn&apos;t have to go first.&quot;
O.K., it&apos;s time to hit the showers and start packing out. Wish me luck as I head North, and I&apos;ll keep you posted on my progress.

UPDATE!
After 800 miles and 14 hours in the car, I&apos;ve landed at the EconoLodge in Tomah, Wisconsin. I still have another 480 miles to drive tomorrow, but that&apos;s only 6 or 7 hours...no problem for one such as me. Big thank-you&apos;s to everyone who wrote concerned about my well-being.

 Stay Cool (The Roots) 
Posted on 04/14/2006 at 12:29 PM
Good afternoon from Knoxville, Tennessee, home of the Comedy Zone, one of my favorite clubs in the country. I&apos;m working this week with celebrity headliner Tim Wilson, who is very big here in the south, but to be honest, being from upstate New York, I never heard of him. Still, he draws big crowds and they pay the money, so more power to him. Our mc, Chad Riden, broke down on the way here from Nashville, so I had to do the mc/middle thing on Wednesday. It went o.k., not great, and it was a weird little crowd, and even Tim, who indicated he was going to do an hour, bailed on them after 45 minutes.
The Econolodge where the Comedy Zone comics stay (although I don&apos;t think Tim is staying here) is right down the parking lot from the club, so it&apos;s very convenient. Also, there&apos;s a supermarket really close to here, a post office, a library, and everything else a travelling comic could want. There&apos;s even a Chinese Buffet across the street! I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve moved more than 2 miles from the hotel since I got here Wednesday afternoon. I&apos;m thinking about getting a haircut (the salon is next to the buffet) and today I&apos;m getting my car&apos;s air conditioning recharged (it&apos;s butt-ass hot down here and having no AC is making me cranky)...the Toyota dealership is like 4 miles away. It&apos;s perfect!
Yet again, the last two nights, as the entire month before, every show I&apos;ve done, people have come up to me after the show and indicated that they&apos;re either from western New York or they have relatives that live there. It&apos;s been a little erie, actually. I sold a CD last night to a guy who was lamenting the loss of Wegmans and Nick Tahoes and Country Sweet Chicken and Ribs, all Rochester staples. I came up with a funny line about southern cooking that I think is going to be a regular part of my act when I tour the south...I ad-libbed a bit and it got a big laugh, and I think it will do well in other southern markets, too...Greensboro, North Carolina in particular.
I did a little hotel-room cooking last night, franks &apos;n&apos; beans done wok-style, courtesy of a late-night shopping trip to Food City. I signed up for their value card and saved some decent cash on my foods, which is always a good thing. With the gas up around 2.56 a gallon here in eastern Tennessee, every penny counts.
Don&apos;t forget that taxes are due on Monday....last chance to file an extension is today. Have a great weekend!

 Freeway Jam (Jeff Beck) 
Posted on 04/12/2006 at 06:45 AM
I&apos;ve been dodging bullets for a week now, and I&apos;d like it to stop, please.
Coming to you live from my tastefully appointed hotel room at the Quality Inn in Huntersville, North Carolina, just outside of Charlotte, and just a few minutes away from heading down the hallway to enjoy the complimentary continental breakfast (the comic on a budget&apos;s friend).
I didn&apos;t report last weekend&apos;s wrap-up, because there wasn&apos;t much to say. Saturday&apos;s show was sparsely attended, and our mc was 16 years old...I joked that he looked like Steve from Blue&apos;s Clues (and he did). I presented my set with a slower, more conversational delivery, and it was just right for the situation, and after club owner Jonathan Dean Belt paid me, he invited me back in August. Unfortunately, I won&apos;t be able to come, as I&apos;m already booked for my yearly excursion to Florida to see my parents.
Sunday was wrap-up day, trying to get things done before having to leave Tuesday morning for a two-week trek across America. Pam and I (o.k., mostly Pam) rifled through medical receipts getting everything ready for a 10 A.M. appointment with tax preparer Mark Block. Mark and I worked together in the popular Joey and Maria&apos;s comedy wedding shows in Rochester, and it was nice to see him again. He worked his magic and got us a sizable tax refund, and also by looking at last year&apos;s return (which Pammey painstakingly filed using H.R. Block&apos;s online resources) that we also had a sizable refund due to us as well. Pam used schedule &quot;A&quot; instead of schedule &quot;C&quot; or some such folderol like that...I failed Accounting twice, so all of this is lost on me.
An oil change later, some laundry and some other basic house maintenance, and I was ready to hit the rack for a 5 A.M. wake up. Sleep came tough, but the show must go on, and I woke up, showered and packed and hit the road. I had a 700 mile, 11 hour drive in front of me to make it to the Lake Norman Comedy Zone and an 8 P.M. show with headliner Robert York. I headed south through New York and was taking route 15 thorugh Pennsylvania, looking to hook up with I-81, and suddenly, without warning, a traffic jam sprung up. The Pennsylvania D.O.T. had actually coned off the lane and was detouring traffic away from rout 15...I was sent down route 80 east, and then to 81 south, a 100 mile detour that added about 90 minutes to my drive. I still wound up getting to the hotel just a little before 7:00 P.M., time enough to shave and shower and make the gig, but when I tell you I didn&apos;t have much juice left in my battery, I&apos;m not kidding. I had a decent but uneven set, and the crowd responded appropriately. They were very young, and overwhelmingly female, and a birthday party of about 20 college-aged girls dominated the show with unrelenting table talk and general lack of attention. I did my time and got out, and let Robert York get up there and crack his bullwhip and juggle his rings around. I&apos;ve seen that guy about 40 times, and I still enjoy watching him.
John, the manager at Galway Hooker&apos;s (yeah, that&apos;s the name of the club) paid us by check, which was annoying, but the bank is right across the street from the hotel so that will be my first stop today. I have a four-hour drive to Knoxville, Tennessee, my home for the next four days, where I&apos;m opening for big name guy (in the South, anyway) Tim Wilson. I&apos;m anxious about the shows, and excited to go back to the Comedy Zone there. The last time I was there, I had a great time and was pleasantly surprised at how receptive the audience was to me. It&apos;s been 17 months since I was there last, and that&apos;s about 9 months too long, if you ask me. But the club&apos;s so popular with comics that there&apos;s a waiting list to get booked back! I&apos;m just glad to be working, to be honest.
I miss my wife and my daughter, I started missing them when I closed our apartment door and starting heading down the steps. I&apos;ll be away for Easter, and won&apos;t be getting home until a week from Monday. Next week is my first engagement from Ken Muller and Comedy Productions, so I&apos;m excited about that, too, and hope that I can make a favorable first impression.
O.K., coffee and cereal await. I&apos;ll probably stick with decafe so I can sleep some more. I&apos;ll keep you updated as the tour progresses. Thank you for reading and have a good one.

 T.V. Party (Black Flag) 
Posted on 04/08/2006 at 02:56 AM
www.myspace.com/rabidralph C&apos;mon, you know you want to!
I&apos;ve been bitching to my wife for the last six months that I need a T.V. credit to beef up my resume. I guess the moral to today&apos;s story is &quot;Watch out what you wish for, you just might get it.&quot;
I&apos;m playing Fat Katz Comedy Club in Utica, NY, exit 31 off the New York State Thruway if you&apos;re counting, working with Mike Dambra, one of my best friends in the business and a damn funny headliner. I&apos;d played Fat Katz a couple of times before, but hadn&apos;t been here since the club changed hands. It is now being handled by Jonathan Dean Belt, a comic from Syracuse, NY, that I worked with about 15 years ago.
This week, the plan was to tape our 8:00 P.M. show for broadcast on a FOX affiliate station here in Utica, to bump up club attendance. They figured that Mike was a damn funny comic, and hence, his act would draw the masses back to the club (open as it is under the new management).
We were greeted by Jonathan with hugs all around, and then it was down to business. He wanted me to perform an 8-9 minute set, take a break, and then Mike would do a 10-12 minute set for the audience in attendance. Then there would be an intermission, the cameras would be turned off, and we would go back up and finish our feature and headliner times, respectively. We both bristled, not wanting to burn our funniest material up front, and then have to go back up to a crowd who had basically just seen us. The other problem, for me, was that I would basically have to follow Mike&apos;s funniest material. I wasn&apos;t looking forward to that. After a few discussions with Jonathan and Jason, the video production guy, we talked them into just letting us do our full sets, and then edit for the show from that footage. It made more sense, really, and would have been way more comfortable for both of us.
The show didn&apos;t get started until 8:30, and I didn&apos;t find my way onstage until about 9:10. Most of the crowd (about 50 in all) had been there since 7:30, so they were antsy, to say the least. I rattled off a 22-minute set (which is what you get out of me when you ask for 20 minutes), and headed next door to the pizza place to get a submarine sandwich. The guys who own the sub shop used to own the comedy club, and they would feed the comics. I didn&apos;t get a free ride on the sub, but the kid behind the counter remembered me and I got a 25% discount, which isn&apos;t shabby and was much appreciated.
I walked back across the parking lot and back into the club&apos;s front bar, where I enjoyed my sandwich and listened to Mike&apos;s act. He was doing well, but not really holding back on language for the T.V. taping...I definitely tried to sanitize my set, wanting to give them the most usefull footage as possible. I also wrangled a deal guaranteeing a DVD copy of the show while signing the waiver, and got Mike the same deal as well. After the show, the video team told me that they thought most of my act would make it into the final cut of the T.V. show because it was more &quot;family friendly&quot; than Mike&apos;s material, and while I don&apos;t revel in that at Mike&apos;s expense, I&apos;m looking forward to seeing the material edited into a three-camera shot. It might make for a nice new demo tape that I could send around to club bookers, and that&apos;s always a good thing to have.
Tonight, things go back to normal, and we get to just do our shows as we want, and the crowd should be bigger as well. It&apos;s a nice club, and they&apos;re still doing some work on it, but they&apos;ve improved it quite a bit. One thing they still need to do is get some doors for the toilet stalls in the men&apos;s rooms....curtains just don&apos;t cut it when you&apos;re pinching a loaf in a public place. C&apos;mon, Breeze! Plywood is cheap over at Home Depot....all you need is some hinges and a barrel latch. I&apos;ll come over early and do the work!
&apos;Course, then I&apos;ll have to stink up your men&apos;s room...you know, just to make sure the doors are steady and secure during use.
Have a good weekend!

 Shock The Monkey (Peter Gabriel) 
Posted on 04/06/2006 at 01:22 AM
When I carry around baggage, I really carry it around...I have moments of embarassment dating back to third grade that I remember vividly and play in my head like noxious little music videos without the music when I&apos;m laying in bed and the room is dark but my eyes are wide enough to count the veins in my eyelids.
One of my more recent embarassments was a corporate Christmas party that I did for a group of engineers. It didn&apos;t go as well as planned, and I severely underestimated their playfulness, and was rewarded with a group of staring, condemning faces. I was pretty sure I&apos;d never take another corporate gig again.
Then I got a call from the Transportation Council of the Rochester Business Alliance to be the keynote speaker for their 82nd annual dinner. My father was a shipping supervisor for almost 40 years, so these were my people. I accepted the gig, and peformed tonight at the Downtown Hyatt Hotel here in my hometown of Rochester. The gig went swimmingly, and I had a great time. The major difference was that I worked up a set list before I went up, so I didn&apos;t have to edit and scramble in my head if a bit fell short. I had confidence, I was organized, and I got the presentation to end by 9:00 P.M...the organizer&apos;s plan. The monkey is officially off my back.
The nice thing about the show was that there were many folks in attendance who knew my father and worked with him and remembered him well, and that was a nice ice breaker for me. I actually got set up, and the President of the Transportation Council apologized...just before my keynote address, they gave a posthumous award to a man who had died of cancer, along with a presentation of a plaque to his widow, a tear-jerker of a testimonial, and a standing ovation. And now, your funny guy! I don&apos;t mean to pat myself on the back, but I think I got through it well. I acknowledged the situation, and made the transition to the ha-ha&apos;s, mentioning my father and then dovetailing that into some jokes and stories.
I have a day off, and then it&apos;s off to Utica, NY, where I&apos;ve already had a day shaved off of the week (and the money that went along with it), but the corporate show is providing the bank for this week, and Utica is just sprinkles on the ice cream.
It&apos;s an early day tomorrow, Harmony has an appointment, so it&apos;s off to bed. Here&apos;s hoping that you give your monkey the slip as easily as I did mine.

 You Can&apos;t Put Your Arms Around A Memory (Guns &apos;N&apos; Roses) 
Posted on 04/02/2006 at 02:56 PM
What&apos;s worse than losing a precious gift? Probably, never having it in the first place. But definitely, being tricked sucks the worst of all.
Corning, NY, home of the Corning glass works and Fat Cats blues &apos;n&apos; jazz club, home of the Friday night comedy show that was watered down like a pack of Kool Aid thrown into a swimming pool, is over now, and just a memory. Washed away by a two-hour drive home and a good night&apos;s sleep, I can talk about it.
As previously chronicled, Friday&apos;s show was considerably less than somewhat, artistically and in audience response...I&apos;m no com to be entertaining the old folks. They&apos;re patient with me, but I never get off the ground with them, their frame of reference just isn&apos;t playful enough to enjoy me. I&apos;ll pull every trick out of the bag, sight gags, book jokes, and Don Rickles-style abuse, but somewhere along the line, I can&apos;t shake the feeling that they think I should be delivering their newspaper or something.
I slept in Saturday, to be good and rested for the night driving after the show. A trip to a comic book shop that was closed turned into a good thing; I found a newsstand with an old creaky metal comic book rack, and several copies of Marvel&apos;s &quot;Exiles&quot; title to be had, to finish up a two-part story I&apos;d been looking forward to. Dumb luck, providence and the good Lord smile every once in a blue moon.
A trip to Wegman&apos;s (thank God for Wegman&apos;s) and a nice roast beef sub with their new special horseradish mayonnaise, and I was back to the Best Western to kill another five hours until showtime. Unfortunately, I spent part of that time talking with my wife on the phone about the bastard family that lives next door to us...there was a verbal altercation Friday afternoon regarding some of their crap that found it&apos;s way onto our front lawn, and my mother-in-law who lives downstairs from us took it upon herselfto throw the crap out. The thugs that live next door, whom we&apos;ve never liked, threatened my wife&apos;s mother, and said something to my wife as she left to go out with our daughter. Of course, she had no clue what the neighbors were talking about, so she let it go, and then when Mama Davis filled her in, she felt a little threatened and scared. Once upon a time, Rochester Police reported seizing a sawed-off shotgun from one of the three apartments next door to us, so you never know what surprises there are to pop out at any moment. It&apos;s no way to live, and I certainly don&apos;t appreciate these people speaking to anyone in my family, especially when I&apos;m miles (and hours) away.
I strolled in to Fat Cat&apos;s just a little before showtime, anxious to get the whole evening over with and get in the car and head home, if nothing else, to reassure my wife that she was somewhat protected. The neighbors aren&apos;t very confrontational when I&apos;m home, and have never said anything to me. I think they know that I&apos;ve read enough Batman comics that I could chill their blood just by looking at them, although I&apos;ve never tried it. I&apos;m only hoping that if push came to shove, I could dodge bullets like Batman, but criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot, and when they&apos;re afraid, they fire their weapons blindly and with no accuracy, so I&apos;ve got that going for me.
I had a brief conversation with the owner&apos;s wife, and I mentioned that I was going to be splitting after showtime, because of the situation back home. She asked me if I checked out of the hotel, and I told her no, because I was there all day and if I had checked out, at noon, or whatever check out time the Best Western offered, I would have had to sit in my car all day, and wouldn&apos;t have had anywhere to shower and get ready for the 8:00 P.M. show.
The show was decently attended, not as full as last night, but a more public show and a group of people I felt I didn&apos;t have to censor myself for. I had a loose, fluid feel, was good and funny, and got some nice results. At one point, I ditched the microphone, to give the theatrical illusion that I was about to reveal some truths that were &quot;just between you and me,&quot; and I really didn&apos;t need the mic, because there were only about 50 people in the room, and they could hear me fine. Hans, the owner, who also doubles as the mc, went up after me and ribbed me a little bit about not using the mic, that he had rented it and I didn&apos;t wind up using it. I used it for much of the show, I just ditched it for the last 10 or 15 minutes. Hans has a weird way of saying something where you don&apos;t know if he&apos;s joking or not...I don&apos;t care for it very much, but the gig was only two days, so you suffer it and move on.
Miss Gayle went and did her thing, and I retired to the first floor for a complimentary food item. I enjoyed a plate of chicken salad-stuffed tomatoes, a modestly priced menu item, as I don&apos;t like to abuse the food and beverage privilege when a club extends it to me...I think it&apos;s only respectful. At the bar, I struck up a conversation with a young lady who had seen my performance last night and liked it. She was a medical person, a nurse, and she was there with one of her friends who was playing in the blues band that was to perform later in the evening. The girls in the band had a severe Indigo Girls thing going, but I don&apos;t wish to cast any aspersions, everyone was pleasant enough, and then I realized that I virtually opened my Friday show with a joke that could be conceived as gay-bashing, but apparently, no umbrage was taken, because the girl probably wouldn&apos;t have started the conversation with me if she were gay (which I can&apos;t be certain of) and took offense at my joke (which she may or may not have, and was just talking with me to be polite). Luckily, I didn&apos;t put two and two together until just now, or I&apos;m certain I would have been embarrassed and said something untoward in the purpose of being apologetic.
After a few minutes, I headed back upstairs, where Miss Gayle was still doing her thing, and got ready for the closing of the show, the settling up of payment, and the road home. I had already packed my car, so I didn&apos;t even need to go back to the hotel, and I was anxious to knot things up and shove off. We shook hands with the audience on the way out, and I actually had a young lady ask me if I had performed at the Hilton in Elmira, just a few miles down route 86, a couple of years ago, and I had, and was surprised that she remembered me! It was actually October 11-12, 2002, and I can tell you that because I keep my engagement books back that far-how anal can you get?
So Miss Gayle and her husband and I head on downstairs while Hans is getting our checks ready. I hate check gigs...if the check&apos;s no good, you&apos;re hundreds of miles away when you find out, particularly when they hand it to you on Saturday, and you can&apos;t cash it until Monday. For the second time in a month, the check was drawn on my bank, so I didn&apos;t worry too much about it, I just headed back to Rochester and deposited it. But in the handing off of the check and the obligatory hand-shaking and thank-you&apos;s, Hans started asking me if I was driving home or if I was staying the night. I again replied that I was heading home, and he informed me that he paid for two nights, and didn&apos;t say it, but sounded like somehow I was wasting his money by not staying.
Now, if this gig had only been one night, believe me, I would have driven down and driven back, and had no problems with it. But it&apos;s 120 miles from my club to his house, and the money just wasn&apos;t good enough to drive down and back twice. So I stayed over Friday night into Saturday morning, and after the second show, made my plans to drive home. I still used the room all day Saturday...like I said before, if I checked out, I&apos;d be homeless for the day and have to sit in my car. If I slept over and left at 6:00 in the morning, he&apos;d still have to pay for the room, if I left at 3:00 in the morning, he&apos;d still have to pay for the room. If I choose to leave at 10:00 at night, isn&apos;t that my prerogative? Isn&apos;t the room part of my compensation? I apologized, pleading that I didn&apos;t mean to step on any toes, but what else was I to do? He shook my hand, and said that he hoped I&apos;d be back, that I did a good job, but with that tone of his that you don&apos;t know if he&apos;s breaking your balls or not. I drove home in a huff.
I picked up some food on the way home, and my wife and I ate at the kitchen table while I recounted the evening and read the paper. She finished and left to go check on the baby, and I picked up SPIN magazine, where the coup de grace happened. I was reading the mag, and looking how decidedly un-cool I was...I don&apos;t know any of the bands in this magazine. It&apos;s a by-product of being a shade under 40, and compounded by being a radio veteran...I used to be the hippest guy around to new bands in almost every genre, now I don&apos;t know the Strokes from my earlobe. The SPIN top 15, for example...I&apos;ve heard of Warren G. and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, but I&apos;ve never &quot;heard&quot; them... the other bands are a fog of college-rock pretentiousness to me. C.L. Smooth? Sufjan Stevens? Art Brut? I&apos;m lost.
So then I head off to the reviews section, and Chuck Klosterman has a review of Guns &apos;N&apos; Roses &quot;Chinese Democracy.&quot; After 15 years, the wait is over! I read the piece hungrily, not realizing what a GNR fan I was, and the review was pretty amazing. I had to get this CD just to read the liner notes, never mind what the album sounded like! And how had I missed the news that a new Guns album was coming out, anyway?
Because it ain&apos;t At the very end of the review, there&apos;s a little sidebar box with five &quot;Fast Facts&quot; about the album, the last fact being that the record doesn&apos;t exist, only in an alternate universe where the &quot;Fools of April&quot; rule. I&apos;d been had! And I laughed and felt good for the first time in the whole weekend. I actually got the April Fool&apos;s joke on the actual April Fool&apos;s Day, and I felt good about it.
This week, I got a nice-paying corporate show and a weekend in Utica, NY, my third New York State gig in three weeks, and I&apos;m happy to be home (or close to it) before my big road trip to Tennessee, then no break before I have to go to Minnesota. April should fly by almost as quick as March did, and hopefully with fewer car accidents, speeding tickets, and bitchy club owners.
I know this was a particularly long-winded entry, but thanks for hanging in with me on my emotional roller coaster. Have a good week.

What&apos;s better than being met in the parking lot by a club owner, sweating and wringing his hands, ready to recite a grocery list of things you can&apos;t say on stage?
The gig this weekend is Fat Cats, a hot little jazz club in downtown Corning, NY. Pretty easy on the face of it, working with Miss Gayle out of Pittsburgh, PA. She brought along her husband, who I affectionately called &quot;Mr. Gayle,&quot; and we carpooled to the gig. Hans, the club owner, had a retirement party booked for the comedy show, so we had to be on our best behavior. It was a &quot;blue hair&quot; room...no salty language, overt topicality, or crowd abuse. God, I felt like a neutered slave, but a gig&apos;s a gig, and tomorrow, hopefully it&apos;ll be more of a public show, with fewer language restrictions and a little more fun. I can&apos;t complain too much...the club put a free meal behind us (always a nice touch) and the hotel is good (re: free high-speed internet access in the room).
The show went fine enough, and afterwards, it was back to the hotel for a little HBO. Is this the best job in the world, or what? Even when the gig sucks, I can&apos;t help but remember that half a million Mexicans just marched for the right to come to this country and clean hotel rooms and pick vegetables. My people, the Italians, came to this country and did the crap jobs like pushing carts in the street, crushing grapes for wine with their feet, and let&apos;s face it, numbers don&apos;t run themselves.
I haven&apos;t adjusted to the warm snap in the weather...it feels like we didn&apos;t even get a winter this year, which is fine and dandy with me. I sweat today like a runaway slave looking at a tree with moss on all four sides of it.
Maybe tomorrow I&apos;ll offer up an update with some pointed political commentary or just make with the chuckles. Hope your weekend is nice.

 Bring It On Home (Led Zeppelin) 
Posted on 03/26/2006 at 08:09 PM
Dear Penthouse Forum,
I&apos;ve read your letters for years, but I never thought it could happen to me.....
Finishing up the weekend at Wiseacre&apos;s Comedy Club in Tyson&apos;s Corners, Virginia, I can say that it was a very good week. I made some new friends, got in contact with some established acquaintances, and had some good shows (on Saturday, to go along with the subpar situation on Friday).
Headliner John Marks turned out to be quite the draw, with a good number of his family and friends from the area in attendance for the 8:00 Saturday show. I cleaned up my act a little, wanting to set the stage well for him, and wound up having a good time. There were some folks from the Rochester area who identified themselves early in my show, and we had a cute little give &apos;n&apos; take with that. The room was hot, being packed with so many people, and I came off stage sweating like Marion Barry with a coupon for Arm&amp;Hammer baking soda.
Second show, it was a relatively sparse crowd, with a lot of college-aged folks and I took the opportunity to cut loose. For some reason, there were a number of cute girls in the 5&apos; 2&quot; height range who couldn&apos;t resist the opportunity to hug yours truly after the show. My wife is 5&apos; 2&quot;, so maybe it&apos;s just a short girl thing, but I enjoyed the attention nonetheless. I told one girl that she was so cute, I wanted to take her on Spring Break to Arubua. It got the laugh, which is all I was looking for.
Before showtime, I got a call from comedy buddy Annette Lorenzo, who was off on tour in Pennsylvania for Hysterical Management. Annette was a replacement act for a room down there, and when she showed up at the hotel, they didn&apos;t have a reservation for her, because she wasn&apos;t the original act. I assured her that unless the booker made a big mistake and double booked, the best thing to do, since the other guy wasn&apos;t there, was to explain the situation to the desk person at the hotel, check into the room, and if the other guy showed up, pay for the room and sort it out later. As it stood, the other guy did indeed not show up, Annette got herself settled in and had a good show. A mentor&apos;s job is never done.
The ride home overnight wasn&apos;t bad...I was bound and determined not to get stuck in D.C./Baltimore beltway traffic, which is horrible during all daylight hours. It still took me the better part of seven hours to make it home, and I rolled into my driveway about 20 minutes to eight. I have a feeling that if I left this morning, even early, I wouldn&apos;t have fared anywhere near as well. I got about four hours of sleep before my family started to interfere with me, and I got another couple of hours in before I decided that it was too sunny and bright to sleep. I&apos;m pretty tired, but functioning, which is good because Pam and I still have our income taxes to prepare and file, and I&apos;m not a fan of waiting until just down to the wire, especially because we have money coming back this year.
This week is a little weekend jaunt to Corning, New York, courtesy of Summit Comedy, where I&apos;ll be performing with Miss Gayle out of Pittsburgh, PA. We&apos;ve worked together before, and she&apos;s a sweet lady and a good comic. It&apos;s not a big-paying gig, but I&apos;ve figured out a long time ago that I&apos;m not in this business for the money, so it&apos;s nice to at least be able to work with nice people.
I hope your week is low-pressure, high satisfaction and that money is not the object. Enjoy your friends, family, and all of the good things in life that you can&apos;t put a price tag on, including enjoying what you do.

 My Old School (Steely Dan) 
Posted on 03/25/2006 at 01:55 PM
Who is George Mason and why did I drop my pants on stage for him?
Reporting from the Best Western in Tyson&apos;s Corners, Virginia, home of the fabulous Wiseacres Comedy Club, just outside of Washington, D.C. Last night, I worked with headliner John Marks, mc Jessica Pacquin, and we were treated to a guest spot by local hero Clay Miles. Before the show, they had the NCAA Men&apos;s Basketball tournament on the big screen TV, specifically, George Mason University, which I had honestly only heard of once or twice, but come to find out it&apos;s a big deal around these parts. When Leonardo, one of the hotel&apos;s restaurant managers, told the audience that the TV would have to be turned off (honestly, a half hour before showtime....why not just poke the people with hot sticks while you&apos;re at it?), they rebelled like Iraqi dissidents. I mean, they literally declared Jihad, threw stones, and burned American flags. I&apos;m kidding. They didn&apos;t declare Jihad.
So, mustering all of the ex-club manager skills at my possession, I suggested that they keep the TV on until 15 minutes before, and let them watch a little longer. The crowd cheered, and were amenable that a compromise had been reached. Still, during the show, somebody had the scores delivered to his cell phone and was giving the faithful periodic updates. George Mason U. actually won the game while I was on stage, and in order to maintain some semblance of attention, I was doing my &quot;prairie fire&quot; show...I was all over the board, riffing, stream-of-consciousness and pooching out lines and chunks of material, quickly and never letting up on the crowd. I stood on chairs, dropped my pants, and one woman tried tipping me a cigarette because she didn&apos;t have any single dollar bills. Cheap whore!
I thought I was over, but I actually hit 30 minutes right on the money. The young locals patted me on the back, shook my hand and congratulated me on such a good set, when in fact, it was anything but a good set. It was undisciplined, full of filler and completely throwaway. Although, I did a minute or two on a guy in the front row with long hair who I called Ted Nugent&apos;s illegitimate child, and it was funny enough that I might try to remember what I said for recycling purposes. I would have rather done my regular show, but there were so many table conversations going on, it was clear that it was just going to be a fight to be heard, and I don&apos;t function well. I wound up calling out a table of three women who were among the loudest groups in the room, and they wound up getting thrown out during the headliner&apos;s set.
John Marks is a funny guy, but he&apos;s also a quiet, dignified kind of comic, and he was shouted down by the sports-fan crowd. I didn&apos;t help things by getting them revved up with the set I turned in, and I felt guilty afterwards. We both wound up selling some merchandise, and I retired to the room to watch Bill Maher on HBO (actually, caught it twice last night courtesy of HBO 2). The good news is that we have two more shots at the stage tonight, and I suspect it&apos;s going to be a lot better, unless Georgetown or some other school is playing, in which case we&apos;re screwed again. Thank you, March Madness.

 Burnin&apos; For You (Blue Oyster Cult) 
Posted on 03/24/2006 at 08:32 AM
Getting ready to head out for the big weekend at Wiseacres Comedy Club in McLean, Virginia, just outside the shadow of the Washington Monument, The White House and all of our beloved structures that remind us of an America that Used To Be.
Last night was a one-nighter at a club called &quot;The Furnace&quot; in Orchard Park, New York, and it was their first or second comedy night ever, and they drew accordingly. There were about 15 people in the place, and while the owners were just as cordial as you could possibly be, that doesn&apos;t make up for trying to get the laughs out of 15 people, most of whom were not even there for comedy, but to just enjoy a few drinks at the bar, and then all of a sudden, there&apos;s this fat guy trying to make with the ha-ha&apos;s.
I opened up with some rudimentary crowd work and found that seven of our guests, who were in the age group of semi-retired to geriatric, were expatriate Britons who were now living in Upstate New York. I&apos;ll give them this...they lived through the Blitz, the punk revolution, and every dank, dark, rainy season that England could give them, and then retired to the armpit of the snow belt. Nice job, Limeys.
Anyway, they weren&apos;t into the show at all, and the rest of the crowd hugged the bar like it was a piece of driftwood and they were just enjoying cocktails on the deck of the Titanic a few hours ago, and except for a few &quot;mercy chuckles&quot; from headliner Mark Reedy, I might as well have been giving a eulogy for the town mooch. Not fun.
Mark, with his high-energy style, was just about as lost, although he kept it moving, and after getting paid, he hauled ass out of there. I don&apos;t blame him; my company is nice, but this is the type of gig you just want to get behind you. I got paid by check, which I&apos;m not thrilled about, but given the circumstances, they obviously didn&apos;t have the cash on hand to pay me greenbacks, so I took cold comfort in knowing that at least the check was drawn from the bank I do business with...if there&apos;s a problem, at least I have some recourse. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s going to be a problem, but I&apos;m cashing that bad boy first thing before hitting the road.
I&apos;m working in D.C. with headliner John Marks, a new name to me in the comedy world, and I always look forward to meeting someone new in the comedy biz, for the purpose of networking. Hopefully some of the D.C. locals will hang out and do the pal-around thing, but if not, it&apos;s only a two-day engagement, I&apos;ll survive. I&apos;m thinking about renting a panel truck and spray-painting the word &quot;bomb&quot; on it and driving up Pennsylvania Avenue. My career could probably use a little media hype, and I think that might get me some, even if it&apos;s that shitty, &quot;Up in the water tower with a rifle and a scope&quot; fame. Ah, maybe I&apos;ll stay in my hotel room and read blogs. That might be a better journey towards an unincarcerated me.
More reports as the weekend progresses. Keep building those weapons of mass dissatisfaction.

 Animals (Nickleback) 
Posted on 03/20/2006 at 07:07 AM
What&apos;s worse than calling an audience member retarded and then finding out he&apos;s actually retarded?
I guess, putting the guy in the front row at a comedy show. Why would you do that?
Submitting the weekend wrap-up, I got home Friday somewhere around 6:30 P.M. and somehow never got to bed until around 10:30, and I slept like they were about to do my autopsy. I did well driving down through Michigan and across Ontario, Canada without having any bowel &quot;events&quot; (I&apos;m suffering through a constant state of irregularity, and I&apos;m beginning to think I have colon cancer or something...it&apos;s quite the irritation), and I used Saturday as a nice day at home to rest and recuperate.
Saturday night, I worked with Annette Lorenzo out of Rochester, NY, who had booked a gig for us in Camden, NY. Now, at first, I thought we were working in Medina, which is halfway between Rochester and Buffalo, but she corrected me and said we were actually working in Auburn, NY, halfway between Rochester and Syracuse. That was fine; I was looking forward to going back to the Apple Orchard in Medina, one of the first places I headlined way back about 10 years ago (and did very well, as I recall). I was booked by a guy named Cal Touhey who only booked me because I booked a room or two at the time, and he was hoping for that &quot;log-rolling&quot; thing, vis-a-vis you book me and I&apos;ll book you. Only he was terrible, and even though I wasn&apos;t as good then as I am now, at least I knew I was better than he was. Doesn&apos;t that sound terrible? At least I was working pretty regular...I didn&apos;t know anyone that was hiring Cal. Consequently, he&apos;s fallen off the face of the earth...but I digress.
So I met Annette at her house, and we took off for Camden, NY. She had directions, courtesy of Yahoo, which got us sorta near where we needed to be. I preach, and will continue to preach, www.randmcnally.com for any and all directions and map making online...they are the best. We hit the NYS Thruway, and the snow started coming down somewhere just before Syracuse. We hit Syracuse and headed north on I-81, and then got off at route 41 or some such 30 mph road, and began a winding tour of the Adirondack mountains.
We got to the gig about a half hour late, but with the weather, the folks who hired us understood. It was a group of middle school teachers, about 60 of them all told, at a private function at an American Legion hall. Annette went on and did a 30 minute set, which I listened to with one ear from the lounge. She got a couple of applause breaks, but I happened to notice that the graphic sexual material was getting no love. I do quite a bit of that in my act, so I just decided to forget about it and went another way when I got onstage.
Anyhow, there was a guy sitting by himself, front row, all the way to the left of the room, and he was a little older (I called him Bob Newhart), and Annette had asked him &quot;What are you, retarded?&quot; and the room got quiet...I actually missed the whole interchange, as I was out in the bar flirting with the bartender and playing pull-tabs trying to win some money. Come to find out, they guy was retarded, and he was part of the school&apos;s maintenance staff, and they invited him out because he was part of &quot;the family.&quot; Great...put the guy right up front, why dontcha.
The show was good, and we got better directions home, which still took us the better part of two hours. Annette was all wound up and wanted to talk about business, and I just drove and tried to keep the vehicle between the guard rails. When I got home, Pam had torellini for me (I hadn&apos;t eaten much all day and was starving pretty good), and I slept really well. It was quite a weekend, I haven&apos;t worked a one-nighter in New York State in quite a while, and it felt like getting back to my roots as a road comic.
Another thing before I go; I&apos;m still getting responses from the Bill Hargis incident in Detroit, where I was told I couldn&apos;t sell merchandise after the show. My buddy, Ricky K. from Florida, who is one of my best friends in the world, wrote me an e-mail with the title, &quot;Rickey K has your back !&quot; and I wanted to share it with you. Here it is, unedited and unexpurgated:
CITY OF DETROIT
HUMAN RIGHTS DEPARTMENT
2Woodward Ave., Suite 1026
Detroit , MI 48226 
(313) 224-4950
Hours of Operation 
8:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.
To whom it may Concern.
I&apos;m writing your office today out of frustration. I&apos;m an employee of Chaplin&apos;s Comedy Club.The club is ran by Bob and Bill Hargis .
My compliant is against Bill Hargis.I&apos;m a female in my twenties.I need to be anonymous for the time being until I find out what my options are. I feel that Bill Hargis has been making unwanted sexual advances towards me. That man could pass as my grandfather ,Bill should be in Depends instead of running a Comedy Club . The comments that comes out of his mouth are just pure evil. He has been know to hire street walkers to service him in his office. He told me to meet him in his office and when I walked in there was a midget hooker on a donkey(yes a donkey was in that small office to ) performing a sexual act on him with apple sauce.I heard of whip cream but apple sauce.You should have seen how long the donkey tounge was.
This man is sick. Than he said &quot;Come on in Babe show me your merchandise&quot; And I really took offense to that.
I mean like ,that is just plain rude.I&apos;m not merchandise....merchandise is what comedians sell at the club. My tits are real.
Anyways please let me know what I can do.
Thank You
Now, I don&apos;t know if Rickey actually sent this e-mail, but I will say this...he&apos;s never been a guy who was shy about that sort of thing, and he definitely doesn&apos;t have anything to lose. Fortunately, it reads very much like a joke, a satire of a complaint letter, so if he did send it, there probably wouldn&apos;t be any repercussions, but boy, if that letter got dressed up just a little bit, there&apos;d be some trouble now, wouldn&apos;t there? It never occurs to me to try and hit my tormentors where they live, but I suppose Rickey just has way more experience with that sort of thing, and he&apos;s a fighter from the 10th Ward, so it&apos;s in his blood. God bless you Rickey, and keep fighting, dude! I&apos;m glad you&apos;re on my side.
This week, I&apos;m finally getting the work done on my battle boat, the good ship Toyota Corolla, and then a one-nighter in Orchard Park, NY, home of my beloved Buffalo Bills (also fighters) and then off to Washington, D.C. to Wiseacres comedy club for two nights of fun. It&apos;s a short weekend, so I&apos;ll get a few more days to mend, God willing, and enjoy a little down time with the wife and baby kid.
Have a good week, why dontcha?

 Tonight&apos;s The Night (Rod Stewart) 
Posted on 03/17/2006 at 08:01 AM
Happy St. Patrick&apos;s Day! I hope you all enjoy one of the true great drinking holidays, right up there with Super Bowl Sunday and the day before Thanksgiving. Try not to drink too much green beer tonight, because green urine is scary...not as much as red urine, granted, but pretty scary in it&apos;s own right.
Getting ready to hit the trail of tears and a 10-11 hour drive home from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, up on Canada&apos;s front porch, I&apos;m up good &apos;n&apos; early. I didn&apos;t have much faith in my ability to shake it out of the rack early today, but divine providence struck in the form of my good friend, Jimmy Hamm from 92.5 KISS F.M. in Toledo, Ohio.
Jimmy is one of the morning show hosts on the KISS F.M. station in Toledo, and when I played there a month ago, he hosted a night of comedy at Connxtions Comedy Club, and I was going to do a morning call-in bit, pretending to be a regular caller, but doing a totally set-up call. It would have been funny, but I was suffering from a pretty bad cold at the time, and my cold medicine zonked me out, and I missed Jimmy&apos;s calls all morning. So he called me yesterday, asking me if I&apos;d be willing to do another call-in bit, which I jumped on, and he said he would call me at 7:15 today, which is great because it&apos;s like a wake-up call I didn&apos;t have to worry about.
The bit we did was for a segment they do called &quot;First Time Friday&quot; where callers call in and predict that they will &quot;seal the deal&quot; with their significant others over the upcoming weekend. I imagine the female callers are pretty much slam-dunks, but for guys to call in and say that they&apos;ll be successful in the quest for the nookie, that&apos;s pretty cocky. Jimmy called me and I posed as &quot;Kyle,&quot; who predicted that he&apos;ll finally get some from his girlfriend &quot;Shannon,&quot; and when they called me, I did an imitation of the cockiest guy I know, a friend of mine named Mark who works at the Comix Cafe in Rochester. To give you some idea of the type of character that Mark is, my good friend Steve Burr (www.steveburrcomedy.com) once described Mark as &quot;the closes thing to Fonzie that we&apos;ve got.&quot; Unfortunately, he also described me as &quot;the closest thing to Al Delvecchio that we&apos;ve got.&quot; I guess that one got stuck in my craw a little, huh?
So I did the bit, and now I&apos;m shaking off the cobwebs and getting ready to roll. Last night was a pretty interesting show, all told. I started off with a visit to the lounge to see the casino showroom here at Kewadin Resorts, and it was a pretty nice looking room....big stage, lots of seats, and assurance from the bartender that they usually fill up pretty good. I went and had dinner at the buffet, which was a little substandard as far as casino buffets go, but better than any of the high-priced menu items the restaurant offered (you could tell they were pushing people towards the buffet...it&apos;s better profit because there&apos;s a lower food cost...oh, the things you learn when you work in a restaurant). They comped my meal the night before, but no one mentioned a comp last night, and I wound up paying.
I tracked down the guy responsible for getting me my check, and jumped through all of the hoops required to get it cashed, and made my way back to my room, with about 40 minutes to shower and dress for the show. When I met Coco, the Canadian Indian sound guy/host for the show, he mentioned that my dinner was supposed to be comped. Damn! That was $12.95 I&apos;d rather have had in my pocket.
On the way down to the show, I caught Jan, the cashier at the restaurant, who I had struck up a conversation with as I had paid my bill. I told her that I found out about the comp, and she got a manager to refund my dinner price. It was a nice surprise to actually be able to get the money back, because this road trip is turning out to be less profitable than it looked when I booked it due to rising gas costs, and the lower gas mileage of my wife&apos;s car.
The show was packed, as advertised, and it was all senior citizens and college students, and heavy on the college students. We started late, about quarter after nine, and approximately 20 seconds into my show, the speakers cut out and emitted the loudest puff of annoying sound I&apos;ve ever heard in my life. It sounded like a whale song more than feedback, and wouldn&apos;t stop until Coco came running over and disconnected the mic cord from the speakers. There&apos;s nothing that digs a comedy hole like technical difficulties.
Problem corrected, I continued my act. Within another minute, it happened again. Coco disconnected the mic, and I put the mic in the stand and began doing the show without the mic, begging the audience to stay with me, that I didn&apos;t do a lot of sound effects that required the mic, but that every once in a while, I would do a bit that didn&apos;t sound particularly impressive, but that they had to play along like I was killing. It was a moment of vulnerability, and they appreciated it and hung out with me.
While I did my act acappella, Coco rushed around like a roadie at a Bon Jovi concert hooking up another sound system. At one point, he walked in front of me on stage, with no pretense of hunching down to be out of the way. He was pretty drunk, not to be stereotypical, but he was also on painkillers from a snowmobiling accident, so he was high as a kite. I broke his balls a little, and he felt it necessary to retort, which again, slowed things down for my part of the show. I was supposed to do 35, and got off sometime around the 40 minute mark, factoring in the technical difficulties.
After the show, which headliner Mike Merryfield battled much of the same room dynamics as I did, weird crowd dynamic and the loss of much of the back of the room (no speakers back there), we both decided that this was too much work. We parted company, and I went to the bar to have a Diet Coke. I was chided by a drunk kid who wanted to know why I wasn&apos;t drinking. The truth, which I happily told him, was that I was on medication and it didn&apos;t react well with alcohol. He shared his life story with me, his pancreaitits, the accident that shattered his jaw, and the hard, manual labor job that he works at five days a week, and his military service. The only thing I could say to the kid is &quot;Damn straight!&quot; and &quot;You got that right!&quot; which are the proper responses to a drunk guy who&apos;s trying to talk to you and make a point. I ditched the kid and headed back out into the casino.
When I checked in, they gave me a few rolls of casino tokens, to play the slot machines for free. I wound up winning $3.50, which is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick or a kick in the ass with a frozen boot on your birthday in front of all of your friends. I took my winnings over to a machine called &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; after the game show starring Howie Mandel, and parlayed my winnings into another 10 bucks. Hooray! It was a small profit, but better a small profit than a large loss, eh?
I&apos;m getting ready to start trucking, and on only about four hours of sleep. It was good sleep, thanks to my CPAP machine, but I don&apos;t know at what point along the drive I&apos;m going to start feeling the effects. Caffeine will probably help, but I&apos;ll be ready for a nap when I finally get home. Luckily, the weather is nice today, and hopefully I won&apos;t have to battle the winds like I did on the way up.
Hope your St. Paddy&apos;s Day is safe, and catch you again on Sunday!

God, please kill me.
I take that back. I don&apos;t want to die, but I definitely can&apos;t wait for this little &quot;phase&quot; of my life to get over with.
I&apos;m in Sault Ste. Marie, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan at the Kewadin Casino Resort. I played last night at the Kewadin property in St. Ignace, Michigan, also in the Upper Peninsula.
Now, for a brief glossary of pronunciations: Soo Saint MUHree, keWAHden, SAINT IGnuss, cuhSEEno.
I was without internet yesterday...you know you&apos;re beyond the curvature of the Earth when you can&apos;t even dial-up AOL. I felt crippled, alone, adrift on the ocean without an oar. It was rough.
I slept poorly Tuesday night...that&apos;s always a bad thing when you&apos;re staring down a 10-hour drive. I was uncomfortable because I&apos;ve been having intestinal issues, first I was loose as a goose, then overcompensated with the Pepto Bismol, now I&apos;ve been bound up for a week. No matter how you slice it, my tender anus has been screaming &quot;No Mas! No Mas!&quot; Everything I eat, I have to consider how it&apos;s going to pass. It&apos;s been a little frustrating.
I wound up taking FIVE bathroom breaks in that 10-hour drive. Nothing like a fire on the back porch to make a long drive seem even longer. I got to St. Ignace, found out that the hotel I was being lodged at was nowhere near the casino (what a treat) and had to back-track to get to it. The nice thing was that there was a shuttle, so I didn&apos;t have to drive in the dark through the mountainous nothing of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
I got to the hotel three hours before showtime. I drew a hot bath to soak my aching body in, and fell asleep. Luckily, I woke up in time to shave, shower properly, and get to the casino in time to enjoy a complimentary meal before the show, and then took the stage. The show was pretty cool, a room full of UP rednecks that liked me well enough, and when the show was over, it was back to the nickel slots. I grabbed the shuttle back to the hotel and slept like a dead man.
Except that I really didn&apos;t sleep all that much. I&apos;ve been using my CPAP machine, which I received for treatment of my sleep apnea, and I wake up totally refreshed. I get about seven hours of sleep, and then I&apos;m ready to take on the world. I fell asleep at about 12:30, just after Letterman, and woke up around 7:00. I caught the lovely continental breakfast, and then retreated back to my room. I read quite a bit, then caught another hour or so of sleep, and hit the road for the Soo.
I have about five hours until showtime, so I think I&apos;m going to enjoy my gambling voucher and see if I can&apos;t turn it into some extra cash at the nickel slots. I&apos;m driving my wife&apos;s car this week again, and it doesn&apos;t get the same gas mileage as my beloved Toyota (25 mpg vs. 30....it makes a difference on a 1200 mile road-trip). I believe I&apos;m getting another comped meal, and this property actually lodges us on the premises, so I have lots of time to screw around before showtime, and then tomorrow, the 11-hour trail of tears back to Rochester. I did this trip once before, back when I was on the George Carlin tour, but I had the company Bronco and couldn&apos;t cut through Canada, and it took me about 16 hours to get down to Detroit, through Toledo, Ohio, and back to Rochester (I was carrying Carlin T-Shirts and product with no manifest, and Canadian Customs wouldn&apos;t allow me to pass). I left at 6 A.M. and got into Rochester about 10 at night. I had a nice meal, and slept, and then the next morning, picked up more Carlin merchadise and drove to New Hampshire. This was 10 years ago, I was 29 and a real animal. Today, I could do it, but I&apos;d need to have my bones removed, massaged, and then put back.
I have Friday off, and then a nice local show on Saturday, and I&apos;ll take advantage of the time home to recuperate and get some family time in. Career-wise, this weekend isn&apos;t going to make a dent in my resume, but as they say in the business, &quot;Hell gig is better than no gig.&quot;

 Just Got Lucky (Dokken) 
Posted on 03/13/2006 at 01:27 AM
Closing up the week at Chaplin&apos;s in Detroit, Michigan. After posting my last journal entry regarding Bill Hargis&apos; decision to ask me not to sell merchandise after the show, while allowing the headliner to continue selling his t-shirts, I received quite a few phone calls and e-mails of support from comics and friends, all expressing sympathy at the raw deal I&apos;d been served. To all of you, I thank you.
The weekend finished up on a high note, despite the downer that Friday night delivered. I stopped taking phone calls around 2:30 in the afternoon and went out to have some lunch, walk around, and just keep myself distracted. I got back to the room in time to have a little nap, shave &apos;n&apos; shower, and get over to the club early.
First show was jammed; Chaplin&apos;s is a boat of a room, and they were full up. Kevin Naughton showed up just a little bit before showtime, and mentioned to me that he spoke to Billy and told him he was short of merchandise, that he only had five shirts left, and that whether he sold out or not, he wanted to ask Billy to let me sell my CD&apos;s and DVD&apos;s after the second show. Billy said yes, which means he pretty much stuck to his guns that his only problem was that he thought no more than one comic should be selling, and it wasn&apos;t anything personal towards me.
The show went great, Kevin sold out, and we headed towards the second show. The second show was really full, not jammed, but I had another very strong show, and sold my stuff after the show. I still don&apos;t think it was a logical decision to cut me off from selling late show Friday and early show Saturday, I could have made some money that would have helped me towards solving some of my problems. It&apos;s water under the bridge at this point, and the bridge is probably going to take me to another club. If not, I&apos;ll go back and work Chaplin&apos;s, if I need the money badly enough that I have to swallow my pride and understand the rules of the game.
I drove home overnight, hitting the road at 1:30 A.M., and pulled into my driveway at 6:30 A.M. When I pulled up to the customs booth to enter Canada (the shortcut to Upstate New York when you&apos;re in Michigan), the customs agent actually asked me if I wasn&apos;t too tired to drive. I&apos;d never been asked that before! It was actually kind of nice. The woman looked like a young Penny Marshall, without the unfortunate nose. I was loaded up with caffeine, peppermint gum and a nice cheese muffin, and felt pretty good about my chances of making it home without dozing off at the wheel.
Today, we did a little family get-together for Harmony&apos;s birthday, and it was a low-key affair, consisting primarily of watching her run around while we enjoyed ice cream and cake and then let her make confetti out of the wrapping paper on her gifts. I spent most of the day playing with Harmony, reading to her, and just generally being thankful that I have a child, when for years I thought there was no way I&apos;d ever be a parent, or possess the patience to raise a child.
Tomorrow, it&apos;s back to work on the pressing issues before me, car repairs, Federal income tax, straightening out my home office, and soliciting work for myself for the late weeks of June and early weeks of July. I&apos;m going to try to work close to home, because my mother is scheduled to visit from Florida, and it wouldn&apos;t make any sense not to be around to enjoy her company. Also, it&apos;s not very hospitable to leave home when you know you have guests coming...it&apos;s generally considered to be rude.
Between my good friends at Comedy Zone and my new friends at the Ken Muller agency, I&apos;ve drawn enough extra work for the spring that I may actually be able to take some of those weeks off. A summer vacation! Haven&apos;t had one of those for years!
It might be fun.
I hope things go your way, gentle readers, and that you have a great week.

 We Just Disagree (Dave Mason) 
Posted on 03/11/2006 at 11:39 AM
WARNING! HOT TOPIC!
I&apos;m writing this journal entry this morning to allow myself to cool down from the night before. I didn&apos;t want to compose it in the heat of the moment and say something I might regret later.
I&apos;m working at Chaplin&apos;s Comedy Club in Detroit, Michigan, actually, Clinton Township, one of the Northwest suburbs. It&apos;s a nice club, runs six shows Wednesday through Saturday, and happens to have a bowling alley wrapped around it. The bowling alley doesn&apos;t interfere with the shows, it&apos;s not as though you can hear the noise from the lanes while you&apos;re in the showroom or anything, but I&apos;m just throwing it in there in case you&apos;ve never been to the actual club, you can get a bead on the lay of the land, and maybe picture it better in your mind.
The club is owned by two brothers, Bob and Bill Hargis. I&apos;ve never met Bob, I&apos;ve only dealt with Billy. Billy is an older gent who has run the club since the 70&apos;s. It used to be a dance club, and there&apos;s still tons of stage lighting in the back of the room, anchored to the ceiling and recessed out of view, unless you were to go back there and sit and then idly look up. It speaks of the ghosts of the fad entertainment of the day, with bell-bottomed dancers and their polyester minidressed partners lining up to do the hustle, shaking and sweating to the pumping rhythms of artists like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, Gloria Gaynor and Rose Royce, and darting away to share a bump in the bathroom.
The pictures on the wall, as I&apos;ve described before, are old and yellowed, and show comics we know today as fat and bald as young, apple-cheeked visionaries with stars in their eyes, before a heartless business sucked them dry and left them sitting on the edge of their beds in hotel rooms, wondering where their youth went or where they even are or when they get to go home. Some of the comics, like Dennis Wolfberg, are dead, but live on here at Chaplin&apos;s, bracketed to the wall, wishing Billy and Bobby good luck like some timeless comedy zombie, his curly red hair covering his head like a field of English heather, and nothing at all like the modest scraps that hung about his ears like a monk once we finally got to know him through his television appearances. Others, like Jay Leno, smile back with a finger touched to his forehead, just below hair that hasn&apos;t begun to turn grey, a hastily scribbled signature across his ample chin, checking out of a club that he will likely never, ever walk into again.
Ive performed at Chaplin&apos;s before, this being my third week in five years. I had to go back to my old records, which I carry with me to refer to in these cases, to find out exactly when. I seem to get scheduled to come here every 18 months or so, just enough time to be forgotten by any fan base that may care to see me again, just soon enough to remember the zig-zag route from the hotel to the club without asking for directions.
The first time I was at the club was March of 2002, and the horror of 9/11 was still fresh in everyone&apos;s mind. I was peddling a souvenir T-shirt, featuring Osama Bin Laden in a cross-hairs, and had a snappy little sales pitch that had some good laughs in it, and it went along with a nice Mafia bit that I had written. I sold a good number of those shirts, and it helped me make some money at this comedy game, even though gasoline hadn&apos;t risen to the rapacious $2.50 a gallon that it has arrived at this week. Traveling expenses still ate up much of my modest feature pay, and merchandise sales were helping to tilt the scale towards solvency.
When I arrived at Chaplin&apos;s the first time as a paid feature act, I approached Billy, who displayed the warmth and patience of a strip-club owner going through a New York State tax audit, and tried to be friendly, thanking him for having me, and asking how much time to do, and where I could set up my T-shirts for sale after the show.
&quot;Leave &apos;em in the trunk&quot; he said.
I was a little startled, and taken aback, frankly, because as a club manager I would never have been so terse and unfair to a comic, especially a feature act, who was just trying to make a survival wage, and unfriendliness aside, I wasn&apos;t ready for his response at all. I plodded through the week, and tried to get paid as soon as possible after the second show on Saturday so that I could leave quickly and make my five-hour drive home, and Billy dragged his feet and paid me when he damn well pleased, and when he asked me what I was in such a hurry for, I explained that I did promotions work for the club back home (true) and had in-house calendars to complete for printing on Tuesday (true) and wanted to get back to start working on them right away (half-true...I just wanted to get the hell out of there). He made some ice-water comment about planning ahead, and I parted ways with a bitter taste in my mouth.
Cut to my next appearance at the club, October of 2004, 15 months later. My daughter Harmony was six months old, I was working for the same money, and with an extra mouth to feed, clothe and diaper. I was peddling a CD after my shows now, and contacted the club a few weeks early, begging for permission to sell them after my shows and explaining the new addition to the family, and the budget crunch it was causing me. I complained to the booking agent, even. I called Mark Kolo at Funny Business Agency.
&quot;Does he know he doesn&apos;t pay the money, to put the brakes on a guy trying to eke out a living wage?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t think he even cares. Billy&apos;s funny that way.&quot;
I tried side-stepping Billy to see if I could get any justice from his brother Bob, who I still haven&apos;t met, and received no call or contact in the yea or nay. Upon arriving at the club, I talked to Billy, who still was arm&apos;s length.
&quot;Yeah, go ahead and sell &apos;em. You&apos;ll probably make another 50 bucks.&quot; What a sweetheart.
I wound up selling out, and the headliner did well with his CD&apos;s, too. In your face, Billy.
This week, I mistakenly assumed that I was still able to sell my stuff. I&apos;m still carrying the CD, and I have a DVD as well. Sales were sparse on Wednesday and Thursday, but enough to put some gas in the car and eat some low-budget grub. After the first show, Billy approaches me where I&apos;m standing next to Kevin Naughton at the merchandise table.
&quot;Did you get an itinerary?&quot; he says to me. Yeah, I got an itinerary, but I don&apos;t know where he&apos;s going with this. I thought I was going to get chewed out about my time. He made a nasty remark about it before I went on.
&quot;What did it say?&quot; I parroted the contents of the itinerary, &quot;Dress nice, be at the club early, no swearing...&quot; all of the restrictions that a control-freak club puts on their comics. If you want a clean comic who wears a suit, hire one. I dress how I dress and I say what I say to get people to laugh. I don&apos;t tell you what to charge for a beer, or when to start your show, can&apos;t we work together on this?
Regarding merchandise, it says &quot;ask permission from Billy.&quot; I explained that the last time I was at the club, I did ask, and he had said all right. Apparently, someone had pissed him off since I was there last, and I was going to suffer for it. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I just assumed it was o.k.&quot; I said. &quot;If you want me to pack it up, and not sell the rest of the week, say the word.&quot; I was humble and polite, and I figured there was no way he would be so heavy-handed, but sure as shit, he said, &quot;Yeah, why don&apos;t you do that.&quot; No more sales for me.
Now really, I&apos;m thinking I might make another 100 bucks the rest of the week, if I&apos;m lucky, have three hot shows, and the folks who come out are really into me. And that might not change my life, but 100 bucks can help me pay off two-thirds of my speeding ticket from last week, or buy four boxes of diapers, or maybe it could just sit in the bank and collect a little interest, waiting for the next life catastrophe that could befall a working-class couple with a young child who want to live safe and be healthy. Maybe I could even buy a nice birthday present for Harmony Rose, who turns two years old today and deserves much nicer things than I can afford to buy for her, even though I really don&apos;t know what you get for a two-year old, except more toys that sing and beep when you accidentally kick them in the middle of the night on your way to the bathroom, or maybe some nice girlie toddler clothing, which is about a third as big as adult clothing, but mystically, costs exactly the same. But the 100&apos;s not going to be there, because the owner of the club I&apos;m working thinks it makes his club look cheap.
Now, I&apos;m not going to argue about how it &quot;looks.&quot; Frankly, I don&apos;t know how it looks to Billy, only he knows that and it&apos;s his club, so all arguments end. But I think, and prejudicially, that merchandise is a good thing. I think that people carry home souvenirs from their positive comedy club experience, and it sits in the home as a reminder that the comedy club is a good place to go, that it&apos;s just as fun if not more so than the movies, or bowling, or karaoke, or whatever evening pursuits normal folks go to relieve themselves from the stress of the working week. I do also know that if folks dont want the t-shirts, CD&apos;s or bumper stickers that comics are selling after the show, that they don&apos;t buy them. They walk by the table, smiling and shaking hands and saying &quot;Good show,&quot; and they keep walking. It&apos;s not a negative experience at all, and for the folks that are embarrassed, they walk by the table with their heads down, and that&apos;s their prerogative. I see no blood being shed in the process.
Kevin, the headliner, was allowed to continue selling. He&apos;s the headliner, so I suppose it&apos;s not as &quot;cheap-looking&quot; as a feature selling. I begrudge him nothing; he&apos;s a good comic and a friend. He apologized after Billy talked to me, he was standing right there for the whole interchange. And, I might add, he apologized for no reason; it wasn&apos;t his fault, but obviously that Irish-Catholic guilt was kicking in...I would have done the same, for sure.
Some club owners ask for a percentage of sales; that&apos;s nothing new to me. When I worked on the George Carlin tour, we had to fork over as little as 10% of those merchandise sales and as much as 35% in one instance to the halls we worked, and we paid it, grudgingly, for the use of a rickety table in the drafty foyer. Still, their house, their rules, and there&apos;s just nothing you can do about it.
As a club manager, I always considered the club/comic relationship to be a partnership. I believe that a comfortable comic making decent money is a happy, productive entertainer who puts on a good show, and keeps the folks coming back to pay my ticket price and buy my foods and beverages. Everyone should be having fun and making money. As a comic, I have always tried to maintain that notion, that we&apos;re in this together, and I compliment clubs vocally from the stage that do a great job and make me feel at home. I have two shows tonight, and really, what do I say now? I don&apos;t want to punish the staff by slagging the club or being less than complimentary, but as I discussed with my wife the night before, do I even want to come back to this club? Is the cold treatment and unfair sanction on selling worth working a substandard pay week, even though it&apos;s close to home? It&apos;s ugly, but when comedy work is so hard to find and so competitive, the scarcity mentality in me says shut your mouth and keep the week, even though it only comes up every year-and-a-half. The abundance mentality says that I should dump the club, not even try to work it anymore, that it&apos;s not worth it and I can easily replace it with a better-paying week, at a club that is more comic-friendly and I don&apos;t have to walk on eggs all the time.
I guess the whole issue is my being able to have some courage to walk away, and I&apos;ve never been very courageous. My name, Ralph, actually means &quot;Shield of Courage,&quot; which is a laugh, because I&apos;ve always been cautious at the best, and fraidy-cat at the worst. I have no spine for confrontation, and I&apos;m scared to lose what little I have because I struggle so hard to get it. And when you have a wife and child looking to you to bring the money home every week, the ante gets doubled and beads of sweat start forming. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do with this club, and thats sad, because there&apos;s eight other clubs in a one-hour radius, and Im sure I could get into one (or many) of them if I tried. Then I could still come to Detroit (fun town, nice people) and never darken the doorstep of Billy Hargis again.
He&apos;d never miss me, that&apos;s for sure.

You&apos;re only as good as your last show.
Luckily, my last show was excellent, and very satisfying as well. We had a considerably better turnout tonight than yesterday, and while they were still a little on the old side, they came to play and were a lot of fun to perform for. Having a great show after having a lousy show the night before is like taking a tomato juice bath after being sprayed by a skunk, or so several dogs I have owned would lead me to believe. However you slice it, the stink is dissipated.
Today was a wonderful day, considering I spent most of it battling a stomach virus that made me afraid to leave the hotel room. During the course of the day though, I was able to shake the tree and wound up scoring a week of work in August to get me halfway back to New York from Florida. Every year I go to visit my father down in Florida since he had lung cancer surgery a few years ago...I like to make sure he&apos;s o.k. I got work from Comedy Zone in North Carolina, and so I&apos;ll also be able to make a side trip to visit my sister and her husband who live in Garner, just outside of Raleigh. Always nice to visit family to break up the road work and boredom.
Also on the road work tip, I got a couple of fill-in gigs from Comedy Productions that will take me to the Northern Lights Casino in Walker, Minnesota in April and again in June. I&apos;m the beneficiary of another run that fell apart, but the casino wanted to keep doing comedy, so I scored two of the fill-in dates. Hey, take the extra money and run. I&apos;m a fan of the casino gigs, they usually treat you well and they have buffets and sometimes you can swing a comp here and there, but the downfall for me is that I am a problem gambler, and don&apos;t really have the money to lose. Still, the siren song of the nickel slots and the roulette table call, and I&apos;m usually lucky only to lose 30 or 40 dollars. Most of the time I don&apos;t gamble at all, but there&apos;s so much down time to kill, it&apos;s inevitable. The last time I gambled was at the Chip In&apos;s Casino in Harris, Michigan, and I was up $150 on nickle slots, and went back to my room, and tried to go to sleep and prepare for my 15 hour drive home, but I was so excited, I went back down to the casino and lost $80 back. Greed is bad! I wound up going back to the room, which was a jacuzzi suite, and settled down into the jacuzzi and let the warm water relax me until I could get to sleep.
Tomorrow I&apos;m going to venture out and try and find a comic book store...I&apos;m a month behind in my favorite Marvel title, the Exiles. I&apos;ve always liked the book, but lately, they&apos;ve been really stretching the imagination with the story arc, and it&apos;s got me as excited as I&apos;ve been about comics since I was a kid. It&apos;s nice being able to enjoy what has been a life-long hobby again...for a while, I&apos;d only been reading a few titles here and there, and enjoying them only moderately. It was almost like I&apos;d been buying them just to buy something, like I had a 30-year streak going and didn&apos;t want to snap it. So now I can enjoy a simple pleasure again. Hooray for me!
I hope you reconnect with some of your simple pleasures that may have gone by the wayside this weekend. Make yourself happy if you can. And speaking of making yourself happy, &quot;Barb Wire&quot; starring Pamela Anderson just came on the USA network, one of the 12 channels of cable here at the Red Roof, and I&apos;ve never seen it so I&apos;m gonna watch it and see if I can&apos;t put my finger on what all the hub-bub was about. Or maybe five fingers....

Is there a black cloud over my head?
Live from Detroit, the Motor City, Motown, home of the NBA champion Pistons, NHL perennial superpower Red Wings, and unfortunate NFL punching bag Lions. Tonight, Chaplin&apos;s Comedy Club played host to headliner Kevin Naughton, mc Crystal P., and myself. Together, we pitched the jokes like we were the Detroit Tigers, and the audience of 22 was catching them like they were pigeons with the bird flu. Seriously, this group was obviously out at the club against their will, which always baffled me. We fought, wheedled, cajoled, and delivered the goods, but found few takers. I decided to cut my losses and retire back to the lovely Red Roof Inn and made some chunky soup in my electric wok. Comfort food, indeed.
I called the West Virginia Magistrate&apos;s office about my speeding ticket that I incurred last week, and got some discomforting news...I have no recourse for a plea bargain. I&apos;m used to being abled to plea down charges on traffic infractions, but I guess West Virginia needs the money too badly. The new scam is that they give you a $5 fine, but there&apos;s $153.50 worth of &quot;court costs&quot; that are levied, despite the amount of the fine. Nice, West Virginia. Kiss my ass, Mountaineers.
Hopefully, tomorrow will be better, but I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s piss raining here in Detroit, and there was thunder &apos;n&apos; lightning and my cable just went out. Could it get any worse? And of course it was right during Bill Maher&apos;s show, which I never get to watch. Do you hate me, God?
O.K., cable&apos;s back on, so I&apos;m signing off. Tomorrow will be better, because it can&apos;t be worse. Keep yer powder dry, my friends.

 Dreams (Van Halen) 
Posted on 03/08/2006 at 01:32 AM
Well, I&apos;m getting ready to hit the road for Detroit, Michigan, and a week-long engagement at Chaplin&apos;s Comedy Club with headliner Kevin McNaughton. I&apos;m excited, as I always am when I hit the road, but this week so much more so. I have a couple of reasons.
First, Chaplin&apos;s was the first coemdy club I ever played outside of my home club, some 16 years ago. I participated in the Johnny Walker National Comedy Search and while I didn&apos;t place, it was my first taste of the big time, cattle-call comedy auditions, much like what my peers are going through currently with the Last Comic Standing auditions. I literally got 2 minutes to strut my stuff in front of other comics, agents, managers, and big wig guys like Budd Friedman from the Improv. Remember, this was 1989, and it was just at the tail end of the comedy boom...I went in with stars in my eyes, and left with my hopes dashed and crushed. Actually, I wasn&apos;t expecting much going in, and I had only been doing comedy about two years at that point...I might as well have never done standup before at all. Two years is like nothing in comedy years...it&apos;s like dog years in reverse, when you&apos;ve done it for seven years, that&apos;s like one comedy year. In comedy years, I&apos;m actually six years old. Pretty soon I&apos;ll be able to leave the house by myself and put on my own shoes.
So I&apos;m looking forward to going back to Chaplin&apos;s. I&apos;ve played there a few times since, and it&apos;s not the most hospitable place to play, but it&apos;s a typical suburban comedy club and I like the idea of being in one place for the week rather than having to drive every day. This club is pretty amazing, as far as how long it&apos;s been around; they have the normal headshots on the wall, but they&apos;ve been yellowed by cigarette smoke (even though they&apos;re all in glass frames, can you dig it?) and they feature guys like Jerry Seinfeld and Drew Carey, long since gone from the comedy club circuit and looking decades younger in their sooty, amber cases.
Today I picked up my sleep apnea breather machine, and I&apos;m taking it with me on the road. I&apos;m looking forward to using it regularly and havinggood, restful, uninterupted sleep. I think it&apos;s quite an advantage being in one place for four days, because I won&apos;t have to keep packing and unpacking the equipment. I can keep it on my nightstand and really get used to using it, so when I get it home, I won&apos;t be wrestling with all the componenets.
Harmony&apos;s birthday is Saturday, and she&apos;s turning the big T-W-O. I&apos;ll be driving home overnight to make the celebration on Sunday, and we&apos;re going to have a simple family get-together with the cake and presents, and I&apos;m sure Harmony won&apos;t have any idea what the big deal is about, but she&apos;ll figure it out quick. She&apos;s a sharp one. Still, we&apos;re going to have the third annual &quot;Meet The Baby&quot; picnic this year, and it&apos;s looking like we&apos;re going to go with Sunday, July 9th, which is also my brother Christopher&apos;s birthday. Nothing like killing two birds with one stone, I say.
O.K., I&apos;m going to sleep now. Road reports are forthcoming, so sweet dreams, gentle readers, and good day.

 Voices (Disturbed) 
Posted on 03/04/2006 at 09:56 PM
I&apos;m sitting in the lobby of the historic Lafayette Hotel in Marietta, Ohio, waiting around for the big 9:00 P.M. show with headliner Mike Dambra. Oh, what a notable 24 hours it&apos;s been. Mike&apos;s been mocking me because I&apos;ve been doing impressions since we left home on Thursday. I&apos;m no impressionist, but if I can sort of do the voice, I&apos;ll try to do it to get the laugh. Problem is, I&apos;m not that good....hence the mocking. But that&apos;s the least of my problems today.
For starters, to recap the night at Morgantown, West Virginia, and the show at the Wits End Lounge in the Ramada Inn, all I can say is wow, what a weird gig.
We left Mansfield for our four hour drive and got into town without any sort of incident and checked into the hotel. There was a Moose Lodge convention from all the chapters of Moose in West Virginia, and they bought every room in the hotel except for one, the one that Mike and I were scheduled to share. We decided rather than be trapped in the room for six hours, we would go out and eat.
Mike and I have been touring together for a long time now, and even though we dont work together much any more, both of us having gone our separate ways, we fall right back into the patters and rituals that have served us well. We both enjoy the buffet restaurants, the ability to pick and choose several different foods rather than being locked into one entrée that may or may not be acceptable. We rotate around the Chinese places as well as Ponderosa, Old Country and whatever wild-card restaurantsmay be available. We were pulling for a USA Steak Buffet (they gots the steak), but none was to be had. We were about to settle for Shoney&apos;s (the home of the George Carlin donut-eating challenge&amp;I;ll tell that story, maybe tomorrow if you&apos;re good), when we happened upon a Chinese place called the Evergreen Buffet.
After scoring a nice Chinese sit-down meal (the buffet was good), we headed on back to the Ramada and stewed. We didn&apos;t mind sharing a room, but I still snore pretty bad, and I didnt want to torture Mike and have him not get any sleep. I would have slept in a supply closet if they had one, but they didn&apos;t have one that wasn&apos;t reserved. While we were in the room, the phone rang; it was Larry, the mc from the old Morgantown room at the golf resort. He knows Mike and me well, and we&apos;ve worked together a bunch of times. Larry&apos;s father is Las Vegas legendary ventriloquist Danny O&apos;Day&amp;Danny&apos;s puppet was Farfel the dog, and they starred in one of the first Nestle&apos;s commercials. As a matter of fact, Larry&apos;s father wrote the jingle that Nestle&apos;s still uses to this day &quot;N-E-S-T-L-E-S, Nestle&apos;s makes the very best.&quot; Larry&apos;s a great guy, too, but not that talented. He worked in radio for 35 years, and he&apos;s a very competent mc, so he was one of the bright spots in the evening. Plus, he&apos;s fun to pal around with.
When we got there, the bar was filled with Moose and the average age of the folks in the lounge was easily 50. We were told ahead of time that we couldn&apos;t say &quot;fuck&quot; unless absolutely necessary, and for both of us, we felt it was absolutely necessary. The show started out with a joke-off, and all the people who told jokes were good and raunchy, which was comforting because they set the tone for the show and we really didn&apos;t have to watch our P&apos;s and Q&apos;s.
I hit the stage and had a good show, and Mike went up rather tentative, but wound up rocking the room, did about an hour and five minutes, and still left them wanting more. Afterwards we hung around and watched Larry&apos;s son hit on the biggest woman in the room. He started out dancing with her, and she was so big, he looked like he was just caught in her gravitational pull. After the song was over, our shabby little lad went fishing for uneaten candy in Broadzilla&apos;s mouth. It wasn&apos;t pretty.
After all of the festivities were over, we headed back to the room and Mike (MySpace addict) went on the computer while I passed out. I woke up to the gentle ringing of my faulty cell phone alarm clock, and after battling to get back to sleep and losing, we got showers and went downstairs to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast buffet. Now, most hotel breakfasts are pretty limited and terrible, and carb-heavy, which isn&apos;t so good for a pre-diabetic like myself. This buffet was awesome, with eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, and all kinds of other treats. After breakfast, we went out and tried to cash our paychecks from the night before (check gig¬hing worse) and couldnt find the bank, so we decided to give up and head back to the hotel.
We had only a two-hour drive to the next gig, Marietta, Ohio, and I managed to get my first speeding ticket in five years of full-time road work. I was going 82 in a 65, so I guess I had it coming, but the cop wrote me up for 74 so I wouldn&apos;t get any points. What a sweetheart...I&apos;m still getting a fine. But it&apos;s West Virginia, so I have to pay in Confederate money. And because I couldn&apos;t find a bank, I don&apos;t have it on me. Fuck.
Our 9:00 show starts any minute now, so I&apos;m gonna wrap it up. We&apos;re going to drive home overnight, and it&apos;s about six hours, but with two of us in the car, we might as well try it.
O.K., I&apos;m back. Show&apos;s over for me and Mike&apos;s on stage now. The group was small and a little chatty, but good. They really made me work for it. I think that&apos;s good sometimes...it keeps you honest and reminds you that you always have to keep working and take nothing for granted. You never grow as a performer without always reaching for the next level.
That&apos;s all. I&apos;m going to pack up the laptop, watch the rest of Mikes show and get ready for the 400 mile drive home. Next week is Detroit, and another 4-day stand in Michigan. I&apos;m looking forward to it. Also, my baby daughter Harmony turns 2 on Saturday, and we&apos;re planning the big party for her on Sunday, so I&apos;ll be driving home overnight next week, too. For my daughter, I&apos;d walk it if I had to.
Keep it real, sons &apos;n&apos; daughters.

 Circumstances (Rush) 
Posted on 03/03/2006 at 12:07 AM
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Reporting live from the coldest hotel room I&apos;ve ever stayed in, in the luxurious Mansfield Inn in Mansfield, Ohio.
Tonight, I&apos;m officially back on the road with long-time comedy buddy Mike Dambra. We played Joez Lounge here in Mansfield, Ohio. I&apos;ve played Mansfield a bunch of times, as Funny Business used to have a room here in the downtown area called the Skylight Comedy Club, a decent one-nighter on a Thursday, and Hysterical Management (our employer this weekend) used to have a gig downtown at a Mafia hangout where they used to love me. The hotel was iffy, but the folks came out and drank and laughed, so I&apos;d take the gig whenever it came up.
Mike and I hit the road at 9:00 A.M., a little early for a five-hour drive, but in anticipation of the crap weather that we got. It sleeted, hailed, snowed, and was every sort of freezing precipitation with under-salted highways that you could possible want (or not want, as the case may be). We rolled into town in time to have a nice dinner, and back at the ranch, I got in a nap and a shower in time for the 7:30 P.M. show. Actually, my nap wasn&apos;t that good because my hotel room door isn&apos;t very well insulated, and the winter freeze is seeping in from the cracks all around it, making my room very difficult to heat. Thank God I&apos;m only here for one day. Then, to make matters worse, the bewildered front desk person called me and woke me up from my sound sleep requesting that I come down to the desk and pay for my comped room. I explained that I was one of the comics performing in their lounge this evening, and then the dawn came for our dim-witted girl. &quot;Oh, so that&apos;s why they put down zero on your account paid.&quot; Maybe a quick look at the name of the person signed in, and then a cross-reference with the pictures hanging in the lobby might have unearthed a possible answer to the mystery, but apparently she was sick that day at hotel college.
This wasn&apos;t my first run-in with below average customer service today. I went into Staples this morning, around quarter to nine, to get a short run of black and white copies made. The store was ghostly empty, so I went to the copy desk and asked for help...I never use those self-service things if there&apos;s someone there to help me; why should I? So I ask the young lady for help, and she answers, &quot;I don&apos;t know if I can fit you in, I have five orders ahead of you.&quot;
Now, for real, there was no one in the store...these five orders all had to be drop-offs, in which case, help the muthafukka standing right in front of you! Nobody will know that I &quot;cut!&quot; And it&apos;s a short run! I need 50 copies...what&apos;s that gonna take, 4 minutes? Your production schedule isn&apos;t going to get thrown off that much. And she wasn&apos;t working on any of those five orders when I walked up....is this bullshit, or what?
Finally, she helps me set up at the self-service area, but I made her do all the work, and then I was out of there. She fessed to only have worked there for four months, so I guess she doesn&apos;t have this whole &quot;customer service&quot; thing sharpened down to a fine point yet. Unfortunately for her, I have the whole &quot;customer complaint&quot; thing sharpened down to a machete, and I have nothing to do during the day other than call stores and complain. She gave me their little value card application, too, further highlighting her innattentiveness to my needs, namely, to get my copies and get the hell out of the store. You will pay, Staples girl, oh, you will pay.
Our show tonight was good, with a solid number of folks in the room (although the front three tables were empty, and six chairs never made a room look so unbalanced) and it was a redneck Git-R-Done-Fest if there ever was one. I did my 30 and scooted, and then watched Mike Dambra do his spinning plate act with all of the hecklers in the room. Sometimes it&apos;s magical, and sometimes I just shake my head....they sent him enough shots and drinks on stage to anesthetize me for tumor surgery; I really don&apos;t know how he does it. Not for me, brah.
After the show, we hung out and signed some autographs, sold some CD&apos;s to the adoring throng, and grab-assed with the owner and his wife. It&apos;s a nice gig overall, and it&apos;s such a benefit not having to drive from the hotel to the gig...those five steps from the hotel lobby to my room were like nothing, and fine by me. My car&apos;s covered with snow and ice, and I don&apos;t even want to think about it until tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow is Morgantown, West Virginia, a scant four hours away. It&apos;s a bit of a hike from here, and most likely will be all slick mountain roads, but showtime isn&apos;t until 9:00 P.M. so there&apos;s plenty of wiggle room to drive slow &apos;n&apos; safe to the gig. The lodging is also in the same facility as the gig, but there&apos;s only one room available for Mike and I to share, so he&apos;s gonna have to cope with my sleep apnea and snoring. I get my sleep apnea gear next week, but that does nothing for his comfort tomorrow. I think he&apos;s gonna get some earplugs.
I&apos;m going to sleep in my bed here in my drafty room. Hopefully I won&apos;t wake up with a head &apos;n&apos; chest cold, I&apos;ve almost got the old one kicked. Stay warm, wherever you are.

 Give A Little Bit (Supertramp) 
Posted on 02/28/2006 at 02:04 AM
I spent the day today nurturing my loved ones. That&apos;s not something you can say everyday, huh?
Starting off, let me recap the weekend at Connxtions in Lansing, Michigan. It was two great shows to end a fine week at the club, with headliner &quot;Chili&quot; Challis. Both shows had solid attendance, and even though the first show was a better &quot;book&quot; set, the second show was more alive, with more crowd interaction. I nailed a heckler&apos;s coffin shut, and it was the easiest slam I ever put on a guy...he practically handed it to me. His initial comment was something about me needing a woman, and I told him that if he kept flapping his lips, I was gonna use him like one. It brought down the mostly redneck house. I know that some bookers and clubs don&apos;t like it when you go into the audience, but I was pulled into the pool, and they were either gonna fish him or me out of the filter the next morning, and it damn sure wasn&apos;t gonna be me. I&apos;m not much for chest-beating, but it was the perfect response, and I learned the craft from watching my good friend and mentor Mike Dambra crush wanna-be spotlight-stealers night after night.
During the second show, Lansing comic (and Funniest Cop in America) Dwayne Gill stopped in and said hello. I know Dwayne from the NobodyLikesMe.com message boards, and it was great to meet him in person. He and Chili and I hung out and talked shop for a little while, and then we parted ways while the staff finished up sweeping up the popcorn and counting the cash.
Back at the hotel, I dove into doing the rest of my 2005 tax prep work, as I didn&apos;t want to bring any of it home unfinished. I got it all wrapped up and hit the rack about 3:30 A.M., and managed to get about 5 1/2 hours of sleep before packing up and hitting the road back home. I&apos;ve been fighting off a rather tenacious head cold, and I wanted to break up some of the phlegm I&apos;ve been carrying around like family heirlooms, so I bought a gallon of water and started chugging it. It helped quite a bit, butI had to stop and piss every 45 minutes, which demoralized me on long trips, because I feel like I&apos;m not getting anywhere. I actually stopped three times to go during my trip across Ontario, Canada, where I usually never stop. By the third time I had to go, my urine was so clear, it looked like it didn&apos;t even have any urine in it. I was flushed out, for sure. By the time I got home, it was about 6:30 in the evening, and I just spent the night decompressing from the drive and hoping to get to sleep.
Today I took my good friend and comedy buddy Ray Salah in to his doctor for some tests. They had to give him some pretty strong painkillers for the tests they were going to run on him, and it left him groggy and loopy, so I had to be there to drive him home. It meant sitting with him for four hours, but after 17 years of friendship, it went by like nothing. We caught some lunch after the appointment, which was especially important because Ray wasn&apos;t allowed to eat for 24 hours before the tests, so he was starving, and I hadn&apos;t eaten anything all day, and my thyroid medicine makes me particularly ravenous in my first waking hours (not that I&apos;m not usually hungry all day long, but it was laser-focused at the end of my waiting-room ride of the couch).
After I got home, I whipped up a nice homemade seafood chowder for my lovely wife, who&apos;s been suffering with the same type of chest cold that I have for the last week. She&apos;s also been trying to get better *and* take care of the baby, which is no mean feat; you cant&apos; just decide you&apos;re gonna take a nap and hope you feel better when you wake up, you have to wait until the baby goes down for *her* nap, and then sleep at the same time if you can. Consequently, even though I was pretty tired, I got to chopping the celery, potatoes and onions, and then opened cans of clams and packages of crab meat, and got the milk and butter boiling and whipped up what turned out to be a pretty magnificent first effort. I never made clam chowder or seafood chowder before, so today was a total learning experience. I&apos;m pretty accomplished in the kitchen, particularly with soups, so I wasn&apos;t worried. I also make a decent vegetarian chili that I have to say I&apos;m proud of...if you&apos;re rolling through Rochester, a knock on my door earns you a bowl (just call ahead, if you don&apos;t mind).
After our nice dinner, I passed around a bowl of the chowder to my mother-in-law who had just worked a 12-hour shift at the hospital, and then brought a bowl over to Ray, who I figured wasn&apos;t up to cooking for himself and would appreciate some food and company. When I got home, I spent about three hours playing with Harmony and read every book to her, played with every musical toy, played my guitar for her, and tickled her until she screached. I also learned that if I make the &quot;pretend sleep snoring&quot; noise, she emits her patented high-pitched shriek. It was great. All of the depression I had accumulated when I left home on Wednesday was drowned in a big pool of baby laughter. Hooray for daddy!
Also, today I learned that I picked up an extra night of work this week, so it&apos;s actually fleshed out into a pretty decent week. What with all the car repairs I have to get on my Toyota, the extra cash will come in handy. Life is good, dammit!
Treat someone nice today. The goodwill comes back, I assure you.

 Love On The Air (David Gilmour) 
Posted on 02/25/2006 at 12:29 PM
What do you do with a bad emcee? What makes a bad emcee?
In comedy, there&apos;s a whole lot of different ways to do the job correctly, and a whole lot more ways to screw it up. The curse is that for every crop of new comics that springs up month after month, there&apos;s a plethora of bad comics that move up to emcee based only on their time in the business, and not for quality or ability.
I&apos;m working with headliner &quot;Chili&quot; Challis at Connxtions Comedy Club in Lansing, Michigan. It&apos;s a good club that&apos;s been in business over 20 years. Our first show was a solid affair, with a crowd of about 150 or more. The shame was that this boat of a club, established during the comedy boom of the 80&apos;s, easily holds 300 or more, and currently, half the room is curtained off as to lessen the visual punch of a room that is mostly empty most of the time.
Chili and I did radio Friday morning, on the &quot;new&quot; 97.5 with Dave and Lisa D. If that&apos;s not a generic radio station, I don&apos;t know what is. I offered to go with Chili, because these morning radio shows can be painful chores, with gagging and puking d.j.&apos;s coughing up fake laughter and expecting you to spit out one-liners like a morning-prep jukebox. Thankfully, it was anything but the case; whereas most shows give you a couple of minutes to plug the show and burn a few of your best lines, Dave and Lisa actually interviewed us like we were proven commodities, were appreciative of our time, and gave us plenty of air to plead our case for the throngs of central Michigan listeners to come out and enjoy our show.
I wound up getting back to the hotel and sleeping another couple of hours, wasted from getting up early, and also from a head cold which has gripped me and I can&apos;t shake. I togged up and headed out looking for cold medication and lunch. The cold medication, I found at Wal-Mart, which also gave me a chance to clear out all of the deposit empties from the back seat of my car. I left the store with a pack of Alka-Seltzer Plus cold liqui-gels, which are not my drug of choice, but the store was sold out of the Sudafed Severe Cold Formula, which in my experience, is the fastest-acting product on the market. I&apos;ve taken three doses of the Alka-Seltzer since 3:00 yesterday afternoon, and I&apos;ve only had small periods of relief from the runny nose, which is the most daunting of my symptoms because you don&apos;t want to be wiping your nose on stage (or have watery phlegm run down your lip), and the continuous blowing of my nose has left it red and raw, which isn&apos;t a good stage look at all.
For lunch, I happened on an Old Country Buffet and a Chinese Buffet right next to each other, and I opted for the Old Country, just because the sanitation at the average Chinese place is always a crap shoot, no pun intended. I had a nice meal and then ambled my way back to to the hotel, where I got a couple of hours of sleep in before the 8:00 show. A hot shower and clean stage clothes were just what the doctor ordered, and although I was a little dried out, causing the occassional speck of white foam to come flying out of my mouth while I was speaking on stage, it was much more desireable than the runny-nose thing.
Our regular emcee for the week isn&apos;t here, and hasn&apos;t been since Wednesday. The replacement guy isn&apos;t an emcee. He&apos;s got some good material, but no stage presence or ability to exploit the funny lines to their greatest potential. It&apos;s unfortunate, because he&apos;s in the wrong position on the show; I actually think the show would be better if I opened, did all my time up front, brought him on as a guest, and then introduced Chili. The guy would prosper, rather than draw the indifference he&apos;s been catching from the audiences so far this week.
When I came off stage, Dave, the club manager, pulled me aside and told me that the emcee was mad at me because I was getting laughs and he wasn&apos;t. He took exception with some of my material as being uncreative, and thought he was getting a raw deal from the audience, but the plain fact of the matter is that you can&apos;t go up in the emcee role and just be angry, which he does, confront the audience, which he does, and do raw material without couching it to be acceptable by the masses, which he does. One joke he did was a suggestion that men marry women who are orphans, because when the wife turns up missing, there&apos;s no angry parents looking for her. That&apos;s a straight-up woman-bashing joke, and alienates half the audience right away, as well as any man in the audience with any sort of decency. I like a sick joke, as long as it&apos;s done with a wink, and this emcee doesn&apos;t do any sort of winking. In between shows, sitting at the &quot;comic&apos;s table&quot; in the back, I played dumb and made comments to our man along the lines of how tight the audience was, and how they really made us work, blah blah blah. The last thing I wanted to do is rub his nose in it that he&apos;s not a very good comic, but ultimately, it&apos;s the club&apos;s fault for hiring the guy. I know he&apos;s a last-minute replacement, but is he the best talent they could find?
Second show, we had about 60 people in the crowd, and our emcee fared little better with the more intimate group, and begged off from closing the show because he had to report to his day job at 7 A.M. the next morning. I graciously offered to close the show for him and let him go after bringing the headliner on stage, because there was no value in making him stick around...I certainly didn&apos;t think his company would have been cheerful, and after making a back-stabbing remark to the club manager, I already had a a handle on his estimation of me. I&apos;ve noticed that this is starting to become an annoying trend, emcees begging off from closing the show. In my opinion, it shows an impatience that is prevalent in the comedy business...no one wants to pay the dues, wait around, do the job as it&apos;s outlined. Every open-micer thinks they should be a paid emcee, every emcee thinks he should be middling, every middle thinks they should be headlining, and every headliner thinks they should be playing better clubs or working for more money. There&apos;s no honest analysis of ability and what the going rate for that ability is in today&apos;s marketplace. I agree that everyone should aspire to better than they currently have, but why doesn&apos;t anyone think they need to work for it anymore? It really pisses me off.
Today, I&apos;m going to go through some receipts I brought along as part of the never-ending attempt to get my home office under control. Pam and I have box after box of papers, receipts, flyers, magazines, catalouges, and every other piece of paper you could imagine, and it&apos;s choking off our modest living space. Also, getting the receipts together gets us one step closer to filing our federal income tax, which I want to get done before the April 15th deadline, and with the modest amount of time I have at home, even though it&apos;s six weeks away, there&apos;s only about half that amount of time that I&apos;m home and can actually attend to financial matters. Consequently, I have to make as much use of my &quot;down time&quot; as possible, and if I&apos;m going to be holed up in a hotel room (which conveniently has a nice desk in it to work at), then I should be able to make that work to my advantage.
I may try to make the six-hour drive home tonight after the second show, but I think with my cold-medicated state, I&apos;d be better off doing the drive during daylight hours. I&apos;ll make the decision later tonight, and hopefully I&apos;ll be feeling better, I&apos;d love to get home early and have the bonus time with Pam and Harmony. A big factor will also be how sick I am of this hotel room, and unfortunately, the AmeriHost is one of my favorite hotel chains to stay in...the amenities make it a nice place to stay, and it&apos;s hard to leave a place like that when you&apos;re used to being lodged in not-so-nice places.
If I don&apos;t check in tomorrow morning, I&apos;ll continue my blog Sunday night or Monday morning...I know you can&apos;t wait. ;)

 Blinded By The Light (Bruce Springsteen) 
Posted on 02/24/2006 at 12:25 AM
Comedy is my life. I perform comedy, book comedians, teach comedy, ran comedy clubs, managed a major comedy tour, and have generally immersed myself in the business of standup comedy, and it never ceases to amaze me.
Tonight at Connxtions in Lansing, Michigan with headliner &quot;Chili&quot; Challis, our show was augmented by an open-mic portion. The first comic was blind, and they didn&apos;t tell him he was going on first. Subsequently, when the mc called his name, the motherfucker was standing with me, way the hell at the back of the room, and they had to play the whole song to get him on stage as he had to assemble his stick and make his way up to the front of the room. Now, if you were the mc, wouldn&apos;t you tell this motherfucker, &quot;Hey, you&apos;re first, so why not take a seat like halfway up to the stage and I&apos;ll stretch your intro to get you up before the applause dies down?&quot; No, they didn&apos;t tell this man any damn thing, so he&apos;s talking to me back by the bar, and all of a sudden, he flips his collapsible cane open and starts ambling his legally blind but semi-sighted ass up to the stage. And the applause predictably dies down as they&apos;re waiting for this guy to make it, so from the back of the room, I &quot;jump start&quot; the applause again so he doesn&apos;t get up to dead silence. He was funny enough, but a rookie and raw, and the other two open micers were also raw and untested, and when I hit the stage to do my shortened set, I just started firing jokes at the audience like I was the last guy in my platoon and I was surrounded by Viet Cong. I table-danced for three old women sitting up front (and I mean, they were *bingo* old) and really just assaulted the mostly college-aged and largely detached audience. There was a big group in the back, like maybe 80 people, who were from some fraternity and it was &quot;fraternity date-night&quot; or whatever little thing it was called, and they were much more involved with talking and goofing around and comparing fake I.D.&apos;s than they were in listening to the show, so I just went gorilla on them and subdued them with my manly comedy force.
I was a little worried about my physical health last night...lately, my left leg has been going numb from my hipto my knee. A chiropractor informed me that it&apos;s caused by excess fat around the middle (of which I have no shortage) pushing on the main artery that delivers blood to the leg, causing numbness. Numbness I can handle, but in some cases, depending on the length of the sets I&apos;ve been doing, I&apos;ve had shooting pain.
I decided that I need to shed some pounds just to be able to do my basic job, which is one or two 30-minute feature sets a night. Today, I put on the sweats, headed for the hotel excercise room, and did 35 minutes on the treadmill. And while I was excercising and sweating away, my mind started wandering and I came up with a comedy bit that I&apos;m pretty sure will be a sure applause break when I fire it out. I may try it this weekend, or maybe I&apos;ll save it for open mic on Tuesday back home in Rochester, I&apos;m not sure.
After my excercise, I showered, and then went for a long walk to a strip mall across the street from the hotel. Most of the stores were closed, but I managed to walk for about 45 minutes, in no way as high an impact as being on the treadmill and having to keep pace (I decided to start with 3.5 miles per hour, and as I get stronger, I&apos;ll ramp that up), but still nicer than laying in bed, doing Sudoku puzzles, watching CNN and getting mad at President Bush (although I managed to do all of that stuff today, too).
I just saw a promo on TBS for a showing of Swordfish, and they showed the scene where Halle Berry is reading a book, and drops the book when Hugh Jackman comes out on the veranda, and shows her naked breasts. Somehow, she&apos;s wearing a gold bikini top...it ruins the whole movie! I didn&apos;t plan on writing about this, but it just flicked on the TV and I felt it needed addressing.
I have radio tomorrow to promote the weekend shows, so I&apos;m gonna split...morning will come soon enough. More updates as the weekend progresses.

Reporting to you live from my little command center at the AmeriHost Inn in Lansing, Michigan, this is Ralph Tetta. Good evening.
I&apos;m here and in one piece after unusual circumstances. I scheduled an overnight sleep study at the Sleep Disorder Clinic of Rochester, the second appointment in a three-visit treatment of my sleep apnea.
After my first overnight visit, in which I was monitored as I slept, it was determined that I have mild sleep apnea. Simply put, sleep apnea means you stop breathing as you sleep, and &quot;choke&quot; yourself awake several times during the night. During my study, it was determined that I stopped breathing eight times in a six-hour period. No wonder I was always waking up tired and disoriented. I&apos;d been choked while I slept.
Another problem was that my oxygen levels were dropping below 85%...that doesn&apos;t sound too bad, but apparently it&apos;s of some concern to doctors and people who actually paid attention in biology class.
So last night, I went back to the clinic for an overnight sleep study. They fitted me with a small oxygen mask that fit over my nose, sending continuous air down my windpipe. Then they glued sensors to my head, legs and chest and told me to sleep normally. Sure, I always sleep like Neo from &quot;The Matrix&quot; before he swallowed the pill and got unhooked.
I woke up around 5:45 this morning, and went home to get ready for my big trip to Central Michigan. When I got home, Pam and Harmony were up, which I was hoping against. I didn&apos;t want to wake them, as Pam&apos;s been sick and Harmony&apos;s just a bear to get back to sleep once she wakes up.
I showered, got the glue out of my hair, packed my luggage, and got ready to get on the road. At one point, Harmony realized where I was going, and for the first time since she was born, motioned to me not to leave. I&apos;ve been spending as much time as I can with her when I&apos;m home, playing with her and feeding her and reading to her, as much as my patience will allow. I hate to say it, but it&apos;s hard relating to her because I don&apos;t understand what she wants, but when I can figure out what she&apos;s getting at, I try as hard as I can to get it for her. Yesterday we played catch for about ten minutes, which was actually more like &quot;fetch&quot; because she hasn&apos;t gotten the hang of catching the ball just yet.
As I was hugging her and kissing her goodbye, she reached up and said &quot;Eat&quot; which is Harmony talk for &quot;Please take me to the kitchen and feed me. I&apos;ll sit in my chair and eat my carrots, green beans, boiled eggs, cheese ravioli, cheddar cheese or whatever you want me to have, and you&apos;ll sing to me and wiggle Pinkie Bear at me and do the voice and work her like a puppet and I&apos;ll giggle and be your baby daughter forever.&quot; And because I had the car loaded, and it was 9:00 and I had to hit the road, the answer had to be &quot;I&apos;m sorry, honey, but I can&apos;t do that right now,&quot; which just means &quot;No&quot; and is unacceptable to both of us. The only difference is that she cried right away, and I cried about five hours into the trip, when I was tired of being in the car, and tired of being away from home, and I paid for gas at the Speedway gas station and when I took out my wallet, and the picture of my little baby daughter looked up at me and twisted my heart like a piece of Silly Putty.
My car&apos;s still a mess, but it got me through Canada and across to Michigan, and when I checked into the AmeriHost, I grabbed a two-hour nap. I thought I slept better without all the sensors and wires, but I woke up disoriented and groggy. I set three alarms for 6:15, and two of them went off before I could respond. I don&apos;t know what happened to the third one, either it didn&apos;t go off, or I didn&apos;t set it right, but that&apos;s why I set three alarms...I&apos;m not gonna dog-leg it across two countries to get to the gig, and then oversleep...it&apos;s unacceptable.
I got to the gig, where I worked again with Bert &quot;Chili&quot; Challis for the second time in four weeks. We were treated to a grand total of 30 guests in the showroom, but Wednesdays and Thursdays at Connxtions aren&apos;t the &quot;money&quot; shows, they&apos;re basically just practice. Still, the folks were good and I actually sold a CD to someone after the show, which I think is good, because I think everyone should hear what my show sounds like when there&apos;s actually people in the room.
Tomorrow I think I&apos;m going to sleep in, and maybe later go out and do a little mall walking, or maybe I&apos;ll just use the excercise room here. I think the mall&apos;s going to win out because even though I don&apos;t feel like using the car any more than I have to, I hate the drudgery of the treadmill....I brought sweat pants, so it&apos;s an option, and I&apos;ll probably make a game-time decision.
More to report tomorrow. Sleep well.

Wrapping up the weekend in Charleston, West Virgina. I worked with headliner Just June...we&apos;d worked together before, and we had a good time this weekend. The club was full for every show, which was quite a difference from the last time I played the Comedy Zone there; it was July 4th weekend, and the place was a ghost town.
After the second show, I decided to go out and grab some late chow, which at 1 in the morning, usually means Taco Bell. Long story short, I was trying to find a Taco Bell in a plaza about 10 miles from my hotel...I had seen it the day before, but that was during the day. In the night, I got disoriented, went into the wrong plaza entrance and hit a divider, flattening my front driver&apos;s side tire.
My AAA membership had lapsed, and I had to renew over the phone. They sent a driver (after I unsuccessfuly tried changing the tire myself...the lug nuts were on so tight, I had no shot of loosening them...plus, it was about 15 degrees out).
I went to a 24-hour garage, and they hooked me up with a new tire, as well as hammering out my dented rim. It cost me $70 total, plus another $76 for the AAA renewal. By the time all was said and done, I got back to the room at 5:20 in the morning, no Taco Bell, lighter in the wallet, tired and pissed. Plus, I tore the heel away from my dress Oxfords running in the parking lot when the tow truck driver bypassed the Exxon station that I clearly told the AAA dispatcher I would be waiting at, and had to run the 300 yards in the cold so the tow truck driver wouldn&apos;t see that I had abandoned my lame car and split. Oh, and at the same time, about four fire engines responded to some alarm at a Chinese buffet restaurant right near my car....for a second, I figured the bitch caught fire on me, which would have been just my luck.
The kid at the 24-hour garage did the best job he could, but my car still shook like a sonofabitch all the way home today. I trucked home after about three hours of sleep, and I hit the road at 10:30, and rolled into my driveway right about 5:30...seven hours for what should have been an eight-hour trip.
Tomorrow, I&apos;ve got to start back at square one with my vehicle maintenance. I currently need a new rim, a front-end alignment, a diagnostic on my &quot;check engine&quot; light, a new passenger side seatbelt apparatus, and I need my driver&apos;s side rear door lock loosened (the door won&apos;t open) and need the trunk lock barrel replaced (I can open it with the latch near the gas cap release, but not with the key...very inconvenient).
At 288,000 miles, I question how much work I should really invest in this vehicle, but I&apos;ve had it so long and covered so much terrain in it, it really feels like an emotional loss thinking about getting another vehicle. I suppose it will take a major failure, like the engine dropping out or an accident that demolishes the thing (and probably killing me in the process) to make me replace it. Ah well.
This week, Lansing, Michigan awaits. I&apos;m working with Chili Challis for the second time in the last two months, and we have a charity show together at Gary Fields in Battle Creek in April. I&apos;ve worked with a lot of people, but never such a dense concentration of dates that arrived at random.
O.K., I gotta go talk on the phone and give President Bush something to listen to. Have a great week

 Misty Mountain Hop (Led Zeppelin) 
Posted on 02/17/2006 at 03:51 AM
I rumbled out of the mountains of West Virginia like an avalanche!
Before I get into that, if you want to add me to your friends list at myspace.com, the URL is http://www.myspace.com/rabidralph. I&apos;m starting a cult, so join up today!
O.K., enough plugging.
There&apos;s nothing like four hours of mountain driving to get yourself into the head of the redneck, what he thinks, what he feels, and why he believes the things he does.
I left the hotel in Bluefield, West Virginia and found the bank pretty quick...Bluefield is kinda spread out, so it took a couple of loops around their &quot;downtown&quot; area (all one-way streets) but finally I found the bank, cashed my check and was (cue timpani) OUTTA THERE!
What I didn&apos;t realize is that even though my journey was only 168 miles or so, it would take a full four hours to complete. At the bank, a foreshadowing occurred when I was walking down the block from where I parked my car to the door of the bank, and had to lean back because I was heading downhill at a 45 degree angle. The mountains of West Virginia are steep and relentless, and rather than plow them flat, the Mountaineers decided to just build on them and have their cities sloped and at an angle.
The drive to Prestonsburg, Kentucky looked like nothing on the map, but the Rand McNally road atlas doesn&apos;t tell you that you&apos;re going to be driving on corkscrew turns straight down, plummeting like you were sent to the seventh bolgia in Dante&apos;s Inferno. At one point, I saw gasoline for $1.99 a gallon, but I couldn&apos;t take advantage because I already filled up at $2.38 (the standard price through much of WV). I consider it a minor bummer, but I got over it.
The weather today was almost excruciatingly hot for an Upstate New Yorker who has already let his blood thicken up. It was 72 degrees today, or damn close to it, and I sweat like a death row inmate. I noticed that quite a few schools had children playing outside (supervised) and I felt a little cheated, because when I was a small child in school, we never got recess, or got to leave the school building until it was time to go home, for that matter. We had a nice playground area, but really no time to utilize it. Nonetheless, as a new father, I get homesick when I see the children because I&apos;m reminded of all the wonderful years of school that my daughter has in front of her. I had a mostly good grade school and high school experience, and I&apos;m going to try to provide that for Harmony.
Another thing I noticed is that in the tiny coal mining towns of West Virginia, the schools look new and great, and the Post Offices are little more than trailers with American flags in front of them. I guess I feel better that it&apos;s that way and not the other way around, but it still made me wonder a little bit. Also, I saw more commemorative train cars displayed in one day than I&apos;ve seen in my whole life. I guess that the trains were a big part of coal transportation (still are....I saw a freight yard with about 150 coal cars, all loaded and ready to go), and so every town has one train car, displayed with a plaque, and every single one of them was on a 20&apos; lenght of train track, like if they just put it on the grass, we wouldn&apos;t know what it was. Thanks, city fathers.
I checked in to the Holiday Inn in Prestonsburg, Kentucky sometime around 3:00 P.M.(the guy at the Holiday Inn in Bluefield said to me, &quot;Kentucky? Better watch yourself.&quot; Like a guy with New York plates on his car can just slide through West Virginia without getting epithets hurled at him). After 3 1/2 to 4 hours in the car, I&apos;d had about enough. The rock station in the area emanated from the town of Williamson, West Virginia, and was smack dab in the middle of my trip, so I listed to them, only they switched over from music to Rush Limbaugh between noon and 3...and it didn&apos;t even sound like direct feed...it actually sounded like the guy in the studio had another radio in there, tuned to another station that was playing the Limbaugh show, and holding a microphone up to the speaker. At first I thought it was bad reception, but the commercials were loud and clear, and then Rush would talk and sound all scratchy and muted.
Another point I would like to make is that I also never saw so many churches in my life. Considering that the number of houses I saw on Route 52 (Highway To Hell) was small, there were enough churches to accomodate at least triple the population. The weirdest thing was watching a Wal-Mart store pop up out of nowhere...as I was driving, I saw the sign but not the store, and then I looked to my left and down into a ravine, and there it was....it was like the store that time forgot, like it had just risen up out of the mossy creek that ran along side the road...*very* bizarre.
It seems as though the Southern Man (moreso than any other region) is subjected to only one viewpoint, and dissenters are looked upon as &quot;Godless&quot; and &quot;troublemakers,&quot; and lately, &quot;liberals&quot; who &quot;hate America.&quot; And because no one with a college education would really want to live in the rural slums and hollers and mountains, no one is there to call the Southerner on his opinions. Why is a rock station playing Rush Limbaugh? Because people want to hear it, and there&apos;s obviously some money being put behind the station, or they&apos;d be playing Lynyrd Skynyrd for the umpteenth time for Billy Bob who&apos;s dedicating &quot;Freebird&quot; to his cousin Dicky who died when the car he was working on fell off the lift and crushed his chest. And that&apos;s all we need, is Rush Limbaugh being fed to these folks through tinny speakers, trumpeting the conservative viewpoint and banging the drum that is causing the destruction of many of their communities. Ask the former workers of the manufacturing centers if it&apos;s o.k. to maintain stockholder equity by holding down minimum wage and outsourcing jobs to Mexico, India and China. Ask the families of deceased mine workers if it&apos;s o.k. to lobby for smaller government, and to put fewer regulations on mining companies in terms of worker safety.
Ah, let them hang themselves. I guess it&apos;s o.k. to be penniless and destitute, as long as women can&apos;t get abortions on demand. My curse is that I care about strangers, and maybe I should just worry about myself because I can&apos;t change the world. Still, I get so aggravated, I want to go deer hunting with Dick Cheney wearing a pair of fake antlers on my head.
On a good note, I&apos;m working with Just June this weekend, and we had worked together before, so I&apos;m happy...not that I don&apos;t like working on the road with comics I haven&apos;t met before, but it&apos;s just easier meeting up with old friends and not having to do all that ice-breaking shit. June and I worked in Charleston, South Carolina, and we were down there during shrimp season, and they were having a big shrimp-fest. June is a black lady who does impressions of Moms Mabely (the old Chitlin-circuit comedian) and closes her show with a Tina Turner impersonation. So she did the morning radio to promote the show in Charleston, SC, and the radio guys told her that they were going to be broadcasting live from the shrimp-fest, and that she should come down because they would tighten her up with all the shrimp she could eat.
11 o&apos;clock in the morning,my phone rings in my hotel room....it&apos;s June.
&quot;C&apos;mon, boy, we&apos;re gonna go get some scrimps.&quot;
&quot;June, I&apos;m pretty tired....I think I&apos;ll pass.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m driving. Get your ass outta bed.&quot;
*giving in* &quot;O.K., June, I&apos;ll go. I gotta take a shower first.&quot;
&quot;You ain&apos;t gotta wash your ass, boy, just get in the car!&quot;
June is something else, I tell you what. When we got there, it was piss raining and the radio guys were packing up shop, but June got them to stop doing what they were doing, namely getting all of their high-end radio broadcasting equipment out of the rain, and got them to go over to the shrimp tent and procede to hook us up with several shrimp plates. They had fried shrimp and big peel-&apos;n&apos;-eat jobbers, along with coleslaw and hushpuppies and the like. Then after that, we headed to a fisherman&apos;s wharf, and by that time the rain had broken, and June pulled a cooler out of her trunk and bought about $75 worth of fresh seafood and barked at these chunky longshoremen like they were hired hands. June is all of about 5&apos; 6&quot;, but her voice is on the starting bench for the Knicks.
Tonight&apos;s show wasn&apos;t as packed as I thought it&apos;d be, the last time I was here, the lounge was jammed. Still, it was a good crowd, and a little older than last time...no college kids to speak of, so my marriage stuff went over pretty good. I sold a few discs after the show, made some lunch money, and they cashed my check, which will save me a few minutes tomorrow from hunting down the bank (not that that&apos;s a problem, the whole town is only five blocks long).
Charleston, West Virginia is about two hours and change to the east, so I&apos;m going to sleep in this morning, although staying up writing weblogs until 4 AM isn&apos;t really helping matters. I took a long nap this afternoon, so that&apos;s throwing off my sleep. Maybe tomorrow I&apos;ll try to straighten things out. I do know that I&apos;ll miss Prestonsburg, Kentucky...you gotta give it up to a community where even the white girls have badonkadonks.
Peace, wherever you are.

 Talk (Coldplay) 
Posted on 02/16/2006 at 08:31 AM
Bluefield, West Virginia is trying to kill me!
In spite of that, I hope everyone had a good Valentine&apos;s Day, either spending some quality time with the love of your life, or in the absence of that, making it through the day without sucking on the business end of a shotgun...of course, if you did that, you wouldn&apos;t be reading this, so disregard if it applies to you.
I got all the maintenance done on my trusty steed, the Periwinkle Toyota Corolla with 287,000 miles on it. At Jiffy Lube, they informed me that my front tires were filled with nitrous (the new thing in tire inflation....more costly than regular) and I was a little irked because when I bought them at Dunn Tire, they didn&apos;t mention that to me....and I do know from the signage in the store, nitrous costs about $5 extra per tire. I don&apos;t feel cheated because I received the product I paid for, but I do feel cheated because I didn&apos;t ask for that product, and they took it upon themselves to upgrade me. I used to swear by Dunn Tire and their service, and now I&apos;m upset because I have to take another look at them.
Valentine&apos;s Day, my lovely wife of the last five years (eleven if you count all of our time together) accompanied me to Red Lobster for a nice dinner date. Mama Davis volunteered to watch little Harmony Rose so we could have dinner undisturbed, which I thought was very nice of her. We got to the restaurant about 8:00, and it was *jammed!* They gave us a pager and told us it would be an hour and a half wait, so we went and did some light shopping, picking up some clothing for the infant (she&apos;s growing so fast, we needed some new pajamas) and some miscellaneous kitchen items.
We returned to Red Lobster in time to hear our name being called, and we were whisked to our table. Our server was flying around like a plastic shopping bag in a windstorm (like all the other servers), and we got our order in quick-style, as to keep things efficient. We got our bread but no plates, and I spotted a stack on a server station across the dining room. Rather than sit and steam about it, or wait for our server to reappear, I walked over and retrieved a couple of plates for Pamela and myself. I was dedicated to the idea of having a nice time with my wife, and we get so few opportunities that I didn&apos;t want a little inconvenience to spoil the evening.
Pamela was in rare form....she&apos;s as funny as she could be, but she really made me laugh. There was a party of four seated a couple of tables away, and we had seen them come in...it was two young guys, either Hispanic or Italian or some cocky ethnicity, dressed in fur coats (that&apos;s right....fur coats) and their dates. Pammey called them &quot;Poser Mobile&quot; (&quot;Fees, shorty, fees!&quot;) and I about fell out of my chair. She&apos;s getting good and vicious in her (old) middle age...I think I&apos;m rubbing off on her.
I wound up not getting to sleep until almost 3 A.M., and I had a 7 A.M. alarm set to hit the road by 8...I have a bad habit of getting insomnia the night before a big trip. There was extra pressure to be on time, because I was picking up fellow comic Mike Dambra to shuttle him to Buffalo where he&apos;s playing the Comix Cafe this weekend, and I didn&apos;t want to be late. I managed to get to his house only a few minutes late (and after five years, I think he expected that). We hit the New York State Thruway and I dropped him off at the comedy condo, and continued south.
I passed through Buffalo and Erie, PA, and then down through Pittsburgh. I was happy as hell to make it to Morgantown, West Virginia at the northern border of the state, but my trip was only half over at that point. The next five hours was a steady mountain drive, pushing uphill and coasting down the other side for what seemed like forever. I got to Bluefield around 5:30, and slept the sleep of the damned. Originally, I thought I had an 8 P.M. show, but further examination of my itinerary indicated that showtime wasn&apos;t until 9:30....a bonus of an hour and a half to sleep and rest. I needed it.
Bluefield is a nice room....the bar is called Kelsey&apos;s in the Holiday Inn, and it&apos;s always a bonus to be performing right in the hotel you&apos;re staying in. I used this room as a vehicle to get back to New York State from Florida in September of 2004, the time of my infamous abcess injury. I also had the flu the last time I was here, and barely made it home alive. Every time I&apos;ve played here, I&apos;ve been tired or injured, and I was hoping to break the cycle last night.
Unfortunately, even though I was rested and ready (two cups of coffee helping me along), the crowd was mostly disassociated. I did my contractual 35 minutes, but it was clear about 15 minutes into the show that the crowd of 50 or so would rather talk at their tables than listen to anything I had to say, and even though there were a few tables that were clearly into the show and laughing, it was too difficult to overpower the group in the middle of the room that just didn&apos;t give a damn.
Headliner Brian T. Shirley, from Charleston, South Carolina, fared little better, and after the show, Laurie the lounge manager paid us and apologized up and down for the substandard audience. Normally, I don&apos;t blame the crowd, but I pulled out every trick in the book, and got no love whatsoever. Brian, who is a very funny comic, actually walked a table of four, which made no sense because they were one of the tables that were actually paying attention during my show. It was surreal and weird.
Today is Prestonsburg, Kentucky, and another one-nighter in a Holiday Inn. I had a very good show the last time I was there, and it&apos;s only a three-hour drive from Bluefield. I&apos;m looking forward to it, because at least I know what to expect...it&apos;s a real rabble-rousing type room...the only way I survived the last time was to pick out the drunkest guy in the room and start picking him apart. They liked that, and while it&apos;s not my favorite type of comedy to do, I&apos;ll not die the death of a dog....not like last night.
O.K., so it&apos;s back to sleep for a couple of hours, cash my check, and then head on to the Bluegrass State and get settled in for the show. I&apos;ll report back tomorrow, or maybe later tonight with the show report.
Stay healthy.

Greetings from the frozen tundra of Rochester, New York....we barely escaped the Nor&apos;easter that is currently burying or has buried a great number of the capitals of the East, with only a few inches of snow accumulating, but with great cold and significant wind chill. It&apos;s days like these that I question the wisdom of my grandmother, who, upon arriving in this fair country from sunny Italy, landed on Ellis Island, started on her way via the New York State Thruway, and got as far as Rochester, and declared, &quot;This is it.&quot;
I drove home from Toledo on Sunday, and didn&apos;t have any car trouble, thank you Lord. I&apos;m taking her in to get checked out tomorrow, and I think a trasmission power-flush may be what the doctor ordered for my precious Toyota Corolla, now teetering over the halfway mark between 286,000 and 287,000 miles. I&apos;m getting an oil change tomorrow as well...I use Quaker State Synthetic oil in the car exclusively, and Jiffy Lube does the work every time, and I was rewarded for my loyalty with a $10.00 rebate check in the mail while I was away, so that&apos;s nice. The synthetic oil really helps alleviate engine wear and I credit it with the good condition of my engine despite the high mileage.
Today was a day spent taking care of myself, which is why the car isn&apos;t getting checked out until tomorrow. I had my three-month checkup with my personal physician, Dr. Megan Terwilliger, and while I&apos;m not exactly the picture of health, my overall physical condition is improving. I took my lovely wife and daughter with me, as Pamela is considering switching physicians and thought it might be nice if we both had the same doctor, plus, I&apos;ve talked Dr. Terwilliger up as being very good, and Pamela met her today and liked her and felt comfortable talking to her. Dr. Terwilliger is impressed with the condition of my feet, which based on my job (standing and driving) and propensity towards diabetes (the enemy of all feet) should mean that my peds would have a number done on them, but I&apos;m very fastidious about my podiatric care, washing, keeping nails trimmed, checking for athlete&apos;s foot and any dermal breakdown. I guess the first time I heard that someone lost their feet due to diabetes, it put a pretty bad scare into me, and I decided long ago that that wasn&apos;t going to happen to me. One bad habit that I will confess to is that I usually walk around barefoot like some sort of monkey or hillbilly because I just don&apos;t like slippers, and socks make my feet sweat.
Today, we picked up lunch for Pamela&apos;s grandmother at Arby&apos;s (yes, we had a coupon) and we enjoyed a delicious lunch of roast beef sandwiches, with Pamela taking advantage of the limited time offer of the fine Arby&apos;s fish sandwiches (not being a consumer of beef or beef by-products). Harmony brightened Great-Grandma Ciuffini&apos;s day, and we had a nice afternoon watching Harmony run around the house and pick up everything that wasn&apos;t nailed down, when she wasn&apos;t enjoying her &quot;fwies.&quot; I regaled Mrs. Ciuffini with my tales of the road, and made her laugh, which is the best medicine, although at 92 years of age, she wasn&apos;t willing to give up the medications that her doctor prescribed for her.....ha ha. I&apos;m a stitch.
This week I&apos;m on the way to West Virginia and Kentucky, and I&apos;m looking forward to returning to West Virgina after a hiatus of over a year. I&apos;d much rather work West Virginia and Tennessee than South Carolina and Alabama....I think those states are different because they actually have some light industry rather than just depending on a farm economy...the folks seem a little more enlightened, or at least less encumbered by singular viewpoints.
Now Kentucky is another case entirely....it&apos;s moonshine, hillbilly, shit-kicking time. As soon as they hear &quot;New York,&quot; it&apos;s bring out the bare knuckles and the brown liquor. Last time I was there, it was a clinic in heckler-killing and crowd control....no subtelty, just bash &apos;em over the head.
Let the games begin.

 Message of Love (The Pretenders) 
Posted on 02/12/2006 at 03:35 AM
&quot;We are all of us in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars....&quot;
They only threw out three tables at the late show tonight....that&apos;s good isn&apos;t it?
Submitted for your approval, the weekend wrap-up here in Toledo, Ohio, and my week-long engagement at Connxtions Comedy Club; Friday night was pretty tame as far as Friday nights go. Headliner John Roy, mc Kate Brindle and I were joined by a guest spot kid, Anthony PleaseDon&apos;tThinkIllOfMeBecauseICan&apos;tRememberHisNameAsHeWasLargelyUnspectacular. He did spots on both shows Friday and the late show Saturday, causing my time in all instances to be shortened. As it were, I took a low estimation of the youngster, also that he was wantonly ripping of Dane Cook and had all the style with no punchlines to speak of. Also, he was crowding the merchandise counter as John and I were hawking our stuff, and he had no merchandise but was merely milking the audience for some of that &quot;I&apos;ll shake your hand because you were good, too&quot; love.
I stayed up late Friday night and alphabetized all of the comics I brought with me, and found out that I bought a lot of stuff twice...I had a lot of duplicates, which makes me feel bad, as comics are $2.50 each and up nowadays. I remember (yeah, I sound like my dad) when I used to buy comics back in 1974 for 20 cents, and they went up to 25 cents in 1976. The jump to 30 cents was 1977, and by 1978, Marvel comics were up to 35 cents and DC decided to go a different route, made their comics 8 pages bigger than the competition, and jacked the price up to 50 cents.
By 1980, the madness had subsided and comics were 40 cents across the board, and then the jumped to 50 cents, 65 cents, 75 cents, and then right up to a buck. Somewhere in the early 90&apos;s, I lost track. Now they&apos;re up to $2.50, and as high as $4.95 in some instances. It just doesn&apos;t seem right, but to be fair, they&apos;re not using that crappy pulp paper they used to use...it&apos;s all coated, semi-glossy paper, and the art and stories are much more mature. They&apos;re still just comic books, though, and it seems weird to think that they&apos;ve increased in price 2000% over a 30-year period...I guess I&apos;ll be bitching when postage stamps finally jump over $1.00 each...with the advent of e-mail, it&apos;s got to be coming in my lifetime (and I&apos;m really not counting on living but another 25 years or so).
So I was up late alphabetizing comics, and I finished my little project, looked at the clock, and it was 6 A.M.! I slept pretty soundly, and didn&apos;t get up until bout 2:30, and by the time I showered and shaved and went out foraging for food, it was 4:30. I got sent up the street to a Chinese place (not a buffet, but good) and had a nice Hunan Beef, with an eggroll and a bowl of hot &apos;n&apos; sour soup. Also, I had the tea, which I almost never do. Dinner (lunch? breakfast? It *was* the first meal of the day) was good, and I had some leftovers, which I took back to the room.
On the way back to the hotel, I saw a restaurant named &quot;Ralphie&apos;s,&quot; and I stopped in because my father, also named Ralph, likes things with the name &quot;Ralph&quot; on them. Back when the movie &quot;King Ralph&quot; starring John Goodman was in the theaters, he gleefully snapped up any paraphenalia pertaining to the film, in particular, the New York State Lottery instant scratch-off game tickets called &quot;King Ralph&quot; that were available in conjunction with the theatrical release. So, knowing that my dad enjoys that sort of thing, and has a birthday coming up in May (he&apos;ll be 73), I went in and wanted to pick up some memorabilia from the joint, maybe a take-out menu, some matches, or something nice. Come to find out, they had shirts with the restaurant logo! And they were nine bucks! I got him a nice grey T-shirt with the logo, and the nice servers who were helping me grabbed take-out menus and stuff for me, once they learned what I was up to (of course, I shared the whole story with them). I find that people are generally very nice and want to help others, especially when you&apos;re from out of town and looking to do something nice for your elderly father.
After a quick stop back at the room to put my Chinese leftovers on ice, I went next door to the Maumee Antique Mall. I had a nice walk, and looked at many old collectible artifacts, including comic books that apparently no one really knew the value of, because they were all priced as though they were signed by Abraham Lincoln, wrapped in gold, and came with a scoop of Beluga caviar. I did find a couple of &quot;Champions&quot; comic books from the 70&apos;s for $2 each, which isn&apos;t a bad price. Plus, I&apos;m pretty sure I don&apos;t already have them....o.k., I&apos;m sure about one of them, but I&apos;d rather guess wrong and have two copies then guess wrong and have no copies...I can always give one away to Shaun.
Tonight, it started snowing, and they had been calling for the Northeast to get a good amount of the fluffy white stuff, and it brought the folks out in droves. First show was very healthy, with only a few empty tables, and the second show was *jammed.* First show was a typical Saturday 8 PM show, older couples, not real comedy fans but just people who wanted to see a show and decided to come out. I gave them some of the easiest comedy I had, no real &quot;thinker&quot; type jokes, and they laughed heartily, bought souvenir CD&apos;s and DVD&apos;s, and I shook many hands. It&apos;s that thrill of knowing that the audience came to be entertained and I was able to serve it up nice for them and exceed their expectations that keeps me going in this business.
In between shows, Kate and I did the pal-around thing, I brought in the zodiac book that I bought and she checked out her combination sign. The book is called &quot;The New Astrology&quot; and makes up 144 different combination signs by taking your conventional zodiac sign (Aries, Taurus, Pisces, Scorpio, etc) and combining it with the Chinese zodiac sign of your birth year (Dragon, Rabbit, Horse, etc) Needless to say, she felt that it described her to a &quot;T.&quot; Most people who read their description in the book are floored by how accurate it is, which is why I was so bummed about losing the book. I loaned it to a co-worker when I was bartending at the Aja Noodle Company in Rochester, and the co-worker left the company&apos;s employ one weekend when I was on the road, and I never saw him again to get the book back. Luckily I found a copy at at thrift store only a few blocks from the hotel, and for only $1.99. I consider it a fortunate coincidence; I wasn&apos;t even planning on going into that store, but I made a wrong turn trying to get to Kinko&apos;s and saw the store and decided to go in to look around. I wound up coming out with three books and a tape copy of Christopher Cross&apos; debut album. &quot;Ride Like The Wind&quot; is still one of my favorite songs, and that&apos;s just because a British heavy metal band called Saxon covered it and I have the 12&quot; single of it.
Second show was a car sliding on black ice headed towards a man on crutches with a blind dog on a leash in one hand and an infant in the other. It was a disaster waiting to happen. On the way in, an early-arriving couple struck John and me up in conversation, and it was clear that they were both drunk, he of the quiet, smiling variety and she of the obnoxious, &quot;look-at-me,-I-can&apos;t-shut-up&quot; variety. Amazingly, even though the young lady (o.k., she wasn&apos;t that young) tried her level best to interject her voice into my act, but everytime she started to talk from her sixth-row back seat, I started talking fast and loud and just ran over her. And at the same time, three other tables wound up getting the elbows and knuckles from the club&apos;s bouncers because their table talk was disturbing the paying customers around them. In the lobby, as they were buying my CD&apos;s, they all seemed like nice people, but then again, this was away from the showroom crowd, so it was a whole different circumstance. I wound up moving a few dozen units for the week, the cheaper CD&apos;s mostly rather than the DVD&apos;s which all of last year and the year before, customers were complaining that I didn&apos;t have....Gol-dang-it!
Tomorrow&apos;s the six-hour drive home, and I&apos;m hoping the car won&apos;t have any major problems, as I was unable to get the transmission serviced this week. It&apos;s job one on Monday morning, and as long as I can make it home, I should be o.k. I&apos;m also hoping that the weather isn&apos;t too intrusive, or at the very least, that the DOT&apos;s from Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York are on point with the snowplows and salt. Otherwise, it could be a torturous trip. And I believe I&apos;ve suffered enough.
Happy Valentine&apos;s Day to you all, my friends.

 Welcome To The Working Week (Elvis Costello) 
Posted on 02/10/2006 at 05:05 AM
It&apos;s amazing what you can do when you put your mind to it.
For instance, today, I didn&apos;t leave my hotel room. I had foodstuffs in the room, and cooked a variety of meals with my electric wok, kept stuff cold with a nice styrofoam cooler and ice (courtesy of the Red Roof Inn), and communicated with the world via my laptop and cell phone. It was like I was running an actual business or something.
I sent out avails, the comedy term meaning open dates available for booking, around 8:00 this morning. I put a call in to Joel Pace at the Comedy Zone and didn&apos;t quit calling until I got him on the phone. I secured three weeks of work with him, and then moved on. I got dates in Greensboro, North Carolina, Panama City, Florida, and Johnson City, Tennessee, the run where a redneck guy stuck his tongue in my ear on stage in Paducah, Kentucky. I vowed never to go there again, but apparently that&apos;s where the money is, so I&apos;m going.
I got a couple of e-mails back from some bookers who had ones and twos to offer, but the best score of the day came from Ken Muller from Comedy Productions in Sioux City, Iowa. I sent him a tape a couple of years ago, but the sound was bad (my deck-to-deck VCR system wasn&apos;t duplicating the sound very well) and I never wound up connecting with him. He&apos;s still on my list of bookers that I e-mail with avails, and he responded back with an offer to fill my remaining open week in April. I called him right away, and he gave me the week (a decent paying week, at that) and offered me two more weeks. I almost single-handedly booked the month of May today (I&apos;m still short a week), and took big bites out of June and August. By my estimation, I scored over $4000 worth of work in one morning! Imagine if I really put my mind to this stuff on a regular basis instead of striking oil like Jed Clampett and a random shot.
The funny thing about the Muller discussion was that I sent him a copy of my DVD this week, and I couldn&apos;t tell if he was responding to my e-mail because he got it and watched it, or if he was just throwing the work at me because he heard good things from other comics who have worked with me in the field. He threw a couple of names around which leads me to believe that there are individuals out there who are advocating on my behalf, but he wasn&apos;t sure who it was exactly, which means my policy of being nice to everyone is paying off. I think that being funny may help a little, too.
So I spend the day in the room, working on comedy stuff, updating my AOL homepage with my newly scheduled appearance dates, doing Sudoku puzzles and just killing time until showtime. I got to the club just a little before headliner John Roy and mc Kate Brindle, and we talked about comedy, career goals, traded stories and anecdotes from other comedians that we knew in common (Jef Brannan, if your ears are ringing, it&apos;s not the Crown, I was talking about you, brother....all from a place of love, though). It was open mic night before the regular show, so my set got cut to 20 minutes, but I still had a good time and sold a decent amount of product after the show. It amazes me that merchandise sales are good after short sets, I think there&apos;s an enormous amount of pressure to introduce myself and make an audience like me in such a short amount of time, and I&apos;m really pushing this week because I want to sell enough stuff to get a transmission service done on my car (there&apos;s a Toyota dealership right up the road from the hotel) to minimize the chance of dropping my tranny on the way home on Sunday (or Saturday night, depending on the weather and how rested I feel). If I do well with the merch on Friday night (2 shows, I think I have a pretty good chance), I can get the work done Saturday morning and breathe easy on the way home. If not, then I&apos;ll have to white-knuckle it home.
My wife Pamela, the brains of our marriage, worked very hard and came up with a bumper-sticker design and a T-shirt design from my act that I may develop into a new merchandise item to offer after shows. I don&apos;t even know how to test-market them, anything I&apos;ve put out in the past usually sold itself and there wasn&apos;t a lot of thinking involved. I have mixed feelings about offering a T-shirt, bumper sticker, CD and DVD after a show, which is what I would probably do; on the one hand, there are people who are predisposed to wanting a T-shirt over a CD or DVD, and vice-versa; older people generally would want the shirt over the electronic media, and in the South, I also find that the shirt is more popular as well. Also, a bumper sticker is lower priced, and is often more attractive to folks who want a souveneir but don&apos;t want to spend a lot of money (or don&apos;t have much to begin with). On the other hand, it seems a little bit whore-ish (it&apos;s a word, look it up) to tote the walking garage sale into the lobby of the club after your set, especially if one or both of the other comics also have merchandise...then it&apos;s just crazy. Bottom line, I have a family to support, and I&apos;m going to do what it takes to provide for them, and if that means toting the garage sale, well then, let the games begin...I&apos;ll find a reason to hold my head up.
O.K., I haven&apos;t been to bed yet, I think I may have overdone it with the caffeine, even though all I had was half a Diet Coke from before. Maybe I&apos;m still percolating with the excitement of the day, but I need to get some sleep.
I hope today is fruitful for you, gentle reader, and you get closer to your goals and dreams.

 The Breakup Song (The Greg Kihn Band) 
Posted on 02/09/2006 at 08:12 AM
Good morning from the Red Roof Inn in Maumee (Toledo), Ohio. I&apos;m here, a scant 370 miles from home, and lucky for it.
My best-laid mice-like plans of leaving and arriving early were sent awry courtesy of my circadian rhythm which lately hasn&apos;t allowed me to get to sleep until 4 A.M. each morning, which is inconvenient at best. I wound up getting up a couple of hours later than planned, and hitting the road at noon, rather than 10:00 A.M. as hoped.
The gist being that for a six-hour drive (which I could shave down by speeding), leaving at 10 A.M. would allow me to roll into town at 4 P.M., time to have a nice nap, shower and a meal before the big 8 P.M. show. Leaving at noon meant no nap, and no wiggle room for bad weather, traffic or unforseen car trouble. I didn&apos;t anticipate any of these things, but the car trouble thing was on my mind because my AAA membership lapsed and I haven&apos;t renewed it (nothing like needing it and not having it) and my &quot;check engine&quot; light has been on...signs point to transmission issues, which due to the high mileage of my vehicle dictates that I need to have the system serviced by the dealer rather than my beloved Jiffy Lube, purveyors of all manner of car care and located conveniently all over the country (they said they could service it, but could not guarantee the work due to the 285,000 miles I previously drove).
So at noon, I hit the highway and sped happily through the metopoli of Buffalo, NY and Erie, PA, on my way through the I-90 corridor towards Cleveland, OH (the most boring patch that Interstate 90 offers) and I experienced a little snowfall in Buffalo, but nothing to be concerned about. Little did I know that the horrors of lake effect snow, which denizens of the Great Lakes will understand to be hellacious, unrelenting and merciless, were about to be unleashed upon me and my battle-scarred Toyota Corolla.
I rolled into and through Cleveland around 4 P.M., and I was hoping for the best, to beat rush-hour traffic, when the snow started falling. And when I say falling, I mean a whole winter&apos;s worth of the white stuff started coming down and even though my fully-warmed car windshield melted every fluffy Christmas flake as it hit, the cold road just allowed it to pile up, causing slick bobsled tracks with tire ruts cut into them from the vehicle before. It wasn&apos;t long before we were slowed to 10 miles per hour, which with 90 miles to go, I calculated that my trip would take an additional nine hours, putting me in Toledo about 5 hours after showtime. Plus I had to pee.
Thankfully, the traffic broke and by the time I entered the toll portion of the I-90 in Ohio, the roads were clear of both frozen crystallized precipitation and other travellers and their vehicles. I shot happily down the road, my &quot;check engine&quot; light cheerfully twinkling back at me from my dashboard like the star of Bethlehem.
I arrived at the Red Roof and checked in without incident (always a plus, in my book...sometimes the club forgets to make the reservation, which I never understood....if you&apos;re a comedy club, and you know you have at least two comics coming in from out of town EVERY WEEK, how exactly do you just forget to make the reservations? I&apos;m not accusing Connxtions, my employer this week, of ever being guilty of this, but with other clubs, believe me, it&apos;s happened), and got to the business of showering and shaving and made it to the club with a few minutes to spare of their requested 7:30 P.M. arrival time. I don&apos;t know why they insisted that I be at the club a half-hour early, but the printed itinerary threatened a docking or cancelling if that criteria was not met, so I complied. When I arrived, the staff sort of mulled around in that listless way that I hate to see, the way that indicates that no one wanted to be in charge, and they all just wanted to go home. I attempted to be friendly to a couple of them, and one of them was friendly back but not very talkative, and another just walked past me like I hadn&apos;t said anything at all, so I just chose a seat in the back of the club and sat quietly until showtime.
A little before 8 P.M., I decided to press my luck and ask for coffee, to get a little caffeine in my system and stave off the effects of a six-hour, bad weather drive with no afternoon nap, and when coffee wasn&apos;t available (they offered to make a fresh pot, but I didn&apos;t want them to do that on my account), I settled on a diet coke. As I was exiting the service bar area, comedian Jimmy Hamm, a performer who had appeared in Rochester several times when I was General Manager of the club, whisked past me, and as our eyes met, a recognition sparked, even though Jimmy had changed considerably, his hair several shades darker, his clothing less conservative, and a few pounds lighter all around (I&apos;m sure I looked different, too). We exchanged greetings and wound up sitting down and catching up with the last couple of years, which for Jimmy included a divorce, a move from Detroit to Toledo, and a radio job.
Jimmy&apos;s jocking for KISS-FM here in Toledo, and he&apos;s the morning show host and the host of the Wednesday night comedy show at Connxtions, which drew a little bit better than the last time I was here. We started a little late, but not terribly late, and I was asked to do 20 minutes. I think I went over, but had no way of knowing because I forgot to look at my watch when I hit the stage. They didn&apos;t flash the light at me, so I figured I was o.k., and after I left the stage I checked with Jimmy and everything was fine. The set went well, and then headliner John Roy, formerly of Chicago and now living in Los Angeles, had a good show and really made me laugh with his act, which I had never seen before. He has a good blend of laughs and message, which is something that I really respect...it&apos;s exactly what I&apos;m aspiring to do with my show. After the show was over, we set up our merchandise, and sales were soft, but acceptable. We had a lot of nice comments, and before Jimmy split, we arranged for me to do a call-in on his show on Friday morning. We&apos;re going to do a prank where I&apos;m going to call in and say that I&apos;m planning on breaking up with my girlfriend before Valentine&apos;s Day, and I&apos;d plannned on doing it before Christmas, and then New Year&apos;s, and didn&apos;t want to be mean but now it&apos;s turned into this long, drawn-out thing. The purpose of the call is to rile up the mostly female listeners of the station and get them to call in and lambaste me about my insensitivity (which of course, most women love). I&apos;m really looking forward to doing it, I think it&apos;s gonna be a blast.
I hit Meijers after the show and picked up some groceries, and I think I&apos;m going to just stay in the room today. I&apos;ve got my wok and kitchen stuff, along with a cooler to keep my cold stuff, so I can do some hotel-room cooking. I might venture out to get some copying done, I have CD&apos;s and DVD&apos;s this week, but noinsert cards, so I might get that done or just gamble that the ones I have that are completed will satisfy tonight&apos;s after-show sales. Frankly, I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m up this early to begin with, so depending on when I wake up from my afternoon nap (and oh, I&apos;m getting one, believe you me), I&apos;ll decide whether or not that&apos;s a today task or a tomorrow task. I brought along a box and a half of comic books, which represent the stuff I&apos;ve purchased over the last year or so, and it all needs to be alphabetized and filed in amongst my main collection. Several of the books I got are going to be farmed out to my wife&apos;s &quot;nephew&quot; Shaun, who has a birthday coming up, so I want to get those separated so the young lad doesn&apos;t get stiffed. And Lord knows, there&apos;s nothing better than a big box of comics for your birthday when you&apos;re 15. I&apos;m 39, and that&apos;s what I would want.....
I think I&apos;m going to enjoy a nice chilled can of pineapple and a look at this morning&apos;s USA today to check out the Grammy winners, seeing as I missed the show last night, and only got to see the finale, which included Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Dr. John, and some other folks I couldn&apos;t identify. I think Bonnie Raitt was singing backup and playing guitar, but I can&apos;t be sure. Also, I&apos;m pretty sure the Edge from U2 was on stage.
Have a nice day, and get some rest.

 Masters of War (Bob Dylan) 
Posted on 02/07/2006 at 11:26 AM
As chronicled below, I&apos;ve been in &quot;housekeeper&quot; mode today, doing lots of good, mindless cleaning chores, like laundry, taking out the garbage, doing up dishes, and letting my mind wander. One of the things I like to do is listen to talk radio while I&apos;m working, it&apos;s good background if nothing else, and also if some breaking news event happens, I won&apos;t miss it. This technique allowed me to see the second plane crash into the World Trade Center live on television, unfortunately. It&apos;s one of those minutes I&apos;d trade you in a heartbeat, but I&apos;d probably regret not seeing it....it&apos;s the JFK assassination &quot;where were you when it happened&quot; moment of our generation, or at least right up there with the Challenger exploding after takeoff.
So I&apos;m listening to commentary on the White House wiretapping program, and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales&apos; testimony to that end, and my mind floats away, and I realize that the current activities of the Bush administration ring familiar, and then I make the connection; these are the events of the 1992 film &quot;A Few God Men&quot; starring Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson.
To summarize the film, Tom Cruise, Kevin Pollak and Demi Moore are Navy and Air Force attorneys assigned to the case of two Marines who are charged with inadvertently causing the death of a fellow Marine in a practice that is called a &quot;code red;&quot; a code red being an extracurricular disciplinary action levied upon a fellow who has fallen behind, causing difficulty or dishonor to the others in his platoon. In this case, a rag was stuffed in the Marine&apos;s mouth and covered with duct tape, which while meant only to scare the Marine into catching up with the rest of the platoon, to stop slacking, actually caused his death.
Code Reds do not exist in the handbook of military conduct of the Marines, it is a hazing, a discipline outside of the law, deemed necessary to keep the quality of the troops up to snuff by any means. It is also illegal, and therefore, unspoken to preserve it&apos;s effectiveness.
Currently, this storyline parallels what&apos;s happening in the Bush White House today. J.T. Walsh&apos;s Colonel Markinson, the subordinate to Jack Nicholson&apos;s Colonel Nathan Jessup, commits suicide rather than testify to Jessup&apos;s wrong-doings. Is it far-fetched to draw a line to the resignation of Secretary of State Colon Powell? Powell lied on the floor of the United Nations about WMD&apos;s, and calls it the biggest regret of his life.
How about Nicholson&apos;s tirade on the stand, when asked for the truth? &quot;You can&apos;t handle the truth!&quot; he wails, continuing with &quot;Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Whose gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinburg? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago, and you curse the marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That Santiago&apos;s death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And that my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don&apos;t want the truth because deep down in places you don&apos;t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. We use words like honor, code, loyalty. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way, Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and stand a post. Either way, I don&apos;t give a damn what you think you are entitled to.&quot;
Could this very well be the thinking, the rationale of a man like Bush, who had decided that his authority is preeminent, and above question, and that his end very well justifies his means? It&apos;s scary sometimes how life imitates art rather than the other way around.
Luckily, the film ends with Tom Cruise&apos;s Lt. Daniel Kaffee goading Jessup into admitting his breach of law on the stand. My question is, how can we get Bush, or Cheney, or Alberto Gonazales on the stand, Donald Rumsfeld, Karl Rove, Paul Wolfowitz, or any of the conductors of this heinous war to testify, and stoke their arrogance to the point when they will slip up and admit the horrible truths? That we do wiretap innocent Americans, that we torture captured enemy combatants, that we went to war with a predisposition to attack, and not to &quot;defend&quot; our nation, that the President knew about 9/11 before it happened, and God help us, may have orchestrated those events to usher us into the Middle East, that the current price of oil is a reward to the oil companies who contributed mightily to Republican campaign funding?
The level of corruption, lies and outright swindling of the American people has reached levels that make Richard Nixon look like Dwight Eisenhower. Where is our Tom Cruise, our Daniel Kaffee, who can look Bush in the eye and stare him down and make him admit to his grievous sins, for which the Christ to which he so ardently claims to worship will most certainly judge him with terrible wrath?

The Pretender (Jackson Browne)

Well, it&apos;s been exactly one year since I started blogging here on AOL (I cross-post on ComedySoapbox). In that time, I&apos;ve garnered 3400 page views. I&apos;m pretty impressed; in lieu of actually having a webpage (which I really have to get on the stick about), I&apos;ve received a lot of attention, which I guess is good when you&apos;re in showbizness.
I woke up early this morning, my wife was up late doing crafting, and when she came to bed, she woke me up, then the baby woke up, and I had to get the baby to go back to sleep by playing &quot;Baby Einstein&quot; DVDs over and over. It worked, and now everyone&apos;s sleeping but me. I leave for Toledo tomorrow, so it&apos;s actually good that I&apos;m up earlier than usual, I got some housework done, laundry and preparation for going away for four days. I also got Joel Pace from the Comedy Zone to answer an instant message, but so far, no bookings out of him. I work for them quite a bit, but I got canceled out of Jacksonville, Florida last year and never got the week replaced, and I want to go there. I was there once, and it&apos;s a nice town. Also, the manager of the Greensboro, North Carolina room likes my stuff and wants me to come there three or four times a year, so I&apos;m trying to get a return date. It&apos;s hard dealing with Comedy Zone because they&apos;re so busy all the time, you have to get them at exactly the right moment or you get told to call back about half a dozen times, and it can get to be demoralizing. Still, I&apos;ve never had any problems getting what I needed from them once I got through, so I guess it&apos;s worth the effort.
I&apos;m an avid Air America listener, and I just found out that WKBW in Buffalo picked them up....I always have a problem when I&apos;m leaving town because the WROC signal here in Rochester fades as I head west, and then there are no Air America stations for quite a distance....just another case for picking up sattelite radio, but until then, at least I have &quot;terrestrial&quot; options.
We got a bunch of snow here in Rochester yesteday, and it seemed to have all fallen in less than an hour. They&apos;re calling it an inch of snow, but I hate that measurement system....it&apos;s predicated on melting the snow! I want to know the actual depth of the snow, which in this case, is a few inches...it&apos;s that light, puffy &quot;Christmas&quot; snow that&apos;s easy to shovel and just makes everything slippery....a slight nuisance, really, unless you&apos;re an out-of-towner who doesn&apos;t know how to drive in snow.
I made some dynamite crab salad yesterday....I used that imitation crab....until yesterday, I didn&apos;t realize how &quot;imitation&quot; that stuff is....it contains less than 2% crab! It&apos;s flounder with red paint! Still, the salad was good.....I found out that the ingredient I&apos;d been missing all this time was &quot;Old Bay&quot; seasoning, which is predominantly celery salt and cayenne pepper. Still, it was great, and with some wheat mini-pitas, it made a really nice dinner. I washed it down with diet ginger-ale, and then enjoyed an evening of doing nothing, and taking all night to do it.
O.K., I&apos;m tired now. Maybe I&apos;ll append this journal entry if anything exciting happens later, so keep checking back. And thanks for reading!

 Philadelphia Freedom (Elton John) 
Posted on 02/05/2006 at 12:51 AM
Well, I wrapped up another Saturday night with two great shows, courtesy of my co-stars, Maria Walsh of NYC and headliner Buddy Fitzpatrick from the great state of New Jersey. We really complimented each other, and I think the shows were some of the best I&apos;ve been a part of in a long time.
Last night&apos;s one show was excellent...I sold quite a few copies of my CD and DVD, and tonight&apos;s sales really paled by comparison, but I made enough money to underwrite the gas it took to get me here and home, and didn&apos;t have to dig too deeply into the profit to eat, so that makes it a successful weekend, as far as I&apos;m concerned.
I went out today for lunch, and there are two shopping malls directly across the street from the hotel. One of the malls has an Old Country Buffet (a personal favorite of mine), but it literally was a 35-minute wait to get inside and get a table. There was a line! I never saw such a thing. It was piss-raining, too, which made getting around a little tough. Here in eastern Pennsylvania, you can&apos;t make a left turn *ever.* They have these &quot;jug handle&quot; exits where you go off a ramp to the right, and it swings you around in a perpendicular angle to the road you were just on. It ok once you get used to it, but when you miss a jug handle, it&apos;s a bitch because you have to drive all the way up to the next one. I hate that.
I&apos;m getting ready for the big 5-hour ride home, and I&apos;m not excited about it, but it has to be done, and better later than sooner. It&apos;s almost 1 AM, so I&apos;ll be rolling back into Rock-Town around 6 AM. I&apos;ll sleep, and maybe later in the day, I&apos;ll watch the Super Bowl, but to be honest, I&apos;m not too jazzed about the matchup. Everyone down here in Philadelphia Eagles territory are actually pulling for the Steelers, which I think is gay. If anything, pull for the Seahawks, because you don&apos;t want to throw bragging rights to the other side of the state...I was driving through Philly a few years ago, and the Eagles were kicking the Steelers ass, and the Philly faithful were loving every minute of it. There wasn&apos;t a car on the street, everyone was either in the stadium or at home watching the game on TV. Don&apos;t give up on that spirit now! If the New York Jets or Giants were in the Super Bowl, I&apos;d root for whomever was playing them....I&apos;m a Buffalo fan, so screw the other two teams in New York State. As a matter of fact, the Giants don&apos;t even play in New York, they play in New Jersey, so let their team plane go down in a fireball and cook marshmallows on the embers.
Capish?

 Allentown (Billy Joel) 
Posted on 02/03/2006 at 03:19 PM
I&apos;m in Allentown, PA, at the Ramada Inn (actually, this is the town of Whitehall), home of the Allentown Wisecracker&apos;s comedy club. I came in last night about 2 A.M., and did the radio station promotion this morning with Bearman and Keith on WZZO. They were amicable guys who basically let me come in and shanghai the whole show. I badgered every caller, questioned every guest, and somehow took over every discussion with my personal opinion. They loved it! Hopefully, my wit will draw some folks out to the club tonight &apos;n&apos; tomorrow.
One of the best callers was a guy who chimed in about a local case of a student who was being censured because he refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance at his school. The caller took the position that &quot;...if he was my kid, I would have kicked his butt, slapped his head and put him on a mule out of town.&quot; Bearman and I jumped on him like a Baptist on a sparerib at a church picnic...I told him that our soldiers who fought and died for our freedoms (his words) fought for the freedom to dissent, and as long as the kid sat quietly and wasn&apos;t disruptive during the Pledge, he was totally in line. Keith was right on time with the patriotic music in the background, and this guy spun a 180 like the Dukes of Hazzard at a police roadblock. It was fun to take some self-important bastard and rip him to ribbons for being wrong, instead of being that guy for a change.
The show&apos;s at 9:00 tonight, so I have a few hours to kill. I&apos;m going to try and hit the post office, do a little mall-walking and have a nice dinner. I&apos;m probably not going to go to the movies, although there&apos;s a theater right across the street. Movies suck today, and that prompted me to go to the American Film Institute and look up their Top 100 films of the 20th century (yeah, I&apos;ve got that kind of time) and I ranked them chronologically (yeah, I&apos;ve got that kind of time, too) to see how many of them I&apos;ve actually seen.

71. FORREST GUMP (1994)
95. PULP FICTION (1994)
84. FARGO (1996)
By my count, I&apos;ve seen 48 of them, several of them courtesy of a film appreciation class I took in college (seriously, who goes to Blockbuster and asks them if they have &quot;Birth of a Nation?&quot; And what Blockbuster carries it?)
By contrast, though, just flipping through the HBO schedule for last month (way to go with the update, Ramada), today&apos;s movies are schlock and dross....&quot;Million Dollar Baby?&quot; &quot;Love, Actually?&quot; (God, deliver me from Hugh Grant) &quot;Ocean&apos;s Twelve,&quot; &quot;Miss Congenialtiy 2-Armed and Fabulous?&quot;
Hollywood today doesn&apos;t have the creative talent to produce a &quot;Rear Window,&quot; much less an &quot;Unforgiven&quot; or a &quot;Fargo.&quot; Instead, we have &quot;Big Momma&apos;s House 2.&quot; Even the most recent comedy on the list, &quot;Tootsie,&quot; was made 24 years ago, in 1982. So basically, there hasn&apos;t been a remarkable comedy movie since then, speaks the American Film Institute. And do they have a case? What could your rebuttal be if you chose to disagree? &quot;Ghostbusters?&quot; &quot;Ace Ventura Pet Detective?&quot;
Maybe I&apos;ll just read a book.

 Liar (Rollins Band) 
Posted on 01/31/2006 at 01:35 AM
Weekend recap for Wisecrackers, Scranton, PA.
When last you checked in with me, gentle reader, I was rather sick and had just piloted my way across Pennsylvania (west to east...the hard way). Saturday&apos;s shows with host John Ager and headliner Jimmy Graham were a mixed bag of the hard knocks of the comedy business...first show was a dream, second show was a nightmare.
During the first show, we had a contingent of the &quot;Red Hat&quot; society in attendance...I&apos;ve experienced these groups before, and they are a lot of fun. I played around with them, and one of the ladies even bought my DVD after the show. I was doubting sincerely that she even had a DVD player, and then she said &quot;This will play on my computer, won&apos;t it?&quot; She totally blew my stereotype. I guess I had it coming...I&apos;ve done the same thing to people in the past, looking like a heavy-metal meat-head, and then showing off my literacy.
Second show, it was the &quot;cut &apos;n&apos; run&quot; laughers who came out in droves. After the show, Ann, the club manager, said at one point it looked like I fell off my bicycle. I told her I not only fell off my bicycle, I ditched it in a gravel driveway and skinned both knees. Damn, it was terrible! Actually, I was getting laughs, but they were so stilted, I never got a rhythm going. During the headliner&apos;s set, I went to my room, packed my suitcases and headed to the car...I had a four-hour drive home, and I wanted to start as quickly as possible.
The ride home was uneventful...I stopped for a few bathroom breaks, once for fuel, and still made it home in 3 1/2...that&apos;s a warrior&apos;s spirit, right there. I&apos;d had three days of intestinal flu, and all I wanted was the comfort of home. I even took the time to bullshit with the night crew at Burger King....I asked them if anyone really ever ordered the Triple Whopper. The stock answer, apparently, is no. You can&apos;t order that burger, anyway....you&apos;d have to be able to unhinge your jaw like a python just to take a bit of the damn thing.
Sunday was a day of complete rest...I don&apos;t think I got out of bed, except maybe twice...I was a spent cartridge, tired in body and mind. I get sick about twice a year, and I&apos;m for crap for the duration of the illness.
Today, Pam, Harmony and I tried to get back into the routine with a trip to the post office, the bank and a few shopping stops, and somewhere along the line, Harmony got sick. She might have gotten the bug from me, or possible one of the rhotaviruses that are going around, but she can&apos;t keep any fluids down and started vomiting in the checkout line of the supermarket (sorry, Stoneridge Wegman&apos;s). The last time she had this, we weren&apos;t out of the woods for about 7 to 10 days. I hope that an older, stronger baby will shuck this disease quicker...it stands to be a pisser if she doesn&apos;t.
I don&apos;t leave again for tour until Thursday night...I got the call to do morning radio on Friday (not sure why the headliner isn&apos;t available, but I said I&apos;d do it) so if you&apos;re in the Allentown, PA area around 7:00 Friday morning, tune in to WZZO and maybe you&apos;ll hear me. I sincerely hope that Harmony&apos;s feeling better, because I&apos;ll feel pretty guilty leaving Pam with a sick baby to care for all by herself.
Well, tomorrow&apos;s the big State of the Union address, and I&apos;m eager to listen to the address live and really soak it in instead of reading it the next morning and depending on the cable news soundbites to get the feel of the thing. I&apos;ve been deeply interested in politics lately, and I want to get more in tune with what&apos;s happening on the national stage. Maybe I&apos;ll share some of my insights in the next blog....actually, try and stop me.
Suggested reading this month: I picked up a copy of &quot;Big Lies&quot; by Joe Conason. Joe is a national correspondent for the New York Observer, and writes a daily on-line journal in Salon. His book is quite an eye-opener on the positioning of politics and policy in Washington, and shows (with significant proof) that a lot of the things we hear are only half-truths, if they contain any truth at all. It&apos;s a good book that moves well, and I enjoyed it. One note; there are so many sources to be credited in the back of the book, you think you have a few chapters left when the book actually ends.
The baby&apos;s sleeping now, and soon, mommy and I will be, too. Thanks for reading, and drop a line if you wish....I think it would be cool to share around some &quot;reader mail.&quot; Write at YuksOnMe@aol.com. You can ask questions, make comments, or share your lists with me. I have a movie list that I&apos;ll be posting later this week...I think you&apos;ll be amazed how much (or how little) you know about American cinema.
Sleep tight, readers.

 Sick As A Dog (Aerosmith) 
Posted on 01/28/2006 at 12:40 AM
Scranton, Pennsylvania. Well, I&apos;m finally here. Of course, I feel so crappy, they should draw a chalk outline around me.
Wednesday, the day before I hit the road, I had flu-like symptoms that included &quot;losing it&quot; from both ends. It cleared up in time for me to hit the road and work the show in Ohio on Thursday night, but apparently, I wasn&apos;t out of the woods.
I woke up at 5:30 A.M., and couldn&apos;t stop &quot;Ralphing.&quot; I had a seven-hour drive in front of me, and I needed to get myself together quick. After I had pretty much eliminated everything in my system (and left housekeeping a nice tip for their troubles), I grabbed some Diet 7-Up (no ginger ale to be had in Ohio, I guess) and hit the road. I was afraid to eat anything, so all I had all day was Pepto-Bismol, water, and Diet 7-Up. Not a good combination for a person who leans toward hypoglycemia. The last couple hundred miles, I felt sleepy and woozy, and at one point, I caught myself racing down route 80 in Pennsylvania going 100 miles per hour. I didn&apos;t even know my car could go that fast...it was impressive.
I got to the hotel in time to have a nice two-hour nap (only got the four hours of sleep, so it was completely necessary), and had a nice shower and was right on time for the 9:00 P.M. show with Jimmy Graham and John Agers. I&apos;ve worked with both of these guys before, and we had a lot of fun. Scranton&apos;s own Brad Cox dropped in and did a guest spot, and we talked comedy after my show.
I was tired, but got through my show pretty well. They gave me a nice salad to take back to the room, and so far, it&apos;s stayed down, but my fingers are still crossed. Maybe after a good night&apos;s sleep, I&apos;ll feel better. There&apos;s two shows tomorrow (or tonight, however you look at it), and then I&apos;ll probably drive home...it&apos;s only four hours back to Rochester and the weather&apos;s mild, so I&apos;ll take advantage of it.
Have a good day!

 All Apologies (Nirvana) 
Posted on 01/27/2006 at 12:28 AM
Good evening from East-Central Ohio, where I worked with Bert &quot;Chili&quot; Challis at the Canal House in Tuscarawas, Ohio. There&apos;s no hotels in Tuscarawas, so we&apos;re staying in nearby Urichsville. We are a short hop, skip and a jump from the Clark Gable birthplace, and I&apos;d stop tomorrow on the way to Scranton, but frankly my dear, I don&apos;t give a damn.
It was a good show and the folks at the Canal House treated us well, tossing us extra cash for gas. It was a class gesture, and I believe one that bears acknowledgement. Also, I was offered a little dinner on the house, so I decided to try the award-winning barbecued ribs. I&apos;m not going to tell you that they were good, I&apos;m just going to let the facts speak for themselves...I got rib sauce in my hair. Yeah, they were that good.
This morning when I left Rochester, it was 15 degrees out, with a wind chill of 8. That&apos;s butt-ass cold, I don&apos;t care who you are or where you come from. I made good time getting down here to Ohio, where it&apos;s still cold, and I&apos;m pretty exhausted. Cold weather really whups on me sometimes...I&apos;m at the age where it&apos;s starting to get into my bones. I&apos;m ready to really get into some world-class sleep.
But before I sign off, I have to offer up a public apology.
Back in September, Steve Burr and I happened to be staying at the Funny Bone condo in South Bend, Indiana. While Steve was out, I looked in his engagement book that was laying on the coffee table.
This was a heinous invasion of Steve&apos;s privacy and was unforgiveable, and I apologize to Steve in this public forum. I was completely out of line.
I could sit here and tell you that my motives were harmless, but that doesn&apos;t matter. I invited myself where I wasn&apos;t welcome, and it was wrong. Steve and I have been buddies for a long time, but that didn&apos;t give me the right to do what I did.
Steve, buddy, I&apos;m totally sorry.
I will accept my lumps like a man. Go ahead and let me have it, people.

 Got The Time (Joe Jackson) 
Posted on 01/25/2006 at 02:21 AM
There&apos;s an old Yiddish proverb; Man plans, God laughs. Or to make a perfectly short line even longer (my stock in trade), Life is what happens while you&apos;re making other plans.
I can&apos;t believe that January, the month I&apos;d been dreading, is almost in the bag. I had big dreams about what I was going to accomplish with 2006, and I hit the ground running, but all I did was stand still.
I still have to get RalphTetta.com up and running. So far, I&apos;ve done nothing to make it happen, and getting that website was my New Year&apos;s resolution last year....how bad is that? Also, I&apos;ve come to a standstill as far as getting new clubs on board, which begs the question...if my entire schedule is full all the time, should I even be worried about adding new clubs? I mean, I could always solicit better work, but when I started this road thing, the trick was making sure that I worked every week (can&apos;t support a family without a weekly income, I say). So if I&apos;m working every week, and paying my modest bills, how intent should I be on getting into new clubs? Road work is road work, and is it really worth getting bent out of shape that I can&apos;t get (insert club here) to return my phone calls or even acknowledge that they received my DVD and promo pack? I&apos;m going to say &quot;no&quot; here, although I can&apos;t help but feel differently about it.
I&apos;ve got about three other projects I want to pursue, but where&apos;s the time? I&apos;ve gotten greedy about spending time with my wife and daughter, to the detriment of my career. Not that everything isn&apos;t going fine, but I constantly hear that clock ticking. It&apos;s not a real clock, either, just one that I&apos;ve set for myself. I keep feeling older than I really am, like at some point I&apos;m no longer going to be welcome on a comedy club stage because of my age...which is ridiculous, because every week I work with someone older than myself. I need to shake it off and get into some sort of a routine. Maybe that should be my New Year&apos;s resolution for 2006. Set some simple goals and stick to them. I know I post a lot of journal entries, but they&apos;re all done in the middle of the night, when there&apos;s not a lot of business going on. Maybe I&apos;m sleeping the wrong hours. Ah, hell.
Nothing to report other than a couple of nice days together with the family, running errands and visiting older relatives and friends on the mend. We did lunch over at Pam&apos;s grandmother&apos;s house, and went to go see our friend Crystal who is home convalescing after surgery. Harmony turned out to be a little ray of sunshine in both instances...she&apos;s got bags of charisma, and she&apos;s not even speaking conversationally yet.
Yesterday I went to pay my insurance bill ($104, in case you&apos;re interested, Steve...I have no secrets) at State Farm, and the receptionist got a little lippy with me. I don&apos;t respond well to that sort of thing.
Her: Can I help you?
Me: (smiling) Yes, hello! I&apos;m here to pay my monthly.
Her: Do you have your bill?
Me: (still smiling) No, I don&apos;t. I pay in person every month, so I usually just stop in on my day off.
Her: (frowning) Well, they want the bill, so you&apos;d better start bringing it from now on.
Me: (paying the cash) Well, if they want the bill, then just keep it here instead of mailing it to me. I always pay in person, so then it would be here when I come in.
Her: (getting tired of my seemless logic) Sure, we&apos;ll just keep everyone&apos;s bill here on file for them.
Me: (still smiling) No, I mean just *my* bill. I pay in person, I&apos;m sure everyone else mails theirs in, or pays on the internet. I have no problem asking for special treatment.
Her: (thinking I&apos;m joking and lightening up) I&apos;ll run it by my supervisor and see what they say.
Me: (still smiling) Thank you for your help today! I&apos;ll see you again in a month!
If your job sucks so bad that you don&apos;t realize you&apos;re making a customer angry or uncomfortable, which I was, hence the sarcasm (veiled as innocence and naivette), then you need to get another job. And while I realize that being a receptionist in an insurance company&apos;s branch office probably doesn&apos;t live up to the glamour you&apos;d expect, you still have to do the dance when the paying clientele come in.
I&apos;d lodge a complaint with my agent, but who has the time?

 Working Man (Rush) 
Posted on 01/23/2006 at 04:55 AM
The muscles in my back and legs are screaming!
Wrap-up on the weekend...got a little treat in the form of one Tom Anzalone, the worst guitar act ever, who hosted for Jim Dailakis and myself at the Syracuse location of the Lake Ontario Playhouse. Tom is actually a great singer and guitarist, and I hadn&apos;t seen him since his last appearance at the Comix Cafe in Rochester when I was runnin&apos; the joint. Tom&apos;s been doing children&apos;s entertaining and was recently showcased on National Public Radio...do a Google search for &quot;Mr. Songflower&quot; and you can read all about him.
First show was a delight...the room was almost packed, better than Friday night, and the show went well. Second show, there was a weird energy, capped off by the third consecutive show where nobody was sitting at the front center table. I freaked out a little bit and started riffing wildly, leaving the stage, standing on chairs, going to the back of the room, ditching the microphone and just talking to the audience to get back into a rhythm. Come to find out, the table was extremely wobbly, and no one wanted to sit there...it&apos;s bad enough when you have to pull the old restaurant scam of throwing a batch of napkins under one leg to get it straight, but this thing was ready for the woodpile. A guest named Doris set me straight on what the problem was, as she was offered the table when she and her date were seated, and after seeing how bad the table was, declined. Doris works for Hunt Real Estate, and my shameless plug goes out to her...if you have real estate needs in the Syracuse area, look her up Her number is 315-637-5700, ext. 9329.
On the way home, I ran into Comix Cafe owner J.J. Parrone at a rest-stop on the New York State Thruway. He was coming back from a night&apos;s recreation at the Turning Stone Casino (no word on how he did, but he was smiling and buying food....and that could very well have been the reason for the smile). We had a nice chat, and then parted ways when he hit the road, and I stuck around to savor the flavor of $2.56 a gallon unleaded. I guess the supplies are short again, or that impeachment talk that brought prices down a few months ago has cooled off. All I know is that nationally, temperatures have been warm and mild, which should bring usage of heating oil down, which should send prices down as well, assuming that supply stays constant. I guess the rules of supply and demand don&apos;t count when you&apos;re dealing with the oil business. Go figure.
So Sunday morning, I rolled out of the rack around 11:30 after a nice 7-hour&apos;s sleep, and my wife decided that today would be a good day for me to put in the new kitchen floor. I picked up the materials weeks ago, and was waiting for a good day to install it, and today was as good as any. It was a nice diversion from having to see the lousy Pittsburgh Steelers and their granite-jawed asshole of a coach advance to the big game. I watched clips of the Steeler&apos;s victory later in the day when I took a break, and my biggest thrill was watching them dump the ice bucket on Bill Cowher at the end of the game, and imagining that the thing was filled with my uirine. You get your happiness where you can, I say.
The work of putting in a kitchen floor is basically pretty easy. My task was a little more difficult due to the age of the house we live in and the condition of the old flooring. I had to take up the rug in sections (yeah, we had a rug in our kitchen...not a shag or anything, although it would have hid the crumbs better), then pry up the old tile with a trowel, then sweep and clean the surface, and lay down the new tile. I used the peel &apos;n&apos; stick kind, so the going was pretty quick, and I was slowed only by having to cut around fixtures, and then realizing I needed another box of tiles around 4 hours in. The trip back to Big Lots was a nice break, and I picked up a little Chinese food for Pam, Harmony and myself. After a little chicken fried rice, it was back on my knees to do the final portion of the floor, the section under the refrigerator. Well, I&apos;m no Bob Vila, or even Norm Abrams, but by 9:30, the kitchen looked great and every muscle in my back, arms and legs was throbbing. At 39 years of age and easily 140 pounds over my ideal weight, an undertaking of this order is just beyond my physical reach. I slept a few hours, but woke up to take another pain pill and decided to catch up on my journal. I plan on sleeping well tomorrow, and then getting back on the phones to start booking May, June and July (February, March and April are full).
I hurt, but I have to admit that doing a job like that makes me feel alive. I don&apos;t have a lot of know-how, so when I can do a project like this, I feel really accomplished.
Have a great week!

Liberals Laugh Louder!
Did a show in Syracuse, NY with one V.J. Stanley in tow. V.J. was guest-spotting for Mike Kinnie, the owner/booker of the Lake Ontario Playhouse in Sackett&apos;s Harbor, NY, as well as Geneva, NY, Syracuse, NY and Troy, NY.
V.J. did a great job in the opener spot, nailing a 5-to-7 minute set in just about 6 and a half. His closing bit got an applause break....can&apos;t get better than that, huh?
When I arrived, Mike asked me to omit a piece of material. It&apos;s a bit about analingus. O.K., no problem. He said &quot;Don&apos;t do that bit tonight. As a matter of fact, don&apos;t do it in any of my rooms.&quot;
I was a little surprised. Mike has always said that he likes my act, and I&apos;ve never had a problem getting booked in any of his locations. Point, I was the opening weekend of his Geneva room. That&apos;s a measure of trust, as far as I&apos;m concerned.
Now, I haven&apos;t done the bit in about six weeks. I didn&apos;t consciously drop it, but there&apos;s certain markets where you just know that graphic sexual material isn&apos;t going to please the audience....the South, the Midwest, etc. I ditched it (didn&apos;t really need the bit), but felt kind of weird about it. I like to go that route if the audience really looks like they&apos;ve let their guard down and are willing to play. In really liberal towns like Madison, Wisconsin, I&apos;ve actually gotten really favorable feedback about the piece, because I walk the audience all the way around the bit, rather than slamming them over the head with it. It&apos;s really a tasteful presentation, if I can be trusted to be objective about my own act.
We cleared out after my set and drove back to Rochester, where I picked up comedy buddy Ray Salah and headed over to the Little Theater to do warm-up for a midnight screening of the film &quot;The Aristrocrats.&quot; The set went well, even though I had to do the old &quot;draw the numbers from the hat&quot; bit to give away copies of the DVD. I got the crowd to do some audience participation in reciting the swear words as a group, starting out with &quot;damn it all&quot; and graduating up the the big &quot;C&quot; word. It was a fun time, and I took advantage of knowing that the crowd was full of Granola types, so I bashed conservatives and their willingness to piss away freedom of speech and expression. When I left the stage, the audience was eating out of my hand. Except for the big bull dykes that were sitting far away from the rest of the crowd who I mocked and said they were quarantined like they had SARS. Thank God they won a DVD or they probably would have kicked my ass.
Two shows in two cities in one night...I know that&apos;s not a record or anything, but I always over-romanticize stuff like that. It was only a 90-mile ride on the New York State Thruway, but in my mind, I&apos;m Phil Collins playing Live Aid in London, and then taking a Concorde to Philadelphia to play a set at the other one.
Fuck you, it&apos;s my story and I&apos;ll tell it like I want to. Using whatever language I see fit.

Owning a lot of underwear is a license not to do laundry that often. Theoretically, if you owned 122 pairs, you&apos;d only have to do laundry three times a year.
Regardless, I&apos;ve been a laundry-doing machine these last few days, to the detriment of the growing stack of dishes in the sink. The downside of being home is that I get complacent about housekeeping...I&apos;m not working until Friday night, and the gig&apos;s only an hour and a half away in Syracuse, so there&apos;s *plenty* of time to get the simple household chores done.
Today was promo day...I mailed out headshots and updated bios to the major bookers that I get most of my comedy work from. It&apos;s good to keep them updated, and make sure they have plenty of headshots, although sometimes I think they don&apos;t necessarily send them out to the clubs I&apos;m performing at...I&apos;m beginning to think that some of them are just rolling my promo and using them as cheap fireplace logs. Heating oil *is* expensive, you know....
At the post office today, I got a gasp from one of the clerks...I was trying to fish out exact change from the pile of coins in my pocket, and I vapor locked...I literally looked at the money in my hand and didn&apos;t know how much I had. When I recovered, I told the clerk that I flaked, and I felt like that one guy they fished out of the mine in West Virginia. She laughed and gasped at the same time, that uptight laugh that says &quot;I find that funny, but I can&apos;t really laugh or you&apos;ll think that I&apos;m as bad as you are.&quot; Why don&apos;t people lighten up? I swear to God, some people walk around with sphincters so tight you couldn&apos;t get a toothpick up there with a jackhammer. What&apos;s the benefit to living a joyless life? If I wanted to me a monotonous drone, I&apos;d go work at the United States Post Office. Or become Lutheran.....
I was at the Post Office today mailing out my promo, but also mailing out a few packages. I make a little side living selling books and CDs on the internet on a website called www.half.com. It&apos;s an arm of eBay, and instead of bidding on product, you just list the stuff, and the people whowant it buy it, pay for the shipping, and after half.com takes their commission, they direct deposit the funds into your checking account.
Well, last week in Michigan, Dobie Maxwell and I walked around the mall in Battle Creek (Mid Rivers Mall?) and I went into an FYE store, and they had clearance CDs for a quarter each. Twenty-five cents. Four for a buck. Yeah, the titles were a little sketchy, but that&apos;s the beauty of it....folks who want those out-of-the-mainstream titles are willing to pay a good dollar for them, because you can&apos;t just waltz into a store and find them. The pride of the treasure trove was a solo disc from ex-Guns &apos;n&apos; Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin that I listed for $14. The sale of that disc will easily pay for the princely $5 I dropped. The biggest turkey of the batch was Morton Downey, Jr. sings. Morton Downey Jr. was a talk-show host, sort of a gonzo precursor to Bill O&apos;Reilly. Morton was an asshole, and he would pick a fight with anyone, from Christian ministers to Nazi skinheads. He seemed to hate everyone. Well, his CD collection of standards isn&apos;t even listed in the catalogue, and I bought two copies, so I can&apos;t even offer them for sale. If you&apos;re interested in buying one, send me a dollar and I&apos;ll make sure it gets to you in time for Valentine&apos;s Day.
I cross-post this journal on AOL and on www.comedysoapbox.com. I have no idea who&apos;s reading me, but AOL gets about 40 or 50 hits between entries, and the comedy soapbox site seems to be getting ten times that amount. I enjoy reading the blogs on comedy soapbox, but it doesn&apos;t seem like there&apos;s very many comics that aren&apos;t operating outside of NYC or Los Angeles except me. And I really don&apos;t get the vibe that any of the comics are making a full-time living at comedy, except for a very few. I took a call from a fellow comic from the Boston area today, and we talked comedy for about half an hour. I&apos;m no elder statesman, but I&apos;ve been doing the comedy thing since 1988, and the cat was just starting out, so I was happy to share some anecdotes and pointers. He&apos;s doing his first paying gig this weekend, and I hope it&apos;s a smashing success.
Finally, I found out that NBC is bringing back &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; this summer, and I&apos;m excited about it. I didn&apos;t get involved in the audition process until late in the game in the second season, when they pretty much had casted the show and there wasn&apos;t a chance to get in. I eagerly awaited the third season, and then they did that &quot;first season-second season&quot; playoff format that sucked so bad it got the show canceled. I&apos;m definitely going to try to get involved with the new season if there&apos;s any way possible. I think I would be good on the program, especially the weekly tests; I have an improv background and I think well on my feet. And it would be a great shot in the arm for my comedy career.
If it happens, it happens, and if it doesn&apos;t, it doesn&apos;t. I&apos;ll still be doing what I&apos;m doing, which is what I love, if I don&apos;t get on, but if I do, wow. Hey, there&apos;s always hope.

 The Future&apos;s So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades (Timbuk 3) 
Posted on 01/16/2006 at 05:15 PM
Happy Martin Luther King, Jr. Day! I have a dream, too....
What a weekend! Finished off Saturday night with two shows starring headliner Dobie Maxwell. Dobie got a little pissed off at some of the hecklers at the late show, and I think he told a guy he was going to dig up the guy&apos;s dead mother, shave her cunt and fuck her in the ass...I&apos;m not sure, I was out in the bar watching the Patriots crumble and join the ash-heap of destiny when it happened.
I finished out the weekend with above-average merchandise sales, and had two very good shows, so I was happy. I made the 7-hour drive home from Battle Creek, going mostly through Canada, and absolutely died a living death listening to the Colts-Steelers game. Nothing against the Steelers, other than I hate them, but I really was pulling for Peyton Manning. I think I was getting jazzed up about the roller-coaster nature of the game, because I caught myself (more than once) going about 95 miles per hour...that&apos;s a number in kilometers per hour that I can&apos;t even calculate. It makes me sick to death to see the Colts&apos; season end this way, after Coach Dungy&apos;s tragic loss of his son, and it also makes me sick to see a good guy like Manning take it in the neck another year. Maybe it&apos;s because I saw the same thing happen to my beloved Buffalo Bills, year after year. And Jim Kelly is nowhere near as nice a guy as Manning.
I got a neat little gig lined up this weekend...I&apos;m hosting a screening of &quot;The Aristrocrats&quot; at the Little Theater on Friday night. They&apos;re showing the film to coincide with the DVD release of the movie. I haven&apos;t seen the film, but I know the gist of it; it&apos;s the dirtiest joke ever. I&apos;m looking forward to seeing it, although I don&apos;t particularly care for the joke and couldn&apos;t deliver it with the zest it requires. I have some ideas on how to properly warm up the audience without telling the joke, and I should have some fun with it. I&apos;m working in Syracuse this weekend, so I was planning on driving back anyhow.
My good friend Mike Dambra got a showcase wraparound week at the Cleveland Improv this past week, and it went very well by his account. They are going to headline him, and hopefully this will get him on track towards the career a guy of his talent deserves. He&apos;s been a good mentor to me, and I&apos;m glad to see him get his due.
I had a productive day on the phones today, and lined up a few weeks of work, filling in my calendar until the end of April, less one week. I should be able to get that puppy filled in pretty quickly, and then it&apos;s off to the races to get summer filled in. With any luck, I&apos;ll be able to route some things down towards Florida so I can go see my father. Things are rolling along quite nicely, and if this keeps up much longer, I&apos;m going to think I&apos;m in a different dimension or something.
Last but not least, my wife&apos;s grandmother, Doma Ciuffini, turns 92 today. She&apos;s a great lady with a passel o&apos; children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. But out of all her descendants, she likes Pamela and Harmony the best, which shows she has impeccable taste.
Hope everything is going well where you are.

 Crash (Dave Matthews Band) 
Posted on 01/14/2006 at 11:27 AM
Dobie Maxwell almost killed my wife!
Two shows went off last night at Gary Field&apos;s Comedy Theater in Battle Creek, Michigan. The first show was an uneven, stilted affair, populated by folks who couldn&apos;t afford to see Mad TV&apos;s Aries Spears in Kalamazoo. And that was the good show.
Friday the 13th was in full effect for the second show, as every biker redneck moron that Battle Creek could shake out showed up and literally interrupted every punchline I could try to spit out. I tried to close my show 15 or 16 times and then just gave up. It was terrible. Two nice girls walked out. The club tried to quiet people down, but it was like a tire fire...one guy would shut up, and then another guy would errupt into distracting conversation. It was a nightmare.
Dobie fared much better in the closing spot, because he refused to engage anyone in conversation for very long, and his style is much more rat-a-tat-tat than mine, and I&apos;m pretty rat-a-tat-tat, but hecklers would always manage to jump right in just before a punchline. At the end of the night, Dobie didn&apos;t even want to set up the merchandise table, he just wanted to retreat back to the hotel. I convinced him to stay, and a nice couple came up and bought a couple of CD&apos;s. Mission accomplished, we beat feat for the McCamley Plaza Hotel.
I&apos;ve known Dobie for years, and two Christmases ago, we worked together in Mauston, Wisconsin, a tiny burg north of Madison that is home to about 4,000 people, although in the course of the weekend, we only got to meet about 50 of them. Dobie is from Milwaukee, so he had plans to visit family on the Saturday, leaving me to my own company in a town that was little more than support for a truck stop. In an attempt to get some exercise, I drove 20 miles to the nearest retail center, a Wal-Mart in the Wisconsin Dells. I preferred a mall, but there wasn&apos;t one until Madison, and that was much to far to drive. I suffered a mild panic attic in the store when I saw all the families and Christmas decorations and heard the Christmas music playing, and was missing my wife and daughter, then only 9 months old. I got out of the store after spending only about 15 minutes walking around, and then drove back to the hotel where I laid in bed looking at pictures of my family and feeling consumed by melancholy. The next day, it was so cold that my car wouldn&apos;t start, and I had to call AAA for a jump because conventional autos weren&apos;t strong enough to give me the juice I needed. I drove home hot for much of the 15 hour ride, because I didn&apos;t want to take a chance that the car wouldn&apos;t start again. That weekend was one of the lowest points of my comedy career, and I didn&apos;t make it any better by spending the day off (Thursday) hiding in the hotel and drinking Jim Beam which I had packed for the occasion, not knowing how much I&apos;d appreciate it until later.
Dobie was the feature act at the Comix Cafe for Don Reese the day my wife and her mother got into a really bad car accident. I had just started working at the club in management, and it was a Thursday, and I was in the club early, around 11:00 A.M., when I got a call from Don. He was at Park Ridge hospital, where he went to have a lump in his leg checked out. Come to find out, it was a blood clot, caused by the blood thinners he was taking for another condition, and the long drive from Iowa had exacerbated his condition, causing the clot. The doctors at Park Ridge refused to release him on accounts of they insisted on keeping him under observation, lest the clot move up his leg towards his heart and kill him. He called to let us know he wouldn&apos;t be able to make the show, and I made the decision to move Dobie up to close, and I would fill in the feature spot.
That night, Dobie, myself and club owner Ed Bebko were standing around, and I was called to the phone. My wife and her mother were hit head-on as they were driving home, and they were at Strong Hospital. The person from the emergency room said they were fine, but that I should get there as quickly as possible. Dobie and Ed told me that I shouldn&apos;t worry, that they wereprobably in a fender-bender, and they were convinced to take the ambulance ride to the hospital to get checked out, just in case. &quot;Ambulance drivers always try to drum up the business&quot; they insisted. I settled down, and did the fastest, tightest, best 30-minute show of my life. I ran out the back door to my Dodge Colt, and brushed the snow off with a swipe of my arm, and hauled ass tothe hospital.
What I found when I arrived was more like a M*A*S*H* unit. My mother-in-law-to-be had suffered a crushed ankle, fractured wrist, and injuries to the face. My wife (at the time, fiance&apos;), had suffered deep bruises to the breast, a broken rib that wasn&apos;t diagnosed until much later, and both of them were in severe pain. I stayed with them until 6 A.M., when they were released! and sent home. I managed them into the tiny Colt, which was barely comfortable for one person, let alone three with two injured and not moving well.
I took the rest of the week off. The club didn&apos;t have a problem with that.
Don got better and finished the week off. He was booked to headline again, and got bumped to wrap-around for Tommy Chong and his hideous wife, Shelby.
Dobie returned to the club and eventually headlined in his own right.
Mama Davis healed up, but still feels the pain in her bones when it gets cold.
Pamela spent six months on the couch recovering from the broken rib they didn&apos;t see the first time they X-rayed, and still harbors ill feelings towards the driver of the other car who crossed the double yellow line and hit her and her mother, but was never breathalyzed even though he had just left a bar, and admitted to &quot;drinking something&quot; and his passenger was completely inebriated.
Neither the driver nor his passenger suffered any injuries, and were questioned at the scene and released.
I went back to work the following Wednesday, and did days doing laundry, cooking meals, doing personal care and whatever else I needed to do. I worked evenings, and at night, I slept dead, dreamless sleep.
The next time someone tells me an ambulance took a loved one to the hospital, I&apos;m just going to go right away.

 Heavy Metal Maniac (Exciter) 
Posted on 01/13/2006 at 07:38 AM
New York State drinking laws turned me into a standup comic.
I&apos;m in Rockford, Michigan, having performed last night at the Crazy Horse Saloon with Chicago&apos;s Dobie Maxwell, a good friend and funny comic. &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; and I handled the Blue State Rednecks as best as possible, and sold a bunch &apos;o swag after the show, but wallowed in self-pity afterwards....why can&apos;t they just sit still and enjoy the show? Don&apos;t they realize they aren&apos;t &quot;helping&quot; by shouting stuff out? I guess I got the one guy riled up...he had a cheesy John Waters moustache, and I told him he looked like a fluffer on Brokeback Mountain. My bad, Michigan.
The drive out was momentous, as it marked my return behind the wheel after carpooling, flying and doing mostly local gigs for the last month. I did 450 miles in just over six hours...you do the math. I cut across Ontario, Canada, which makes me a speed limit scofflaw in two countries. Oh well.....
The long drive allowed me plenty of time to think and reminisce, and for some reason, I thought back to 1984. In 1984, I was 17, and the drinking age in New York State was 18. I wouldn&apos;t turn 18 until November, so I was looking forward to it, until they announced that the drinking age would move to 19 in September. I was robbed! A whole year of drinking, hanging out in bars, and invariably meeting people and getting laid was being swiped out from underneath me! Funny how short-sighted we are at that age. So the next year, 1986, I&apos;m all primed to turn 19 and be legal to drink, and New York State decides to change the drinking age to 21, but won&apos;t enact it until December 1st. I would be legal for exactly two weeks, November 15 to December 1st, and I had a lot of drinking and stockpiling to do.
On my birthday, I wandered into a liquor store in my neighborhood, Rochester&apos;s 10th ward, and bought a small bottle of whiskey. I didn&apos;t even get carded! I was worrying about being refused sale for I.D., and in my white-trash neighborhood, they didn&apos;t give a dribbly shit howold you were, as long as they could make the sale without being busted. I found out that day that there were a lot of places you could buy booze without being carded, and bars that would serve you if you stayed in the back and didn&apos;t make a lot of ruckus.
I decided to celebrate by going to the House of Guitars (world famous music store in Rochester) and splurging some birthday cash on some albums. I purchased Metallica&apos;s &quot;Kill &apos;Em All&quot; and Mercyful Fate&apos;s &quot;Melissa&quot; albums because they looked cool. I didn&apos;t know about Mercyful Fate&apos;s music, but I already owned Metallica&apos;s &quot;Ride The Lightning,&quot; their second album, and wanted to hear what the first one sounded like. It was quite awesome to my young ears, as was the Fate, which sounded like really fast Judas Priest. I was officially a headbanger! I grew my hair long and developed a drinking problem. I used to tool around in a green Zephyr, which was basically a Ford Fairmont with design issues, blasting Metallica, Mercyful Fate, Slayer, Metal Church, and a bunch of other bands you probably never heard of.
When I returned to school in 1987, I was a bonafide music nut with a prestigious record collection, and I gravitated to the campus radio station. I wanted to share this music that had been the soundtrack to my drinking and partying life with the world!
While I was in school and active with the radio station, there was a girl who worked in the campus radio station who was also interning at WCMF, the big rock radio station in town, and she was beginning to do standup comedy. She convinced a bunch of us to go see her at Yuk Yuk&apos;s, the comedy club in town. I went, along with my roommate Larry, who was more of a Led Zeppelin guy. We put the car in the only parking spot I could find, one on a steep incline, and put the parking brake on. After the show, it had rained and froze, and the car wouldn&apos;t move, and we were so drunk, we forgot about the parking brake and the car wouldn&apos;t move. My brother had to come pick us up and shuttle us home, and by the next morning when I sobered up, I realized what happened and we went to go retrieve the car. I felt pretty stupid.
The good thing was that I was so enamored by the show, the comics were so funny (too bad I don&apos;t remember who I saw), that I decided I needed to try going up on stage. Actually, I had a few beers in me, and I heckled the middle act, and he killed me. But it felt powerful, and I wanted to feel that power. I went up at open mic after about six weeks of planning and plotting, and was terrible. And I stayed terrible for over a year. Finally I got the hang of it, and now I&apos;m doing it full time. Also, I don&apos;t drink anymore because of health reasons. Apparently I overdid it a bit when I was younger, and along with a lousy diet, I developed type 2 diabetes. Live and learn.
In retrospect, I guess I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. I have the best job in the world, a great wife and a beautiful daughter. It&apos;s too bad I had to come by them in such a roundabout way, but at least I did, and thank God for small favors.
Maybe tomorrow I&apos;ll tell you the story about how Dobie Maxwell almost killed my wife. I&apos;ll let you know.

 Home Sweet Home (Motley Crue) 
Posted on 01/09/2006 at 10:17 AM
Yes, I title all my journal entries after classic rock songs. I cross-post on AOL Journals, and the last year of entries can be seen by using the address at the bottom of this post.
Well, another successful week at the Rivercenter Comedy Club in San Antonio, Texas is at an end. The crowds weren&apos;t anything special, but the staff is always great, I sold a smattering of merchandise and worked with some very nice guys, J.J. Ramirez and Lew Richmond. It&apos;s going to be great to get back home to the wife and kid, though.
I&apos;ll miss this little efficiency apartment that I&apos;ve been holed up in since Wednesday night. As far as comedy condos go, it has it&apos;s ups and downs. The fact that as a feature, I get my own apartment and my own bathroom is a big plus. It&apos;s a nice convenience to have a little kitchen to cook in, which saves big bucks from the normal road food budget. Dining out usually means either the worst nutrition available, or a sit-down place with inflated prices and a gratuity to boot. You save money and come home malnourished, or be healthy and eliminate your profit margin.
And while I&apos;m thinking about it, why don&apos;t we send those starving kids in Eurasia big bags of McDonald&apos;s french fries? I saw Morgan Spurlock&apos;s documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot; and it seems that Mickey Dee&apos;s food could be a quick fix to fatten up those little walking rib-cages. Just a thought; don&apos;t crucify me....I&apos;m only trying to help. I figure a couple weeks of an American diet would get those kids back to fighting weight, and then maybe they could farm or walk to where the food is. I&apos;m just saying.
So I cooked meals in the condo this week, subsisting on whatever food the Walgreens grocery aisle had to offer. They had the basics, milk, bread, eggs, butter, hot sauce, microwaveable rice in a bag, cheese, canned roast beef with gravy, ramen noodles, peanut butter, powdered sugar-free drink mix (I&apos;m pre-diabetic), canned beef ravioli (sometimes you don&apos;t want to cook...don&apos;t judge me) and granola bars for the plane ridehome. I kept the food budget nice &apos;n&apos; tight, and ate pretty good considering the circumstances.
Now, last year when I was here, I bought the place a colander at a goodwill store so future comics could make spaghetti. For whatever reason, the colander is gone now, meaning I couldn&apos;t make spaghetti, one of my favorite road meals. I&apos;m bummed, because last time I was able to catch a ride from one of the local comics, and this week, no one really hung out so I was kind of stranded. I like to buy things for the condos that I stay in; I think it&apos;s just a good karma thing to do. Last year, I also bought a bath mat for the place because I hate stepping out of the shower onto a bare floor, and I&apos;m proud to say that it&apos;s still here. It&apos;s the little things like that that go a long way towards making a place livable.
The apartment here in San Antonio is as Spartan as you could be. Sure, there&apos;s a TV with cable, and a phone line so I could hook up to the internet. Last year, the TV remote went missing (come to find out it was in the headliner&apos;s apartment, 5 floors up....I didn&apos;t find that out until the last day I was here), and sometimes, the club decides they&apos;re just going to save money by not putting in a phone line...after all, comics all have their own cell phones, so why on Earth would they need a land line? I&apos;m not pointing any fingers *cough* *cough* Omaha *cough* *cough* Milwaukee *cough* but that gets downright annoying, especially when you get used to hotels that by and large have the wireless internet.
Now, I&apos;m no prima donna....I drive to gigs, and I can rough it with the best of them. But if you&apos;re going to set up a condo for me to stay in, shouldn&apos;t it be at least as good as a place you would have to stay for a week? I know that there&apos;s a small minority of comics who abuse the place, and they spoil it for the rest of us, but there are some basic amenities that shouldn&apos;t be skimped on because it&apos;s just disrespectful.
1. Is it too much to ask for the place to be cleaned properly? I don&apos;t mean hire the maids to come in, but if there&apos;s still garbage in the wastebasket, it doesn&apos;t do much for my condo confidence. Also, a dirty sink with whiskers from the last guy (or gal...I don&apos;t discriminate) is a dead giveaway that the cleaning person might have skimmed over the place in some areas.
2. Phone line and TV with remote, as outlined above. I&apos;ll work with broadcast TV if I have to; the networks are o.k. for me, as little TV as I watch to begin with.
3. If you&apos;re going to provide me with a kitchen, there should be some pots and pans to cook with. Basics; a frying pan, sauce pan and a spatula, and I&apos;m in business. Also, how about some dishes? Preferably microwave safe. I stayed at a condo oncethat had 1500 glasses and no can opener. Take the glasses back to the club, and get a can opener....they have &apos;em at the dollar store. I said fuck it a long time ago, and now I pack my own in my luggage like it was my toothbrush. And if the microwave doesn&apos;t work, don&apos;t tease me...throw that shit away. If I want to know what time it is that badly, I&apos;ll just look at my watch.
And while I&apos;m at it, let&apos;s have a burlap bag party on these asshole comics who adulterate the food in the condo fridge. If you&apos;re so bored that you have to jerk off in the mayonnaise, maybe some healing time in the hospital is just what you need. Comics get the short end of the showbiz stick enough times without having to worry about what one of our own is willing to do to us. I am leaving a part bottle of hot sauce in the fridge when I leave today, and I know damn well that it&apos;s just going to get thrown out because no comic in his right mind would trust it to be safe to consume. Which is a damn shame, I might add.
4. Proper window covering isn&apos;t just a good idea, it&apos;s for our safety. Anyone who has half a brain knows that different comics are checking in each week, they know the showtimes we perform, and when the condo is absolutely, positively uninhabited. What better time to sneak a peek through those broken blinds and look for DVD players, laptop computers, iPods and other electronic goodies? It&apos;s simple security, dammit!
5. Last but not least, just consider that most of us are professionals, trying out best to put on the best show possible for you, to make you money. If we have to live in a depressing, ramshackle place, we&apos;re not going to be enthusiastic, creative people. The comedy condo is a device that helps the club save on lodging costs, and most comics are respectful of the facilities because we&apos;d like to maintain our employment. As a club manager, shouldn&apos;t you do your part to make sure that the accommodations are livable? Just asking. I reported last year on a condo in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had a nasty roach problem, the furniture was beyond curbside, and the place was filthy. For real, what did I do to deserve that? Luckily, the club closed...no shit. Good riddance.
My plane for home doesn&apos;t leave for another eight hours, so I have some time to kill. Can&apos;t wait, to be honest.
Have a nice day.

 Old Man (Neil Young) 
Posted on 01/08/2006 at 01:03 PM
It&apos;s funny how hope comes around at the right time.
It&apos;s easy to get discouraged in the comedy business, or show business in general, because it is largely an industry that worships youth. At the ripe old age of 39, I often feel like I have nothing to contribute to the world of comedy, and even though I&apos;m a decent writer and performer, I feel that I would lose the nod to a performer of equal talents who was younger and in better shape. I understand the downside of casting, booking or choosing a performer who is older, and even though I generally get folks pegging me for as much as 10 years younger than I really am (good head of black hair helps a lot, but in the correct light, colonies of white hair make their appearance), I still feel that I&apos;m dismissed as &quot;old&quot; by the industry.
There are obvious exceptions, Lewis Black being one of them, but seriously, how many comics are getting breaks as relative unknowns going into their 40&apos;s? I work every week with circuit headliners in their 40&apos;s and sometimes 50&apos;s, and even though they make the living they make on the road, they really have no shot at any TV exposure, fame, or making it to the next level, whether that be film, TV or some other opportunity I can&apos;t even fathom. The tales of Rodney Dangerfield starting doing comedy in his 50&apos;s are widespread, and comics like Henny Youngman were pushing the envelope and doing standup dates well into their 80&apos;s (I saw Henny do a set on Comic Strip Live many years ago, and he was getting good laughs, but I couldn&apos;t tell if they were sincere or if he was just being paid homage). But these are only the exceptions; you would be hard-pressed to think of 10 more in an industry of thousands.
So with much sadness going into the New Year about being 39, having just celebrated the commemorative birthday of death&apos;s door back in November, I greeted January with a heavy heart and some considerable vocational depression. Until I heard the press conference; the Buffalo Bills, of whom I have been a fan of for 25 years, had announced that Hall Of Fame coach Marv Levy was returning to the organization as their new General Manager.
Marv Levy is a legendary coach, having guided teams in the college ranks, the USFL, Canadian Football League, and most recently, was the leader of the NFL&apos;s Buffalo Bills, the only team to appear in four consecutive Super Bowls. At the age of 80, Marv has accepted owner Ralph Wilson&apos;s offer to become the General Manager and Vice President of football operations.
In a job where the hours are not constrained to 9-to-5 and the workdays don&apos;t come five to a week and two days off, there is a great deal of stamina that is required to function at that high level in a multi-million dollar professional sports organization. Marv sounded great at the press conference on Thursday, which I heard live on my laptop courtesy of streaming video technology, and my heart swelled with pride and I&apos;m not ashamed to say that I wept a little with joy in the privacy of the Rivercenter Comedy Club&apos;s feature act condo apartment in faraway San Antonio, Texas.
Marv represents everything that&apos;s right with professional sports. His adage &quot;Don&apos;t be dumb, don&apos;t be dirty&quot; should be posted in the locker room of every professional sports team, particularly in the light of the events in yesterday&apos;s wild-card NFL game between the Redskins and the Buccaneers (there was some spitting in a debate between players, and a Redskin got ejected from the game). A talented guy like Terrell Owens would never have been allowed to burn like a tire fire the way he did for so long under Marv&apos;s tutelage. And I look forward to the overall improvement of the Buffalo Bills&apos; record under Marv&apos;s knowledgeable guidance.
Back in 1996, I appeared in a commercial for Sprint Long Distance with Marv Levy and Bills quarterback Jim Kelly. While I didn&apos;t care so much for Jim&apos;s condescending treatment of me, Coach Levy came over to me, greeted me with a friendly &quot;Hello, youngster!&quot; and after I gushed a bit and thanked him for his great work with the organization, he started asking me questions about myself, like how did I get into acting, and what shots had we done earlier in the day, and then just like that, Coach was off to the next person, shaking hands and smiling and just generally being a bright spot to everyone who was enduring a long, hot day of shooting in a merciless July sun. And this was only six months after enduring prostate cancer surgery to prevent the spread of cancer.
Most of all, coach Levy is an inspiration to me, that after hanging up his headset and retiring to a job inbroadcasting, he got fidgety and attempted a return to coaching, but was unable to find a fit or a team that would take a chance on a man who, even though he was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, was into his 70&apos;s. If he fails, and finds the General Manager&apos;s job to be too much for a man of his age, he will at least be able to take consolation that there was still one organization that was willing to acknowledge his skill and experience, and if he succeeds, well, then the entire national attitude towards age and aging must be looked at once again, to determine if we are writing people off at too early of an age.
And as I continue my approach towards 40, I will stand and applaud the efforts of a man twice my age who is carrying the torch for me, and everyone else who is looking for an opportunity to contribute to their field, despite the lines in their faces, the grey (or no) hairs on their head, and the twinkle of hope in eyes only beginning to grow dim.

 Feelin&apos; Satisfied (Boston) 
Posted on 01/07/2006 at 05:51 PM
It&apos;s 4 hours until showtime, and I&apos;m ready to bitch about it.
I&apos;m playing at one of my favorite clubs in the country, the money is great for a change, and I was able to afford to fly in rather than drive. Great, huh? The bad news is that we&apos;re at the low point of the tourist season, crowds are sparse, the local NBA team had a home game last night that drew against us and absolutely killed us, the movie theater that the club gets free tickets to is showing absolute CRAP, and my mc is not up to snuff.
First things first. The club is great, don&apos;t get me wrong. It is also huge, and to me, that means you should be doing some aggressive marketing to have decent crowds in the joint. There was an advertisement in the local daily, which is a lot more than some clubs across the country do, but seriously, 35 people in a room that is just a shade bigger than the ballroom of the Titanic is a little embarrassing. What do folks think when they see a show with 35 people in the audience? Even if everyone in the crowd laughed at full capacity at every joke, it&apos;s still a weird, empty feeling along the lines of &quot;What did I just see in there?&quot; versus &quot;Wow, what a show I saw!&quot; The crowds this week were so small, I thought I was playing for the New York Jets.
The club has a nice reciprocal agreement with a movie theater in the same mall, and comics can go see films for free. Last year I saw &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; which I liked, only because I didn&apos;t have to pay for it. This year, they&apos;re showing &quot;Hostel&quot; (No), &quot;Wolf Creek (See &quot;Hostel&quot;), King Kong (I know how it ends), &quot;Cheaper By The Dozen 2&quot; (Are You Fucking Kidding me?), &quot;Rumor Has It&quot; (Why do they even bother making films like this?), &quot;The Family Stone&quot; (Boo), &quot;Fun With Dick and Jane&quot; (Did Jim Carrey ever meet a paycheck he didn&apos;t like?), &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (o.k., looks decent, but I can&apos;t get the &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; rap out of my head, which would be annoying, and I don&apos;t think I have the patience to sit still for a movie that long), and finally, &quot;Grandma&apos;s Boy&quot; (Lord, please deliver me from idiot comedies). How bad is a slate of movies when you can honestly say, &quot;Gee, I wish &apos;The Ringer&apos; was playing?&quot; Pretty bad. I don&apos;t get the perks very often, so when they come down the pipe, I try to take advantage of them and be appreciative, but dammit, man! I have to schedule a return date in the summer when some good movies are out.
Finally, our mc is about 100 years old, and he&apos;s only been doing comedy for a couple of years. His crowd work is non-existent, and his material isn&apos;t even corny....it&apos;s just half-baked. I&apos;m in a position to book mc&apos;s, and I am remiss to book a comic until they show that they have at least a little bit of &quot;it,&quot; the spark that they get it, that they understand the comedy stage and can bring something to it that&apos;s at least engaging. The mc for this week is a great guy, nice as nice can be, but he just hasn&apos;t burst through the cellophane ceiling from open micer to qualified mc. It&apos;s a little frustrating following 15 or even 10 minutes of comedy that is met with overall audience indifference. Especially when there&apos;s only a few dozen folks there to begin with. Comedy is fragile, and you don&apos;t give the fine china to a guy wearing goalie gloves...it just doesn&apos;t work.
I know that all my bitching makes me sound like some sort of prima donna, but I woke up today with a pinched nerve in my shoulder courtesy of the bed in the feature condo, replete with hobo linens and the mattress of a thousand spanks, and it&apos;s making me a little cranky. I hope the shows tonight are better, and hopefully I&apos;ll check in tomorrow with some good news and rainbow thoughts.
Have a great weekend.

 My Best Friend&apos;s Girl (The Cars) 
Posted on 01/06/2006 at 11:29 AM
I have the best cock-block story of all time. Wanna hear it?
The names have been changed to protect the innocent, the guilty, and me. If you ask me, I will not divulge the identities of the persons involved, and if you guess them correctly, I will deny, deny, deny, so don&apos;t bother, o.k.? Just revel in the story and stop being such a fucking busybody.
Some time ago, I was traveling to an engagement with another comic, who asked if he could bring his girlfriend along. I said yes, because that sort of thing doesn&apos;t bother me. Now, this relationship was fairly new, and my comic friend was trying to make a good impression, so he asked me to try and represent him as best as possible. He&apos;s a decent guy who I&apos;ve come to know well for the last few years, so I didn&apos;t think that was a problem. The only problem in the equation is that I am a notoriously bad wingman. I&apos;m already married, so pursuit of women doesn&apos;t interest me anymore, nor does the examination of the &quot;rap&quot; that women want to hear. Consequently, the correct thing to say is never on my lips, and I can&apos;t imagine the opportunities that I&apos;ve capsized in my attempts to help a friend put what he has between his legs between the legs of his intended. Honestly, I mean well, but I must be socially retarded. The fact that I&apos;m married is definitely a testament to the patience, kindness and generosity of my wife, who is either the most naive woman in the world, or possessed of the saintly virtue of being able to overlook my copious shortcomings.
So we&apos;re in the car, my comic friend, his girlfriend and myself, and we&apos;re making the small talk. Along the way, I mention my father. His name is Ralph Tetta, the same as mine, and he worked for an envelope manufacturer in Rochester for 38 years in the shipping department, first as a clerk, and then for the remainder of his time there as a supervisor.
I will allow myself a time to indulge in describing my father to you, as it is important to the story. My father is my hero. He&apos;s made a few mistakes in life, but did wonderfully with what he had to work with. He&apos;s a product of a single mother, having never known his father,and learned from a woman who had just survived the Great Depression, cultivating a tendency towards hard work, savings, and an appreciation of what he had. Consequently, a lot of what I am is due to what I learned at his knee, such as a propesity to hoard and to be quite niggardly at times when it comes to spending. But I digress. My father left school when he was 14 to work and help support my grandmother and the household, which left him little time to be a kid and enjoy his youth. He worked, and when he wasn&apos;t working, he spent his time looking for work.
My father was a manager for most of his life, and well-liked by everyone he worked with. He was known as a guy who would lend you five bucks until payday if he had it to lend, because he knew that there was a time when he needed to extend his hand, and it was a way to show appreciation for the grace he received. When I was the General Manager of the Comix Cafe in Rochester, I did the same thing, fronting comics advances and burying the loans in the books until they were paid back (and I collected every dime). As a comic myself, I always understoond that the road was hard, and wanted to help where I could. My father shot straight and spoke the truth, and got in trouble more than once for calling someone a lazy S.O.B. or a piece of shit, or whatever epithet seemed appropriate at the time. He would never wear a shirt and tie to work, because he deemed that the garb of a guy who wouldn&apos;t be counted on to roll up his sleeves when the workload got heavy. Instead, he wore a long shopcoat and bermuda shorts in the summer, which made him look like a flasher. The point of all this was that when you worked with my father, you didn&apos;t forget him. He was a private man who rarely entertained at the house, but loved the spotlight and loved to joke around. Work was his method of socialization, and anyone he considered a friend was a work acquaintance. I am very much the same way.
So I&apos;m in the car with my comic friend and his girlfriend, and I mention my father, and I describe him as a tall, gangly man. At that moment, the girlfriend declares that she knows him, she worked with him before he retired, but didn&apos;t think he was my father because even though he&apos;s got the same name as me, I don&apos;t share his gangly frame. I actually inherited my girth from my mother&apos;s side of the family, although my father&apos;s mother was no slouch.
She starts spitting out intimate details about my father that only someone who worked with him would know, like little jokes he would tell, and how he would buy all the girls in the front office coffee in the morning (coffee was only 15 cents in the shop coffee machine, and my father was a shameless flirt, so it was a low-cost way to get away from the loading platform and whore around). We&apos;re in the car giggling and laughing, and my comic friend is dying inside, like he can&apos;t believe this is happening, and I go ahead and call my father in Florida (I owed him a call for the holidays) and he says to put the girl on the phone and they wind up chewing the fat until we went out of cellphone range, and my friend is cursing me out the whole way and threatening to go down to Florida and fight my father with his knuckles.
Can you imagine? My father retired in 1994, so this cock-block was over 12 years in the making. I laughed so hard, I almost wet myself in the car.
Bottom line, if you&apos;re trying to get laid, do me a favor and leave me out of it.

 Traveling Man (BobSeger)

Traveling Man 

Thursday, January 5, 2006-7:01 A.M. CST

Bruised and battered, weakened in body but strong in resolve, I report to you from San Antonio, Texas, just an Ozzy-piss away from the Alamo.
This is my first post of the new year, and I&apos;ve got some catching up to do.
First things first; New Year&apos;s Eve in St. Louis at the Comedy Forum was great, although the first show I drew some heckle-birds, which I did my best to dispatch but was overwhelmed by the shear numbers. Second show was great, but we wound up running just a bit short, and Mike Dambra, Chris Smith and I had to go back on stage and kill time while we waited for the ball to drop. The evening was mercifully short, and then New Year&apos;s Day was basically spent in the car driving home. Mike dropped me off at my doorstep around Midnight. I got bonused from the club, which is kind of rare, but it&apos;s nice when it happens.
The next two days off are a blur; I think I did laundry and went to stores and bought things and paid bills. On the one day, I was thwarted at every turn by old people...everywhere I would go, some old bastard would be holding up the line with their incessant whining or digging through some sarcouphagus of a purse looking for a penny that was minted sometime during the Woodrow Wilson administration. At the post office, there was this old biddy who was trying to sell her 37-cent stamps back to the guy in favor of the new 39-cent stamps, and she refused to just buy the 2-cent makeup stamps....she felt she already paid the money, and they should exchange the old stamps for the new ones, less the 2-cent increase. When they finally came to an agreement, she looked at all the people behind her and said &quot;Gee, the lines are long today!&quot; I wanted to beat her with her own cane.
So with all of my chores and tasks completed, I got ready for my flight Wednesday morning to Texas. Mike Dambra, the Ultimate Warrior of comedy, picked me up at 6:00 A.M. to take me to Buffalo, where I had a 8:24 A.M. flight to Chicago, a brief layover, and a 10:00 A.M. flight to San Antonio, where I would arrive at 1:00 P.M., just in time to have a nice nap, a shower and maybe a meal to get ready for the big 8:30 show.
Just as Mike was dropping me off at the United Airlines check-in counter, my phone rang with a special automated message from Expedia.com. The flight from Buffalo had been delayed and wouldn&apos;t take off until 10:00 A.M. At the ticket counter, I was informed that my new arrival time in San Antonio would be 11:52 P.M., approximately two hours after my show was scheduled to end. UNACCEPTABLE!
Luckily, the United ticket agent was able to put me on standby for a 2:37 P.M. departure out of Chicago that would get me to San Antonio by 5:30, three hours early for the show, and time to get a nice shower and a meal. Off I went into the friendly skies.
Upon arriving in Chicago, I immediately turned into Tom Hanks in &quot;The Terminal.&quot; I had my laptop, but they wanted to charge me $6.95 to connect to their wireless internet, and I&apos;m on a budget this week, so I declined. I ate a McDonald&apos;s lunch, which wasn&apos;t bad (I swear I must be addicted to fast food) and took my afternoon prescription medication which I had judiciously moved from my checked luggage to my carry-on bag, just in case this &quot;standby&quot; thing didn&apos;t work out to my favor. I can walk around stinking in my clothes and go buy new things if possible, but replacing lost medication can be a bitch. Then, I started walking around the terminal. I got some excercise, which in retrospect was a good idea, because I needed my legs limber for the tribulations that would follow.
Getting closer to the 2:37 P.M. mark, I called Coastal Entertainment to tell them of the situation, and kept calling to update them as the picture became clearer. While waiting, I struck up a conversation with a young man from Indiana named Jay who was heading to San Antonio to take pictures of his church&apos;s mission group. We talked about religion at length, and as he had two daughters, we did the obligatory picture swap, showing off our little darlings. He was flying standby as well, but was 10th on the list, and as I was first, I was hopeful for my chances of getting on the plane, but not so much for him. He wasn&apos;t in any particular hurry, so he was taking everything in stride. Somewhere along the line, I let go of my expectations, too, figuring that I wouldn&apos;t be the first comic who missed a show because of airline complications beyond their control, and I should just stop stressing about it. Still, I said at least one silent prayer that there would be room on that plane for me.
Around 2:30, it was announced that the plane we were going to take wasn&apos;t arriving until 2:35, meaining the flight was delayed because you can&apos;t deplane 100 passengers and their luggage and reboard another 100 people in two minutes. The plane boarded, and my name was called even before the first passengers got on. I was ecstatic, and started making calls to my wife and booking agent to let them know that I was going to make it. Still, I felt a little sorry for Jay, who possibly was looking at spending another 4 hours in the airport, sitting and waiting. We had been talking earlier about the whole standby experience, and he mentioned that he changed into slacks and dress shoes because you have a better chance of getting a first-class seat if you&apos;re dressed well. And sure as shit, Jay got on the plane, and from seat 11-F, I could see him stowing his luggage into the overhead compartment in the first-class section. You go, boy! I guess when the Bible says &quot;the last shall be first and the first shall be last,&quot; they weren&apos;t kidding.
So our 2:37 flight wound up being pushed to 2:50, then 3:00, then 3:15. After everyone had boarded the plane (and believe me, there were plenty of seats....the one next to me remained empty, meaning everyone who wanted to fly to San Antonio got on), we sat for another 45 minutes while the baggage guys loaded some bags they forgot to bring on their first trip. So now, I&apos;m calculating my arrival time with a 4 o&apos;clock departure, I&apos;m getting to Texas at 7 o&apos;clock, picking up my bags and catching a cab to make an 8:30 show, and I&apos;m figuring that I might not even have time to shower, much less eat. I grab my bags, which were within the first dozen off the baggage carousel, and ran outside after giving Jay a fond farewell. I grabbed the first cab available, and explained my hurry, and 12 minutes later, we pulled up in front of the Maverick apartments. I had a nice shower, changed into some clean clothing, and headed over to the Rivercenter mall.
The show was light, about 35 people, and I laughed a little inside, that this was what I labored 13 hours to make it to on time. But I ran on shear adrenaline (and a diet coke) and turned in a good performance. Headliner J.J. Ramirez from NYC did a great job, and after shaking hands and kissing babies (and selling one of my &quot;Ralph Tetta Box Sets,&quot; namely a CD/DVD combo), J.J. and I beelined for the Denny&apos;s restaurant next to the mall, and I ate a Super Bird sandwich like they were going to take it away from me any second. We told stories about comics we knew in kind, and retreated back to the Maverick where we parted company. The building has a keypad security feature that didn&apos;t work last time I was here, and while J.J. was trying to remember the digits, I just opened the door and gestured for him to enter. At least it&apos;s a deterrent for any shady folk who haven&apos;t completely cased the joint.
I&apos;m looking forward to a good week; our mc is in his 70&apos;s so I hope they don&apos;t give him the light, because he might start walking towards it....Bada Bing! I&apos;ll be here all weekend.
And try the veal (have you ever seen veal on the menu at a comedy club? If I opened a club, I would put it on there just to be funny, and if anyone ordered it, I would tell them we were sold out of it).

Continuing on my road trip in St. Louis, Missouri...last night was great, I jammed two great shows down the throats of the fine people at the Comedy Forum. Headliner and mentor Mike Dambra lambasted me all the way across Missouri, chiding me for not doing my best. He accused me of phoning it in, and when I asked him if he thought that was going to make me mad and get me to change, he said &quot;Absolutely.&quot; Well, he&apos;s been mind-manipulating me for the last three years that I&apos;ve been under his wing, and he was absolutely right. I took the stage by storm, despite some abdominal discomfort caused by clam strips on the buffet at Ponderosa (I&apos;m having really lousy luck with buffets this week, eh?) and turned in two great shows. Matt, the owner of the club, asked if I had the bullets to close, so this might lead to the end of my quest to move up to closer status. 2006 is looking brighter every day.

This will be my last entry for 2005, and it&apos;s been an incredible year. Looking back, all the way to New Year&apos;s Eve last year, when I was requested to play the Comedy Zone in Greensboro, North Carolina, to scoring headliner spots at my home club as well as the House of Comedy in Niagara Falls, Canada and Fat Katz in Utica, NY, Comedy Company dates in Dunkirk, NY and Williamsport, PA, Syracuse, NY and Fredericksburg, VA, and the summer tour in Florida and Georgia, it has definitely been my best year ever and the herald of great things to come. 

This year, I performed in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, New York, Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Minnesota, Connecticut, Ohio, Virginia, Tennesee, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Nebraska, North Dakota, Kentucky and Missouri, as well as Ontario, Canada. 23 states and one Canadian Province...not too shabby. I still haven&apos;t played New Jersey, which strikes me as odd considering it&apos;s only one state over from my home, and I&apos;ve had 17 years to make it happen...maybe 2006 will be my chance. Also, I never got to West Virginia....I used to do a lot more work in that state, but I have it on the books for 2006.

I&apos;ve worked with some great people this year, comics I&apos;ve had a lot of fun with, and while I probably couldn&apos;t remember them all, I&apos;ll try to mention them all...much thanks and a white-boy shout-out to Mutzie, Joseph Anthony, Bill Benden, Carol Pennington, Jay Black, Mark Knope, Jocko Alston, Nick Siracuse, Jack Wilhite, Richard Ramirez, Jim Dailakis, Ari Van Eyk, Dennis Ross, Jimmy Graham, Dan Ellison, David Graham, Chris Coccia, Mimi Gonazalez, Ray Salah, Pete Johannsen, Paul Hooper, Mo Alexander, Mark Klein, Claud Stuart, Shelly Marshall, Bobby Dean, Mike Armstrong, Chris Barnes, Al Katz, Randolph T., Scotty Goff, Bob Jay, Derek Richards, Pete Lee, Peter Jung, Mike Irwin, Mark Anthony, Stephen Juliano Moore, Bryan McCree, Keith Lenart, Mike Dambra and Chris Smith. I hope you all have a dynamite 2006. Mega-Mega hollas to Steve Burr, T.L. Johnson, Joe Fico, Mark Wiedmann, Annette Lorenzo, Danny Liberto, V.J. Stanley, Marianne Sierk, and everyone who hung out, drank, tagged or just supported....keep kicking ass and making &apos;em laugh!

 Have A Nice Day (Bon Jovi)

Good morning from the Stoney Creek Inn in fabulous St. Joseph, Missouri. Finally got some sleep after a fine show at the Cobblestone Theater downtown, and about to rape and pillage the continental breakfast....prepare to board, me hearties! Arrrr!
The show was great last night...headliner, old friend and confidant Mike Dambra called me &quot;a disaster&quot; when I left the stage, although I don&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about. I think he&apos;s being overly critical of me, like he thinks I&apos;m not getting the laughs I&apos;m supposed to be getting. I think the set was strong, but I appreciate his view. I get wordy and unfocused when I&apos;m tired, and after the seven hour drive with not much sleep the night before, I was plenty tired.
In the car on the way here from Carbondale, somewhere along the line, I snapped and went into a roll that made Mike laugh so hard he started crying. He turned red and I thought he was going to drive off the road...I was mocking his music, which he has been torturing me with since we left Rochester. Who knew that Bon Jovi put out so many albums? That there was a Bon Jovi box set? Who the fuck is Jim Brickman, and why is a heterosexual man subjecting me to it? At one point, the music was so bad, I said, &quot;Please put Bon Jovi back on...any album is fine....play the one with no hits, I don&apos;t care.&quot; Mike laughed hard at that one. Who carries the &quot;Young Guns&quot; soundtrack with him? He has one CD that I actually want to hear, Jackson Browne&apos;s &quot;Running On Empty,&quot; but apparently, I have to get through Garth Brook&apos;s double live album first. Where&apos;s Peter Frampton when you need him? I got so mad, I wished triple-dog ill will and a ham sandwich on a truck driver who was going too slow in the passing lane, and then wished the same on a friend of ours back in Rochester, although accidentally. If I get home and see him and his asshole hasn&apos;t fallen out, I&apos;ll know he&apos;s o.k.
We ate dinner at a Chinese buffet, one of my favorite places to go. It seems a little too convenient that there&apos;s a Chinese buffet restaurant in every city in America, regardless of the population. I think it&apos;s part of a takeover plan. The food was delicious for the first plate, and then I chanced the sweet &apos;n&apos; sour chicken, which I never do, and after one bite, I had to spit it out into my napkin. I don&apos;t know what cat tastes like, but I suspect it would have been something like that. Of course, everything went downhill from there. The biggest problem, I guess, is that I deviated from my routine, which includes a nice bowl of hot &apos;n&apos; sour soup, try the sushi if it&apos;s available, and work slowly. I was so hungry though, that I just started grabbing stuff. Also, I didn&apos;t get any stuffed mushrooms, a Ralph Tetta Chinese buffet staple. I hope to rectify this today; there&apos;s a really good buffet in St. Charles, Missouri, where Mike and I will be performing tonight and tomorrow.
Word from home is that little Harmony Rose had a fever the night before, but Pamela has it under control. Baby Tylenol drops (cherry flavor) seem to be doing the trick, but it&apos;s quite the helpless feeling when your baby isn&apos;t feeling well, and you&apos;re a thousand miles away. Even if I was home, sick child care is best administered by Mommy rather than Daddy....Mommy will give you the medicine, rub your back and hold you and sing softly to you until you fall asleep. Daddy will spoon Robitussin down your throat and send you packing so he doesn&apos;t miss the next hand of video poker.
It&apos;s true.
O.K., off to the coffee and danish. Have a nice day.

 Sleepless (King Crimson) 
Posted on 12/29/2005 at 09:50 AM
Good morning from Carbondale, Illinois, from the beautiful Super 8 motel on Main Street. Yesterday was the hell drive from Rochester, NY....13 grueling hours in a rental car with Mike Dambra. Thankfully, we had a month of road stories to share or it would have dragged on forever.
We&apos;re tooling around in his rental car from the week before, a Ford Taurus from the Hertz rental car agency. It has one of those onboard GPS systems, a little gadget that looks like a pocket calculator on a bracket at a 45 degree angle, which talks to you and tells you how to get where you&apos;re going. It&apos;s awesome, and I don&apos;t know how I&apos;m going to live without one after the week is up. It even tells you how many miles are left to your journey, and calculates how long it will take you to get there based on your traveling speed. Oh, how spoiled I am!
So we arrived in C-town around 1:30, accounting for the time zone difference after a long overnight drive, checked in to the hotel and slept. We got to the show plenty early, and they regaled us with comped food and beverages (nice people). I enjoyed a delicious grilled chicken salad, in a feeble attempt to have something in my body that looked like vegetables.
The show was sparsely attended, what with the whole Christmas/New Year&apos;s hangover week in full effect. Yeah, I don&apos;t want to go back to work either, but you gotta do what you gotta do. I pulled teeth for half an hour and then watched Mike work his magic, but there were too many empty seats, the crowd was too spread out, and nobody too much cared. We got paid and headed to Steak and Shake for a little late-night repast (Mike quit smoking, which made him hungry, I guess, and I&apos;m always hungry so I didn&apos;t complain) and we reminisced that the last time we worked this room, we ate at the same place, and there was a cockroach, and we got our meal comped. No roach this time around, thankfully, and we returned to the hotel for a good night&apos;s sleep.
Only I&apos;m not sleeping....I don&apos;t know what it is, but I don&apos;t sleep well at night very much...maybe I&apos;m excited about the rest of the week, or I slept in the car while Mike drove and now I&apos;m all out of kilter, but I&apos;m awake at 4:55 in the morning, and I have an 8 A.M. wake up call, and I&apos;m typing instead of sawing wood. I&apos;m sure things will even out at some point this week, and I&apos;m hoping sooner than later. We&apos;ve got a seven hour puddle jump today to St. Joseph, Missouri, and then we start heading eastward towards St. Charles (St. Louis) and then back home, and then a few days off until San Antonio.
The 2006 machine has already started grinding, and it&apos;s not even here yet. Good God.
