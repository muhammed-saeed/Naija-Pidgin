Gram Stain separates bact into two major groups Procedure = crystal violet stain wash with water flood with iodine wash with water decolorize with alcohol counter stain with safranin o Gram-positive holds crystal violet and appear blue o Gram-negative crystal violet washed away by alcohol. Cells absorb safranin (red) Bacterial cell membrane/cell wall Peptidoglycan layer = cell wall - layer outside plasma membrane. Present in G+ and Go Transpeptidase (penicillin binding protein) cross linkages in peptidoglycan layer Target of penicillin o G+ - cell wall is thick with extensive cross-linking Contains teichoic acid = antigenic determinant helpful in ID of many G+ species NO ENDOTOXIN (exception = Listeria monocytogenes = TQ) o G- - cell wall is thin with simple cross-linking. NO teichoic acid G- cell wall 3 layers. From inside to out, they are: o Plasma membrane Periplasmic space b/w PM and peptidoglycan layer o Thin peptidoglycan layer murein lipoprotein links this layer to the outer PM o Outer cell membrane contains LPS. Protects cell wall from some abx (e.g. pcn) LPS three components O-antigen outer component. Antigenic determinant. Core polysaccharide Lipid A = Endotoxin. All G- possess. o Lysing of bact by immune system and/or abx release of lipid A fever, diarrhea, shock (septic shock) Bacterial Morphology Cocci spherical Bacilli rods (short rods are called coccobacilli) Spiral forms comma, ,,S or spiral shaped Pleomorphic no distinct shape G+ bacteria assoc with human dz (only 6) Streptococcus strips of cocci Staphylococcus clusters of cocci Spore formers o Bacillus o Clostridium Corynebacterium Listeria G Diplococcus (Neisseria) is the only G- coccus All other gram negative organisms are rods or pleomorphs Others Mycobacteria acid-fast stain (bugs that cause tuberculosis and leprosy) Spirochetes gram negative, but too small to be seen with light microscopy. Can be seen via dark field microscopy Mycoplasma no cell wall neither G+ nor GBacterial ribosomes 70S. Sub-units 30S (inhibited by tetracyclines) and 50S (inhibited by macrolides)
Oxygen and Carbon Source Macrophages produce oxyradicals to destroy bacteria How do bacteria deal with oxyradicals (oxidative stress)? o Catalase 2H2O2 H2O + O2 o Peroxidase also metabolizes hydrogen peroxide o Superoxide dismutase (SOD) O2- + O2- + 2H+ H2O2 + O2 Breaks down superoxide radical Obligate Aerobes use glycolysis, TCA and ETC. Possess catalase, peroxidase and SOD. Facultative anaerobes use oxygen as final electron acceptor. Make catalase and SOD. Can grow in absence of oxygen (fermentation) Microaerophilic (aerotolerant anaerobes) no ETC, use only fermentation. Can tolerate small amts of O2 because they synthesize SOD (no catalase) Obligate aerobes oxygen haters. Harbor no enzymes to protect from oxidative stress Chemoheterotrophs all clinically important bugs. They use organic compounds (e.g. glucose) for energy Obligate intracellular organisms (Chlamydia and Rickettsia) must steal ATP from host Virulence degree of pathogenicity Flagella confers motility and allows for chemotaxis. Increase virulence. Connected to bact by basal body. Pili (aka fimbriae) can serve as adherence factors Capsules macs and neutrophils are unable to phagocytize encapsulated organisms o Usu made of sugar residues except Bacillus anthracis, which has aa capsule o India ink stain e.g. cryptococcus o Quellung reaction bacteria mixed with Abs. Abs bind and capsule swells o Opsonization Abs against capsule antigens can coat organism and facilitate phagocytosis o Pneumovax 23 capsule Ags injected stimulate immune system to make Abs against Ags Abs act as opsonins in cases of infection Endospores (Bacillus and Clostridium). Metabolically dormant and resistant to heat o form during times of nutrient shortage. Becomes active when nutrients are again available o autoclaving destroys spores (15 min, 15 psi, 121C) Facultative intracellular organisms inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion. To be covered individually later. Listeria monocytogenes Salmonella typhi Yersinia Francisella tularensis Brucella Legionella Mycobacterium Toxins Exotoxins released by G+ and G- organisms. All G+, except Listeria, release. Many have two polypeptide sub-units. Sub-unit involved in binding target is called ,,B or ,,H. Sub-unit exerting toxic effect is called ,,A or ,,L o Neurotoxins e.g. tetanus and botulinum toxins (discussed later) o Enterotoxins usu cz diarrhea by way of inhibiting NaCl resorption, activating NaCl secretion (osmosis) Infectious diarrhea Food poisoning ingest preformed toxin diarrhea and vomiting ensue usu resolves within 24h o Pyrogenic exotoxins release cytokines rash, fever, or toxic shock syndrome o Tissue invasive exotoxins Endotoxin again = lipid A. Not a protein secreted from cells, but a lipid that is continually shed by Gorganisms and Listeria, esp during cell lysis o Septic shock number one cause of death in ICU. Aka endotoxic shock.
o o o
Bacteremia bacteria in the bloodstream Sepsis refers to bacteremia that causes a systemic immune response to the infection High temp, WBCs, tachycardia, tachypnea Septic shock dangerous drops in BP and associated organ dysfunction (e.g. acute renal failure). Aka endotoxic shock. Spread of localized infection bacteremia release of exotoxin or endotoxin stimulation of immune cells (macs and neuts) release of endogenous mediators of shock response TNF aka cachectin. Key endogenous mediator of sepsis. Causes wasting in cancer pts (cachexia) IL-1 and other cytokines and PGs vasodilation, hypotension, organ system dysfunction o Systemic vasodilation, myocardial depression, acute renal failure, ARDS, hepatic failure, encephalopathy, DIC Tx find site of infection and start broad spectrum abx find bug responsible and then specifically tailor abx to target culprit organism Maintain BP with fluids and NE or dopamine Maintain oxygenation (intubation and ventilation is often necessary.
Bacterial Genetics bacterial chromosome is circular dsDNA. One copy per cell = haploid state. Transformation DNA released during cell lysis binds to cell wall of neighboring competent (same species) bacterium and is taken up and incorporated into recipients genome. o Griffith 1928 classic experiment with two strains of pneumococci (the little bastard that causes pneumonia) Smooth encapsulated colonies = virulent inject into mice mice die Rough nonencapsulated colonies = nonvirulent inject into mice no effect Heat killed smooth + live rough inject into mice mice die live smooth cultured from animals (rough organisms were transformed into smooth organisms) The above experiments illustrated that the rough bacteria were somehow&quot;transformed&quot;by some component of the dead smooth bugs. Transduction process by which a bacteriophage carries a piece of bact DNA from one organism to another o Phage nucleic acid genome surrounded by a protein coat (capsid). Phage binds to bacterium (adsorption) and undergoes penetration. Phage genome is then injected into bacterial host. o Virulent phage infects reproduces lysis (kills bacterium). Generalized transduction = adsorption penetration destruction of bacteriums DNA some residual bacterial DNA fragments remain and are randomly packaged into viral capsids, which arent infective (i.e. contain no viral genome). The phage capsids containing bact DNA adsorp and penetrate other bacteria, but there is no infection, only DNA transfer (i.e. transduction). o Temperate phage infects incorporated (as an integrated prophage) into hosts genome can become activated and virulent at a later date. Specialized transduction when an integrated prophage becomes active, it is sometimes erroneously spliced out of bact genome. The result is that bacterial DNA that was flanking the integrated provirus is carried with the provirus. The provirus/bacterial DNA is packaged and transferred to another bacterium upon infection. Lysogenic conversion transfer of gene from one bacterium to another via specialized transduction. o Biotin gene carried by lambda phage from one E coli to another o Diptheria exotoxin obtained by lysogenic conversion (TQ) o Lysogenic immunity ability of integrated prophage to block infection by a similar phage. Integrated prophage accomplishes this via production of a repressor protein
 Conjugation major mechanism for transfer of antibiotic resistance (TQ) o F plasmid encodes enzymes and proteins for sex pilus o F+ organism passes F plasmid, through pilus, to F- organism. The F- organism becomes F+ and forms a pilus. The cycle goes on and on. Its a good thing this doesnt happen in humans! Transposons mobile genetic elements, which can insert themselves into a donor chromosome without having DNA homology. This is a mechanism for passage of antibiotic resistant genes from one species to another. Streptococci strips of cocci. Catalase negative. Five strains cause human dz. Putthoff will annihilate you on the exam if you don&apos;t know strep and staph inside and out. Hemolysis classified based on ability to lyse red blood cells o Beta-hemolytic complete lysis of RBCs, leaving a clear zone around colony o Alpha-hemolytic partial lysis of RBCs, leaving greenish discoloration around colony o Gamma-hemolytic unable to hemolyze RBCs. Aka non-hemolytic Lancefield antigens classification based on the antigenic characteristics of the C carbohydrate. o Groups A,B and D are clinically significant o Strep pneumoniae and Strep viridans have no Lancefield antigens Beta hemolytic Group A strep (Streptococcus pyogenes). It will be called S. pyogenes on the exam. o M protein major virulence factor for Group A strep. Inhibits the activation of CoMplement. o Streptolysin O oxygen labile toxin. Destroys red and white blood cells. Mechanism of beta hemolytic activity. ASO (anti-streptolysin O) antibodies develop in response to infection with strep. ASO titer can be used to confirm infection with Group A strep. o Streptolysin S oxygen stable toxin. Also mediates beta hemolysis, but is not antigenic o Pyrogenic exotoxin aka erythrogenic toxin. Found in a few strains that cz Scarlet fever. Acquired by lysogenic conversion. o Other virulence factors = streptokinase, hyaluronidase, DNases, anti-C5a peptidase o Dz mediated by local invasion or exotoxin release Pharyngitis red, swollen tonsils and pharynx. Purulent exudate on the tonsils, fever, lymphadenopathy. Pcn is curative. Skin infections Folliculitis infection of hair follicles Cellulites deep skin infection rubor, tumor, calor, dolor Impetigo vesicular, blistered eruption. Crusty and flaky and frequently perioral. Most common in kids. Necrotizing fasciitis (flesh eating strep) strep enter through lesion on skin spread along fascial planes rubor, tumor and calor skin changes from red to blue bullae form. May include myositis. Must be dx early. Surg followed by abx is required. Mortality is high. Scarlet fever pyrogenic toxin is involved. Scarlet red rash begins on trunk and neck, then spreads to extremities. Spares the face. Toxic shock syndrome mediated by pyrogenic toxin. Similar to S aureus toxic shock ( see later) o Delayed antibody-mediated disease Rheumatic fever usu in kids 5-15. Follows untreated pharyngitis, but NOT skin infections Fever Myocarditis inflammation of the heart chest pain, arrhythmias, and occasional heart failure o Abs against strep cross react with heart antigens o Recurrent infections permanent valvular damage. Mitral most common (aortic second most common) o Once damaged, valves are susceptible to damage by other bacteria. Consequently, prophylactic amoxicillin is often
administered before minor surgical or dental procedures performed in patients with an hx of rheumatic fever. Joint swelling acute migratory polyarthritis Chorea Erythema marginatum rash with red margin that spreads from center Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis occurs one week after pharyngitis OR skin infection Streptococcal antigens complex with antibodies formed during immune response deposition of AgAb complexes in GBM activation of complement cascade glomerular destruction fluid retention Kids will present with cola colored urine (hematuria), puffy face (fluid retention), and high BP. However, prognosis is good Beta hemolytic Group B (baby) Strep (Streptococcus agalactiae) women carry vaginally baby acquires during delivery. o major cause of neonatal pneumonia and sepsis o group B strep&gt;E. coli&gt;Listeria monocytogenes = 3 most common causes of meningitis in neonates (TQ) Group D strep alpha-hemolytic. o Enterococcus (E. faecalis and E. faecium) normal bowel flora. Grow in bile and 6.5% NaCl (halophilic). Cause urinary, biliary tract and blood infections as well as SBE (see Viridans). Again, these bugs are normal flora. They are a major cause of nosocomial infection Many strains are resistant to ampicillin. Some are even resistant to vancomycin. o Non-enterococci (S. bovis and S. equines). Normal GI flora. Glow in bile but NOT in 6.5% NaCl. S. bovis in the blood correlates with cancer in the bowel (TQ) Viridans Group Strep (no Lancefield Ag) alpha-hemolytic (viridans = green = partial hemolysis). Optochin resistant*. o Normal flora in GI tract, nasopharynx, and gingival crevices o Dental infections S. mutans causes dental caries o Endocarditis dental manipulations send these bugs into bloodstream implantation on previously damaged heart valves (e.g. from S.pyogenes rheumatic fever) SBE SBE caused by S. viridans or Group D strep. Slow development of fever, fatigue, anemia, and murmurs Differs from acute bact endocarditis usu czed by S. aureus. Common in IVDA. Acute onset of chills, spiking fevers and rapid valve destruction o Abscesses S. intermedius. Microaerophilic group that are often found alone or in combination with anaerobes in abscesses (e.g. in brain or GI tract) If S. intermedius is cultured from the blood, look for an abscess as the source. Streptococcus pneumoniae (no Lancefield antigen) alpha-hemolytic. Affects adults (unlike group B which affects babies). Aka pneumococcus. Optochin sensitive. o Lancet-shaped G+ diplococcus o Polysaccharide capsule is major virulence factor. 84 serotypes!! o Most common cause on pneumonia in adults Sudden onset of shaking chills, fever, chest pain, and dyspnea Consolidations evident of CXR Patient coughs up yellow-green phlegm (tasty) bearing G+ diplococci o Most common cause of pediatric otitis media o Most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults o Pneumovax contains 25 of most common capsular Ags promotes formation of anticapsule Abs opsonization of organisms in event of infection. Should be given to immunocompromised, elderly, and asplenic patients (asplenic patients are highly susceptible to infection by encapsulated organisms) o Some strains are resistant to pcns. Resistance to other abx is becoming a problem
Staphylococci clusters of cocci. Catalase positive. 3 pathogenic species. Remember, Putthoff will annihilate you on the exam if you don&apos;t know strep and staph inside and out. Differentiating staph from strep o Gram stain staph in clusters, strep in chains (strips) o Catalase all staph are catalase positive. All strep are catalase negative o Culture Staph aureus is beta hemolytic (like group A and group B strep); however, it elaborates a golden (aureus) pigment on sheep blood agar Staph aureus is coagulase positive. Other important Staph are coagulase negative Coagulase stimulates prothrombin clotting Staph aureus Jarrods microorganism classification schema = this bug is a bad-ass son-of-a-bitch o Proteins that jack up host&apos;s immune defenses Protein A has Fc binding sites protects organism from opsonization Coagulase fibrin formation around organism protects from phagocytosis Hemolysins destroy RBCs, neuts, macs, and platelets Leukocidins destroy WBCs Penicillinase secreted form of beta-lactamase disrupts pcn molecule Novel PBP aka transpeptidase, target of pcn. The novel form is resistant to pcn o Tunneling proteins Hyaluronidase spreading factor lyses proteoglycans in CT Staphylokinase lyses clots Lipase degrades fats and oils. Facilitates colonization of sebaceous glands Protease o Exotoxins Exfoliatin causes skin to slough - scalded skin syndrome Usu affects neonates with recently severed umbilicus or older kids with skin infections o Cleavage of the middle epidermis fine sheets of skin peel off red moist skin revealed. o Healing is rapid and mortality low o Can mimic drug allergy, which must be ruled out Enterotoxins (heat stable) cause food poisoning Organisms grow in food and release exotoxin. Host ingests pre-formed toxin peristalsis, diarrhea, vomiting, and abd pain. 12-24h course. Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1) similar to group A streps pyrogenic toxin, but worse. Note: please change tampons regularly. Toxin is superantigen that binds to MHC II on APCs massive T-cell response huge surge of cytokine release fever, vomiting, diarrhea, septic shock, desquamation of palms and soles, diffuse red rash Abortions, childbirth, infected surgical sutures = also implicated in TSST1 release. o Pneumonia aureus is a common cause of nosocomial pneumonia. Usu follows flu virus Abrupt onset of chills, fever, consolidation of lung, rapid destruction of pulmonary parenchyma cavitations (holes in the lungs). Empyema pus in the pleural space o Meningitis, cerebritis, brain abscess o Osteomyelitis hematogenous spread of infection to bone. Most common in boys&lt;12. Warm swollen tissue overlying affected bones. Fever and shakes. o Acute endocarditis high fever, chills, myalgias. Often no hx of valvular dz. Vegetations (organisms) grow quickly on valves embolize (brain if left heart; lungs if right heart) IVDA tricuspid valve endocarditis (TQ). May present with pneumonia embolization of fragments from tricuspid valve seeding of lungs with organisms Much more fulminant than SBE caused by group D strep or Viridans. o Septic arthritis acutely painful, red, swollen joint with ROM. Aureus is the most common cz of septic arthritis in pedi pts and pts over 50 Aspiration of synovial fluid required for dx. Synovial aspirate is yellow, turbid and laden with neuts.
Skin infections minor skin infections are nearly exclusively caused by group A strep (pyogenes)) or Staph aureus. Clinically impossible to distinguish between the two. Strep sensitive to pen G, staph are often resistant to pen G. As a result, tx should be with penicillinase-resistant pcn. Scratching spreads the infection Impetigo infection on face (esp perioral). Vesicles pustules honey-colored, wet, flaky crust (TQ) Cellulitis hot, red, shiny, swollen tissue. Represents a deeper infection. Abscess collection of puss Furuncle folliculitis deep penetration into subcutaneous tissue Carbuncles multiple, communicating, painful, subcutaneous lesions Wounds any wound can become infected with aureus. If surgical wounds become infected, they must be re-opened and allowed to heal by secondary intention (from the bottom of wound outward) o Blood and catheter infections aureus can migrate from skin and colonize central venous lines bacteremia, sepsis and septic shock. Can also endocarditis o MRSA usu develop nosocomially. These bugs are resistant to penicillinase-resistant pcns. Vancomycin is the drug of choice for these critters. Staph epidermidis coagulase negative. Normal skin flora. o Compromised hospital patients with Foley urine catheters or IV lines can become infected (TQ) Organism migrates from skin along the tubing of the catheter o Epidermidis often contaminates blood culture samples drawn through skin o Causes infections of prosthetic devices (TQ) heart valves, prosthetic joints, peritoneal dialysis catheters, etc. Organism has a polysaccharide capsule that adheres to prosthetic materials. Staph saprophyticus second most common cause of UTIs in sexually active young women ( E. coli is number one). o Coagulase negative o Bacillus (aerobic, spore-forming G+ rods) Bacillus anthracis unique protein capsule (poly-D-glutamic acid) prevents phagocytosis. Causes anthrax, which usu affects herbivores, e.g. cows and sheep. Humans are exposed to spores during contact with animals or animal products (hides, wool, drums, rugs). Human to human transmission hasnt been reported. Pcn = tx o Spores resistant to heat, UV, disinfectants. Spores germinate when they contact lungs, intestines or skin wounds. Spores are small (1-2 m) and can enter alveoli. Spores are phagocytized by macs, germinate into G+ rods, leave macs, and enter bloodstream o Pulmonary anthrax nearly always lethal. Aka wool sorters dz. Spores germinate within macs in the hilar and mediastinal nodes where they germinate. This explains the mediastinal widening on CXR. o Cutaneous anthrax most common mode of entry. Release of potent exotoxin local tissue necrosis = painless, round, black lesion with edematous rim =&quot;malignant pustule&quot;Abx are curative. Without tx, organisms can enter bloodstream. Skin lesion usually resolves spontaneously o GI anthrax usu fatal. Rare. Usu contracted from contaminated meat. Presentation = bloody diarrhea, abd pain, vomiting. Exotoxin causes necrotic lesion within the intestine o Exotoxin encoded by genes on plasmid&quot;pXO1&quot;. Three components Edema factor (EF) ,,A sub-unit of exotoxin. This protein is a calmodulin dependent adenylate cyclase cAMP disruption of fluid homeostasis Protective antigen (PA) ,,B sub-unit of exotoxin. Promotes entry of EF into phagocytes Lethal Factor (LF) a zinc metalloprotease. Stimulates macs to release TNF- and IL-1, which contribute to mortality in anthrax
pXO2 plasmid containing three genes required for ply-glutamyl capsule, which inhibits phagocytosis. Both capsules are required for virulence. Bacillus cereus motile, non-encapsulated, pcn resistant. Causes food poisoning. o Spores survive the cooking process spores germinate in cooked food release Enterotoxins Heat-labile toxin similar to cholera toxin and LT toxin from E. coli Heat-stable toxin produces syndrome similar to S. aureus food poisoning o No abx necessary, as syndrome is caused by preformed toxins. o Rice is a common source of B. cereus food poisoning (Chinese buffet in HPI) Clostridium (anaerobic, spore-forming G+ rods) Clostridium botulinum causes a rapidly fatal food poisoning by release of a neurotoxin that blocks release of Ach from presynaptic terminals flaacid paralysis o Adults smoked fish or home canned veggies are common culprits. If foods are improperly cooked, spores may survive germinate in anaerobic environment (e.g. sealed cans or zip bags) release neurotoxin into the food Presentation = bilateral cranial nn palsies, diplopia, dysphagia, weakness, resp paralysis. Ventilatory support often needed. Antitoxin is given. o Infants honey containing spores is often the culprit. Constipation for 2-3days dysphagia and weakness floppy baby Antitoxin usu not necessary. Hospitalization required Clostridium tetani follows skin trauma by object contaminated with spores (usu found in soil and animal feces). Spores germinate in anaerobic environment release of tetanospasmin (tetanus toxin) toxin inhibits inhibitory neurons in the CNS (e.g. Renshaw cells) release of GABA and glycine hyperstimulation of skeletal mm. titanic contraction = paralysis o Presentation spasms, trismus (lockjaw), risus sardonicus (grinning expression) o Mortality high if trismus is present o Prophylaxis formalin-inactivated toxin (tetanus toxoid) stimulates formation of Abs against tetanus toxin. Boosters given every ten years or following trauma. Tetanus toxoid - component of DPT shot If trauma patient hasn&apos;t been immunized, human tetanus immunoglobulins must be given in addition to tetanus toxoid injection. Pcn helps clear any residual toxin producing organisms Clostridium perfringens spores found in soil. Germinate in anaerobic environment. Spores contaminate deep wounds gas gangrene o Cellulites palpation reveals tissue crepitus o Myonecrosis mm destruction. Pockets of gas evident in mm on CT. Thin, blackish fluid exudes from skin as mm are degraded. Tx = Hyperbaric O 2, pcn, and excision of necrotic tissue. Clostridium difficile cz of pseudomembranous colitis (can follow use of broad spectrum abx that wipe out GI flora). o Exotoxins toxin A = diarrhea; toxin B = cytotoxic to colonic mucosa o Presentation = diarrhea, abd cramping, fever. Red inflamed colonic mucosa with areas of white exudate (pseudomembranes) seen on colonoscopy. o Dx made by identification of toxin in the stool o Tx metronidazole or vancomycin (both drugs stay in the GI tract and dont enter the bloodstream. This is ideal for treating C. difficile.) o
Corynebacterium diptheriae colonizes pharynx grayish pseudomembrane release of exotoxin into
bloodstream targets heart and neural cells Pseudomembrane should not be scraped. Bleeding can facilitate systemic absorption of lethal exotoxin Cultured on potassium tellurite agar and Loefflers coagulated blood serum Tx antitoxin (neutralizes circulating toxin), Pcn or erythromycin, DPT vaccine (contains formalin inactivated diptheria toxin) TQ exotoxin is acquired via lysogenic conversion Exotoxin B sub-unit binds. A sub-unit inhibits EF2, which results in the inhibition of protein synthesis
Listeria monocytogenes has endotoxin (for the third time). Facultative intracellular pathogen
 Tropism for nervous tissue Causes meningitis in neonates and the immunocompromised (third most common cz of meningitis in babies&lt;3mos, next to group B strep and E. coli) o These groups have compromised cell-mediated immunity, which is required to fight off facultative intracellular pathogens Can affect pregos may have meningitis or be asymptomatic carriers. Neisseria the only pathogenic G- coccus (diplococcus) Neisseria meningiditis czes meningitis and meningococcemia. Aka meningococcus. o Capsule meningitis is caused by strains with capsule serotypes A,B and C o Endotoxin czes blood vessel destruction and sepsis. Responsible for classic clue to invasive meningococcal infection petechial rash. Mediates adrenal hemorrhage. o IgA1 protease only found in pathogenic Neisseria. Cleaves IgA in half o Organism usu present as normal nasopharyngeal flora o High risk groups = infants 6mos-2yrs and Army recruits o Spreads via respiratory secretions o Meningococcemia spiking fever, chills, arthralgias, myalgia, petechial rash o Fulminant meningococcemia (Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome) septic shock = hypotension, tachycardia and DIC. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage adrenal insuff. Death occurs rapidly. Petechial rash usu present. o Meningitis signs incl bulging open anterior fontanelle in neonates (usu no nuchal rigidity). Older kids may present with nuchal rigidity, Kernigs and Brudzinskis signs. (NOTE: Putthoff emphasizes that infants will NOT have nuchal rigidity. This differs from what the textbook insinuates) o Dx G stain and culture Thayer Martin VCN media Vancomycin kills G+ organisms Colistin kills all G- organisms except Neisseria Nystatin - kills fungi Meningiditis can produce acid from maltose. Gonorrhoeae cannot o Tx pen G or ceftriaxone. Contacts should receive prophylactic rifampin. Neisseria gonorrhoeae second most common STD (next to Chlamydia). Aka gonococcus. o Pili involved in adherence to host cells. Hypervariable aa seq, so no vax avail. o Protein II outer membrane protein involved in adherence. o - urethritis painful urination with purulent discharge. Can epididymitis, prostatitis, urethral strictures Some affected men are asymptomatic, but can still transmit to partners Ceftriaxone curative o - urethritis more likely to be asymp in women. Cervix is reddened and friable Sx dyspareunia, lower abd pain, purulent vaginal discharge can progress to PID = infection of uterus (endometritis), fallopian tubes (salpingitis), and/or ovaries (oophoritis). Presentation = fever, cervical motion tenderness, abn menstruation Menstruation facilitates spread of organisms to upper GU tract Sterility usu czed by scarring of fallopian tubes Ectopic pregnancy salpingitis greatly increases risk. Scarring of tubes impedes transport of conceptus down the GU tract. Abscesses, peritonitis Perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome) gonococcal infection of liver capsule. Presentation = RUQ pain and tenderness. Also seen with Chlamydial infections. o Gonococcal bacteremia fever, arthralgias, skin lesions. Pericarditis, endocarditis, meningitis can occur
Septic arthritis gonococcus is the most common cz in young sexually active individuals Red, swollen, hot joint synovial aspirate reveals WBCs and G stain reveals Gdiplococci within WBCS. o Infants opthalmia neonatorum can be acquired during delivery if mother has gonococcal infection. This can cause blindness if left untreated. Erythromycin (TQ) is used to cover both gonococcus and Chlamydia. o Tx gonorrhea is treated with ceftriaxone. If patient is allergic to cephalosporins, spectinomycin or ciprofloxacin can be used. Doxycycline or azithromycin is often also given to cover Chlamydia (50% of pts will be concurrently infected with Chlamydia) Branhamella catarrhalis czes respiratory infections esp in those with lung dz. Produces beta-lactamase. o The Enterics for USMLE, you must know which organisms are motile, ferment lac and prod H2S Biochemical stuff E. coli ferments lactose. Shigella, Salmonella and Pseudomonas do NOT ferment lactose. EMB agar lactose fermenters are deep purple to black. E. coli have green metallic sheen MacConkey agar lactose fermenters develop pink-purple coloration O antigen outermost component of LPS K antigen capsule antigen H antigen flagella antigen Escherichia coli normal flora that can undergo DNA change (conjugation, etc.) gain virulence factors cause disease. Diarrhea 5 million kids die of E. coli diarrhea per year worldwide. Travelers diarrhea (Montezumas revenge) affects individuals from developed world visiting developing countries. o Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) Has pili (colonization factor) Releases toxins similar to cholera exotoxins inhibit Na and Cl resorption osmotic diarrhea (H2O and electrolyte loss). No fever LT heat labile toxin, similar to cholera toxin ST heat stable toxin Stool looks like rice water, just like cholera o Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) Has pili Secretes shiga-like toxin (veratoxin) inhibits 60S ribosome intestinal epithelial cell death bloody diarrhea and severe abd cramps Called hemorrhagic colitis o Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure E. coli 0157:H7 is cause (TQ) o Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) same dz as that czed by Shigella Plasmid shared b/w E. coli and Shigella Shiga toxin inhibits 60S ribosome Bacteria invade intestinal epithelial cells inflamm. rxn fever Diarrhea (inflamed mucosa cant resorb) is bloody with WBCs, like shigellosis UTIs pili gives organism ability to travel up urethra cystitis, pyelonephritis, etc. o E. coli is most common cz of UTIs o Sx = dysuria, frequency, urgency, fullness Second most common cause of neonatal meningitis (remember others??, better know them) Most common cause of gram negative sepsis Common cz of nosocomial pneumonia Klebsiella pneumoniae encapsulated, non-motile (no K antigen) Second most common cause of gram negative sepsis Causes pneumonia in alcoholics and hospitalized pts. Sputum looks like red currant jelly (TQ) Proteus mirabilis very motile. Common cause of UTIs and nosocomial infections. Urea splitting organisms splits urea to CO2 and NH3 increases pH of urine promotes microbial growth UTI Enterobacter highly motile. Normal flora.

Mechanism of T-cell death CD4 receptor is involved because helper cells are affected the most dramatically Gp160 is integrated into host membrane virion buds at gp160 and binds to adjacent CD4 receptors tears helper cell membrane Gp160 also binds to CD4 on adjacent cells cell: cell fusion o Multinucleate giant cells virus can pass between fused Tcells and is protected from circulating Abs. Gp160 may be trigger for destruction of CD4 cell by CD8 cells Polyclonal activation of B-cells outpouring of Igs immune complex formation and auto-Ab production ability to mount Ab response against new Ag. Monos and macs also CD4+, but CD4 isnt as dense (so these cell types arent affected as adversely as T-helper cells) monos and macs serve as reservoirs for HIV, thus protecting it from circulating Abs, etc. Dx p24 detected in blood within weeks of infection.
