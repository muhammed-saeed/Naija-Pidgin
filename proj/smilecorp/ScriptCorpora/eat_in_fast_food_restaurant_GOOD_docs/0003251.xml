A teenager can learn many valuable skills when working in a fast-food restaurant. These skills can be used when looking for new work or in other careers they may choose later on in life.

Teamwork

A fast-food restaurant is essentially an assembly-line and in this environment a teenager learns how to work with a team. They need to pay attention to their team members and superiors and do the tasks needed to get the food out in a timely manner. This is a valuable skill when applied to other jobs they may do in life.
 
Value of Money

Working in this environment where salaries are low, teaches a teenager the value of a hard-earned dollar. They learn how to save money. Teens also learn that hard work and dedication to their duties can help them buy the things they want. They may gain a new respect for money.

Communication Skills

A teenager also has to listen closely to customers and process their orders quickly and efficiently. The fast-paced work environment leaves little room for careless errors. They learn to listen and process large volumes of information thrown at them all day long. They learn to follow orders and how to do multiple tasks. Communication skills help them resolve conflicts with fellow employees and with customers. They deal with the public on a daily basis and proper communication is important.

Responsibility

Teenagers learn that they need to show up on time and work hard throughout the day. Equipment must be maintained, and food safety procedures must be followed. These responsibilities help them with the transition into adulthood. They have to do certain tasks in a timely and efficient manner to get paid. If they are not responsible they can be fired.

Self Image

A teenager learns the value of a positive self image. They need to keep themselves clean. They learn how to clean up after themselves and others. Teens with low self esteem may gain a new respect for themselves with this type of job. It may bring them a sense of pride.

Criticism and Authority

As an employee teenagers can learn how to deal with authority figures like managers and to take criticism which can help them improve. If they are good enough and can handle the pressure thrown at them by managers, they can be promoted to leadership roles. They may learn to manage anger more constructively after being yelled at. By taking this criticism they may work harder and may become more self disciplined.

Time Management

Teenagers learn how to budget and plan activities around their work schedules. This may including getting up early on weekends or working on holidays. Since they are getting paid they may become less lazy and value their time.

Teenagers can learn how to communicate, the value of money, teamwork, responsibility, self image, time management and how to handle authority when employed in a fast-food restaurant. These skills are important life skills for any young person.
