Fast Food: Febo
 
 Helpfulness
 Rachael71   227 reviews 
You will see Febo shops everywhere in Amsterdam, and eventually the urge to put a Euro in the slot and take a piece of food out will prove too much. Honestly, take our word for it - it&apos;s not worth it! Think of all the other things you coould do with that euro! 30 seconds after this picture was taken, the food was in the bin. We had thought it was some kind of beef croquette, but my boyfriend thought it was more likely to be solidified pea soup, deep-fried in batter. We&apos;re in no rush to try a Febo again anyway - now don&apos;t say we didn&apos;t warn you!

Fast Food: Try It
 vickss   113 reviews 
One must try FEBOs the local fast food chain which has this futuristic coin operated burger and sandwich pop ups. Prices re almost the same as in McDonalds a lil less actuall and the taste is fine. It is specially recommended for backpackers. But otherwise also its a fine plce for fast food lovers.
One problem though with it is the intruction and dish names are in Dutch language and people are not that helpful if you ask what the hell does this mean and that mean etc.
Infact in this respect McD beats it hollow.
Further, for people not used to too automated a world might like to try the age old McDonalds personalised service

Febo: Febo is a fast food experience
 
 Helpfulness
 cwest03   370 reviews 
You have to be drunk, stoned or curious to want to eat at Febo. This vending machine style fast food restaurant is not for the weak stomach. There are many selections of which I have tried the &apos;hamburger&apos; and the chicken sandwich. I didn&apos;t have the stomach to try the other mysterious fried delights. The food selection process is quite unique as you insert money, open the small door and remove your hot meal. Locations are available throughout the city as well as the Netherlands in general. Also keep your eye out for Febo impostors. I&apos;m not sure how they stack up against the original.

 Favorite Dish: I&apos;d have to say the chicken sandwich is my favorite.

I have to say that the febo(?) vending stores were my absolute favorite. What a trip to have a room full of nothing but little window vending areas, put in some money and get anything you want. I don&apos;t remeber the food, but hey, this is an experience.

 Helpfulness
 zizquark   182 reviews 
There are little automats called FEBO around the city. A FEBO looks like the wall of PO boxes at the post office, except that the doors are transparent, and there are coin slots instead of keyholes. FEBO employees are hidden behind the wall of tiny clear cubicles, busily preparing tasty FEBO treats. Although there are a large number of tiny compartments at a FEBO, it&apos;s hard to tell if there is any difference in their contents. Each one simply contains something small, breaded, deep-fat-fried, and unidentifiable looking somewhat like a large eggroll. The up-side is that it doesn&apos;t cost much to eat at a FEBO; for a couple of guilders, you can slide open the door to reveal a scrumptious &apos;broodje mit kass&apos; (whatever that means). They&apos;re also open 24 hours a day. Great after a night of drinking.

Febo - pronounced Faybo: Food from the wall
 
 Helpfulness
 TrekknHil   44 reviews 
If you like your food cheap, greasy and on the run, Febo is for you.

Do not attempt if you treasure your stomach or do not have the intestinal fortitute needed to eat food from a wall.
