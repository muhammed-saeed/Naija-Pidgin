SUBWAY!
the place to hit for a quick, fast, &quot;healthy&quot;, delicious, fulling meal!

caution: don&apos;t get the &quot;chicken breast&quot;.. it came out to be HALF of the footlong sandwich&amp;didn&apos;t even taste like chicken. i&apos;m still wondering what they gave me...

recommend: MEATBALL MARINARA FOOTLONG SUB! mmmmm.... but if you&apos;re thinking healthy, this is probably the worst choice. you might as well head to taco bell, burger king, or panda express that&apos;s just a few feet away.

if you want healthy&amp;delicious, go for the:
- turkey footlong: they give a generous amount of turkey&amp;toppings, just not the salad (iceberg lettuce) part. you can actually order this w/o any condiments/sauces because it still tastes incredibly good (AND FRESH!)
- sweet onion teriyaki chicken: mmmm, you can&apos;t go wrong on this order. just simply delicious&amp;you still feel the &quot;healthy&quot; part of it.

they open at 7 am so it&apos;s a great place to go for a quick meal on-the-go if you&apos;re in a rush or all the other restaurants are closed. they have tables outside if you can&apos;t wait to devour your sub. i don&apos;t blame you, after watching your meal being made in front of you, you&apos;re almost on the verge to ask the employee to just give you the sandwich rather than go through the trouble of wrapping it up all nicely.

healthy? most items aren&apos;t. fact is, most people come here ordering subs that are higher in calories than a whopper at burger king. so their whole slogan of eating healthy&amp;losing weight isn&apos;t true.. unless if you order their wrap. and only eat that for the whole day.

their slogan &quot;eat fresh&quot; is definitely true. all their ingredients are really fresh. i was actually suprised because i&apos;d expected some skimpy pieces of lettuce or fake meat or decaying tomatoes because it is a fast food joint, but noooo. subway proved me wrong. but then still&amp;again, don&apos;t order the chicken patty. ew.
everything else was..

fresh&amp;delish!

edit//
don&apos;t try ordering the 6&quot;. if you&apos;re like me, that is not even close to filling me up. i keep whining for more. do yourself the favor&amp;order the footlong! heck, order two footlongs!!

inside: very clean for a fast food restaurant, a few tables&amp;chairs, a soda machine w/ plenty of choices to choose from, a display of different meats, condiments, cookies, toppings, and breads, an oven behind the cash register, and  a life-size cardboard photo of Jared Fogle.

My disappointment with this Subway was in the selection of $5 footlongs. Each Subway gets to pick which sub they will carry. Unfortunately, this one neither carries the seafood sensation nor does it have it in the $5 footlong menu. I had to spend my hard $5 bucks and an extra 1 for the Tuna. Sigh.

Otherwise Subway in general are my favorite.

Almost always busy.  Beware lunch time rush when high school is in session.  Craziness!

after a disappointing lunch at the belmont brewery, the boyfriend and i were still starving. we lingered around my apartment contemplating on what to eat next since we were already starving. taco bell? nah... not in the mood for super crap. mcdonalds? nah, i dont want to die. sit down dinner? hell no, i&apos;m completely burnt to a crisp and have the worst farmers tan in the world. theres no way im sitting down somewhere. subway? YES!!! subway! i&apos;m down!
we decided on the meatball sub at subway. busy bee is closed on sundays, so the nearest meatball sub that we could find was subway. it was absolutely glorious! the guy put on a gagillion meatballs. i think he just didnt care anymore as it was getting near closing time. he piled on the provoloan and sauce and made me one happy camper. i devoured the foot long sub and relished in the meatballness. sooo happy. thank you, subway, for making my tummy happy :)

No restroom and no sink available for the customers to wash hands.  They do provide wet wipes but I prefer to wash my hands before eating.  Pavilion&apos;s grocery is several doors down and has restrooms.  I have noticed that many other Subways also have this issue.  How can a national eatery get away with this?    The service and food are fine and the place is clean.
