Scrantonicity ~“Classy Christmas”

By Bob 
 Tuesday, December 14, 2010 
“Christmas gift suggestions: To your enemy, forgiveness; To an opponent, tolerance; To a friend, your heart; To a customer, service; To all, charity; To every child, a good example. To yourself, respect.” ~ Oren Arnold 

…(ahem)…Since nothing says “Classy Christmas” like boring jazz music, I decided to make this a “Classy Scrantonicity” by starting things off with a deep, meaningful seasonal quotation. As the column progresses, we’ll more than likely degenerate into the usual lurid tales…the middle school teacher and the foreign exchange student sex slave…the post office guy rubbing lasciviously against the mail…characters with a “Woody”…but at least the first paragraph had a classy start.

The cold opening features the whole Dunder-Mifflin gang shivering in the parking lot, posing for a group photograph. The trash can to the left has a sign on it that says “Gumout.” Hmm…an automotive fuel injector cleaner…not particularly “Scranton-y,” but a Google search produced “Gumout ~ A Pennzoil product.” OK, that works for me: “Pennzoil,” Scranton, Pennz ylvania…I see the connection! 

Fortunately, there were lots of legitimate local sightings, too. The office whiteboard calendar reminds everyone that the Scranton Chamber of Commerce Christmas luncheon will be held at Cooper’s Seafood, only about the 500th time that restaurant has been name-checked on the show. On the wall behind Kevin’s cubicle, we see a copy of The Weekender , “Northeastern Pennsylvania’s #1 Arts Entertainment Weekly.” On his desk, we see Kevin’s beloved bobblehead in the Scranton Miners football uniform. The “M” logo very closely resembles the Missouri Tigers, as LITO reader Ryan pointed out, but there is a “pick” chipping away at the “M.” (Miners…get it?) Also, Kevin is drinking from a coffee mug decorated with a person’s name in kelly green lettering…“Pat”…something or other. “Pat’s” last name is so far out of the picture frame that I can’t make it out, and it is driving me nuts. Hmm…kelly green lettering…could it be Saint Pat? That is a huge holiday in Scranton. I actually searched “ Cute Saint Patricks Day mugs ”but I haven’t found the pot o’ gold yet.

Another sighting was the Scranton Printing calendar, with the distinct “SP” logo, on the wall behind Gabe Lewis’ desk. A missed opportunity was when Michael “re-gifted” his “Hello Kitty” laptop cover to Kelly. He said he got it at the “mall.” On The Office, usually that means “Steamtown Mall,” located downtown. Curiously, the show has never referenced the rival shopping center: the Viewmont Mall , off Route 6 in nearby Dickson City. Michael’s mother supposedly lives in Dickson City; you think he’d be there once in a while. And when Kelly scrutinized the receipt from Michael’s wallet, she said it was from a generic “fast food restaurant.” Another missed opportunity! There are dozens of fun-sounding local eateries that would given that scene a “tangy zip.” At the very least, the receipt should have been from Sbarro’s Pizza, which would have made true Office fans smile at the inside joke.

But I don’t wanna sound like a grinch here. I was thrilled with the efforts of the prop department for the all realistic “snow” scenes. I complained about last week’s episode looking so unseasonably warm, and then I noted Creed reading the the Scranton Times-Tribune, with the headline “Cold blast coming.” Well, you can’t say they didn’t warn us. Not only did the snow look totally realistic, but the sky appeared to be digitally altered in this episode. It was gray and clammy, and had just the right east coast “winter chill” to it. I hope to read more about how they accomplished this illusion. Here is a website devoted to Hollywood snow scenes ; maybe they are responsible for the Dunder-Mifflin Winter Dunder-Wonderland.

The Scranton Strangler was featured in this episode, but only marginally…because as a juror, Toby is not allowed to discuss him. Since it was revealed that the dastardly evil-doer lived just four blocks from where I grew up , I have high hopes for future revelations. By the way, I got a kick out of seeing Toby at the Dunder-Mifflin Christmas party. He was on lunch recess break from the Lackawanna County Courthouse, which is about a mile away from the office, and he is shown at the party with a martini glass in his hand! Well, I guess there’s nothing like a cocktail to take the edge off a tense criminal trial.

Kind of a neat coincidence here: In Pam’s comic book “The Adventures Of Jimmy Halpert,” the hero is bitten by a bear. According to the Scranton Times website, a black bear was just spotted roaming through my wife Ann’s hometown streets of Jermyn, Pa. That’s a pretty rare occurence; usually, this only happens with, uh… radioactive bears! 

Finally, since this is a “Classy Scrantonicity,” we are going finish by following up on the Dunde-Mifflin Christmas Grinch’s wildly inappropriate quiz question to Jada: “How many members of congress are guaranteed to the state of Pennsylvania?” The answer is one member of congress for every 650,000 residents, same as most other states. (The exceptions being the seven states with less than 650,000 in population, which are each allotted one congressperson.)…(ahem)…Now is that a classy ending, or what?

Great job Bob. I just love your creative classy Scrantonicity columns. The radioactive bear would have been a better fit for Dwight, don’t you think? But I liked Pam’s gift to Jim anyway; sweet and personal. Even though I don’t think that the drawing really looked like Jim. I think Dwight and Phyllis looked more realistic.

You can see the whole comic (only a place holder) at NBC.com by clicking here .

You’re right as usual Bob. This episode could have been packed with local stuff, but once again they Scruted it.

I did see some Utz and Herrs snacks when Jada was passing out the vending machine goodies.

I also did a little Googling around (insomnia) to maybe find out what mug Kevin was drinking out of. Not positive this is it, but there is a Pat McMullen’s restaurant in downtown Scranton. I found no web site or even a logo to go with my find though. So…maybe?

I have a new found respect for your Scranton snooping skills. It took me 20 minutes to just find a possible link to Kevin’s mug and I had to freeze frame the episode…alot! I’m sure you must do this multiple times for every episode. Thanks for all your efforts!! We here at LITO really do appreciate it!

Donna’s right, we really do appreciate your efforts , Bob,’cause I NEVER see the stuff you pick up on. When I watch, it just never occurs to me to look for stuff. But that’s probably a good thing; the show has created their own universe so realistically that nothing is glaring/ It all fits. It looks like an office with boxes and stuff all over the place. It truly feels like people work there. I’m just glad we have a local who can spot all these cool little things that they put in. Cool. And Classy!

Thanks for the nice comments! I’m glad you guys like having another angle of the show to appreciate.

Suri, you’re right.“Pam”really captured Dwight and Phyllis in the comic book. It’s fun picturing her sitting at her Dunder-Mifflin desk, sneaking sketches of her co-workers!

Donna, thanks for finding Pat McMullen’s. I never heard of the place, and it is located about one mile from the house I grew up in. And I can’t believe THIS: In my“Scrantonicity”notes, I scribbled“Jada–Utz snacks.”And then I FORGOT to put it in the final draft! Thanks for picking that out, too!

Kevin, the show really HAS created its own little universe, didn’t it? I LOVE the fact that there are so many“levels”to it. A LOT of creative minds got on the same page for this show!
