Mamma Mia! Fresh Italian Lasagne! SERVES

This is my recipe for vegetarian lasagne... and it&apos;s as decadent as it is delicious! Yes, it&apos;s a bit time-consuming to make -- and I don&apos;t care. I love the quality results, and that&apos;s what matters the most for me and my family. I recommend you make this when you really have the time to make it right... and reap the wonderful rewards! The fresh Italian sauce is superb. I use traditional, Old-World ingredients like red wine, fresh herbs and cheese, except I prefer not to simmer it over one hour, to preserve that great fresh flavor. Like my other&quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;recipes, this mouthwatering Italian dish is sure to be a favorite at your family table.

Preparation of Mamma Mia! Fresh Italian Lasagne!:
 
 SAUTE the following ingredients of the FRESH ITALIAN SAUCE in a large saucepan or pot between medium and medium-low heat in 1 tablespoon olive oil (about 7 minutes): 1 medium chopped onion, 8 ounces thinly sliced fresh mushrooms, 3 tablespoons minced fresh garlic, 3 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley, 2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano leaves, and 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary leaves. ADD the following FRESH ITALIAN SAUCE ingredients to the SAUTE ingredients: 3 1/4 cups blanched diced fresh Roma tomatoes (cored and skins removed, or one 28 oz can diced tomatoes), 3 1/4 cups blanched pureed fresh Roma tomatoes (cored and skins removed) or one 28 oz can tomato sauce), 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon ground fennel, 1/4 cup dry red wine, 2 teaspoons fine sea salt (if using fresh tomatoes), 3/4 teaspoon fresh lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper; STIR in enough sugar or light corn syrup into SAUCE to balance acidity (I usually add 4 tablespoons light corn syrup, but use your own estimation with either); RAISE HEAT to HIGH, stirring as needed and bring to BOIL; REDUCE HEAT to MEDIUM-LOW, then SIMMER the sauce uncovered for 1 hour or slightly longer, stirring occasionally; REMOVE the SAUCE from heat; STIR in 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon finely minced fresh basil leaves (to refresh flavor); SEASON to taste with fine sea salt if necessary. PREPARE the FRESH LASAGNE PASTA while sauce is simmering: BEAT 3 eggs with 1 tablespoons olive oil gently in a medium bowl using a fork; into the large bowl of food processor (you may process the fresh spinach for the filling, and the fresh tomato puree for the sauce first, cleaning or wiping processor afterward); MEASURE 1 cup semolina flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 3/8 teaspoon fine sea salt; PROCESS in food processor at least 30 seconds; with processor still running, very slowly POUR beaten eggs into feeder tube until all of the beaten eggs have been added; continue to PROCESS until dough becomes very thick and consistently blended (or when it forms a ball); REMOVE ball of dough from processor; WRAP dough tightly with plastic wrap; LET dough to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. PLACE dough on a smooth clean surface dusted with semolina flour; ROLL out dough to 1/4 inch thick, SPRINKLE with semolina flour and repeat process until dough has a smooth, soft texture and with a balanced moisture level (not overly moist or dry); ROLL dough using a pasta machine (remommended), or a rolling pin to a 1/8 inch thickness, dusting very lightly with semolina flour if necessary, to prevent sticking; cut noodle dough into 2-3 inch width strips, with a 12&quot;length; pasta does not need to be boiled first. IF USING PACKAGED LASAGNE PASTA: MEASURE exactly 4 quarts of water (16 cups) into a large pot of water; BRING water to a full rolling boil; ADD 2 tablespoons kosher salt, then quickly but carefully add dough strips individually; COOK pasta until just tender (al dente), about 7 to 8 minutes; DRAIN lasagne noodles immediately in a large colander; REMOVE pasta individually using tongs and HANG pasta in (and over), the edges of the large pot and the colander to STRAIGHTEN, so that none of the noodles are touching; ALLOW to cool slightly. PREPARE the FRESH PASTA BASTE by mixing 2 tablespoons olive oil with 1-2 cloves freshly pressed garlic (using a garlic press or mincing finely); BASTE lasagne noodles evenly on both sides in a 13 x 9 baking dish; remove and set aside. WHIP the following ingredients of the FRESH SPINACH AND CHEESE FILLING in a large bowl, using an electric mixer: 3 cups whole milk ricotta cheese (Precious brand), 1 large egg, 2/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup cream, 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, 3/8 teaspoon freshly grated lemon peel, 1/4 teaspoon minced fresh garlic (use a garlic press), 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper; FOLD in 1 cup finely chopped fresh spinach leaves and 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil leaves (stems removed), until mixture is thoroughly blended. POUR 1/4 (ONE FOURTH) of the FRESH ITALIAN SAUCE into the bottom of a 13 x 9 baking dish or casserole dish; SPRINKLE 1/4 (TWO TABLESPOONS) of the freshly grated parmesan cheese over the sauce: ARRANGE one layer of FRESH LASAGNE PASTA over the sauce and cheese; SPREAD 1/3 of the FRESH SPINACH AND CHEESE FILLING over the pasta; POUR 1/3 (ONE THIRD) of the remaining SAUCE over the filling; SPRINKLE 1/3 (ONE THIRD) of the remaining freshly grated parmesan cheese over the sauce, followed by 1/3 (THIRD) of the grated part-skim mozzarella cheese; REPEAT layers with FRESH LASAGNE PASTA, then FRESH SPINACH AND CHEESE FILLING, then FRESH ITALIAN SAUCE, then CHEESES (finishing with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese). COVER with aluminum foil or casserole lid. BAKE covered in preheated 350 F degree oven for 30 minutes, then carefully slide out oven tray from oven using oven mitts; REMOVE the cover from dish carefully; then SPRINKLE the GARNISH (1 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon seasoned Italian breadcrumbs and 1 teaspoon finely minced fresh Italian parsley); REMAIN uncovered and continue to BAKE for 15 additional minutes; REMOVE from oven and allow to cool and set for 5-10 minutes,. SLICE (using a serrated knife), SERVE (with your favorite side dishes and bread) and ENJOY!

 Burger King Original Zesty Sauce 
I love Burger King&apos;s Zesty dipping sauce, offered with their onion rings... which used to be somewhat palatable (no further comments about the rapidly diminishing quality and portions of today&apos;s fast food restaurant chains...). On each BK visit, I would routinely purchase additional Zesty sauces so I could take a good supply home with me... until the simple solution came when I opened my last remaining packet...&quot;I can make this myself at home!&quot;... And I did... 
 Simple Shortbread--3 Ingredients 
Take 3 ingredients, mix them together, bake and you have the BEST shortbread you can find. After measuring out the ingredients, it takes THREE minutes to whip this together by hand; whether you use a shortbread pan or make it free-form, it still turns out buttery, flaky and delicious! I&apos;ve been making it this way, unchanged, for over 40 years from my Mum&apos;s recipe. I have no idea who gave it to her or where it&apos;s from; she&apos;d been making it even before I was born in 1952.
