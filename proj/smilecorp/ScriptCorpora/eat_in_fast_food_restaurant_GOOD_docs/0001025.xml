 31 DEC 08: COMPLETE IDIOT&apos;S GUIDE TO KNOWLEDGE 



For several years, we&apos;ve borrowed an idea from BBC News - which lists the things it didn&apos;t know, either last week or last year. In 2008 we learned many things about our area. And when you&apos;re declared &quot;Idiot of the Week&quot; during 2008 not once but twice, you need to learn as much as you can.



So what did we learn in 2008? We think a list of 100 things is a bit bulky, so we&apos;ll offer you 25....


1. Foundations can crumble -- even ones built with money, and not concrete.



We didn&apos;t know this until Tuesday night, when we found out the Tidwell Cancer Foundation is going out of business. It closes its doors today - but at least it resisted the temptation to merge with Columbus Regional.



Virginia McClure with the Tidwell Cancer Foundation told WLTZ the agency needed to become self-supporting, and that didn&apos;t seem possible with the current tight economy. Let&apos;s face it, only so many people in this area need Nicorette patches....



The Tidwell Cancer Treatment Center will remain open. But its marketing staff will be laid off. I&apos;m not sure what this means to the &quot;Tidwell and Friends&quot; TV talk show. Perhaps Eve Tidwell will go back to her old restaurant on 13 th Street, and hand out business cards.



2. If part of the Riverwalk is marked off with orange paint, it probably needs repair. It is NOT a box for setting up water tables for runners.



A couple of orange boxes are marked on the Riverwalk right now, between Rotary Park and RoadAmerica. I jogged in that area Tuesday, and noticed the pavement inside the boxes is cracked and sagging - as if too many football players stopped there to do jumping jacks.



3. Packages of &quot;Christmas candy&quot; tend to have more red-wrapped candies than green ones. But I don&apos;t think that necessarily makes the companies Communist.
