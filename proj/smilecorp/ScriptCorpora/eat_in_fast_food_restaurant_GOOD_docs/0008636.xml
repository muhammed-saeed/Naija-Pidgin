 Description 
   

 
 Shipping Included for Delivery Within the Contiguous 48 States. 

The First Years Carry-Me-Near 5-in-1 Sleep System is a portable sleeper, bassinet, bedside sleeper, play seat and changing table all in one convenient product! The three sleep modes allow you to keep your sleeping baby close to you wherever you go. Thanks to the ergonomically-designed handle, you can confidently carry your sleeping baby from room to room in the Portable Sleeper.

Built directly into the handle are battery-operated gentle vibrations, five peaceful audio selections and a nightlight. You can also put your baby down in the full-sized bassinet that features a sturdy base that you can rock back and forth or lock into place.

For added convenience, you can easily convert the bassinet into a bedside sleeper that securely attaches to the adult bed, allowing you to feed and comfort your baby without having to get out of bed.

When you need to change your baby&apos;s diaper in the middle of the night, our easy-to-clean, vinyl-covered changing table offers a separate surface from the sleep area. And when you just want a secure, comfortable place for your young baby to play, the portable sleeper becomes a playseat complete with fun plush characters that dangle from the canopy.


 Delivery - within 2 weeks.
