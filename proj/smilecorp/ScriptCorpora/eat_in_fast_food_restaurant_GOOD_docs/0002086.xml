NAVIGON 2510 Explorer Europe 23

 NAVIGON 2510 Explorer: the navigation device to ensure you reach your destination safely 
Our new navigation device, the NAVIGON 2510 Explorer, is a navigation device that will not only get you from A to B, but also has many NAVIGON functions that we offer with just one goal in mind: ensuring that you have a safe journey and arrive relaxed–not just in your car.
 

 Explore your surroundings on foot with the NAVIGON 2510 Explorer 
Pedestrian navigation and NAVIGON Last Mile will also get you to your destination quickly when you are travelling on foot. Meaning that you’ll always be heading in the right direction. And if the journey is the destination, NAVIGON Sightseeing inspired by MERIAN scout will enable you to explore lots of exciting sights on your route. The NAVIGON 2510 Explorer–a navigation device for (almost) any situation!
 
NAVIGON MyBest POI

Your three favourite points of interest, always at a glance: with the NAVIGON MyBest POIs function, you can choose your three favourite points-of-interest categories and see how far away you are from these POIs at the top of the display screen. So you’ll always know exactly how far away the nearest filling station or your favourite fast food restaurant is on your route. Or the nearest cinema or hotel. You decide what is displayed based on your individual requirements!

NAVIGON Sightseeing

Who says that a navigation device only has to get you from A to B? Sometimes, the journey itself can be the destination. NAVIGON Sightseeing inspired by MERIAN scout provides you with information on interesting sights on your route on your display screen–including via speech output, and you can choose to be navigated to them directly if you wish. This creates both a direct and eventful journey from A via B and C to D. Become an explorer!

NAVIGON Last Mile

NAVIGON guides you the last few metres of your journey after parking, all the way to your actual destination. It will even find your car for you on the way back.
