The &quot;King of Health Foods&quot; is alive...and making a
 comeback.

By Anne Vassal

 Add a handful of sprouts to your favorite
 vegetable dishes;
they&apos;re a lot more healthful than using highfat
 nuts—and
tasty, too! 

Sprouts? Disgusting! You&apos;re turning the page at
 record-breaking speed and who can blame you? An image of
 tasteless vegetation emerging from your sandwich springs to
 mind. Your favorite fast-food restaurant has probably
 attempted to give your sandwich a &quot;healthy&quot; appearance,
 forcing you to yell &quot;Hold the sprouts!&quot; before they throw
 it on your tray. After all, only health-food fanatics can
 faithfully consume this food with any enthusiasm, right?

Maybe not. In the health-conscious and low-fat nineties,
 sprouts are making a subtle comeback—and with good
 reason. They&apos;re rich in essential vitamins and minerals,
 low in calories and fat, and high in dietary fiber. They
 are also inexpensive, especially if you decide to grow your
 own. Sprouts are a &quot;live&quot; food, and easy to grow indoors
 during the winter months. Flavorful new varieties, such as
 radish and onion sprouts, are now available (fresh or in
 seed form) at your local grocery or health-food store,
 causing the old alfalfa sprout to take a backseat.

So how did the sprout obtain its &quot;King of Health Foods&quot;
 status? Every seed contains the embryo of a future plant
 and the nutrients needed to nourish its growth. When the
 seed (or bean) germinates, it releases these nutrients into
 the resulting sprout. In the course of its sprouting, the
 seed uses up some of its stored carbohydrates and fat, adds
 water, and manufactures some vitamins and minerals. You
 wind up with a reduced-calorie food that is still rich in
 protein, containing more nutrients than the original seed.
 For example, the vitamin C in both soybeans and gar-banzo
 beans increases from a mere trace during sprouting, until
 the soybean sprouts are as rich in vitamin C as tomatoes.
 Wheat berries have three times more vitamin E and six times
 more of some B vitamins after they&apos;ve sprouted. They also
 contain Super Oxide Dimutase, Dimutases are a class of
 proteins having the common feature of being antioxidants,
 which removepoisons from the body and aid the remission of
 aging symptoms.
