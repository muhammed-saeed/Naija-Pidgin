Yogurt....best if you use a plain yogurt, - Greek is great! then Flavour it yourself with berries, mango, banana&apos;s etc...
Try to buy yogurt with no ingredients other than bacterial culture....NO sugar, NO additives.
We eat all of our foods with no flour, gluten free, no sugar, and only whole grains. NO additives, nothing we cannot pronounce. NO preservatives...it is difficult to find some foods, but well worth it! This type of eating is more expensive, but you have much more energy, and can actually help heal things such as endometriosis, and some other ailments.
Choose a pasta made from Spelt (ancient grain) even instead of whole wheat....Use things like unrefined cane sugar.

@ AM....Lets not get so picky! Although they are showing whole flax seeds, they are describing it perfectly. For those who do not know what a flax seed is...the photo works very well. It does mention in the article to use &quot;ground flaxseed&quot;
You can also use Omega Crunch Flax seed which is very tasty. It is actually the shell of the seed that is difficult to digest. Omega Crunch removes the outer shell making the flax seed easy to digest the oil. This means no grinding, great tasting, easy to use, all natural flavours! We use both the Maple and the Garlic Omega Crunch on Oatmeal, Pasta (Spelt Pasta is best)...rice...almost anything!!! ANyone who has not tried it yet...should!! We saw it advertised on Dragon&apos;s Den, ordered it right away, and LOVE it!

The photos you show do not properly represent the foods described. Flax seed should be ground to get the most benefits from it. Whole flaxseed (as shown) can not be properly digested and will pass right through the system.
Yogurt should be natural and unflavoured. The yogurt you show is flavoured, which increases the sugar content significantly thereby reducing the goodness of the food itself.

I have been trying to determine what is a healthy diet. The list is good with only one exception. I would substitute eggs for beans. Beans are high in carbohydrates and are hard to digest. Also cholesterol does not cause clogged arteries. My understanding is that small dense lipoproteins (sdLDL) and oxidised LDL from glucose and fructose in the diet is the cause of heart disease. Therefore following a low fat/high carbohydrate diet (Canada Food Guide) might not be a healthy way to eat. The cholesterol theory of heart disease has been abandoned but the notion still persists.
