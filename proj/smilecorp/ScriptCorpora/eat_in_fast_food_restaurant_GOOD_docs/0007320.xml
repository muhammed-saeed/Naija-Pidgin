Kane Steakhouse Has Closed UPDATED

 Empty seats last night at Kane, and maybe for good. 
​ The lights were out at Kane Steakhouse last night. The front door was 
locked. Through the tinted windows, stools could be seen 
flipped upside down on the bar.

Earlier in the afternoon, cooks were spotted walking down Washington Avenue wondering what to make of the sudden closing. They told the valet attendant, who attends to La Locanda and the Dining Room as well, that they were sent home without jobs. Rumors were quickly spreading on the block. Some said that Kane is simply closed for a couple of weeks and will return. Others said this is the end.

 Update: Vanessa Menkes, senior vice president of communications with the Opium Group, confirmed Kane&apos;s closing, issuing the following statement: &quot;Kane Steakhouse has closed. An exciting new concept will be opening in the space very soon.&quot;
 
If this is indeed the end of Kane, it isn&apos;t as if we didn&apos;t see it coming. For months, the restaurant has employed bored staff staring at the few tables they&apos;ve been receiving on a nightly basis. Just last month, executive chef Daniel Ganem was fired . That turmoil comes within the first five months of existence.

A phone call was placed to Kane yesterday. It rang, offering nothing more than a recording of the hours of operation. Trying to book a reservation on my iPhone&apos;s OpenTable application, the error &quot;We are currently unable to connect to Kane Steakhouse&quot; was spit out. On OpenTable&apos;s website , Kane Steakhouse doesn&apos;t appear as available any longer.

This place was a joke! I never saw it going anywhere! The owners were definitely scum bags! I&apos;m glad it&apos;s closed, but I feel for the employees that were there!
 
The fashionable parka jacket is built from synthetic resources and zips up the entrance for closure. Down-filled parkas are presently the norm, but synthetic fills might also be really warm along with a lot additional animal friendly for you vegans obtainable. Basically, Canada Goose Parka style has remained exactly the same together using the exception of front zip closure, along with the use of breathable, fast-wicking water-proof outer supplies. Inuit persons nowadays now hardly ever don the classic caribou skin parkas in favor of the modern day equivalent.If you have soaked your&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadagoosesuper.com/&quot;&gt;Canada Goose&lt;/a&gt;Trillium Parka, take out and use towels to pat dry.

Originally,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadagoosesuper.com/Canada-Goose-Mens-Parka-C3.htm&quot;&gt;Canada Goose Mens parka&lt;/a&gt;Discount had been worn by the Inuit too as other Arctic peoples. The normal parka layout is the fact is “a pullover model outer garment built from caribou skin getting a fur lining around the hood”. The notion becoming that if animals could remain warm, humans could put on their skins and remain hot also, even in likely by far by far the most inhospitable conditions.Do not forget the camera so you are able to preserve the memories of your gorgeous tiny girl’s perfect wedding dress forever!

love u lela!!! michael
 
I&apos;m glad they closed, I worked there as well, I was one of the many that saw the bullshit hitting the fan and got the f*** out of there. Justin Levine tries to act cool but he is a coward, would never be straightfoward or even talk to us. Roman is a joke, enough said. Matthew, needs to stop being a cheap fuck like the rest of them. They left us in the cold, after a meeting the week before BEGGING us to stay. I&apos;m so glad I am gone from them and their whores!
 
You go girl
 
Food was terrible there.  Service should have been a lot better.
 
You are really an idiot.
 
They owe everybody money!  Employees were sent home being told their checks were in the mail.  The construction company is suing them for 110,000, they are several months behind on rent. some purveyors have put them into the collections department while they were on COD with most others,  when they ran up a tab they would just switch companies.  These people are the worst kind of scumbags while they sit on millions and use the working man as a pawn.
 
Ohhh and they owe us money I hope they plan on paying.
 
First off, I delivered there, and was shock to hear of the closing, as no one was in contact with me about it. Second off, no matter what they make of it, if it is run under the same owners, its going to be run into the ground. Get it together people, if they couldn&apos;t even run a restaurant what makes you think they can run a successful club? Its a joke. To just tell everyone basically get out you&apos;re fired. Cmon! Economy sucks we get that, at LEAST give people notice, what kind of owner is that?! I can tell you this, I will NEVER go to that club and I will make SURE to tell everyone NEVER to go there. They wanna screw over the chefs? Watch me ruin them.

making the staff wait on&quot;models&quot;on tuesday, and then monday nights, for beggar&apos;s pay!!! ridiculous!! u r right, i think there was lots of sabotage. and just outright arrogance. Roman Jones would keep the staff late, just so he could come in and show off and have a salad. so ignorant, he would bother the staff for stuff, like a wine glass, when he had one right in front of him. these guys were amateurs...
 
They have indeed closed due to shady business practices. One of which being not paying the staff. I know this one first hand. The three main owners Justin Levine, Roman Jones and Matthew Glazier are all very wealthy men who take advantage of the people who work for them. Can anyone say&quot;employment lawsuit&quot;?
 
The owners were purposely trying to sink it in order to buy it from each other they had different interests it will probably turn into another opium night spot now.
 
The wait staff at Kane was a joke.
 
Roman Jones is an idiot...
 
fail.  a nightclub is a nightclub.  a restaurant is a restaurant.  these two things should never be  intertwined.
 
Would you like to email me? john.e.zur@gmail.com
 
Yes it is closed I worked there and would love to let everyone know exactly what happened if given the chance.  It was because of a failed partnership between Justin Levine. Roman Jones and Mathew Glazier.  The fact is that the nightclub owners ran that place into the ground they comped everything and had way too much input in areas where they were not qualified.  There were a lot of horrible business practices going on in that place.
 
Place never had a chance.....food OK, service sucked
 
Confirmation from a cook last night that the restaurant is, in fact, closed.
