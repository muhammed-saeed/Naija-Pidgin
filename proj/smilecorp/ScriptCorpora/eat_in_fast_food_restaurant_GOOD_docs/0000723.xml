Martin Tripp&apos;s Summary
 
I have over 15 years of electronics testing and troubleshooting experience on everything from aviation electronics, to automotive electronics, to cardiology telemetry and Electrocardiograph systems and devices. I was an automotive electronics repair facility Manager for almost 5 years.

I currently manage one investment property, with four Tenants. I oversea everything from Lease Agreements, to property Maintenance.

As a hobby, I work as a Guitar Technician/Roadie for two local bands. I help set up shows, handle all guitar rig setup, and provide immediate show support on stage.
 
Specialties

My specialty is the ability to adapt to ever changing environments, and be able to think as both a Technician, as well as an End User of whatever I am working on. I work well with others, and am always learning everything that I can. Troubleshooting, and creative solutions are what I am great at.
