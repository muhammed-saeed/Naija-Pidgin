Eating in the Dallas Area 

Overview
 Quote: The Dallas/Ft Worth Metroplex is huge, and there are many restaurants of all types to choose from.
I live in the area, and regularly visit many restaurants, and will share my best experiences (and worse nightmares) in this journal.

As the journal grows, I will split it into separate journal entries for Dallas suburbs.
Quick Tips:

Best Way To Get Around:
If you are going to be here for any length of time, you will need a car. Public transit is limited to bus service and light rail service in downtown and the limited surrounding area.

 Sitar Indian Cuisine 

Restaurant
 Quote: Sitar Indian Cuisine (a Sitar is an Indian stringed musical instrument) is a brand new (mid-July 2001) Indian restaurant in Plano (a north suburb of Dallas) that I found by accident one afternoon during lunch. Ironically, I was sitting in the drive-through of a fast food restaurant that is directly in front of Sitar. I was waiting and waiting and I spotted Sitar, and thought that I would come back and try it sometime. After more waiting in the crowded drive-through in the Texas heat, I thought, why not try it now?

Sitar Indian Cuisine (a Sitar is an Indian stringed musical instrument) is a brand new (mid-July 2001) Indian restaurant in Plano (a north suburb of Dallas) that I found by accident one afternoon during lunch. Ironically, I was sitting in the drive-through of a fast food restaurant that is directly in front of Sitar. I was waiting and waiting and I spotted Sitar, and thought that I would come back and try it sometime. After more waiting in the crowded drive-through in the Texas heat, I thought, why not try it now?

So I did...I was greeted and seated promptly by the friendly Indian host (presumably the proprietor). The first thing I noticed (after the $7.95 lunch buffet sign outside) was how nice and new everything was, and how nicely decorated the dining room is in alternating colors, and not overdone. They do a great job of blending traditional Indian decor with contemporary colors and light fixtures.....all in the middle of a strip mall.

They have nice white tablecloths and napkins. My visit was during lunch (daily from 11am to 3pm), and you could either order from the menu, or eat from the large all-you-can-eat lunch buffet. For dinner (Sunday through Thursday 5pm to 10pm, and 5pm to 11pm on Friday and Saturday), you order from the menu.

They have a range of appetizers ($3-$9) that can be shared with others, soups ($3), and accompaniments ($1-$2), but since it was lunch, I didn&apos;t try any. They have chicken, beef, lamb, and seafood tandoori ($11-$16) dishes; Chicken, Lamb and Beef specials ($12) including my favorite....Chicken Vindaloo; Seafood Specials ($14); Vegetable Specials ($8-$9); and rice dishes, desserts, drinks, and Indian breads to round things out.

The lunch buffet I tried had many selections, but they were a bit mild for my taste. What I really liked is that they bring hot freshly baked naan bread right to your table. I hope to return soon and order my favorite from the menu.

Sitar Indian Cuisine is located in a strip mall at the southeast corner of Preston Road and Highway 121. To get there, take Preston Road (way) north from downtown Dallas, or take Highway 121 north from the Dallas/Ft Worth International Airport.

 Hard Rock Cafe 

Restaurant
 Quote: This is an eclectic Hard Rock Cafe on eclectic (and historical) McKinney Avenue. This Hard Rock Cafe is also known as the &quot;Supreme Court of Rock and Roll,&quot; owning to its stately court house-like white stone architecture outside, complete with red carpet up the long front stairs to the entrance.

Out front, in the corner of the property for all to see is a clamorous looking oil pump (derrick?) like you see throughout West Texas, only this one is dressed up to appear as if it was made from precious medals.

This is an eclectic Hard Rock Cafe on eclectic (and historical) McKinney Avenue. This Hard Rock Cafe is also known as the &quot;Supreme Court of Rock and Roll,&quot; owning to its stately court house-like white stone architecture outside, complete with red carpet up the long front stairs to the entrance.

Out front, in the corner of the property for all to see is a clamorous looking oil pump (derrick?) like you see throughout West Texas, only this one is dressed up to appear as if it was made from precious medals. They have pay parking (!) in the rear of the building and offer valet parking. However, I have always found street parking nearby.

Inside, like other Hard Rock Cafe&apos;s, are wall-to-wall music memorabilia...I hesitate to use the term Hard Rock memorabilia, since the Hard Rock Cafe has stretched this definition to include pop stars like the ones my young daughter likes. Anyway, they have musical instruments, articles of clothing, gold records, and many posters and photographs of famous music stars. The restaurant is spacious (the huge 2 story restaurant was once a church) and attractive.

There is wood with brass banisters everywhere, and a small stage where bands often perform. The rest rooms in the basement are large, beautiful and spotless. At night, they are attended, and you are offered hot towels and choice of popular colognes (a tip is appropriate). In the front of the restaurant, there is a gift shop that sells their trademark logo T-shirts, hats, other articles of clothing, and other collectables.

They have a fairly large menu, with no separate lunch selection. They have Starters ($6-$14) including wings, potato skins, nachos, and more, some large enough to share; Salads ($8-$9); Burgers ($7-$9), Bar-B-Que ($9-$15) including ribs, chicken, pork sandwich, and combos; Sandwiches ($8-$9); and Specialties ($9-$18) including steaks, fajitas, chicken, meatloaf, and pastas. They also have desserts and a full bar. On the side of the restaurant, there is a guitar-shaped bar, if there are no tables available for seating.

During a recent visit (I have been there many times) for lunch, I had a Bacon Cheeseburger, which was served with french fries and sandwich toppings...my wife had a huge salad (that she loved)....and our young daughter is a huge fan of the macaroni and cheese on the kids menu. The real draw to the Hard Rock Cafe is their novelty theme.

This Hard Rock Cafe is located at 2601 McKinney Avenue, at the corner of McKinney Avenue and Routh Street, in the heart of the historic the McKinney Avenue entertainment district (you can&apos;t miss it). In case you do miss it, their phone number is 214-855-0007. The old-fashioned McKinney Avenue electric trolley cars ride right past the Hard Rock Cafe. There are cafes, boutiques, bars, restaurants, and antique shops in all directions from the Hard Rock.

 Blue Mesa Grill 

Restaurant
 Quote: The Blue Mesa Grill is a small chain (3 Dallas and 1 Ft Worth Restaurant) of very cool contemporary southwest American (NOT Tex-Mex)
cuisine restaurants. I have been to all 3 Dallas locations, and the food and service is consistently good in all of the restaurants. Each restaurant has the coolest contemporary southwest decor, in their architecture, furniture, colors, and art on display.

After you are seated, they serve fantastic complimentary homemade chips made from yellow, white, and blue corn tortillas, served with dishes of fresh red and brown salsas (both are great).

When our server comes, we usually order their trademark blue margaritas ($6), and their &quot;Tableside Guacamole ($7),&quot; which the server brings a tray of avocados, chiles, onions, spices, tomatos, etc, and makes a bowl of guacamole on the spot. The fresh guacamole compliments the homemade chips and fresh salsa perfectly.

After all the fresh chips, salsa, and guacamole, we often forego main courses, and get a bowl of their fantastic soup instead. Don&apos;t miss their soup ($4). They have &quot;Painted Desert&quot; soup, which is Black Bean soup and Corn Chile Chowder soup served next to each other in a soup bowl (without being mixed), garnished with sour cream and pico de gallo. Their other
soup is Tortilla soup, which is a hearty chicken and vegetable soup, served with a piece of corn on the cob, garnished with strips of their crispy homemade tortillas, and served piping hot. Both soups are excellent.

Blue Mesa Grill has a wide menu selection of appetizers ($7-$9), soups and salads ($3-$10), southwest entrees ($8-$12), southwest grill entrees ($10-$16), and desserts ($4-$6). We have tried several appetizers and entrees other that what I have mentioned, and have never had a bad experience.

Blue Mesa is kid-friendly, and has a kid&apos;s menu, and gives them crayons and an entertaining placemat upon arrival. Aside 
from the restaurant, each Blue Mesa location has a full bar that is very popular. In the bar they have weekday happy hours where they have chips and salsa out for you, AND complimentary quesadillas that are grilled to order. On the weekend, they have an amazing Sunday brunch that is hugely popular (but pricey). There is nothing you won&apos;t find on the 
buffet, and the selection of desserts is the most I have ever seen. They are open for lunch and dinner.

Blue Mesa has three locations around Dallas, and one Ft Worth location. We frequent the locations at 5100 Beltline Road at the southeast corner of Beltline Road and the North Dallas Tollway (972-934-0165), and a new location at 8200 Dallas Parkway in Plano at the southeast corner of the North Dallas Tollway and Highway 121 (972-387-4407). The third Dallas location is at 7700 West Northwest Highway, just west of Central Expressway (US 75). The Ft Worth location is 1600 South University Drive (817-332-6372). We always enjoy our visits to Blue Mesa, just don&apos;t go expecting Mexican or Tex-Mex food.

 Slider and Blues Restaurant and Bar 

Restaurant
 Quote: Slider and Blues is a small local chain of restaurants/bars that has a unique combination of a family restaurant catering to kids with a kids theme, play area and arcade, and an adult sports bar with full bar service and live entertainment.

They pull off the combination very well, and balance all the attributes of a family restaurant and a sports bar, creating an environment where the whole family can have a nice night out. For kids, they have a magician entertaining on Friday nights, and for adults there is live music on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday nights.

On the restaurant side of Slider and Blues, they have a simple but fairly large dinner menu of appetizers ($2-$16), burgers and sandwiches ($6), entrees ($6-$8), Pizzas and Calzones ($4-$9), Soups, Salads, and Baked Potatos ($2-$6), and desserts ($1-$4). They also have a kids menu ($1-$4). They have a similar lunch menu but usually have specials. Occassionally, they have a magician to entertain the kids.

To me, the sports bar area is a bigger draw than the restaurant and food. In their sports bar, they have a large bar and many high tables and chairs. There are televisions everywhere, and a small stage for a band. They have a full bar, but beer is clearly 
the drink of choice, since they have several dozen domestic and imports to choose from. They have poker machines and other amusements.

Our visits to Slider and Blues are usually for dinner and/or drinks. It is a friendly place,
and they get a nice crowd in the evenings. We have tried many things on their menu, and the
food is basic but good.

Slider and Blues is located in Plano (north suburb of Dallas) at 3033 West Parker Road, at the northeast corner of Parker and Independence. To get there, take Central Expressway (75) or the North Dallas Tollway north of downtown and exit at Parker. From 75 go west on Parker to Independence, or from the Tollway take Parker east to Independence. Their phone number is 972-867-8666.

It has a very clubby and formal atmosphere, and reservations are essential. We arrived in plenty of time for our reservation, so we browsed around the outdoor shopping center before entering the restaurant.

Cafe Pacific specializes in seafood, so I wouldn&apos;t go there for a steak. There are many great steak places in Dallas. For seafood and chicken dishes on special occassions, Cafe Pacific is hard to beat, unless you are on a low to medium budget.

Cafe Pacific has a full bar, and we enjoyed drinks after we were promptly seated. The servers have an amazing level of attention to detail. They brought out unusual complementary fried julienned sweet potatos that were nice to snack on.

Their menu has a selection of appetizers ($5-$12), entrees ($14-$32), and desserts ($5). We started with great mixed green salads ($5). After that I had their Corn Crusted Snapper ($22), which is a huge piece of baked fish covered with corn breading and corn chowder, served with mixed vegetables (I also bought a side of asparagus), and it was great. My wife had filet of sole almondine ($20), which was another huge piece of baked fish garnished with almonds, served with green beans. Since it was a special occassion, we followed with desserts. I had a chocolate cake special ($7) and my wife had a key lime tart ($6) and both were very delicious.

Cafe Pacific is a very nice place for special occassions. The atmosphere is very formal, but our table was kind of small and not very private from conversations from the next tables. This allowed me to observe their baked sea bass being served. It is apparently a specialty, and looked incredible.

Cafe Pacific is located in the Highland Park Village shopping center (for the well-moneyed) at the southwest corner of Preston Road and Mockingbird in North Dallas. Their phone number is 214-526-1170.

The servers are always friendly, but may not speak English very well. However, don&apos;t let that put you off. The menu items (the headings) are in Spanish, but the descriptions of each are in English. We are always treated well.

Tierra Caliente is open for breakfast, lunch and Dinner. They have several breakfast specials ($4-$5) and soups specials ($4-$6) on weekends. They have a larger selection of lunch specials ($5-$7), and for dinner they have a selection of appetizers ($3-$7),and large selection of chicken, beef, seafood and pork specialties ($7-$21). They have a kids menu, a small selection of desserts, and serve beer if you like.

We always go for breakfast, and I always get their Huevos Mexicana ($4), which are eggs scrambled with diced onion, bell pepper, and jalapinos, and served with rice and beans. My wife likes their soups, and usually gets one of
their weekend soup specials. On weekends they have Menudo (spicy soup with beef tripe) or 
Pazole, which is another spicy soup. Our young daughter is not as adventurous, and usually has regular eggs and/or pancakes.

Tierra Calente is located in north Dallas at 1957 East Beltline Road, which is at the north
east corner of Beltline Road and Josey Lane. Beltline is a major east/west street easily found on all maps. To get there, take US-75, I-35, the Dallas Tollway, or countless major north/south routes and go north of the 635 LBJ Freeway to Beltline. Tierra Caliente is at Josey Lane, which is east of I-35, west of the Tollway, and far west of US-75.

Anyway, El Paso is a hard-working place that does a good job. They are well established....this location has been here for many years. They are open for lunch and dinner, but all of our visits have been for dinner and/or evening drinks.

They have a very large menu of Nachos ($4-$8), Appetizers ($3-$9), Salads ($3-$7), Quesadillas ($7-$10), Fajita (beef, chicken, and shrimp) Platters ($10-$15), Enchilada Dinners ($7-$12), and other specials and combinations ($7-$9). They also have a small selection of Lunch Specials ($5-$6).

I usually get their Beef Fajita Enchilada Dinner ($9), which is 2 cheese enchiladas covered with beef chili and fajita meat, served with sides of rice and beans. It is consistently good every visit. We are always seated promptly on arrival, given chips and salsa, and our drink order taken.

They have a full bar that we enjoy. In fact, behind the dining room in the front of the restaurant, they have a separate Cantina, if you don&apos;t want to be in a family restaurant environment. They also have a large outdoor patio with lots of tables and seating in the front of the restaurant. Inside, the restaurant has homey wood paneling with hand painted murals, and simple tables and chairs.

El Paso Tex-Mex Cafe is located north of Dallas in Plano at 1320 North Central Expressway. This is on the northbound service road for US-75. To get there, take US-75 north of Dallas to Plano, and exit at 15th Street (this is exit 29). Stay on the service road and get in the right lane. The restaurant will be on the right well before you get to the traffic light at 15th Street.

Their lunch menu has &quot;light lunches and salads&quot; ($4-$7), soups ($3-$5), pastas ($7-$8), and meat dishes ($6-$9). Their dinner menu has mostly the same dishes as the lunch menu, but probably larger portions. Dinner appetizers and salads are ($5-$8), soups ($3-$5), pasta ($11-$15), and sausage and meat
specialties ($10-$16). Dinners are served with sides like warm potato salad, sauerkraut, French fries, and pasta dumplings. All of my dining visits have been from dinner, and I have never been disappointed with the food or service. If you don&apos;t like German food, or are not open to trying it, note that there are no American dishes on the menu. However, don&apos;t let that stop you from coming and having a good time.

Most of my visits are just to visit the bar. The Bavarian Grill has a great bar with bar seating and indoor and outdoor Oktoberfest beerhall-style tables. They have a large loyal following of die-hard regulars that are German beer fans who are members of their &quot;stein club&quot; who joined the club by drinking all the beers on their very extensive list of German beers. Once you check off
all the beers on the club card, members are rewarded with a personalized beer stein and special privileges. Many members have completed 2 or 3 club cards and receive premuim prizes like apparel and sporting goods.

The bar has many draft and bottled German beers, both light and dark, but go for the fun environment and to make friends with their locals. There is always lively discussion, and, you can play cards or dominos. The Bavarian Grill is a nice change of routine. Just be in the mood for fun or you may not enjoy yourself.

The Bavarian Grill is located at 221 West Parker Road in Plano, in the Russeau Center strip mall. To get there, take Central Expressway (US-75) North from Dallas to Plano, and exit at Parker Road. Go west and quickly get to the right because after the Russeau Center strip mall is on the right just after crossing US-75.

You can order a dish with 5 or 6 of these, with beans and rice. They also have great fajitas. You can get a combination of fajitas and the jumbo shrimp.

Whatever you get, you will get plenty. My wife and I often each get tortilla soup (which is awesome) and share an entree.

Since the place is large, it is VERY loud. This is not the place for an intimate dinner or business discussion. It is the place for food, drink, music, laughs, and fun.

Mariachis&apos; (guitar/violin/vocal) also walk around and play requests (a tip is appropriate). I&apos;ll bet they have played &apos;happy birthday&apos; a million times.

They have daily specials, one is always seafood, and a favorite of my wife.

They recently added valet parking during peak times, which is a nice touch, because parking can involve looking and walking.

The margaritas are very good. They also have a selection of domestic and imported beer.

My 4 year old loves to visit the flour tortilla maker.

There are several locations throughout the metroplex. I mostly go to this one, but food and service are consistent at all locations.

 Pranzo Italian Grill 

Restaurant
 Quote: I go to Pranzo Italian Grill once or twice a month, usually for lunch. They have a second location on Central Expressway in Plano (another north suburb).

The food and decor are Italian all the way. You can order a variety of salads, pizzas, and pastas. At this location, you place you order and pay at a window (not as bad as it sounds), and then you are seated, and given your drink order.

The food follows very quickly, which is nice for a quick lunch.

I enjoy their Rigatoni Carbonara, which is pasta in a cream sauce with bits of ham or Canadian Bacon. It comes with garlic bread. I go to Pranzo Italian Grill once or twice a month, usually for lunch. They have a second location on Central Expressway in Plano (another north suburb).

 Akbar 

Restaurant | &quot;Akbar (Indian)&quot;

Akbar is located on Parker Road in Plano, just west of Central Expressway (there is a Parket Rd exit), in the Ruisseau Center (strip mall).

The decor is typical of Indian restaurants. Akbar has a lunch buffet that is good. You can also order from their menu.

For dinner or take out orders, I always get my favorite Murg Murch Masala, which is a VERY spicy/hot Chicken (Murg) red curry with tomato and potato that I love to spoon over their fabulous rice. They also have Indian bread (called Nan) that is served hot.

Don&apos;t worry, they have a selection of milder curry dishes, tandori dishes, and sizzling grilled dishes. In addition to chicken, there are many beef, lamb, seafood, rice, and vegetarian dishes. Read Less

 Patrizio Plano Restaurant

The tables are nicely spaced apart, and all have white tablecloth and napkins. There is an outdoor patio I recommend if the weather is nice. It has space heaters that do a good job of extending the patio season.

Inside, they have a large wood bar that is popular with the after-work crowd. The Bellinis are very popular (a frozen peach-flavored drink). Of course, they also have ample dining space inside.

The food is great. We always get their Iron Skillet Mussels as an appetizer. They must be farm raised, because there is never a trace of sand, salt, or grit in them.

They have many entrees to choose from. I have tried their Baked Ziti and Spaghetti Carbonara, and like both very much.

On occassion, we share a Tiramisu for desert.

They also have a small bakery, and of course lots of flour tortillas and chips packaged to go.

We are always seated promptly by a friendly hostess, and chips and fantastic fresh salsa follow. When drink orders arrive (usually beer or good margaritas), our food orders are taken.

The owner is usually here, and always walks around to say hello, and to make sure everyone is happy. This is a nice touch that is missing from chain restaurants.

They have nachos, dips, and peppers available as appetizers ($2-8). We usually stick to their chips and salsa, since the salsa is fresh and clearly home made....really good....and complementary.

Entrees ($6-12) are varied and include Beef, chicken, cheese, spinach, and shrimp specialty plates, Mexican dinners, fajitas, and combination plates. Desserts ($2-4) are also available.

What I love to get and highly recommend are their beef &quot;Tacos Al Carbon.&quot; They take a delicious Rib Eye steak, broil it to your liking, and slice it and roll it into 2 soft flour tortillas, and add sides of good refried beans, Guacamole, and Pico de Gallo. I make fantastic steak tacos by adding the Guacamole and Pico. Yum!

Lunch (when I visited) costs less than dinner, but well worth an occasional visit, even though it is well beyond my normal lunch budget.

Lunch entrees were about $12 and included soup or salad and vegetable. I had shank steak (carved beef seasoned with garlic butter) with mashed potatoes (that were fantastic), and green beans. I started with cream of mushroom soup that was creamy, piping hot, and great. I also had a glass of Fume Blanc, and ended with great coffee.

My guests had breaded salmon (great I&apos;m told) that I hope to go back and try, and a pasta special.

A great meal, good service, and very nice environment, make Lombardi Mare a great place for special occasions, or even business lunches, meals, and/or meetings. They have private dining rooms with a private chef available for groups. The coat check at the entrance was a nice touch.

A large oval bar is between the entrance and the main dining area. There are also neat oval tables/booths on one side of the bar, and an open kitchen on the other side.

In the main dining area, there are tables and booths, and large booths in the corners. There is also an outdoor covered patio with ceiling fans and space heaters when needed. The patio has a nice setting on an artifical pond. I didn&apos;t visit the patio, but it may be a little too close to Preston Road (traffic noise).

I was seated promptly, given complementary chips and fresh salsa, and my drink order taken. It was immediately apparent that Taqueria Canonita goes for authenticity of Mexican food, instead of being like every other Tex-Mex restaurant. They also serve small plates (Platos Chicos) in addition to large plates (Platos Grandes) with rice and beans.

The small plates are perfect for sharing with a group of people, like in a Tapas bar.

Appetizers ($4-9) were different cheese dishes, flautas, soups, tostadas, and salads.

Small Plates ($5-7 small plate, $8-10 platter) available were tacos (beef, chicken, fish, chile, mushroom, and pork), Quesadillas (shrimp/mango, pork, chicken, vegetable), Empanada (flaky turnovers with mushroom, pork, or vegetarian), and Tamales.

Large Plates ($10-14) are a wide range of pork, chicken, steak, and shrimp dishes.

Desserts ($5) are also available, with custard, donut, cake, and fried bananas offered.

The bar has a huge selection of beer ($3-4) and tequila ($5-10).

I started with Tortilla Soup, served piping hot. The first few spoonfuls were a little spicy, but as a ate it, I enjoyed it more. Presentation was good. They garnished the top of the soup with sour cream, like a cake decorator would.

I followed with a small plate of beef tacos. It was 3 small tacos served on thin flour tortillas (a nice change), with small sides of chopped cilantro, onions, and house slaw.

The food and service were good, and the rest room clean. If you are looking for Tex-Mex, go to Pappasitos (see other journal entry). But if you want to try authentic and innovative Mexican food, check Taqueria Canonita out.

seven nights a week. Throughout the entire building, there are dozens of televisions playing sports. Some of the screens are absolutely huge...10 or 12 feet!
Since there are different things to do, Carson&apos;s Palace is a great place to go with a large group of people. Everyone will have a good time.

Carson&apos;s Palace has a large menu that has some things you would expect at a sports bar and 
night club, but also has many things you would never expect. They have a wide range of 
appetizers ($6-$20), soups ($3-$6) and salads ($4-$8), tacos ($8-$10), sandwiches ($8-$12),
pizza ($8-$10), steaks ($18-$25), pasta ($10-$12), and special entrees ($9-$16) like salmon, chicken, pork chops and pork ribs. They even have a range of desserts.

Carson&apos;s Palace also has a huge bar that has dozens of beers on draft, dozens of wines by the glass, and many many specialty martinis and other cocktails.

My visit was with a large group following a business function, and Carson&apos;s Palace set us up with a private dining room (where we had pizza and appetizers) and we also had a huge billiards room to ourselves that had 8 or 10 very nice tables. The billiards room was a great place to enjoy drinks, play pool using great equipment, and see every minute of any sporting event going on at the time.

The only thing I did not like about Carson&apos;s Palace was the valet parking. It is required at Carson&apos;s Palace and I prefer options. On top of that, they weren&apos;t very good at it on my
visit, and mixed up tickets and keys, resulting in delays and confusion.

Carson&apos;s Palace is located at 17727 North Dallas Parkway, in far North Dallas near the northwest corner of the North Dallas Tollway and Trinity Mills. To get there, take the North Dallas Tollway and exit at Trinity Mills. Carson&apos;s Palace is on the southbound service road facing the Tollway. They are open seven days a week from 11am until 2am. They serve food until 1:30am. There is a $5-$7 cover charge after 9am and after 10pm on weekends. Their phone number is 972-931-9111.
