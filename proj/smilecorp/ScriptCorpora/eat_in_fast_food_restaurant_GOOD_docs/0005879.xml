The Hot Szechuan Bean Curd and the Kung Pao Chicken are my favorite dishes here. I get steamed rice to round out my three item plate as the hot bean curd and the kung pao chicken are really spicy and the steamed rice does a good job on neutralizing  the spiciness. However, if eaten too quickly, I get all red, teary eyed, and steamy.

Minus one star for all the grease and chilli oil they use. It can be quite a turnoff for some, but I&apos;m a sucker for the pain provided by chillies that are loaded into the Hot Szechuan Bean Curd and the Kung Pao Chicken.

I only came here because I was running short on time because I could not find the Washington Mutual branch for like 30 mins. My dumbass thought the Branch was in the Riverside plaza because I saw the word River in the listing.

It was either subway or this place and I didn&apos;t want a Subway. I order the 2-item meal with chow mein, the general&apos;s chicken, and mushroom tofu.

It was definitely a quickly and I proceed back to work irritated and starved.

The chow mein tasted like bean sprouts. The tofu was sour, debating if it was bad. The general chicken was a little sour. What a waste of $6. The perfect end to a great lunch.

Well, the Deli that Maxx refers to has since closed, but parking is still a pain at this location.

The staff is helpful and service is quick here, but the food is pretty lacking.

It&apos;s very greasy and not too big on flavor.  The portions are large though.

I work across the street, and most of my coworkers refuse to eat here.  I&apos;ll eat here if I feel like a quick lunch that isn&apos;t pizza without having to drive anywhere.  In other words, not often.

I can see why this place doesn&apos;t get much of a lunchtime rush. I guess this is another review to add to my string of low portion meals. They&apos;re not so generous as some other places.

My 2-item combo was a little over $6. I had the Black-peppered chicken, Mongolian Beef, and half-half chow mein and fried rice. For the price I paid, I think I deserved more. The Chow Mein and Fried rice were a little bland. The Mongolian beef wasn&apos;t...Mongolian-enough (in terms of flavor, that is). The black-peppered chicken was tangy/ salty but ok.

The service is pretty quick. But then again, when I went, there weren&apos;t many people, so that has to say something.

I&apos;ve definitely had better. So I would think twice about coming back to this place. Maybe if this was the last place to eat on earth, then perhaps.

The chinese food here is cheap (one item $5.14 incl. taxes), the service is quick, and the quality is pretty good. The owners are family, and speak Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese - and are very pleasant and personable.

Not too much seating inside the restaurant, but thats okay because there are plenty of chairs and tables under the shady trees shared outside with nearby Unamas. Since San Jose has a whopping 300 sunny days a year, this makes for a great lunchtime atmosphere.

Steamed rice or chow mein are the base, with a choice of pepper steak (the best! If not available, order it anyway and wait for it - well worth the wait.), general&apos;s chicken, sweet and sour pork, curry chicken, broccoli beef, etc. available as items. The chow fun is optional (and very good), as are the eggrolls and potstickers. Drinks are available (no free refills) from both the fountain and in bottles. Pick up a free copy of the Wave Magazine and read it while you eat lunch.

Once again, parking can be a real hassle here. If you plan on getting food to go, then I suggest you park by the dumpster - blocking it if necessary. The garbage man only shows up on Mondays and you won&apos;t be in there long enough to make a difference. The food is served quick, and you&apos;ll be on your way before there are any issues with nearby Byrnes Deli.

They take Mastercard/Visa for purchases over $5. You have to ask for the condiments and utensils (chopsticks, soy sauce, mustard, soy sauce, sweet sauce). Perfect lunch spot, as it has options including Pizza, the Deli and Burritos in close proximity.

Quick lunch food

It&apos;s the kind of place you go to when you have to buy something quick and return to your desk.

The portions are good size.  I&apos;ll usually get one item with half rice and half chow fun with an order of Sweet n Sour Chicken for .   Broccoli beef&apos;s ok too.

4 stars for quick selection
4 stars for nice people
3 stars for food
2 stars for crowded parking lot during lunch (there&apos;s Hobees, Una Mas, Subway, Starbucks, Premier Pizza and Super Suppers sharing this smallish parking lot)

I used to come here for lunch once a week when my office was within walking distance. Came here today to meet an ex-colleague and the chow fun still tastes great! I usually order one item (broccoli and beef, general chicken or orange chicken) with chow fun ($5.14 tax included).

If you are looking for a quick and decent lunch around the River Oaks neighborhood, China Taste is the perfect lunch spot.

Ample parking in the covered garage.

Chinese Fast Food is Chinese Fast Food.

Food taste ok but i honestly prefer it over Panda Express any day!!!!! A little too much on the oil which will turn off some people like what others have said but all in all it&apos;s ok and it&apos;s not bad.

A cool thing about this place is that the staff is very friendly and they&apos;ll remember who you are no matter how many times you&apos;ve been there which was pretty cool.

Always too salty. Hurts my tongue to eat here. They always give me a plastic fork instead of chop sticks. I think it is because I speak proper English. Pisses me off. This place sucks.

This is not a bad fast food place for lunch, used to be a real good value for Chinese food but they have since jacked up the price.  Orange chicken is good.
