 Jewelry Switch 
 
“Switching” stones may not be as uncommon as you would like to think.  Jewelers that you would normally consider reputable and working out of well known reputable jewelry stores have been accused of switching out stones with  much less valuable stones or even fakes.  How would you ever know that a switch has been made and how would you prove it if it had been done?

 Slaughtered Farm Animal Meat 
 
Critics complain that the government’s rules on animal feed and the slaughtering process fall way short in protecting consumers from disease.  No one really seems to be checking to see if meat processors are even following the rules to protect consumers.

The tissues most likely to transmit deadly disease to consumers come from slaughtered animal brains and spinal cords.  The way farm animals are slaughtered may aggravate the problem.

Animal brains are not supposed to be in any part of any food or food product for human consumption, yet brain matter may get scattered throughout the animal carcass during slaughter.

The first step in the slaughtering process is to stun the farm animal with a stun gun causing a force so explosive that it may splatter brain tissue into the animal’s blood vessels, possibly circulating brain tissue throughout the animal with scary implications.

Furthermore, the meat that cannot be cut away from the bone by the “de-boners” during the slaughter process ends up at the “grinders”, better known as the Advanced Meat Recovery Plants (AMR).   Grinding meat remnants from the bone, including the spinal cord, boosts a meat processor’s meat yield by up to 300 million pounds of meat a year giving a windfall profit to the meat processors.  That next cheap cut of luncheon meat you eat or low cost serving from a fast food restaurant may have come from an AMR plant.  To date, AMR meat does not have to be listed on any food packaging ingredient labels.

Consequently, bits of spinal cord tissue may end up in the processed meats you eat.  U.S. government meat inspections found bits of spinal cord in two of the eleven meat samples tested.  Due to the very nature of the grinding process, can we ever process meat free of spinal cord tissue?

Concerning animal feed, the U.S. government’s own rules prohibit the feeding of cattle and sheep remains to living farm cattle and sheep being raised for human consumption.  However, the remains of pigs, horses and chickens, including the blood and gelatin from ANY kind of animal may still be used as a source of super-cheap animal feed.

Yet, there is a loophole.  To date, animals known to possibly carry mad cow disease, like sheep with scrapie disease, are still allowed to be fed to pigs, chickens and even processed into pet food.

Critics charge the agents causing mad cow disease, and other deadly diseases, are able to jump from species to species through food.  Remember, people dying of mad cow disease is not a common occurrence but when people die of some diseases the disease that killed them is not always known and neither is the cause so more people could be dying of mad cow disease than we may ever know about.

Has the U.S. government possibly perpetuated a risk where none needs to be?  Since other countries worldwide have already banned the use of  any animal remains in animal feed, critics charge American meat-eating consumers should be getting the same protection.

 Rigged Quotes For Home Repair Services 
 
Repair Scam–And You Thought The Guy Was Helping You

You call a service person so come to your home for a repair, any kind of repair, and if the service person quotes you a high price for the repair and you tell the service person the quote for the repair is too high, here is what may happen.

The repair person makes a phone call, then tells you, the homeowner, that the high price was just negotiated down to a lower price and if you agree to the lower price you go ahead and let the service person make the repair.

What You Did Not Know Before Agreeing to Pay

What you may not be aware of is the repair person likely gets a hefty commission on whatever repairs get serviced for the repair company so odds are the price to make the repair was abnormally high and the so-called negotiated lower price was still overpriced for the repair but you, the homeowner, seem happy and the service person just made a hefty commission in the process.

 To get an overall fair price for home repairs you may want to find repair companies that do not hire service people to make the repairs and only deal with repair companies where the owner of the company makes the repairs!

 Credit Card Fraud Anywhere You Leave Tips 
 
Keep an Eye on Credit Card Bills for Tip Scams

Anytime you leave a tip on a credit card for services rendered, like at a restaurant, you may not be aware that the tip amount you write on the bill to be paid to the service person may NOT be the tip amount that shows up on your credit card bill at the end of the month!
 
For example, you are at a restaurant and it is time to pay the bill so you ask for the check but unless the service person actually brings the mini-credit card machine to you and you put the tip amount right into the machine yourself, the tip amount that shows up on your credit card bill at the end of the month may not be the same amount you originally wrote on the sales receipt when you paid for your meal.
 
What unsuspecting consumers do not know is someone has to enter the tip amount you gave the service person and that person has the power to change the dollar amount you gave the service person unless you were given what looks like a mini-credit card machine to enter the exact amount yourself.

What those involved in this type of credit card fraud are counting on is that you do not closely check all your credit card amounts when you get the credit card bill at the end of the month.  If no one brings you the credit card machine so you can enter the tip yourself right into the machine, the only other solution is for you to double-check every charge on your credit card bill at the end of the month against the receipt you took away from the establishment at the time you made the charge on your credit card.
