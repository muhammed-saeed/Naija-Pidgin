&apos;TOON TUMBLERS! Pint glasses for comic book geeks!
 
 Shannon L. was recently at the Philadelphia WizardWorld ComicCon and saw something there that he thought we&apos;d like. He talked to the manufacturer and brought us back a sample, which is on display in the Mechanicsburg store... TOON TUMBLERS from PopFun Merchandising ! Check it out:

 
From their website:
 &quot;Remember when you could walk into a fast-food restaurant, pay a few cents extra, and get a real glass featuring your favorite comic-book or cartoon character? Remember how much fun was it to go back every week to see what glass would be released next?

Well, PopFun is going to bring back that fun with &apos;Toon Tumblers®, featuring your favorite classic animated, comic book, and comic strip characters on quality glassware. Every 4-6 weeks will see the release of a new, high quality, limited edition 16 oz. glass.&quot; 
Now let me tell you, these are not made of thin, cheap glass... they are much like pub pint glasses, made with very sturdy, thick glass with heat-fired embossed images, not cheap, scratchable decals... and they are too too cool! Some of these will start coming available in a month or two, and we will be taking pre-orders (no money down) on them. Retail price is $9.95 I think.

Marvel characters listed as upcoming: Spider-man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Captain America, Wolverine, Phoenix, Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Banshee, Colossus, The Avengers, Iron Man, Master of Kung Fu, Dr. Strange, Nova, Daredevil, Luke Cage Power Man, Captain Marvel, Invaders, Warlock, Ghost Rider, The Defenders, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Killraven, Black Panther, Tomb of Dracula, Spider-woman, Man-Thing, Black Widow, and Punisher, all in their 1970s &quot;Bronze Age&quot; incarnations.

Let us know which ones you want! Stop by the Mechanicsburg store and check out the WOLVERINE glass we have on display. Woo-HOOOO!
