The service is always slow. I mean the we forgot about you kinda slow. Always. The employees are never the same twice(in my observation over a half dozen visits in about a year).  They are not rude, just slow. 15-20 minutes to get an average order? Even if you are the only customer? Now I&apos;m no master chef, but If you deep fry a piece of fish for 15 minutes, can you eat it?  And they do not honor the currently running TV special.

The food is good. Exactly as I remember LJS from living in Arizona 20 years ago. I&apos;m glad that Yum Brands did not screw up their menu in a corporate attempt to raise profits. IMO, Yum does not denigrate their products like some corporations have.(Think pizza chain with a domino on their sign)

1 star for service and 5 stars for product = 3 stars.

Words cannot even describe just how terrible my food was from here.

My friend and I went on a drive-thru sampling through Federal Way to try all the chains I&apos;ve never tried, and Long John Silver&apos;s was by far, the absolute worst.

We ordered a kid&apos;s meal with popcorn shrimp and after waiting at the drive thru for about ten minutes, we received a small box of fries, popcorn shrimp and hush puppies.

I was expecting it to be somewhat like Skipper&apos;s, but no, no and no, it was not. I took a bite of the shrimp and had to spit it out, and I tend to eat everything if I buy it regardless of how terrible it is, like the cat food taco from Del Taco. The popcorn shrimp tasted so fishy and freezer burnt - the shrimpy fumes acted like an asphyxiation when I put it in my mouth! The fries and hush puppies also had a fishy taste.

To add insult to injury, the food was only in my car for about ten minutes before we threw it out, yet my car smelled like Long John Silver&apos;s for a week. Stick to the KFC side of this place.

Terrible service! They had us wait a whole hour for our simple to-go meal. It&apos;s not like we were making a catering order or anything; just a meal for four! Yet they can&apos;t get that right. We had paid for our order then after minutes of waiting, they tell us that they&apos;re out of drumsticks and we&apos;d have to wait 25 minutes. Well, you could have told us that before we paid! We decided to go ahead and wait for the 25 minutes.

After that, now they tell us that they&apos;ve run out of corn! So we have to wait an additional 10 minutes! We were already there for a half hour so we might as well wait. The employees there didn&apos;t seem very apologetic at all and just carried on as if they do that to every single customer there! The service is just plain terrible, even if it is a fast food restaurant!

We had some coupons come in the mail, so we thought we&apos;d give them a try to see how the food was.

We went there right around 8pm, and there was a sign on the door saying they were closing at 8:30 to do some sort of cleaning.  Okay - no problem, we would just eat and leave.  There was only 1 person ahead of me, and the cashier chatted with him for a while after he ordered.  Then he finally got to me maybe 10 minutes after I walked in the door.  I needed to order 6 chicken strips, and he went to the back to ask someone something, and then came back to say they only had 5 of them, not 6.   ????  So, we left..... that&apos;s crazy - and we won&apos;t be back to this location.

I am seeing a lot of comments about the bad service here. I partially agree ... my experience was that the staff are friendly enough, but yes the wait time was a little long for sure.  The food itself is not remarkable at all, in this regard I would say to avoid this place. It was just generally low quality (frozen fish triangles) and a pretty unhealthy meal for sure (greasy and salty). For me, if I am going to clog my arteries, it better be &quot;worth it&quot; and this place isn&apos;t at all. Find an independent fish n chips place of any kind and you will be happier for sure.

Wrong address given - it&apos;s the old KFC address where Church&apos;s is now... LJS&apos;s is down by the Super Walmart and HWY 18.
Their fish n chips were surprising good and the price was reasonable.

FINALLY, we have Long John Silver&apos;s in WA! This greasy FF chain is THE CLOSEST the USA gets to the taste of authentic UK fish&amp;chips as I enjoyed them on the east coast of England as a child.

My family moved to the states when I was 7. LGS&apos;s *taste* was the only reminder of England we had in Colorado. Ever since we relocated to Seattle in 1986, I&apos;ve been tormented by Long John Silver&apos;s commercials. I never could figure out why I was seeing these despite Washington state&apos;s total dearth of the joints. But every time I saw one, I&apos;d call information to confirm the bad news. Not a single location in WA. I couldn&apos;t believe it when I saw the sign. You know I&apos;m serious because though I was simultaneously baffled to see an actual DEL TACO (WTF?!) sign NEXT DOOR, even that long-overdue Californian excellence was insufficient to overpower my urge for those LGS diamonds of scrumptiousness.

Don&apos;t bother with LJS&apos;s fancy, high-end dishes. They are boring and unremarkable. Just get yourself a three piece fish&amp;chips, douse it in vinegar and you&apos;re in business.

Hoping to see one of these in Seattle.

What&apos;s weird is that the corporate Long John Silver&apos;s wesbite does not even list a location in Washington state.  But there it is anyway, like an Area 51 covert governmental outpost that exists, but not on the books.  I will confess that I have not eaten at this specific location although I do love Long John Silver&apos;s and was very happy to see the sign in Federal Way.  But then I was saddened to see that it was part of a KFC (it&apos;s one of those hybrid restaurants) and I have been guilted by my wife out of eating at a KFC after seeing all of those animal abuse videos on the PETA.ORG website.  Darn you KFC, why can&apos;t you just kill those chickens in a way that PETA approves?

I believe in giving people a 2nd chance and so we went back last Sunday for lunch.

I had a question on two items on the menu.   (We had already ordered and I was wondering about the price)  One was 2 pieces of fish, 2 hushpuppies, fries and a drink for about $5.70 (est.) and the other was the same except it had Cole Slaw and was about $6.49 (called &quot;More food&quot;).    I ordered the 2nd meal when my wife pointed out it did not include a drink.   I asked the server and she gave me a blank stare and said it is cost more because it says there is more food.   I asked what the more food is and she said the Cole Slaw.   I asked but there is no drink.  She said that is correct.   I asked how much a drink is - answer $1.79.   How much is a side of Cole Slaw - answer $1.79 HUH   both are the same price, they take away one and add the other and increase the cost about .60.   She said yeah - is that a problem.     I guess it was just me.

I called for the manager and he came out and we went through the same song and dance.    He kept saying it says there is more food - justifying the increase - and the drink is not food??     I was getting more and more frustrated and asked him (yes it was bad of me) didn&apos;t they learn in school that a $1.79 drink cost is the same amount as a $1.79 Cole slaw cost.   At that time the food came up - he (the manager) grabbed the food put it on the back counter and ordered me out of the store or he was calling the police?  Good customer service.      I was upset - and asked for my refund - putting my drink on the counter but it hit something and spilled - just on the counter.   He then said that is it and I need to leave and I am not getting a refund.   I told him fine - call the police - which he did not do.   Finally he reached in his till grabbed my refund and threw it all over the floor saying sorry that was an accident.   I wonder if that is in your training manual.

This was my earlier review - as you can see there are consistently bad..   This Long John Silver&apos;s is down by the Wal-Mart in KFC.    I would rate it as the worse place to go for service.  The food is OK but I have never been there without a slow cashier taking forever to ring up sales.   Then you wait and wait.   We were there last week and it took us over 15 minutes (inside) to order and over 15 minutes to get our order - fast food hah hah.    The tables are very seldom clean and there is usually food on the floors.   Go to Ivar&apos;s or Popeye&apos;s (for Chicken - it is across the street in Costco lot).
