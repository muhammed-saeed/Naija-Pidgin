 This one started sometime last week with an unsolicited email and some verrrry steamy photos to my dead drop account... I borrowed some of my Miss Rita Williams bait to counter her opening gambit... I think it&apos;s about to get interesting.... 

--------


&gt;&gt;Hello 

&gt;&gt;I&apos;m sending my photos so you can remember who I am. it is my first time I try to correspondence with man in internet world. I do hope you will be enough patient to understand my writing.

I want you to know that I have only good intentions and I don`t have
big secrets. The thing is that I will work abroad for three months or so and I would like to meet a nice man to be my guideor just be good
friend to spend time with.I think that it is hard enough to live in foreign town without friends and also I have never been abroad. I am from so small town here in Rusian Federation,I am afraid to be lost.

&gt;&gt;I want to see real life and it is impossible to see without person who knows all sides of the life. It doesn`t matter what age is

he or what is his eyes color, I just want to know that he is kind and open-hearted inside.

I don&apos;t want to live in Rusian Federation because I have not any chances here,it is hardly possible to explain it by the first time but
I want you to know my plans. In Ru ssia many young girls also want to start a new life abroad, so many of them used a special program &quot;W ork and travel&quot; for young people who wants to work abroad. I also decided to do so and to use it.

This program just helps to register documents and gives suitable work in any state(town)of USA, Canada or Europa (or other big country) . I just need to choose.I already started to register documents and now I need to decide in which city I want to work.

&gt;&gt;I`m 26 years old and I`m not afraid of work (I shall work as the seller in shop or cafe of a fast food).

I think it is the right way for me, I am lost here, and I think that I look pretty enough

to find a better place. I never been abroad so I decided to find a friend abroad and make his city to be my destination. I want to repeat the same way,it is my only chance to change my life.

I am full of plans and different dreams. I have black hair and at me blue eyes! I think I look very good, but first of all I want to be beautiful inside. I do hope that you will be not disappointed to meet me in the real life if we will meet 

&gt;&gt;Well I will close this letter and I do hope to get your reply.
I will leave my town in a few days or so (I can&apos;t tell you everything
exactly right now) and I would like to

be sure that I have a man who waits for me there. I will work all day
and I would like to find a man to spend all free time together to get to know each other better.
if you have any interest to meet me I will be more than happy to meet
you too. My be it sounds silly but I just don&apos;t want to be alone in the
evenings,and I want to be sure in advance that somebody waits for me!
I think that my e-mail starts to be too long so I will tell you all details about me and my life that you would like to know in next e-mails if you will like my pictures and will want to meet me!

&gt;&gt;I send my photos.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;With best regards IRINA! (this is my real full name).


&gt;&gt;P.S I hope it&apos;s OK with you and I will receive an answer from you!
I hope I&apos;m your type of girl, I&apos;m not sure you like Slavic appearance!! I hope so!


&gt;&gt;OK, I will wait for your answer. When I hear back from you I will
write more things about myself and send more pics!

---------

 Albert replies: 

&gt;&gt;My dearest Irina,


&gt;&gt;The pictures you shared with me made me tumescent with
anticpation... the thought of comforting myself with the flesh of a woman as beautiful as you makes me praise the Lord in the loudest voice I can raise.

What would ever cause as beautiful a young woman as yourself to have to join a single christian&apos;s sex website like thebigchurch.com is beyond me. There must be hundreds of young acolytes who would be blessed
to be with a woman like you. The fact that you chose me must be ordained in the eyes of the Lord that we are meant in his wisdom to be together for eternity and I will share myself with you souly as I hope you will with me.

&gt;&gt;I have been so lonely for so long since my dear wife passed away, and though I have met other worthy women on The Big Church.com Christian sex site, I have not felt compelled to spill my seed with any of
them, which compounds my lonliness. This big house is so empty without the sounds of another&apos;s laughter and I long for the pattter of little feet running and playing in the gardens and splashing in the swimming pool. I would love to have more pictures of you so I
can fantasize about our life together in the busom of our Lord Jesus Christ, our savior, and hope you will share your fantasies with me.

kiss irina

-------------------

 Albert would like to turn her over his knee and give her the good spanking she deserves, but his is a kind and nonjudgemental man of faith. 


&gt;oh my goodness, you have nothing to be ashamed of my

&gt;darling Irina... you are the most beautiful woman I

&gt;have ever seen... I only hope that you will send me

&gt;more photos and tell me more about yourself...

---------------------------------

Albert hello! thank&apos;s for your reply so much!!!

I think about your age! have you heard a saying The older the violin the sweeter the music?!

I hope soon I will be able to come to your area and we will meet each other!

this time I will write you more about myself. I think you should know

more about my life and my hobbies so you will know if we have any

common interests. I&apos;m 26 years old, not too young I

think? My birthday is 26 May. I&apos;m 169 cm tall (5.9) and 58,6 kg weight..

I don&apos;t know exactly my bust-waist-hips measurements, I

don&apos;t have a reason to measure it because I think it&apos;s OK and my body

is proportionate ))

I take care of my body, I do aerobics three times

a week and I go to the swimming pool twice a week.

I have no sister or brother. I live with the father and mother.

We all live in two-rooms flat.

As I wrote you I live in Russia. The name of my city is Nazarovo,

it&apos;s near Krasnoyarsk city. Nazarovo is very small and Krasnoyarsk is a

large city, the main city in our district.

I graduated from Krasnoyarsk Humanitarian University two years ago.

As I wrote you I`m a menager of the big shop, my city is small but we have a

big shop here. Sometimes I attend courses in

Krasnoyarsk so I have several diplomas (look

pic), but you know in russia we don`t have good work opportunities. But this work help me to take

care about myself. When I come to your city I think it won`t be a problem to find work on

my specialization (I shall work as the simple seller).

my father is 58 years old now, my mom is 46. You see my mom

is much younger then my father and they are very happy together. My

mother is a teacher of music in the school. I also could play a piano a

little. I like classic music, jazz, rock, lounge. I like all kinds of music!

A little about my father: he is in a good shape because we usually make

exercises together, he doesn`t work now, because he is retired already.

I love both my parents and I&apos;m happy my parents will be not alone when

I leave them and will go to another country. Of course I will miss

everybody but I want to have my own happiness!


do you have an International Airport in your city? please write me it&apos;s name an code.

or write me the name of the nearest INTERNATIONAL Airport to you.

I write you my emails from Internet cafe, I don&apos;t have my own computer.

If you want I can call you when I will be in Moscow, it would be nice

to talk to you. We don&apos;t have international calls here. I suppose in few

days I will fly to Moscow and start my trip! Today I will tell my parents

about you, I&apos;m sure they will be happy that someone is waiting for me over there!

There is no any messenger in this Cafe so we can only keep emailing

each other. I hope you are not getting bored to read my emails?

My address here is Russia, Nazarovo (Krasnoyarskiy kray), Komsomolskaya street 3, flat 8, post code(zip) - 662206.

So now you have a representation of who I am....

I just can tell you that I enjoy life and I try to live to the

fullest, I like to try new things. I&apos;m not that smart.. I was not that

good in mathematics, physics, biology and so on! I don&apos;t like to be

smart! But I&apos;m very tender, caring, artistic, faithful, decent person.

Sometimes I can be not well organized, I think everybody had it&apos;s own

minuses and pluses. I don&apos;t look any special qualities in a man. I just hope he will be

faithful to me and ready to create a happy family with me and I will

do everything to make him happy. I&apos;m looking for a soulmate!

ok... it&apos;s time to finish my email. I&apos;m sending a kiss by the wind to

you and if I sent it to the right destination you should receive it by

evening )))) I hope you will catch my kiss somehow )))

do you like my photos? Two eyes it is &quot;the luxury&quot;. It is joke of my father 

bye!

irina

----------
 Albert is feeling rather gregarious today... and playing 20 questions with Miss Rita Willams provided for a fair amount of fun. 


Good day Irina. It is so wonderful to have you in my life and I look forward to your email every day. I can barely until the time when I can roll over in the morning and kiss you, and Britney and Melissa and Tabitha, the three other young Christian women who share my enormous water bed with me, in the morning and have these conversations in person. Your back story is very interesting and I look forward to meeting your wonderful mother and father some day. Maybe we can take a trip back to Moscow over the Christmas holidays?

A bit more about myself. I live in Hollywood, California so yes there is a large International Airport in this city, Los Angeles International AIrport (LAX).

A native of New Orleans, I majored in occult studies at Tulane University and worked part-time as a fourth-grade teacher. In 1972, I moved to Los Angeles with my ex-wife, actress Sally Field (The Flying Nun) and landed an internship at the newly formed studio called Pergaroty Pictures. I have been with the Studio for over twenty-seven years, working in such capacities as Story Editor, Associate Producer (Frankenpimp; The Butcher, The Baker, The Candlestick Killer; Dr. Jugular), Executive Story Editor, Development Executive, Junior Director of Development, Director of Development, and Creative Executive. No trip to Purgatory is complete without a close inspection of my wide collection of voodoo dolls.

However, I actually began my Hollywood career with a bit part as a lovable grade school bully on The Gale Storm Show before turning my attention to a role in production at Pergatory. After working as an assistant director on dozens of Hollywood films (including Marry Me Quick, and Hell&apos;s Bells) I was chosen to direct the Academy Award nominated film, It Smelled Like Conch. I went on to direct Seven Arms to Hold You and Where Are You, Doc Holiday? before my no-nonsense approach to filmmaking caught the attention of Roger Corman. At Corman Films, I directed the thriller Moribund and eventually stepped into producing as I oversaw three dozen films, including Bulldozer and the B movie classic Nine Bullets In My Roommate&apos;s Gun. I returned to my &quot;roots in Pergatory&quot; as President in 1996 and the Studios&apos; continued success is due in great part to my current strong leadership.

But enough of me.. please answer the following so I can get to know
you even better.

Will you please answer the following questions for me in full detail so I start to get a better idea about you, who you are, and how I can make you happy?

1. What is the happiest moment of your entire life?

2. What do you think that McDonald&apos;s quarter pounders are made with 100% pure beef, or pre-processed soylent green manufactured from the carcasses of unemployed African Americans?

3. Was Saddaam Hussein an evil dictator with weapons of mass destruction or just a bad writer of romance novels with a really bad mustache?

4. What is your favorite clothing item?

5. Favorite holiday?

6. Favorite color?

7. Most annoying thing someone can do on a first date?


8. Favorite food (s)?

9. What kind of music makes you want to preform unnatural sex acts?

10. Do you sleep in pajamas or naked?

11. Finish this sentence: &quot;The scariest thing about being in love is..........&quot;

12. Have you ever met a Mexican?

13. Do you think that plants have feelings?

14. What is the latest you have slept in the last
month?

15. What is the largest number of men you have slept with at one time?

16. What is the largest number of women you have slept with at one time?


17. If Jesus rose from the dead would you be willing
to do a threesome with him?

18. Do you think size matters?

19. If you could do one thing in your life over again,
what decision or action would you change?

20. How many people have you slept with that you met
on bigchurch.com?

I will pray for you every day like I have since I received your first letter.

Albert


 I&apos;m figuring the next one comes with a request for some money!!!!!

 Today&apos;s email from my little Ruskie... amazing she hasn&apos;t asked me for money yet... But then again, I think she is still on script and has not read a word I&apos;ve written... in fact, she&apos;s sending me a bunch of stuff she&apos;s written before so tmack, you&apos;re right, we&apos;re probably writing to the same girl. 
--------------------

Hello again..!!
I just want to add few things... I think last time I wrote you not all
my thoughts... My mind is always in a mess when I write you because
it&apos;s hard to write everything to somebody who is so far away. I don&apos;t
remember if I wrote last time I&apos;ve never been married, don&apos;t have
kids but I love them and they love me!
And I want to tell you that I always wanted to find an older man.
Why? I have two answers..
Firstly, I think older men are much more serious and they can take
care of me, they are more experienced in life and can teach me many
things. Have you heard a saying &quot;The older the violin, the sweeter the
music&quot;? I believe in it... I think I&apos;m not that young already but I
don&apos;t have much experience in life and I want to have someone who has
more experience in life then me.
Secondly... maybe I&apos;m not right about it... but I want to be honest
I&apos;ve always had such worry... if I marry a man nearly my age...
and after some years I will become not that young and beautiful... I
think it&apos;s more hard for a woman to be attractive then for a man...
and he will find a younger mistress and I will become very miserable.
I don&apos;t want my man to be unfaithful. I know I can be faithful to my
man and I will never cheat on him.
But this is just my worries. This is not my goal. Please tell me if
you think you will love your woman at any age and not find a younger
one? Can you be faithful?
Also I want to tell you that I learned english in university, so I don`t use any translators, and I can speak english as good as I write on it. I hope we will have no problems in communications. I feel that you are very nice man I really want to meet you. If you will not like me or something else we can be just friends.
I hope I will get my work visa soon in Moscow and all documents and I
come to you! I don&apos;t have any area limits with this visa so I can work
where I want. I don`t know exact day of my arrival, but as soon as I
will know I will write it to you.
You know, I&apos;m just trying to be honest with you and write you all my
thoughts on different issues. Please be always honest with me also....
I will write you later, I will look if I have more nice photos to
send you.
Have a good day!

irina


 Okay, let&apos;s see what I&apos;ve got in my bag of tricks today.... 


oh my darling,

it pleases me so much that you wish to
be with me. You are everything I am looking for in a
woman. Beautiful, warm, kind, devoted. we are looking
for all the same things in life. A caring mate,
someone to be there, someone who will love you in
times and happiness and sorrow, who you can grow with
and share your beautiful lives together. One thing you
must know about me, though, is that, I might I put
this delicately.... sexually insatiable... there I
said it. If I do not make love six or seven times in a
night I cannot be truly satisfied... in fact, my
ex-wife passed away during the act of our lovemaking.
In order to let my partner have some needed rest,
which I totally appreciate, I often sleep with three
or four young Christian simultaneously so we can all
enjoy each other to the utmost, and from time to time
one or another can take a break while I continue my
lustful pursuits. I hope this does not pose a problem
for you. I will love you and only you and you will be
my wife and primary lover and your needs will always
come first, but I hope you will not mind sharing me
with other women. I will never cheat on you or stray
or pick up hookers when I am on location, but there
will usually be a number of other young women sharing
out bed with us at home, and I hope that is okay with
you. If you would like to engage in some girl on girl
sex as well, that would be okay too.

Talking about work, I see no reason for you to be a
shopgirl or work in a fast food restaurant. There are
plenty of jobs at my film studio. I have listed

 A little help here, dear mod... I am having a very pleasant time chatting with this bait, but I really have no idea where it is going? I keep waiting for &quot;Irina&quot; to hit me up for the stash, but thus far I keep receiving newsy missives that seem fairly apparent that the lad isn&apos;t reading a word that I&apos;ve written. I&apos;m trying my best to get said lad off his/her script, but I haven&apos;t quite yet figured out what it is ... a little advice please? thanks.

In the meantime, today&apos;s communiques: 

------------------------

Albert hello!
it&apos;s good to write you again! I think I&apos;m a lucky girl to meet such
good man as you in Internet! I hope I will be lucky enough to meet you
in the real life!!! yesterday I told my parents about you.
they said that now they don`tworry about me as before because now they know you are a kind man
and can help me if I will need your help. You can show me your city and
tell me about the life over there! I think I didn&apos;t write you I like cooking.
I will cook Russian cuisine for you! Pelmeni, vareniki, blini, borsch, okroshka!
You will like it! Besides Russian cuisine I like Italian and Mexican. I love
spaghetti and pizzza!!!!! mmmmmmm ! I can&apos;t live without it! I like
Mexican food because it&apos;s very spicy, although I don&apos;t cook Mexican
dishes too often. I&apos;ve been told my cooking is very tasty!
I like to cook cakes. my favorite is cheese-cake with raspberry! You
know... when I talk about food I&apos;m getting hungry ))) I eat everything
and I&apos;m not on any diets but usually I don&apos;t eat after 7 pm. This
helps me not to be fat! I can cook many tasty things for you when we will meet! You know..
almost all Russian men are like bears! They are so rude, they can&apos;t be nice
and polite, they don&apos;t want to have a family. I think you are not like them.
I like to go to the cinema! I really like to watch a good movie with
my friends. 50 percents of movies in our cinemas are Russian and about 50
American. actually my favorite actor is William Smith and I like all movies with
him. I&apos;ve watched &quot;I am legend&quot;Have you seen it?
could you recommend me any American movie so I can watch it?
What is your favorite movie and actor? Soooooooooooooooo......... what else could I say?
I have a driver&apos;s licence but I don&apos;t have a car. My father has a
russian car and he gives me his car sometimes.
I don`t like only cinema! I like theatre and opera too, I like ballet.
Unfortunately there is only one small theatre in my city and there is
nothing interesting. If I want to go to ballet, for example, I should
go to Krasnoyarsk, there sometimes can come famous Russian actors and
dancers but I can&apos;t go there often because it&apos;s quite expensive.
By, the way, one thing else about my trip. Agency will help me to rent a room
to stay near my future work. I will share this room with a few girls yet,
it is usual procedure and it helps to pay the rent (it will be cheaper).
And I have a question, is it normal if we will like each other may be it is
possible to live together?of course if you or somebody doesn&apos;t mind.
As you know I will stay there for three months but If I will like there I will be
able to prolong my trip. I think I will be able to improve my english and you can learn Russian
and I think it will help us to learn each other better,who knows.Do you have a big
wide bed?(joke). And now I have some good news for you! After sending this email I will
go home, take my packed bags and go to Krasnoyarsk! From there I will fly to Moscow! I`m
really afraid to fly on a plane! I hope my plane will not fall down! I&apos;m really afraid!
It is several hours from Krasnoyarsk to Moscow.
when I come to Moscow and settle down I will write you an email. I
hope today I will be able to write you. Please don&apos;t worry about me
if you don&apos;t hear from me today, that will mean I was not able to
find a place to stay and I will write you tomorrow.
In Moscow I will spend a week or maybe even more, I should make all
final arrangements with my documents and after it I will come to you!
I&apos;ve never been to Moscow before and I&apos;m so nervous now... I&apos;ve never
went somewhere alone and now I should go alone to such big city!
I really want to talk to you by phone, but as I don`t have a mobile
phone, I will find a public phone in Moscow with international calls.
you know... I had such great desire to start my trip already.. and now
I feel myself like a newborn kitten who has even didn&apos;t open it&apos;s
eyes... I just want to hug my mommy and don&apos;t want to go anywhere...
but I know that&apos;s my dream to start a new life and I will try to turn
in to reality! Soon you will hear some news from me from
Moscow!!!!!!!!

love you and kisses! hope I&apos;m the only for you!

I send you photos!
your the butterfly irina

-----------------------------

 Albert replies in a jiffy... oh, you should see this girl&apos;s pictures!!!!!!! If I could only figure out how to post them. (I&apos;ll be happy to forward them to anyone who knows how to put them up!)
 

oh, my darling Irina...

the light of my life, the moth
to my flame, the puss in my boil... how thrilling it
is to awaken each morning to your email...

I am so pleased to know that you love to eat as much
as I do... food is one on my passions. In fact I have
had gastric bypass surgery three times so my weight is
currently down to 325 pounds, as low as it as been
since I was in high school. THe doctor says as long as
I stay below 500 pounds I can have the procedure at
least two more times. The staples in my stomach don&apos;t
hurt particularly much... only when I roll over. So I
hope you don&apos;t mind being on top most of the time when
we make love...

And of course you are welcome to stay with me in my
Beverly Hills mansion. However, remember the caveat I
mentioned yesterday about the nubile, young Christian
starlets who share my bed with me. I am certain that
our Bible study sessions will prove most stimulating.

I am glad you are a big film fan. As you know I run a
major motion picture studio and I am sure you are
familiar with most of my work. I have attached at
filmography so you can remember some of your
favorites, and give you the chance to go buy the DVD
of those you have not seen... Although I did not
produce I Am Legend and have never actually worked
with William Smith there are a large number of African
Americans named Smith that I do know well: Bessie Smith,
Emmitt Smith, Adam Smith, Patti Smith, Smith Barney,
Smith and Wesson,The Smith Brothers of cough lozenge
fame, Granny Smith of apple fame, and more. I will be pleased
to introduce to any and all. They are regulars at my gala movie
premieres.

 Yep, it looks like we&apos;re all hooked into the exact same scammer... I&apos;m still waiting for the &quot;I need money for a plane ticket&quot; riff, so, for the time being, I&apos;m willing to play it out, and see where I can take it. Mike, I got the same response as you--- word for word.

 So she&apos;s lonely, eh?...Okay, here&apos;s mine... 

oh darling... your pictures of Moscow are almost as
beautiful as you are. i can&apos;t wait to see you here in
Los Angeles. The airport here is called Los Angeles
International AIrport and the code is LAX.

do not be worried about a lack of companionship and
friendship as you start your journey in the new world.
i will always be here as will my friends and
colleagues... soon they will be as close to you as
your family and friends in Russia.

let me tell you a bit about some of them so you get a
better feel for them in advance. I will have a big
party in your honor at my mansion in Hollywood when
you get here to celebrate. Perhaps you will cook some
of your delicious dishes to add to the festivities and
to introduce my friends to your culture. I can&apos;t wait
for us all to meet and become one happy family
together.

Steve Carter

Steve is a 1985 graduate of NYU&apos;s prestigious film
school. After his education, he went to work for indie
producer Flash Corrigan. As the Chief Development
Executive for Corrigan Flicks, Carter discovered
acclaimed director Lionel Washington and introduced
him to Pergatory Studios for the jointly-produced hit
Gimme Some! Steve left Flash in 1992 with nine
produced films under his belt and took a post at
sitcom actor Frank Wilson&apos;s company Laugh-A-Lot. Under
a deal at Warner Brothers, Frank and Steve produced
the Little House series. In 1995, Carter set up a
company with up-and-coming writer Will. In 1998, I
hand-picked Steve as his chief story editor and
personal protege. He reports directly to Ms. Virginia
Grey, my personal assistant.



Helen Combs

Helen got her entertainment start when she landed a
job with the New Jersey-based Ultimate Cage Fights in
promotions right out of the University of Alabama.
There she developed an interest in various fighting
techniques and trained in Cra-Ma-Ga.She was the New
Jersey Amateur Martial Arts Champion for women 18-25
in 1992. After two years with UCF, Anita moved west
and worked in sales for Kodak. From there, she worked
in development for Ben Vereen and moved over to the
Pergatory team in 1997. She is a wonderful asset to
the company as she discovered the script for the
upcoming Murder of the Month Club.


Sandy Day

Sandy comes to Pergatory with an extensive and
impressive background in the Theater. Trained as a
dancer and stage actor at Julliard, he went on to
perform with several highly- acclaimed New York Dance
Repertoires. His performing career culminated with his
role as the Swan in the Boston Classic Dance Troop&apos;s
worldwide tour of the &quot;Ugly Duckling.&quot; Sandy walked
away from this career when his twin brother, also an
acclaimed dancer, died tragically while on tour in
Russia. The dance world&apos;s loss was Hollywood&apos;s gain.
Mr. Day came to Pergatory after working two years for
Richard Simmons&apos; Productions. He ascended the
production ranks here rather quickly as a Production
Manager, Line Producer and a Post-Production
Coordinator under Arnie Reisner. He is now in charge
of our day-to-day production.


Anita Dreyer

A native of Toronto, Canada, Anita majored in new
technology at the University of Vermont. After a
misunderstanding with the FBI over a hacking charge
was dismissed, Anita came to Pergatory to spearhead
the Studio&apos;s arrival on the information superhighway.
Dubbed &quot;the hardest working woman in the southwest
sector of the lot,&quot; Anita is virtually unrecognizable
without her laptop and telephone headset. As she is
quick to remind us, it was her ambition and
perseverance that put the new Pergatory site in
motion. She deserves big congratulations, on being
named my &quot;VIP of the month&quot;!


Frank Fenton

Nobody in the industry knows props like Frank Fenton
and Pergatory is lucky to have him in charge of one of
Hollywood&apos;s most extensive collections. In addition to
maintaining dozens of chainsaws, swords, axes, and
machine guns, Frank spends two months of the year
scouring the globe for new and exotic weapons and
machinery to use in the latest Pergatory projects.
Frank&apos;s passion for details and authenticity has made
Pergatory the only remaining studio to use real
weapons in many of our films. Mr. Fenton has also been
a great resource for producer Spencer Mitchell&apos;s home
collection of movie props from his past hits.

And there are so many more I&apos;ll tell you about later. These
people are like family to me and will be to you too.

Oh, and another bit of very good news. I was speaking
with my next door neighbor Hugh Hefner, a very close friend
who is in the magazine publishing industry. and
Hef said that he too might be able to help find you a
job with one of his magazines.

You do not need much experience, but Hef did ask if
with your next set of pictures you could include
several of your bare bodacious bodonkadonks... he
says it would be be most helpful.

Until we&apos;re together my princess...

Yours always,

Albert

 No matter how hard I try to shake this lad, I can&apos;t seem to get get (s)him off script!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

albert hello!!! how are you? today I had a wonderful dream, that we
finally meet, I feel myself like the happiest girl in the world!!!
In Moscow its &quot;rather hot weather&quot;,
about +16`C, but I feel myself so alone. 
everyone rush somewhere and I don`t know anybody here.
Today I was in a travel agency, all my documents are ready.
Now they are checking a possible flight to your airport.
they will give me all information (date and time of my arrival,
terminal etc.) tomorrow I think. Now I will continue to see Moscow,
like a tourist. In Moscow there are so many different museums!
I will go to The State Tretyakov Gallery (The National Museum of
Russian Fine Art).
It is not far from the Kremlin, there should be a lot of tourists
from all over the world. I read about this gallery before, its collection
contains near 130 000 works of painting, sculpture and graphics.
there there are pictures in cost 250 million dollars!!!!!
It should be really amazing!!! Ok, I send you a thousand kisses and will wait for your
message!!!!

yours irina


 I&apos;m beginning to grow a bit frustrated...
I&apos;m thinking of shaking things up by calling her a two-timing
whore and accusing her of sending the same email to my brother
Mike who is serving 20-life in Vaccaville for armed robbery and
beastiality and asked nybeef if I could copy the same
exactly worded post Irina sent to him... his advice is to hold
off with the email.. that she&apos;ll probably ask for money within the
next 3 emails.. we&apos;ll see..... 




oh Irina, my sweet little pirogi...

do not be lonely.

my friends make you feel just like you are part of the
Pergatory family.

maybe you will feel less like you are by yourself if I
tell you more about the people in my life, you will
make your life a more fulfilling one too.

Ira Krane

As my partner L. Ron Hubbard explains, &quot;it never hurts
to have someone from M.I.T. on the team.&quot; Dubbed the
&quot;mad scientist&quot; by those wacky folks in accounting,
Ira is responsible for negotiating and overseeing
projects beyond our American borders. Arnie&apos;s career
shifted from physics to film when he was hired as a
consultant on The Right Stuff and he worked as several
major studios before finding a home at Pergatory.
Arnie credits his fluency in eleven languages and
ability to memorize currency exchange rates to his
top-secret work with the United States Government
during the Cold War.

Roland F. Lake

Rollo is a graduate of Princeton University and Yale
Law. After three years in the Dade County, Florida
DA&apos;s office, he joined Pergatory in 1977. Rollo has
consistently mixed his corporate and prosecution
skills to make the Studio a fun, smoothly-functioning
and safe environment for all its employees. In
addition to his numerous duties in the legal
department for Pergatory, Rollo earned several
producer credits on Studio films, of which is he is
extremely proud. He was a consultant on several highly
publicized defense cases in Los Angeles county for a
number of top profile clients, including members of
O.J. Simpson&apos;s &quot;dream team&quot;.

Natasha Lee

Natasha is a recent graduate of Pepperdine University
(2007) where she stared on the varsity Volleyball and
Water Polo teams and majored in Criminology. Although
she has aspirations of a long career in film
development and is toying with the notion of Law
School, many people tell her that she should use her
stunning beauty to work in films. She has appeared in
two minor roles for the studio, The Boxcutter and
There&apos;s Something About Carrie. Natasha is the only
daughter of the late Hollywood starlet Brenda Lee.


Floyd Malone

Floyd got his start as a young screenwriter after a
brief stint at USC, where he majored in zoology. While
working as a freelance script reader at Paramount, his
first script, about a demented zookeeper, was optioned
by the Studio. Subsequently, he was hired to write the
Palm d&apos;Ores winner The Creature With Seven Arms, and
Where Are You, Doc Holiday? In 1981, he married
Pergatory starlet Daniell Rangler and Floyd went on to
scribe several more screenplays for various studios.
With three handsome sons to feed, Floyd later put down
the pen and focused his efforts on producing as a
development executive at Universal. In 1993, he
rejoined the us as Vice President of Production and
went on to greenlight such hits as Deathworld, Don&apos;t
Go Downstairs Again, and cult classic Bloodthirsty
Vampires From Deep Outer Space.

I hope that knowing about my friends will make you
feel a little less lonely.

P.S. Hef wonders when you are going to send the photos
showing your bare Ruskie breasts.

Love you forever,

Albert

 Kudos to NYBeef for predicting &quot;Irina&apos;s&quot; next move... this came today... 


albert, hello! excuse me that I could not write to you earlier.....
I&apos;m writing to you as soon as I can!!!!!! I was busy with many
arrangements!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! also I had to repeat some words
for my English test and I finally passed my test today morning!!!
today I was in the travel agency and I received an information about my trip!
I will be very thankful to you if you can meet me at the Airport!

&gt;&gt;I will arrive to you on Monday, 12 May&lt;&lt;

more in detail look at the end of the letter. I copied the information of agency

I hope so much it&apos;s a good day for you to meet me!

I am so glad to see that we are almost near our goal,and our meeting
wait for us. I think I will call you from airport before my flight.
You know I booked tickets on Monday, 12 May flight and I will buy them before
my intervew. People from embassy must be sure that I am not going to stay illegally,
so I need to buy roundtrip tickets (with returning date).
I wanted to ask you about electronic tickets but they tell that
I can&apos;t use because it is their businees to arrange all travel details
and they have some extra money from all the things,
you see it is just business.I think that you will be able to help me
because I don&apos;t know anybody here and only you are my hope now,
I think everything in your hands and I believe that you will not leave
me here alone.please borrow some money. I am sure I will be able to return all your money
back after a few weeks, I will get salary and I will collect the sum I own from you.
To be fair I am not sure I know what to say because I hate to ask but
now I have no different way, you see.Please help me it is only money
and much more important if we will meet in person I will do my
best, you won`t be disappoined. I see that it sounds a little crazy
but I can&apos;t believe that in the worst case I have to return
home,they all will laugh at me.I think it rests with you to decide and I feel that
you will help me because you are kind. I have about 300 US dollars yet and I think
I need about 980 US dollars from your side with all travel needs and living here till my
flight! (I had 1180 dollars, but flight from Krasnoyarsk, opening visa, medical
insurance and all travel needs costed about 800 dollars).
For truth I did not expect I will need to buy roundtrip tickets, but now
I see that its a very strict rule.
I was sure that my mom will help me becasue she promised but now she
sent letter that it is possible only in a few months or so because of
family problems.and she can&apos;t send transfer now.I was in the bank to
try to ask them about loan but they tell I have to have something to stay them
and I have nothing to stay because I have only a few
dress and things,some perfume and it is all I have,and small gift for you from
russia with love.

please send it today by Western Union or Money Gram
I will write you details:

&gt;&gt;!!!&lt;&lt;

send it to russia, Irina Mitina !!!!This is my full name!

When you&apos;re filling Western Union (or MG) form it is not necessary
to write down the destination city because i don&apos;t have a permanent address over here.
Also I&apos;ve got an advice to send you a scan copy of my passport
in case you need to confirm my details.

this is my full name used in all official documents. They said this is all info you need.
But please for any case write down more info. The address where I&apos;m staying:
kutuzovskiy prospekt 37 - 9, post code (zip) 121170. I rent a small room In an apartment of an old policeman here, it&apos;s
cheaper then hotel.The address of the closest Western Union (or MoneyGram) here is:

&quot;sitibank&quot; moscow, kutuzovskiy prospekt 41

I have some money but it&apos;s not enough to complete my trip.
Please send me 980 US dollars and I will complete my trip!
After it please write me all details about the transfer -

your FULL NAME and Money Transfer Control Number.!!

I will call you as soon as I receive it.
When I receive the money I will pay for my trip and only then
the embassy will put all final stamps on my documents.
I&apos;ve bought you few souvenirs with Russian attributes!!! I&apos;m
sure you will like them! If you need something more please let me
know, they are not expensive. Also I bought two boxes of Russian
chocolate! I hope so much when I come to you we will like each other!
You are already very special to me!
Please when I come to you tell me more about you and your country!
I will listen to everything you tell me and I will do everything you
tell me! I trust you really much!
I hope you will not do something to hurt my feelings.... I
think you are really good man. I will never do anything to hurt yours!!!
By statistics Moscow is the second most expensive city in the
world after Tokyo... everything is so expensive here... and I have
to pay for my rent and food and buy tickets.. please help me..
Sorry if I missed something or didn&apos;t comment please let me know
I was so busy with with all preparations!!!!

Irina

 I know that eventually I will have to succumb to some bogus Western Union mumbo jumbo... and would appreciate if someone would let me know how many numbers/letters are needed to comprise a WU confirmation code... in the meantime, Albert is a very connected man in Russia... he has other plans. 


Irina my soon to be heavily bathed in excrement
beauty,

thank you for your update...

how I can&apos;t wait to see you in a leather boustier with
a red ball strapped in your mouth.

i am so pleased that you have arranged your flight
schedule to be with me and appreciate the high costs
involved with international travel.

of course I am happy to help you with you expenses.
and please do not worry about repaying me, I plan to
take it out in trade and then put you out on the
streets of Hollywood. Just think in no time you will
have gone to a small town girl in Russia to a crack
whore in Hollywood... from a small apartment in a
policeman&apos;s dacha to your very own corner where you
can turn tricks like a circus clown.

one small problem...

Western Union cancelled my membership due to a number
of questionable business practices, so I find it best
for both of us if we transact directly through my
Moscow attorneys.

Many US film companies work with:

Hogan&amp;Hartson LLP
Ambassador Building
14, Prechistenskiy Pereulok
119034 Moscow
Russia
Phone: +7.495.797.9900
Fax: +7.495.797.9961

My personal lawyer is Dmitry V. Zhdanov, head of
Corporate, Securities, and Finance. He has
authorization to give you 2500 American dollars so you
can upgrade to first class to make your trip a
pleasant one. He also has copies of your pictures so
he will recognize you when you go to his office.

He is most anxious to make your acquaintance.

As for me, I can&apos;t wait to see you in America.

Love always, Albert

 Hello guys,
I like the idea of a unified front. I find it hard to believe that someone in this Google age really thought that they wouldn&apos;t get found out. Below in the latest message I recieved.

Subject: My feelings

Hello!!! i&apos;m so excited to write you again!!!!!!!!!! I&apos;m in Moscow! You can&apos;t
imagine how happy I am because I already started my trip to you!
I still cannot believe I&apos;ve done it! WoW! As I wrote you I was scared
to fly on the plane but everything was OK and I&apos;m still alive ))))
Moscow is a really big city! I&apos;ve been told the population of Moscow
is about 10 million of people! From the Airport I went by bus... it
was so long way... about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I&apos;ve seen so many nice
places in Moscow while going by bus!
When I got off the plane in the Moscow Airport policeman asked me about
passport and he looked at me like I am an enemy )))
I think all people here are a little crazy because of terrorism.
everything here is very expensive, not like in my city... and
everywhere are big crowds of people! Everywhere is so many people! I
feel uncomfortable because of it but I hope I will be OK soon.
I found a place to stay, I rent a room from an old policeman. He is about
70 years old. he said his wife died 2 years ago and he
doesn`t have money to live, so he give in rent rooms in her apartment.
He is very nice man. He said I have to be very careful.
You know... he said many girls from small cities come to big cities, they are looking for a
better future and fortune but because they are from small cities they
can`t imagine that their way to find the happiness can be not so easy as they
thought... and some of them can end up as prostitutes or something
like that. He said I should be careful when I will meet you!! But I
don&apos;t worry about you! I feel with all my heart you are really nice man!
Sorry I wrote you about my worries.. I have nobody to write about it.
my parents are worried enough about me and I don&apos;t want
to make them to worry more. I think that&apos;s really good I&apos;ve met you! I
can write you about everything. I miss my parents... but I&apos;m getting better with every hour ))
now I&apos;m very hungry and I will go and eat something.
I`m sending for you some photos of Moscow that I found in internet.
I hope to you it it will be interesting. Red flags and ties it is symbolics of holiday.
This tradition originates since 1917. holiday &quot; May, 1 &quot; it is considered day of the working people.

please confirm the name of international airport (and his code) and be sure you wrote it right.
I am afraid to make any mistake... I hope everything will be fine.
please write me as soon as possible!See you soon! Great kiss from Moscow!!

Irina

I tried moving a couple of Pics over but can&apos;t get them in, sorry.

 I think that giving the address of my lawyers in Moscow, and suggesting that she pick up the booty in cash may have scared them off. Dmitry V. Zhdanov sent her a letter on &quot;official&quot; Hogan&amp;Hartson LLP letterhead to schedule an appointment time and never received a response.

Hope some of you other Irina suitors keep me up to date on her latest exploits.

 I finally got the request for money this past Saturday. I wish I could copy it in but also got a copy of the supposed passport. I got onlilne and looked up a club in Moscow along with a strippers name and give it to her as a contact. and of course the emails stick to script.

&gt;&gt;I will arrive to you on Sunday, 18 May&lt;&lt;

more in detail look at the end of the letter. I copied the information of agency

I hope so much it&apos;s a good day for you to meet me!

I am so glad to see that we are almost near our goal,and our meeting
wait for us. I think I will call you from airport before my flight.
You know I booked tickets on Sunday, 18 May flight and I will buy them before
my intervew. People from embassy must be sure that I am not going to stay illegally,
so I need to buy roundtrip tickets (with returning date).
I wanted to ask you about electronic tickets but they tell that
I can&apos;t use because it is their businees to arrange all travel details
and they have some extra money from all the things,
you see it is just business.I think that you will be able to help me
because I don&apos;t know anybody here and only you are my hope now,
I think everything in your hands and I believe that you will not leave
me here alone.please borrow some money. I am sure I will be able to return all your money
back after a few weeks, I will get salary and I will collect the sum I own from you.
To be fair I am not sure I know what to say because I hate to ask but
now I have no different way, you see.Please help me it is only money
and much more important if we will meet in person I will do my
best, you won`t be disappoined. I see that it sounds a little crazy
but I can&apos;t believe that in the worst case I have to return
home,they all will laugh at me.I think it rests with you to decide and I feel that
you will help me because you are kind. I have about 300 US dollars yet and I think
I need about 980 US dollars from your side with all travel needs and living here till my
flight! (I had 1180 dollars, but flight from Krasnoyarsk, opening visa, medical
insurance and all travel needs costed about 800 dollars).
For truth I did not expect I will need to buy roundtrip tickets, but now
I see that its a very strict rule.
I was sure that my mom will help me becasue she promised but now she
sent letter that it is possible only in a few months or so because of
family problems.and she can&apos;t send transfer now.I was in the bank to
try to ask them about loan but they tell I have to have something to stay them
and I have nothing to stay because I have only a few
dress and things,some perfume and it is all I have,and small gift for you from
russia with love.

Thomas, please send it today by Western Union or Money Gram
I will write you details:

&gt;&gt;!!!&lt;&lt;

send it to russia, Irina Mitina !!!!This is my full name!

When you&apos;re filling Western Union (or MG) form it is not necessary
to write down the destination city because i don&apos;t have a permanent address over here.
Also I&apos;ve got an advice to send you a scan copy of my passport
in case you need to confirm my details.

this is my full name used in all official documents. They said this is all info you need.
But please for any case write down more info. The address where I&apos;m staying:
kutuzovskiy prospekt 37 - 9, post code (zip) 121170. I rent a small room In an apartment of an old policeman here, it&apos;s
cheaper then hotel.The address of the closest Western Union (or MoneyGram) here is:

&quot;sitibank&quot; moscow, kutuzovskiy prospekt 41

I have some money but it&apos;s not enough to complete my trip.
Please send me 980 US dollars and I will complete my trip!
After it please write me all details about the transfer -

your FULL NAME and Money Transfer Control Number.!!

I will call you as soon as I receive it.
When I receive the money I will pay for my trip and only then
the embassy will put all final stamps on my documents.
I&apos;ve bought you few souvenirs with Russian attributes!!! I&apos;m
sure you will like them! If you need something more please let me
know, they are not expensive. Also I bought two boxes of Russian
chocolate! I hope so much when I come to you we will like each other!
You are already very special to me!
Please when I come to you tell me more about you and your country!
I will listen to everything you tell me and I will do everything you
tell me! I trust you really much!
I hope you will not do something to hurt my feelings.... I
think you are really good man. I will never do anything to hurt yours!!!
By statistics Moscow is the second most expensive city in the
world after Tokyo... everything is so expensive here... and I have
to pay for my rent and food and buy tickets.. please help me..
Sorry if I missed something or didn&apos;t comment please let me know
I was so busy with with all preparations!!!!

Irina

 Ok guys haven&apos;t checked my email in a couple of days, but today I found a very heartfelt note, check it out, Now I will send the bogus Western Union reciept I made. If you look below this message you&apos;ll see what i sent her to get this one.

hello, my honey! ok! I’m very glad that you replied me so fast.

I thought that telling about money, I have lost you.

In Russia it’s often occurs with men.

I suggest it is for hard economic situation in our country.

Men don’t need women with their love.

I don’t want to believe that the quantity of real men diminishes.

Dear, I do not wish to give you a words of good bye!

I am sorry about all the problems with the money!

But without your help I will not be able to fly to you.

My relatives will no longer be able to help me out.

Mama gave me almost all the money that she had to

help me out with this journey.

If you can not help me, I will be returning to home.

But I do not want to be lonely again.

I do not want to return home.

I do not want to stay in Moscow either.

I do not want anyone but you.

More than anything else, I would like to continue the trip!

I want you! I want you to surround me with your tenderness, warmth and care.

I certainly think about the future. I want us to be together.

I go to sleep and I wake up together with the thoughts about you.

They are not leaving my head.

More to that, I’d like to wake up in your arms every day.

I’d like to be sure that you really need me now and in the future.

I just want to look into your eyes.

I want to feel your warm breath.

I want to see your smile and know that this smile is for me.

I want to be waken up by you rather than some kind of alarm clock.

I want to be your sunshine.

I want you to warm your hands up in the back pockets of my jeans.

I want you to pay me with your kisses for the rental of my jeans pockets.

I want to belong to you and. I am yours and you’re mine.

I want to believe you and never question anything you say.

I want to hear your voice. I want to get to your inner thoughts.

I want to be everything you need. I want you to know all these things.

I want you to love me.

Can’t wait for the moment I board the plane and start my final journey to you.

I am sick without you. Thank you for your letter and kind words!

I am looking forward to hearing some good news from you.

I will wait money transfer control number and your full name...

Hope you can help me out and give me your support.

My request for help from one hand is the opportunity to come to you,

and from other hand is the approval of seriousness of your plans.

I’m sorry that my confidence in our victory against the problems differs a bit from yours.

Because you are a man and I am a woman.

If everything were on contrary, the world would go upside down.

I will back all money to the last cent without doubt,

and if everything will be ok, I will stand for you forever.

That’s why I ask you a question: are you serious in your intensions?

If yes, write me soon. I hope very much that I provoked sympathy in you.




thank you Thomas, Irina




my date:

Irina Mitina

The address of the closest Western Union (or MoneyGram) here is:

&gt; I cannot contain myself any longer, I count the minutes until your

&gt; arrival. I had enclosed the information you need to collect the

&gt; money. until I checked the current flights coming in from Russia

&gt; into the airport closest to me and found none, Is this a game to

&gt; you, playing with my emotions. Please explain the money is waiting

&gt; for pickup but I cannot in good conscious release this money until I

&gt; know you are truly coming to me. Please my love I am becoming scared

&gt; as the minutes get closer to your arrival and need some reassurance.

&gt; I am sure the flight information was an oversight and you just

&gt; misstyped what you were told. Please confirm the times of your

&gt; flights and flight numbers so I can be on time to pick you up and

&gt; enjoy our first night together. Please let me know which airprt you

&gt; chose to fly into since there are several in the area. Again confirm

&gt; this information and I will promptly send you the Wetsern Union

&gt; tracking number so you may pick up

&gt; the money. I made the amount out to $2500 so you cand travel in

&gt; class and enjoy whatever stopovers you may have. Hope to hear from you soon

 Okay... so I open my yahoo account today and who do I have an email from but.... IRINA. New Name. New Email addy. Same awesome picture. 

Hi! I&apos;m a single girl and I&apos;m 26 years old. Please take a look at my
pictures and let me know if you like them! I live in Russia and I&apos;m
going to come to your country and work over there very soon! I don&apos;t know anybody over there and I thought it would be great to meet someone who is open to anything (as I am!). I would be happy to be friends, lovers or create a serious relationship! We will see what happens!
I hope you will write me back and I will write more info about myself
and send more photos!!!!!!!!!!! I am writing from my friend&apos;s email
address, so please make sure you do not reply directly to this email.
Email me at tbulletpwx@yahoo.co.uk only. if you don&apos;t use my personal email address then I won&apos;t be able to read your reply and write you back. So it is very important that you get it right. Ok, I guess it is now your turn. Hope to hear from you today. Bye!! btw, i got your email from dating website. Natalia

 This is excellent!!!! So I send her the same exact reply I sent her last time with one minor modification. My new moniker is Hug M. Hefner. And this time I&apos;m settling for nothing less than her tits. 

My dearest,

The picture you shared with me made me tumescent with anticpation... the thought of comforting myself with the flesh of a woman as beautiful as you makes me praise the Lord in the loudest voice I can raise.

What would ever cause as beautiful a young woman as yourself to have to join a single christian&apos;s sex website like thebigchurch.com is beyond me. There must be hundreds of young acolytes who would be blessed to be with a woman like you. The fact that you chose me must be ordained in the eyes of the Lord that we are meant in his wisdom to be together for eternity and I will share myself with you souly as I hope you will with me.

I have been so lonely for so long since my dear wife passed away, and though I have met other worthy women on The Big Church.com Christian sex site, I have not felt compelled to spill my seed with any of
them, which compounds my lonliness. This big house is so empty without the sounds of another&apos;s laughter and I long for the pattter of little feet running and playing in the gardens and splashing in the swimming pool. I would love to have more pictures of you so I can fantasize about our life together in the busom of our Lord Jesus Christ, our savior, and hope you will share your fantasies with me.

Yours,

Hugh M. Heffner

I do not know how to upload &apos;her&apos; images here, of which I have about a dozen. I&apos;ve also saved all of our emails&amp;I was expecting &apos;her&apos; to arrive in the UK next Tuesday 8th July. I became suspicious when &apos;she&apos; asked for money&amp;I Googled &quot;Russian Scams&quot; thank God! Not before Western Unioning £250 to St. Petersburg which cost me £77 with another £250 to follow tomorrow - which it won&apos;t!!! I refused to give her the WU Control Number until I had proof from the British Consul of her Visa&amp;travel documents by email&amp;a personal telephone call from her. No further contact has been made. Should I inform the police??? I need a mentor! RAGE!

 Hello rage. Well done on catching this one early.

Be thankful you&apos;re only mad and not heart broken and penniless. These people don&apos;t care about the hurt they cause and lives they ruin.

Am i to understand she hasn&apos;t picked up the money? If not you should go and get it refunded fast , i don&apos;t think they need the MTCN to pick up the money anyway. Also, many WU workers can be bribed to release it. Go do it now.

Well, finish reading this first.

A mentor will help you to bait. You can get one HERE . Add your post to the bottom. Whilst you are waiting for one to be assigned, there is lots to read. Go through each forum and read the stickies. A good list will be in your welcome PM.

It would be really great if you were to post your story at www.scamwarners.com They are our sister site and your info on &quot;her&quot;
may help other victims.

If you want to bait, don&apos;t bait her. You might still be emotionally attached to her and it is hard to cut away. Go to the surplus and find one you like the sound of. Then get a new email addy, a gmail one with all fake details is best. Proceed to straight bait. By then you should have a mentor who will help you, but you can read some of the lectures at the Eater university to get some more ideas.

Take it slow and have fun.

I hope to see you on scamwarners.
