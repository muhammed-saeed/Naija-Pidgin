What is the ghetto-est fast food restaurant in your area?
 I mean consistenly bad service. I live in Central Texas and have to say that Jack in the Box wins it hands down with Church&apos;s Chicken a close second. Service at Jack in the Box is soooooooo slooooooow! The people taking the order are just beyond ghetto and don&apos;t know what customer service is.

 Asker&apos;s Rating: Asker&apos;s Comment: All of your answers were great. Nika1-I&apos;ve always wondered about that about Church&apos;s and Popeyes-they pile up all of that chicken-how long does it take to just put it in a box?!

But Girly-seriously-putting weave on in the back-that takes the GHETTO CAKE! Unbelievable.

 The McDonald&apos;s close to where I live. One time I ordered, and it took literally 10 minutes to get my food. The girl who took my order completely forgot about me. At the same time, she was taking other customers and was giving them their orders, with extra food.

She was nice enough to apologize to me, and give me free fries.

 Sorry, don&apos;t eat fast food (well hardly ever) and don&apos;t live anywhere near ghetto areas. Worst service: Arby&apos;s, the one and only time I went the girl at the counter could barely understand English.

 The Wendy&apos;s in my area seems to like to hire a lot of parolees and halfway house people. They have to be, I go there all the time and the ghetto gangbanger crew changes monthly. I work at another quick service kind of place, and our turnover is low and we hire good people. I live in Michigan, so we have our pick of the litter. I even had to give one of the bangers a box of Captain Crunch, I felt so sorry for him.

 A KFC a few blocks where I live its horrible the employees barely understand english! rofl. But the chicken is great because they make you wait for a long time and starve therefore you&quot;ll be forced to say the chicken is delicious.

 I agree with Jack in the Box. Service was so bad, the one in my area is closed down. I could name a few others, especially since I live in the south, so everything, especially it seems like people doing their jobs, is sooooo sloooow!

 Yeah unfortunately Church&apos;s Chicken bites the big one here in Florida as well. Up in New York they are about one of the best to go to, but not down here. Totally different attitude down here.

 The fast food place with the worst customer service in my community is Taco Bell. Most other Taco Bells I have been to are really good and fast, but not this one.

 I don&apos;t know, but the place I saw in the movie&quot;Dont Be A Menace to South Central While Drinkin&apos;Your Juice In Da Hood&quot;, there was a place called&quot;Chicken and Oil Change&quot;--THAT had to have been the&quot;ghetto-ist&quot;eating establishment that I had ever seen!
