We enjoy the bagel sandwiches with scrambled eggs and bacon. This is a fun place with good food. We are glad they are opening another (4th) location in Topeka soon.

After finishing my Saturday shopping early, I stopped in and tried their steak and egg on sourdough bread sandwich. It was awesome! I will go back for more. I just wish they opened earlier as I usually am at work by 6:30, when they open.
