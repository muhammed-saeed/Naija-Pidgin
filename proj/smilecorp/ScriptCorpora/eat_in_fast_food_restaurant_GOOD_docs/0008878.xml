 Love Your Sweet Tooth? Count On Getting Sick!

Some people ask me if they should stop eating sweet produce such as oranges and carrots, because they want to cut back on sugar. I always tell them to consider that not all sugars are created equal. One class of sugars is natural (from whole foods) and the other is unnatural (added by food companies).

 

SO–don’t limit the natural sugars. Though an orange may contain 12 grams of sugar, it also provides vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fibre–all which combine synergistically to absorb more slowly than its refined sugars. And natural sugar does not raise the risk of diabetes the way its refined counterpart does, so no health organization recommends limiting the natural variety. Fill up on wholesome foods–vegetables, fruits, dates, figs, etc. They’ll fill that sweet craving and are healthy to boot.

 

Added sugars should not exceed  10% of total calories (about 40-45 grams daily), according to a report released by the World Health Organization entitled“ Diet Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases .”However, I recommend that you scale back even further for good health, because even small amounts of unnatural elements in the body add up over time and suppress bodily processes.

 

The makers of processed foods don’t care though. Every year they add more sugars to their products, up to the point where Statistics Canada says we consume about 23 teaspoons of them daily–based on an average 2000-calorie diet. This doesn’t include all the other added sugars we get from corn sweeteners (liquid candy)–the main ingredient in pop, nor the sugars in fruit juices.

 

 

Add it all up and by any mathematical standard, some people are eating more than half their body weight in sugars every year. That’s a whole lot of calories, with subsequent obesity and related health problems like diabetes and heart disease. 

 

How can you tell if a food contains added sugar? Read the ingredient list! “Free sugars”are all monosaccharides and disaccharides (including refined sugars from cane, beet and corn) . Look for:

 

 brown sugar corn sweetener corn syrup dextrose glucose high fructose corn syrup invert sugar malt syrup molasses sucrose table sugar sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices turbinado amazake sorbitol carob powder 
 
 

 “Food companies have to make food as cheap as possible so that more people will buy it and they do that by putting in corn sweeteners. The more corn sweeteners you have in a food, the cheaper it is on a per calorie basis.” ( CBC Marketplace–Sugar Surprise, March 9, 2004 ). 
 
 

ADDITIONALLY, look for added starches in food (which thicken a product cheaply) but also thicken your waistline, being quickly absorbed as energy and acting like sugars in the body.

 

If you really want to become healthy, don’t worry about reading labels. Yes, you read that right! Start eating wholesome foods which are not manufactured in a can or a box. Start cooking with your own ingredients and stop letting others do the work for you. That way you control what goes into your food and ultimately your own health. If you don’t like what I say because you deem yourself too busy, then count on getting sick and ultimately contracting a disease. Let’s face it, your health should be more important than a few extra hours at your job. You can’t enjoy the good things in life when lying in bed sick. Trust me on this, I’ve seen it too many times. And though I’m not a betting man, I’ll bet those sick people wished their hearing had been a lot better while they were still healthy!

 What Happens In Your Body After Drinking A Coke? 
 Thursday, July 24th, 2008 at 3:21 am  Leave your comment 
 


Have you ever wondered why Coke comes with a smile? It’s because it gets you high. They took the cocaine out almost a hundred years ago. You know why? It was redundant.

 

 In The First 10 minutes: 10 teaspoons of sugar hit your system. (100% of your recommended daily intake.) You don’t immediately vomit from the overwhelming sweetness because phosphoric acid cuts the flavor allowing you to keep it down. 20 minutes: Your blood sugar spikes, causing an insulin burst. Your liver responds to this by turning any sugar it can get its hands on into fat. (There’s plenty of that at this particular moment) 40 minutes: Caffeine absorption is complete. Your pupils dilate, your blood pressure rises, as a response your livers dumps more sugar into your bloodstream. The adenosine receptors in your brain are now blocked preventing drowsiness. 45 minutes: Your body ups your dopamine production stimulating the pleasure centers of your brain. This is physically the same way heroin works, by the way. &gt;60 minutes: The phosphoric acid binds calcium, magnesium and zinc in your lower intestine, providing a further boost in metabolism. This is compounded by high doses of sugar and artificial sweeteners also increasing the urinary excretion of calcium. &gt;60 Minutes: The caffeine’s diuretic properties come into play. (It makes you have to pee.) It is now assured that you’ll evacuate the bonded calcium, magnesium and zinc that was headed to your bones as well as sodium, electrolyte and water. &gt;60 minutes: As the rave inside of you dies down you’ll start to have a sugar crash. You may become irritable and/or sluggish. You’ve also now, literally, pissed away all the water that was in the Coke. But not before infusing it with valuable nutrients your body could have used for things like even having the ability to hydrate your system or build strong bones and teeth. 

 

This will all be followed by a caffeine crash in the next few hours. (As little as two if you’re a smoker.) But, hey, have another Coke, it’ll make you feel better.

 

 *FYI: The Coke itself is not the enemy, here. It’s the dynamic combo of massive sugar doses combined with caffeine and phosphoric acid. Things which are found in almost all soda.

 Tim Horton’s Crack Identified 
 Monday, July 14th, 2008 at 9:42 pm  Comments (14) 
 Authors Comment: I found this article on this blog ( hotgingeranddynamite.blogspot.com ) and thought it was highly interesting, especially considering the interest in the apparent addiction factor of Timmy’s coffee. I’ve written on this subject before, ( Tim Horton’s Nicotene/MSG? ) and that particular article went haywire with readers. After doing some research, I now find I have to alter my opinion on the ingredients of their coffee. Besides the moderation factor of coffee which most ignore, and the unhealthy chemicals so common in non-organic coffee, the Tim Horton’s brand may indeed have other highly undesirable ingredients. Check out the interesting read below:

 - 

————————————————————

 – 

 Speculation abounds on the internet as to why an entire nation can’t function without Tim Horton’s coffee. Canadians will go to astonishing lengths to wrap their hands around a hot double-double. Theories range from nicotine to MSG, to insane amounts of caffeine to good old all-purpose crack cocaine. Thanks to a CBC investigation, the coffee has even been submitted for laboratory testing and come up clean. A few days after our return from Canada, I was send this email:

I spent some time yesterday evening looking into the mystery of Tim Horton’s rocket fuel. Some interesting finds:

 

Firstly, Tim Horton’s claim that none of their coffee contains additives (none of their food, for that matter). A huge and already prosperous business is unlikely to risk their reputation by lying about this, so I assume they’re telling the truth.

 

Harold McGee tells me that Colombian Arabica coffee beans, when roasted, contain small quantities of a substance called lactisole which reduces the apparent sweetness of sugar by two thirds. This is why a cup of‘double double’strength Tim Horton’s, which contains a whopping 18 grams of sugar, tastes quite benign. The same amount of sugar dissolved in water would taste unusually sweet.

 

I did discover that lactisole has been synthesised and used by a company called Domino Sugar in a mixture called Super Envision Flavour and Texture Modifier. Not mentioned on their main website, they’ve hived off all their more controversial formulas onto www.dominospecialtyingredients.com , which tells me that:

 

 Super Envision® Flavor and Texture Modifier is the latest Domino Specialty Ingredient product of the Envision sweetness inhibitor line. This unique ingredient reduces sweetness and allows the food formulator to use a full range of carbohydrates to maintain the desired attributes of products, such as: moisture retention, mouthfeel and water activity. Super Envision can typically be used at&lt;1%. 

 

In other words, this stuff is used to cram more sugar into foods and sports drinks whilst not making it taste too sweet. Possibly why a can of coke is stuffed with 39 grams of sugar in only 12oz and still remains palatable. So the recipe seems pretty simple. Very strong coffee beans carefully chosen for a wide popularity, lots of sugar, lots of cream. Keeps‘em coming back for more.

 

In short: Tim Horton’s coffee has no secret ingredient. Its crack-like qualities arise from its unique ability, thanks to naturally-occurring lactisole, to deliver not only caffeine but a double dose of good old-fashioned sugar—18 g, or just under 4 teaspoonsful, roughly as much as you’ll find in 8-and-a-half Pixy Stix—across your blood-brain barrier in a matter of minutes. The fact that a double-double also delivers 7 grams of delicious, delicious fat (4g of which are saturated), or roughly as much as you’ll find in 2 teaspoonsful of butter, doesn’t hurt either.

This is better than Matthew’s calling up Kleenex to cross-question them about the“anti-viral”properties of their latest bird-flu-paranoia-inspired tissue .

 

That Super Envision stuff is scary. I presume all that bland corporate jargon just serves to conceal the fact that the stuff is used to allow food makers to shoehorn even more sugar into processed foods to give them the true crack effect. From Domino’s company history :

 

 During the mid-1990s, the company embarked on an intensive research and development program to develop non-sweet sugar for different food applications. For example, the company’s development of such a product, which combined Lactisole, a sweetness inhibitor, with sucrose, enabled it to tone down the sweetness in sports drinks and energy boosting beverages. Another application involved using non-sweet sugar as a fat substitute for frostings, icings, and a variety of frozen desserts. By 1995, the company had received approval for 18 food applications for its non-sweet sugar, including use in low-oil salad dressings. 

 - 

 
 You’re right—in other words, lactisole is a compound used by the forces of evil to satisfy our monkey brains and give us an“energy”boost without us realizing it’s all just sugar. Notice also that the use of“non-sweet sugar as a fat substitute”came about in the mid-90s during the“fat is bad”craze, when pretty much every edible item in the world, including Oreos, sported a badge proclaiming it was low in fat. Never mind how high it was sugar. Thus proving absolutely spot-on the words of Richard E. Grant in How to Get Ahead in Advertising:“[It] must be low in something, and if it isn’t, it must be high in something else, and that is its health-giving ingredient we will sell.

 - 

 Further Information: 

 

**Lactisole is a carboxylic acid salt isolated from roasted Colombian Arabica Coffee beans. Like gymnemic acid, it is a sweet-inhibitor or taste-modifier.

 

**Kinghorn, A.D. and Compadre, C.M. Alernative Sweeteners: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded, Marcel Dekker ed., New York, 2001. ISBN 0-8247-0437-1 

 

 Anti-sweet properties 

 

At concentrations of 100–150 parts per million in food, lactisole largely suppresses the ability to perceive sweet tastes, both from sugar and from artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. A 12% sucrose solution was perceived like a 4% sucrose solution when lactisole was added. However, it is significantly less efficient than gymnemic acid with acesulfame potassium, sucrose, glucose, and sodium saccharin. Research found also that it has no effect on the perception of bitterness, sourness and saltiness. According to a recent study, lactisole acts on a sweet taste receptor heteromer of the TAS1R3 sweet protein receptor in humans, but not on its rodent counterpart.

 

 Lactisole Interacts with the Transmembrane Domains of Human T1R3 to Inhibit Sweet Taste. P Jiang, M Cui, B Zhao, Z Liu, LA Snyder, LMJ Benard, R Osman, RF Margolskee and M Max. J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 280, Issue 15, 15238-15246, April 15, 2005 

 As a food additive 

 

The principal use of lactisole is in jellies, jams, and similar preserved fruit products containing large amounts of sugar. In these products, by suppressing sugar’s sweetness, it allows fruit flavors to come through. In the United States, lactisole is FDA GRAS (Fema number: 3773) and approved for use in food as flavouring agent up to 150ppm. Currently, lactisole is manufactured and sold by Domino Sugar and its usage levels are between 50 to 150 ppm.

 The Food On Your Plate 
 Monday, March 24th, 2008 at 5:34 am  Comments (2) 
 Editors Comment: The following article (from thetrumpet.com) is decisive and razor sharp in it’s analysis of the food we consume today. Even if you think you know a lot, read it to brush up; it will shock you. Folks, we are being deceived at the highest levels and I hate to say it, but if you put your health in the hands of food manufactureres, you’ll eventually receive your worst nightmare–a deadly disease. Don’t bury your head in the sand and say it won’t happen. If you do, you’ll be just another statistic. That’s not fear mongering; that’s the terrible truth. The evidence is all about us. Turn around and stop following the crowd. Think for yourself…

——————————————————–

 More has been done in the past 40 years to change people’s eating habits and the way food is produced than in thousands of years of recorded history! Is the average American conscious of what goes on behind closed doors in the modern food industry? Many will find the facts staggering!

 

Ninety percent of all food now consumed in the U.S. is processed. That means much of the natural flavor is lost and has to be reinvented.

 

The marketability of a food product depends on its taste. Thus, top-secret industrial complexes are scattered across the country, with refineries and chemical plants dedicated to re-creating or inventing new flavors—to assure a standardized taste for all their products. It is a multi-billion dollar industry. The consumer is steadily being separated from “real flavors.”

 

Eric Schlosser pinpoints the profit-and-power motive driving the food processing industry in his book Fast Food Nation: “The centralized purchasing decisions of the large restaurant chains and their demand for standardized products have given a handful of corporations an unprecedented degree of power over the nation’s food supply” (p. 5; emphasis mine).

 

One quarter of the adult population in America buys food in a fast food restaurant every day, seemingly without giving it so much as a thought!

 

We need to wake up to the reality of what processed food is all about!

 

Fast food is at present fully entrenched in American culture, to the extent that it forms one of America’s major exports. Fast food fits neatly into the average American family’s lifestyle—especially for Mom, who hardly cooks anymore.

 

Mr. and Mrs. America leave their fridge full of a week’s supply of ready-prepared, pre-cooked snacks and meals to heat up in the microwave. If they arrive home early enough from work, they may order a quick pizza to share in front of the television with the kids, or stock up at the drive-through of a local hamburger joint.

 

In the land of plenty and easily disposable, if perchance there is time for the family to spend together on Sunday and the sun is shining, they may go out for a buffet-style meal at a restaurant and get their fill of a broad selection of food. The restaurant chain’s sales pitch is, “Eat as much as you like!”—for an accessible price.

 

Mr. and Mrs. America and their two children, Amanda and Adam, find themselves in just such a buffet-style restaurant. As they take their place in the line, this is what they choose:

 

 French Fries for All! 

 

As french fries are so cheap to produce, there’s a fortune to be made out of them if you get the taste right. McDonald’s, the biggest retail company in the world, has its artificial flavoring down to a fine art; it now makes more money from its fries than from its burgers!

 

The oil in the fries, and the secret artificial flavor added to them—a hint of beefy flavor conjured up in a test tube—awaits the family’s taste buds. Cost is the decisive factor. The cheapest oil mix on the market, regardless of its health effects, is generally what gets used. In addition, repeated use of the same oil for frying can be seriously detrimental to the customer’s health.

 

One step backwards in the process and we find the soybeans, the cottonseed and the potatoes themselves have been genetically modified—engineered so as to produce their own insecticide and to tolerate exposure to potent weed-killers. The ground they were planted in has now been rendered useless for many other types of crop. Half of the soybeans and potatoes in the U.S. have been so modified.

 

What is the latest news in the world of potatoes? Last December a British company developed potatoes whose leaves have been implanted by a fluorescent gene from a jellyfish. The jellyfish gene, triggered by a protein that forms, glows when the plant is thirsty (Daily Mail, London, Dec. 18, 2000). Sound like science fiction? No, not in the 21st century.

 

Clearly, worldwide there is growing opposition towards genetically engineered plants, because of the unknown health and environmental risks. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (fda) is under pressure from health-watch groups for refusing to label genetically engineered products.

 

 Drinks: Soda-Pop for All 

 

Top soda-pop companies guard the secret way they mix chemicals with water, more than gold. Last year, a major shareholder protest resolution asking Coca Cola to stop using genetically engineered products failed to pass. Coke buys genetically engineered corn syrup by the tanker-full! Similar resolutions were filed with McDonald’s, General Mills, PepsiCo, Quaker Oats, Sara Lee and Procter and Gamble.

 

 Mom: Chicken Nuggets 

 

Anyone in Grannie’s day knew that giving someone sick meat meant endangering their health—perhaps their life! It seems the creators of modern processed food, as they drive the gravy train, have forgotten this simple fact.

 

The restaurant the America family is visiting is part of a multi-national chain which buys thousands of tons of broiler chickens every week. Broiler chickens are reared especially for their meat. They are housed in over-crowded sheds with up to 20 birds per square meter.

 

In the interest of profit, selective breeding, combined with 23-hour artificial lighting (which encourages constant eating) results in the species reaching its slaughter weight in only 38-40 days.

 

Nevertheless, the bird’s skeleton grows at a more natural rate. Consequently, the birds may not be able to support their body weight, causing tens of millions to suffer from painful leg disorders and lameness every year. By the time they reach slaughter weight they may have difficulty walking or reaching food and water. Millions die prematurely due to heart or lung failure or other causes.

 

The litter the birds stand on is usually not cleaned throughout the birds’ lives. As it becomes increasingly contaminated with poultry manure, corrosive ammonia is often produced; and because they have to spend so much of their time squatting on the ground, blisters often appear on their breasts. Ulcerated feet and burns on their lower legs are also common.

 

The health implications for consumers are irrefutable. Compassion in World Farming (cifw), a leading animal protection group, stated, “In 1996 a report by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food reported that one in three fresh chickens on sale are infected with salmonella and 44 percent with campylobacter (although some supermarkets now say that they have reduced this contamination rate)” (www.ciwf.co.uk).

 

Here is the other side of the sword: Antibiotics are often routinely fed to broilers as growth promoters and as a preventative medicine against the infections resulting from overcrowding. The antibiotics help to kill the bacteria that live in the gut of the broiler, but there is a growing concern that resistance to antibiotics is building in bacteria that infect both the broilers and the humans that consume them.

 

More than 19 million pounds of antibiotics are fed to cattle, pigs and chickens each year as they amble toward the dinner table.

 

 Amanda: “Just an Omelet” 

 

The milk in her omelet, like most on the U.S. market, contains a whitener to make it look more appealing. In this case, titanium dioxide was used—the same chemical component used to whiten paint; but as the fda does not require companies to disclose the ingredients of their color or flavor additives as long as all the chemicals in them are considered by the agency to be gras (“generally recognized as safe”), food processing companies maintain the secrecy of their formulas.

 

Frank Spivey, a retired research scientist who worked as a technician in both the pesticide and paint industries, and as a designer of flavors in the food industry, says that some of the chemicals used in the pesticide, paint and food industries are the same—it is just that the proportions and amounts used are different!

 

It is rare that anything is wasted in food-processing. Milk on the supermarket shelves that passes its expiration date is often sent back to the factory where it is turned into cottage cheese, yogurt or sour cream.

 

The cows that produced the milk in Amanda’s omelet, like so many now in the U.S., receive a fortnightly injection of a genetically engineered growth hormone called bovine somatropin (bst) which boosts milk production by 25 percent. Milk produced by cows injected by bst shows boosted levels of the growth hormone igf-1 (insulin-like growth factor one). This hormone is also a suspected carcinogen. In addition, some research claims the hormone has been blamed for wiping out almost 20 percent of some herds. The cows’ immune systems become impaired, increasing their vulnerability to severe bladder and udder infections. Bst also weakens the poor beasts’ skeletons by draining calcium from their bones, resulting in the many cows that survive being unable to stand because their bones are too weak.

 

Then there are the eggs in Amanda’s omelet, which were battery-produced, processed and turned into egg powder. The hens that lay the eggs are imprisoned for life in cages where each bird’s living space is less than the size of this page. Such extreme confinement denies a hen most of its natural behavior, such as walking, stretching its wings, pecking, scratching or dust bathing. The hen is forced to stand on a sloping wire floor which causes considerable discomfort and often leads to foot injuries, feather loss and skin damage due to constant rubbing against other birds and the wires of its cage.

 

Thanks to selective breeding, hens now lay around 300 eggs per year, rather than the normal 12 that their wild ancestor would lay. As eggshells are made of calcium, this abnormally high number of eggs severely depletes the bird’s calcium levels, which, combined with the inability to exercise, can lead to osteoporosis and the hen’s bones snapping under her.

 

Ciwf has found hens in cages with their wings, legs or heads trapped in the door, and dead birds left rotting in cages for days. Hardly ideal conditions for the production of healthful eggs.

 

 Parents, Amanda: Veggies 

 

A British report by nutritionist David Thomas and backed by leading scientists has demonstrated that, thanks to modern farming methods, vegetables are not as good for us as they were 50 years ago.

 

“There is up to 75 percent less calcium and 93 percent less copper in fruit and vegetables, the study says. Runner beans which used to contain a significant amount of sodium vital for the working of the nerves and muscles now have almost no traces of it at all” (Daily Mail, March 5). According to Mr. Thomas’s report, “The levels of other important minerals such as iron, phosphorous, potassium and magnesium have also plummeted.”

 

By comparing figures over a 50-year period, his recent report was able to plot trends that clearly demonstrate how vegetables are being consistently sapped of the nutrients so important to human physiology.

 

At a time when experts are telling us to cut down on fat and eat more fruit and vegetables, surreptitiously the nutritional content of what we are eating is being depleted for simple gain!

 

Research has shown that spinach, famous as a good source of iron, was found to have 60 percent less iron than it did 50 years ago; broccoli has 75 percent less calcium, which is essential for building healthy bones and teeth; carrots have 75 percent less magnesium, which protects against heart attacks, asthma and kidney stones.

 

Nutritionists are also concerned about fertilizers, which encourage plant growth at the expense of the minerals important for good health. Excessive use of fertilizers also leads to residues of nitrates in produce and contamination of water supplies.

 

In addition, pesticides are now found deep within fruit and vegetables, not just on the skin. They can impair the human immune system and lower resistance to cancer.

 

 Adam: A Regular Beef Burger 

 

The tried and tested choice! Adam adds a thin slice of laboratory-designed, easy-to-melt, plasticky cheese and some company-designed sauce to the fluffy, bleached-white bun. Ingredients of the bread: “Enriched wheat flour (flour, barley malt, ferrous sulfate, niacin, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), water, high fructose corn syrup, yeast, wheat gluten, soybean oil, salt, soy flour, monocalcium phosphate, ammonium sulfate, calcium carbonate, mono and diglycerides, ethoxylated mono and diglycerides, calcium sulphate, datem, dough conditioners (sodium stearoyl, lactylate, calcium dioxide, calcium iodate, diammonium phosphate), dicalcium phosphate, vinegar, enzymes, calcium propionate and sorbic acid (to retain freshness).” The list is almost as long as Adam’s arm!

 

The beef in beef burgers is often stored in gigantic aluminum vats which store meat from the far-flung corners of the world, and from which the contents are ground and mixed with a predetermined proportion of fat. A single fast food hamburger now contains meat from dozens or even hundreds of different cattle.

 

Obviously, this practice helps spread infections and harmful bacteria, especially, of late, the potentially deadly E. coli virus. “A modern processing plant can produce 800,000 pounds of hamburger a day; meat that will be shipped throughout the United States. A single animal infected with E. coli 0157:H7 can contaminate 32,000 pounds of that ground beef” (Schlosser, op. cit., p. 204).

 

Although according to official sources an effective sanitary control system would only cost about one percent of present cost, there seems to be a general lack of will to employ even precautionary measures.

 

“Instead of focusing on the primary causes of meat contamination—the feed being given to cattle, the overcrowding of feedlots, the poor sanitation at slaughterhouses, excessive line speeds, poorly trained workers, the lack of stringent government oversight—the meatpacking industry and the usda [United States Department of Agriculture] are now advocating an exotic technological solution to the problem…. They want to irradiate the nation’s meat. Irradiation is a form of bacterial birth control, pioneered in the 1960s by the U.S. Army and by nasa. When microorganisms are zapped with low levels of gamma rays or x-rays, they are not killed, but their dna is disrupted, and they cannot reproduce. Irradiation has been used for years on some imported spices and domestic poultry” (ibid., p. 217).

 

Although the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization would have one believe that irradiated foods are safe to eat, most consumers are still reluctant to eat things that have been exposed to radiation. So, rather than treating the problem at its roots, the meatpacking industry is working hard to get rid of the unpopular word “irradiation” to replace it with the innocuous phrase “cold pasteurization.”

 

With the relaxing of health control standards in the 1990s, more meat splattered with hair, feces or pus is getting through. Some, like Steven Bjerklie, former editor of Meat and Poultry, believe that the widespread use of irradiation might encourage meat packers to speed up the kill floor and spray dung everywhere. Mr. Bjerklie thinks that reducing pressure on the meatpacking industry to make basic and essential changes in their production methods will permit their unsanitary methods to continue. “I don’t want to be served irradiated feces along with my meat,” he says.

 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc) points to the seriousness of the problem. According to their statistics, if we use gastrointestinal illness as a common gauge of food poisoning, as we entered the 21st century food poisoning was 34 percent above what it was in 1948! The cdc says that every year, 5,000 deaths, 325,000 hospitalizations and 76 million illnesses are caused by food poisoning.

 

 Dad: Traditional Steak 

 

Chemically tenderized so that his knife will cut through it more easily, Mr. America’s steak was grown on a cattle ranch in the far north of Montana.

 

After visiting such a farm, Ian Cobain, New York correspondent for London’s Daily Mail, in a June 12, 1999, article titled “The Inside Scoop on American Feedlot Beef,” described his experiences. In his opinion, what British farmers did to cause bse (mad cow disease) pales beside the horrors of American farmers’ pursuit of profit.

 

“On this particular ranch,” he wrote, “thousands of cattle had been corralled into a series of steel pens, called feedlots, around 200 to each. There was no shade, no shelter and no grass on the ground, only dust. On each side of each feedlot was a trough containing herbicide-soaked grain.

 

“All of the cattle were enormous—the result of the grain diet and a series of steroid hormone implants inserted under the skin behind their ears….

 

“Because the cattle were carrying so much weight, and because their digestive systems are designed for grass not grain, some of the cattle’s internal organs had fallen out. And because it would be too expensive to call a vet out to treat these problems, a couple of sweating, panting farm hands in cowboy hats were going from cow to cow prising their organs back inside and stitching up the cows.”

 

Around 90 percent of the 29 billion pounds of beef consumed by Americans each year comes from cattle that have been fattened by hormone implants! American farmers have been merrily feeding an array of pharmaceuticals to their cattle since the 1950s. Today they routinely use six types. Three are “natural” sex hormones: testosterone, progesterone and oestradiol-17 beta; three are synthetic sex hormones. Like the steroids used by a bodybuilder, these substances increase both muscle and fat growth, making each cow heavier and increasing its weight by around 50 pounds. They also make the animals grow faster, so the farmer can take them to market far more quickly.

 

When the EU’s Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures published the results of its study on the use of hormones, it concluded that at least one, called oestradiol, is a “complete carcinogen,” because it can trigger tumors and promote their growth. The committee also called for further studies on the other five hormones.

 

Samuel Epstein, professor of environmental and occupational medicine at the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago, warned that confidential 1998 farming industry reports to the fda revealed high residues of hormones in American beef.

 

“According to some estimates, an 8-year-old boy who ate two hamburgers made from this meat would, following the meal, have increased his levels of the female sex hormone by 10 percent. According to Dr. Epstein, lifelong exposure to high residues of natural and synthetic sex hormones in meat poses serious risk of breast and reproductive cancers, which have increased sharply in the U.S. since 1950″ (ibid.).

 

The EU was particularly concerned by reports about cases of boys growing breasts and girls developing them early after eating contaminated food.

 

To reinforce its decision to ban U.S. beef, the EU published the results of tests on the small amount of supposedly hormone-free U.S. beef which was allowed in. When it discovered traces of hormones in 12 percent—including one substance which is illegal in the U.S.—it announced a ban on all American beef.

 

“There are around 42,000 feedlots in the major cattle-growing states, and around half the country’s 100 million cattle are confined within them. Some farmers using feedlots have begun research trials adding cardboard, newspaper and sawdust to the feeding programs to reduce costs. Other factory farms add manure from the chicken houses and pigpens, making the United States the only Western nation where it is legal to feed raw manure to cattle.

 

“Farmers are even reported to have experimented with cement dust, which is said to have produced a 30 percent faster weight gain” (ibid.).

 

 Parents: Dessert—Strawberries 

 

They look so big and red. Little does the family know that they are genetically engineered strawberries impregnated with fish genes to harden the crop against cold, frosty weather.

 

 Children: Strawberry-Flavor Mousse 

 

These are the ingredients of the artificial flavoring: amyl acetate, amyl butyrate, amyl valerate, anethol, anisyl formate, benzyl acetate, benzyl isobutyrate, butyric acid, cinnamyl isobutyrate, cinnamyl valerate, cognac essential oil, diacetyl, dipropyl ketone, ethyl butyrate, ethyl cinnamate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl heptylate, ethyl lactate, ethyl methylphenylglycidate, ethyl nitrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl valerate, heliotropin, hydroxyphenyl-2-butanone (10 percent solution in alcohol), a-ionone, isobutyl anthranilate, isobutyl butyrate, lemon essential oil, maltol, 4-methylacetophenone, methyl anthranilate, methyl benzoate, methyl cinnamate, methyl heptine carbonate, methyl naphthyl ketone, methyl salicylate, mint essential oil, neroli essential oil, nerolin, neryl isobutyrate, orris butter, phenethyl alcohol, rose, rum ether, g-undecalactone, vanillin and solvent. Sounds tasty!

 

 Scratching the Surface 

 

Feeling they had eaten better than normal, the America family went home content. They enjoyed the tastes and textures, and ended up feeling full.

 

Artful creators of illusion in the artificial food industry and marketing moguls slap each other on the back with glee for achieving this type of reaction in the public.

 

This article just scratches the surface. Much more information about the murky goings-on and practices of those making the furtive changes—in many cases under the blind eye of the U.S. government—is out there for the reader to discover.

 

If permitted, greed will take these food industry powers further. Some are considering the use of by-products and offal meats, which up to this time have only been used to make pet food, as ingredients in processed food products—with their own invented, market-studied flavors prettied up, packaged and marketed for human consumption! (Antioxidative Processing for Animal By-Products, Dr. Youling Xiong).

 

Just how far will they go, if the government doesn’t implement stricter controls?

 

Alarming reports are beginning to surface. According to the Washington d.c. Environmental Working Group, every day, nine out of ten American children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are exposed to combinations of 13 different neurotoxic insecticides in the food they eat. “While the amounts consumed rarely cause acute illness, these ‘organophosphate’ insecticides (OPs) have the potential to cause long-term damage to the brain and the nervous system, which are rapidly growing and extremely vulnerable to injury during fetal development, infancy and early childhood” (www.ewg.org).

 

An International Herald Tribune article announced that “Most Americans carry detectable amounts of plastics, pesticides and heavy metals in their blood and urine, a government survey has shown for the first time. The substances include many that cause brain damage, reproductive problems, cancer and other toxic effects in animals.”

 

The impact of fast food and food processing industries on modern North Americans is hard to overstate. It’s all about power and making more money. That’s the bottom line! Governments have been wholehearted in supporting “advances” in this industry. Their modus operandi seems to be to generally allow a product’s viability to be tested on the market until it is conclusively proved to be detrimental to people’s health! In doing so they are playing with lives—and not those of a far-off enemy nation, but of their very own people.

 Sports Drinks: Overhyped, Overrated And Unhealthy For Children 
 Tuesday, October 16th, 2007 at 7:11 pm  Comments (2) 
 When it comes to hydrating kids, particularly those who play sports, there’s a category of beverages that’s causing quite a buzz: power drinks. Many say they have that“extra”ingredient which gives them an edge; whether it’s an increase in energy, alertness, or even enhancing athletic performance.

 

The hype of these drinks has reached astronomical proportions, and their advertising tentacles have reached down even to minor sports and schools, involving children. Subsequently, there is now a battle raging in US public schools with billions of dollars at stake. Public health advocates are pushing for a ban on sports drinks and flavoured waters in schools, warning that drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade contain as much as two-thirds the sugar of sodas, and more than three times the sodium.

 

According to the Washington Post (September 26, 2007 issue), Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) has introduced a bill would have the government set new nutritional standards for the foods and drinks that schools sell to students outside cafeterias. But it’s the issue of these standards which is quickly becoming a hot button topic. The question of whether sports drinks and vitamin waters should be considered “healthy alternatives,” or “junk food,” has now brought this bill to the forefront in congress.

 

The trade groups representing bottlers like Coca-Cola and Pepsi are vehemently countering the bill, stating sports drinks are lower in calories, “appropriate” for high school students, and “essential” to young athletes.

 

Just what“appropriate”means is in question, but seeing annual sales of sports drinks reach 7.5 billion last year gives us a good clue as to why these manufacturers are lobbying so hard to keep them in schools. With sodas being phased out of schools by 2009, they are counting on these sports drinks to keep the money flowing in. In 2006, sports drinks were the third fastest growing beverage category in the United States, after energy drinks, such as Red Bull, and bottled water, according to the trade journal Beverage Digest .

 

Under current US law, meals served in school cafeterias must meet some standards, but snack bars, school stores and vending machines may sell anything that contains at least trace amounts of protein, vitamins and minerals. In other words, they barely have to keep you alive.

 

With such a loose standards, (and millions spend in advertising to make sure sports drinks are related to health and athletics), is no wonder that many students drink them like water.

 

Frankly, I’m just not sure how Gatorade and Powerade are beneficial to young students. Carefully crafted words such as “healthy alternatives” and “essential” are an insult to anyone who understands the issue of nutrition.

 

 Is sports performance more important than overall well being? 

 

A 12-ounce bottle of Gatorade contains 75 calories, 21 grams of sugar and 165 milligrams of sodium, compared with 150 calories, 40.5 grams of sugar and 52 milligrams of sodium in a can of Coke. If a student consumes a 20-ounce bottle of Gatorade, he/she ingests approximately 275 milligrams of sodium, almost 12 percent of the recommended daily allowance for people ages 14 to 18. Already, more than 75 percent of children consume more than the recommended 2,300 milligrams of sodium each day, according to the Institute of Medicine .

 

Too much sugar and sodium is well understood to be detrimental to our health. When you drink a sports drink inappropriately, you are compounding tooth decay, the possibility of high blood pressure, a likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression and so on.

 

A report from the University of California at Berkeley warns that inactive students who drink one 20-ounce sports drink every day for a year may gain about 13 pounds. Considering the ingredients, this comes as no surprise. Do you really want to wait to see what next year’s scientific tests come up with? Or maybe you want to wait for ten years?

 

 The sugar/chronic disease connection 

 

( Excerpt from Dr. Mercola )

 

Just like other sugars high fructose corn sugar (HFCS) disrupts your insulin levels, and elevated insulin levels are going to increase your risk of nearly every chronic disease known to man, including:

 

• Cancer
• Heart disease
• Diabetes
• Premature aging
• Arthritis and osteoporosis

 

You name it, and you will find elevated insulin levels as a primary factor.

 

There’s also new evidence that HFCS increases your triglyceride levels and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Part of what makes HFCS such an unhealthy product is that it will tend to raise your blood sugar levels and cause sugar to attach to many of your body’s proteins, thus causing permanent damage to them. Because most fructose is consumed in liquid form, these negative metabolic effects are significantly magnified.

 

Although these drinks are often referred to as “energy” drinks, in the long run, sugar does just the opposite. It acts like an H-bomb – a quick explosion of energy followed by a plummeting disaster, as your pancreas and other glands do all they can to balance out the toxic stimulation to blood sugar. Any kinesiologist or chiropractor will show you how sugar dramatically reduces strength!

 

 Do kids really need the electrolytes? 

 

 “Most kids you see carrying around sports drinks are not athletes,” said Mary Story, a professor of nutrition at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of the institute’s report. “When you look at the ingredients, it’s water, high-fructose corn syrup and salt. The question is, who is really benefiting? Is it the kids or the companies that make the drinks?” 

 

 

Makers of sports drinks say they’re better because they replace electrolytes that water does not, and the taste makes people want to drink more, ensuring that they get more hydration, (and more calories).

 

But studies of sports drinks have shown to be conflicting. A 2002 study showed that drinking sports drinks while working out allowed athletes to go 37 percent longer before feeling fatigue.

 

In 2004, a researcher from the University of New Mexico said that Gatorade is no better than water because it isn’t retained any better than water, so while it may make an athlete feel better initially, it isn’t any better for long-term hydration.

 

All of this, of course, assumes that the children in question are actually working out and not just drinking Powerade with their lunch. But even otherwise, it is unnecessary to replace losses of sodium, potassium and other electrolytes during exercise since it is unlikely that a significant depletion the body’s stores of these minerals during normal training. Only in extreme exercising conditions (over 5 or 6 hours, such as an Ironman or ultra-marathon), is the consumption of a complex sports drink with electrolytes recommended. Athletes who do not consume electrolytes under these conditions risk over hydration (or hyponatremia). ( Excerpt from Wikipedia )

 

 Alternatives to Sports Drinks 

 

Trade group representatives tell us a lot of hogwash, but remember they’re not nutritional experts. High fructose corn syrup is not an essential ingredient, but rather a dangerous additive, making performance drinks for children nothing but marketing hype.

 

Your best bet for primary fluid replacement is pure, fresh water. If your child is going to be involved in a long game, drinking simple carbs (sugar, corn syrup, and so on), will spike blood sugar, which will then be followed by a fall, causing sluggishness and hampering overall performance.

 

Sports drinks are for athletes who are exerting themselves beyond measure! They are NOT for students who are sitting in study hall or classes doing lessons. And marketing them for sports so early on teaches kids that performance is more important than overall health. It’s no wonder many think little of the negative effects of performance enhancing drugs.

 

We live in a culture where manufacturers/advertisers glorify the athlete for us, and we follow along like sheep. Drinking their product does not replace genetics, desire and hard work. It is merely a fad that makes the fat cats rich.

 Aquafina: The Deception Is Over! 
 Sunday, July 29th, 2007 at 8:16 pm  Comments (10) 
 So now the biggest non-secret in bottled water history is out. Aquafina, the PepsiCo Inc. bottled water with the cool blue mountain on the label, will stop trying to fool consumers into thinking its water comes from some far-away bubbling spring.

 

Why? Because it’s merely tap water in a pretty bottle, pushed onto water consumers with a slick, though deeply unethical, marketing move. Does it work? The Beverage Marketing Corporation says that in 2006 the bottled water industry made $11 billion.

 

Now PepsiCo Inc. will come clean with their Aquafina brand, by spelling out public water source, which currently reads P.W.S. on the label.

 

The company has been under intense pressure from a group called Corporate Accountability International to be more transparent about its product. Coca-Cola Company’s Dasani brand and Nestle Waters, North America’s Nestle Pure Life brand are also being pursued by the group.

 

The Los Angeles Times (July 29) says “Pepsi’s Aquafina and Coca-Cola Co.’s Dasani are both made from purified water from public reservoirs, (tap water in other words), as opposed to Groupe Danone’s Evian or Nestle’s Poland Spring, so-called spring waters shipped from specific locations that the firms say have notably clean water.

 

Many municipalities in the US are now citing concerns about the bottled-water industry, with some cities even banning employees from using city funds to buy bottled water (San Francisco) when tap water was available.

 

This pressure comes from the bottled water industry adding plastic to landfills, using too much energy by producing and shipping bottles across the world. In other words, the ban is merely another part of an effort to combat global warming. While I don’t condone the practices of the bottled water industry, I also think the move is hypocritical, in light of allowing pop or sweetened drinks to remain unscathed.

 

The general public probably agrees, with the industry newsletter Beverage Digest estimating that U.S. consumers spent about $15 billion on bottled water last year. Globally, consumption of bottled water had increased by 57 percent during 1999-2004 according to the Washington-based Earth Policy Institute .

 

Touting tap water as a safe alternative is ridiculous. You can’t tell if your water is safe by the way it looks, tastes, or smells. Some contaminants in water are so harmful that they are measured in“parts per million”or“parts per billion.”In other words, just a drop of these poisons added to many gallons of water can be very harmful.

 

For example, six studies examining a combined total of almost 8,000 people have indicated that men who drank more than 2 litres of tap water a day ran a 50 percent higher risk of bladder cancer than those who drank half a liter or less. Other beverages were not found to have the same associated risks ( International Journal of Cancer, April 15, 2006 ; 118(8): 2040-2047 ).

 

Tap water should be avoided because it contains chlorine and may contain fluoride, toxic substances that, with ongoing consumption, can have dire consequences for the body. Research now confirms that cancer-causing agents are created when disinfectant chemicals like chlorine come in contact with organic materials already in water, among them trihalomethanes. Fluoride, (hydrofluoric acid) which is a compound of fluorine that is a chemical byproduct of aluminum, steel, cement, phosphate, and nuclear weapons manufacturing, also can be every bit as toxic as chlorine 

 

In Canada, the risk is no better. Many Canadian public water supplies contain traces of one medication or another because sewage treatment plants usually aren’t equipped to filter drugs and antibiotics.

 

“In 2005 an Alberta Environment study found traces of ibuprofen, birth control pills, and steroids in samples from wastewater treatment plants in five Alberta cities. A couple of years before that, tap water tests from 10 Canadian cities found drugs in the drinking water of four. In the first Canadian study between 2000 and 2001, a team took water samples in 14 municipalities and at open water points along the Great Lakes; they found traces of painkillers, anti-inflammatories, and epilepsy and blood cholesterol drugs.” ( Source: alive #294, April 2007 )

 

Having said all that, the bottled water industry is not without dangers. Like most things in life there are positive and negative aspects to this trend. The major benefit of course is that people are drinking water more as a primary beverage to improve their physical health.

 

Even so, about one-quarter of U.S. bottled water comes from a municipal water source, (filtered tap water). While typical filtering removes chlorine, it does not remove fluoride. The bottled water industry maintains that no illness outbreaks have ever been linked to U.S. bottled water.However, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) conducted a study of 103 brands of bottled water (over 1,000 bottles were tested in all) and found that one-third contained synthetic organic chemicals and bacteria.

 

As well, the plastic bottles in which bottled water is typically sold are made of plastic polyethylene terephthalate, or PET. The manufacture of these bottles can release phathalates, which have been found to cause birth defects in animals, into the environment.

 

The International Bottled Water Association says that the bottles are recyclable and are reused up to 100 times before being made into other products. ( PBS Frontline World June 2002 )

 

Wide-mouth high-density Nalgene bottles are made from a safer plastic. Plastics that are safer to use for storing food and beverages, none of which are known to leach harmful substances, include:

 

 Polypropylene, designated“#5 PP” High-density polyethylene, designated“#2HDPE” Low-density polyethylene, designated“#4 LDPE” 

 - 

Of course glass containers are still best. And if you are going to pay the price for bottled water, you might as well get bottled spring water, not the filtered tap water Coke, Pepsi and others are selling.

 Soft Drinks Contribute To Pancreatic Cancer 
 Wednesday, July 25th, 2007 at 7:10 am  Leave your comment

Can’t give up that sweet taste of soft drinks? Think long and hard about your next gulp, because a study published in the November 2006 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported evidence that high sugar intake may be a factor in pancreatic cancer.

 

This study involved 75,000 men and women for more than seven years and came up with some not so surprising conclusions. Those who added sugar to everyday foods and drinks, and who consumed more sugar overall, including soft drinks, had a significantly higher chance of developing cancer of the pancreas. In fact, those who consumed five or more soft drinks daily, increased their risk of pancreatic cancer two-fold.

 

Researchers speculated that fluctuating blood sugar affecting insulin activity and glucose metabolism are the culprit. So there you have it; just another reason to put this nutritional horror show on the shelf and keep the body clean with healthy fluids.

 Is Calcium Fortified Orange Juice Really Good For You? 
 Monday, July 9th, 2007 at 9:45 pm  Comments (5) 
 
 
pureprecal.com
 
Promising a better bang for the buck, products called functional foods are increasingly filling grocery store aisles — and our fridges. Calcium fortified products are especially hot, and abound in orange juice–not to mention margarine, breakfast cereals, pancake mix and energy bars. Ever since food makers have introduced the idea, consumers seem to be loving it.

 

Given the choice between plain old juice or, for no extra cost, one fortified with bone-building calcium, most reach for the latter. Among Tropicana’s chilled juices, sales of the calcium-fortified varieties are growing at three times the rate of the others.

 

The problem with fruit juice is that it’s loaded with eight teaspoons of a relatively simple carbohydrate–fructose. Fruit juices are processed foods which are far too concentrated for us. If you have ever squeezed your own juice before, you know how many oranges it takes to create one glass of the fruit. So by drinking that 8-10 ounce glass of juice, you are eating the equivalent of many pieces of fruit with their inherent sugars, but without the fiber to slow down absorption! An 8-oz glass of orange juice has 120 calories and 0 g of fiber; an orange has only 60 calories and 3 g of fiber.

 

And while consuming calcium-enhanced drinks would seem helpful, it still will only further promote the concept that we should be consuming too much concentrated fruit juice. Fructose is a form of sugar which if taken out of moderation, contributes to major distortions of insulin balance which leads to hormone and neurotransmitter shifts, increasing a child’s risk for ear infections, ADHD and allergies.

 

 So while filling an important niche, manufacturers also are contributing to the diabetes epidemic and other sugar diseases. 
 - 
The American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines on Fruit Juice is: 

 

1. Fruit juice should not be given to infants younger than 6 months of age.
2. After 6 months, children should not get juice from bottles or cups that allow them to consume the beverage too easily.
3. Infants should not get fruit juice at bedtime.
4. Children between 1 and 6 should limit fruit juice consumption to between four to six ounces per day.
5. Children between 7 and 18 should limit fruit juice consumption to between eight and 12 ounces a day.
6. All children should be encouraged to eat whole fruits.

 Calcium inhibitors 

 

Generally it is not that a person is not eating enough calcium–it is one of the most widely occurring nutrients in our diet. It is more the case that lifestyle choices and dietary habits might interfering with the body’s ability to absorb calcium. Things that inhibit the absorption of calcium are:

 

 Coffee, soft drinks and diuretics Excesses of protein, especially meat Refined sugar or too much of any concentrated sweetener or sweet flavoured food Alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes and other intoxicants Too little or too much exercise Excess salt The Solanum (deadly nightshade) genus of vegetables–tomatoes in particular, but also potatoes, aubergines, peppers, courgettes–they all contain the calcium inhibitor solanine.

 Raw, unpasteurized milk as a great natural source for calcium: 

 

 Finding an authentic raw milk source, from pasture fed cows, is probably the single best source of calcium you can get, and an outstanding source of a variety of additional nutrients. Of course, sheep or goat milk will also work well. 

 

Pasteurized dairy is an extremely poor choices as a calcium source. The commercial variety contains traces of hormones, steroids, and antibiotics. Pasteurization destroys all valuable enzymes (lactase for the assimilation of lactose; galactase for the assimilation of galactose; phosphatase for the assimilation of calcium). The human pancreas is not always able to produce these enzymes; over-stress of the pancreas can lead to diabetes and other diseases.

 

 Some other good calcium sources are: 

 

 · Turnip greens – 1 cooked cup has 450 mg

 · Yogurt, plain, low fat- 8 oz has 415 mg

 · Sardines in oil (with bones)–3 oz has 370 mg

 · Collard greens – 1 cooked cup has 300 mg

 · Spinach, frozen, Boiled–1 cup has 291 mg

 · Yogurt, plain–8 oz has 275 mg

 · Chinese Mustard Greens, cooked – has 212 mg per 0.5 cups

 · Blackeye peas, boiled–1 cup has 211 mg

 · Kale – I cooked cup has 200 mg

 · Canned salmon with bones–3 ounces has 181 mg

 · Collards–1/2 cup cooked has 179 mg

 · Broccoli–1 cup cooked has 170 mg

 · Baked beans, canned–1 cup has 154 mg

 · Amaranth – 1 cooked cup has 150 mg

 · Cottage cheese, 1% milk fat–1 cup has 138 mg

 · Navy beans–1 cup cooked has 128 mg

 · Turnips–1/2 cup cooked has 124 mg

 · Green peas, boiled- 1 cup has 94 mg

 · Sesame seeds–one tablespoon has 90 mg

 · Chinese Cabbage, cooked – 0.5 cup has 79 mg

 · Oranges–1 cup has 72 mg

 · Almonds–1 oz (24 nuts) have 70 mg

 · Egg–1 medium has 55 mg

 - 

Getting a healthy amount of sunshine daily is your best source for vitamin D. Calcium and vitamin D work hand in hand for good health. Oral vitamin D is far inferior to your body producing it after being exposed to sufficient sunshine. In the winter months, the best source of vitamin D for most people is a high-quality cod liver oil.

 

Increasing your intake of vegetables, ideally through juicing, increases vitamin K intake, which serves as the biological glue that plugs calcium into your bone matrix.

 

Everything in moderation is a good rule of thumb, but if you follow this list of natural foods, you’re on the right path to getting your daily dose of calcium.
