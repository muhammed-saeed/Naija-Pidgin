I want to add my review in the mix we were in last Thursday to see a pretty cool new band, Xray Visionaires, they were sort of punk rock and really cool. The food is unpretenious which I love it is good ole pub grub, in a good way, Asian spicy chicken wings and fried mushrooms and some of the best burgers in Valdosta, I opted for the patty melt this time which was excellent and not over cooked, I must mention the sweet potato fries, awesome! gotta try those.

The food is unpretenious which I love it is good ole pub grub, in a good way, Asian spicy chicken wings and fried mushrooms and some of the best burgers in Valdosta, I opted for the patty melt this time which was excellent and not over cooked, I must mention the sweet potato fries, awesome! gotta try those. I also did see them frying up oreos that looked interesting and quite good, although, did not try, our friends who are vegetarian loves the hand pattied black bean burger and the hummus is also pretty great, I can&apos;t not forget to mention the staff, Mark and Jessica, the place was filling up because of the band and they still kept their eyes and hands on everyone, they were also training a new cook, and things were still coming out at a great rate, we will def be back and soon! thanks for a great night out! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful June 19, 2012 Likes it i heart the dirty bird! by Meagan Royal ( 5 reviews ) One doesn&apos;t go to Bleu Pub for good service. One goes to the Bleu Pub for KICK ASS burgers! I always say Im going to get something new when I go, but I just can&apos;t get anything but the dirty bird! I get them to fry my egg medium so it&apos;s runny. mmmmm AMAZING! The mac n cheese is really good too! May 24, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by Pollysox ( 3 reviews ) You know- having to deal with rude drunks all night- I believe the Staff to be absloutly Fablous. The Food is great- the service is great. :) August 7, 2010 Likes it Loooove it! by Kate ( 15 reviews ) Love the people, Love the food, Love everything. I hate to see people&apos;s bad reviews for Bleu Pub. It is one my favorite places in town! I go there often and never had a bad experience. Yes, sometimes the food may not be completely consistent, but it does not deter me from going back. One must understand that this is not a fast food restaurant, and the staff is small! I get in ordering ruts from time to time, and for the longest time I would switch back and forth between the Dirty Bird burger and the Cletus Burger. Then, it was the Turkey Rueben and the Falafel. This has gone on for roughly a year now. Well, the cycle is broken. I have added a new item to my favorites list. The black bean burger. The black bean patty is messy and it falls apart, but I love it just the same. The hummus is also delish, especially if you order the pita strips grilled instead of fried. Make sure you get a 16oz PBR with your meal. Oh so cheap. Oh so yummy. 3 out of 3 found this review helpful February 26, 2012 Likes it Bleu Pub, Valdosta by Micki ( 5 reviews ) One of the best places for burgers in Vtown! Also I really love their homeade sweet potato fries! My burger recommendation, The Braveheart - Yummy! September 2, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Dungeon21 ( 4 reviews ) Lunch there is amazing! The food was pleasing and the service complimented the meal. The atmosphere was very laid back and inviting. March 24, 2012 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by JW ( 2 reviews ) Food is good. Beer is cheap. Service fails miserably on every level, except Angie. Dumbass hipsters need to ride your bikes to obedience school. September 23, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it get real by lyswilliams ( 1 review ) Bleu Pub COULD be a really great establishment, EXCEPT for the fact that everyone who works in there is rude and slow. They should consider firing the entire staff and starting from scratch. I have never in my life had ruder service. They treated me as more as an inconvenience than a customer. Good burger though..... 2 out of 2 found this review helpful September 11, 2010 Really likes it Bleu Pub regulars... by EM ( 1 review ) We are big fans of the Bleu Pub. You must recognize that it is not fast food nor is it Chili&apos;s. I say those both in positive terms! The servers are attentive even when busy. the burgers are great! it&apos;s one of our favorite spots in town. long live independently owned and operated joints like this! 3 out of 3 found this review helpful August 9, 2009 Likes it Mobile review by Christy ( 1 review ) Love it! First of all I love Bleu Pub&apos;s hours... A group of friends and I walked all over downtown Valdosta looking for a place to have a quick drink and found that everything closed at 11! Glo was closed and apparently has been for sometime... Something about everyone being on vacation? Luckily it was closed or we would have never been directed to Bleu pub. We asked some random people on the street if there was anywhere open past 11pm.... They gladly pointed us in the direction of Bleu Pub. Immediatedly I loved it.... Sort of a dive but sort of posh. We all had drinks and appetizers... I had the fried pickles. Amazing! The staff was more than friendly. Not sure who she was be it staff or patron but a wonderful lady let us try her dessert...Amazing as well! I can&apos;t say enough about this wonderful place. It&apos;s just what Valdosta needed! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful February 26, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by Sal ( 67 reviews ) Great atmosphere, slow service by the Server and a ok hamburger. January 19, 2011 Likes it awsome by ripina ( 1 review ) i went to the bleu pub when it opened and found the place to be nice with friendly service, there when you need them, not hovering over you when you don&apos;t, however the food was dry and not to my liking. Then almost a year later I ended up there again on the insistance of the manager. What a change?! Not only have they seemed to work out their problems with the food but they have slowly crafted a truly original burger joint unlike any of the other choices in town. I have since become a regular and brought many people with me. We all agree these are by far the best burgers we&apos;ve eaten in town or out. Impressive considering i wrote them off. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful July 6, 2009 love it! great new spot to hangout downtown! by randomfoodlover ( 4 reviews ) I tried out the Bleu Pub for lunch, and thought the atmosphere was great and the staff friendly. Defintely a place I would go back and tell all my friends about. It is wonderful to have a new CASUAL place downtown that is inviting and laid back! Way to go Bleu Group!! keep it coming..... 1 out of 1 found this review helpful June 29, 2010 Really likes it GREATTTTTTT by Meghan ( 4 reviews ) One of the best places to eat in Valdosta or to even to just go and hang out with friends. If you go you have to try the fried oreo&apos;s that they have. they are good! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful October 21, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER by lilpiggie ( 2 reviews ) I will never visit this place again. I met some friends for supper, and upon entering, we were never greeted, seated ourselves, had to go ask for menus, THEN had to go ask for a waitor to take our orders! The waitors never smiled and seemed annoyed to have to serve us. It took ages and ages to receive our food, and the waitor never came by to check on us or to apologize for the wait. I ordered the veggie bean burger, which I was very disappointed with. It was falling to pieces and I ended up having to eat it with a spoon. I looked around to check out the other waitors to see if they seemed to be in any better of a mood. They didn&apos;t. When we received our check, I was charged for a drink that I didn&apos;t order. I then told the waitor, and he didn&apos;t apologize at all...just took the receipt and brought back a corrected version. He said nothing else, and kept that same annoyed expression on his face. He didn&apos;t even look at me. Needless to say, I didn&apos;t dare tip him. ***I&apos;ve spoken with... more» I will never visit this place again.

I&apos;ve been told that the deep fried oreos are amazing! I see that the other reviewers had only wonderful things to say. It&apos;s too bad I had such a TERRIBLE experience. I consider myself a very understanding person, and I don&apos;t mind if my waitor doesn&apos;t quite&quot;do everything right&quot;or makes mistakes as long as they&apos;re smiling, have a positive attitude, and seem like they&apos;re really trying to do their job well. It&apos;s very rare that I&apos;m so displeased with a place that I&apos;ll never even CONSIDER returning...but this is definitely one of those places. Someone should tell the owner or manager that they have terrible employees with crappy attitudes who have provided some of the worst (if not&quot;THE&quot;worst) customer service I have ever experienced in my life. If they want to save their business, they might want to clear some people out. 1 out of 2 found this review helpful May 4, 2010 Likes it i love this pub!!! by Marion Street Cafe ( 2 reviews ) one of my fav spots in down town next to Blue cafe. great food great staff great times. miss all youz guys! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful July 4, 2009 Likes it Mobile review by Kaitlyn Louise Watson ( 2 reviews ) WONDERFUL!!!
