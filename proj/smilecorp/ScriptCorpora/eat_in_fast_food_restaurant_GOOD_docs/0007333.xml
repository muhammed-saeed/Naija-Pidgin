 To Catch a Thief–Use a GPS Tracking Device 
 March 30th, 2010 by admin No comments» 


In a recent news story, police were able to apprehend a criminal who stole a van because the van was equipped with a GPS tracking device.

A felon spotted a van that was property of a county in New York state and hopped in for a ride. As you probably know some crimes are planned, but many are simply crimes of opportunity. An idling van, an open door…these are the kinds of temptations that criminals find hard to resist.

The employee who had been entrusted with the van was quick to alert his employer and they in turn called the police. Because of the GPS tracking device inside, the police were able to find the van outside of a fast food restaurant. Without the GPS tracking device, who can say how long it would have taken for them to find the vehicle? It surely wasn’t the only county-owned van on the streets. So police would have had to be on the lookout for both the van, not really knowing exactly where it was or who was driving it. A detective in an unmarked car attempted to get the suspect to end his joy ride. The suspect left the vehicle and made a run for it.

Eventually the van thief, someone who had been arrested 17 times in the past, was apprehended.

There is another side to this story though-what about the employees who left the car running and accessible to an opportunistic thief? We didn’t get to read about the end of that person’s story. I’m sure the county was glad that this employee came forward quickly and did not try to hide the theft.

As great as GPS technology is and as much as it can do to help make things more efficient, it doesn’t beat old-fashioned common sense. Most employers would prefer of their employees didn’t leave company vehicles idling, but having a GPS tracking device can add an extra layer of security in the event that something like this does happen.

 Active GPS Tracking Vs Passive GPS Tracking 
 March 28th, 2010 by admin No comments» 


In the world of GPS tracking, there are two types of products that you can choose for. These two types do have their own advantages and disadvantages, but they can be more efficient to certain needs and wants. You should understand that there are passive and active GPS trackers, complete with their distinct features and benefits. In order to be able to choose the right type to suit your needs, we are going to discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages in this article.

The first type of GPS tracker is the passive one. This passive device don’t give you the luxury of being able to monitor movements and the locations of subjects you are tracking on a real-time basis. You can still attach the device to the subject you are tracking and then take it back later to get a map of their travels. You will be able to download the travel log data from the passive GPS device and use the given software to interpret the data into readable map locations. You can see routes taken, stops made, and various other data once you downloaded the data from the device. If you plan on tracking the subject again, all you have to do is put—or give—the device back to the subject to let it records travel data. However, passive devices and solutions are far cheaper than active ones. You don’t have to pay monthly service charge to use passive GPS tracking solutions; just purchase the solution from a reliable source and you can use it for as long as you need.

Active devices, on the other hand, enable you to track movements and locations of the subject being monitored in real-time. The best way to go is to choose an active solution with web-based tracking interface and reliable map sources, because then you will be able to track the subject from anywhere as long as you have internet connection. These active trackers have GPRS module built-in to allow it to actively transmit movement data to a server; this is why you can track the subject as long as they are within GSM coverage area. Active solutions are great if you are monitoring children or elders as well, because the tracking device is small and compact—some provider also offer wrist-watch GPS tracking devices so it is very easy to use to track people—and very reliable. It is designed with enhanced sensitivity to allow you to track subjects even when they are indoor. The downside of active solution is that it cost more than passive ones. You will have to pay a certain amount of monthly service charge to be able to use the service to track on your subjects in real-time. Still, the cost you have to pay for these services is quite affordable and with the benefits active GPS tracking solution brings the price is very much worth it.
