Does soda kill sperm? Credit: Getty Images
 Guys, if you want to have children, you might want to go easy on soft drinks since they could be linked to infertility.
 
Danish researchers from Copenhagen University Hospital have found that men who regularly drink a liter or more of soft drinks daily have a drop in sperm count by as much as 30 percent.

 The study: Led by Tina Kold Jensen, the team was curious about the effect increased soda consumption over the past few decades would have on people&apos;s overall health. For this study, 2,500 young men were surveyed as to the types of beverages they drank each day. Each man&apos;s sperm count was also measured.

 The results: Men who did not consume carbonated beverages had 50 million sperm per milliliter of semen, compared with 35 million sperm per milliliter for those who drank one liter or more of soda a day. And that wasn&apos;t the only difference. Soda drinkers also led less healthy lives than those who didn&apos;t drink soda at all or as much.

So is it the soda or something else causing the drop in sperm count? More research is needed to find out, but Jensen is fairly certain it&apos;s not the caffeine in soda, based on previous research.

Still, Fabio Pasqualotto of the University of Caxias do Sul in Brazil, who did not take part in the study, told the United Kingdom&apos;s hc2d health care news website that he thinks the change in sperm count has more to do with lifestyle than with soda consumption. In addition, those who drink a lot of soda tend to have higher urinary concentrations of Bisphenol A (BPA), a plastic, which has been linked to fertility problems in men. Share
