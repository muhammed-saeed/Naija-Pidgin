	<description>Basically, it&apos;s the idea that what we see in any number of plate appearances is not a player&apos;s true talent. Probably, they are more like an average player than they appear.</description>

 KLAW Top 50 midseason prospects 
 
Only one Ray makes the list, and it&apos;s Hak Wont Be. Klaw says the following:

&quot;33. Hak-Ju Lee, SS, Tampa Bay Rays (age 21)
Current level: Double-A (Montgomery)
Preseason ranking: 12

He had a brutal start to the year, after which the Rays worked with Lee to get him to keep his hands from leaking forward and he started to hit again. If he doesn&apos;t hit -- and that&apos;s a bigger question mark today than it was six months ago -- he is a utility infielder. If he does hit, he has enough speed, patience and defense to profile as an above-average regular at short.&quot;

 What&apos;s Going On? 

 by Jason Collette on Jul 12, 2012 10:00 AM EDT in Features&amp;Analysis 
 




 

 
Both Tommy Rancel and Jonathan Mitchell have pointed out B.J. Upton&apos;s overly aggressive habits at the plate this season. Rancel pointed it out in late May and Mitchell revisited the situation in late June and found no change to Upton&apos;s habits at the plate. In the past, fans have jumped on Upton&apos;s case for being too passive at the plate and taking too many called strikes and that pendulum has now swung the other way as many are frustrated with him impatience at the plate.

In the second game of the double-header in Philadelphia, Upton earned a golden sombrero striking out four times in five plate appearances. That kicked off a run of him striking out in 24 of his final 64 plate appearances (59 at bats) which ended with an identical performance against the Indians in the final game of the first half and giving him a 38 percent strikeout rate during that stretch.

I am a non-blond, so I must ask, what&apos;s going on?

 The Rays Tank: Prospect Talk; Trout v. Harper; And Terry Ryan Speaks 

 by Steve Slowinski on Jul 12, 2012 9:06 AM EDT in The Rays Tank 
 
 Over at Minor League Ball, John Sickels did a mid-season evaluation of his pre-season Top 20 list for the Rays . I swear, every time I see one of these lists, it amazes me how deep the Rays &apos; system is. There are a ton of talented players throughout this list, and there are a number of players low on the list that are having great seasons. The new hitter profiles at Baseball Prospectus are awesome and amazing. I&apos;m going to be tapping into these quite frequently as a resource going forward. Bryce Harper or Mike Trout? BPro tackles the question, and gets a couple of scouts to voice their opinions on it. There&apos;s also a section toward the bottom with scout opinions on players from the All-Star Game, and some extended comments from Bud Selig. We don&apos;t often get a chance to see extended, in depth interviews with GMs, so I found David Laurila&apos;s interview with Twins&apos; GM Terry Ryan to be interesting. I found it interesting that he pushed back on many of the characteristics we normally associate with the Twins -- &quot;The Twins Way&quot;, focusing on strike throwers, etc. -- and I&apos;m impressed by some of the questions David asked about drafting and evaluating scouts. Very cool interview. It&apos;s taken me long enough to settle into this new job, but I&apos;ve finally started writing at FanGraphs again. My first piece back focused on Jake Arrieta&apos;s season so far , and how I still think he has potential even with all his struggles.

 Evan Longoria Injury: 2012 Return In Question 

 by SB Nation MLB News on Jul 11, 2012 11:30 AM EDT in Tampa Bay Rays News 
 


 

 
There are no certainties that Tampa Bay Rays third baseman Evan Longoria will return from his hamstring injury in time to play this season, tweets Buster Olney of ESPN:
 
There is a lot of concern in the Rays&apos; organization about how long Evan Longoria will be out, with no guarantees of anything in 2012.
—Buster Olney (@Buster_ESPN) July 10, 2012 
Longoria, who has been on the disabled list since May 1 with a partially torn left hamstring, was originally only expected to miss six to eight weeks. Since suffering a setback during a rehab game last month, however, that return date has been extended indefinitely.

 Carlos Pena: A Change In Approach 

 by Erik Hahmann on Jul 11, 2012 10:00 AM EDT in Features&amp;Analysis 
 




 

 
People love Carlos Pena . They love his home runs. They love his defense. They love his smile and his leadership in the club house. They love the way he asks Fernando Rodney where his invisible arrows are landing. What people don&apos;t love are the strikeouts and low batting average. While it would be nice if those numbers were better, he&apos;s still taking enough walks to currently grade out as an average to slightly-above-average first baseman. It&apos;s how he&apos;s drawing those walks that makes him a fascinating player to me.

I got bored watching the All-Star game last night, so I decided to poke around at some player pages on FanGraphs. I looked at Pena&apos;s last full season with the Rays (2010) and compared it to this current season. The numbers are remarkably similar.

2010: .196/.325/.407, .326 wOBA, 105 wRC+

2012: .201/.337/.372, .319 wOBA, 104 wRC+

Pretty similar, right? The biggest difference is the gap in slugging percentage. What really stuck out to me was that his walk percentage is the exact same; 14.9%. Yes, his strikeout percentage has risen from 27.1% to 29.9% but the league average rate has increased over a full percentage in that time while the average walk rate has decreased just .4%. Another thing you&apos;ll notice if you look at Pena&apos;s page long enough is he&apos;s swinging the bat a career low 42.5% of the time. You may have seen the new hitter pitch f/x profiles on Baseball Prospectus, if not I encourage you to check them out. Tons of sortable information there. I wanted to compare Pena&apos;s swing rate from the two years in question. The results are after the jump.
