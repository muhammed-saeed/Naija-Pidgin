McDonald&apos;s or Starbucks: Who wins?
 (Continued ...) 
The food fight

Starbucks&apos; strength at the outset, of course, was good coffee. That and plenty of opportunities for coffee lovers to customize their joe; the company says it offers 70,000 combinations of coffees, flavors and toppings.

Sure, the coffee chain has always sold basic foods, like the kinds of pastries you can enjoy in the typical Italian coffee bar that Starbucks tries to emulate. Now though, Starbucks is on an obvious campaign to offer more food, and in a ways a McDonald&apos;s customer might recognize.

 
 
 
 Who&apos;s winning the coffee wars? 
 

Mornings are peak business time at Starbucks, and its breakfast menu now features sandwiches strikingly similar to an Egg McMuffin . And why not? This has been a popular mainstay at McDonald&apos;s for years.

Starbucks will likely never have a full kitchen -- its lunch offerings are prewrapped. But it is rolling out mini-ovens in all stores, so it can serve warm food. And it&apos;s in the process of beefing up its lunch offerings to compete midday, as well.

Starbucks, of course, would argue that its food is not at all like what&apos;s offered by McDonald&apos;s -- it is free of trans fats , artificial flavorings and other unhealthy stuff. It has a point, one that translates to sales as consumers become more health-conscious.

 

But McDonald&apos;s has noticed this as well. In the past year or so, it&apos;s rolled out its own version of wraps, healthier salads, premium burgers made from Angus beef and &quot;real fruit&quot; drinks that are a lot like Starbucks smoothies.

As a coup de grace, McDonald&apos;s has launched what a lot of old-timers probably thought they&apos;d never see at a burger joint: fruit and maple oatmeal. I doubt it&apos;s coincidental that oatmeal has long been one of Starbucks&apos; more popular food offerings.

&quot;McDonald&apos;s is going through a major reinvention, with healthier food, the fancier coffees, the fruit smoothies, salads and now oatmeal,&quot; says Howard Davidowitz of Davidowitz&amp;Associates, a retail consulting and investment banking firm. &quot;They&apos;re trying to distance themselves from Burger King. That&apos;s not easy to do, and I think they&apos;ve done a great job.&quot;

Aesthetics

A big advantage for Starbucks is that its stores are comfortable places to hang out. I doubt many people have viewed McDonald&apos;s, with its harsh lighting and hard plastic seats, the same way.

But this is changing, too. With a nod to Starbucks, McDonald&apos;s is remodeling its restaurants to make them cooler places to spend time. &quot;The remodeled McDonald&apos;s are more aesthetically pleasing. They have a European feel, with more art and free-standing furniture,&quot; says Hottovy.

And McDonald&apos;s is rolling out free Wi-Fi internet access, which as of Dec. 31 was available in about 12,000 of the chain&apos;s 32,737 outlets worldwide.

McDonald&apos;s has the cash -- $6.3 billion, as of the end of last year -- to get this done. It plans to remodel 2,200 restaurants this year. &quot;We continue to see the desired results from our re-imaging, with improved perceptions of our brand and higher sales,&quot; Skinner said during the conference call.

Of course, there are limits to how closely McDonald&apos;s can resemble Starbucks. The fast-food chain will never match the &quot;unique Starbucks experience&quot; the coffee chain boasts about. And the remodeling won&apos;t generate Starbucks-style pricing on food and beverages: Skinner has cast cold water on the notion that upgraded restaurants will allow the chain to raise prices.

Another big difference: Starbucks is aggressively branching into new distribution channels like warehouse stores and grocery stores -- where it offers Tazo Tea, Seattle&apos;s Best Coffee, Torrefazione Italia coffee and Starbucks Via Ready Brew instant coffee. Starbucks also has a partnership with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters ( GMCR , news ) to supply K-Cup single-serve coffee and tea packs for use in the company&apos;s Keurig single-cup brewing system. McDonald&apos;s, surprisingly, still doesn&apos;t capitalize on its powerful brand in this way.

And the winner is . . .

So who&apos;s the winner? In one sense, Starbucks seems to be coming out ahead, hands down. Since the beginning of 2010, it has been posting sales growth of 7% at stores open more than a year, compared with growth of between 2% and 5% at McDonald&apos;s, said Jharonne Martis, the director of consumer research at Thomson Reuters.

But this contrast is a little deceiving. For one thing, sales growth of around 3%, the most recent number for McDonald&apos;s is quite healthy, says Martis, especially for such a big company. McDonald&apos;s had annual revenue of $24 billion last year, compared with $10.7 billion at Starbucks. McDonald&apos;s employs about 400,000 workers in about 32,700 stores in 117 countries. Starbucks has 137,000 employees in about 16,900 stores in 55 countries.

That size difference means it&apos;s tougher for McDonald&apos;s to post big sales gains. But it also means it has more strength in negotiating prices with suppliers. Plus, McDonald&apos;s employs a franchise system, for the most part, while Starbucks owns and operates most of its locations. This pushes a lot of the costs at McDonald&apos;s onto franchise operators -- boosting profit margins at the parent company. The upshot: McDonald&apos;s has operating profit margins of 31%, compared with 13.5% at Starbucks.

 
 
 

So more incremental gains in its coffee wars and food fights with Starbucks fall to McDonald&apos;s bottom line.

Right now, the market seems to fully recognize the potential of each company. Neither stock is a bargain. But over the long term, both should reward investors as they boost sales by borrowing what works best from each other. Just don&apos;t expect to see $12 burgers at McDonald&apos;s or to order chicken nuggets with your iced cinnamon dolce latte at Starbucks. Not that you would want to.

McDonalds wins for price conscience consumers - McCafe Coffee is pretty darn good.

 

if you are a coffee snob and like paying double almost triple then starbucks is your choice. The allure of carrying a starbucks cup and 2.49 coffee is gone for most of us. But different strokes for different folks that what makes this country great.

The bad thing about Micky D&apos;s is the staff and getting the coffee order correct. Locally if one orders two cups of coffee at the drive any way but black, you can count on one of them being wrong.

 Previous replies Write a reply... truthrulz Jul 6, 2011 3:07PM It&apos;s amazing how ill informed people are. Starbucks does not buy roasted coffee. They roast it themselves. Starbucks does not use chicory. Starbucks does not buy the lowest quality beans. That would be m****ducers like Folgers and Maxwell house. Shade grown is only a portion of coffee offered by Starbucks.  And yes some crops are shared with the coffee plants, that&apos;s what gives them a very unique, pleasant flavor.  Coffee is a matter of taste. Just like wine.  Just like wine, there are many different varieties and roasts. The same bean, from the same farm can have a totally different taste, based on the roasting profile.   I used to work for MCD&apos;s and then Starbucks.  MCD&apos;s coffee sits for hours at times. Sbux rotates coffee every 30 minutes all during the day. MCD&apos;s uses lower quality beans and depends on outside sources to get beans. SBUX controls the quality of coffee from farm to store. MCD&apos;s uses preground coffee. SBUX for the most part grinds beans just before brewing.    When I started with Starbucks, it took me awhile to get used to the flavor of fresh brewed, properly roasted coffee. After all I was drinking stale MCD&apos;s and folgers before then.  Now even after moving on, I would never use anything other than Starbucks.  I know how passionate the company is when it comes to quality. Can&apos;t say the same for MCD&apos;s .   Oh and MCDs is franchised. You are at the mercy of many owners. The owner of mine was a cheapskate that cut corners anyway he could.  Starbucks, company owned. A little more consistent.

McD&apos;s coffee won over 90% of the time. It was shocking. All we did was buy boxes of starbucks and McD&apos;s would bring in theirs to college campuses and we would conduct tests... STRAIGHT FACED and I would be shocked to see how many chose McD&apos;s without hesitation.

If I want a frappucinno, latte, coffee, a higher quality sandwich, or a quiet atmosphere I&apos;ll go to Starbucks. When I&apos;m on the fly, have a craving for their awesome fries, shake, or am sick of the quiet and need a little noise I&apos;ll go to McDonalds. Two separate places...two totally different atmospheres. &quot;Coffee house&quot;.....&quot;fast food restaurant&quot;. Starbucks will never be a fast food restaurant and McDonalds will never be a coffee house....end of story!

 Previous replies Write a reply... enjohns Jul 6, 2011 3:12PM I appreciate both. When I am with my kids and I have to make a McDonald&apos;s run anyway, I like having the ability to get an iced latte there as well. They also are very good and are not as costly as Starbucks. However, when I am alone and want to indulge, I go to Starbucks. I think there is room for both. I will admit that I was surprised at how tasty McDonald&apos;s iced coffees are. By the way, Burger King serves Seattle&apos;s Best, and they make a good iced latte too.

 Previous replies Write a reply... Rafaella Gelato Jul 6, 2011 1:41PM I am from Italy and I travelled a lot as part of my job...when I visit New York, I will stop by Starbucks and this little patisserie in Little Italy called La Bella Ferrara (I believed that was the name) or Il Bella can&apos;t remember, but the coffee on both of these places was close enough to Italian coffee taste - specially the Caffe&apos; Macchiato or just the espresso. I&apos;ve been to a McDonand at the Dallas airport and there coffee is nothing to compare to either Starbucks or any italian coffee. If you are a real coffee connoisseur you can tell the difference. If you don&apos;t like strong coffee then Mcdonald&apos;s or fast food place coffee will be okay. It really depends on your taste buds or your budget. Beside when you seat inside mcdonald all I can smell were cooking fries and burgers. I like the smell of bake goods and strong coffee --- that was just my taste bud!

 Previous replies Write a reply... Liv424 Jul 6, 2011 11:14AM Here are the facts  
 We all have different opinions as to what tastes better and which coffee one prefers  
 Starbucks is pricey. I went there with my parents the other day my dad got an iced latte and my mom and I both got green tea it was over 10 dollars! Tea is water with infused herbs I mean seriously. 
 On the other hand every time I go to Mc Donald&apos;s they mess up my order . . . Seriously every time. Yes there is a difference between a Mc Floury and straw berry banana smoothie.

 Previous replies Write a reply... 10309 Jul 6, 2011 10:30AM Frankly, Starbucks is much better in terms of smell and taste. Although McDonald coffee is good (depending on which store), it is far from Starbucks. Of course, you pay for what you get. I still prefer Starbucks, real coffee taste and smell.

 Previous replies Write a reply... Railroad Ron Jul 6, 2011 2:35PM say what they want, I have tried both, on many occassions, and McDonalds coffee wins hands down!  Starbucks does not have the flavor, or the aroma, of good quality coffee. they are relying heavily on their name and image. Both which are suffering.  Add to the also rans, Burger King and Subway, subway just doesn&apos;t have a quality coffee, and Burger Kings recent change to a new brand is a lousy coffee.  To further the competition between coffee at McDonalds versus Starbucks, how often to they make a fresh pot at Starbucks? How often do they change a pot of coffee rather than just let it sit? I traveled for a living for nearly 40 years and my own personal choice is McDonalds. I rarely buy the food(except for salads, wraps, etc.) but I have yet to be served a bad cup of coffee at McDonalds.  And does Starbucks charge $1 per cup, any size, any time? McDonalds does.

 Previous replies Write a reply... WasteOtime Jul 6, 2011 1:05PM Starbucks and McDonalds both buy the exact same commodity-grade beans from the exact same suppliers. Starbucks does not have &quot;better coffee&quot; than McDonalds...what they have is better water -- and coffee is 97% water. 

Every Starbucks has a high-quality water filtration system that makes the mineral content of their water uniform throughout all of their stores, which is why a latte at SBUX tastes the same if you&apos;re in Paris or in Minneapolis.

Once McDonalds implements some more uniform training and production standards and cleans up their water, there really won&apos;t be much of a difference...minus the price. But don&apos;t fool yourself into thinking that the beans are raised better, shipped better, roasted better or brewed better at Starbucks over McDonalds.

I have yet to see a McDonalds with atmosphere even close to Starbucks! Many of them are dirty and messy and all have kids screaming and running around.

 

I will say their coffee is good. But, who said the blended coffee drinks are cheap?! NOT!
