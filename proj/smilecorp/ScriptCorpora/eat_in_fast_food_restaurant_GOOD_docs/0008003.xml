 Beautiful co-ed Shelly Janson survived falling in love with him and 

 trying to make his most bizarre sexual fantasies come true. 

   

 But of the nearly fifty women who ranged from mothers of families to

                                 Prologue 

   

 The crimes began in a scatter pattern.   One here.   Another there. 

 And another hundreds of miles and another state away.   There was, in 

 the beginning, no commonality.   All of the victims were females, but 

 then, females are often victims of violent crime.   Some of the 

 victims were teenagers, some were mature women, and two were only 

 children.   He had not yet achieved a nickname, and in the seventies 

 and eighties, all &quot;bigtime criminals had nicknames: Son of Sam, the 

 Hillside Strangler, Ted, the Atlanta Killer, the Sunset Strip Killer, 

 the Green River Killer. 

   

 He had no nickname, and he liked it that way. 

   

 As far as anyone knew, his crimes had been committed by a number of 

 different men.   As far as anyone knew, there was no pattern, only a 

 series of isolated incidents. 

   

 One day soon, he would be deemed the &quot;I-5 Bandit,&quot; and than the &quot;I-5 

 Killer,&quot; the scourge of an eight-hundred-mile stretch of the freeway 

 that follows the Pacific Coast from British Columbia to the Mexican 

 border, and he would become the prime quarry for hundreds of 

 frustrated detectives. 

   

 He did not mind his anonymity.   Far from it, he reveled in it.   As 

 long as lawmen did not give him a name or a connection to the 

 attacks, he was free to do as he liked. 

   

 The first incident occurred in Vancouver, Washington, at five-twenty 

 in the evening on December 9, 1980.   A twenty-two-year-old female 

 cashier at Eddie&apos;s Arco station was robbed by a tall dark-haired man 

 wearing an obviously fake beard.   The spirit gum used to affix the 

 beard had loosened so much that the beard was about to fall off. 

   

 &quot;He showed me this small silver gun,&quot; the young woman told Clark 

 County deputies, &quot;and he said, &apos;It&apos;s for real.&apos;&quot; 

   

 She gave him the money in the till, and he told her to turn around 

 and &quot;watch TV.&quot;   He was referring to a surveillance camera that, 

 unfortunately, was malfunctioning; the tape had stuck between the 

 camera heads. 

   

 A composite picture drawn from the victim&apos;s recollection of her 

 attacker showed a dark-eyed man with a beard, a young man. 

   

 On December 13, in Eugene, Oregon--108 miles south of Vancouver--a 

 man with a fake beard and a Band-Aid across the bridge of his nose 

 walked into the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream parlor on Villard Street at 

 six P.M., brandished a silver pistol, and forced the clerk to give 

 him the contents of the cash register. 

   

 &quot;Now, turn around and walk into the back room and stay there, and 

 don&apos;t do anything stupid,&quot; he ordered. 

   

 As she walked away from him, she fully expected to be shot in the 

 back, but he left without harming her. 

   

 &quot;It was so strange,&quot; she told the officer who took her report. 

 &quot;Fifteen minutes before he came in, there was a real grubby-looking 

 kid in here who told me how easy this place would be to rob.   He just 

 bought an icecream cone and left, and then this clean-cut guy comes 

 in and robs me.&quot; 

   

 The next evening two eighteen-year-old clerks at the Arctic Circle 

 drive-in in Albany, Oregon, encountered a bearded man.   He walked up 

 to the drive-in window carrying a used Arctic Circle bag and a paper 

 cup.   He asked the girl on duty to fill the cup with water and throw 

 the bag away.   Then he asked for a clean sack.   As he talked, he 

 watched traffic on the street.   When the street was empty of cars, he 

 handed the sack back to her and barked, &quot;Fill it up.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; she said. 

   

 And then she lowered her eyes and she did understand.   She saw that 

 the man was pointing a silver gun at her heart.   She was so 

 frightened that she forgot which buttons to push on the computer cash 

 register and had to call her fellow worker to do it.   The bag was 

 filled with two hundred and eighty dollars in cash, and the big man 

 turned and ran swiftly away. 

   

 Four days before Christmas a man answering the same description 

 popped up more than two hundred miles north of Albany--in Seattle. 

 But this time the man wanted more than money. 

   

 Kim Meehan, twenty-five, worked as a waitress at Church&apos;s Fried 

 Chicken in Lake Forest Park, north of Seattle.   Feeling nauseated 

 during the early evening, Kim called her father at nine to ask him to 

 come and pick her up.   In the women&apos;s restroom she bathed her face 

 with cold water.   Suddenly there was a loud knock on the door, and 

 she looked up to see a man pushing his way in.   He grinned at her and 

 said &quot;Excuse me.&quot;   But he didn&apos;t leave.   Instead, he turned and 

 locked the door behind him. 

   

 He pulled a silver revolver from the pocket of his hooded coat and 

 ordered her to take her blouse off.   &quot;Do what I say and you won&apos;t get 

 hurt.&quot; 

   

 She was struck almost dumb with shock, and she thought that this 

 couldn&apos;t be happening--not with the other employees just on the other 

 side of the restroom wall.   She couldn&apos;t move, and the man, who wore 

 a peculiar ragged beard, moved toward her and pulled up her blouse 

 and bra and started to fondle her breasts. 

   

 &quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;I want you to beat me off.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t know how,&quot; she countered. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ll show you how,&quot; he said, and moved the gun closer to herhead. 

   

 She had no choice.   She did what he asked, and after about two 

 minutes the man ejaculated on her breasts.   &quot;That was good,&quot; he said 

 calmly.   &quot;Now, you stay in here for five minutes.   Count to a hundred 

 and nobody will get hurt.&quot; 

   

 And then he was gone as suddenly as he&apos;d appeared.   She wanted to 

 scream, but she thought he might still be outside listening.   She 

 waited five minutes before she pounded on the wall and screamed for 

 help. 

   

 The restaurant&apos;s fry cook called the police and told King County 

 deputies that he could describe the man too. 

   

 &quot;I can&apos;t believe it,&quot; he muttered.   &quot;That guy was in here; he ordered 

 a number-five dinner, and paid for it.   He must have seen Kim walk 

 back to the restroom.   He was wearing a hooded brown corduroy or 

 suede jacket with a sheepskin lining.&quot; 

   

 Twenty minutes later, the man in the brown jacket-minus his fake 

 beard--lingered over an ice-cream cone he&apos;d ordered at the 

 Baskin-Robbins store in Bothell, Washington.   The two teenage girls 

 working that night were ready to lock the doors at ten P.M., but the 

 man hung around.   They whispered to each other, joking: 

   

 &quot;Maybe he&apos;s planning to mug us or something.&quot;   They giggled.   The big 

 man asked them to throw away the last of his cone. 

   

 Then he wanted some ice water.   They could offer him only tap water. 

 He took one sip and asked for a lid for his water cup.   Then he asked 

 for a straw and a paper sack.   He had played out this script before, 

 but the girls in Bothell didn&apos;t know that.   They just thought the guy 

 was pretty nervous and a little peculiar, and they wanted him out of 

 there. 

   

 Savoring the moment, the tall dark man slowly pulled his revolver 

 from his pocket.   &quot;Now, put all the money in the bag.&quot; 

   

 &quot;All the money&quot; at closing time meant a good haul: over five hundred 

 dollars.   The gunman ordered the two girls to sit on the floor, count 

 to fifty, and look the other way as he left.   They obeyed, but they 

 remembered a lot about him.   He had not had a car, at least not in 

 the Baskin-Robbins lot.   He was probably in his mid-twenties, 

 good-looking, with a full mustache, tan complexion, and a thick head 

 of dark brown curly hair.   He&apos;d worn blue jeans, a maroon-and-blue 

 rugby-type shirt with a V neck trimmed in white, the.   brown suede 

 jacket with sheepskin lining.   The gun was silver, and they&apos;d seen a 

 round cylinder. 

   

 They did not know how lucky they&apos;d been; it had been only twenty 

 minutes since Kim Meehan was abused in the Church&apos;s restroom a few 

 miles away, and he did not sexually attack the girls in 

 Baskin-Robbins. 

   

 There was a spate of calm between December 21, 1980, and January 8, 

 1981.   The man with the silver gun was apparently celebrating 

 Christmas and New Year&apos;s. 

   

 With the new year, it looked as if he was starting all over again. 

 He hit Eddie&apos;s Arco in Vancouver at nineeighteen P.M., the same 

 service station he&apos;d robbed on December 9 Only the cashier on duty 

 was different.   He had the same small silver gun.   The frightened 

 woman handed over something less than a hundred dollars. 

   

 &quot;Sit down on the floor,&quot; he ordered, &quot;and take off your shirt.   Lift 

 your bra.&quot; 

   

 She did as she was told, and he gazed at her intently for a minute, 

 and smiled, as she described it later: &quot;evilly.   Then he said either 

 &apos;okay&apos; or &apos;ugly&apos;--I&apos;m not sure which and I didn&apos;t care--and told me 

 to count to fifty slowly.   He left on foot.&quot; 

   

 This time the surveillance camera had been in good working order. 

 The gunman&apos;s image had been captured.   He was tall with frizzing 

 curly hair, a fake beard, and he wore a hooded velour sweat jacket 

 and blue jeans.   He also wore dark &quot;ski-type&quot; gloves with 

 light-colored stripes on the thumbs and fingers. 

   

 On January 11 the Grocery Cart Market in Eugene was robbed at 

 seven-twenty P.M.   by the oddly bearded gunman who wore, always, a 

 Band-Aid over his nose and a hooded jacket and blue jeans.   This 

 time, too, he&apos;d had on ski gloves, dark blue with 

   

 white palms.   He asked for Vantage cigarettes, and then for the money 

 in the till.   His take was only thirty-five dollars. 

   

 Twenty-four hours later he was in Sutherlin, Oregon, fifty miles 

 south on the I-5.   Susie Benet, twenty, worked that Tuesday night as 

 a cook at the Central Market in Sutherlin.   She was alone, and had 

 been for about fifteen minutes, as she watched television on the set 

 about ten feet from the cash register.   A tall man walked in wearing 

 a red knit hat and a green windbreaker jacket and she turned to wait 

 on him.   His complexion was dark, what she could see of it; he wore 

 two Band-Aids across the bridge of his nose. 

   

 &quot;Give me the money from the till.&quot; 

   

 She started to laugh, thinking that he was kidding her.   He had a 

 funny look on his face, as if he were teasing. 

   

 &quot;Sure,&quot; she kidded back. 

   

 And then she saw that it wasn&apos;t a joke.   He drew a revolver from his 

 jacket, a nickel-plated gun with a short barrel.   &quot;This is a real 

 gun,&quot; he warned. 

   

 Susie Benet just stood there for a moment, and that angered the 

 gunman.   He reached across the counter and grabbed her by the blouse. 

   

 And then he let go and the gun boomed.   She felt something hit her 

 and bounce off.   She didn&apos;t know that she had been shot.   She walked 

 slowly around the counter to the cash register, and the man followed 

 her, still pointing the gun at her.   She looked down at her right 

 shoulder and saw bright red blood staining her blouse.   She wondered 

 hazily why she could still stand up and walk around.   She thought 

 bullets killed people. 

   

 &quot;Now, get down on the floor and stay there,&quot; he ordered. 

   

 &quot;No,&quot; she begged.   &quot;No, I&apos;ll get the money for you.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Just stay on the floor.&quot; 

   

 She heard him open the cash drawer, but she didn&apos;t dare look; she 

 thought if she could just hide behind the counter he couldn&apos;t shoot 

 her again.   Finally she heard him leave.   There had been three 

 hundred dollars in the cash register, but it was gone when she 

 staggered over to the phone to call an ambulance. 

   

 Medics found that Susie Benet had been very lucky; she had a 

 through-and-through gunshot wound with entry in the upper-right 

 shoulder and the exit slightly higher in her back.   A few inches 

 lower and the bullet would have pierced her lung. 

   

 Sergeant bill Caldwell of the Sutherlin Police Department responded 

 to Susie&apos;s call for help.   He did not question her, due to the 

 seriousness of her injuries, but later in the hospital Susie Benet 

 described the man who had shot her. 

   

 Caldwell was able to retrieve the bullet where it had bounced behind 

 a shelf along the wall.   He also lifted a single Print from the till; 

 the gunman had had to lift the top to get beneath it.   But the print 

 had been left by someone wearing gloves made of nonporous 

   

 fiber. 

   

 For the first time, a possible vehicle was mentioned.   A jogger had 

 seen a Volkswagen Bug parked near the Central Market just before the 

 shooting.   All he could remember was that there was something 

 &quot;unusual&quot; about the car.   The robber took one night off, but the next 

 night he was prowling again. 

   

 On January 14, 1981, in Corvallis, Oregon, Merrisue Green, ten, and 

 her eight-year-old sister, Megan, had been left alone in their home 

 for only forty-five minutes; their mother routinely went to work out 

 at a health club right after supper on week nights.   Mrs. Green left 

 the girls at five-thirty; they were happily 

   

 watching television, and she promised to be back at a quarter after 

 six. 

   

 Ten minutes later the doorbell rang, and Merrisue went to answer it. 

 Before she opened the door, she flipped on the porch light, but the 

 bulb remained dark.   There was a big man standing there, a stranger. 

 He wore a brown suede jacket with a hood, blue jeans, blue-and-white 

 ski gloves, and jogging shoes. 

   

 He smiled at Merrisue and brushed past her without being invited into 

 the house.   &quot;My car broke down,&quot; he said.   &quot;I need to use the phone. 

 Where is it?&quot; 

   

 The child pointed toward the kitchen.   The big man was already in the 

 house, and she didn&apos;t know how to ask him to leave.   She watched him 

 dial, but she suspected he was just making up numbers.   He hung up 

 the phone and turned toward her.   &quot;The line&apos;s busy.   where&apos;s your 

 mother?&quot; 

   

 Her words popped out before she thought, and then it was too late. 

 &quot;She&apos;s at the gym.   She&apos;ll be back in half an hour.&quot; 

   

 He smiled and looked at the two little girls.   &quot;Can I watch TV with 

 you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No,&quot; Merrisue said firmly.   &quot;You can call somebody, but then you 

 have to go.   We&apos;ll wait by the door until you&apos;re finished with the 

 phone.&quot; 

   

 She heard him dial again and talk to somebody named &quot;Jim,&quot; but she 

 wasn&apos;t sure there was really anyone on the other end.   She&apos;d seen bad 

 guys do that on television, just pretend to talk to someone.   He was 

 telling &quot;Jim&quot; that his car had broken down and he could use a ride. 

 Jim was supposed to pick him up by Albertson&apos;s supermarket. 

   

 Merrisue hadn&apos;t heard a car outside, and she couldn&apos;t understand why 

 he had picked their house to come to. 

   

 The man smiled at her again, but there was something about him that 

 made her shiver; she wished she hadn&apos;t answered the door. 

   

 &quot;Can I just stay in the house to keep warm?&quot;   he asked.   &quot;I could 

 watch TV with you until my friend gets here.&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   I told you no.   We&apos;re not supposed to let strangers in.&quot; 

   

 &quot;But I&apos;m already in,&quot; he argued. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m scared,&quot; Megan whispered.   She ran into the master bathroom, 

 leaving Merrisue alone with the tall dark man. 

   

 &quot;I think I&apos;ll just watch some television with you,&quot; he coaxed. 

   

 &quot;No,&quot; she faltered.   &quot;I told you you couldn&apos;t.&quot; 

   

 And then the man pulled a silver gun out of his pocket and grabbed 

 her by the shoulder.   &quot;This is a real gun.   You get into the bathroom 

 where your sister is.   You do what I say.&quot; 

   

 She did what he said.   Grown women had been terrified by this man and 

 his silver gun.   Merrisue was so frightened she could barely walk. 

 The man showed the gun to Megan too. 

   

 &quot;Now, both of you, take off your clothes.&quot; 

   

 The gunman subjected the children to the same abuse that his adult 

 victims had endured.   The fact that they were only children didn&apos;t 

 seem to bother him at all.   He fondled Merrisue&apos;s barely discernible 

 breasts and complained at their smallness.   He touched 

   

 eight-year-old Megan&apos;s genitals while she sobbed in terror.   And then 

 he revealed his erect penis and demanded that they fellate him, that 

 they masturbate him.   Terrorized, they obeyed.   He ejaculated and 

 forced his ten-year-old victim to swallow semen. 

   

 In shock over a bestial act she could not understand, and gagging, 

 Merrisue wiped her face and mouth with a towel.   She thought that the 

 man was probably going to shoot them.   He toyed with the gun while 

 the little girls cringed against the tub.   Merrisue prayed that it 

 was only a toy gun.   After a long time the man told them to get 

 dressed and that they must stay in the bathroom.   If they came out, 

 something bad would happen to them.   They clung together, afraid that 

 he was still someplace in the house. 

   

 At ten minutes after six their mother came home.   Despite the January 

 chill, the front door was standing wide open.   Alarmed, she walked 

 into the kitchen and saw that the phone was off the hook.   When she 

 tried to replace the receiver, she couldn&apos;t find it.   It wasn&apos;t 

 anyplace in the room. 

   

 She called for her children, and heard Merrisue answer from the 

 bathroom, &quot;Can we come out now?&quot; 

   

 Running toward the bathroomn, she met her daughters. 

   

 &quot;There&apos;s a burglar in the house,&quot; Merrisue gasped.   &quot;I think he&apos;s 

 still here.&quot; 

   

 Mrs.   Green didn&apos;t stop to look around; she grabbed her children and 

 ran for a neighbor&apos;s house, where she called theCorvallis police. 

   

 Merrisue and Megan made excellent witnesses; they had memorized 

 everything they could about their attacker.   They&apos;d seen the &quot;San 

 Francisco&quot; label on his blue jeans, the white X&apos;s on the back. 

   

 &quot;He had a beard--a funny beard,&quot; Merrisue told detectives.   &quot;I don&apos;t 

 think it was real.   I don&apos;t think the gun was real, either.   I think 

 it was a toy gun.   He was going to shoot us, but he couldn&apos;t.&quot; 

   

 It had not been a toy gun, of course.   It was a real gun. 

   

 The Corvallis attack outraged lawmen.   Taboos as old as civilization 

 had been broken.   Initially the perversions against the Green 

 children seemed to have no connection to the fast-food robberies. 

 Even sexual psychopaths have &quot;rules.&quot;   It is rare indeed for men who 

 attack mature females to violate children or for pedophiles to seek 

 out adult women as victims.   When a sexual criminal moves outside his 

 victim pattern, it is an indication that he is in the grip of almost 

 maniacal frenzy. 

   

 He was a murder looking for a place to happen. 

   

 And, still, the man with the silver gun retained his anonymity.   He 

 was very clever.   He knew the value of moving on before investigators 

 could link him to a series of crimes.   He knew the limitations of 

 their teletype networks.

 The big man ran fluidly and easily, an athlete&apos;s effortless movements 

 Through the dark streets he ran, turning here, turning again, leaving 

 the bleeding women behind him.   The adrenaline he&apos;d always felt on 

 the playing field when the pressure was on coursed full strength 

 through his blood, making him feel as 

   

 though he could run ten miles, twenty miles, without stopping.   He 

 could do anything! 

   

 He had done it; he had orchestrated the whole scene to his own plan. 

 He had found the girls there, just as if they were waiting for him, 

 and he had made them do all the things he liked.   He had humbled 

 them, and toyed with them, and finally he had destroyed them.   He 

 felt as if he were the most powerful male who had ever lived; he was 

 consumed with his own power.   No woman would ever, ever control him 

 again. 

   

 The streets were so quiet, as quiet as death itself.   No one had seen 

 him.   No one would ever know that he had been the one. 

   

 It was cold, but he was perspiring, just the way he always did in 

 sports.   This was a kind of sport, if you looked at it from the 

 proper perspective.   Stalking the women, finding them, and then being 

 so strong and confident that they obeyed his orders. 

   

 But this game had been the best game so far; this was the first time 

 he had killed women simply because they were female.   Strangers. 

 Nobodies.   If they weren&apos;t dead by now, they soon would be. 

   

 They wouldn&apos;t tell on him the way girls always tattled.   They could 

 only lie there in pools of their own blood, silenced .   .   punished. 

   

 He allowed himself to stop running.   He walked easily now, pulling 

 his hood closer around his face.   He felt invisible.   He didn&apos;t even 

 need to look away from the headlights that were bearing down on him. 

 He was invisible. 

   

 Salem, Oregon, January 18, 1981, 21:54 hours. 

   

 Salem Fire and Ambulance Dispatch Hotline..   911. 

   

 Zena Harp and Dave Cameron were working the late-evening shift on 

 this black, moonless Sunday.   A quiet night; there was time to talk, 

 time to complain desultorily about the weather--as if the threat of 

 rain were not the expected, accepted condition for January in Oregon. 

 And yet, they were not bored.   No one is ever bored while manning an 

 emergency hot line.   The next call or the one after that--may signal 

 catastrophe. 

   

 Now, just six minutes before ten PM., the phone brrr-ed, its red 

 bubble light blinking frantically.   Zena Harp reached for the 

 receiver, and Dave Cameron picked up another to monitor the call. 

   

 And, instantly, each of them tensed.   This was not a routine call; 

 this was trouble.   They heard a woman&apos;s voice, a faint voice, full of 

 pain and terror.   &quot;We&apos;ve been shot...please help us!&quot;   Zena Harp kept 

 her own voice calm; she had to find out location, specifics, before 

 she could send help.   &quot;Where are you?&quot;   There was a long pause, so 

 long that Ms. Harp thought the caller had gone off the line.   And 

 then the voice came again, more faint, if possible, than it had been 

 before.   &quot;...River Road...or Commercial Street.&quot; 

   

 *&quot;What address?&quot; 

   

 near the Fun Machine.&quot;   Dave Cameron had heard enough; he knew where 

 the Fun Machine was on the outskirts of Salem near Keizer--and he 

   

 could pinpoint the location enough to dial the telephone operator and 

 ask for an emergency trace.   Within moments the operator reported 

 that the call was coming in from the TransAmerica Title 

   

 Building.   Now Cameron reacted almost automatically; asking the 

 operator to patch the call into the Salem Police Department&apos;s 

 Communications Center.   And then he dispatched paramedics from the 

   

 Keizer Fire Department and an ambulance to the building where the 

 woman waited. 

   

 While this was being done, Zena Harp talked to the terrified woman. 

 &quot;Please hurry,&quot; the girl begged.   &quot;He&apos;s gonna come back and kill me. 

 I think she&apos;s dead.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you want me to stay on the line?&quot;   Ms. Harp soothed.   &quot;An 

 ambulance is on the way.&quot; 

   

 The girl on the other end was drifting away.   Her voice was thready, 

 and her answers weren&apos;t responsive.   &quot;Oh...oh, I think she&apos;s dead.&quot; 

   

 The patch had been made within a matter of a few minutes.   Zena Harp 

 handed the caller over to the Salem police dispatcher. 

   

 Liz Cameron, the Com Center operator for the Salem Police Department, 

 spoke to the woman in the TransAmerica Title Building.   There was no 

 time now to speculate on why anyone would be in the office building 

 late on a Sunday evening.   Liz knew that an ambulance and Marion 

 County Sheriff&apos;s squad cars 

   

 were on the way.   She had to find out as much as she could.   if the 

 gunman was still in the building, the officers had to be warned. 

   

 &quot;Ma&apos;am,&quot; Liz Cameron began, &quot;what is your name?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Beth Wilmot.   I&apos;ve been shot in the head.   Hurry!&quot; 

   

 &quot;We have an ambulance on the way.   Who shot you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Some man...I don&apos;t know...with a gun.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.&quot; 

   

 &quot;We were cleaning the office, and he came in.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   We have somebody on the way.   Can you tell me what he looked 

 like at all?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Ah...Oh, my God.   He had dark brown hair.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Dark brown hair.&quot; 

   

 &quot;And he had...he had a Band-Aid on his nose.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   Was he a white man?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes.&quot; 

   

 &quot;About how old would you say he is?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know.   Around twenty-seven.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay, and how tall?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Oh, I...ah, five ah nine, six foot, I don&apos;t know.   Something like 

 that.   Five-nine, a little over the average size of --&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you remember what he was wearing?&quot; 

   

 To a layman, Cameron&apos;s questions might seem harsh, but she was 

 sending policemen into an area where they might well be perfect 

 targets.   They had to know who their enemy was.   The woman on the 

 phone sounded weak but rational.   Later, Liz Cameron would marvel at 

 the victim&apos;s ability to respond--later, when she learned the extent 

 of the girl&apos;s injuries. 

   

 &quot;Do you remember what he was wearing?&quot;   Liz Cameron probed. 

   

 &quot;Oh..   .ah...ah.   acoat...ah.&quot; 

   

 &quot;A coat.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Ah...leather coat, or something.&quot; 

   

 &quot;A leather coat.&quot; 

   

 &quot;And a pair of cheap jeans.&quot; 

   

 &quot;And jeans.   Okay, you stay right on this phone with me.   We have 

 several people on the way.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ll wait.&quot; 

   

 &quot;And we have an ambulance coming too.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Could I just give you a number so you...so I could call home, 

 please, just call them...&quot; 

   

 &quot;I&apos;d like to keep you on the line, if I could, until a deputy arrives 

 and makes sure you are all right.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Oh, my head...Hurry.   It hurts.&quot; 

   

 There was another long pause.   Liz wondered if Beth had lost 

 consciousness, and then her voice came again, pleading for help. 

   

 &quot;I hurt...I hear the ambulance.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Just a minute more.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Poor Shari is going to die.&quot; 

   

 &quot;The lady who was shot?&quot;   The police dispatcher thought that Beth was 

 talking about her own injuries.   The whole conversation was 

 garbled--the frantic girl on the phone, and Liz Cameron trying to 

 keep a lid on the hysteria she could hear bubbling up. 

   

 &quot;She is going to die.   We didn&apos;t do anything.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   The ambulance should be there anytime.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Talk to me,&quot; the girl pleaded.   &quot;So you&apos;ll make me feel better, 

 please.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   I&apos;ll talk to you, Beth.   How do you feel now?   Any better?&quot; 

   

 &quot;ah...ah, a little better.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   You just calm down.   There&apos;s going to be somebody there 

 shortly.   Is there anyone else there with you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I should go home now, but I hurt.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Is there anybody else there with you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes, my girlfriend.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay, what&apos;s your girlfriend&apos;s name?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Shari Hull.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Is she waiting for the ambulance to let them in?&quot; 

   

 &quot;It&apos;s open.   The door&apos;s open.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   Which way did the man go when he left?   Did you see?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t know--my head was down.   I was on the ground when he shot 

 us.   He told us to put our heads down.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   Well, we have somebody almost there.   We are going to let 

 them talk to you...and is your friend there?   I could talk to her 

 too.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Oh,&quot; the girl cried, &quot;I don&apos;t know what happened.   She&apos;s on the 

 ground.   Please don&apos;t talk to her.   She&apos;s...I think...almost dead.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did he shoot her?&quot;   Liz Cameron had thus far thought that Beth 

 Wilmot was the only victim--that Beth&apos;s friend was waiting to signal 

 in the deputies and the ambulance.   Now the situation sounded even 

 more desperate than it had first appeared. 

   

 &quot;Yes.&quot; 

   

 &quot;He shot--&quot; 

   

 &quot;He shot five times,&quot; the girl blurted. 

   

 &quot;He shot her as well?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes.   Yes, three times.   I can hear her breathing really hard.   I&apos;m 

 afraid he&apos;s going to come back.   Please hurry!&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   We have people on the way.   Okay, have you ever seen him 

 before?   Did he leave in a vehicle--you know--a car?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t know.   Her truck is running though.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Her truck is running?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   What kind of a truck does she have?&quot; 

   

 &quot;She has a Bronco.&quot; 

   

 &quot;A Bronco.&quot; 

   

 &quot;A green Bronco &apos;cause we had it running &apos;cause we were about to 

 leave.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   Which room are you in there?   Is there... is it--?&quot; 

   

 &quot;It&apos;s just a little office.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay, just a minute, Beth.   Okay.   We have somebody who will be 

 there real shortly.   You keep talking to me.   Can you give me your 

 home phone number in case we need that?&quot; 

   

 &quot;555-5411.   It&apos;s an answering service, but nobody is home and they 

 will...Oh!   Somebody is here.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   Somebody there now?&quot; 

   

 &quot;The ambulance.   Can I hang up now?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   You see the ambulance?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay, you go over to the ambulance now.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Bye-bye,&quot; the girl named Beth whispered.

 The TransAmerica Title Building--from which the frantic call foor 

 help had come was only one of several in the business complex on 

 River Road, the area just beyond Salem&apos;s city limits. 

   

 The complex was new construction, solid modern buildings and 

 businesses separated by parking areas.   On a weekday, the region 

 would have been full of people, but on this gloomy black Sunday, the 

 entire complex seemed hollow and deserted.   Even the eating 

 establishments nearby were closed; their customers were home for the 

 weekend. 

   

 Indeed, aside from the two girls who were in the TransAmerica 

 Building, only a handful of people were in the entire complex. 

   

 Two women worked in the back room of the Celebrations Designs bridal 

 shop almost directly across the parking lot from the entrance to the 

 TransAmerica offices.   Dorothy Hall, the owner of the 

 custom-bridal-gown shop, had had no choice that after&apos;noon; she had 

 promised to have a bridal gown and bridesmaids&apos; dresses finished in 

 time for a wedding.   She had worked in the sewing room of her shop 

 since late afternoon, stitching beading, lace, yards and yards of 

 delicate wedding finery.   One of her seamstresses, Bev Johnson, 

 worked with her, and Mrs. Hall&apos;s daughter, Patrice Walters, had 

 promised to come in later to help. 

   

 Mrs.   Hall had felt a little uneasy all afternoon.   She&apos;d commented 

 to Ms. Johnson how lonely and almost &quot;spooky&quot; the mall seemed when 

 its weekday inhabitants were gone; it seemed a modern ghost town, all 

 concrete and walls of black windows that only occasionally reflected 

 headlights of the few cars that passed by.   She regretted that she 

 had asked her daughter to come down in the evening to work alone. 

 Even though her shop locked up tightly, she worried. 

  

 Time had passed rapidly throughout the afternoon and into the 

 evening, and Mrs. Hall was surprised when her daughter arrived and 

 announced that it was a quarter after nine.   The gowns were almost 

 finished, and Patrice said she would stay and put on the finishing 

 touches.   The three women chatted for a few minutes, and Mrs. Hall 

 heard the nine-thirty news broadcast come on the little radio in the 

 back room.   She looked at the clock then to confirm the time, and 

 left with her seamstress, but only after warning Patrice again to be 

 sure that she kept the doors locked and the lights out in the 

 showroom facing the mall. 

   

 &quot;Don&apos;t advertise that anybody&apos;s in here,&quot; she told her daughter. 

 &quot;Just stay back in the sewing room, and don&apos;t stay late.&quot; 

   

 Dorothy Hall was exhausted and anxious to get home for a hot bath and 

 something to eat, but as she walked to her car, she saw that there 

 was a reddish four-wheel-drive vehicle with its motor running, parked 

 on the south side of the TransAmerica Building.   Seeing the 

 unfamiliar vehicle there, and knowing her daughter was alone, she was 

 disturbed as she drove away from the area, disttirbed enough that she 

 turned her car around and came back. 

   

 She saw that the lights were on in the TransAmerica Building, and she 

 drove slowly around the structure to see if anyone was inside.   It 

 was easy to see in; the building had window walls on all four sides, 

 and the windows fronting the parking lot had only tie-back curtains. 

 The windows on the River Road side were covered now by blinds.   But 

 even with the blinds, it was possible to see every part of the 

 building from the outside, all of the rooms except for the employees&apos; 

 lunchroom. 

   

 The parked truck was empty.   Odd that it should be sitting there 

 empty with its motor running.   But then Mrs. Hall looked into the 

 TransAmerica Building and was suddenly relieved.   She saw two young 

 girls dressed in old clothes--obviously a janitorial crew.   One of 

 the girls was down on her hands and knees scrubbing the foyer of the 

 building and the other stood beside her with a broom in her hands. 

 The front door of the building was closed, and presumably locked. 

 The bridal-shop owner concluded that the unfamiliar truck belonged to 

 the girls who were cleaning. 

   

 Mrs.   Hall eased her car slowly out of the mall.   She saw no one 

 else, no one walking, no other cars.   The area north of the complex 

 was deserted too, except for two boys she saw cleaning the floors of 

 an ice-cream parlor. 

   

 One thought struck her; the boys were moving vigorously as they 

 swabbed the ice creamery &apos;s floors, and the girls in the TransAmerica 

 Building seemed like frozen statues in comparison. 

   

 And then Mrs. Hall drove on home. 

   

 It was nine-thirty-five P.M. 

   

 Patrice Walters sewed for an hour in the back room of the bridal 

 shop.   She had the radio turned down low, and she heard loud bangs 

 somewhere between nine-thirty and ten PM.   It sounded as if someone 

 had slammed the lid of the dumpster garbage bin outside.   She 

 wondered idly who else might be in the area, but it didn&apos;t really 

 concern her; she was too involved in her work. 

   

 When Patrice walked out of the shop at ten-thirty, she heard sirens 

 keening in the distance and then drawing closer.   Most startling, the 

 parking lot in front of the TransAmerica Title Building was already 

 alive with flashing blue and red lights.   She saw aid cars, an 

 ambulance, and county sheriffs cars, with more deputies&apos; vehicles 

 racing in. 

   

 She could not imagine what might have happened. 

   

 Over the last half hour, while Patrice sewed on, completely unaware 

 of what was happening outside her mother&apos;s darkened shop, the police 

 radio channels had been alive with communiccations going back and 

 forth.   Beth Wilmot&apos;s first call had been monitored at six minutes to 

 ten.   The patrol deputies&apos; voices responding to Com Center&apos;s request 

 for their locations began to cut in at three minutes to ten. 

   

 The operator&apos;s terse announcement: &quot;Roger 9 and 112, we have a 

 shooting at the TransAmerica Title at River Road and Chersy.   It is 

 unknown circumstances.   The fire department called it in.&quot; 

   

 &quot;112 copy.&quot;   (Deputy acknowledges call.) 

   

 &quot;145 to 112, do you want us to roll?&quot;   (Another deputy offers to 

 help.) 

   

 &quot;Roger 9.   Copy.   En route.&quot; 

   

 &quot;112 to 145.   That&apos;s affirmative.&quot; 

   

 Dispatcher: &quot;112, this should be the cross street.   It should be 

 Hollyhock.   Evidently the victim was cleaning the office when a male 

 subject came in.   Fire advises she was shot in the head.   Suspect 

 description is a white male, twenty-seven, five-feet-nine, with brown 

 hair.   He was wearing a leather coat and jeans.   Has a Band-Aid on 

 his nose.&quot; 

   

 Precious little information for officers going into an unknown 

 situation where a suspect is armed with a gun.   But that was all Liz 

 Cameron had been able to elicit from Beth Wilmot.   If the man was 

 still in the building--a building with windows on all four sides--no 

 deputy going in would have a chance. 

   

 With a wounded victim--probably two wounded victims--in the building, 

 no deputy had a choice. 

   

 Roger 9, Reserve Deputy Greg Roach, was the first deputy to arrive at 

 the TransAmerica Title Building.   He made the River Road address in a 

 minute and a half with blue lights revolving and siren screaming. 

 The aid unit from the Keizer Fire Department had arrived thirty 

 seconds earlier.   One of the emergency medical technicians ran over 

 to him. 

   

 &quot;There&apos;s someone moving around in the building.&quot; 

   

 Roach looked into the glass-walled structure and saw a naked female 

 in the main office portion; she was walking toward an office located 

 in the southwest corner of the building.   He looked in that 

 direction, he saw a second young woman lying on the floor in a prone 

 position.   She too was nude.   Her face was turned away from his view, 

 but he could see a spreading pool of blood around her head.   For just 

 a moment he felt as if he were viewing a movie screen showing a 

 horror film instead of seeing reality, shockingly true, in the 

 well-lit building. 

   

 Roach instructed the fire personnel to wait outside, drew his service 

 revolver, and entered the building.   He dared not wait for backup 

 from other deputies.   The women inside might die if he did.   He felt 

 the hairs prickle at the back of his neck as he checked each room for 

 a suspect who might be waiting with his own gun ready.   The offices, 

 the restroom--all empty.   Roach came to one locked door.   He debated 

 only a second.   He kicked the door and the lock gave.   The room was 

 empty. 

   

 Roach signaled to the paramedics that it was safe to enter.   There 

 was no place else inside where the assailant might be hiding. 

   

 Sergeant Will Hingston in Unit 112 arrived sixty seconds after Deputy 

 Roach, and within minutes the building was surrounded by every Marion 

 County officer available in that section of the county: Deputies 

 Bernie Papenfus, Frank Crandall, Don Delan, John Braun, Detectives 

 Dave Kominek and Jay Boutwell, Lieutenant Kilburn Mccoy, Captain 

 Richard Bay, and Undersheriff Robert Prinslow. 

   

 The Keizer fire chief, John Sanford, and his emergency medical 

 technicians and paramedics advised the lawmen that there seemed to be 

 two grievously wounded young women. 

   

 Beth Wilmot was in deep shock; she was unaware that she was nude, and 

 the paramedics covered her with a blanket.   One of her eyes was 

 blackened and the right side of her face was oddly swollen and 

 bruised.   Blood oozed from a spot near her right ear. 

   

 When a medic examined her, he gasped and looked up in amazement. 

   

 &quot;She&apos;s been shot in the head.   We&apos;ll have to transport her at once.&quot; 

   

 Deputy Bernie Papenfus was assigned to ride in the ambulance with 

 Beth as she was rushed to Salem Memorial Hospital. 

   

 The other victim, the girl Beth had said was Shari Hull, was in much 

 worse shape.   She was comatose, and the Keizer paramedics found that 

 she had sustained three wounds to the head, wounds that appeared to 

 have been caused by bullets.   Shari&apos;s vital signs were almost too 

 faint to be measured.   The medics shook their heads as they attempted 

 to find some indication that the slender girl might survive.   They 

 &quot;bagged&quot; her--forced oxygen into her lungs--as she was lifted onto a 

 gurney and wheeled rapidly toward an ambulance. 

   

 Accompanied by Detective Boutwell and Deputy Dolan, Shari too was 

 rushed to Salem Memorial. 

   

 Beth remained amazingly coherent as she rode in the ambulance.   She 

 was able to tell Deputy Papenfus that she and her best friend, Shari, 

 cleaned the TransAmerica Building every Sunday. 

   

 &quot;We were almost finished.   Shari went outside to her car, and I had a 

 little cleaning left to do.   I was just rounding a corner, going 

 toward the entrance, when I saw Shari and this man walking toward me. 

 He had a long-barreled gun in his right hand.   He took us to a room 

 and told us to take off all our clothes--that he wouldn&apos;t hurt us. 

 He made us lie down on the floor.   We did that, and then he shot 

 Shari in the head, and then he shot me.   I pretended to be dead, and 

 I could hear Shari moaning.   Then I heard another shot, and heard the 

 man--leave.   When I was pretty sure he was gone, I crawled to the 

 phone in the office and called the fire department.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Had you ever seen the man before?&quot;   Papenfus asked. 

   

 &quot;No.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did he molest either--either of you?&quot;   Papenfus asked gently.   &quot;Did 

 he rape you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No,&quot; the girl whispered, and added somewhat obscurely, &quot;No, I never 

 touched him.&quot; 

   

 Perhaps the shock and her terrible wounds had temporarily blocked the 

 ugliest memories for Beth Wilmot.   Perhaps she could not yet bring 

 herself to tell anyone what the man had done to them. 

   

 Papenfus sensed a rage in Beth.   She was shaking from shock, but she 

 was also livid with anger that a stranger could have shot her and 

 Shari.   She insisted on giving a description of their attacker again. 

   

 &quot;He was a white man, in his mid-twenties, five-feet-eleven to six 

 feet.   Slender build.   Dark brown hair.   Hooded black leather 

 waist-length jacket.   Band-Aid...a Band-Aid on his nose.&quot; 

   

 Beth was not as sure about the gun; she wasn&apos;t familiar with guns. 

 Papenfus made a move to show her his own service weapon for 

 comparison purposes, but the sight of a gun--any gun--sent Beth into 

 hysterics, and he quickly slipped the gun back into its holster. 

   

 Again and again Beth begged Papenfus, &quot;Will I be all right?   Am I 

 going to die?&quot; 

  

 Papenfus assured her that she would be all right, although looking at 

 the blood, her blackened eye, and swollen face, he was not sure. 

   

 &quot;Shari!&quot;   Beth kept asking.   &quot;Is she all right?   Is she gonna die? 

 She was breathing so funny, and moaning, and she wouldn&apos;t talk to me. 

 Is Shari gonna die?&quot; 

   

 The deputy didn&apos;t want to answer that question.   Shari Hull had lain 

 so quietly on the lunchroom carpet, and there had been so much blood, 

 pints of it seemingly, seeping steadily from her head, and a slight 

 protrusion of brain matter from the wounds.   Papenfus knew that it 

 would take a miracle for Shari Hull to survive. 

   

 There would be no miracle.   Shari Hull, twenty years old, died in the 

 emergency room of Salem Memorial Hospital at onetwenty A.M.   without 

 regaining consciousness. 

   

 While Bernie Papenfus waited outside the emergency room for Beth to 

 be examined, a memory kept coming back to him--a recent memory. 

 While he was racing to the TransAmerica Building on the Code 3 call, 

 he had rounded the corner of Broadway and Pine Street at about four 

 minutes after ten.   He had just heard the description of the suspect 

 given by the dispatcher, the same description that Beth would repeat 

 to him later in the ambulance.   At that moment, as he turned the 

 corner, he had seen a man standing in a well-lit area only ten feet 

 from his patrol car.   The man had stared back at him boldly, almost 

 challengingly.   It was one of those moments that are over almost with 

 the blinking of an eye but which etch themselves indelibly in the 

 subconscious mind, only to be recalled later in perfect detail.   The 

 man had worn jeans and a fleece jacket--but Papenfus had had the 

 impression that the jacket was turned inside out. 

   

 That corner had been 1.2 miles from the shooting scene.   Only an 

 athlete could have run so far in the short time since the first call 

 for help had come in, But it was possible to cover a mile in that 

 time, if the runner was young and in prime condition. 

   

 Papenfus had eased his foot onto the brake pedal and had radioed for 

 a better description on the suspect, but then another deputy&apos;s voice 

 had cut into the radio with the report that the gunman might still be 

 in the building at the crime scene.   Papenfus had hit the accelerator 

 then and headed for the shooting scene.   Now he remembered the man 

 standing on the corner, the dark eyes that had stared back at him 

 without flinching.   He saw that face in his mind; he would never 

 forget that face.   What if he had stopped and questioned the guy?   He 

 berated himself that he had not, but hindsight is always clearer. 

 Papenfus had assumed that he was needed to back up officers at the 

 shooting scene.   No, knowing what he knew at the time, he should not 

 have stopped. 

   

 In his own mind the deputy was sure that he had stared into the eyes 

 of the killer.   And now the killer was long gone. 

   

 The physicians treating Beth Wilmot looked at the slender dark-haired 

 young woman who seemed younger than the age she gave 

 them--twenty--and marveled that she still lived, although her 

 condition was clearly critical.   When they had washed the blood from 

 her face and hair, the doctors found a flattened slug, probably a 

 .32-caliber bullet, nestled in the matted hair at the back of her 

 head.   It had not penetrated the skull, but the force from the bullet 

 would have been powerful enough to knock her off her feet.   The 

 ammunition might have been old, or it might have been fired from a 

 gun of the wrong caliber, or Beth Wilmot might be one of those rare 

 individuals whose skull density is thicker than normal--thick enough 

 to protect the brain even against a bullet. 

   

 Moreover, X rays indicated that there was a second bullet, a slug 

 that had penetrated the scalp at the back of Beth&apos;s head, but, again, 

 not the skull.   This bullet had only plowed a furrow beneath the skin 

 on the right side of her head and come finally to rest just in front 

 of her ear.   Beth Wilmot had beaten death.   Twice. 

   

 Dr.   Robert Buza removed this second bullet and turned it over to 

 Detective Jay Boutwell, who entered it into evidence, along with the 

 first bullet found in Beth&apos;s hair. 

   

 Beth had denied that the gunman had sexually attacked either her or 

 Shari when she gave her first statement in the ambulance, but swabs 

 were used to check for the possible presence of semen in the mouths, 

 rectums, and vaginal vaults of the two victims. 

   

 These swabs were then saturated with acid phosphatase.   The telltale 

 bright pinkish-purple reaction that indicates the presence of male 

 ejaculate appeared on the swab from Beth&apos;s throat. 

   

 The killer had ejaculated into her mouth. 

   

 Beth had not lied, Beth had only denied the memory of the nightmare 

 she had endured.   Later, she would remember...and wish that she had 

 not. 

   

 Dave Kominek was one of the two detectives on call that dark night in 

 January.   He had already responded to one homicide scene earlier in 

 the day, and now he&apos;d been summoned to the shooting scene.   Detective 

 Jay Boutwell was at the hospital, and Kominek would remain at the 

 TransAmerica Building to process the crime scene. 

   

 Kominek is a compactly muscled, intense man, still in his thirties, 

 and he can seem deceptively easygoing off the job.   But Dave Kominek 

 was a detective who had already been involved in most of Marion 

 County&apos;s most intricate homicide probes.   And the county, situated in 

 the idyllic Willamette Valley, had had several bizarre murders in the 

 past half-dozen years--not easy to solve, but solved. 

   

 Married and the father of two sons, Kominek does not come from a 

 family of lawmen, nor did he grow up with a burning ambition to be a 

 cop; he looked upon law enforcement initially as just another job. 

 It was to become a way of life for him. 

   

 Kominek speaks with the &quot;Oregon drawl,&quot; a pattern of speech common to 

 the area around Salem, an accent that sounds almost southern to the 

 untrained ear.   Like many Oregon detectives, Kominek wears cowboy 

 boots, although the &quot;Old West&quot; lives in most of Oregon only in 

 history books.   The band of his hat is a real rattlesnake.   He traps 

 the snakes himself, and fashions the distinctive bands.   He 

 skis--both snow and water-in his spare time, plays tournament golf, 

 and he built his family home from the ground up, but his true love is 

 police work. 

   

 Born in Nebraska, Kominek moved to Salem with his family when he was 

 ten years old.   He grew up there, the middle son in a family of three 

 boys.   &quot;We&apos;re one hundred percent Czechoslovakian on both sides--both 

 my mom and dad,&quot; he comments. 

   

 After graduating from high school in 1964, Kominek married.   &quot;My 

 friends told me I was crazy to get married so young.&quot;   He laughs. 

 &quot;But that was the smartest decision I ever made.&quot; 

   

 He joined the Air Force and was sent to Vietnam on a flight crew, 

 where his job was &quot;basically balancing airplanes.   I was a load 

 master on a four-engine turbo-prop C-l 30.&quot;   After Vietnam, Kominek 

 was assigned to a base in South Carolina, where he served for two 

 more years on a flight crew as a load master on C-141&apos;s.   &quot;It wasn&apos;t 

 a difficult job; those are the most forgiving airplanes flying.&quot;   The 

 Komineks&apos; son Eric was born while they were in South Carolina. 

   

 Back in Oregon after his service stint, Kominek attended Oregan State 

 University for three years, taking engineering and business courses. 

 Police work was the farthest thing from his mind. 

   

 But by now, Kominek and his wife, Gail, had a second son, Chad, and 

 family responsibilities demanded that Dave take a full-time job 

 before he could graduate from Oregon State.   He bought a truck, but 

 the man he worked for went bankrupt.   He applied for several jobs, 

 including that of deputy with the Marion County Sheriff&apos;s Office.   &quot;I 

 had halfway decent qualifications.   I&apos;d never been in trouble--and 

 that was the main qualification.   They hired me.&quot; 

   

 That was in February 1973.   In March 1974 Kominek went undercover, 

 working narcotics investigations.   He grew a beard and long hair and 

 wore the garb of the &quot;doper.&quot;   His own mother wouldn&apos;t have 

 recognized him on the street.   He was a member of MINT (Marion 

 Interagency Narcotics Team).   After some tense experiences during his 

 year as a narc, Kominek moved into the Detective Unit. 

   

 He had scarcely had time to become oriented to his new assignment 

 when he and Detective Sergeant Jim Byrnes were plunged into the 

 macabre investigation of the murder of a woman whose mutilated body 

 was found--literally in sections--floating in a river outside Salem. 

 They identified the victim as a woman visiting relatives in the Salem 

 area.   The last time anyone had seen her alive, she had been having a 

 drink at a popular restaurant.   The only physical evidence Byrnes and 

 Kominek had was a receipt from a local dump, but the two detectives 

 used that--and a lot of legwork--to trace the killer, a recent 

 parolee from the Oregon State Penitentiary.   The man had been sent up 

 a dozen years before for an almost identical crime.   His victims were 

 all strangled and then dismembered. 

   

 &quot;Jim and I worked the same way--all-out.   That usually meant 

 thirty-six to forty-eight hours at a stretch, without sleep, until we 

 found our killer.   You can always catch up on sleep, but you can&apos;t 

 afford to give murderers the luxury of time.&quot; 

   

 Kominek and Byrnes worked together for two years, a period of 

 epidemic violent crime in Marion County, and Kominek learned rapidly 

 When Byrnes left the sheriff&apos;s office to become an investigator for 

 the Oregon State Attorney General&apos;s Office, Kominek found himself the 

 lead investigator of homicides in the Marion County Sheriff&apos;s Office. 

 He was not quite thirty years old. 

   

 Kominek took advantage of every seminar and school available in 

 homicide investigation on subjects ranging from blood pattern 

 evaluation to hypnosis of victims and witnesses.   He was particularly 

 fascinated with hypnosis as a tool in policework, and rapidly became 

 adept at the sometimes controversial art that some experts feel can 

 unlock the subconscious memory of those who have endured severe 

 trauma.   When he attended the homicide school at the Southern Police 

 Institute at the University of Louisville--the homicide school in 

 America--Dave Kominek ended up teaching the techniques of hypnotizing 

 eyewitnesses. 

   

 As a homicide investigator, Dave Kominek proved to have that ability 

 that all good detectives have, the innate sixth sense that makes him 

 doubt the obvious, that compels him to dig beneath the surface of 

 what seems to be the truth.   One of his earliest cases involved the 

 &quot;suicide&quot; of an older man, a boarder in a private home.   &quot;His 

 landlady said he was depressed, that he&apos;d just picked up her gun and 

 shot himself in the neck.   But something bothered me when I viewed 

 the body at autopsy.   For one thing, male suicides don&apos;t shoot 

 themselves in the neck--they aim at their temples or into their 

 mouths.   Number two: there were no powder burns--none.   We checked 

 ballistics, and we found that old man would have had to have had arms 

 forty-two inches long--minimum--in order to shoot himself and leave 

 no debris from the barrel around the wound.   We went back and found 

 there had been an eyewitness, another old guy who had been terrified 

 to talk for fear he&apos;d get shot too.   He finally told us that the 

 landlady had shot our victim--because he wouldn&apos;t run an errand for 

 her!   We didn&apos;t think she should go to prison, because she was 

 clearly off the track, but we wanted to find out the truth.   She was 

 committed to the state mental hospital.&quot; 

   

 Throughout the next years, Kominek worked dozens of murder cases, 

 many of them taking him to distant parts of the United States before 

 they were successfully concluded.   He admits that he can be a 

 stubborn bulldozer when he&apos;s working a homicide, although he is quick 

 to give credit to other detectives and forensic science experts who 

 have worked beside him. 

   

 On this gloomy Sunday night in January 1981, the term &quot;I-5 Killer&quot; 

 had not yet been coined.   None of the investigators knew that a 

 Pandora&apos;s box of sexually motivated murders had been opened wide. 

 What they did have was bad enough. 

   

 Kominek had already notified the office manager for TransAmerica, who 

 came to the scene and viewed the offices.   The manager found nothing 

 missing.   Obviously theft had been neither the primary nor the 

 secondary motivation for the carnage. 

   

 Shari Hull&apos;s father, rendered almost speechless by the news of the 

 shootings, had finally been able to explain that his janitorial 

 service had no set hours for cleaning the TransAmerica Building, but 

 that the building was the girls&apos; assignment. 

   

 &quot;Shari and Beth must have got there late; they had other buildings to 

 clean this weekend--they should have been finished with the TransAm 

 Building well before nine.   But they were dependable--they would have 

 worked past midnight if they had to to get it done.&quot; 

   

 The immediate concern in the aftermath of the first call for help had 

 been, of course, the survival of the victims.   That is always the 

 first priority for police officers.   If the victim is alive, or might 

 possibly be alive, they must strive to preserve life at all costs. 

 And so there had been paramedics walking through the crime scene, and 

 many deputies helping to search and secure the building.   It was only 

 after Beth and Shari had been rushed to Salem Memorial Hospital that 

 Dave Kominek had time to stand back and observe the shambles murder 

 had left behind, and only then could he attempt to find something 

 that the killer might have inadvertently left. 

   

 A call for assistance from the Oregon State Police Crime Lab had gone 

 out shortly after ten P.M., and Kominek was joined in the eerily 

 empty building at twelve-thirty A.M.   by his lieutenant, Kilburn 

 McCoy, aad Lieutenant William Zeller and Trooper Ray Grimsbo from the 

 state crime lab in Portland.   The need for haste was gone.   There was 

 time now for hours and hours of painstaking work to retrieve physical 

 evidence. 

   

 The red Ford Bronco (mistakenly described as &quot;green&quot; by Beth in her 

 terror) was still parked outside the building, keys in the ignition, 

 engine still running.   There were two women&apos;s purses inside, and the 

 rear window was rolled down, revealing cleaning equipment. 

   

 The lunchroom--where the attack had taken place--was at the end of a 

 short hall leading from the front door of The TransAmerica Building. 

 The floor of the room was strewn with clothing and paraphernalia left 

 behind by the fire department medics.   Two pools of blood, their 

 perimeters already beginning to dry in darker sediments like mud 

 around a pond in deep summer, were at the end of the counter-mute 

 testimony marking where the victims had lain. 

   

 Small-size clothing lay where the garments had been dropped at the 

 gunman&apos;s order: two pairs of blue jeans; a brown-and-white sweater; a 

 blue-and-white sweatshirt; a pair of lavender panties; a pair of 

 green-and-pink bikini panties; a size 32D brassiere, heavily 

 bloodstained; a woman&apos;s white imitation sheepskin jacket; a woman&apos;s 

 brown leather jacket; a pair of brown shoes, their laces still tied; 

 and a pair of blue-and-yellow running shoes, their laces also firmly 

 tied.   All of this clothing clearly had belonged to Shari and Beth. 

   

 There were no clothes left behind by the gunman. 

   

 A ring of keys rested in the middle of the carpet.   But when Kominek 

 tried them in the TransAmerica Building&apos;s front door, they proved to 

 be, as he had feared, only keys to the building. 

   

 There were bullets--one .32-caliber slug caught in the folds of the 

 white coat, and a second, similar bullet nestling on the carpet where 

 the rug abutted the sink counter.   The path of this second bullet 

 could be traced.   There was an indentation in the cabinet door below 

 the sink, and straands of Shari Hull&apos;s light brown hair were embedded 

 in the spot where the bullet had struck the door and ricocheted. 

 There was a hole five inches below the indentation in the cabinet 

 door.   Inside the cabinet, a plastic cleanser can showed damage where 

 the bullet had bounced off it. 

   

 Blood had sprayed over the walls as well as the carpet, and there 

 were smears of red on the phone Beth had used to call for help. 

 Grimsbo&apos;s report noted &quot;white viscous material&quot; (which would prove 

 disappointingly not to be semen when tested) that had seeped into the 

 carpet.   The clothing was bagged and labeled, and the bullets placed 

 carefully in containers that would preserve them just as they had 

 been found.   Slides were taken of the blood that seemed to be 

 everywhere in the room. 

   

 Finally the room was vacuumed carefully, so that all the gunpowder 

 particles, all the hairs, and whatever other debris might have been 

 left could be saved. 

   

 That was all the investigators had as the dawn of January 19, 1981, 

 slowly broke.   If they did not find a gun to match the bullets to, if 

 Beth Wilmot did not survive, or if she could not identify some 

 suspect they might come up with, his semen should prove to have come 

 from a man who was not--like 85 percent of the population--a 

 &quot;secretor&quot; of blood type in his bodily fluids, there was every chance 

 the crime might never be solved.   All detectives agree that the 

 hardest kind of murder case to solve is one in which the victim and 

 killer are strangers to one another; there are no prior threads of 

 confrontation to weave into a meaningful pattern. 

   

 The big man who had wrought such havoc on Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot 

 was out there somewhere, but Dave Kominek had no idea who he might be. 

   

   

                                   3 

   

 Dave Kominek attended the autopsy of Shari Hull&apos;s body at the Howell 

 Edwards Doerksen Funeral Home in Salem, and took the pictures that 

 are a necessary part of a homicide case file. 

   

 Dr.   Ray Patton did the post-mortem exam.   There were no surprises. 

 Shari&apos;s skull had been fractured on the right side; bullets had 

 plowed into the left side of her neck, the right side of her skull 

 three inches above her right ear, and the back of her head.   A fourth 

 wound appeared to be an exit wound.   Fragments had entered the right 

 temple area and virtually obliterated the center of her brain. 

 Shari&apos;s hair--like Beth&apos;s--was blackened with the debris of the gun 

 barrel, a barrel held so close to her head that the killer could not 

 possibly have missed.   The wounds were &quot;execution-style&quot; wounds; the 

 gunman had fired at point-blank range into the back and right side of 

 the helpless girl&apos;s head.   There were no defensive wounds on Shari&apos;s 

 hands.   She had gone down without a fight.   Seeing the damage to 

 Shari, Kominek marveled that Beth could have taken the same bullets 

 and lived. 

   

 While Beth Wilmot continued her almost miraculous recovery, 

 detectives from the Marion County Sheriff&apos;s Office considered the 

 problem of tracking the man who had irrevocably changed his victims&apos; 

 lives in a twenty-minute spate of mindless violence.   The case was a 

 natural-born &quot;loser.&quot;   The killer was a stranger to both girls; Beth 

 was still positive she had never seen him before and she had sensed 

 that Shari didn&apos;t know him either. 

   

 The physical evidence the investigators from Marion County had 

 gleaned was pathetically sparse: the most important items were the 

 bullets.   Criminalist Ray Grimsbo reported that tests had isolated 

 certain characteristics in the slugs.   The bullet retrieved from the 

 sink in the lunchroom at the TransAmerica Building was in fairly good 

 shape.   It was a .32-caliber lead bullet fired weapon with a 

 right-hand twist, and with five lands and grooves etched into its 

 surface by the gun&apos;s barrel.   The gun they were looking for had a 

 barrel land measuring 0.083 inch, and a barrel groove width of 0.103 

 inch.   The other whole bullets had been removed from the victims&apos; 

 bodies and were badly flattened and damaged, as well as stained by 

 the girls&apos; blood.   Still, several of them were intact enough so 

 thatGrhnsbo could determine that they fit into the same class and 

 characteristic parameters of the first bullet.   At this point they 

 were useless, but if and when a suspect gun was located, Grimsbo 

 would be able to tell if that gun had fired the fatal bullets. 

   

 Feeding the specifications into a computer linked to the FBI&apos;s 

 National Crime Information Center, Grimsbo received the information 

 that the bullets had &quot;most likely&quot; come from the following revolvers 

 or nonsemiautomatic weapons: a Smith and Wesson Double Action-Third 

 Model, a Harrington and Richardsson Model 1905 or Young American Bull 

 Dog, an Meriden Fire Arms Company pocket revolver, or a Thames Arms 

 Cornpany pocket revolver.   Guns of these makes were available to 

 Grimsbo, and test-firing had elicited the same right-hand twist, with 

 five lands and grooves.   It was possible, however, that there might 

 be other weapons which would fire in the same pattern. 

   

 Where the death gun was, however, was anybody&apos;s guess.   The killer 

 might still have it with him, or he might have thrown it 

 away--possibly in one of the many rivers that abound in Oregon.   If 

 he still possessed the gun, he might use it again, and ifhe he did, 

 there was a chance that some other police agency would find it.   If... 

   

 Beyond isolating the weapon the killer had cairied, the Oregon State 

 Police Crime Detection lab criminalists had been able to determine 

 the blood type of the killer by testing the semen-soaked swab taken 

 from Beth&apos;s throat.   The material was positive for viable 

 spermatozoa, and more important--the semen had come from a man who 

 was a &quot;secretor.&quot;   The killer had either Type A or Type B blood. 

 More than half of all people are A and or B secretors, although B 

 secretors are far less common, less than 9 percent of the population. 

 This information might serve to build a preponderance of evidence 

 against a suspect. 

   

 The smallest piece of possible physical evidence they had picked up 

 was listed on the evidence manifest sheet.   At the time, it did not 

 seem that it would be particularly vital to the probe.   Grimsbo, 

 Zeller, and Kominek had found one coarse, almost black pubic hair on 

 the rug of the lunchroom.   It would not match either of the victims&apos; 

 pubic hairs in class and characteristics under a scanning electron 

 microscope...It might have come from the killer, and it was of 

 Caucasian origin.   But, like the blood-type classification, hair is 

 only probable physical evidence--not absolute.   Although it was not 

 likely that the unknown pubic hair had come from one of the officers 

 or medics at the crime scene, since they had all been fully clothed, 

 they had to be positively eliminated as sources.   Dave Kominek 

 contacted all of the paramedics and all of the police personnel and 

 asked them to submit a sample of their pubic hair. 

   

 Kominek would later recall with a grin, &quot;I went out to the fire 

 station and handed everyone a comb and a small plastic bag.   They 

 looked at me at first as if I was nuts, and asked if I&apos;d given up 

 police work and become a Fuller Brush man giving away free samples.&quot; 

   

   

 None of the hairs gathered matched the dark pubic hair retrieved from 

 the crime scene. 

   

 The vicious attacks on Beth and Shari appeared to be a tragedy born 

 of opportunity.   This killer had to be a random, senseless murderer, 

 one of the new breed of killers who began to rove America in 

 increasing numbers during the seventies.   The profile of murder had 

 changed, so subtly at first that lawmen didn&apos;t pick up on it, but the 

 dramatic increase in random murder can no longer be ignored. 

   

 Always before, there were rules of thumb detectives could trust when 

 it came to homicide suspects: look with suspicion first upon 

 relatives and friends of the victim.   Familiarity sometimes breeds 

 murder.   Look next for someone with a motive that makes sense: 

 jealousy, greed, revenge. 

   

 But by 1981 the rules had changed.   In 1966, only 5.9 percent of all 

 homicides would have been considered &quot;random and senseless&quot; by the 

 researchers for the FBI&apos;s Uniform Crime Report--44 victims killed in 

 the entire United States for no apparent reason.   That meant that 

 more than ten thousand murder victims had been killed by someone who 

 had a motive that, while hardly condoned, could be explained. 

 Explainable motive makes for a high incidence of successful case 

 closures, and nationwide the statistics looked good on the charts. 

 Eighty-eight percent of all murders in America were solved in 1966; 

 1,310 murders went unavenged. 

   

 Shari Hull would become a statistic in the Uniform Crime Report for 

 1981, and those figures, when compared to 1966, would be horrendous. 

 By the end of 1981, 17.8 percent of all murders were deemed random 

 and senseless, perpetrated for reasons no rational mind could 

 understand: 22,519 murder victims in 1981--more than double the 

 number fifteen years earlier in &apos;1966; 4,007 of those victims killed 

 in 1981 had died for no discernible reason. 

   

 Not surprisingly, the successful closure rate on homicides dropped 

 dramatically in 1981, when only 72 percent of killers were brought to 

 justice, and that meant that 6,304 murder cases would end up in the 

 loser files. 

   

 In late January 1981, the murder investigation in Shari Hull&apos;s case 

 seemed almost hopeless.   The responsibility for solving her murder 

 would fall most heavily on the shoulders of Detective Dave Kominek 

 and Corporal Monty Holloway.   They knew their chances of finding the 

 dark-eyed man in the hooded jacket were almost nil.   Beth and Shari 

 would have made attractive targets as they worked alone in the 

 building whose lighted windows made it a fishbowl.   The killer had 

 seized the opportunity and then vanished into the night--perhaps 

 forever. 

   

 The task of eliciting an in-depth statement from Beth Wilmot fell to 

 Dave Kominek.   When he talks with other detectives, Kominek can be 

 brusque and businesslike, so caught up is he in trying to work 

 through a case to a successful conclusion.   But with victims Kominek 

 is a different man.   His sympathy for their losses is apparent; his 

 kindness allows them to tell him things that might seem unspeakable. 

   

 Beth Wilmot would come to think of Dave Kominek as a big-brother 

 figure, someone she could talk to through the months. 

   

 And the months that lay ahead would not be easy. 

   

 Beth lay recovering from surgery in Salem Memorial on January 19, her 

 room under guard.   Shari Hull&apos;s killer had left the TransAmerica 

 Building confidently, sure that he had silenced all witnesses.   Beth 

 Wilmot&apos;s survival had made headlines in Portland and Salem papers, 

 and when the killer heard the news that one of his victims still 

 lived, there was a chance that he might come back and attempt to 

 silence her. 

  

 Dave Kominek met Beth for the first time on the day after the 

 shootings.   He had seen accident and assault victims before, of 

 course, but it was still appalling to see Beth&apos;s puffy, bruised face. 

 Her blackened eyes made it impossible to tell what she had looked 

 like before the attack. 

   

 Despite her injuries, Beth Wilmot was anxious to give a statement. 

 Whatever she might have forgotten immediately after the incident, she 

 remembered everything now. 

   

 Beth explained that she had known Shari Hull for a long time, that 

 they had been best friends.   Shari&apos;s family had welcomed Beth into 

 their home when she moved to Salem from Spokane, Washington, to find 

 a job; and both young women had been doing some work for Shari&apos;s 

 father&apos;s janitorial service.   The TransAmerica job was their Sunday 

 assignment.   It usually hadn&apos;t taken them very long, as the building 

 was basically kept very clean and it was new. 

   

 Explaining how she and Shari had come to be in the building was the 

 easy part.   Beth&apos;s voice dropped, and she looked away from Kominek, 

 staring at the window, where raindrops spattered and then melted into 

 each other. 

   

 &quot;Tell me what you can remember, Beth,&quot; Kominek began.   &quot;Just take 

 your time.   Tell me about going to work that night.&quot; 

   

 Beth sighed and nodded.   &quot;We went out there about nine-ten or 

 nine-fifteen, and we were all done cleaning in about twenty 

 minutes...but then I noticed that a window was dirty, and I went to 

 the back room to get a spray bottle. 

   

 &quot;The man must of saw us cleaning alone, &apos;cause Shari went to empty 

 the garbage alone.   She did that without telling me.   We usually 

 empty it together.   I got done vacuuming and she just got done 

 cleaning and emptying the garbage.   I went to the back room to get 

 the spray bottle.   She was near the door or something, and when I got 

 to her, he was there pointing the gun at both of us.   I guess he just 

 walked in.&quot; 

   

 Beth paused, and tears came into her eyes.   &quot;He killed my best 

 friend.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Try to tell me about it, Beth.   Tell me the words he said, and tell 

 me what you and Shari said,&quot; Kominek prompted softly. 

   

 Beth explained that the only place in the whole building blocked off 

 from view of anyone in the parking lot or on River Road was the 

 lunchroom--that that was the room where the intruder herded them. 

   

 &quot;He said, &apos;In the back room--both of you.   Both of you take off your 

 clothes.   Strip.   All of them.   Get down, and stay down.&apos; He told 

 Shari to take it all off, and I said, &apos;My dad will be here pretty 

 soon.&apos;&quot; 

   

 It had been a pathetic lie; Beth said that she knew there was no 

 chance that anyone would come to save them.   She had hoped that she 

 could frighten the big man off, but he wasn&apos;t buying her story. 

   

 &quot;Shari was hesitating.   She didn&apos;t want to take her bra off. 

   

 &quot;He said, &apos;Come on, now, take it all off.&apos; He made us kneel on the 

 floor and he was standing up.&quot; 

   

 Beth closed her eyes and asked if she had to tel everything that the 

 man had done to them.   Kominek told her that it wouldn&apos;t be her own 

 words speaking-that she would only be repeating what the killer had 

 said. 

   

 She explained that the man had unzipped his jeans and exposed 

 himself, and then he had demanded that the girls fellate him. 

   

 &quot;What did he say to you?   Remember, what you tell me will be his 

 words--not yours.&quot; 

   

 Beth closed her eyes and took a deep breath. 

   

 &quot;Okay.   He was talking to Shari, and he said...he said, &apos;Suck on me. 

 Come on, make me come.&apos; And then he said to me, &apos;You suck on my 

 balls.&apos; He told both of us, &apos;You make me come.   Both of you suck on 

 me.&apos; 

   

 &quot;He told Shari, &apos;Play with yourself,&apos; and she said no, and then he 

 told me to suck on Shari&apos;s breast.   I did, but I faked it.   He told 

 me to stand up and spread my legs apart so he could have intercourse 

 with me.   His penis wouldn&apos;t go in, and he said, &apos;Shit, you&apos;ve got a 

 tight cunt.&apos;&quot; Beth Wilmot talked very softly, spilling out the 

 details of the savage attack she and her friend had endured for some 

 twenty minutes.   Twenty minutes that had seemed like hours.   Beth had 

 thought only of placating him, feeling that that was the one way they 

 might survive.   But, Beth said, Shari had reacted with something 

 close to hysteria, crying uncontrollably as the dark complexioned man 

 gave his orders.   Shari&apos;s bubbling panic had seemed to set the man 

 off, making him edgy and angry.   He had changed for the worse when 

 Shari had given in to hysteria. 

   

 &quot;Eat me,&quot; he&apos;d commanded, standing triumphantly over the 

   

 kneeling, naked girls.   &quot;Which one of you wants to eat me?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He made Shari go first, and then me, and then both of us at the same 

 time.&quot;   Beth turned her face away.   &quot;He came...finally.   We thought 

 he was done with us.   He told us to lie down on the ground--facedown 

 on the floor.   He was asking us for rope.   He said, &apos;I need some 

 rope.   Do you guys have any rope?   Do you know where any is?&apos; &quot;We 

 both said no.   And then Shari said, &apos;Don&apos;t hurt us.   Please don&apos;t 

 hurt us.   We won&apos;t tell anyone.   Just let us go.&apos; Shari was begging, 

 and I was saying, &apos;Please, please, don&apos;t hurt us; we won&apos;t tell 

 anyone.&apos;&quot; 

   

 Beth had wanted to tell Shari that she should be quiet, that her 

 crying and screaming were making the man crazier--but she was afraid 

 to speak out loud. 

   

 &quot;He was quiet for about five seconds, standing over us.   We heard him 

 breathing, and it was like he was trying to decide.&quot; 

   

 Dave Kominek noted that Beth had begun to tremble, almost 

 imperceptibly at first, and then more violently.   She caught her 

 hands together, trying to maintain some kind of composure.   &quot;And then 

 what happened?&quot;   he asked quietly. 

   

 &quot;Then a shot goes off.   I think that he shot Shari first, and 

 then...and then he shot Shari.....and then me.   a final shot to 

 Shari.   After the first shot, I just lay as still as I could and 

 pretended to be dead.   Shari kept moaning, maybe that&apos;s why he shot 

 her the last time.   I was praying that she was pretending to be dead 

 too.   After he shot the second time, I couldn&apos;t hear anything but 

 ringing in my ears.   I was afraid to get up because I couldn&apos;t hear 

 if he was still there or not.   After about five minutes I got up and 

 I could walk, and I went to the restroom and I looked in the mirror. 

 There was something wrong with the whole right side of my face.   It 

 was all swollen out and there was blood.   I was so frightened; I 

 thought he might be outside watching me, so I got down on my hands 

 and knees and I crawled to one of the phones in the office.   And I 

 pushed a button and called the operator.&quot; 

   

 Kominek waited, saying nothing.   The story was pouring out from Beth 

 unbidden now. 

   

 &quot;Shari was dying then, and I&apos;m scared half to death, afraid I&apos;m going 

 to die too, and that he&apos;s going to come back and shoot me again. 

 Then I could see the ambulance lights and the police driving up, and 

 I run to Shari, and I say, &apos;Shari, talk to me!&apos; Only Shari couldn&apos;t 

 say anything.   It was too late.&quot; 

   

 Tears were coursing down Beth Wilmot&apos;s cheeks She turned to Kominek 

 and said, &quot;Do you know what my last words were to Shari?   The very 

 last words?   I said, &apos;Ah, shit, Shari, we forgot to clean the door,&apos; 

 and her last words to me were, &apos;Ah, shit, let&apos;s do &apos;em.&quot; 

   

 The same thought occurred to the detective and to the sobbing girl at 

 that moment, and it hung in the air of the hospital room.   If Beth 

 and Shari had left a few smudges on the front door of the 

 TransAmerica Building, if they had not been so anxious to do a good 

 job of cleaning, they would have been safely in Shari&apos;s Bronco and 

 driving away from the parking lot before the killer could get to them.

 He was to have been the perfect child, the son his parents had longed 

 for.   He was most assuredly not one of the &quot;throwaway&quot; children who 

 are initially unwanted and then buffeted from foster home to foster 

 home.   No criminologist could ever call Randall deprived.   He was 

 born into a loving home to educated upper middle-class parents.   That 

 he might one day become a criminal, a violent, sadistic killer, 

 seemed patently impossible.   And yet, he was to find success far 

 beyond any boy&apos;s dreams, and finally, instead of fame, he would 

 wallow in infamy. 

   

 His father, Walter &quot;Jack&quot; Woodfield, and his mother, Donna Jean were 

 products of an era when one fell in love, got married, and settled 

 down to raise a small family of perfect children.   That was the dream 

 of the forties and fifties.   Daughters would grow up and go to 

 college, and marry professional men.   Sons would become star 

 athletes, excel in their studies, and make their parents proud. 

   

 For many of those young couples who married just after the end of the 

 Second World War, the dreams came true.   For others, like the 

 Woodfields, something would go terribly wrong, and they would never 

 understand why.   If, indeed, the Woodfields&apos; approach to child 

 rearing was somehow flawed, it was with no thought to harm; from the 

 very beginning, they wanted only the best for their children.   By 

 some curious but unwritten rule, families of that time three decades 

 ago invariably wanted to have a boy baby first.   Thus the father 

 would have a small image of himself to mold and to present with all 

 the advantages that he himself missed when he grew up during the 

 Great Depression.   Although Donna Jean had had two years of college, 

 the war had intervened, and Jack Woodfield had only a high-school 

 diploma.   He had joined Pacific Northwest Bell when he was 

 twenty-one, and he was very successful.   He would stay with the phone 

 company for more than thirty years. 

   

 Donna Jean Woodfield gave birth first to two daughters in a row: 

 Susan and Nancy, pretty, smart, good little girls.   Both parents 

 adored their daughters, but they still longed for a boy, and Donna 

 Jean was certain that her third pregnancy in 1950 would bring the son 

 that would make their family complete. 

   

 Friends remember that she selected and then rejected many names for 

 the baby boy she confidently expected, explaining that a name was so 

 important for a boy.   The wrong name could make all the difference. 

 Good solid boys&apos; names like John and Charles and Joseph had gone out 

 of vogue by 1950; a profusion of Brians and Kevins and Marks appeared 

 in the &quot;Births&quot; columns in newspapers.   The new idea was to give a 

 boy baby a special name, something that he could wear proudly 

 throughout his life.   It was no longer popular to name boys after 

 progenitors.   Grandfathers might merit a middle name in tribute, but 

 rarely a first name.   Donna Jean finally settled on what she thought 

 was a wonderful name: Randall Brent Woodfield.   She would call him 

 Randy. 

   

 When Donna Jean Woodfield went into labor late on Christmas Day 1950, 

 it seemed that she was, indeed, about to give birth to a special 

 child.   She did give birth to a boy, but not until after midnight; 

 Randall Brent Woodfield was born on December 26 in Salem, Oregon. 

 His mother was twenty-four years old; his father was twenty-seven. 

   

 Randy was a beautiful baby, born with a thick head of almost black 

 hair.   Within months his slate-blue eyes turned dark too, and his 

 hair became a dense mass of curls.   A woman who baby-sat for the 

 Woodfields recalls that Randy was a very placid baby to care for. 

 &quot;He was very quiet.   I remember that I worried sometimes because he 

 was almost too good...too quiet.&quot; 

   

 Randy turned over and crawled earlier than other babies, and he 

 walked earlier too.   Jack Woodfield was sure that he had a blossoming 

 athlete on his hands, and he was delighted. 

   

 Donna Jean breast-fed her son--that too just coming back into vogue 

 after years of rigidly scheduled bottle-feeding.   Randy&apos;s older 

 sisters doted on him, treating him like a big doll. 

   

 The Woodfields remained in Salem for about a year after Randy&apos;s 

 birth, and then moved to Corvallis for two or three years.   Jack 

 Woodfield was then transferred to Otter Rock, Oregon, where the 

 family would remain for many years. 

   

 The Woodfields felt that it had all turned out perfectly.   The girls 

 were a pleasure to raise, and Randy would be the &quot;all-American boy.&quot; 

 His father would tutor him in sports, and his mother would see to it 

 that he would have social grace, manners, and popularity.   He was 

 such a handsome, smart little boy that it could not be any other way. 

   

 There were minor problems; it wasn&apos;t long before Randy began to chafe 

 against a household heavily weighted with females, with a father who 

 worked long hours as he rose rapidly through the hierarchy of 

 management in the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company.   Randy 

 began to resent his sisters mightily; he complained that they were 

 always allowed to do things that he couldn&apos;t.   The explanation that 

 they &quot;were older&quot; only enraged him. 

   

 Randy concluded that girls got to do what was fun and that girls were 

 free.   His sisters could go places by themselves and he had to stay 

 home.   Worst of all, he had to have a baby-sitter and they didn&apos;t. 

 As a schoolboy he rebelled against baby-sitters, demanding to be left 

 alone.   The few times he was left alone with his sisters, however, 

 his jealousy at them exploded, and there were fights.   He felt that 

 he was the one who always got blamed, even if it wasn&apos;t his fault. 

 He fumed because Susan and Nancy teased him and tattled on him and he 

 was punished.   His mother was usually the one to mete out discipline, 

 not physically painful, but humiliating to Randy because he felt that 

 he had disappointed her.   He was torn early on between his desire to 

 please his mother, to be a &quot;good boy,&quot; and his anger at her because 

 it seemed impossible to meet what he considered to be her expansive 

 and unrealistic goals for him.   Still, as an adult, he would recall 

 that his relationship with his mother was &quot;real good.   I&apos;m closer to 

 my mother than I am to my father.&quot; 

   

 For the rest of his life, Randy Woodfield would misperceive women, 

 overvaluing them and denigrating himself.   In the end, his 

 self-esteem would become totally dependent on how women viewed him. 

   

 And yet, for all of his grade-school years, Randy Woodfield would 

 seem to be exactly the child his parents wanted.   He was good in 

 school, made excellent grades, and he was exceptional in sports.   He 

 and his father participated in what Randy describes as &quot;a lot of 

 father-son activities.&quot;   He was a boy that any family would be proud 

 of--handsomer than ever as the years passed, and popular with his 

 fellow students.   If he was occasionally given to temper tantrums at 

 home over conflicts with his sisters, well...all little brothers 

 acted that way. 

   

 Father Knows Best was what people watched on their television sets. 

 in the fifties, the kind of family every family wanted to be.   The 

 mother never got angry, and the father never made a mistake, and, 

 sure, Bud sometimes became furious with Betty, his big sister, but 

 that&apos;s the way things were supposed to be.   In the final scenes, 

 everybody made up and laughed about the problems. 

   

 Nobody talked about sex in situation comedies in the fifties.   Nobody 

 talked about sex period.   And no one, certainly, talked about sex in 

 the Woodfield home.   That was something that could wait until high 

 school.   This didn&apos;t make them different from any other family of 

 that period.   Not at all; they were mirroring the image of the times. 

   

 Randy soon came to hate his nickname.   It was a &quot;baby&quot; name, 

 something his mother called him.   His name was Randall, but as much 

 as he fumed, &quot;Randy&quot; stuck to him like glue. 

   

 As their family grew, the Woodfields lived in Otter Rock, a town with 

 only a few thousand citizens, located on the Oregon coast.   Situated 

 just north of the spot where Yaquina Bay empties into the Pacific 

 Ocean, Otter Rock could vie with any town in America for sheer 

 physical beauty.   There seemed to be a &quot;safeness&quot; for children there; 

 the closest &quot;big&quot; town was Corvallis, fifty-four miles to the east, 

 and even Corvallis had only thirty-five thousand residents.   Salem 

 and Portland were a goodly stretch up the I-5 freeway, and fears that 

 Otter Rock teenagers might be exposed to drugs was minimal when 

 compared to problems parents faced in Portland.   Otter Rock was a 

 town full of good neighbors, and the Woodfields were considered 

 &quot;pillars of the community,&quot; an exceptionally nice family.   Jack 

 continued moving up in the telephone company, and after Randy was 

 ten, Donna Jean took a job at a drugstore in Newport as a clerk.   A 

 pretty woman who always dressed with style and flair, she looked 

 several years younger than her actual age.   People responded to Donna 

 Jean, but then, people liked the whole Woodfield family. 

   

 Randy Woodfield reached puberty early, and his confusion about sexual 

 matters grew, as did his misperception of the female.   He was still 

 trying to please his mother, but it was much more difficult now to be 

 the perfect son.   He continued to validate his own worth by how well 

 he met Donna Jean&apos;s expectations.   She was not aware of it; no one 

 was aware of it.   Randy resented his sisters because they were in 

 high school and he was only in junior high.   They could still go 

 places forbidden to him, and they could take driver training and 

 obtain driver&apos;s licenses. 

   

 His frustration level reached the danger point.   He was a male, 

 and males should be paid attention to.   But females were running his 

 life.   He felt powerful sexual feelings, and then consuming guilt 

 because he felt that way. 

   

 At the same time, the teenage Randy Woodfield was becoming known as 

 the outstanding young athlete in Newport, where he attended school. 

 His coordination marked him a prodigy on the playing field.   It 

 didn&apos;t seem to matter which sports he tried.   He was a star in all of 

 them: track, baseball, basketball, football.   The towns of Otter Rock 

 and Newport were proud of him.   His father began a scrapbook of 

 pictures and clippings extolling Randy&apos;s success.   Eventually he 

 would have three scrapbooks thick with Randy&apos;s honors.   It isn&apos;t 

 often that a town as small as Newport, Oregon, can claim an athlete 

 with as much promise as Randy Woodfield showed. 

   

 It wasn&apos;t enough.   The roar of the crowds, his father&apos;s pride, and 

 the fact that he seemed slated for greatness could not counterbalance 

 the doubts Randy had about his competence, and, indeed, about his 

 masculinity. 

   

 His first overt demonstration of sexual deviance can be traced back 

 to his days in junior high school.   When the pressure and conflicts 

 became too great for him to deal with in accepted channels, he began 

 to expose himself.   He knew that this was not something a &quot;good boy&quot; 

 would do, but the obsession was all-consuming.   Through exhibitionism 

 he could not only demonstrate that he was a male but also 

 subconsciously get back at his mother, who seemed to demand 

 perfection that he could not deliver.   Even more gratifying than this 

 subtle revenge was the sight of a woman&apos;s or girl&apos;s frightened 

 reaction to the shock of seeing his genitals. 

   

 The instances of exposure were seldom isolated.   Randy would expose 

 his erect organ to a woman on one side of Newport, revel in her 

 reaction, and then sprint to other areas and find still more victims. 

 He reasoned that he was not actually hurting anyone, and that made 

 it, if not all right, at least acceptable.   His own fear of discovery 

 concurrently excited him and filled him with dread. 

   

 Eventually, of course, he was caught.   And he was recognized. 

 Newport wasn&apos;t big enough to allow anonymity, and Randy was well 

 known in Newport. 

   

 Tragically, he drew no real punishment and was not referred for 

 treatment.   The teenage exposer is somewhat of a phenomenon, 

 and when an exposer is still only in junior high school, bright red 

 warning flags should have been raised.   But police officials looked 

 the other way.   This was the kid that was going to make the rest of 

 Oregon and perhaps the rest of the country look to Newport when he 

 reached his peak as an athlete.   To charge him, to perhaps send him 

 away to reform school, would mean the end of the glory of Randy 

 Woodfield. 

   

 The exposing incidents were whitewashed.   Randy stayed in school, and 

 he stayed at home.   Years later, when he was a man and in profound 

 trouble with the law, Randy Woodfield&apos;s parents would deny that they 

 were aware of any sexual problems he might have had.   It is possible 

 that the officers who encountered Randy in his first acting out of 

 sexual deviance did not tell his parents; it is possible that the 

 suggestion that their son might be sexually abnormal in some way was 

 repressed so thoroughly that the Woodfields do not, indeed, remember. 

   

 As far as Jack Woodfield can now recall, Randy did not become 

 sexually active until he was in high school.   He remembers that Randy 

 mentioned to him once that the girls in high school were &quot;loose.&quot; 

 This could have been construed as &quot;man talk,&quot; and Jack Woodfield did 

 not pursue it. 

   

 Randall Woodfield&apos;s father states adamantly that his son had no 

 problems while growing up.   He was not involved with alcohol or with 

 drugs; Randy had participated in none of the forbidden activities 

 that many teenagers dabbled in in the sixties.   His father recalls 

 that Randy was extremely close to his mother, both as a child and as 

 a young man. 

   

 One of Randy&apos;s closest friends was Mike Schaeffer, now a teacher at a 

 Newport school.   Schaeffer even now cannot comprehend that Randy 

 would ever hurt anyone, much less kill someone.   When Schaeffer and 

 Woodfield were close, Schaeffer recalls that Randy was not a 

 &quot;kiss-and-tell&quot; dater, so Schaeffer never knew 

 what sexual contacts Randy might have had.   He would date one girl 

 almost exclusively for a few months at a time--but never longer. 

   

 &quot;He had a good relationship with his parents, but whenever he did 

 anything wrong, his mother always knew,&quot; Schaeffer remembers.   &quot;He 

 threw a party once when his folks were out of town.   He was really 

 careful, and he put throw rugs and plastic over the carpets so there 

 wouldn&apos;t be any damage done, and then he rounded up a crew of girls 

 to stay around after the party to clean up.   That place was just 

 immaculate afterward, but when 

 his mother got home, she knew.   She just seemed to know everything he 

 was doing.&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield was a very important member of the class of 1969 at 

 Newport High School.   He is well remembered. 

   

 &quot;He was a beautiful kid, the star football player,&quot; one of his 

 classmates recalls.   &quot;He was a relatively popular kid.&quot; 

   

 Some members of his graduating class recall Randy as a quiet, almost 

 shy young man.   Others say that Randy was given to pranks like 

 teasing animals. 

   

 The girls Randy had dated for a while--all of them long married 

 now--were the most popular, the most desirable girls.   Interviewed by 

 detectives in 1981, some of them were in tears over Randy&apos;s arrest. 

 At least one of them could not bear to watch the television news 

 and see Randy in handcuffs.   Her husband, one of Randy&apos;s friends who 

 stayed supportive for years, comments that she ran from the room 

 whenever Randy&apos;s image flashed onto the screen. 

   

 Randy always seemed to prefer younger girls.   Perhaps he found them 

 less threatening, less controlling.   As he grew older, he would 

 continue to be attracted to girls a half-dozen or more years younger 

 than he.   He liked to have his girlfriends wear jeans, and he was 

 disturbed when they wore sexy or what he called &quot;flashy&quot; clothes.   He 

 liked slender girls, but he was invariably attracted to big-breasted 

 girls. 

   

 He was a good student at Newport High School, excelling particularly 

 in mathematics, and he was moved into advanced math classes. 

 Teachers would later praise his intellectual ability and the way he 

 seemed to get along with everyone.   The Newport Rotary Club once 

 selected Randy as Boy of the Month.   He 

 belonged to the German club; he was much more than &quot;just a 

 dumb jock.&quot; 

   

 But it was in sports, of course, that Randy Woodfield made the most 

 lasting impression.   He made the all-state first team in football 

 when he was still only a junior, and again when he was a senior.   He 

 received an honorable mention in all-state basketball when he was a 

 senior, he played varsity baseball, and he was a sprinter and 

 field-event specialist on the track team.   His ambition--his 

 obsession--was to play professional football, and few who knew him 

 doubted that he would achieve that goal.   He was a wide receiver 

 without peer, and you could confidently put him up against any end 

 from high schools in Portland or Seattle--or Houston, for that 

 matter.   According to Randy, in his senior year 

 he was recruited for sports scholarships by &quot;all the major colleges 

 in the Northwest,&quot; and there is no evidence to dispute that. 

   

 Randy was very handsome, despite a stubborn case of teenage acne, and 

 he was big--almost six feet, two inches tall, a hundred and seventy 

 pounds. 

   

 The world should have been his oyster. 

   

 The summer after graduating from high school, Randy Woodfield worked 

 for Pacific Northwest Bell in Newport, driving trucks and cleaning 

 and repairing telephone booths.   In the fall of 1969 he enrolled in 

 Treasure Valley Community College in Ontario, Oregon.   Ontario is a 

 town only slightly larger than Otter Rock, all the way across Oregon 

 and hard by the Idaho border.   His good friend from high school, Mike 

 Schaeffer, was his roommate at Treasure Valley. 

   

 For the year he was at Treasure Valley, Randy made a GPA of 

 2.5--roughly a C + average.   He was co-captain of the varsity 

 football team and was on the varsity basketball and weight-lifting 

 squads.   In track, he held the freshman record for the long jump:   

 twenty-two feet, six and a half inches. 

   

 Schaeffer considered that Randy was talented, gifted, and he had 

 never seen him be spiteful or cruel to anyone.   But he had glimpsed a 

 dark side to his best friend on occasion. 

   

 &quot;Randy stole some cassette tapes from some guy in the dorm.   I knew 

 he had those tapes, but when the guy asked about them, Randy lied and 

 said he didn&apos;t have them.   I told him it was his story to tell, and I 

 wouldn&apos;t say anything, but that when it came down to his getting into 

 trouble over taking them, he&apos;d have to tell the truth.   Later he 

 confessed to the dorm proctor that he&apos;d had them all along, and he 

 gave them back.&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield dated one girl at Treasure Valley Community College; 

 Sharon McNeill.   He seemed to be more attached to her than any girl 

 he&apos;d known before.   &quot;Sharon did her share of catting around,&quot; 

 Schaeffer recalls, &quot;and they were having troubles.   Anyway, they 

 broke up.&quot; 

   

 Apparently Randy couldn&apos;t handle Sharon&apos;s rejection, and there were 

 allegations that he had broken into the McNeill home on August 3, 

 1970, and completely &quot;trashed&quot; Sharon&apos;s room in reprisal.   Entry had 

 been made through a bathroom window.   The only thing stolen was, 

 oddly, a stuffed animal--a small bull, a present given to Sharon by 

 Randy. 

   

 He was arrested by Ontario, Oregon, police and charged with 

 vandalizing his ex-girl&apos;s room.   He was later found not guilty in a 

 jury trial; there was no physical evidence linking Randy to the 

 vandalism and theft. 

   

 But there had allegedly been incidents of exposing in Ontario too, 

 and it seemed prudent for Randy to move on.   He arranged to transfer 

 to Mount Hood Community College for one term.   He went alone; Mike 

 Schaeffer enrolled in Southern Oregon College. 

   

 Sharon McNeill&apos;s parents were adamant that she have nothing further 

 to do with Randy Woodfield, and she agreed with them.   Even though he 

 left Treasure Valley, he continued to bombard the young woman with 

 letters and phone calls.   Sharon would eventually be forced to obtain 

 an unlisted phone number.   Almost ten years after she had last seen 

 him in Ontario, Sharon received a letter from Randy containing a nude 

 photograph of himself.   The final message was a Christmas card in 

 December 1980.   She had never given him any encouragement during the 

 decade that intervened between the vandalism incident and his final 

 Christmas card.   She often wondered why he would not just let her go 

 and forget her, but his peculiar attentions didn&apos;t really frighten 

 her. 

   

 &quot;After we left Treasure Valley,&quot; Mike Schaeffer remembers; &quot;Randy 

 never visited me at SOC.   A long time later, I got letters from him 

 where he sounded quite religious and was quoting the Bible.   It just 

 wasn&apos;t him...not the Randy I knew.&quot; 

   

 For the next two summers Randy Woodfield returned to the 

 Oregon coast to work his time for the Georgia-Pacific plywood and 

 stud mill in Toledo. 

   

 Randy had another &quot;girlfriend&quot; during that time--a Newport 

 eighth-grader named Traci Connors. 

   

 &quot;He was home for the summer from Treasure Valley,&quot; she remembers.   &quot;I 

 met him at the Newport High School football field, where he and his 

 friends were playing football.   I used to go and watch them, and I 

 got to know Randy pretty well.   It was just--friendly; he was sort of 

 the big brother that I never had.   He was always nice to me, and we 

 didn&apos;t really have dates--but I spent a lot of time with him.   He&apos;d 

 drive me home from the football field in the black Volkswagen Bug he 

 had then.   it had a sun roof, and Randy always had rakes sticking out 

 of it.   He took the rakes along to smooth out the long-jump pits.&quot; 

   

 For Traci it had been a case of platonic hero worship.   She was only 

 in the eighth grade, and he was a college man, a football star, who 

 was being nice to her and spending time with her. 

   

 On one occasion, however, Randy had surprised her and frightened her 

 a little.   Traci was no more than fourteen or fifteen, and Randy was 

 about twenty.   His parents were out of town, and he invited her to 

 spend the night in his house with him.   She drank two beers with him, 

 and was thrilled when he kissed her a few times. 

   

 The encounter escalated to petting that resulted in climax for Randy, 

 but she had refused actual intercourse, saying, &quot;No, I don&apos;t do 

 things like that. 

   

 &quot;He just said, &apos;Okay,&apos; and went to sleep in his own bed.   I slept all 

 night in another bed, and that was all there was to it.&quot; 

   

 Traci would have done almost anything for Randy Woodfield short of 

 sex.   She even intervened and attempted to help him 

 reconcile with the lost Sharon from Treasure Valley.   &quot;One time Randy 

 had me call up this girl over by Treasure Valley.   He couldn&apos;t do it 

 because her parents wouldn&apos;t let her date him anymore.   He said 

 they&apos;d accused him of breaking and 

 entering their house.   He said he&apos;d just taken back all the things 

 he&apos;d given her.   Except for that girl, he never seemed to have a 

 steady girlfriend. 

   

 &quot;At the end of the first summer I met him, he went back to college, 

 and I didn&apos;t see him for a long time.   He sent me a couple of letters 

 from school, but I didn&apos;t hear from him again until after I&apos;d 

 graduated and I was married.&quot; 

   

 As a grown woman Traci Connors still remembered Randy Woodfield as &quot;a 

 happy, funny, good person.   He stayed in shape, and he was real clean 

 and fun to be with.   He had a great memory, and he was sincere, not a 

 phony.   If you needed help, Randy would help you.   He was always 

 macho, and his father always wanted Randy to be something big.   It 

 seemed like he tried really hard to be what his parents wanted, but 

 he always thought that his sisters were neat and could do no wrong in 

 his folks&apos; eyes.&quot; 

   

 Traci did acknowledge that Randy was a little sneaky at times, and 

 particularly good at planning things out. 

   

 &quot;One time he was going to make money by getting ten cases of Coors 

 beer in Idaho and bringing to sell to the kids at Newport High for a 

 profit.   he bought the beer and hid it behind some church in town. 

 He sold me a case, but before he could sell the rest of it, somebody 

 found it and stole it.   He asked me about that--as if I might know 

 who&apos;d done it, but I didn&apos;t know.   He wasn&apos;t really mad, but he lost 

 money on that deal.&quot; 

   

 According to Traci, Randy Woodfield had been very concerned about 

 what other people thought of him--particularly his high-school 

 friends.   &quot;After he went to prison that first time, he asked me if 

 Mike Schaeffer was really ashamed of him because 

 he&apos;d been in prison.&quot; 

   

 Traci Connors was to continue for years an off-and-on friendship with 

 the man she&apos;d idolized when she was a young teenager. 

   

 And like so many of the friends who had known Randy in his glory 

 years, she could never really visualize his doing the terrible 

 things he was accused of. 

   

   

                                   5 

   

 By the spring of 1971 Randy Woodfield had passed his twentieth 

 birthday and was far behind the carefully programmed schedule he had 

 set for himself to play big-league ball.   He should have been playing 

 first-string varsity by now on a Pac-Eight team: the University of 

 Washington Huskies or the University of Oregon Ducks.   The life cycle 

 of an athlete is short.   Beyond Y.   A.   Tittle and a few other &quot;old 

 men&quot; who have lasted in the pros after forty, there aren&apos;t many 

 football players who are not over the hill by the time they reach 

 thirty-five. 

   

 Treasure Valley had not proved to be a college where big-league 

 scouts trolled.   Randy thought he never should have gone there in the 

 first place.   He had repetitive nightmares of waking up at thirty 

 without ever having made it.   He&apos;d been a big fish in a little pond, 

 and the world of athletics was full of minnows who got swallowed up 

 when they ventured Out of their safe waters. 

   

 Sports was the one area in which Randy felt whole and competent, and 

 he had kept his underlying compulsions quelled, if not completely 

 under control, by working out and keeping his body in prime 

 condition.   He was not perfect socially, he was not perfect 

 scholastically, but he was still pretty damn good on a football field 

 and in the 100- and 220-yard dashes.   And when he was home in Otter 

 Rock and Newport during vacations and summers, he was still a hero to 

 the kids of the area who hung around the field and watched him catch 

 passes. 

   

 That wasn&apos;t enough; that was nowhere near enough.   He had made 

 mistakes at Treasure Valley, and his image was tarnished.   The theft 

 in the dorm that he&apos;d had to confess.   The look in the proctor&apos;s eyes 

 when he did, and the ignominy of having to return a lousy bunch of 

 tapes, burned in his memory.   The trial over the breaking and 

 entering at the McNeills&apos; house had been worse. 

   

 And Sharon.   Sharon had dumped him.   He&apos;d never been sure he Was 

 masculine enough, a good enough lover, or as well endowed as other 

 men.   She&apos;d taken everything he had to give 

 her, and then she&apos;d gone out with other guys behind his back.   She&apos;d 

 as much as told him he didn&apos;t measure up.   He thought he might feel 

 better after taking his presents back and leaving her room a mess. 

 But that had only gotten him in more trouble, and then she really 

 wanted nothing to do with him. 

   

 He&apos;d concluded finally that Sharon was treacherous, like most Of the 

 women he&apos;d known in his life.   She&apos;d run tattling to her folks and 

 she&apos;d made him look like a fool.   That was the whole thing about 

 females.   They acted soft and pretty, but they demanded more than any 

 man could be expected to give.   He&apos;d kept thinking that if he could 

 just talk to her, it would be all right, but he&apos;d tried and every 

 time she&apos;d told him to go away, he&apos;d felt worse. 

   

 He had tried to tell himself that he and Sharon were through.   The 

 hell with her.   There were other women.   But the memory of Sharon&apos;s 

 betrayal would sneak up and confront him when he least expected it. 

 It was almost impossible for him to really let go of her. 

   

 Indeed, he would come to blame his &quot;bad luck&quot; at losing her for 

 his growing sexual obsessions. 

   

 In the spring of 1971 Randy registered for classes at 

 Portland-StateUniversity.   PortlandState seemed to him to be a far 

 better choice than Treasure Valley in his quest for eventual football 

 fame.   And PortlandState&apos;s coaches were certainly pleased to have 

 Randy. 

   

 Portland State wasn&apos;t in the Pac-Eight, of course.   They played other 

 small universities in Oregon and Washington, some of them very 

 good--considering the size: Willamette (where his fatherr had gone to 

 college), Linfield, Whitman, George Fox, University of Puget Sound. 

 The pros didn&apos;t draft many players from small colleges, but there 

 were always some scouts keeping an eye out--just in case.   Jim Zorn 

 had come out of Cal-Poly-Pomona, and Eddie LeBaron had come from the 

 College of the Pacific.   There were scouts who still called Randy 

 from time to time.   if he could make a good showing at Portland 

 State, he still had a chance to achieve his dream. 

   

 Afterr the spring term at Portland State, where he participated 

 enthusiastically in spring practice, Randy once again worked for 

 Georgia-Pacific, this time for the entire summer.   He did not earn 

 much during his employment there, and he applied for and was granted 

 food stamps from the Multnomah County Public Welfare Commission in 

 September 1971. 

   

 Randy attended Portland State on a full-time basis from 1971 to the 

 winter semester of 1973.   He majored there in health education and 

 physical education, and made average grades.   He was a valuable 

 member of the Portland State football team&apos;s line, a wide receiver 

 who could be counted on to perform.   He somehow managed to combine 

 spring training for football with track, in which he once again 

 competed and won in events that demanded speed.   He also took courses 

 in handball, wrestling, weight lifting, and gymnastics. 

   

 He worked part-time as a cook and waiter at the Burger Chef 

 restaurant near Portland State. 

   

 But there had been a distinct personality change in the young 

 football star by the time he arrived in Portland.   He had been quiet, 

 but something of a prankster, occasionally a thief, sporadically 

 gripped by rage at rejection.   He had, of course, been an 

 exhibitionist, but that was still a side of him that no one claims to 

 have known about--no one but the police in his hometown.   He had 

 never been a show-off, and he was not in 1971. 

   

 Randy turned, at Portland State, to religion.   His teammates of that 

 era describe Randy Woodfield as &quot;soft-spoken and 

 mild-mannered...very, very religious.&quot;   He was a member of the 

 Portland State University Campus Crusade for Christ and of the 

 Fellowship of Christian Athletes.   He was known to date only 

 &quot;Christian girls.&quot;   indeed, he embraced religion with the same fervor 

 he had hitherto shown only for athletics, as if combining the two 

 pursuits could cleanse him of whatever demons waited inside, 

 scratching and clawing to get out. 

   

 And there were demons. 

   

 No matter that Randy Woodfield&apos;s football career had picked up 

 appreciably when he moved to Portland State, no matter that he was 

 once again being wooed seriously by football scouts from the pros, 

 and no matter that he could date almost any coed he chose.   He was 

 still an exhibitionist; the sexual rush he got when he exposed 

 himself to horrified women was so much stronger than any other 

 gratification. 

   

 There is little doubt that there were many, many episodes of 

 exhibitionism for which he was not caught.   He had the whole of 

 Portland to rove in, and he had only to drive across the bridge over 

 the Columbia River in his old Volkswagen to be in Vancouver, 

 Washington.   The majority of women don&apos;t bother to report exposers; 

 the fallacy remains that exposers are not inherently dangerous, just 

 as voyeurs are thought to be basically harmless.   Certainly the 

 experience can be momentarily shocking, but if women are not actually 

 touched or abused, they tend to put the incident out of their minds. 

   

 Still, Randy Woodfield, the tall-dark-and-handsome football star, the 

 Christian athlete, was playing Russian roulette with his genitals. 

 There had to come a time when he was reported, when his speed at 

 running from the scene was not swift enough. 

   

 His first adult arrest occurred in Vancouver, Washington, on August 

 7, 1972.   He was charged with indecent exposure and he was convicted. 

 He received only a suspended sentence.   There is no record of 

 probation There is no indication that authorities at Portland State 

 were aware of either his arrest or conviction. 

   

 He maintained his &quot;Mr.   Clean&quot; image on campus, attending religious 

 meetings and doing well in class and better on the playing field.   He 

 traveled to Lake Tance, California, in 1972 and 1973 to participate 

 in conferences for the Campus Crusade for Christ, taking a janitor&apos;s 

 job at the Driftwood Lodge there to support himself. 

   

 An almost compulsive saver of records and minutiae, Randy Woodfield 

 carried souvenirs, notes, old checks, letters, cards, and 

 miscellaneous papers wherever he went.   He filled several notebooks 

 with memoranda on religion, and one contained his &quot;personal 

 testimony&quot; as a born-again Christian.   In it he deplored his constant 

 seeking after three goals in his life: &quot;to be successful in school 

 (grades); to reach the highest honors I could in my range of 

 athletics; and to be popular with all the girls.&quot; 

   

 He testified that he had turned away from religion because he thought 

 his life was more exciting without the rules and regulations that 

 constrained his friends.   He wrote that he had come to see that his 

 former achievements were &quot;actually only trophies or memories I could 

 hang on the wall.   I suddenly found myself going nowhere in school 

 and just wandering around.&quot; 

   

 The Campus Crusade for Christ and the summers in lake Tahoe estranged 

 him somewhat from his father.   Jack Woodfield was concerned that 

 Randy was plunging into religion with almost maniacal fervor.   There 

 were arguments between son and father that seemed to have no 

 resolution.   Had Jack Woodfield known of the struggles within his 

 son, he might have welcomed anything that could divert Randy from the 

 path he was treading. 

   

 Randy Woodfield was, then, in the early 1970&apos;s, an avowed Christian, 

 but it did not seem to help with his sexual obsessions.   It did not 

 stop his prowling to find women to whom he could reveal that he was a 

 male, and a male with genitals he now considered exceptionally large. 

   

 Some of his victims were more puzzled than frightened.   They saw a 

 handsome, well-built young man--a man they might have been eager to 

 date, given other circumstances--who stood in the shadows with 

 unzipped fly, whispering softly: &quot;Look at me.   Look at this.&quot;   This 

 wasn&apos;t the standard creepy little man or some senile old fool forcing 

 them to look at his pitiful penis.   This man just didn&apos;t fit the 

 stereotype they had come to expect. 

   

 But of course there are no valid stereotypes for sexual criminals. 

 Randy Woodfield was caught and arrested again on June 22, 1973, in 

 the Portland area, and charged with indecent exposure, resisting an 

 officer, and attempting to elude arrest.   He appeared chastened and 

 repentant in court.   He was sentenced to five months and twenty-five 

 days in jail (which he did not serve), and one year&apos;s probation.   The 

 resisting-anofficer charge was dropped. 

   

 On February 22, 1974, he was arrested for public indecency and 

 received five years&apos; probation.   Counseling was a mandatory part of 

 his probation--but he never followed up on it.   And no one forced him 

 to. 

   

 Records did not indicate that he had ever actually hurt any woman, 

 and he seemed to the sentencing judges to be a good risk.   He was a 

 student, a star athlete, and he had goals.   He was working to support 

 himself at the Tektronix Company in Beaverton, Oregon.   Beyond that, 

 there was the continuing problem of overcrowding in prisons.   If 

 every exposer arrested were sent to &quot;the walls,&quot; the walls would 

 burst.   Twice more, then, Randy Woodfield was given a suspended 

 sentence and placed on probation.   His promises sounded sincere; he 

 always promised he would seek therapy if he thought he could not 

 control his impulses to expose himself.   He reported 

 regularly--although grudgingly--to his probation officer. 

   

 After the 1973 football season at Portland State, Randy Woodfield&apos;s 

 dreams came true.   He was drafted in the seventeenth &quot;out&quot; by the 

 Green Bay Packers!   The small-town football hero had seemingly 

 achieved the impossible. 

   

 Vince Imbardi had been dead for three years, but the Packers&apos; glory 

 still lingered: five NFL championships and two Super Bowl victories. 

 This was the team that the boy Randy had watched avidly on his 

 family&apos;s television set through his growing-up years.   This was the 

 top, not some &quot;loser&quot; team, but the best.   The very best..   The Green 

 Bay Packers wanted him. 

   

 Randy signed his contract on February 20, 1974.   The Packers therein 

 promised to pay him--a &quot;skilled football player&quot;--sixteen thousand 

 dollars for the period extending from the date of signing until the 

 first of May following the close of the 1974 season.   In addition, he 

 would receive board and room and traveling expenses during preseason 

 training, as well as during the regular season.   To sweeten the pot, 

 there were bonuses to be had.   For Randy Woodfield there was a 

 three-thousand-dollar bonus going in.   If Randy should survive the 

 cuts and become a member of the forty-seven-man roster for the first 

 league game of the 1974 season, he would receive an additional 

 twenty-five hundred dollars. 

   

 If he should catch twenty-five passes in the regular NFL season, he 

 would receive two thousand dollars, and if he should catch thirty 

 passes, he would be rewarded with a three-thousand-dollar bonus. 

   

 In return for all this, the contract stipulated that Randy was 

 obligated to keep himself in excellent physical condition, avoid any 

 drinking of intoxicants, stay away from gamblers and gambling 

 resorts, and wear a coat and necktie in hotel lobbies, public eating 

 places, and all public conveyances.   He had to promise that he would 

 not write or sponsor magazine or newspaper articles or endorse any 

 product or service or participate in any radio or television programs 

 without permission of the Green Bay Packers. 

   

 There was not--at least in the official contract--any clause 

 regarding moral turpitude, conviction of crime, and the like.   It 

 apparently was a given that players screened carefully by the Packer 

 scouts would have no such skeletons in their closets. 

   

 The Green Bay Packer segment of Randy Woodfield&apos;s life was probably 

 the most memorable, although it was soon to be blighted.   He saved 

 all communiques from 1265 Lombardi Avenue, Qreen Bay, Wisconsin; he 

 would carry the stack of personal letters and mimeographed sheets 

 with him throughout his myriad changes of residence over the coming 

 years. 

   

 They were akin to messages from Hollywood to a would-be starlet. 

 They were magic. 

   

 Immediately upon his signing the contract, letters came with 

 instructions about early training camp to be held in Scottsdale, 

 Arizona.   An airline ticket arrived by certified mail.   The early 

 training session would be a &quot;get-acquainted period so that in July we 

 can all begin together toward our common goal, &apos;The Championship,&apos; &quot; 

 wrote Rank Kuhlman, an assistant coach.   A dinner would be held in 

 Phoenix on Apirl 4, and the Packers would pay all travel, lodging, 

 and meals plus fifty dollars for pin money.   Randy saved even the 

 airline-ticket carbon, carrying it with him for the next eight years. 

   

 Everything was being provided for him, everything but running shoes 

 and football shoes. 

   

 The Sporting News wrote from Missouri, asking for information for 

 their Football Register so that Randy&apos;s name could be added to the 

 new edition.   Randy Woodfield was suddenly &quot;somebody&quot; again. 

   

 His life was all football that spring and summer of 1974. 

   

 Things went well for Randy in Scottsdale, and he returned to his 

 Portland apartment to await further flurries of mail from Wisconsin. 

   

 Each envelope bearing the logo of the Packers&apos; helmet gave him 

 more proof that, by God, he had been chosen. 

   

 Trainer Domenic Gentile sent diagrams for building muscles.   John 

 Polonchek, another assistant coach, suggested that Randy try to 

 combine Gentile&apos;s stretching exercises with pass receiving.   &quot;1 would 

 suggest that you catch as many balls as possible each week, both 

 standing and moving catches.&quot; 

   

 In June there was another certified letter with a first-class airline 

 ticket--this time to Green Bay.   A limo would be waiting to take 

 Randy directly to the residence hall at St.   Norbert College in West 

 De Pere, Wisconsin.   Rather than flying, however, Randy chose to 

 drive his own car to the Midwest; it would give him added mobility. 

   

 There were rumors that the NFL players&apos; union was threatening to 

 strike training camps in July if no prior settlement was made, but 

 letters to Randy assured him he was under no compunction to join the 

 Players&apos; Association or to participate in the strike. 

   

 Randy didn&apos;t worry about it; he was too busy exercising, catching 

 passes, planning for his career in the pros.   When he received two 

 letters from head coach and general manager Dan Devine himself, 

 sending warm personal regards, it was the frosting on the cake, the 

 stamp of approval.   He would survive all the cuts; he would be on the 

 forty-seven-man traveling squad--he was sure of it. 

   

 But Randy Woodfield didn&apos;t make it with the Green Bay Packers.   He 

 was cut from the traveling squad.   He would later say that they 

 treated him &quot;more as a tackling dummy than anything else.&quot;   His forte 

 was in catching passes, and the Packers were, according to Randy, 

 working with a preponderance of running plays. 

   

 After he was cut, Randy stayed on in Green Bay for a while--but on 

 the farm team, playing for the Manitowac Chiefs from September 1974 

 until December, and working for the Oshkosh Truck Corporation as a 

 press-brake operator in the manufacture of fire trucks. 

   

 Even though he had been cut from the 1974 traveling squad, Randy 

 still thought he might work his way back up.   He was content for the 

 moment to play for the Chiefs.   He would always remember that the 

 roar of the crowds at the rookie game--forty thousand voices 

 strong--was music to his ears.   He loved everything about being with 

 the Packers, even if it was only on the farm team.   For the second 

 half of 1974 Randy Woodfield lived his dreams, as happy as he had 

 ever been in his life.   He hated only the weather in Wisconsin.   He 

 had been raised with rain and roaring surf in the wintertime; he 

 could not deal with endless snow. 

   

 The question of why Randy Woodfield was dropped by the Green Bay 

 Packers has different answers, depending upon who is giving those 

 answers.   Randy himself says that he tensed up when he should have 

 been playing confidently, went out too wide for passes that just 

 tippled on his fingers and then dropped to the ground.   Oddly, for an 

 athlete whose best skill was in catching passes, Randy Woodfield has 

 incongruously small hands.   The rest of his body nears perfection; in 

 photographs he usually poses casually with his hands behind his back. 

 Given his problem with catching passes, and the fact that the 

 Packers were stressing ground offense, he was the wrong man at the 

 wrong time. 

   

 He was, indeed, the wrong man. 

   

 The Green Bay Packers will not comment on why he was cut.   The Green 

 Bay Police Department declines to release any records they might have 

 on Randall Brent Woodfield.   Releast officially.   But rumors would 

 come back seven years later to Detective Dave Kominek that there had 

 been between ten and twenty incidents of indecent exposure in 

 Wisconsin involving Randy Woodfield. 

   

 One Wisconsin detective commented off the record: &quot;He couldn&apos;t keep 

 the thing in his pants.&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield would not be the first--or the last athlete to see 

 his blossoming career turn to ashes because of his sexual behavior. 

 It is almost expected that pro players will be cocksmen who seduce 

 willing female fans, the pretty little groupies who are there for the 

 picking.   That is the macho thing to do, and if it 

 doesn&apos;t interfere with the player&apos;s performance on the field, who&apos;s 

 going to blow the whistle?   But when Lance Rentzel was arrested for 

 exposing himself to young girls, he was, for all intents and 

 purposes, through with the Dallas Cowboys.   When Randy Woodfield&apos;s 

 nocturnal exhibitionism got back to Packer management, he was 

 finished too. 

   

 Randy packed up and returned to Portland.   He had sought one goal for 

 most of his twenty-three years.   He had had it within his grasp, and 

 then he had lost it.   The parade had passed him by.   He was 

 destroyed.   He felt that he had failed himself, and, worst of all, he 

 had disappointed his mother, who had always predicted and urged 

 greatness for her only son. 

   

 There was depression, and then there was rage. 

   

 Randy returned to Portland, but there was no reason to go back to 

 Portland State, even though he was within three terms of a college 

 degree.   He&apos;d really gone there to play football, and he was no 

 longer eligible to play amateur ball. 

  

 Randy worked desultorily at an electronics firm in a Portland suburb, 

 he worked part-time tending bar, and he dated many women, never 

 staying with one very long.   He shared a two-bedroom apartment with 

 Tim Rossi, a friend who had graduated from Portland State University. 

 Tim was his best friend and was currently an assistant professor at 

 Reed College in Portland. 

   

 Randy still saw old friends from high school from time to time.   He 

 talked fondly of the glory days at Newport High School and complained 

 about the raw deal he&apos;d received from the Packers.   He told friends 

 he&apos;d been cut from the Wisconsin team for &quot;flinching on the line.&quot; 

 He promised that he would show his old friends footage that showed 

 him playing with the Packers, explaining that Dan Devine himself had 

 promised to send him films.   But the films never arrived. 

   

 Randy was almost twenty-five years old now.   Most of his friends were 

 married and parents, moving ahead in the adult world.   Mike Schaeffer 

 was a schoolteacher.   Some members of the class of &apos;69 were 

 architects, medical students, dental students.   But Randy Woodfield 

 was going no place fast. 

   

 In the first months of 1975, the Portland police were dealing with an 

 inherently explosive situation.   Several women had been accosted at 

 knifepoint by a man who prowled Duniway Park at S.W.   Barbur 

 Boulevard and Sheridan.   Their attacker had exposed himself and then 

 forced his victims to fellate him to ejaculation.   After he had been 

 satisfied sexually, he had stolen their purses.   The man was 

 described as &quot;big&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; by the victims.   A few of them remarked 

 that he was young and good-looking.   He had sneaked up behind them so 

 quietly in the lonely park that they had had no chance at all to 

 scream for help. 

   

 When stakeouts by male police officers at Duniway Park did not turn 

 up the attacker with the knife, it was decided that a decoy was 

 needed to lure him from the woods.   The decoy would have to be a 

 female. 

   

 Policewoman Annette John volunteered for the assignment, aware that 

 her safety could not be guaranteed.   John would have to walk down the 

 deserted pathways alone while backup officers watched from some 

 distance. 

   

 John was given eight dollar bills whose serial numbers had been 

 recorded.   She walked through the quiet park on several occasions, 

 but nothing happened.   Perhaps the park prowler had sensed that the 

 police were watching; perhaps he had moved his operations to another 

 of Portland&apos;s many parks. 

   

 Shortly after noon on Wednesday, March 5, 1975, John&apos;s neck crawled 

 with the feeling that someone was padding behind her through fir 

 thickets that shut out light, their feathered branches so dense that 

 she could no longer see even the sun.   She forced herself to walk 

 slowly, to mimic the movements of the natural victim--the woman who 

 is unaware of her surroundings, who appears to be distracted.   She 

 told herself that the officers who were backing her up weren&apos;t really 

 far away, that she wasn&apos;t alone.   She had a signaling device to call 

 for help if she needed it. 

   

 Shortly before, one of the surveillance officers had observed a 

 Pontiac GTO as it pulled into the Terwilliger Plaza and parked.   The 

 driver, a tall male, strolled into Duniway Park and started up a 

 trail.   The officer waited; this was the sticky part--e had to wait 

 for John to signal if she needed help. 

   

 Suddenly, deep in the park, there was a sound behind the policewoman, 

 a soft footfall on the dirt path, an intake of breath.   She 

 half-turned, and felt the blade of a knife pressing against the flesh 

 of her neck. 

   

 Although John could neither see nor hear her backups, they could see 

 her signal, and they tensed.   The man was demanding her money as he 

 held the knife against her throat.   She handed the eight marked 

 dollar bills over and saw her assailant staring back at her boldly, 

 apparently weighing something in his mind.   His hands darted out and 

 stroked her breasts, and then he turned and headed back down the 

 trail. 

   

 The officers who had staked Out the park perimeters were waiting for 

 her assailant as he emerged from the park. 

   

 The suspect was big and muscular, but he was so surprised to find 

 that he had attacked a policewoman, and a policewomin accompanied by 

 several other officers, that he did not offer any resistance.   He 

 handed over the knife.   It was a paring knife. 

   

 &quot;What&apos;s your name?&quot;   the Portland officers asked. 

   

 &quot;Randall Woodfield.   I go to Portland State U.&quot; 

   

   

                                   6 

   

 This time, there would be no probation for Randy Woodfield.   In 

 addition to the paring knife he&apos;d used to threaten Officer John with, 

 arresting officers had confiscated a gun he&apos;d carried with him that 

 March day.   It was an Italian-made starter pistol.   Randy Woodfield&apos;s 

 attacks against women had escalated far beyond the incidents of 

 exhibitionism.   First charged with first-degree robbery, Randy 

 entered a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of second- degree 

 robbery on April 29, 1975.   The oral-sodomy charges involving 

 previous victims were dropped.   He was set for sentencing on June 

 4--but first his case was assigned to the Diagnostic Center of the 

 Oregon State Department of Human Resources.   He discussed his 

 &quot;problem&quot; with a state psychologist in the Rocky Butte Jail. 

   

 Randy admitted that he was &quot;totally guilty&quot; of the crime against 

 policewoman John and said that he was &quot;very sorry and deeply hurt&quot; 

 that he had caused so many problems.   He seemed almost relieved to 

 have been caught, and suggested that he possibly had a problem that 

 would require hospitalization. 

   

 According to Randy, his life had &quot;collapsed&quot; three years before 

 because of &quot;sexual problems.&quot;   (That would have been at the time of 

 his first arrest for indecent exposure.) 

   

 Randy related that he had discovered in college that he could not 

 cope with his sexuality, and he felt he had had much &quot;bad luck.&quot;   He 

 had lost a cherished girlfriend, had had his car stolen, and had 

 withdrawn from college.   Then, he said, he had met two religious 

 friends who had introduced him to the Christian faith.   He blamed his 

 current troubles with the law on his own inability to follow his 

 faith.   But as far as sex was concerned, he insisted that the 

 impulses that had driven him obsessively were out of his control. 

   

 He was not sure why he could not control himself with women; he did 

 not take drugs, and he had not drunk alcohol since becoming a 

 Christian in 1972.   He said he had taken steroids to help build his 

 body.   He thought that perhaps the steroids had magnified his sexual 

 urges. 

   

 As far as his leisure activity, he listed only music--playing the 

 accordion--sports, and reading religious literature.   He mentioned 

 that he had tried to curtail his dating activity, as he thought 

 removing himself from sexual opportunity might help him contain his 

 lust for women. 

   

 Financially, he had nothing.   He had had $57.50 in a bank account 

 before his arrest, but he&apos;d turned that over to his attorney.   He 

 owed almost three thousand dollars to the telephone company&apos;s credit 

 union for a school loan, and three hundred dollars to his parents for 

 gas needed to drive to Green Bay. 

   

 Randy Woodfield talked in a soft, well-modulated tone in speaking 

 with the state psychologist.   He appeared resigned, and depressed. 

 He opted for jail forever--or even death--if that would mean that he 

 could not continue his sexual prowlings.   He wanted treatment now, 

 even though he had never followed through on counseling before, 

 although it had been a mandatory stipulation of his probation.   He 

 insisted that he had robbed the women only because he needed money 

 and had been &quot;too proud&quot; to borrow from his family.   And yet all of 

 the robberies combined had netted him less than twenty-five dollars. 

   

 Randy Woodfield was given a brief intelligence test, and scored 

 surprisingly low.   This test indicated his IQ was around 100.   If it 

 was accurate, he would have had considerable difficulty in college, 

 and could not have hoped to meet grandiose expectations others had 

 for him. 

   

 The aspects of Woodfield&apos;s personality that alarmed the examiner were 

 his detachment from his crimes and the fact that he had used a knife 

 and had actually touched his victims.   These factors separated him 

 from the typical exposer.   It was possible that there was an 

 underlying psychotic thought process which was not easy to detect. 

 Randy&apos;s near-fanatic preoccupation with religion might be a danger 

 sign. 

   

 The final evaluation read, &quot;It would be my opinion that Mr. 

 Woodfield&apos;s problem is so severe as to be a very serious threat to 

 the community, and although treating him as an outpatient might 

 actually present him with a greater opportunity to be treated, I 

 think this would present too great a risk to the community.   For the 

 safety of the community, he needs to be in an institutional setting. 

 However, chances of being successfully treated in such a setting are 

 rather dim.&quot;   

   

 Catch 22.   Randy Woodfield might be successfully treated while he was 

 free, but he was too dangerous.   Locked up, treatment didn&apos;t look 

 hopeful.   He had shown that he would not seek treatment unless he was 

 compelled to do so.   No one 

 had any idea just how dangerous Randy was. 

   

 On June 10, 1975, Randy heard himself sentenced to ten years in the 

 Oregon State Penitentiary for armed robbery.   The Multnomah County 

 judge who sentenced him decried the fact that the charges resulting 

 from the sexual offenses in the other park cases had been dropped. 

 He opined that Randy Woodfield should be placed in a program for 

 sexually dangerous offenders in the Oregon State Hospital&apos;s 

 psychiatric unit instead of the state prison. 

   

 Instead, Randy joined the general population at the state 

 penitentiary in Salem.   A year earlier, the world had been his; he 

 had been on his way to join the Green Bay Packers.   Now he was only a 

 convict with ten years hanging over his head. 

   

 where had it all gone? 

   

 Randall Woodfield had another number now, not a two-digit number 

 emblazoned on a football jersey, but a longer number: 

 OSP 37376.   He was not a compliant prisoner; he received several 

 disciplinary &quot;tickets&quot; during his first months in prison.   He did not 

 believe that he deserved to be in the penitentiary in Salem, and he 

 was not about to obey the rules.   Guards warned one another that 

 Woodfield had a &quot;bad attitude.&quot; 

   

 There was one thing that really angered Randy about the Oregon State 

 Prison.   He resented the fact that some of the guards were females, 

 feeling that it wasn&apos;t fair that women could guard male prisoners, 

 although male guards never were assigned to the female prisoners&apos; 

 sections.   He was particularly annoyed when women guards seemed to 

 have free access to shower rooms and toilet facilities.   &quot;I was in 

 there for being an exhibitionist, and here&apos;s this female guard 

 watching me take a piss.   It was ironic, and it made me angry,&quot; he 

 would tell detectives years later. 

   

 In a group-therapy session sponsored by the Oregon State Hospital, 

 Randy bristled when a nurse asked the group to share their sexual 

 fantasies with her.   He stared back at her and said, &quot;You share your 

 sexual fantasies with us, and then I might share mine with you.&quot; 

   

 She declined, and wrote him up as antagonistic in group therapy. 

   

 Some of his other infractions were more trivial.   He grew a 

 beard--mostly to annoy the prison administration.   And he had 

 high-top Nike basketball shoes smuggled in to him in prison.   His 

 knees were going bad after football, and his ankles were failing on 

 him too; he needed the support of high-top shoes.   He laughed when 

 someone cited him&apos; for an infraction because of the shoes.   &quot;You get 

 dope smuggled in all the time; why get bent out of shape over a pair 

 of basketball shoes?&quot; 

   

 By 1976 Randy had acclimated somewhat to prison.   Since he had been 

 sentenced only on the robbery charge, he did not carry the stigma of 

 &quot;sex pervert&quot; which alienates other prison inmates.   He made friends; 

 some relationships that would continue after he had served his 

 sentence. 

   

 Randy was assigned to work in the dining room and kitchen, where he 

 was paid fifty cents a day.   He took college extension courses 

 through a program furnished by Chemeketa Community College in Salem, 

 earning A&apos;s and B&apos;s in courses in typing, accounting, computer 

 programming, economics, and...human sexuality.   He did not 

 participate at first in institutional therapy programs, but he did 

 involve himself in a group-therapy program run by the Reverend Simon 

 Beach.   Randy joined the Masters Men&apos;s Bible Club, the Freedom in 

 Christ group, as well as a Bible-study group that met informally in 

 the &quot;yard&quot; whenever the weather was nice. 

   

 He was far from abandoned by his family; his approved visitors&apos; list 

 included his grandmother, his sisters, his parents, three of his 

 closest friends, and women listed only as two &quot;Christian girls.&quot; 

   

 In his leisure time he played basketball, ran track, and lifted 

 weights until his body developed into a mass of muscles.   He soon 

 looked like a candidate for the Mr. America contest. 

   

 All in all, Randy Woodfield considered himself several rungs above 

 the average prison inmate.   But he enjoyed the other cons adulation 

 when he told them about his days playing with the Green Bay Packers. 

 Mostly, however, he concentrated on building up a huge network of 

 correspondents Outside the joint. 

   

 Randy wrote to friends from prison, reaching far back into the past. 

 He found the address of Traci Connors, the little girl who had had 

 such a crush on him years before.   Traci was surprised to hear from 

 him, and even more surprised to learn that he was writing from prison. 

   

 &quot;I was married when I heard from him.   It must have been 1976 or 

 1977.   His letters were kind of off-the-wall.   He wanted me to sell 

 some wallets he was making in prison so he&apos;d have some spending money. 

   

 &quot;He never told me why he was in prison, and I never asked him about 

 it.&quot; 

   

 Traci Connors wrote back to Randy Woodfield.   Although she was a 

 grown woman, she still remembered how she&apos;d felt about Randy when she 

 was only a girl, and she couldn&apos;t turn her back on him just because 

 he was in prison.   She didn&apos;t have much luck selling the wallets he&apos;d 

 made, but he seemed glad to have a correspondent anyway. 

   

 Randy sent Traci a picture of himself and a pretty girl, and she 

 thinks he wrote that the girl was from California.   His letter 

 explained that he had been engaged to the girl in the picture at one 

 time, but he said something had happened and they&apos;d broken up. 

 Still, he asked Traci to send the picture back after she&apos;d looked at 

 it.   She did send it back, and enclosed a picture of herself that 

 he&apos;d requested.   Their correspondence while Randy was in the state 

 penitentiary was platonic. 

   

 Randy had always been a letter writer, and he kept up voluminous 

 correspondence with old friends while he was in prison.   He wrote to 

 Mike Schaeffer, but Schaeffer answered only rarely.   They had stayed 

 in tenuous touch until Randy&apos;s conviction, but the chasm between them 

 now widened irrevocably.   Schaeffer felt guilt about abandoning 

 Randy, and would wonder later if he shouldn&apos;t have done more to help 

 his old friend--if it would have made any difference at all. 

   

 Randy Woodfield continued to theorize about what it might have been 

 that precipitated his attacks on women.   He speculated to prison 

 psychologists that it might be his ex-girlfriend&apos;s fault--because she 

 had rejected him.   &quot;I wanted to get back at a girl for something.&quot; 

 He thought that his animosity toward Sharon had generalized until he 

 felt vindictive toward all women.   Asked if he felt inadequate around 

 females, he said no.   He felt that he was attractive to women and 

 that he was quite capable of maintaining a good relationship with a 

 woman. 

   

 His insight into his problems was seriously flawed; his exhibitionism 

 had preceded the breakup with Sharon at Treasure Valley by a 

 half-dozen years.   His outward vanity and self-confidence warred with 

 his suggestion that one rejection was enough to spark violence toward 

 all women.   No, he had been aggressive toward females for a long, 

 long time--but he could not acknowledge any inadequacy as a male.   He 

 was big and strong; he looked like an Adonis.   His facade was all 

 perfection. 

   

 As far as sex was concerned, Randy explained to prison psychologists 

 in 1976 that he thought he had found a way to forestall any trouble 

 once he got out of prison.   &quot;What&apos;s going to help me is not getting 

 involved with a girl physically.   I always felt kind of guilty about 

 sex.   There&apos;s more to life than sex.&quot; 

   

 It was, of course, almost unrealistic and patently impossible path 

 for him to follow; sublimation of his burgeoning sexual drive was a 

 simplistic and flawed solution to his problems. 

   

 Randy stated confidently that his life&apos;s new goals were to help 

 others, to seek a woman for spiritual reasons, to find a wife and 

 settle down and raise a family when he was free. 

   

 He insisted that he had never hurt anyone.   &quot;I am not a violent 

 person.&quot; 

   

 Psychologists felt differently, and recommended against his release 

 in the foreseeable future. 

   

 Randy Woodfield did not serve ten years in prison.   He soon became 

 con-wise.   Being a smart-ass wasn&apos;t getting him out, and out was 

 where he wanted to be.   He learned that there were approved responses 

 when dealing with prison counselors.   He told prison psychologists 

 that he had accepted his guilt, that he realized he needed help.   If 

 he got out, the first thing he would do, he promised, would be to 

 seek psychiatric help.   He pointed out that he had solid support from 

 his family and friends and that his former employer was willing to 

 give him back his job at the electronics firm. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ve come to the point where I am beginning to accept myself and 

 stop being a phony,&quot; he told a staff psychologist.   &quot;I know I have a 

 problem, and I want to keep on top of it at all 

 times.   I&apos;ve learned to accept rejection from others, especially 

 females.   I don&apos;t take it personally anymore.   It&apos;s taken me twenty- 

 seven years to grow up, but I&apos;m making it now.   I have excellent 

 family support.   I used to be too ashamed to admit that I had a 

 problem.   But I found out in Reverend Beach&apos;s group that other guys 

 have problems, and if they can overcome them, I can do it too.   I am 

 not the same immature fellow that I used to be.   I used to just want 

 to play football and have fun.   But now I know that work is 

 important--I&apos;ve got to stop running and face myself for what I am.   I 

 have now got the courage and confidence to meet my problems directly. 

 I no longer feel a need to hide from them.&quot; 

   

 This time, Randy convinced the psychologist that he had gotten his 

 life together, and the counselor would write in his evaluation: 

 &quot;Woodfield&apos;s attitude is excellent.   This interviewer has met with 

 him many times and has come to know of Woodfield&apos;s sincere desire to 

 change.   Given Woodfield&apos;s good intelligence and abilities, his sound 

 support from others in the community, his insights into himself, his 

 remorse for what he has done, and his sincere desire to change, his 

 long-term prognosis is favorable.   He is a fitting candidate for Work 

 Release, and it would be a good transitional move for him to make. 

 It would help to bolster his self-confidence and give him time to 

 readjust to being free again in society.   He is not an escape risk, 

 nor is he a violence risk.&quot; 

   

 Randy&apos;s file was full of letters from friends and business 

 associates, all of them extolling his basic good character, all of 

 them reassuring that he would never get in trouble again. 

   

 After less than four years of a ten-year sentence, Randy learned he 

 was to be paroled in July 1979.   It occurred to him that it had been 

 ten years since his high-school class had graduated from Newport High 

 School and that it was time for a reunion.   Since he was still 

 constrained by his incarceration, Randy wrote to another old 

 friend--Alex Carter--and suggested that Alex set up a reunion.   Since 

 Alex was happily married to one of Randy&apos;s old girlfriends, perhaps 

 he felt he owed something to his former classmate. 

   

 Alex did all the work contacting the class of &apos;69 and organized a 

 celebration for August 25, 1979.   With Randy urging him on through 

 letters, Carter managed to draw quite a turnout. 

   

 Randy walked out of the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem two days 

 after the Fourth of July holiday.   The state of Oregon had furnished 

 him with $86.35 and he had $13.65 in his prison trust account.   He 

 was not concerned; he had a job waiting for him. 

   

 He did not expect to return to the walls. 

   

 The official program for the reunion of the Newport Cubs of 1969 

 listed Randy Woodfield at the head of the reunion committee. 

   

 There was a picnic and a volleyball game on the beach during the day, 

 and that evening, a banquet at the Inn at Otter Crest.   Randy 

 Woodfield, out of prison since July 6, was an enthusiastic 

 participant in the reunion.   He sported his prison-grown beard and he 

 had a pretty girl on his arm.   He posed with the rest of the class of 

 &apos;69 for a tenth-anniversary picture.   He joked with Mike Schaeffer 

 and seemed not to bear a grudge because Schaeffer had not written To 

 him during his last few years in prison. 

   

 Randy&apos;s classmates were tactful, and no one asked why he had been in 

 prison.   Indeed, many of them may not have known that he had been. 

 He talked about playing with the Green Bay Packers, and seemed his 

 old self, quiet but assured.   Privately he explained to Alex Carter 

 that he had gone to prison for robbing some Fotomat booths and that 

 he&apos;d been captured after police set up surveillance teams to trap him. 

   

 Half of that story was true--the part about the surveillance teams. 

 Randy had simply omitted some of the more bizarre details of his 

 encounters with the police. 

   

 Randy stayed with his parents during his visit to Newport for the 

 reunion, and then he returned to the Portland area, where he was 

 temporarily living with his sister Nancy until he got on his feet 

 financially. 

   

 He recouped rapidly; his job at Tektronix paid him six hundred 

 dollars a month, plus overtime.   He became eligible to borrow from 

 the company&apos;s credit union, and he took out a loan. 

   

 Randy had been assigned to the Clackamas County parole office, and to 

 a female parole officer.   Judy Pulliam.   Again, he had to report to a 

 woman, and meet with her approval in order to stay free.   Still, he 

 had a good chance to make it--if he could just stay within the 

 restrictions of his parole. 

   

 Pulliam&apos;s supervisor, Terry Gassaway, acknowledges that Randy did 

 report regularly to his parole officer at first.   &quot;He was basically 

 hostile to authority.   Sure, he would come in and he would report, 

 but he was kind of an ego-macho type.   He was evidently a football 

 player and he fancied himself to be a man&apos;s man.&quot;   

   

 Randy was hard to keep track of because he moved from place to place 

 so frequently, and he was resistant to any direction from other 

 people--either the employees at the Clackamas County 

 Community Corrections Center or his family--but he broke no serious 

 rules that were detectable.   There were no incidents between Randy 

 and Judy Pulliam that betrayed his resentment of women. 

   

 &quot;A lot of these guys are hostile toward their parole officers,&quot; 

 Gassaway commented, &quot;but there was nothing to show he had hostility 

 toward her [Pulliam] because she was a woman.&quot; 

   

 Randy had a lot of girlfriends--he was rarely seen with the same woman 

 twice.   Soon his little black book contained 255 names and phone 

 numbers--and all but a handful were women&apos;s. 

   

 He abandoned his job at Tektronix for bartending jobs, and that 

 opened up a whole world of women to him.   He was handsome and 

 sympathetic and charming to the girls--who came into the lounges 

 where he worked.   If some of them were underage--and many of them 

 were--he was not a stickler for ID. 

   

 He was so dedicated to making up for the four years of forced 

 celibacy in prison that he would later admit, &quot;I screwed up.   I was 

 in too much of a hurry, and I got herpes from one of them.&quot; 

   

 Traci Connors saw Randy for the first time in years in September 

 1980.   She was in the hospital in Raleigh Hills outside Portland and 

 she phoned Randy and asked him to come and visit her. 

   

 &quot;He came to the hospital on September 4 or 5 and he brought me a 

 kitten.   He was the same old Randy--at least he seemed the same.   He 

 was working at a bar near the hospital, and he seemed quite happy. 

 He told me that he was going to get into management where he worked. 

 He was driving his mother&apos;s gold VW with a sun roof.&quot; 

   

 Just as always, Traci found that Randy seemed genuinely interested in 

 what she was doing, and he told her about his life.   He explained 

 that he was living with a seventeen-year-old girl named Lucy and that 

 Lucy worked as a cocktail waitress, using 

 ID that said she was twenty-one. 

   

 Randy explained the ground rules of his relationship with Lucy.   &quot;I 

 love her, and she loves me, and we don&apos;t sleep with anyone else, but 

 we each have other friends.   The only thing that bothers me is that I 

 come home from work ready to go to bed, and Lucy comes home later, 

 and then all of her guy friends are out partying in the living room 

 when I try to sleep.&quot; 

   

 Traci saw Randy Woodfield once more on September 7, 1980--when she 

 visited the bar where he worked.   She talked with him for about 

 half an hour and then got up to leave. 

   

 &quot;I told him I was going to hitchhike home, and Randy got real upset. 

 He offered to pay for a taxi for me.   He told me that I didn&apos;t know 

 what kind of people might be out there, and he asked me what I would 

 do if a crazy person got hold of me.   I finally took the bus home so 

 he wouldn&apos;t worry.&quot;   

   

   

                                   7 

   

 Beth Wilmot remained in the hospital on January 22, 1981, recovering 

 from both her wounds and the shock of the attack that had taken the 

 life of her best friend.   She was still under guard.   Until the night 

 of January 18, Beth&apos;s life had been uneventful.   Born on May 30, 

 1960, she had grown up in California, attending Castroville 

 Elementary School in Castroville, and graduating from North Salinas 

 High School in Salinas.   In the short resume she&apos;d mailed to Salem 

 businesses in early January, 1981, Beth had attached a sheet listing 

 her work experience.   She was only twenty, and the list was short; 

 she&apos;d worked as a cashier at the Giant Artichoke Restaurant in 

 Castroville and as hostess and bus girl at the Apple Tree Restaurant 

 in Spokane.   She had had a semester of typing and two years of home 

 economics.   She described herself as being five feet, five inches 

 tall and weighing one hundred and fifteen pounds, and noted that she 

 had never learned to drive. 

   

 of the three personal references she&apos;d given, Shari Hull was now 

 dead, and the other two were from out of state.   Beth was virtually 

 alone now in Salem, and Dave Kominek and his wife, Gail, &quot;adopted&quot; 

 Beth, letting her know that there were people in Salem who cared 

 about her. 

   

 As Beth recovered, she received another blow.   Physicians at Salem 

 Memorial Hospital discovered that she had contracted herpes; the 

 killer-rapist had infected her with the venereal disease for which 

 there is no cure. 

   

 Dave Kominek sent out the first of what were to be a flurry of 

 bulletins seeking information on the killer he sought.   Using an 

 Identi-Kit, technicians had come up with a composite picture of the 

 suspect.   Later it would prove to be incredibly similar to the actual 

 killer.   In that first flier, the line-drawing image stares back 

 at the viewer through cold eyes set in a rather handsome mustached 

 face.   The hair is covered by a hood-cap garment. 

   

 Suspect: WHITE MALE, 25 to 30 years, 5&apos;10&quot; to 6&apos;, 140 to 160, sandy 

 color hair, i.e.: akin to dishwater color, collar-length.   Ruddy 

 complex (possibly pockmarked).   Deep voice.   Clothing: blue jeans, 

 tennis shoes, hooded tan-colored jacket (vinyl, leather, or 

 polyester).   Waist-length.   Wearing driving type gloves.   Weapon: 

 Dark blue revolver, with four- to six-inch barrel.   .32-cal.   6-shot. 

   

 Any avail.   info, contact Det.   Kominek or Det.   Boutwell, Marion 

 County SO.   Ph.   588-5113.   Refer to our case CR81- 3152. 

   

 When that first bulletin went out, Dave Kominek had no warning of the 

 deluge of calls that would follow.   There were scores of departments 

 working unsolved assault cases against young women.   At this point, 

 no connections had been made.   When the pieces finally fell together, 

 a hundred detectives would realize that they were all looking for the 

 same man.   But in the first days of February 1981, they were looking 

 for a phantom who seemed to rove at will up and down the I-5 freeway. 

   

 Kominek conferred with the new district attorney for Marion County, 

 Oregon, Chris Van Dyke.   Van Dyke would be catapulted into the public 

 eye as he worked constantly with the detectives who sought the man 

 called the I-5 Killer.   And, like the lawmen, he would find that all 

 personal considerations would be put on hold until the killer was 

 caught.   Seven months of his life would be totally taken up with the 

 I-5 Killer. 

   

 Van Dyke had lived with celebrity all of his thirty years, but a 

 different kind of celebrity.   Chris Van Dyke is the son of comedian 

 Dick Van Dyke, and he resembles his famous father a great deal.   He 

 too is tall and lanky, and the grin that spreads over his long-jawed 

 face is his father&apos;s grin.   He moves with the same awkward grace.   By 

 1981 Chris had traveled far from Hollywood--both in distance and in 

 life-style. 

   

 Chris Van Dyke attended college first at Occidental University in Los 

 Angeles.   He took a year off to travel before graduating, a year in 

 which he covered twenty thousand miles seeing the United States. 

 Months of that period were spent in the Northwest, 

   

 and he found the region much to his liking.   He attended Whitworth 

 University in Spokane for a while, but he returned to Occidental to 

 receive his undergraduate degree.   He obtained his law degree at 

 Arizona State University, graduating near the top of his class. 

   

 The Northwest still beckoned to Van Dyke, and, as fate would have it, 

 one of his professors at Arizona State was Oregon Supreme Court 

 Justice Arno Denecke, on sabbatical to teach there.   When Van Dyke 

 had his law degree, he knew that the place he wanted to be was 

 Oregon, and he applied for positions there.   Justice Denecke 

 remembered the young lawyer and the brilliance he had shown in 

 grasping the law.   He hired Chris Van Dyke as his legal assistant and 

 Van Dyke moved to Salem in 1975. 

   

 After two years with the chief justice, Van Dyke served as a deputy 

 district attorney in Benton County in Corvallis, Oregon, for two and 

 a half years, and then he returned to Salem to work in the appellate 

 division of the Oregon Attorney General&apos;s office. 

   

 In May 1980 Chris Van Dyke took a gamble.   He ran for Marion County 

 district attorney-and won.   He was only twenty- nine years old, and 

 he had yet to prosecute a murder case. 

   

 Chris Van Dyke is as dedicated to the law as his father is to the 

 theater, and as punctilious about the detail and hard work that go 

 with career success.   Van Dyke worked closely with Kominek and 

 Holloway to track Shari Hull&apos;s killer.   Van Dyke agreed that Beth 

 Wilmot might remember more about her attacker if she were to undergo 

 hypnosis; Beth trusted Dave Kominek, and on February 3 she agreed to 

 be hypnotized in the presence of police artist Dave Barrios, in the 

 hope that a more precise image of the killer might emerge. 

   

 Kominek asked Beth to pick a place where she felt safe and happy, and 

 she chose to picture herself in the room of a boyfriend whom she 

 cared about.   She would be safe, Kominek assured her continually; she 

 would view what had happened on a &quot;television set,&quot; removed from all 

 danger.   She would not have to relive the attack; she would only be 

 an observer--as if she were only watching a television show. 

   

 &quot;Now, Beth,&quot; Kominek&apos;s voice droned, &quot;while you&apos;re in this very, very 

 comfortable place, you just really feel good.   You can hear 

 everything that&apos;s going on and you just want to remain like you are. 

 You&apos;re very, very relaxed, very, very comfortable.   I want you to 

 just think now, imagine that you&apos;re at the top of a stairs, and the 

 stairway is about ten steps...real gradual steps.   I want you to 

 imagine that you&apos;re going down.   Each step you take, you&apos;re going 

 further and further into relaxation.   You start with the top step, 

 and that&apos;s number ten, and then down to nine...down 

 to eight...down to seven...six.   Five.   Four. 

 Three.   Down to two...one. 

   

 Beth was in a beautiful garden.   An imaginary balloon was tied to her 

 wrist and her arm was light as a feather as it floated upward with 

 the balloon&apos;s delicate tug.   Kominek asked her to imagine a calendar, 

 and then the pages were ripped off until she found herself once again 

 back to the eighteenth of January. 

   

 &quot;You remember that you are not really there; you can just watch this. 

 You are watching this on TV.   You can take this TV and bring it up 

 close or you can push it further away.&quot; 

   

 Beth smiled and nodded.   She was not afraid. 

   

 &quot;You and Shari are going to get the gas.   Now you are going to have 

 to go to work.   You can see that Shari has to take a shower.   Now you 

 are getting ready to go to work.   It is just you and Shari, and you 

 go to work.&quot; 

   

 Again Kominek reminded Beth that she was only watching the scene on a 

 television set--that she was in no danger, that no one could hurt 

 her.   

   

 &quot;Now, this man is going to enter.   You can see this on the TV.   He 

 comes through the door.   You can see him coming through the door. 

 He&apos;s got a gun in his hand.   Now, Beth, I want you to watch him.   I 

 want you to concentrate on what he is wearing.&quot; 

   

 The tape recorder spun on as Kominek left the room.   There was no 

 sound but Beth Wilmot&apos;s relaxed breathing.   Then Kominek ushered Dave 

 Barrios in to listen to Beth&apos;s responses and sketch a face as she 

 talked.   Even in Beth&apos;s hypnotic state, the tape recorder would pick 

 up some tension in her voice, fear that surfaced despite Kominek&apos;s 

 repeated assurances that no one could hurt her. 

   

 Slowly Beth described the killer again. 

   

 Beth: &quot;I can&apos;t see his hair.&quot; 

   

 Barrios: &quot;You can&apos;t see his hair.   Did he have a hat on?&quot; 

   

 Beth: &quot;He had a hood.&quot; 

   

 Barrios: &quot;He had a hood on?   Did he keep that hood on all the time?&quot; 

   

 Beth: &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; 

   

 Barrios: &quot;Like a sweatshirt hood...or a jacket hood?&quot; 

   

 Beth: &quot;Jacket.&quot; 

   

 They worked on.   Beth&apos;s eyes teared and her mascara melted into 

 smudgy streams down her cheeks.   She did not notice.   For an hour she 

 answered Barrios&apos; questions.   At length his sketchpad was filled with 

 a ghostlike face.   The killer looked at him from lidded eyes, his 

 mouth drawn into a cruel, tight line.   The hood had emerged almost 

 like a monk&apos;s hood. 

   

 Gently Dave Kominek led Beth back through the days of the calendar 

 until it was once again February 3.   She sat up and looked around. 

   

 &quot;How long do you think you were in here?&quot;   he asked her. 

   

 &quot;A half hour.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   What time did we come in?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; 

   

 &quot;It was about two-thirty: It&apos;s five after four now. 

   

 Beth was amazed.   &quot;Really!   How long have I been in here?&quot; 

   

 &quot;An hour and a half.&quot; 

   

 Kominek handed Beth a tissue and suggested that she wipe the smeared 

 mascara from her cheeks.   She couldn&apos;t remember that she had cried. 

 Embarrassed, she was a typical teenager again, worried that her 

 makeup looked &quot;awful.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I didn&apos;t remember enough,&quot; she apologized.   &quot;I saw his eyes.   I kept 

 seeing his eyes.&quot; 

   

 Beth looked directly at Kominek.   &quot;I want you to take me to 

 TransAmerica.   We&apos;ll go back there and I&apos;ll remember more.   I&apos;m 

 afraid to go back there, but I will if it will help.&quot; 

   

 Kominek agreed to drive Beth to the building where she had come close 

 to death.   But even when they walked through the lunchroom at the 

 TransAmerica Building, she remembered no more.   The man was young, 

 tall, and cruel.   He had worn a Band-Aid on his nose, dark red and 

 white sports shoes, and a hooded jacket.   The memory of his face 

 still terrified her, frightening her so much that her mind shut down 

 whenever she tried to recreate it in detail. 

   

 &quot;Catch him,&quot; Beth said.   &quot;If you catch him, I&apos;ll know him.   I&apos;ll 

 never, ever forget that face.&quot;

 After the death of Shari Hull, citizens in Salem, Oregon, had flooded 

 the Marion County Sheriff&apos;s Office with tips on possible suspects in 

 the murder.   Detectives were receiving over two hundred phone calls a 

 day.   Marion County had only four detectives, and Lieutenant Mccoy 

 and Jay Boutwell were working on another, unrelated homicide.   That 

 left Dave Kominek and Monty Holloway to find Shari&apos;s killer.   The 

 pair followed each new thread of information to its end, finding 

 nothing that would help in the investigation. 

   

 They obtained computer listings of all parolees released in the 

 previous two years from the Oregon State Penitentiary after serving 

 time for rape, other sex offenses, or murder.   They ran down the 

 location of each parolee, and found not one who physically resembled 

 Shari Hull&apos;s killer. 

   

 The only conclusion Kominek and Holloway could reach was that the 

 killer with the Band-Aid on his nose was not local, that he had to be 

 a drifter who had seized the moment when he chanced to glimpse the 

 two girls cleaning the TransAmerica office.   If he was not local, he 

 might well be anywhere, long gone. 

   

 Deputy Bernie Papenfus had told them that he&apos;d seen a man just after 

 the first call for help came in, and that man had been on foot.   That 

 did not mean that he hadn&apos;t stashed his vehicle somewhere safely away 

 from the crime scene and walked back to confront the girls.   But no 

 one could know what that vehicle looked like.   No one but Beth Wilmot 

 knew what the man really looked like. 

   

 On February 3 Dave Kominek sent out a teletype request for 

 information on similar crimes to the seven western states.   The M.O. 

 (modus operandi) of murder and sexual assault was new to Salem; 

 Kominek hoped that it might sound familiar to detectives in other 

 jurisdictions. 

   

 &quot;We got a call the next day,&quot; Kominek recalls.   &quot;From all the way 

 down in California, Shasta County to be exact.   Captain Jim Carter 

 and Detective Gene Farley called.   They had had a double murder down 

 there the very day I sent the teletype--a terrible crime--and they 

 thought that the death weapon might have been a .32-caliber gun, just 

 as ours was.   They were waiting for autopsy results to be sure.&quot;   

   

 On February 3 Steve Eckard, a Redding, California, firefighter had 

 drawn a twenty-four hour shift at the Mountain Gate Station.   It is 

 ironic that policemen and firefighters, who protect other men&apos;s 

 families, often have to leave their own families unprotected during 

 the dark, dangerous hours of the night.   Eckard&apos;s wife, Donna Lee, 

 thirty-seven, and his fourteen-year-old stepdaughter, Janell Jarvis, 

 were home alone on that Tuesday evening.   A young stepdaughter, 

 Kristin Jarvis, twelve, was away from home during the early part of 

 the evening.   The Eckard family lived at the end of Holiday Road in a 

 development in Mountain Gate, California, some eight miles north of 

 Redding, just south of the Lake Shasta Caverns and directly on the 

 I-5 freeway. 

   

 Donna Lee Eckard worked as a registered nurse at Mercy Hospital on 

 the day shift, and when Steve worked nights at the fire department, 

 it seemed that they were like ships passing in the night--but they 

 both were devoted to their professions, jobs that saved lives. 

   

 Steve Eckard talked to his wife for the last time at three- thirty in 

 the afternoon.   Donna Lee had been to a doctor that afternoon for a 

 minor surgical procedure, and she told her husband that she wasn&apos;t 

 feeling well and that she was going to lie down. 

   

 Twelve-year-old Kristin Jarvis stayed late at the Bass school to 

 watch a basketball game, and called her mother at six P.M.   to ask 

 permission to go to a friend&apos;s house.   Donna Lee sounded sleepy to 

 Kristin, as if she had just been wakened from a nap.   She told 

 Kristin that it would be all right for her to visit her friend if she 

 was home by nine o&apos;clock. 

   

 The seventh-grader arrived home promptly, and checked the downstairs 

 clock, noting that it was eight minutes to nine.   She called out to 

 her mother and sister...but no one answered.   Not really alarmed, she 

 walked through the neat home, still calling to Donna Lee and Janell. 

   

 When she came to her parents&apos; bedroom, Kristin Jarvis stumbled on a 

 frozen tableau of horror-a sight that no twelve-year-old should ever 

 have to see.   Both her mother and her sister were in the house, but 

 they could no longer respond. 

   

 They lay side by side on the bed.   Donna Lee lay on her back; she 

 wore only a nightgown that had been pulled down, exposing her 

 breasts.   Her glasses were still in place, but her ankles were 

 crossed and bound with white surgical tape; her arms had been twisted 

 beneath her and her wrists were bound with the same tape.   A wide 

 swath of tape covered her mouth and nose. 

   

 Fourteen-year-old Janell was completely nude, her face covered with 

 blood. 

   

 Kristin accepted with dull shock that her sister was dead, but she 

 thought her mother might be alive.   She wrenched the tape gag from 

 Donna Lee&apos;s face and begged her to answer.   Her mother didn&apos;t respond. 

   

 And then Kristin was afraid that they were both dead.   As a 

 firefighter&apos;s daughter, Kristin had been taught what to do in an 

 emergency.   She had been told that you must never assume the worst, 

 that sometimes accident or drowning victims could be brought back if 

 medical help was called in time.   She picked up the phone and dialed 

 the emergency number that fed into lines at Mercy Hospital. 

   

 &quot;My mother...my sister...send help quickly.   Holiday Road.   The 

 Eckards.&quot; 

   

 The call came in at one minute after nine.   Sergeant Boatner and 

 Corporal Dan Cunningham of the Shasta County sheriff&apos;s patrol 

 responded to the call, along with officers Coe and Wooden.   Personnel 

 at Mercy Hospital called the Mountain Gate fire station to ask that 

 emergency medical technicians respond.   For Steve Eckard, it was the 

 nightmare that all peace and fire officers dread.   This time, it was 

 his own home where help was needed. 

   

 Chief Dave Selby, Assistant Chief Leroy Porteous, and Captain Dan 

 Selby raced with Eckard to his home.   It wasn&apos;t very far to Holiday 

 Road; Mountain Gate is a small town.   The fire department personnel 

 arrived at the Eckard home in five minutes.   Two minutes later, the 

 sheriff&apos;s men pulled up. 

   

 The deputies could see Steve Eckard comforting Kristin in the living 

 room, and Dan Selby and Porteous advised them that there were two 

 bodies in the upstairs bedroom.   Steve Eckard told them that he had 

 viewed the bodies, that they were those of his wife and elder 

 stepdaughter. 

   

 Cunningham and Boatner could see what appeared to be a bullet wound 

 in Janell Jarvis&apos; neck, and the tape bonds on her mother: They 

 immediately secured the scene and notified detectives Gene Farley and 

 Rick Burnett. 

   

 Farley and Burnett recognized the &quot;execution-style&quot; method of murder. 

 They saw that Donna had been shot too, possibly twice.   Janell had 

 suffered many wounds, at least a half-dozen, all in the back of her 

 head.   What they could not fathom was why this peaceful residence at 

 the dead end of a residential street should be the scene of such 

 carnage. 

   

 The two detectives had to ask the most onerous question, to get it 

 out of the way, although they felt they already knew the answer. 

 Detectives always look first at those closely related to murder 

 victims, since statistics bear out the fact that most victims are 

 killed by relatives and close associates.   They signaled to the fire 

 chief and drew him aside. 

   

 Where had Steve Eckard been during the previous three or four hours? 

 The answer came immediately from his fellow firefighter.   Eckard had 

 been on duty at the station. 

   

 Kristin volunteered that she had talked to her mother at six and that 

 she&apos;d been fine then.   A little sleepy, but she hadn&apos;t sounded 

 frightened or alarmed about anything. 

   

 &quot;Did she say anything, Kristin--anything about what she planned to do 

 this evening?&quot;   Farley asked gently. 

   

 The girl shook her head, and then remembered.   &quot;She said she had to 

 go down to Jake&apos;s Market to get a couple of things.&quot; 

   

 Farley and Burnett knew Jake&apos;s; everyone who regularly traveled the 

 I-5 probably knew Jake&apos;s--a little store located just off the freeway 

 at the end of the street where the Eckards lived.   Vacationers 

 traveling into the resort area around Lake Shasta could count on 

 Jake&apos;s for a supply of cold beer, beans, hot dogs--the standard 

 camping provender. 

   

 Janell&apos;s jeans lay on the floor next to the bed, and Burnett 

 carefully fished a check from the back pocket.   It was dated February 

 3, made out to Jake&apos;s and signed by Donna Eckard.   Something had 

 stopped Janell from going into the store and cashing it. 

   

 No one but the killer could know exactly what had happened to Donna 

 Eckard and her daughter, but reconstruction of the crime suggested 

 that the two had left their home to make a quick trip down to Jake&apos;s 

 to purchase breakfast supplies.   Donna Eckard had apparently thrown 

 on a coat over her nightgown and driven Janell down to the store. 

 The coat was in the bedroom too, carelessly thrown over the end of 

 the bed.   All things being equal, Janell would have taken the check 

 and gone in to buy bread, milk, and cereal. 

   

 The detectives checked at Jake&apos;s Market and found that Donna and 

 Janell had not been in to shop earlier in the evening.   They hadn&apos;t 

 made it that far.   Someone had intercepted them. 

   

 The motive for murder?   Clearly sexual.   The bodies were nude and 

 half-nude.   It would take an autopsy to determine if rape had 

 actually occurred.   Steve Eckard checked through the house and said 

 that all the items a burglar or robber might look for were there: the 

 stereo, television sets, jewelry.   The only thing missing was his 

 handgun: a .38 Special Medel 60 Smith and Wesson.   It was a unique 

 gun with a stainless-steel three-inch barrel and walnut grips. 

 Eckard was able to give the Shasta detectives the serial number of 

 the missing weapon. 

   

 The bodies of the victims were removed to await postmortem 

 examination. 

   

 When the results of those autopsies came in a day later, Gene Farley 

 and Rick Burnett were back on the phone to Kominek in Salem.   Donna 

 Lee Eckard and Janell Jarvis had been shot in the head: seven bullets 

 for the teenager and two for her mother.   The bullets retrieved had 

 come from a .32-caliber handgun, just as had the bullets in the 

 shooting of Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot.   Even though Mountain Gate, 

 California, was more than four hundred miles south of Salem, a 

 commonality was developing between the cases: female victims; two 

 victims at a time; .32 caliber bullets; execution-style wounds to the 

 back of the head; location of crime scenes hard by the I-5 freeway. 

   

 And there was more.   Beth and Shari had been subjected to oral 

 sodomy.   Fourteen-year-old Janell Jarvis had been sodomized anally, 

 after death.   There was no evidence that Donna Lee Eckard had been 

 sexually abused, although her nightgown had been disarranged.   The 

 victims had died only an hour before they were discovered by Kristin 

 Jarvis; rigor mortis had not even begun when they were found, nor had 

 there been any lividity patterns in the lower portions of the bodies. 

 (Lividity is the purplish-red striation that results when blood 

 settles after the heart stops pumping.) 

   

 Kristin&apos;s arrival home had surely come almost on the heels of the 

 killer&apos;s departure.   A few minutes earlier, and Kristin Jarvis too 

 might have become a murder victim. 

   

 &quot;And the Mountain Gate case isn&apos;t the only one that seems to fit,&quot; 

 Burnett continued.   &quot;A subject wearing a green jacket, jeans, gloves, 

 and tennis shoes, with tape over the bridge of his nose, is wanted 

 down here for questioning in a rape, kidnap, and sodomy case in 

 Redding on February 3.   We&apos;ve got one the next day in Yreka, and I&apos;ve 

 found a Winchell&apos;s Donut robbery in Grants Pass on January 29, a 

 grocery-store robbery in Medford--same day motel robbery in Ashland 

 on February 4.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I think we&apos;re looking for the same man,&quot; Kominek said.   &quot;It looks as 

 though a whole lot of jurisdictions are looking for the Same man.&quot; 

   

 They promised to stay in touch; the Shasta County sheriff&apos;s 

 detectives would look through reports for more &quot;Band-Aid&quot; cases in 

 northern California and southern Oregon.   Kominek would check north 

 from Eugene. 

   

 Shasta County was not the only department responding to Kominek&apos;s 

 teletypes asking for similar cases.   The response was far greater 

 than he had expected.   Indeed, he had begun to receive a virtual 

 storm of replies. 

   

                                    9 

   

 Randy Woodfield had so many jobs and so many addresses between July 

 1979 and March 1981, it was hard for his parole officer, Judy 

 Pulliam, to keep track of him. 

   

 He usually doctored his employment application forms so that the 

 four-year gap left by his stint in the penitentiary didn&apos;t have to 

 be explained.   Basically, all he had to do was subtract those years 

 from his age; he didn&apos;t like to admit even to himself that he was 

 thirty years old.   He was in good shape; he looked younger, and he 

 could easily pass for a man in his mid-twenties. 

   

 Randy jumped from woman to woman, even more frequently than he 

 changed jobs, trying to find someone who might remain completely 

 entranced with him.   While it might be expected that a man who had 

 been without female sex partners for four years would be &quot;hungry&quot; for 

 sex, Randy Woodfield was &quot;starving.&quot; 

   

 Randy looked for likely female candidates everywhere, and he was very 

 resourceful.   Just after his release from prison in July 1979, he 

 followed two pretty young women down the I-5 freeway, passing them, 

 pulling back, and signaling until they stopped, rolled down their car 

 window, and asked him if he wanted to go swimming.   He nodded and 

 followed them to their apartment. 

   

 The afternoon went well, and he called one of the girls, Moira 

 Bandon, two days later.   By mid-August they were living together. 

 Shortly thereafter, Moira was chagrined to find that she had 

 contracted herpes.   She forgave Randy, and their relationship lasted 

 until November, when they had a fight and Randy moved out.   Beyond 

 the herpes, she had a memento; Randy had gifted Moira with one of his 

 nude photos.   He continued to call her for the next year and a half, 

 and they maintained a friendship, even though the romance had gone 

 out of their relationship. 

   

 After Randy quit his job at Tektronix, he was hired by the Cheerful 

 Tortoise lounge, where he worked as a bartender.   Fellow employees at 

 the Cheerful Tortoise were puzzled that Randy seemed fixated on young 

 girls of sixteen or seventeen.   Although his co-workers found him 

 easygoing and a &quot;pretty nice guy, they wondered why all of his close 

 friends were women.   One of the other bartenders describes Randy as 

 &quot;having an eighteen-year-old level of conversation.   He was kind of a 

 dumb-blond type--except that he was a man.&quot;   

   

 During his Cheerful Tortoise era, Randy did date one woman who was 

 only five years younger than he was, a pretty woman who worked at a 

 bank.   She had met him on the street when he was riding his 

 motorcycle.   At first she&apos;d found him attractive, but later she saw 

 sides to him that troubled her.   He was obsessed with female breasts, 

 so much so that he seemed &quot;kinky&quot; to her.   But what really broke them 

 up was their almost complete lack of communication. 

   

 &quot;He just wasn&apos;t very smart,&quot; she explained to detectives who 

 questioned her years later.   &quot;I&apos;m ashamed to think that I dated Randy 

 at all.   He wore thin pretty quickly.&quot; 

   

 Randy was incensed when the bank-teller broke up with him, and he 

 told co-workers at the Cheerful Tortoise that he wanted revenge.   But 

 after two days of blind rage, he stopped talking about the breakup. 

   

 Randy wasn&apos;t officially fired from the Cheerful Tortoise, but his 

 employment there was terminated by mutual consent with the owners. 

   

 After he left the Cheerful Tortoise, he went to work at the Faucet 

 Tavern on S.W.   Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway in Beaverton, Oregon.   He 

 had answered an ad in the paper placed by the Faucet management in 

 late March 1980.   He was hired on April 9 to be a relief bartender 

 and assistant manager.   He worked the night shift from six P.M.   to 

 two-thirty A.M.   His salary was two hundred and fifty dollars a week, 

 plus tips.   The money was good, and the women were plentiful.   He 

 liked the Faucet job, but he was let go on the first of October.   His 

 employer recalls that Randy was very soft-spoken and that he was 

 simply unable to assert the authority that the job demanded.   Randy 

 was certainly big enough, but he didn&apos;t seem to have what it took to 

 muscle pugnacious drunks out of the place, nor did he command much 

 respect from the younger employees. 

   

 Within a week or two of Randy&apos;s dismissal, three thousand dollars was 

 taken from the Faucet Tavern&apos;s cash register.   Entry had not been 

 forced, and Randy was the only person other than the owners who had a 

 key to the place.   The tavern owners went to Randy&apos;s home in Lake 

 Oswego to confront him, and they 

 finally found him hiding in the attic.   He denied the theft, but he 

 was furious that he had been accused.   He wrote a thinly veiled 

 threat letter to his former employers.   Later, with some glee, he 

 admitted to one of his few platonic female friends, Dixie Palliter, 

 that he was the one who had ripped off the Faucet Tavern. 

   

 After the Faucet burglary, word got around, and Randy couldn&apos;t find 

 another bartending job.   He worked thereafter in jobs that didn&apos;t 

 suit him nearly as well as the Faucet had.   He was employed for a 

 while at one of the Shakey&apos;s pizza outlets, and then as a clerk for a 

 7-11 store.   He was fired from the 7-11 job too, although there were 

 no overt reasons given. 

   

 Randy moved from his sister&apos;s home to Park Street in Portland, then 

 to Oleson Road, and then to a rental house on Pilkington in Lake 

 Grove, Oregon.   Almost all of his mail bore at least one forwarding 

 address. 

   

 It took a while for some of his correspondents to catch up with him. 

 One letter was forwarded to him--the letter that he would save 

 carefully in his memorabilia file.   Randy had made it a practice in 

 the past to send pictures of himself--in the nude or in bathing 

 trunks--to women friends.   In late 1979 he had decided to enlarge his 

 circle of admirers.   He sent one of the shots of himself with muscles 

 glistening and bulging to Playgirl magazine in Santa Monica, 

 California.   Playgirl had had enthusiastic response from readers on 

 its &quot;beefcake&quot; centerfolds aping Playboy&apos;s gorgeous female shots. 

 Randy figured he looked as good as any of the macho males he&apos;d seen 

 featured. 

   

 In May 1980 he received a letter in response from Playgirl: 

   

 Congratulations!   You have been selected for possible publication in 

 Playgirl&apos;s Guy Next Door feature. 

   

 Please return the enclosed model release and information sheet as 

 soon as possible. 

   

 Don&apos;t be discouraged if you do not hear from us right away.   We 

 reconsider all submissions each month. 

   

 Playgirl will notify you when we determine the issue for which you 

 have been selected. 

   

 Thank you for your time and patience.   Playgirl looks forward to 

 seeing more of you soon. 

   

 Sincerely, 

   

 Alison Morley Photo Editor 

   

 The letter came addressed to R.   B Wood.   Randy was willing to bare 

 his muscular body to the readers of Playgirl, but had apparently 

 planned to do it with a pseudonym.   He thumbed through Playgirl 

 eagerly each month to see if his picture had been selected.   It was 

 never there, and, given his later notoriety, the magazine had been 

 prudent in choosing not to feature him. 

   

 By the late spring of 1980 Randy had set up housekeeping with still 

 another woman: Lucy Grant--the girl he had described to Traci Connors 

 when he visited her in the hospital.   They signed a lease together on 

 June 10, 1980, for the house on Pilkington Road in Lake Grove, 

 Oregon, on a month-to-month basis.   Randy and Lucy promised to pay 

 three hundred dollars a month.   His cohabitation with Lucy was the 

 longest stretch of domesticity he had ever enjoyed with a woman, and 

 he&apos;d been expansive when he described his love affair to Traci 

 Connors, sure that Lucy was faithful to him despite her penchant for 

 inviting young men home to listen to her stereo and party while he 

 tried to sleep after working all night. 

   

 Randy himself operated under his own moral guidelines; he kept an eye 

 out for new conquests.   While he was living with 

 Lucy, he met a seventeen-year-old girl named Julie Reitz at the 

 Faucet Tavern.   That meeting took place in August 1980.   He&apos;d 

 graciously looked the other way and allowed the underage girl into 

 the tavern.   Julie, like most teenage girls, found him &quot;cute&quot; and she 

 flirted with him.   Later she met him for lunch.   He told Julie that 

 he&apos;d been hurt by a lot of girls and that he couldn&apos;t risk seeing her 

 anymore.   This was, of course, a challenge to the teenager, who 

 thought that she could make it up to him.   That he was an older man 

 only made him seem more desirable.   Julie went out with him one night 

 a few weeks later.   She wasn&apos;t used to hard liquor, and she became 

 intoxicated.   They returned to the town house where Julie lived with 

 her mother.   Her mother was not home that night, but they were 

 chaperoned by one of Julie&apos;s girlfriends. 

   

 To Randy&apos;s disappointment, the girls slept together, and he had to 

 sleep in Julie&apos;s mother&apos;s room.   In the morning he pranced into the 

 girls&apos; bedroom wearing only his bikini underpants and crawled into 

 bed with them.   He fondled Julie a little, but he quit when she told 

 him he had to. 

   

 The pretty teenager continued to be fascinated with Randy--until she 

 found out that he was a liar.   Julie, naively believing she was 

 comforting a man who&apos;d been hurt badly by women, had been furious 

 when she ran into him in a bar named Euphoria. 

   

 Randy, of course, hadn&apos;t been bereft of female companionship; he was 

 living with Lucy Grant.   And Lucy was with him when Julie spied him 

 at the Euphoria. 

   

 Julie became almost hysterical and called him an &quot;asshole&quot; for lying 

 to her.   And then she started to cry and ran out of the bar. 

   

 But after that Julie thought about Randy Woodfield, this handsome man 

 thirteen years older than she was.   When she saw him again, she 

 apologized for screaming at him at the Euphoria.   She told a friend 

 later that she expected him to call her, saying that they had 

 worked out all the misunderstandings they&apos;d had.   &quot;We&apos;ve agreed just 

 to be friends.&quot; 

   

 Randy and Lucy Grant broke up in the fall of 1980, but not because of 

 Julie Reitz; Lucy didn&apos;t even know about Julie.   It may have been 

 that Randy finally had enough of Lucy&apos;s young male friends; it may 

 have been something else.   Whatever caused the rift, his relationship 

 with Lucy Grant disintegrated into petty quarrels.   When Lucy 

 explained to him that she thought she should date other men, Randy 

 was devastated.   She had turned out to be just like Sharon, his love 

 at Treasure Valley, who had betrayed him, just like Moira, just like 

 the woman who worked at the bank.   None of them really cared about 

 him. 

   

 Lucy was so anxious to move out that, as she laughingly told friends, 

 she had forgotten to unplug the water-bed heater.   The water bed 

 melted, and Randy threatened to sue her.   Lucy responded by telling 

 Randy she was going to bring him into court to demand her share of 

 the rental deposit.   He countered with a scrupulously polite letter 

 saying that she would get her money- minus any utilities owed.   He 

 told her he had gone to a lawyer over the matter. 

   

 Whereas Randy had shown overt anger when Sharon and the other women 

 had rejected him, he had now learned to mask his anguish; he would 

 not let Lucy see what she had done to him.   But her defection only 

 solidified his feeling that women were not to be trusted, that they 

 would only pretend to love him and then betray him with other men. 

   

 Tim Rossi, Randy&apos;s best friend and former roommate, had suffered a 

 similar blow.   When Tim had moved from Portland up to Tacoma to 

 accept an assistant professorship at Pacific Lutheran University, it 

 had strained his relationship with his steady woman, Darci Fix. 

 Darci had told Tim that she had found someone else.   The young 

 professor took the breakup well, and he had remained on friendly 

 terms with Darci. 

   

 Tim told Randy that he and Darci had broken up when Randy visited him 

 in Tacoma on October 11, 1980.   It was not a propitious visit; Tim 

 found that Randy had changed radically since they&apos;d known each other 

 at Portland State, since they&apos;d shared an apartment after they left 

 college.   The pious, gentle young athlete had disappeared, and in his 

 place Tim saw a swinger, a man who talked incessantly about women and 

 bars.   Randy was furious with Darci Fix for breaking up with his 

 longtime friend, almost as angry as if she had left him. 

   

 Darci had only weeks to enjoy her new love; on November 27, 1981, 

 Thanksgiving Day--the bodies of Darci and her new boyfriend, Doug 

 Altic, were found in Darci&apos;s Portland apartment.   They had been shot, 

 execution style.   Tim learned about Darci&apos;s death the day after the 

 double murder in a phone call from Randy. 

   

 Tim was shocked speechless; he had visited Darci and Doug on November 

 25, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, and everything had been normal 

 then.   In talking with Portland police detectives, Tim asked if Darci 

 had a chance to use her gun to protect herself. 

   

 The response was, &quot;What gun?&quot; 

   

 Tim said that Darci had a small handgun when he lived with her.   Her 

 father, a physician, had given it to her for protection.   In fact, 

 Tim had seen the gun on November 25. 

   

 &quot;It was lying on the floor next to her bed, a silver gun with a white 

 handle.   It had a short barrel.   I don&apos;t know much about guns, so I 

 couldn&apos;t tell you the caliber.&quot; 

   

 Darci&apos;s father told detectives that it had been an old .32 chrome 

 revolver, so old that it had never been registered.   He would not be 

 able to identify it if it were found--except by appearance. 

   

 The gun was missing from the apartment when Portland detectives 

 inventoried the contents, although nothing else was missing.   They 

 turned the place upside down trying to find it, but it simply wasn&apos;t 

 there. 

   

 The murder of Darci Fix and Doug Altic has never been solved, nor has 

 the missing gun ever surfaced. 

   

 Moira Bandon (Randy&apos;s first live-in lover, whom he had met on the 

 freeway) saw the newspaper articles about Darci&apos;s murder and called 

 Randy to tell him that Darci had been killed.   She located him at his 

 sister&apos;s home in Portland, where he had moved after breaking up with 

 Lucy Grant.   Moira was puzzled at the flatness of Randy&apos;s response to 

 the shocking news.   He seemed to accept it without any emotion at 

 all.   She might have been giving him a weather report for all the 

 shock he showed at the news. 

   

 Darci was not the first among Randy&apos;s female acquaintances to be 

 murdered in the fall of 1980.   Cherie Ayers, who had graduated from 

 Newport High with Randy in the class of 1969, was raped and killed in 

 Portland on October 10 sometime before midnight.   Cherie had worked 

 with Randy on the class reunion held right after his release from the 

 Oregon State Penitentiary.   A brilliant, pretty woman, she had 

 attended Oregon State University in Corvallis and then the University 

 of Oregon Medical School.   She was working in Portland as a 

 radiologic technologist at the time of her death. 

   

 Portland Police Detective Bob Dornay investigated the murder of 

 Cherie Ayers.   It was a particularly ugly homicide; Cherie had been 

 bludgeoned on the head and then stabbed repeatedly in the neck.   In 

 checking through a list of Cherie&apos;s friends, Dornay discovered that 

 Randy Woodfield had visited Cherie many times at her home on S.W. 

 9th Place in Portland when he moved to Portland after being paroled. 

 Given Randy&apos;s prison record, he was questioned closely during the 

 murder probe.   Dornay found Randy&apos;s answers about his whereabouts 

 during the vital time period evasive and deceptive.   He asked Randy 

 to take a polygraph examination, but Randy refused to submit to a lie 

 detector. 

   

 The Ayers crime scene had given up little physical evidence.   There 

 were secretions found in the young radiologist&apos;s vaginal vault, but 

 no alien pubic hairs were detected.   Dornay obtained Randy 

 Woodfield&apos;s blood type from records at the state penitentiary: B 

 negative.   Analysis of the secretions in the victim&apos;s vagina 

 indicated that they had not come from a B-negative secretor. 

 Although Dornay was not entirely convinced that Randy had no 

 connection with Cherie&apos;s murder, he was eliminated as a suspect. 

 Still, there was always the possibility that the secretions might 

 have come from an earlier sex act with another male, or might even 

 have been the victim&apos;s own vaginal moisture. 

   

 At any rate, despite Dornay&apos;s gut feelings about Randy&apos;s involvement, 

 there was not enough physical evidence to charge him with Cherie 

 Ayers&apos; murder.   Her murder has not been solved at this writing. 

   

 It seemed odd that Randy had been closely associated with two women 

 who had been murdered in the space of six weeks, so close that 

 detectives had questioned him intensively in each case.   Possible 

 within the parameters of the law of averages...but odd. 

   

 Randy continued to be consumed with his pursuit of women.   Although 

 he complained that women had done him wrong, it did not occur to him 

 that he had been far from a constant lover.   In his mind, the fault 

 always fell on the female&apos;s shoulders. 

   

 After a spate of recriminations and bitterness, Randy adjusted to 

 losing Lucy Grant.   He plunged into promiscuity.   His hobby, his 

 avocation, his passion, was women.   He &quot;hit on&quot; almost every young 

 woman he encountered.   He was clumsy and transparent in his 

 approaches, but by the sheer law of averages he scored with a lot of 

 them. 

   

 Randy Woodfield had a grossly distorted view of the male- female 

 relationship.   When it came to women, his greediness verged on 

 obsession.   He was like a starving man let loose in a bakery, a man 

 who snatched at everything he saw, taking one bite of every delicacy 

 and then throwing it away before he could savor it.   If one woman was 

 good, two were better.   If two made him feel safe, then three...or 

 five...or a dozen might possibly fill his yawning need for feminine 

 acceptance.   Once he had made some contact with a woman, however 

 tentative, he wanted to keep her in his stable.   He bombarded her 

 with calls and clever cards and drop-in visits to be sure that she 

 remembered him and considered him important.   He used the telephone 

 compulsively, running up huge long-distance bills.   That was 

 necessary to ensure that all of his women remembered him.   He often 

 called late at night to remind them that he was thinking of them. 

   

 His frenetic campaigns didn&apos;t always work.   Randy approached three 

 kinds of women.   Women near his own age saw through him immediately; 

 they found him a shallow, odd phony and refused even to give him 

 their phone numbers.   Women a bit younger and less worldly found him, 

 initially, rather attractive, but on closer inspection there was 

 something about him that frightened them, and they refused his 

 further attentions.   Only the younger girls, like Julie Reitz, or the 

 truly naive fell for his line of patter and professions of undying 

 love. 

   

 Randy stalked most of his quarries in bars, the kind of bars where 

 young singles gather, where both sexes are looking for that one true 

 love.   He was a handsome man; no one would argue that.   His hair was 

 permed to a thicket of dark curls, his mustache was neat and 

 luxuriant, his eyelashes were so long that they just missed seeming 

 feminine, and his muscles rippled.   His only flaw was the scarring 

 that remained from his teenage acne. 

   

 Randy dressed for his prowls in designer jeans and plaid shirts open 

 almost to the waist to reveal his broad hairy chest.   He wore the de 

 rigueur gold chain and pendant, and boots with heels that made him 

 even taller than his six-feet-two.   His voice was deep and soft, and 

 he never was disrespectful.   He asked women to dance, and he bought 

 them drinks.   He referred to his &quot;sad childhood&quot; and suggested that 

 his life had been one of tragedy. 

   

 He &quot;fell in love&quot; instantly, fixing all his attentions on each 

 woman he approached.   If he was rejected, he moved quickly to the 

 woman sitting on the next bar stool.   But he pushed too hard for 

 intimacy.   He held their hands at the bar, and he tried to kiss. 

 them.   He moved from &quot;What&apos;s your name?&quot;   to &quot;I think we could fall 

 in love&quot; in a matter of minutes.   He begged to be allowed to go home 

 with his choices that very night.   He would only sleep on their 

 couches, he promised. 

   

 Randy&apos;s approach to women was so frenzied that he turned most of them 

 off, and they rolled their eyes at each other when he wasn&apos;t looking 

 and called him a &quot;weirdo&quot; in giggling whispers.   He skipped vital 

 steps in forming relationships; his greediness showed.   Just as 

 men, even in the sexual revolution of the eighties, find little value 

 in a woman who is too easy, even marginally sophisticated females 

 found Randy as transparent as a male dog in rut.   And they turned 

 their backs on him.   Sure, he was a handsome hunk, but they were 

 looking for something more than that. 

   

 Randy failed to see why women rejected him.   He blamed the women.   He 

 felt that they were always standing him up.   It never occurred to him 

 that he had hounded the &quot;no-shows&quot; until they had agreed to &quot;dates&quot; 

 that &apos;were not really dates, but half- promises born out of 

 desperation. 

   

 Still, enough of them did accept dates with him, and he gathered 

 his successes into his life and into his address book as if he were 

 picking up diamonds with both hands.   He had no ethics at all, no 

 compunction about lying to women.   He was only treating them as they 

 deserved to be treated.   When they refused him, he never let his 

 anxiety show.   He held it in.   His anger grew, but he somehow knew 

 that he would ultimately have his vengeance. 

   

 Randy Woodfield, for all of his outward glamour, was terrified of 

 women.   Behind the brash facade there was a shadow man, and he dared 

 not let that man show.   Despite his protestations otherwise, he saw 

 himself as a wimp; the muscled man he saw in the mirror warred with 

 the image he held inwardly. 

   

 As 1980 wound down, Randy thought seriously about leaving Portland. 

 He had many reasons to feel uneasy about staying in the Portland 

 area.   He had been questioned about Cherie Ayers&apos; murder, and even 

 though nothing had come of it, the fact that the Portland police had 

 homed in on him made him edgy. 

   

 Randy was far from the innocent lamb.   He had been engaged in 

 criminal activities.   He liked to operate from a strong financial 

 base, and he couldn&apos;t seem to find a job that paid more than the 

 minimum wages offered at convenience markets and fast-food outlets. 

 The solution was simple.   He had contacted one of his old prison 

 buddies, Tony Niri.   The two joined up for some robberies.   The 

 Faucet Tavern first, and then a Safeway store in Vancouver, 

 Washington, among others. 

   

 Niri was con-wise, and he&apos;d instructed Randy on a simple but 

 effective disguise.   All one had to do was to plaster several strips 

 of tape across the bridge of the nose, and no witness would be able 

 to describe him afterward.   Randy improved on that by gluing on a 

 fake beard he&apos;d bought at a novelty shop.   Niri carried a .357 magnum 

 during the robberies, but Randy made do with a toy gun.   After the 

 heists, Randy unpeeled the tape and the beard and hid them in his 

 backpack or in his sports gloves.   Sometimes they used Randy&apos;s car, a 

 &quot;Champagne Edition&quot; gold Volkswagen Bug--but that was a fairly 

 memorable car, so they usually used Niri&apos;s. 

   

 Nobody beyond Niri had any idea that Randy was involved in thefts. 

   

 Still, Portland hadn&apos;t been very lucky for him.   There were all of 

 his blighted liaisons with women, and all of the jobs he&apos;d lost.   He 

 planned to move south, seventy miles south, to Eugene.   He did not 

 plan to inform his parole officer until the move was made.   And 

 perhaps not even then. 

   

 Randy had another friend from his days in the penitentiary: 

 Ralph Wansee.   Ralph had moved to Los Angeles after his parole, but 

 he had family in Medford, Oregon, and the two men made plans to meet 

 in Medford for the 1980 Christmas holiday. 

   

 Randy flew into Medford Christmas morning, and the two men spent 

 Christmas Day with Ralph&apos;s mother and stepfather.   The next day Randy 

 suggested that they go out bar-hopping and looking for women.   Ralph 

 agreed, although he was far from the ladies&apos; man Randy purported to 

 be; Ralph had a harelip, which made him shy around women, fearful of 

 rejection.   Randy assured him that he had charisma enough for the two 

 of them. 

   

 And indeed he did.   On December 26, Randy&apos;s thirtieth birthday, he 

 managed to pick up not two women for them, but four.   They were in 

 the Bonanza Room of the Sandpiper when Randy brought the first set of 

 women over to the table.   Denise LeNoir was a pretty divorcee from 

 Ashland, Oregon, out for the evening after hiring a baby-sitter for 

 her youngsters.   Denise found Randy very attractive, although her 

 friend was not as taken with Ralph.   The men wanted to party 

 throughout the night, and Denise explained that she had to get home. 

 She did give Randy her phone number, and he promised to call. 

   

 Randy told Ralph not to worry.   A short time later, he hit on a pair 

 of beautiful sisters.   Lynette Lacey lived right there in Medford, 

 and her sister, Rose, had come up from North Hollywood to visit over 

 Christmas.   Ralph and Rose found common ground, since they both lived 

 in the Los Angeles area, and Lynette initially thought Randy 

 Woodfield was something special.   They spent the rest of the evening 

 together and made a date for the next night: 

 Saturday, December 27. 

   

 They met again at the Sandpiper and then Lynette and Randy had drinks 

 at her house.   Later they drove to Maxi&apos;s at the Red Lion to meet 

 Rose and Ralph. 

   

 During their second evening together, Lynette began to think she&apos;d 

 made an error in judgment.   For one thing, her date had announced 

 loudly to the cocktail lounge that he was looking for cocaine to buy. 

 For another, Randy did not wear well; he was as insistent and pushy 

 as an oversexed teenage boy.   He suggested that he stay overnight 

 with her.   When she demurred, he argued that that was the only way 

 they could really get to know each other. 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; she said. 

   

 &quot;You should want that.   There&apos;s got to be something the matter with 

 you not to,&quot; Randy argued. 

   

 She looked at the dark man and thought that she&apos;d been a fool; she 

 was sorry she&apos;d even kissed him.   He was coming on so strong, with no 

 encouragement at all from her.   As far as she was concerned, the 

 relationship was over before it began.   Despite his protestations 

 that she must be frigid or neurotic, she sent him away. 

   

 Before dawn on Sunday morning, both Denise and Lynette heard from 

 Randy Woodfield.   Denise was surprised to hear from him at five A.M., 

 and more than a little annoyed because he expected her to drive from 

 Ashland to the Medford airport and pick him up.   His plane was fogged 

 in, and he needed a ride to Portland.   She explained that her babies 

 were sleeping and she didn&apos;t want to wake them. 

   

 &quot;Leave them there,&quot; he said. 

   

 Naturally, her answer was no.   She wondered that a man she&apos;d met so 

 briefly would expect so much from her. 

   

 Randy called Lynette next to say he was burned out from partying for 

 three straight days and now he&apos;d just missed his plane to boot.   He 

 was at the bus station, and he hinted that he&apos;d like to spend the day 

 with her.   Lynette wasn&apos;t interested.   She made small talk and hung 

 up. 

   

 But both women&apos;s phone numbers went into Randy&apos;s thick little 

 black book.   He was particularly interested in Lynette.   He wrote to 

 her several times, apparently oblivious of the brush-off she&apos;d given 

 him. 

   

 &quot;If we are meant to be together, it will happen,&quot; he wrote.   &quot;The 

 stars just weren&apos;t right the night we were together.&quot; 

   

 She was a little bemused at his bland assumption that she was still 

 interested in him.   She did not know, of course, that Randy sent 

 letters like that to dozens of women, that he might just as well 

 have had them run off by the gross on a copy machine. 

   

 He kept writing to her, and after a while she responded.   He was very 

 expressive in his letters.   She thought maybe she&apos;d misjudged him, 

 and even toyed with the idea that she might visit him some weekend in 

 Portland. 

   

 Neither Denise nor Lynette really expected to date Randy Woodfield 

 again, but they had not seen the last of him, and his contacts with 

 them would one day soon prove to be most unlucky for him. 

   

 Randy Woodfield had claimed to want just one woman, a devoted woman 

 who could be loyal to him.   He had told his prison counselors that he 

 longed only to find a good woman, marry her, raise a family, and that 

 together they would work to help others.   He had bemoaned the loss of 

 several &quot;special women,&quot; wondering why he was Initially or ultimately 

 rejected. 

   

 Two days after he struck out with the women in Medford, Randy was 

 trolling again.   He was staying temporarily at the New -Oregon Motel 

 in Eugene on December 30, 1980, while he searched out housing 

 possibilities in that city. 

   

 Shelley Janson was spending the Christmas holidays at her father&apos;s 

 house in Eugene, home from college in New Mexico.   On December 30, 

 Shelley was four days away from her twenty-second birthday.   She was 

 a highly intelligent young woman; she maintained a four-point GPA at 

 the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.   She was also very, very 

 beautiful.   But Shelley Janson approached life and the possibility of 

 romance with surprising naivetee.   Despite several disappointing love 

 affairs, Shelley still believed in the &quot;knight on a white horse.&quot;   At 

 some point, the perfect man would come along, and she knew she would 

 recognize him the moment she saw him.   He would be tall and dark and 

 soft-spoken, sensitive just as she was.   They would touch hands, and 

 talk, and fall in love, to live happily ever after.   Fate or karma 

 would take care of that. 

   

 Shelley&apos;s karma led her on the night of December 30, 1980, to 

 O&apos;Callahan&apos;s in Eugene.   She went there with a girlfriend to check 

 out the possibilities of New Year&apos;s Eve parties the next night. 

   

 Shelley and her friend had stood on the edge of the dance floor for 

 only five or ten minutes when a handsome man with curly dark hair 

 approached them.   &quot;Excuse me.&quot;   He smiled.   &quot;I think I left my drink 

 on the ledge behind you.&quot; 

   

 Shelley turned and saw a man who fit her specifications for the 

 &quot;white knight&quot; exactly.   She was afraid he would go away, so she 

 initiated a conversation to keep him at her side.   He seemed to 

 respond to her, and she was thrilled. 

   

 His name was Randall, he said, and he was from Portland, but he was 

 planning to move to Eugene.   He said he&apos;d just celebrated his 

 thirtieth birthday, and she laughed; he looked only about 

 twenty-five.   She demanded to see his driver&apos;s license, and saw that 

 he had been born in 1950. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m a Capricorn too,&quot; she said.   &quot;I&apos;ll be twenty-two this Saturday.&quot; 

  

 She was happy that they had something in common.   Randall explained 

 that he planned to attend the University of Oregon in the spring and 

 that he&apos;d be taking courses at Lane Community College in the interim. 

 He was going to complete two degrees, one in business and one in 

 health and physical education.   She was impressed when he said he 

 planned to find a job bartending and save all his money for his 

 education.   The man was clearly going places, and prepared to work 

 hard to finish his education. 

   

 They danced only two dances that first evening; they were too busy 

 talking.   And the conversation was heavy, not the usual singles-bar 

 stuff.   Randall talked to her about his desires for the future, 

 family, goals, morals.   His voice was deep--but soft, and he looked 

 right into her eyes with his burning gaze.   He told her 

 about a woman in Medford who had refused him, and said he&apos;d just 

 &quot;walked away.&quot;   He would not force himself on a woman who didn&apos;t want 

 him.   She felt a little jealous, even though that had happened before 

 she&apos;d met him.   But he assured her he cared nothing for the other 

 woman. 

   

 Shelley felt like pinching herself to see if it was all real. 

   

 She regretted only that she had to go back to Albuquerque in three 

 days.   They were obviously so right for each other, and Randall was 

 already suggesting that they might want to get seriously involved. 

 Shelley had no way of knowing, of course, that Randall always came on 

 this strong, that he suggested solid commitment to almost every woman 

 he met.   She was already falling in love.   The hours flew by, and she 

 was amazed when two A.M.   came and the bar closed.   Her friend tugged 

 on her sleeve and whispered, &quot;It&apos;s nice to see you so happy again. 

 I&apos;m going to leave you here with him.&quot; 

   

 Randall walked Shelley to his car and they stood in the winter chill 

 in the parking lot until it was almost empty.   &quot;We were shocked,&quot; 

 Shelley recalled to detectives later, &quot;to have those incredible 

 feelings so quickly.   We just stood there talking about our feelings.&quot; 

   

 Finally they got into Randall&apos;s car, his Champagne Edition gold 

 Volkswagen.   When he kissed her, it felt right, and it didn&apos;t seem to 

 matter that she&apos;d known him only a few hours.   They talked and 

 kissed, and she finally asked him to take her to her friend&apos;s house 

 because she&apos;d left her purse in her friend&apos;s car.   The plan was that 

 he would then take her home to her father&apos;s house. 

   

 Shelley never went home that first night.   Halfway to her dad&apos;s 

 house, they mutually agreed that they would go, instead, to Randall&apos;s 

 room at the New Oregon Motel.   She stayed with him all night.   He was 

 very considerate of her.   He suggested that it might be too soon for 

 intercourse; he asked only for oral sex.   She didn&apos;t know that 

 fellatio was his principal sexual focus, that it always had been. 

   

 They spent the day of New Year&apos;s Eve visiting her family in Eugene. 

 Randall told her he had arranged to rent a room from a divorced woman 

 who lived with her young son, and Shelley went with him to Arden 

 Bate&apos;s home on E Street in Springfield, just east of Eugene, where 

 Randall gave Ms. Bates a check for his first month&apos;s rent. 

   

 Shelley hated to spend New Year&apos;s Eve without Randall, but he 

 explained he had previous plans to meet friends in Portland and go to 

 a &quot;forties costume party.&quot;   She went to a party in Eugene, but she 

 thought about nothing but Randall.   He was too good to be true. 

   

 On New Year&apos;s Day, 1981, Shelley called Randall at his sister&apos;s home 

 in Portland and told him that a friend of hers was coming up to 

 Portland and that she could come along.   He welcomed the suggestion 

 and picked her up and took her out to TGI Friday.   Providentially, 

 Randall&apos;s sister was with their parents in Otter Rock, so the new 

 lovers had another night together. 

   

 Shelley could hardly bear to get on a plane the next morning and fly 

 back to New Mexico.   But it was too soon for her to abandon college. 

 Still, she knew they would be together again.   She wished only that 

 she hadn&apos;t forgotten the stuffed panda bear that Randall had bought 

 her. 

   

 She wrote to Randall constantly, scribbling across the blank spaces 

 of romantic cards.   Her letters referred continually to how 

 &quot;exciting&quot; Randall was.   She vowed to enter a 

 program so that she would be worthy of a man with so much athletic 

 ability.   She suggested plans that would let them meet again.   She 

 worried that most men might think she was coming on too strong, but 

 Randall&apos;s letters to her were full of his affirmation of her plans. 

 She had been dumped on by men before, and she was frightened.   But 

 not frightened enough to hold back on her confidences to him.   She 

 signed her letters &quot;Your lover always,&quot; and each communique was more 

 affectionate than the last. 

   

 Randall called her often, and he sent cards and letters too.   He 

 encouraged her commitment to him.   She wrote that she was proud of 

 him for searching for a job so diligently, and assured him that she 

 would always be there for him if he ever became discouraged.   No man 

 could ask for more.   A beautiful, intelligent, faithful woman loved 

 Randall Woodfield. 

   

 &quot;By the way, I Love you!&quot;   she wrote.   &quot;I feel so lucky to have you 

 in my life.   I hope you are always there with me...I have been 

 looking for someone like you all my life--and now I&apos;ve found you. 

 Thanks for walking into my life, Randall.&quot; 

   

 The lovers were not separated long, although it seemed forever to 

 Shelley.   On January 30, 1981, Shelley flew into San Francisco to 

 wait for Randall--who was driving down the coast to meet her.   It was 

 an idyllic three days.   They spent the first night at the Hilton next 

 to the airport, and then went to a cheaper motel in San Bruno to 

 spend Saturday and Sunday night.   They called it their &quot;Love Boat&quot; 

 weekend.   They went to Fisherman&apos;s Wharf.   Randall wanted to visit 

 Alcatraz, and they toured the island prison for a couple of hours. 

 They were typical tourists, two young people in love.   Shelley was a 

 little put off when they never engaged in normal intercourse, but she 

 was so in love with Randall that she thought that would happen all in 

 good time.   Perhaps he had her on a pedestal, and felt that oral sex 

 was all that they should do until they were married. 

   

 And they would be married.   She was sure of that.   On Saturday 

 morning Randall bared his soul to her.   He told her that he had been 

 in prison and that he was on parole.   He told her about his days with 

 the Green Bay Packers and about his disappointment when it was over. 

 Her shock about his criminal record dissipated rapidly; it was 

 something from the past, and she knew that it would never happen 

 again.   And then he proposed to her.   She said yes at once.   They 

 didn&apos;t set a date, but they discussed a late-summer wedding, or 

 perhaps a Christmas wedding.   They would definitely be married by 

 Valentine&apos;s Day 1982.   Randall called his friend Ralph in Los Angeles 

 and asked him to be the best man.   He called his parents in Otter 

 Rock and told them he was engaged to be married. 

   

 After such a perfect weekend, Shelley hated to leave to fly back to 

 New Mexico, but she had to wind things up at the university.   All in 

 all, the weekend had turned out better than she could ever have 

 imagined.   She&apos;d known Randall for only a month, and now they were 

 engaged.   He took her to her plane and told her he would be driving 

 back to Eugene up the I-5 freeway so that he could stop off at his 

 sister Susan&apos;s home in Mt.   Shasta and tell her the news about the 

 wedding. 

   

 Shelley was home in Albuquerque by ten that Monday evening, February 

 2.   Randall called her collect at midnight and told her he was only 

 an hour and a half away from his sister&apos;s house.   He would talk to 

 her soon. 

   

 When Randall hadn&apos;t called her again by Wednesday, February 4, she 

 tried to reach him in Eugene.   He wasn&apos;t there.   She was frightened 

 and thought he might have been in an accident.   She kept calling 

 throughout the night, and she finally reached him on Thursday morning. 

   

 Randy said he&apos;d had a pleasant visit with his sister, her physician 

 husband, and their children, which was true; he had stopped to spend 

 a short time in Mt.   Shasta.   As far as any trouble on the road, all 

 that had happened, he said, was that he had gotten a ticket for 

 speeding on the way home, and he thought he would buy a radar 

 detector.   Shelley didn&apos;t ask him 

 why it had taken him two whole days to get home; she assumed he&apos;d 

 spent the time visiting his sister.   He didn&apos;t actually say he had, 

 but that seemed the likeliest explanation for his delay in calling 

 her. 

   

 After the San francisco weekend, Shelley&apos;s studies disintegrated; all 

 she could think about was being with Randall.   He called her every 

 other day, or she called him.   It wasn&apos;t enough.   She couldn&apos;t bear 

 the thought of Randall all alone in Eugene, discouraged about his 

 lack of a job, and herself, just as lonesome, wasting time in New 

 Mexico. 

   

 It helped a little when Randall sent her a dozen yellow roses on 

 Valentine&apos;s Day.   She put them in a vase where she could look at them 

 when she wrote to him.   &quot;I feel like I&apos;ve just begun on a very happy 

 trail through life.   Thanks!&quot; 

   

 Shelley didn&apos;t know that Randy had remembered a dozen or more women 

 for Valentine&apos;s Day, that each message was intimate, suggesting that 

 a further relationship seemed almost a certainty.   She had no idea 

 how many women waited for a call from Randy. 

   

 Randy Woodfield was very thoughtful that Valentine&apos;s Day.   He also 

 sent an arrangement of red roses and white carnations to his parents, 

 who were celebrating their thirty-fourth wedding anniversary.   The 

 flowers reached them in Reno, the first stop on an extended trip that 

 would take them to Tokyo.   His mother was especially touched by the 

 gesture.   They had been through much grief over Randy, and now it 

 seemed that things were going to be all right after all.   He was 

 engaged to a fine young woman and talking enthusiastically about 

 finishing his college degree at the University of Oregon.   In the 

 meantime, he had enrolled in a bartending school in Portland which 

 he would attend sporadically, even though he now lived in Eugene. 

   

 The Woodfields flew off to Tokyo with Randy&apos;s flowers carefully 

 packed in damp paper, assured that all was well. 

   

 No one seemed to wonder that Randy could afford to send seventy-five 

 dollars&apos; worth of yellow roses to his fiancee and an expensive floral 

 arrangement, plus champagne, to his parents even though he had no job 

 and had had no employment for some time. 

   

 By the end of February, Shelley Janson missed her fiance so much that 

 she called him in tears.   They agreed that they had to be together, 

 and Shelley made plans to withdraw from school on February 24, pack 

 her belongings, and drive to Eugene. 

   

 Shelley actually headed north on March 4, but when she got to Eugene, 

 her world and everything she&apos;d hoped for in the future had shattered 

 into a million pieces.

 Dave Kominek and Monty Holloway had received the information from 

 Shasta County, California, that indicated that a suspect who sounded 

 just like their suspect had struck in California along the I-5 

 freeway from january 28 to February 4, 1981.   They also received 

 copies of almost identical case reports from agencies ranging from 

 Eugene, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, and its suburbs.   That meant 

 that they probably were tracking a man whose geographical parameters 

 included eight hundred miles of freeway, vast stretches of fast roads 

 that allowed him to attack and be long gone by the time police were 

 called.   He had killed at least three times already.   He had raped 

 most of his victims. 

   

 And nobody knew who he was.   But he had a nickname now: 

   

 he was the &quot;I-5 Killer.&quot; 

   

 Kominek was sure that the same man had used his silver gun on Shari 

 Hull and Beth Wilmot in Salem after the attack on Merrisue and Megan 

 Green in Corvallis.   Perhaps his crimes against the Green children 

 bothered him.   Perhaps he was tired after &quot;working&quot; night after night 

 all along the freeway.   Four days had passed between the Corvallis 

 incident and the carnage in the TransAmerica Building in Salem. 

   

 Corvallis police never located the missing phone receiver.   They had 

 found that someone had deliberately unscrewed the porch light on the 

 Greens&apos; front porch, and they tried to lift fingerprints from the 

 bulb, but found only smudged glove prints. 

   

 There was no respite at all after Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot were 

 shot; indeed, the next report in sequence had come in from Vancouver 

 again.   At seven-thirty on Monday, January 19 (as Beth lay under 

 heavy guard in Salem Memorial Hospital), the man with the curly dark 

 hair, the regulation false beard, and ski gloves robbed the Vancouver 

 Skating Rink.   The rink office was deserted except for the female 

 cashier, seventeen, and three boys ten and eleven years old, one of 

 whom had come to the rink that night to celebrate his birthday. 

   

 The man held out a silver gun, demanded the money In the cash 

 register, and left after warning the cashier and the boys not to 

 watch where he was going. 

   

 On January 26 he robbed the Dari Mart in Eugene at eight-fifteen in 

 the evening.   Again, he used Band-Aids over his nose.   The 

 twenty-three-year-old female clerk said he&apos;d worn a brown corduroy or 

 suede jacket with a hood and sheepskin lining.   Again, no one saw a 

 car. 

   

 Kominek turned to Holloway.   &quot;That&apos;s the pattern so far, it&apos;s quiet 

 from here to Eugene after January 26.   But it looks like that&apos;s 

 because he was in California for the next several days.   Almost two 

 dozen cases that have to be the same man.   There may be more that we 

 don&apos;t even know about yet.   What do we do 

 now?   Plant a stakeout in every fast-food spot between Canada and 

 Mexico?   If anybody had that much manpower, we might stumble onto 

 him in a year or so.   He&apos;s killed already; he&apos;s not liable to stop.&quot; 

   

 District Attorney Chris Van Dyke agreed that the time had come to 

 coordinate the investigation in person with the California 

 investigators.   On February 6 Van Dyke, Kominek, and Holloway 

 chartered a private plane and flew to Medford.   There they met with 

 detectives from the Shasta County Sheriff&apos;s the Redding Police 

 Department, the Yreka Police Department, and the Ashland, Medford, 

 and Grants Pass police department.   Chris Van Dyke and the Marion 

 County detectives presented facts of the cases that they had come up 

 with.   And then Shasta County investigators discussed their cases. 

 They had conferred with the police north of them.   There were more 

 incidents to discuss. 

   

 The Shasta County investigators presented the information they had 

 gathered that seemed surely to be the violent hand of the same 

 suspect.   The cluster of attacks in California and southern Oregon 

 had occurred in a time frame that looked like a man who was an 

 insatiable sex prowler.   Sergeant Rusty Brewer and investigator Ron 

 Kingsley described attacks that were like C-B copies of those Kominek 

 had received from Washington and northern Oregon.   They went over the 

 Eckard-Jarvis murders again for the benefit of the group. 

   

 Donna Eckard and Janell Jarvis had been alive at six p.M.   February 3 

 (when Kristin talked with her mother on the phone, and their bodies 

 were still warm at nine P.M.   (when Kristin discovered the murders). 

   

 &quot;Now it looks like that wasn&apos;t the first hit on the third,&quot; Rusty 

 Brewer said. 

   

 It seemed impossible, but the Shasta County sergeant said they had 

 found another case on February 3 whose M.O.   was almost identical. 

 Earlier on the same night, a woman and a teenager working at the 

 Burger Express restaurant in Redding had suffered an ordeal at the 

 hands of an unknown suspect. 

   

 Marie Sloane, forty-six, owner of the Burger Express, was in the 

 kitchen, and Lia Morris, eighteen, was at the front counter when a 

 man with dark wavy hair walked in.   He was over six feet tall and 

 wore a wool cap, a windbreaker, faded jeans, and expensive jogging 

 shoes.   His hands were concealed by blue gloves with gray trim.   Lia 

 Morris looked up to take his order and saw that he was pointing a 

 silver revolver at her.   The man placed himself in a position where 

 he could watch both women, and then he turned to Mrs. Sloane. 

   

 &quot;Sit down, and you won&apos;t get hurt,&quot; he ordered. 

   

 Mrs.   Sloane instructed Lia to get the money out of the cash 

 register.   The girl complied and handed it to the gunman. 

   

 He told Mrs. Sloane to lead him, with Lia in tow, to the bathroom. 

 She obeyed, and the man told the shop owner to kneel down on top of 

 the toilet.   He taped her hands behind her back and then taped her 

 ankles together.   When she was helpless, he taped her mouth shut with 

 a broad strip of tape.   And then he turned to Lia and barked, &quot;Take 

 your clothes off.&quot; 

   

 While he was waiting for the teenager to remove her clothes, the 

 gunman fondled Mrs. Sloane&apos;s breast, but went no further.   He was 

 waiting for Lia.   Then he ordered Mrs. Sloane to get off the stool 

 and face the door.   When she said she couldn&apos;t move, he helped her to 

 the floor and warned her to keep her face toward the door. 

   

 In the tight confines of the restroom, the intruder then turned to 

 Lia Morris.   The girl sobbed, terrified, but there was nothing her 

 employer could do to help her.   The gunman forced the girl to fellate 

 him, but he did not ejaculate.   He pushed her to the floor facedown 

 and attempted anal sodomy.   Still not satisfied, he demanded oral sex 

 again.   Finally he climaxed. 

   

 Finished with his victims for the moment, he fastened his clothes. 

 They thought he was going to shoot them, but, providentially, Mrs. 

 Sloane&apos;s husband stopped by the burger shop to check on her.   She 

 heard him outside the bathroom door, 

 pushing against it, and then the man with the gun calmly saying, 

 &quot;It&apos;s busy.&quot; 

   

 Their captor opened the door and held the gun on her husband, forcing 

 him into the bathroom.   But he did not shoot them; they could hear 

 his steps running away. 

   

 The women had come very close to death, but they were lucky.   Lia 

 Morris was taken to a hospital for treatment, and the Sloanes 

 estimated their loss at two hundred and thirty dollars. 

   

 Within the next hour, someone shod and killed half of the Eckard 

 family in Mountain Gate, Less than ten miles away. 

   

 Yreka, California, is seventy miles north on the I-5, located on the 

 other side of the Shasta National Forest, twenty miles south of the 

 Oregon border.   Almost exactly twenty-four hours after Donna Eckard 

 and Janell Jarvis had been shot to death, Jessie Clovis, twenty-one, 

 got into her Maverick after buying cigarettes at a liquor store in 

 the north end of Yreka.   She was about to start the car&apos;s engine when 

 a man who looked to be in his mid-twenties suddenly opened the 

 driver&apos;s-side door.   She whirled, surprised, and saw a dark man who 

 wore a green down jacket. 

   

 &quot;Move over,&quot; he said.   &quot;I&apos;ve got a gun.&quot; 

   

 She moved over and he said, &quot;Don&apos;t look at my face.&quot;   She stared 

 instead at the gun, and saw what seemed to be a small silver revolver 

 with white grips.   All she could think was: I can&apos;t believe this is 

 happening. 

   

 She slid her eyes sideways, and she could see that the man wore blue 

 jeans and running shoes.   She let her eyes move up, and could see his 

 sports gloves, a watch cap, and the wide swath of tape covering the 

 bridge of his nose.   He did not realize that she had seen him. 

   

 The man adjusted the seat to fit his long legs, started the engine, 

 and backed the car out.   He made a right turn on North Main Street 

 and headed north toward Highway 263. 

   

 &quot;May I have a cigarette?&quot;   she asked. 

   

 &quot;No.   And don&apos;t look at my face.   Do you have any money?&quot; 

   

 &quot;A twenty-dollar bill.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Is it in your purse?   Get it for me.&quot; 

   

 She fished out the bill, and asked him if he wanted the change too, 

 but he said she could keep that. 

   

 It wasn&apos;t money he was after anyway.   He wanted to know the whole 

 history of her sex life.   Did she?   How many men had she had?   She 

 said she didn&apos;t know.   About how many?   Jessie Clovis finally said, 

 &quot;Two,&quot; and began to cry. 

   

 &quot;Stop crying.   I&apos;m not going to hurt you.&quot; 

   

 He ordered her to lie down across the seat so that her head was in 

 his lap.   She had to brace herself with her hand on the dashboard to 

 keep from falling to the floor.   He asked if she&apos;d ever given oral 

 sex before, and she said no.   He forced her to unzip his pants, and 

 she cried harder.   Her tears seemed to anger him, and he demanded 

 that she stop crying. 

   

 &quot;Do what I say.   You understand that, don&apos;t you?&quot; 

   

 He asked if he could touch her breasts, continuing to use gutter 

 language, but he hadn&apos;t really sought permission; he was already 

 fondling her. 

   

 He seemed to want approval.   He wanted her to tell him how much she 

 was enjoying what he was doing.   He squeezed her breasts until they 

 hurt, and she obeyed and she said what he wanted her to say.   She 

 lied and told him that his hands pleased her. 

   

 &quot;Do you let your boyfriend do this to you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Why not?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Because it&apos;s wrong.&quot; 

   

 He was silent for a short time as the car hurtled down the highway, 

 but the man had plans for Jessie.   He ordered her to touch her own 

 body intimately, and she pretended to do so.   Now he ordered her to 

 fellate him.   She refused, and he grabbed her by the hair and bent 

 her over his penis.   She gagged, and that pleased him. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m bigger than your boyfriend, aren&apos;t I?&quot;   Jessie lied and said she 

 guessed so. 

   

 Her abductor gave directions, demanding that she do this...and 

 this...to him to stimulate him.   She was sure she was going to 

 die if she didn&apos;t do everything he asked.   At length he ejaculated 

 into her mouth and hair.   She fought to keep from vomiting. 

   

 They were still racing down the highway, getting farther and farther 

 away from populated areas.   He promised her that there would be 

 more; he insisted that she masturbate herself so she would be moist 

 and ready for him.   He was obviously having a good time, and he 

 seemed almost casual about what he was doing to her.   He kept her 

 pinned flat to the front seat of her car so that no car passing by 

 could see her. 

   

 She felt his thigh harden as he braked, and heard him say, 

 &quot;Oops...gotta turn around.&quot; 

   

 The car stopped and made a U-turn.   She hoped and prayed that they 

 were heading back toward Yreka.   It seemed to be only four or five 

 minutes before she felt the car slow again and pull off to the side 

 of the road and stop. 

   

 &quot;Take your pants off, and your underwear, and your shoes,&quot; he 

 ordered.   &quot;Now, get in the backseat.   But keep your head down and 

 don&apos;t look at my face.&quot; 

   

 The dark man told Jessie Clovis to bend over so he could enter her 

 from the rear.   She obeyed him, but he was annoyed because he hadn&apos;t 

 achieved a second full erection. 

   

 Slowly he became erect, and now he toyed with her.   &quot;I could either 

 come inside you or pull out and make you drink my come.   It&apos;s up to 

 you.&quot; 

   

 She could not bear to fellate him again.   Resignedly she told him to 

 ejaculate inside her.   But he was playing a sadistic game; he&apos;d only 

 wanted to find out which act would upset her the most, and she&apos;d 

 given him his answer. 

   

 He demanded that she swallow his ejaculate.   She started to cry 

 again, and he barked at her to stop.   Her sobs spoiled the game.   It 

 seemed necessary for him to be accepted as if he were truly her 

 lover.   She tried to pretend; she wanted to live. 

   

 &quot;That was good, wasn&apos;t it?&quot; 

   

 She nodded, wary of angering him. 

   

 &quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;lie back down.&quot; 

   

 She saw something in his hand, and knew that now he was surely going 

 to shoot her with the silver gun.   But he held only a roll of white 

 tape.   He showed her the tape, and she saw that it was half gone.   He 

 taped her wrists together so that she couldn&apos;t move, and then he took 

 a rag and wiped the seat clean of any fingerprints he might have left. 

   

 &quot;Don&apos;t go to the police,&quot; he warned.   &quot;If you do, I&apos;ll just say that 

 you picked me up hitchhiking and you asked for it.   They&apos;ll believe 

 me.   That would be an embarrassment for you.&quot; 

   

 Jessie lay weakly on the rear seat as the big man climbed back into 

 the front and started the car, heading toward Yreka. 

   

 &quot;Why did you do this to me?&quot;   she asked finally. 

   

 &quot;Because all women are alike,&quot; he snorted.   &quot;They only give you pussy 

 when they want it.   My girlfriend was a waitress and fooled around 

 behind my back.   She attracted a lot of men, and that made me 

 jealous.   I&apos;m a very jealous guy.&quot; 

   

 Jessie tried to keep him talking so he wouldn&apos;t stop the car and rape 

 her again.   &quot;Why did she do that to you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Because she was a bitch.   She put out only when she wanted to.   Like 

 you--you should give it to your boyfriend all the time.&quot; 

   

 She moved slightly to relieve the pressure on her wrists and 

 shoulders.   He heard her. 

   

 &quot;Don&apos;t move!&quot; 

   

 &quot;Are you going to kill me now?&quot; 

   

 He laughed.   &quot;No.   I&apos;m not that kind of a guy.   Do you think I&apos;m that 

 kind of guy?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   No, of course not.&quot; 

   

 She asked what he was going to do with her, and he replied that he 

 would drop her off in front of the store.   She asked for her clothes 

 so that she wouldn&apos;t be left naked on the streets of Yreka, but he 

 refused, saying that she might try to get away. 

   

 And then she could see streetlights through the car windows, and felt 

 the car stop.   He was gallant now.   He explained that he had stopped 

 between some parked cars so that no one could see her. 

   

 &quot;Okay?&quot;   he asked cheerfully.   &quot;Now, don&apos;t report this to the police.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I won&apos;t,&quot; Jessie Clovis lied. 

   

 The dark man reached back and grabbed her breast and shook it 

 lightly.   And then he was gone. 

   

 Jessie raised up in the backseat and saw his broad shoulders 

 disappearing toward Sambo&apos;s Restaurant by the I-5.   She struggled to 

 get the tape off her wrists. 

   

 It took her fifteen minutes before she was free: Trembling, she threw 

 her clothes on and drove to her home.   Then she called the Yreka 

 Police Department. 

   

 She described her rapist.   &quot;Twenty-five to thirty.   Six feet tall, 

 175 pounds.   Brown hair.   Short beard and mustache.   Tape or Band-Aid 

 over his nose.   Blue watch cap, green jacket, blue jeans, white 

 tennis shoes.   Nickel-plated revolver, approximately four- to 

 six-inch barrel.&quot; 

   

 The description was beginning to sound familiar. 

   

 Rusty Brewer told the other officers at the Medford meeting that the 

 Shasta County investigators had found more cases, all of them along 

 the I-5 freeway, and all within a week of the double murder in 

 Mountain Gate. 

   

 On January 29 a twenty-year-old clerk working alone in Winchell&apos;s 

 Donut Shop in Grants Pass, Oregon, had been accosted by a man who fit 

 the familiar description.   He had robbed the shop of seventy dollars 

 and fondled both the clerk and a teenage customer. 

   

 Only an hour later, the man with the tape on his nose held up the 

 Richards Market in Medford, Oregon, thirty-five miles south on the 

 I-5.   He used the same silver revolver. 

   

 The investigators at that first meeting had little doubt that they 

 were all looking for the same man.   The physical description, the 

 M.O., and the connection to the I-5 freeway all matched.   That was 

 circumstantial evidence, very strong circumstantial evidence, but 

 only probable. 

   

 The next day, lab reports gave the investigative team absolute 

 physical evidence correlation.   The bullets found in the bodies of 

 Donna Eckard and Janell Jarvis matched exactly the bullets removed 

 from Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot.   They had been fired from the same 

 gun. 

   

 And there was more; the surgical adhesive tape that had been used to 

 bind the victims in Grants Pass, Medford, Redding, Yreka, and Shasta 

 County not only matched in all classes and characteristics but also 

 had come from the same roll!   The torn edges could be approximated. 

   

 By coordinating their efforts, the investigators could have a virtual 

 army of detectives working against time to catch this sexual sadist 

 who apparently thought no one had connected his myriad crimes.   Given 

 the magnitude of the danger the suspect posed, was the &quot;army&quot; big 

 enough? 

   

 On the trip back from Medford, Kominek made a wager with Holloway. 

 &quot;Where do you think he&apos;ll hit next?   I&apos;ll put my money on Albany or 

 Salem.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ll match you,&quot; Holloway responded, &quot;but I say Corvallis or Eugene.&quot; 

   

 That very night, the I-5 Killer demonstrated that his trackers 

 understood his pattern very well, but he neutralized the bet: he hit 

 Corvallis and Albany. 

   

 On February 9 he appeared at a fabric store in Corvallis at eight P.M 

 He robbed the clerk of three hundred dollars, threatening her with a 

 small silver gun.   Then he forced the thirty-year- old clerk and her 

 female customer into a back room, where he taped their hands, ankles, 

 and mouths with surgical tape.   When they were helpless, the now 

 familiar sexual abuse took place.   The clerk was fondled as she lay 

 helpless.   Then the robber masturbated himself against her face. 

   

 On that same night, the suspect bound and sodomized two young women 

 at an Albany laundromat ten miles east of Corvallis. 

   

 Considering the circumstances, Holloway and Kominek were chagrined to 

 find that they had been right on target in pinpointing their quarry&apos;s 

 next hits. 

   

                                 * * * 

   

 In Salem, Dave Kominek fashioned a map that showed the broad blue 

 ribbon of the I-5 freeway as it unfurled from northern California to 

 Bellingham, Washington.   He tacked it on the wall of his office and 

 then placed Polaroids of all the composite pictures from the cases 

 they knew about thus far next to it.   They were so alike.   In some, 

 the suspect wore a hood, in some a watch cap.   Rarely, his own curly 

 dark hair showed.   Sometimes he was clean-shaven, but most of the 

 composites showed a beard, just as the majority of them featured 

 patches of tape across the nose. 

   

 Dozens of pairs of dark eyes stared back at Kominek and Holloway, 

 mocking eyes that seemed to say, &quot;Catch me if you can, you dumb 

 bastards.&quot; 

   

 Kominek stared back, and vowed softly, &quot;You got it, baby.&quot; 

   

   

                                   11 

   

 After Shelley Janson left to return to school in New Mexico at New 

 Year&apos;s, Randy had begun his new life in Eugene.   He moved into the 

 room he&apos;d rented through an ad Arden Bates had placed in the Eugene 

 Register.   Arden was twenty-nine, divorced, and had a six-year-old 

 son, Mickey.   The rent on the neat rambler on E Street was three 

 hundred and fifty dollars a month, and she was finding it hard to 

 make the payments.   She and Mickey didn&apos;t need the third bedroom. 

   

 Randy had left Medford after celebrating Christmas with Ralph, and 

 gone to Eugene, where he&apos;d rented a room at the New Oregon Motel. 

 Then he&apos;d gone through the ads looking for a place to live.   He 

 called Arden Bates, checked the place out, and decided it would do 

 fine. 

   

 The next day, he&apos;d met Shelley for the first time at O&apos;Callahan&apos;s. 

 On New Year&apos;s Eve he had gone back with Shelley and paid for the 

 first month.   It had been a busy two days for him, moving to Eugene, 

 falling in love, and arranging his new living quarters.   Somehow, 

 informing his parole officer that he was moving had slipped his mind. 

 Judy Pulliam assumed that Randy still lived in the Portland area. 

   

 Arden had made it plain right from the beginning that she wasn&apos;t 

 advertising for a sex partner; she told Randy that if he had any 

 ideas about that, that her house wasn&apos;t the place for him.   He&apos;d 

 responded that sex wasn&apos;t what he was looking for either; he only 

 wanted a room to live in. 

   

 It had proved to be a satisfactory arrangement.   Arden Bates was a 

 little overweight and a little old for Randy&apos;s tastes, and he made 

 only desultory passes at her.   She found him an easygoing &quot;laid-back&quot; 

 kind of guy, and didn&apos;t expect any trouble from him.   He told her 

 that he was out of work and living on ninety dollars a week 

 unemployment compensation, but that he had money and she wouldn&apos;t 

 have to worry that he could pay his share of the rent and the 

 utilities. 

   

 &quot;If anybody asks you what I do for a living,&quot; he kidded her, &quot;just 

 tell them I do bookkeeping for you.&quot; 

   

 She laughed.   She didn&apos;t really care where his money came from as 

 long as he met his obligations. 

   

 Six-year-old Mickey liked the new roomer, and Randy often played ball 

 with the neighborhood youngsters, who were really impressed when he 

 told them that he&apos;d played with the Green Bay Packers.   He showed 

 them the Packers sticker on the back window of his gold Volkswagen 

 Bug.   On one occasion he took the neighbor kids to see the Harlem 

 Globetrotters play basketball. 

   

 Actually, Randy seemed to be the perfect roomer; he wasn&apos;t around 

 that much.   Arden worked six days a week, and when she was home, 

 Randy was usually gone.   He took many overnight trips.   He told her 

 to tell anyone who inquired about him that he was out applying for 

 jobs.   She wondered when he found the time to look for work...He 

 worked out often at a health club, and he signed up to play 

 basketball with a team sponsored by a local optical firm.   He told 

 her he would be attending the University of Oregon when the spring 

 term started. 

   

 Arden also marveled that Randy lived like a playboy, even though he 

 had no visible means of support beyond his unemployment checks.   He 

 brought home prime steaks to cook, and several cases of beer at a 

 time.   He bought a forty-dollar plant for the living room.   When his 

 car was in the shop, he took taxis.   He had the Volkswagen fitted out 

 with five stereo speakers and a &quot;fuzzbuster&quot; to detect police radar 

 traps.   He talked a lot about his girlfriend, Shelley, in New Mexico 

 and told Arden that he was going to send her a round-trip plane 

 ticket to come and see him.   He bought presents often for Shelley 

 too, and mailed the mementos of his devotion to her. 

   

 Arden saw Randy snort cocaine, and she knew that that was a very 

 expensive habit.   In the evenings that he was in town, he patronized 

 bars like De Frisco&apos;s, the Pour House, the Tavern on the Green, or 

 O&apos;Callahan&apos;s. 

   

 Arden noticed that Randy seemed addicted to the telephone; he made 

 long-distance calls as easily as most people called across town.   Her 

 phone bills were huge, but Randy always paid his share, so it didn&apos;t 

 concern her. 

   

 Her roomer seemed obsessed with communication in all forms.   First, 

 it was the phone, and then it was the mail; Randy hated to leave the 

 house until he&apos;d picked up his mail.   And he did get a lot of mail, 

 not only from Shelley but also from other women. 

   

 Sometimes Arden wondered just how committed Randy was to his New 

 Mexico girlfriend.   If he did love her as much as he claimed, he 

 wasn&apos;t demonstrating much fidelity to her.   His landlady saw that 

 Randy was fascinated with teenage girls.   What he did outside the 

 house was his own business, but she was annoyed when she saw him 

 coming on to, her sixteen-year-old baby-sitter.   Arden came home a 

 few weeks after Randy had moved in and found him in bed with the 

 teenage sitter.   Arden expressed her disapproval, and wanted to take 

 the girl home, but Randy had said, &quot;No, she doesn&apos;t want to go home,&quot; 

 and closed the&apos; door to his room. 

   

 The girl developed a tremendous crush on Arden&apos;s thirty-year- old 

 roomer, and Arden found her with a naked Randy three or four times 

 more when she was supposed to be baby-sitting. 

   

 Still, Arden talked with the girl and figured out that actual 

 intercourse hadn&apos;t taken place.   Then she tried to convince Randy to 

 leave the girl alone, saying, &quot;Why do you bother with her?   She 

 doesn&apos;t even give in to you.&quot; 

   

 He only shrugged. 

   

 On two occasions he brought women home.   First, it was two young girl 

 hitchhikers he&apos;d picked up.   One girl looked about sixteen, and the 

 other said she&apos;d just turned twenty.   He&apos;d taken the girls into his 

 room for several hours, and then told Arden he was leaving to drop 

 them off at Lane Community College in time for their evening class 

 there. 

   

 There was another woman, a pretty dark-haired young woman in her 

 early twenties.   Arden was up when the pair walked in at 

 eleven-thirty one night, and she tactfully left them alone and went 

 to bed.   When she woke up, it was after three and the television in 

 the living room was sending out a steady drone.   She looked for Randy 

 but he was nowhere in the house.   He was home the next day.   She 

 didn&apos;t ask him about the girl; it was really none of her business. 

 Their agreement was that she would go her way and he would go his. 

   

 In spite of his constant womanizing, Arden found Randy&apos;s demeanor 

 around women quite gallant; he treated them politely 

 and deferred to their wishes.   Still, she termed him a &quot;Mr.   Ego&quot; 

 when she watched him posing and preening in front of women 

 like a high-school kid might to get attention. 

   

 Arden planned to move from the house on E Street on April 1, and 

 until then her living arrangements were fine with her.   She knew 

 nothing about Randy&apos;s background, and she didn&apos;t care to know.   He 

 paid his share, and he wasn&apos;t underfoot much of the time.   When he 

 was home, he was invariably pleasant, and nice to Mickey and the 

 other kids.   It was working out well. 

   

 As for Randy&apos;s life during the first months of 1981, he did write and 

 call Shelley often, and he did send her presents, along with 

 declarations of his love.   While Shelley dreamed of marrying him and 

 bearing his children, while she started to play tennis and do aerobic 

 exercises so that she would be worthy of him, and while she gazed at 

 his pictures unable to study, Randy continued to prowl looking for 

 other women. 

   

 He apparently could not stop; he was as addicted to the conquest of 

 women as some men are to heroin.   And no matter how many he seduced, 

 it was never enough.   He still felt empty. 

   

 If a day went by when he didn&apos;t have a date, or two or three, he was 

 depressed.   He was nice to girls, he bought them drinks, and he 

 didn&apos;t bring up sex in a raunchy way.   He could not understand why 

 they rejected him when he wanted to get closer.   He could not see 

 that he skipped vital steps in the courting process.   High-school 

 girls might fall for his brand of &quot;instant love,&quot; but girls with any 

 experience at all saw how superficial he was.   Superficial and a 

 little weird. 

   

 He had to find more women.   He looked in the bars, he looked on the 

 freeway.   He was living two lives now.   He had been polite and 

 considerate to women, and it had gotten him nowhere.   He found far 

 greater pleasure in taking what he wanted.   After each incident in 

 which he made helpless women do what he wanted, he felt better for a 

 while. 

   

 But for such a little while. 

   

 On Friday, February 13, 1981, Randy found himself on the I-5 freeway 

 south of Seattle headed back to Portland.   He spotted a pretty girl 

 driving in front of him, and pulled in close behind her.   She was an 

 eighteen-year-old student heading home to Salem.   She noticed the man 

 in the gold Volkswagen Bug with the Oregon plates pull alongside her 

 several times.   He smiled and pointed off the freeway, motioning with 

 his hand as if he held a drink.   She shook her head no.   He was not 

 that easily discouraged, and pulled off near the Thunderbird Motel in 

 Kelso, apparently expecting her to follow.   She grinned and sped up. 

   

 It wasn&apos;t long before she saw the gold Volkswagen in her rearview 

 mirror again; he had raced to catch up with her.   He pulled up into 

 an adjacent lane and smiled broadly, pointing again to the side of 

 the road.   When she didn&apos;t respond by pulling off, he drifted back 

 behind her.   She wasn&apos;t alarmed; she was intrigued.   The man was 

 good-looking, and she was tempted to stop and talk with him. 

   

 They were close to Vancouver when she finally pulled into the 

 Whimpy&apos;s Burger Stand lot and waited for the dark man to join her. 

   

 She found him very nice.   He told her he was twenty-five and that he 

 lived in Portland with his sister.   He said he&apos;d been a bartender but 

 he&apos;d had to quit because someone was selling illegal drugs in the 

 restaurant where he worked.   He mentioned Eugene and said he would be 

 going to the university there.   It was really an innocent encounter, 

 she thought; they never even got out of their cars.   But she did give 

 him her phone number in Salem. 

   

 That was all Randy needed.   Over the Valentine&apos;s Day week- end he 

 called her several times.   Her stepfather answered the phone and 

 talked to Randy at two-thirty A.M.   on Sunday, February 15, but 

 refused to call his daughter to the phone.   Whoever the guy was, he 

 sounded very intoxicated. 

   

 Randy called again at eleven that Sunday morning and asked her to 

 come to his suite in the Marriott Hotel in Portland.   She said no. 

   

 It didn&apos;t matter; Randy was pursuing a woman, and nothing would deter 

 him.   He looked up her phone number in a reverse directory and found 

 out her address and last name.   He began to send her cards.   She 

 thought his letters were rather strange.   She never dated him. 

   

 But she remembered him. 

   

 So many women would remember Randy Woodfield, remember dates and 

 places and things he&apos;d said.   In the end, it would be women who would 

 help to trap him, women who could place him in areas where it was 

 dangerous for him to have been remembered.   He left his name with 

 them.   almost compulsively He told them too much about himself, never 

 worrying that he might have left a trail for someone to follow.

 Valentine&apos;s Day was an important holiday for Randy Woodfield; it was 

 the ultimate romantic date.   He tried to make sure that none of his 

 women would forget him, sending out dozens of cards, and, of course, 

 the yellow roses to Shelley.   He planned to spend that weekend in 

 Beaverton, Oregon, his old stomping grounds, and he wrote to several 

 girls there, promising that he would take them out to dinner when he 

 was in town.   He planned to rent a room at the Marriott Hotel in 

 Portland and throw a party on Saturday, February 14.   He was running 

 true to form; most of the girls who received Valentine cards were 

 very young, some of them still in high school. 

   

 Randy had one platonic female friend in Beaverton, Dixie Palliter. 

 Dixie had a steady boyfriend, but she liked Randy and was an avid 

 listener when he discussed his escapades and his problems with women. 

 She assured him that she would be able to spend some time with him 

 while he was in Beaverton.   He planned to call the girl from Salem 

 he&apos;d met on the freeway in Washington, and he also expected to see 

 another of his old prison buddies. 

   

 Randy had so many tentative dates for that Valentine&apos;s Day weekend in 

 Beaverton that he could not possibly have kept them all, but he 

 wanted to be sure he had all bases covered. 

   

 The captain of detectives in the Beaverton Police Department was Dave 

 Bishop, a tall, handsome man nearing forty.   Bishop, gruff-voiced and 

 punctilious about detail, had risen rapidly through the ranks in the 

 Beaverton department.   He was a superior detective and an 

 indefatigable investigator.   His brains and his dedication to duty 

 made him a likely candidate for an administrative office.   They also 

 made him a likely candidate for ulcer--which he had.   The cop&apos;s 

 occupational hazard. 

   

 On that Valentine&apos;s Day in 1981, Dave Bishop was attending a 

 religious retreat at St.   Ignatius in Portland.   He had looked 

 forward to two days without urgent phone messages.   Two days without 

 dealing with the mechanics of death and violence. 

   

 But early Sunday morning, Bishop received a call from his office. 

 &quot;We have a dead body, with suspicious circumstances.&quot; 

   

 The body was that of Julie Ann Reitz.   Julie Ann Reitz, who had been 

 one of Randall Woodfield&apos;s admirers, if a long time back; Julie; who 

 had once called him an &quot;asshole&quot; when she found him with another 

 woman. 

   

 Julie, who still lived with her mother and a female roommate in a 

 plush duplex on S.W.   Cherryhill Drive in Beaverton, had celebrated 

 her eighteenth birthday only two days before.   She had had plans to 

 attend several Valentine&apos;s Day parties on Saturday night, although 

 she wasn&apos;t going with a date.   Both her mother and her roommate were 

 also away until the early hours of Sunday morning. 

   

 When her mother returned home, she found all the lights blazing, and 

 then she saw, on the stairway of the town house, Julie&apos;s slender 

 naked body.   Thinking at first that the girl might have fainted, or 

 even passed out after drinking more than she could handle, her mother 

 rushed to help her up.   But up close she could see that Julie&apos;s long 

 light brown hair was stained mahogany with her own blood.   She 

 thought that Julie must have struck her head on the newel post and 

 been knocked unconscious.   But Julie did not respond to any stimuli, 

 and her mother dialed frantically for help. 

   

 Ambulance attendants saw almost at once that Julie Reitz hadn&apos;t 

 fallen; she had been shot--a near-contact wound to the head--and she 

 was dead.   The body was left on the stairway, and Beaverton police 

 were called.   Uniformed patrolmen verified that this, indeed, was a 

 homicide, and cordoned off the crime scene to await detectives. 

   

 Captain Dave Bishop and Detective Neal Loper took charge of the case. 

   

 There were no signs of struggle.   It looked as if Julie had been 

 running down the Stairs toward the front door when she was cut down 

 by bullets.   Likely her killer had been just behind her and he--or 

 she--had stopped the victim from flinging open the door to run for 

 help.   

   

 Julie&apos;s mother and roommate said that the door to their home was 

 always locked and that Julie would not have let a stranger in, 

 particularly not late at night.   That meant, surely, that her 

 murderer was someone she had known and trusted.   And if she&apos;d known 

 her attacker, he might well have felt killing her was the only way to 

 keep his identity secret. 

   

 Like most teenagers, Julie had trusted a lot of people.   Because she 

 had been beautiful enough to be a model, Julie had had many male 

 admirers.   She dated frequently, mostly men near her own age. 

   

 Julie had graduated from high school just a month before her murder 

 and she had been working as a clerk in a children&apos;s clothing store, 

 Kids for Sure. 

   

 In an effort to retrace her activities on Valentine&apos;s evening, Loper 

 and Bishop talked with her friends.   She had been seen at several 

 parties that Saturday night, and the last time anyone had seen her 

 was around two in the morning.   There had been no arguments, no 

 incidents at all during the evening that might spark murder.   The 

 last time anyone saw her, Julie had indicated that she was on her way 

 home. 

   

 In talking with Julie&apos;s friends, Dave Bishop learned that an older 

 man, a man in his forties, had been attracted to her, and had 

 insisted that she accept expensive presents from him.   She had not 

 been even vaguely interested in him.   The detective captain wondered, 

 however, if the man might have taken the rejection badly. 

   

 It was as good a place to start as any.   On Sunday evening the man 

 was located in an expensive Beaverton restaurant.   He was haughty 

 when asked to leave his steak dinner to speak with detectives, but 

 Bishop informed him quietly that a murder investigation took 

 precedence over his meal.   He could talk there, or he could talk at 

 headquarters.   Meekly the man followed Bishop out of the restaurant. 

   

 He was able to present a solid alibi for his time on February 14... 

   

 A young man was located who had spent time with Julie at a 

 Valentine&apos;s party. 

   

 &quot;I was with her at ten, but that was the last time I saw her.   I did 

 take her home.&quot; 

   

 The youth passed a polygraph test.   Three other teenage boys who had 

 been with Julie at various times during the crucial evening were 

 given polygraphs.   All of them passed. 

   

 An autopsy on Julie&apos;s body produced a bullet from deep in her brain. 

 It was a .38, the kind of bullet used in Smith and Wesson .38 

 Specials.   Time of death was estimated as having occurred between 

 three and four A.M.   on February 15.   Acid-phosphatase 

 tests were positive for the presence of male ejaculate, and the man 

 who had raped Julie had left behind the semen that marked his blood 

 as Type B with no PGM enzyme factors.   There was not enough fluid 

 left to isolate positive or negative RH factors. 

   

 Sheets from Julie&apos;s bed were stained with the same type of semen. 

 Both Julie&apos;s mother and her roommate were adamant when they said that 

 Julie had not been sexually active in recent months.   The semen 

 stains on her sheets had to be fresh. 

   

 It was impossible to tell whether intercourse had taken place before 

 or after the victim&apos;s death. 

   

 Dave Bishop is a &quot;charter,&quot; a detective who believes that if only 

 enough information is gathered and recorded, the truth will 

 eventually surface. 

   

 &quot;We had a huge office,&quot; he recalls, &quot;and we soon had all the walls 

 covered with butcher paper.   Every name, every connection--no matter 

 how slight--to the victim was jotted down.   I want to see what I&apos;m 

 doing, study it, read it, talk to it.   If you can see it written 

 down, sooner or later the common denominator is going to jump out at 

 you.&quot; 

   

 Within a week of the murder, Bishop&apos;s crew of detectives had 

 questioned over a hundred people, taken reams of statements, 

 and given three dozen polygraph tests--all of which cleared the 

 subjects. 

   

 And all for naught--or so it seemed. 

   

 One bit of information listed on the chart came to the Beaverton 

 detectives through a circuitous route.   A woman who worked in the 

 lunchroom of a school in Aloha, Oregon, had overheard a conversation 

 among several teachers.   One of the teachers&apos; sons, a student at 

 Beaverton High School, knew someone who had seen a Volkswagen Bug 

 driving up and down the street in front of Julie Reitz&apos;s town house 

 very late on Valentine&apos;s night.   The car had finally pulled over to 

 the curb and the headlights were flashed off and on. 

   

 Pretty thin stuff, but the words &quot;Volkswagen Bug&quot; were printed on one 

 of Bishop&apos;s butcher-paper charts. 

   

 Neal Loper and Dave Bishop continued to question friends of Julie 

 Reitz, and then friends of friends, always with the same question: 

 &quot;Will you list for me everyone you can think of that Julie knew? 

 Will you try to remember where she went, and with whom?   Even if it 

 doesn&apos;t seem important, we want to know.&quot; 

   

 The butcher paper inched around the Beaverton office, and the blank 

 spaces on the paper filled up.   If a name appeared twice, it was 

 starred.   Somewhere, Bishop believed, there was a connection, if they 

 could only link the correct factors. 

   

 Forty-five miles southeast of Beaverton, in Salem, Dave Kominek 

 decided that another joint meeting was needed. 

   

 In Oregon, the state attorney general&apos;s office is available to assist 

 city and county jurisdictions with criminal investigation and 

 prosecution.   Kominek talked with Bob Hamilton, chief assistant 

 attorney general in the criminal division.   Hamilton had lost the 

 election for Marion County district attorney in a close race with 

 Chris Van Dyke, but there was no enmity between the two attorneys. 

 Hamilton agreed that the I-5 Killer case was one to which the state 

 office should offer whatever assistance it could. 

   

 Kominek organized a joint meeting to be held in Roseburg, Oregon, and 

 Bob Hamilton served as chairman of that session.   The attorney 

 general&apos;s office would print and disseminate information on the I-5 

 Killer to all agencies who might be involved.   The Oregon State Crime 

 Lab would handle all the evidence turned up in that state&apos;s cases, 

 and the Department of Justice Crime Lab in Redding would evaluate 

 evidence from California crimes.   All Washington evidence would go to 

 the Western Washington Crime Lab in Seattle, whose director was famed 

 criminalist George Isnii. 

   

 A massive force of detectives, forensic science experts, and 

 prosecuting attorneys was about to concentrate all its efforts on one 

 man.   The need for haste had accelerated.   The roster of crimes was 

 growing. 

   

 In going over new cases sent to him, Dave Kominek could see that the 

 I-5 Killer had apparently returned from California on February 4. 

 Wherever the man&apos;s home base was, it had to be located midway up the 

 Oregon coast.   He seemed to work north, south, and west of that 

 general location. 

   

 On February 12 the suspect had headed north again.   It was a busy 

 night for him, frightening proof that his crimes were accelerating. 

   

 He started in Vancouver at a quarter to six in the evening, when he 

 robbed the Sassy Dress Shop on Main Street of fifty dollars and bound 

 the elderly clerk with adhesive tape. 

   

 An hour and a half later, he was in Olympia, Washington, a hundred 

 miles north on the I-5 freeway.   He forced two teenagers into a 

 freezer of a drive-in restaurant and subjected them to sexual abuse 

 before cleaning out the cash register.   He left his victims locked in 

 the almost airless freezer. 

   

 By ten PM he was in Bellevue, Washington, confronting two employees 

 at a Dairy Queen as they were counting the day&apos;s receipts.   He 

 grabbed the stack of bills, locked the male employee in the freezer, 

 and turned to the young woman. 

   

 Five minutes after the bearded man with the Band-Aid on his nose 

 left, his third set of victims in one night called the Bellevue 

 Police Department.   The case was assigned to Detective Gary Trent. 

 The assailant was long gone; he had used his standard escape route, 

 the I-5 freeway. 

   

 The composite pictures drawn in Vancouver and Olympia and Bellevue 

 were almost identical.   And they were, of course, almost identical 

 with all the other composites. 

   

 The atmosphere at the Roseburg conference was tense; instead of the 

 new information on the suspect they&apos;d hoped for, the officers 

 attending were hearing only about more cases--unsolved cases.   Dave 

 Kominek described the I-5 Killer&apos;s M.O.: 

   

 &quot;The subject hits various businesses in the evening hours, normally 

 between five P.M.   and eleven P.M., with emphasis on the 

 early-evening hours.   He goes in when there is a lull in business. 

 We believe he is armed with a thirty-two-caliber silver revolver In 

 most instances, he ties or tapes his victims-with hands crossed 

 behind their backs and ankles crossed.   He usually picks businesses 

 with young women on duty, and often with two young women.   He has 

 them disrobe, but he only unzips his trousers.   He forces victims to 

 masturbate him or to perform oral sodomy.   With older females he 

 usually only fondles.   He invariably takes his victims to the back of 

 the building where they cannot be seen from the street.   He sometimes 

 removes the telephone receiver to prevent victims from calling for 

 help.&quot;   

   

 Kominek wrote on a blackboard: 

   

 Tape on nose. 

   

 Green jacket or windbreaker-type jacket. 

   

 Hood or ski cap. 

   

 Fake beard. 

   

 Gloves-ski, sporting, driving. 

   

 No odors detected. 

   

 Soft-spoken, rarely uses profanity. 

   

 Macho--considers his penis is large, and brags about it. 

   

 When he leaves, orders victims to count to 100 or 500. 

   

 Vehicle thought to be left several blocks away. 

   

 White male--25 to 28. 

   

 5&apos;11&quot; to 6&apos; 1&quot;, medium build. 

   

 Dark hair, possibly curly. 

   

 Dark eyes-&quot;sad eyes&quot; or &quot;tired eyes.&quot; 

   

 Good-looking.   Possible acne scarring. 

   

 Weapons: .32-caliber 6-shot revolver, nickel- or chrome-plated. 

   

 Smith&amp;Wesson model 60 stainless-steel .38 Special 5-shot 

 with a 3&quot; barrel, wood grips. 

   

 Vehicle: Volkswagen Bug??? 

   

 There was a tentative psychological profile.   The handouts noting the 

 profile were stamped &quot;Confidential.&quot;   No one but the detectives 

 should know that much about the suspect at that point. 

   

 &quot;Subject is a male Caucasian, possibly recently divorced or separated 

 from girlfriend.   Released within the last year from some type of 

 institution.   Has a very macho image of himself.   Is the type to 

 drive a four-wheel-drive or sports-type car.   Uses false beards as a 

 possible macho symbol.   The Band-Aid is simply to hide behind.   This 

 man is probably the type who would be considered a very nice person 

 by the people next door.   Primary motivation is sexually related. 

 Subject is a loner and possibly has latent homosexual tendencies.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Our man has herpes,&quot; Kominek continued.   &quot;Several of his victims 

 have contracted the disease after being sexually abused.   As far as 

 we know, he has never attempted normal intercourse; his fetish is 

 oral or anal sodomy.   I don&apos;t have to tell you how frustrating this 

 investigation is.   We know what he looks like, we know his patterns, 

 and we even know where he lives--but he&apos;s playing cat and mouse with 

 us.   When we&apos;re looking in Oregon, he&apos;s in Washington or California. 

 He may act like a monster, but he looks like the guy next door. 

 There are probably a lot of people who know him well, who think he&apos;s 

 a great guy--people who are going to be struck dumb when we catch 

 him.   He&apos;s as dangerous as any subject most of us will ever 

 encounter, and he&apos;s stepping up his attacks.   He&apos;s killed at least 

 three times, he&apos;s attacked children, and he&apos;s attacked women.   He&apos;s 

 in some kind of sexual frenzy.   Let&apos;s go get him.&quot; 

   

 The detectives at that Roseburg meeting could not know just how 

 closely the profile correlated with the characteristics of the man 

 they sought.   He could not know just how much they knew about him. 

   

 He thought he was home free. 

   

 Each agency attending the joint meeting was given the responsibility 

 of checking out and eliminating suspects in cases in their 

 jurisdictions.   Information on every suspect who could not be 

 eliminated would then be forwarded to Dave Kominek in Marion County. 

 A photographic mug lineup with all the composites to date would be 

 sent to all agencies concerned. 

   

 When the meeting was over, each investigator knew what all of the 

 others knew.   They knew so much... and yet so little.   They didn&apos;t 

 have a name.   They didn&apos;t have a face. 

   

 Marion County District Attorney Chris Van Dyke called a news 

 conference; he could not possibly warn all of the women in Oregon, 

 but he hoped his words might alert some of them to the danger.   Van 

 Dyke&apos;s usual broad smile was absent as he talked to reporters and 

 television cameras.   He told the press that there had already been 

 two dozen incidents of sexual attack on young women who lived and 

 worked near the I-5 corridor. 

   

 &quot;Unfortunately, the common thread that runs through a lot of 

 these cases is a situation where two women are together in isolated 

 laundromats, businesses, their homes, and places of 

 employment.&quot; 

   

 Van Dyke said that authorities had real fears that the killer might 

 strike again in Salem within the next few days.   He stressed that he 

 did not want to create a climate of fear but that he had no choice 

 but to warn women. 

   

 Monty Holloway spoke up.   &quot;He&apos;s probably one of those individuals 

 that, when he&apos;s caught, all of his neighbors will say &apos;I can&apos;t 

 believe it.   He&apos;s such a nice guy.&apos;&quot;   

   

 &quot;He could be your next-door neighbor,&quot; Kominek added.   

   

 Women were afraid.   Teenagers working in fast-food outlets and 

 convenience stores near the I-5 jumped at shadows.   More calls came 

 into police departments, but no one really knew who the killer was. 

 None of the information helped. 

   

 The murder of Julie Reitz on February 15 did not seem to be connected 

 to the epidemic of violence along the freeway.   Julie had been killed 

 in her own home, and almost certainly by someone she knew.   The I-5 

 Killer, on the other hand, seemed to choose his victims in a totally 

 random pattern.   Furthermore, Beaverton was west of Portland, and not 

 on the direct route along the I-5. 

   

 Dave Bishop and Neal Loper worked long hours on their case.   Dave 

 Kominek and Monty Holloway continued to work seven days a week on 

 trapping the I-5 Killer.   The Marion County detectives had never 

 heard of Julie Reitz; the Beaverton detectives had heard of the I-5 

 Killer, but the M.O.   wasn&apos;t right for their case. 

   

 The man with the Band-Aid disguise continued to attack women. 

   

 Three days after Julie Reitz died of a bullet in her brain, a 

 customer walked into the 7-11 store on Coburg Road in Eugene at 

 three-twenty-five in the morning.   He waited patiently for the clerk, 

 but no one appeared to wait on him.   And then he heard a muffled 

 thumping sound coming from the back room.   A little uneasy, he walked 

 back and found the female clerk lying on her stomach, her hands and 

 feet bound tightly with surgical tape, and a swath of the stuff over 

 her mouth.   Quickly he freed her and called the Eugene police. 

   

 The I-5 Killer had struck again.   This time, he had stopped at sexual 

 molestation. 

   

 Detective Ron Griesel of the Eugene Police Department took over the 

 investigation at three-thirty that morning.   Griesel spent most of 

 the night going over the 7-11.   He gathered what slight physical 

 evidence he could find.   There were no usable fingerprints.   There 

 was adhesive tape in the storeroom, and more of it was found in the 

 street outside the convenience store.   There were a Band-Aid box and 

 a Band-Aid, thrown away when the robber was through with them. 

 Saline swabs were brushed across the victim&apos;s nipples on the faint 

 chance that the suspect&apos;s blood type might be isolated in the saliva 

 he&apos;d left there. 

   

 Griesel found what might have been a real bonus: the television 

 camera that constantly scans the aisles and counters of all 7-11 

 stores.   Several frames from the videotape were snipped and then 

 frozen.   But when they were blown up, they proved to be 

 disappointing; in some of the frames, the man was out of sight below 

 the counter.   In others he appeared only as a tall, slender figure in 

 a dark jacket whose hood obscured his features.   He was as elusive on 

 videotape as he had always been. 

   

 There seemed to be no end to it.   The map on Kominek&apos;s office wall 

 had new flags marking new incidents, more drawings of the familiar 

 bearded face.   The man had been prowling for more than three months, 

 and the weary detective wondered if they were any closer to catching 

 him than they had been at the outset of the probe. 

   

 As if to thumb his nose at the police again, the suspect hit three 

 days later; he didn&apos;t even bother changing cities.   He had varied his 

 pattern only a little; he was working later.   Three, in the morning 

 at the 7-11.   This time, a little after nine at the Taco 

 Time on River Road in Eugene.   The two teenage girls on duty were 

 back in the kitchen area, and the place was empty of customers.   The 

 girls were wary; they&apos;d read about the I-5 Killer and they were 

 nervous whenever the business lulls came. 

   

 They heard the front door open and looked up to see the tall dark man 

 in the khaki jacket and watch cap walk directly into the 

 food-preparation area.   They couldn&apos;t see his hands; he had them 

 jammed in his pockets. 

   

 Seventeen-year-old Connie Soldano didn&apos;t wait to see what he wanted. 

 She bolted and ran toward the back door. 

   

 &quot;Stop!&quot;   the man shouted, and she half-turned and saw that he was 

 pointing a little silver pistol at her.   She kept on going, expecting 

 to feel a bullet in her back. 

   

 And then she was free. 

   

 She ran into a neighboring Dairy Queen and grabbed the phone to call 

 the Lane County Sheriff&apos;s Office.   She felt guilty, leaving her 

 friend alone, and she begged the operator to send help at once. 

   

 The big man had turned his attention to his lone captive.   &quot;You!   You 

 squat down on the floor and don&apos;t move.&quot;   Terri Brady did as she was 

 told, and the man ran out.   Moments later the Taco Time was 

 surrounded by police officers.   Terri signaled to them that the 

 robber was gone. 

   

 And he was completely gone.   No car.   Nothing left of him but a 

 wadded-up piece of surgical tape that he&apos;d tossed away onto the 

 parking lot in mid-flight. 

   

 There would be only one more.   Time was running out for the I-5 

 Killer. 

   

 On February 25 he found a setup that appealed to him.   He appeared in 

 Corvallis at a small restaurant at eight minutes to six in the 

 evening.   The employees were two pretty teenage girls, one of them 

 the daughter of a Corvallis police officer. 

   

 The man watched from his vantage point outside the restaurant, 

 marking time until a customer picked up his order and left. 

 Eighteen-year-old Jill Martin walked outside the restaurant and 

 around to the back of the building where the restrooms were.   As he 

 had done before, the bearded man forced his way into the restroom. 

   

 Jill Martin resisted--until she saw him cock the hammer of his silver 

 gun.   When he had climaxed, he laughed as she spat his ejaculate on 

 the floor, and then he bound her hands and feet with tape and left 

 her alone in the dark room. 

   

 It took Jill fifteen minutes to free her feet.   She could not get the 

 tape off her hands, but she stumbled to the door of the restaurant 

 and kicked at it until her friend heard her and let her In. 

   

 The semen found on the bathroom floor by Corvallis detectives was 

 tested by the Oregon State Crime Lab.   It was the ejaculate of a man 

 with B-negative blood with no PGM-enzyme characteristics. 

   

 Kominek and Holloway read this last report, and Kominek slammed it on 

 his desk. 

   

 &quot;Enough!   Dammit, that&apos;s enough!   It&apos;s time our side got lucky.&quot; 

   

 And finally it did. 

   

   

 13 

   

 In Beaverton, Oregon, Captain Dave Bishop and Detective Neal Loper 

 were as stymied with the progress of their murder case as Dave 

 Kominek and Monty Holloway were with the stalemate In tracking the 

 I-5 Killer.   While both departments were peripherally aware of the 

 other&apos;s investigations, all the detectives were working around the 

 clock on their own cases.   Anyone who has not been caught in the 

 vortex of an intensive murder probe can never really understand what 

 is involved.   Detectives&apos; lives are literally put on hold while they 

 work day and night in a boiler-room situation where nothing else 

 matters.   They eat, sleep, and breathe the details of the homicides 

 and their minds are a jumble of possibilities--most of which are 

 reviewed, analyzed, and then discarded.   If they make a mistake, even 

 one, there is the dread possibility that someone else is going to 

 die, and it will be their fault--or they will believe it is their 

 fault. 

   

 Bishop&apos;s ulcer flared up, and he gulped antacids and ignored 

 it.   Both he and Loper saw their homes infrequently, and then only to 

 catch a few hours of sleep.   The memory of Julie Reitz&apos;s body on the 

 stairway of her own home haunted them.   The thought that someone had 

 held a .38 to the back of her head was ugly.   The pretty, slender 

 girl could not have been much of a threat; she had clearly been shot 

 either because someone hated her so much that he wanted to destroy 

 her or, more chilling because he wanted to silence her. 

   

 They kept coming back to the concept that Julie&apos;s killer had to have 

 been someone she knew.   They were sure they had already cleared the 

 most likely suspects.   That meant that it must have been a man who 

 moved just outside the edges of her usual life, someone from her past 

 that most of her friends had forgotten about--or even someone she had 

 recently met. 

   

 Neal Loper questioned one of Julie&apos;s close friends again. 

   

 &quot;Think.   Could there be any man Julie knew so slightly that you may 

 have forgotten him?   Someone who didn&apos;t seem important?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No...Wait!   There was a guy...Randy.   He was a lot older than Julie.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Tell me about him,&quot; Loper urged. 

   

 &quot;He worked at the Faucet Tavern.   His name was Randy Woodfield.   That 

 was last summer.   Julie went out with him maybe once or twice.   He 

 came on too strong, and she told me she didn&apos;t want to date him 

 again--but then she said they were going to be friends.&quot; 

   

 &quot;She hadn&apos;t mentioned him lately?&quot; 

   

 The girl shook her head. 

   

 &quot;What kind of car did he drive?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Let me think.   Yeah...yeah, it was a Volkswagen Bug, I think.   Kind 

 of a gold color.&quot; 

   

 The information went up on the charts in Bishop&apos;s office: 

   

 &quot;Woodfield, Randy.   25-27?   Faucet Tavern bartender.   Volkswagen?&quot; 

   

 And then the name came up again.   One of Julie&apos;s girlfriends recalled 

 that Randy Woodfield had asked to sleep over in Julie&apos;s town house. 

 She explained that he&apos;d taken Julie out and gotten her a little 

 intoxicated. 

   

 &quot;He crawled in bed with us and fooled around with Julie--but nothing 

 really happened.&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield&apos;s name was jotted down again. 

   

 On February 27, when Woodfield&apos;s name was mentioned a third time, as 

 someone who had been seen around Beaverton on the Valentine&apos;s Day 

 weekend, he made the charts again.   A three-time winner...or 

 loser. 

   

 Coincidence?   Perhaps.   But detectives look at coincidence 

 differently than a man on the street would.   Coincidence can raise a 

 warning flag.   Bishop took a marking pencil and drew lines connecting 

 the three notations. 

   

 &quot;Let&apos;s see what else we can find out about this Randy Woodfield.&quot; 

   

 Neal Leper talked in depth with the young woman who had mentioned 

 Randy as someone Julie had once dated.   Yes, she was positive that 

 Julie had known Randy.   In fact, he&apos;d tried to make it a point to 

 keep in touch with Julie.   &quot;He&apos;s been to her house a couple of times.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Would he know her phone number?&quot;   Loper asked. 

   

 &quot;Oh, sure.   I&apos;m sure he would.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you know where Randy Woodfield is now?   Does he still work at the 

 Faucet?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   He got fired last fall.   He was into a lot of things that 

 weren&apos;t quite...legal.   The last I heard, he was living in Eugene 

 someplace and going to bartending school.&quot; 

   

 Loper called a girl who had mentioned that Woodfield was supposed to 

 be in Beaverton on the weekend of February 15 Her opinion too was 

 that Randy had been very interested in Julie Reitz. 

   

 &quot;I met Randy last spring,&quot; the high-school senior said.   &quot;His parents 

 live down at Otter Crest, and his sister lives in Portland.   He went to 

 bartending school in Portland, and then he moved down to Eugene to go 

 to the University of Oregon.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You hear from him lately?&quot;   Loper asked. 

   

 &quot;He sent me a valentine from Eugene and said he&apos;d be in town over 

 Valentine&apos;s Day.   He said he wanted to see me but he didn&apos;t call.&quot; 

   

 Tactfully Loper asked if the informant had ever been intimate with 

 Randy Woodfield. 

   

 &quot;Yes.   Once or twice.   Maybe a few more times,&quot; she said without 

 embarrassment. 

   

 &quot;Was he strange, kinky at all?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   Nothing like that.   Just normal.   He&apos;s a nice guy.   He did tell 

 me once that he&apos;d been in trouble for burglary a long time ago.&quot; 

   

 The teenager discussed her impression that Randy had been interested 

 in Julie Reitz, and she betrayed no jealousy about that.   As far as 

 she knew, he&apos;d called Julie several times. 

   

 &quot;He told me he was really serious about seeing her, He&apos;s kind of a 

 persistent guy, but Julie told me she didn&apos;t want to see him 

 again--that she didn&apos;t want a relationship with him.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What kind of a vehicle does Randy have?&quot;   Loper asked 

   

 &quot;It&apos;s a gold Volkswagen Bug--fairly new, and it has a sun roof and 

 it&apos;s kind of bashed in on the front.&quot; 

   

 Loper and Bishop found Randy Woodfield interesting.   He had admitted 

 some kind of criminal record to several friends, and he&apos;d apparently 

 betrayed an interest in pursuing their victim.   Loper talked again 

 with Julie&apos;s roommate. 

   

 &quot;Randy?&quot;   the girl said.   &quot;Sure, he&apos;s been here, but Julie didn&apos;t 

 like him.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Would she have let him in if he came knocking on the door late at 

 night?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Probably.   She didn&apos;t hate him.   She just wasn&apos;t interested in 

 having a relationship with him.   He was older, quite a bit older--and 

 he was pushy.   But I think she might have let him in.&quot; 

   

 When Loper talked next to one of Randy Woodfield&apos;s former fellow 

 employees at the Faucet, he learned of Randy&apos;s obsession with young 

 girls and of his anger at women he&apos;d dated when they rejected him. 

 That didn&apos;t necessarily stamp him as a killer, but it piqued Loper&apos;s 

 interest. 

   

 The next step was to find out just what Woodfield&apos;s criminal record 

 entailed.   On February 28 Judy Pulliam, Randy&apos;s parole officer, 

 returned Loper&apos;s call. 

   

 She related Woodfield&apos;s record, and Loper listened with fascination. 

 There had been more than burglary charges--a great deal more. 

 Woodfield had been arrested and convicted of sexual crimes, not once 

 but many times.   The exposing had escalated to the incident in the 

 park with the Portland policewoman, and he&apos;d spent time in the 

 penitentiary. 

   

 &quot;There&apos;s more,&quot; Pulliam said.   &quot;That&apos;s why I&apos;m so concerned, now that 

 I hear about your case.   Randy Woodfield was a suspect in at least 

 three homicides in Portland.   Darci Fix and Doug Altic last 

 Thanksgiving Day, and cherie Ayers a month before that.   He was 

 questioned, but he was never charged.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You say you&apos;ve had him in your caseload,&quot; Loper prompted. 

   

 &quot;Yes, but he wasn&apos;t very amenable to supervision, and I&apos;ve been 

 concerned.   He moved down to Eugene without permission.   He waited a 

 long time before notifying me of his address down there.   It was only 

 then that he requested permission to have his case transferred.   I&apos;ve 

 just transferred his case down to Tony Meyer, an investigating parole 

 officer in Eugene.&quot;   All of this was absorbing for Bishop and Loper; 

 once the name Randy Woodfield had been mentioned, a fountain of 

 information followed.   They obtained a mug shot and description of 

 Woodfield and saw a very muscular, handsome man.   Portland Detective 

 Bob Dornay acknowledged that Woodfield had been a suspect in the 

 Ayers case and that he had refused to take a polygraph.   He had 

 finally been eliminated as a suspect because of his blood type: B 

 negative. 

   

 That blood type might have eliminated him in the Ayers case; it put 

 him square in the ball park in the Reitz case. 

   

 Randy had told friends in Beaverton that he was going to rent a room 

 at the Marriott Hotel and throw his own Valentine&apos;s party on February 

 14.   That he had stayed at the Marriott was verified by hotel 

 records.   The Marriott was very close to the town house where Julie 

 had been shot. 

   

 &quot;let&apos;s go talk to him,&quot; Bishop said.   &quot;If nothing else, we can 

 eliminate him if he can come up with an alibi that works.&quot; 

   

 The Beaverton detectives called Tony Meyer, Randy Woodfield&apos;s new 

 parole officer in the Eugene area.   Meyer said that he had an 

 appointment with Woodfield at eight on the morning of March 3 for a 

 routine parole check-in.   It was agreed that Bishop and Loper would 

 be present at that meeting.   Judy Pulliam would also attend. 

   

 Whatever might come out of that meeting, it was essential that Dave 

 Bishop and Neal Loper confront Randy Woodfield.   At the very least, 

 the man was a convicted sexual deviate, an ex-con with a cavalier 

 attitude about his commitment to parole; at the very most, he might 

 be a murderer. 

   

 The I-5 Killer case was the furthest thing from their minds; they 

 wanted only to solve the murder of Julie Reitz. 

   

 It was mere coincidence that, on March 3, 1981, the I-5 investigators 

 had scheduled another joint meeting.   That meeting was held in 

 Eugene.   Although they had no way of knowing it, but all of the 

 principals--except for the victims--gathered in Eugene, Oregon, that 

 Tuesday morning.   The Eugene Police Department opened their offices 

 for the third joint meeting.   It wasn&apos;t that there was much new 

 information; it was just that the agencies involved in the search for 

 the I-5 Killer felt that a brainstorming session might help.   On the 

 face of it, they seemed no closer to catching the phantom gunman than 

 they had been four weeks earlier.   In reality, if it had been a game 

 of blindman&apos;s bluff, they were red-hot. 

   

 There had been several robberies by the man with the Band- Aid on his 

 nose in the Eugene area, and surveillance stakeouts had been in 

 operation since February 19.   Oregon state troopers had worked 

 twelve-hour shifts observing likely targets for the I-5 Killer. 

 They&apos;d staked out the Grocery Cart, Tom&apos;s Market, Dunkin&apos; Donuts, the 

 Dari-Mart, the A&amp;W Drive-in.   Hundreds of man-hours were involved, 

 long, boring hours for the troopers sitting in sneaker cars staring 

 through the windows of the brightly lit fast-food spots...waiting. 

   

 Only the night before, on March 2, Trooper Marlen Hem and Corporal A. 

 Gale Lively thought they might have been onto something.   They were 

 positioned inside the Dari-Mart at eight P.M.   when they saw a man 

 who matched the description of the suspect walk into the store.   He 

 seemed very nervous, and he kept glancing toward the storeroom area, 

 where the troopers 

 were hidden.   At length the man made a purchase and left.   They could 

 not stop him; he hadn&apos;t disobeyed the law in any way. 

   

 But they remembered him. 

   

 At the March 3 meeting, a technician from the Oregon State Crime Lab 

 announced that there was no doubt they were looking for a man with 

 type-B blood.   Tests on all the semen that had been left never varied. 

   

 &quot;We can eliminate any suspects who don&apos;t have this type blood,&quot; 

 Kominek told the group.   &quot;Only nine to ten percent of the population 

 have type B.   That will cut down considerably on the paperwork. 

 We&apos;re going to ask all of you to send your existing information to me 

 at the Marion County Sheriff&apos;s Office.   It will be programmed into a 

 computer and checked against all suspects.&quot; 

   

 In addition, it was agreed that information released to the press 

 would include nothing but location of incident, type of crime, and 

 description of the suspect. 

   

 The media weren&apos;t going to like this.   They were already badgering 

 detectives for more information on the I-5 Killer, but it was 

 essential to hold back those things known only to the killer and his 

 victims.   Should they ever get to the stage where someone confessed 

 to the crimes, such privileged information could sort out the 

 &quot;crazies&quot; from the real thing. 

   

 At the end of a long day, Kominek and Holloway drove back to Salem. 

   

 They might well have avoided the drive north.   Within hours, they 

 would be speeding back to Eugene. 

   

 14 

   

 Neal Loper and Dave Bishop arrived at the Lane County Corrections 

 Office in Eugene, and met with Judy Pulliam and Tony Meyer at 

 eight-thirty AM.   on March 3.   They waited in vain for their first 

 glimpse of the man who had once dated Julie Reitz.   Randy Woodfield 

 did not appear for his scheduled appointment. 

   

 Bishop and Loper contacted Detective Doug Ashbridge of the 

 Springfield Police Department, told him of their interest in 

 Woodfield, and Ashbridge drove by the residence on E Street. 

   

 He reported back that Woodfield&apos;s gold Volkswagen was parked 

 in the garage and the curtains of the house were drawn. 

   

 Since Randy wouldn&apos;t come to the parole officers, it was decided that 

 they would go to him.   This would be a way for Captain Bishop and 

 Detective Loper to talk with him about the Julie Reitz case.   The two 

 parole officers, accompanied by Neal Loper and Doug Ashbridge, walked 

 past the yard with its picket fence and knocked on the front door of 

 the neat rambler. 

   

 No one answered. 

   

 &quot;He&apos;s in there,&quot; Ashbridge speculated.   &quot;His car&apos;s still in the 

 garage.&quot; 

   

 They pounded on the door and the front window.   After a long time a 

 sleepy-faced Randy Woodfield opened the door.   He did not seem 

 alarmed to see his parole officer or the strangers who accompanied 

 him.   He invited them in. 

   

 &quot;Where were you, Randy?&quot;   Meyer asked.   &quot;I waited for you this 

 morning.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I thought my appointment was for this afternoon--or maybe it was for 

 tomorrow.&quot; 

   

 Meyer let it go.   He introduced Loper, and the Beaverton detective 

 explained that he was investigating the murder of Julie Reitz and 

 that their probe had to include all those who had known Julie.   Randy 

 shook his head in confusion.   He told Loper that he couldn&apos;t place 

 the name, that he didn&apos;t know anyone named Julie Reitz and he 

 couldn&apos;t see what he might have to do with her murder probe. 

   

 Loper responded casually, although he felt a thrill of excitement; he 

 had witnesses who had assured him that Julie and Randy were 

 acquainted.   &quot;Why don&apos;t you come down to the Springfield Police 

 Department and we can talk about it?   I have a picture of Julie back 

 at the office.   Maybe that will refresh your memory?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Give me a minute to get dressed, and I&apos;ll go with you,&quot; Randy said, 

 still without any outward display of anxiety. 

   

 At the Springfield station, Neal Loper advised Randy of his rights 

 under the Miranda and Escobedo decisions. 

   

 Randy said that he understood his rights and had no objection to 

 talking with the detectives.   It was just that he didn&apos;t know anyone 

 named Julie Reitz. 

   

 Loper held out a picture of Julie, one of her graduation photos. 

   

 Randy studied a picture of Julie and said that, yes, now he 

 recognized her.   He&apos;d gone out with her once.   He said he&apos;d met her 

 when he worked at the Faucet, and he admitted frankly that he&apos;d been 

 fired from the tavern the previous October. 

   

 Randy said he&apos;d been to Julie&apos;s town house only once, and that that 

 had been several months back.   &quot;It was just a small party with her 

 roommate,&quot; he recalled.   &quot;I don&apos;t remember her roommate&apos;s name. 

 There was nothing heavy about me and Julie; we were just friends.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Have you ever had sex with Julie Reitz?&quot;   Loper asked. 

   

 Randy shook his head.   &quot;Never.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did you see Julie Reitz over Valentine&apos;s Day weekend?&quot; 

   

 Again he shook his head calmly.   He hadn&apos;t seen her, and he hadn&apos;t 

 called her.   He hadn&apos;t seen Julie for months. 

   

 &quot;Could you recall your activities over that weekend?&quot; 

   

 Randy said he could.   He had gone to stay at his sister&apos;s home in 

 Portland, had gone out &quot;partying&quot; Saturday night--the fourteenth--and 

 arrived back at his sister&apos;s home around four in the morning. 

   

 &quot;You say you went partying?   Could you be more specific?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I met a friend at the Marriott--him and his wife--and had a few 

 drinks.   Then I went to several other spots in the Portland area and 

 had more drinks.   I met a girl.   Her name was Jeanie, but I can&apos;t 

 recall her last name.   She tripped around with me after that. 

 We went to Baxter&apos;s Corner, Frank Peters&apos; Inn, and the Green- wood 

 Inn.   We stayed there until the bar closed.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Where does this Jeanie live?&quot; 

   

 Randy shook his head.   &quot;We just made small talk.   I never asked her 

 last name or anything about her.   I don&apos;t know where she lives.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You hadn&apos;t heard about Julie Reitz&apos;s murder?&quot;   Captain Bishop asked. 

   

 &quot;No.   I didn&apos;t know anything about it.   Didn&apos;t hear it on the radio 

 or the TV or from anyone.&quot; 

   

 Pressed for information that might help in the investigation of 

 Julie&apos;s killing, Randy reiterated that he had known Julie only 

 casually, that he hadn&apos;t even thought about her for months.   There was 

 no way he could be involved in her murder.   The closest he&apos;d been to 

 her house on Valentine&apos;s Day was the Greenwood Inn.   

   

 &quot;I didn&apos;t even know she was murdered until you guys told me about 

 it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you own any weapons, Randy?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No, none.&quot; 

   

 Bishop and Loper asked Randy if he would be willing to give samples 

 of his hair--both head and pubic--and blood for analysis so that he 

 could be absolutely eliminated as a suspect in the Reitz case. 

   

 &quot;Will you take a polygraph test?&quot; 

   

 At first Randy agreed to cooperate, but then he equivocated.   He 

 thought perhaps he should call his attorney.   The Beaverton 

 detectives offered to make the call for him, but he decided he didn&apos;t 

 need an attorney.   They talked more about the evidence samples they 

 needed, and the lie-detector test.   At length Randy decided that he 

 wouldn&apos;t cooperate. 

   

 &quot;It&apos;s just against my principles to do that.&quot; 

   

 Bishop and Loper backed off.   Parole officers Pulliam and Meyer 

 talked to Randy next, suggesting that it might be better if he 

 returned to Portland to live, where he would be fulfilling the 

 stipulations of his early parole. 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t want to do that,&quot; he said.   &quot;But of course I will if I&apos;m 

 ordered to move back.&quot; 

   

 Randy was beginning to betray some nervousness.   He decided he might 

 cooperate with the detectives about the polygraph, but as soon as he 

 said yes, he changed his mind again. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;d rather move back to Portland,&quot; he said vehemently.   &quot;I&apos;d rather 

 go back to the penitentiary before I&apos;d do that.&quot; 

   

 An odd overreaction. 

   

 Neal Loper left the interview room for a short time, leaving Randy 

 alone with Bishop.   Casually Bishop suggested again that Randy could 

 clear himself of any connection with Julie&apos;s murder if he would be 

 willing to give hair and blood samples. 

   

 Randy was getting nervous, beginning to trip himself up.   At one 

 point he blurted to Dave Bishop, &quot;Just because I had sex with her...I 

 wouldn&apos;t have killed her.&quot; 

   

 He had given away too much.   He had denied sexual intimacy with the 

 victim.   Now he had admitted it. 

   

 Bishop let it pass.   Given enough rope, Randy Woodfield might just 

 twine it around his own neck. 

   

 Randy seemed relieved when the questions ended, and he consented 

 readily to have the residence on E Street searched. 

   

 &quot;Go ahead and search,&quot; he said.   &quot;I&apos;m curious to see what you could 

 possibly hope to find.   I have nothing to hide.&quot; 

   

 Neal Loper, Doug Ashbridge, and Detective Tom Maloney of the 

 Springfield Police Department conducted this first preliminary 

 search.   While Randy Woodfield watched, Neal Loper retained the 

 following items and logged them into evidence: 

   

 Item 1: One set of bedsheets and a mattress pad from subject&apos;s 

 bedroom.   On mattress pad some dried blood.   Sheets contain many head 

 and pubic hairs. 

   

 Item 2: One set of sheets from hamper next to bed. 

   

 Item 3: One brown wallet containing identification and a receipt for 

 the purchase of a gun.   (.22-caliber handgun from G.I.   Joe&apos;s Store 

 in the Portland area.) 

   

 Item 4: One smoking device, (Bong) with residue. 

   

 Item 5: One box of athletic adhesive tape. 

   

 Item 6: A paper bag containing a .38-caliber or .357caliber 

 gun-cleaning kit. 

   

 Item 7: A cocaine snorter (from vehicle glove compartment).   

   

 Item 8:   One box of firecrackers out of the glove compartment of vehicle. 

   

 Asked about the gun-cleaning kit, Randy seemed evasive; he thought it 

 was probably something he&apos;d used before he&apos;d gone to prison in 1975 

 and that it happened to still be among his possessions.   The item 

 seized that appeared to bother him the most was the adhesive tape. 

 He questioned the detectives closely about why they would have taken 

 something as prosaic as adhesive tape as evidence.   They replied 

 casually that it was something that might prove valuable to them. 

   

 Indeed, when Loper had seen that tape, bells had rung in his head. 

 He had come down searching for some clue to Julie Reitz&apos;s murder 

 only.   But he and Bishop, like every lawman in the state, had seen 

 the composite pictures of the I-5 Killer, the man who invariably 

 disguised himself with the use of tape or Band-Aids across his nose, 

 the man who bound his victims with the same tape. 

   

 Was it possible that they had stumbled across a much bigger fish than 

 they realized?   Randy Woodfield&apos;s verbal consent to search his home 

 had given them a great legal boost.   Had they come in with a search 

 warrant, they would have been able to seize only those items 

 specifically listed in the warrant.   But Randy&apos;s own assumption that 

 he had nothing to fear from the cops had allowed them to seize 

 anything they found.   He seemed nervous about the tape, very nervous, 

 but he dared not refuse to let them take it.   There had been six 

 rolls of tape in the box; one was missing.   They could see that Randy 

 was trying to pretend he wasn&apos;t antsy about the tape. 

   

 He failed in that area.   The man was clearly covering up something. 

   

 What was it? 

   

 Randy Woodfield drove off in his fancy gold Beetle.   Legally, he was 

 free to go.   He had lied initially about knowing Julie Reitz, but it 

 was within the realm of possibility that a man who dated scores of 

 women might forget the name of one.   The adhesive tape might match 

 the torn edges of bonds retrieved from victims, and it might not, but 

 lab analysis would take time. 

   

 Clearly Bishop and Loper needed more information.   They drove back to 

 the little rambler in Springfield. 

   

 Randy Woodfield&apos;s car was neither in the garage nor parked on the 

 street near the house on E Street an hour later when Dave Bishop, 

 Neal Loper, and Doug Ashbridge set up a discreet stakeout so that 

 they could observe the comings and goings of the occupants. 

   

 Three P.M.   No sign of activity. 

   

 At three-thirty-four a small boy hopped off the school bus and headed 

 for the front door.   The detectives spoke with him, and he told them 

 he was Mickey Bates, six years old.   &quot;My mom&apos;s at work,&quot; he said.   &quot;I 

 stay with the neighbors till she gets home.&quot; 

   

 Mickey told the investigators that Randy had lived in a room in their 

 house for about a month. 

   

 &quot;Where does he go when he goes to work?&quot;   Bishop asked. 

   

 The boy shrugged.   &quot;He doesn&apos;t work.   He plays ball with us.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Have you ever seen any of Randy&apos;s guns?&quot;   Loper asked.   &quot;Does he 

 have guns like the cops do on television?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   Randy doesn&apos;t have any guns.&quot; 

   

 The boy skipped off, unfazed at the sight of three detectives 

 watching his house. 

   

 At five-twenty-four Arden Bates drove up.   The trio of detectives 

 identified themselves and explained they wanted to talk with her 

 about her roomer.   Oddly, she did not seem surprised to find that 

 police were checking on Randy.   She had become a little suspicious of 

 his activities herself, she said. 

   

 Arden explained that she&apos;d met Randy by placing an ad in the paper 

 seeking a roomer.   She didn&apos;t know where his money came from; he had 

 said that he received a small stipend from state unemployment, and 

 she thought maybe his parents helped him out.   &quot;But he spends an 

 awful lot of money,&quot; she blurted.   &quot;I don&apos;t know where it all comes 

 from.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What does he do with his time?&quot;   Bishop asked. 

   

 &quot;I think he goes to college or is planning on going to college.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What about girlfriends?   Women?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ve seen a few he brought to the house.&quot; 

   

 &quot;They stay overnight?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t think so.   I go to bed early because I work hard.   But...no, 

 I don&apos;t think so.&quot; 

   

 And then the vital question regarding the Julie Reitz case. 

   

 &quot;Do you know where Randy was over Valentine&apos;s Day weekend?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I think it&apos;s quite possible he went to Portland.&quot; 

   

 Bishop had an inspiration, one that would prove to be the turning 

 point not only in his case but also in so many others.   He asked if 

 Randy Woodfield ever charged long-distance phone calls to Arden&apos;s 

 bill, and she said that he did often.   &quot;He calls long distance all 

 the time.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Would it be possible for us to take a look at your last phone bill?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Sure.   It&apos;s in the house.&quot; 

   

 Arden handed Bishop the phone bill with calls billed through the 

 middle of February.   He scanned it quickly, looking for calls to 

 Beaverton.   There were none.   But one entry caught his eye.   There 

 was a third-party charge from Mt.   Shasta, California, billing the 

 call to Arden Bates&apos;s phone.   The date was February 3.   Something 

 clicked in his head.   &quot;Shasta&quot; and &quot;February 3.&quot; 

   

 The I-5 Killer was supposed to have hit near Lake Shasta in the early 

 part of February! 

   

 Bishop looked up suddenly and saw Arden Bates staring back at him. 

 She was shivering involuntarily. 

   

 &quot;It&apos;s him, isn&apos;t it?&quot;   she breathed.   &quot;Randy&apos;s the I-5 Killer, isn&apos;t 

 he?   I&apos;ve been afraid of that, but I didn&apos;t want to say it out loud.&quot; 

   

 Bishop would neither confirm nor deny his own feelings.   &quot;Can we have 

 this phone bill?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Sure, take it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;We&apos;d like to talk to you down at the police station, Mrs. Bates,&quot; 

 Bishop said quietly.   &quot;I think it would be wise if you and Mickey 

 moved out of here for a while.   Can you find another place to stay 

 for a few nights?&quot; 

   

 She nodded, rubbing the goose pimples that dotted her arms. 

   

 &quot;Good.   The sooner you and Mickey can get out of here, the better.&quot; 

   

 Doug Ashbridge arranged for a continuous surveillance of the 

 residence by Springfield police.   It was not yet time to arrest Randy 

 Woodfield; that would be premature.   But the officers wanted to be 

 sure where he was. 

   

 Arden Bates threw some clothing into an overnight bag and hurried her 

 son out to her car.   She turned back and looked at Dave Bishop and 

 Neal Loper.   &quot;You know, he&apos;s a really nice guy.   I liked him right 

 away when he came to rent the room.   If you met him, you wouldn&apos;t even 

 think he could do anything violent.   You don&apos;t think he ever would 

 have hurt us, do you?   You don&apos;t really think it&apos;s him, do you?   This 

 is just a maybe isn&apos;t it?&quot; 

   

 Loper smiled at her.   &quot;It&apos;s just a maybe.   We only want to be 

 absolutely sure you and Mickey are safe.   When we check out the phone 

 numbers, and when we talk with some of the other detectives on the 

 case, we&apos;ll know more.&quot; 

   

 &quot;But,&quot; she argued, &quot;if he was a killer, I would have known it, 

 wouldn&apos;t I?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Loper said honestly.   &quot;That&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to 

 find out.&quot; 

   

   

 15 

   

 Back at the Springfield Police Department, Loper and Bishop put 

 through an immediate call to Redding, California.   The phone call 

 from Mt.   Shasta might prove to be the one clue that scores of 

 detectives in the Northwest had been seeking.   When they reached 

 Detective Ron Kingsley at the Shasta County Sheriff&apos;s Office, they 

 asked him to check the reverse directory there to see where Randy 

 Woodfield had been when he made a phone call and charged it to his 

 landlady&apos;s Eugene number. 

   

 Loper told Kingsley the phone number.   &quot;Our man made that call from 

 Mt.   Shasta on February 3 shortly after nine P.M.&quot; 

   

 &quot;That&apos;s the night of our double homicide in Mountain Gate!&quot;   Kingsley 

 responded. 

   

 &quot;That&apos;s why we thought this was so important,&quot; Loper agreed.   &quot;Call 

 us back when you trace the number.&quot; 

   

 Kingsley called back within minutes.   The call had been made from a 

 phone booth in Jerry&apos;s Restaurant in Mt.   Shasta.   &quot;It&apos;s just a fluke 

 that you picked up on it,&quot; Kingsley explained.   &quot;The name &apos;Shasta.&apos; 

 Actually, Mt.   Shasta is more than fifty miles north of our crime 

 scene, up the I-5.   The timing&apos;s right.   Our victims were killed 

 between six and nine P.M.   Keep in touch.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You bet.   We&apos;ll pass information along the minute we get it.&quot;   Dave 

 Bishop and Neal Loper had gone to Eugene to eliminate Randy Woodfield 

 as a suspect in the murder of Julie Reitz.   Instead of eliminating 

 him, they&apos;d found he looked good.   Now, eight hours later, they found 

 themselves deep in the middle of the biggest case going in Oregon, 

 Washington, and California.   Was it possible that Randy Woodfield was 

 the I-5 Killer? 

   

 Dave Kominek and Monty Holloway had barely arrived back in Salem 

 after the day-long meeting in Eugene when the call came from Dave 

 Bishop and Neal Loper. 

   

 &quot;Can you get back down here?   We may have something for you.   We have 

 a suspect under surveillance who may look awfully good to you.   The 

 man looks like your composites, and we can place him in Shasta County 

 on February 3.&quot; 

   

 Kominek and Holloway didn&apos;t stop to change clothes.   They expected to 

 be back in Salem later that night.   They called Lieutenant Kilburn 

 McCoy to tell him they were heading back to Eugene and that they&apos;d 

 keep him informed.   Kominek left Salem with seventeen dollars in his 

 wallet and no credit cards; he didn&apos;t expect to need much money 

 during one evening in Eugene. 

   

 He didn&apos;t know he wouldn&apos;t see Salem again for almost a week. 

   

 When the Marion County detectives reached the Springfield Police 

 Department, the probe went into high gear.   They talked with Arden 

 Bates and went over the dates when Randy Woodfield had been away from 

 her home.   Every out-of-town crime had occurred on those nights. 

 According to Mrs. Bates, Randy was an inveterate traveler on the I-5 

 freeway. 

   

 Kominek looked at the mug shot of Randy Woodfield, and the skin 

 prickled on the back of his neck.   He saw that the eyes, the facial 

 features, the coloring, the hair, the thick neck, and the broad 

 shoulders were just like those of the composites he had begun to see 

 even in his sleep. 

   

 Randy Brent Woodfield.   An ex-con who&apos;d been sent up for robbery, but 

 the man&apos;s criminal history had revealed that there had been 

 oral-sodomy charges which were dropped.   That would explain why 

 Kominek and Holloway hadn&apos;t found Woodfield&apos;s name in their massive 

 search of parolee records; they&apos;d been checking murderers and sex 

 offenders.   The sex charges on Woodfield hadn&apos;t been in the computer. 

   

 And there was more, so much more.   According to medical records at 

 the Oregon State Penitentiary, Woodfield had B-negative blood, just 

 like the phantom man they&apos;d been seeking; he drove a Volkswagen Bug, 

 and, perhaps most telling, Neal Loper had seized a large roll of 

 adhesive tape when he searched Woodfield&apos;s bedroom. 

   

 Dave Bishop held out the phone bill that Arden Bates had turned over 

 to him.   &quot;He made a lot of calls.&quot; 

   

 Excited, Kominek ran his finger down the list of calls.   On January 

 18, the night Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot had been shot, Randy 

 Woodfield had called a Salem number at 9:01 P.M.   from Independence, 

 Oregon.   He&apos;d called a Newberg number an hour and a half later from 

 Woodburn, north of Salem on the I-5.   God, 

 the man left a blueprint of his travels up and down the freeway!   On 

 January 28 he called to Medford, and there were collect calls from 

 Medford Grants Pass, Ashland, Yreka, and Redding between January 29 

 and February 4. 

   

 Kominek had memorized the roster of crimes and their dates, and the 

 calls followed the lineup perfectly. 

   

 It was going to take thousands of man-hours to find out whom Randy 

 had visited along the freeway and to verify his locations, but the 

 hole in the dike was there.   The torrent of information had begun to 

 flow. 

   

 The meeting in the Springfield police offices was fraught with 

 subdued excitement and tension.   Attending were detectives James 

 Callahan, Jerry Smith, Doug Ashbridge, and Chief Brian Riley from the 

 Springfield department; Pat Horton, district attorney of Lane County; 

 Tony Meyer, Woodfield&apos;s Eugene parole officer; Detective Ron Griesel 

 from the Eugene Police Department; Dennis O&apos;Donnell from the Oregon 

 State Police in Eugene; Chuck Vaughn and Jim Pex from the Oregon 

 State Police Crime Lab; Captain Dave Bishop and Detective Neal Loper 

 from the Beaverton Police Department; and Dave Kominek and Monty 

 Holloway from the Marion County Sheriff&apos;s Office in Salem. 

   

 The lawmen stared at the blackboard in front of them and watched the 

 damning circumstantial evidence against Randall Brent Woodfield 

 mount, bits and pieces supplied by various detectives. 

   

 Arden Bates: Subject conducts his activities late at night.   Subject 

 leaves her residence on dates corresponding with the attacks by the 

 I-5 Killer. 

   

 Subject drives a Volkswagen Bug. 

   

 Subject was in Mt.   Shasta just after California murders in Mountain 

 Gate. 

   

 Subject en route to Medford at time of Medford and Grants Pass 

 robberies. 

   

 Subject&apos;s prior behavior pattern fits psychological profile 

 established for the I-5 Killer. 

   

 Beaverton victim shot in the back of the head.   Previous victims have 

 been shot in back of head, temple, or right side of head. 

   

 Subject fits same physical description of I-5 Killer: 6&apos;1&quot; to 6&apos;2&quot; 

 170 pounds, athletic. 

   

 I-5 Killer wore gloves similar in all respects to racquetball gloves 

 Subject plays racquetball frequently 

   

 Subject has B-negative blood, according to prison records 

   

 It looked promising.   Hell, Kominek thought, it looks perfect.   The 

 thing to do was to move immediately for a search warrant of the house 

 on E Street and gather more physical evidence before Woodfield had 

 time to destroy it.   Dave Bishop agreed with Kominek, as did Ron 

 Griesel of the Eugene Police Department.   They could get a search 

 warrant easily enough with Pat Horton, the Lane County district 

 attorney, right in the meeting. 

   

 And then the specter of territorial rights raised its ugly head. 

 Some of the authorities in the Eugene area were bristling; their 

 feeling was that the detectives from Beaverton and Salem were 

 treading on their turf.   Bishop and Loper had informed the 

 Springfield Police Department of their intent to question Woodfield, 

 but they had not told Eugene and Lane County authorities before the 

 fact.   This suspect might well have committed offenses in other 

 areas, but he was in Lane County now, and whatever would be done with 

 him should be up to Lane County.   D.A.   Pat Horton was not amenable 

 to direction from detectives from other jurisdictions.   He wanted 

 them to play a waiting game.   Horton pointed out that Woodfield was 

 home, asleep probably, in the house.   He was under constant 

 surveillance by officers watching in sneaker cars.   if he left the 

 house, he would be followed.   There was no tearing hurry now. 

   

 Horton would not be talked out of his stance.   There was a question 

 as to whom the subject belonged to.   He was a major catch.   The 

 jurisdiction that actually arrested him could count on headlines and 

 kudos. 

   

 Now the jealousies flared up.   A turf war.   It had happened in Los 

 Angeles when county and city wrangled over whom Charlie Manson 

 belonged to, and it had happened in the Ted Bundy case when dozens of 

 departments sought him. 

   

 Horton was adamant that they would do it his way.   Lane County would 

 call the shots. 

   

 The days that followed would be, perhaps, the most agonizing of the 

 entire probe for Kominek and Holloway.   Parole officer Tony Meyer 

 said he would be willing to arrest Woodfield, as he had violated his 

 parole by moving to Eugene without permission, but Horton vetoed 

 that.   The Marion County detectives thought they had their man, but 

 they were being blocked from moving in and arresting him.   Bishop and 

 Loper figured that Woodfield was the man they sought.   It was not a 

 situation of give and take, it was a tug-of-war, and Randy Woodfield 

 was the prize. 

   

 Springfield Police Chief Brian Riley, described by Kominek as 

 &quot;probably the most professional police chief I&apos;ve ever encountered,&quot; 

 tried to calm the troubled waters.   The meeting broke up at three 

 A.M.   on that first night.   It was finally agreed that Woodfield 

 would be left alone--but watched--and the detectives would meet again 

 the next day. 

   

 Chuck Vaughn and Jim Pex would work all night to analyze the blood 

 and semen stains and to try to match pubic hairs found on Randy 

 Woodfield&apos;s sheets to hairs retrieved in the assault on the two young 

 girls in Corvallis.   Monty Holloway would fly out to Spokane, 

 Washington, at five A.M.   in a state-police plane through a driving 

 snowstorm to contact Beth Wilmot so that she could look at a mug 

 lay-down which included Randy Woodfield&apos;s picture.   Dave Kominek 

 would stand pat in Eugene; he could not risk driving back to Salem 

 for fear the suspect would again slip through his grasp.   D.A. 

 Horton had promised that Kominek and Ron Griesel would be allowed to 

 interview Woodfield the next day. 

   

 Kominek put in a call to Portland to Detective Sergeant Rod Englert 

 of the Multnomah County Sheriff&apos;s Office.   &quot;Rod, get down here,&quot; he 

 said fervently.   &quot;We&apos;re going to need you as a referee.   Your county 

 is one that doesn&apos;t want the I-5 Killer, so you can be an impartial 

 mediator.   I think we&apos;ve got him.   I&apos;m sure of it, but we may be 

 losing our momentum.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m on my way,&quot; Englert promised, already shrugging on his clothes. 

   

 And then Dave Kominek realized, at four A.M., that he had no funds, 

 not even enough to get a cheap motel room.   Chief Brian Riley grinned 

 and offered him the hospitality of the Springfield jail for the four 

 hours until dawn.   Not fancy, but warm and dry.   Kominek accepted.   A 

 jail bunk was better than the backseat of his car. 

   

 Exhausted, Kominek fell fast asleep on the hard bunk.   As a 

 professional courtesy, the cell door was left wide open; The fact 

 that a killer who had dismembered his wife was just down the corridor 

 was the least of Kominek&apos;s concerns; the mutilation killer&apos;s cell was 

 locked. 

   

 Kominek laughs when he remembers the comedy of errors that ensued. 

 &quot;I snore like a truck, and I woke up to see the female dispatcher 

 from Springfield staring at me with a look of panic on her face.   She 

 hadn&apos;t seen me come in, she didn&apos;t know who I was, and she thought 

 that I was a dangerous felon lying there snoring in an open cell, 

 likely to wake up at any minute and run amok.   Luckily somebody told 

 her I was one of the good guys.&quot; 

   

 Kominek started his second day in Eugene with only three hours of 

 sleep in thirty-six hours. 

   

 Marion County D.A; Chris Van Dyke drove down to Eugene from Salem to 

 back Dave Kominek.   The district attorney from Corvallis, Peter 

 Sandrock, with his investigator, Randy Martinek, arrived from that 

 city to attempt to issue a search warrant on Woodfield&apos;s home. 

   

 D.A.   Horton was still insisting that there would be no action. 

 Woodfield was to be observed, and that was all.   Around-the- clock 

 surveillance continued.   Randy Woodfield was followed surreptitiously 

 wherever he went.   Tempers were unraveling on that second day.   When 

 Horton said that he thought he would send all outside detectives home 

 and turn the investigation over to his men and the Oregon State 

 Police, Kominek and Bishop neared their boiling point.   What Horton 

 was suggesting was akin to calling a hunting dog out of a fox hunt 

 after he&apos;d finally run his quarry to earth. 

   

 &quot;It was our case,&quot; Kominek says quietly.   &quot;Monty and I had worked it 

 for months, day and night.   We had all the information, we were 

 closing in, and we were told to go home and let somebody else take 

 over.&quot; 

   

 The press had picked up the scent, and they hovered outside the 

 Springfield police offices, which had become the focal point of a 

 circus of black comedy. 

   

 The pressure to move was accentuated by the avid interest of the 

 media.   Since a news story had appeared in Salem on March 4 saying 

 that Kominek and Holloway were on the way north into Washington State 

 to check out leads there on the I-5 Killer, reporters had not given 

 much weight to the activity in Eugene.   But then a reporter who knew 

 him spotted Kominek in Eugene.   The Oregon press knew that Dave Kominek 

 headed the I-5 task force.   That had to mean that something big was 

 coming down, that possibly police had homed in on the I-5 Killer. 

 Reporters demanded quotes.   If the I-5 Killer was in Eugene, they 

 argued 

 the public had a right to know.   Indeed, the whole case was almost 

 blown when a television 

 news crew unknowingly parked next to Randy&apos;s gold Volkswagen in a 

 theater parking lot while he was inside watching a film with one of 

 his girlfriends.   Watching police waited, hoping that their suspect 

 wouldn&apos;t emerge from the theater, spot the TV crew, and be alerted 

 that he was under surveillance.   Officers rushed the reporter and 

 cameraman away, giving rise to more questions from the crew. 

   

 If Randy knew that he was the focal point of such a massive 

 investigation, he might destroy every scintilla of physical evidence. 

   

 All Randy really knew was that Beaverton police had connected him 

 only tenuously to Julie Reitz.   He thought he had carried off that 

 interview rather well.   He was a little nervous when he realized that 

 Arden Bates and her son had left the house.   He wondered why Arden 

 was gone, but it wasn&apos;t a big worry...Arden knew nothing at all 

 about him. 

  

 On March 4 the Eugene Register Guard carried a banner headline across 

 the top of the front page: &quot;POLICE HINT OF BREAK IN BANDIT CASE.&quot;   The 

 paper hit the street at twelve-thirty in the afternoon. 

   

 Forced to do something to stall the press, Chief Brian Riley held a 

 news conference. 

   

 &quot;The investigation has taken a significant turn today,&quot; he said 

 carefully.   &quot;But it is not over by any stretch of the imagination. 

 There is a lot of hard work left to be done.   No charges have been 

 filed.&quot; 

   

 That afternoon, the papers and a television anchorman announced to 

 the public--and undoubtedly to the suspect--that police were 

 questioning a man named &quot;Randy.&quot; 

   

 Reporters tried to find out just who Arden Bates might be and where 

 she might have gone.   They found the house on E Street and camped out 

 alongside the surveillance officers, waiting, like everyone else, to 

 see what would happen next.   What had begun as a methodical, careful 

 investigation was rapidly turning into a Keystone Kops comedy.   The 

 Springfield neighborhood was crawling with reporters, each hoping to 

 find out more about the man named Randy who lived there.   Neighbors 

 were being interviewed about what they might know of the occupants 

 of the house at 3622 E Street.   They commented cryptically that Arden 

 Bates and her son, Mickey, had lived there.   &quot;But they&apos;re not there 

 now; nobody knows what happened to them.&quot; 

   

 Neighbor boys told reporters about the nice guy who lived there, an 

 ex-pro football player whom they all liked.   It was hard for the 

 press to contain itself. 

   

 Inside his house, Randy Woodfield stayed behind drawn curtains.   He 

 called Shelley in New Mexico and told her to come ahead on up to 

 Eugene.   He told her nothing about the trouble; he only told her that 

 they would have to live in Portland because his parole officer was 

 hounding him.   Joyously she packed her car, rented a trailer, and 

 began the long drive to Oregon.   She had not the 

 slightest idea that her best beloved was the focal point of the most 

 massive police investigation in Oregon history. 

   

 At noon on the third day, Dave Bishop and Dave Kominek &quot;pulled the 

 plug&quot; on District Attorney Pat Horton. 

   

 &quot;It was our case,&quot; Kominek recalls.   &quot;We said the hell with it, and 

 we moved.   The press could sense it.   Suddenly everybody was doing 

 something.   We told people who would do what and who was going to go 

 where.   We couldn&apos;t just sit there and watch Randy Woodfield.&quot; 

   

 The break with Horton was complete, but Kominek felt he had no other 

 choice.   Bishop backed him.   Van Dyke backed him.   Englert backed him. 

   

 At a quarter to two on the afternoon of March 5, Dave Kominek came 

 face to face with Randy Woodfield for the first time.   He and Ron 

 Griesel of the Eugene Police Department knocked on the door of the 

 house on E Street.   Woodfield opened it and ushered the two 

 detectives into the living room.   He was calm, and he was polite.   He 

 nodded slightly when Kominek told him that his appearance and 

 physical stature matched those of a man they sought. 

   

 And indeed Woodfield did resemble the composite in every detail. 

 Kominek was astounded to see this man in person.   He thought he could 

 have picked him out of a crowd anytime.   The man was muscular, 

 obviously an athlete, and he could have posed for the composites 

 retrieved from all the cases up and down the I-5.   The Marion County 

 detective waited for Randy Woodfield to speak. 

   

 Woodfield did not seem overtly hostile, but he betrayed anxiety when 

 he demanded to know why the Beaverton detectives had taken his 

 gun-cleaning kit and his athletic adhesive tape.   &quot;They took all the 

 rolls I had.   I can&apos;t understand it; one roll should have been 

 enough.&quot; 

   

 Was it possible that Randy Woodfield was savvy enough about physical 

 evidence to know that torn edges of tape can be matched absolutely to 

 the roll from which segments have come?   Kominek replied that he 

 could not comment on Beaverton&apos;s motives. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m probably going to be violated on my parole, and it&apos;s not my 

 fault.   She told me I had to go back to Portland, and I was going to 

 leave this morning, and then they told me I could go later,&quot; Randy 

 complained.   &quot;The police are following me around.   I think it&apos;s the 

 Beaverton guys.   The neighbor kid came over and 

 said the police were watching me and they think I&apos;m the I-5 Bandit.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did the Beaverton officers look through your house here?&quot;   Kominek 

 asked. 

   

 &quot;Yes, they did.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Would you have any objection to our taking a look?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   I&apos;ll show you around.&quot; 

   

 Randy gave Griesel and Kominek a guided tour.   He showed them his 

 Green Bay Packers souvenirs, and he bragged about his gold 

 Volkswagen, explaining that it was a limited-edition Super Beetle. 

 &quot;A friend did that damage to the front end.   I may sue him, because 

 he wasn&apos;t covered by insurance.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What made you decide to move down to Eugene?&quot;   Griesel asked. 

   

 &quot;I was trying to find work so I could go on to college at the same 

 time.   I&apos;ve applied for jobs at O&apos;Callahan&apos;s, De Frisco&apos;s, the 

 Atrium, and the Tavern on the Green.   I&apos;m going to get my degree in 

 P.E., and I hope to manage an athletic club--like one that has 

 racquetball, for instance.&quot; 

   

 The conversation moved along easily now.   The detectives could see 

 that Randy was in his element when he talked about sports, and they 

 threw out questions.   He brought up the Packers and said he probably 

 should have stayed with basketball instead of football.   The three 

 men discussed topics that all men talk about, and Kominek had a 

 little trouble now believing that Randy Woodfield could be the man he 

 had sought for so long.   Woodfield certainly looked just like the man 

 they were looking for, but the guy was calm, pleasant, companionable. 

 Could they have zeroed in on the wrong man after all?   It would be a 

 long time before Kominek could be sure; he would have to wait until, 

 in this conversation, or the next, or the next, Woodfield either 

 vindicated himself or wove himself a trap. 

   

 Kominek asked Randy about his prior arrest record, and Randy admitted 

 the exposing incidents and the armed robbery that had sent him to 

 prison.   And then Randy soberly explained that all of his sexual 

 problems were in the past.   &quot;I&apos;ll never do that kind of stuff again. 

 I don&apos;t have a problem anymore.&quot; 

   

 Kominek glanced casually around the room.   His heart sank when he 

 saw the fresh ashes in the fireplace and the can of lighter fluid on 

 the hearth.   &quot;Looks like you had a fire,&quot; he remarked. 

   

 &quot;No.   The landlady&apos;s kid plays in the fireplace a lot.   He 

 probably left that stuff there.   The wood in the garage is so green, 

 we have to use lighter fluid to get it going.&quot; 

   

 Kominek let it pass.   Whatever had gone up in flames, it was too late 

 now--too late unless the lab guys might be able to retrieve something 

 from analysis of the ashes.   Probably the fake beard, the hats, the 

 hooded jackets were gone forever.   Damn. 

   

 &quot;Your landlady&apos;s not here?&quot; 

   

 Randy shrugged.   &quot;I don&apos;t know where she is.   I haven&apos;t seen her in 

 two days.   I&apos;m probably going to get evicted.   Do you know where she 

 is?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I think the Beaverton police have talked to her.   They probably know 

 where she is.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Are you going to violate my parole?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Kominek said truthfully.   &quot;I hear they found a bong or 

 some dope or something when they searched your room.&quot; 

   

 Randy said nothing.   Most men would be sweating buckets by now, but 

 Woodfield continued to be soft-spoken and amiable.   When he talked 

 about sports, he took on a kind of glow.   He was a likable man. 

 Kominek could see why others--men and women might be drawn to him. 

 He had somehow expected a rougher, cruder man. 

   

 Randy&apos;s friendly acquiescence disappeared, however, when Kominek 

 pressed a little harder. 

   

 &quot;Randall, would you give us a hair sample so we could eliminate you 

 as a suspect in the I-5 case?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t do that.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Would you submit to a polygraph?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Could you account for your whereabouts on certain dates?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Only if I could find notes on the dates you might be interested in.&quot; 

 Woodfield stood up.   &quot;I think I&apos;ve answered enough of your 

 questions.   I can&apos;t see what this has to do with me.&quot; 

   

 Dave Kominek advised Randy Woodfield of his rights under Miranda. 

 &quot;Do you have any questions?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No, I understand.&quot;   Randy signed the Miranda card, but only with his 

 first name.   Oddly, considering how much he hated the diminutive of 

 his name, he signed it &quot;Randy.&quot; 

   

 Kominek asked if Randy had contacted anyone in Salem recently, and he 

 replied that he had a grandmother and an aunt and uncle there, and 

 that he tried to keep in touch with them. 

   

 &quot;Have you ever been to Corvallis, Randy?&quot;   Griesel asked. 

   

 &quot;Never.   I don&apos;t know anyone in that area.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Have you ever been to Seattle?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Tacoma?&quot; 

   

 &quot;My best friend lives there.   He&apos;s an assistant professor at Pacific 

 Lutheran University, and the long-distance track coach.&quot; 

   

 &quot;How long since you&apos;ve visited him?&quot;   

   

 &quot;I can&apos;t recall.   He came to Portland to visit me.&quot; 

   

 &quot;How about Albany?   Ever stopped for coffee or anything there?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   Don&apos;t know anyone there.&quot; 

   

 &quot;When was the last time you went to Portland?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Last weekend.   My parents just got back from a tour of Taiwan.&quot; 

   

 Asked about his female friends, Randy told them about Shelley and 

 about a young woman who worked as a baby-sitter in Eugene.   The 

 conversation about girlfriends eased the tension in the room a 

 little.   And then Kominek asked a question that made Woodfield 

 tighten up again. 

   

 &quot;When was the last time you were in Redding?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Redding?   California?   I--can&apos;t really remember.   It&apos;s been quite a 

 while.&quot; 

   

 &quot;We understand you made a trip to California.   You didn&apos;t stop in 

 Redding?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I told you I don&apos;t remember.&quot; 

   

 He was lying.   Every line in his body said lie.   He froze up almost 

 imperceptibly when the towns where major assaults had occurred were 

 mentioned. 

   

 Kominek saw Woodfield&apos;s unease and deftly switched topics.   &quot;You have 

 any other kinds of tape around here?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Strong tape-like they use for packages.   Strapping tape.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What kind of hat do you usually wear?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t wear hats.   They smash my Afro down.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Is that natural curl or a permanent?&quot; 

   

 &quot;It&apos;s naturally curly.&quot;   He was lying again.   Why?   &quot;I&apos;m going to get 

 it Cut today because my girlfriend is coming up.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Have you ever had sex with a girl in this house?&quot;   Griesel asked 

 suddenly. 

   

 &quot;No.   I never had sex with my landlady.&quot; 

   

 &quot;When was the last time you had sex?&quot; 

   

 Randy stared back at Kominek.   &quot;That&apos;s none of your business.   I 

 think I&apos;ve answered enough questions.&quot; 

   

 &quot;We&apos;re taking you into custody on parole violation,&quot; Griesel 

 said, slipping handcuffs on Randy&apos;s incongruously slender forearms. 

   

 &quot;I expected that.   I&apos;m not going anywhere,&quot; Woodfield said calmly. 

 &quot;I might as well go with you.&quot; 

   

 When they headed for the Springfield police station, Dave Kominek&apos;s 

 elation at having the prime suspect under arrest was considerably 

 dampened by the memory of the ashes he&apos;d seen in the fireplace on E 

 Street.   There had been a lot of ashes; Randy Woodfield could have 

 burned items that might have been pure gold as evidence.   Sure, 

 Horton&apos;s surveillance tactics had kept Woodfield under constant 

 observation--he hadn&apos;t bolted--but all the officers in the world 

 watching him could not have stopped him from destroying evidence. 

   

 Too late now. 

   

   

 16 

   

 On this, the third day of the intensive investigation in Eugene, 

 Randy Woodfield was placed in an interview room in the Springfield 

 Police Department.   The room had a one-way-mirror viewing area, 

 and conversation could be monitored by someone outside the room. 

 Beaverton detectives Dave Bishop and Neal Loper, and Detective 

 Sergeant Randy Martinek of the Benton County Sheriff&apos;s Office in 

 Corvallis listened as Kominek and Ron Griesel talked with the tall, 

 curly-haired suspect.   Would he say something, betray guilt in some 

 slip of the tongue?   He seemed relaxed; if he was not actually 

 enjoying the session with Kominek and Griesel, he was certainly not 

 showing outward tension. 

   

 Again Randy Woodfield was advised of his rights under Miranda and 

 asked if he wished to consult an attorney.   He did not want an 

 attorney but he asked to call a young woman who could contact his 

 friends.   &quot;I want Jennifer to get hold of Shelley.   Shelley&apos;s on her 

 way up here from New Mexico with a U-Haul trailer.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What&apos;s Jennifer&apos;s number?   We&apos;ll call her and you can talk to her.&quot; 

   

 Randy shook his head.   &quot;She&apos;s hard to get hold of.   She&apos;s a college 

 student.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You&apos;re sure?   We&apos;ll call anyone you like.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I can call her later.   Ask me what you want to know.&quot; 

   

 Kominek began.   &quot;Randy, we&apos;re basically trying to pinpoint where you 

 were on certain dates and times.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I could give you any information you need to prove I&apos;m innocent if I 

 have to.&quot; 

   

 &quot;If you&apos;re innocent, we could check out those dates and locations to 

 verify your innocence, and that could establish alibis for you.   It 

 would help us too; we need this information now to move ahead with 

 our investigation.   If we can eliminate you as a suspect, we can keep 

 on going looking for the man we&apos;re after,&quot; 

 Kominek said. 

   

 &quot;I know my parole is going to be violated,&quot; Randy said.   &quot;I know I&apos;m 

 going back to the joint.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Whose fault is that?&quot;   Griesel asked. 

   

 Woodfield winced.   &quot;My own.   It really doesn&apos;t bother me, but it 

 looks like my world is going to be inside for quite a while.&quot; 

   

 &quot;If you were sure you were going back, why did you wait for us at the 

 house today?&quot;   Kominek asked. 

   

 &quot;It wouldn&apos;t do any good to run, so I just waited for some officer to 

 come and get me.&quot; 

   

 Randy&apos;s reaction was rather flat; he was portraying himself as the 

 poor beleaguered ex-con whose only crime had been moving without 

 notifying his parole officer.   He was sorry for himself, but said he 

 assumed that&apos;s the way things went for ex-cons. 

   

 &quot;Have you been working at all down here, Randy?&quot;   Griesel asked. 

   

 &quot;Not yet, but I&apos;ve been looking for a job.   And I&apos;ve been playing 

 basketball.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What kind of shoes do you wear for basketball?&quot; 

   

 Many of the victims had mentioned that their attacker had worn sports 

 shoes, but Kominek made it sound as if it were a throwaway question. 

   

 &quot;I like Nike high-tops.   My ankles are weak.   I had to have special 

 shoes smuggled into the pen.   I got in trouble--but they smuggle dope 

 and other junk in, so high-topped basketball shoes aren&apos;t really a 

 major crime.   Basketball weakened my ankles, and I hurt my knees 

 playing football.   Outside of that, I keep in pretty good shape.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You ever have a vasectomy?&quot;   This question seemingly out of left 

 field from Griesel. 

   

 &quot;No.&quot;   Woodfield&apos;s muscles tensed.   &quot;You going to take my blood 

 today?&quot; 

   

 &quot;We might.   Do you have any objection to that?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t want to let you take blood today.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You ever have gonorrhea, any kind of V.D.?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I really screwed up when I got out of the pen--got in a hurry and 

 caught herpes.&quot;   Woodfield smiled conspiratorially--males talking 

 together about male interests. 

   

 Kominek felt a rush.   Beth Wilmot had developed herpes nine days 

 after she was attacked.   He kept his face bland. 

   

 The detectives offered to get some food for Randy, but he said he 

 didn&apos;t like jail food. 

   

 &quot;We Can send out for something.&quot; 

   

 &quot;No, I don&apos;t want to put anyone out.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You say you play basketball?&quot;   Griesel asked.   &quot;For what team?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Columbia Optical.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Could you tell us what nights you&apos;ve played?   Have you missed any 

 games?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I missed some, but I couldn&apos;t tell you specific dates.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What kind of jobs have you been looking for?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Tending bar.   I just finished a bartending course in Portland, where 

 I learned to make any kind of drink you might ask for.   I hope to 

 tend bar nights so I can go to school.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You learn how to make a Freddie Fudwarmer?&quot;   Griesel asked with a 

 grin.   Both of the detectives were holding back, asking ten mane 

 questions for every query on the vital issues.   It was agonizingly 

 slow, this process of interrogation, but they could not rush into the 

 heart of what they needed. 

   

 &quot;I think that&apos;s your basic Harvey Wallbanger with a sillier name.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You consider yourself a religious man, Randy?&quot;   Kominek asked. 

 &quot;Were you involved in religion while you were in the joint?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yeah, I was into religion a lot then...&quot;   The suspect stared at his 

 hands.   &quot;But somewhere along the line, I guess I just told God to 

 take a backseat.&quot; 

   

 The room swelled with silence.   And Randy volunteered his feelings 

 about the power of women over prisoners in the penitentiary.   &quot;They 

 had women guards watching me when I had to take a piss.   They had 

 these nurses in group therapy wanting us to share our sexual 

 fantasies.   They wouldn&apos;t share theirs with us, so why should I tell 

 them mine?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you feel uncomfortable around women?&quot;   Kominek asked. 

   

 &quot;No, not at all.   I like women.&quot; 

   

 Kominek switched gears again.   &quot;Do you think your basketball buddies 

 would remember which games you were at, and which you missed?&quot; 

   

 Randy shrugged.   &quot;They might; they might not.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What position do you play?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Center.   I&apos;m their high scorer; everybody passes me the ball.   I 

 know what I&apos;m capable of doing.   It&apos;s a matter of being in control at 

 all times, especially in sports.   If you don&apos;t have control, things 

 go to shit.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You feel &apos;up&apos; when you&apos;re competing?    Does it make you more aware 

 of things around you?&quot;    

   

 &quot;Oh, sure.    The roar of the crowd and all that.    I thought I might 

 be slower in my rookie games at Green Bay, but with forty thousand 

 people watching, it actually speeded me up.   I like that.    I like to 

 be active, working or playing sports.   Sitting around these past 

 couple of months in Eugene has been hard on me.    I&apos;m really looking 

 forward to getting back to college.    I like studying-- except for 

 economics.&quot;    

   

 &quot;Randy, we have a problem that you may be able to help us out with,&quot; 

 Kominek said.    &quot;We have the records from Arden&apos;s phone.    You called 

 from certain cities in California and other places in southern Oregon 

 where some of our crimes occurred, and you charged those calls to 

 Arden&apos;s phone.   We&apos;ve got toll calls listed that you made in 

 Independence and Woodburn, Oregon, on the night that Shari Hull and 

 Beth Wilmot were shot near Keizer, outside of Salem.   You seem to 

 have been in several areas on the same days our crimes occurred.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I called Shelley in New Mexico and charged it to my home phone.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Were you in Salem on the Sunday night of January 18?&quot;    

   

 &quot;I might have been.    I stop there often, and I call often and charge 

 it to my home phone.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Try to remember.   The records say you made calls to Salem at one 

 P.M., two-forty-two P.M., and five P.M.   on January 18.   You made a 

 call from a booth in Independence--just south of Salem--at 

 nine P.M., and from Woodburn--north of Salem--at ten-thirty P.M.   Do 

 you know where Keizer is?&quot; 

   

 Woodfield nodded.   &quot;Did you drive from Independence through Salem 

 toward Portland on the I-5 that Sunday night?&quot;   The suspect nodded 

 again.   &quot;Then you would have had to pass through Keizer.   You would 

 have been a few hundred feet from where our victims were shot in 

 Keizer between nine and ten-thirty P.M.   Our crime occurred in that 

 time frame.&quot;   

   

 Randy said nothing.   

   

 &quot;Do you ever do anything that changes your appearance?&quot;   Griesel 

 asked.   &quot;Change your hairstyle, wear a hat, anything like that?&quot; 

   

   &quot;No.    My hair&apos;s naturally curly; I don&apos;t do anything to it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You always look just the way we see you now?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yeah...except for when I grew a beard in the joint.   They didn&apos;t 

 like it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Could you tell us a little about your habits?   How late you stay 

 out, what you drink--how much?&quot; 

   

 Randy was more relaxed now.   The conversation no longer dealt with 

 the Salem murder.   &quot;I don&apos;t get drunk.   When I drink, I drink beer. 

 It makes me easygoing, maybe a little louder than I 

 normally am.   I&apos;m usually home right after the bars close.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Ever get in a fight?   When was your last fight?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t get into many fights.   I don&apos;t like getting hit on the nose. 

 That smarts.&quot; 

   

 Randy grinned.   He felt that he&apos;d slid through the dangerous area of 

 the interrogation.   Again, they were only three men rapping. 

   

 &quot;What attracts you in a female?&quot;   Griesel asked.   &quot;Myself, I go for 

 the upper structure.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Breasts aren&apos;t a big deal for me,&quot; Randy answered.   &quot;I like a woman 

 with an athletic build.   Women with nice asses are usually athletic. 

 I like a woman who dresses conservatively--I don&apos;t like revealing 

 clothing.   That&apos;s not classy.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You must meet a lot of attractive women tending bar.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Right.   Most places I&apos;ve worked, everybody parties after hours.&quot; 

   

 Suddenly the conversation was no longer casual. 

   

 &quot;Why do you think the Beaverton police are so adamant about your 

 being a good suspect in their case?&quot;   Kominek asked. 

   

 &quot;They were talking about Julie Reitz, and I knew her.   She played up 

 to me.&quot; 

   

 &quot;How old was Julie?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Eighteen or nineteen, but she had I.D.   that said she was 

 twenty-one.   I was surprised at how mature she acted for her age. 

 But I didn&apos;t know her that well; I knew her girlfriend better.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You ever date Julie?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I won&apos;t tell you that Well, it&apos;s not important anyway.   I went to 

 her house once after hours.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You told us before that three women you knew had been murdered.   Who 

 were those women?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yeah.   Well, there was Julie.   Then my best friend&apos;s ex-fiancee, 

 Darci Fix.   I knew her because my friend introduced us and we went 

 out to dinner.   But my friend broke off that relationship before she 

 was shot.   And then there was Cherie Ayers.   I went to school with 

 Cherie at Newport High School.   She was 

 killed in the Terwilliger Boulevard area in Portland.   She was a good 

 Christian girl, she helped us set up our class reunion.&quot; 

   

 &quot;How was it that you knew her in Portland?   That was a long time 

 after graduation.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I just ran into her by accident.   I think Cherie was going to school 

 there.&quot; 

   

 &quot;That&apos;s a lot of people to know--and have them all killed in the space 

 of a year.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yeah.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Captain Bishop and Detective Loper saw a gun-cleaning kit in your 

 room.   What did you use that for?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I never had a gun.   I used some of the swabs from the kit with 

 alcohol to clean my face.&quot; 

   

 It was a ridiculous explanation, but they let it go.   &quot;When you are 

 in Portland,&quot; Griesel asked, &quot;where do you stay?&quot; 

   

 &quot;With my friends or my sister.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you think you might be able to remember where you were on these 

 dates we&apos;re concerned about?&quot; 

   

 &quot;If I had to, I could prove it in court that I wasn&apos;t in those 

 places.&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield was not emerging as a suspect who, faced with hard 

 questions, would spill his guts.   He was polite, soft-voiced, and 

 cooperative--but only to a point.   When the queries probed too 

 closely, he threw up walls. 

   

 &quot;It might be necessary to go to court,&quot; Kominek said.   &quot;On the night 

 of one of the incidents in Corvallis, your landlady told us you 

 didn&apos;t come home all night.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I find that hard to believe.   I&apos;ve never been away all night--except 

 when I was away on a trip.&quot; 

   

 &quot;We&apos;d be happy if you could give us alibis...but it seems evident 

 that you can&apos;t do that.   We think that you are the I-5 Bandit.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m not pleading guilty to that one, and I&apos;m not the I-5 Killer.   I 

 am not going to defend myself because I don&apos;t have to.&quot; 

   

 But then Randy began to explain where he had been in late January and 

 early February. 

   

 &quot;I travel a lot.   I went to San Francisco on January 29.   I drove 

 down there to meet Shelley, my girlfriend.   I stayed in Ashland at a 

 friend&apos;s house on the way down.   I spent the weekend with my 

 girlfriend, and then I drove back up to Oregon.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What would be the exact dates?&quot; 

   

 A thin beading of sweat marked Woodfield&apos;s forehead. 

   

 &quot;I can&apos;t be absolutely sure.   I think I left for San Francisco on 

 January 28.   I must have been there around the thirty-first or the 

 first of February.   I got back to Eugene about the third or fourth. 

 I stayed at my sister&apos;s in Mt.   Shasta for one night on the way home, 

 and I stayed one night with a friend in Medford on the way back. 

 Look, I can&apos;t be expected to remember exact dates or times or 

 locations.   The past is history.   I would like to help you more, but 

 I can&apos;t do that at this time.&quot; 

   

 The interview had not gone as well as Randy had intended. 

   

 &quot;Do you think you need an attorney now?&quot;   Kominek asked. 

   

 &quot;No, I don&apos;t,&quot; Randy answered, but he gave the two detectives a name 

 and phone number for his attorney.   &quot;I&apos;m going to call him for you,&quot; 

 Kominek said.   &quot;We&apos;d like to help you if we could--you&apos;re not giving 

 us anything to go on.&quot; 

   

 Woodfield stood up.   &quot;How are you going to help me?   You could put me 

 away forever.&quot; 

   

 The interview was over. 

   

 A few miles outside of Eugene, Shelley Janson realized that she would 

 shortly be seeing her lover.   Her happy-ever-after love story was 

 about to begin.   She was as happy as she had ever been in her life. 

 It had been a long, hard trip, pulling the U-Haul, but it had been 

 worth it.   She would be with Randall, and within the year they would 

 be married. 

   

 But when she stopped at a pay phone to call him and tell him that she 

 had arrived, the phone rang endlessly.   There was no one home.   She 

 tried again later, and then again.   She couldn&apos;t imagine where Randy 

 might be.   Finally she gave up and drove to her father&apos;s house. 

   

 She waited there for Randy to call. 

   

 17 

   

 Monty Holloway and pilot, Oregon state trooper Graning, had flown out 

 of Eugene in a state plane at five-thirty A.M on March 4.   They 

 contacted Beth Wilmot at ten after ten that morning in the Spokane 

 airport.   Ron Griesel had constructed a throw-down of Polaroid 

 photos, including a picture of Randy Woodfield taken the day before, 

 and Holloway held his breath as he watched Beth stare at the five 

 photos.   Randy was number three. 

   

 There was a long silence.   Beth placed her index finger on Randy 

 Woodfield&apos;s picture, but she said nothing for minutes.   And then she 

 handed the lay-down back to Holloway. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;m not sure,&quot; she said.   &quot;I think...Unless I&apos;m sure, I won&apos;t pick 

 any of them.   I will have to say it&apos;s none of them.&quot; 

   

 Holloway felt crushing disappointment, but he could not urge Beth to 

 reconsider.   The game wasn&apos;t over yet.   Beth had seen a man with a 

 hood over his hair, and she had seen that man while she was in the 

 grip of profound terror.   The photo of Randy showed a man with a full 

 head of dark hair, half-smiling at the camera.   The voice, the 

 mannerisms, the size of the man didn&apos;t show in the Polaroid. 

   

 &quot;Beth,&quot; he asked, &quot;will you come down to Eugene?   We&apos;ll be having a 

 lineup where all the victims can actually look at the man we have in 

 person.   We&apos;d like you to be there.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Which one is it?   Is he one of those men I just looked at?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I can&apos;t tell you that.   We want you to see him with an open mind. 

 Will you come?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Of course.&quot; 

   

 It was too dangerous to fly Beth to Eugene in the small plane.   As it 

 was, Holloway and Graning were forced to set down when the plane&apos;s 

 wings iced up while crossing the treacherous Cascade mountain range. 

 Arrangements were made for Beth to travel to Eugene by bus. 

   

                                 * * * 

   

 Back in Eugene, detectives from eleven police agencies were working 

 frantically to tie up all the tangled leads.   Randy Woodfield was in 

 custody, but on a basically fragile charge: parole violation.   They 

 had no gun, despite the media&apos;s hints that they had found one.   They 

 had very little physical evidence; they were sure that most of what 

 they needed had gone up in flames in Arden Bates&apos;s fireplace.   They 

 had a prisoner who was, at the very least; reluctant to give them any 

 information on his travels.   They were hampered by the fact that they 

 were working in the glare of press attention.   One slip and the error 

 would be emblazoned in headlines. 

   

 They had a tiger by the tail. 

   

 The little house on E Street was cordoned off by the police with 

 rope, along with the lot next door to it.   A huge sign was nailed to 

 the picket fence: &quot;NO TRESPASSING: INVESTIGATION SCENT BY AUTHORITY 

 OF THE SPRINGFIELD POLICE DEPARTMENT.&quot; 

   

 The only thing missing was hawkers selling balloons and hot dogs. 

   

 The detectives worked to make their case so strong that nothing could 

 crumble it.   First, there would be a search warrant of the premises 

 where Randy Woodfield had lived.   Next, every victim who could be 

 located would be transported to Eugene to view a lineup; People who 

 had been part of Randy&apos;s life during the previous months and years 

 had to be contacted. 

   

 Not surprisingly, most of them were women. 

   

 Dave Kominek had finally received funds from home; he would no longer 

 have to sleep in the Springfield jail, but it would be a long time 

 before he returned to Salem. 

   

 The search warrant came first.   On March 5, at six-fifty PM., Benton 

 County District Court Judge David Smedena signed the warrant: 

   

 YOU ARE THEREFORE COMMANDED to make immediate search of: 

   

 the single-family wood-frame brown-colored home located at 3622 South 

 E Street, Springfield, and the area immediately surrounding that 

 dwelling in Lane County, Oregon, 

   

 TO SEARCH FOR: a false beard, white adhesive tape, silver pistol, 

 blue jeans with a button above the zippered fly, a dark stocking cap, 

 a blue or green waist-length jacket, a red-and- white-checked paper 

 sack bearing the logo of &quot;Fabric Patch,&quot; brown army-type boots, a 

 brown waist-length jacket with hood, blue gloves, tennis or jogging 

 shoes, a Smith and 

 Wesson .38-caliber revolver (or other small revolver), as well as 

 head, facial, body, axillary, and pubic hairs, transferred clothing 

 fibers, and semen stains on any underclothing and/or trousers as well 

 as any ashes and unburned parts of material found therein. 

   

 In addition to the items listed, the detectives had the right, 

 legally, to seize any articles not listed which were in clear view 

 and seemed to bear a connection to crimes included in the I-5 pattern. 

   

 For the next four days, three dozen detectives and criminalists from 

 state crime labs moved through the three-bedroom home. 

   

 Each detective&apos;s entrance and exit was carefully monitored with date 

 and time on a log kept by officers stationed at the doors. 

   

 There was no sense of time for the investigators.   The home&apos;s lights 

 burned twenty-four hours a day.   If anything of evidentiary value 

 remained in Woodfield&apos;s residence, they would find it. 

   

 Eventually, sixty-four separate items were removed from Arden Bates&apos;s 

 house--most of them useless for evidentiary purposes. 

   

 Criminalists in the lab would determine which evidence was important. 

 For now, the search team had found interesting circumstantial 

 evidence: many pairs of blue jeans, a hooded sweatshirt, a 

 blue-maroon-and-white knit shirt, several pairs of sports shoes, a 

 jogging outfit.   All of it fit with the clothing worn by the man who 

 had attacked so many women.   But many, many men wore clothing like 

 that.   Some of the items bore dark stains.   Would it prove to be 

 blood?   Was there some minuscule bit of evidence in that prodigious 

 haul that would link Randy Woodfield with any of his victims? 

   

 One pubic hair seized under the search warrant from Woodfield&apos;s body 

 was microscopically indistinguishable in class and characteristics 

 from the single pubic hair found in the TransAmerica 

 Building on the night of January 18 when the two were compared under 

 a scanning electron microscope.   One lone .32-caliber bullet was 

 found in the pouch of a racquetball bag in Randy Woodfield&apos;s bedroom. 

 The Remington Peters .32 Colt long bullet was a rare bullet, a very 

 rare one.   Itwas the same type of bullet used in the shootings of 

 Beth Wilmot, Shari Hull, Janell Jarvis, and Donna Eckard.   Only the 

 one bullet, tucked away in a pouch of Randy&apos;s sports bag.   Why 

 had he saved it?   Had he perhaps forgotten it, or was there some 

 compulsive reason to save this one dread souvenir?   The rest of the 

 evidence proved to mean nothing.   The stains on Randy&apos;s clothing were 

 not blood.   There had been traces of blood and semen on Randy&apos;s 

 mattress, but criminalists found there was not enough to test for 

 origin. 

   

 Arden Bates told detectives that she had never used her fireplace, 

 that the ashes found there had come from a fire after she and Mickey 

 had moved out.   But the fire had consumed whatever was burned there 

 almost totally.   All criminalists in the state-police lab could 

 isolate were nails, melted glass fragments, bottle caps, aluminum 

 foil, and metal lids.   The supposition was that Randy Woodfield had 

 been doing more than toasting marshmallows while surveillance teams 

 had waited outside.   There was no way now to know just what had been 

 burned in that fireplace. 

   

 But the case was building, brick by brick.   Senior Oregon state 

 trooper Richard L.   Davis had been sent off to check phone numbers 

 Randy had called in Medford and to follow up on cards Randy had 

 received from women there.   Marion County Detective Jay Boutwell 

 would interview the individuals whose phone numbers Randy had called 

 in Salem on the afternoon of January 18 and on February 15.   Neal 

 Loper contacted Pacific Northwest Bell security and received the 

 names and addresses of the subscribers for each number called. 

   

 Randy Woodfield&apos;s long-distance phone calls, made from pay phones and 

 billed to Arden Bates&apos;s phone, when correlated with his constant 

 contacts with the women he expected to be waiting by the phone for 

 him, proved that he had been in the vicinities of the crimes he was 

 suspected of. 

   

 &quot;Once we had homed in on him, the case against Randy Woodfield became 

 like a runaway landslide,&quot; Kominek recalls.   &quot;It took so long for 

 that first rock to let go and tumble down the hill, but then 

 everywhere we turned we found more things that tied Woodfield to our 

 victims.   Little pebbles of information grew into boulders.   And 

 everything pointed to Randy.&quot; 

   

 Lieutenant Kilburn McCoy and Detective Jay Boutwell interviewed two 

 young women Randy had called continually on Sunday, January 18, Penny 

 Hale and Lou Lester, and established that Randy had indeed been 

 headed for Salem that day.   The detectives heard about the &quot;weirdo&quot; 

 who had followed the Salem girls home from TGI Friday in Portland on 

 January 10. 

   

 &quot;We tried to lose him on the road, but he stayed right behind us,&quot; 

 Penny explained.   &quot;I gave him a cup of coffee, sent him on to Eugene, 

 but after that, he kept calling me.   I didn&apos;t want to see him again, 

 and I avoided his calls.&quot; 

   

 Randy had apparently expected that Penny would welcome him with open 

 arms.   When she wasn&apos;t home to receive his calls on Sunday, he asked 

 another girl to accompany him to Portland, but she too refused him. 

   

 With the information that two women had rejected his advances on the 

 afternoon of January 18, one could surmise that a man of Randy&apos;s 

 insecurities might have been quite angry as he drove along the I-5 

 through Keizer, Oregon. 

  

 Beth and Shari had been shot sometime between nine-thirty and 

 nine-fifty-four P.M.   on that Sunday. 

   

 At ten-thirty-one P.M., records indicated that Randy made still 

 another phone call, from a phone booth in Woodburn, thirteen miles 

 north of Keizer on the I-5.   This call was to Moira Bandon, the woman 

 he had lived with for a few months after he&apos;d gotten out of the 

 penitentiary in July 1979, the woman who&apos;d forgiven him for giving 

 her herpes. 

   

 Moira told Monty Holloway that Randy had asked if he could bunk on 

 her couch that night because he had to take a bartender&apos;s exam in 

 Portland the next day.   Moira told Randy that she didn&apos;t have a spare 

 bed or a couch, but that if he wanted to come up and sleep on her 

 bean-bag chair, he could. 

   

 &quot;He said he was in Woodburn when he called, and he got to my place 

 between eleven and eleven-thirty.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What was he wearing?&quot;   Holloway asked. 

   

 &quot;Jeans, a blue or green pullover shirt, and a brown leather jacket. 

 He wore Nikes--blue, I think, with either a dark blue or yellow 

 stripe on them.   He slept over, and he left about noon the next day. 

 I saw his gold Volkswagen.&quot; 

   

 On Monday night, January 19, Randy had tried once more to call Penny 

 Hale, this time from a booth in Tigard, Oregon, just south of 

 Portland.   Again Penny had declined to speak with him.   She told Jay 

 Boutwell that she had received one of his clever cards later that 

 week, chiding her for playing so hard to get; but offering her 

 another chance to &quot;get close&quot; to him. 

   

 Calls to Salem on February 15 had been made to a home where an 

 eighteen-year-old girl lived.   At first Jay Boutwell was extremely 

 interested in this girl; her home was only three blocks from the 

 TransAmerica Title offices. 

   

 The proximity of her home to the scene of the shootings on January 18 

 proved to be only a coincidence.   The girl hadn&apos;t even met Randy 

 Woodfield until February 13.   She told Jay Boutwell about meeting the 

 man named Randall on the I-5 freeway somewhere north of Tacoma on 

 that afternoon.   He&apos;d been driving a gold Volkswagen with a Green Bay 

 Packers decal on the window.   She had never dated him, but she&apos;d 

 given him her phone number after he&apos;d finally persuaded her to pull 

 over north of Vancouver.   She verified that Randall had planned to be 

 in the Portland area over Valentine&apos;s Day and that he&apos;d rented a room 

 at the Marriott Hotel.   &quot;He called my house really drunk at about 

 two-thirty or three in the morning on the fifteenth, and my 

 stepfather talked to him.   Then he called the next day.   He never 

 said anything sexy to me, but when he wanted me to come to his suite 

 in the hotel, I thought he had something like that on his mind.   He 

 was very polite, and he was very macho.   I never saw him in person 

 except for that one time on the freeway.&quot;   So there was no connection 

 to the Marion County case, but this girl&apos;s statements added to the 

 supposition that Randy had been in Beaverton on the Valentine&apos;s Day 

 weekend, and Boutwell sent the statement on to Dave Bishop and Neal 

 Loper to add to the growing file they had on the Julie Reitz murder 

 Valentine&apos;s night. 

   

 Phone records showed that another vital sequence of calls began on 

 January 29 as Randy headed south toward San Francisco.   Detectives 

 had to prove that it was Randy who had made the calls trailing up and 

 down the coast between the twenty-ninth and February 4.   Senior 

 Oregon state trooper Richard Davis located the women Randy had called. 

   

 Randy had, of course, kept the phone numbers of the women he had met 

 at the Sandpiper in Medford during the Christmas season just past. 

 He called Lynette Lacey on the way south, and told her that he was 

 leaving for northern California, and suggested he stop by her house 

 and sleep over on the way down.   She declined.   The next time she 

 heard from him was on February 4.   It was eleven P.M. 

   

 &quot;He said that it was so foggy out, and that he was tired and he&apos;d 

 missed the off ramp and had gone to Gold Hill.   He just wanted to 

 come over and have a drink.   I wouldn&apos;t let him, and he promised he 

 would only sleep on the couch and not bother me.   He just wanted to 

 get some shut-eye.   I still wouldn&apos;t let him come over.   He said he&apos;d 

 been driving a long time, coming back from his sister&apos;s house.   I 

 can&apos;t remember where he said his sister lived.   He said a couple of 

 things that were a little bit screwy, you know, that just didn&apos;t make 

 sense.   He said &apos;Okay&apos; when I wouldn&apos;t let him sleep here.   He talked 

 for about fifteen minutes and hung up.   Then I got a letter from him 

 a couple days after that saying he was sorry for bothering me, and 

 that he wanted me to come up to Eugene.&quot; 

   

 Next, Davis talked with Denise LeNoir, the young Ashland divorcee 

 whom Randy had met on December 26, the same night he met Lynette 

 Lacey.   Randy had struck out with Lynette on January 29, but Denise 

 had been more amenable, at least initially. 

   

 &quot;It was a couple of weeks after I met him on the day after Christmas. 

 I got a phone call one afternoon when I was home sick from 

 work--that would have been around January 20, and he mentioned he was 

 planning a trip and asked if he could stop by.   I said sure, but just 

 let me know.   He said it would be within the next week or so, and 

 sure enough, it was; I got a call at home late on the night of the 

 twenty-eighth, and he was at the exit--the Ashland exit from the 

 I-5--and he wanted to know if he could come over for coffee and 

 wanted directions.&quot; 

   

 Randy had told Denise that he was going to San Francisco to meet his 

 friend Ralph.   He also intended to visit his sister in Mt.   Shasta, 

 and he seemed concerned about snow on the mountain passes.   Randy 

 called his sister, in fact, from Denise&apos;s phone to find out about 

 weather conditions, charging the call to Arden Bates&apos;s phone. 

   

 Denise told Davis that she&apos;d begun to wonder a little about Randy&apos;s 

 past.   He told her he&apos;d been in Portland to go to bartending school, 

 but she knew such a school didn&apos;t involve much time. 

   

 &quot;He left a big blank spot, you know, in his past.   Like he wouldn&apos;t 

 mention what he had done before that.   He was very hesitant to talk 

 about what he had done before that.&quot; 

   

 Evincing great concern over the snowy pass conditions, Randy asked 

 Denise if he could sleep on her couch.   She felt sorry for him and 

 told him he could.   Then he suggested that they sleep together. 

   

 &quot;He made the comment that there would not necessarily have to be any 

 sex.   He said, &apos;Don&apos;t you want a nice warm cuddly body once in a 

 while?&apos; I told him I did sometimes, but not with him.   I told him if 

 he wanted to sleep on the couch, he could, but that was all.&quot; 

   

 When Denise told him she didn&apos;t want to sleep with him, he insinuated 

 that she was either frigid or afraid--that something must be wrong 

 with her.   He told her about several young girls who were anxious to 

 &quot;party&quot; with him, and said that all the girls in his neighborhood 

 thought he was &quot;really neat.&quot; 

   

 And then Randy had acted as though his proposition was only a joke, 

 but he still hinted that if he couldn&apos;t get to sleep, he would come 

 upstairs and &quot;bother&quot; Denise. 

   

 He did not approach her during the night, and he laughed at her the 

 next morning, saying, &quot;Well, I didn&apos;t bother you, did 

 I?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He was very calm about it,&quot; she told Davis.   &quot;He made insinuating 

 remarks, but it was always a joke.   He gave handfuls of candy to my 

 kids; he had foil-wrapped chocolate candies in his pockets.&quot; 

   

 When Denise walked Randy to his car, she saw a teddy bear in the back 

 of the gold Volkswagen and he told her it was a present for a 

 friend.   And then Randy had asked about a motel on the I-5: the 

 Knight&apos;s Inn in Ashland.   Davis was interested in this; this was the 

 motel that was robbed five days later by a man with a silver gun and 

 tape on his nose. 

   

 &quot;He sent me a postcard later,&quot; Denise recalled.   &quot;It said something 

 to the effect that he&apos;d tried to get close to me, and I wouldn&apos;t 

 allow it, and I didn&apos;t want romance, or something like that, and I 

 knew where he was if I changed my mind.&quot; 

   

 Back in Eugene, Dave Kominek and Ron Griesel interviewed Randy 

 Woodfield again the day after the search warrant was executed.   They 

 found their suspect more closed up than ever.   He did not want to 

 talk with them about anything--not even his prowess as an athlete. 

   

   

 18 

   

 Shelley Janson had pulled into Eugene on March 6, 1981, her U-Haul 

 trailer full of her belongings, ready to move in with Randall.   But 

 now she could not find her fiance.   The phone in the house he shared 

 with Arden Bates rang endlessly, and she could not imagine where 

 either Arden or Randy had got to. 

   

 Finally, through friends, she learned that he had been arrested. 

 Determined to find out how such an improbable thing could have 

 happened, she called the Springfield Police Department and was put 

 through to Beaverton Detective Neal Loper. 

   

 Shelley Janson met with Loper and Monty Holloway and consented to a 

 taped interview about her relationship with Randall Woodfield.   The 

 detectives saw before them an exceptionally beautiful girl, slender, 

 with long dark hair.   They looked at each other and shook their heads 

 slightly.   Most men would have considered themselves lucky to be 

 engaged to a woman like this.   Their investigation suggested that she 

 had not been enough for Randy. 

   

 Shelley came across as totally naive.   Loper and Holloway were sorry 

 that they had to explain the charges against her lover.   Shelley 

 agreed to have the interview taped; she had never been in any kind of 

 trouble with the law, and she was open with the detectives. 

   

 The romance that she had found so perfect that it might have come 

 right out of a novel was reduced now to two sides of a tape cassette 

 that would become part of a police file. 

   

 Shelley told the truth.   She believed that the truth would help 

 Randall.   She told the two detectives about the weekend she&apos;d spent 

 with her fiance in San Francisco on January 31-February 1, only five 

 weeks earlier.   She had left him to fly back to New Mexico, and 

 Randall had left to drive back to Eugene.   Yes, she&apos;d been terribly 

 worried because she hadn&apos;t been able to reach him until Thursday 

 morning, February 5.   She&apos;d been terrified that he&apos;d had an accident. 

   

 But when she&apos;d finally reached him, he was fine.   He&apos;d told her about 

 a speeding ticket, about having to buy a new battery and tires.   She 

 thought he&apos;d spent the extra time at his sister&apos;s house in Mt. 

 Shasta.   He had seemed a little tired on the phone, but he&apos;d been 

 explicit about his need for her, telling her how much he missed her. 

   

 &quot;He told me that the trip back had been very expensive for him.&quot; 

   

 Shelley turned over a packet of Randall&apos;s letters to her; she was 

 sure they would show what kind of man Randall was.   He&apos;d spent the 

 time since she met him--working, trying to find a job, trying to get 

 back into college.   He couldn&apos;t be guilty of what people were 

 hinting.   She simply refused to believe it. 

   

 Jack Woodfield came to the Springfield jail to see his son.   The 

 shock of the ordeal showed on the older man&apos;s face; it had seemed to 

 the elder Woodfields that Randall had finally pulled his life 

 together, and now his father was facing a situation that might break 

 any parent&apos;s heart.   Jack and Randy met in the presence of Dave 

 Kominek.   Randy slipped again when he explained his latest trouble 

 with the law to his father.   He said that he had been out with &quot;a 

 girl&quot; the night she was killed in Beaverton and that the Beaverton 

 police had questioned him about her death.   He told his father that 

 the girl had been to a Valentine&apos;s party that night, and he&apos;d seen 

 her after that. 

   

 Randy had never before admitted being with Julie Reitz on Valentine&apos;s 

 night.   None of the detectives had ever told Randy that Julie had, 

 indeed, been to a Valentine&apos;s party that night. 

   

 He talked earnestly to his father of his innocence, apparently 

 oblivious of the fact that he&apos;d just contradicted statements he&apos;d 

 previously given to Dave Bishop and Neal Loper.   At first he&apos;d denied 

 even knowing Julie Reitz.   Then he&apos;d admitted dating her at one time, 

 and then he&apos;d admitted having sex with her.   Now he had told his 

 father in Kominek&apos;s hearing that he&apos;d been with Julie only hours 

 before her murder. 

   

 Randy Woodfield continued to maintain his innocence to detectives 

 when they questioned him, but he was getting progressively more 

 tense--this despite his ace in the hole, which was his delusion that 

 the women in his life would do anything for him, even lie if 

 necessary. 

   

 One of Randy&apos;s Eugene girlfriends had gone to a detective and told 

 him that Randy had confided to her that the police were following him 

 because they thought he had killed a girl in Portland on Valentine&apos;s 

 Day weekend.   &quot;He asked if he could count on me for an alibi.   I told 

 him that I wouldn&apos;t lie for him, and I asked him why, if he was 

 innocent, he didn&apos;t just cooperate and tell the truth.   He said he 

 couldn&apos;t really do that because of the way he&apos;d been spending his 

 time.   He dropped the conversation when I made it clear I wouldn&apos;t 

 lie for him.&quot; 

   

 Randy had good reason to be nervous.   With every day that passed, he 

 seemed to be in a little more trouble.   The lay-downs of mug shots 

 that Kominek had sent to every agency involved had drawn several 

 &quot;hits.&quot;   On March 7 the victims in Bothell, Washington, who had 

 encountered the I-5 bandit on December 21, 1980, identified Randy 

 Woodfield from the lay-down.   Chief Rudy Plancich of Bothell obtained 

 an arrest warrant listing Randall Brent Woodfield as the alleged 

 perpetrator of those crimes. 

   

 Physical evidence was piling up, witnesses were verifying what lawmen 

 suspected about Randy&apos;s travels along the freeway, and now the time 

 was ripe for the lineup.   Would any of the victims recognize Randy 

 Woodfield as their assailant?   The I-5 Killer&apos;s disguise had been 

 very effective in altering his appearance--the beard, the tape over 

 his nose, and the watch caps or hoods over his hair.   But many of the 

 victims had commented on the distinctive qualities in his voice, the 

 soft, well-modulated tones that seemed to war with the ugly things he 

 had said and done to them. 

   

 Monty Holloway and Dave Bishop worked to set up the lineup.   The 

 &quot;cons&quot; in the lineup would all be police officers, and for a very 

 good reason.   If it ever became necessary to regroup that lineup, the 

 participants would be easy to find.   If they chose other prisoners to 

 stand beside Randy Woodfield, they would undoubtedly scatter to the 

 four winds as soon as they were released from jail. 

   

 The officers chosen were from the Springfield Police Department, the 

 Lane County Sheriff&apos;s Office, and Multnomah County in Portland. 

 Woodfield, as well as all the other men in the lineup, would wear a 

 short-sleeved pale gray Springfield jail shirt and dark gray 

 trousers.   Each man would be barefoot.   Each had dark curly or wavy 

 hair and wore a mustache.   They all had wide shoulders and athletic 

 builds.   They were all between twenty- five and thirty-two.   Kominek 

 made the decision not to have the men wear fake beards and Band-Aid 

 disguises; witnesses usually remembered voices, eyes, general 

 bearing, and those disguises might only confuse them. 

   

 The investigators did not want to skip any vital legal steps.   They 

 contacted Woodfield&apos;s attorney and asked him to come to Eugene to 

 okay the men selected for the lineup and to attend the lineup itself. 

   

 &quot;They left out the number three,&quot; Kominek recalls, &quot;because Woodfield 

 had been number three in the lay-down shown to Beth, and that might 

 have weighted it.   They left out one because we didn&apos;t want someone 

 to say &apos;Is this the one?&apos; They tried to think of everything they 

 could to make that lineup totally without prejudice.&quot; 

   

 The lineup was set for Sunday afternoon, March 8, in the Springfield 

 Police Department.   It had taken three days after Woodfield&apos;s arrest 

 to round up more than two dozen of the victims assaulted by the I-5 

 Killer. 

   

 Before the lineup, the victims were led into a large room, where Ron 

 Griesel made sure that they did not converse with each other.   Each 

 victim had a memory of what he or she had seen; the investigators 

 wanted no transfer of information.   The victims tried not to stare at 

 each other and tried not to surmise what the others might be doing 

 there.   The tension in the room was almost palpable.   Confronting a 

 man who might be the one who had filled every one of them with abject 

 terror--even seeing him through a glass wall--would be frightening. 

   

 And then the word came that the lineup was ready. 

   

 Shasta County Detective Sergeant Gene Farley and Captain Dave Bishop 

 stood at the doors of the viewing room. 

   

 The lineup moved across the stage in the six-by-six-foot room at 

 five-forty-eight that afternoon.   Randy Woodfield was number five. 

 Monty Holloway asked the six men to face front, turn left, turn 

 right, turn so that their backs showed to those viewing them from 

 behind one-way glass.   He asked each man to repeat certain phrases: 

 &quot;Do what I say and you won&apos;t get hurt.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Where is the back room?&quot;    &quot;Count to one hundred before you move.&quot; 

 &quot;Don&apos;t call the police.&quot;    &quot;Lay down on the floor.    Look at the 

 floor.&quot;    &quot;Put the money in the bag.&quot;    &quot;Does this feel good?&quot; 

 &quot;Aren&apos;t I big?&quot; 

   

 On the other side of the one-way glass, Dave Kominek stood just 

 behind Beth.   He could not see her face.   She didn&apos;t move.   She said 

 nothing at all.   It was impossible for him to sense what might be 

 going through her mind.   She was so still that he wondered if maybe 

 this whole phase of the probe would be all for naught. 

   

 Dave Bishop and Chris Van Dyke were in a position from which they 

 could see Beth&apos;s face when the six men walked out onto the stage. 

 Both Van Dyke and Bishop saw the color drain from Beth&apos;s face.   Her 

 normal olive skin had turned as pale as chalk, yet her expression was 

 only one of intense concentration as her eyes scanned each man in the 

 lineup.   Van Dyke and Bishop looked at each other.   Could this be it? 

 They would have to wait until they saw whether Beth circled a number 

 on her card. 

   

 When the lineup was completed, victims were taken one at a time into 

 an interview room, where detectives Neal Loper and Ron Womack from 

 the Beaverton Police Department, and Rick Burnett of Shasta County 

 questioned them.   All the interviews were taped, and each victim was 

 asked to mark a card with the six numbers on it, and then to sign it. 

   

 Womack began the questioning with the victims from the Burger Express 

 in Redding: the owner, her husband, and the teenage employee who had 

 been sodomized and raped in the restroom.   The owner picked number 

 five (Randy Woodfield) because of his voice, his eyebrows, his facial 

 structure.   Her husband picked number five, but was not as sure.   The 

 rape victim could not make a choice; she had been so terrorized by 

 the gun that she had obeyed her rapist&apos;s orders not to look at his 

 face. 

   

 Jessie Clovis was next to mark her card.   The rapist who had 

 jumped into her car on the main street of Yreka had ordered her 

 repeatedly not to look at him, but she&apos;d recognized number five from 

 his voice, his eyes, and his build.   She had looked hard at him as he 

 walked away after leaving her naked in Yreka. 

   

 &quot;The voice stood out the most,&quot; she said quietly.   &quot;It just clicked 

 in my head.&quot; 

   

 Now, the three young women from Corvallis--two from the restaurant, 

 and one from the fabric store.   Each of them circled number five. 

 Again and again Rick Burnett, Neal Loper, and Ron Womack heard the 

 same phrases: &quot;His eyes.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I just got a feeling in my stomach when I saw him.&quot;    &quot;I remember 

 that voice.&quot; 

   

 One of the youngest victims proved to be a most perceptive witness. 

 Merrisue Green and her sister, Megan, the little girls who had been 

 attacked in their own home in Corvallis, had viewed the lineup. 

 Eight-year-old Megan told the detectives that she could not recognize 

 the man who had attacked her, but ten-year- old Merrisue could.   She 

 drew a careful circle around number five. 

   

 &quot;Merrisue,&quot; Ron Womack asked, &quot;why did you circle number five?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Because when, uh...okay...at my house when he came in, he sounded 

 exactly like him and he looked like him too.   &apos;Cause his hair wasn&apos;t 

 the same, but his face looked the same, cause I know that he could 

 get his hair cut and his hair changed and stuff.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Was he the man?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He sounds a whole bunch like him.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What about the rest of them, the other five?&quot; 

   

 &quot;They didn&apos;t sound much like him.   Not at all.&quot; 

   

 &quot;So you could, by looking at them and listening to them, could 

 eliminate those guys?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;   She nodded.   &quot; &apos;Cause some sounded kinda high- pitched and 

 some sounded low-pitched and they weren&apos;t it.   He was just kind of a 

 medium.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Besides just his voice, do you feel that he looked a lot like the 

 man that was in your house?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Well...his hair didn&apos;t look the same.   It looks the same color, but 

 it didn&apos;t look...umm...well, it looked changed.   His hair wasn&apos;t that 

 way and he had a mustache before.   He had sideburns, but he doesn&apos;t 

 now.   He sounded like the same.   His facial bones and stuff looked 

 the same to what I can remember.&quot; 

   

 &quot;You&apos;re picking number five?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes.   Yes.   That&apos;s him.&quot; 

   

 Merrisue Green was a very intelligent, very observant child.   Her 

 attacker had apparently discounted her ability to perceive what was 

 going on around her.   But she had seen him and she had seen him 

 without his false beard, without the tape across his nose.   She had 

 even memorized the length of his sideburns. 

   

 Next came the employees of the Dairy Queen who had traveled down from 

 Bellevue, Washington, with Detective Gary Trent from that city&apos;s 

 police force.   The male employee picked the wrong man, but the girl 

 who had been subjected to oral sodomy after the male employee was 

 locked in the freezer recognized Randy Woodfield.   Like most of the 

 victims, she found that his eyes were unforgettable.   And his voice. 

 &quot;That same tone value, not too many ups and downs.   Not a real 

 monotone...but not much inflection.   It was the feeling I had when he 

 talked.&quot; 

   

 The victim who had been sodomized in an Albany laundromat had reacted 

 profoundly when she saw Randy Woodfield.   She too circled number 

 five.   &quot;It sure made my heart race when I saw him.   I remember his 

 eyes...and his nose.   His voice.&quot; 

   

 Not all of the victims solidified the case against Woodfield.   The 

 girl who had been shot in the restaurant in Sutherlin, Oregon, wasn&apos;t 

 sure which man in the lineup, if any, might have been the gunman. 

 She finally picked number two tentatively. 

   

 The desk clerk from the Knight&apos;s Inn Motel in Ashland, Oregon, 

 didn&apos;t hesitate at all: &quot;It&apos;s number five.&quot; 

   

 And so it went.   The majority of the victims picked number five, some 

 adamantly, some tentatively. 

   

 And now it was Beth Wilmot&apos;s turn. 

   

 &quot;When it was Beth&apos;s turn,&quot; Kominek recalls, &quot;we walked out of the 

 viewing area into the interview rooms.   I handed Beth the little card 

 and asked her to circle the number that matched the man who had shot 

 her--if he was there--and then sign it.   She circled it and gave it to 

 me.   I looked down, and there it was--number five. 

   

 Van Dyke stood by waiting.   This was the most important victim as far 

 as the probe went.   This was the living victim whom the killer had 

 left for dead, the one person who had seen him full face just before 

 the act of murder.   Would she remember enough? 

   

 &quot;Tell us why it is you picked number five, Beth,&quot; Kominek said 

 quietly. 

   

 &quot;Okay.&quot;   Beth had begun to tremble, and Kominek could see she was 

 trying hard not to cry.   &quot;The reason is that he&apos;s tall and the way he 

 was built.   I checked his whole body out.   His face.   Just the way 

 his face was.   And I could picture him in a hood, and just everything 

 about him.   I chose him.   That&apos;s why I chose him.   His eyes. 

 Everything.&quot; 

   

 &quot;That&apos;s the man?&quot; 

   

 &quot;That&apos;s him!&quot; 

   

 For the detectives, for D.A.   Chris Van Dyke, it was akin to winning 

 the Grand Prix.   They knew they had the I-5 Killer.   Beth&apos;s absolute 

 identification had convinced them. 

   

 They discussed arresting him immediately for murder on probable 

 cause, but they didn&apos;t want to risk the slightest chance of a 

 reversal on a legal technicality.   Van Dyke left at once to drive to 

 Salem, taking Beth Wilmot with him.   She didn&apos;t even want to be in 

 the same town with Randy Woodfield. 

   

 Van Dyke went directly to his office to do the paperwork, working 

 through most of the night.   He obtained a district-court warrant 

 early Monday morning, charging Randall Brent Woodfield with murder, 

 attempted murder, and two counts of sodomy in the attacks against 

 Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot.   Van Dyke called Kominek in Eugene. 

   

 &quot;We&apos;ve got it, Dave.   The warrant will be ready at ten-thirty A.M. 

 You can arrest him then.&quot; 

   

 At ten-forty-four A.M., Captain Dave Bishop, Corporal Monty Holloway, 

 and Detective Dave Kominek went to Randy Woodfield&apos;s cell and 

 charged him with the four counts, placing him under arrest for 

 charges far more serious than parole violation. 

   

 Woodfield looked at the three detectives.   &quot;I knew it.   I knew last 

 night that you guys were charging me.&quot; 

   

 It was almost impossible to judge Woodfield&apos;s emotions; he wasn&apos;t 

 angry, and he didn&apos;t seem particularly anxious.   He seemed to have 

 known it all along.   And then Randy shut up; he had nothing more to 

 say. 

   

 Dave Bishop and Dave Kominek drove Randy Woodfield back toward Salem, 

 where he would be placed in the Marion County Jail.   They thought if 

 they left right away they could have Randy safely in jail before the 

 press got word of his arrest on murder charges.   They didn&apos;t spot any 

 reporters or photographers during the hour-and-a-half drive, but as 

 they headed to the jail entrance with their barefoot prisoner in his 

 white coveralls, the dark morning lit up.   Photographers popped up 

 everywhere, lined up three deep to get their first glimpse of the man 

 who was rumored to be the I-5 Killer. 

   

 &quot;Do you want your leather coat so you can hide your face?&quot;   Bishop 

 asked his prisoner. 

   

 Randy shook his head.   &quot;It&apos;s too late.   They&apos;ve all seen me now 

 anyway.   Let&apos;s keep going.&quot; 

   

 While they were booking Randy into the Marion County Jail, he turned 

 to the two detectives.   &quot;My only regret is that I didn&apos;t have a 

 chance to shave or put on clean clothes before I had to face the news 

 cameras.&quot; 

   

 But Randy was a crowd pleaser right to the end.   He&apos;d held his head 

 high and grinned directly into the cameras. 

   

 The pictures turned out great, and they were flashed up and down the 

 West Coast via news-service wires in time to make the early editions. 

 The Portland, Seattle, and San Francisco six o&apos;clock news broadcasts 

 all showed Randy Woodfield ambling into the Marion County Sheriff&apos;s 

 Office.   Randy was smiling broadly.   He might well have been a sports 

 star coming home after a triumphant game.   Only he wasn&apos;t.   He was 

 quite probably the most prolific sexual criminal in Oregon criminal 

 history.   He would garner far more headlines over the next months and 

 years in this role than he ever had as a star athlete. 

   

 Chris Van Dyke held a press conference, facing the packed room 

 cautiously.   He explained that additional charges might be 

 forthcoming, although none were planned at the moment. 

   

 &quot;Do you think there&apos;s a link between the Salem crimes and the I-5 

 Killer?&quot;   a reporter called out. 

   

 Van Dyke was not about to risk a premature tipping of his legal hand. 

 &quot;It really remains to be seen at trial whether or not there is a 

 link between those--the various crimes.   There are a number of 

 similarities.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Can residents along the freeway relax now?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Let&apos;s say that anyone concerned about Shari Hull&apos;s murder and the 

 shooting of Beth Wilmot can rest more easily.   Events last night 

 convinced me to go to the grand jury.   I can&apos;t elaborate.   I simply 

 made the decision we had a strong enough case to press charges here.&quot; 

   

 A month earlier, Monty Holloway had told the press that the I-5 

 Killer &quot;was probably one of those individuals who, when he&apos;s caught, 

 all of his neighbors will say; &apos;I can&apos;t believe it.   He&apos;s such a nice 

 guy.&apos;&quot; 

   

 And Holloway had been right on target.   Reporters scattered to gather 

 shocked quotes from people who had known Randy Woodfield.   And all of 

 them said essentially, &quot;I can&apos;t believe it.   He was such a nice guy.&quot; 

   

 In Eugene, Shelley Janson read the headline stories and stared at the 

 pictures of Randy smiling at the camera as the two grim-faced 

 detectives held his handcuffed arms.   The text that followed was so 

 devastating, she could not assimilate it.   Randall had been charged 

 with murder.   The police thought that her Randall, her gentle, 

 sensitive lover, was the I-5 Killer.   She didn&apos;t believe it.   It had 

 to be some kind of grotesque mistake.

 Even though Randy was locked in the Marion County Jail in Salem, the 

 probe went on.   There were so many crimes, so many victims, and so 

 many ragged ends to be knit up into the fabric of the case. 

   

 Shasta County Detective Gene Farley contacted Randy&apos;s sister in Mt. 

 Shasta to see if Randy had, indeed, stopped to visit her family on 

 his trip to northern California.   Susan, three years older than 

 Randy, said that he had been there twice.   On the way down, he&apos;d 

 stopped on January 30 for lunch.   He&apos;d been wearing the blue plaid 

 shirt she&apos;d given him for Christmas, and blue jeans.   He&apos;d called to 

 get Shelley&apos;s flight number, and then continued south.   He&apos;d come 

 back before eleven P.M.   On Tuesday, February 3.   They&apos;d sat up 

 talking about his relationship with Shelley, although he had told his 

 sister that he and Shelley were not engaged yet.   (Shelley, of 

 course, had flown back to New Mexico thrilled because she thought she 

 was engaged.) Randy also talked about jobs he might get in Eugene, 

 particularly a job working at a golf course.   His sister said she&apos;d 

 been a little concerned about Randy&apos;s unemployed state but that he&apos;d 

 seemed confident that there was no problem.   He hadn&apos;t seemed 

 nervous, and he hadn&apos;t seemed tired. 

   

 &quot;What time did Randy leave your home after his second visit?&quot;   Farley 

 asked. 

   

 &quot;Before noon the next day--February 4.   He stopped by my husband&apos;s 

 office to say goodbye to him.&quot; 

   

 Farley talked next to Randy&apos;s physician brother-in-law.   Yes, Randy 

 had left that afternoon to head back to Eugene after stopping at his 

 office to discuss his relationship with Shelley. 

   

 Even though Farley had difficulty understanding how Woodfield--if he 

 was the guilty man--could have been so calm in his visits to his 

 sister&apos;s home, the times and locations all matched.   There had been 

 the rape and robbery at the Burger Express in Redding early on the 

 evening of February 3.   Ten miles north, and an hour later, the 

 double homicides of Janell Jarvis and Donna Eckard occurred.   The 

 Shasta County detective crew estimated that the killer had cleared 

 Mountain Gate before nine P.M. 

   

 And Randy Woodfield had shown up to visit his sister in Mt.   Shasta, 

 sixty miles north of Mountain Gate on the I-5, before eleven!   If, as 

 Farley suspected, Randy had committed the ugly murders in Mountain 

 Gate, they had not affected him any more than a rest stop along the 

 freeway. 

   

 And then the next day, Randy had left Mt.   Shasta in the afternoon 

 after a cozy family visit, and headed north again.   That evening, 

 Jessie Clovis had been subjected to hours of sexual abuse in Yreka, 

 thirty-five miles up the freeway. 

   

 Randy&apos;s relatives thought he&apos;d worn a leather jacket when he visited 

 them.   The living victims in Redding and Yreka had described a green 

 windbreaker.   And a green windbreaker had been found during the 

 search of the Bates home in Springfield. 

   

 Randy&apos;s sister and brother-in-law were stunned to learn on March 5 

 that Randy had been arrested for parole violation when a friend 

 called from Eugene.   They were shocked almost speechless when the 

 second set of charges was filed on March 9. 

   

 Randy had seemed the same as always when he&apos;d written to them in the 

 first week of March.   He&apos;d talked of setting up a chess-by-mail game 

 with a mutual friend, and about his new love.   He&apos;d sent a note to 

 thank them for putting him up on February 3.   He&apos;d called the next 

 day to say Shelley was driving up, asking if she could stay with his 

 sister and brother-in-law.   They had welcomed Shelley, and they&apos;d 

 been pleased to see that Randy had finally found a really nice woman 

 to settle down with. 

   

 And now, like almost everyone else who was close to Randy Woodfield, 

 they could barely believe he had been charged with murder. 

   

 There was one young woman who was not as thunderstruck by Randy&apos;s 

 arrest as his other friends were.   That was Dixie Palliter, 

 twenty-two.   Even before the lineup had taken place, Neal loper had 

 headed back to Milwaukie, Oregon, to speak with Dixie Palliter, the 

 young woman everyone said was Randy&apos;s one platonic girlfriend. 

 There were rumors that Dixie had accompanied Randy on at least one of 

 his trips up into Washington State, that she had talked about helping 

 Randy buy a gun.   The G.I.   Joe receipt Loper had found in Randy&apos;s 

 wallet indicated just such a purchase.   The .32 was missing, the .38 

 was missing, and so was the little silver gun described by so many of 

 the victims. 

   

 Dixie had told Loper she had agreed to purchase a gun for Randy. 

 &quot;But I changed my mind, and I never picked it up.&quot; 

   

 Loper wanted to talk in depth with Dixie again; he was not convinced 

 she was telling him the whole story.   On March 10, armed with a 

 grand-jury subpoena for the records pertaining to the purchase of 

 .32-caliber ammunition from a G.I.   Joe&apos;s store in Milwaukie, Oregon, 

 by Dixie Palliter on December 19, 1980, Loper found that that 

 purchase had indeed taken place.   Dixie continued to deny that she 

 had bought the ammunition.   Other records verified that Dixie had 

 also purchased a .22-caliber weapon on October 10 but that she&apos;d 

 returned the gun and gotten her money back on December 10. 

   

 On March 10 at six-thirty in the evening, Neal Loper of Beaverton and 

 Jay Boutwell of Marion County contacted Dixie at her home. 

   

 Dixie Palliter, who worked as a Portland bus driver, told the 

 detectives that she had met Randy Woodfield when he was a bartender 

 at the Faucet Tavern a year before and that they&apos;d become good 

 friends.   &quot;That&apos;s about it.   We just continued being really good 

 friends.&quot; 

   

 Dixie was the first woman the investigative team had encountered who 

 had had only a platonic relationship with Woodfield.   Randy had been 

 living with Lucy Grant in Lake Oswego and Dixie was going steady with 

 a man when they met.   &quot;We got to be such close friends &apos;cause he was 

 splitting up with Lucy at the time, and I talked with him about my 

 problems with my boyfriend.&quot; 

   

 &quot;So you had something in common?&quot;   Loper asked. 

   

 &quot;Yeah.   At first it was kind of like dates, except, you know, nothing 

 ever came of it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Dixie,&quot; Neal Loper said firmly, &quot;I don&apos;t think you&apos;ve been telling 

 us the truth.   I think you know more about Randy Woodfield&apos;s 

 activities than you&apos;re admitting.   We&apos;ve gathered a lot more 

 information since the last time we talked.&quot; 

   

 Dixie Palliter became visibly nervous; the interview was not going 

 well for her. 

   

 Well, there were some things she hadn&apos;t told them.   Dixie was not 

 very adept at remembering dates; she thought a robbery involving 

 Randy had taken place around Christmas 1980.   She admitted that Randy 

 had mentioned robbing a Baskin-Robbins Ice-cream parlor in 

 Washington.   &quot;He said he went into a BaskinRobbins and made a girl 

 get on the ground and...I can&apos;t remember his words.   I just know that 

 he said he made her get on the ground and told her to put the money 

 in the bag, and then he told her just to remain on the floor until he 

 was gone.&quot; 

   

 Dixie thought that the robbery had occurred somewhere off the freeway 

 near Seattle. 

   

 &quot;Did he mention anything about disguises or anything?&quot;   Boutwell 

 asked. 

   

 &quot;Uh...he mentioned about a beard.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Anything else?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Uh, hmmm .   .   A Band-Aid over his nose.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did he say why he did that?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Well, I guess, &apos;cause that&apos;s so you can&apos;t be identified because the 

 nose is supposed to give you away.&quot; 

   

 Asked if she had ever seen the beard, Dixie said no.   Loper suggested 

 that she was not a very good liar.   

   

 Dixie&apos;s relatives had surmised to the detectives that Dixie might 

 have been along on some of the robberies in Washington.   But Dixie 

 continued to insist she had not been with him.   She had heard him 

 talk about a silver gun, however.   &quot;He wanted to take it down to his 

 dad&apos;s, that&apos;s why he needed the bullets--practice shooting.   Another 

 reason was that these guys that smashed up his car were giving him a 

 bad time, and they weren&apos;t going to pay for it, so he said he wanted 

 to flash the gun if they were going to try to beat him up or 

 something.   He said that he would just show them the gun, but he 

 wasn&apos;t going to have bullets in it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;He tell you about the 7-11 too?&quot;   Loper asked. 

   

 &quot;Well, they showed it on TV, with that guy that was holding up one of 

 the stores, and it showed him [on film from the hidden camera].   I 

 think he had a cap or-hat; it kind of looked like him I don&apos;t know.&quot; 

   

 Dixie allowed that she was the &quot;type of person you can confide in,&quot; 

 but she balked at discussing any of the dozens of other crimes 

 alleged to have been committed by Randy Woodfield.   

   

 Loper and Boutwell were convinced Dixie knew more than she was 

 telling.   She finally admitted that Randy had gone with her to buy a 

 little silver gun and that Randy had chosen it But she had returned 

 that gun in December.   She thought that perhaps he had used that gun 

 when he&apos;d gone to Washington.   Later she admitted that Randy had 

 another gun that she thought he&apos;d obtained &quot;through a private party.&quot; 

 But she said she&apos;d never seen it.   

   

 &quot;Where did he get the gun?&quot; Loper probed.   &quot;What private party?   Tell 

 me what happened.&quot; 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t know who it was.   I swear to God I don&apos;t.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Was it a dirty gun?   Stolen?   Clean?   What?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Uh, oh...I think it was just...Maybe a friend; I don&apos;t know.   See, I 

 wasn&apos;t too interested.   I didn&apos;t really want to hear all this stuff. 

 I wasn&apos;t wanting to hear about all, you know, a gun and stuff, and 

 I&apos;m scared to death of guns myself.   You guys act like I&apos;m just...I 

 am telling the truth.   Get that lie detector in here so I came.&quot; 

   

 All in good time, Loper promised her. 

   

 Dixie explained that she knew the second gun had been silver too, 

 only because Randy had told her that it was.   She kept repeating that 

 she thought the gun had come from a &quot;private party,&quot; but would say no 

 more.   The bullets she&apos;d bought for him were for that gun. 

   

 Loper sensed that Dixie was holding back information, and he 

 suspected that she might have actually &quot;ridden shotgun&quot; with Randy on 

 some of his forays.   But he doubted that she had been an active 

 participant.   Her value to the investigation was the information she 

 had given them--and, hopefully, would continue to give them. 

   

 Like most of Randy&apos;s women friends, Dixie had been the recipient of 

 gifts.   He had bought her a phone, a sweater, given her eighty 

 dollars for Christmas, and he often filled up the gas tank in her 

 car.   &quot;He gave me those things just because I was a good friend.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Where did he get all his money?&quot;   Loper asked. 

   

 &quot;Well, I thought most of it was from unemployment.   He was getting 

 quite a bit from unemployment, and then, when he was working at the 

 Faucet and--&quot; 

   

 &quot;He tell you about ripping off the Faucet?&quot;   Loper cut in. 

   

 &quot;Yeah.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What&apos;d he tell you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He told me that...umm...that he had done it.&quot; 

   

 But no matter how much Loper and Boutwell pressed for details, Dixie 

 evaded their questions. 

   

 &quot;Let&apos;s talk about Valentine&apos;s Day weekend,&quot; Loper said. 

   

 Now they were getting into the Julie Reitz murder case, and the 

 details of Randy Woodfield&apos;s movements on that day were vital to the 

 probe.   Dixie seemed to relax a little when the questioning 

 concerning the guns stopped.   She was willing to talk about that 

 weekend. 

   

 &quot;He called me up and came over and we went shopping and out to lunch 

 about eleven in the morning on Valentine&apos;s Day.   Down in Milwaukie, 

 to the Blade Men&apos;s Clothing Store, and we picked out a sweater and a 

 pair of pants for that night &apos;cause he was holding a party at the 

 Marriott for whoever wanted to come.&quot; 

   

 Randy had changed into his new clothes at her house and left about 

 six P.M.   to go to the Marriott Hotel, but when Dixie had called his 

 room at seven, he wasn&apos;t there.   He did call her later and asked her 

 when she&apos;d be coming down.   But Dixie said she had felt ill and that 

 she never went.   Randy kept calling her until about midnight.   She 

 didn&apos;t hear from him again until nine the next morning. 

   

 &quot;He said he was going in the Jacuzzi and that he had to check out by 

 three.   Then he was going home.&quot; 

   

 Dixie and her boyfriend had joined Randy that afternoon for 

 racquetball, and she&apos;d found him just as he always was.   He had 

 mentioned to her, however, that he didn&apos;t need his gun any longer and 

 that he&apos;d thrown it in a river. 

   

 &quot;Has he contacted you recently and asked you to provide him with an 

 alibi?&quot;   Loper asked suddenly. 

   

 Dixie was silent for a few moments.   &quot;Well, he called me the day 

 before they [the police] came to his house.   He said he needed my help 

 because they were suspecting him in that Beaverton girl&apos;s murder, 

 and I told him, &apos;No, I can&apos;t help you about that.&apos; 

   

 &quot;I was really shocked, and I go, &apos;What?   They&apos;re suspecting 

 you of a murder?&apos; and he said it was no big deal; that he just needed 

 my help.   Just as soon as I got off the phone, I told my 

 sister that if he did call, to say I was away with one of my 

 girlfriends somewhere.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did he ever tell you that he knew Julie Reitz?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did you know Julie Reitz?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.&quot; 

   

 Dixie said she had known about Darci Fix&apos;s murder, and about Cherie 

 Ayers&apos; murder too--through information from Randy--but only that they 

 had been killed, nothing more. 

   

 Jay Boutwell asked Dixie about Randy&apos;s sexual preferences, and she 

 appeared embarrassed.   Finally she said that Randy seemed to be 

 fixated on fellatio rather than straight intercourse. 

   

 &quot;You&apos;ve indicated that Randy did like girls,&quot; Boutwell said.   &quot;Did he 

 ever tell you how many girlfriends he had?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He just dated.   He had a lot of girlfriends he dated.   Different 

 ones.&quot; 

   

 &quot;If you were to draw an opinion of Randall, how would you say his 

 opinion toward women is?&quot;   Boutwell probed. 

   

 &quot;Well, I&apos;d say he likes women a lot.   He&apos;s crazy about them.   He&apos;s 

 just always talking nice about them whenever he&apos;s gone out with a 

 girl; he&apos;s always said nice things about her.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay.   You feel that he feels he&apos;s been wronged by women?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He could have, yeah.   He might have felt rejected a few times by 

 some.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Okay,&quot; Boutwell continued.   &quot;So you think that Randall liked girls, 

 but you had a feeling that he thought he&apos;d been wronged by 

 girls...he&apos;d felt rejection?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Maybe by a couple.   Well, he used to tell me that he couldn&apos;t 

 understand why girls stood him up.   And I used to tell him I couldn&apos;t 

 see why either, &apos;cause he was a good-looking guy.   And he goes, &apos;You 

 even stand me up.&apos; But he said that didn&apos;t matter because we were 

 just friends...and we kind of laughed about it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did he describe to you what he meant by the words &apos;stand up&apos;?   Did 

 he explain that to you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   He just said they&apos;d stood him up.   He just said he didn&apos;t know 

 why.   He said he was nice to them.   He didn&apos;t know why they stood him 

 up.&quot; 

   

 &quot;He indicate how many times this happened to him?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Quite a few.   He says girls always stand him up.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did you feel he had any hatred toward them?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No.   He didn&apos;t ever seem like he hated them.   Every time we ever 

 went out together, he was always asking a lot of girls to dance, and 

 he always seemed happy around them.   Always had a lot to talk to them 

 about, was always nice to them.&quot; 

   

 Neal Loper excused himself from the interview and went to a phone to 

 call DA.   Chris Van Dyke. 

   

 &quot;She&apos;s not telling us everything.   She&apos;s holding back.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Arrest her for hindering prosecution,&quot; Van Dyke decided.   &quot;I&apos;ll file 

 a material-witness complaint against her.&quot; 

   

 A shocked Dixie Palliter was advised of her rights under Miranda. 

 When she was placed under arrest, she suddenly remembered that she 

 had, indeed, seen Randy Woodfield with a silver .32-caliber gun in 

 his possession. 

   

 &quot;But I only saw it once.   He had it in the car, right after I brought 

 him the bullets, and he was trying to put the bullets in the gun.&quot; 

   

 Later, however, Dixie admitted to the detectives that she had seen 

 the gun again.   She had seen Randy cleaning the gun sometime before 

 Christmas 1980. 

   

 &quot;You still say you never went to Seattle with Randy?&quot; 

   

 She shook her head.   &quot;He asked me to go with him to see Tim so that 

 he could comfort Tim because Darci got murdered.   That was the week 

 before Christmas.   He also said that he was going to rob some stores 

 because he needed some Christmas money.   He told me about the 

 Baskin-Robbins deal when he got back.   He said he wore a Band-Aid over 

 his nose, a stocking cap, and a beard.   He said he always went to 

 where girls were working because they were easier.   He said he 

 switched jackets sometimes.&quot;   

   

 Dixie Palliter was proving to be an essential witness.   She was still 

 holding back a little.   Chris Van Dyke made the decision that Dixie 

 would have to be granted immunity from prosecution for whatever part 

 she might or might not have played in Randy&apos;s crimes.   Dixie insisted 

 to Van Dyke that that wouldn&apos;t be necessary; she was now telling the 

 whole truth. 

   

 Dixie told Jay Boutwell and Neal Loper that she had begun to wonder 

 if her good friend Randy might not be the I-5 Killer after she 

 watched television news.   She thought it was odd that all the places 

 where the I-5 Killer had struck were places where Randy had been. 

   

 &quot;I even mentioned my worries to him once, but he told me not to jump 

 to conclusions.   He wouldn&apos;t talk about it.   He&apos;d told me before that 

 I shouldn&apos;t tell anyone about the gun.   He told me that I should be 

 quiet about anything he told me.&quot; 

   

 Dixie Palliter was given a polygraph test, which she agreed to 

 willingly.   She said that she wanted to clear her name. 

   

 Lieutenant Teuscher of the Oregon State Police administered the test 

 at three PM.   on March 11. 

   

 Teuscher found that Dixie was deceptive in her negative responses to 

 the following questions: 

   

 &quot;Did Randy Woodfield tell you about killing anyone?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Were you with Randy Woodfield when he committed robberies or 

 murders?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did Randy Woodfield tell you where he threw the gun?   Or were you 

 with him?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you know the exact location where the gun was thrown or gotten 

 rid of?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Do you know where Randy Woodfield purchased the silver gun?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Have you ever been in the state of Washington with Randy Woodfield?&quot; 

   

 &quot;How many times have you purchased gun ammunition for Randy 

 Woodfield?&quot;   (When Dixie answered &quot;Once,&quot; the polygraph&apos;s leads 

 registered deception.) 

   

 &quot;Did Randy Woodfield ever give you any money which was the proceeds 

 of a robbery or theft?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Were you ever with Randy Woodfield when he committed any murders?&quot; 

   

 Dixie still was holding back.   And she always would.   But she had, of 

 necessity, been promised that nothing in the polygraph- test results 

 could be used against her in a court of law. 

   

 The silver .32 would never be found.   A hundred years from now, it 

 will probably still lie in the muck at the bottom of some river in 

 Washington, Oregon, or California.   Still, having the gun itself 

 would not be essential for conviction.   The bullets taken from the 

 heads of Beth Wilmot, Shari Hull, Janell Jarvis, and Donna Eckard, 

 and the bullet retrieved after the nonfatal shooting of the girl in 

 Sutherlin, Oregon, had all been fired from the same gun.   The lands 

 and grooves left by that gun&apos;s barrel were identical on the fatal 

 bullets under a scanning electron microscope.   Moreover, the lone .32 

 bullet found in Randy Woodfield&apos;s sports bag had been tested through 

 neutron-activation analysis at Oregon State University and its 

 essential elements were identical to the other bullets, suggesting 

 that it had almost certainly come from the same lot as all the other 

 .32 slugs retrieved.   All Remington Peters long. 

   

 This brand of .32 ammunition is rarely sold.   Even the biggest 

 outlets for ammunition traditionally sell only one or two boxes of 

 Remington Peters .32 bullets a year. 

   

 The bullet that had killed Julie Reitz had been a .38, probably fired 

 from a Model 60 Smith and Wesson revolver.   Shasta County Detective 

 Craig Wooden contacted firefighter Steve Eckard again to ask what 

 kind of bullets he had used in the weapon which had been stolen the 

 night his family was killed. 

   

 Eckard said that he had loaded his own bullets.   Wooden obtained some 

 examples of those bullets and hand-carried them to Neal Loper in 

 Beaverton.   They were full lead slugs, and one of them was of 

 particular interest.   It was jacketed with three-quarters of an inch 

 of copper and had a blunt-nosed lead end. 

   

 It was identical to the bullets taken from Julie Reitz&apos;s body. 

   

 It was only after Randy Woodfield had been arrested that the missing 

 .38 Smith and Wesson stolen from Steve Eckard&apos;s home surfaced.   And 

 it was found as a missing gun might have been found in a detective 

 novel.   A boy playing near the banks of the McKenzie River, which 

 divides Springfield from Eugene, glanced into the clear water and saw 

 the shiny barrel of a revolver.   He fished it out and turned it in to 

 the Eugene Police Department. 

   

 The gun had a stainless-steel barrel, so it had not rusted; the 

 serial number was easy to read.   A Eugene detective, not actively 

 involved in the Woodfield investigation, placed a routine call to 

 California.   &quot;We&apos;ve got a gun here that was probably stolen in a 

 burglary in your state.&quot; 

   

 He read off the serial number.   Within minutes the word came back. 

 &quot;That gun wasn&apos;t taken in a routine burglary--it came from a double 

 homicide scene in Mountain Gate!&quot; 

   

 Steve Eckard&apos;s gun had been thrown in a river only blocks from the 

 house on E Street where Randy Woodfield had rented a 

 room.   Because the barrel was in no way corroded, the gun was still 

 operable.   The lands and grooves matched.   The bullets from Julie 

 Reitz&apos;s brain had been fired from that gun. 

   

 And yet, as damning as it might seem, the gun could only be used as 

 circumstantial evidence.   No one had actually seen the person who had 

 thrown that gun into the McKenzie River. 

   

 The case against Randy Woodfield continued to grow...and 

 grow...and grow.   The phantom killer who had moved up and down the 

 Pacific Coast, convinced that no one would ever identify him, had 

 left all manner of clues. 

   

 Detective Ron Womack of the Beaverton Police Department had been 

 given the assignment of talking with Nancy, Randy&apos;s sister who lived 

 in Portland and with whom he had lived off and on when he was between 

 jobs. 

   

 Nancy recalled that Randy had arrived at her home on Friday night, 

 February 13.   He had gone out that evening, and returned, she 

 thought, very late.   The next morning, he&apos;d complained that he had a 

 hangover.   He had left that afternoon to have lunch, he said, with 

 someone named Dixie.   His sister had not seen him at all on Saturday 

 night. 

   

 Asked if there were any guns in her residence, she produced a 

 .22-caliber handgun which she&apos;d found, still in its holster, where it 

 had always been. 

   

 Womack had received a phone call from yet another of Randy 

 Woodfield&apos;s roster of female acquaintances.   This girl, Dru Casey, 

 who had met Randy a year and a half before, reported that something 

 odd had occurred at her home in Beaverton during the early hours of 

 the morning of Valentine&apos;s Day, 1981. 

   

 &quot;I was in bed at about a quarter to three in the morning.   My 

 boyfriend had just called me from eastern Oregon and asked me to 

 drive over and go skiing.   I told him I couldn&apos;t, and I went back to 

 bed after I&apos;d set my alarm for seven.   Suddenly I saw someone walk by 

 my bedroom window.   I got out my can of Mace and went to the window. 

 I saw a tall dark man outside, just a quick glance.   I didn&apos;t 

 recognize him as Randy Woodfield at the time.   The man tried my front 

 door, and I dialed the police department and ran out the back door. 

 Officer Jim Johnson came out and he checked the house, but he didn&apos;t 

 find anyone inside.   But someone had ripped my phone out of the 

 wall--inside the house--and the screen was off my bedroom window.   We 

 never did find out who the prowler was. 

   

 &quot;Later, I found out that Randy Woodfield had been in Beaverton that 

 weekend--and I wondered...&quot;

 The official indictment of Randall Brent Woodfield on murder and 

 attempted-murder charges came down from the Marion County grand jury 

 on March 16, 1981.   Randy would continue to be held without bail.   The 

 court appointed a defense attorney for Randy, and he was given the 

 cream of the crop: Charlie Burt.   Burt, a former president of the 

 Oregon state bar and the successful defense attorney in some of 

 Oregon&apos;s most publicized cases, began at once to prepare a defense. 

 Oregon justice moves swiftly; Randy Woodfield would stand trial 

 within ninety days. 

   

 Randy pleaded innocent to all of the charges. 

   

 A public hungry for details about the handsome ex-football hero would 

 have slim pickings.   A Portland television station showed footage of 

 a shiny silver gun, but it wasn&apos;t the gun actually used in Shari 

 Hull&apos;s murder.   Both Chris Van Dyke and Charlie Burt were angry that 

 the broadcast had implied that the actual gun had been found. 

   

 Burt told the press that his primary duty was to see that Randy 

 Woodfield got a fair trial, but he said he could find no cogent 

 reasons for seeking a change of venue from Marion County.   There had 

 been so much publicity that there was probably nowhere in Oregon 

 where potential jurors had not heard of his client. 

   

 &quot;Where do you change it to--maybe Mars?&quot;   Burt asked. 

   

 Dixie Palliter remained in jail under $290,000 bond.   Dixie&apos;s friends 

 talked to the press and explained that she wasn&apos;t the &quot;kind of girl 

 who would go out and try to get in trouble, but she&apos;s rather naive.&quot; 

   

 Dixie&apos;s mother stressed that her daughter hadn&apos;t been that close to 

 Randy.   &quot;He&apos;s been to the house a few times, but I think they&apos;re 

 being a little harsh on her myself.   She&apos;s never been in trouble. 

 You can&apos;t help it if someone you meet commits a murder.&quot; 

   

 If knowing a murder suspect was a felony, then there were several 

 hundred young women in Oregon who could be in jail right along with 

 Dixie.   Pretty girls all over the state were staring at Randy&apos;s face 

 on the news and shaking their heads.   He looked familiar to a lot of 

 them--some who&apos;d turned aside his advances, some who&apos;d dated him and 

 found him a little weird, and a few who had actually fallen for him. 

   

 On March 19 the hindering prosecution charges against Dixie Palliter 

 were dropped, and Dixie was held only as a material witness. 

   

 On March 24 Randy pleaded innocent to two counts of sodomy, two 

 counts of attempted kidnapping, and one count of being an ex-convict 

 in possession of a firearm in Linn County, these additional charges 

 the result of his alleged crimes in Albany, Oregon. 

   

 He had also been charged with one count of robbery in the 

 Baskin-Robbins holdup in Bothell, Washington. 

   

 Next came charges of sexual assault at the Dairy Queen in Bellevue, 

 Washington, on February 12. 

   

 On April 1 Randy pleaded innocent to seven felony charges in Benton 

 County, Oregon (Corvallis).   There were two counts of sodomy and one 

 count of burglary stemming from the attack on Merrisue and Megan 

 Green in their home, robbery and sexual- abuse charges from the 

 fabric store in Corvallis, and sodomy and kidnapping charges from the 

 February 25 incident at the fast- food restaurant in the same city. 

   

 If murder charges were to be filed in Beaverton in the murder of 

 Julie Reitz, and in Shasta County, California, in the double 

 homicides of Janell Jarvis and Donna Eckard, the authorities in those 

 jurisdictions were keeping mum about it.   Murder trials tend to come 

 about in order of time sequence.   The Salem murder had occurred in 

 January, 1981, and the California murders had been committed on 

 February 3&apos; with the Beaverton murder on February 14. 

   

 Marion County would have the first chance to confront Randy Woodfield 

 with its case.   However, it looked as though Randy Woodfield would 

 spend the coming months in court someplace, no matter what the 

 verdict was in the murder trial that lay ahead in Salem.   

   

 The Shari Hull-Beth Wilmot trial date would be set on May 5 in Marion 

 County Circuit Court.   Before those proceedings Randy was brought 

 down to Judge Wallace P.   Carson&apos;s court in the green coveralls 

 issued to all prisoners in the jail. 

   

 When he entered the second-floor anteroom, he saw that there were 

 spectators in the courtroom and he asked to be returned to the jail. 

 The request was granted, and he appeared a few minutes later wearing 

 gray slacks, a sports shirt, and a white V-neck sweater. 

   

 Randy Woodfield would continue to be concerned about his appearance 

 when the media were present. 

   

 The public had to make do with newspaper articles about Randy&apos;s 

 apparel and about Charlie Burt&apos;s demands that certain evidence be 

 declared &quot;fruit of the poison tree&quot;--that is, illegally seized--and 

 that victim identification of his client in the lineup be excluded 

 from the trial. 

   

 It was all part of the tactics that any good defense lawyer employs. 

 No one could ever say that Randy Woodfield did not have adequate 

 legal representation; Charlie Burt was one of the best. 

   

 And no one except the lawmen and the Marion County district attorney 

 himself really knew what Chris Van Dyke&apos;s game plan would be until 

 the actual trial began. 

   

 If Randy Woodfield&apos;s life was in limbo, so was Beth Wilmot&apos;s.   It was 

 arranged that Beth would work in the courthouse cafeteria; she would 

 be the prime prosecution witness, and she had to remain in Salem. 

 She also needed a way to make a living.   And so, while the man 

 alleged to have shot her stayed secluded in jail on the fourth floor 

 of the Marion County Courthouse, Beth worked in the basement 

 lunchroom, just down the hall from the detectives&apos; offices where Dave 

 Kominek worked.   She was still frightened, and Kominek talked with 

 her often, promising that everything would be all right. 

   

 The pretrial hearing began on May 28.   Charlie Burt alleged that 

 Randy had been illegally arrested and that the March 8 

 lineup had been improper.   He insisted that the parole violation 

 charge had been a &quot;sheer hoax,&quot; and he castigated Randy&apos;s earlier 

 attorneys for advising the defendant to appear in the lineup. 

   

 &quot;I would suggest that six months for contempt is better than life for 

 murder.&quot; 

   

 Dave Kominek testified that Woodfield&apos;s identification by victims of 

 the I-5 Killer was only one of five elements of direct evidence 

 linking him to the shootings at the TransAmerica Building.   He cited 

 the pubic-hair match, the telephone records, 

 the identification of Randy Woodfield by Marion County Deputy Bernie 

 Papenfus as the man he&apos;d seen near the shooting scene, and the bullet 

 found in Randy&apos;s Springfield residence as the other four elements. 

   

 Kominek argued that the search of the Bates home had been legal and 

 that Randy had been fully advised of his rights to remain silent 

 under Miranda.   

   

 Only one victim witness was called to testify at this pretrial 

 hearing: Beth Wilmot. 

   

 Beth described the events of January 18, and then Chris Van Dyke 

 asked her: &quot;Is that man in the courtroom?&quot; 

   

 Beth rose from the witness chair and walked stiffly toward the table 

 where Randy Woodfield sat.   She stood directly in front of him, her 

 hands clenched into fists. 

   

 Screaming, she cried, &quot;I hate you!   I hate you!   I hate you!&quot; 

   

 And then Beth walked back to the witness chair, sobbing. 

   

 Judge Clarke C.   Brown asked the press to use discretion in reporting 

 the scene they had just observed, but Beth&apos;s outburst was reported 

 faithfully in evening editions and on the television news.   There was 

 too much drama for newsmen to resist. 

   

 The actual trial promised even more headline stories.   The trial 

 loomed ahead, and both Beth and Randy had reason to dread it.   He 

 would be facing a life term, and Beth would have to repeat once again 

 the terrible details of the attack she and Shari Hull had endured. 

   

   

 21 

   

 Randy Woodfield&apos;s trial on charges of murder, attempted murder, and 

 sodomy began in earnest on June 9, 1981, in Marion County Circuit 

 Court Judge Clarke C.   Brown&apos;s courtroom in Salem.   The corridors 

 outside the windowless courtroom were clogged with would-be 

 spectators, reporters, artists (because cameras are not   allowed in 

 Oregon courts), and law-enforcement personnel.   No one would be 

 allowed to enter the courtroom until his briefcase or purse was 

 searched by Marion County deputies.   Body &quot;pat-downs&quot; were 

 accomplished by male and female deputies.   Three armed deputies stood 

 by inside the courtroom itself.   Feelings about the brutal shootings 

 in the TransAmerica Building were running too high to risk a replay 

 of what had happened in Dallas when Lee Harvey Oswald was shot and 

 killed by Jack Ruby. 

   

 Outside the Marion County Courthouse, magnolia trees, rhododendrons, 

 and azaleas were in full bloom, but they were buffeted by torrential 

 rains, the frigid wind belying the fact that it was June.   Inside the 

 wood-paneled room, the air was close and cloying.   There was no sense 

 of season at all.   There was no coolness.   But no one moved, and all 

 the spectators seemed willing to endure the discomfort so that they 

 might hear the details of this case that had not yet been revealed to 

 the public.   The courtroom was designed to hold only sixty 

 spectators.   Each of the four benches in the gallery was packed.   The 

 first two rows were reserved for the press, reporters, and artists 

 who sat barely three feet away from the man everyone had come to see: 

 Randall Brent Wood field.   Each time a reporter had to leave the 

 court room to call in a story on deadline, he asked others to take 

 notes for him.   So much was happening so fast that none of the press 

 dared risk missing something.   The artists, considerably hampered by 

 the cramped space, sketched continually nonetheless.   Images of the 

 man everyone wanted to see took form again and again on their huge 

 sketchpads. 

   

 But this Randy didn&apos;t look the way anyone expected. 

   

 Randy Woodfield had been touted in the media as a massively muscled 

 professional athlete.   The man in person seemed strangely diminished, 

 not a superman after all He scarcely resembled the cocky, grinning 

 prisoner who had been photographed as he was led into jail in March. 

 Three months behind bars can change a man. 

   

 Randy wore a gray-and-tan plaid shirt and gray slacks; the slacks 

 were too big for him now, and his tightly cinched belt gathered up 

 loose folds of cloth.   His two-tone saddle shoes looked collegiate, 

 but then, Randy seemed always to have clung to the glories of his 

 college days.   The schoolboy effect was marred by the manacles on his 

 ankles. 

   

 Occasionally Randy&apos;s dark eyes glanced toward the gallery.   His hair 

 was still permed into tight curls, and his jaw showed the blue-black 

 of a beard that must be shaved at least twice a day.   His skin was 

 muddy, pimpled, marked with old acne scars and the gray of jail 

 pallor; he had not seen the sun for a long time.   He sat slouched in 

 his chair, shoulders bent, and he no longer looked either powerful or 

 dangerous.   He looked, if anything, humble--a predatory creature 

 brought down and caged in mid-rampage. 

   

 Those in the gallery seemed a little disappointed.   They had expected 

 someone different.   They had expected to find the legendary &quot;I-5 

 Killer&quot; to be larger than life, and he was not.   The defendant didn&apos;t 

 look husky enough to play high-school football, much less for the 

 Green Bay Packers.   Indeed, he didn&apos;t look dangerous at all now. 

   

 Was he a killer?   That was another question altogether. 

   

 The underlying tension and tragedy in a murder trial are always 

 subtly hidden by proper courtroom procedure.   The prosecution and the 

 defense always begin with cordiality and politeness.   As does the 

 judge.   The fireworks come later--if at all. 

   

 Charlie Burt and Chris Van Dyke could not have been more opposite in 

 personality and appearance--Charlie, the old pro, a defense attorney 

 who seldom lost;going into yet another murder trial in his long 

 career, and Van Dyke, tall, exuberant, a Young Turk facing the first 

 murder trial of his career. 

   

 Burt dressed in conservative three-piece suits, while Van Dyke 

 occasionally would wear a sports jacket and slacks. 

   

 The young D.A.   grinned often, and, as always, reminded the gallery 

 of his father with the physical similarity and the way he moved.   But 

 this was not a half-hour television comedy; this trial was deadly 

 serious, and no one realized it more than Chris Van Dyke.   The last 

 seven months of his life had been totally taken up 

 with this case.   Like the detectives, he had had no real personal 

 life, he had missed sleep, and he had agonized over the problem, 

 first in catching the suspect and then in prosecuting him.   No matter 

 how many murder cases he might prosecute in the future, Van Dyke 

 would never, never forget this, his first. 

   

 Judge Brown also had tremendous burdens on his mind, his wife was in 

 the hospital, facing the possibility of quadruple bypass heart 

 surgery.   But he kept those worries to himself. 

   

 The proceedings began in a most civilized manner.   Judge Brown smiled 

 at the defendant.   &quot;Good morning, Mr. Woodfield.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Morning.&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield&apos;s voice was a surprise too; he sounded like a boy. 

 The soft voice his alleged victims had described did not match the 

 macho jock image. 

   

 &quot;Morning, gentlemen,&quot; Judge Brown said to the opposing attorneys. 

   

 And now the jury selection began.   There were fifty-five potential 

 jurors in the first jury pool.   The selection would move ahead 

 tediously.   Three of the would-be jurors were excused because they 

 said they had already reached a conclusion as to the defendant&apos;s 

 guilt or innocence.   Several of them knew witnesses or relatives of 

 the victims.   And then there were the usual excuses:   upcoming military 

 duty, vacations, and one man who told Brown that he would be of 

 &quot;dubious durability&quot; as a juror because he was &quot;nursing a kidney 

 stone.&quot; 

   

 Of major concern to both sides were the potential jurors attitudes 

 toward hypnotism, the credibility of physical evidence, and the 

 reliability of witness identification. 

   

 A repeated question from Chris Van Dyke dealt with the ability of an 

 individual to recreate in his mind something he has once experienced. 

 The DA wanted jurors with eidetic imagery- who could literally 

 &quot;see&quot; a memory on the &quot;TV screen&quot; of their minds. 

   

 Van Dyke questioned a former mayor of Salem, also a well-known sports 

 referee: &quot;Have you ever had anything happen to you that was so 

 frightening or so wonderful that you can c it without your eyes and 

 picture it again in your mind?&quot; 

   

 The answer was, &quot;No, I can&apos;t say that I can.&quot; 

   

 It was a fascinating question.   Those in the gallery who &quot;see with 

 their minds (almost all the reporters could) were surprised at the 

 number of prospective jurors who could not.   And it was essential to 

 the prosecution that jurors could understand how Beth Wilmot had 

 remembered the man who had shot her. 

   

 Chris Van Dyke asked one juror: &quot;Would you remember a person who 

 confronted you with a gun three and a half feet away in a 

 well-lighted room and later killed your best friend?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes...I think I would.&quot; 

   

 Charlie Burt was going at it from the opposite direction. 

   

 &quot;Do you think a person can think he recognizes someone and still be 

 mistaken?   There&apos;s going to be evidence that what she believes is not 

 true.&quot; 

   

 Again and again, Burt asked various would-be jurors if they had ever 

 approached someone they thought they knew, only to find out they were 

 mistaken. 

   

 And so the jury pool moved through the witness chair, people of all 

 ages from all walks of life--a pipe fitter, a meat cutter for Safeway, 

 a retired gentleman.   And finally a jury was selected.   They were all 

 Caucasian, four men, eight women, with one male and one female 

 alternate. 

   

 The final list included: an Oregon Department of Justice payroll 

 clerk, a teller at a Salem bank, a mathematician and freelance 

 writer, two housewives, an employee of Crown Zellerbach, a data 

 processor for the state of Oregon, an employee of the Oregon 

 Department of Revenue, a sheet-metal worker, a mechanical draftsman, 

 an insurance-company clerk, and a secretary for the Oregon State 

 Department of Revenue.   They ranged in age from twenty-seven to 

 fifty-six 

   

 The alternates were a forty-two-year-old female Greyhound bus driver 

 and a seventy-year-old man retired from the hotel- casino business in 

 Nevada. 

   

 A true cross-section of the Oregon population, they would decide 

 Randy Woodfield&apos;s future. 

   

 The trial began on Thursday, June 11, 1981.   Chris Van Dyke rose to 

 make the opening statement for the prosecution. 

   

 &quot;Despite his best efforts to disguise himself, a trail of evidence 

 was left by Randall Woodfield.   He left a &apos;road map&apos; of evidence. 

 The first thing he left behind was a living victim--who confronted 

 that man eyeball to eyeball.&quot; 

   

 Van Dyke listed the evidence, circumstantial and absolute physical 

 evidence, that the state would present to the jury: 

 The victim identification of the defendant in the lineup 

   

 ^burst into 

 the Oregon Museum Tavern and opened fire.   Within seconds, four 

 people were dead and nineteen wounded.   Moore had pleaded innocent by 

 reason of mental defect and was awaiting trial. 

   

 Van Dyke termed Burt&apos;s allusion to the Oregon Museum Tavern shooting 

 case as a &quot;red herring,&quot; saying that there was no evidence at all 

 that might link Moore to the TransAmerica shootings. 

   

 When the trial was a week old, Judge Brown made his final decision on 

 allowing the jury to view Moore.   The decision was that they would 

 not.   &quot;Mr.   Moore will not be called as a witness in this case,&quot; 

 Judge Brown said, &quot;because I feel it is immaterial and irrelevant 

 from the testimony I have received.&quot; 

   

   

                                   22 

   

 A trial is, in essence, the recreation of the crime the defendant is 

 accused of, and of the investigation that followed.   Beth Wilmot 

 would have to live through it again, just as all the detectives who 

 had sought the man who shot her would relive their months- long probe. 

   

 What it came down to was which witnesses the jury would believe. 

 Charlie Burt had suggested that Beth&apos;s testimony would be a bid for 

 sympathy, testimony from a young woman whose description of her 

 attacker had changed from one version to the next.   And, in a sense, 

 that was true.   Her description of the gunman changed slightly in the 

 five statements she&apos;d been asked to give to various authorities. 

 This variance would be one of the defense&apos;s strongest points.   She 

 had said during some stages after the attack that the man had dark 

 brown hair, and during others, that he had had brown hair or light 

 brown hair.   But the first description, the description given to Liz 

 Cameron, the Salem police dispatcher, the one that was freshest in 

 her mind immediately after she was shot, was: &quot;White male, about 

 twenty-seven, five feet, nine inches to six feet tall, dark brown 

 hair.   Band-Aid on nose, jeans, leather jacket.&quot; 

   

 Chris Van Dyke pointed out to the jury that that inventory of 

 characteristics closely matched the defendant. 

   

 Deputy Bernie Papenfus, who was not laboring under the disadvantage 

 of a bullet in his head, had seen the running man just after the call 

 for help came in.   And Papenfus identified Randy Woodfield as the man 

 he&apos;d seen.   Charlie Burt countered with the argument that no man 

 could run that far that fast.   But could an athlete in perfect 

 condition have run 1.2 miles in six minutes? 

   

 Papenfus disagreed with Burt&apos;s time estimate.   It was his 

 understanding, he said, that Beth had waited at least five minutes in 

 the TransAmerica Building before she called for help.   &quot;And I think 

 track people can come close to that [time].&quot; 

   

 Detective Jay Boutwell, who had ridden to the hospital with Beth, 

 said that, by that time, she had trouble focusing her attention.   He 

 had suggested that Beth describe the gunman by comparing him with the 

 people around her, and she&apos;d had only himself and the two paramedics 

 to compare her assailant with. 

   

 A nurse at the hospital testified, &quot;She said it [the man&apos;s hair] was 

 darker than Stuart&apos;s but lighter than Joyce&apos;s.&quot;   (The paramedics.) 

   

 Dr.   Robert Buza, the neurosurgeon who had taken the bullet from 

 Beth&apos;s head, testified that the pain medication she was receiving 

 when she described her attacker as having light brown hair &quot;is known 

 to cause temporary amnesia.&quot; 

   

 For spectators, the legal jousting was absorbing.   Burt was good, 

 very, very good.   He was folksy and low-keyed and he explained to the 

 jury that the defense had to play &quot;catch up&quot; after the prosecution 

 had a head start.   He would produce his own experts who were just as 

 authoritative as the prosecution&apos;s experts were. 

   

 For the defense, Dr. Kay Carlisle, an expert on hair identification 

 who worked at the primate Center in Portland, would assert that the 

 pubic hair could not be absolutely traced to Randy Woodfield--or to 

 any human source positively.   And that is true; hair and blood have 

 not yet been isolated scientifically so that they can be conclusively 

 traced to one source and one source alone.   Forensic-science experts 

 predict that, one day, hair and blood will be traced to one 

 individual, but that time is not yet here. 

   

 However, Steve Van Ootegham, a hair-and-fiber specialist from the 

 Oregon State Police Crime Lab, would testify that the pubic hair 

 found at the shooting scene and a pubic hair taken from Randy 

 Woodfield&apos;s body were microscopically indistinguishable.   &quot;There 

 would be only one chance in eight hundred that pubic hairs that look 

 the same under a microscope could come from different bodies.&quot; 

   

 Dr.   Stanley Abrams of Portland and Dr. Maurice MacDowell of Salem, 

 hypnosis experts who had checked the tape made by Dave Kominek during 

 Beth&apos;s hypnosis session, would testify for the defense that Kominek 

 had &quot;inadvertently destroyed her memory ability when he had told her 

 that she would be able to see the gunman&apos;s face.&quot; 

   

 Dave Kominek took the stand to validate his expertise at hypnosis. 

 He explained that he had had eighty-eight hours of professional 

 training in hypnosis and had used the art in about twenty police 

 investigations.   Burt objected on the grounds that Kominek was not 

 qualified to testify as an expert; he was overruled by Judge Brown. 

   

 &quot;Did you make any posthypnotic suggestions to Beth Wilmot?&quot;   Burt 

 asked, suggesting that the hypnosis had caused Beth to identify 

 Woodfield in the lineup on March 8. 

   

 &quot;No, sir.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Isn&apos;t it true that sometimes suggestions under hypnosis are purely 

 accidental?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes, sir.   But no names were mentioned during hypnosis because we 

 had no suspect at that time.&quot; 

   

 Dr.   George Bischel, a Salem psychiatrist, testified that there was 

 nothing improper about Kominek&apos;s hypnotic technique.   Bischel, who 

 has conducted at least a thousand hypnotic sessions, said that he had 

 reviewed the tapes and transcripts of the Marion County detective&apos;s 

 session with Beth and found that Kominek&apos;s approach was generally 

 accepted as valid. 

   

 While this preliminary testimony went on for a week, all the 

 policemen, experts, and forensic scientists laying out the structure 

 of the case day by day, Beth Wilmot waited downstairs in the 

 courthouse cafeteria.   She was nervous, but she was anxious to 

 testify.   She had confronted Randy Woodfield three times:   once during 

 the crime, once during the lineup in Springfield, and once during the 

 pretrial hearings.   Her fear of him had been defused, if only 

 slightly.   She would be in the same courtroom with him, but his legs 

 would be manacled; he could no longer harm her. 

   

 Still: how many of us would choose to relive a nightmare, to confront 

 the one thing that terrifies us the most? 

  

 All week, the spectators told each other that Beth Wilmot would be 

 testifying at any moment; there was disappointment when she did not 

 appear.   The gallery was not nearly as interested in the forensic 

 details as they were in actually seeing the young woman who had 

 survived the shootings in January. 

   

 Many of them had already seen Beth without realizing it, not knowing 

 that the pretty dark-haired girl sipping Cokes in the cafeteria was 

 the prize witness they all waited for.   This author talked with Beth 

 in the court house cafeteria.   Her hands trembled slightly, but her 

 smile was open. 

   

 &quot;I want to get it over with.   I&apos;m afraid, but, in a way, I&apos;m anxious 

 to tell the jury what happened.   I can&apos;t even be in the courtroom 

 until after I testify, and it&apos;s so hard waiting.&quot;   

   

 On Thursday, June 18, the rumors were true; Beth Wilmot would be 

 taking the witness stand. 

   

 Chris Van Dyke would make the questioning as easy on Beth as he 

 could; Beth had met with him many times, and she liked and trusted 

 him. 

   

 When Beth walked into the courtroom, there were slight gasps.   She 

 looked far younger than twenty-one.   They saw a tall, very thin girl 

 whose huge dark eyes seemed to dominate her oval face.   She looked a 

 little frightened, but the expression in her eyes was one of pure 

 hatred.   She stared down at Randy Woodfield, who seemed, at last, 

 ill-at-ease as he slouched at the defense table. 

   

 If it were possible, the courtroom was jammed with more people than 

 there had been before.   There were nine reporters and four artists, 

 their fingers flying over notebooks and sketchpads. 

   

 Van Dyke, whose every movement spoke of subdued energy, unfolded his 

 long legs from the prosecutor&apos;s chair and walked toward Beth. 

   

 The district attorney began with the easy questions, asking her 

 about her age, her occupation, and her close friendship with Shari 

 Hull.   Randy&apos;s eyes darted constantly from Beth to Van Dyke as he 

 followed this testimony closely. 

   

 Beth trembled almost imperceptibly, but her voice grew in strength. 

 She told about the janitor&apos;s job that she and Shari had shared.   &quot;We 

 got to the TransAmerica Title Company office on River Road about 

 nine-ten or nine-fifteen that Sunday night.   We were done with our 

 work in about twenty minutes.   Shari started the truck.   We were 

 ready to go, but we noticed a window was dirty.   I went to get the 

 spray bottle...When I came around the corner, he was standing there 

 with Shari.&quot; 

   

 Beth described the man who stood there holding a gun.   He&apos;d worn 

 jeans, tennis shoes, and a dark jacket with a hood covering his head. 

 &quot;He had a Band-Aid across the bridge of his nose.&quot;   

   

 &quot;Is he in the courtroom?&quot;   Van Dyke asked. 

   

 &quot;He is Right there,&quot; Beth answered.   She pointed to Randy Woodfield. 

   

 &quot;Are you sure?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No doubt.   That&apos;s the one.&quot; 

   

 Randy&apos;s expression didn&apos;t change at all.   But then, it seldom did; he 

 spent most of his time scribbling notes on the yellow legal pad in 

 front of him. 

   

 &quot;How far away from you was the man when you first saw him?&quot; 

   

 &quot;About three feet.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Were the lights on?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Yes.   It was very bright.   The gun barrel was aimed right at me when 

 the man ordered us to get in the back room.   He ordered us to take 

 our clothes off and lie on the floor there.&quot; 

   

 Asked to explain what happened next, Beth bowed her head and started 

 to cry.   It had been difficult enough for her to give a full 

 statement to Dave Kominek; now she would have to tell a packed 

 courtroom the intimate details of the attack she and Shari had 

 endured.   But it had to be done.   Beth told the jury that she and 

 Shari had been forced to perform oral sex on the intruder and that he 

 had commanded her to fondle Shari.   He had also attempted intercourse 

 with her. 

   

 Van Dyke led Beth gently through a recreation of the scene in which 

 her best friend died. 

   

 &quot;Shari was crying, begging him not to hurt her.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Where were you at this point?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I had my face against the Counter, and then I heard a shot.   He shot 

 her in the head.   He shot me.   He shot her again.   He shot me, and 

 she moaned and he shot her again.&quot; 

   

 Tears had welled up again in Beth&apos;s eyes, and she fought to retain 

 her composure. 

   

 &quot;I pretended I was dead.   I was afraid that he would shoot me a third 

 time.   He shot Shari the third time because she moaned.   I couldn&apos;t 

 hear anything except for the ringing in my ears.   I waited about five 

 minutes before I got up, and then I went into the bathroom and looked 

 in the mirror, and the whole right side of my face was swollen.&quot; 

   

 Beth explained that she had been rescued by the sheriff&apos;s officers 

 and the paramedics and that she had spent the next several days in 

 the hospital. 

   

 &quot;Did you have any aftereffects of the attack beyond your head 

 wounds?&quot;   Van Dyke asked. 

   

 Beth looked down.   &quot;Yes.   About ten days later, I learned from a 

 doctor that I had contracted herpes and that that is a disease 

 usually transmitted by sexual contact.&quot; 

   

 Charlie Burt&apos;s job in cross-examination was difficult.   A kind man, 

 but a keen-minded attorney, he now had to play the &quot;bad guy&quot; in 

 questioning a trembling, crying girl. 

   

 He asked her a little about herpes.   It was clear that Burt hoped to 

 suggest that Beth might have had herpes for some time--that she had 

 suffered, not a first episode, but a recurrence of the disease after 

 the attack. 

   

 She was adamant that she had never had it before the night of January 

 18.   She described what she now faced for the rest of her life. 

   

 &quot;It can go away, but you never get rid of it,&quot; Beth explained.   &quot;It&apos;s 

 in your blood system.   I can get something at the drugstore, but 

 there is no cure.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did you have sexual intercourse in the month preceding the 

 incident?&quot;   Burt asked. 

   

 &quot;No.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Have you ever had intercourse?&quot; 

   

 Van Dyke objected, and Judge Brown sustained the objection.   The 

 sexual history of rape victims is often an issue in trials; women who 

 have already endured a major psychic shock are put in a position of 

 having to defend their morals.   But Judge Brown was not going to 

 allow this to happen to Beth Wilmot. 

   

 Burt&apos;s main thrust was not Beth&apos;s sexual history, however.   He wanted 

 to shake her on her memory of the man who had shot her.   He 

 questioned her repeatedly on the color of her assailant&apos;s hair. 

   

 &quot;You said that your assailant had a hood over his head.   Your best 

 recollection is that you don&apos;t know what color his hair is, do you?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No...but his eyebrows were dark.   I don&apos;t think he&apos;d have blond 

 hair.&quot; 

   

 &quot;How many photographs of men did you look at after the shooting?&quot; 

 Burt asked. 

   

 &quot;About a hundred, but I didn&apos;t recognize any of them.&quot; 

   

 &quot;When did you first see a picture of the defendant?&quot; 

   

 &quot;In March when Detective Holloway came to Spokane and showed me 

 pictures of five men.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did you identify Mr. Woodfield at that time?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I made a tentative identification of one of the men, but I wasn&apos;t 

 sure.   I told him I didn&apos;t want to pick anyone out I wasn&apos;t sure of.&quot; 

   

 Van Dyke asked Beth what had caused her to pick Randy Woodfield from 

 the lineup. 

   

 &quot;His whole body--his forehead, his nose, his shoulders--just 

 everything about him.&quot; 

   

 After two hours on the witness stand, Beth was excused.   She had 

 balked at giving her address at the time of the shooting, because she 

 still visited there.   and she was afraid.   Local papers 

 agreed not to print that address, and they kept the promise.   

   

 On the ninth day of the trial, Dixie Palliter-Randy&apos;s old friend from 

 Beaverton testified.   Considerably chastened now, and no longer so 

 anxious to protect Randy, Dixie told the jury that Randy had had a 

 gun and that he&apos;d told her he&apos;d thrown it in a river after the 

 shootings on River Road. 

   

 Evidence was introduced that he had acquired a box of the rarely sold 

 .32-caliber long Colt bullets about a month before Shari and Beth 

 were shot.   &quot;I bought a box of bullets for him on December 19 from 

 the G.I.   Joe store in Milwaukie.   He checked to see if they would 

 fit a silver gun he had with him.   I saw him cleaning the same gun 

 about the first week of January.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Did Randy ever talk to you about disguises?&quot;   Van Dyke asked. 

   

 &quot;He said something about a Band-Aid over his nose.&quot; 

   

 Van Dyke called gun-shop employees to demonstrate to the jury just 

 how rare the .32 long Colt bullets were. 

   

 The manager of G.I.   Joe&apos;s said that of the 3,039 boxes of ammunition 

 sold in her store in 1980, only four boxes were Remington Peters .32 

 long Colts. 

   

 The manager of a sporting-goods store in Salem Said that his store 

 had sold seven hundred and fifty boxes of pistol ammunition over a 

 nine-month period. 

   

 &quot;How many of those were .32 long Colts?&quot;   Van Dyke asked 

   

 &quot;Two.   We have six boxes of that type of bullet on our shelves, and 

 some of them have been there for twenty years.&quot;   

   

 It was to be a full day.   Penny Hale, eighteen, who&apos;d met Randy at 

 TGI Friday in Beaverton on January 10, a week before the Salem 

 shootings, described the hooded dark leather jacket he&apos;d worn that 

 night--very similar to the coat Beth had described. 

   

 Penny told the jury that Randy had followed her home, stayed until 

 four A.M., and that she had avoided all his calls since.   The calls 

 that had trapped Randy by placing him in the vicinity of the 

 TransAmerica shootings had been made to Penny&apos;s apartment. 

   

 &quot;There were four or five calls on January 18,&quot; Penny testified.   &quot;The 

 last call came at nine.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Are you sure that call didn&apos;t come in around eight?&quot;   Burt 

 asked. 

   

 &quot;No, it was at nine,&quot; she answered firmly. 

   

 Dave Kominek took the witness stand again.   He explained that the 

 vital telephone calls had come from phone booths at Independence at 

 one minute after nine P.M., and then from Woodburn at ten-thirty-one 

 P.M. 

   

 &quot;Did you drive between those booths to estimate the time required?&quot; 

 Van Dyke asked Kominek. 

   

 &quot;Yes, sir.   I drove several routes from Independence to Salem, and 

 from Salem to Woodburn.&quot; 

   

 &quot;And what did you find, as regards to time?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Trips from Independence to Salem took between twenty-one and 

 twenty-eight minutes.&quot; 

   

 The shootings, of course, had taken place just outside Salem between 

 nine-thirty-five and nine-fifty P.M.   Randy&apos;s driving time was, at 

 the most, forty-five minutes from one phone booth to the other; that 

 left almost an hour unaccounted for-more than enough time for him to 

 have shot Shari and Beth. 

   

 Captain Dave Bishop, who, along with Neal Loper, was the first of the 

 hundreds of officers in the long probe to home in on Randy Woodfield, 

 testified on this tenth day of trial: &quot;I could see Beth Wilmot&apos;s face 

 when she viewed the lineup.   It appeared that she had seen a ghost. 

 She was extremely frightened.&quot;   

   

 Bishop also told the jury that he had heard Randy admit that he had 

 herpes. 

   

 The ends of the case had been so tangled, but now, in the courtroom, 

 they were coming together in a pattern that made ultimate sense. 

   

 Almost every day of the trial now, there were enough histrionics to 

 titillate the gallery. 

   

 Arden Bates, apparently consumed with guilt that she had helped the 

 police trap her former housemate, testified that Randy was &quot;one of 

 the nicest people you&apos;d ever want to meet&quot; and described the weeks 

 that he had lived in her home in Springfield.   No longer did she see 

 him as a womanizing macho man; she might have been describing the 

 perfect boy next door.   As she left the courtroom, she suddenly threw 

 her arms around Randy and started to cry.   She had to be pulled away 

 from him by a courtroom deputy. 

   

 For Randy Woodfield, the trial must seem like a black-humor.   This Is 

 Your Life, with D.A.   Chris Van Dyke as the M.C.   Many of Randy&apos;s old 

 girlfriends testified, and now he watched as a former convict-buddy 

 took the stand.   When Van Dyke asked Tony Niri, twenty-nine, how long 

 he had known Randy, Niri answered that he had known him &quot;socially&quot; 

 since September 1975. 

   

 &quot;Socially&quot; in this case meant that they&apos;d done time together in the 

 Oregon State Penitentiary. 

   

 Niri said that he had seen Randy on occasion wearing a hooded jacket, 

 gloves...and a Band-Aid across his nose.   He also said that he&apos;d seen 

 Randy carrying a dull chrome pistol around in late 1980, a &quot;small 

 revolver.&quot; 

   

 Charlie Burt, of course, took advantage of the fact that Niri was an 

 ex-con, and ex-cons are notoriously suspect witnesses.   When he asked 

 the witness a question about guns, Niri said he really didn&apos;t know 

 much about guns. 

   

 &quot;You&apos;d have to know something about guns to be an armed robber, 

 wouldn&apos;t you?&quot;   Burt asked sarcastically. 

   

 &quot;Not really,&quot; was Niri&apos;s mild reply. 

   

 The defense began its case on June 23.   Charlie Burt worked hard to 

 convince the jury that Randy Woodfield sat in the defendant&apos;s chair 

 solely because he had been mistakenly identified.   He went over the 

 discrepancies in hair color again.   He told the jury that Beth 

 Wilmot&apos;s description, overheard by paramedics, fit Lawrence Moore, 

 the suspect in the Oregon Museum Tavern slayings, far more closely 

 than it did Randy Woodfield. 

   

 Indeed, the paramedics had actually seen a person on Church Street 

 N.E., after they&apos;d left the emergency room, who resembled the man 

 Beth Wilmot had described.   The man had looked more like a picture of 

 Lawrence Moore, according to the medics. 

   

 The usual &quot;war of the psychologists&quot; took place.   Dr. Maurice 

 McDowell told the jury that he didn&apos;t believe anything &quot;pertinent&quot; 

 had resulted from Kominek&apos;s hypnosis of Beth. 

   

 And then Burt called Kay Carlisle, the scientist from the Oregon 

 Regional Primate Research Center in Portland. 

   

 &quot;I don&apos;t believe hair should ever be used to identify a person,&quot; 

 Carlisle said.   &quot;The only exception would be a case involving 

 congenital abnormalities where rare types of hair were produced&quot; 

   

 Carlisle said she had examined the same hairs that Ootegh am had and 

 that she couldn&apos;t even say for sure that they were pubic hairs, much 

 less identify the person they&apos;d come from. 

   

 It was really a matter of which experts the jury would believe. 

   

 Shelley Janson was standing behind her fiance.   She still did not 

 believe that Randy had anything to do with the shootings on January 

 18, 1981, or, indeed, with any of the other crimes he had been 

 accused of.   Although it must have been exquisitely embarrassing for 

 her, Shelley took the stand and told the jury that she had known 

 Randy since December 30, 1980, and was prepared to answer questions 

 about their most intimate relations.   

   

 In answer to Burt&apos;s questions, Shelley said that she had been 

 intimate with Randy several times. 

   

 &quot;And did you contract herpes?&quot; 

   

 &quot;No, sir.   I did not.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Have you ever seen Randall with a hat on?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He never wore either a hat or a hood.   It would look funny on his 

 hair.&quot; 

   

 This statement seemed to be straining at gnats.   If Randy Woodfield 

 had used hats and hoods as a disguise, he probably had done so to 

 change his normal appearance, and &quot;looking funny&quot; would not have 

 mattered. 

   

 In reality, Shelley had seen her lover such a pitifully few times--a 

 few days at the end of December and a weekend in San Francisco. 

 After that, she had only seen him behind bars.   It would seem 

 impossible for Shelley to know what his usual habits were, or what he 

 usually wore on his head. 

   

 For Shelley, who had seen her dreams of the future vanish like smoke, 

 the only small comfort was that she had not contracted her fiance&apos;s 

 herpes. 

   

 The trial had been going on for more than two weeks now, and tempers 

 were eroding.   At times, Chris Van Dyke and Charlie Burt appeared to 

 be about to leap at each other&apos;s throats, arguing, and, according to 

 Judge Brown, playing up to the press. 

   

 &quot;Both of you are attempting to try this case in the newspapers,&quot; 

 Brown snapped.   &quot;I&apos;m telling you, we&apos;re going to quit talking to the 

 press!&quot; 

   

 The jury didn&apos;t hear that exchange, nor had the jury seen any media 

 coverage of the case.   But the public was lapping it up. 

   

 Randy Woodfield had scrupulously avoided looking back at the gallery 

 during the entire trial.   But on June 25 he had to face them head-on. 

 Randy was going to testify. 

   

 It was risky.   Most defense attorneys urge their clients not to take 

 the stand; it gives the prosecution too many opportunities to ask 

 embarrassing questions on cross-examination.   But Randy wanted to 

 testify in his own behalf.   He wanted to explain just where he was on 

 the night of January 18, 1981. 

   

 Randy seemed almost nonchalant as he took the stand, as if he had no 

 part in these proceedings.   He did not, however, look at the jury 

 while he testified, a definite error for the defense in body language. 

   

 Burt quickly asked Randy about his previous convictions for robbery 

 and indecent exposure.   If Burt brought out his client&apos;s criminal 

 record first, it would take the option away from Van Dyke, and it 

 would show that the defense was not trying to hide anything from the 

 jury. 

   

 Randy told the jury that he had been driving between Springfield and 

 Portland on the night that Beth and Shari were attacked.   That trip 

 would have taken about two and a half hours, if one went by way of 

 Independence.   And, of course, that would have accounted for Randy&apos;s 

 time during the vital period between nine-thirty and ten P.M. 

   

 Randy said he&apos;d stopped at a bar in Independence and had several 

 beers that night.   However, on crossexamination, Randy told Chris Van 

 Dyke that he couldn&apos;t remember where the bar was, or what its 

 interior looked like.   &quot;It was just one of your average bars.&quot; 

   

 Randy admitted that he had stopped in North Salem on the way from 

 Independence to Woodburn.   He had bought beer at a convenience store, 

 made a phone call, and looked at some new cars in a car lot. 

   

 No, he didn&apos;t own a coat with a hood.   No, he had never worn 

 Band-Aids on his nose. 

   

 Yes, he had bought a silver-plated pistol from an acquaintance in the 

 fall of 1980, and he admitted that a friend had bought him a box of 

 shells, but he&apos;d told his friend later that he&apos;d thrown the gun away. 

   

 &quot;I wasn&apos;t supposed to have it,&quot; he said, adding that he was already 

 having problems with his parole officer because he changed addresses 

 so often.   &quot;I didn&apos;t want to go back to prison.&quot; 

   

 Randy testified that he had at one time feared that he had herpes and 

 that he&apos;d told a friend about it.   &quot;But none of my girlfriends ever 

 complained that they had caught it.&quot; 

   

 He was on the stand only thirty minutes, and he had said nothing that 

 might truly help his cause.   His alibi, even viewed generously, was 

 weak. 

   

 Reporters speculated in print about Randy&apos;s demeanor during this long 

 trial, a trial that could put him in prison for life.   He appeared to 

 them as if he were only an observer, not the defendant.   He was 

 handsome, he dressed nicely, and he had pretty, well- dressed 

 girlfriends.   He didn&apos;t look the way killers are supposed to look. 

   

 But then, few killers do. 

   

 The trial was winding down.   Dr. Stanley Abrams from Portland 

 arrived, directly from a week-long meeting of the Northwest 

 Telegraphers&apos; Association, to repudiate the validity of eyewitness 

 identification. 

   

 &quot;Eyewitness testimony is very poor--particularly in an emotional 

 situation,&quot; Abrams said. 

   

 In answer to Burt&apos;s questions, Abrams said it was possible that Beth 

 had identified Randy in the police lineup because he was the only man 

 in the lineup whose picture she had seen earlier. 

   

 On cross-examination, Van Dyke asked Abrams to examine the lay-down 

 of photos that Monty Holloway had shown to Beth at the Spokane 

 airport. 

   

 The most significant thing, I think, is the hairstyle,&quot; Abrams said 

 &quot;Only one other person in this group has an Afro that resembles 

 Woodfield&apos;s.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Would you point out the photograph of the defendant?&quot;   Van Dyke 

 asked. 

   

 Abrams picked the wrong man! 

   

 You mean another person looked more like Woodfield in the throw-down 

 than Woodfield in the lineup?&quot; 

   

 Asked to try once more to pick the defendant, Dr. Abrams again picked 

 a wrong man! 

   

 Abrams smiled, embarrassed.   The gallery broke into titters, and 

 Chris Van Dyke, turning away so that the jury could not see him broke 

 into a wide grin. 

   

 The defense&apos;s own witness had scored &apos;a big one for the prosecution. 

   

 Late on Thursday, June 25, Chris Van Dyke presented two rebuttal 

 witnesses.   A Portland woman who had been training Randy in the art 

 of bartending said that she had often seen him wearing a waist-length 

 leather jacket with a hood. 

   

 A Salem physician testified that herpes is transmitted through sexual 

 contact but that a herpes carrier does not always infect his partner. 

 If the disease is in remission, the carrier is not infectious. 

   

 It was all over but the final arguments, and they would come on 

 Friday morning.   Judge Brown turned to the jurors.   &quot;Bring your 

 toothbrushes and pajamas tomorrow.&quot; 

   

 The jury would be sequestered during deliberation.   If they did not 

 reach a verdict by Friday evening, they would spend the weekend, 

 perhaps the next week, away from their homes. 

   

 Chris Van Dyke spoke first.   He suggested that Woodfield&apos;s manner on 

 the witness stand had hardly been that of an innocent man.   &quot;It was 

 the demeanor of an arrogant, cold, unemotional 

 individual.&quot; 

   

 And then Van Dyke went through the damning testimony and physical 

 evidence that had come out during the protracted trial: 

   

 Positive ballistics and hair comparisons; eyewitness identification 

 by a victim who had been left for dead; friends who had seen Randy 

 with a Band-Aid for disguise; friends who had seen Randy wearing the 

 hooded leather jacket. 

   

 According to Van Dyke, everything presented had led directly back to 

 Randall Brent Woodfield as the man who had shot Beth Wilmot and Shari 

 Hull. 

   

 Burt contended that Beth Wilmot&apos;s descriptions of her attacker had 

 varied a good deal and that the description had grown more detailed 

 as time went on.   &quot;She&apos;s simply been adding to it because people have 

 been pestering her.&quot; 

   

 Charlie Burt proposed that Randy&apos;s activities on the night in 

 question were such that he could not have been in Keizer at the time 

 the attacks took place.   He had been traveling, Burt said, during the 

 time he was supposed to have been in the TransAmerica Building. 

   

 &quot;Hair is a valuable tool,&quot; Burt said scathingly, &quot;but only if you 

 want to nail someone.&quot; 

   

 Chris Van Dyke had one more chance to speak to the jury.   &quot;Randy 

 Woodfield says he can&apos;t remember any details of the tavern.   If I&apos;d 

 been accused of murder, I&apos;d make dam sure I&apos;d remember where I was!&quot; 

   

 There was one aspect of the case that no one has ever been able to 

 explain, and Van Dyke admitted that he couldn&apos;t either. 

   

 &quot;I can&apos;t tell you why someone who seemed to have everything going for 

 him would commit murder.&quot;   

   

 And then it was over--all over except for the deliberations of the 

 jury. 

   

 It took them only three and a half hours, and only one vote.   The 

 decision was unanimous on that.   first vote: guilty.   Guilty of 

 murder.   Guilty of attempted murder.   Guilty of two counts of sodomy. 

   

 Beth Wilmot and Shari Hull&apos;s mother were in the gallery when those 

 verdicts were read.   They both broke into tears. 

   

 But later, as she reached the second-floor elevator, Beth Wilmot was, 

 at last, smiling.   

   

 &quot;This is the happiest day of my life,&quot; she said. 

   

 An equally happy Chris Van Dyke gave credit for the strong 

 prosecution case to &quot;high-quality policework and a very courageous 

 victim.&quot;   He estimated that the case had occupied his life full-time 

 for two months and that it had cost an already financially pressed 

 county a quarter of a million dollars. 

   

 But for Randy Woodfield it was only round one.   Many, many trials lay 

 ahead of him.   Charlie Burt told reporters that Randy seemed to have 

 accepted the verdict, that he understood that was the way the 

 judicial system worked, and that he did not seem bitter. 

   

 Indeed, in a letter written to a friend a few days later, Randy 

 sounded anything but bitter.   Once again he was counting on God and 

 religion to see him through, although Shelley was visiting him and 

 writing him often. 

   

 He wrote that he was awaiting another psychiatric evaluation for his 

 PSI (pre-sentence investigation) report.   He then expected to gear up 

 for the next trial, to be held in Albany. 

   

 He vowed he would seek psychiatric help from the state mental 

 hospital because he was now convinced (once again) that his penchant 

 for robberies and sexual assaults was something he had no control 

 over.   He compared the period just past to a dream from which he was 

 slowly emerging. 

   

 Whatever the courts and the psychiatrists at the state hospital 

 should decide, Randy wrote that he had focused on his future.   He 

 would work hard, wherever he was, to seek the Lord and become a 

 minister. 

   

 Randy had told Dave Kominek in Springfield that he had told God to 

 take a backseat.&quot;   Now, as always, when Randy was backed to the wall, 

 he talked fervently about religion and seeking psychiatric help. 

   

 He asked his friend to read Romans 8:28: &quot;And we know that all 

 things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are 

 called according to his purpose.&quot; 

   

 Those who had sought Randy&apos;s conviction and imprisonment felt the 

 same way. 

   

   

 23 

   

 During the summer of 1981, the months that followed his conviction on 

 all charges in the first trial in what promised to be an almost 

 endless series of trials, Randy Woodfield existed in a kind of limbo. 

 He had not been sentenced, nor would he be until the fall.   Whatever 

 the sentences would be, he surely faced years and years in prison. 

 Randy continued to read his Bible, and to send scores of letters out 

 to friends.   He was once again the pious, subdued Randy.   All of the 

 rampaging sexual attacks had apparently become, in his own mind, only 

 &quot;a dream.&quot; 

   

 He, the real Randy, was coming back to reality, a reality that he 

 seemed to have fashioned for himself.   If his crimes had taken place 

 while he was in a dream or a fugue state, then no one could blame him. 

   

 And surely he would not have to take any responsibilities for his 

 attacks on women; those attacks had been committed by the &quot;dream&quot; 

 Randy. 

   

 Oddly, Woodfield seemed to bear Dave Kominek no particular grudge, no 

 more than a player on a losing football team might resent his 

 counterpart on the winning squad.   Kominek&apos;s side had won this one. 

 The detective and the convicted killer talked in Randy&apos;s cell 

 sporadically during the weeks after the Hull-Wilmot trial.   On one 

 such visit that took place just before sentencing, Kominek suggested 

 to Randy that he might venture some hypotheses about the Darci 

 Fix-Doug Altic murders.   Randy made no objections, and sat back to 

 listen to the detective&apos;s theories. 

   

 &quot;This is strictly between us, Randy,&quot; Kominek began.   &quot;But this is 

 the way I think it happened.   I think you were very, very angry with 

 Darci for dumping your friend, Tim Rossi.   I think you were even so 

 angry that you thought she should die.   You were disgusted with the 

 kind of woman who would walk off and leave her boyfriend hurting.   It 

 happened to you, and you didn&apos;t like the fact that Darci had done it 

 to Tim.   I think you went to her house last Thanksgiving Day.&quot;   

   

 Randy didn&apos;t move; he held his muscles taut, waiting. 

   

 &quot;You had a gun with you.   I think the gun was the .357, the one with 

 the interchangeable barrels that belonged to Tony Niri, your friend 

 from the joint.   You saw Darci and Doug having a great time, not 

 caring about what they&apos;d done to Tim.   And you put the gun to the 

 backs of their heads and you blew them away.   Then you found Darci&apos;s 

 gun--a little silver gun her father had given her and you took that. 

 I think you used that little silver gun a lot.   When it got too hot 

 to keep, you threw it in a river.   Isn&apos;t that right?&quot; 

   

 Randy&apos;s dark eyes bore steadily into Kominek&apos;s.   He was silent for 

 seconds, minutes--and then he nodded slowly. 

   

 It was a moot victory for Kominek.   A small personal satisfaction 

 that one part of the puzzle had been clarified.   &quot;But we couldn&apos;t use 

 it,&quot; he recalls.   &quot;Those other guns were gone--probably forever. 

 Still, when I laid out the Fix-Altic murder case to Randy, he never 

 contradicted me.   I&apos;m still convinced he killed them.&quot; 

   

 Kominek also suspected that Woodfield had killed many, many more 

 women than he had ever been accused of.   There had been four murders 

 of pretty young women in Huntington Beach, California, homicides that 

 occurred during a period when Randy visited there. 

   

 There were the unsolved murders of Marsha Weatter, nineteen, and 

 Kathy Allen, eighteen, in Washington State.   The girls&apos; homes were in 

 Fairbanks, Alaska, but they&apos;d been traveling in the Continental 

 Forty-eight when they vanished.   The pair was last seen hitchhiking 

 two miles west of Spokane at the junction of Interstate 90 and U.S. 

 Highway 2 on March 28, 1980.   They were seasoned hikers who 

 considered themselves capable and strong; they carried full backpacks 

 as they held their thumbs out. 

   

 A college student recalled having given Marsha and Kathy a ride from 

 Missoula, Montana, to Spokane, and they indicated that their plan was 

 to hitch to Seattle, 270 miles west.   From there, they planned to 

 catch a flight home to Fairbanks on March 31. 

   

 But they never made the plane, and they never came home again. 

   

 Months later, long after the volcanic eruption of Mt.   St.   Helens on 

 May 18, 1980, the bodies of Marsha Weatter and Kathy Allen were 

 discovered close to the I-90 freeway, buried beneath the fine gray 

 ash that blanketed eastern Washington when Mt.   St.   Helens blew. 

 Like the victims of ancient Pompeii, the girls had lain buried, not 

 by any human hand, but by nature. 

   

 They had each been shot in the head. 

   

 Late March, 1980, was just before the time Randy Woodfield started 

 working at the Faucet Tavern.   He was between jobs, he had no steady 

 girlfriend at the time, and he was a constant traveler on his days 

 off. 

   

 Even so, it was a fairly remote possibility to conclude that Randy in 

 his gold Volkswagen had veered off his favorite North-South I-5 

 corridor to troll for female victims two hundred miles away from 

 Beaverton.   The Weatter-Allen murders have never been solved, and 

 they remain a question mark in Dave Kominek&apos;s mind.   Another darker 

 question mark is the murder of twenty-one-year old Sylvia Durante, a 

 beautiful young cocktail waitress at the Red Robin restaurant, a 

 popular &quot;yuppie&quot; super-hamburger watering hole in Seattle.   The Red 

 Robin was located just off I-5 in the University of Washington 

 district, hard by the Lake Washington Ship Canal Bridge.   It was 

 crowded every night and packed to the rafters on weekends. 

   

 Sylvia&apos;s body was found in the bedroom of her apartment in December 

 1979.   Investigating Seattle Homicide Detective Gary Fowler noted 

 marks on her ankles and wrists that suggested she had been bound 

 before she was strangled. 

   

 There were flowers from a secret admirer nearby, and there was no 

 apparent forced entry.   The victim had undoubtedly trusted the wrong 

 man, invited him in and allowed him to visit her at her home. 

   

 Sylvia Durante was a lovely brunette, a vibrant girl--filled with joy 

 for life, and, like Shelley Janson, she had been actively seeking the 

 one right man for her.   Sylvia preferred dark-haired, muscular men. 

 Randy Woodfield fit her qualifications precisely.   But did Sylvia 

 Durante ever meet Randy?   No one will ever know. 

   

 There is no physical evidence linking Randy to Sylvia Durante&apos;s 

 murder.   However, traffic citation records indicate that Randy 

 Woodfield was in Seattle during the week before Sylvia&apos;s death.   He 

 had even played Good Samaritan to a young nurse whose car ran out of 

 gas shortly after she left work on the night shift at the University 

 Hospital. 

   

 The nurse had been wary of the big dark-haired man at first, but he&apos;d 

 been so boyishly charming that she&apos;d finally relented and locked her 

 car, allowing him to drive her home.   He&apos;d been such a gentleman 

 and had rescued her from a long hike in the wee hours; she even gave 

 him a kiss good night. 

   

 The University Hospital is located a scant half-mile from the Red 

 Robin.   And the Red Robin is to the University District what 

 O&apos;CalIahan&apos;s and De Frisco&apos;s were to Eugene, the yuppie pick-up spot. 

 Randy would have gravitated to it like a beacon in the night. 

   

 A close perusal of the voluminous files on the Durante case, however, 

 elicits no mention of a &quot;Randy.&quot;   There is a letter that Sylvia wrote 

 to a cousin, a letter in which she writes enthusiastically about 

 meeting an interesting man from Portland--a man she hoped to see when 

 she visited there during the Thanksgiving holidays, 1979.   Was that 

 man Randy Woodfield?   No one knows.   The trail that might link Sylvia 

 Durante to Randy ends there. 

   

 Again, is the Durante case simply a questionable combination of 

 geographical locations and timing?   Of fascinating circumstantial 

 similarities?   Without more evidence, it would be premature to link 

 the three Washington State deaths to Randy Woodfield. 

   

 Woodfield certainly didn&apos;t need any more trouble.   As it was, he 

 faced so many trials that he might expect to spend the next several 

 years going from court to court to court. 

   

 On August 28, 1981, The Municipal Court of Redding Judicial District, 

 County of Shasta, State of California, officially charged Randall 

 Brent Woodfield for a violation of Section 187 of the California 

 Penal Code.   In legalese, the criminal complaint rend: 

   

 &quot;Rick Burnett of Shasta County Sheriff&apos;s Office, in the county of 

 Shasta, being first duly sworn, on information and belief, complains 

 and accuses defendant Randall Brent Woodfield of the following 

 crimes: 

   

 COUNT I: 

   

 The said defendant, Randall Brent Woodfield, on or about February 3, 

 1981, in the county of Shasta, state of California did willfully, 

 unlawfully, and with malice aforethought murder Donna Lee Eckard, a 

 human being. 

   

 It is further alleged that in the commission of the above offense, 

 the said defendant personally used a firearm, to wit: a handgun, 

 within the meaning of Penal Code Section 12022.5. 

   

 LIST SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE 

   

 It is further alleged that the murder of Donna Lee Eckard was murder 

 in the first degree and was committed by the defendant, Randall Brent 

 Woodfield, and in addition to such murder, said defendant is now 

 being charged with having murdered and has murdered Janell Charlotte 

 Jarvis, on or about the same day, said murder being murder in the 

 first or second degree, within the meaning of Penal Code 190.2(a) 

 (3).216 

   

 SECOND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE 

   

 It is further alleged that the murder of Donna Lee Eckard was 

 committed by Randall Brent Woodfield while the defendant was engaged 

 in the commission of the immediate flight after having committed 

 and attempted to commit the crime of burglary in the first or second 

 degree, in violation of Penal Code Section 460, within the meaning of 

 Penal Code Section 190.2(a) (17).&quot; 

   

 The document continued, repetitive and concise, dry as only legal 

 documents can be, the horror and pain and ultimate tragedy of the 

 victims buried somewhere within the tedious terminology. 

   

 COUNT II 

   

 Violation of Section 187 of the California Penal Code, a felony.   The 

 said defendant...on or about February 3, 1981 

 did willfully, unlawfully, and with malice aforethought murder Janell 

 Charlotte Jarvis, a human being. 

   

 It is further alleged that...the said defendant personally used a 

 firearm...a handgun. 

   

 COUNT III: 

   

 The said defendant, Randall Brent Woodfield, on or about February 3, 

 1981, did willfully and unlawfully, then being a person over the age 

 of twenty-one, participate in an act of sodomy with Janell Charlotte 

 Jarvis, a person under the age of sixteen years.&quot; 

   

 There were ten counts listed in the document naming Randy 

 Woodfield: two counts of murder, one count of sodomy, two counts of 

 robbery, three counts of burglary, one count of oral copulation, and 

 one count of rape.   All of the Shasta county victims, it was hoped, 

 would one day have their turn in court.   Two of them were dead, and 

 physical evidence would have to speak for Donna Eckard and her 

 daughter, Janell. 

   

 California wanted Randy Woodfield, and wanted him badly But even 

 though the arrest warrant was dated August 27, 1981, California would 

 have to wait a long, long time to confront Randy.   Oregon Courts were 

 far from finished with him.   The delay must have given Woodfield some 

 comfort.   There 

 was, at the time of his crimes, no death penalty in Oregon.   (The 

 death penalty has been reinstated in the intervening years, but it is 

 not retroactive.) In California, Woodfield would be walking into the 

 long black shadow of the gas chamber. 

   

 Hard on the heels of the ten charges and the arrest warrant out of 

 California, Shasta County District Attorney Steve Carlton announced 

 that he would seek the death penalty if and when Woodfield was tried 

 in his jurisdiction.   California homicide trials are bifurcated. 

 That is, the jury first decides if the defendant is innocent or 

 guilty.   If the defendant is found guilty of first-degree murder, the 

 same jury is retained to dictate what the penalty will be. 

 California law permits the death penalty in special circumstances. 

 Among those special circumstances are multiple homicides and 

 homicides committed during the commission of another felony crime. 

 The Mountain Gate murders were committed during the course of a 

 burglary--the theft of Steve Eckard&apos;s revolver. 

   

 With the specter of a cyanide &quot;egg&quot; dropping into a vat of 

 sulfuric acid waiting for him down the line, Randy Woodfield&apos;s 

   

 trial in Benton County, Oregon may have seemed a far lesser threat. 

 In September, 1981, the news about Woodfield dealt almost exclusively 

 with the Benton County trial.   A change of venue had been denied. 

 Former District Attorney--and now Judge Frank 

 Knight reasoned that extensive pree-trial publicity could be 

 expected almost anywhere in Oregon as much as in Corvallis.   Knight 

 stressed that the key to a fair trial depended more on careful jury 

 selection. 

   

 As trials often are, this trial was delayed.   Instead of beginning in 

 September, the new date was set for November 2.   The charges in 

 Corvallis were sodomy, kidnapping, and being an ex-convict in 

 possession of a firearm in the attack on the young waitress in the 

 restaurant. 

   

 The second set of charges included sodomy, robbery, and sexual abuse 

 in the attack on the eight- and ten-year-old Green sisters in 

 Corvallis on January 14.   And the third set of charges stemmed from 

 the February 9 incident in the Corvallis fabric shop robbery and 

 sexual abuse. 

   

 But there were more--the charges in Linn County, resulting from the 

 attacks on February 9, in the Albany laundromat: attempted 

 kidnapping, sodomy, and an ex-convict in possession of a firearm. 

   

 Jackson County, Oregon, and Washington State authorities would have 

 to stand at the end of a long line to prosecute Woodfield. 

   

 The word &quot;overkill&quot; comes to mind when one considers the charges 

 piled on charges against him, but then, the same word is chillingly 

 apt when contemplating the crimes which resulted in those charges. 

 Rarely in the Northwest, if ever, has there been a suspect whose 

 alleged crimes occurred on an almost-daily basis. 

   

 * * * On Monday, October 12, 1981, Marion County Circuit Judge Clarke 

 Brown pronounced sentence on Randy Woodfield in his conviction in the 

 shootings of Beth Wilmot and Shari Hull.   Beth Wilmot sat quietly in 

 the back of the courtroom as Brown asked her attacker if he had any 

 remarks to make before sentence was pronounced. 

   

 He did.   Randy Woodfield&apos;s incongruously high, soft voice sounded 

 sincere.   &quot;I stand before you in complete innocence.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Thank you, Mr. Woodfield,&quot; Judge Brown responded, polite always, but 

 he was hardly moved.   He stared down at the 

 prisoner in front of him, his face grim. 

   

 &quot;Now, Mr. Woodfield, you have been found guilty by a jury of your 

 peers of murder, attempted murder, sodomy in the first degree, and 

 sodomy in the second degree.   I sat there and listened to all of the 

 evidence, although I was not the trier of the fact or of the 

 credibility to be given the evidence, or to the witnesses who took 

 the stand.   I will assure you that I agreed wholeheartedly with that 

 verdict, with the verdicts that were handed down by the jury.   I have 

 found that you do have a severe personality disorder which indicates 

 a propensity to criminal activity and this, of course, gives the 

 power to the Court to enhance the sentences from twenty years maximum 

 to thirty years. 

   

 &quot;Basically speaking, there are four factors which this Court takes 

 into consideration when it sentences a person.   One of them is 

 separation.   Are you a danger to the community?   Two is the 

 deterrence.   Will it deter you or will it deter anyone else in the 

 future?   Three is retribution, the old eye for an eye, tooth for a 

 tooth idea.   And number four is rehabilitation.   Each case is 

 different just the same as each individual person is a different 

 person, and, as a result, the Court must put certain weights 

 differently in each case on each of the four factors which are 

 involved. 

   

 &quot;Now, as to rehabilitation, although the law says that this was 

 murder, the method in which this was accomplished was nothing more 

 than execution.   It reminded me of nothing more than the &apos;Godfather&apos; 

 coming to life.   The execution of Miss Hull and the attempted 

 execution of Miss Wilmot was, in my mind, the most cold-blooded type 

 of execution which this Court has ever heard.   The two acts of sodomy 

 were vicious.   Frankly, I do not think that rehabilitation is very 

 much in the picture within this sentencing. 

   

 &quot;Now, as to separation, Mr. Woodfield, I very definitely feel that 

 you are a danger to the community and that the community has the 

 right to be separated from you... And then we come into the 

 third...deterrence.   The sentence which I am going to impose, I think 

 will deter you from any further ever (sic) committing any crime, and 

 I sincerely hope that the sentence which I give to you will make 

 other people think twice before they commit such a crime. 

   

 &quot;As to Case Number 125,510, which is murder, it is the order of the 

 Court that you be placed in the legal and physical custody of the 

 Oregon Corrections Division for the period of the remainder of your 

 life.   As to Case Number 125,511, attempted murder, it is the order 

 of the Court that you be placed in the legal and physical custody of 

 the Oregon Corrections Division for an indeterminate period of 

 time--not to exceed thirty years--which shall run consecutively with 

 any other sentence imposed today.   As to Case Number 125,512, it is 

 the order of the Court that you be placed in the legal and physical 

 custody of the Oregon Corrections Division for in indeterminate 

 period of time not to exceed thirty years, which shall run 

 consecutively to any other sentence imposed today. 

 As to Case Number 125,513, it is the order of Court that you be 

 placed in the legal and physical custody of the Oregon Corrections 

 Division for an indeterminate period of time not to exceed thirty 

 years, which shall run consecutively to any other sentence imposed 

 today.&quot; 

   

 Judge Brown&apos;s eyes bored into Woodfield.   &quot;I have made the sentences 

 consecutive because the Court has found that you are a menace to 

 society.   And the Court has the duty to protect the public by the use 

 of consecutive sentences in order to protect the public from further 

 criminal conduct by you.   This Court is making the strongest possible 

 recommendation to the Oregon State Board of Parole and Probation that 

 you serve a minimum of fifty years before you are to be considered 

 eligible for release. 

   

 &quot;If the death penalty in Oregon had not been declared 

 unconstitutional, I would have no hesitancy whatsoever to say, Mr. 

 Woodfield, you are going to die .   .   .&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield fit within the parameters of the Oregon legal 

 definition of a &quot;dangerous offender.&quot;   As such, the maximum sentences 

 for each of the crimes he had been convicted of could be increased. 

 And, indeed, Judge Clarke Brown gave Woodfield the maximum sentence. 

   

 Life in prison Plus ninety years.   &quot;If you are released earlier, It 

 will not be because the Court has failed in its duty.&quot; 

   

   

 24 

   

 The Benton County trial in Corvallis might seem superfluous.   Why 

 bring a man into trial when he has already been sentenced 

 to life plus ninety years?   There are many reasons.   Chief among them 

 was the chance that the Wilmot-Hull verdict might be reversed on 

 appeal, an appeal whose wheels were already in motion.   Not 

 likely--but within the realm of possibility.   Next, there was the 

 victim&apos;s right to confront her attacker, a right that is just as 

 important--if not more important than~the defendant&apos;s ~ right to 

 confront his accuser.   Further, more and more judges, prosecutors, 

 and detectives have become angry and frustrated at the number of 

 criminals who count two, or three, or dozens of 

 crimes for the &quot;price of one.&quot; 

   

 Since one of the Benton County victims was the daughter of a law 

 enforcement officer, it was not surprising that she wanted her day in 

 court.   Jill Martin had been terrorized in the restaurant 

 on February 25 in Corvallis; she had heard all her life that unless 

 victims are brave enough to testify, criminals go free.   She was not 

 about to let that happen. 

   

 Jury selection began on Monday, November 2, 1981.   This time, the 

 selection went rapidly and by day&apos;s end eight women and four men had 

 been seated in the jury box. 

   

 Woodfield had a new defense attorney.   Jim Hilborn of Corvallis had 

 been court-appointed to defend him.   He also had a new alibi. 

   

 Arden Bates, his former landlady--but mistakenly identified by the 

 press as &quot;Woodfield&apos;s girlfriend,&quot; had changed her story and was now 

 prepared to swear that Randy had been home with her and her son in 

 Springfield on the night of February 25.   Perhaps Arden was suffering 

 pangs of guilt; she had been the one who turned over her phone 

 records to Captain Dave Bishop.   Those phone records played a major 

 role in tracing Randy&apos;s violent peregrinations along the I-5 

 freeway--and in convicting him in his first trial. 

   

 Arden, reversing herself, had flung herself into Randy&apos;s arms in the 

 Salem courtroom, telling him how sorry she was.   Randy&apos;s ultimate 

 &quot;forgiving nature,&quot; and barrage of letters had apparently softened 

 Arden&apos;s heart. 

   

 Kenneth Osher, for the prosecution, would present his own 

 witnesses--three of Randy&apos;s alleged victims.   After a verbal tussle 

 in court, Judge Knight granted Osher&apos;s motion to allow courtroom 

 identification by the three victims.   Jill Martin, and the two women 

 who had been assaulted in the Corvallis fabric shop on February 9. 

 Hilborn maintained for the defense, just as Charlie Burt had, that 

 the victims&apos; memory had been tainted by viewing a mug laydown and 

 then the in-person line-up in Springfield in March. 

   

 Jill Martin took the stand on Wednesday, November 4.   Chief Deputy 

 D.A.   Osher led her gently through the events of the night of 

 February 25. 

   

 &quot;Can you tell us what happened that night, Jill?&quot; 

   

 &quot;I left the kitchen of the restaurant about eight-thirty to use the 

 restroom.   I was just washing my hands and getting ready to go back 

 to work when this man with a small silver gun forced his way in and 

 told me that I couldn&apos;t leave.&quot; 

   

 &quot;What did he say?&quot; 

   

 &quot;&apos;Do what I say and I won&apos;t hurt you.&apos; He told me to sit on the toilet 

 seat, and I said I wouldn&apos;t.&quot; 

   

 &quot;And then what happened?&quot; 

   

 &quot;He cocked the hammer of the pistol, and I saw the cylinder move.&quot; 

   

 And then Jill had to tell the gallery and the jury the explicit 

 details of the perverted sexual attack.   In a steady voice, she said 

 that the intruder had forced her to strip to the waist and perform 

 oral sodomy on him while he fondled her.   After he had ejaculated, he 

 had bound her hand and foot with tape, and left her lying on the 

 floor of the restroom. 

   

 &quot;What did the man look like?&quot;   Osher asked. 

   

 &quot;He wore a dark stocking cap on his head, and he had a full beard 

 that looked fake.   He had a white bandage over his nose.   He was 

 about five-feet-eight to five-feet-nine inches tall.&quot; 

   

 Jill had misjudged her attacker&apos;s height, and it was an error that 

 Hilborn would attempt to blow up to major proportions. 

   

 &quot;So you can be fairly certain that the man was five-eight or 

 five-nine?&quot;   Hilborn asked Jill on cross-examination.   

   

 &quot;Yes.&quot; 

   

 Randy Woodfield is, of course, six feet, two inches tall.   But any 

 expert on witness identification will agree that crime victims and 

 witnesses are wrong about height more often than any other physical 

 characteristic. 

   

 The jury wouldn&apos;t know that. 

   

 But the jury had watched, fascinated, as Jill selected Randy 

 Woodfield out of all the males in the crowded courtroom, and said he 

 was the man who had assaulted her sexually. 

   

 Tony Niri, Randy&apos;s ex-con, ex-friend, told the Benton County jury 

 that he had watched Randy as he tried out disguises shortly before 

 Thanksgiving, 1980. 

   

 &quot;He put a piece of white tape across his face, and then he put on a 

 fake brown beard and a navy blue stocking cap.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Where did that take place?&quot;   Osher asked. 

   

 &quot;In my apartment in Portland.   We were talking about pulling a job, 

 and discussing what kind of disguises we might use.&quot; 

   

 Detective Neal Loper from the Beaverton Police Department testified 

 to the search of Randy&apos;s room in Arden Bates&apos;s Springfield home.   He 

 had seized for evidence--with Randy&apos;s permission--a box of athletic 

 adhesive tape and a small gun-cleaning kit. 

   

 Criminalist Michael Howard from the Oregon State Police Crime 

 Detection lab in Portland explained to the jury how something as 

 seemingly prosaic and mass-produced as white adhesive tape can be 

 reduced to its essential components--thereby 

 making it unique.   Howard had tested both the tape from Woodfield&apos;s 

 bedroom and the tape used to bind Jill Martin&apos;s ankles and wrists. 

   

 &quot;The elemental composition of the tape was the same,&quot; Howard 

 explained.   &quot;That led me to believe that it was produced by the same 

 manufacturer...and was probably from the same batch.&quot; 

   

 Perhaps the most intriguing testimony from forensic science experts 

 came from Jim Pex of the Oregon State Police Crime Lab.   Pex is one 

 of America&apos;s definitive experts on blood components both in humans 

 and in animals.   He lectures frequently and testifies often as an 

 expert witness.   Pex explained to the jury that Randy Woodfield was a 

 &quot;secretor,&quot; one of the majority of the human species whose blood type 

 can be determined by analyzing body fluids--blood itself, saliva, 

 semen.   A semen stain found on Jill Martin&apos;s clothing proved to have 

 come from a type-B secretor.   This is a relatively rare blood type 

 which occurs in only nine percent of the population of the world. 

   

 And then Jim Pex moved into enzyme characteristics of blood, 

 particularly Randy Woodfield&apos;s.   &quot;His enzyme genotype was 

 one-two-plus--which narrows it down even further.   That genotype is 

 found in only 3.7 percent of the population.   When you combine the 

 three characteristics of that semen stain-that is, from a secretor, 

 for someone with type B blood, and from someone with one-two-plus 

 genotype, you are talking about only .27 percent of the population in 

 the world!   Randy Woodfield had all three characteristics in his body 

 fluid. 

   

 Would the jury even be able to understand the highly technical 

 serology testimony Jim Pex had given, all those unfamiliar terms 

 about what makes up a man&apos;s blood?   Had they believed Jill Martin? 

   

 Apparently they had. 

   

 After only three hours&apos; deliberation, the jury found Randy Woodfield 

 guilty of sodomy and of being an ex-convict in possession of a weapon. 

   

 They had not believed Arden Bates.   And they most assuredly had not 

 believed Randy himself--not even when Jim Hilborn had asked him 

 straight out if he had committed the crimes against Jill Martin, and 

 Randy had answered earnestly, &quot;No, I sure didn&apos;t.&quot; 

   

 On December 18, 1981, Randy Woodfield&apos;s Christmas season was blighted 

 considerably when he was sentenced to thirty years on the sodomy 

 charge and five years on the ex-convict in possession of a weapon. 

 Judge Knight stipulated that this additional 

 thirty-five-year-sentence was to run consecutively to the sentences 

 handed down in the Shari Hull-Beth Wilmot attack. 

   

 Randy now faced life plus one hundred and sixty-five years in prison. 

   

 Merrisue and Megan Green were spared the ordeal of a trial, the 

 fabric store victims&apos; case was put on hold, as were the Linn County 

 case, all the other Oregon cases, the Washington State cases, and the 

 California murders of Donna Eckard and Janell Jarvis. 

   

 Randy Woodfield was transported once more to the Oregon State 

 Penitentiary in Salem, where he would start doing his time as he 

 awaited new trials through the appeal process.   He had left that 

 prison slightly more than two years earlier with promises about the 

 Christian life he planned to lead, with dozens of people prepared to 

 support him emotionally--and financially.   Now the man deemed not to 

 be a &quot;violence risk,&quot; was back in the &quot;joint&quot; for the rest of his 

 life. 

   

   

 UPDATE: 1988 

   

 Randy Woodfield was indigent, all of his attorneys were supplied by 

 the taxpayers of Oregon.   He was represented in his appeal by Gary D. 

 Babcock, a public defender.   Babcock cited thirty cases as precedents 

 as he asked the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon to reverse 

 Randy Brent Woodfield&apos;s convictions for Murder, Attempted Murder, and 

 Sodomy in the First Degree (two counts) in the death of Shari Hull 

 and the near-death of Beth Wilmot. 

   

 Notice of Appeal had been filed November 13, 1981.   How bizarre, 

 really.   Even as Randy Woodfield was being tried for sodomy in Benton 

 County, his appeal had been filed in Salem. 

   

 Babcock&apos;s arguments were familiar; he hit at Beth Wilmot&apos;s 

 identification of Randy Woodfield, suggesting her memory was flawed, 

 that eyewitness testimony is fallible.   He questioned the State&apos;s 

 expert witnesses in ballistics and hair and fiber identification, and 

 he argued that Judge Clarke Brown had not had the authority to invoke 

 the dangerous offender statute when imposing Woodfield&apos;s minimum 

 sentence: fifty years. 

   

 And, once again, an attempt was made to blame the shootings in the 

 TransAmerica Building on Lawrence Moore, the loose cannon who had 

 opened fire on patrons in the Oregon Museum Tavern.   Moore&apos;s alleged 

 crimes had a completely different M.O., and his resemblance to 

 Woodfield was faint.   Woodfield was dark and Moore was blonde.   They 

 were both young Caucasian males, and that was about all, but Randy 

 Woodfield still clung tenaciously to his story that he was being 

 persecuted for the crimes of another man.   Appeals Attorney Babcock 

 contended that Moore should have been brought into the courtroom for 

 the jury to observe. 

   

 Babcock also took issue with Judge Brown&apos;s instructions to the jury 

 that it was to presume that all witnesses speak the truth.   Since the 

 State had backed up its case with thirty-seven witnesses, and Randy 

 Woodfield had had only twelve (including himself), Babcock felt the 

 State had an unfair advantage, based on sheer numbers. 

   

 Perhaps.   But the fact that Randy Woodfield had not had thirty-seven 

 witnesses who could back him up in his protestations of innocence 

 negated the argument. 

   

 Dave Frohumayer, Oregon State Attorney General, William F.   Gary, 

 Oregon Solicitor General, and Stephen F.   Feifer, Assistant Oregon 

 Attorney General, responded to Babcock&apos;s arguments to overturn 

 Randy&apos;s convictions.   Speaking for the prosecution, they cited 

 forty-eight cases for cedents to support their arguments. 

   

 The Attorney General&apos;s office deemed Lawrence Moore&quot; irrelevant to 

 the case because defendant failed to demonstrate, beyond mere 

 speculation and conjecture, that Moore was an alternate suspect Other 

 than by inflaming the jury, Moore&apos;s presence in the courtroom could 

 not have exculpated the defendant.&quot; 

   

 It was a moot point anyway.   Lawrence Moore&apos;s attorney had invoked 

 his client&apos;s Fifth Amendment rights.   Even if Brown had acceded to 

 Woodfield&apos;s request that his designated suspect appear in the 

 courtroom, Moore would not have come.   Why on earth would he?   He was 

 Woodfield&apos;s red herring, a smoke screen, a &quot;bushy-haired stranger&quot; 

 beloved of defense teams, and Moore&apos;s attorney was not about to bring 

 him into Woodfield&apos;s trial to shoulder the blame.   Moreover, the 

 State argued that Judge Brown was perfectly proper in his 

 instructions to the jury that witnesses are presumed to speak the 

 truth.   &quot;The instruction is well established in statutory and case 

 law.&quot; 

   

 As to the five-decade length of Randy&apos;s minimum sentence, The State 

 was succinct in their response, &quot;the trial Court properly ordered 

 that defendant serve a minimum term totaling fifty years&apos; 

 imprisonment on the four counts.   The law expressly permits a minimum 

 sentence of up to fifty years on each count when the defendant is 

 found to be a dangerous offender.&quot; 

   

 The Oregon Court of Appeals sided with attorneys for the State; Randy 

 Woodfield&apos;s appeal was denied. 

   

 Life in prison, despite the term, does not mean life in prison.   It 

 means whatever the minimum for life is set by statute in a particular 

 state.   In Oregon, life usually means somewhere between ten and 

 twelve years.   But the fifty-year minimum set by Judge Brown 

 translates to a first parole hearing for Randy Woodfield in the year 

 2031, the year that will mark his 81st birthday...if he lives that 

 long. 

   

 Back in 1981, as her hopes for a future with him faded in a barrage 

 of arrests, Randy wrote to Shelly Janson, swearing his devotion.   To 

 underscore that, he signed his beloved gold Champagne Edition 

 Volkswagen beetle--slightly crunched--over to his fiancee.   Shelly 

 wrote back for awhile, and then she faded out of his life.   Randall 

 was not the man she had thought he was; he was a stranger--always had 

 been, really.   There could never be a marriage, or babies, or any of 

 the things he had promised her.   It had all turned to ashes. 

   

 Although the term is a misnomer in the accepted sense, there is a 

 kind of &quot;life in prison&quot; that few outsiders know about--one that most 

 laymen never even think or wonder about, a vast society of human 

 beings captive inside walls.   It is a society with its own language, 

 mores, relationships, hierarchy.   The majority 

 of inmates are short-timers, men (and women) guilty of crimes against 

 property who would no more think of doing physical harm to others 

 than the average man on the street would.   Those convicts who have hurt 

 people, particularly those prisoners who have sexually attacked women 

 and children, are relegated to the lowest social strata of prison 

 society. 

   

 The thought of being locked up is horrific to free men, but seasoned 

 cons explain, &quot;You only do one year of hard time; after that, you 

 adjust.&quot;   It is somewhat harder for a sexual sadist to adjust inside 

 the walls than for other prisoners. 

   

 A large part of adjusting to prison life involves fitting into one 

 social group or another.   Randy Woodfield has more time to do than 

 almost any other prisoner in the Oregon State Penitentiary.   He is a 

 convicted woman killer, a child rapist.   The only way Randy can hope 

 to survive in prison is to excel in one of two areas: brains or 

 brawn.   He has consistently tested only average in intelligence--but 

 Woodfield remains tremendously strong.   He lifts weights, works out, 

 concentrates on keeping the muscle tone that validates his 

 masculinity. 

   

 As long as Randy can hold on to his strength, he will maintain his 

 tenuous balance on the middle to.   lower-middle rungs of the prison&apos;s 

 social ladder.   He insists he has &quot;earned the respect&quot; of his fellow 

 inmates, but that is doubtful.   His crimes are an athema to prisoners 

 who might consider robbing a liquor store, but who detest a man who 

 rapes and sodomizes women.   Randy&apos;s strength is his armor, and each 

 passing year erodes it. 

   

 As this is written, Randy Woodfield has served seven years of his 

 sentence.   In July, 1983, The Oregon Supreme Court refused to review 

 his final appeal.   He will be thirty-eight years old on December 28, 

 1988, but, like Dorian Gray, he has scarcely aged externally.   He 

 keeps his &quot;house&quot; (cell) neat and perfect, and complains bitterly 

 when he is sent to &quot;the hole&quot; for occasional infractions. 

   

 &quot;I hate to fight and get &apos;D.R.&apos;s cause they move all your stuff to 

 the property room in bags, like a pile of junk.   Things get lost 

 bent, broken and all dirty.   They don&apos;t just lock up our cells and 

 save it for us...We have cells and Isolation Building &apos;Black Box&apos; 

 for incorrables (sic).   Crazy huh?&quot;   Randy wrote to a correspondent. 

 &quot;Sick place prisons are!!!   Sick people run them too.   And sick 

 people live their lives saying other people are sick or weird. 

 Everyone is equal-everyone has problems and will stand before God for 

 Judging others...&quot; 

   

 This is a common and continual theme for Randy Woodfield that he is 

 &quot;equal.&quot;   That all people are alike, and that he is no worse than 

 anyone else, and thus should not be maligned. 

   

 For press interviews or on visitor&apos;s day, he strides into the room 

 perfectly groomed, his jeans fashionably faded, ironed with 

 knife-like creases.   He wears his shirt open to show his muscular 

 chest, and he is as tanned as the Oregon weather allows.   Randy is a 

 man totally obsessed with his physical perfection; Time seems to have 

 suspended him in preservative gel; he has no responsibilities, no 

 concerns about earning a living, or about where his next meal is 

 coming from.   He still looks like the man who was chosen to pose in 

 the buff for a beefcake center- fold.   He still talks and writes as 

 if he were in high school. 

   

 There are more female guards in the Oregon State Penitentiary than 

 there were during Woodfield&apos;s first incarceration there, and he 

 continues to vent his rage that women are allowed in areas with male 

 prisoners.   And yet, he preens for his female captors, bragging that 

 they sneak up on him to catch a glimpse of his nakedness.   One guard 

 laughs as she describes Woodfield&apos;s continuing exhibitionism.   &quot;I can 

 walk past Randy&apos;s cell and he&apos;s fully clothed.   Five minutes later, 

 when I come back down the line, Randy&apos;s stripped and he&apos;s flexing his 

 muscles--waiting for me.&quot; 

   

 Woodfield&apos;s need to expose himself seems as entrenched as it ever 

 was, even if it is directed, of necessity, at female guards who are 

 not even faintly impressed. 

   

 A quarter of his life has been spent in prison, and it would appear 

 he has fashioned a world there--although he still writes and talks of 

 appeals.   Prison has given Randy Woodfield everything he needs, save 

 the immediate proximity of young females. 

   

 He has worked his way around that.   In a sense, Woodfield still uses 

 women for both his sexual outlet and financial support.   He has 

 always been a prodigious letter-writer, and prison life has only 

 increased this activity. 

   

 Randy Woodfield carries on a life through the mail.   Women&apos;s names 

 and addresses are gold to him.   He writes to single women, married 

 women, widows, divorcees, teenagers, gleaning his correspondents from 

 other convicts, from the pen pal columns in tabloids, or in Christian 

 magazines.   He writes to women in the Oregon Women&apos;s Correctional 

 Center, the facility next door to the prison where he is locked up, 

 his correspondence part of the huge intra-facility mail--requiring no 

 postage or paper link between men and women.   He writes to women held 

 in other jails and prisons across America. 

   

 Some of his correspondents are aware that they are writing to a 

 convict, but some are deluded, believing they are writing to &quot;Randy 

 Woodfield, student at the University of Oregon, 2605 State Street in 

 Salem, Oregon.&quot;   A handful of women who have journeyed to Salem to 

 surprise their &quot;fiancee&quot; have found to their utter dismay that 2605 

 State Street is not the University of Oregon&apos;s address; the walls of 

 the state prison loom there. 

   

 Randy Woodfield&apos;s letters move from friendship to intimacy to frank 

 pornography very rapidly.   Promises are made, proposals of marriage 

 flow from his pen as easily as comments on the weather.   He 

 invariably encloses pictures of himself, and always includes the 

 photograph he prizes most-Randy Woodfield in tiny blue bathing 

 trunks, flexing his muscles, his tanned skin gleaming with oil.   That 

 man has a neatly clipped black beard, a trim moustache.   That picture 

 is almost ten years old; detectives found it displayed in his room in 

 Arden Bates&apos;s house. 

   

 A picture--not of a woman--but of Randy himself placed where he could 

 gaze at it from his bed.   Now he uses it to lure pen-pals. 

   

 He has written to dozens, scores, hundreds of women, juggling his 

 replies, explaining, soothing, cajoling and seducing.   Many of them 

 send him money, sometimes only a dollar or two.   Sometimes thousands 

 of dollars.   The wife of a courthouse employee in a parish (county) 

 in a southeastern state was so besotted in the early 1980&apos;s by the 

 impact of Randy Woodfield&apos;s letters that she gladly sent him many 

 thousand dollars.   She also is alleged to have acquiesced to his 

 request that she take a nude photo of her nine-year-old daughter and 

 send it to him. 

   

 Charges are pending against Randy Woodfield in that case. 

   

 A young woman about to be paroled from the Washington State Women&apos;s 

 Facility at Purdy began to write to Randy, on a friend&apos;s 

 recommendation, in 1983.   As soon as she was released that fall, she 

 traveled to Salem where she met Randy in person.   She was entranced. 

 Indeed, she was in love.   She was even Halfway convinced that 

 Woodfield was the natural father of a child she had adopted in 

 Portland a few years before she was arrested in Washington.   She 

 wanted to believe that, to think that her family was complete and 

 miraculously reunited. 

   

 The recent parolee had found a mission during those last months of 

 1983; she vowed to win freedom for Randy.   She believed devoutly he 

 was innocent of all charges. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ve just come back from visiting him for the first time,&quot; she said 

 breathlessly in a phone call to the author.   &quot;And I know he&apos;s 

 innocent.   He&apos;s wonderful.   Yes, I know he writes to other women, but 

 I&apos;m the only woman he really loves.   I&apos;m the one he wants to marry. 

 He&apos;s going to introduce me to his family.   I know the truth when I 

 hear it.&quot; 

   

 She was a nice woman, inexorably drawn to destructive men.   

   

 A few years later, it was a young married woman who began visiting 

 Randy regularly in prison, and who called the author to announce that 

 she was researching a book--she would write a book that would tell the 

 truth.   She visited Randy dozens of times, and she believed in him. 

 &quot;Anyone would believe him.   He&apos;s innocent.   He&apos;s the most sincere man 

 I&apos;ve ever met.&quot; 

   

 Some of Woodfield&apos;s &quot;mail conquests&quot; were pitiful.   The mother of a 

 dying child in Florida grew to count on Randy, to believe that he 

 would be allowed out of prison to visit the little boy and to help 

 her through the tragedy that lay ahead.   He encouraged her to believe 

 that there was a good chance Oregon authorities would grant him a 

 &quot;hardship furlough&quot; so that he could rush to her side.   Indeed, 

 Woodfield may have actually thought he could parlay the child&apos;s fatal 

 illness and emotional dependence on him into some time out from 

 prison. 

   

 There is bleak irony in how well Randy Woodfield understands women. 

 For a male who has demonstrated over and over an almost visceral 

 hatred for the opposite sex, he knows just which buttons to push, 

 when to be forceful, when to offer tenderness.   Nowhere is Randy&apos;s 

 manipulation of women more evident than in the voluminous 

 correspondence that began in the spring of 1984 between Randy and a 

 female prisoner on trial for murder in Eugene, Oregon. 

   

 In a sense, their &quot;affair&quot; was a true &quot;Battle of the Titans.&quot; 

   

 Each of them has had countless lovers; each is adept at manipulation 

 and &quot;games.&quot; 

   

 Diane Downs had made headlines in the Northwest since she and her 

 children were shot on a lonely country road outside Springfield, 

 Oregon, in May, 1983.   Cheryl Downs, seven, died, and Christie, 

 eight, and Danny, three, had been left paralyzed.   Diane, who had 

 been wounded only in her lower left arm, was arrested on February 28, 

 1984, and charged with the shootings.   The media said that Diane 

 Downs had shot her own children--so that she might win back a married 

 lover who &quot;didn&apos;t want to be a daddy.&quot;   That charge had yet to be 

 proved, but Diane Downs&apos;s history indicated that she was a woman who 

 predicated her whole existence upon being &quot;in love,&quot; and on her 

 sexual appeal to men. 

   

 Diane&apos;s image appeared almost daily in Oregon papers and on 

 television, and Randy Woodfield was impressed by both her beauty and 

 her notoriety, the latter perhaps more of an aphrodisiac to him.   He 

 craved publicity as much as he craved sex.   The combination of Randy 

 Woodfield and Diane Downs seemed, to him, to be a dynamite duo.   No 

 telling where they could go together. 

   

 But first, Randy had to &quot;meet&quot; Diane. 

   

 In late spring of 1984, Diane was being held in the Lane County Jail, 

 the same jail where Randy himself had been booked when he was 

 arrested three years earlier. 

   

 He wrote to Diane, who, at twenty-eight, was seven months into her 

 sixth pregnancy, and about to go on trial for murder.   He felt it 

 prudent, for the moment, to keep his true identity secret until she 

 got to know him.   He didn&apos;t want her to leap to hasty conclusions 

 about his background.   He used the name of another prisoner in the 

 Oregon State Penitentiary, and signed his letters &quot;Squirrely,&quot; or 

 &quot;Michael,&quot; or &quot;Just me.&quot; 

   

 Mail from prison is almost always rife with unusual punctuation.   A 

 smiling or frowning cartoon-circle face at the end of a sentence is 

 the most universal touch.   Lower case &quot;i&apos;s&quot; dotted with a circle, fat 

 exclamation points, &quot;Ha-Ha&apos;s&quot; XXXXs and 0000&apos;s for kisses and hugs. 

 Randy used all these and more in his letters.   He favored a line 

 drawing of a funny little man with pop eyes and his tongue sticking 

 out of his mouth, the 

 insouciant image appearing here and there to augment his words. 

 Randy&apos;s style was staccato, spinning the reader and keeping her off 

 balance.   Randy peppered his letters with phrases and questions: &quot;You 

 smiling?&quot; 

   

   &quot;How about it?&quot;    &quot;You with me, Di?&quot;    and &quot;Yowza!&quot; 

   

   

 * Note: For complete coverage of the Diane Downs case, see Small 

 Sacrifices by Ann Rule, Signet, July.   1988. 

   

 Even in letters, he demanded constant and immediate acceptance.   And 

 he had, perhaps unwittingly, chosen a woman whose whole life revolved 

 around having a man.   Diane was definitely looking--and the women&apos;s 

 section of jail offers little choice.   She was without a lover when 

 Randy Woodfield came into her life. 

   

 Because Diane Downs was an escape risk, letters coming in to her were 

 copied.   Later, when &quot;Squirrely&quot; could not resist sending her the 

 familiar blue-bikini picture of himself, jail censors recognized 

 Woodfield as one of their former tenants.   He too was considered an 

 escape risk, and his letters were copied.   Their fevered 

 correspondence grew into thick stacks of letters. 

   

 Initially, when Diane knew her secret admirer only as &quot;Squirrely,&quot; he 

 bombarded her with supportive missives.   He was fascinated with the 

 gynecological details of her condition, and asked for an in-depth 

 description of her pregnancy, what her pelvic exams were like, and 

 how a baby was delivered.   They made bets--these two total 

 strangers--about when the infant would be born, and whether it would 

 be a boy or a girl.   if a boy, &quot;Squirrely&quot; suggested that Diane name 

 the child, &quot;Ian Randall.&quot; 

   

 When Diane Downs was informed of the true identity of her steamy 

 correspondent, she questioned him about his murder and rape 

 convictions.   He evinced shock and hurt feelings at her lack of 

 faith, and they were estranged for days.   But they soon made up. 

   

 Randy&apos;s letters were gallant; Diane apologized for doubting him, and 

 he apologized for being so angry.   &quot;...It&apos;s a crazy world 

 here, and I try and do my own time.   Well a little bit of yours too. 

 (Ha) I may get into a fight (over her innocence) yet dear friend. 

 But don&apos;t you worry about it none.   I will be stubborn and stand up 

 for what I believe in.&quot; 

   

 Diane Downs&apos;s future was up in the air, her trial lasting week after 

 week.   The letters coming down to Eugene from the Salem prison were 

 encouraging.   &quot;Squirrely&quot; and later Randy offered a strong shoulder 

 to cry on. 

   

 &quot;I want ya to live and work in Salem or Portland (if acquitted),&quot; 

 Randy wrote.   &quot;And get to know my family too.   Me better for sure! 

 Deal?   And if you go to OCC-SHAM--then I will want your promise to 

 marry me and work with me on writing our own book about Justice in 

 America, and how we can handle it all together.   I know this is a 

 shock to ya, but why not marry me and be able to visit me too?   You 

 could always divorce me later--Ha).   Well? 

   

 &quot;Something to think on and dream about.   You will need a dear friend 

 next door to ya if you come here and I need you too.   I&apos;m sincere and 

 want you to think about this.   O.K.   Di?&quot; 

   

 She continued to write.   He told her about run-ins he had with &quot;dudes 

 about my sex-crimes.   I stood my ground to earn respect.   I&apos;m no 

 woman killer, and I am angry as hell and will fight for my honor to 

 exist.&quot; 

  

 Randy repeated to Diane Downs again and again that they were both 

 paying the price for crimes they hadn&apos;t done, and vowing his 

 sensitivity to her.   &quot;Smile now--I care.   You&apos;re just too sweet.&quot; 

   

 Beyond his emotional support, Randy&apos;s letters were stimulating.   He 

 was, apparently, in a constant state of priapism.   He referred to his 

 genitals continually, and went on for pages that sounded as if they&apos;d 

 come from reader write-ins to mens&apos; magazines. 

   

 &quot;I will be stroking &apos;Jr.&apos; to your photo at exactly midnight on 

 Saturday night (a.m.) Diane, so say &apos;Hi&apos; and tell me you enjoy our 

 time together.   Will you remember to touch your body for me and say 

 my name ...Just a game to play together &apos;cause I feel you close to me 

 and to climax my juices in memory of our togetherness like this.   You 

 brighten my life dear friend.   So thank you and join me Saturday 

 night if you want.   I will be there for you.   Totally in tho&apos;ts of 

 you...&quot; 

   

 Through May, June, July, 1984, they wrote to each other almost every 

 day.   Curious letters, full of earthy sexual steam and tears. 

 Diane wrote to a number of men in prison, and Randy, of course wrote 

 to scores of women.   Each promised absolute fidelity.   He sent her 

 pictures of himself and selected pages from magazines.   She sent him 

 pictures of herself and her paralyzed children and Bible tracts. 

   

 He wrote how he longed for children of his own.   She wrote back her 

 glowing thoughts on motherhood.   Randy described his &quot;eight-inch&quot; 

 penis, and Diane described her &quot;D-cup&quot; breasts.   It seemed a 

 longdistance coupling made somewhere other than heaven. 

   

 &quot;Your life is in the balance for sure!!&quot;   Randy commented.   &quot;That 

 damn jury better keep in mind &apos;Beyond a reasonable doubt&apos; too!   let 

 your attorney know and drive that home to their ears.   I&apos;m with you 

 no matter what dear friend.   So cry a happy tear for me too.   I do 

 too occasionally.   Even for this grown man!   (Ha.) Silly-huh?   I wish 

 you could kiss mine away.   Will you on our visits?   Not shy are ya? 

 I will want to hold ya tight to me and show you.   that you&apos;re special 

 people.   Okay by you?   A woman ought to be treated like a &apos;Queen&apos; in 

 my book--maybe I&apos;ll write about it--being accused falsely of rape and 

 murder (Sad face drawn).   Your comments, Di?&quot; 

   

 Randy wrote that he felt &quot;Mothers are beautiful creations like you, 

 Di (Smile?)&quot; 

   

 Diane had little to smile about.   She was convicted on June 17, 1984, 

 of murder, two counts of attempted murder in the first degree, and 

 two counts of first degree assault in the shootings of her three 

 children.   Ten days later, she gave birth--not to &quot;Ian Randall&quot; as 

 Randy had hoped, but to a baby girl: Amy Elizabeth.   The child was 

 immediately placed out for adoption. 

   

 She would not be visiting Randy; Diane would be in the women&apos;s prison 

 facility next door to the Oregon State Penitentiary with a sentence 

 almost as long as his. 

   

 Randy still had plans for them. 

   

 As he had once urged Shelly Janson to get in shape, he now tried to 

 inspire Diane Downs.   He wrote of his daily work-outs, and his 

 no-carbohydrate diet.   He was stepping up the number of repetitions 

 in his sets of weight lifting, preparing to pose for a &quot;contest&quot; 

 photo.   He did five-hundred sit-ups and five-hundred leg lifts each 

 day.   And there were the basketball games. 

   

 &quot;Have a lot of work to do yet but at 33 years old, I&apos;m doing okay. 

 Heck--I can still run and bang with the best of the niggers on the 

 basketball court now.   So I&apos;m doin&apos; okay...And you&apos;ll be doing okay 

 at 35 too!   I want ya to start getting active and in good shape.   We 

 both have a long haul to do.   So, let&apos;s get physical and make the 

 best of it.   Ya &apos;Game&apos; Di?&quot; 

   

 &quot;Our Warden is on vacation now, but when he returns I will discuss a 

 way for us to visit .   .   .&quot; 

   

 Randy explained a code that the two of them could use in future 

 letters.   It was not a code that would require a master cryptographer 

 to decipher.   Diane was to add an extra letter to each word in any 

 paragraph in her letters after the term &quot;Time to Close&quot; spelling out 

 her secret messages to him.   He would do the same. 

   

 It was a code that might well have accompanied an Ovaltine premium. 

   

 But Randy Woodfield was working on a far more subtle game.   Diane was 

 a most worthy adversary, and he had to be cautious as he set her up 

 for a tremendous fall.   His letters had been so full of love and 

 support that she apparently now trusted him completely.   Diane had no 

 way of knowing that Randy could never forgive her for doubting him. 

 She was a female, treacherous like all females.   He had come up with 

 a plan that would not only make 

 her look like a fool, but would probably bring him a great deal of 

 publicity, a book contract, and a movie deal. 

   

 He had proposed marriage to Diane continually, and he soon promised 

 her that marriage would allow them a private visit together.   Not 

 only did they have their wedding to plan for, he wrote, &quot;I&apos;m still 

 serious about a book you and I could write,&quot; Randy added.   &quot;But I 

 want to contact someone in Hollywood.&quot; 

   

 And still, both of them wrote &quot;NO GAMES!&quot;   while the games 

 accelerated on each side.   Diane was writing to any number of men in 

 prison, blissfully unaware that Randy was setting her up. 

   

 He wrote to an Oregonian reporter, to two Oregon women he had met 

 when they did research on a book about sex offenders, and to Anne 

 Bradley Jaeger, Anchor-person of KEZI-TV, the ABC affiliate in 

 Eugene.   Randy announced that he would soon be marrying a very, very, 

 famous woman prisoner who was being transferred to the Oregon Women&apos;s 

 Correctional Center from the Eugene area.   He wasn&apos;t free to give her 

 name, but Diane Downs was the only female prisoner in Eugene who was 

 very, very famous.   When reporters questioned her about a romance 

 with Randy Woodfield, she smiled slightly, reddened delicately, and 

 refused to comment. 

   

 Randy had asked her to be discreet, and Diane, a woman known for her 

 past indiscretions, followed his instructions to the letter.   After 

 all, Randy had been in the prison system for a long time--she counted 

 on him to plan their wedding, to protect her in the &quot;joint&quot; with his 

 wisdom. 

   

 &quot;Today I talked to...my caseworker,&quot; he wrote on July 4th, &quot;And 

 found out we can have a pre-marrital (sic) visit just once so ya 

 wanna try for it soon as we can arrange it?   Just let me know. 

   

 &quot;Strange as it may seem your fighting back to put me in my place, and 

 say &apos;I love you too&apos; touched me very much.   I&apos;m just amazed at how 

 we&apos;ve grown thru our letters.   Ya happy to have me for a loving 

 friend?   NO GAMES is my motto too.   Let&apos;s enjoy all we can together. 

 Tomorrow may never come.   Ya know my meaning?...Want you to think of 

 me now.   Smiling? 

   

 &quot;Say Di would your parents think about coming to your wedding?   Just 

 curious.   We can have (10) people in our party.   Then we only have 1 

 hour for the party to have pics&amp;marry.   Then guests have to leave 

 with my counselor&amp;yours and come back in if they are on the reg. 

 visiting list.   Some Thur.   (a.m.) we can marry at the far end (No 

 smoking room) for privacy.   The waiting list is 3 months now.   But we 

 will get to visit once behind (window) to talk it over some Tuesday 

 (a.m.) at OWCC [Oregon Women&apos;s Correctional Facility] Women visit on 

 Tuesdays only.   And married couples get every Tues.   (a.m.) to visit. 

 Nice4iuh? 

   

 &quot;And you&apos;ll be surprised at what kinds of &apos;fun&amp;games&apos; we&apos;ll be able 

 to have and enjoy.   Just be open and follow my lead?   We&apos;ll have some 

 very close and private visits one day.&quot; 

   

 Diane Downs believed him.   She believed Randy even more when he 

 discussed the color scheme of their &quot;wedding.&quot; 

   

 &quot;Would you mind my asking you to wear the same colors as me in our 

 ceremony?&quot;   he wrote.   &quot;You can&apos;t wear blue jeans but could tailor a 

 blue shirt like ours.   Comments?   I think we&apos;ll make a very handsome 

 couple too.   Yes? 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ve written to some newspeople for notices about our story.   Will 

 you be open to an interview there or (WCC)?   Will you 

 share your tho&apos;ts on all this?   And our own work on contacting an 

 Agent and Writer to help us with a book and movie?   Thanks. 

   

 &quot;What kind of flowers do you like, Di?   I will provide them for 

 you--no problem.   Rings we can talk more on.&quot; 

   

 The letter was signed &quot;Love and Kisses.&quot; 

   

 With that letter in her hand, Diane Downs admitted to newspapers and 

 to Anne Bradley Jaeger that yes, it was true, she was going to marry 

 Randy Woodfield--they were in love.   Yes, it was all a reality.   The 

 convicted murderess, admitted ex-mistress of a dozen or more men, 

 blushed and ducked her head as she talked of her greatest love affair. 

   

 Just as soon as Diane Downs said she wanted to marry her pen-pal 

 lover, Randy Woodfield pounced.   He shook his head and appeared 

 mystified by Diane&apos;s statements.   When reporters questioned him, 

 Randy suggested that Mrs. Downs was more confused and upset than he 

 had realized.   No, he had no idea where she might have gotten the 

 idea that he wanted to marry her.   He was sorry, and he knew it must 

 be embarrassing for her--but the lady was mistaken. 

   

 It was a major &quot;Gotcha!&quot; 

   

 He wrote to Diane on July 27th, eight days after the letter he&apos;d sent 

 planning their wedding, knowing certainly that she must have been 

 fuming with frustration and disbelief.   The hot letters from his cell 

 had &apos;cooled down to ice.&apos; 

   

 &quot;Dear Di-- &quot;My oh my--you sure have me shaking my head and holding 

 news conferences all day long--Why did you say anything to anyone 

 just now?   I&apos;m really confused, Di. 

   

 &quot;I told you I was holding all the &apos;Aces&apos; and was going to sell a 

 story of some kind to a mag, newspaper or T.V.--but now everyone 

 thinks we&apos;re getting married and it&apos;s caused a lot of unnecessary 

 problems?   Hadn&apos;t I told you about my inquirey (sic) letter to (KEZi 

 &amp;The Oregonian paper)?   You were to just sit tight and be &apos;mum&apos; and 

 refer them to me.   It may have taken a while to find a mag or 

 newspaper willing to pay for all this publicity--but it could have 

 been done...But now I had to say our &apos;visit to meet&apos; was just 

 misunderstood about &apos;marriage plans.&apos; 

 ...I&apos;m not playing games, just covering my tracks right now.   Let&apos;s 

 try again.   I hope&amp;pray this publicity doesn&apos;t affect your 

 sentencing.   Write me&amp;and ask all you wish.   I care Di.   Randy.&quot; 

   

 It was, for all intents and purposes, the end of the great romance. 

 Randy had rejected Diane over all the wire services, and had had a 

 day full of press conferences doing it.   She would never really 

 forgive him. 

   

 (Diane Downs served almost three years of her life sentence at the 

 Oregon Women&apos;s Correctional Center in Salem, but there were no 

 private visits with Randy Woodfield.   On July 11, 1987, she escaped 

 from prison, and was recaptured eleven days later.   She is now 

 imprisoned at the Clinton Correctional Institute for Women in New 

 Jersey.) 

   

 Randy Woodfield received his Associate Degree through the prison 

 educational system in June, 1987.   He glowered at photographers and 

 warned them convincingly that he did not want to have his picture 

 taken.   They moved on to other, more willing graduates. 

   

 Captain Dave Bishop is now Chief of Police in Newberg, Oregon.   He 

 teaches Criminal Justice classes at the college level, and often 

 conducts seminars on the Woodfield case for other law enforcement 

 personnel. 

   

 Detective Dave Kominek is now a Sergeant with the Keizer, Oregon, 

 Police Department.   He has investigated a number of difficult 

 homicide cases since 1981, but none as challenging as the I-5 killing 

 spree.   His name and expertise are familiar to Northwest lawmen 

 forever connected to Randy Woodfield.   His initiative in establishing 

 a network of detectives working similar unsolved cases was a model 

 for solving serial murder/rape cases in future investigations. 

   

 Beth Wilmot left Oregon and the memories behind her after her 

 testimony was no longer needed, and moved to a faraway state.   Even 

 so, she had a recurring nightmare that haunted her dreams.   &quot;I would 

 dream about Randy--see him standing in the room, wearing the jacket 

 with the hood, pointing the gun at me.   It would seem as though he 

 was really there 

 and then I&apos;d wake up--and he wasn&apos;t there at all.&quot; 

   

 The nightmare came less and less frequently.   By 1983, Beth could go 

 months without dreaming about the man with the gun. 

   

 &quot;And then,&quot; she says, her voice incredulous as she tells it.   &quot;I was 

 attacked again!   I wasn&apos;t doing anything but minding my own business. 

 I left work in broad daylight--I was wearing my uniform that I wore 

 at the cleaners where I worked.   It was just a plain smock and 

 slacks, nothing enticing or sexy.   I wasn&apos;t wearing makeup.   And I 

 walk like a boy.   I&apos;m skinny, and I walk like a boy, and you know I&apos;m 

 always aware of what&apos;s going on around me, but this day I just wanted 

 to get home and take my shoes off.&quot; 

   

 Beth noticed a large man standing across the street, and, although 

 she didn&apos;t pause to look closely, she was afraid that he was exposing 

 himself. 

   

 &quot;I just walked faster, and then all of a sudden he ran after me and 

 he jumped me.   He knocked me flat on my face, and started tearing at 

 my clothes.   He weighed about two hundred fifty pounds, more than 

 twice what I weigh, and I couldn&apos;t move.   I started screaming and, 

 people kept driving by as though it was perfectly normal for some 

 guy to be lying on top of a woman who was screaming her lungs out. 

 Finally, a family stopped and they scared him away.   I just felt 

 like, you know, why me?   Why me again?&quot; 

   

 But Beth Wilmot reported the assault to the police in the city where 

 she lives now, and her attacker was arrested and convicted. 

   

 She believes the bad days are behind her now; Beth is married and has 

 a baby.   She works at a job she loves.   She keeps in touch with Shari 

 Hull&apos;s family and with Dave Kominek and his wife, Gail. 

   

 &quot;When do you think they&apos;ll give him a parole hearing?&quot;   she asks, 

 wondering about Woodfield.   Told he might possibly become eligible 

 for parole by 1999--if Judge Brown&apos;s fifty-year minimum sentence is 

 ignored, she is outraged, but adamant. 

   

 &quot;I&apos;ll be there.   I&apos;ll only be thirty-nine then.   I&apos;ll be there if I&apos;m 

 one hundred.   I&apos;m going to be around for a long, long time and they&apos;d 

 better let me know if they start thinking about letting him out. 

 &apos;Cause I&apos;ll be there to tell them again what he did to us.   It 

 doesn&apos;t matter where I live, I&apos;ll come back to Oregon and tell them.&quot; 

   

 She means it. 

   

 As long as Randy Woodfield is in prison, there is a danger.   He may 

 escape.   He may be in the Oregon State Penitentiary so long that the 

 public forgets about his dangerousness, allowing him to convince some 

 parole board in the future that he is a changed man.   He has done it 

 before; he might do it again. 

   

 In the meantime, Woodfield continues his correspondence with women. 

 Hundreds of letters going out, slick with loving promises, seductive, 

 conniving, and obscene.   And the money comes in-one dollar, two 

 dollars, more.   Locked in prison, Randy Woodfield still &quot;rapes&quot; 

 women.   

   

 If Woodfield is to be tried in Shasta County, California, he would 

 face more than loss of freedom; he would face death. 

   

 Shasta County District Attorney Steve Carlton had an agonizing 

 decision to make in the late summer of 1983.   Randy had run out of 

 appeals in Oregon; California could extradite him for trial in the 

 murders of Donna Eckard, thirty-seven, and her fourteen-year-old 

 daughter, Janell, if they chose.   And, if Randy was convicted, he 

 might well go to the gas chamber. 

   

 The decision was complicated by the fact that Randy had his 

 Life-plus-165 year sentence in Oregon, and that a pending California 

 Supreme Court decision might cripple Carlton&apos;s case.   In 1982, the 

 California Court concluded that statements obtained from a person 

 under hypnosis could not be used as testimony in a trial.   The court 

 was presently deciding whether that initial decision would apply 

 retroactively to other cases. 

   

 Dave Kominek had hypnotized Beth Wilmot to help her remember details 

 about the man who had shot her in Salem.   Beth&apos;s testimony would be 

 crucial in Shasta County because ballistics tests showed that the 

 bullets that killed Donna Eckard and Janell Jarvis were fired from 

 the same .32 caliber pistol used to shoot Beth and Shari Hull.   If 

 the California Supreme Court should outlaw testimony elicited by 

 hypnosis retroactively, Beth would not be able to testify in the 

 Shasta County cases: two murders, and eight sex offenses. 

   

 &quot;The overriding factor, and the only reason to bring Woodfield down 

 here, is to execute him,&quot; said Carlton.   &quot;(I) must consider the 

 prospects of being successful in that ultimate goal and the cost 

 factor in attempting to achieve it.&quot; 

   

 &quot;This is a monstrous case, we estimated that we&apos;re looking at 

 probably one hundred fifty witnesses, and most of them are 

 out-of-state witnesses (from Oregon.)&quot; 

   

 Carlton felt that a trial for Randy Woodfield would last about six 

 months, and that it was possible that it would have to be moved to 

 another county because of extensive pretrial publicity. 

   

 The cost to Shasta County, not a wealthy county, would be several 

 million dollars. 

   

 There were so many &quot;ifs.&quot;   Even if Woodfield should be tried in 

 California, and found guilty, Carlton doubted that he would be 

 executed.   The last legal execution in California had occurred in 

 1967.   If the death penalty were handed down, Randy would be housed 

 in San Quentin.   California would pay for his upkeep, and Oregon 

 would save thousands of dollars a year. 

   

 There was another option--an option that still exists.   Carlton said 

 that he could simply take no immediate action.   In theory, because 

 there is no statute of limitation on murder, Woodfield could be 

 prosecuted many years down the road.   However, with the passage of 

 years, the likelihood of his facing a jury in California would grow 

 dimmer. 

   

 Local attorneys tended to agree with Steve Carlton that it would be 

 folly to try Woodfield in Shasta County.   Shasta County Public 

 Defender Frank O&apos;Connor, a former deputy district attorney, said, &quot;I 

 wouldn&apos;t do it, period.   He&apos;s never going to get Out of prison, and 

 it&apos;s a very expensive case.&quot; 

   

 Oregon State Assistant Attorney General Scott McAlister said he would 

 be &quot;mildly surprised&quot; if Carlton should decide to prosecute Randy. 

 &quot;If I were in Carlton&apos;s position, I probably would not do it.   But 

 I&apos;d like to encourage You (Shasta County) to do it anyway.&quot; 

   

 Shasta County Supervisor Don Maddox said he would support Carlton 

 whatever he decided, but he admitted concern.   &quot;The thought of the 

 fiscal impact of such a trial will undoubtedly keep me awake many 

 nights.   It could conceivably be devastating on top of other 

 financial setbacks we are attempting to overcome.&quot; 

   

 D.A.   Steve Carlton met with family members of those who had been 

 attacked or killed.   What a dilemma it was.   How do you tell a man 

 whose wife and stepdaughter have been savaged by a trolling monster 

 that there isn&apos;t enough money in the county to seek justice? 

   

 In essence, Randy Woodfield would be getting what so many detectives 

 had feared:   so many crimes for the price of a few if he never had to 

 face a California trial. 

   

 On a Wednesday in September, 1983, Steve Carlton faced the press at a 

 conference in the county courthouse in Redding.   He would not be 

 extraditing Randall Woodfield to stand trial for the murders of Donna 

 Eckard and Janell Jarvis. 

   

 &quot;I am satisfied after examining all material factors that this is the 

 only responsible course of action.   Public safety is not affected by 

 this decision.   I am convinced after meeting with the entire Oregon 

 parole board that Woodfield will never be released from prison.&quot; 

   

 Carlton could not saddle Shasta County with a two-to 

 three-million-dollar trial for a man who was serving life plus one 

 hundred sixty-five years in another state. 

   

 Steve Carlton had the support of a vast number of people, but the 

 decision was probably the most difficult he would ever have to make. 

 Donna Eckard&apos;s widower, Redding Fire Department Lieutenant Steve 

 Eckard, found no fault with Carlton.   &quot;I understand why he did it,&quot; 

 Eckard said, adding that he was not displeased with the District 

 Attorney. 

   

 Donna Eckard&apos;s father, Daryl Manville, Concurred, &quot;(He) made the 

 decision for good reasons.   I&apos;m not dissatisfied.   I have no quarrel 

 with his decision, in other words.&quot; 

   

 Without Beth Wilmot&apos;s testimony, Shasta County might have lost the 

 case, and the county might have gone bankrupt as well. 

   

 But, still... 

   

 The world goes on.   Steve Eckard remains in Redding, serving the 

 public in the city&apos;s fire department. 

   

 Beth Wilmot&apos;s nightmares rarely come now, but she still fears the 

 dark. 

   

 There is one nightmare, however, that haunts anyone who ever met 

 Randy Woodfield when he was in the grip of his compulsive deadly 

 prowls.   A nightmare that walks with the victims and the survivors 

 and also with the detectives and the prosecutors and the judges. 

   

 What if the system should fail, as it has so many times before?   What 

 if Woodfield gets out despite Judge Clarke Brown&apos;s efforts, despite 

 D.A.   Steve Carlton&apos;s assurances?   What then? 

   

 One quote about Randy comes back at odd times, late at night, or on a 

 winter Sunday evening in the rain.   Dana Middleton, now co-host of 

 her own ABC talk show in Seattle, was a young television reporter in 

 Shasta County in 1981.   She covered the murders of Donna Eckard and 

 Janell Jarvis; she pored over police reports on similar cases in the 

 Northwest.   And Dana Middleton found herself, finally, in the same 

 room with Woodfield.   He was surrounded by detectives, but even so 

 she controls an involuntary shiver as she recalls that night.   &quot;The 

 first time I ever saw him, I noticed he was quite good- looking.   But 

 then he turned around and looked at me and I saw his eyes.   They were 

 flat.   Dead eyes.   Shark&apos;s eyes.   It was exactly like looking into a 

 shark&apos;s eyes.   There was no emotion there at all, no compassion, just 

 emptiness.   I&apos;ve never seen eyes like that in a human being, never 

 before and never since.&quot;
