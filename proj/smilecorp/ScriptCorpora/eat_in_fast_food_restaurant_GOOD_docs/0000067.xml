 Children among the town’s homeless WAREHAM— 
We see them every day, yet they continue to go unnoticed.

They are the family sharing a cheap meal in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. They are the man walking along Main Street looking a bit lost and forlorn. They are the teenagers in the car parked along a dark side street. They are the older couple in the library. They are the children running ahead in a department store under the watchful eye of their mother.

They are the homeless, and they are right here in Wareham.

“People wear blinders to the homeless because they don’t want to see,”Leola MacDonald, programs director at the Wareham Area Committee for the Homeless, Inc., said.“People have actually said there’s no homeless in Wareham.”

But there are.

MacDonald deals with the homeless and near homeless through her work with Turning Point, Baby Point and Health Point, which all fall under the umbrella of the Wareham Area Committee for the Homeless, Inc.

But even she doesn’t have an exact count of the homeless population within the community.

“There are many homeless people who don’t want to be seen,”she said.“They live out in the woods until they die or go to jail.”

The stereotype of the homeless person as a middle-aged male in scruffy weather-beaten clothing rummaging through a trash bin while mumbling incoherently to himself no longer applies.

A lot of the homeless MacDonald said she sees are families with children.

“It’s heartbreaking,”she said.“I see people who have never been in here before, who have never asked for anything before, coming in now. People are desperate.”

Turning Point President Marcine Fernandes said the economy has definitely had a hand in forcing people to have to give up their homes.

“There are homeless families due to job loss and low income, but it’s not low enough to allow them to be subsidized,”she said.“Some people have medical situations that take up all the money they have. They do not have insurance, and we do not have free clinics here in Wareham as cities do. Most people are the working poor.”

At Turning Point, MacDonald said,“We want to get people before they fall through the cracks.”

“We try to keep people in their homes,”she said.“We will work to help get people rent so they can remain where they are, but we have to know they’ll be able to pay next month’s rent. We are not here to enable in any way. We’re here to help people while they try to get on their feet.”

Sometimes it’s too late, however, and the families are quite literally out on the street.

In such cases, families may spend a night in a local motel or end up in a shelter.

Shelters in Hyannis and Brockton are the only ones that will take people from Wareham.

“New Bedford will take Wareham, but they never have any beds,”MacDonald said.“It’s horrible out there. When you can’t keep a family in a home and you watch them go to a shelter with their kids, it tears me up every time.”

She said the newly homeless or near homeless don’t often know how to ask for help.

“These are people who themselves a year or so ago would be giving to organizations such as this, and now they are coming here because they have no where else to go.”

She said she’s had people come in, often with children, who didn’t know help was available to them and hadn’t eaten in a couple of days.

Fernandes said that for some people, asking for help is difficult.

“Many are in this situation for the first time and are embarrassed,”she said.“I try to tell them everyone needs help some time, and all the years they worked and paid taxes have earned them the right to seek a little help.”

But what about those who won’t or can’t seek help?

Fernandes said there are some people with mental health issues that become homeless, as do some with drug and alcohol problems.

“Clients with mental health issues we try to refer out to other agencies for help,”she said.

Getting them to accept any sort of assistance, though, is not always easy.

MacDonald said there’s a considerable population that moves like shadows through society. They take refuge in tent cities in the woods, and it’s uncertain how they survive.

She mentions a man who lives in the woods by choice.

“He comes from big money,”she said.“He’s very, very intelligent. But he wouldn’t go inside for anything. He’s been living outside for about 20 years. He might go into detox once in a while when it’s cold, but then he’s back in the woods again. But he’s content. He reads the newspaper and knows all about the stocks. He’ll clean up at campground showers, and that’s his life.”

Cleanliness is an obvious problem for those living in the woods or in abandoned buildings with little or no access to soap and water.

MacDonald said in the summer it’s much easier. They bathe in ponds or rivers or they’ll go to a campground and use the public showers.

And while some shy away from any form of structured environment, she said there are those who will seek medical attention for real, or imagined, ailments.

“They’ll go up to Tobey,”she said.“Sometimes they’ll go to keep warm or they’ll play sick to get a sandwich. Sometimes they’ll really be sick or injured.”

Just about all are alcoholics.

“About the only thing they’ll share with each other is a bottle,”she said.“They drink to stay warm.”

She said most of the homeless that live in the woods are men. Women are more elusive, especially if they have children.

“In the summer, you’ll see the women with their kids in the woods,”she said.“Women are more reluctant to admit their homeless because of the fear of their kids being taken away.”

But their fear of the Department Social Services can leave women and children at risk.

“They’d rather live out of their cars than come to us and say they’re homeless because they are so terrified of their children being taken. I’ll tell you this right now, there are a whole bunch of kids living in cars in this town.”

Despite the dire circumstances, there are happy endings.

A young man comes immediately to mind for MacDonald.

“He lived in the woods because he wanted to. He wanted to be an environmentalist. He cooked every dinner on an open fire. He made a great pork roast.”

She said he is now in a program where he’s being helped and is no longer living in the woods.

Sometimes, she said, when people get a little money, they’ll rent out a motel room for a night or two. When the money runs out, she said,“they’re back in the woods.”

“Most of them, if you were to meet them, are good people,”she said.“They want to be left alone and disappear.”

MacDonald said she became involved with wanting to help the homeless and near homeless years ago after hearing of an incident she can’t forget.

At the time she was working for the MBTA out of Sullivan Station.

“There was a family living in their car near the station,”she said.“There were parents and some kids. All the drivers would try to help them out. They had jobs, but they didn’t have enough for an apartment. They really tried to stay together. One of the parents would work during the day so the other could be with the kids, and the other parent worked nights. Their money went into keeping the car running and for gas so they could continue to work. One day someone called DSS on them and they came and took the kids away.”

There is a bit of a quiver to MacDonald’s voice as she continues.

 

“It was pitiful. Pitiful that they did that.”

Both Fernandes and MacDonald said they would like to see a transitional housing program take root in town.

“Families could stay in the housing up to a year while waiting to get their Section 8 certificates,”Fernandes said.“This would give them the chance to save money to cover their first and last months’rent, which is generally required before you can move in. This would help to give families a little nest egg.”

She said she believes“the Wareham community overall has been trying to cope with the problem.”

“The churches have been the ones to help the most with the problem,”she said.

She also mentioned other agencies such as WomenAde and the Community Resource Network that work hand-in-hand with Turning Point.

“You never get used to it,”MacDonald said.“You can’t cry in front of them because it will make them feel worse. You can just hope that you’re able to make a difference, even if it’s just for a few days.”

Some homeless live out of sight in the forest
 
While organizations like Turning Point and WomenAde and the Community Resource Network diligently work at keeping people in their homes and offer support to those who have found themselves suddenly without a home, there are those who prefer to stay under the radar and would rather disappear into the woods.

It’s hard to imagine anyone choosing to live outside during the bitterly cold months of winter.

But according to various accounts, there are indeed secluded communities that exist off the beaten path.

People can spend years living undetected in such places as the Myles Standish State Forest (MSSF).

And although the MSSF offers seasonal camping, there are those who continue to remain long after the other campers have gone.

Anne Roach, Communications Manager for the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), which oversees the MSSF, said this is not exclusive to this part of the state.

“State parks do see camping customers that utilize campgrounds as an alternative to expensive housing or social services as a result of their homeless status,”she said.“According to DCR regulations, campers and their camping equipment are welcome in Myles Standish State Forest (or any of the state campgrounds) for 14 cumulative days in any one park between Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends each season.”

Though“squatters”are said to be very cautious of being discovered and are often one step ahead of park personnel, Roach said DCR staff“will occasionally encounter unregistered campers throughout the system, both during and after the camping season.”

“While staff is sensitive to the person&apos;s situation, we do inform them that their camping is illegal and warn them of the very real dangers of camping outside of the campground season when hunters are in the parks,”she said.

 She said that MSSF staff“has not noticed much of this activity recently.” 

“However, the park consists of 16,000 forested acres and, therefore, unsanctioned camping may be occurring. We would urge anyone to report such occurrences to DCR staff.”
