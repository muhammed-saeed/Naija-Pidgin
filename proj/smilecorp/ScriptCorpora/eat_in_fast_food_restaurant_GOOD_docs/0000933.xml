 The Chicken Rice Shop 

Jul 4th, 2007 by Neo 
 


Let me show you what I had for dinner today. Yes, nothing beats chicken rice from the famous The Chicken Rice Shop . I guess this is the only chicken rice operator with an online presence. Heard there is a very famous chicken rice stall in Kajang (behind the Kajang wet market), but I doubt they have a website, maybe they don’t even know how to surf the web.

 

The restaurant serves lots of differently prepared chickens. There are traditionally steamed, roast, honey, barbecued or braised chicken to choose from…too many until I don’t know which to choose for. In the menu, all of them look too good to be missed. But in the end I just simply pick two of them. 

 

 

Authentic honey chicken from the best chicken rice restaurant in town! You look at it you will salivate already!

 

Another signature dish which is my favorite is the so called Pai Tee or fondly known as Top Hats among my friends. It is made of dainty pastry shells filled with shredded vegetables and chicken meat accompanied by a tangy sweet-sour sauce.

 

The Pai Tee is so crunchy and yummy. It’s a perfect“dessert”to go with the main course–the chicken rice.

 According to Wikipedia , up to now there are a total of 24 outlets in the Peninsular Malaysia (excluded Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan). So, next time you know where to go for the best chicken rice already.

Eh, besides this The Chicken Rice Shop, do you there’s one called The House of Chicken Rice? I think they serve the same kind food. Yeah, PaiTee rocks! But i’ve only tried the one from house of chicken rice.

Oh my god!!! I love“Chicken Rice Shop”so much. When we talk about its price, i think it is affordable to all students. When to talk about value, i think it is also included. I like to drop by to this shop when i go to shopping. For sure i like to order the curry chicken set. The satisfaction i really can’t tell. You need to try only can know its tastes. Yummy!!!
