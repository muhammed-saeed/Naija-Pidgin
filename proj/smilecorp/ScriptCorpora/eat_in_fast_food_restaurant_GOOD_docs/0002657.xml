Whether a restaurant is good or bad is in the eye of the beholder. Quality of food, standard of service, the view, wine selection and cleanliness all contribute to one&apos;s perception of whether a restaurant is good or bad; however, while a restaurant can be one person&apos;s favorite of all time, the same place will make someone else run out the door before being seated.
 
A great restaurant inspires cravings for its signature dishes, and a frequent longing to eat there more than once a week. Great restaurants are places where everyone really does know your name, or at least they recognize your face. At a great restaurant, if they don&apos;t know you, they act like they do in a way that comes across as sincere. A great restaurant is one that all out of town guests are encouraged to visit, but would not know about without advice from locals.

Depending on where a restaurant is located, characteristics take on different levels of importance. A restaurant on the beach can get away with shoddy food and inattentive service because diners will be mesmerized by the view. A place diners can dock their boat and head straight for the self-service beer cooler will survive long lines, especially if the line cook keeps flipping shrimp boiled in Old Bay to people waiting to order. A steakhouse in a strip mall will not have such luck, and must serve up more appetizing food. A restaurant frequented by theater-goers will not make it if service is slow, while a tuxedo-and-diamonds establishment will flounder if the salad is served before the soup, and wine is not opened tableside.

The quality of a restaurant depends on the expectations of the diners. Someone looking for a quick bite during lunch has different expectations than a nervous twenty five year old, about to propose marriage. Parents taking their kids out for Sunday lunch after church want something different than co-workers out for happy hour.

If a perfect restaurant existed, and it is quite possible that one does, it would have the following qualities:

-Always a table available without the restaurant being deserted.

-Open seven days a week for at least lunch and dinner.

-Lunch crowds can munch on huge custom made salads that are still available at dinner. Dinner guests have delectable selections of steaks and entrees, with the option for a big salad if that is what they are craving.

-Service is attentive, but not imposing. The server respects the rhythm of the individual diners.

-The well rounded menu, no matter what the theme, contains salads, soups, appetizers, steak, chicken, fish and vegetarian options, with no single category shortchanged.

-Reasonably priced, homemade desserts are available to finish the meal.

-A wine list that is not illegible or unaffordable.

-Has not been cited for numerous health violations.

-Is no more than fifteen minutes away from home.

The restaurant above exists, for many a diner, in many a city. It is immediately apparent by the plans one makes to return before finishing a meal. A perfect restaurant is discovered over and over again by new patrons and old. It is the place to return when a swanky new establish does not live up to reviews, or when it is just time for something familiar. A good restaurant beckons from the dark night, folds its patrons in, tucks metaphorical napkins under their chins, and lets them settle in for a familiar, almost home-cooked meal.
