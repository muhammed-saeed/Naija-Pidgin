 Do some cardio. Not long treadmill stuff, but short, very intense cardio that makes you extremely tired afterwards.

Also, eat less fattening foods.

 Hey, i&apos;m 17 and a size 16, 5ft 8. I had a similar issue when I was your age, i was always unhappy with myself. The best way to lose weight is to eat well and exercise, it is better to commit yourself to a lifestyle change rather then a diet. I found it difficult to diet for long amounts of time so i decided to make a lifestyle change (although it is at your discretion to how dramatic that change is) is manage to lose weight some weeks and stay the same other weeks but that doesn&apos;t bother. Stay away from diet pills, been there tried that, they are expensive and as soon as you stop taking them you gain the weight back usually with a couple of extra pounds. I have a glass of water with a lemon every morning before I eat, it takes a while to get comfortable with but it makes your body feel a lot cleaner (I loosely follow the Liver Cleansing Diet). Don&apos;t sacrifice time out with your friends, going to cafes ect, just make smarter decisions with what you order, most places now have healthy options. Try and exercise 4 times a week, 30mins plus, walk around the block or something similar. I love the exercyle and pilates. With the clothes issue I had the same issue also, i found the best thing is to stop thinking of clothing size as number and buy what fits and is comfortable and figure out what suits you. Remember that sometimes weight loss isn&apos;t the solution to your body issues so don&apos;t get to caught up in. Acccepting yourself and loving yourself is better then any diet, i wish that I had learnt that lesson earlier it would have made me early teens a lot easier. Good Luck.

 It&apos;s totally fine to want to diet and lose weight to feel more confident in yourself in clothes.
I personally also did the same..was 160 lbs and dropped to 120 lbs and now I have more confidence in myself by far. :) (5 ft 7)
Losing weight can be very beneficial for overall regulating your health and eating habits.

You are so right. Quick fix is not the answer. To be 121 lbs, you have to eat like 121 lb person consistently. To start off you can eat slightly less to get the weight loss going but the whole point should be to change the kinds of things you eat permanently. That means, yes, you may have to kick the cookies and chips and chocolate FOREVER..but hopefully those kinds of sacrifices you are willing to make to get healthy and stay healthy.

Start with this: Have 3 meals a day. Make breakfast either 1 serving size of cereal +skim milk or oatmeal+skim milk with some orange juice. For lunch, eat only from the food groups of fruit and veggies (4-7 fresh things in their natural form). An example could be eating all of the following for lunch: apple, banana, baby carrots, pickles, broccoli, berries, melon. For dinner, have something simple like a potato or corn or bowl of brown rice, accompanied by two to three vegetables.
If you are hungry in between, have an apple or banana when that happens.
This is the best diet I know of because you can always turn to fresh fruits and veggies when hungry and the two meals breakfast and dinner stabilise you.

Foods to avoid at all costs: full fat or 2% milk (try to drink skim milk instead), cheese, peanut butter, butter, bread, white rice, cookies, chips, pastries, candy, chocolate, anything that seems like junk food, fast food, restaurant food, any grain or granola bars, pork, beef, nuts, oils, salty food, fried food, sugars, any sauces and condiments, meat, cafeteria food (bring your own food)

Try to drink water instead of all other drinks except for a juice in the morning.

For exercise try to do at least 30 min of something every other day. It could be : swimming, workout video, streching, walking, jogging, playing outside, basketball, soccer, dancing, etc.

I personally find strategic workout videos to work the best in making a body look good fast, so I suggest try to use those routinely if you have them at your house or can buy them, or look for 30 min workouts online like on YouTube.

Stay determine and focused on your goal. Be stronger than yourself and don&apos;t let yourself down for a moment! Don&apos;t form bad habits because it sends yourself the message that you can&apos;t do it if you continuously go back to your old diet. Stick to it, and after a week or two it will be easier if you can get past the first few days.

Hope this helps!! :)
