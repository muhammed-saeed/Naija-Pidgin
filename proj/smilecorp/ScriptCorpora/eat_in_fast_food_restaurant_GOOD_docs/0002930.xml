 WHy American is better than any other country on the face of the Earth Lets face it, America is fucking awesome. It is better than any other country out there. Home to 300 million of the most creative people ever to grace this hunk of dirt we call home. If were not for America the world would truly be a boring place, a gray lump in a ocean of mediocrity.


When we grew bored as a people America entertained us. first with jazz an the blues. but latter with rock, hip hop, country, metal, and pop. the music of the world came from the hearts an minds of Americans. America also developed a movie industry so that the great stories of our generation could be shared with all of humanity. Spreading ideals of love an beauty to the far corners of the earth.


Americans have always done what could not be done. We broke free from gravities embrace at kitty hawk. flying with the birds for the first time. And when man wanted to reach for the stars, America took up the cause. We were not content simply staring off into the deep reaches of space. No, we gathered our greatest minds together an we put a man on the moon.


Americans have been at the fore front of the arts an sciences for nearly 150 years. the world wears our fashions, they eat our food, they watch our movies, and they listen to our music. Why? Because we are better. Our stuff is better. And everyone knows it.


No other country, no other people have been so influential in such a short span of history. we are living in the midst of a second cultural renaissance a rebirth of knowledge. and it is all thanks to America.

 America&apos;s the best country anyone ever stole. A lot of it fucking sucks though, namely the midwest. Coasts FTW. There&apos;s alot of other cool countries though, namely countries that have free healthcare, aren&apos;t completely owned by corporations and are free from draconian drug laws.

 Okay, so the OP is one of the many problems with America.
Arrogant, and egotistical.
Now, I&apos;m not saying America is a shit country. It just isn&apos;t the best country in the world. Home to the most creative in the world? I hope you were being sarcastic.
Now, concerning the music, I will agree that America is pretty big in that industry, but again, the music of the world did NOT come from the &apos;hearts an minds&apos; of Americans. It came from the world.

Concerning the Arts and Sciences, other countries have contributed a LOT as well, so it&apos;s not something that you can claim as your own. The same goes for fashion, food, movies, and music. And you say because your stuff is better?
I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t know that corn dogs, deep dish pizza and apple pie were better than anything produced by the French, or the Italians.
And about the movies; lately, not many decent films have come out of America. (Disaster movie cough.)

Yes, no other country has been so influential. The reason for that is the sheer number of people living there who have such a high standard of living.

 1719 Fire engine

* A fire apparatus, fire engine, fire truck, or fire appliance is a vehicle designed to assist in fighting fires, by transporting firefighters to the scene, and providing them with access, water or other equipment. In some areas, the terms fire engine and fire truck represent different types of fire fighting apparatus. The city of Philadelphia obtained a hand-pumped fire engine in 1719, years after Boston&apos;s 1654 model appeared there, made by Joseph Jencks.

1731 Sextant

* The sextant is an astronomical instrument that is used to determine latitude for navigation. It does this by measuring angular distances, like the altitude of the sun, moon and stars. The sextant invented by Thomas Godfrey replaced the astrolabe. The word sextant comes from the Latin word meaning&quot;one sixth.&quot;

1742 Franklin stove

* The Franklin Stove, named after its inventor, Benjamin Franklin, is a metal-lined fireplace with baffles in the rear to improve the airflow, providing more heat and less smoke than an ordinary open fireplace. It is also known as the circulating stove. The stove became very popular and gradually replaced open fireplaces. To this day, most American fireplaces are box-shaped, similar to the Franklin stove.

1749 Lightning rod

* A lightning rod is a single component in a lightning protection system. In addition to rods placed at regular intervals on the highest portions of a structure, a lightning protection system typically includes a rooftop network of conductors, multiple conductive paths from the roof to the ground, bonding connections to metallic objects within the structure and a grounding network. The pointed lightning rod conductor, also called a&quot;lightning attractor&quot;or&quot;Franklin rod,&quot;was invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1749 as part of his groundbreaking explorations of electricity.

1761 Glass harmonica

* Benjamin Franklin invented a radically new arrangement of glasses in 1761 after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edmund Delaval at Cambridge in England in 1758. Franklin, who called his invention the&quot;armonica&quot;after the Italian word for harmony, worked with London glassblower Charles James to build one, and it had its world premiere in early 1762, played by Marianne Davies. In Franklin&apos;s version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally nested on an iron spindle. The whole spindle turned by means of a foot-operated treadle. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note.

1775 Submarine

* A submarine is a watercraft capable of independent operation below water. Although an impractical predecessor to the submarine was built by Cornelius Jacobszoon Drebbel in 1620, David Bushnell is accurately credited for building the world&apos;s first submarine truly intended for it&apos;s purpose. That is, for armed warfare with the use of a screw propeller. Initially used by Ezra Lee during the American War of Independence on a secret mission to sink the HMS Eagle (1774), Bushnell called his invention the Turtle (submarine) because of its look in the water. His idea of using water as ballast for submerging and raising his submarine is the first of it&apos;s kind, which to this day, remains as the underlying principle still used in modern submarines.

1782 Flatboat

* A flatboat is a rectangular boat with a flat bottom and square ends used to transport freight and passengers on inland waterways. After serving through the American War of Independence in the Pennsylvania line, Jacob Yoder built a large boat at Fort Red Stone (now Brownsville), on the Monongahela River, which he freighted with flour and carried to New Orleans in May, 1782. With the profits of this venture he bought peltries which he sold in Havana, investing the proceeds in sugar for the Philadelphia market. This was the first attempt to navigate the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for commercial purposes.

1784 Bifocals

* Bifocals are eyeglasses whose corrective lenses each contain regions with two distinct optical powers. Benjamin Franklin is usually credited with the creation of the first pair of bifocals in the early 1760s, though the first indication of his double spectacles comes from a political cartoon printed in 1764. A great number of letters and publications from that time period refer to Dr. Franklin&apos;s double spectacles, including his first reference to them in a letter dated August 21, 1784.

1794 Steam locomotive

* A steam locomotive is a locomotive powered by steam. The term usually refers to its use on railways, but can also refer to a&quot;road locomotive&quot;such as a traction engine or steamroller. Steam locomotives dominated rail traction from the mid 19th century until the mid 20th century, after which they were superseded by diesel and electric locomotives. The world&apos;s first working model of a steam rail locomotive was designed and constructed by John Fitch (inventor) in the United States in 1794. Although Fitch hoped to win backing for a full scale working locomotive by demonstrating his invention to George Washington and his cabinet, interest in it was not forthcoming, and the locomotive was soon forgotten and lost. In 1804, railway transportation was made practical by Richard Trevithick with his full scale steam locomotive in England.

1794 Cotton gin

* A cotton gin is a machine that quickly and easily separates the cotton fibers from the seedpods and the sometimes sticky seeds, a job previously done by hand. These seeds are either used again to grow more cotton or, if badly damaged, are disposed of. It uses a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through the screen, while brushes continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent jams.Eli Whitney and his invention makes possible a revolution in the cotton industry and the rise of&quot;King Cotton&quot;as the main cash crop in the South. However, it will never make him rich. Instead of buying his machine, farmers built bogus versions of their own which lead to the increasing desire for slave labor.

1795 Jefferson disk

* The Jefferson disk, or wheel cypher, is a cipher system for encrypting messages and used as a deterrent for codebreaking. Using 26 wheels, each with the letters of the alphabet arranged randomly around them, Thomas Jefferson invented the wheel cypher in 1795.

1796 Rumford fireplace

* The Rumford fireplace created a sensation when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. He and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue. It effectively produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than lingering and often choking the residents. While heating technology has greatly advanced and improved, the Rumford fireplace is seeing a resurgence of use in the 21st century.

[edit] 1800s

1805 Self-propelled amphibious vehicle

* An amphibious vehicle is a vehicle or craft, that is a means of transport, viable on land as well as on water, just like an amphibian. Oliver Evans&quot;Orukter Amphibolos&quot;dredges the waters near the Philadelphia docks. Its steam-powered engine drove either wooden wheels or a paddle wheel used as a means of transport, viable on land as well as on water. Evans demonstrated his machine in Philadelphia&apos;s Center Square, where he passed the hat for money.

1805 Refrigeration

* The American inventor Oliver Evans, who is acclaimed as the&quot;father of refrigeration,&quot;designed the first refrigeration machine in 1805. In 1843, John Gorrie, an American doctor from Florida made the world&apos;s first mechanical device based on Evans&apos; invention that would make ice in order to cool the air for yellow fever patients. The first electric refrigerator was invented in 1903 by Thomas Moore. The first commercial refrigerator designed to keep food cold was sold in 1911 by the General Electric Company and in 1913, invented by Fred W. Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana); these models consisted of a unit that was mounted on top of an ice box. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet, was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by W.C. Durant in 1918, who started the Frigidaire Company in order to mass-produce refrigerators.

1806 Coffee pot (filtered)

* A coffee pot is a kitchen implement; a cooking pot in the kettle family. A coffee pot is also a container to hold freshly brewed coffee.Benjamin Thompson Rumford invented a percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve to strain away the grounds.

1814 Interchangeable parts

* Interchangeable parts are components of any device designed to specifications which ensure that they will fit within any device of the same type. This streamlines the manufacturing process, since all pieces are guaranteed to fit with all others, and it similarly creates the opportunity for replacement parts. Achieving mass production using interchangeable parts was an American. According to Diana Muir writing in Reflections in Bullough&apos;s Pond, the world&apos;s first complex machine mass-produced from interchangeable parts was a pillar-and-scroll clock invented by Eli Terry, which rolled off the production line in 1814 at Plymouth, Connecticut.

1815 Dental floss

* Dental floss is either a bundle of thin nylon filaments or a plastic (Teflon or polyethylene) ribbon used to remove food and dental plaque from teeth. Levi Spear Parmly, a dentist from New Orleans, is credited with inventing the first form of dental floss. He had been recommending that people should clean their teeth with silk floss since 1815.

1818 Lathe (woodworking)

* A woodworking lathe is an adjustable horizontal metal rail and a tool rest, between the material and the operator which accommodates the positioning of shaping tools, which are usually hand-held. With wood, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object after shaping to smooth the surface made with the metal shaping tools. Thomas Blanchard of Middlebury, Connecticut, builds a woodworking lathe that does the work of 13 men. His invention helps to lower wood prices.

1818 Milling machine

* A milling machine is a machine tool used for the shaping of metal and other solid materials. Its basic form is that of a rotating cutter which rotates about the spindle axis (similar to a drill), and a table to which the workpiece is affixed. In contrast to drilling, where the drill is moved exclusively along its axis, the milling operation involves movement of the rotating cutter sideways as well as &apos;in and out&apos;. Simeon North is generally credited with the invention of the milling machine, the first entirely new type of machine invented in America and the machine that, by replacing filing, made interchangeable parts practical.

1831 Reaping machine

* A reaper is a person or machine that reaps (cuts and gathers) crops when they are ripe. The invention developed by Cyrus McCormick which cut grain much faster than a man with a scythe, failed to catch on. After taking his operation to Chicago, McCormick prospered. By 1871 his company was selling 10,000 reapers per year.

1832 National park

* A national park is a reserve of land, usually declared and owned by a national government, protected from most human development and pollution. The first effort by any government to set aside such protected lands was in the United States, on April 20, 1832, when President Andrew Jackson signed legislation to set aside four sections of land around what is now Hot Springs, Arkansas to protect the natural, thermal springs and adjoining mountainsides for the future disposal of the federal government. It was known as the Hot Springs Reservation. In 1872, Yellowstone National Park was established as arguably the world&apos;s first truly national park.

1833 Lock-stitch sewing machine

* Walter Hunt invents the first lock-stitch sewing machine, but loses interest and does not patent his invention. Later, Elias Howe secures patent on an original lock-stitch machine, but fails to manufacture and sell it. Still later, Isaac Singer infringes on Howe&apos;s patent to make his own machine, which makes Singer rich. Most, if not all modern sewing machines today use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, which consists of two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and finally through the hole in the needle. The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine.

1834 Threshing machine

* John Avery and Hiram Abial Pitts invent significant improvements to a machine that automatically threshes and separates grain from chaff, freeing farmers from a slow and laborious process. They were granted a patent on December 29, 1837.

1835 Wrench

* A wrench or spanner is a tool used to provide a mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn bolts, nuts or other items designed to interface with a wrench. The first wrench was invented and patented in 1835 by Solymon Merrick.

1836 Revolver

* A revolver is a repeating firearm that consists of multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing. To finance the development of his&quot;six shooter,&quot;Samuel Colt traveled the lecture circuit, giving demonstrations of laughing gas. Colt&apos;s new weapon failed to catch on, and he went bankrupt in 1842 at age 28. He reorganized and sold his first major order to the War Department during the Mexican War in 1846, and went on to become rich.

1836 Combine harvester

* The combine harvester, or simply combine, also known as a thresher is a machine that combines the tasks of harvesting, threshing, and cleaning grain crops. The first successful combine, a horse-drawn machine requiring a team of twenty horses, was invented in 1836 by Hiram Moore and J. Hascall in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

1836 Telegraph (electrical)

* The electromagnetic telegraph is a device for human-to-human transmission of coded text messages over wire. Contrary to popular belief, Samuel F.B. Morse did not invent the electric telegraph. In 1836 an American scientist, David Alter, invented the first practical telegraph, in Elderton, Pennsylvania, one year before the much more popular Morse telegraph was invented. Alter demonstrated it to witnesses. However, Morse&apos;s telegraph was commercially decisive as his working telegraph machine was patented in 1837, with help from his business partners Leonard Gale and Alfred Vail. Morse used a dots-and-spaces code for the letters of the alphabet and the numbers Morse Code was later improved to use dots, dashes and spaces: for example E is dot, T is dash, A is dot-dash, N is dash-dot, O is dash-dash-dash, I is dot-dot, S is dot-dot-dot, etc. By 1838, Morse could send 10 words per minute. Congress provided funds for building a telegraph line between Washington D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland, in 1843. Morse sent the first telegraphic message from Washington D.C. to Baltimore on May 24, 1844. The message was:&quot;What hath God wrought?&quot;The telegraph revolutionized long-distance communications.

1842 Anesthesia (ether)

* Crawford Long, of Jefferson, Georgia, performs the first operation using an ether-based anesthesia, when he removes a tumor from the neck of Mr. James Venable. Long will not reveal his discovery until 1849.

1842 Grain elevator

* Grain elevators are buildings or complexes of buildings for storage and shipment of grain. They were invented in 1842 in Buffalo, New York, by Joseph Dart, who first developed a steam-powered mechanism, called a marine leg, for scooping grain out of the hulls of ships directly into storage silos.

1843 Rotary printing press

* A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. Richard Hoe creates a revolution in printing by rolling a cylinder over stationary plates of inked type and using the cylinder to make an impression on paper. This eliminated the need for making impressions directly from the type plates themselves, which were heavy and difficult to maneuver.

1844 Vulcanized rubber

* Vulcanization refers to a specific curing process of rubber involving high heat and the addition of sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon to carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks, tires, shoe soles, horses and many more. Most textbooks point out that Charles Goodyear invented vulcanization of rubber as used. Depending on what you read, the Goodyear story is one of either pure luck or careful research. Goodyear insisted that it was the latter, though many contemporaneous accounts indicate the former.

1849 Safety pin

* A safety pin is a simple fastening device, a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes: to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point. The safety pin was invented by American inventor Walter Hunt, and patented in April, 1849. The rights to the invention were sold for $400.

1849 Street sweeper

* Street sweepers are equipped with water tanks and sprayers used to loosen particles and reduce dust. The brooms gather debris into a main collection area from which it is vacuumed and pumped into a collection bin. The first mechanical street sweeper was invented by C.S. Bishop, patented on September 4, 1849.

1853 Potato chip (crisps)

* The original potato chip recipe was created by chef George Crum at Moon&apos;s Lake House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853. Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin that they couldn&apos;t be eaten with a fork. As they couldn&apos;t be fried normally in a pan, he decided to stir-fry the potato slices. Against Crum&apos;s expectation, the guest was ecstatic about the new chips and they soon became a regular item on the lodge&apos;s menu.

1853 Clothespin

* A clothespin is a fastener with a lever action used to hang up clothes for drying, usually on a clothes line. Clothespins often come in many different designs. This design was invented by David M. Smith of Springfield, Vermont, in 1853.

1854 Hairbrush

* A hairbrush is a small brush with rigid bristles used in hair care for brushing, styling, and detangling human hair, or for brushing a domestic animal&apos;s fur. The earliest hairbrush was by the inventor Hugh Rock in 1854. A brush with elastic wire teeth along with natural bristles was patented by Samuel Firey in 1870.

1856 Condensed milk

* Condensed milk, also known as sweetened condensed milk, is cow&apos;s milk from which water has been removed and to which sugar has been added, yielding a very thick, sweet product that can last for years without refrigeration if unopened. Gail Borden created condensed milk for soldiers during the American Civil War.

1857 Elevator (passenger safety system)

* An elevator or lift is a vertical transport vehicle that efficiently moves people or goods between floors of a building. Elisha Graves Otis dramatically demonstrates his passenger elevator at the Crystal Palace Exposition in New York by cutting the elevator&apos;s cables as it ascends a 300-foot (91 m) tower. Otis&apos; unique safety braking system prevents the elevator from falling; his business prospects rise.

1857 Toilet paper (rolled and perforated)

* Joseph Gayetty invented toilet paper in 1857. His new toilet paper was composed of flat sheets. Before Gayetty&apos;s invention, people tore pages out of mail order catalogs - before catalogs were common, leaves were used. Unfortunately, Gayetty&apos;s invention failed. In 1867, Thomas, Edward and Clarence Scott (brothers from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) were successful at marketing toilet paper that consisted of a small roll of perforated paper . They sold their new toilet paper from a push cart - this was the beginning of the Scott Paper Company.

1858 Burglar alarm

* A burglar alarm contains sensors which are connected to a control unit via a low-voltage hardwire or narrowband RF signal which is used to interact with a response device. Edwin Holmes (American) of Boston begins to sell electric burglar alarms. Later, his workshop will be used by Alexander Graham Bell as the young Bell pursues his invention of the telephone. Holmes will be the first person to have a home telephone.

1858 Can opener

* A can opener is a device used to open metal cans. Ezra Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut was an American inventor, who invented and patented his design of a can opener in 1858. Crudely shaped bayonet and sickle combo, his design was widely accepted by the U.S. military during the period of the American Civil War.

1859 Oil well (modern)

* An oil well is a general term for any boring through the Earth&apos;s surface designed to find and produce petroleum oil hydrocarbons. Drilling at Titusville, Pennsylvania,&quot;Colonel&quot;Edwin Drake strikes oil at a depth of 69.5 feet (21.2 m). Prior to that, oil, which had been used mostly as a lubricant and lamp fuel, had been obtained only at places where it seeped from the ground. Western Pennsylvania witnesses the world&apos;s first oil boom.

1860 Water tower (modern)

* A water tower or elevated water tower is a large elevated water storage container constructed for the purpose of holding a water supply at a height sufficient to pressurize a water distribution system. The city of Louisville, Kentucky begins using the first modern water tower, to equalize pressure and allow for clean running water. This was the first major advancement in water technology since the fall of the Roman Empire.

1860 Repeating rifle

* A repeating rifle is a single barreled rifle containing multiple rounds of ammunition. Benjamin Tyler Henry, chief designer for Oliver Fisher Winchester&apos;s arms company, adapts a breech-loading rifle invented by Walter Hunt and creates a new lever action repeating rifle. First known as the Henry, the rifle will soon be famous as simply the Winchester.

1861 Modern pin tumbler lock

* The pin tumbler lock is a lock mechanism that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may also be found in tubular or radial locks. Linus Yale, Jr. improved upon his father&apos;s original design (patented in 1848) in 1861, using a smaller, flat key with serrated edges that is the basis of modern pin-tumbler locks.

1863 Breakfast cereal

* Breakfast cereal is a packaged food product made from natural ingredients intended to be consumed as part of a breakfast. It is usually eaten cold as a ready-to-eat meal and mixed with a liquid, such as milk or water, though occasionally nuts and fruit are also added. The first breakfast cereal, Granula (named after granules) was invented in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson, operator of the Jackson Sanitorium in Dansville, New York and a staunch vegetarian. The cereal never became popular; it was far too inconvenient, as the heavy bran nuggets needed soaking overnight before they were tender enough to eat.

1863 Four-wheeled roller skates

* Roller skates are devices worn on the feet to enable the wearer to roll along on wheels, consisting of a boot with four wheels with ball bearings, arranged in the same way as those of a typical car. James Plimpton of Medford, Massachusetts, gives the world the first practical four-wheeled roller skate. This sets off a roller craze that quickly spreads across the U.S. and Europe.

1865 Rotary printing press (web)

* William Bullock (inventor) introduced a printing press that could feed paper on a continuous roll and print both sides of the paper at once. Used first by the Philadelphia Ledger, the machine would become an American standard. It would also kill its maker, who died when he accidentally fell into one of his presses.

1866 Urinal

* A urinal is a specialized toilet for urinating only, generally by men and boys. It has the form of a container or simply a wall, with drainage and automatic or manual flushing. The urinal was first introduced by Andrew Rankin on March 27, 1866.

1867 Motorcycle

* A motorcycle is a single-track, two-wheeled motor vehicle powered by an engine. The earliest motorcycle was a coal-powered, two-cylinder, steam-driven motorcycle that was developed in 1867 by the American inventor Sylvester Howard Roper.

1867 Paper clip

* A paper clip is an instrument used to securely attach sheets of paper together, whilst allowing them to be detached as necessary. The first patent for a paper fastener was awarded to Samuel B. Fay of the United States in 1867.

1867 Barbed wire

* Barbed wire is a type of fencing wire constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strands. Farmer Henry Rose, invents the product that will close down the open cattle ranges by closing in cattle onto individual plots of privately owned land. I.L. Ellwood and Company&apos;s Glidden Steel Barb Wire will dominate the market; by 1890 the open range will be only a memory.

1868 Vacuum cleaner

* A vacuum cleaner is a device that uses an air pump to create a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. The first manually-powered cleaner using vacuum principles was the&quot;Whirlwind&quot;, invented in Chicago in 1868 by Ives W. McGaffney.

1869 Clothes hanger

* A clothes hanger, or coat hanger, is a device in the shape of human shoulders designed to facilitate the hanging of a coat, jacket, sweater, shirt, blouse or dress in a manner that prevents wrinkles, with a lower bar for the hanging of trousers or skirts. The shoulder-shaped wire hanger, was inspired by a coat hook that was invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New Britain, Connecticut.

1869 Fire hydrant

* A fire hydrant is an active fire protection measure, and a source of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. A number of early designs of fire hydrants were produced and marketed. Numerous wooden cased fire hydrant designs existed prior to the development of the familiar cast iron hydrant. And although the development of the first above ground hydrant traces back to Philadelphia in 1803, Birdsill Holly&apos;s 1869 invention was commercially decisive and patented.

1870 Mixer (cooking)

* A hand mixer, as the name implies, is a hand-held mixing device for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It typically consists of a handle mounted over a large enclosure containing the motor, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed. In 1870, Sir Walter Scott of Providence, Rhode Island, invented the first hand-cranked egg beater. The first electric mixer was invented by Herbert Johnston in 1908 and sold by the KitchenAid division of the Hobart Manufacturing Company

1870 Pneumatic subway

* Working in secret to hide his operation from Boss Tweed, who opposes it, Scientific American publisher Alfred Ely Beach builds a pneumatic subway under Broadway in New York. Beach&apos;s single subway car, which features upholstered chairs and chandeliers is driven along the 300-foot (91 m) tunnel by a 100 horsepower (75 kW) blower.

1873 Railway air brake

* George Westinghouse was an American entrepreneur and engineer who invented the railroad air brake and was a pioneer of the electrical industry. This conveyance braking system applies the means of compressed air which modern locomotives use to this day.

1873 Jeans

* Jeans are pants, or trousers, made from denim. Mainly designed for work, they became popular among teenagers starting in the 1950s which remain as a distinct icon of American culture. In 1873, Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis invented and patented the idea (devised by Davis) of using copper rivets at the stress points of sturdy work pants. Early Levis, called&quot;waist overalls,&quot;came in a brown canvas duck fabric and a heavy blue denim fabric. The duck fabric pants were not very successful, so were dropped early on. His business became extremely successful (and still is), revolutionizing the apparel industry.

1874 Fire sprinkler

* A fire sprinkler is the part of a fire sprinkler system that discharges water when the effects of a fire have been detected, such as when a predetermined temperature has been reached. Henry S. Parmelee of New Haven, CT created and installed the first closed head fire sprinkler in 1874.

1874 QWERTY

* QWERTY is the most used modern-day keyboard layout on English-language computer and typewriter keyboards. It takes its name from the first six characters seen in the far left of the keyboard&apos;s top row of letters. The QWERTY design was patented by Christopher Sholes.

1875 Electric dental drill

* A dental drill is a small, high-speed drill used in dentistry to remove decayed tooth material prior to the insertion of a dental filling. George F. Green of Kalamazoo, Michigan invented an electric powered device to drill teeth.

1875 Mimeograph

* While using paraffin in an attempt to invent and improve telegraphy tape, Thomas Alva Edison discovers a way to make duplicate copies of documents instead.

1876 Spray gun

* An airbrush works by passing a stream of fast moving (compressed) air through a venturi, which creates a local reduction in air pressure (suction) that allows paint to be pulled up from an interconnected reservoir at normal atmospheric pressure. The high velocity of the air atomizes the paint into very tiny droplets as it blows past a very fine paint-metering component. The paint is carried onto paper or other surface. The first airbrush was invented in 1876 by Francis Edgar Stanley of Newton, Massachusetts.

1876 Telephone

* The telephone is a telecommunications device that is used to transmit and receive sound, usually two people conversing but occasionally three or more. The early history of the telephone is a confusing morass of claim and counterclaim, which was not clarified by the huge mass of lawsuits which hoped to resolve the patent claims of individuals such as Antonio Meucci and Elisha Gray, the inventor of water transmission. However, the patent of a Scots-American by the name of Alexander Graham Bell in the end was forensically victorious and commercially decisive with the United States Patent Office.

1876 Synthesizer

* The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by Elisha Gray. Gray accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self vibrating electromagnetic circuit and in doing so invented a basic single note oscillator. The Musical Telegraph used steel reeds whose oscillations were created and transmitted, over a telephone line, by electromagnets. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device in later models consisting of a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the oscillator audible.

1877 Phonograph

* Thomas Alva Edison conceived the principle of recording and reproducing sound between May and July 1877 as a byproduct of his efforts to&quot;play back&quot;recorded telegraph messages and to automate speech sounds for transmission by telephone. He announced his invention of the first phonograph on November 21, 1877, and he demonstrated the device for the first time on November 29.

1877 District heating

* District heating is a system for distributing heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements such as space heating and water heating. The U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis began steam district heating service in 1853. Although this and numerous other systems have operated over the centuries, the first commercially successful district heating system was launched in Lockport, New York, in 1877 by American hydraulic engineer Birdsill Holly, considered the founder of modern district heating.

1879 Cash register

* A cash register is a mechanical or electronic device for calculating and recording sales transactions, and an attached cash drawer for storing currency. The mechanical cash register was invented and patented in 1879 by James Ritty. Ritty was an American tavern keeper in Dayton, Ohio. He nicknamed his cash register the&quot;Incorruptible Cashier,&quot;and started the National Manufacturing Company to sell them. When a transaction was completed, a bell rang on the cash register and the amount was noted on a large dial on the front of the machine. During each sale, a paper tape was punched with holes so that the merchant could keep track of sales. John H. Patterson bought Ritty&apos;s patent and his cash register company in 1884. Patterson renamed the Dayton, Ohio, company the National Cash Register Company. Patterson improved Ritty&apos;s cash register by adding a paper tape that kept a printed record of all transactions.

1880 Hearing aid

* A hearing aid is an electroacoustic body-worn apparatus which typically fits in or behind the wearer&apos;s ear, and is designed to amplify and modulate sounds for the wearer. R.G. Rhodes improves on the ear trumpet with another primitive hearing aid. The device is a thin sheet of hard rubber or cardboard placed against teeth which conducts vibrations to the auditory nerve.

1881 Machine gun

* A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine, typically at a rate of several hundred rounds per minute. The first true machine gun was invented in 1881 by Hiram Maxim. The Maxim gun used the recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than being hand powered, enabling a much higher rate of fire than was possible using earlier designs. Maxim&apos;s other great innovation was the use of water cooling (via a water jacket around the barrel) to reduce overheating. Maxim&apos;s gun was widely adopted and derivative designs were used on all sides during the First World War. The design required less crew, was lighter, and more usable than earlier Gatling guns.

1881 Electric chair

* Xecution by electrocution is an execution method which the person being put to death is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. In 1881, Alfred Southwick witnessed an intoxicated man touch a live electric generator. After the man died quickly, Dr. Southwick concluded that electricity could be used as an alternative to hanging for executions. As Southwick was a dentist who was accustomed to performing procedures on subjects in chairs, his device for electrical execution appeared in the form of an&quot;electric chair.&quot;The first electric chair was made by Harold P. Brown and the first person to be executed via the electric chair was William Kemmler in New York&apos;s Auburn Prison on August 6, 1890;

1882 Christmas lights (electric)

* The first known electrically illuminated Christmas tree was the creation of Edward H. Johnson, an associate of inventor Thomas Edison. While he was vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company, a predecessor of today&apos;s Con Edison electric utility, he had Christmas tree light bulbs especially made for him. He proudly displayed his Christmas tree, which was hand-wired with 80 red, white and blue electric incandescent light bulbs the size of walnuts, on December 22, 1882 at his home on Fifth Avenue in New York City.

1882 Electric fan

* A mechanical fan is an electrically powered device used to produce an airflow for the purpose of creature comfort, ventilation, exhaust, or any other gaseous transport.Schuyler Skaats Wheeler invented the two-bladed desk fan, which is produced by the Crocker and Curtis electric motor company.

1882 Iron (appliance)

* An iron is a small appliance used in ironing to remove wrinkles from fabric. The electric iron was invented in 1882 by Henry Seely White, a New York inventor Seeley patented his&quot;electric flatiron&quot;on June 6, 1882 (patent no. 259,054). His iron weighed almost 15 pounds and took a long time to warm up.

1882 Fountain pen

* A fountain pen is a pen that contains a reservoir of water-based liquid ink. Lewis Waterman was an American inventor and insurance salesman who developed a relatively leak-proof fountain pen; he patented his new invention in 1884 and revolutionized writing. Before his fountain pen, pen tips had to be tipped into ink after every few words. Waterman put an ink reservoir in the pen above the pen&apos;s metal nib (point).

1885 Photographic film

* Photographic film is a sheet of plastic coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive silver halide salts with variable crystal sizes that determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. George Eastman developed the first flexible photographic film in 1885. This original&quot;film&quot;was coated on paper. The first transparent plastic film was produced in 1889. George Eastman and his company named Eastman Kodak is also credited with the invention of roll film.

1885 Fuel dispenser

* A fuel dispenser is a machine at a filling station that is used to pump gasoline, diesel, CNG, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, LH2, ethanol fuel, biofuels like biodiesel, kerosene, or other types of fuel into vehicles. Sylvanus F. Bowser of Fort Wayne, Indiana invented the first gasoline/petrol pump on September 5, 1885. Since the automobile was not invented yet, the gas pump was used for kerosene lamps and stoves. The term bowser is still often used in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

1885 Skyscraper

* A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building. After the Great Fire of 1871, Chicago has become a magnet for daring experiments in architecture. William Le Baron Jenney completes the 10-story Home Insurance Company Building, the first to use steel-girder construction; more than twenty skyscrapers will be built in Chicago over the next 9 years.

1885 Dr. Pepper

* Formulated by German pharmacist Charles Alderton in Morrison&apos;s Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Dr. Pepper was introduced nationally in the United States at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition as a new kind of cola, made with 23 flavors.

1886 Coca-Cola

* John Stith Pemberton was an American pharmacist, soldier, and inventor. He invented Coca-Cola on May 8th, 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia. He had invented many syrups, medicines, and elixirs before, including a very popular drink called French Wine of Coca, which contained French Bordeaux wine, coca leaves, and caffeine (from the kola nut). Sadly enough, Coca-Cola originally included trace amounts of powder cocaine; which gave it its name and propelled its popularity through addiction.

1886 Dishwasher

* Josephine Cochrane successfully invents the first mechanical device with the use of soap to wash cups, saucers, and dishes within built compartments.

1887 Diner

* A diner is a prefabricated restaurant characterized by a wide range of foods, a casual and often nostalgic atmosphere, a counter, and late operating hours. Lunch wagons as they were known began in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1887, by Thomas Buckley. Buckley was very successful and became known for his&quot;White House Cafe&quot;wagons. Charles Palmer received the first patent in 1891 for the diner. He built his&quot;fancy night cafes&quot;and&quot;night lunch wagons&quot;in the Worcester area until 1901.

1887 Slot machine

* A slot machine is a casino gambling machine with three or more reels which spin when a button is pushed. The first one-armed bandit was invented in 1887 by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism. Due to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card based game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic pay-out for all possible winning combinations. Charles Fey devised a machine with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.

1887 Disc record

* Thomas Edison&apos;s tube recording system produces distorted sound because of gravity&apos;s pressure on the playing stylus. Emile Berliner, a German immigrant living in Washington, DC, invents a process for recording sound on a horizontal disc. The&quot;platter&quot;record is born.

1888 Kinetoscope

* The Kinetoscope was an early motion picture exhibition device. Though not a movie projector, it was designed for films to be viewed individually through the window of a cabinet housing its components. The Kinetoscope introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. First described in conceptual terms by Thomas Edison in 1888, his idea was largely developed by one of his students between 1889 and 1892.

1888 Telautograph

* The telautograph, an analog precursor to the modern fax machine, transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers at the sending station to stepping motors attached to a pen at the receiving station, thus reproducing at the receiving station a drawing or signature made by by sender. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper. The telautograph&apos;s invention is attributed to Elisha Gray, who patented it in 1888.

1888 Drinking straw

* The drinking straw is a short tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually a drink from one location to another. Marvin Stone was the inventor of the drinking straw. The first drinking straws were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, he got a piece of paper from his factory. He wrapped it around a pencil. He coated it with wax so it would not leak or get waterlogged.

1888 Revolving door

* A revolving door typically consists of three or four doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. The revolving door was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because there is a slight vacuum caused by air flowing upwards through stairwells, elevator shafts, and chimneys. Van Kannel&apos;s new type of door was easy to open in tall building (and also saved heat in the winter). Van Kannel patented the revolving door on August 7, 1888.

1888 AC motor

* Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field force to generate torque in rotating machines. He exploited this principle in the design of a poly-phase induction motor in 1883. Introduction of Tesla&apos;s motor from 1888 onwards initiated what is sometimes referred to as the Second Industrial Revolution, making possible both the efficient generation and long distance distribution of electrical energy using the alternating current transmission system, also of Tesla&apos;s invention. Tesla would later obtain U.S. Patent 0,416,194.

1889 Paper towel

* A paper towel has almost the same purposes as conventional towels, such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, and cleaning up spills etc. They are most commonly known for being used in kitchen work. In 1889, a school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs. When Arthur Scott, head of the Scott Paper Company, heard about it he decided to try and sell a load of paper that had been made too thick to use as toilet paper.

1890 Smoke detector

* A smoke detector is a device that detects smoke and issues a signal to a fire alarm system, or issues a local audible alarm from the detector itself. The first automatic electric smoke detector was invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble.

1891 Escalator

* Jesse Reno, introduces a new novelty ride at Coney Island. His moving stairway elevates passengers on a conveyor belt at an angle of 25 degrees. The device will be shown at the Paris Exposition of 1900, where it is called the escalator.

1891 Ferris wheel

* A Ferris wheel is a non-building structure, consisting of an upright wheel with passenger gondolas attached to the rim. The Ferris wheel was invented by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bridge-builder George Washington Gale Ferris. The first Ferris wheel was opened on June 21, 1893 at the Chicago World&apos;s Fair.

1891 Radio

* Radio is the transmission of signals, by modulation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies below those of visible light. Electromagnetic radiation travels by means of oscillating electromagnetic fields that pass through the air and the vacuum of space. Information is carried by systematically changing (modulating) some property of the radiated waves, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase. Although a contending topic, Nikola Tesla is generally regarded by many, as well as the United States Supreme Court; to be the original inventor of effective radio transmissions and many of the patents concerning radio, such as; reliable radio frequencies, many of the principles of radio, and effective transmission of long-distance signals.

1892 Tractor

* A tractor is a vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. The first gasoline-powered tractor was made in 1892 by John Froelich, a blacksmith from Iowa.

1895 Volleyball

* Volleyball is an Olympic team sport in which two teams of 6 active players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points against one another by grounding a ball on the other team&apos;s court under organized rules. William G. Morgan invented a game known as Mintonnette in 1895 while studying at a YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was later re-named volleyball by Alfred S. Halstead.

1896 Zipper

* A zipper is a popular device for temporarily joining two edges of fabric. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American engineer from Chicago, Illinois, who invented the a metal zipper device with locking teeth in 1890.

1897 Cotton candy

* Cotton candy is a soft confection made from sugar that is heated and spun into slim threads that look like a mass of cotton. It was invented in 1897 by William Morrison and John C. Wharton, candy-makers from Nashville, Tennessee.

1897 Comic book

* A comic book is a magazine or book of narrative artwork and, virtually always, dialog and descriptive prose with humorous or action-oriented content. The first known proto-comic-book magazine was&quot;The Yellow Kid in McFadden&apos;s Flats&quot;, published by the G. W. Dillingham Company in 1897. It reprinted material, primarily the October 18, 1896 to January 10, 1897 sequence titled&quot;McFadden&apos;s Row of Flats&quot;from cartoonist Richard F. Outcault.

1898 Flashlight

* A flashlight is a portable electric spotlight which emits light from a small incandescent lightbulb, or from one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Invented by Joshua Lionel Cowen in New York City in 1898.

[edit] 1900s

1901 Disposable safety razor

* A safety razor is a razor where the skin is protected from all but the very edge of the blade. King Camp Gillette, former traveling hardware salesman of Fond du Lac, invents double-edged safety razor. By the end of 1904, he will have sold 90,000 razors and 12,400,000 blades, but he will die in 1932 with his dream of a utopian society organized by engineers unrealized.

1901 Assembly line production

* An assembly line is a manufacturing process in which interchangeable parts are added to a product in a sequential manner using optimally planned logistics to create a finished product much faster than with handcrafting-type methods. Primitive assembly line production was first used in 1901 by Ransom Eli Olds an early car-maker. Henry Ford used the first conveyor belt-based assembly-line in his car factory in 1913-14 in Ford&apos;s Highland Park, Michigan plant. This type of production greatly reduced the amount of time taken to put each car together (93 minutes for a Model T) from its parts, reducing production costs.

1902 Air conditioning

* Air conditioning refers to the cooling and dehumidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. Willis Carrier manufactured the world&apos;s first mechanical air conditioning unit in 1902. Carrier pioneered the design and manufacture of refrigeration machines to cool large spaces. By increasing industrial production in the summer months, air conditioning revolutionized American life. The introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped start the great migration to the Sunbelt. However, air conditioning would not catch on until after World War Two

1903 Airplane

* A fixed-wing aircraft, also known as an airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft whose lift is generated not by wing motion relative to the aircraft, but by forward motion through the air. The Wright brothers are credited with building the world&apos;s first successful human flight in a powered airplane and making the first controlled, powered, and heavier-than-air human flight on December 17, 1903. In the two years afterward, they developed their flying machine into the world&apos;s first practical fixed-wing aircraft. The brothers&apos; fundamental breakthrough was their invention of&quot;three axis-control,&quot;which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. This method has become standard on fixed wing aircraft of all kinds. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on unlocking the secrets of control to conquer&quot;the flying problem,&quot;rather than on developing more powerful engines as some other experimenters did. Charles Edward Taylor built the first aircraft engine and was a vital contributor of mechanical aspects in the building and maintaining of early Wright engines and airplanes. The Wright brothers are officially credited worldwide through the Fdration Aronautique Internationale, the standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as achieving&quot;the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight&quot;.

1903 Teddy bear

* The teddy bear is a stuffed toy bear. It is an enduring, traditional form of a stuffed animal, often serving the purpose of comforting children. The name Teddy Bear comes from a 1902 hunting trip to Mississippi by President Theodore Roosevelt. A suite of Roosevelt&apos;s attendants, led by Holt Collier, cornered, clubbed, and tied to a willow tree an American Black Bear after a long exhausting chase with hounds. They called Roosevelt to the site and suggested that he should shoot it. He refused to shoot the bear himself, deeming this unsportsmanlike, but instructed that the bear be killed to put it out of its misery. The story became the topic of a political cartoon by Clifford Berryman in The Washington Post on November 16, 1902. Morris Michtom saw the drawing of Roosevelt and the bear cub in the newspaper and was inspired to create a new toy. He created a little stuffed bear cub and put it in his shop window with a sign that read&quot;Teddy&apos;s bear,&quot;after sending the bear to Roosevelt and receiving permission to sell the bears. The toys were an immediate success and Michtom founded the Ideal Toy Company, which still exists today.

1903 Tea bag

* A tea bag is a small, porous paper, silk or nylon sealed bag containing tea leaves for brewing tea. Tea bags were invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1903. The first bags were made from silk. Sullivan was a tea and coffee merchant in New York who began packaging tea samples in tiny silk bags, but many customers brewed the tea in them.

1903 Crayons

* A crayon is a stick of colored wax, charcoal, chalk, or other materials used for writing and drawing. Crayons were invented by Edwin Binney and Harold Smith, who owned a paint company in New York City, New York. Binney and Smith invented the modern-day crayon by combining paraffin wax with pigments. These inexpensive art supplies were an instant success since they were first marketed as Crayola crayons in 1903.

1904 Continuous track

* Continuous tracks are large (modular) tracks used on tanks, construction equipment, and certain other off-road vehicles. Most continuous tracks are made of a number of rigid units that are joined to each other. The tracks help the vehicle to distribute its weight more evenly over a larger surface area than wheels can. Benjamin Holt patented the continuous track on December 7 1907, having first invented it on November 24 1904.

1904 Monopoly board game

* Monopoly is a board game where players compete to acquire wealth through stylized economic activity involving the buying, renting, and trading of properties using play money, as players take turns moving around the board according to the roll of the dice. Created in 1904 by a Quaker woman named Elizabeth Magie, the world&apos;s most famous board game played by over 500 million people was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow.

1905 Fly swatter

* A flyswatter is a hand-held device for swatting flies and other insects. Samuel Crumbine, a member of the Kansas board of health, wanted to raise public awareness of the threat of flies. He was inspired by a chant at a Topeka softball game:&quot;swat the ball&quot;. In a health bulletin published soon afterwards, he exhorted Kansans to&quot;swat the fly&quot;. In response, a schoolteacher named Frank H. Rose created the&quot;fly bat&quot;, a device consisting of a yardstick attached to a piece of screen. Crumbine invented the device now commonly known as the fly swatter.

1905 Windshield wipers

* A windshield wiper is a device used to wipe rain and dirt from a windscreen. The windshield wiper was invented by Mary Anderson in 1903 to help streetcars operate safely in the rain. In 1905 she patented her invention, which allowed the car operator to control the external, swinging arm wipers from within the car.

1905 Ice pop

* An ice pop is a frozen water-based dessert on a stick. It is made by freezing a colored, flavored liquid around a stick. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. The ice pop was invented by 11-year old Frank Epperson in 1905. Living in San Francisco, California, Epperson had left a fruit drink out overnight, with a stirrer in it, thus making it freeze. In 1923, Epperson got a patent on his&quot;frozen ice on a stick&quot;many years later. Epperson also invented the twin ice pop, two sticks so it could be shared by two children. The most famous brand name associated with the ice pop is Popsicle, a trademark owned by Unilever.

1908 Electric washing machine

* A washing machine, or washer, is a machine designed to clean laundry, such as clothing, towels and sheets. Although Alva J. Fisher for many years was generally thought to have invented the electric washing machine, it&apos;s real inventor was Louis Goldenberg of New Brunswick, New Jersey who pioneered this new and modern convenience in the late 1880&apos;s to early 1890&apos;s. The electric washing machine would not be first mass-produced until 1908.

1909 Paper shredder

* Paper shredders are used to cut paper into chad, typically either strips or fine particles. Government organizations, businesses, and private individuals use shredders to destroy private, confidential, or otherwise sensitive documents. The first paper shredder is credited to prolific inventor Abbot Augustus Low of Horseshoe, New York. His patent for a waste paper receptacle to offer an improved method of disposing of waste paper received a U.S. patent on August 31, 1909.

1911 Self starter

* An automobile self-starter is an electric motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself.Charles F. Kettering, who developed the electric cash register while working at National Cash Register, sells his electric automobile starters to the Cadillac company. This device increases the popularity of the gasoline-powered car, which no longer needs to be started with a hand crank.

1911 Road surface marking

* Edward N. Hines originated the concept of painting a line down the center of a road to separate traffic in opposing directions. Painted center lines were first used in Wayne County in 1911. This simple idea has since been recognized as one of the most important single traffic safety devices in the history of highway transportation around the world.

1912 Fast food restaurant

* A fast food restaurant, sometimes known as a quick service restaurant or QSR, is a specific type of restaurant characterized both by its fast food cuisine and by minimal table service. Food served in fast food restaurants typically caters to a&quot;meat-sweet diet&quot;and is offered from a limited menu. Cooked in bulk and kept hot, it is finished and packaged to order, usually available ready to take away, though seating may be provided. The history of fast food can be traced to New York City on July 7, 1912 with the opening of a fast food restaurant by Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart called the Automat.

1912 Traffic light (electric)

* The traffic light, also known as traffic signal, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location. Its purpose is to indicate, using a series of colors, the correct moment to stop, drive, ride or walk, using a universal color code. In Salt Lake City, Utah, policeman Lester Wire invented the first red-green electric traffic lights. The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go are likely derived from those used to identify port (red) and starboard (green) in maritime rules governing right of way, where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right.

1914 Regenerative circuit

* The regenerative circuit allows an electronic signal to be amplified many times by the same vacuum tube or other active component such as a field effect transistor. A regenerative circuit is often an AM detector, converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform. Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver. Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels. Edwin Armstrong, invented and patented the regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college, in 1914. He patented the super-regenerative circuit in 1922, and the superheterodyne receiver in 1918.

1915 Single-sideband modulation

* Single-sideband modulation (SSB) is a refinement of amplitude modulation that more efficiently uses electrical power and bandwidth. Single-sideband modulation produces a modulated output signal that has twice the bandwidth of the original baseband signal. Although John Renshaw Carson invented SBB in 1915, his patent was not granted until March 27, 1923.

1915 Gas mask

* A gas mask is a mask worn over the face to protect the wearer from inhaling&quot;airborne pollutants&quot;and toxic gasses. The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. In 1915, American chemist and inventor James Bert Garner read a newspaper article describing a gas attack on British forces which he hypothesized had employed chlorine gas. Remembering experiments he had performed while teaching at the University of Chicago, he set about creating the first gas mask which he tested on two of his associates in a gas filled chamber. Following the successful completion of the test, he provided the results to the British government. Garner&apos;s mask was the first to be used on the Western front during World War I.

1916 Supermarket

* A supermarket is a self-service store offering a wide variety of food and household merchandise, organized into departments. It is larger in size and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store. The concept of a self-service grocery store was developed by American entrepreneur Clarence Saunders and his Piggly Wiggly stores. His first store opened in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1916.

1920 Polygraph

* A polygraph (popularly referred to as a lie detector) is an instrument that measures and records several physiological responses such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration breathing rhythms body temperature and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions, on the theory that false answers will produce distinctive measurements. This device recording both blood-pressure and galvanic skin response was invented in 1920 by Dr. John A. Larson of the University of California and first applied in law enforcement work by the Berkeley Police Department. In 1935, further work on this device was done by Leonarde Keeler.

1921 Wirephoto

* Wirephoto or telephotography is the sending of pictures by telegraph or telephone. The first electronically-transmitted photograph is sent by Western Union. The idea for a facsimile transmission was first proposed by Scottish clockmaker Alexander Bain in 1843.

1921 BAND-AID

* Bandages for wounds had been around since ancient times, but an easy-to-use dressing with an adhesive was invented by Earle Dickson (a cotton buyer at the Johnson&amp;Johnson company). Dickson perfected the BAND-AID in 1920, making a small, sterile adhesive bandage for home use. Dickson invented the BAND-AID for his wife, who had many kitchen accidents and needed an easy-to-use wound dressing. Dickson was rewarded by the Johnson&amp;Johnson company by being made a vice-president of the company.

1923 Bulldozer

* A bulldozer is a crawler (continuous tracked tractor), equipped with a substantial metal plate or blade, used to push large quantities of soil, sand, or rubble during construction work. In 1923, a young farmer named James Cummings and a draftsman named J. Earl McLeod made the first designs. A replica is on display at the city park in Morrowville, Kansas where the two built the first bulldozer.

1923 Masking tape

* Masking tape is a type of pressure sensitive tape made with an easy-to-tear thin paper, and fly back and a removable pressure sensitive adhesive. Richard G. Drew&apos;s, an employee of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), first first tape invention was a masking tape made for painters in 1923 (this tape was designed to help painters paint a straight border between two colors). This early masking tape was a wide paper tape with adhesive on only the edges of the tape - not in the middle.

1923 Cotton swab

* Cotton swabs consist of a small wad of cotton wrapped around either one or both ends of a small rod, usually made of either wood, rolled paper, or plastic. They are commonly used in a variety of applications including first aid, cosmetics application, for cleaning, and arts&amp;crafts. The cotton swab was invented by Leo Gerstenzang in the 1923, who invented the product after attaching wads of cotton to toothpick. His product, which he named&quot;Baby Gays&quot;, went on to become the most widely-sold brand name,&quot;Q-tip&quot;.

1924 Gas chamber execution

* A gas chamber is an apparatus for killing, consisting of a sealed chamber into which a poisonous or asphyxiant gas is introduced. The most commonly used poisonous agent is hydrogen cyanide; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide have also been used. In an effort to make capital punishment more humane, the State of Nevada introduces death by gas chamber. Convicted murderer John Gee takes 6 minutes to die.

1925 Battery eliminator

* A battery eliminator is a device powered by an electrical source other than a battery, which then converts the source to a suitable DC voltage that may be used by a second device designed to be powered by batteries. Early commercial battery eliminators were produced by Edward S. Rogers, Sr. company in 1925, as a complement to his line of&quot;batteryless&quot;radio receivers.

1926 Liquid-fuel rocket

* A liquid-fuel rocket is a rocket with an engine that uses propellants in liquid form. On March 16, 1926 at Auburn, Massachusetts, Professor Robert H. Goddard, the&quot;father of modern rocketry,&quot;launched the first liquid fueled rocket in history, which used liquid oxygen and gasoline as propellants. A maximum altitude of just 41 feet was achieved during a short 2.5 seconds of flight, but it was an important demonstration that liquid-fueled rockets were possible.

1927 Bread slicer

* Sliced bread is a loaf of bread which has been pre-sliced and packaged for commercial convenience. The automatic commercial bread slicer was invented in 1927 by Otto Frederick Rohwedder. His machine both sliced and wrapped a loaf of bread. In 1928, the bread slicer was improved by Gustav Papendick, a baker from St. Louis, Missouri.

1927 Jukebox

* A jukebox is a partially automated music-playing device, usually a coin-operated machine, that can play specially selected songs from self-contained media. The traditional jukebox is rather large with a rounded top and has colored lighting on the front of the machine on its vertical sides. The classic jukebox has buttons with letters and numbers on them that, when combined, are used to indicate a specific song from a particular record. Rowe International builds and introduces the first A.M.I. (automated musical instrument) which later became known as the jukebox during the 1930&apos;s.

1927 Kool-Aid

* Kool-Aid is a brand of artificially-flavored drink mix. Its predecessor was a liquid concentrate called Fruit Smack. To reduce shipping costs, in 1927, Edwin Perkins discovered a way to remove the liquid from Fruit Smack, leaving only a dry powder.

1928 Recliner

* A recliner is an armchair that reclines when the occupant lowers the chair&apos;s back and raises its front. It has a backrest that can be tilted back, causing a footrest to extend from the front. Edward Knabusch and Edwin Shoemaker created the first recliner in Monroe, Michigan in 1928 when they modified a wooden porch chair so that the seat moved forward as the back reclined. A padded model was later developed.

1928 Drive through

* A drive-through, or drive-thru, is a type of service provided by a business that allows customers to purchase products without leaving their cars. In 1928, City Center Bank, which became UMB Financial Corporation, president R. Crosby Kemper opened what is considered the first drive-up window. In-n-Out Burger claims to have built the first drive-through restaurant in 1948. Harry and Esther Snyder, the chain&apos;s founders, built their first restaurant in Baldwin Park, California, with a two-way speaker to enable patrons to order directly from their cars without the intermediation of a carhop.

1928 Ice cube tray

* An ice cube tray is a plastic, rubber or metal tray divided into compartments. It is designed to be filled with water, then placed in a freezer until the water freezes to ice, producing ice cubes. The first rubber ice cube tray was invented by Lloyd Groff Copeman. One day in 1928, while walking through some woods collecting sap for maple syrup, Copeman noticed that slush and ice flaked off his rubber boots easily, rather than adhering to them. Having recalled this incident over lunch with his patent attorney, he conducted experiments using rubber cups, and later set about designing and then patenting different types of tray: a metal tray with rubber separators, a metal tray with individual rubber cups, and a tray made completely of rubber.

1928 Bubble gum

* Bubblegum is a type of chewing gum especially designed for blowing bubbles. Bubblegum was invented by Frank Henry Fleer in 1906, but was not successful; the formulation of Fleer&apos;s&quot;Blibber-Blubber,&quot;was too sticky. In 1928, Walter E. Diemer invented a superior formulation for bubble gum, which he called&quot;Double Bubble.&quot;

1928 Iron lung

* An iron lung is a large machine that enables a person to breathe when normal muscle control has been lost or the work of breathing exceeds the person&apos;s ability. It is a form of medical ventilator. Louis Agassiz Shaw and Philip Drinker invented the iron lung working at Harvard University in 1928.

1929 Air traffic control

* Air traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and in the air. The primary purpose of ATC systems worldwide is to separate aircraft to prevent collisions, to organize and expedite the flow of traffic, and to provide information and other support for pilots when able. Archie League, who controlled aircraft using colored flags at what is today Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, is often considered the first air traffic controller.

1929 Tampon (applicator)

* A tampon is a mass of cotton or rayon; or a mixture of the two inserted into a body cavity or wound to absorb bodily fluid. The most common type in daily use is disposable and designed to be inserted into the vagina during menstruation to absorb the flow of blood. The applicator tampon with removal cord was invented in 1929 and submitted for patent in 1931 by Dr. Earle Haas, an American from Denver, Colorado. Dr. Hass later sold the patent of the applicator tampon to Gertrude Tendrich, who founded the Tampax Company for the mass production of the lengthways expanding tampon.

1929 Sunglasses

* Sunglasses or sun glasses are a visual aid, variously termed spectacles or glasses, which feature lenses that are coloured or darkened to prevent strong light from reaching the eyes. Sam Foster mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.

1929 Frozen food

* Frozen food is food preserved by the process of freezing. Freezing food is a common method of food preservation which slows both food decay and, by turning water to ice, makes it unavailable for most bacterial growth and slows down most chemical reactions. Clarence Birdseye offers his quick-frozen foods to the public. Birdseye got the idea during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use freezing to preserve foods.

1929 Particle accelerator

* A particle accelerator is a device that uses electric fields to propel electrically-charged particles to high speeds and to contain them. The earliest particle accelerators were cyclotrons, invented in 1929 by Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley.

1930 Car audio

* Car audio/video (car AV) is a term used to describe the sound or video system fitted in an automobile. In 1930, the Galvin Corporation introduced one of the first commercial car radios, the Motorola model 5T71, which sold for between $110 and $130 and could be installed in most popular automobiles. Founders Paul Galvin and Joe Galvin came up with the name &apos;Motorola&apos; when his company started manufacturing car radios.

1930 Discovery of Pluto

* Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century but culminated at the start of the 20th century with a quest for Planet X. Percival Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the gas giants, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities. The discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 initially appeared to validate Lowell&apos;s hypothesis, and Pluto was considered the ninth planet until 2006.

1930 Pressure sensitive tape

* Pressure sensitive tape, PSA tape, Adhesive tape, Self stick tape, Sticky tape consists of a pressure sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material such as paper, plastic film, cloth, or metal foil. Richard G. Drew&apos;s invention was a clear cellulose tape called Scotch (TM) Brand Cellulose Tape. This tape was a clear, all-purpose adhesive tape that was soon adopted worldwide. The first tape dispenser with a built-in cutting edge was invented in 1932 by John A. Borden, another 3M employee.

1930 Runway lighting

* Runway lighting is used at airports which allow night landings. Seen from the air, runway lights form an outline of the runway. The first runway lighting appeared in 1930 at Cleveland Municipal Airport, now known as Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Cleveland, Ohio.

1930 Bathysphere

* A bathysphere is a pressurized metal sphere that allows people to go deep in the ocean, to depths at which diving unaided is impossible. This hollow cast iron sphere with very thick walls is lowered and raised from a ship using a steel cable. The bathysphere was invented by William Beebe and Otis Barton (around 1930). William Beebe, an American naturalist and undersea explorer, tested the bathysphere in 1930, going down to 1,426 feet (435 m) in a 4&apos;9&quot;(1.45 m) diameter bathysphere. Beebe and Otis Barton descended about 3,000 ft (914 m) feet in a larger bathysphere in 1934. They descended off the coast of Nonsuch Island, Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean. During the dive, they communicated with the surface via telephone.

1930 Chocolate chip cookie

* A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie which features chocolate chips as its distinguishing ingredient. The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Ruth Wakefield invented chocolate chips (and chocolate chip cookies) in 1930. Wakefield ran the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts. Her new cookie invention was called the&quot;Toll House Cookie.&quot;Her original cookies used broken-up bars of semi-sweet chocolate.

1931 Radio astronomy

* Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects at radio frequencies. While trying to track down a source of electrical interference on telephone transmissions, Karl Guthe Jansky of Bell Telephone Laboratories discovers radio waves emanating from stars in outer space.

1933 Frequency modulation

* In telecommunications, frequency modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency. While working in the basement laboratory of Columbia&apos;s Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong created wide-band frequency modulation radio. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong&apos;s method varied the frequency of the wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.

1934 Trampoline (modern)

* A trampoline is a gymnastic and recreational device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels the jumper high into the air. In a trampoline, the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which connect it to the frame. The modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934.

1935 Franchising

* Franchising refers to the methods of practicing and using another person&apos;s philosophy of business. In 1935, Howard Deering Johnson teamed up with Reginald Sprague to establish the first modern restaurant franchise. The idea was to let independent operators use the same name, food, supplies, logo and even building design in exchange for a fee.

1935 Parking meter

* A parking meter is a device used to collect money in exchange for the right to park a vehicle in a particular place for a limited amount of time. The parking meter was invented by Carl C. Magee of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA. The first parking meter was installed in Oklahoma City. Magee holds a patent for a&quot;coin controlled parking meter,&quot;filed on May 13, 1935 and issued on May 24, 1938.

1935 pH meter

* A pH meter is an electronic instrument used to measure the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of a liquid. In 1935, Arnold Orville Beckman invented the pH meter.

1936 Stock car racing

* Stock car racing is a form of automobile racing. The races are run on oval rings of approximately one quarter-mile to 2.66 miles (about 0.4 to 4.2 kilometres) length, but are also raced on road courses. Shorter ovals are called short tracks; unpaved short tracks are called dirt tracks; longer ovals are known as superspeedways. On March 8, 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Road Course, promoted by local racer Sig Haugdahl. The race was 78 laps long (250 miles) for street-legal family sedans sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (AAA) for cars built in 1935 and 1936. The city posted a $5000 purse with $1700 for the winner. In 1948, stock car racing became a regulated sport when Bill France, Sr. created NASCAR.

1936 Programming languages

* A programming language is a machine-readable artificial language designed to express computations that can be performed by a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that specify the behavior of a machine, to express algorithms precisely, or as a mode of human communication. The first programming languages predate the modern computer. In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also written asλ-calculus, is a formal system designed to investigate function definition, function application and recursion. It was developed by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics, but has emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability or recursion theory, and forms the basis of a paradigm of modern computer programming such as C, C++, Java, HTML, and SMTP.

1936 Chair lift

* A chair lift is a type of aerial lift, which consists of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas (in such cases referred to as &apos;skilifts&apos;), but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly, in urban transport. James Curran built a chair lift for the Dollar Mountain resort in Sun Valley, Idaho. Dollar Mountain followed with an order for six more.

1937 Shopping cart

* A shopping cart is a metal or plastic basket on wheels supplied by a shop, especially a supermarket, for use by customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the check-out counter during shopping, and often to the customer&apos;s car after paying as well. Often, customers are allowed to leave the carts in the parking lot, and store personnel return the carts to the shop. The first shopping cart was introduced on June 4, 1937, by Sylvan Goldman, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma City.

1937 Xerography

* Xerography (which means&quot;dry writing&quot;in Greek) is a process of making copies that was invented in 1938 by Chester Floyd Carlson. Xerography makes copies without using ink (hence its name). In this process, static electricity charges a lighted plate; a plastic powder (called toner) is applied to the areas of the page to remain white. Carlson marketed his revolutionary device to about 20 companies before he could interest any. The Haloid Company (later called the Xerox Corporation) marketed it, and photocopying eventually became common and inexpensive.

1938 Fiberglass

* The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia; however, the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. The first commercial production of fiberglass was in 1936. In 1938, fiberglass was invented by Russell Games Slayter of Owens-Corning.

1938 Nylon

* A team of researchers working under Wallace H. Carothers at E.I. du Pont de Nemours&amp;Company invents a plastic that can be drawn into strong, silk-like fibers. Nylon will soon become popular as a fabric for hosiery as well as industrial applications such as cordage.

1938 Scrabble

* Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by forming words from individual lettered tiles on a game board marked with a 15-by-15 grid. The words are formed across and down in crossword fashion and must appear in a standard dictionary. Scrabble was developed by Alfred Mosher Butts in 1938, but James Brunot did some rearranging of the squares and simplified the rules. Since Brunot marketed the game, a copyright was granted to him on December 1, 1948. After about 4 years of paltry sales, Scrabble became a hit.

1940 Astatine

* Astatine is a radioactive chemical element that was first produced by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio Segr at the University of California, Berkeley. It is the heaviest of the discovered halogens.

1940 Neptunium

* A radioactive chemical element, neptunium is the first transuranic element and belongs to the actinide series. It was first produced by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in the year 1940 in Berkeley, California.

1941 Deodorant

* Deodorants are substances applied to the body, particularly the armpits, mainly to reduce body odor caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration. Jules Montenier holds a number of patents. Arguably, his January 28, 1941 patent for Astringent Preparation is his most famous. This patent dealt with solving the problem of the excessive acidity of aluminum chloride, then and now the best working antiperspirant, by adding a soluble nitrile or a similar compound. This innovation found its way into&quot;Stopette&quot;deodorant spray, which Time Magazine called&quot;the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950&apos;s&quot;.

1942 Defibrillator

* Defibrillation is the definitive treatment for the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the affected heart. Dr. Claude Beck developed the defibrillator in 1942.

1944 Curium

* A radioactive, metallic, transuranic element of the actinide series, curium is produced by bombarding plutonium with alpha particles. It was first synthesized at the University of California, Berkeley by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso in 1944.

1944 Americium

* A radioactive metallic element, americium is an actinide that was obtained in 1944 by bombarding plutonium with neutrons. It was the fourth transuranic element to be discovered. It was named for the Americas, by analogy with europium. Americium is widely used in commercial ionization-chamber smoke detectors as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. It was first isolated by Glenn T. Seaborg, Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso at the Argonne National Laboratory.

1945 Slinky

* A Slinky is a coil-shaped toy which can&quot;walk&quot;down stairs as the coils stretch and reform as gravity moves them down each step. The spring&apos;s momentum causes it to spill end over end from one step to the next. In 1943, Richard James was trying to develop a means for suspending sensitive shipboard instruments aboard naval vessels, even in rough seas. He was working with tension springs, when he accidentally dropped one. Seeing how the spring kept moving after it hit the ground, an idea for a toy was born. With a $500 loan, Richard James developed a coil winding machine and started the James Spring&amp;Wire Company to mass-produce the Slinky. The name for the toy was coined by Betty James. Slinky was successfully demonstrated at Gimbel&apos;s Department Store in Philadelphia during the 1945 Christmas season and then at the 1946 American Toy Fair. It became a huge success, with around 300 million Slinkies purchased since then.

1945 Microwave oven

* A microwave oven is a kitchen appliance that cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. This is accomplished by using microwave radiation to heat water and other polarized molecules within the food. Cooking food with microwaves was discovered by Percy Spencer on October 8, 1945, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. He was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg (which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters).

1946 Flying disc

* A Flying disc is a disc-shaped to which is generally plastic and roughly 20 to 25 centimeters (810 inches) in diameter, with a lip. The shape of the disc, an airfoil in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air while rotating. Walter Frederick Morrison claims that it was a popcorn can lid that he tossed with his girlfriend (and later wife) Lu at a 1937 Thanksgiving Day gathering in Los Angeles that inspired his interest in developing a commercially-produced flying disc. In 1946, he sketched out plans for a disc he called the Whirlo-Way, which, co-developed and financed by Warren Franscioni in 1948, became the very first commercially produced plastic flying disc, marketed under the name Pipco Flyin-Saucer. The name Frisbee is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, but is often used generically to describe all flying discs.

1947 Correction fluid

* Correction fluid is an opaque, white fluid applied to paper to mask errors in text. It was very important when material was typed with a typewriter, but has become less so since the advent of the word processor. It was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951 and originally called by the brand name Mistake Out.

1947 Mobile phone

* A mobile phone, also known as a cell phone, is a long-range, electronic device used for mobile voice or data communication over a network of specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones had been in use in since 1946, but since the number of radio frequencies are very limited in any area, the number of phone calls was also very limited. Only a dozen or two calls could be made at the same time in an area. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas (called cells) which share the same frequencies. But when users moved from one area to another while calling, the call would have to be switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. This cellular phone concept was devised by a team of researchers at Bell Labs in 1947, but there were no computers available to do the switching. As small inexpensive computers were developed, cell phones could be produced. Known as the&quot;father of the cell phone,&quot;Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone, being operational in 1973 when the first call was made to Joel S. Engel.

1947 Instant camera

* The instant camera is a type of camera with self-developing film. In 1947, Edwin H. Land introduces a new camera that can produce a developed photographic image in sixty seconds. A colored photograph model will follow in the 1960s and will eventually receive more than 500 patents for his innovations in light and plastics technologies.

1947 Sound barrier-breaking aircraft

* In aerodynamics, the sound barrier usually refers to the point at which an aircraft moves from transonic to supersonic speed. On October 14, 1947, just under a month after the United States Air Force had been created as a separate service, tests culminated in the first manned supersonic flight where the sound barrier was broken, piloted by Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager in the Bell X-1. The rocket-powered aircraft was launched from the bomb bay of a specially modified B-29 and glided to a landing on a runway.

1948 Hair spray

* Hair spray is a beauty aqueous solution that is used to keep hair stiff or in a certain style. Weaker than hair gel, hair wax, or glue, it is sprayed to hold styles for a long period. Using a pump or aerosol spray nozzle, it sprays evenly over the hair. Hair spray was first developed and manufactured in 1948 by Chase Products Company, based in Broadview, Illinois.

1948 Cat litter

* Cat litter is one of any of a number of materials used in litter boxes to absorb moisture from cat feces and urine, which reduces foul odors such as ammonia and renders them more tolerable within the home. One of the first commercially available cat litters was Kitty Litter, available in 1948 and marketed by Ed Lowe. This was the first large scale use of clay in litter boxes; previously sand was used.

1948 Video game

* A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device. The patent for a Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device was first filed on January 25, 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and was issued on December 14, 1948. Eight vacuum tubes were used to simulate a missile firing at a target, and the device featured knobs to adjust the curve and speed of the missile.

1949 Berkelium

* Berkelium is a radioactive metallic element in the actinide series which was first synthesized by bombarding americium with [[alpha particles] (helium ions). Berkelium was the fifth transuranic element to be synthesized by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr. at the University of California, Berkeley in December 1949.

1949 Radiocarbon dating

* Radiocarbon dating is a radiometric dating method that uses the naturally occurring radioisotope carbon-14 (14C) to determine the age of carbonaceous materials up to about 60,000 years. In 1949, Willard F. Libby invented the procedure for carbon-14 dating.

1949 Ice resurfacer

* An ice resurfacer is a truck-like vehicle used to clean and smooth the surface of an ice rink. Frank J. Zamboni invented the first ice resurfacer, which he called a Zamboni, in 1949 in Paramount, California.

1950 Californium

* Californium is a radioactive transuranic element which can be used to start nuclear reactors, optimize coal-fired power plants, cement production facilities (via online analyzers), facilitate medical treatment of cancer, and support oil exploration via down hole well logging. It was first produced by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium ions). Californium was the sixth transuranic element to be synthesized at the University of California, Berkeley by researchers Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street, Jr., Albert Ghiorso and Glenn T. Seaborg in 1950.

1950 Credit card

* A credit card is part of a system of payments named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. The issuer of the card grants a line of credit to the consumer from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user. The concept of paying different merchants using the same card was invented in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and Frank X. McNamara, founders of Diners Club, to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first&quot;general purpose&quot;charge card, and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement.

1950 Disposable diaper

* A diaper or nappy is a sponge like garment which people wear who are incapable of controlling their bladder or bowel movements, or are unable or unwilling to use a toilet. The disposable diaper was invented in 1950 by Marion Donovan. Her first leak-proof diaper was a plastic-lined cloth diaper. Donovan then developed a disposable diaper. She was unsuccessful at selling her invention to established manufacturers, so she started her own company.

1950 Sengstaken-Blakemore tube

* A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is an oro- or nasogastric tube used occasionally in the management of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to bleeding from esophageal varices (distended veins in the esophageal wall, usually as a result of cirrhosis). It was invented by Dr. Robert W. Sengstaken and Dr. Arthur H. Blakemore in 1950.

1951 Golf cart

* A golf cart or golf buggy is a small vehicle designed originally to carry two golfers and their golf clubs around a golf course with less effort than the traditional method of walking. The golf cart was introduced by Merle Williams of Long Beach, California.

1952 Einsteinium

* Einsteinium is a metallic synthetic element. It is the seventh transuranic element, and seventh in the series of actinoids. Named in honor of Albert Einstein, einsteinium was first discovered by Albert Ghiorso along with co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley.

1952 Fermium

* As a highly radioactive, metallic, transuranic element of the actinide series, fermium is made by bombarding plutonium with neutrons. Named after nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi, fermium is the eighth transuranic element that was first discovered by a team led by Albert Ghiorso in 1952.

1952 Barcode

* A barcode is an optical machine-readable representation of data. Norman Joseph Woodland is best known for developing the barcode for which he received a patent in October 1952. The first Universal Product Code, invented by George Laurer at IBM, was the first marked item ever scanned at a retail checkout (Marsh&apos;s supermarket in Troy, Ohio) was at 8:01 a.m. on June 26, 1974, and was a 10-pack of Wrigley&apos;s Juicy Fruit chewing gum.

1953 DNA structure

* In 1953, based on X-ray diffraction images and the information that the bases were paired, James D. Watson suggested what is now accepted as the first accurate model of DNA structure in the journal Nature.

1953 Heart-lung machine

* Dr. John H. Gibbon performs the first successful open heart surgery in which the blood is artificially circulated and oxygenated by a heart-lung machine. This new technology, which allows the surgeon to operate on a dry and motionless heart, greatly increases surgical treatment options for heart defects and disease.

1953 Apgar scale

* The Apgar scale is a standardized scale that is used to determine the physical status of an infant at birth. This simple, easy-to-perform test was devised in 1953 by Dr. Virginia Apgar, a professor of anesthesia at the New York Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The Apgar scale is administered to a newborn at one minute after birth and five minutes after birth. It scores the baby&apos;s heart rate, respiration, muscle tone, reflex response, and color. This test quickly alerts medical personnel that the newborn needs assistance.

1953 MASER

* A maser is a device that produces coherent electromagnetic waves through amplification due to stimulated emission. Historically the term came from the acronym&quot;Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation&quot;. Charles H. Townes, J. P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger built the first maser at Columbia University in 1953.

1953 TV dinner

* A TV dinner (also called frozen dinner, microwave meal, or ready meal) is a prepackaged, frozen or chilled meal which usually comes in an individual package. It requires very little preparation, oven baked or microwaveable, and contains all the elements for a single-serving meal in an aluminum or plastic tray with compartments for the food. Carl A. Swanson of C.A. Swanson&amp;Sons is generally credited for inventing the TV dinner. However, retired Swanson executive Gerry Thomas said he conceived the idea after the company found itself with a huge surplus of frozen turkeys because of poor Thanksgiving sales. In 1953, a Swanson TV dinner cost 98 cents.

1954 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

* Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an important life saving first aid skill, practiced throughout the world. It is the only known effective method of keeping someone who has suffered cardiac arrest alive long enough for definitive treatment to be delivered. In 1954, James Elam was the first to demonstrate experimentally that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was a sound technique, and together with Dr. Peter Safar he demonstrated its superiority to previous methods.

1954 Radar gun

* A radar gun or speed gun is a small Doppler radar used to detect the speed of objects. A radar gun does not return information regarding the object&apos;s position or any information concerning the car e.g. Registration etc. It relies on the Doppler Effect applied to a radar beam to measure the speed of objects at which it is pointed. Radar guns may be hand-held or vehicle-mounted. They can be used as a tool in the regulation of traffic speed by law enforcement and also to measure speeds in sports. Bryce K. Brown created the radar gun in March 1954.

1955 Crosby-Kugler capsule

* A Crosby-Kulger capsule is a device used for obtaining biopsies of small bowel mucosa, necessary for the diagnosis of various small bowel diseases. It was invented by Dr. William Holmes Crosby, Jr. in 1955.

1955 Mendelevium

* As a metallic radioactive transuranic element of the actinides, mendelevium is synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles and was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, who was responsible for the Periodic Table. Mendelevium was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Bernard Harvey, Greg Choppin, and Stanley G. Thompson in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley.

1955 Nuclear submarine

* The Nautilus, the first nuclear submarine, revolutionizes naval warfare. Conventional submarines need two engines: a diesel engine to travel on the surface and an electric engine to travel submerged, where oxygen for a diesel engine is not available. The Nautilus, the first nuclear sub, can travel many thousands of miles below the surface with a single fuel charge. Hyman Rickover can be credited for the development of the world&apos;s first nuclear submarine.

1956 Videotape

* Videotape is a means of recording images and sound onto magnetic tape as opposed to movie film. The first practical professional videotape machines were the Quadruplex machines introduced by Ampex on April 14, 1956. Invented by Charles Ginsburg and Ray Dolby, Quad employed a transverse (scanning the tape across its width) four-head system on a two-inch (5.08 cm) tape, and linear heads for the soundtrack.

1957 Polio vaccine

* Dr. Jonas Salk develops a polio vaccine using strains of polio too weak to cause infection but strong enough to activate the human immune system.

1959 Integrated circuit

* An integrated circuit is a miniaturized electronic circuit that has been manufactured in the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material. Integrated circuits are used in almost all electronic equipment in use today and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments filed a patent for a&quot;Solid Circuit&quot;made of germanium on February 6, 1959. The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip was an enormous improvement over the manual assembly of circuits using discrete electronic components.

1960 Satellite navigation system

* Satellite navigation systems provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude) to within a few meters using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. Receivers on the ground with a fixed position can also be used to calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments. The first such system was Transit (satellite), developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for the U.S. Navy. Development of the system began in 1958, and a prototype satellite, Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960 by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The Global Positioning System, launched in 1993, is the predecessor to Transit.

1960 Combined oral contraceptive pill

* The Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill, often referred to as the birth-control pill, or simply&quot;the Pill&quot;, is a combination of an estrogen and a progestin taken by mouth to inhibit normal female fertility. On May 9, 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10 mg for contraceptive use. By time Enovid 10 mg had been in general use for three years, at least half a million women had used it. Edris Rice-Wray invented the combined oral contraceptive pill.

1960 Laser

* Working at Hughes Research Laboratories, physicist Theodore H. Maiman creates the first laser. The core of his laser consists of a man-made ruby -- a material that had been judged unsuitable by other scientists, who rejected crystal cores in favor of various gases.

1961 Lawrencium

* Lawrencium is radioactive synthetic element created by Albert Ghiorso, Torbjrn Sikkeland, Almon Larsh, and Robert M. Latimer on February 14, 1961 at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, now known as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.

1962 Jet injector

* A jet injector is a type of medical injecting syringe that uses a high-pressure narrow jet of the injection liquid instead of a hypodermic needle to penetrate the epidermis. It was invented by Aaron Ismach in 1962.

1962 Light-emitting diode

* A light-emitting-diode (LED) is a semiconductor diode that emits light when an electric current is applied in the forward direction of the device, as in the simple LED circuit. The effect is a form of electroluminescence where incoherent and narrow-spectrum light is emitted from the p-n junction in a solid state material. The first practical visible-spectrum (red) LED was developed in 1962 by Nick Holonyak Jr., while working at General Electric Company.

1963 Computer mouse

* In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. The mouse&apos;s motion typically translates into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a Graphical User Interface. Douglas Engelbart invented the computer mouse at the Stanford Research Institute in 1963.

1963 Lung transplantation

* Lung transplantation is a surgical procedure in which a patient&apos;s diseased lungs are partially or totally replaced by lungs which come from a donor. Dr. James Hardy of the University of Mississippi Medical Center performed the first human lung transplant, the left lung, in 1963.

1964 Heart transplantation

* Heart transplantation or cardiac transplantation, is a surgical transplant procedure performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease. The most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor and implant it into the patient. The patient&apos;s own heart may either be removed or, less commonly, left in to support the donor heart. It is also possible to take a heart from another speciesor implant a man-made artificial heart. The first heart transplanted into a human occurred in 1964 at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi when a team led by Dr. James Hardy transplanted a chimpanzee heart into a dying patient.

1964 Artificial turf

* Artificial turf, or synthetic turf, is a man-made surface manufactured from synthetic materials, made to look like natural grass. It is most often used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass. David Chaney, who moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1960 and later served as dean of the North Carolina State University College of Textiles, headed the team of RTP researchers who created the famous artificial turf. Artificial turf was co-invented in 1964 by James M. Faria and Robert T. Wright, employees of Monsanto. Widely known as Astroturf, it was invented in 1964 by James M. Faria and Robert T. Wright and patented in 1967, originally sold under the name&quot;Chemgrass&quot;.

1965 Kevlar

* Kevlar is the registered trademark for a light, strong para-aramid synthetic fiber. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components. Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high strength-to-weight. Developed at DuPont in 1965 by Stephanie Kwolek, it was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires.

1965 Minicomputer

* Wesley A. Clark and Charles Molnar introduce the PDP-8, the world&apos;s first minicomputer, using integrated circuit technology. Because of its relatively small size and its low $18,000 price tag, Digital Equipment sells several hundred units.

1965 Compact disc

* A Compact Disc (also known as a CD) is an optical disc used to store digital data, originally developed for storing digital audio. While working at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, James Russell invented optical digital recording and playback. It was this technology as presented by Russell to companies such as Sony and Philips which formed the basis of the CD and DVD formats.

1967 Airbag

* An airbag is a vehicle safety device. It is an occupant restraint consisting of a flexible envelope designed to inflate rapidly in an automobile collision, to prevent vehicle occupants from striking hard interior objects such as steering wheels. An American inventor, Dr. Allen S. Breed, invented and developed a key component for automotive use: the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation first in 1967 to Chrysler.

1968 Apollo Lunar Module

* Tom Kelly as a project engineer at Grumman, successfully designs and builds the first Apollo Lunar Module. NASA achieves the first test flight on January 22, 1968 using a Saturn V rocket. Six missions would carry astronauts, the first being Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, to the moon surface and safely back home to earth.

1968 Virtual reality

* Virtual reality (VR) is a technology which allows a user to interact with a computer-simulated environment, be it a real or imagined one. Most current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences, displayed either on a computer screen or through special or stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information, such as sound through speakers or headphones. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland, with the help of his student Bob Sproull, created what is widely considered to be the first virtual reality and augmented reality (AR) head mounted display (HMD) system. It was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling, and the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe model rooms. In 1989, Jaron Lanier, the founder of VPL Research popularized the concept of virtual reality with his&quot;google n&apos; gloves&quot;system.

1969 Wide-body aircraft

* A wide-body aircraft is a large airliner with two passenger aisles, also known as a twin-aisle aircraft. Joe Sutter, the chief engineer of the jumbo jet program at Boeing designed the world&apos;s first wide-body aircraft, the Boeing 747, with it&apos;s first test flight on February 9, 1969.

1969 Taser

* A Taser is an electroshock weapon that uses Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology to cause neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI) and strong muscle contractions through the involuntary stimulation of both the sensory nerves and the motor nerves. The Taser is not dependent on pain compliance making it highly effective on subjects with high pain tolerance. For this reason it is preferred by law enforcement over traditional stun guns and other electronic control weapons. Jack Cover, a NASA researcher, began developing the Taser in 1969.

1970 Optical fiber

* An optical fiber is a glass or plastic fiber that carries light along its length. Optical fibers are widely used in fiber-optic communications, which permits transmission over longer distances and at higher data rates. Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar, researchers at Corning Glass, created a glass fiber so clear that it can communicate pulses of light. GTE and AT&amp;T will soon begin experiments to transmit sound and image data using fiber optics, which will transform the communications industry.

1970 Personal computer

* A personal computer (PC) is any computer whose original sales price, size, and capabilities make it useful for individuals, and which is intended to be operated directly by an end user, with no intervening computer operator. Today a PC may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer or a tablet computer. The Kenbak-1 is considered by the Computer History Museum and the American Computer Museum to be the world&apos;s first personal computer which was invented by John Blankenbaker.

1971 Liquid crystal display

* A liquid crystal display (LCD) is an electronically-modulated optical device shaped into a thin, flat panel made up of any number of color or monochrome pixels filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source (backlight) or reflector. James Fergason at the Westinghouse Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh while working with Sardari Arora and Alfred Saupe at Kent State University Liquid Crystal Institute produced the first LCDs based on the TN-effect, which soon superseded the poor-quality DSM types due to improvements of lower operating voltages and lower power consumption.

1971 Microprocessor

* A microprocessor incorporates most or all of the functions of a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit. The first microprocessor was the 4004, designed in 1971 by Ted Hoff for a calculator company named Busicom, and produced by Intel.

1971 E-mail

* Electronic mail, often abbreviated to e-mai, is any method of creating, transmitting, or storing primarily text-based human communications with digital communications systems. Ray Tomlinson as a programmer while working on the U.S. Department of Defense&apos;s ARPANET, sends the first e-mail message on a time-sharing computer. Tomlinson is also credited for making the&quot;@&quot;sign the mainstream of e-mail communications.

1972 C (programming language)

* C is a general-purpose computer programming language originally developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to implement the Unix operating system. Although C was designed for writing architecturally independent system software, it is also widely used for developing application software.

1972 Video game console

* A video game console is an interactive entertainment computer or electronic device that produces a video display signal which can be used with a display device such as a television to display a video game. A joystick or control pad is often used to simulate and play the video game. It was not until 1972 that Magnavox released the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, invented by Ralph H. Baer.

1972 Hand held calculator

* Invented by Jack Kilby, a calculator is a device for performing mathematical calculations, distinguished from a computer by having a limited problem solving ability and an interface optimized for interactive calculation rather than programming. Calculators can be hardware or software, and mechanical or electronic, and are often built into devices such as PDAs or mobile phones.

1973 Recombinant DNA

* Recombinant DNA is a form of synthetic DNA that is engineered through the combination or insertion of one or more DNA strands, thereby combining DNA sequences that would not normally occur together. In terms of genetic modification, recombinant DNA is produced through the addition of relevant DNA into an existing organismal genome, such as the plasmid of bacteria, to code for or alter different traits for a specific purpose, such as immunity. The Recombinant DNA technique was engineered by Stanley Norman Cohen and Herbert Boyer in 1973. They published their findings in a 1974 paper entitled&quot;Construction of Biologically Functional Bacterial Plasmids in vitro&quot;, which described a technique to isolate and amplify genes or DNA segments and insert them into another cell with precision, creating a transgenic bacterium.

1973 Personal watercraft

* A personal water craft (PWC) is a recreational watercraft that the rider sits or stands on, rather than inside of, as in a boat. Models have an inboard engine driving a pump jet that has a screw-shaped impeller to create thrust for propulsion and steering. Clayton Jacobson II is credited with inventing the personal water craft, including both the sit-down and stand-up models.

1974 Operating system

* An operating system is the infrastructure software component of a computer system; it is responsible for the management and coordination of activities and the sharing of the limited resources of the computer. The operating system acts as a host for applications that are run on the machine. The first operating system was invented by an American computer scientist and microcomputer entrepreneur name Gary Kildall at Digital Research Inc. It was called CP/M which would later by the suggestion of Bill Gates, was to be licensed for use by IBM.

1974 Seaborgium

* Seaborgium is a synthetic element that first produced by an American research team led by Albert Ghiorso at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley

1975 Digital camera

* A digital camera is a camera that takes video or still photographs, digitally by recording images via an electronic image sensor. Steven Sasson as an engineer at Eastman Kodak develops and builds the first digital camera using a CCD image sensor and 0.01 pixels.

1975 Ethernet

* Robert Metcalfe, while at Xerox invented the ethernet, a family of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks.

1976 Hepatitis B virus vaccine

* Baruch Samuel Blumberg identified and later developed a vaccine for the Hepatitis B virus.

1977 Magnetic resonance imaging

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI), is primarily a medical imaging technique most commonly used in radiology to visualize the structure and function of the body. It provides detailed images of the body in any plane. MRI provides much greater contrast between the different soft tissues of the body than computed tomography (CT) does, making it especially useful in neurological (brain), musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and oncological (cancer) imaging. The development of magnetic resonance imaging was first conceived by Paul Lauterbur who received a Nobel Prize in 2003 for his groundbreaking work. Raymond Vahan Damadian built the first full-body MRI machine and produced the first full magnetic resonance imaging (&quot;MRI&quot;) scan of the human body, albeit using a&quot;focused field&quot;technique that differs considerably from modern imaging.

1978 Spreadsheet

* A spreadsheet is a computer application that simulates a paper worksheet. It displays multiple cells that together make up a grid consisting of rows and columns, each cell containing either alphanumeric text or numeric values. Dan Bricklin founded Software Arts, Inc., and began selling VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program available for personal computers.

1979 Human-powered flight

* Cyclist Byron Allen crosses the English Channel in a pedal-powered aircraft called the Gossamer Albatross. The flight takes 2 hours, 49 minutes, and wins a 100,000 prize for its crew, headed by designer Dr. Paul MacCready. Constructed of Mylar, polystyrene, and carbon-fiber rods, the Albatross has a wingspan of 93 feet 10 inches (28.6 m) and weighs about 70 pounds.

1979 Polar fleece

* Polar fleece, usually referred to simply as&quot;fleece&quot;, is a soft napped insulating synthetic wool fabric made from PET or other synthetic fibres. One of the first forms of polar fleece was created in 1979 by Malden Mills, now Polartec LLC., which was a new, light, and strong pile fabric meant to mimic and in some ways surpass wool. Found in jackets, hoodies, and casual wear, fleece has some of wool&apos;s finest qualities but weighs a fraction of the lightest available woolens.

1981 Space shuttle

* For the first time, NASA successfully launches and lands its reusable spacecraft, the Space Shuttle. The shuttle can be used for a number of applications, including launch, retrieval, and repair of satellites and as a laboratory for physical experiments. While extremely successful, the shuttle program will suffer two disasters. The Challenger in 1986 explodes after takeoff, killing all on board. In 2003, structural failure during re-entry causes Columbia thermal protection system to malfunction, breaking the spacecraft apart and killing all aboard. George Mueller, an American from St. Louis, Missouri is widely credited for jump starting and overseeing the Space Shuttle program after the demise of the Apollo program. In 2010, the Space Shuttle, after nearly 30 years of duty, will be retired from service.

1981 Paintball

* Paintball is a game in which players eliminate opponents by hitting them with pellets containing paint usually shot from a carbon dioxide or compressed-gas (HPA or N20) powered paintball gun. The idea of the game was first conceived in 1976 by Hayes Noel, Bob Gurnsey, and Charles Gaines. and first played on June 27, 1981.

1981 Graphic User Interface

* Short for Graphical User Interface, the GUI was first developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, and a group of other researchers. A GUI uses windows, icons, and menus to carry out commands such as opening files, deleting files, moving files, etc. and although many GUI Operating Systems are operated by using a mouse, the keyboard can also be used by using keyboard shortcuts or arrow keys.

1982 Artificial heart

* An artificial heart is a mechanical device that is implanted into the body to replace the biological heart. Robert Jarvik implants the world&apos;s first permanent artificial heart, the Jarvik 7, into Dr. Barney Clark. The heart, powered by an external compressor, keeps Clark alive for 112 days.

1983 Internet

* The concept of packet switching of a network was first explored by Paul Baran in the early 1960s, thus later invented by Leonard Kleinrock. The first TCP/IP-wide area network was operational by January 1, 1983, when the United States&apos; National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. (This date is held by some to be technically that of the birth of the Internet.) It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1985. As of March 10, 2007, 2.114 billion people use the Internet, according to Internet World Stats, for many uses including e-mail and accessing the World Wide Web. In addition, both Bob Kahn and Vinton Cerf are globally known as the&quot;fathers of the internet&quot;since they invented Internet Protocol and TCP in 1972 while working on ARPANET at the U.S. Department of Defense. The entire network as we know it today, is streamlined into what is known as the Internet Protocol Suite.

1983 Voicemail

* Voicemail messages are stored on hard disk drives, media generally used by computers to store other forms of data. Messages are recorded in digitized natural human voice similar to how music is stored on a CD. To retrieve messages, a user calls the system from any phone, logs on using Touch-tones, and his messages can be retrieved immediately. Many users can retrieve or store messages at the same time on the same voicemail system. In 1979, Gordon Matthews formed a new company, VMX (Voice Message Exchange) and filed a patent, which was granted on February 1, 1983. Matthews patented what was called&quot;Voice Message Exchange,&quot;which is the pioneer patent for what later evolved into today&apos;s voicemail. Matthews eventually held over thirty-five patents relating to the technology. Hence, he is rightly dubbed the&quot;father of voicemail.&quot;

1988 Firewall

* A firewall is an integrated collection of security measures designed to prevent unauthorized electronic access to a networked computer system. It is also a device or set of devices configured to permit, deny, encrypt, decrypt, or proxy all computer traffic between different security domains based upon a set of rules and other criteria. At AT&amp;T Bell Labs, Bill Cheswick and Steve Bellovin were continuing their research in packet filtering and developed a working model for their own company based upon their original first generation architecture of a firewall.

1989 Galileo (spacecraft)

* Galileo was an unmanned spacecraft sent by NASA to study the planet Jupiter and its moons. It was launched on October 18, 1989 by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-34 mission. It arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, a little more than six years later, via gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth. Despite antenna problems, Galileo conducted the first asteroid flyby, discovered the first asteroid moon, was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, and launched the first probe into Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere. On September 21, 2003, after 14 years in space and 8 years of service in the Jovian system, Galileo&apos;s mission was terminated by sending the orbiter into Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere at a speed of nearly 50 kilometres per second.

1990 Hubble Telescope

* The space shuttle Discovery deploys the Hubble Space telescope 350 miles (560 km) above the Earth. Although initial flaws limit its capabilities, the Hubble will be responsible for numerous discoveries and advances in the understanding of space. From 1946 onward, Lyman Spitzer at NASA was the driving force behind the Hubble Space Telescope. As the U.S. raced to the moon in the 1960s, Spitzer worked to tie in research components. Finally, in 1975, NASA began work on the Hubble Space Telescope.

1993 Global Positioning System

* The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) developed by the United States Department of Defense. It is the only fully functional GNSS in the world. It uses a constellation of between 24 and 32 Medium Earth Orbit satellites that transmit precise microwave signals, which enable GPS receivers to determine their current location, the time, and their velocity. The GPS is the predecessor to Transit (satellite) which was launched in 1960.

1998 Embryonic stem cell

* A breakthrough in human embryonic stem cell research came in November 1998 when a group led by James Thomson (cell biologist) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison first developed a technique to isolate and grow the cells when derived from human blastocysts, a major advance that could one day help in organ transplantation, gene therapy and treatment of such maladies as paralysis, diabetes and AIDS.

1998 Virtual globe

* A virtual globe is a 3D software model or representation of the Earth or another world. A virtual globe provides the user with the ability to freely move around in the virtual environment by changing the viewing angle and position. Compared to a conventional globe, virtual globes have the additional capability of representing many different views on the surface of the Earth. These views may be of geographical features, man-made features such as roads and buildings, or abstract representations of demographic quantities such as population. In 1998, Microsoft released a popular offline virtual globe in the form of Encarta Virtual Globe 98. The first widely publicized online virtual globe was Google Earth in 2006, a comprehensive maping of the earth by the superimposition of images obtained from NASA satellite imagery, the global positioning system, aerial photography, and the GIS 3D globe.

[edit] 2000s

2001 Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe

* The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, measures the temperature of the Big Bang&apos;s remnant radiant heat. Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett, the mission is a joint project between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. The WMAP satellite was launched on 30 June 2001. On February 11, 2003 NASA&apos;s WMAP takes the first detailed&quot;baby picture&quot;of the universe. The image reveals the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error) and provides evidence that supports the inflationary theory.

2001 Segway PT

* The Segway PT was the world&apos;s first two-wheeled, self-balancing electric vehicle used for&quot;personal transport&quot;. It was invented by Dean Kamen.

2001 iPod

* iPod is an American brand of portable media players designed and marketed by Apple Inc. and launched on October 23, 2001. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple&apos;s hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including two American hardware engineers named Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey. More than 173 million iPods had been sold worldwide, making it the best-selling digital audio player series in history.

2002 Vacuum Cleaner (robotic)

* As a first of its kind with over 2.5 million units sold, the Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner made and sold by iRobot. The unit is a disc, 13.4 inches (34 cm) in diameter and less than 3.5 inches (9 cm) high. A large contact-sensing bumper is mounted on the front half of the unit, with an infrared sensor at its top front center. Colin Angle and Helen Greiner were the chief designers.

2004 NASA X-43

* NASA builds the X-43, attaining speeds in excess of Mach 9.8, the fastest free flying air-breathing hypersonic flight.

2004 SpaceShipOne

* SpaceShipOne was an experimental air-launched suborbital spaceplane that used a hybrid rocket motor. It completed the first privately funded human spaceflight on June 21, 2004. SpaceShipOne was developed by Mojave Aerospace Ventures (joint venture between Paul Allen and Scaled Composites, Burt Rutan&apos;s aviation company, in their Tier One program), without government funding. With the launch of SpaceShipOne, the commercialization of space travel and tourism could one day prove to be a reality.

2004 Mars Exploration Rovers

* Spirit (rover) is the first of NASA&apos;s two Mars Exploration Rovers. It landed successfully on Mars on 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin Opportunity rover (MER-B) landed on the other side of the planet. The rover has continued to function effectively over nineteen times longer than NASA planners expected, allowing it to perform extensive geological analysis of Martian rocks and planetary surface features. On March 5, 2004, NASA announced that Spirit had found hints of water history on Mars in a rock dubbed&quot;Humphrey&quot;. In addition, Spirit photographed the first high resolution colored image on the surface of another planet.

2006 HPV vaccine

* The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a vaccine that prevents infection with certain species of human papillomavirus associated with the development of cervical cancer and genital warts. In work that was initiated in the mid 1980s, the vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, the University of Rochester, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first preventive HPV vaccine, marketed by Merck&amp;Co. under the trade name Gardasil.

2009 Boeing 787 Dreamliner

* The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a mid-sized, wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner currently under development by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The Boeing 787 is the world&apos;s first jet airliner to use composite materials for most of its fuselage as well as raked wingtips which improve fuel economy, climb performance, and shorten takeoff field length. Boeing&apos;s development of the 787 is also innovative in the collaborative management approach with suppliers. As the fastest-selling wide-body jet airliner in aviation history, the Boeing 787&apos;s first test flight is scheduled for early 2009 with deliveries expected in 2010.

Woo, the rest of the world has invented it&apos;s fair share of stuff as well. I&apos;m not saying that some of the most common things we use today wasn&apos;t invented by an American, but not everything was.

 You realize that America was settled by the British, right?
I find it hilarious that you, an American, who is bleating about how awesome his heritage is, hasn&apos;t figured out he&apos;s a pom.
Unfortunately, along the lines of &apos;American evolution&apos;, your culture has corrupted everything individual that Britain made you in the first place.
Big mistake, really.
Britain made you great, and you are [as it has been said before me] too egotistical to admit that your country was settled by innovative people with imagination and courage to boot.
Now America is dependant upon the success of other, much smaller self-sufficient and imaginative countries to become successful.
Cheaters aren&apos;t winners in my eyes, I&apos;m afraid.
Also, lostmyface, that means the people who created those inventions were, in all honesty, British.

 I think I&apos;ll contribute some more.. with shorter, more to the point facts.

1. You are the only country where you must tip your bartender, your waiter, your hairdresser and so on, or you become excommunicated from society. Shouldn&apos;t the employer be paying their workers rather than the customer?

It&apos;s all right - charge me more for my food so you can pay your waitress more than $4 per hour. It will save me the trouble of calculating the tip. As an added bonus, I also won&apos;t need to worry about a worker spitting in my food next time if the tip wasn&apos;t what he or she expected. Another problem with tipping is that it encourages the server to get rid of you as fast as possible so he or she can get more tips from the next costumers that come in. The tipping culture really sucks.

2. The United States is environmentally unfriendly. The rest of the rich world looks toward the Kyoto treaty and petrol taxes to become more sustainable. However, President George W. Bush, along with most Americans, refuses to change. Everyone is terrified of having to pay more for energy and petrol. I could continue, but most people know about this problem, including how it results in America&apos;s addiction to foreign oil.

3. The fact that children need sexual education classes in fourth grade. Even parents cannot mention anything about the subject and need the school to teach their kids about the birds and the bees instead.

4. The drinking age, at 21.
This stupid law rips the social fabric of America into halves. On one side are those who are 21 along with those who are willing to risk using a fake ID. On the other side of the divide are the majority of college students who are under 21. At UConn, this group of students is forced, yes, forced, to risk their lives by walking down dark roads or trails to get a drink at a party.

In Europe, a drink at the pub follows nearly every college event or club meeting because the drinking age is only 16. Three days of orientation activities at the university is boring, right? Not when everyday ends with a relaxing drink and a chance to get to know your fellow students. Think how much of a better orientation UConn could have if a little drinking were allowed at the end of the day.

I&apos;m not saying the drinking age should be 16. The age of 18 is more reasonable in America so nearly all college students can go to the pub, thus dissipating the social divide.

And lastly...

Lawsuits. There have been many more lawsuits in the past few decades that have grown exponentially. Some stupid, but memorable lawsuits include the lady who sued the restaurant because she spilled hot coffee on herself. Another includes a man suing a casino for allowing him to gamble while he was drunk. It seems Americans will sue over just about anything these days.

I mean come on..

 This deviousness also serves purpose in American movies;
Half of restaurant conflicts in their movies revolve around the main character&apos;s tip being to small, or the character generally forgetting to tip. Thus, the waiter and/or the owner of the restaurant gets in a shit with the main character, and you have successfully filled 10 minutes of screen time with utter crap, and the captivated audience is none the wiser.

Oh your script writers are just amazing.
