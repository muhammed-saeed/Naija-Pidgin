Darden Restuarants, operator of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, announced plans Thursday to buy Irvine-based Yard House for $585 million.

The casual dining giant is purchasing the successful Orange County chain from the private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners in an all-cash deal.  Darden said Yard House, whose flagship restaurant launched in Long Beach in 1996, will become part of Darden’s Specialty Restaurant Group that includes The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s.

“This transaction offers a tremendous opportunity to begin the next chapter in Yard House’s high growth evolution to become a national brand,”Yard House CEO Harald Herrmann said in a prepared statement.”We’re excited about the opportunity, and that we and our team members will become a part of one of the world’s largest and most successful restaurant companies.”

Clarence Otis, Chief Executive of Darden, called Yard House an“one of the most differentiated and exciting restaurant brands in America today.”

Florida restaurant consultant Rick Van Warner said the Yard House sale is a great fit for Darden.

“They don’t have a beer-centric brand in their portfolio, and with the popularity of craft beer on the rise, it’s another significant slice of the casual dining market they can seek to dominate,”said Van Warner, president of The Parquet Group .

Yard House has become a force in the upscale casual dining market with its loud music, contemporary atmosphere, eclectic food and more than 100 beers on tap. In 2010, Yard House was named among the top 10 fastest-growing restaurant chains in the U.S. by restaurant consulting firm Technomic.

 

 Today, Yard House operates 39 restaurants in 13 states, including several in Southern California.  Average unit volumes are approximately $8.4 million, according to Darden.

 El Torito Grill closing at Fashion Island 
 July 12th, 2012, 1:53 pm by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 Another Fashion Island restaurant chain is exiting the Newport Beach mall.

 El Torito Grill is closing July 31. As a result, the restaurant plans to lay off 63  employees, according to a state employment filing.

A representative for the chain said the restaurant’s landlord, the Irvine Co., did not renew its lease. The Newport Beach El Torito Grill, which opened 26 years ago, was the first of what would eventually become a string of upscale Mexican restaurants in Southern California.

“We’re sad to be leaving and appreciate the support our guests in this community have given us over the years. We hope to serve them again in our other restaurants throughout Southern California,”said Rick Van Warner, a spokesman for Cypress-based Real Mex Restaurants .

The company operates El Torito, El Torito Grill, Chevys and Acapulco restaurants. Before emerging from bankruptcy earlier this year, the company had closed several restaurants. Managers are transferring to other Real Mex restaurants and hourly employees will have opportunities to transfer, where possible, Van Warner said.

The Irvine Co. declined to be specific when asked if it declined to renew El Torito Grill’s lease.

Spokeswoman Erin Freeman would only confirm that the“lease is expiring”and that the restaurant will close by the end of July.

The closure comes as Fashion Island undergoes a major revamp when it comes to dining. Other food chains that have left the center include the Daily Grill and Coco’s .  Both will be replaced by boutique dining establishments.

The 45-year-old mall is adding 22,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space over the next year. The changes will mean more retail stores and restaurants. In the fall, Whole Foods Market is slated to open at the center.

 OC Fair 2012: Your ultimate food guide 
 July 12th, 2012, 7:00 am by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 The Orange County Fair 2012 kicks off Friday, and when it comes to the food, this year’s showstoppers are huge slabs of hand-held, pig-centric meats.

“Everything is big and bacon-y,”fair spokeswoman Robin Wachner said.

New vendor Biggy’s Meat Market is going natural when it comes to the food-on-a-stick craze. The booth is selling The Big Rib, a two-pound beef rib on a 17-inch bone. The Bacon A-Fair booth, formerly known as the Deep Fried Butter Stand, will be hawking a bacon-wrapped, two-pound turkey leg called The Cave Man Club.

“We wrap it with a full pound of thick cut bacon,”fair vendor Mike Peterson said.

 Taco Bell feeds a small town in Alaska 
 July 11th, 2012, 3:46 pm by Staff Writer, the Orange County Register

Residents of Bethel, Alaska, must endure a big haul to get to the nearest Taco Bell in  Anchorage.  It’s about a four-hour trip by plane.  So when news spread around town that a Taco Bell would be opening in the small city of 6,000, locals were thrilled.

But, it turned out the opening announcement was a prank.  When Irvine-based Taco Bell learned of the hoax, savvy marketers decided to airlift a taco truck filled with 10,000 Doritos Locos tacos to the small town.  (Note: The primary means of transportation to and from the town is either by plane or boat.)

According to the Dallas Observer , Bethel’s only fast food joint is a Subway and the entire town has all of 11 restaurants.

You can see a video of the July 1 event here:

 Kentucky Fried Chicken’s infamous original recipe has shrunk down to bite-sized pieces. The KFC Original Recipe Bites are now available at a location near you.

The 100 percent white meat, hand breaded bites are larger than their popcorn chicken counter-parts. It’s like the coronal’s original recipe chicken… without those pesky bones!

The Original Recipe Bites are available in both six and 10 piece portions. For a limited time, patrons can purchase a six-piece Original Recipe Bites combo, which includes a side item and medium drink for $3.99 at participating locations nationwide.

It’s a boy! Wendy’s original Double Baconator has spawned a miniature version of itself. The Son of the Baconator joined the Wendy’s bacon family this week.

The bacon filled burger consists of two, 2.25 ounce patties, two American cheese slices, four strips of bacon, ketchup, and mayonnaise on a buttered, toasted bun. If you can believe it, its father weighs in heavier with its two 4 ounce patties.

The father and son duo will aim to satisfy the hunger of patrons with varying appetites.

The Original Baconator is $5.79 while the Son of the Baconator is $3.89.

Getting on the vegan and raw food bandwagon is not an easy feat. Local vegan restaurant, 118 Degrees , aims to make the transition easier by opening up two new Orange County locations this summer.

Within the next two weeks, Chef Jenny Ross will be opening up the first of two more 118 Degrees. The first one will open in the Anaheim Center Street Promenade. The other café will open in August or early September in Laguna Niguel’s Ocean Ranch Village.

The two new locations will be smaller than the current Costa Mesa location and will offer patio and communal seating as well as a quick to-go area.

The cafes will offer menu items that will complement their location’s surroundings as well as bring in some favorites off of the current menu. Read the rest of this entry»

 Updated: The Point set to open in Dana Point 
 July 11th, 2012, 9:01 am by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 Correction: Due to a reporting error, the ownership status of the three brewery restaurants was inaccurate. Josh Francis, Register reporter, regrets the error.  This blog post is updated below, as is the original online story. 

A restaurateur who once co-owned Huntington Beach Beer Co., Newport Beach Brewing Co. and Tustin Brewing Co. will soon open The Point restaurant in Dana Point.

 

 The owners of Huntington Beach Beer Co., Newport Beach Brewing Co. and Tustin Brewing Co. are slated to debut a new restaurant in Dana Point. 

The Point will feature a bar, live entertainment and a wine tap. It will not be a brewery.  The restaurant is expected to open next week.

 Address: 34085 Pacific Coast Highway—the former site of Caliente Coastal Cantina.

 Porn star Ron Jeremy talks about his rum venture 
 July 10th, 2012, 12:00 pm by PAUL HODGINS, THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER 
Photo by Paul Hodgins
 
Who was that familiar-looking middle-age guy surrounded by young men and beautiful women on Saturday at Costa Mesa’s Hi-Time Wine Cellars?

Why none other than Ron Jeremy , of course. Porn star. Rum maker.

“Take a whiff of this,” said Jeremy as he sat on a bar stool next to a life-size cutout image of himself. “It’s 94 proof. Check this out: vanilla, chocolate-y caramel.”

Jeremy screwed off the cap. He was right: the dark, exotic-looking rum had a great nose. Still, it was a little weird having Ron Jeremy order me to take a whiff of something.

 Ron De Jeremy Spice Rum ($14.99, 750 ml) is one of two products made under his label. I bought a bottle, and it’s a decent rum for mixing with summer drinks that contain juices and cola.

The two rums in the Ron de Jeremy line-up are made in Panama by respected 72-year old Cuban master distiller Francisco “Don Pancho” Fernandez . The other is a serious 7-year aged rum ($29.99 at Hi-Time) that has been getting good reviews. Read the rest of this entry»
