Techies- get a damn life. If all you have time to do is make fun of a poor innocent animal who died after only 3 short years of life, then you really have problems. Want to make fun of our team and our crappy season–fine. We all know that we suck this year. But let Uga rest in peace. He was a dog, for goodness sake. The bulldog nation lost a member of our family last week. Keep the competition and trash talking on the field and leave a poor innocent animal out of it.

 This is so wrong 
 
If true, your immense age might have tempered some of the original hate amongst your peers, therefore creating the impression that you guys don’t show much“hate”towards GT fans at your games. Good for you. Unfortunately the truth of the matter is that ugag fans are the most disrespectful group of fans I have ever encountered at a game. Be it in Atlanta or Athens, your fanbase has no limits when it comes to shame. I’ve seen your fans instigate fights with GT fans after you WON, throw bottles at female and children GT fans, and overall show a complete lack of sportsmanship regardless of the outcome of the game.

Sure, every fanbase will have that 10% that makes the rest of us cringe, but as a whole, the ugay fanbase pushes that percentage way beyond acceptible numbers. I’d love nothing more than for all of you to go the way of your dumb dawg.

Poor taste is selectively breeding a dog with it’s family members over and over again until all of its offspring are born with hearts that can barely sustain life and eyes that have a 2/3 chance of becoming severely diseased within 5 years. What’s the worst thing you can do to one of these“barrel chested”dogs? Expose it to several hours of high heat and humidity like one might encounter at a afternoon football game.

If a team deserves to lose because some of its fans are mean spirited, then Georgia would never win another game. Neither would any other team. The world’s full of assholes, and there are some in every team’s fan base.

Not only do you have concept of context, you also have no concept of time as GT played at 11:30 am, not at night. Knowing how to tell time is standard for a kindergarten education, so where exactly does that put you?

No one here has wished for the do to die, and frankly I don’t think anyone was making fun of the dog dying. All remarks were made at the expense of your team being horrible on the field. The worst possible thing about this post that anyone could point to could only be the picture. Anything after that is nothing more than mutt fans trying to make something out of nothing.

It has nothing to do with the fact that its a dog. It could be a turkey, a ram, or a 3-toed sloth, but the fact that its a mascot…THEIR mascot…makes me wish it dead.

These people that are bitching are the same people that watch Faces of Death because its fun to watch people die but they hate to see a dog with a sore pancreas because it makes them sad. Self-righteous assholes. I’m sure they are all donors to that home-grown terrorist group, the ASPCA.

 I&apos;ll add my two cents 
 
You know it’s all fun and games when we had our accident a couple years ago. They picked on us. Made fun of our car. But guess what? Real people were in that ridiculously terrible accident. The crash should’ve been a lot worse than it was and somehow it was this sick joke for Georgie fans. We make fun of a little dog passing away and they get offended.

Sorry, I don’t care. I don’t want people making fun of my dog and all but if people were coming after my son after he was in the worst car accident of his life, I’d be much more upset.

Jokes on everyone, I guess. It’s a rivalry. Move on if you’re pissed. But don’t get on this high horse like Georgie fans haven’t done similar things.

 People who have no children 
 
often compare pets to children. I don’t get it, but I understand it’s a real phenomenon.

However, that doesn’t mean that pets aren’t important to people. The Ugas are mascots during games but are family pets the rest of the year.

For the majority of Georgia fans, no, this isn’t a pet, it’s a symbol, and they’ve shown similar outrage about their shrubbery. I feel no sympathy for them.

For a few, though, the ones that spent a lot of time with the dog, it was something more, and I do feel sympathy for them. Others probably have strong bonds with their own pets and identify with the Ugas on a more personal level. I have sympathy for them, too.

It’s“U(sic)GA”, Fuzzy817, since it’s the“University”part that we are questioning. I applaud your attempt to use something other than the childish“UGAg”or“UGAy”.

My daughter’s Yellow Jacket roommate told her about this horrible cartoon posted on“From the Rumble Seat.”“It’s sick! Someone actually celebrated UGA VII’s death by drawing a cartoon of the Reck driving over the graves of past Ugas and about to hit Uga VII!”

My daughter looked at her and said,“Yeah, my dad drew that. And it was drawn weeks before Uga died.”Roommate said,“Ohhhh…”

I am the one who drew the cartoon above. A little background…I am not a Tech grad, and I don’t have any huge chip on my shoulder against UGA. I love dogs, and even love bulldogs. They’re fantastic, fun and loyal in real life, and Uga was a majestic dog, easy going and with a lot of character. Anyone wishing ill on him, or any other animal, is truly sick.

But the cartoon isn’t about Uga. The cartoon is about a college rivalry. The driver, Buzz, is fictitious. The UGA mascot is a bulldog named Uga VII, and while the ramblin’reck is about to hit that last speedbump it is the MASCOT that’s being abused. Not the dog. It is not about hurting animals; it’s about good old fashioned Georgia hate.

Bad taste? Sure. Twisted? Probably. Fun? Definitely. Offensive? Yup. Should one take it too seriously? No. Life is too short and there’s too much to enjoy.

Besides, Georgia’s getting their own cartoon. And Florida fans are going to be excited about that one just like Georgia fans are excited about THIS one.

The college football season is so fragile. It&apos;s like a glass ball being pushed around from stadium to stadium by a rhinoceros.

It’s always good to have a spoonfull dished out once in a while. Great drawing sir!
 
Corey Zickefoose: I think they should still be able to play football, regardless. Tennessee is my place. You know, it&apos;s my football team.

Reporter: Even after they put a gun in your face, you say let them play football?

Corey Zickefoose: Yeah. It&apos;s Tennessee. That&apos;s the way it is sometimes.

Welcome to the SEC!

 not a mutt - a DAMN GOOD DAWG 
 
Obviously you do not understand the heart of the University of GA nor the fact that the Uga bloodline are family pets. No matter what your feelings towards UGA, it is a terrible thing to lose a pet. This is disrespectful and classless.

 You, ma&apos;am 
 
Are fat and ugly.

Understanding the heart of the University(sic) of GA (which is, no doubt, surrounded by fat and reeks of arteriosclerosis from devouring fried foods three meals a day) is not necessary. You obviously did not read the posts about the mascot (not the pet) and how we are glad he died.

Maybe if you take time to have your granddaughter read them for you, you would understand them better. No one would ever be glad that a dog died..thats just sick. However, if U(sic)GA’s mascot, whatever it was, dies—we all must celebrate with joy.

I’m sure you’ll reply with some kind of post about how horrible I am as a human, but really…it doesnt matter. Just know that Saturday night about 11pm, I shall be dancing on UGA 7’s grave.

 To Chrisinindy from Russ 
 
Dear Chrisinindy:

You sir are a classless and typical Yech fan. While you were busy talking trash about my half-brother and preparing to“dance on his grave,”I was getting ready to lower the boom with my fellow Bulldogs on your overrated team. We did so with authority and I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed BDS. Good luck to you sir.

Love,
 
UGA Russ
1-0 vs. Georgia Tech (30-24)

p.s. I think I stepped on a few yellow jackets while on campus and for that I apologize because I know how much your mascot means to you all.

 Right now... 
 
UGA fans are pointing to this post as evidence of how classless Tech fans are. As a Tech student, football fan, and UGA hater…it hurts to say they have good point.

The argument that UGA (or school X) is just as classless is retarded and an admittance that you’re reducing yourself to that level.

Even if the cartoon was drawn weeks ago, pairing it with the news and the headline is a really douche bag-asshole move. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for good old fashion hate. But you can hate on Georgia fans all day and still have respect for one of college football’s most respected mascot lineages.

Rest in peace UGA 7.

And THWGA!

 So much happier... 
 
to have a real mascot as opposed to a fu@king yellow jacket. I think the life expectancy of a yellow jacket is about a day. I’m sure some Tech nerd will quote me the exact life expectancy up to the nano-second. Happy all you nerds got an impressive season. They are far and few between for ya.
