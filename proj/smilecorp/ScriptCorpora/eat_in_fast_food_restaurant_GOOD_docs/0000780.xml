I just ate here yesterday (01/21/08) and ordered the dbl cheese burger. I split a small order of fry&apos;s with my co-worker. Every thing was good, I enjoyed the all you can drink fountain soda. But, This place cannot hold a candle against the &apos;Squeeze Inn&apos; in Sacramento. The small fry&apos;s at the Squeeze Inn were twice as large. But, that&apos;s not saying we did not have enough fry&apos;s at the 88.
