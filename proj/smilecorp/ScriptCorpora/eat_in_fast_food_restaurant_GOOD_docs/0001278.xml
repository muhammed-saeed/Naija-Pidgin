Biscuits that Taste Like Popeye&apos;s Chicken - Budget Copy Cat Recipes
 Featured Recipe Submission...

I have a very easy recipe that tastes just like the biscuits at Popeye&apos;s Chicken.

 Biscuits 

3 cups baking mix (bisquick type- I use generic)
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup club soda or lemon lime soda
1 stick real butter, melted

Preheat oven to 375. Pour half of the melted butter into the bottom of a 9x9 baking pan (the square ones). Combine the baking mix, sour cream, and club soda until everything is just moistened and there are no lumps. You can either pat the batter onto a floured surface and kneed for a minute or two and cut out the biscuits for prettier biscuits, or you can spoon the batter directly into the baking pan. Either way the dough will be soft. Flip each biscuit in the butter as you put it into the pan to coat the top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown. Remove from the oven and pour the remaining butter over the top and let it soak in. Makes between 8 and 12 biscuits depending on the size.

Our Favorite Cooking Quote/Poem
 &quot;Thank God for Dirty Dishes, They have a tale to tell. While others are going hungry, We&apos;re eating very well.
With home and health and happiness, I shouldn&apos;t want to fuss. For by this stack of evidence, God&apos;s very good to us.”
